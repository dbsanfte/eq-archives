<div id="ygrps-yiv-835850471">I am sure you all have seen the list of spells.  But I really wanted to make so comments. <br/>
This is an enchanters take on the changes.<br/>
<br/>
- Players will no longer crash when an extremely long group message is received.<br/>
<br/>
Preventing the from crashing is always a good thing. <br/>
<br/>
- Added the ability to pull one item &quot;charge&quot; from a stack by holding down the &quot;Control&quot; key when left-clicking on the stack.<br/>
<br/>
For anyone who has ever tried to advance in a trade skill this is a welcomed change.<br/>
<br/>
- After casting a spell at an NPC, if the target were lost before the spell made contact, the caster would crash.<br/>
<br/>
This is a declaritive statement.  Did they fix it or are they just acknowleding it?<br/>
<br/>
- The &quot;/ignore&quot; command will now ignore emotes also.<br/>
- The chat command &quot;/e&quot; will trigger &quot;/emote&quot; instead of exiting to the character selection screen.<br/>
<br/>
Can&#39;t argue with change for the better.<br/>
<br/>
- We have added new sound tracks to the Planes, Crushbone, Guk, Mistmoore, Steamfont, and the Estate of Un<br/>
<br/>
I would rather have the bug worked on over the soundtracks but that is just my own opinion.<br/>
<br/>
- We have reduced the amount of experience lost when dying by 50%.<br/>
<br/>
This would have helped me 2 weeks ago when I hit level 14, 13 different times.  Probably my favorite of the non enchanter changes.<br/>
<br/>
- A number of new quests have been added to various zones.<br/>
<br/>
But the question is do they actually work?<br/>
<br/>
- Magician pets (elemental) will now cast minor spells (to make up for their lack of kick)<br/>
- New Magician spells on vendors and some Magician spells have moved to different vendors<br/>
- New Magician weapons for Summon Fang & Spear of Warding & Dagger of Symbols<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t play an enchanter but I am sure that they will like this.<br/>
<br/>
- New enchanter whirl spell (check the vendors)<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know what level this is for?<br/>
<br/>
- Whirl now works on MOBS better than it did on the last patch.<br/>
- The saving throw against Memory Blur and Atone was reduced (harder to save against) from the last patch.<br/>
<br/>
THEY LISTENED!  I am suprised.  Although they didn&#39;t put it back to where it was, I am happy.  Really it could be a sham, the change could be only one percentage point of resist and it would still be true.  BUT they did listen to us and made an attempt to apiece us.<br/>
<br/>
- AC added to the Rune Series (Enchanter)<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t have it yet but at least it isn&#39;t a downgrade.<br/>
<br/>
- Alliance series works better (Enchanter)<br/>
- Enchanter Attack Speed spells now have longer durations (Quickness, Alacrity, etc.) <br/>
- Tashan (the entire Enchanter series) is now quicker to cast, costs less mana, and is harder to save against.<br/>
<br/>
What took so long?  These should not have been patches after the game was released.  Tashan has always been pretty useless along with Alliance.  And I told that the speed spells weren&#39;t worth the mana for what you got.<br/>
<br/>
- New bard songs have been added to the vendors<br/>
- Paladins lose the spell Bravery, and gain the spell Valor<br/>
- ShadowKnights and Necromancers gain the Word of Spirit spell (replacing Word of Shadow for the ShadowKnight)<br/>
- ShadowKnights lose Haunting Corpse and gain Summon Dead<br/>
- Necromancers and ShadowKnights get a new spell - Shadow Vortex.<br/>
- ShadowKnights lose Intensify Death (replaced by Shadow Vortex)<br/>
- Rangers lose Shield of Barbs and gain Shield of Brambles<br/>
<br/>
Good for them....  =)<br/>
<br/>
- Shorter stun effects will no longer remove longer stun effects (Bash won&#39;t get rid of whirl, for example)<br/>
<br/>
Another example of Feedback in action.<br/>
<br/>
- Spell components are now stackable<br/>
<br/>
Again what took so long.  Why were they ever created not stackable?<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t let this stop any of your feedback or petitions.  Tonight send a feedback giving thanks for the improvements, but also tell them what needs to be improved.  <br/>
