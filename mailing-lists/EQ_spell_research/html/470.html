<div id="ygrps-yiv-2111709625">That is true, from an initial one point in a language it takes about 4 to 5 hours depending on zone time, turn off Group chat filter that way it is easier to see improvement (you still learn with group off). Then make a plan to notify the other<br/>
person since they will be spaming themselves and will not see words, do a wave or jump. You want to do this after you see 2 improvements. So one person teaches on one side and the other person takes the other side.<br/>

&gt; Tom, how do you improve a language without learning from someone who is<br/>
&gt; excellent? In other words, how would two average speakers of Old Erudian<br/>
&gt; work their language skill up? Someone told me that we should group, spam<br/>
&gt; each other, get two improves, then zone. Then repeat until you faint. Is<br/>
&gt; this correct?<br/>
