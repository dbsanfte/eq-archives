<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I don&#39;t play an enchanter but I am sure that they will like this.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Grouped with magician friend today. He was level 19, made 20. durring that<br/>
time his pet never once cast a spell<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;- New enchanter whirl spell (check the vendors)<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Does anyone know what level this is for?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The big problem for Enchanters came about when a level 45 Enchanter and a<br/>
cleric (not sure of cleric level, but probably around 40ish also) got<br/>
together and was taking on stuff they shouldnt have been able to take from<br/>
usng whirl, a pet, and heal. The enchanter was able to cast whirl about 60<br/>
times (at his level the mana use was extremely negligable) one a creature<br/>
that had over 1600 hp and could take it out. The cleric just kept healing<br/>
the pet and or enchanter. Verrant moved to put a stop to this buy nerfing<br/>
the whirl so that they could not do this. If i am correct, whirl till you<br/>
hurl does NOT effect monsters over level 30, and the new whirl is needed<br/>
(which is a level 29 spell).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;- AC added to the Rune Series (Enchanter)<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Don&#39;t have it yet but at least it isn&#39;t a downgrade.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Great, but unfortunatly bugged. You cannot cast the rune spell if you have<br/>
another ac bearing spell in place (like mist or clerical holy armor)<br/>
although casting rune will still result in the loss of the Cat&#39;s Eye Agate.<br/>
suprised they missed this obvious bug, but look for it to be corrected.<br/>
<br/>
And one last thing that was NOT mentioned and i think many of you will find<br/>
very nice. A new spell has been added to the Enchanter spell line. It is<br/>
level 29 spell that increases GROUP mana regeneration by 50%. This<br/>
information was found on the Words Of Enchantment message site at<br/>

Sorry this was a bit off topic, but felt that it could be information useful<br/>
to all.</div>
