<div id="ygrps-yiv-959538151">According to Lomack:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; According to a message that was posted on the Magicians ONElist, relayed by<br/>
&gt; the Guy that does the spells for EQ. (sorry I forgot his name).  There are<br/>
&gt; spells that can not be bought for all classes.  Whos to say that they are<br/>
&gt; listed in those books.  He did say that once the mysterious spells were<br/>
&gt; discovered by  many others they may eventually become sold on vendors.  He<br/>
&gt; also said that they did some pretty nice things.  I am assuming that it<br/>
&gt; works this way for all classes and not just magicians.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I expect quests to lead to those books. And putting them for sale after discovery<br/>
is good, because they&#39;ll be common knowledge within a week or two of<br/>
implementation anyway :)<br/>
