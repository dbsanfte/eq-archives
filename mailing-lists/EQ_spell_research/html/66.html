<div id="ygrps-yiv-295082829">Being a Dark Elf, I am born with a good understanding of Elder Tier&#39;Dal as are my brothers and sisters. As you may be able to find one of us who is willing to teach you (as I would be in return for learning other languages), it will be most difficult for us to sit under protection of the round ears, or for our Dragoon&#39;s to tolerate the same ilk.<br/>
