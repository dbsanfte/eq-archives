<div id="ygrps-yiv-312219270">I&#39;m amazed you could get spells through on a Griffon or HG at that level. Both of these are level 30+ monsters. Accordingly I wouldn&#39;t think a level 18-20 group should be able to get one spell through. Certainly with my Wizard if it&#39;s more that a couple levels higher than me I don&#39;t even bother casting as it will get resisted fully.<br/>
<br/>
Unless I misread your post, I think it only prudent that Verant change this. There&#39;s no way a group of 18-20 lvl players, regardless of class, should be taking down monsters that are double their level. That&#39;s a tad extreme.<br/>

	He he, good luck.  Apparently Verant decided Whirl was too powerful<br/>
and they downgraded it.  They&#39;ve been doing it quietly to one server at a<br/>
time and it hit Karana last night.  My Enchanter friends noticed an<br/>
IMMEDIATE difference when they logged in, with Whirl now being resisted 35%<br/>
of the time by blues and going up with each monster level.<br/>
<br/>
	also expect LifeDrain to start being resisted hardcore in the near<br/>
future.  I grouped with four other 18-20th level Necromancers and we could<br/>
kill a Griffin easily, though a Hill Giant was still quite in the danger<br/>
zone (ie first time it killed all the pets and one necro, second time we<br/>
ran, third time we killed it).  Personally I don&#39;t see how nasty this is<br/>
simply because I gained like MAYBE an eighth of a bubble of XP per griffin<br/>
kill, and there was tons of waiting.  I just wanted to see if I could do it,<br/>
and now its time to go back to Oasis killing crocs. ;)<br/>

&gt; &gt;Subject: Lil bit from an Enchanter<br/>
&gt; &gt;Just a lil point, <br/>
&gt; &gt;I have watched a group of lvl 16 necros kill sand giants.... <br/>
&gt; Ok, thats<br/>
&gt; fine, but here is what irks me. I realize that as an <br/>
&gt; enchanter I am not<br/>
&gt; &gt;expected to do the offense like wizards, magicians or even <br/>
&gt; necros, Our<br/>
&gt; prime directive is debuffing and buffing and we get some incredible<br/>
&gt; &gt;spells. Here are my rants. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am a 20th level enchanter and I solo all the time,  I <br/>
&gt; simply use my pet<br/>
&gt; and whirl the creatures with no problem.  I have been soloing <br/>
&gt; since level<br/>
&gt; 8th.  Granted level 15th and 19th were hard with only a 12th <br/>
&gt; and 16th level<br/>
&gt; pet, but I made it.  I do believe that groups will appreciate <br/>
&gt; you more once<br/>
&gt; you get the whirl till you hurl spell.  I have people swear <br/>
&gt; to me that they<br/>
&gt; would rather fight with a enchanter vs wizard anyday due to <br/>
&gt; the fact that<br/>
&gt; they can whirl and have a pet.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;1. we don&#39;t get enought buff or debuff that only WE have. <br/>
&gt; Why do other<br/>
&gt; classes get beserker str? Thats unbeknownst to me. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You are incorrect Ber. Str is available to enchanters as a 20th level<br/>
&gt; research spell.  I confirmed this with a 30th level <br/>
&gt; enchanter.  (I came<br/>
&gt; across a spell list that had the spell and couldn&#39;t find it <br/>
&gt; anywhere, I<br/>
&gt; then decided to ask the 30th level enchanter if they had it, <br/>
&gt; they did, they<br/>
&gt; researched it).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;2. Ok, i can understand perhaps them resisting our offensive <br/>
&gt; dmg spells<br/>
&gt; but how are we supposed to be a group debuffer if they resist all &gt;our<br/>
&gt; spells? Even after using tashan or tashanii which also have a <br/>
&gt; tendency to<br/>
&gt; get resisted? Kinda makes us useless in that regard eh?<br/>
&gt; &gt;Just a few things im kinda irked about...<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I honestly believe all mage classes have this problem of <br/>
&gt; monsters resisting<br/>
&gt; spells.  I was fighting a DW Croc yesterday at full health <br/>
&gt; and full mana.<br/>
&gt; I almost died.  I lost my pet (20th level) and had 3 resisted <br/>
&gt; sanity warped<br/>
&gt; spells (92 points of damage currently) and 5 resisted whirl <br/>
&gt; till you hurl.<br/>
&gt; I had to rely on a kind necro for the help to kill it in the <br/>
&gt; end.  BTW the<br/>
&gt; DW Croc was blue to me, I rarely ever cast a tashen spell.  I <br/>
&gt; find that I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; just as sucessful with it as without it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Do not sell yourself short.  Enchanters are amoung one of the <br/>
&gt; most powerful<br/>
&gt; classes out there, on the otherhand also one of the most <br/>
&gt; difficult to play.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just my 2 coppers worth for you.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; To all out there, this might of been a tad bit off topic. But <br/>
&gt; I did mention<br/>
&gt; the research part about bersker Str.  8)  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Safe journey to all and Good Luck.<br/>
