<div id="ygrps-yiv-42198087">Help please!<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone tell me how to correctly research?<br/>
Every time I try it I get the message &quot;the quantities<br/>
and componenets are not in the correct amount to <br/>
produce anything&quot; or something to that affect.<br/>
Is this the standard fail message or am i doing <br/>
something wrong?  I&#39;m a magician and have the elmental<br/>
grimore which has 4 slots, should i put something <br/>
in all four slots or do we just use 2(one word and <br/>
one component).  Can anyone answer that for me?<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have a good site to go to that explains <br/>
reasearch?  I sure cant find one.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks</div>
