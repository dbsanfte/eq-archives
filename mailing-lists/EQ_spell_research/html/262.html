<div id="ygrps-yiv-115278512">If you look at the E-Mail carefully I am stating that you<br/>
have nothing to fear from E-Mail sent viruses IF you do not<br/>
download the attachment.<br/>
<br/>
I said nothing about the people knowing all about viruses.<br/>
<br/>
I just don&#39;t want everyone to run screaming from this<br/>
message list cause they are afraid that their harddrive will<br/>
explode. Most people in fact know very little about viruses.<br/>
<br/>
I was attempting to calm the fears that some people have<br/>
about viruses...especially ones sent by E-Mail.  Just look<br/>
at how many people believed in the Good Times virus.<br/>
<br/>
And it did not exist.</div>
