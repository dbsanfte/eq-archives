&gt;  They see thier first skill increase. &quot;You have become better<br/>
&gt;  at evocation (1).&quot;<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  They do not have to wait till the skill gets to 9 before<br/>
&gt;  seeing it. That just means that people just miss seeing the<br/>
&gt;  first 8 messages. (Maybe you all have EVERY hit and miss<br/>
&gt;  showing up on your message window and it is flying by.  I<br/>
&gt;  personally turn the others hits and misses off so that I<br/>
&gt;  don&#39;t get bothered by the messages.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have found it depends on the skill... and often depends if it is a brand <br/>
new skill or not.<br/>
<br/>
if I have a skill where &quot;you have learned the basics&quot; comes up... I will see <br/>
NOTHING until it advances to my level.<br/>
<br/>
An example... I have seen this as a cleric and a pure caster.  With <br/>
meditate... watching VERY closely for it... as I mage I see nothing until it <br/>
I see &quot;you have learned meditate (5)&quot; as a Cleric I see nothing until &quot;you <br/>
have learned meditate (9)&quot;  or whatever the phrasing is.  I DON&#39;T see <br/>
anything until it passes the level I got the skill at.<br/>
<br/>
as a Fighter I have seen this for skills such as bash...  No messages until I <br/>
get it to 10. (fighters get bash at 9)<br/>
<br/>
now all casters have the &quot;basics&quot; at all casting skills at 0&#39;th level :)  (or <br/>
at the start) so you see the first one.<br/>
