&lt;Nipped a bunch of good stuff&gt;<br/>
&gt; Another nifty possible use for languages:  improving your faction with<br/>
&gt; someone.   Going up to a merchant of another race and addressing them<br/>
&gt; fluently in their own tongue should be worth something, shouldn&#39;t it?<br/>
Not<br/>
&gt; that it is yet, but it&#39;d be a fun suggestion for the non-magic races to<br/>
get<br/>
&gt; some small use out of languages.<br/>
<br/>
This would be a useful thing for those who do not cast spells..after<br/>
all....what could be better that talking to a NPC in his naitive tounge?<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Last thought:  I wonder if it&#39;s possible to teach languages over a Guild<br/>
&gt; channel?<br/>
<br/>
Tried this..didn&#39;t work...you have to be in a group and use the group tell<br/>
AND your skill has to be better than the person that you are speaking to for<br/>
them to get any language skills out of it.<br/>
