<div id="ygrps-yiv-1090193551">Funny story here...I spent quite a few levels in MM and never found a single <br/>
spell component.  I guess when they made the zone, they forgot to program <br/>
the mobs to randomely drop spell components.  Head to just about any other <br/>
zone and kill level 24 + level mobs.  *Any* mob that is 24 to 28 has a <br/>
chance to drop level 24 runes, you just have to keep killing them and hope <br/>
you get lucky.  If you are looking for a particular rune, I suggest that you <br/>
head to a dungeon and every so often /auction that you are buying that rune. <br/>
  The exception here is MM, don&#39;t go there for any spell components &lt;G&gt;.<br/>

&gt;and graveyard but i dont find ONE ..rune anyone know what mobs drop runes<br/>
&gt;easy and wich zone i will go there at last to buy some?<br/>

3: I&#39;m not certain, but I believe this is for enchanters.  They put the <br/>
faded page into their research book all by it self and click combine, then <br/>
they get a normal page back out that they can use for spells.  Or they fail <br/>
their research check and get &#39;your skills are not sufficient...&#39; message.<br/>
<br/>
4:  Azia and Beza (I think)  What happened here is when the big Z made the <br/>
spell researches, he forgot what words he used and accidently named the <br/>
words he used for different spells the same name.  Later when he realized he <br/>
screwed up (read: got hundreds of email for irate players like myself <br/>
bitching at him), he decided just to add the &#39;Azia&#39; for the lower level <br/>
spell and &#39;beza&#39; for the higher one so you could tell the difference.  A lot <br/>
of people thought the spell in the book was wrong because they got the <br/>
message, &#39;these items do not combine...&#39;, even when they put the correct <br/>
words in.  The problem was that they were using the word from the wrong <br/>
spell, even though they had the same name.  Hence the addition of the &#39;azia <br/>
and &#39;beza&#39; identifiers.<br/>
<br/>
To answer you question after that rambling diatribe:  I think that the Azia <br/>
is for the lower level spell and the Beza is for higher...if you buy the <br/>
research book, or get an updated spell list from the web, It should tell you <br/>
for sure though.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;I have some questions about some words if any of you know the answers.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1.  I have about 7 words of Dominion but one of them won&#39;t stack with the<br/>
&gt;rest?  Is this bug from a word from before the stacking patch or is there<br/>
&gt;some other use for a non stacking word?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;2. I have Words of Pacification and Words of Derivation.  Can someone tell<br/>
&gt;me what spells these are for?  I looked all over a few sites that have<br/>
&gt;research info and couldn&#39;t find either of these words listed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;3.  I have a Velishouls Tome Faded Page but it dosen&#39;t have a page number<br/>
&gt;associated with it.  I noticed on the lists that there are 2 versions of<br/>
&gt;Faded pages for Velishouls Tome.  One a page 16 and one a page 108.  Does<br/>
&gt;anyone know which version of the Faded page I have if it has no page <br/>
&gt;number?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;4.  I have Words of the Sentient but there appear to be two different types<br/>
&gt;one says &quot;A.... the other B....   (I put dots in to signifify that I can&#39;t<br/>
&gt;remember the rest of the word.  But these A and B words are in parenthesies<br/>
&gt;after the name of the Page.  Any clue what each is for?  I know Words of<br/>
&gt;the Sentient are used for the Necro spell Restless Bones and Intensify<br/>
&gt;Death.  I assume one type is for each spell.  Can someone tell me which is<br/>
&gt;which?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Its amazing the stuff you find when you start sorting all your junk in the<br/>
&gt;bank :)<br/>
