Subject: Testament of Vanear, for research.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have acquired a book called the Testament of Vanear as part of a quest.  It is missing two pages which a NPC named Ran (Librarian in High Hold) supposedly stole.  It appears that if these two pages are acquired and combined in the Testament that you will get a working copy of the Testament of Vanear.  <br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if this was a book for research, or it had another purpose.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance. </span></blockquote></div>
