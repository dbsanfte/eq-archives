<div id="ygrps-yiv-343978192">Levitate and flight are the same thing. Researched flight, got a scroll, scroll said levitate.  Only difference is that the researched spell was wiz only, while the one bought from a friendly Troll Shamen in Grobb could be scribed by several different classes.<br/>
<br/>
Now to find some place to get bat wings where there arn&#39;t wandering guards who want to kill a poor Teir&#39;Dal such as myself.<br/>
