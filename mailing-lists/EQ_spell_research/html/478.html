<div id="ygrps-yiv-1034244581"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt; Tom, how do you improve a language without learning from someone who is<br/>
 </span></blockquote>excellent? In other words, how would two average speakers of Old Erudian<br/>
work their language skill up? Someone told me that we should group, spam<br/>
each other, get two improves, then zone. Then repeat until you faint. Is<br/>
this correct? &lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it is correct. A friend and I were able to work our Old Erudian from<br/>
awful to average this way. We&#39;ll be working it up to excellent another time.<br/>
<br/>
Basically, you can improve someone to 1 skill point over your level. When<br/>
you zone, the other person improves you to one over their level. Repeat ad<br/>
nauseum.<br/>
