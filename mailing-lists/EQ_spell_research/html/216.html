<div id="ygrps-yiv-59175047">The Jynn&#39;Thra skulls are so common.  If you have one in your bank or on<br/>
hand you can&#39;t pick up more than one (they are lore items).  I gave one<br/>
away to someone I was selling a staff too.<br/>
	Now how to combine them is unknown by everyone I ask.  But I do believe<br/>
that there is a way that is either kept hush by Verant or isn&#39;t implemented<br/>
fully.<br/>

&gt;Which skull do you combine?  The Jynn&#39;Thra one (can&#39;t remember the exact<br/>
&gt;name)?  Any idea on how much it sells for?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And yes, the stats on that skull are +20 mana, +3 SV magic.<br/>
