&gt; Hi.  We were petitioning regarding a steal killer in the Gorge of King<br/>
&gt; Xorbb, and were told by a GM that it&#39;s not a violation to steal kills.<br/>
&gt; Training to intentionally try and kill is, but stealing no.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I petition about loseing the first kill and LJ spawned 2 minutes later on a Necro which cast boiling blood ran  , and then we engaged Lj , who do ya think got the kill ..????<br/>
<br/>
And as For traing people I never do on  Purpose, But when There stealing my killing I have to draw allot more( 3-4 red to me to to make sure I get a Kill .. If He jumps them ..  We he took all the rest he might as well have these *GRIN*  (eg I<br/>
train to zone , and A Kill stealer will usually try and pick one off .. you just have to get VERY reds and That way I DID not train him .. he attacked it..<br/>
