<div id="ygrps-yiv-1922911467">C&#39;mon guys, this is an easy one, you get the languages from your Class/level<br/>
... I&#39;ve picked up Gnoll, Lizard man, Barbarian, and a couple others as a<br/>
Euradin BEFORE i even left the isle. It has nothing to do with exposure.<br/>
Perhaps a Barbarian came thru Erudin, but i KNOW i never saw a gnoll before<br/>
i got Gnoll, and i have YET to see a lizardman.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I played an enchanter to 10th level in beta, and the languages came<br/>
thru exactly the same for levels.<br/>
