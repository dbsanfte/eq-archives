<div id="ygrps-yiv-468282020">This is my experience in languages.<br/>
<br/>
1. You must be grouped with whom you are learning.<br/>
2. He/She must have greater skill than you.<br/>
3. You must talk in /gsay for it to increase your<br/>
level.(Never raised my skill with /say /tell or /shout).<br/>
4. As for skills being allowed even after not meeting the<br/>
creature. I think that certain ones can be learned just<br/>
because of your level.  After I level up I am sure to visit<br/>
my guildmaster and he has one or two languages for me to<br/>
learn.  Otherwise I would know Sphinx, and Gryphon, and Hill<br/>
giant allready...hehe.</div>
