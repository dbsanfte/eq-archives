I know the Wizard&#39;s Canon (I guess some are calling this the first book...)<br/>
is Old Erudian.  Is the Doctrine of Wizardry written in Elder Elvish or<br/>
Tier&#39;Dal?   I&#39;ve heard there are four books yet you list 5 languages that<br/>
you know or are working on.  Are there more than four books?  I really wish<br/>
you were on my server. I&#39;d happily pay 5 plat to learn those languages.<br/>
Also, do wizards need ONLY runes?<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone on the Karana server teach me other languages?  I&#39;ll pay/trade<br/>
for them... (I already know Old Erudian to excellent.  I also have several<br/>
non-rune reseach components I would gladly trade providing I dont need them<br/>
myself.)<br/>

    I am excellent in Dragon, Combine, Old Eurdian, Elder Elvish, and am<br/>
working on Elder Tier&#39;Dal today.  I will be happy to teach Dragon and<br/>
Combine for 6 runes each.  The rest, I will teach for 3 runes or 5 plat<br/>
each.  I am located on the Tarew Marr server.  I am firm on the Dragon and<br/>
Combine btw.  I won&#39;t accept money but only runes for those languages.<br/>
