<b>Subject:</b> Happy99: what it is and how to fix it. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-854220337">Sorry for such an off topic post, but I want to clear the air about this<br/>
Virus.  Many of the posts so far have been flames or just plain wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Happy99 is a trojan horse program that appears to be a small fireworks<br/>
display when run.  If you don&#39;t download, save, and execute this program,<br/>
then your computer won&#39;t become infected.  Once infected, any time you send<br/>
an email message, Happy99 creates a second email with itself as an<br/>
attachement. <br/>
<br/>
Please don&#39;t flame the person who sent this, nor complain to his ISP.  In<br/>
all likelyhood, he had no knowledge he was even sending this virus.  The<br/>
virus sends itself.  Just notify him he has a virus.<br/>
<br/>

I don&#39;t know who hosts the above site, but the instruction are very straight<br/>
forward.<br/>
