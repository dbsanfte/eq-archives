<div id="ygrps-yiv-560212855">I have looked in all the research books and this spell is<br/>
not present.<br/>
I also spoke with a higher level Necro to see if they had<br/>
it...and they said they did.<br/>
When asked where they found the spell...they pointed me to<br/>
the Troll SK guild to a vendor that was supposed to have it.<br/>
<br/>
That vendor did not have the spell, but did have two copies<br/>
of the Banshee aura spell.<br/>
<br/>
I petitioned about this but the GM&#39;s have no knowledge of<br/>
what is supposed to be at a vendor...this particular guide<br/>
killed the vendor to have him reappear again...which<br/>
apparently can fix problems with them, but to no avail...she<br/>
then logged it as a bug to Verant.<br/>
<br/>
If this is the place to get the spell I am only looking for<br/>
information so that I stop going out of my mind searching<br/>
the all of Norath for a spell I will not use all that often.</div>
