<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-228660291">1st thing is i wish folks would limit their discussion to Research<br/>
related topics. 2 times already i almost unsubscribed because of the off<br/>
subject discussions luckelly both of these times someone managed an<br/>
email on research or on languages wich i have found very usuafull.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, i finnally decided to take some time and start researching<br/>
(bank was getting too full) here is my limited experience:<br/>
<br/>
I researched with the appropriate book open and in my inventory, since i<br/>
have heard that it somehow helps success rate.<br/>
I researched with all intel and wisdom gear on me that i do not normally<br/>
wear to increase success rate.<br/>
I researched with only runes that are listed in the books and did not<br/>
add anything extra.<br/>
I researched only spells that are below my current lvl,since apparantly<br/>
we cannot research something above our own current circle.<br/>
<br/>
i started my 1st wizard research spell at about skill 47, did it 12<br/>
times and gained 3 skill points to 50th skill:<br/>
<br/>
The 1st 2 i did were 2 spells of the 16th lvl, 2 tried, 2 success (they<br/>
were trivial so no skill gain but a friend needed them)<br/>
<br/>
I skipped 20th,and went to 24th lvl spells 9 times, 6 successfull, 2 i<br/>
lacked the skill to produced spell.Gained 3 skill point.<br/>
i messed up one by not paying attention and (i assume) put the wrong<br/>
runes, got the message that the combination did not produce anything.<br/>
<br/>
Next, i tried my hand on 29th one time. Unfortunatly after putting the<br/>
correct runes(29th take 3 runes) and combining they did not combine to<br/>
produce anything . so i am assuming that 29th spells need a 4th<br/>
component, the book did not mention anything else so i am clueless as to<br/>
what else is needed.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone can shed some light as to wether something else is needed<br/>
after 29th , i would appreciate it.<br/>
Also i am quiet puzzled by runes wich do not appear in any of the 4<br/>
books. Guess there must be more books out there,maybe quest rewards?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
BTW i am on solusek Ro server and have lots of words and pages (more<br/>
than 30) that i would be willing to trade for runes, or exchange them<br/>
for learning book languages.<br/>
