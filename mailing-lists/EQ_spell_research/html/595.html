<b>Subject:</b> Velishoul&#39;s Tome? Can anyone help? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-455508465">As u know, we sometimes find some velishoul&#39;s pages on monsters. I ve seen someone owning the VElishoul&#39;s tome which was working as a spell research book. So if anyone have any information about it, i d like to know what kind of spells do u make with it (the guy was a necro), and where can u buy or find this book. <br/>
<br/>
Thanx<br/>
