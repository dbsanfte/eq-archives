<div id="ygrps-yiv-1445273533">I tend to agree. The uniqueness of each magic classes spells adds much to<br/>
the game. Taking that away would not be a good thing.<br/>
<br/>
I also agree that the ability to research other classes spells would be most<br/>
welcome. Quite honestly I originally thought that was exactly how the skill<br/>
worked. In essence, I saw it as another trade skill that would be unique to<br/>
the spell casting classes. Unfortunately that isn&#39;t really the case. It is a<br/>
trade skill only in the weakest sense. Unlike the Dwarven blacksmith who can<br/>
fashion wears for Ogre and Wood Elf alike, we are bound to limit our<br/>
knowledge to a specific realm; that of our specific class. Tis most<br/>
unfortunate.<br/>
