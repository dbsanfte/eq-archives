&gt; And I have done it with four languages that way, about one complete cycle, you teach on one side, zone, I teach, zone back takes a little over 3 mins and we only go up 2 points, you throw in interuptions, etc. and the fact some people take 50 seconds<br/>
&gt; to zone then you get 4 hours, we dont all have cable modems you know.<br/>
&gt; Not everyone zones in 15 seconds, ok.<br/>

&gt; &gt; It doesn&#39;t take 4-5 hours. When I&#39;ve done it, it&#39;s taken about an hour.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; That is true, from an initial one point in a language it takes about 4 to 5 hours depending on zone time, turn off Group chat filter that way it is easier to see improvement (you still learn with group off). Then make a plan to notify the other<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; person since they will be spaming themselves and will not see words, do a wave or jump. You want to do this after you see 2 improvements. So one person teaches on one side and the other person takes the other side.<br/>
