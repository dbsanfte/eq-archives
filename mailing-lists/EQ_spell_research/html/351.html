<div id="ygrps-yiv-1378166008">I have been a muder for 5+ years.  The greatest mud I ever played on was<br/>
Sojourn.  It is remarkably similar to this place in many ways.  It is also<br/>
different in many ways.  I have seen people (Troll Warr to be specific) jet<br/>
to 40+ level in under 2 months.. while meanwhile myself and experienced<br/>
player was on for over 20 years and only made 36th.  There are a lot of<br/>
factors in leveling and I almost guarantee he was a beta tester.<br/>

&gt;I&#39;m with Trev on this one. My favorite MUD back in 93-95 was Isenguard.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This particular mud was very VERY hard to advance in levels. The highest<br/>
characters that had been playing for a while were 16th and 17th level. if<br/>
you got to level 10 you were a really good player. level 7 was a reasonable<br/>
achievement for 6 months of play. Why do you want to have a lv 50 char?<br/>
There shouldn&#39;t be any level 40 chars for at least 2 years. The fact that I<br/>
saw a lv 42 character on Ebay for sale I think is rediculous. the fact that<br/>
someone is willing to pay thousands of dollars for such a char is even more<br/>
so. Are you one of the ones that used the trainers and hacked items in<br/>
Diablo? I don&#39;t want this game to be a flash in the pan. It should be very<br/>
hard to reach the higher levels and even harder to keep them(ie you die you<br/>
lose 3 or 4 levels) Just because you pay to play doesn&#39;t mean you should<br/>
automatically win. please try to keep in mind that some people like a<br/>
chalange and some are willing to<br/>

 </span></blockquote>and if I had already seen all there was to see then I would think I&#39;d move<br/>
on to another game. If you continue to pester Verant with things like this<br/>
they will eventually break down and everyone will have flowing black robes<br/>
and skull fanged stiletto&#39;s. I wish there were more people out there like<br/>
Trev willing to stand up for the AI and say hey this is too easy give me my<br/>
moneys worth. If fun for you is simply more power then the true meaning of<br/>
Role Playing has eluded you. may the gameing gods have mercy on your soul.<br/>

is that not what it&#39;s all about? People like you who condone such changes<br/>
that FURTHER hamper the fun, ease, and playabilty for gamers should be<br/>
forced to play Smurf warriors in Splitpaw or something. See, what retarted<br/>
petty people like you forget is WE PAY VERANT&#39;S BILLS. and thus the game<br/>
should be free of the kind of asinine restrictions that you would have<br/>
further placed upon the game. ..... We need not further restrictions but,<br/>
benefits to make it more fun,<br/>
