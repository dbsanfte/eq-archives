<div id="ygrps-yiv-256445009">I believe this is a boat bug, if you stand on the top level of the boat, you <br/>
freeze up, loose all your hotkeys, and get to start up again<br/>
on the boat, on the way back to qeynos, i was told it is two bugs kind<br/>
of working together, one crash bug one bug nixes your hotkeys<br/>
