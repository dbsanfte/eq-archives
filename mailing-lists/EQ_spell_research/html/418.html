<div id="ygrps-yiv-1087986540"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;         I think research and use of other classes spells is a good idea, as<br/>
&gt; long as there is a penalty for doing so. It would be cool if you could learn<br/>
&gt; others spells from half your level. I.E. a level 40 wizard could learn level<br/>
&gt; 20 necro spells.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not a good idea at all in my opinion I have played in the past games that allowed cross<br/>
training and such between classes makes for a bad environment -<br/>
<br/>
However allowing cross class research methinks is not a bad idea as I could research<br/>
spells for all those words and such I find and sell them to the class that can use it.<br/>
