<div id="ygrps-yiv-176368358">I don&#39;t know...my skill in conjuration is 40 methinks, and it casts about as fast as a Chaotic feedback.<br/>
If I time it EXACTLY after the enemy attack, I can get it off right as they hit again.<br/>

&gt; &gt; but being able to cast a L4 pet <br/>
&gt; &gt;  inbetween enemy attacks, get the pet to taunt the attacker and have three <br/>
&gt; &gt;  or four hits to high tail to a zone is an advantage.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; only with the absolute luckiest of luck could one ever get a pet spell off <br/>
&gt; while being attacked.  It takes almost 3 combat rounds for that spell to <br/>
&gt; go...  so you would have to either be missed all 3 times (yeah right) or make <br/>
&gt; 3 &quot;recoveries&quot; during that time (you are more likely to be struck by <br/>
&gt; lightning!!!)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Again... I agree with the others ... enough &quot;I hate my class&quot; posts please!!!<br/>
