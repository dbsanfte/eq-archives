It would be cool if you could learn <br/>\nothers spells from half your level. I.E. a level 40 wizard could learn level <br/>\n20 necro spells. Or if the spells were less effective. But &quot;jack of all <br/>\ntrades&quot; mages would be very annoying. My strengths as a magician are the only <br/>\nadvantage I have over the other mage classes. But still....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess what I&#39;m saying is cross research could be beneficial if implemented <br/>\nproperly. But simply any-mage-can-learn-any-spell policies would be <br/>\ndisasterous.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Vorteks the High Elf Magician</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
