The class that has nothing.  Give me<br/>\nan example of what we have over any class, and I will bash it into the<br/>\nground with another example that blows it away.  As to fizzles, etc...  We<br/>\nare the slowest casters in the game.  I dueled a Necromancer that had the<br/>\nsame HP as I, and we agreed to do DD spells only, in which he did 160 damage<br/>\nand I did 165.  The Necromancer won.  I have higher Magic resistance, but<br/>\nhis spells did full damage every time.  My spell did full damage once, and<br/>\nit looked to be about 4 damage the second time.  Just so you know, we dueled<br/>\nwith NO BUFFS on.  The speed of his spell was too much, as he always was<br/>\nahead of my casts.  Anyways, I&#39;m out.  Someone try to tell me a reason<br/>\nWizards are better, and I will defend my statement that we suck.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n                        - Zenon Amphitryon, 27th, Fennin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
