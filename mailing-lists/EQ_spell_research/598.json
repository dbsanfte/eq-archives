I decided to go into Crushbone and check out all<br/>\nthe high level orcs who used to train and cause me to zone at earlier<br/>\nlevels (The Prophet, Warlord, Emporer Crush, D&#39;Vinn, etc.).<br/>\nAs it was getting late, I ran to zone to leave, and a large group of<br/>\npeople there were attacking D&#39;Vinn (large being 8 to 10 people on<br/>\nhim).  I wanted to /con D&#39;Vinn, so I gave a small 38 point blast to an<br/>\norc pawn in the way, and I did /con on D&#39;Vinn, he was yellow.  I then<br/>\nproceded to zone, without attacking D&#39;Vinn.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter zoning, I received multiple tells from people berating me for stealing<br/>\nD&#39;Vinn.  Shouts then came in the Greater Faydark zone on how I had<br/>\nbeen kill stealing.  I tried to explain to people giving me tells that it was<br/>\nnot me and I even had them scroll back in the text window and look,<br/>\nbut at that point the damage was done.  The next day I was in Unrest<br/>\nand again received a shout saying I was a kill stealer.  I explained to the<br/>\nperson that it was not me, and they finally did shout an apology.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe moral of the story is, if you are going to shout about people being<br/>\nkill stealers, please witness the kill steal first hand and do not believe what<br/>\neveryone tells you.  I found out later that someone who was attacking<br/>\nhim (probably the one who actually killed him), said I was the one who<br/>\nkilled him and that I had looted the body.  Everyone there believed him<br/>\nand no one spoke up about it being wrong (someone had to have seen<br/>\nwho actually did it).<br/>\n<br/>\n                                                Just something to think about,<br/>\n<br/>\n                                                                Soren<br/>\n                                                                20th Level Wizard<br/>\n                                                                The Rathe Server<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Vincent, Chih Yuan, Goh&quot; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Vincent, Chih Yuan, Goh&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wacs@...\">wacs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We need people like this in Everquest, since he is &#39;notorious&#39; already on<br/>\n&gt; your server, why not let him remain that way? Cause when people see him on<br/>\n&gt; /who, they will prob shout that this steal killer is on and try to group up<br/>\n&gt; in an effort to stop this, which if you look in alternate perspective, kinda<br/>\n&gt; produces a quest.  A kinda &#39;quest&#39; to stop steal killers might prove much<br/>\n&gt; more interesting for many players rather than take up an EQ quest, which to<br/>\n&gt; some is most boring. So with a steal killer&#39;s reputation building up, guess<br/>\n&gt; who would be the top on PKs list when the PK seasons begin?
