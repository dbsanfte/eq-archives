I have seen that<br/>\n&gt; enchanter pages are nearly imposible to sell as enchanters are nowere to<br/>\n&gt; find eheh. anyone knows what is percentual diference in number of<br/>\n&gt; enchanters against number of orher classes in game ?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ack, I&#39;ve been hoping to find a page ANYWHERE (granted we&#39;re probably on<br/>\ndifferent servers, I&#39;m on Veeshan) and no one seems to have them, or i get<br/>\n&#39;oh sorry, i just sold the one i found to a vendor&#39; ..<br/>\n<br/>\nWhenever I do manage to find a page or find someone who has one and is<br/>\nwanting to sell it, it&#39;s ALWAYS pages 23, 24, 26, or 30 of the grimiore. I<br/>\nhavent even seen a page from velishoul&#39;s since I was level 16 and found a<br/>\nfew myself. And everytime I&#39;m in a group AND if someone happens to find a<br/>\npage on a loot, then they always have some friend that they give them too.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far I&#39;ve gotten the spells from 23, 24, 26, 30, and 312. I have parts to<br/>\n390 and 375, but cant find other stuff. Getting a little annoyed that i cant<br/>\nfind pages but i see those damn Words all over .. I&#39;m currently level 22 and<br/>\nwould like to have the spells for level 24 (my next spell level) on hand, or<br/>\nin the very least find somthing interesting to try and reasearch.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
