I looted the body and found &quot;Top part of a rune&quot;.  The item<br/>\nis a lore item which is also &quot;no drop&quot; (it can not be traded, dropped,<br/>\nor sold).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe continued fighting there the rest of the night and killed another<br/>\nevil eye.  This one had &quot;Middle part of a rune&quot;.  This is also a lore<br/>\nitem but is not listed as &quot;no drop&quot;, so the group gave this part to me<br/>\nalso.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have also heard these pieces have been found in South Karanas.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I am assuming there is also a &quot;Bottom part of a rune&quot;, but does<br/>\nanyone know what these are for?  Is it a quest somewhere to assemble<br/>\nthis rune?
