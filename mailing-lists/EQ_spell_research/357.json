Height<br/>\n&gt; makes no difference to mobs. Here&#39;s a first hand example. I was playing my<br/>\n&gt; troll and between the entrance to GUK and South Ro there&#39;s a small tower.<br/>\n&gt; Inside the tower there&#39;s a ladder that leads up to the battlements. Now, a<br/>\n&gt; zombie on the TOP of the tower, was hitting me standing at the<br/>\n&gt; BOTTOM of the<br/>\n&gt; tower in the entranceway. Seems to me this is about as unfair as<br/>\n&gt; being able<br/>\n&gt; to walk through walls and take swipes at players sitting there medding<br/>\n&gt; peacefully. : ) However, I can see the need for this.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The other reason Verant couldn&#39;t claim that a &#39; Fly n&#39; Fry &#39; tactic was an<br/>\n&gt; expoit would be because it&#39;s effectively the same as a root<br/>\n&gt; spell. They both<br/>\n&gt; have durations. They both can wear off, so it&#39;s not a guaranteed thing. Of<br/>\n&gt; course, this is all my opinion but I don&#39;t see it any other way.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Zalbar<br/>\n&gt; 18th Wizard<br/>\n&gt; Solusek Ro<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  where real people with real interests get connected.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Join a new list today!<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; This list is intended for the trade of Spell components for spell<br/>\n&gt; research.
