If they speak at a skill level of 5, then that&#39;s all<br/>\nyou&#39;ll get out of it.  I believe a lot of mages are now doing a &quot;ladder<br/>\ntechnique&quot;.  Basically one mage blows all his training points in Old Erudin,<br/>\nthen jabbers at the other mage till he reaches the same level, then THAT<br/>\nmage uses all his training points in Old Erudin to increase it even more<br/>\nthen jabber back so now its like they&#39;ve both put twice their training<br/>\npoints in.  After that you&#39;ve got a marketable language that you can &quot;sell&quot;<br/>\nfor other languages.  Offer to jabber in Old Erudin for that High Elf while<br/>\nhe jabbers back in Elder Elvish while that Dwarf jabbers in Dwarven or<br/>\nwhatever.  I used to think it was quite horrid to have to spend points to<br/>\ntrain in SO many languages, but now I realize that this is actually pretty<br/>\ncool because they&#39;ve made languages hard to learn in a way.  You won&#39;t have<br/>\neveryone under the sun knowing 14 languages, only those that dedicate a<br/>\nlarge amount of time to it (and considering the real world, rightly so).<br/>\n<br/>\nMalark on Karana<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Craig Joyner [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:qrentqent@...\">qrentqent@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, May 10, 1999 9:10 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_spell_research@onelist.com\">EQ_spell_research@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [EQ_spell_research] learning languages/putting things in<br/>\n&gt; research books<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Craig Joyner&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:qrentqent@...\">qrentqent@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hallo,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Just some infobits to clarify some things,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1. You do not need to train in a language to learn it, you <br/>\n&gt; can learn it by <br/>\n&gt; hearing somebody who is excellent in the language speak it. <br/>\n&gt; If you are ever <br/>\n&gt; riding the boat start up a language class and get all aboard who will <br/>\n&gt; cooperate to speak in their native tongues. After getting off <br/>\n&gt; my first boat <br/>\n&gt; trip I could, barely, speak some Dwarf, and I am a Gnome and <br/>\n&gt; had never <br/>\n&gt; trained in any langauge with my Guildmaster. Where we&#39;ll get <br/>\n&gt; to hear Dragon <br/>\n&gt; or Elder Dragon is beyond me, but I do know the Gypsies that <br/>\n&gt; sell Combine <br/>\n&gt; weapons are related to the historic Combine Empire, perhaps <br/>\n&gt; hanging out by <br/>\n&gt; Gypsies and listening to them talk to people will give us <br/>\n&gt; Combine... just an <br/>\n&gt; idea for somebody to try out. From what I understand you can <br/>\n&gt; only learn a <br/>\n&gt; language from hearing from somebody who is excellent in it, <br/>\n&gt; but I could be <br/>\n&gt; wrong about that, however I have not been able to get my two fellow <br/>\n&gt; Enchanters I travel with(my main character is a Gnome <br/>\n&gt; Enchanter)to learn any <br/>\n&gt; Dwarf from speaking in it even though I learned it from <br/>\n&gt; hearing it spoken, <br/>\n&gt; albeit from a native speaker who is excellent in Dwarf.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 2. As far as combining things in the books, do not put <br/>\n&gt; anything into the <br/>\n&gt; books other than what the recipe called for and do not use summoned <br/>\n&gt; water/items in creating the spell or it won&#39;t work. Quills <br/>\n&gt; and Scrolls <br/>\n&gt; apparently have no use that people can figure out, probably confusing <br/>\n&gt; remnants from the Beta just like the Age of Restoration book <br/>\n&gt; that was pulled <br/>\n&gt; after the last patch due to it being useless.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Good Luck,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; qq<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; _______________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Get Free Email and Do More On The Web.
