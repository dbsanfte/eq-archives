For those who didnt understand of what i m talking about...we have four language research to know: Old Erudian, Elder Teir&#39;Dal aka Kobolt language; Dragon and Combine language. So what i m doing is quite simple: i gather 10 necros including me:<br/>\n- necro1 is going to learn 10 points of Kobolt for example and learn this 10 points to the whoel group<br/>\n-necro 2 who has already 10 points go to train 10 points in the guild and learn his knowledge to the group<br/>\n- on an so on<br/>\n-necro 10 who has 90 in kobolt language go to learn blah blah. Then after this long process everyone is knowing the kobolt language perfectly.<br/>\n<br/>\nPositive: You meet a lot of people that can become friends...plus they all from the same class so it can helps for further advices.<br/>\n            You can translate the necro book for only 10 points training skill<br/>\n<br/>\nNegative: Hard to gather so many ppl =0<br/>\n              Long process<br/>\n<br/>\nCya all on Rathe Server<br/>\n<br/>\nMuad Amenoire (Necro Level 23)<br/>\n<br/>\nN.B: a necro jsut let me known that a group of 6 bnecros including her killed a Sand Giant in Oasis. 2 Levels 17, 1 Level 18 and 3 levels 20...Amazing huh? heh NEcros are really powerfull. i dont have any doubt anymore =)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
