You will be KOS (Killed on<br/>\nSight) regardless of what illusion you have on. If you have ANY plans of<br/>\njewelry making, then dont do it. Sure you can pay someone to go get it, but<br/>\ni&#39;d rather i did it myself to save me the trouble of finding someone willing<br/>\nto do it, someone who is honest if they want you to give them the money (i<br/>\ngave the money to one person and never heard from them again), and plus<br/>\nwould just like to be able to quickly get in, get it, and get out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought that i could kill like 5 or 6 guards and still be safe...nope.<br/>\nMade myself look like a Dark Elf to go in and get Enchant Electrum, killed<br/>\nsoon as i hit the bridge with the guards. do yourself a favor and dont kill<br/>\nthe DE guards.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
