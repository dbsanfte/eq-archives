I&#39;d hate to thing that all the little bugs in the game right now, were all real.  I&#39;m sure now that they are all made up and that Verant would not program the game to have bugs in it.  Thank you so much for your well thought out response.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn case you&#39;re wondering...   It DID happen.  Logging back in seemed to affect the skill.  I have also heard that putting one skill point into it would knock it out of its stasis and allow it to continuously improve again.  I know that its not supposed to work that way...   but thats how it is.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kalekona@...\">kalekona@...</a>[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kalekona@...\">kalekona@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_spell_research@onelist.com\">EQ_spell_research@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: \tThursday, May 13, 1999 1:50 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_spell_research@onelist.com\">EQ_spell_research@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: \tRe: [EQ_spell_research] neglected melee skills..<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kalekona@...\">kalekona@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; That cannot be the case.
