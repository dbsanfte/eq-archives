Here are my rants. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I am a 20th level enchanter and I solo all the time,  I simply use my pet<br/>\nand whirl the creatures with no problem.  I have been soloing since level<br/>\n8th.  Granted level 15th and 19th were hard with only a 12th and 16th level<br/>\npet, but I made it.  I do believe that groups will appreciate you more once<br/>\nyou get the whirl till you hurl spell.  I have people swear to me that they<br/>\nwould rather fight with a enchanter vs wizard anyday due to the fact that<br/>\nthey can whirl and have a pet.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;1. we don&#39;t get enought buff or debuff that only WE have. Why do other<br/>\n </span></blockquote>classes get beserker str? Thats unbeknownst to me. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou are incorrect Ber. Str is available to enchanters as a 20th level<br/>\nresearch spell.  I confirmed this with a 30th level enchanter.  (I came<br/>\nacross a spell list that had the spell and couldn&#39;t find it anywhere, I<br/>\nthen decided to ask the 30th level enchanter if they had it, they did, they<br/>\nresearched it).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;2. Ok, i can understand perhaps them resisting our offensive dmg spells<br/>\n </span></blockquote>but how are we supposed to be a group debuffer if they resist all &gt;our<br/>\nspells? Even after using tashan or tashanii which also have a tendency to<br/>\nget resisted? Kinda makes us useless in that regard eh?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Just a few things im kinda irked about...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Fondain De&#39;Illusion, Master Enchanter of the Amber Knights, Tarew Mar<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I honestly believe all mage classes have this problem of monsters resisting<br/>\nspells.  I was fighting a DW Croc yesterday at full health and full mana.<br/>\nI almost died.  I lost my pet (20th level) and had 3 resisted sanity warped<br/>\nspells (92 points of damage currently) and 5 resisted whirl till you hurl.<br/>\nI had to rely on a kind necro for the help to kill it in the end.  BTW the<br/>\nDW Croc was blue to me, I rarely ever cast a tashen spell.  I find that I&#39;m<br/>\njust as sucessful with it as without it.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo not sell yourself short.  Enchanters are amoung one of the most powerful<br/>\nclasses out there, on the otherhand also one of the most difficult to play.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my 2 coppers worth for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo all out there, this might of been a tad bit off topic. But I did mention<br/>\nthe research part about bersker Str.  8)  <br/>\n<br/>\nSafe journey to all and Good Luck.<br/>\n<br/>\nKahlan 20th Level Enchanter (High Elf)<br/>\nMaster Enchanter of Clan MacLear<br/>\nXegony Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
