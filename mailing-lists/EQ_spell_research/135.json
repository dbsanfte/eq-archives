As for the books written in Elder Elvish, Combine, and Dragon, those are quest books that can&#39;t be bought from the merchants, but rather found through quests  ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, so far as I&#39;ve been able to determine, Wizards only use Runes for their research.<br/>\n<br/>\nTalarin Kal&#39;Amon, High Elven Wizard<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Jean Astie <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_spell_research@onelist.com\">EQ_spell_research@onelist.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, May 11, 1999 5:49 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [EQ_spell_research] Languages<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Ken,<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I know the Wizard&#39;s Canon (I guess some are calling this the first book...) is Old Erudian.  Is the Doctrine of Wizardry written in Elder Elvish or Tier&#39;Dal?   I&#39;ve heard there are four books yet you list 5 languages that you know or are working on.  Are there more than four books?  I really wish you were on my server. I&#39;d happily pay 5 plat to learn those languages.  Also, do wizards need ONLY runes?  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Can anyone on the Karana server teach me other languages?  I&#39;ll pay/trade for them... (I already know Old Erudian to excellent.  I also have several non-rune reseach components I would gladly trade providing I dont need them myself.) </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
