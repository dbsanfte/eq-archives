I am not <br/>\neven sure where you got some of the information you have.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAt 20, my tap spell does 67.  The same level wizard is doing 150.  Casting <br/>\nthe same spell FASTER... and the same amount of times I can cast the tap.  <br/>\nNow yes, I get healed, and almost never do less than 67 (I have seen it do <br/>\nless, but very rarely) but that is not as much damage as the wizzard spell.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease supply more concrete information with your mails.<br/>\n<br/>\nSonoroud Tomebinder</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
