Now the only question<br/>\nis do I sell them or hang on to them in hopes that they will put the 24th<br/>\nlevel Charm spell back in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nI ended up selling that non stacking words of  Dominion.  It was annoying<br/>\nme and sold for the same as the Stacking words of Dominion.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll pop off an identify spell on the faded page when I am in game next.<br/>\nIf that dosen&#39;t work I&#39;ll just give it to one of the enchanters in my guild<br/>\nand let them worry abou it.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain thanks for the help.<br/>\n<br/>\nLomack, Knight Defender of the BCK<br/>\nMaster of Recruiting<br/>\nwww.bck.org<br/>\n&quot;The Crimson Knights&quot;<br/>\nFennin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
