Give me a break.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  Give me<br/>\n&gt; an example of what we have over any class, and I will bash it into the<br/>\n&gt; ground with another example that blows it away.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Direct Damage.  Necros get ONE...at 24...at maxes out at 160 damage...yours at that level is at least 173. (I love my necro, but to say they have stronger DD is idiotic.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  As to fizzles, etc...  We<br/>\n&gt; are the slowest casters in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Necromancers damage spells are the LONGEST casting...don&#39;t give me that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  I dueled a Necromancer that had the<br/>\n&gt; same HP as I, and we agreed to do DD spells only, in which he did 160 damage<br/>\n&gt; and I did 165.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Then you were not useing the right spells.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  The Necromancer won.  I have higher Magic resistance, but<br/>\n&gt; his spells did full damage every time.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The only spell we have that does full damage everytime is our Drain spell.

The speed of his spell was too much, as he always was<br/>\n&gt; ahead of my casts.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That just means he started casting before you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  Anyways, I&#39;m out.  Someone try to tell me a reason<br/>\n&gt; Wizards are better, and I will defend my statement that we suck.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;                         - Zenon Amphitryon, 27th, Fennin Ro<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Root at level what 8? Necromancer get a pet...but mobs tend to frenzy past our pet...We dont&#39; get root till 34.<br/>\n<br/>\nDamage that can do 1100? Sure maybe not till you get to the top of your class, but it is there.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe most we can do I believe..(Same level) 400. Big difference.<br/>\n<br/>\nTravel?  I think this explains it all.....saves much time walking back to your corpse in S Karana because you forgot that you bound yourself in Najena the night before.<br/>\n<br/>\nKalekona Keali&#39;i 30th level Necromancer Bertoxxulous server.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
