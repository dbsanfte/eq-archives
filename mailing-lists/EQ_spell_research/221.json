The first issue I will discuss is Languages.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As far as I have ever seen, I have never bot a skill raised from speaking the <br/>\n&gt; native tounge to an NPC.  I have found that no matter what language I &#92;&#39;hail&#92;&#39; <br/>\n&gt; them in they always respond in Common.  I think this because I understand <br/>\n&gt; everything that they say, if it was a language that I am awful in wouldn&#92;&#39;t I<br/>\n&gt; not <br/>\n&gt; understand??  Also wouldn&#92;&#39;t this become an exploit?? Imaging all of us wizards <br/>\n&gt; in the store by the bank in Felwithe, just saying &#92;&#39;Hail&#92;&#39; over and over again<br/>\n&gt; in <br/>\n&gt; say Elder Elvish, to get the NPC to spam us.  Would drive everyone nuts, and <br/>\n&gt; probably crash the zone.  So I am unsure as to if listening to an NPC would <br/>\n&gt; really work.  Also has anyone actually seen the &#92;&#39;your language skill increase&#92;&#39;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; after spaming the NPC and the whole zone for that matter.  I am very good at <br/>\n&gt; languages and have in my time learned Old Erudian, Elder Elvish, Elvish, Tier <br/>\n&gt; Dal, Barbarian, Halfling, Dwarvish, and Gnoll.  Never once have I got a increase<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; from a NPC.  Please clarify this issue for me please, would love to learn more <br/>\n&gt; and faster of course.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Now there seems to be some questions here on the skills of melee.  I don&#92;&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; claim <br/>\n&gt; to know the calculations, but I know how to max them all.  I started with the <br/>\n&gt; dagger of course, got it up to 22 or so, then got my hand to hand up to about 18<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; for the heck of it.  I then got staffs, first a one handed that is up to about <br/>\n&gt; 25 or so, this was my travel, backup weapon which was lost when a skeleton took <br/>\n&gt; a dislike to me in lesserfaydarke (was bound to qeynos) Now my main stay weapon <br/>\n&gt; is a 2h staff.  I have that skill up to about 38 right now.  I got a giant snake<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; fang the other day fighting in Paw.  Before that I had decided to increase my <br/>\n&gt; piercing and had a summonded dagger.  It took well over 45min and aobut 300 <br/>\n&gt; melee swings of the peircing weapon before I saw a single advancement, then it <br/>\n&gt; flew up to 31 or so.  For ahwile I though maybe it was never going to raise but <br/>\n&gt; my perseverance paid off and it did, so I am going to try and max my pierce, <br/>\n&gt; find a 1h blunt and max that.  Then go back to my favorite 2h staff.  So all it <br/>\n&gt; takes for you skills is patience.  Yes if you haven&#92;&#39;t used it in a great time<br/>\n&gt; it <br/>\n&gt; takes alot of use before you start to see skill in it again, kind of like skiing<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; or biking, hehe.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; May our Paths Cross<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Zakrul The Traveler<br/>\n&gt; Companion<br/>\n&gt; Wizard<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; This mail sent through IMP: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://web.horde.org/imp/\">http://web.horde.org/imp/</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Congratulations to &quot;Trail Rider,&quot; our latest ONElist of the Week.  <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Visit our homepage and share with us how ONElist is changing YOUR life!<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; This list is intended for the trade of Spell components for spell research.
