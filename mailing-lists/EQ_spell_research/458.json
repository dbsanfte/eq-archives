I seem to find more words than anything else.<br/>\n&gt; This is good for me since I am a Necromancer.  I have found most of them on<br/>\n&gt; DW crocs and DW Caimans in Oasis.  I have also found words and Runes on<br/>\n&gt; Lavacrawlers in Lavastorm.  There is no certain place where they are found,<br/>\n&gt; I think all upper level monsters drop them from time to time.  I have a<br/>\n&gt; Druid friend who has found words, runes, and grimoire pages on Griffawns and<br/>\n&gt; Griffennes in the Karanas.  I think I covered everything I wanted to.  If<br/>\n&gt; there are any high level monks that know the basics of Dragon on<br/>\n&gt; Bristlebain, or anyone else who knows it, give me a tell in-game if you do<br/>\n&gt; not mind spamming me for a couple minutes to teach me the basice.
