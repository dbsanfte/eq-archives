It is missing two pages which a NPC named Ran (Librarian in High Hold) supposedly stole.  It appears that if these two pages are acquired and combined in the Testament that you will get a working copy of the Testament of Vanear.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI was wondering if this was a book for research, or it had another purpose.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
