You use LifeDrains.  I think<br/>\nthere&#39;s also a reason why they aren&#39;t resisted at all too, but for the life<br/>\nof me I can&#39;t remember the reason.  Necromancer DoT spells get resisted an<br/>\nabsurd amount by higher level monsters just like any other spellcasters<br/>\nspells.  What that group did was sic all their pets on the Sand Giants while<br/>\nusing Dark Pact and Allure of Death, then sat there and LifeDrained it.  The<br/>\nSand Giant couldn&#39;t get through the pile of skeleton pets fast enough.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tOne of our guildmembers and several other 20+ level necromancers<br/>\nrepeated the tactic on a griffin on the Karana Server last night.  One died<br/>\nbut they killed the griffin, so it isn&#39;t so simple.  I believe a couple of<br/>\nthe sand giant party died as well.  Its not boring at all because of the<br/>\ndanger involved, especially coordinating the effect.  They repeated the<br/>\ntactic again on an HG and half the team died due to poor coordination (and<br/>\nprobably the higher level of the monster and it may have gotten several<br/>\nlucky hits in too or something, too many variables) and they were forced to<br/>\nFEIGN or run.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tCheap?  I don&#39;t think so.  Are you saying six level 20 characters<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t take down a level 40 character?  Is that why I&#39;m level 18 and I can<br/>\nstill get killed by four or five gnoll GUARDS if my pet is only occupying<br/>\none of them?  Then of course there&#39;s the one to two bubble loss of XP from<br/>\nbeing killed by a monster MANY levels below you.  If you want to complain<br/>\nabout something, talk about the XP penalties of dying to a blue or green<br/>\ncreature.<br/>\n<br/>\nMalark on Karana<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Lute Lewis [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pbastard@...\">pbastard@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, May 18, 1999 7:37 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_spell_research@onelist.com\">EQ_spell_research@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EQ_spell_research] BEWARE OF HAPPY99.exe<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Lute Lewis&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pbastard@...\">pbastard@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;I jsut hope his guy isnt an EQ player...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I fail to see why you would hope he isn&#39;t an EQ player. Not <br/>\n&gt; too many people<br/>\n&gt; will sign up to this list and not play EQ anyway.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;N.B: a necro jsut let me known that a group of 6 bnecros <br/>\n&gt; including her<br/>\n&gt; killed a &gt;Sand Giant in Oasis. 2 Levels 17, 1 Level 18 and 3 levels<br/>\n&gt; 20...Amazing huh? heh &gt;NEcros are really powerfull. i dont <br/>\n&gt; have any doubt<br/>\n&gt; anymore =)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Necros can do this because it is a cheap tactic using DOT spells. Not<br/>\n&gt; amazing, just the fact that your spells aren&#39;t resisted. All <br/>\n&gt; of my necro<br/>\n&gt; friends, higher than those you mentioned, don&#39;t do this <br/>\n&gt; because it&#39;s cheap,<br/>\n&gt; boring (it takes forever to kill a level 30+ monster at low <br/>\n&gt; level), and they<br/>\n&gt; know they really aren&#39;t getting the kill so it&#39;s no <br/>\n&gt; satisfaction for them.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;     I read today that you can&#39;t get level 24+ Magician pets <br/>\n&gt; until they fix<br/>\n&gt; it. The fix will be either the research involved in getting <br/>\n&gt; these pets, or<br/>\n&gt; adding shops that will just sell them. I&#39;d imagine they would <br/>\n&gt; add shops<br/>\n&gt; since the 24 pets are documented in spell lists not as &quot;Mist <br/>\n&gt; Elemental&quot; and<br/>\n&gt; what not, but who knows. I have spent 3 levels in South <br/>\n&gt; Karana trying to get<br/>\n&gt; aviak feathers, so it&#39;s safe to say your chances of getting <br/>\n&gt; them there are<br/>\n&gt; slim. I also read about a vendor in a locked hut and a <br/>\n&gt; Minotaur vendor in<br/>\n&gt; south karana, supposedly mage releated.
