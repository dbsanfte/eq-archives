I say<br/>\nGood job.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those of you out there that are thinking that Necro&#39;s<br/>\nare too powerful? Our spells take a full second more (At<br/>\nLEAST) to cast than all the other classes....that is one<br/>\naspect that has not been explored.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur pets are not as strong as a Magicians either.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen fighting a magician sends in the pet...and blasts away<br/>\nfrom behind.<br/>\nWe Necro&#39;s must go in and take some hits....then use our<br/>\ndrains to heal while the pet get demolished.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hate it when one player says...&quot;My class is too<br/>\nweak....look at that class....they are too strong.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you think so...play that class...make a educated<br/>\ndecision.<br/>\n<br/>\nI personally think that all the classes I have played have<br/>\nbeen VERY WELL balanced.<br/>\nThe Enchanter has had a rough start and is still strugling,<br/>\nbut that is a fault of Verant not having completed thier<br/>\nskills. (Ahem....you weren&#39;t the only ones...Rogue&#39;s too<br/>\nwere givin the short end of the stick.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI personally LOVE an enchanter in my group...if you have<br/>\never grouped with one you know the joys of having your<br/>\nmonster turned into a much weaker...much smaller...much<br/>\nslower version of itself.  Enchanters are NOT cannon<br/>\nmages...and they are not supposed to be.  They can Debuff<br/>\nand buff better than anyone.  So what if others get those<br/>\nspells at higher levels....If you group...they will gladly<br/>\nleave you your specialty so that they can cast MORE<br/>\ndrains...and less of the others.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnchanters CAN solo also...albiet not very well.<br/>\nThey have thier pets now.<br/>\nVerant is working on them.<br/>\nGive them time.<br/>\nThe Enchanter you make fun of now will come back to kick<br/>\nyour arse in later levels.<br/>\n(Personal Experience)<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry for this rant but it had to be said.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
