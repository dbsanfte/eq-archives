Is this","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-346232717\">I have some questions about some words if any of you know the answers.<br/>\n<br/>\n1.  I have about 7 words of Dominion but one of them won&#39;t stack with the<br/>\nrest?  Is this bug from a word from before the stacking patch or is there<br/>\nsome other use for a non stacking word?<br/>\n<br/>\n2. I have Words of Pacification and Words of Derivation.  Can someone tell<br/>\nme what spells these are for?  I looked all over a few sites that have<br/>\nresearch info and couldn&#39;t find either of these words listed.<br/>\n<br/>\n3.  I have a Velishouls Tome Faded Page but it dosen&#39;t have a page number<br/>\nassociated with it.  I noticed on the lists that there are 2 versions of<br/>\nFaded pages for Velishouls Tome.  One a page 16 and one a page 108.  Does<br/>\nanyone know which version of the Faded page I have if it has no page number?<br/>\n<br/>\n4.  I have Words of the Sentient but there appear to be two different types<br/>\none says &quot;A.... the other B....   (I put dots in to signifify that I can&#39;t<br/>\nremember the rest of the word.  But these A and B words are in parenthesies<br/>\nafter the name of the Page.  Any clue what each is for?  I know Words of<br/>\nthe Sentient are used for the Necro spell Restless Bones and Intensify<br/>\nDeath.  I assume one type is for each spell.  Can someone tell me which is<br/>\nwhich?<br/>\n<br/>\nIts amazing the stuff you find when you start sorting all your junk in the<br/>\nbank :)<br/>\n<br/>\nLomack, Knight Defender of the BCK<br/>\nMaster of Recruiting<br/>\nwww.bck.org<br/>\n&quot;The Crimson Knights&quot;<br/>\nFennin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
