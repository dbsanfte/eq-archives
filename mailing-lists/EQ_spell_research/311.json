Unfortunatly after putting the<br/>\ncorrect runes(29th take 3 runes) and combining they did not combine to<br/>\nproduce anything . so i am assuming that 29th spells need a 4th<br/>\ncomponent, the book did not mention anything else so i am clueless as to<br/>\nwhat else is needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone can shed some light as to wether something else is needed<br/>\nafter 29th , i would appreciate it.<br/>\nAlso i am quiet puzzled by runes wich do not appear in any of the 4<br/>\nbooks. Guess there must be more books out there,maybe quest rewards?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW i am on solusek Ro server and have lots of words and pages (more<br/>\nthan 30) that i would be willing to trade for runes, or exchange them<br/>\nfor learning book languages.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBull</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
