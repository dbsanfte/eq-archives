Or more to the point, how do you<br/>\n&gt;  MAKE them?  After spending a ridiculous amount of time and money searching<br/>\n&gt;  for the answer and experimenting with combinations that don&#39;t work, neither<br/>\n&gt;  I nor any guild member have been able to figure out how to tailor a<br/>\n&gt;  Backpack.  If I read into your message correctly, the tailored backpacks<br/>\n&gt;  have 10 slots instead of the standard 8?  That answers the long-asked<br/>\n&gt;  question of why backpack patterns are more expensive than backpacks.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  I realize this is a bit off-topic, but I have seen mention of handmade<br/>\n&gt;  backpacks NOWHERE else.  And no one else seems to have a clue.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Handmade backpacks are..<br/>\nHigh Quality Bearskin, Backpack patern, in a LARGE sewing kit.  You need a <br/>\nskill of maybee 35 to do it with good success.  (I have someone with a 27 who <br/>\nhas made about 4 out of 10 pelts...)<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck finding the HQ bearskins.  I have been looking for them for 3 weeks <br/>\nwith little luck.  Slaughtering no learning bears, young kodiaks and Kodiaks. <br/>\n got 1 in all that time.<br/>\n<br/>\nSonoroud tomebinder.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
