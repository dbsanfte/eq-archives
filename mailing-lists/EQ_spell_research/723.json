I have about 7 words of Dominion but one of them won&#39;t stack with<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; rest?  Is this bug from a word from before the stacking patch or is<br/>\n&gt; there<br/>\n&gt; some other use for a non stacking word?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes this is a leftover bug from the stacking patch.  However, check to see<br/>\nif the non-stacking word would sell for more at the vendor then the<br/>\nothers.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 2. I have Words of Pacification and Words of Derivation.  Can someone<br/>\n&gt; tell<br/>\n&gt; me what spells these are for?  I looked all over a few sites that have<br/>\n&gt; research info and couldn&#39;t find either of these words listed.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Words of Pacification is a necro research word [ source:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mythiran.everquest.gamestats.com/\">http://mythiran.everquest.gamestats.com/</a> ] I don&#39;t know about the<br/>\nDerivation one though (I have it too).<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 3.  I have a Velishouls Tome Faded Page but it dosen&#39;t have a page<br/>\n&gt; number<br/>\n&gt; associated with it.  I noticed on the lists that there are 2 versions of<br/>\n&gt; Faded pages for Velishouls Tome.  One a page 16 and one a page 108. <br/>\n&gt; Does<br/>\n&gt; anyone know which version of the Faded page I have if it has no page<br/>\n&gt; number?<br/>\n <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Try casting identify on the page - perhaps that will help.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 4.  I have Words of the Sentient but there appear to be two different<br/>\n&gt; types<br/>\n&gt; one says &quot;A.... the other B....   (I put dots in to signifify that I<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; remember the rest of the word.  But these A and B words are in<br/>\n&gt; parenthesies<br/>\n&gt; after the name of the Page.  Any clue what each is for?  I know Words of<br/>\n&gt; the Sentient are used for the Necro spell Restless Bones and Intensify<br/>\n&gt; Death.  I assume one type is for each spell.  Can someone tell me which<br/>\n&gt; is<br/>\n&gt; which?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Restless Bones uses the Azia word and Intesify Death uses the B... word.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Its amazing the stuff you find when you start sorting all your junk in<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; bank :)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hehe - yes I know the feeling - I still have a lot of old lore items that<br/>\nare now no-drop in the bank that I haven&#39;t removed since I don&#39;t want to<br/>\ncarry them around with me.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuasinom de Plume<br/>\n{Mith Marr server}<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nBid and sell for free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://auctions.yahoo.com\">http://auctions.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
