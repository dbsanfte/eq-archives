That being<br/>\nthe case, If we specialize in a certain area such as conjuration, will we<br/>\nget new spells such as summon food and water, etc.  If they decide to let us<br/>\nhave hybrid spells from other races, it seems to me like they should limit<br/>\nthe spells the wizard gets depending on which area of specialization he is<br/>\nin.  If I wated to get SoW for example, I would have to train in the<br/>\nspecialization spell trait that is used when SoW is cast (alteration,<br/>\ndivination, etc.). This would allow us to get hybrid spells without making<br/>\nus too powerful, and allow the wizard player to be able to be a more well<br/>\nrounded profession rather than being so dependant on others to buff and<br/>\ngroup with.  I don&#39;t know about you, but there are times when I am playing<br/>\nand no one is online who wants to group with me.  This can be frustrating<br/>\ncause we are not good at melee.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my two cents worth.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
