He was level 19, made 20. durring that<br/>\ntime his pet never once cast a spell<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;- New enchanter whirl spell (check the vendors)<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;Does anyone know what level this is for?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The big problem for Enchanters came about when a level 45 Enchanter and a<br/>\ncleric (not sure of cleric level, but probably around 40ish also) got<br/>\ntogether and was taking on stuff they shouldnt have been able to take from<br/>\nusng whirl, a pet, and heal. The enchanter was able to cast whirl about 60<br/>\ntimes (at his level the mana use was extremely negligable) one a creature<br/>\nthat had over 1600 hp and could take it out. The cleric just kept healing<br/>\nthe pet and or enchanter. Verrant moved to put a stop to this buy nerfing<br/>\nthe whirl so that they could not do this. If i am correct, whirl till you<br/>\nhurl does NOT effect monsters over level 30, and the new whirl is needed<br/>\n(which is a level 29 spell).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;- AC added to the Rune Series (Enchanter)<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;Don&#39;t have it yet but at least it isn&#39;t a downgrade.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Great, but unfortunatly bugged. You cannot cast the rune spell if you have<br/>\nanother ac bearing spell in place (like mist or clerical holy armor)<br/>\nalthough casting rune will still result in the loss of the Cat&#39;s Eye Agate.<br/>\nsuprised they missed this obvious bug, but look for it to be corrected.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd one last thing that was NOT mentioned and i think many of you will find<br/>\nvery nice. A new spell has been added to the Enchanter spell line. It is<br/>\nlevel 29 spell that increases GROUP mana regeneration by 50%.
