It is said that to read the text of these ancient spell casters you must learn Old Erudian for the forefathers of Erudians and Elder Tier Dal for the forefathers of todays Dark Elves.  I know that Tier Dal shows up as Dark Elvish when changing languages, I also learned in my travels that Elder Tier Dal shows up a Lizardman.  Using my higher inteligence I have concluded that Necromancers would probably find it very usefull to learn Elder Tier Dal as I would find it usefull to learn Old Erudian.  Now if anyone knows how I can learn Elder Dragon, the harsh complex language of magic itself please let me know.  I would very interested in learning that language or Combine for that matter. <br/>\n  May our paths cross <br/>\n<br/>\n  Zakrul The Traveler <br/>\n  Companion <br/>\n  Wizard <br/>\n  Britstlebane Server </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
