Height<br/>\nmakes no difference to mobs. Here&#39;s a first hand example. I was playing my<br/>\ntroll and between the entrance to GUK and South Ro there&#39;s a small tower.<br/>\nInside the tower there&#39;s a ladder that leads up to the battlements. Now, a<br/>\nzombie on the TOP of the tower, was hitting me standing at the BOTTOM of the<br/>\ntower in the entranceway. Seems to me this is about as unfair as being able<br/>\nto walk through walls and take swipes at players sitting there medding<br/>\npeacefully. : ) However, I can see the need for this.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other reason Verant couldn&#39;t claim that a &#39; Fly n&#39; Fry &#39; tactic was an<br/>\nexpoit would be because it&#39;s effectively the same as a root spell. They both<br/>\nhave durations. They both can wear off, so it&#39;s not a guaranteed thing. Of<br/>\ncourse, this is all my opinion but I don&#39;t see it any other way.<br/>\n<br/>\nZalbar<br/>\n18th Wizard<br/>\nSolusek Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
