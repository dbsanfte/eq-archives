Both of these are level 30+ monsters. Accordingly I wouldn&#39;t think a level 18-20 group should be able to get one spell through. Certainly with my Wizard if it&#39;s more that a couple levels higher than me I don&#39;t even bother casting as it will get resisted fully.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnless I misread your post, I think it only prudent that Verant change this. There&#39;s no way a group of 18-20 lvl players, regardless of class, should be taking down monsters that are double their level. That&#39;s a tad extreme.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrev<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom:\tJuan Custer [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JuanC@...\">JuanC@...</a>]<br/>\nSent:\tWednesday, May 19, 1999 9:10 AM<br/>\nTo:\t&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_spell_research@onelist.com\">EQ_spell_research@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject:\tRe: [EQ_spell_research] Enchanters and Research (Bersker Str)<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Juan Custer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JuanC@...\">JuanC@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tHe he, good luck.  Apparently Verant decided Whirl was too powerful<br/>\nand they downgraded it.  They&#39;ve been doing it quietly to one server at a<br/>\ntime and it hit Karana last night.  My Enchanter friends noticed an<br/>\nIMMEDIATE difference when they logged in, with Whirl now being resisted 35%<br/>\nof the time by blues and going up with each monster level.<br/>\n<br/>\n\talso expect LifeDrain to start being resisted hardcore in the near<br/>\nfuture.  I grouped with four other 18-20th level Necromancers and we could<br/>\nkill a Griffin easily, though a Hill Giant was still quite in the danger<br/>\nzone (ie first time it killed all the pets and one necro, second time we<br/>\nran, third time we killed it).  Personally I don&#39;t see how nasty this is<br/>\nsimply because I gained like MAYBE an eighth of a bubble of XP per griffin<br/>\nkill, and there was tons of waiting.  I just wanted to see if I could do it,<br/>\nand now its time to go back to Oasis killing crocs. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nMalark on Karana<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kahlan@...\">kahlan@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kahlan@...\">kahlan@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, May 19, 1999 9:48 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_spell_research@onelist.com\">EQ_spell_research@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [EQ_spell_research] Enchanters and Research (Bersker Str)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kahlan@...\">kahlan@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;Date: Tue, 18 May 1999 18:59:02 -0400 <br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Fondain De&#39;Illusion&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Fondain@...\">Fondain@...</a>&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;Subject: Lil bit from an Enchanter<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Just a lil point, <br/>\n&gt; &gt;I have watched a group of lvl 16 necros kill sand giants.... <br/>\n&gt; Ok, thats<br/>\n&gt; fine, but here is what irks me. I realize that as an <br/>\n&gt; enchanter I am not<br/>\n&gt; &gt;expected to do the offense like wizards, magicians or even <br/>\n&gt; necros, Our<br/>\n&gt; prime directive is debuffing and buffing and we get some incredible<br/>\n&gt; &gt;spells. Here are my rants. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am a 20th level enchanter and I solo all the time,  I <br/>\n&gt; simply use my pet<br/>\n&gt; and whirl the creatures with no problem.  I have been soloing <br/>\n&gt; since level<br/>\n&gt; 8th.  Granted level 15th and 19th were hard with only a 12th <br/>\n&gt; and 16th level<br/>\n&gt; pet, but I made it.  I do believe that groups will appreciate <br/>\n&gt; you more once<br/>\n&gt; you get the whirl till you hurl spell.  I have people swear <br/>\n&gt; to me that they<br/>\n&gt; would rather fight with a enchanter vs wizard anyday due to <br/>\n&gt; the fact that<br/>\n&gt; they can whirl and have a pet.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;1. we don&#39;t get enought buff or debuff that only WE have. <br/>\n&gt; Why do other<br/>\n&gt; classes get beserker str? Thats unbeknownst to me. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You are incorrect Ber. Str is available to enchanters as a 20th level<br/>\n&gt; research spell.  I confirmed this with a 30th level <br/>\n&gt; enchanter.  (I came<br/>\n&gt; across a spell list that had the spell and couldn&#39;t find it <br/>\n&gt; anywhere, I<br/>\n&gt; then decided to ask the 30th level enchanter if they had it, <br/>\n&gt; they did, they<br/>\n&gt; researched it).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;2. Ok, i can understand perhaps them resisting our offensive <br/>\n&gt; dmg spells<br/>\n&gt; but how are we supposed to be a group debuffer if they resist all &gt;our<br/>\n&gt; spells? Even after using tashan or tashanii which also have a <br/>\n&gt; tendency to<br/>\n&gt; get resisted? Kinda makes us useless in that regard eh?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Just a few things im kinda irked about...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Fondain De&#39;Illusion, Master Enchanter of the Amber Knights, Tarew Mar<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I honestly believe all mage classes have this problem of <br/>\n&gt; monsters resisting<br/>\n&gt; spells.  I was fighting a DW Croc yesterday at full health <br/>\n&gt; and full mana.<br/>\n&gt; I almost died.  I lost my pet (20th level) and had 3 resisted <br/>\n&gt; sanity warped<br/>\n&gt; spells (92 points of damage currently) and 5 resisted whirl <br/>\n&gt; till you hurl.<br/>\n&gt; I had to rely on a kind necro for the help to kill it in the <br/>\n&gt; end.  BTW the<br/>\n&gt; DW Croc was blue to me, I rarely ever cast a tashen spell.  I <br/>\n&gt; find that I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; just as sucessful with it as without it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Do not sell yourself short.  Enchanters are amoung one of the <br/>\n&gt; most powerful<br/>\n&gt; classes out there, on the otherhand also one of the most <br/>\n&gt; difficult to play.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Just my 2 coppers worth for you.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; To all out there, this might of been a tad bit off topic. But <br/>\n&gt; I did mention<br/>\n&gt; the research part about bersker Str.  8)  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Safe journey to all and Good Luck.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kahlan 20th Level Enchanter (High Elf)<br/>\n&gt; Master Enchanter of Clan MacLear<br/>\n&gt; Xegony Server<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; What was YOUR favorite part?!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Tell other Star Wars fans at ONElist!<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; This list is intended for the trade of Spell components for <br/>\n&gt; spell research.
