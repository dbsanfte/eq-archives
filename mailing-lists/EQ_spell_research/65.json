I have<br/>\n&gt; pretty much decoded my 1st and 2nd book, but I haven&#39;t tried doing research<br/>\n&gt; (most of the stuff in my 1st and book I have already).  I have some<br/>\n&gt; questions, so here is a small message I posted to my guildpage earlier<br/>\n&gt; today.  There is a really slight spoiler below for one of the magicians<br/>\n&gt; spells which I use as an example for a question I have :<br/>\n&gt; *<br/>\n&gt; *<br/>\n&gt; *<br/>\n&gt; *<br/>\n&gt; *<br/>\n&gt; *<br/>\n&gt; *<br/>\n&gt; *<br/>\n&gt; *<br/>\n&gt; *<br/>\n&gt; *<br/>\n&gt; *<br/>\n&gt; -----------<br/>\n&gt; Ok....I keep asking around and I keep getting 15 different answers.  A GM<br/>\n&gt; told me you don&#39;t need a blank parchment and quill in the container when<br/>\n&gt; you combine.  Now do you need this in your inventory instead?  Someone I<br/>\n&gt; asked told me you need the parchment and quill in your inventory to make<br/>\n&gt; the spell but I don&#39;t know who is right.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also, what is really confusing is the fact that the magicians spells list<br/>\n&gt; other spells as part of their ingredient.  Perhaps you guys can tell me if<br/>\n&gt; your books do this took.  See example :<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;      *********************<br/>\n&gt;      Summon Elemental Mist:<br/>\n&gt;      Lesser Summoning Air<br/>\n&gt;      Words of Duress<br/>\n&gt;      The Scent of Marr<br/>\n&gt;      *********************<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It lists &quot;Lesser Summoning Air&quot; as one of the ingredients.  Some players<br/>\n&gt; have posted to a list that I subscribed to a while back, saying you need to<br/>\n&gt; combine the spell it lists as one of the ingredients.  However I asked a<br/>\n&gt; few people that told me you just need to have the<br/>\n&gt; spell WRITTEN in your spellbook in order to create the next level version<br/>\n&gt; of it.  Is this true?  And is this the same with the necro/wiz/enchanter<br/>\n&gt; spells?<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;         Finally, if anyone wants another spoiler for the 3rd magicians book, you<br/>\n&gt; can go to the URL here (hopefully it will still be up) :<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.eqvault.com/boards/mshop/messages/27001.shtml\">http://www.eqvault.com/boards/mshop/messages/27001.shtml</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Zolthar<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Are you hogging all the fun?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Friends tell friends about ONElist!<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; This list is intended for the trade of Spell components for spell research.
