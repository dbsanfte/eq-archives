That being<br/>\nsaid, the happy virus is a virus that automatically attaches itself to all<br/>\noutgoing email messages if you are infected. Furthermore, unless the<br/>\ninfected person sends an email to himself, he has no idea that it is being<br/>\nsent. It is possible that the poster was not even aware that he sent that<br/>\nattachment, though the fact that there was no text in the email may indicate<br/>\notherwise. But, if he has the address of this list in his address book, it<br/>\nmay be an automated mailing and he may not even be aware that it was sent. I<br/>\nhave sent him an email to notify him in case this was not intended. Just<br/>\nthought some clarification would be good before we have the FBI arresting<br/>\nthis guy on 1st degree murder charges.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnless you execute the attachment, you are in no danger of becoming<br/>\ninfected. If you have already executed it, simply download a copy of Mcafee<br/>\nfor free and it will clean it out for you. www.mcafee.com<br/>\nFor those are interested, I have attached details of the virus below from<br/>\nthe Mcafee web site.<br/>\n<br/>\nDave<br/>\n<br/>\n****************************<br/>\nThe worm infects a system via email delivery and arrives as an attachment<br/>\ncalled Happy99.EXE. It is sent unknowingly by a user. When the program is<br/>\nrun it deploys its payload displaying fireworks on the users monitor.<br/>\n<br/>\nNote: At this time no destructive payload has been discovered.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the Happy.EXE is run it copies itself to Windows&#92;System folder under<br/>\nthe name SKA.EXE. It then extracts, from within itself, a DLL called SKA.DLL<br/>\ninto the Windows&#92;System folder if one does not already exist.<br/>\n<br/>\nNote: Though the SKA.EXE file file is a copy of the original it does not run<br/>\nas the Happy.EXE files does, so it does not copy itself again, nor does it<br/>\ndisplay the fireworks on the users monitor.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe worm then checks for the existence of WSOCK32.SKA in the Windows&#92;System<br/>\nfolder, if it does not exist and a the file WSOCK32.DLL does exist, it<br/>\ncopies the WSOCK32.DLL to WSOCK32.SKA.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe worm then creates the registry entry -<br/>\n<br/>\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE&#92;SOFTWARE&#92;Microsoft&#92;Windows&#92;CurrentVersion&#92;RunOnce&#92;Ska.exe<br/>\n=&quot;Ska.exe&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n- which will execute SKA.EXE the next time the system is restarted. When<br/>\nthis happens the worm patches WSOCK32.DLL and adds hooks to the exported<br/>\nfunctions EnumProtocolsW and WSAAsyncGetProtocolByName.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe patched code calls two exported functions in SKA.DLL called mail and<br/>\nnews, these functions allow the worm to attach itself to SMTP e-mail and<br/>\nalso to any postings to newsgroups the user makes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n----<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Cristie &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cristie@...\">cristie@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_spell_research@onelist.com\">EQ_spell_research@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Sunday, May 16, 1999 12:14 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ_spell_research] word of possession<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Cristie &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cristie@...\">cristie@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Who the HELL do you think you are sending virus executables out to people<br/>\n&gt; on a mailing list.
