There are a lot of new people..thousands daily.  I don&#39;t see that <br/>\neveryone is taught in advance of the things that could come from opening <br/>\n.exe files they get in e-mail.  It looks innocuous enough when they get <br/>\nit.  Lots of new people end up with infected systems from things happening <br/>\njust like this.<br/>\nPersonally, I am well versed and I know what to do and what not to do to <br/>\nassure that I don&#39;t have something on my system I don&#39;t want, BUT, there <br/>\nare many new people who aren&#39;t.  The anger is directed towards what can <br/>\nhappen to users who are not educated to these things rather than the folks <br/>\nwho already know what&#39;s up with attachments.<br/>\nThe person who sent that out is also a 15 year old boy.  I checked his <br/>\nprofile and unless he is fibbing (doubtful or he woulda said he is older <br/>\n:)  ) then he is about 10th grade in high school.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 01:54 PM 5/16/99 -0700, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kalekona@...\">kalekona@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;O.K. people.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;You have nothing to fear from viruses in E-Mail.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If you don&#39;t download attachments then you are fine...A<br/>\n&gt;virus CANNOT be sent by E-Mail.
