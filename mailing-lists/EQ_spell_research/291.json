A Paladin (npc)in Erudin asks you to go on<br/>\nquest to find the Teatamnet of Vanear.<br/>\n&gt; An enchantress in Erudin talks to you about her brother Moodoro Findhorn.<br/>\nHow he had been slated for execution for selling the magical water of the<br/>\nvasty deep to a npc in Qeynos at Crow&#39;s Inn called Flynn. She wants you to<br/>\nfind Flynn and Moodoro and get the water, then she will poison it and you<br/>\nreturn it to Flynn.  (haven&#39;t done this quest yet fully though, because I<br/>\ncan&#39;t get Flynn to talk to me.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyhow, sorry about the side tangent but,  You locate Moodoro in Qeynos.<br/>\nWhen you ask him about the Testamnet of Vanear he will sell it to you for<br/>\n2gp and change.  Thus far I have come as well and need to venture to High<br/>\nHold in search of the holder of the 2 pages Ran the Librarian.  Seeing as<br/>\nhow everyone and their dog talks about getting slaughtered when they go to<br/>\nHigh Hold, I don&#39;t think I will be finishing this quest for at least a<br/>\ncouple more lvls.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Although, I am very interested to see how this Quest turns out, and if you<br/>\ncan use the Testament for any other purpose than delivering it back to the<br/>\nPaladin in Erudin.  It would be great if it allowed you some new spells or<br/>\nsomething.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I do think though, if you camp that the Testament will disappear from your<br/>\ninventory (correct me if I am wrong).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If anyone else has more info on this topic I would be greatly thankful.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks in advance,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Dason Falth 7th Wizard<br/>\n&gt; Karana<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 14<br/>\n&gt;      Date: Sun, 16 May 1999 16:40:08 -0700<br/>\n&gt;      From: &quot;William Ross Cardon II&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wrcardon@...\">wrcardon@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Subject: Testament of Vanear, for research.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   I have acquired a book called the Testament of Vanear as part of a<br/>\nquest.  It is<br/>\n&gt;   missing two pages which a NPC named Ran (Librarian in High Hold)<br/>\nsupposedly<br/>\n&gt;   stole.  It appears that if these two pages are acquired and combined in<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt;   Testament that you will get a working copy of the Testament of Vanear.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   I was wondering if this was a book for research, or it had another<br/>\npurpose.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Thanks in advance.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; The Final Countdown is here!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Join the &quot;Star Wars&quot; craze at ONElist.<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; This list is intended for the trade of Spell components for spell<br/>\nresearch.
