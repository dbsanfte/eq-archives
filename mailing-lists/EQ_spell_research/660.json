Checking the neat site:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mythiran.com/\">http://www.mythiran.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nand viewing this file:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://members.xoom.com/_XOOM/ThStorm/necro.htm\">http://members.xoom.com/_XOOM/ThStorm/necro.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI see the following text:<br/>\nThis is the COMPLETE list of research spells and ingredients for necros.<br/>\nThis list is courtesy of Azrael. Thanks Az. It is supposed to be a complete<br/>\nlist and all ingredients listed are Words. Also, the Az had a few comments<br/>\nand disclaimers to add:<br/>\n<br/>\nI was under the impression that necros use Runes for their research<br/>\ncomponents but this page specifies all the components will be Words.  Then<br/>\ndown below in the Banshee Aura spell it lists Derivation and Eradication.<br/>\nIs this correct?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m interested in going through the motions of learning the languages to<br/>\nread the recipe books but want to at least know I&#39;m on the right path before<br/>\nwasting components.<br/>\n<br/>\nPS  I&#39;m on the Povar server and would be interested in buying either of the<br/>\ncomponents needs or a finished scroll  8)  Also, I would be happy to grab<br/>\nany of the enchant metal scrolls from Neriak if there are enchanters who<br/>\ncan&#39;t get in there.<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks,<br/>\nShawn<br/>\nFlarfian, lvl 16 dark elf necro<br/>\nDarmok, lvl 15 troll shaman<br/>\nAzara, lvl 8 high elf enchanter<br/>\nBertt, lvl 12 barbarian warrior</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
