It becomes a slight pain when I&#39;m fighting in BB, and sometimes <br/>\nI&#39;ll barely make it alive out of a scuffle with a blue scrawny gnoll / <br/>\ngnoll / patrolling gnoll.  I&#39;ve got all cloth armor, 2H worn great staff <br/>\nthat has about 120 attack, i&#39;m 135AC with my buffs, 145 HP with buffs.  The <br/>\nproblem with the &#39;pets&#39; I can understand, but being able to cast a L4 pet <br/>\ninbetween enemy attacks, get the pet to taunt the attacker and have three <br/>\nor four hits to high tail to a zone is an advantage.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter playing my enchanter for a while, I&#39;ve come to the following <br/>\nconclusion about enchanters:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Difficult class to advance, especially solo.<br/>\n2) Best in a group, sticking to the back.<br/>\n3) Underappreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnly after I mentioned that I could do a combination of see invis / invis <br/>\ndid the group appreciate me a bit more (especially after large trains of <br/>\nelite gnoll guards / gnoll commanders in BB).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy stats are (If I remember correctly):<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR \t60<br/>\nCON\t70<br/>\nAGI \t70<br/>\nDEX \t75<br/>\nWIS \t83<br/>\nINT \t122<br/>\nCHA \t100<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far I&#39;ve kept my skills to the following for monetary purposes (and, <br/>\ncome to find out, this has been a really good strategy):<br/>\n<br/>\n45 in Fletching (highest for L8)<br/>\n31 in Jewelmaking<br/>\n<br/>\nJewelmaking I would highly recommend to an enchanter, especially Dark Elf <br/>\n(since the Enchant: Silver spell is in Neriak and, from what I&#39;ve heard, no <br/>\nwhere else; if I&#39;m wrong, PLEASE tell me!).  Once the Dark Elf Enchanter <br/>\nhas the illusion spells, along with invisibility, there&#39;s no place that <br/>\ncharacter can&#39;t go (more or less).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Tuesday, May 18, 1999 6:59 PM, Fondain De&#39;Illusion <br/>\n[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Fondain@...\">Fondain@...</a>] wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Just a lil point,<br/>\n&gt;     I have watched a group of lvl 16 necros kill sand giants....

I realize that as an enchanter I am <br/>\nnot expected to do the offense like wizards, magicians or even necros, Our <br/>\nprime directive is debuffing and buffing and we get some incredible spells. <br/>\nHere are my rants.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;         1. we don&#39;t get enought buff or debuff that only WE have.

Even after using tashan or tashanii which also have a tendency <br/>\nto get resisted?
