Also, thank<br/>\nyou<br/>\nVicki. :)<br/>\nI found Gloves of Rallos Zek,<br/>\nFlame of Vox ( qty 2 )<br/>\nWords of Coersion ( qty 2 )<br/>\nWords of Transendence (qty 2)<br/>\n<br/>\n1- My friend Arkaine (lvl 35 magician on fennin with me) successfully<br/>\nmade<br/>\na level 20 earth elemental.  So the methodology is there.  NO NEED FOR<br/>\nPEN<br/>\nAND PARCHMENT.  Just the three components listed in the book then<br/>\ncombine.<br/>\n<br/>\n2- Everfont is broke.  Level 20 water ele is broke.  Level 24 Earth ele<br/>\nis<br/>\nbroke.  How do i know?  Well i no longer have Gloves of Rallos Zek and<br/>\nnow i<br/>\nam down to 1 Words of Coersion.  Also I am down to 1 words of<br/>\ntransendence<br/>\nbecuase i tried to create level 24 earth ele and everfont only to get<br/>\nthe<br/>\nmessage that these hard earned and extremely rare items do not go<br/>\ntogether<br/>\nto form jack squak.<br/>\n<br/>\n3- Arkaine was successful in creating level 20 earth, so the method on<br/>\nhow<br/>\nto do it is real simple.  Put in the three components, click combine.<br/>\nHowever it would not allow Arkaine to create level 20 water nor<br/>\neverfont,<br/>\nand it would not allow me to create everfont nor Level 24 earth.  I<br/>\ntalked<br/>\nto the man who updates and maintains EQLizer which is at Gameznet.com<br/>\nwho is<br/>\nin my guild and he talked to GZ less then a  week ago.  GZ told him that<br/>\nall<br/>\nresearch was implemented EXCEPT magician research.  I believe they<br/>\nforgot to<br/>\nimplement ALL our research, just some of it.  If any of have luck, let<br/>\nme<br/>\nknow.  Once again, YOU DO NOT NEED PEN AND PARCHMENT<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace Fellow Magi,<br/>\nJago Mindbender 34 Fennin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMost Of The Magicians Spells research Are broke ( Still mostly a beta<br/>\nCharacter) Some work some don&#39;t .... As For the Rest I don&#39;t know  Never<br/>\nbothered to research them on the Net or get information about them<br/>\nanyone high enough level to research in the other classes never bothered<br/>\nto post anything general that I have Found ..<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps..<br/>\n--<br/>\n<br/>\nJamie Macdonald<br/>\n<br/>\nA.K.A<br/>\nMagis DarkStone<br/>\nMercenary Mage<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I&#39;ve been a Wizard, Magician, Sorcerer, And Charlatan.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;But I&#39;ve always been a Loner by Nature<br/>\n and A Lurker by Want&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Knowledge Is Power, Learn how to use It&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
