For the other pages, they always come in consecutive numbers. &lt;ie. 8 & 9 &gt; Put them in your Tome and click combine, For Tasarins Grimoire pages, simply find the 2 halves and put them in and hit combine. Yes, the higher the number, the harder it is to combine. So save those triple digit pages until you get around 24.  You might succeed at a lower lvl, but you have a much much better chance of failing then, and they are sort of hard to come by. Another helpful tidbet, I have seen many enchanters casting invis. on themselves to kill a green pet, Enchanters CAN use the lvl 1 magician spell &quot;Reclaim Energy&quot; a much better (mana wise) way of killing your pet. Thats all for now :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nFondain De&#39;illusion; High Enchanter of the Amber Knights, Tarew Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
