It should be easier for you to<br/>\nincrease your skill now as the skill cap has increased from what it was four<br/>\nlevels ago.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, as skills get higher, it takes longer for them to increase (within<br/>\nreason.. sometimes you&#39;ll see nothing, then it&#39;ll jump up 3 points in 3<br/>\nswings).  I would just continue to use piercing normally.  It will go up.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Spyke Pha&#39;al</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
