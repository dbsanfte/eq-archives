I am also of 16th level, but i am enchanter.<br/>\nThere are two kinds of books, information books, and component books. In my<br/>\nclass example, the first book for enchanters is &#39;An end of an age&#39; or some<br/>\nsuch name and it really tells you nothing exept to keep an eye out for works<br/>\ndone by long forgotten enchanters, and even lists a few names (I do not<br/>\nbeleive this to be a spoiler, because enchanters will still have to purchase<br/>\nthe book to find out some of the names listed in the book).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other types of books open up to allow you to add spell components to<br/>\nthem, like the books &#39;The Book of Ancient Resoration&#39; or &#39;Endless Tomb of<br/>\nEnchantments&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nVarious spell components can be found on different kinds of creatures thru<br/>\nout the realm. At this time i have not found any of these components myself,<br/>\nbut have been in groups where people have been fortunate enough to find<br/>\nthem. They seem to be pages of script or something, many requiring dead<br/>\nlanguages to read.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of the creatures that i&#39;ve been told to seek out for the components are<br/>\nGorge Hounds, Deep Water Crocks, and Gouls. I have killed many gorge hounds,<br/>\nbut have yet to find anything on those, and have only fought a small amount<br/>\nof gouls and no DW crocks.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdmitedly my information is small, but it is a start. Hope it helps you.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
