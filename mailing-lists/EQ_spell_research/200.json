As far as I have ever","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2034877653\">I am posting this to both newsletters because I have seen this question pop up \r<br/>\non both.  The first issue I will discuss is Languages.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAs far as I have ever seen, I have never bot a skill raised from speaking the \r<br/>\nnative tounge to an NPC.  I have found that no matter what language I &#92;&#39;hail&#92;&#39; \r<br/>\nthem in they always respond in Common.  I think this because I understand \r<br/>\neverything that they say, if it was a language that I am awful in wouldn&#92;&#39;t I<br/>\nnot \r<br/>\nunderstand??  Also wouldn&#92;&#39;t this become an exploit?? Imaging all of us wizards \r<br/>\nin the store by the bank in Felwithe, just saying &#92;&#39;Hail&#92;&#39; over and over again \r<br/>\nin say Elder Elvish, to get the NPC to spam us.  Would drive everyone nuts, and \r<br/>\nprobably crash the zone.  So I am unsure as to if listening to an NPC would \r<br/>\nreally work.  Also has anyone actually seen the &#92;&#39;your language skill increase&#92;&#39;<br/>\n\r<br/>\nafter spaming the NPC and the whole zone for that matter.  I am very good at \r<br/>\nlanguages and have in my time learned Old Erudian, Elder Elvish, Elvish, Tier \r<br/>\nDal, Barbarian, Halfling, Dwarvish, and Gnoll.  Never once have I got a increase<br/>\n\r<br/>\nfrom a NPC.  Please clarify this issue for me please, would love to learn more \r<br/>\nand faster of course.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nNow there seems to be some questions here on the skills of melee.  I don&#92;&#39;t \r<br/>\nclaim to know the calculations, but I know how to max them all.  I started with \r<br/>\nthe dagger of course, got it up to 22 or so, then got my hand to hand up to \r<br/>\nabout 18 for the heck of it.  I then got staffs, first a one handed that is up \r<br/>\nto about 25 or so, this was my travel, backup weapon which was lost when a \r<br/>\nskeleton took a dislike to me in lesserfaydarke (was bound to qeynos) Now my \r<br/>\nmain stay weapon is a 2h staff.  I have that skill up to about 38 right now.  I \r<br/>\ngot a giant snake fang the other day fighting in Paw.  Before that I had decided<br/>\n\r<br/>\nto increase my piercing and had a summonded dagger.  It took well over 45min and<br/>\n\r<br/>\naobut 300 melee swings of the peircing weapon before I saw a single advancement,<br/>\n\r<br/>\nthen it flew up to 31 or so.  For ahwile I though maybe it was never going to \r<br/>\nraise but my perseverance paid off and it did, so I am going to try and max my \r<br/>\npierce, find a 1h blunt and max that.  Then go back to my favorite 2h staff.  So<br/>\n\r<br/>\nall it takes for you skills is patience.  Yes if you haven&#92;&#39;t used it in a great<br/>\n\r<br/>\ntime it takes alot of use before you start to see skill in it again, kind of \r<br/>\nlike skiing or biking, hehe.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nMay our Paths Cross\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nZakrul The Traveler\r<br/>\nCompanion\r<br/>\nWizard<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------------------------------------------<br/>\nThis mail sent through IMP: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://web.horde.org/imp/\">http://web.horde.org/imp/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
