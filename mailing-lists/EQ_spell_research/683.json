I have been on a long quest for<br/>\n&gt; &gt;handmade backpacks because of that... need all 70 slots in my locker to<br/>\nhold<br/>\n&gt; &gt;words. (one slot for the book)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Where do you find handmade backpacks?  Or more to the point, how do you<br/>\n&gt; MAKE them?  After spending a ridiculoud amount of time and money searching<br/>\n&gt; for the answer and experimenting with combinations that don&#39;t work,<br/>\nneither<br/>\n&gt; I nor any guild member have been able to figure out how to tailor a<br/>\n&gt; Backpack.  If I read into your message correctly, the tailored backpacks<br/>\n&gt; have 10 slots instead of the standard 8?  That answers the long-asked<br/>\n&gt; question of why backpack patterns are more expensive than backpacks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I realize this is a bit off-topic, but I have seen mention of handmade<br/>\n&gt; backpacks NOWHERE else.  And no one else seems to have a clue.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks<br/>\n&gt; chpicker<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  your connection to people who share your interests.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; This list is intended for the trade of Spell components for spell<br/>\nresearch.
