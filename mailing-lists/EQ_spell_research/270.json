Thanks for all the info!<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, i&#39;ve come across another type of page and am curious on what to do with<br/>\nit. Rather than being a part of a page like the Grimiore, this is a full<br/>\npage Entitled Velishoul&#39;s Tombe Page 68.. Just like Tasarin&#39;s page it cannot<br/>\nbe read like normal documents.<br/>\n<br/>\nI got this page from a trade with another player for a rune I had found, so<br/>\nI am unaware of it&#39;s source.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, anyone notice an abundance of left sided portions of grimiore pages? I<br/>\nrarely find the right side portion. Is it just my bad luck to always find<br/>\nthe left side (I have 8 of them), or is the right side the rarer side?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
