The trick is to spam, zone, spam, zone, spam,<br/>\nzone.  You will get 1-2 increases per 3-4 zones.  It works and I can<br/>\nconfirm it since I now have a Below Average skill in Old Erudite raised<br/>\nfrom Very Bad.<br/>\n<br/>\nZolthar<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 03:35 PM 5/10/99 -0700, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kalekona@...\">kalekona@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;This is my experience in languages.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;1. You must be grouped with whom you are learning.<br/>\n&gt;2. He/She must have greater skill than you.<br/>\n&gt;3. You must talk in /gsay for it to increase your<br/>\n&gt;level.(Never raised my skill with /say /tell or /shout).<br/>\n&gt;4. As for skills being allowed even after not meeting the<br/>\n&gt;creature. I think that certain ones can be learned just<br/>\n&gt;because of your level.  After I level up I am sure to visit<br/>\n&gt;my guildmaster and he has one or two languages for me to<br/>\n&gt;learn.  Otherwise I would know Sphinx, and Gryphon, and Hill<br/>\n&gt;giant allready...hehe.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Star Wars fans are using ONElist to share the fun.<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Are you?<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;This list is intended for the trade of Spell components for spell<br/>\n </span></blockquote>research.
