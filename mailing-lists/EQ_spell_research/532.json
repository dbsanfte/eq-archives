You are supposed to find Lydl and kill him<br/>\nand return whatever he has to this NPC.  He can sometimes be found outside the South Gate to<br/>\nthe newbie zone of East Freeport near a couple of cacti.  His is approximately level 5.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have the book to, but haven&#39;t been able to find out which guildmaster the quest originates from.  I guess he won&#39;t give me the quest because a) I&#39;m to high of a level or b) He won&#39;t give me the quest since I already have the book.  If anybody<br/>\nknows the specific guild masters name I&#39;d appreciate it too.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\nMalkin</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
