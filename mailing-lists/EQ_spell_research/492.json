Then make a plan to notify the other<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; person since they will be spaming themselves and will not see words, do a wave or jump. You want to do this after you see 2 improvements. So one person teaches on one side and the other person takes the other side.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Congratulations to &quot;M-K-ROSES,&quot; our latest ONElist of the Week.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Visit our homepage and share with us how ONElist is changing YOUR life!<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; This list is intended for the trade of Spell components for spell research.
