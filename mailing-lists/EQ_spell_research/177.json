The details are <br/>\nbeing worked on now, but a &quot;guild&quot; or group of sorts will be soon forming on <br/>\nFennin, then branching out from there eventually. It has a very similar <br/>\npremise to the Conclave of Wizardry from the Dragonlance series of novels. <br/>\n(Not very original, but a very good premise nonetheless, amazing it is not <br/>\nalready in existence.) If you aren&#39;t familiar with the idea, it is basically <br/>\na gathering of all mages, bound together for the persuit of knowledge and <br/>\nthe sake of magic. Those who join the Conclave can be of any race and mage <br/>\nclass, (and currently in a guild). In fact, it is essential that all are <br/>\nrepresented. The original idea was not to go official, to just create a <br/>\ngroup for the sharing of knowledge (i.e. languages, research components <br/>\netc.), but going &quot;official&quot; may be in future plans. A web site is in the <br/>\nworks, all we need now are interested people, willing to join and/or <br/>\ncontribute their knowledge to the Conclave. (The Conclave is a working <br/>\ntitle, which may or may not stick.)
