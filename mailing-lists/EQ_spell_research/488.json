Then make a plan to notify the other<br/>\n&gt; &gt; person since they will be spaming themselves and will not see words, do a wave or jump. You want to do this after you see 2 improvements. So one person teaches on one side and the other person takes the other side.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
