I speak all race languages plus, Elder Elvish, Old Erudian, Elder Teir&#39;dal, and Combine, all to excellent. In the language choice it reads the above mentioned languages but when<br/>\nyou look at your skill list Elder Teir&#39;dal is Kobold and Combine is Giant Tounge, I do not know about the remaining languages (Dragon, Old Dragon, and Thieve&#39;s Cant) out there but hopefully I will find out. BTW The rest of the languages match up<br/>\nwith the same name.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kalekona@...\">kalekona@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kalekona@...\">kalekona@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t know why people insist that Elder Tier&#39;Dal is<br/>\n&gt; Kolbold when Tier&#39;Dal is the Dark Elf Race.....Not to<br/>\n&gt; mention that there is a distinctly seperate language. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
