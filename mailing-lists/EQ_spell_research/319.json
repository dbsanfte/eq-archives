He said in his analysis that there <br/>\nwere some really great hidden things that magicians can get but no one has <br/>\ndiscovered yet.  He also said that once these secret goodies started being <br/>\ndiscovered, they would be made available at vendors where anyone could get <br/>\nthem.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tHas anyone any clue about these hidden, desirable things?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tIf you want to read Geoff&#39;s post on magicians, I think Stratics, <br/>\nEQVault, and EQ&#39;lizer all have it.  It is very enlightening and useful for <br/>\nanyone playing a magician or grouping with one.  [WARNING, &quot;I hate my class&quot; <br/>\nwhine follows]  Last night&#39;s patch mentioned just as briefly as possible that <br/>\n&quot;magician&#39;s pets will no longer run away from combat&quot;, but I guess that <br/>\nlittle bug didn&#39;t make it into Geoff&#39;s analysis that he wrote two or three <br/>\nweeks ago.  I also think magicians are hurt worse than anyone else by <br/>\ndisconnections and crashes, which he didn&#39;t address.  But, still, tis a good <br/>\nread and thoughtfully written.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
