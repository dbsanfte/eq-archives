I find that the best groups are wizard heavy.  I<br/>\nadventured last night with a group that had 4 wizards (20th, 17th(me), 16th,<br/>\nand 16th) 1 monk(15th), and 1 paladin(16th).   We were hunting orcs in<br/>\nhighpass hold.  Hardly anyone got hurt because the targets were dead before<br/>\nthey could do any real damage.  We were hunting things that were at least<br/>\nblue to the 20th level person and everyone was being effective.  I did get<br/>\nresisted a few times by some of the higher level mobs but nothing too crazy<br/>\nand no one ever came close to dying.  Plus we all got a bunch of experience<br/>\neven the 15th level guy who made 16th.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, I found half a page of a Grimoire and 1 words from the orcs there.  I<br/>\nalso bought a rune from the Paladin in our group who looted it.  I think<br/>\nthey were alocytes and medics  and scouts we got them from.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Elidain, now 18th level Wizard on Veeshan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
