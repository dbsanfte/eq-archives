I did the minor quests, recived the recepie book<br/>\n&gt; and the new book to combine items. So I thought I&#39;d try the simplest<br/>\n&gt; runes before using the rarer components in the harder runes.<br/>\n&gt; Tried Rune 1: Lapiz Lazuli, Bat Wing, Bone Chip. Items fail to combine<br/>\n&gt; in these quantities.<br/>\n&gt; Ah, it mentioned needing a quill and parchment in the book. I buy both<br/>\n&gt; at guild, and try the same. Items fail to combine in these quantities.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So I try the next: Turquoise, Fire Beetle Eye, and a Rusty slashing<br/>\n&gt; weapon. Same fail. Added quill and parchment, still same failure. Tried<br/>\n&gt; many different slashing weapons. All fail.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So is it buggy, and did Verant really add this whole new piece to<br/>\n&gt; research without testing it in the slightest, even to attempt to make<br/>\n&gt; one item? I have trouble believing even Verant would do that...so am I<br/>\n&gt; missing something obvious? Would be interested to hear what kind of<br/>\n&gt; success others have had with this new addition.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Quil of Bertoxxulous<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Create a list for FRIENDS & FAMILY...<br/>\n&gt; ...and YOU can WIN $100 to Amazon.com.
