I do 173 at level<br/>\n21 with Force Shock, do wizards not get a direct damage spell at 24?  As for<br/>\ndueling I never got into EQ to duel so I am not too worried about that.  I<br/>\nknow that when myself and one wizard friend get together in a free for all<br/>\narea like the orc area in Highpass Hold we get more than our fair share of<br/>\nthe kills regardless of who is there necros, wizards, whoever.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne huge advantage, we get travel and group travel only druids get similar<br/>\nspells as I recall.  I love being able to hit Erudin to get spells at a<br/>\nreasonable cost and sell for top prices and then bounce back to Faydwer or<br/>\nwherever, that is an enormous power.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Elidain Erudite Wizard 21rst Veeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Shane [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:xscion@...\">xscion@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, June 10, 1999 12:26 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_spell_research@onelist.com\">EQ_spell_research@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EQ_spell_research] Elidain<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Shane&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:xscion@...\">xscion@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     Elidain, &quot;us&quot; refers to Wizards.  The class that has<br/>\n&gt; nothing.  Give me<br/>\n&gt; an example of what we have over any class, and I will bash it into the<br/>\n&gt; ground with another example that blows it away.  As to<br/>\n&gt; fizzles, etc...  We<br/>\n&gt; are the slowest casters in the game.  I dueled a Necromancer<br/>\n&gt; that had the<br/>\n&gt; same HP as I, and we agreed to do DD spells only, in which he<br/>\n&gt; did 160 damage<br/>\n&gt; and I did 165.  The Necromancer won.  I have higher Magic<br/>\n&gt; resistance, but<br/>\n&gt; his spells did full damage every time.  My spell did full<br/>\n&gt; damage once, and<br/>\n&gt; it looked to be about 4 damage the second time.  Just so you<br/>\n&gt; know, we dueled<br/>\n&gt; with NO BUFFS on.  The speed of his spell was too much, as he<br/>\n&gt; always was<br/>\n&gt; ahead of my casts.  Anyways, I&#39;m out.  Someone try to tell me a reason<br/>\n&gt; Wizards are better, and I will defend my statement that we suck.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;                         - Zenon Amphitryon, 27th, Fennin Ro </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
