Now the only question<br/>\n&gt; is do I sell them or hang on to them in hopes that they will put the 24th<br/>\n&gt; level Charm spell back in the game.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sell them, they have removed the spell, and will only replace it with a new one (If they ever get around to it.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I ended up selling that non stacking words of  Dominion.  It was annoying<br/>\n&gt; me and sold for the same as the Stacking words of Dominion.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ll pop off an identify spell on the faded page when I am in game next.<br/>\n&gt; If that dosen&#39;t work I&#39;ll just give it to one of the enchanters in my guild<br/>\n&gt; and let them worry abou it.  :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Identify will say nothing about it :)<br/>\nJust give it to an Enchanter, they use the faded pages by putting them in thier research book seperatly, and hitting combine, and they will get a torn page with a number.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Again thanks for the help.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lomack, Knight Defender of the BCK<br/>\n&gt; Master of Recruiting<br/>\n&gt; www.bck.org<br/>\n&gt; &quot;The Crimson Knights&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Fennin Ro<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Congratulations to MSers_Online.
