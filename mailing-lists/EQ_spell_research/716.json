I was hoping<br/>\n&gt; someone<br/>\n&gt; was able to help me. I&#39;ve researched real spells with no problem, so i&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; wondering why this is much harder. And I refuse to believe that it is<br/>\n&gt; bugged!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Basically I add Bat Wings, Bone Chips, and Lapis Laluli (sp?) to the<br/>\n&gt; Concordance of Research and hit combine. It says these items do not<br/>\n&gt; combine.<br/>\n&gt; I have tried it with the quill and paper in my inventory (not that I<br/>\n&gt; needed<br/>\n&gt; them with REAL research).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I know there is a secret to this, I just don&#39;t know what it is.
