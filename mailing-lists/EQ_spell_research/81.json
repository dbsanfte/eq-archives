Also, thank<br/>\n&gt;you<br/>\n&gt;Vicki. :)<br/>\n&gt;I found Gloves of Rallos Zek,<br/>\n&gt;Flame of Vox ( qty 2 )<br/>\n&gt;Words of Coersion ( qty 2 )<br/>\n&gt;Words of Transendence (qty 2)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;1- My friend Arkaine (lvl 35 magician on fennin with me) successfully<br/>\n&gt;made<br/>\n&gt;a level 20 earth elemental.  So the methodology is there.  NO NEED FOR<br/>\n&gt;PEN<br/>\n&gt;AND PARCHMENT.  Just the three components listed in the book then<br/>\n&gt;combine.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;2- Everfont is broke.  Level 20 water ele is broke.  Level 24 Earth ele<br/>\n&gt;is<br/>\n&gt;broke.  How do i know?  Well i no longer have Gloves of Rallos Zek and<br/>\n&gt;now i<br/>\n&gt;am down to 1 Words of Coersion.  Also I am down to 1 words of<br/>\n&gt;transendence<br/>\n&gt;becuase i tried to create level 24 earth ele and everfont only to get<br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;message that these hard earned and extremely rare items do not go<br/>\n&gt;together<br/>\n&gt;to form jack squak.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;3- Arkaine was successful in creating level 20 earth, so the method on<br/>\n&gt;how<br/>\n&gt;to do it is real simple.  Put in the three components, click combine.<br/>\n&gt;However it would not allow Arkaine to create level 20 water nor<br/>\n&gt;everfont,<br/>\n&gt;and it would not allow me to create everfont nor Level 24 earth.  I<br/>\n&gt;talked<br/>\n&gt;to the man who updates and maintains EQLizer which is at Gameznet.com<br/>\n&gt;who is<br/>\n&gt;in my guild and he talked to GZ less then a  week ago.  GZ told him that<br/>\n&gt;all<br/>\n&gt;research was implemented EXCEPT magician research.  I believe they<br/>\n&gt;forgot to<br/>\n&gt;implement ALL our research, just some of it.  If any of have luck, let<br/>\n&gt;me<br/>\n&gt;know.  Once again, YOU DO NOT NEED PEN AND PARCHMENT<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Peace Fellow Magi,<br/>\n&gt;Jago Mindbender 34 Fennin<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Most Of The Magicians Spells research Are broke ( Still mostly a beta<br/>\n&gt;Character) Some work some don&#39;t ....
