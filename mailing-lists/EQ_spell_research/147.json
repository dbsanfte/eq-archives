I ran into this problem myself with 1H Blunt.  The best solution is to follow this procedure.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1) Find a group<br/>\n&gt; 2) Attack a mob (monster)<br/>\n&gt; 3) wait until the tanks get a few hits in<br/>\n&gt; 4) Place yourself BEHIND the mob<br/>\n&gt; 5) Start swinging your fang<br/>\n&gt; 6) When the mob is low enough on HP&#39;s, step behind the tanks and burn as usual<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The only time this doesn&#39;t work is against semi intelligent mobs who have a natural distaste for casting classes.  You&#39;ll find this out when they turn around and attack you.  If this happens, just step back.  Getting behind the mob is important<br/>\n&gt; because you get a &quot;chance to hit&quot; bonus, and this will raise your skill faster.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Good Luck, and by the way, this question is a little bit off topic.
