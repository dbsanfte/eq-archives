Is the Doctrine of Wizardry written in Elder Elvish or Tier&#39;Dal?   I&#39;ve heard there are four books yet you list 5 languages that you know or are working on.  Are there more than four books?  I really wish you were on my server. I&#39;d happily pay 5 plat to learn those languages.  Also, do wizards need ONLY runes?  <br/>\n     <br/>\n    Can anyone on the Karana server teach me other languages?  I&#39;ll pay/trade for them... (I already know Old Erudian to excellent.  I also have several non-rune reseach components I would gladly trade providing I dont need them myself.)<br/>\n        -----Original Message-----<br/>\n        From: Ken Morris [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kmorris2@...\">kmorris2@...</a>]<br/>\n        Sent: Tuesday, May 11, 1999 12:31 PM<br/>\n        To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_spell_research@onelist.com\">EQ_spell_research@onelist.com</a><br/>\n        Subject: [EQ_spell_research] Languages<br/>\n        <br/>\n        <br/>\n        I am excellent in Dragon, Combine, Old Eurdian, Elder Elvish, and am working on Elder Tier&#39;Dal today.  I will be happy to teach Dragon and Combine for 6 runes each.  The rest, I will teach for 3 runes or 5 plat each.  I am located on the Tarew Marr server.  I am firm on the Dragon and Combine btw.  I won&#39;t accept money but only runes for those languages.<br/>\n        <br/>\n        Talarin Kal&#39;Amon, High Elven Wizard</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
