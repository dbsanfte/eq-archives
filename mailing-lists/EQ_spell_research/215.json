The skull being the totem makes sense to me. Though<br/>\nin that case I think it would make more sense to have the staff be called<br/>\nthe sacred runed staff and the staff + skull be called the runed totem<br/>\nstaff.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust some musings.<br/>\n<br/>\nVeneficus<br/>\nmagician (lev 17) Mythannial Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; No I have to disagree, ever seen the priest of discord <br/>\n&gt; infront of the castle<br/>\n&gt; in Rivervale. .. perfect example of how it looked.  In beta you could<br/>\n&gt; combine them by clicking on the staff and then the skull and <br/>\n&gt; it was that<br/>\n&gt; easy. . .but they changed it.  Also the name of the staff when it is<br/>\n&gt; combined is The Sacred Runed Staff.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Demur<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; That is a Myth.  You cannot combine a Runed Totem Staff and a <br/>\n&gt; Skull.  The<br/>\n&gt; skull can be placed in your 2nd hand if you are not using a <br/>\n&gt; 2h weapon.  This<br/>\n&gt; will increase your mana by 20 and SV by 3 I belive..<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Valacian - 22nd Level Erudite Wizard, Xegony<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
