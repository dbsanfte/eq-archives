However, it was incomplete, and didn&#39;t do everything I wanted it<br/>\nto do.  So I decided to write my own.  I didn&#39;t even look at his source<br/>\ncode, I couldn&#39;t figure out what language it&#39;s in.  I wrote the whole thing<br/>\nfrom scratch.  And you&#39;re right...it IS real simple for anyone who knows<br/>\nprogramming.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, I have added an alphabetical sort to the program, and when I get the<br/>\nsort by class/level implemented I will post the new one.  Most people I<br/>\nhave talked to have said they like the program, so I will continue to work<br/>\non it.<br/>\n<br/>\nchpicker<br/>\nMinister of Commerce, OCD<br/>\nWizard of Veeshan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
