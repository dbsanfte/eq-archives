Being a wizard, I dumped most my<br/>\n&gt; training<br/>\n&gt; points into Evoke, though I put a point into all 5 to get the basics.  I<br/>\n&gt; am<br/>\n&gt; now 52 in Evoke and 24 or 25 in the other four skills.  I have also seen<br/>\n&gt; Specialize: Evoke and Specialize: Abjure go up from use since training in<br/>\n&gt; them.  As I recall, they were somewhere in the middle on the of the list<br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; trainable skills.  I think it goes combat/usable skills, specialize<br/>\n&gt; skills,<br/>\n&gt; trade skills, language skills from top to bottom in the trainers list.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -Shadowwalker of Karana<br/>\n&gt;  Level 24 Wizard<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Well the patch update says that specialization is now in place, but I<br/>\n&gt; still<br/>\n&gt; &gt; cannot train in it at my guild.  I asked in game and several other<br/>\n&gt; people<br/>\n&gt; &gt; also could not train in it.  Simply does not show up in the list.  Has<br/>\n&gt; &gt; anyone succesfully trained in this yet?<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
