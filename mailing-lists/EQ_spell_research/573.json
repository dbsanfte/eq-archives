Do not think I am ignoring any of you, or that your posts aren&#39;t <br/>\ngetting to one list ... they are, I just needed to end that thread, it was <br/>\nstarting to get to the point it was not civil.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo all you young wizards who might have been scared away from your class, do <br/>\nnot take the one man&#39;s opinion on them, make your own opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will not tell you it is easy, you have the lowest health in the game, and <br/>\nno pet ... which makes life difficult (I don&#39;t think it is possible to get an <br/>\n&quot;easy&quot; rating as a wizard)  But in a group... you are the prime finisher of <br/>\nmonsters.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe many posts I have gotten say that other people have not had as bad an <br/>\nexperience as the previous poster.  Many of them are doing more damage than <br/>\nhim, and not being resisted as often as he says (except on reds!), and <br/>\ncasting faster than him.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the many posts on this.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdam</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
