All I got was the message<br/>\nthat these items do not combine.  I reported every one of these bugs.  I<br/>\nhave tried with and without the quill and parchment.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a person who did not save all of their points for research, I could use<br/>\nthe practice runes to max out my research skill and I think that the way<br/>\nthat they created is fair and creative.  However, it makes me angry that<br/>\nthey aparently did not test this at all.  (Monday afternoon my wizard could<br/>\nnot even use the Concordance of Research).<br/>\n<br/>\nBest Regards<br/>\nMark Mazurik</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
