It will probably be quite expensive to<br/>\n&gt; learn though, usually a trade in runes is required.  That&#39;s how I learned<br/>\n&gt; and that&#39;s my price for teaching ;)  I&#39;m on the Tarew Marr server, if you<br/>\n&gt; are also on the same server, give me a tell ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Talarin Kal&#39;Amon, High Elven Wizard<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
