I&#39;ve reached 19th lvl and<br/>\nhave basically ignored the research aspect of our class, because:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. I&#39;ve managed to get 1 rune, and I didn&#39;t find it, I was given it as a<br/>\nfriend. People say they are random, but after sitting in Oasis for 3 levels<br/>\nand killing every single dw croc, dw caiman, crocodiles, caimans and Lockjaw<br/>\n(twice), I have as yet to find even 1 rune. These things THAT rare? I have<br/>\nalso never seen a vendor selling them.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. I&#39;ve looked all over Queynos for the doctrine of Wizardry and never found<br/>\nit. I have to take a trip to Erudin? That would be ridiculous.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. I couldn&#39;t train in research past 1 pt. when I hit 16th, haven&#39;t trained<br/>\nsince then. Does this mean we have to spend numerous pieces of plat to<br/>\nimprove this skill?<br/>\n<br/>\nCould some kind soul please give me a walkthrough on how you&#39;ve researched<br/>\nspells? Where and how you get runes?<br/>\n<br/>\nZalbar<br/>\n19th Wizard<br/>\nSolusek Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
