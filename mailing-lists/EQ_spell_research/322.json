Basically I have no opinion<br/>\nbecause I really have never played a Magician neither have I played a high<br/>\nlevel character.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tIt REALLY looks like its no one class&#39;s problem.  Everyone is saying<br/>\n&quot;Wizards suck after level 34&quot; or &quot;Mages suck after level 24&quot; or &quot;Losers suck<br/>\nafter level 1&quot;.  I don&#39;t see why people aren&#39;t seeing the REAL problem, and<br/>\nthat is that everybody SUCKS at higher levels.  Come on, we all know that<br/>\nVerant had to push EQ out after a short Phase 4.  They dropped a lot of<br/>\nstuff thinking they&#39;d have time to implement more high level stuff in<br/>\nproduction because obviously nobody would be high level for a while.  They<br/>\nwere wrong.  Check out the latest update to EQ&#39;Lizer<br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gameznet.com/eq/)\">http://gameznet.com/eq/)</a> to see another suspicious trend in higher level<br/>\nstuff.  Verant was unprepared at some people&#39;s... shall we say devotion<br/>\n(alright alright, fanaticism) to winning and now WE are reaping what they<br/>\nsowed (he he or SOWed).<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI won&#39;t argue with someone jabbering about how their 34th level<br/>\nwizard sucks compared to a 34th necromancer (a whole nother topic, but I<br/>\nseriously don&#39;t think necros solo THAT much better than others, I think the<br/>\nslight advantage is to offset that we will spend a lot of solitary life due<br/>\nto the fact that we&#39;re often KOS in several parts of several cities, like<br/>\nthe fact that I will NEVER see Felwithe except during a raid when I&#39;m like<br/>\nlevel 50) or how its time to quit when tou hit level 24 with your mage.  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t know, never played them, but I do know that EVERYONE seems to be<br/>\nhaving problems.  Stuff isn&#39;t implemented yet, some things aren&#39;t complete.<br/>\nhigher level stuff doesn&#39;t seem balanced.  This doesn&#39;t point to poor class<br/>\nbalancing, it points to poor level balancing.  Sort of like Verant released<br/>\ntheir product only when they had balanced everything after level 24 or<br/>\nsomething, and hoped to have the time to balance during production.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI&#39;m just say take alook around, go read the Magic Shop board at the<br/>\nEQVault (www.eqvault.com), and listen how everyone seems to be having a<br/>\nproblems (I eagerly await to have my beloved necromancer class be &quot;balanced&quot;<br/>\nin the near future, though I&#39;m sure it would just be because nobody<br/>\ncomplains about it).  I think when everyone is feedbacking or petitioning,<br/>\nperhaps they shouldn&#39;t be complaining about their prospective class more<br/>\nthan complaining about the general nature of the game after level XX (20?<br/>\n30?).<br/>\n<br/>\nMalark on Karana<br/>\n18th level Dark Elf Necromancer<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ShrrtStuff@...\">ShrrtStuff@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ShrrtStuff@...\">ShrrtStuff@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, May 19, 1999 12:24 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_spell_research@onelist.com\">EQ_spell_research@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [EQ_spell_research] Hidden gems for Magicians?

He said in his <br/>\n&gt; analysis that there <br/>\n&gt; were some really great hidden things that magicians can get <br/>\n&gt; but no one has <br/>\n&gt; discovered yet.  He also said that once these secret goodies <br/>\n&gt; started being <br/>\n&gt; discovered, they would be made available at vendors where <br/>\n&gt; anyone could get <br/>\n&gt; them.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tHas anyone any clue about these hidden, desirable things?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tIf you want to read Geoff&#39;s post on magicians, I think <br/>\n&gt; Stratics, <br/>\n&gt; EQVault, and EQ&#39;lizer all have it.  It is very enlightening <br/>\n&gt; and useful for <br/>\n&gt; anyone playing a magician or grouping with one.  [WARNING, &quot;I <br/>\n&gt; hate my class&quot; <br/>\n&gt; whine follows]  Last night&#39;s patch mentioned just as briefly <br/>\n&gt; as possible that <br/>\n&gt; &quot;magician&#39;s pets will no longer run away from combat&quot;, but I <br/>\n&gt; guess that <br/>\n&gt; little bug didn&#39;t make it into Geoff&#39;s analysis that he wrote <br/>\n&gt; two or three <br/>\n&gt; weeks ago.  I also think magicians are hurt worse than anyone else by <br/>\n&gt; disconnections and crashes, which he didn&#39;t address.  But, <br/>\n&gt; still, tis a good <br/>\n&gt; read and thoughtfully written.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; Are you hogging all the fun?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Friends tell friends about ONElist!<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; This list is intended for the trade of Spell components for <br/>\n&gt; spell research.
