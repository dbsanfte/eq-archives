There was a wizard(I believe that was<br/>\n&gt;his class) on Povar by the name of Yabin who is notorious for stealing<br/>\n&gt;kills.  Several people reported his activities by way of /petition and a GM<br/>\n&gt;answered all the complaints in a matter of minutes.  This wasn&#39;t one or two<br/>\n&gt;kills but literally everything that moved that might give him experience.<br/>\n&gt;He would cast twice at it and run off to find something else.  Those two<br/>\n&gt;spells did more than half damage to the creature so eventually when it was<br/>\n&gt;killed he got the experience.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If someone is ruining your play experience like that person you can at<br/>\n </span></blockquote>least<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;help the GMs be aware of the problem by /petition ing and making a<br/>\n&gt;complaint.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Shawn<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:VorteksJRC@...\">VorteksJRC@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:VorteksJRC@...\">VorteksJRC@...</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Enchanters aren&#39;t supposed to be good at DD.
