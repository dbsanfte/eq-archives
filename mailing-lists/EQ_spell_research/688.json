You can find the paterns at the first inn<br/>\nin north ro comming from freeport.  For the skins that you need.  Your<br/>\ngoing to have to kill ALOT of bears, and I mean ALOT.  I follow the ONEList<br/>\nfor tailors as well.  Generally finding one High Quality Bear SKIN in a<br/>\nfull day of killing bears is doing pretty good.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt a Tailoring skill of 30, you can expect to succede about 1 in 5.  At a<br/>\nskill of 60 you should get success about 50% of the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry this is so off topic I just wanted to get it answerd and gone.
