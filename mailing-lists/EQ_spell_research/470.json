Then make a plan to notify the other<br/>\nperson since they will be spaming themselves and will not see words, do a wave or jump. You want to do this after you see 2 improvements. So one person teaches on one side and the other person takes the other side.<br/>\n<br/>\nAshley Dunn wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Ashley Dunn&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:asdunn1@...\">asdunn1@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Tom, how do you improve a language without learning from someone who is<br/>\n&gt; excellent? In other words, how would two average speakers of Old Erudian<br/>\n&gt; work their language skill up? Someone told me that we should group, spam<br/>\n&gt; each other, get two improves, then zone.
