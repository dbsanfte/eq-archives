There is going to be<br/>\na lot of helpfull people leaving our list as soon as they are good with<br/>\nreseach and languages. The reason is simple,one has only to look at the<br/>\nemails we r getting from this list from people who do refuse to abide by<br/>\nthe rules.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe end result is predictable, most of the knowledgeable people will<br/>\nleave if they havent done so already,instead of hanging around helping<br/>\nothers. After all who wants to sort thu 60 spam emails,and if lucky<br/>\nmaybe find a couple related to research.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBull</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
