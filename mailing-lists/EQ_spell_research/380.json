Verant is so hypocritical in doing this that&#39;s it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;insulting. Why shouldn&#39;t we be upset, why shouldn&#39;t we expect more,<br/>\n&gt;fight for more, or at least what they claimed they would provide?<br/>\n&gt;\tAs for sitting around on 7th level for six months reminds me of our<br/>\n&gt;neighbors young boy who happens to have Down Syndrome.. No knocking the<br/>\n&gt;kid he has a big heart, but he also has been trying to learn<br/>\n&gt;multiplication for the last 3 years!. Who the hell wants to stay on one<br/>\n&gt;cheesy level for more than 20hrs? think about it 20hrs is playing every<br/>\n&gt;night four 4 hours? now if you don&#39;t have a family or a life of some<br/>\n&gt;sort you may have the time to just vegge out on 8th or ninth level for a<br/>\n&gt;year. I however do not, I want to eventualy see everything EQ has to<br/>\n&gt;offer I would like to play all of the classes to 50th level. Think about<br/>\n&gt;it at the &quot;Todd&quot;(the kid next door)like pace your talking about<br/>\n&gt;advancing it would take you 7 YEARS! of continuous play to attain 50th<br/>\n&gt;level, with the time involved doing that you could have attained a<br/>\n&gt;Master&#39;s Degree. Not to mention a staggering 100 Years to play all of<br/>\n&gt;the classes to 50th. Come on people who wants to sit in front of their<br/>\n&gt;PC and constantly be struggling and never having enough? Not me, not me.<br/>\n&gt;Besides if you want to be weak and modest don&#39;t play to gain exp. play<br/>\n&gt;to role play. Heck or Play some good O&#39;l D&D around the Dinner table<br/>\n&gt;with friends. But don&#39;t complain about how easy it is to have fun and<br/>\n&gt;advance.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Vastad,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;PS,<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;ll leave it at that. I apologize & I am aware that this is not the<br/>\n&gt;proper place for this, I just saw the comment and it made me go there.<br/>\n&gt;Sorry but that&#39;s just how I feel & I KNOW I&#39;m not alone... EQ is a big<br/>\n&gt;game with many servers, mabey have different types of servers. Like a<br/>\n&gt;&quot;Todd&quot; server for those people that have the next 20 years free to play.<br/>\n&gt;And a fun server with quicker advancement better skills and less<br/>\n&gt;&quot;cheased&quot; down spells. I think we can all get along.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Looking to expand your world?<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;ONElist has nearly 150,000 e-mail communities from which to chose!<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;This list is intended for the trade of Spell components for spell research. <br/>\n&gt;  Please keep the emails on topic.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have one thing to say.
