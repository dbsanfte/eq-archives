(sorry I forgot his name).  There are<br/>\nspells that can not be bought for all classes.  Whos to say that they are<br/>\nlisted in those books.  He did say that once the mysterious spells were<br/>\ndiscovered by  many others they may eventually become sold on vendors.  He<br/>\nalso said that they did some pretty nice things.  I am assuming that it<br/>\nworks this way for all classes and not just magicians.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLomack, Knight Defender of the BCK<br/>\nMaster of Recruiting<br/>\nwww.bck.org<br/>\n&quot;The Crimson Knights&quot;<br/>\nFennin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
