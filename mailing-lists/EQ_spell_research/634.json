So you can&#39;t target the spell.  My guess<br/>\nis that Verant just screwed it up.  I will email them about it, if we want<br/>\nto get their attention, we could all do it.  It looks to me like it would<br/>\nbe a VERY easy fix, assuming the server doesn&#39;t have to be modified as<br/>\nwell.  It is a single byte in the file that needs to be changed.<br/>\n<br/>\nchpicker<br/>\nMinister of Commerce, OCD<br/>\nVeeshan<br/>\n----end original message-----<br/>\n<br/>\nWhooo hooo. FINALLY someone else who even acknowledges that it&#39;s broken ;)   The typical response i get from people is... Flare? why even bother, it&#39;s a useless spell.... well personally i LIKE that spell (handy for leading friends to you in large outdoor zones)   Not to mention that 4th of July is coming up.. where would we all be without a little fireworks :) <br/>\n<br/>\nMeraxes Glibilskym, Fennin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
