Besides we&#39;re WAY off topic now anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBasically, his arguement is that a group of necromancers can do<br/>\nsomething no other group can do.  My arguement is that any group should be<br/>\nable to do it, or there should be other penalties.  I certainly think 6<br/>\nlevel 20 people should definitely give a level 40 mob a run for its money.<br/>\nAnd i think if 6 wizards tried this they would probably die without tank<br/>\nsupport (or find six warriors to stand there and die horribly).  I<br/>\ndefinitely think that 6 magicians with pet support should give a griffin as<br/>\nbig a run for its money as 6 necromancers, but not so easily, magicians are<br/>\nless frontline type of spellcasters and a lot more support and utility type.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWhat would I like to see?  I&#39;d like to see unique monsters be able<br/>\nto do other things.  Why is the griffin bothering with our skeletons when it<br/>\nshould know who the REAL threat is five seconds into combat.  Or maybe it<br/>\nknows its outgunned and calls out to its brother across the zone who now<br/>\nhauls arse across the zone to trash us OOM spellcasters?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMy arguement is necromancers aren&#39;t overpowered, we take a unique<br/>\nplace in Norrath as being quite powerful battle spellcasters with our own<br/>\nbodyguards.  We also have to deal with the myriad of social problems that<br/>\nbeing a necromancer comes with, and there are a LOT of those believe me, and<br/>\nwe have some serious deficiencies in other areas.  You won&#39;t see the six<br/>\nnecromancer group do NEARLY as well when hit by a train of elf skeletons and<br/>\nnecro theurgists, or by a group of Aviak guards.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tDon&#39;t downgrade the necromancers, fix the problems with the other<br/>\nclasses and make the combat AI better and general combat better for such<br/>\nhigh level monsters.<br/>\n<br/>\nMalark on Karana<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Lakecya Smith [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:widdowsson@...\">widdowsson@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, May 19, 1999 4:00 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_spell_research@onelist.com\">EQ_spell_research@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EQ_spell_research] Enchanters and Research (Bersker Str)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Lakecya Smith &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:widdowsson@...\">widdowsson@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Trev wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m amazed you could get spells through on a Griffon or HG <br/>\n&gt; at that level. Both of these are level 30+ monsters. <br/>\n&gt; Accordingly I wouldn&#39;t think a level 18-20 group should be <br/>\n&gt; able to get one spell through. Certainly with my Wizard if <br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s more that a couple levels higher than me I don&#39;t even <br/>\n&gt; bother casting as it will get resisted fully.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Unless I misread your post, I think it only prudent that <br/>\n&gt; Verant change this. There&#39;s no way a group of 18-20 lvl <br/>\n&gt; players, regardless of class, should be taking down monsters <br/>\n&gt; that are double their level. That&#39;s a tad extreme.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Trev<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  Oh my god I think I&#39;m haveing a coniption (Must.... <br/>\n&gt; control.. Fist of ....DEATH!) Why on earth (or Norrath for <br/>\n&gt; that matter) would you support Verant makeing it even harder <br/>\n&gt; for people to advance and have fun. By saying something as <br/>\n&gt; innane and anal as that, you stifle team work and the desire <br/>\n&gt; and adventure to try something more. To be dareing & <br/>\n&gt; adventurious is that not what it&#39;s all about? People like you <br/>\n&gt; who condone such changes that FURTHER hamper the fun, ease, <br/>\n&gt; and playabilty for gamers should be forced to play Smurf <br/>\n&gt; warriors in Splitpaw or something. See, what retarted petty <br/>\n&gt; people like you forget is WE PAY VERANT&#39;S BILLS. and thus the <br/>\n&gt; game should be free of the kind of asinine restrictions that <br/>\n&gt; you would have further placed upon the game. Futher more, you <br/>\n&gt; say that it&#39;s unreasonable that a party of 18-20th level char <br/>\n&gt; take down a level 30 creature?!?!?! IDIOT!, If your a grown <br/>\n&gt; man (which I highly doubt) and 6 trained 12 yr olds come at <br/>\n&gt; you with sharpened Katanas (not to me!<br/>\n&gt; ntion SPELLS!) they would kill you even if you did have a <br/>\n&gt; sword you would be swarmed and KILLED, as would a lion or <br/>\n&gt; even bear sure 1 or 2 may die (as char commonly do in the <br/>\n&gt; aformentioned sitiuation. but the higher level tougher <br/>\n&gt; creature WOULD DIE!. So take your petty, anal, Triffling <br/>\n&gt; mentality, that would have us all struggleing even more for <br/>\n&gt; the modest exp we can already just barely gain, To Hell (or <br/>\n&gt; Lavastorm in a pinch) and DIE!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We need not further restrictions but, benefits to make it more fun,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The Widows Son,<br/>\n&gt; Vastad<br/>\n&gt; Enchanter Cazic -Thule<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; Having difficulty getting &quot;in synch&quot; with list members? <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Try ONElist&#39;s Shared Calendar to organize events, meetings and more!<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; This list is intended for the trade of Spell components for <br/>\n&gt; spell research.
