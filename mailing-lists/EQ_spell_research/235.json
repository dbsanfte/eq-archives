You can only research spells of your class, this comes from GZ, the arch <br/>\nmage of magick in EQ, so you should accept it as the gospel in regards to <br/>\nthis question on research.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. When you put one point into research at level 16 you actually get 16 <br/>\npoints, that is why you don&#39;t see a skill increase for 2-15 because you are <br/>\nalready at 16. This only works on a skill you have a zero in, any skill that <br/>\nhas a zero gets the # of points = to your current level, so if you get a new <br/>\nlangague option that you have a zero skill in you will get an equal amount <br/>\nof points equal to your current level, so it&#39;s best to wait to level 20 to <br/>\nput your points into research/langauges you have zero skill in since you&#39;ll <br/>\nget 20 points for your one points instead of 16.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have no idea if you can research a spell for your class and sell it to <br/>\nanother member of your class, would be nice to know as I plan to use <br/>\nresearch as money making skill as I know many people see research as a <br/>\nheadache and would gladly pay a big surcharge so as to avoid learning four <br/>\ndifferent languages and searching high and low for components.<br/>\n<br/>\nqq<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
