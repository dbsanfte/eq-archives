First off, yeah<br/>\nI think LifeDrain being totally unresisted might be a bug, but really you<br/>\nhave to look at its usefullness.  Its one of the most mana inefficent spells<br/>\nwe have.  Everything else gets resisted as ususal.  Basically it was us<br/>\nusing our fearless skeleton pets to occupy it long enough for us to cast a<br/>\nMASS of LifeDrains on it.  It works fairly well on Griffins (level 28-32 I<br/>\nbelieve) and about 60% of the time we could take a Hill Giant (level 38-42<br/>\nor so).<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSecond of all, I don&#39;t see why it doesn&#39;t work both ways.  At level<br/>\n18 if 6 gnoll guards (level 10 or so) attacked me I&#39;d get floored, maybe it<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t happen to a warrior, but conversely if a level 20 Warrior was<br/>\noccupied with 6 necro pets fighting off six acolytes he&#39;d probably die.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI know its the not the same moving from PC to NPC, because we KNOW<br/>\nhow to group up and use tactics while the AI is very poor at this.  There<br/>\nare differences, but I think I would see as we all get higher of level, the<br/>\n&quot;resistance&quot; area should broaden, meaning that we can cast better on higher<br/>\nlevel monsters and lower level still can still affect us.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tIs it buggy?  Probably to an extent.  Or maybe its everyone else&#39;s<br/>\nspells are buggy because they get resisted too much?  Maybe Verant couldn&#39;t<br/>\nmake the AI do back to the PCs what the PCs could do to the AI?  Sheesh, who<br/>\nknows?  I think that probably LifeDrain should take a resistance hit but I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think any direct damage spell should truly be resisted, but should<br/>\njust lose strength.<br/>\n<br/>\nMalark on Karana<br/>\n<br/>\nPS - And don&#39;t think killing a griffin is great experience.  Splitting it up<br/>\nsix ways with similar level necros gave me less than an eighth of a bubble<br/>\nof XP, which means all the time we spent waiting, fighting, then medding or<br/>\ncollecting corpses (dont&#39; forget griffs and HGs are 24 hours spawns, so<br/>\nafter you kill the two wandering around you have to wait an hour and a half)<br/>\nI could&#39;ve gained a level fighting crocs. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tmyler@...\">tmyler@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tmyler@...\">tmyler@...</a>] <br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tWednesday, May 19, 1999 1:18 PM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_spell_research@onelist.com\">EQ_spell_research@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject:\tRE: [EQ_spell_research] Enchanters and Research (Bersker<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Str)<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m amazed you could get spells through on a Griffon or HG at that level.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Both of these are level 30+ monsters.
