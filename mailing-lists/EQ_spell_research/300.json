Not<br/>\namazing, just the fact that your spells aren&#39;t resisted. All of my necro<br/>\nfriends, higher than those you mentioned, don&#39;t do this because it&#39;s cheap,<br/>\nboring (it takes forever to kill a level 30+ monster at low level), and they<br/>\nknow they really aren&#39;t getting the kill so it&#39;s no satisfaction for them.<br/>\n<br/>\n    I read today that you can&#39;t get level 24+ Magician pets until they fix<br/>\nit. The fix will be either the research involved in getting these pets, or<br/>\nadding shops that will just sell them. I&#39;d imagine they would add shops<br/>\nsince the 24 pets are documented in spell lists not as &quot;Mist Elemental&quot; and<br/>\nwhat not, but who knows. I have spent 3 levels in South Karana trying to get<br/>\naviak feathers, so it&#39;s safe to say your chances of getting them there are<br/>\nslim. I also read about a vendor in a locked hut and a Minotaur vendor in<br/>\nsouth karana, supposedly mage releated. Does anyone know about this?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
