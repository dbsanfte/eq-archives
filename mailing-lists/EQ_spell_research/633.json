I am a lvl 24 Magi and Identify works like this.<br/>\nHold one of your spell books on the cursor and cast.  It will tell you what<br/>\nlang you need for that book to read it.  Sense summoned I used all the time<br/>\nin LavaStorm & Najena, Unrest etc.  It lets you know if any summoned<br/>\ncreatures are around...this includes pets.<br/>\n<br/>\n----ORIGINAL MESSAGE----<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\tI have seen them slowly increasing the functionality of the identify spell... i had no idea it could word on spellbooks (this is totally different from the original concept of the spell)..<br/>\nI heard this was gonna reveal the LORE of the item (storyline etc...) once they finish it.. but i&#39;m not sure if it&#39;d even be worth it unless they include the LORE info in some quests or other things.. sure story is nice to have..but unless the item is UNIQUE , seeing the same story time and time again is just boring :(<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for sense summoned... i guess if you use the spell to HUNT summoned creatures, it might be usefull, but let me ask you a serious question,  In lavastorm- have you ever had TROUBLE finding a summoned creature?  They are crawling all over the place...  In Najena- there are NO random wondering summoned monsters so again this spell has very limited use, also keep in mind it sense THRU walls so the nearest is not necessarily the same as the first you come to..  and Unrest?  never seen a summoned creature in there? Is the ghost considered summoned? (would LOVE to be able to use my Dismiss Summon spell in unrest)<br/>\n<br/>\n Meraxes Glibilskym, Fennin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
