Which pure magic users can take on more <br/>\nthan one low level monster at once?  If you want to take on multiple low <br/>\nlevel creatures at once it sounds to me like you want to be a warrior.  Also <br/>\n6 necromancers vs one warrior is not fair.  Monster levels are diffrently <br/>\ncalculated.  For example a level 30 warrior cant take on a griffin by <br/>\nhimself.  Now on to more on topic matters:<br/>\n<br/>\nI had my Old Erudain skill level up to Excellent.  For some strange reason <br/>\nit dropped back to Very Good???  /tell and regular say has been proven to <br/>\nincrease language skill.  Just be close to the person.  If there is anyone <br/>\non Faydwer and on the Karana server please contact me if you can teach me <br/>\nOld Erudian to Excellent skill level again...  I am mostly on at Weekends <br/>\n(includes Fridays).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFyleow<br/>\nMagician of the 6th circle<br/>\nKarana Server<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
