Ok, thats fine, but here is what irks me. I realize that as an enchanter I am not expected to do the offense like wizards, magicians or even necros, Our prime directive is debuffing and buffing and we get some incredible spells. Here are my rants.<br/>\n            1. we don&#39;t get enought buff or debuff that only WE have. Why do other classes get beserker str? Thats unbeknownst to me.<br/>\n            2. Ok, i can understand perhaps them resisting our offensive dmg spells but how are we supposed to be a group debuffer if they resist all our spells? Even after using tashan or tashanii which also have a tendency to get resisted? Kinda makes us useless in that regard eh?<br/>\n     <br/>\n    Just a few things im kinda irked about...<br/>\n     <br/>\n     <br/>\n    Fondain De&#39;Illusion, Master Enchanter of the Amber Knights, Tarew Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
