I have about 7 words of Dominion but one of them won&#39;t stack with the<br/>\n&gt;  rest?  Is this bug from a word from before the stacking patch or is there<br/>\n&gt;  some other use for a non stacking word?<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>It may be a leftover bug.  if not, the NON stacking is for necro, but I <br/>\nbelieve it is a leftover bug.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  2. I have Words of Pacification and Words of Derivation.  Can someone tell<br/>\n&gt;  me what spells these are for?  I looked all over a few sites that have<br/>\n&gt;  research info and couldn&#39;t find either of these words listed.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Did you look at both Necromancer lists and Mage lists?  Both use words... so <br/>\nit could be for the other class if you are only looking at one.<br/>\n<br/>\nOtherwise... I would not put it past verant to have some useless words out <br/>\nthere... jsut to confuse matters :)  (I am not complaining here... I think it <br/>\nis not a bad idea... ads a little spice)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  3.  I have a Velishouls Tome Faded Page but it dosen&#39;t have a page number<br/>\n&gt;  associated with it.  I noticed on the lists that there are 2 versions of<br/>\n&gt;  Faded pages for Velishouls Tome.  One a page 16 and one a page 108.  Does<br/>\n&gt;  anyone know which version of the Faded page I have if it has no page <br/>\n </span></blockquote>number?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>may be a useless one :)  as I mentioned above.  or even possibly a mage <br/>\ncomponent?  (guessing here...)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  4.  I have Words of the Sentient but there appear to be two different types<br/>\n&gt;  one says &quot;A.... the other B....   (I put dots in to signifify that I can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;  remember the rest of the word.  But these A and B words are in parenthesies<br/>\n&gt;  after the name of the Page.  Any clue what each is for?  I know Words of<br/>\n&gt;  the Sentient are used for the Necro spell Restless Bones and Intensify<br/>\n&gt;  Death.  I assume one type is for each spell.  Can someone tell me which is<br/>\n&gt;  which?<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This one I am fairly certain is were there is one for Necromancers, one for <br/>\nMages.  as for which one is which, I do not ember, and you will have to try :(<br/>\n<br/>\nSonoroud Tomebinder, 24th level Necromancer, Veeshan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
