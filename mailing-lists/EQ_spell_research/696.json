I did the minor quests, recived the recepie book<br/>\nand the new book to combine items. So I thought I&#39;d try the simplest<br/>\nrunes before using the rarer components in the harder runes.<br/>\nTried Rune 1: Lapiz Lazuli, Bat Wing, Bone Chip. Items fail to combine<br/>\nin these quantities.<br/>\nAh, it mentioned needing a quill and parchment in the book. I buy both<br/>\nat guild, and try the same. Items fail to combine in these quantities.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I try the next: Turquoise, Fire Beetle Eye, and a Rusty slashing<br/>\nweapon. Same fail. Added quill and parchment, still same failure. Tried<br/>\nmany different slashing weapons. All fail.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo is it buggy, and did Verant really add this whole new piece to<br/>\nresearch without testing it in the slightest, even to attempt to make<br/>\none item? I have trouble believing even Verant would do that...so am I<br/>\nmissing something obvious? Would be interested to hear what kind of<br/>\nsuccess others have had with this new addition.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuil of Bertoxxulous</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
