Anyone know?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;        Lanax (Fennin Ro)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m given to understand that &quot;Identify Object&quot; spell may fix this, tho i<br/>\ncant say thru personal experience. There is also a faded map that can be<br/>\nfound at the cat isle between qey and Eru .. but was told the map was part<br/>\nof a quest. Perhaps i&#39;ll make a trip back there, get it, and see if Identify<br/>\ndoes anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was mentioned earlier that runes where tough to find. So far the best<br/>\nplace I&#39;ve gone for lower levels to find these things soloing is the<br/>\nscarecrows. However, there are only a few of them and if many people camp<br/>\nthe fields it&#39;s next to impossible to find them cause they dont loot runes,<br/>\nwords, and pages all that often. In my experience Words were most often<br/>\nlooted, followed by pages, and then runes, but with the rarity of finding<br/>\nthese, it&#39;s possible that my findings where just random and may not be<br/>\nvalid.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd finaly a question was raised about which classes uses what. As far as i<br/>\ncan understand, Runes go to Wizards, Words go to Necro&#39;s, and pages go to<br/>\nEnchanters. Someone please step forward and correct me if I&#39;m wrong.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
