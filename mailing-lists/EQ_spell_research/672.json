Not very<br/>\n&gt;  often, but more often than runes anyway.<br/>\n&gt;  As for mages and necro words looking different, I agree it&#39;s a bit<br/>\n&gt;  confusing. I *think* (but am not sure at all) that mage words are<br/>\n&gt;  stackable and necro words aren&#39;t. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Nope.  As A necro I can tell you there are both stackable and non-stackable <br/>\nfor necros.  (not sure why this is...) so that is not the key.  It is just a <br/>\nmatter of figuring it out.  And maybe there is even some crossover (maybe <br/>\nwords of Dominion... the most common word I have found.  I have 14 of them, <br/>\nglad they stack!)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Either that or they forgot to make some<br/>\n&gt;  words stackable and those I checked matched that rule.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I do wish they made them all stackable!  I have been on a long quest for <br/>\nhandmade backpacks because of that... need all 70 slots in my locker to hold <br/>\nwords.
