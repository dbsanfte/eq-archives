Just like smiths can practice on rusty weapons, etc... however this particular spell requires a component that NO ONE that i have talked to can find, namely a &quot;Summon Element Scroll&quot;    Because every spell for magicians requires 3 things, 1) A word, 2) an item, 3) a previous spell..  and this spell has 1) Words of the element 2) Bloodstone and 3) SUMMON ELEMENT SCROLL.  that #3 MUST be a spell... one that is NOT in the game. <br/>\n\tI personally think that few people have brought this to Verants attention since the spell is purchasable and MOST of the magicians i&#39;ve seen would rather buy their spells than go to the trouble of making them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, anyone else notice that FLARE no longer works?  That makes what 4 spells that are completly usless to us??<br/>\n\t1) Identify<br/>\n\t2) Sense Magic<br/>\n\t3) Sense Summoned (practically usless in it&#39;s current form)<br/>\n\t4) Flare (since most recent patch)<br/>\n<br/>\nanyone find any other spells not working at all? or as intended?<br/>\n<br/>\nMeraxes Glibilskym, Fennin Ro. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
