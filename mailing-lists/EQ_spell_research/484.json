I also speak all race languages, Thieve&#39;s Cant, the 4 magical you know, and several MOB languages all to excellent. The Magical language you are missing is rumored to be Old/Elder Dragon, well if monks<br/>\ngot Dragon at 30 possibly they may get Old Dragon at 40. On my server, Innoruuk, the highest monk in 36 so I am only guess at level and class. One more thing I want to throw in to toot my own horn I can&#39;t read Ipsor&#39;s Enlightenment # whatever<br/>\nbecause I did all this and I am a level 7 Gnome Wizard so I am a long way from research, also one quick question seems all races except Gnomes get stuck, Elder Elvish/OE at Very Good and Elder Teir&#39;dal/Combine at Good (doing zone trick), any<br/>\nexperience with this?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLomack wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Lomack &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lomack@...\">lomack@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ok does anyone know what language is required to read Ipsor&#39;s Enlightenment<br/>\n&gt; IV (or maybe its V I forget but its the only other one sold in Freeport)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am now Excelent in 23 languages.

All 23 but<br/>\n&gt; I still cant read that book.  Do I need to work each language up to<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Master&quot; or is there another Language out there that no one knows about yet?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Long Live the Brotherhood,<br/>\n&gt; Lomack, BCK-MoR<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
