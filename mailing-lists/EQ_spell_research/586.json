There was a wizard(I believe that was<br/>\nhis class) on Povar by the name of Yabin who is notorious for stealing<br/>\nkills.  Several people reported his activities by way of /petition and a GM<br/>\nanswered all the complaints in a matter of minutes.  This wasn&#39;t one or two<br/>\nkills but literally everything that moved that might give him experience.<br/>\nHe would cast twice at it and run off to find something else.  Those two<br/>\nspells did more than half damage to the creature so eventually when it was<br/>\nkilled he got the experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone is ruining your play experience like that person you can at least<br/>\nhelp the GMs be aware of the problem by /petition ing and making a<br/>\ncomplaint.<br/>\n<br/>\nShawn<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Magis [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Magis@...\">Magis@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, June 17, 1999 11:43 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_spell_research@onelist.com\">EQ_spell_research@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ_spell_research] Wizards being resisted<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Magis &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Magis@...\">Magis@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:VorteksJRC@...\">VorteksJRC@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:VorteksJRC@...\">VorteksJRC@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Enchanters aren&#39;t supposed to be good at DD.
