It is remarkably similar to this place in many ways.  It is also<br/>\ndifferent in many ways.  I have seen people (Troll Warr to be specific) jet<br/>\nto 40+ level in under 2 months.. while meanwhile myself and experienced<br/>\nplayer was on for over 20 years and only made 36th.  There are a lot of<br/>\nfactors in leveling and I almost guarantee he was a beta tester.<br/>\n<br/>\nSiz<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Tony Williams &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:vincedis@...\">vincedis@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_spell_research@onelist.com\">EQ_spell_research@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_spell_research@onelist.com\">EQ_spell_research@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Wednesday, May 19, 1999 3:57 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ_spell_research] Enchanters and Research (Bersker Str)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Tony Williams &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:vincedis@...\">vincedis@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m with Trev on this one.

The highest<br/>\ncharacters that had been playing for a while were 16th and 17th level. if<br/>\nyou got to level 10 you were a really good player. level 7 was a reasonable<br/>\nachievement for 6 months of play. Why do you want to have a lv 50 char?<br/>\nThere shouldn&#39;t be any level 40 chars for at least 2 years. The fact that I<br/>\nsaw a lv 42 character on Ebay for sale I think is rediculous. the fact that<br/>\nsomeone is willing to pay thousands of dollars for such a char is even more<br/>\nso. Are you one of the ones that used the trainers and hacked items in<br/>\nDiablo? I don&#39;t want this game to be a flash in the pan. It should be very<br/>\nhard to reach the higher levels and even harder to keep them(ie you die you<br/>\nlose 3 or 4 levels) Just because you pay to play doesn&#39;t mean you should<br/>\nautomatically win. please try to keep in mind that some people like a<br/>\nchalange and some are willing to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;face it no matter how difficult.

If you continue to pester Verant with things like this<br/>\nthey will eventually break down and everyone will have flowing black robes<br/>\nand skull fanged stiletto&#39;s. I wish there were more people out there like<br/>\nTrev willing to stand up for the AI and say hey this is too easy give me my<br/>\nmoneys worth. If fun for you is simply more power then the true meaning of<br/>\nRole Playing has eluded you. may the gameing gods have mercy on your soul.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;Vincedis<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;PS Yes the wiz spell flight is simply a levetate scroll. the one that is<br/>\n </span></blockquote>made through research can only be scribed by wizards where as the one you<br/>\nbuy can be scribed by a few classes. other than that it is the same.

See, what retarted<br/>\npetty people like you forget is WE PAY VERANT&#39;S BILLS. and thus the game<br/>\nshould be free of the kind of asinine restrictions that you would have<br/>\nfurther placed upon the game. .....
