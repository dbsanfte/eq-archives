HA HA HA HA HA<br/>\n&gt; HA HA!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Oh my, that was a good one Mikaela. *shakes head in<br/>\n&gt; friendly disbelief*<br/>\n&gt; :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Wixn, PLEASE don&#39;t go to Befallen until you are at<br/>\n&gt; least level 15, and<br/>\n&gt; have an experienced group with you. Even then, you<br/>\n&gt; will most likely find<br/>\n&gt; yourself spending many happy hours trying to recover<br/>\n&gt; your corpse. The<br/>\n&gt; problem is that you will quickly get bored with the<br/>\n&gt; first level, and<br/>\n&gt; will convince yourself that the lower levels can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; be all that bad.<br/>\n&gt; Well, they are. And the loot isn&#39;t all that great,<br/>\n&gt; either.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Trust me, I have many friends who swear they will<br/>\n&gt; never return to that<br/>\n&gt; place. And these people are good players.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Saidinn Witchwood<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; P.S. I know there are probably some of you out there<br/>\n&gt; who actually love<br/>\n&gt; Befallen, but PLEASE, can we at least agree that<br/>\n&gt; Wixl shouldn&#39;t go to<br/>\n&gt; Befallen until at least level 15?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; P.P.S No hard feelings, Mikaela :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Share your special moments with family and friends-<br/>\n&gt; send PHOTO Greetings<br/>\n&gt; at Zing.com!
