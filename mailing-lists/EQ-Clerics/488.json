Let me say this my base Wisdom was 89, with all the items I had that","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1780917915\">2 Extra bars of Mana????? I find that impossible, I have tested the Wisdom<br/>\nitem theory.  Let me say this my base Wisdom was 89, with all the items I<br/>\nhad that added wisdom, i was at 124.<br/>\nI conducted a test...I removed all of my Wisdom granting items so my wis was<br/>\n89. I began to cast Greater healing ( I did not fizzle) I was able to cast<br/>\nit 5 times( 150 per cast).....I then tried to cast Holy Might ( 35 per<br/>\ncast ) and was unbable to.....<br/>\n<br/>\nI then put all of my WIS items back on so my wis was 124 i once again cast<br/>\ngreater healing 5 times ( no fizzle 150 per cast)....with the BS MANA I had<br/>\nleft over i was able to cast ONE holy might (35 MANA) and one flash of light<br/>\n(12 MANA). SO, with this test i have decided that instead of using ALL my<br/>\nitem slots to try to bring up wisdom, which is a complete waste of time, I<br/>\nwould get some really good wis Items( like plus 6 wis ring, Adementite<br/>\nepolets, ETC) and i would replace some items with DEX, yes DEX increasings<br/>\nitems.<br/>\n<br/>\nDEX does directly affect your ability to cast while being hit, not to<br/>\nmention if you have a weapon that randomly casts an effect, DEX plays a<br/>\ngreat part in how Often it works.  I have seen it make a difference with our<br/>\nregular gnome wizard, who naturally has a high DEX( she is over 115)She can<br/>\nliterally cast almost any spell while being hit,I will estimate that she is<br/>\ninterrupted only 10% of the time, I have seen her Gate from terrible<br/>\nsituations while being completely pounded and my in-game husband, has found<br/>\ngreat success with his DEX over 105 now, Our Paladins DEX is 117, and even<br/>\nthough he has no DD spells, his Ghoulbane is much much more effective<br/>\nagainst the undead, My DEX is now 100 and I have seen a difference in my<br/>\ncasting, then gnome and I were medding in Soluseks eye ons day when someoen<br/>\ntrained a boat load of nasties by us, they took an extreme liking to me, I<br/>\nwas able to cast greater heal on myself 5 successive times without being<br/>\ninterrupted.<br/>\nSo, that is my rant, i feel very strongly about it, WIS is good don&#39;t get me<br/>\nwrong, but there will NEVER be a way to add enough wisdom to make a really<br/>\nbig difference in the Mana that I have. SO i sacfrifice a small amount of<br/>\nmana, while gaining a better ability to help people while in battle, I think<br/>\nthe trade off is fair. By the way,  Yes channeling is a great factor in<br/>\nrecovering as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nBree Wyndsdale<br/>\n36th Cleric of Fennin Ro<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Mystik &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mystik@...\">mystik@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Wednesday, July 14, 1999 8:02 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] Question about dexterity<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Mystik &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mystik@...\">mystik@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;well, me personally, i think it&#39;s channelling that helps you recover from<br/>\n </span></blockquote>being hit and still<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;casting.....i could be wrong, but i believe that&#39;s what it is....also,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>later on, it&#39;s<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;important to have as much mana as you can, so i&#39;d invest in wis adding<br/>\n </span></blockquote>items......believe me,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;that can go along way....for example, i died today &lt;yeah i know i&#39;m not<br/>\n </span></blockquote>supposed to do that,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;but it happens&gt;....well, when i got back and looted my corpse, from all the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>wis adding items<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;i have, it gave me 2 extra bars of mana....base wis 95 and with items,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>138....this was on lv<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;40, so it does make a difference<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Mystix Spellchaser<br/>\n&gt;lv 41 human/DE &lt;thanx to my new toy (; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;cleric of The Rathe<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Olli Haapam∩┐╜ki wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; From: Olli Haapam∩┐╜ki &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:olli.haapamaki@...\">olli.haapamaki@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I have question to you fellow clerics that would like to have a clear<br/>\n </span></blockquote>answer to.
