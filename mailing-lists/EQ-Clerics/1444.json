I was hoping to obtain some Mithril arms while fighting Fire<br/>\nGiants in SolB.  We bring down the proper mob that carries it, and I pray<br/>\nthat it has the arms.  It does, and I&#39;m given an option to loot it, and to<br/>\nmy horror clerics can&#39;t use it..  but Rogues can?!?<br/>\n<br/>\nSheesh, needless to say i was disappointed, and confused.  If a cleric can<br/>\nwear a Mithril Breastplate, why not let her wear the arms too?<br/>\n<br/>\n-Aosinator Lightbringer<br/>\n-Devout follower of Mithaniel Marr on The Rathe<br/>\n-- <br/>\n                               |&#92;      _,,,---,,_      <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:darshan@...\">darshan@...</a>   ZZZzz /,`.-&#39;`&#39;    -.  ;-;;,_   <br/>\n                              |,4-  ) )-,_. ,&#92; (  `&#39;-&#39;  <br/>\n                             &#39;---&#39;&#39;(_/--&#39;  `-&#39;&#92;_)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
