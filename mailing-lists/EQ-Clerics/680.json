Do you remember how simple 1.0 was?<br/>\nAnyway with capping the servers to 1000 would be sweet but that will never<br/>\nhappen.  It would casue to much trouble.  I wouldnt mind if they brought up<br/>\nnew servers that have a cap on it.  THere are way to many on the main<br/>\nservers ( oringinal beta )  Last night there  were close to 1800 on my<br/>\nserver (The Rathe)  There is no way they can cap that.  To many people would<br/>\nbe mad trying to get on those servers.  But rumor is that there is going to<br/>\nbe a quest that you can change servers which would be great.  <br/>\n<br/>\n\tQanin Skywanderer<br/>\n\tTHe Rathe 22nd circle<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: \tAzor[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jmaynus@...\">jmaynus@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: \tWednesday, July 28, 1999 1:07 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: \tRe: [EQ-Clerics] Oasis Warning<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Azor&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jmaynus@...\">jmaynus@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A cap might be nice but put it to low and you&#39;ll have a lot off ticked off<br/>\n&gt; people cause they can&#39;t get onto their server.  If that starts to happen<br/>\n&gt; we<br/>\n&gt; might see a lot of ppl quiting the game, ya I know less ppl playing means<br/>\n&gt; more places to hunt without fighting over who gets what kill and less lag.<br/>\n&gt; But thing about that less ppl playing (less money for Verant) less money<br/>\n&gt; for<br/>\n&gt; them could mean the end of EverQuest, I mean look at other games such as<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; Realm.  The Realm at first was a big game, but over time ppl got tired of<br/>\n&gt; it<br/>\n&gt; and they quit playing where is the Realm now?  It might still be there but<br/>\n&gt; how often is it updated, how many ppl are on there now to play with or<br/>\n&gt; against?  I like EQ about as much as the next person, but I have a feeling<br/>\n&gt; we won&#39;t see it around or as big as it is now for I&#39;d say 2-3 more years,<br/>\n&gt; with games such as Middle-Earth, Asherions Call and I&#39;ve heard of one more<br/>\n&gt; coming out.  If these 3 games hit it big a lot of ppl with switch from EQ<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; them, if they switch these 3 games to put an end to EQ.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; **************************<br/>\n&gt; Azor<br/>\n&gt; Lvl 18 Human Cleric of The Rathe<br/>\n&gt; **************************<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Lanadina the Magician&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lanadina@...\">lanadina@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I agree that the servers need to capped.
