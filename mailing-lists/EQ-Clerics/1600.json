Also - party members need to be pretty<br/>\nclose for this spell to work on everyone - works better in a dungeon than in<br/>\nfields as everyone is a little more clustered together.<br/>\n<br/>\nI used RTS up until about level 30 - when I finally was able to get observer<br/>\nstaff.  The quests for the testament of vanear and paw of opalla (both +wis<br/>\nhigher than observer staff) are extremely difficult for dark elf to obtain<br/>\nas they take place in the &quot;goody-goody&quot; race cities =)<br/>\n<br/>\nArmor-wise:  Bronze works in a pinch but is TOOOOO heavy.  Steel is lighter<br/>\nand same AC as bronze, but you really should be trying to get the items with<br/>\n+wis stats such as gator scale leggings, BS tunic, mammoth hide cloak,<br/>\nadamantite epolets (shoulder slot) etc.  You might look a little newbie-ish<br/>\nbut the +wis is necessary for cleric.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my opinions :)<br/>\n<br/>\nSirensa</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
