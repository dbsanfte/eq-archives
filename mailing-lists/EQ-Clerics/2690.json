No problem, as I am swimming over there,<br/>\nthe cleric decides to log, but in passing mentions if I see Gull 5 mins<br/>\nafter he logs, I owe him 1000pp.  Well, of course I laughed, I knew how hard<br/>\nthe Gull camp was.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, low and behold, after reaching the island, I killed no more than 3<br/>\nAviaks, and guess who I saw?  I got luckier with the bracers of the reverent<br/>\nI think got both of them in about 4 hours, I&#39;ve heard people have a hard<br/>\ntime with that one too.  The only parts I haev problems with are gloves and<br/>\nchestplate.  Chestplate is obvious, I&#39;m competing with every druid on my<br/>\nserver, the gloves, I&#39;ve seen Babbinsbort PH now 3 times, never seen him,<br/>\nthat sucks, so I can understand frustration on these camps, hopefully they<br/>\nwill fix soon!<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Jeff Portwine [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jdport@...\">jdport@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, January 26, 2000 9:27 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] Camping Gull<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Jeff Portwine&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jdport@...\">jdport@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the information I&#39;ve gathered about Gull, but it&#39;s possible that<br/>\nit&#39;s wrong... but I think it&#39;s right.   Reguardless it sure hasn&#39;t helped me<br/>\nget him... Gull is I think the hardest camp of all of them.  At least all<br/>\nI&#39;ve done so far (i haven&#39;t done the bracers or the Glacial Bear yet).<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are 14 regular aviak spawns on the island.<br/>\nThere is a 15th one that spawns rarely... I&#39;ve been told it spawns<br/>\nevery 8 hours, but I cannot verify this.   I can however verify that there<br/>\nare in fact 14 spawns and rarely a 15th one.  I just can&#39;t verify the spawn<br/>\ntime on it.  The 15th spawn is on occasion Gull... but very very rarely.<br/>\nI&#39;ve been told that this spawn spot will change every 8 hours even if nobody<br/>\nkills the place holder.  I&#39;ve also been told that if you have a ranger on<br/>\nthe island tracking, the placeholer will always be the last bird on the<br/>\nlist.    The person who told me this said that he knew of at least 2<br/>\ninstances where Gull had spawned when nobody was on the island.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is all I know... I&#39;ve been trying for Gull a LONG time and have had<br/>\nabsolutely zero success with it.    Sometimes i wonder if he really exists.<br/>\n<br/>\nEachann Bronzeleaf<br/>\nCleric of Tunare, Tarew Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Paul Heenan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pheenan@...\">pheenan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&#39; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Wednesday, January 26, 2000 11:11 AM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [EQ-Clerics] Camping Gull<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Paul Heenan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pheenan@...\">pheenan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; From: &quot;Don Sheppard&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dshep@...\">dshep@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; How often does he spawn?<br/>\n&gt; 7 hours or so<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;   Do you have to kill other aviaks to get him to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; spawn?<br/>\n&gt; Yes.
