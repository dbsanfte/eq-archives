I&#39;m not suggesting it should be cleric only, but if it were we would be the envy of Norrath.. lol.    I would love to see a piece of armor similar to the Rubicite Breast Plate which instead of having a healing Aura would instead have an &quot;aura of clarity&quot; (for lack of a better term) and would help replenish manA.   This would be an incredible piece of armor for a druid, cleric, or shaman... even for a ranger or Paladin, though I imagine rangers and Paladins would normally opt for higher AC and or HP.    I don&#39;t know if anything like this will ever happen, it may be considered too unbalancing... I would love to see it though.  I think that would be as highly sought out (and should be as difficult to get!) as the jboots...   <br/>\n<br/>\nEachann Bronzeleaf<br/>\nCleric of Tunare, Tarew Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: Anne O &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:topaaz1@...\">topaaz1@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, November 30, 1999 11:37 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] Cleric Sit-in<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Anne O&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:topaaz1@...\">topaaz1@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; here here, well said Jeff, i agree i want more wisdom.  i refuse to do the <br/>\n&gt; quests, as far as im concerned AAC is useless to me in comparison to the <br/>\n&gt; wisdom i need, legs with intel=rediculas!!! plain and simple.....<br/>\n&gt; topaaz<br/>\n&gt; xegony<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Jeff Portwine&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jdport@...\">jdport@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Subject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] Cleric Sit-in<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Date: Tue, 30 Nov 1999 09:34:17 -0500<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&lt;&lt; text2.html &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&lt;&lt; text3.html &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
