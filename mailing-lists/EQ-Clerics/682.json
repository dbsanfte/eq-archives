There has got to be a way to control the<br/>\nservers but without the caps.  And if they do cap it, I think people<br/>\nshould have the option to be allowed to permanently move their<br/>\ncharacter to a less populated server.  But, it should be OPTIONAL to<br/>\nmove.  A forced move is just not fair.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with your statements about the realm.  I am an ex realmie.  I<br/>\nremember before EQ even went into beta.  The Realm put a server cap on<br/>\nit.  I would wait for over an hour just trying to get in, or wait in<br/>\nline trying to get in.  Then, I would have to wait even longer for my<br/>\nfriends to be able to log in.  It was horrible and I was extremely<br/>\nupset about it.  The realm lacked updates, and just before I left, it<br/>\nlacked a staff period!  We were on our own.  Hackers got control and<br/>\nthe servers would be down for days.  I dont think this is gonna happen<br/>\nin EQ though, they seem to be competent.  It&#39;s a well publicized game<br/>\nalso, unlike The Realm.  The realm was only available by mail order<br/>\nthrough sierra&#39;s catalog.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case, a cap would have it&#39;s advantages, it would also have alot<br/>\nof drawbacks.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdira<br/>\nHigh Elf Bandaid<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Azor &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jmaynus@...\">jmaynus@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Azor&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jmaynus@...\">jmaynus@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A cap might be nice but put it to low and you&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; have a lot off ticked off<br/>\n&gt; people cause they can&#39;t get onto their server.  If<br/>\n&gt; that starts to happen we<br/>\n&gt; might see a lot of ppl quiting the game, ya I know<br/>\n&gt; less ppl playing means<br/>\n&gt; more places to hunt without fighting over who gets<br/>\n&gt; what kill and less lag.<br/>\n&gt; But thing about that less ppl playing (less money<br/>\n&gt; for Verant) less money for<br/>\n&gt; them could mean the end of EverQuest, I mean look at<br/>\n&gt; other games such as the<br/>\n&gt; Realm.  The Realm at first was a big game, but over<br/>\n&gt; time ppl got tired of it<br/>\n&gt; and they quit playing where is the Realm now?  It<br/>\n&gt; might still be there but<br/>\n&gt; how often is it updated, how many ppl are on there<br/>\n&gt; now to play with or<br/>\n&gt; against?  I like EQ about as much as the next<br/>\n&gt; person, but I have a feeling<br/>\n&gt; we won&#39;t see it around or as big as it is now for<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d say 2-3 more years,<br/>\n&gt; with games such as Middle-Earth, Asherions Call and<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve heard of one more<br/>\n&gt; coming out.  If these 3 games hit it big a lot of<br/>\n&gt; ppl with switch from EQ to<br/>\n&gt; them, if they switch these 3 games to put an end to<br/>\n&gt; EQ.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; **************************<br/>\n&gt; Azor<br/>\n&gt; Lvl 18 Human Cleric of The Rathe<br/>\n&gt; **************************<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_____________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nFree instant messaging and more at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://messenger.yahoo.com\">http://messenger.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
