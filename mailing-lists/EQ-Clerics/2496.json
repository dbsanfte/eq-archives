Before that I had picked up loads of small bronze in<br/>\nUnrest.  Anyway I&#39;ve been trying to sell this stuff off but not really<br/>\nhad much success..  It&#39;s possible that because I&#39;m from the UK and play<br/>\nUK evenings I only have a smaller playerbase to sell to but by the end<br/>\nof the evening the server is normally upto 1000-1300 players..  I&#39;ve<br/>\nended up giving the stuff away to low level DE clerics (I like to help<br/>\nDE clerics since there are so few of us).<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally it&#39;s just not worth the time I need to spend trying to sell<br/>\nthe stuff.. perhaps if I collected enough and went to somewhere like<br/>\nQeynos/Qeynos Hills/West Karana, I might be able to sell a lot of the<br/>\nmedium bronze.. but again it&#39;s taking the time to do the trip..<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Dyfed, Erollisi Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Vinamin L&#39;Crit<br/>\nLvl 36 DE Cleric<br/>\nErollisi Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
