If you go thru the door across from the secret door, go thru that room, you go over a pile of dirt in the doorway.  This leaves you in a room where if you looks left, there is a corner missing..  anyways, go thru the door to the left.  Inside that room, is a pillar fallen on its side.  Babbin spawns behind that fallen pillar, it is a 7 hour 5 minute spawn.  I killed about 12 placehgolders before he popped, but then he spawned twice in a row...go figure.<br/>\n<br/>\nAzuur<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    -----Original Messa<br/>\n    Gloves:  Where in befallen does Babbinsbort spawn?
