Might be<br/>\nsmall bonuses for casters, poisoning ones and only hit by magic<br/>\nweapon ones etc. But probably very minor. What people don&#39;t<br/>\noften remember is that every second off battle causes every second<br/>\nin battle to have only half xp/time. Even if you kill that white/yellow<br/>\nevery 5mins it probably won&#39;t compare to killing 2 high blues. But<br/>\ndepends with what class you play. As bard I could almost totally<br/>\neliminate down time if I found a suitable area and wanted to. I can<br/>\nfirst melee a mob down, if taken damage start next one by kiting<br/>\nand healing at the same time, so forth. I mostly either took blue<br/>\nafter blue after blue (even greens that gave exp), or kited 3<br/>\nany xp giving monsters up to yellows around.. at the same time =P<br/>\nBut finding places with enough bard-kitable monsters is hard.<br/>\n<br/>\n  For cleric, as low levels the classes don&#39;t have HUGE differences<br/>\nin melee ability, get a great weapon and start doing blues, preferably<br/>\nundead of course, with the occasional spell thrown in for damage.<br/>\nBit higher up maybe high blues with spells and melee mix. I doubt<br/>\nsoloing yellows is really that great for anyone but the pet classes,<br/>\nwhich actually are a group of 2. And probably they would also be<br/>\nbetter off with mowing down blues, where you can rely more on pet<br/>\nand have much less downtime.<br/>\n<br/>\n  All of above said without any experience in playing a cleric, so<br/>\nI suggest you to ignore it, or try it out and test and give results<br/>\nhow it goes. No idea if it works for clerics =)<br/>\n<br/>\n    - Ilkka Salmenkaita, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:isalmen@...\">isalmen@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
