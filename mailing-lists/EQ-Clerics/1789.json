I was<br/>\nearlier under the impression that the place holder roamed lvl three<br/>\ncause I&#39;ve killed it while camping a spot that was out of the way.  I<br/>\nwould lend support to the theory that it takes up a stationary residence<br/>\nat a random spot on lvl 3.<br/>\n<br/>\nKnowing the locations of the spawns on lvl three I have noticed<br/>\nirregularaties which I now believe to be the Gynok placeholder.  Knowing<br/>\nwhat i have learned from these posts I don&#39;t believe it is necessary to<br/>\nclear lvl 3 to kill the placeholder.  I think I&#39;d have a good chance at<br/>\nsniping the culprit.  If you don&#39;t know the floor, two spawns that are<br/>\nstanding unusually close to each other are is a good place to start.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have never been in Befallen to camp Gynok but my 29 Druid has two<br/>\nkills while my Cleric was getting to lvl 20 in Befallen.  The 29 Druid<br/>\npretty much had the run of the place except for the odd Ghoul and<br/>\nThaumalurgist that wanted a piece.  Those Thaumalurgists are nasty.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbnuo, 27 Cleric on the Rathe<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
