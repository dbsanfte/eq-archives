Simply because it s not our place to start bitching at those who have gone and made this problem.  Doing so would not solve any problems, it would","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1823034000\">Bann,<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Its funny to see this on a CLERICAL  HELP list first off....secondly....why<br/>\n&gt;cant you go and BUY the item from the lower levels then?  Granted, you cant<br/>\n&gt;do this with all of the lower levels....but do you know how often I&#39;ve had<br/>\n&gt;higher levels come in without as many principles as most of you?  Why dont<br/>\n&gt;you start bitching at those who HAVE gone and made this a problem?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Simply because it&#39;s not our place to start bitching at those who have gone<br/>\nand made this problem.  Doing so would not solve any problems, it would just<br/>\naggravate us.  Sure, some higher levels are jerks, but should everyone be<br/>\npenalized for it?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Example:  I&#39;m in Blackburrow one day.  The onyx earrings have to be one of<br/>\n&gt;the SIMPLEST things to get ahold of.  A Magician, lvl 27 walks in, says he&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;here to get the earring, and he&#39;ll take everything until he does....if we<br/>\n&gt;dont like it....LEAVE.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well then, I would simply take this persons name down, see if he is in a<br/>\nguild, and then post a message on the proper message boards to warn people<br/>\noff about him.  Granted, there&#39;s not a whole lot you can do about it, but at<br/>\nleast you can try to warn other peeps about this moron&#39;s practices.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Yeah, this is a great attitude people. We had 2 of the damn things to sell,<br/>\n&gt;and offered them and his answer:  &quot;WHy should I buy from a lower level when<br/>\n&gt;I can get them myself.&quot;  Or then we have the fact that I can pick these<br/>\n&gt;suckers up at HOW MANY merchants?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So you assume that all high level players have this attitude?  If not, what<br/>\nbearing does this have on the original question, is it fair to displace<br/>\nplayers who don&#39;t get xp for a mob, in deference to those players that do?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;For the paw of opalla quest you could EASILY purchase the damn rings from<br/>\n&gt;lower levels who got them....not only does it get rid of some of that cash<br/>\n&gt;you had sitting around doing NOTHING, but it keeps everyone happy.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Easily?  Do you know how long I&#39;ve been waiting to purchase just the<br/>\nplatinum ring for this quest?  About a good 3 weeks now, if not longer.  Not<br/>\na single one have I seen for sale at a bazaar or otherwise.  Sure, the<br/>\nsilver and copper are easy to come by, I&#39;ll give you that much, but the gold<br/>\nand platinum rings are all but impossible to buy.  I&#39;ve also spent a<br/>\nludicrous amount of time waiting for Gynok Moltor, just like everyone else has.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n                               |&#92;      _,,,---,,_      <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:darshan@...\">darshan@...</a>   ZZZzz /,`.-&#39;`&#39;    -.  ;-;;,_   <br/>\n                              |,4-  ) )-,_. ,&#92; (  `&#39;-&#39;  <br/>\n                             &#39;---&#39;&#39;(_/--&#39;  `-&#39;&#92;_)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
