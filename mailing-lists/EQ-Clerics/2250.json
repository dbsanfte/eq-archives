There are also many times when you know that going to save others is<br/>\nvery dangerous but you think you might be able to squeak by.   A couple of<br/>\nsituations....<br/>\n<br/>\nin your example of throwing yourself in front of a hill giant.. well I<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t do that either.  I might throw the guy a heal, then run if the SG<br/>\ncame after me.. but taht is as close as I&#39;d come to that.   I have many<br/>\ntimes though died to save my party or a tank...<br/>\n<br/>\nJust the other night, the tank of my group was pulling from the maze in<br/>\nCazic and suddenly i saw his hit points drop FAST... i ran into the maze to<br/>\nfind him and heal him.   In this case,   I knew it was dangerous but hoped i<br/>\ncould save his life and escape.  Unfortunately I got lost and was unable to<br/>\ngate as the train that had him stunned and hurting poured over me.  In this<br/>\ncase, I made a judgement that I could save a life.  I didn&#39;t plan on dying,<br/>\nbut I knew the risk.. and the rest of the group escaped... I died.   These<br/>\nthings happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nthere have been many other times when my group has faced a train or some<br/>\nother mini disaster.. and I have died as a result of trying to heal people<br/>\nenough to get them out of the zone... often i end up the last one out and<br/>\noften I die for it.. again it&#39;s a judgement... you don&#39;t plan on dying, but<br/>\nit&#39;s a calculated risk you take to try to help everybody survive.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, sometimes you party is in a bad fight and MOBS are on you<br/>\nand everybody is tied up and having a hard time getting them off of you... I<br/>\ncast a holy might and step away from my MOB.. i have time to heal myself<br/>\n(down below 2 bubbles) or my tank (also nearing death)... usually in this<br/>\nsituation I heal myself, even though i know I don&#39;t have time to heal us<br/>\nboth before the MOB is on me again.  My reasoning here is that I&#39;m hoping<br/>\nI&#39;ll get another chance to cast heal before the tank dies and I can get him<br/>\nthen... even if I don&#39;t get to heal him I am still alive and I can heal the<br/>\nrest of the party wheras if I let myself die not only do I die, but that<br/>\ntank dies and possibly the rest of the party as well...<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically I try very hard to put the best intrest of the group as a whole<br/>\nfirst when I face those situations.    Yes, my play time is as valuable as<br/>\nanybodies and I don&#39;t want to die and lose my xp, but remember... it&#39;s only<br/>\na game and it&#39;s only xp.  You will get your xp back =)   And people who you<br/>\ndie to save will remember that and what comes around goes around... that<br/>\nfavor will be returned some day.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Eachann Bronzeleaf<br/>\n-Cleric of Tunare, Tarew Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Woland Grauensturm &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:woland@...\">woland@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Wednesday, November 17, 1999 2:23 PM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [EQ-Clerics] Why do so many clerics think they&#39;re wizards?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Woland Grauensturm &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:woland@...\">woland@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;always the last one to zone and usually do the most<br/>\n&gt;&gt;dying.  But, that&#39;s my job.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I must disagree here. Even though we are healers our play time is as much<br/>\n&gt;worth as any other player&#39;s playtime. Personally I won&#39;t throw myself in<br/>\n&gt;front of a running giant to save someone else (literally). If I were a<br/>\n&gt;paladin or good cleric maybe I could do that but only from a roleplaying<br/>\n&gt;point of view. A cleric of Innoruuk should probably conclude that whoever<br/>\n&gt;dies was not fit to serve Innoruuk anyway. And it can be tactically<br/>\n&gt;motivated to stay alive so that you can ressurrect the others.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Unfortunetaly there are instances when we have to choose between saving the<br/>\n&gt;tank and ourselves. One example is when the tank is being beaten down by a<br/>\n&gt;train. As you all know healing that tank will result in an instant<br/>\n&gt;train-takeover that results in our death. On one single occation this has<br/>\n&gt;happened to me, and I chose not to heal the tank since I knew I would die.<br/>\n&gt;We evaced instead and everyone made it out. I&#39;m interested in other views<br/>\n&gt;on this matter.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;// JS<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
