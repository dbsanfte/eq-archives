I got a teleport over to Greater Faydark to get<br/>\nthere..  I&#39;m not well liked at either dock so ship travel really isn&#39;t<br/>\nfor me..<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve not had that much trouble there so far.. yes every good NPC there<br/>\nwill attack you but if you stick to the zone edges and get a good map<br/>\nyou can normally get around okay.  I have Jboots which have saved my<br/>\nlife a number of times over the last week though.  One hint I would<br/>\nsay.. is if it&#39;s raining and you need to cross a zone on Faydwer.. just<br/>\nclimb a mountain and sit and med for a bit.. wait for the rain to go..<br/>\nsince the clipping plane patch rain has become deadly when travelling<br/>\nhostile regions..  Yesterday I tried to cross Butchersblock and I<br/>\nmanaged to pick up a female dwarf from somewhere.. I didn&#39;t see any<br/>\nbuildings that I went too close to.. I didn&#39;t see her at all until she<br/>\nhit me..  Jboots saved me again.. but in the rush to zone I picked up<br/>\nanother 2 dwarves as I passed too close to their buildi ng..  (I reckon<br/>\nthe aggro zones on them are wider than the visible distance you can see<br/>\n(when raining) which if true is very nasty)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo apart from slightly difficult travel what else.. hmm.. trading.. Now<br/>\nI can sell to a druid at the druid circle in Butchersblock which is<br/>\nideal for dumping off your FS weapons from unrest..  however I haven&#39;t<br/>\nfound anyone to buy food from.. but we&#39;re clerics so we can summon that<br/>\nif necessary..<br/>\n<br/>\nBanking.. can&#39;t do this anywhere that I&#39;ve found..  Very annoying..<br/>\n<br/>\nTrading.. Trading is slightly harder in that you have to convince the<br/>\nperson you are buying from/selling to to come to you always.. since they<br/>\nnormally want to meet in the city of the zone your in.. or somewhere<br/>\nequally as dangerous for you to get to..<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway that&#39;s about all I have to sayabout Faydwer..  It&#39;s okay.. it has<br/>\nsome nice zones.. Unrest, Mistmoore, Kedge Keep.. but it&#39;s just not<br/>\nhome.. and the lack of banking is very annoying.. so unless you like to<br/>\ntravel a lot or have a Wiz/Druid on call to TP you back expect it to<br/>\nfeel like a camping trip.. and my will you really appreciate home much<br/>\nmore when you get back..  <br/>\n<br/>\nOh well.. nearly high enough to hit Sol B.. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nVinamin L&#39;Crit<br/>\nLvl 35 DE Cleric<br/>\nErollisi Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n(for those that wanted to know level/server)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
