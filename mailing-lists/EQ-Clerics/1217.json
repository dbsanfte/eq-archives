Once had a guy that<br/>\nwas using auction to give his group battle commands- that pissed me off.  That&#39;s<br/>\nwhat the /ignore is good for.<br/>\n<br/>\nABSOLUTE worst thing is people begging for money or items.  I give away free<br/>\nheals and buffs, but for a level 8 to ask if they can have my BE Mace, that cool<br/>\ncloak, or that thing on my head really pisses me off.  Now I&#39;m really getting<br/>\ngoing so &lt;RANT ON&gt;  The res requests are starting to really piss me off.  I do a<br/>\nfew for some lower level characters in Mistmoore, next thing I know there are 17<br/>\npeople asking me to res their body 2 and 3 times.   I don&#39;t mind sitting and<br/>\nmedding for an hour or two to clean up Guk or Sol B, but mid level peeps asking<br/>\nme repeatedly (every 2 to 3 minutes) while I&#39;m deep in the castle sucks.<br/>\nSometimes I miss messages from my party because the text screams by.  All these<br/>\npeeps are like level 20 to 27.  Next time my response is going to be &quot;You take<br/>\nthe risks being here, so either get used to dying or get outta this zone&quot;<br/>\n/ignore xxx.<br/>\n&lt;RANT OFF&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nPC begging really sucks, just like it sucks in RL.  A couple years ago an<br/>\narticle was written in the LA area about the street beggars who make $80K to<br/>\n$120K a year.  This just pissed me off.  Here I go to college, get good grades,<br/>\nwork my tail off and make less than someone who doesn&#39;t take a shower, doesn&#39;t<br/>\nbrush their teeth and doesn&#39;t wash their clothes for weeks at a time?  Made me<br/>\nsick.  If I played on a PvP server (especially one without the +/- 6 level rule<br/>\nlike Rallos) begging would be an instant death penalty for anyone that did it to<br/>\nme.  I would actually hope that their bind point was right in front of me so I<br/>\ncould keep killing them for awhile.  I like making statements.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes!  I have very strong opinions!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
