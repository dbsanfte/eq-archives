Not knowing the area<br/>\nvery well I managed to go to the Paladin&#39;s guild instead of the cleric&#39;s<br/>\nguild without realizing it (yes, I know, not very clever but it was very<br/>\nlate). I located a trainer there and the system allowed her to train me.<br/>\nJust curious if any one else has done this and if this might allow a player<br/>\nto literally use any guild to train in. This has ,embarrassingly enough,<br/>\nworked twice for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeisler<br/>\n18th Lvl Dwarven Cleric of Brell<br/>\nArmigers of Mirth, E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
