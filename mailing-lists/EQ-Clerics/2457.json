I find it much<br/>\nmore important to find a char that I would like to<br/>\nplay than worry about starting area!<br/>\n<br/>\nIts actually not too bad to make the &quot;Naked run&quot; when<br/>\nyou&#39;re low level.  No exp loss if you die, you just<br/>\nhave to start over again.  My friend&#39;s done it<br/>\nnumerous times at level 3 (as he *tried* to figure out<br/>\nwhat he wanted to be...sigh) and as far as I know,<br/>\nhe&#39;s never even died.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust put all stuff in the bank and stick to zone edges<br/>\nand watch where you run.  If you can get SoW or invis,<br/>\nthat&#39;s great, but you don&#39;t want to become too<br/>\ndependant on it.  Some of the casters get Invis at<br/>\nshockingly low levels, so that might be a &quot;travel<br/>\npoint,&quot; too.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only super tough parts from Qeynos/Erudin/Halas<br/>\nare either RunnyEye or Highpass (and BB if you chose a<br/>\nBarbarian).  I would go RunnyEye over Highpass unless<br/>\nyou know that the Gnolls and Orcs are camped (which<br/>\nthey probably arent&#39; on test).  For Feydarkians, its<br/>\nreally no problem at all to get to Freeport.<br/>\n<br/>\nIts not easy, but its doable and personally, it would<br/>\nbe more important to me to play what I want then start<br/>\nwith everyone...<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my 2 cents...<br/>\n<br/>\nHaith,<br/>\nDE Cleric of Erollisi Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Mikaela Valorblade &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mikaela@...\">mikaela@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Mikaela Valorblade&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mikaela@...\">mikaela@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Bree, I would LOVE to join you guys on test.  What<br/>\n&gt; are your names? I need to<br/>\n&gt; decide what kind of character to make.  That is a<br/>\n&gt; good combo, BTW...a bard,<br/>\n&gt; cleric and monk.  Gotta figure out what class/race<br/>\n&gt; combo that is good can<br/>\n&gt; start in Freeport, since I know I&#39;d never get a<br/>\n&gt; teleport or bind if I was<br/>\n&gt; born in like Erudin or Kelethin.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Mik<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>=====<br/>\nThorgerd Duskwind, Barbarian Shaman of Erollisi Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Barbarism is the natural state of mankind.
