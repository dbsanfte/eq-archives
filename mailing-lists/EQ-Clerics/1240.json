I have played Gemstone III online<br/>\nsince October of &#39;92 and still love the game but find EQ mostly boring after<br/>\nonly a couple of months.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy background is table top RPGs so I guess I really miss the roleplaying in<br/>\nEQ.  It seems to be a fine game for the Doom/Heretic type of person who<br/>\nloves to just go kill things and gain material wealth.  To me a longterm<br/>\ngame is much more than that.   It is the relationships you build up among<br/>\nyour friends and the other things that make a game more like a real world<br/>\nthan an arcade.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am really waiting for Hero&#39;s Journey myself to see what Simu can do with a<br/>\ngraphical game rather than just a text-based one like GSIII.  They are<br/>\nalready addressing the problems that EQ has an seem to have them solved.  I<br/>\ndo know that twinking will not be allowed to the degree that EQ has it.<br/>\nNothing really erks me more than seeing someone in full bronze or better in<br/>\na newbie area running around killing everything in sight and leaving it lay.<br/>\nI have had kills stolen from young ones and when I say something to them it<br/>\nis always so-and-so challenges you to a duel.  Some fair fight that would be<br/>\nfor sure.   My character in no armor with a rusty weapon against someone in<br/>\nbronze armor with a combine or better weapon.  Yeah right!!<br/>\n<br/>\nOh well, just my view point on EQ and why I do not spend much time there at<br/>\nall.<br/>\n<br/>\nYilari, 9th circle cleric of Tunare, Erollisi Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;John Erik Maynus&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jmaynus@...\">jmaynus@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve been reading on the EQ newsgroup that a good bit of ppl think EQ is<br/>\n&gt; already starting to die.
