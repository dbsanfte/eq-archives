I play on <br/>\nFennin Ro and it will become bogged down and very lagged if there are that <br/>\nmany people and it WILL cause deaths.  I for one was going to hate this <br/>\nfriday evening, however we are all reconsidering our fun adventure due to <br/>\nthis sit-in.<br/>\nIts bad enough already that Fennin is the most heavily populated servers as <br/>\nit is. I was in West Freeport as I previously stated when the Monk protest <br/>\ntook place and Yes I almost died, I was soloing Guard Jendl, when I realized <br/>\nI could not longer click icons or use hotkeys to cast any spells at all, I <br/>\ncould not even sit down for pete&#39;s sake, thank god I could walk and <br/>\nturn...So I was able to zone out.<br/>\nI have already stated to you all how I feel about the sit-in so I won&#39;t go <br/>\nthere again, but please think of all the other innocent people who just want <br/>\nto have fun and play, who you have a potential to adversely effect with this <br/>\naction.<br/>\n<br/>\nBree Wyndsdale<br/>\n50th Cleric of Fennin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
