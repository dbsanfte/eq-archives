It&#39;s a boring process but you seem to get a pretty decent faction boost for doing the blessed oil quest...  And I found out the hard way you have to get a little bit better than &quot;amiable&quot;  *grins*.   The way you can tell your faction is good enough is if you can actually get him to give you the quest by talking to him.   When you hail him, there are two possible ways you can go in your conversation with him and each way provides you with a different quest.  The one not related to the SSoL requires lower faction than the SSoL quest does... so make sure he will give you the SSoL quest.  Once he does that your faction is high enough and you can give him the honey jum.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Eachann Bronzeleaf<br/>\n-Cleric of Tunare, Tarew Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: Curtis Bennett &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:die_kluge@...\">die_kluge@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, December 03, 1999 5:10 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] Shining Star of Light<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Curtis Bennett&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:die_kluge@...\">die_kluge@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I would add that you will need just above &#39;amiable&#39; to get the quest.<br/>\n&gt; *Just* getting to amiable won&#39;t do it.  You have to hit amiable, and<br/>\n&gt; then do a few more quests to raise it further into amiable.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I would also suggest, if you do the blessed oil quest, you bind<br/>\n&gt; yourself in one of the places.  That way, you can just gate back and<br/>\n&gt; save yourself at least half the walk. For instance, bind yourself<br/>\n&gt; right in front of the priest that gives the quest.  Get the quest, and<br/>\n&gt; then walk to WK, deliver the flask, and gate back; wash, rinse,<br/>\n&gt; repeat.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: Judy Talbot &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jtalbot@...\">jtalbot@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;Subject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] Shining Star of Light<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Date: Fri, 03 Dec 1999 16:31:41 -0500<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Chris, you can raise your fraction by doing the prayer bead quest and also <br/>\n&gt; &gt;by<br/>\n&gt; &gt;killing the rabid wolves and bear in Qeynos hills. You turn the rabid pelts<br/>\n&gt; &gt;into the Temple of  Life for fraction and experience. I always tried for <br/>\n&gt; &gt;the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;bears as you get good experience and a spell that if you can not use you <br/>\n&gt; &gt;can<br/>\n&gt; &gt;sell it. Just be careful you do not run into Holly or the Ranger who will <br/>\n&gt; &gt;kill<br/>\n&gt; &gt;you, even though  you are getting rid of the diseased population.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;My fraction problem was the opposite in Rivervale and I had to spend a lot <br/>\n&gt; &gt;of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;time building up my fraction there by doing quests.

I am a 16th level Hafling cleric of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bristlebane.  The problem, I think lies with my faction in the Temple of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Life. Aeston Wemur cons apprehensive, and when I ask him for the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; instructions, he gives them to me, until I ask him about travelling <br/>\n&gt; &gt;afar,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; after which he says that the word is out not to trust me.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; THis particualarily sucks because I gave him the honeyjum, and instead <br/>\n&gt; &gt;of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; giving me the potion, he said my name was bad, not to trust me, etc. And <br/>\n&gt; &gt;he<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; took my honeyjum!!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; So, my question is, how do I raise my faction with the Temple of Life?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&lt;&lt; text3.html &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
