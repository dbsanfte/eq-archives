I can understand how it could be difficult for a tank, seeing how<br/>\nthey have ALL the weapon choices to train in. But we have only 2 melee<br/>\nskills to work on. Here&#39;s how I did it:<br/>\nAt 1st/2nd level the first thing I bought was a Worn Great Staff for around<br/>\n2.5g for my 2HB skill. At this time I was primarily hunting skeletons in<br/>\nNektulos, and I don&#39;t know if I got lucky or not, but one of them spawned<br/>\nwith a Cracked Staff. Voila! My melee skill problems were then answered. By<br/>\n4th level I had both skills maxed and have kept them maxed to this day. Now<br/>\nI am 22nd level (115 skill) using a Staff of the Observers. Everytime I<br/>\nlevel, I cast Hammer of Wrath and get 1HB maxed. Then I destroy it and go<br/>\nback to my Staff, and of course by the time I level again 2HB will be maxed.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, as to never meleeing, I don&#39;t see how you don&#39;t. My group never minds<br/>\nthe extra 100-125 points of damage I can dish out per battle. I usually<br/>\nblast once to pull, jump into melee, then back out and heal as needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust some info and possible strategies to any newbies out there.<br/>\n<br/>\nDrizben D&#39;Vorn<br/>\nDefiled High Priest of Innoruuk<br/>\nLoyal Knight of Oblivion<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; \tFrom: Sirensa Qi&#39;Seraph [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sirensa@...\">Sirensa@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; \t<br/>\n&gt; \tI would agree it is a personal choice :)  At level 40 I have both<br/>\n&gt; 1HB and 2HB skills at about 100 which is about half of max for my level -<br/>\n&gt; and honestly this is because for the past 15-20 levels I don&#39;t melee -<br/>\n&gt; hardly ever.  Weapon/Shield slots for me are used to gain as much +wis as<br/>\n&gt; possible ;)  I can whack a MOB if necessary - but I usually cast.<br/>\n&gt; \t <br/>\n&gt; \t~Siren<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
