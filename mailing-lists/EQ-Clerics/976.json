It&#39;s<br/>\nfairly difficult to get (mine was given to me), but you could probably<br/>\nbuy one.  It does weigh a fair bit, but gives +10 vs. magic.  Other<br/>\nthan a shield, I&#39;m not sure what you can hold in an off-hand.  Besides<br/>\na light source such as a lantern.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Trizzen Do&#39;Trevan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:trizzen@...\">trizzen@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Quick question...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I am going away from the Bloodforge to the SSOL, so what is a good item<br/>\n&gt;to hold along with the one handed weapon? I play a casting cleric so I<br/>\n&gt;am almost maxed out on weight and thus I don&#39;t want a shield. I do not<br/>\n&gt;want to hold the skull, or any other such evil item, since I am of<br/>\n&gt;purely good alignment. I can&#39;t really think of anything else that a<br/>\n&gt;level 16 can have. I have about a 100pp to buy the item if i can&#39;t go<br/>\n&gt;get it myself, or with one of my groups. Any suggestions would be most<br/>\n&gt;appreciated.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thank you!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Eylena 16th circle Rodcet Nife<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--- Curtis Bennett &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:die_kluge@...\">die_kluge@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Curtis Bennett&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:die_kluge@...\">die_kluge@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Giving bone chips to Lushun Novashine works, but the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; faction gained<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is very slight.  The blessed oil quest, while slow<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and tedious, is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; free and does seem to raise it much more.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   There is also another quest, where you can kill<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the monk standing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; by the tree.  Occasionally, you&#39;ll see Estle<br/>\n&gt; &gt; attacking him.  Forget<br/>\n&gt; &gt; his name.  I never did kill him, but he is a traitor<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to Rodcet and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; converted to Bertoxxulous.  I suspect killing him<br/>\n&gt; &gt; will raise faction<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with priestoflife, too.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Say to the priest (Aeston Wemore) &quot;I will be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; traveling afar&quot; if he<br/>\n&gt; &gt; says he can not trust you, or whatever, you can&#39;t do<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it.  And you&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; &gt; right, amiable is not good enough.  After I made<br/>\n&gt; &gt; amiable I had to do<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the blessed oil quest about 3 more times.  So,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; somewhere between<br/>\n&gt; &gt; amiable and warmly (or is it kindly?)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   The halflings name in Rivervale is Kizzie Montopp<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and she is just<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to the left, coming out of Fool&#39;s guild in an herb<br/>\n&gt; &gt; shop.  I was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; actually &#39;dubious&#39; to her, and despite her threats<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of calling the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; guards on me, she still gave me the honeyjum.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Also, a quick note on the bloodforge hammer, you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; do not have to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have done ANY quests for Byzar (is that his name?)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Bloodforge in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; warrior&#39;s guild in Kaladim.  I had never met the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; guy, was amiable<br/>\n&gt; &gt; anyway (because of killing so many Crushbone orcs)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and gave him<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Trumpy&#39;s head, and he gave me the hammer.  It&#39;s a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; dirt simple quest,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; just kill one guy, give him the head.  It&#39;s just<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that it&#39;s on the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; other side of the world.  And the head is nodrop, I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; believe, so you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have to do it yourself.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;__________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt;Bid and sell for free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://auctions.yahoo.com\">http://auctions.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;GET WHAT YOU DESERVE!
