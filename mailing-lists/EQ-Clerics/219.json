I am<br/>\n&gt;happy being a cleric, but I cannot resist jumping into the heat of a<br/>\n&gt;battle and kicking some back.  I also like to occassionally tank.  I try<br/>\n&gt;to save all my mana for healing, but sometimes I just love to blast<br/>\n&gt;away.  This is probably because I feel useless when grouped as my<br/>\n&gt;regular attack doesn&#39;t compare to others in the group.  Anyone else feel<br/>\n&gt;this way?  Any experiences to share?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well i VERY rarely use Smite against any critters but i find Holy Might<br/>\nquite a good offensive spell since it prevents the mob from hitting the<br/>\ntanks and thus saving HP. It&#39;s only the undead that i really use my <br/>\noffensive spells against, especially if there are more than one cleric<br/>\nin group. If i find that there is no real danger of anyone getting killed<br/>\nand that i will not need to med to heal them i go in and melee. Doesn&#39;t<br/>\nit really make you feel good when you finally see the horrible werebat<br/>\nin front of your group slayed down and that you had some real good blows<br/>\nat it? At least i do : )<br/>\n<br/>\nIyenya Goldenheart<br/>\nLvl 23 dwarf cleric<br/>\nInnoruuk server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
