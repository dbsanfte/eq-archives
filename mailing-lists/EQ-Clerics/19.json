(besides undead) IMHO I am<br/>\na level 13 High Elf cleric. Our offensive spells dont do that much damage at<br/>\nall.  I have read about the higher level offensive spells, and they dont<br/>\nreally impress me.  I love being a cleric saving lives and getting the<br/>\nthanks from everyone.  Pretty much we cant solo.  (which I dont mind at all)<br/>\nI want to be in a group.  When I play I must get a couple /tells an hour<br/>\nasking me if I am in a group.  Or some high level asking me to heal 500+<br/>\nHP&#39;s.  All I really want is appreciation.  Depending on their level I do<br/>\ncharge a small fee for a cure or a heal.  Usually what I do if they do give<br/>\nme something depending how much, I will cure/heal the rest of the period I<br/>\nam playing.  I think everyone will agree with me that being a cleric you are<br/>\ngoing to be poor! Like I said,  I am level 13 and have about 2/5 of banded<br/>\narmor.  When I see other classes have full banded and a fine steel weapon.<br/>\nI was forced to move locations from Oasis which doesn&#39;t give much loot at my<br/>\nlevel to Black Burrow.  I didn&#39;t mind the move at all.  I plan to stay in BB<br/>\nuntil I get full banded armor all of my level 14 spells and maybe a fine<br/>\nsteel hammer.  I have to look up the stats for that.  Then I will probably<br/>\nmove back to the Oasis.  Well I am rambling right now plus there is work to<br/>\ndo.

Let&#39;s start with why<br/>\nyou want to be a cleric.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith me it was a simple choice.  I like to be able to help people.  There is<br/>\nnothing like coming upon someone locked in a life or death battle and<br/>\nswaying the tide to their side.  I don&#39;t do it for any reward other than the<br/>\nthank you I receive.  It is good to know that you helped.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also like the fighting abilities of the Cleric.  Although not as good as<br/>\nthe Warrior or the Paladin, Clerics can definitely hold their own.<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid<br/>\n<br/>\na.k.a.
