I&#39;ve not noticed any<br/>\nKS&#39;ing.  It is one of the more crowded servers, but really, what is the<br/>\ndifference between 1500 and 1700 players?  Not much.  I also find, in terms<br/>\nof start towns, that Rivervale is probably the best one.  Lots of helpful<br/>\npeople, and because it is a crossroads town, you get many players coming<br/>\nthru there.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Thormael LGT [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:thormael@...\">thormael@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: 1999/11/09 1:50 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] An odd Cleric Question<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Thormael LGT&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:thormael@...\">thormael@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI left Fennin Ro for Tunare some months ago now and I like it TREMENDOUSLY <br/>\nbetter. :)<br/>\nLess crowded, less kill stealing, nicer people, IMHO, of course.<br/>\n<br/>\nThormael<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: EvertorN &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:evertorn@...\">evertorn@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: [EQ-Clerics] An odd Cleric Question<br/>\n&gt;Date: Tue, 09 Nov 1999 06:15:29 -0700<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hi all.  I decided this would be a good place to put this, since everyone <br/>\n&gt;has<br/>\n&gt;good input on our class, while others refuse to help one another, I dunno.<br/>\n&gt;Basically I currently play on veeshan server, and for months have been fed <br/>\n&gt;up<br/>\n&gt;with it.  Now I&#39;ve heard other ppl say (and could be rumors) that there is <br/>\n&gt;less<br/>\n&gt;ks&#39;ing on other servers, as well as not a dominate god guild like foh on <br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;server.  (to Those of you possibly in FOH on this list, no offense, the <br/>\n&gt;group of<br/>\n&gt;friends I play with (UWS) as well as I have had bad run ins with your <br/>\n&gt;guild.<br/>\n&gt;Basically FoH and UWS has gone there...let&#39;s not do it again in here)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So basically my question to you is the server you play on how do you like <br/>\n&gt;it?<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m seriously considereing abandoning all my characters on Veeshan to play <br/>\n&gt;on a<br/>\n&gt;better server.  This game is all about the playability in the environment, <br/>\n&gt;which<br/>\n&gt;veeshan seriously limits those not powerhungry play the game.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Evertorn Soul<br/>\n&gt;Level 20 Erudite Cleric on Veeshan </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
