Best way to show you where he is is have someone lead<br/>\nyou<br/>\n&gt; there or look at a map of UG.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Dunno how exciting it would be for your guild to hunt there though.  Maybe<br/>\n&gt; if they kill all the frogs while getting there.  His placeholder and his<br/>\n&gt; spawn time is 15 min.  I truely believe he only spawns twice in 24 hours<br/>\n&gt; though...if even that...sometimes I think he only spawns once in 24 hrs.<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; camped that spot for 48 hrs straight practically and finally just traded<br/>\n&gt; some stuff for the leggings.  I heard some people who were after the<br/>\nleggins<br/>\n&gt; have to camp over a week to get em.  BTW the legs are the rare drops.  I<br/>\n&gt; collected up to 3 arms while camping him in 48 hours.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The reason why I say that this spot might be boring for a guild raid is<br/>\ndue<br/>\n&gt; to the fact that it is usually camped...by ppl who usually can camp<br/>\n&gt; solo...(i.e. druids, wizzie, necro, shamans, etc) The arms are sought<br/>\nafter<br/>\n&gt; by the int casters and the leggins are sought after by all the wis<br/>\ncasters.<br/>\n&gt; On top of that...it&#39;s a pretty boring camp.<br/>\n&gt; To camp it solo...you must be at least 36.  A small group (let say less<br/>\nthen<br/>\n&gt; 5 ppl) of 25+ can handle that spot easily.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Might be best to have your guild do the entire UG to liven things a bit.<br/>\n&gt; Making a round of all the name spawn area might be fun.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; FREE ADVICE FROM REAL PEOPLE!
