If you actually know of a better way to get<br/>\nVerant&#39;s attention, then do share...  if not, well maybe the complaints of<br/>\npeople who are lagging out will help us all in getting Verant&#39;s attention...<br/>\nmaybe they will realize that if they actually listen to the players it can<br/>\nsave a lot of headaches for everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t get me wrong, i don&#39;t want to cause problems for other players... but<br/>\nI don&#39;t know a better way than the sit-in.  When the rangers did it to try<br/>\nto convince Verant to give them critical hits with bows, it worked.  Verant<br/>\nis supposed to be fixing the problems with feign death, I believe in this<br/>\npatch.   So things like this can work... and I am sorry if it adversely<br/>\naffects other players for a few hours, but if that&#39;s what it takes to be<br/>\nheard then so be it.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Eachann Bronzeleaf,<br/>\n-Cleric of Tunare who WILL be sitting in<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Heather Daley &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:blushn@...\">blushn@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Wednesday, December 01, 1999 10:57 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] Cleric Sit-in- reconsidering<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Heather Daley&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:blushn@...\">blushn@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I have heard this very same thing about Fear, as well as, Hate.  I play on<br/>\n&gt;Fennin Ro and it will become bogged down and very lagged if there are that<br/>\n&gt;many people and it WILL cause deaths.  I for one was going to hate this<br/>\n&gt;friday evening, however we are all reconsidering our fun adventure due to<br/>\n&gt;this sit-in.<br/>\n&gt;Its bad enough already that Fennin is the most heavily populated servers as<br/>\n&gt;it is. I was in West Freeport as I previously stated when the Monk protest<br/>\n&gt;took place and Yes I almost died, I was soloing Guard Jendl, when I<br/>\n </span></blockquote>realized<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I could not longer click icons or use hotkeys to cast any spells at all, I<br/>\n&gt;could not even sit down for pete&#39;s sake, thank god I could walk and<br/>\n&gt;turn...So I was able to zone out.<br/>\n&gt;I have already stated to you all how I feel about the sit-in so I won&#39;t go<br/>\n&gt;there again, but please think of all the other innocent people who just<br/>\n </span></blockquote>want<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;to have fun and play, who you have a potential to adversely effect with<br/>\n </span></blockquote>this<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;action.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Bree Wyndsdale<br/>\n&gt;50th Cleric of Fennin Ro<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
