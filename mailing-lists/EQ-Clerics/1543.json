And my<br/>\n&gt; meter is not showing any lag at all. I find it disconcerting, to say the<br/>\n&gt; least. Rest assured, I have a very fast computer/graphics setup, and a<br/>\n&gt; fast modem. I recently downloaded a big 28 meg SBLive! upgrade...I<br/>\n&gt; wonder if that crap has affected my gameplay somehow...I hate some of<br/>\n&gt; those SBLive! components.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Saidinn<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I used to zone fast -- very fast, and then over time it dropped down to where<br/>\nI seem to zone slowly...<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout 2 weeks ago, I started getting disconnected when I zone.  Not just once,<br/>\nbut nearly everytime.  I wrote EQ tech support, but solved the problem on my<br/>\nown without them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith all of the screenshots I had taken and never cleaned up, as well as the<br/>\nemail that had been piling up and never read (all those distribution lists I<br/>\nused to pay attention to before I became an EQ Addict), my harddrive partition<br/>\nwas getting full, and was extremely fragmented.<br/>\n<br/>\nI cleaned up the email, removed 90% of the screenshots, defraged, and my<br/>\nproblems went away.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, I still get disconnected sometimes due to network problems (lag, etc.)<br/>\nbut tracert will tell me if it&#39;s local, in-route, or on the EQ end, so I know<br/>\nwhen to panic or not.  And the client problems are gone after a small amount<br/>\nof sys maintenance.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Shanna on Rallos<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>____________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your own FREE, personal Netscape WebMail account today at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://webmail.netscape.com\">http://webmail.netscape.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
