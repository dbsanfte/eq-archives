First<br/>\nof all, 2h blunt will cause your stamina to drain<br/>\nFAST!  Also, there are many cleric only one hand blunt<br/>\nweapons floating around.  Althout the damage is not<br/>\ngreat, it all adds up.  It also gives you the<br/>\nopportunity to hold some great wisdom item in your<br/>\nother hand.  SOme prefer the testament or paw, but I<br/>\nprefer a charred guardian shield.  +9 wisdom plus AC,<br/>\nit&#39;s perfect ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe symbol line is awesome but does get really<br/>\nexpensive to cast.  It will be a favorite among your<br/>\nparty. Currently, I am at level 36 so I have symbol of<br/>\npinzarn.  It costs nearly a plat per cast.  I go<br/>\nthrough approximately 250 of these per week.  But then<br/>\nagain, I make decent money so it does not bother me<br/>\nall that much.  Symbol, guard(holy armor line) and<br/>\nvalor(courage line) all stack nicely together.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this helped a little bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdira SoulSaver<br/>\nBandaid of Tunare<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\nGet paid for reading E-Mail!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sendmoreinfo.com/id/63758\">http://www.sendmoreinfo.com/id/63758</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
