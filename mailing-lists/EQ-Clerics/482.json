The<br/>\nquestion is that does dexterity effect in spellcasting any way? Does it make us<br/>\nto recover from mobs interrupting our spellcasting better? I have heard some<br/>\nclerics claim this. I have a dex of 98 and i do find it quite often that even if critters<br/>\nhit me HARD i am able to cast a healing spell. I have even gated several times<br/>\nout from a heated battle while being hit for a total of 70 dmg.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust thinking if buying those jewellery craft items that raise dex are worth it :)<br/>\n<br/>\nIyenya Goldenheart<br/>\nLvl 27 dwarf cleric<br/>\nInnoruuk server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
