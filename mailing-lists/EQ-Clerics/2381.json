As you all are aware money is a definite problem at<br/>\nthis level.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had a wonderful week as far as donations to my equipment goes.  I was<br/>\ngiven a banded tunic and a blackened neck guard plus getting rawhide gloves<br/>\nfrom a zombie really helped.  A few lootings of ghouls has also helped my<br/>\nbank account a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am still having trouble finding groups at times but so far with only one<br/>\nexception I have not lost a party member yet.  The only exception was an<br/>\nill-fated venture into Oasis when I was still 11th.  I really think that<br/>\nupon making 14 I will head back to GFay.  I have nothing against Freeport<br/>\nand EC but I think the humans are all jealous of us elves. (grins)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again all,<br/>\nYilari, High Elven Cleric of Tunare<br/>\nErollisi Marr<br/>\nBlades of Honor Guild</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
