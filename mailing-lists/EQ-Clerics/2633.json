I ve learned that it makes no difference if I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-778645351\">Rose, the dragons&#39; spells are all AoE and will get you even when you stand<br/>\nout of healing range of your party.   I&#39;ve learned that it makes no<br/>\ndifference if I stand on the steps (at Nag) or right behind my tanks in<br/>\nfront of the dragon as to damage I take.  And you MUST be in healing range<br/>\nof your party, otherwise why be there?  One VERY interesting thing I have<br/>\ndiscovered tho......on the last two dragon raids I positioned myself BEHIND<br/>\nthe dragon, almost under his/her butt.  Guess what....I did not suffer<br/>\nnearly the dmg from their spells I did when I was in front of them yet was<br/>\nstill in healing range of my party.  And I never got physically hit,<br/>\nalthough I rarely do unless I get summoned, then I get clawed big time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI assume all you dragon hunters out there are aware that in order for your<br/>\nnukers&#39; spells to not be resisted and do max dmg you must have them<br/>\npositioned and casting directly UNDER the dragons&#39; bellies? That is the<br/>\nvulnerable spot, where they are the least resistant and more susceptible to<br/>\ndamage.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, Rose..make dang sure you keep BOTH of your Invulnerable spells up when<br/>\ndoing these high level hunts.  Divine Aura and Divine Barrier.  I have<br/>\nsurvived many a dragon raid or a bad FG pull  to be able to keep my party<br/>\nalive by casting one of these on me early enough before I was almost dead.<br/>\nBe sure to tell your party members when you cast it tho, so another healer<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t waste mana trying to heal you.<br/>\n<br/>\nMik<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Rose&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rliu@...\">rliu@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, January 13, 2000 3:59 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] Seeking advice...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Rose&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rliu@...\">rliu@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I want to thank everyone for taking the time to reply to my post.  Our<br/>\nguild<br/>\n&gt; is doing another dragon run again tonight or planes =( (at least that&#39;s<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; rumor) I am more nervous then I can say.  Thanks for all the advise...I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; printed out all of y&#39;all&#39;s replies so I can read it while I play...EGAD<br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s a confidence builder there isn&#39;t it?!  Good thing the tanks in my<br/>\n&gt; group won&#39;t know ;P<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ll try not to die as much tonight...dont want my friend to come back to<br/>\n&gt; find she now has a lvl 48 character or something =P<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Last night, after dying so much, I started to make sure I kept a really<br/>\n&gt; really really good distance from the battle.  Hope that&#39;s the way to do<br/>\n&gt; it...I was so good at keeping the distance that I couldn&#39;t cast at the<br/>\ntanks<br/>\n&gt; cause they were &quot;out of range&quot; =/ So I wasted a few precious second trying<br/>\n&gt; to get closer to the battle to heal while the health bar was going down<br/>\n&gt; steadily...was too stressful.  Then I got close enough, maybe too close,<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; heal and die...again...*sigh*  On the bright side...I was the only one in<br/>\nmy<br/>\n&gt; group that die majority of the time...all the tanks were kept alive pretty<br/>\n&gt; well most of the time...can&#39;t say the same for the enchanter and the<br/>\nshammie<br/>\n&gt; in my group though =/  They went down too fast for me to heal.  I&#39;m pretty<br/>\n&gt; sure I&#39;ll get the exact science of this sooner or later =/<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have no idea being a cleric can be this stressful.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Get great offers on top-notch products that match your interests!<br/>\n&gt; Sign up for eLerts at:<br/>\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/elerts1\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/elerts1</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
