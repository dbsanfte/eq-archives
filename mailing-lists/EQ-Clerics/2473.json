Unrest<br/>\nis the lowest level of these zones.  As a result, you get a lot of people<br/>\nthere who haven&#39;t really &quot;grown up&quot; yet, as it is the first high pressure<br/>\nzone they&#39;ve been in.   You also have a lot of people who have matured in EQ<br/>\nand know how to group... but when you do a pick-up group you never know what<br/>\nyou are gonna get...<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand when I am in a group like Cazic where most people are<br/>\nlevel 30&#39;ish.. almost all of them have this experience and know their roles<br/>\nin the group and how to handle different situations.  That&#39;s not to say you<br/>\nwon&#39;t get bad groups in Cazic (or Guk, Sol, etc) but I think your chances of<br/>\ngetting a GOOD group are significantly better... that has been my experience<br/>\nanyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is just my theory =)  Who knows, maybe i&#39;m way off base &lt;grins&gt; but<br/>\nbased on my own experience it seems to be the truth...<br/>\n<br/>\nEachann Bronzeleaf<br/>\nCleric of Tunare, Tarew Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Chris Wheeler &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wheelech@...\">wheelech@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&#39; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Wednesday, December 08, 1999 10:54 AM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [EQ-Clerics] Just a rant, nothing important<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Chris Wheeler &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wheelech@...\">wheelech@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ya, you&#39;re right.
