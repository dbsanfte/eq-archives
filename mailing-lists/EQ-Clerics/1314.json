But, I did want to add my opinion/comments on <br/>\nthis issue.<br/>\nFrom the volumes I have read so far I think there is a bit of confusion. <br/>\nCamping for items that you don&#39;t have and Kill stealing are 2 completely <br/>\ndifferen things.  I do not think this rule should have been put into effect, <br/>\nIn my groups personal experience, there are items that we need that we did <br/>\nnot get at lower levels.<br/>\n<br/>\n1)I do not agree with item hording, once you get the item you need leave and <br/>\nlet the next group take over.<br/>\n<br/>\n2)I do not feel if a higher level group is camping an item and a lower lvl <br/>\ngroup walks in that they should have to leave, what does it matter the level <br/>\nof the people if they are in need of the item to be attained.(i.e. my group <br/>\nconsists of people all 44+ and 2 of the 6 of us still do not have Jboots, so <br/>\nwhy should they not be able to get them?)<br/>\n3) I believe that everyone has the right to attain these items and now that <br/>\nus&quot; higher levels&quot; have little to no place to hunt, it is a good time for us <br/>\nto get those things we can use to our benefit, that we never got a chance to <br/>\nget in the beginning for whatever reason(i.e paw, Jboots, whatever, etc...)<br/>\n4) i play on Fennin Ro and the reason I believe they changed PoF is directly <br/>\nrelated to a few things I have seen happen on our server.<br/>\n   a) Guilds(who will remain Nameless)were taking their lowbies and camping <br/>\nthem in fear. when the High lvl group slayed a beast, they would bring the <br/>\nlowbie in to loot the item from the corpse, sad in my opinion.<br/>\n   b) Also many people made lowbie characters to just go and explore there <br/>\nwithout fear of losing their regular character stuff and experience.<br/>\nSo, i agree with the level cap for those reasons, I have seen PoF myself, <br/>\nbut I have never hunted there in a group, I am lvl 46 and still will not be <br/>\ngoing there anytime soon(until they tone it down) Because of the Nameless <br/>\nGuilds on Fennin Ro, that ruined it for everyone else. Its A lot of fun <br/>\nseeing a lvl 6 paladin walking around in full fear armor.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my thoughts,<br/>\nBree Wyndsdale<br/>\n46th cleric of Fennin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
