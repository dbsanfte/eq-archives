It was established in<br/>\n&gt;the beginning that you had problems with teamwork (the loot thing). If I <br/>\n&gt;see<br/>\n&gt;that the group is not cooperating from the very start, I leave as quickly <br/>\n&gt;as<br/>\n&gt;I can. It&#39;s not worth dying over when a better group is probably 10 ft.<br/>\n&gt;away. Granted, it&#39;s not always easy to find another group, I will take<br/>\n&gt;soloing over dying because of somebody else&#39;s stupidity. At least if I die<br/>\n&gt;solo, I know it was MY fault.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Drizben D&#39;Vorn<br/>\n&gt;Propagator of Hate<br/>\n&gt;Defiled High Priest of Innoruuk<br/>\n&gt;Oblivion Knight of the 30th Circle<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Chris Wheeler &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wheelech@...\">wheelech@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hi all,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The following is just a rant.
