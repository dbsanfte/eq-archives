Trolls, Ogres and Barbarians get maybe brewing (possibly Tailoring for Barbs, all those pelts), Wood elves get fletching, High elves get, er... Tailoring or Baking? Really they should all get a level 1 bard song, or a general new one &#39;elf song&#39;. And humans get fishing, as they come from an oceanside town.

Dwarves should be<br/>\nnaturally be better<br/>\nat this skill than say a Troll or Ogre.  But if each of these characters start<br/>\noff with equal INT then<br/>\nthey will go up along the same learning curve.  What should happen is that<br/>\nseverial factors should<br/>\nbe taken in consideration:<br/>\n<br/>\nRace: the natural affinity of a race to pick up or have inherent knowledge in a<br/>\nskill<br/>\nInt: the rate at which a skill has a chance of increases as the Int goes up.<br/>\nperhaps on a log scale from 0 to 200.<br/>\nWis: the modifer for failing all together or succeding after a blunder and<br/>\nrecovering from an oopsie.<br/>\nDex: the nimbleness of the crafter to increase his chances to create an item<br/>\ndue to it&#39;s complexity or an advanced design (perhaps it<br/>\nshould be given more weight in Jewlery crafting and other such like skills)<br/>\nStr: The stronger the character the easier it would be to fold or bend metal<br/>\nand thus the crafter would not be wore out<br/>\nafter attempting to create a heavy piece of armor.  If the crafter attempted to<br/>\nmany items in a row then his success rate would drop.<br/>\nSta: as in Str the more or faster you craft the more your Sta should drop thus<br/>\nmodifing the possibility of success or failure.<br/>\nLocation: If your race is warm or amiable then you&#39;d feal at home at that<br/>\nparticuar forge.  But if your less liked perhaps a modifer should<br/>\nbe place to make it seem as if your not quite comfortable working in a place<br/>\nthat the locals might take a dislike to you and attempt to linch<br/>\nyou.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know they will not go this far but I think that something like this would<br/>\nmake it easier for a Dwarf to gain Mastery in Blacksmithing, a<br/>\nGnome to gain Mastery in Jewlery craft and a host of other Race/Skill combo&#39;s<br/>\nthat would be more or less &#39;realistic&#39; to the &#39;game&#39; instead of<br/>\nsaying well your Int is 100 and your a Troll (if possible) you&#39;d be much better<br/>\nat crafting Jewlery than Gnomes with a lower Int rating.  Although<br/>\nGnomes should be born and bread to the Jewlery and Tinkering craft.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my 2 cents worth...<br/>\n<br/>\nPyrrhus Morningsun<br/>\nSun Clan of Warriors<br/>\nSol Ro<br/>\n<br/>\nPaul Heenan wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Paul Heenan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pheenan@...\">pheenan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Higher INT = Higher % chance to increase in skill while practicing a trade<br/>\n&gt; Higher WIS = Lower % chance of failure while practicing a trade<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In other words, higher INT will enable you to increase your skill faster<br/>\n&gt; than a lower INT would. While higher WIS will help you not fail as much<br/>\n&gt; while you are doing it. Being a Dark Elf and a Blacksmith I have proven<br/>\n&gt; this. With both INT and WIS being high I Mastered Blacksmithing (136 skill)<br/>\n&gt; with a mere 120pp. Whereas my Ranger (80 WIS, 75 INT) took well over 300pp<br/>\n&gt; to master it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Drizben D&#39;Vorn<br/>\n&gt; High Priest of Innoruuk<br/>\n&gt; Propagator of Hate<br/>\n&gt; Oblivion Knight of the 33rd Circle<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Jeff Portwine&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jdport@...\">jdport@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t think this is true...
