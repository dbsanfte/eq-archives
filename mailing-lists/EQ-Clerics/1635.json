The problem is in the way they handle their server side<br/>\npotentially visible set computations.  They can&#39;t store a conventional<br/>\nserver side PVS like normal 16 or 32 player network games, because it would<br/>\nbe far to computationally intensive (and requrie some pretty insane server<br/>\nside hardware) to compute for 1500-2000people constantly.  Because of this,<br/>\ntheir PVS is handled using a very simple spherical relevancy system - if<br/>\nsomeone is in your relevant sphere, then the server considers them to be<br/>\nrelevant to your client and sends it over - not really a network problem,<br/>\njust tons and tons of extra particles/etc for the physics and interpolation<br/>\nsubsystems on the client to think about.  This compounds in small or densely<br/>\npacked zones like unrest and cazic because almost everything in the zone<br/>\nbecomes relevant to you, so your machine is having to think about almost<br/>\neverything.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Ryan Robinson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bigsexxyryan@...\">bigsexxyryan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Tuesday, September 28, 1999 4:43 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] lag (was: rez changed)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Ryan Robinson&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bigsexxyryan@...\">bigsexxyryan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;well are there any ways to increase are framerate or get patches which will<br/>\n&gt;emhance are cards to keep up and handle the frame rates. I have a voodoo<br/>\n&gt;banshee which i hate and was wondering if a voodoo 3 3000 is alot better. I<br/>\n&gt;do not know much about graphic cards but if i can get some review saying<br/>\n&gt;that voodoo 3 is way way better then my banshee on handleing stuff i might<br/>\n&gt;just buy it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;thx for the info on lag so far<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Enursin High Battle cleric<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
