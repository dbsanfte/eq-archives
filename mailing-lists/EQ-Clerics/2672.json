Best way to show you where he is is have someone lead you<br/>\nthere or look at a map of UG.<br/>\n<br/>\nDunno how exciting it would be for your guild to hunt there though.  Maybe<br/>\nif they kill all the frogs while getting there.  His placeholder and his<br/>\nspawn time is 15 min.  I truely believe he only spawns twice in 24 hours<br/>\nthough...if even that...sometimes I think he only spawns once in 24 hrs.  I<br/>\ncamped that spot for 48 hrs straight practically and finally just traded<br/>\nsome stuff for the leggings.  I heard some people who were after the leggins<br/>\nhave to camp over a week to get em.  BTW the legs are the rare drops.  I<br/>\ncollected up to 3 arms while camping him in 48 hours.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason why I say that this spot might be boring for a guild raid is due<br/>\nto the fact that it is usually camped...by ppl who usually can camp<br/>\nsolo...(i.e. druids, wizzie, necro, shamans, etc) The arms are sought after<br/>\nby the int casters and the leggins are sought after by all the wis casters.<br/>\nOn top of that...it&#39;s a pretty boring camp.<br/>\nTo camp it solo...you must be at least 36.  A small group (let say less then<br/>\n5 ppl) of 25+ can handle that spot easily.<br/>\n<br/>\nMight be best to have your guild do the entire UG to liven things a bit.<br/>\nMaking a round of all the name spawn area might be fun.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
