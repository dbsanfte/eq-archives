I do have to say that a lot <br/>\nof folks (me included) as for info and such on this board.  AND I will also <br/>\nadmite to the fact that I do not stay IC all the time either.  I do want to <br/>\ngo up in lvls.  I do want to get the better items.  BUT the reason I do is <br/>\nso I can better play my character.  The way I view my character is diffenet <br/>\nthan the way I saw him when I frist created him (I didnt add anything in his <br/>\nwis, I thought I was going to be able to do some damn good 1hb damage.... I <br/>\nwas wrong, so now I am a total healer... sit and med type).s  I think while <br/>\nI am with my group I do stay IC most of the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I have become laxted in what to expect in games (both computer and <br/>\nnon).  I have had TOP NOTCHED GMs and ok GMs.  I have played great RGP games <br/>\nand ok ones... I know what the tech. can do, I also know what the low end of <br/>\nthe human element will do... so ya put them together and ya get a world <br/>\nwhere some will RP a lot, some will do it some times, and other will laugh <br/>\nat you for doing it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am very sorry to see ya go but I totally understand. I personally hope you <br/>\nfind what you are looking for...<br/>\n<br/>\nSafe journey to where you are going.<br/>\n<br/>\nJaxim&#39;s control....

I have played this RPG since it first hit the<br/>\n&gt;shelves of my local game store- and I must say; I am quite disappointed to<br/>\n&gt;where it has ended up as.<br/>\n&gt;  It had great promise, but frankly-  it&#39;s the worse fantasy game i have <br/>\n&gt;ever<br/>\n&gt;played. As a matter of fact;  THERE IS NO &#39;FANTASY&#39; about it!!!! I had a<br/>\n&gt;number of fantastic dreams when I first heard of Everquest- a land where <br/>\n&gt;one<br/>\n&gt;can travel across lands and dimensions, a true world where you can follow a<br/>\n&gt;trail through a path of forest for hours to reach the fabled land of elves-<br/>\n&gt;or journey through a dark dungeon where rumors of a powerful sorceror made<br/>\n&gt;his home there-, creating monstrosities and twisting creatures and beings <br/>\n&gt;to<br/>\n&gt;its desire, with people cowering in fear to its name- or journey to an inn<br/>\n&gt;within a city, where you meat cut-throats, warriors, magicians of promised<br/>\n&gt;power to journey with you to a quest assigned to you- but these dreams have<br/>\n&gt;been shattered! Never has any of this happened in the world of Norrath to <br/>\n&gt;me.<br/>\n&gt;  Playing as a priestess of Tunare, I had great ambitions of journeying and<br/>\n&gt;making a mark upon my name as an adventurerer and holy advisor. But I am <br/>\n&gt;lost<br/>\n&gt;in a world of technicality- noone cares about adventuring or imagination in<br/>\n&gt;the world of Norrath. I am lost in a world of levels, fancy weapons, and<br/>\n&gt;items. Noone in the world of EQ cares about being in a diffrent world- its<br/>\n&gt;only a contest on who can reach the highest level, get the most fanciful<br/>\n&gt;weapon, or the the most striking robe.<br/>\n&gt;  Try to prove me wrong- I doubt it! Through my months of journeying in the<br/>\n&gt;world of Norrath, I HAVE ONLY MET ONE PERSON  that truly tried to roleplay<br/>\n&gt;(and i have met many people through different servers) - and even he turned<br/>\n&gt;into the &#39;world of mundane unimagination&#39; after a month. Am I wrong? Read<br/>\n&gt;this mailing list- what do people talk about on this list? This is what <br/>\n&gt;they<br/>\n&gt;talk about-<br/>\n&gt;    &quot; How can I find the (some generic magic item that everyone else talks<br/>\n&gt;about) &quot;<br/>\n&gt;    What level is --- (some monster that someone wants to kill to get an <br/>\n&gt;item,<br/>\n&gt;and camp out til he/she gets it)<br/>\n&gt;     Where can I hunt to get to level (a number) -<br/>\n&gt;      Etc.... etc....&quot;<br/>\n&gt;  Not that any of this is wrong, people are asking for help- but this is <br/>\n&gt;all<br/>\n&gt;anyone talks about in EQ! ! ! I once belonged to an RPG community and game<br/>\n&gt;where mailing lists were designed to be &#39;in character&#39; , where Mordok the<br/>\n&gt;warrior may  share his thoughts about the Golden Dragons Inn, or the Dark<br/>\n&gt;Elves gathering a war party to rid the land of people who oppose them, or<br/>\n&gt;magicians giving hints to the knowledge of their power through a quest for<br/>\n&gt;them (And i thought this was one of the most exciting RPGs until they <br/>\n&gt;started<br/>\n&gt;charging money per hour to play) - does any of this happen EQ, wheteher<br/>\n&gt;through mailing lists or in the game itself?  To believe that EQ made a<br/>\n&gt;measly attempt to have people roleplay by coloring their names a different<br/>\n&gt;color!? All i get from those people  are male characters asking for my <br/>\n&gt;phone<br/>\n&gt;number or address (considering I play a female character), or  ---<br/>\n&gt;   &quot;How much damage does that spell do?<br/>\n&gt;    When will  (the monster) spawn again?<br/>\n&gt;     WHat number is your (skill) at?<br/>\n&gt;    Whats the stats of your (item) ?<br/>\n&gt;   I can&#39;t wait til reach level (#) etc...etc...&quot;<br/>\n&gt;     I am not making bones about it- yes, it is great to reach the next <br/>\n&gt;level<br/>\n&gt;so you can cast a different spell, etc.. to enliven your adventure-  but <br/>\n&gt;what<br/>\n&gt;does everyone else look for after that? THIS is what -<br/>\n&gt;     &quot; I can&#39;t wait to reach the next level!!! &quot;<br/>\n&gt;   So what happens when you reach level 100? What are you going to do then,<br/>\n&gt;keep fighting monsters til you reach level 101?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   There is no fiction about EQ. Its not a RPG, its a video game with no<br/>\n&gt;imagination. Its a game with promised excitement, yet it will rot (and it <br/>\n&gt;is<br/>\n&gt;already starting to) from the inside, and will not last long at all. I am<br/>\n&gt;quitting my characters, and looking forward to this other game that i saw <br/>\n&gt;on<br/>\n&gt;the web ( a complicated multi-player text RPG, but not a traditional MUD). <br/>\n&gt;I<br/>\n&gt;am sure mostl of the people reading this doesn&#39;t give a damn about anything<br/>\n&gt;of what I said -  trash me all you want- I dont care.<br/>\n&gt;   Tenzin Alexander<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Books, music, auctions, and more.
