This new rule irritates me, to say the least. I am deleting my<br/>\naccount and trying to give the boots to a friend whom I do not want to see<br/>\nwasting away while camping for his own pair. Isn&#39;t there some way to trade<br/>\nthe darned things? If not, this only heightens the camping problem. Call me<br/>\na twink if you will. I prefer to call myself practical&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI went on to post....<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;From what I&#39;ve heard you can not trade, sell or drop the jboots.  I agree<br/>\ntho if you have to get them yourself and from what I&#39;ve heard about getting<br/>\nthem takes forever it just makes camping worse then before.  Cause now<br/>\nyou&#39;ll have tons of Lvl 35-40s sitting around waiting for the NPC to spawn<br/>\nin hopes that it&#39;ll have the jboots&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr at least I think it&#39;s around Lvl 35-40 for the JBoots.<br/>\n<br/>\n**************************<br/>\nAzor<br/>\nLvl 16 Human Cleric of the Rathe<br/>\n**************************</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
