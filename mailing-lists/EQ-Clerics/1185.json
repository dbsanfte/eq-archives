I agree on the patchwork, but smithing isn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;cheap. On established servers it&#39;s usually cheaper to buy banded or skip<br/>\n&gt;straight to bronze, given that the smithing market is becoming so depressed,<br/>\n&gt;and places like Unrest get more low-level players in them by the day...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Actually I&#39;m quite serious.  If ye need to armor 3 or 4 players, and they<br/>\nare willing to pay for the base costs of the materials, you could easily<br/>\ngain enough skill to make banded reliably.  I estimate it would take<br/>\nroughly 250 to 300 platinum pieces to bring smithing up to the level<br/>\nnecessary to create Banded.  With 3 or 4 people, that comes out to 75 to<br/>\n100pp each for banded.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n                               |&#92;      _,,,---,,_      <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:darshan@...\">darshan@...</a>   ZZZzz /,`.-&#39;`&#39;    -.  ;-;;,_   <br/>\n                              |,4-  ) )-,_. ,&#92; (  `&#39;-&#39;  <br/>\n                             &#39;---&#39;&#39;(_/--&#39;  `-&#39;&#92;_)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
