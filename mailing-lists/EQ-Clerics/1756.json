However, there are still a couple things<br/>\n&gt; that puzzle me. I was really hoping someone could<br/>\n&gt; enlighten me. :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1) Charm, does cancel magic work on it or not? I have<br/>\n&gt; tried casting several times with mixed results.<br/>\n&gt; Sometimes it seems to cancel it sometimes it does not.<br/>\n&gt; All of my party members had only endure magic on, so<br/>\n&gt; the second dispel should have theoretically worked,<br/>\n&gt; but sometimes it did not. What gives?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hmm, I always thought that Cancel Magic removed charm, but have not had to<br/>\nuse it in quite some time so I cannot verify this.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 2) When charmed, I thought you could not use your<br/>\n&gt; skills/spells. This seemed to be the case until late<br/>\n&gt; last night when a 28th cater was charmed and then<br/>\n&gt; proceeded to kill me in three casts. I also lost about<br/>\n&gt; a half a bubble of exp from this PC death. I later<br/>\n&gt; asked the caster and she said that she was killed me<br/>\n&gt; by a spell that was memorized in the 6th slot, not the<br/>\n&gt; 8th slot like some people think. Her 8th slot was a<br/>\n&gt; gate.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*YOU* cannot cast while charmed, but the NPC that charmed you can use your<br/>\ncomplete arsenal against whatever you are fighting, this includes any of the<br/>\n8 spells you have memorized.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So, what gives??
