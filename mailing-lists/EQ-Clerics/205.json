Unless your a Level 50th cleric youll never see the really <br/>\n&gt; good cleric weapons(scepter of rahotep, jewel encrusted sceptre) dont even <br/>\n&gt; know the stats on these, just seen the level 50&#39;s on my server with em. We <br/>\n&gt; need a mid range weapon, screaming mace just dont cut it,. If you are willing <br/>\n&gt; to branch out into 2hb however there are some awesome weapons such as the <br/>\n&gt; ogre war maul (but i dont have the patience) So lets all email verant about <br/>\n&gt; this! and ill post to eqvault message boards!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Dungin Krawler<br/>\n&gt; Level 24th cleric - Rathe<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Looking to expand your world?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; ONElist has 175,000 e-mail communities from which to choose!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
