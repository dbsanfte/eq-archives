Less than 30<br/>\nthere and you are looking at trains.  The best place to be in your mid-20s<br/>\nis in a room in the house *IF* the other rooms are also camped. If you are<br/>\nthe only one in the house, you WILL be fighting the entire house because<br/>\neverything can see through the walls and floors (except the basement).  You<br/>\ncan get insane exp and loot in the hand room, the bar room, the tower, or<br/>\nthe reclusive ghoul magi room, but you have to others in the house.<br/>\n<br/>\nAstur il&#39;Ayan, Cleric of Brell<br/>\nSolusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Sianne .&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:maggee1@...\">maggee1@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I was at Unrest at lvl 23 with a full group including a 2nd cleric.  The<br/>\n&gt; place was horrible.  Death after death after death.  Between deaths and<br/>\n&gt; running to the zone there were no points made.  The only time we<br/>\n&gt; were there<br/>\n&gt; successfully was in a room (hand room) i think.  Then shortly a high lvl<br/>\n&gt; cleric came in and ran us out....i am now almost lvl 27 and haven&#39;t been<br/>\n&gt; back yet.  I may try to go back soon though...<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
