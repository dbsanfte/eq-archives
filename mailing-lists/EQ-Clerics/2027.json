This is ALL I did:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 1. Go to Highpass and find the Smuggler&#39;s camp. If you go to the Inn and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; jump in the water, you will see a hole in the side of the wall, swim<br/>\n&gt;through<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and you will be there.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 2. Find Dynil (forgot his last name) who spawns under a little tent. He<br/>\n&gt; &gt; looks just like a Qeynos guard with a helm on so you can&#39;t miss him. He is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; around 13-15 level. When you kill him he drops &quot;Page 30 of a book&quot; (no<br/>\n&gt; &gt; drop). (NOTE: His spawn time is right at 7 hours)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 3. Go to Qeynos and find Moordoro (this is where i went invis). He is in a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; building to the right as soon as you enter the North gate. Just walk up to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; him and give him 2gp. He will hand you the Testament of Vanear Container<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (2-slot container). Then you give him 4gp and he will deal you a card from<br/>\n&gt; &gt; his deck. (NOTE: You MUST give him GOLD pieces) When he deals you a<br/>\n&gt;Jester,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; give it back to him and he will give you &quot;Page 34 of a book&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 4. Place both pages into the container and, Voila!, you have a Testament<br/>\n&gt;of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Vanear. Easy!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Anymore questions, let me know.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ok,  how does one do the quest then? :)  that would be my best question<br/>\n&gt;to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ask...I&#39;ve heard it touched on and not seen any answers as to how to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; complete it!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bann<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
