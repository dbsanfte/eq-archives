I&#39;d be<br/>\n&gt; surprised if not. It&#39;s just damn hard to come by. But even if there isn&#39;t that<br/>\n&gt; kind of weapons i&#39;m still happy playing my cleric. At level 25 i am doing less<br/>\n&gt; melee than never before because the mobs hit my party members so hard<br/>\n&gt; that i need to be very careful in watching their health. Especially if there<br/>\n&gt; are pure casters in group.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The first time we had a tough situation in Mistmoore and i had to do greater<br/>\n&gt; heal twice on a party member all the critters suddenly attacked me and i was<br/>\n&gt; slayed in a matter of seconds. I was the only one to die on that assault.<br/>\n&gt; Sometimes clerics life is hard :(. That has not happened again though. We<br/>\n&gt; killed plenty of inkies there that day *grin*. And i did get enough melee that<br/>\n&gt; day that i was able to max out my 2HB skill for the level that i just had<br/>\n&gt; gained. Now i need to max my 1HB skill... there is a bit more work to do.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Iyenya Goldenheart<br/>\n&gt; Lvl 25 dwarf cleric<br/>\n&gt; Innoruuk server<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Having difficulty getting &quot;in synch&quot; with list members?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Try ONElist&#39;s Shared Calendar to organize events, meetings and more!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>After comparing my class to others, I must say I am happy being a<br/>\nCleric.  The best weapon we could get (in my opinion) would have to be<br/>\nthe observer&#39;s staff.  It&#39;s 12 DMG, 35 Dly, 5+ Wis and 5+ Int.  That&#39;s<br/>\npretty close to what some of you have been looking for.  I am quite<br/>\nhappy with this weapon, but I must say I really don&#39;t need a better one.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason for this is that as I gain more levels, and venture into the<br/>\nharder dungeons (Cazic Thule etc.) I realise that my duty as a healer is<br/>\nabove all else.  I find myself healing our tanks and casters more often<br/>\nthan anything else.  However in Cazic, since the lizzies are smart,<br/>\nthey&#39;ll tend to attack the healer on the first or second heal you make<br/>\n(if there is more than one), so my advise to you, would be to<br/>\nconcentrate on buffing yourself with armour, wisdom, and invulerablity<br/>\nspells.  ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nI personnaly would love to see Cleric only weapons.  Even if it isn&#39;t<br/>\nthe greatest, we all, as healers would have something to show that would<br/>\nbe unique to us.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<br/>\n       Deidden of SCARAB<br/>\nSolusek Ro Server, Lvl 30 Halfling Cleric</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
