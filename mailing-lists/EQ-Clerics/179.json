Now<br/>\nthat&#39;s amazing! =)  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, you had it right.  On the mem&#39;d spells on the top left side<br/>\nof the screen, click and hold down the left mouse button until it<br/>\nbecomes a button itself.  Then drag it to a hotkey slot and place<br/>\nit just one pixel to the right and one pixel or so down, then lft click.<br/>\nFor some reason (at least on my screen) it never catches if i place<br/>\nthe icon right over the hotkey square.  I have to place it just to the<br/>\nright and down for it to latch on.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI never tried this, but if you have no spells memm&#39;d on those spell<br/>\nslots, you can also try lft clicking on the empty spell slot until<br/>\nit becomes a button.  Then just mem the spells in the slots that have<br/>\nassociated hotkeys.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNote: on my slower computer (amd 200), when i try to mem spells,<br/>\nthe response is so slow it sometimes clicks on the spell instead<br/>\nof creating a button.  Just do the trial and error trick.  Also,<br/>\nbe sure you&#39;re in windowed mode (not full screen or transparent<br/>\nscreen).  <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this helps,<br/>\n //Aldaren  of Tunare  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Tue, Jun 22, 1999 at 09:54:13AM +0000, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:voodoo@...\">voodoo@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:voodoo@...\">voodoo@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have a silly question.

I&#39;ve tried doing it the way you put other things <br/>\n&gt; there, i.e. left click and holding, but that just casts the <br/>\n&gt; spell.
