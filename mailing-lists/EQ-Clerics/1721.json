The rings are NOT no trade - so it IS possible to purchase<br/>\nthem - though they are excessively costly to get from another player.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd at your level, killing Mitty should give you good experience, so get a<br/>\ngroup and hunt her, you don&#39;t have to rely on smite alone if you have a<br/>\ngroup - everyone in the group could get experience, thus no one would mind<br/>\noverly helping you to camp.  (Druids seems to like the paw also - you can<br/>\nget a druid to help you camp and help you to kill Mitty - and get both of<br/>\nyou the rings)<br/>\n<br/>\nI need to camp that Mitty also ;) so if you need help on Solusek Ro server,<br/>\nwould be glad to help.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust some thoughts =)<br/>\n<br/>\n~Siren</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
