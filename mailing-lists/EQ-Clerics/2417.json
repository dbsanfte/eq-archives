What bothers me is to see someone playing a game we choose to play, <br/>\ndevote immense amounts of time to, pay for, then not have any incentives to <br/>\ncontinue.  No sense of accomplishment or satisfaction for their efforts, <br/>\ninstead Verant continues to take away and/or neglect the classes that need <br/>\nthe most help.<br/>\n<br/>\nBree Wyndsdale</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
