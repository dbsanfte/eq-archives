Someone asks a<br/>\n&gt;question in a polite way and gets this kind of answer?   This is why there<br/>\n&gt;are so many problems in EQ is because of immature people like this.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Yilari, Cleric of Tunare, Erollsi Marr<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Come on over to our server if you would please.  Start in Kelethin and I<br/>\n&gt;will aid you however I can with a few things to get you started.  I think I<br/>\n&gt;have a spare cracked staff and maybe some cloth armor stashed away.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Kent Anderson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wart1@...\">wart1@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Stay the hell off Karana, our server&#39;s ready to crap out all the time<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and needs to be replaced.  Goto one of the new servers if you are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; starting over.
