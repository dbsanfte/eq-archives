Normal  plate is too heavy, and has no<br/>\nwisdom enhancements, only AC.  You want items that give you wisdom.  And at<br/>\nhigh levels, you shouldh&#39;t be getting hit much, if at all, if your tanks are<br/>\ndoing their jobs.  I have sacrificed AC for wisdom, and have no regrets.<br/>\nAgility will keep you from getting hit as often, also.   Understand now,<br/>\nthis is at HIGH levels.  Which is what your goal should ultimately be.<br/>\n<br/>\nMik<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Patrick Trant &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:telikas@...\">telikas@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, October 19, 1999 11:12 AM<br/>\nSubject: [EQ-Clerics] RE: mana<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Patrick Trant &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:telikas@...\">telikas@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 170 wisdom?!?!  Ack...that has to be a joke for me.<br/>\n&gt; With my base wisdom of 103 and me being fairly new,<br/>\n&gt; the only way I will be able to get wisdom items is<br/>\n&gt; from killing the mobs myself (which means I will have<br/>\n&gt; to be fairly high to even get any good items)...Being<br/>\n&gt; new I can&#39;t afford them items as of now; plus I hear<br/>\n&gt; we clerics are very poor for a LONG while cause we<br/>\n&gt; have to buy armor and spells...which so far seems to<br/>\n&gt; be true.  In all honestly did I do the right thing by<br/>\n&gt; putting my strength up to 100 (I read a guide that<br/>\n&gt; said I should so I could wear full plate) or should I<br/>\n&gt; have just pilled all my points in wisdom?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Niomar, Dwarven Cleric of the 10th Training.

And the damage<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you will be able to do<br/>\n&gt; &gt; against high level mobs is very minimal.  You will<br/>\n&gt; &gt; be fighting mobs with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 1000s of hps at high levels, and a lot of them have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; very high magic<br/>\n&gt; &gt; resistance, so your spells are useless cause they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; are resisted most always.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; And these mobs hit HARD...some for over 100 hps<br/>\n&gt; &gt; damage a pop.  You can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; survive at melee with these mobs, only the big tanks<br/>\n&gt; &gt; can.  You serve one<br/>\n&gt; &gt; purpose mainly, and that is healing to keep everyone<br/>\n&gt; &gt; alive. Regarding<br/>\n&gt; &gt; undead,  clerics used to be able to solo specs quite<br/>\n&gt; &gt; easily with undead<br/>\n&gt; &gt; spells, but they changed the pathing of them at the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; spec cave in Feerott and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; now it&#39;s dangerous cause you can&#39;t really pull them<br/>\n&gt; &gt; solo anymore.  You pull<br/>\n&gt; &gt; one and two or three come, and that&#39;s BAD news.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Regarding the mana issue....you will need to get<br/>\n&gt; &gt; your hands on as many<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wisdom enhancing items as you can, because you will<br/>\n&gt; &gt; need all the mana you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; can get to increase the effectiveness and efficiency<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of your healing powers.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The more mana you have the longer you can keep your<br/>\n&gt; &gt; group alive and the less<br/>\n&gt; &gt; med time you have.  So start amassing those wisdom<br/>\n&gt; &gt; items and try to get your<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wisdom at least up into the 170s minimum.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sorry to disillusion you, but high levels clerics<br/>\n&gt; &gt; are relegated mostly to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; healing and buffing and medding.  That&#39;s what your<br/>\n&gt; &gt; specialty is and at those<br/>\n&gt; &gt; levels, the other healing classes can&#39;t come close<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to our healing powers<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with our superior and complete heal.  The good news<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is that no high level<br/>\n&gt; &gt; group ventures anywhere without at least one good<br/>\n&gt; &gt; cleric.  YOu are a MUST<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  Mike<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; =====<br/>\n&gt; If at first you don&#39;t suceed, destroy all evidence that you had tried.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
