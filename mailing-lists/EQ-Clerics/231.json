Ogre War Maul ! 17 dmg, 50 Delay for 145 pp ! I<br/>\nthought since I do minimal melee, and more healing might as well have a slower<br/>\nweapon but do a good amount of damage ( 35 a pop! ). I like it. Mike not be da best<br/>\n( the 2h sword that is base dmg 40 + level of character is better  ( no one can find<br/>\nit either, Except ME !!!!!)) Just saying other things are good like the Bloodforge<br/>\nand Midnight Maller.

I know this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;is ranting but hear me out. I know we aren&#39;t fighters but we are defensive<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;players in the game. Why not give us a few defensive weapons. Weapons with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;random charges of some type of defensive spell. I know ya&#39;ll will all say<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;well what about the screaming mace? Blah it does a whole lot of good for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;you when your not even supposed to be tanking right? Anyway, why not have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;that cast as an area affect yaulp? That would be much kewler and much more<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;beneficial to the group. What do all of ya&#39;ll think about something like<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;that? I&#39;m not saying that the clerics in general are unbalanced in the game<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;but what I&#39;m saying is there are weapons that are class specific to most<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;other classes but the clerics. Please give me your feedback. Please feel<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;free to rant right back at me to... just don&#39;t be too harsh! :)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;**********************<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Human Cleric<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Ramsess De&#39;Vizier<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Rallos Zek<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;**********************<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ONElist:  the best source for group communications.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Join a new list today!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Having difficulty getting &quot;in synch&quot; with list members?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Try ONElist&#39;s Shared Calendar to organize events, meetings and more!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
