Answer: because they can.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;In Unrest, and other undead dungeons, clerics can killsteal, and a couple,<br/>\n&gt;including the notorious Soulbasher (may Brell curse his name and fizzle his<br/>\n&gt;spells!) do so regularly. We curse wizards because they commit sins...that<br/>\n&gt;we are usually not capable of. But when we are capable, a few clerics will<br/>\n&gt;be succumb to temptation and be killstealers as well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;It&#39;s funny. I didn&#39;t killsteal as a wizard, but switched characters because<br/>\n&gt;of an impression that no one really wanted a wizard. As a cleric, I have a<br/>\n&gt;new appreciation of wizards. My thing is healing, and having a wizard in my<br/>\n&gt;party can vastly reduce the damage I have to heal, because the mobs get<br/>\n&gt;taken down more quickly. Less downtime, less mana expenditure, safer fights<br/>\n&gt;against tougher mobs -- a better time is had by all. I really appreciate<br/>\n&gt;having a wizard in the party.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The whole killstealing thing is due to a very, very bad design decision by<br/>\n&gt;Verant. I.e., that a group&#39;s total damage is ignored in assigning credit<br/>\n </span></blockquote>for<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;kills, and if an outside player has done more damage than any *single*<br/>\n </span></blockquote>group<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;member, then he gets credit for the kill. Brad posted a note about this<br/>\n&gt;design decision to the Vault message boards, that was reprinted widely on<br/>\n&gt;the news pages. Verant seemed to feel that if a group&#39;s total damage was<br/>\n&gt;counted, then groups would steal from individuals.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Duh! Now we have exactly the opposite problem. And why, in a group-oriented<br/>\n&gt;game, are we catering to the least ethical, most unsocial, nastiest solo<br/>\n&gt;players?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I ran into a guy -- yes, a wizard -- named Odisius, in Unrest on Fennin Ro<br/>\n&gt;the other night, who was soloing and killstealing from groups. He said he<br/>\n&gt;had no real interest in playing the game, but was only trying to level to<br/>\n </span></blockquote>20<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;so he could sell the character/account on eBay.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;This is the kind of person the current damage-assignment algorithm benfits.<br/>\n&gt;Aaaccckkk! This is dumb, and make the game frustrating for those who really<br/>\n&gt;want to play and enjoy it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I am going to send Verant some screenshots of Odisius sceaming obscenities,<br/>\n&gt;and describe his behavior, along with a plea to rethink the kill-assignment<br/>\n&gt;algorithm.
