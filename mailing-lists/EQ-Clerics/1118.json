It uses small<br/>\n </span></blockquote>amount<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; of manna and is relatively quick to cast. Generally I cast it and if not<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I sometimes use flash of light,  one problem I have found however, is that<br/>\nthey can still cast on you if they are blinded.  I did not think this was<br/>\nthe case, but the one duel I lost was because a shaman friend of mine<br/>\nnuked me hard while he was blind.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; rooted I ran round the back of them and start hitting them. From the back<br/>\n </span></blockquote>no<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; melee weapon effects you.  I always use a 1 handed weapon (fast=28) on the<br/>\n&gt; principal that I have more chance to interrupt other players casts.

One hope is that you can be aided by other players.<br/>\n&gt; Otherwise the general wiz technique is root and nuke. If they don&#39;t notice<br/>\n&gt; (or do not understand) they may waste a lot of manna.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree..<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; However I have in general lost to casters, mainly because the Pk&#39;s on<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Rallos<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; tend to wait till your health is at the last bubble while fighting a MOB<br/>\n&gt; then kill you with one/two unexpected blasts.
