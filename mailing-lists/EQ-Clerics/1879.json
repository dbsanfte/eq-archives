It does seem to me that most<br/>\nspells do not affect NPCs.<br/>\n<br/>\nI tried healing a guard that was fighting a dark elf<br/>\nin freeport, and the guards life did not move. I tried<br/>\nhealing him like four times without any sucess. This<br/>\nwould also go along with my experience killing dark<br/>\nelf guards. Seems for some reason, people take offense<br/>\nto me killing their guards. :) The solution is that I<br/>\noccasionally have a dragoon trained on me. Since I am<br/>\nonly level 20, it would be easier for a dark elf<br/>\ncleric to just heal the corporal until I died. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe other side is I have heard of people casting see<br/>\ninvisible on NPC guards and having them attack invis<br/>\nplayers. Also seems that other people have had success<br/>\nhealing NPCs as they are fighting kill stealers. <br/>\n<br/>\nso, the question I guess I have is what buff spells<br/>\nwork on NPCs and what spells do not? <br/>\n<br/>\nEylena 20th circle no last name priestess of Tunare. <br/>\n<br/>\n=====</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
