However, I have <br/>\nnever seen a Cleric duel nor have heard of one. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Since we are in charge of Saving lives, how do we tune<br/>\nourselves to Take a life? Clerics are far from being cowards,<br/>\nbut to decline a duel or be somewhat at a loss durring a<br/>\npotential guild war, can bring shame upon the class.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  So I ask, are there any dueling clerics out there that can<br/>\nlend their experiences to a beginning duelest?  I am a level<br/>\n19 cleric but I wish to open the discussion to all levels. <br/>\nTips for fighting hybrids, magic using classes, and especially<br/>\nadventureres that are of lvls higher than yourself.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n//Aldaren<br/>\n  &quot;There is no comfort between the Craddle and the Grave...&quot;-unknown</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
