One the mummies and skeletons (lvl 9-13)have a lot more booty. I<br/>\nmade several plat in an hour. HOWEVER there was a spawn variation last<br/>\nnight. Normally I just take them in rotation and they spawn about every 5<br/>\nmins. Once last night a 2nd mummy spawned about 10 seconds after I pulled<br/>\nthe first. Has anyone noticed this. Personally I really like the idea as it<br/>\nchanged a &quot;cushy&quot; kill into a near death experience. I look forward to<br/>\nhearing your thoughts.<br/>\n<br/>\nNyne/Nynenom</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
