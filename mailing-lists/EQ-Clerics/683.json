And I for one will NEVER buy a game that he is involved in.<br/>\nBeen there, done that! lol<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople left Realm to come here for the most part, Sierra is in trouble -<br/>\nMiddle Earth is not being worked on at this time and it will be years before<br/>\nit comes out if ever. It would not surprise me to see somewhere down the<br/>\nroad that Sierra sells the rights to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIts the same with everything in life, things change and in the computer<br/>\nindustry they improve at an alarming rate. On a Monday you can buy a state<br/>\nof the art CD Rom and by Friday something better has come out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI mean 2-3 years for a game is a very long time. I love EQ just as much as<br/>\nthe next person (for now-hehe) but that won&#39;t stop me from looking around<br/>\nwhen something better comes out :)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
