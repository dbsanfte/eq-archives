So i started casting Wrath on it. I was in<br/>\nfull group that time. There were some of my group meleeing the critter. And<br/>\nsome other people too. Then after i had two wraths on it a wizzie came in and<br/>\nstarted blasting it. Needless to say who got the kill... eventhough i did 4<br/>\nwraths on it with a total of 800 damage... the wizzie took it. In that case<br/>\nthe group damage thing would have helped us to get the kill... but well it<br/>\nwas just one little ancille. These thing don&#39;t happen very often in Mistmoore.<br/>\nAt least not to me and my group. But i was really puzzled after the fight...<br/>\nwhat the heck... who took my groups kill... i did 800 damage to it... oh a<br/>\nwizzie was casting on it... how many hp&#39;s do these critters have?<br/>\n<br/>\nIyenya Goldenheart<br/>\nLvl 30 dwarf cleric<br/>\nInnoruuk server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
