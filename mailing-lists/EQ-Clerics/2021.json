So,<br/>\nit is possible for us evils to do this quest ;) The hardest part of the<br/>\nquest, of course, was waiting on Dynil (sp?) to spawn in Highpass. I was<br/>\nhunting in SKarana, so I made frequent trips to and from HKeep, and on one<br/>\nsuch trip lo and behold, he was standing there. After pimp-slapping him and<br/>\ntaking his page of the book, I met up with a friend in Qeynos who invised me<br/>\nand I went to Moordoro&#39;s place. Only took me 7 tries (28gp) to get the<br/>\njester. Needless to say, I was quite thrilled. If you are in your teens, I<br/>\nrecommend doing this quest because this is a great Cleric item (+10 WIS, +10<br/>\nMana) that is relatively easy to come by.<br/>\n<br/>\nDrizben D&#39;Vorn<br/>\nDefiled High Priest of Innoruuk<br/>\nOblivion Knight of the 24th Circle</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
