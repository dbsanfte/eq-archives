I work FT and by the time<br/>\nI get on at night, we have to try and get together and do something before<br/>\nsomeone has to go to bed, the weekends are a different story. I do spend<br/>\ntime helping others out and going into town and such.   I don&#39;t get much<br/>\ntime for &quot;travel&quot; and nice as it may seem to have a different outfit, My<br/>\ngroup does not get items we do not need. There is enough camping for items<br/>\nin the game now as it stands and for my group to camp a Mithril BP for me<br/>\n&quot;for looks&quot; is not what we practice. I had a pair of ruby pants in the bank<br/>\nbut honestly i can&#39;t be bothered with carrying all that stuff around all the<br/>\ntime, just to impress people.<br/>\nMy point being, that if they we going to make items for us to increase our<br/>\nwisdom stats I think the designers could have done a better job of trying to<br/>\nmake them match for our class specifically.<br/>\nAlso, just my opinion Human females look like ass in Steel plate and/or<br/>\nbronze armor. Full ruby and Mithril and the mist armor I like, but the<br/>\nothers don&#39;t appeal to me what so ever.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust My thoughts,<br/>\nBree<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: AoS/Aosinator &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:darshan@...\">darshan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Monday, September 20, 1999 3:23 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] Armor<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: AoS/Aosinator &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:darshan@...\">darshan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Bree,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Well, you are in the wrong class if you are big on looks my friend, until<br/>\n&gt;&gt;you can get to PoF and get the Mist Armor.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m not too sure I agree with this.  With the options of storebought Steel,<br/>\n&gt;Rubicite and Mithril, you can come up with a very nice looking outfit for<br/>\n&gt;travelling and social occasions.  Although I&#39;d like to obtain Mist Armor<br/>\n&gt;myself, it&#39;s just not feasible at this time.  However, you can be as vain<br/>\n&gt;(I&#39;m very aware of how my character appears), as any other class.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;You wanna be a good cleric? Mostly likely the answer is yes.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Then you will look like a newbie.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Absolutely, during times of battle you will look like a nightmarish<br/>\n&gt;hodgepodge.  However, outside of battle you can still wear your travelling<br/>\n&gt;clothes.  I normally carry my mithril breastplate, as well as the rest of<br/>\n&gt;my outfit with me, so that when I&#39;m not fighting, I don&#39;t look a mess.  =)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;                               |&#92;      _,,,---,,_<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:darshan@...\">darshan@...</a>   ZZZzz /,`.-&#39;`&#39;    -.  ;-;;,_<br/>\n&gt;                              |,4-  ) )-,_. ,&#92; (  `&#39;-&#39;<br/>\n&gt;                             &#39;---&#39;&#39;(_/--&#39;  `-&#39;&#92;_)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
