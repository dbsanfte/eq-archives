I am<br/>\n&gt; happy being a cleric, but I cannot resist jumping into the heat of a<br/>\n&gt; battle and kicking some back.  I also like to occassionally tank.  I try<br/>\n&gt; to save all my mana for healing, but sometimes I just love to blast<br/>\n&gt; away.  This is probably because I feel useless when grouped as my<br/>\n&gt; regular attack doesn&#39;t compare to others in the group.  Anyone else feel<br/>\n&gt; this way?
