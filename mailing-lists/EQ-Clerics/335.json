Like since I&#39;m still lvl 15 (should hit Lvl 16<br/>\n&gt; sometime today), if casted it on me I would not get much exp back but if you<br/>\n&gt; casted it on a played say that was Lvl 45 they&#39;d get a good bit back.<br/>\n&gt; So I take it you finally got you one of those Staff of the Observer you&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; been wanting forever.  Hope you like it and congrats on Lvl 40.  Why is Lvl<br/>\n&gt; 40 gonna suck by the way?  Is it like Lvl 20 when ya die you lose close to a<br/>\n&gt; bubble of exp?  If thats why then I guess on Lvl 40 you what lose close to<br/>\n&gt; two bubbles of exp?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; **************************<br/>\n&gt; Azor<br/>\n&gt; Lvl 15 Human Cleric of the Rathe<br/>\n&gt; **************************<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Mystik &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mystik@...\">mystik@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; actually, that does make a lot of sense.....it would seem that hte higher<br/>\n&gt; lv you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; are, the more exp you can give back.....i just know now that i have to go<br/>\n&gt; thru<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hell all over again....lv 40&#39;s gonna SUCK majorly......o btw, i have a<br/>\n&gt; question<br/>\n&gt; &gt; about the staff of the observer while i&#39;m thinking about it....it has one<br/>\n&gt; charge<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of the sentinel spell....&lt;which is a crock ir should be unlimited like the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; jboots&gt; but is there anyway to recharge it or maybe does it recharge on<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s own<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &lt;that was suggested to me by a guildmate&gt; or do i just have to get a new<br/>\n&gt; staff?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; which would suck there too....any info would be greatly appreciated on<br/>\n&gt; this...i<br/>\n&gt; &gt; love that staff, and the sentinel effect was really kewl and would come in<br/>\n&gt; handy<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in places like cazic and lower guk....<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (&#92;/)ystix Spellchaser<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lv 40 cleric of The Rathe<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  the best source for group communications.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Join a new list today!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
