Says hi, and then continues, she&#39;s been known to<br/>\nunload fine steel loot, and all her gold, silver and copper on the person<br/>\n(platinum if she&#39;s on the way out) Just to say THANK YOU for not asking for<br/>\nanything.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone asks her for help finding a corpse, she&#39;ll do that.<br/>\nJust about anything else will get you a cold shoulder. ESP asking for things<br/>\nthat you should be out killing bats and decaying skeletons to work your way<br/>\nup to.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor myself, when I have things to get rid of, I go out into a newbie area<br/>\nand find someone actually killing monsters.

Rule number<br/>\n&gt;one is don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;do it.  I never ever respond to someone who asks me for things, I dislike<br/>\n&gt;beggars.  I will gladly help another who merely just chats with<br/>\n&gt;me, if I get<br/>\n&gt;to talking with someone.  I will offer all kinds of information<br/>\n&gt;and advise,<br/>\n&gt;as well as giving items and cash.  But never never if they ask for it. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
