I am running<br/>\na high elf cleric on Erollisi Marr who is currently nine.  My problem is<br/>\nthat is hard to get into a group since a lot still want to solo at this age<br/>\nlevel and the groups that do offer want to either go to Crushbone or like<br/>\ntoday to the Chessboard.   When I have grouped I try to aid in melee and<br/>\nstill watch the health of the party members.  I do not use Furor at all in<br/>\ncombat saving my mana for healing and buffing only.  I have also had a group<br/>\nnot give me a chance to med back to even 50% before starting to fight again.<br/>\nAnother problem of course is that once I begin to heal the mob starts<br/>\nbeating on me and they cannot pull it off.  I try not to fight back when<br/>\nthis happens to give them a chance to get it off me though.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did manage to purchase a couple of 2 wisdom rings today for a total of<br/>\n2pp.  These are the first stat enhancing items I have gotten.  As usual I am<br/>\nalmost completely broke now after buying my ninth level spells and the<br/>\nrings.   I am still wearing a mixture of leather, PW and cloth armor and<br/>\nusing a cracked staff in combat.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am open to any and all suggestions that you elders my wish to impart upon<br/>\nme.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you,<br/>\nYilari<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Mikaela&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mikaela1@...\">mikaela1@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yes, Anne, I agree that first and foremost we are and should be healers.<br/>\n&gt; THAT is our primary role in EQ.
