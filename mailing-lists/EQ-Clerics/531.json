Is to have a strict RP server (hell,<br/>\npeople could privatelly lease it from Verant or something) and then have<br/>\nactual applications for approval on who can play on it. Then, have<br/>\nvolunteers (like the guides) who actually do more than just answer<br/>\ntechnical questions, they actually monitor RPing. Of course, people could<br/>\nlie on their applications or just make up historical backgrounds of their<br/>\ncharacters and then not hold to them or get their Mom to write the essay<br/>\nfor them, but those people would hopefully get caught by their peers or by<br/>\nthe Guides. <br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, everyone would have to agree to a disclaimer when they sign up<br/>\nfor this server, but hell we agree to some jargon I never read every time<br/>\nwe logon. So, that would take care of whiny 12 year olds who might get mad<br/>\nif they get caught not RPing while they lied on their application to get<br/>\nin, and we would not get sued, heh.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, that is my dream server and who knows perhaps with enough support<br/>\na bunch of die-hard RP&#39;ers could pull it off.
