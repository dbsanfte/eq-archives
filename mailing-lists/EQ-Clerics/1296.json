LOL i am a human cleric and had <br/>\nno troule doing said quest, in fact it was one of the easier ones i have <br/>\ndone.  Now for my question, what exactly does clense do?  I was under the <br/>\nimpression that it took of negitive effects on the player, tho it always <br/>\nseems to clense me when i dont need it, and there are only 30 charges on it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I have no clue how to get it recharged.  I am a lvl 24 cleric on Xegony, <br/>\nand am now using a screaming mace which i perfer, the SSoL was nice, fast, <br/>\nand consistant in the amount of damg it did, but the effect was wasted on my<br/>\n<br/>\ntoon as i never seem to get many neg effects on me.  Suffice it to say I <br/>\ngave my SSoL to a noobie that was begging, LOL he loved it and i was happy <br/>\nto help, as far as what it is worth, i have no clue as i would pay nothing <br/>\nover 20p for it and thats going above the value to me.  It&#39;s prob worth alot<br/>\n<br/>\nto ppl who want them badly and less to others that don&#39;t.   just INHO, stay <br/>\nsafe and have fun<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Deane, Ben&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:BDeane@...\">BDeane@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: RE: [EQ-Clerics] Hmm..trying to get back to cleric questions.<br/>\n&gt;Date: Mon, 13 Sep 1999 08:06:18 -0700<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: &quot;Deane, Ben&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:BDeane@...\">BDeane@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The SSoL is a funny thing. It is probably worth more than it seems. Similar<br/>\n&gt;weapons for pure casters (e.g. Water Crystal staff) I&#39;ve seen selling for<br/>\n&gt;100pp+. The SSoL is basically a mediocre weapon, but with a pretty useful<br/>\n&gt;effect. Many clerics cannot do the quest (or don&#39;t want to spend time<br/>\n&gt;building faction). To them, it may be fairly desirable.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I traded my first one to a lvl 30 Teir&#39;dal cleric in return for a pair of<br/>\n&gt;crested spaulders (AC11, +6sta), and I think I got the better deal. So I<br/>\n&gt;would say: make your way over to East Commons or Nektulos and you may get a<br/>\n&gt;good price.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Elbeno<br/>\n&gt;16 times blessed by Karana<br/>\n&gt;Bristlebane<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Trizzen Do&#39;Trevan [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:trizzen@...\">trizzen@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [EQ-Clerics] Hmm..trying to get back to cleric questions.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Second: I know that prices very greatly from server to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; server, but what<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sort of price range am I looking at if I want to sell my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; shinig star of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; light mace? around 20pp, around 100pp??
