It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; fairly difficult to get (mine was given to me), but you could probably<br/>\n&gt; buy one.  It does weigh a fair bit, but gives +10 vs. magic.  Other<br/>\n&gt; than a shield, I&#39;m not sure what you can hold in an off-hand.  Besides<br/>\n&gt; a light source such as a lantern.  :) </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
