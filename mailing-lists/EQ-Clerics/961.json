Arguing back and forth only<br/>\nclutters everyone&#39;s mailbox.  And because this mailing list does not<br/>\nexist in the land of Norrath, RP-ing here is merely a waste of time -<br/>\nwhen it is knowledge that should be shared here.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond - I am level 34.  Anyone level 39 or higher have information on<br/>\nany additional DD spells that cleric will receive above wrath in damage<br/>\namount that are NOT only for use on undead??
