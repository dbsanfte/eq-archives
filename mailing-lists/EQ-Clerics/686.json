If they<br/>\nare that rare, then they are unique, and then as soon as that person<br/>\ngot killed the owner would become the only person in the whole world<br/>\nto have them.  These are called artifacts and are unique.  But this<br/>\nkind of game has no room for artifacts.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHEY! You&#39;re absolutely right. And I have an idea. First, improve EQ&#39;s<br/>\nquest elements,  then make unique items like journeyman boots quest<br/>\nitems. VERY DIFFICULT items could be part of a VERY DIFFICULT quest, but<br/>\nthat&#39;s ok, cause there would be no camping, no kill stealing, and you<br/>\nwould be doing a lot more exploring and getting experience while doing<br/>\nit. And, I think, you&#39;d be having a lot more fun using your brain than<br/>\nusing the /gesture command (after that 35th level wizard just stole your<br/>\nkill for the 3rd time in the same day). What do you think? I mean, isn&#39;t<br/>\nthat why they call it EVERquest?<br/>\n<br/>\nSaidinn D&#39;iniluki<br/>\nDark Elf Cleric<br/>\nKarana server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
