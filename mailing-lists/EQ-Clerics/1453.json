Even I, a person who originally <br/>\ncame from the temple of Life, needed to raise my faction in order to do the <br/>\nquest. But to be quite honest, I did the quest simply cause I had never done <br/>\na quest before, I tried the weapon out like once to see what the effect was <br/>\nand it has sat in the bank ever since.<br/>\n<br/>\nBree Wyndsdale<br/>\n47th Cleric of Fennin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Jeff Habermann &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jrhabermann@...\">jrhabermann@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: [EQ-Clerics] Shining Star of Light<br/>\n&gt;Date: Tue, 21 Sep 1999 10:25:31 -0700<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I keep reading that everyone on here loves to use there SSOL.
