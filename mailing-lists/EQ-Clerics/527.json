We all are striving for a better place to &#39;live&#39; (even if it is <br/>\nexcapisim).  What servers do ya play on?  I know me and my group would love <br/>\nto have an extra cleric along that would rp with us... as long as ya dont <br/>\nmind the times we slip OOC. but as I have found out... the more some folks <br/>\nare IC the more myself and others in the group will stay IC....<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my 2 pp worth..<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJaxim<br/>\n19th cirlce (and yes sooo damn close to the next) circle of enlightenment...<br/>\n<br/>\non the Tarew Marr server...

Nothing is ever perfect, and <br/>\n&gt;I<br/>\n&gt;chose to gripe about what was not perfect. Everquest is a great game <br/>\n&gt;besides<br/>\n&gt;the events I had to endure.<br/>\n&gt;Perhaps I did venture with some bad people- I have learned from the earlier<br/>\n&gt;posts that there are some great people out there in EQ. Perhaps I just have<br/>\n&gt;the worse luck in the world when I am grouping.<br/>\n&gt;  I am sorry to place my anger on EQ on this mailing list. I just wish <br/>\n&gt;people<br/>\n&gt;wouldnt think about reaching that next level so much- but I have learned <br/>\n&gt;from<br/>\n&gt;the earlier posts that it is not true.<br/>\n&gt;  I must have the worse luck on meeting people on the two servers I mainly<br/>\n&gt;play!! Sorry everyone :) igore my earlier posts :)<br/>\n&gt;   T Alexander<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Campaign 2000 is here!<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Discuss your thoughts; get informed at ONElist.
