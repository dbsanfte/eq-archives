I tried creating new characters on other<br/>\n&gt; servers but what I found was that while I didn&#39;t miss the &quot;twinking&quot; I did<br/>\n&gt; with my other babies on The Rathe, what I DID miss were my friends and my<br/>\n&gt; guild and all the things we did together.  (Can&#39;t live without green<br/>\nspam!!)<br/>\n&gt; So for me, going to another server isn&#39;t really an option right now.  It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; really the people that keep me coming back to EQ, not just the game.  If I<br/>\n&gt; could bundle them all up and take them to Test, I would, but<br/>\nunfortunately,<br/>\n&gt; it isn&#39;t gonna happen.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Mik<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Heather M.

Well, we decided<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; &gt; take a break and I am having a blast.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; We created characters on the test server. No Spam, No crowding, and no<br/>\n&gt; &gt; problems so far about finding stuff to hunt. We are still very young yet<br/>\n&gt; &gt; though and it is fun having to work for all our stuff again.

My thought are I have always<br/>\nliked<br/>\n&gt; &gt; playign the cleric and well if we are gonna go anywhere on Test, you<br/>\nhave<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have a cleric so I am happy to repeat.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Just thought I would share that with everyone, I am having a blast once<br/>\n&gt; &gt; again =)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Bree, 50th cleric of Fennin Ro<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Laurelei, 4th cleric of Test<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
