It&#39;s pretty easy for a cleric to spread out<br/>\nthe spawn to where you have one about every 5 mins. And if things do get<br/>\nugly, you have a zone and guards right there. There&#39;s also a vendor & bank<br/>\nin Keep. The bandits drop some coin, but more importantly the occasional<br/>\nbronze weapon and gemstone. Once you get the spawns spread out, you want to<br/>\nwork inside the cave, since there&#39;s a roaming guard outside that will steal<br/>\nyour kill.<br/>\nOnce they don&#39;t give good exp anymore, just move into Keep. Sure it&#39;s<br/>\nboring, it&#39;s a great place to level. And loot includes plat coin, fs weapons<br/>\nand small bronze armor as you move down into warrior room and then raider<br/>\nroom. And while you&#39;re waiting in line for a group, there a named prisoner<br/>\nyou can solo back in the jail area that will give you exp til about lev 32.<br/>\n<br/>\nPantheus<br/>\nlev 35 on EM<br/>\n<br/>\nPS: Another nice thing about workin in the HHP/HHK area at these levels is<br/>\nyou&#39;re close to the spawn for the Testament. Once you get your bandit spawns<br/>\ntimed out, you can easily run to smuggler room to check for the gaurd<br/>\nbetween spawns.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Curtis Bennett [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:die_kluge@...\">die_kluge@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, December 07, 1999 1:39 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [EQ-Clerics] places to solo<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Curtis Bennett&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:die_kluge@...\">die_kluge@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there a good place to solo for a cleric (myself, namely &lt;g&gt;) at<br/>\nlevel 22?
