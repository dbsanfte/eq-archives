Most of the time I like to use my hammer because<br/>\nI like the sound of &#39;crunch&#39; that it makes when it hits for 25.  I<br/>\nswitch to the SSOL and my SBS when I am fighting spell-casters and<br/>\nneed the extra speed to interrupt their casting, and cleansing myself<br/>\nis nice, too.<br/>\n  So, bottom-line is, if you make the trip to Qeynos, do the SSOL<br/>\nquest (real handy to read the quest first, as it involves Rivervale),<br/>\nand pick up Trumpy Irontoe&#39;s head while you&#39;re at it so that you can<br/>\npick up a bloodforge hammer.  Trumpy&#39;s head is nodrop so if your<br/>\ndwarf faction isn&#39;t amiably, too, you might have to wag his head<br/>\naround for a while until you get it there.<br/>\n<br/>\n  On that note, the orc belt quest is an incredibly good quest to<br/>\nraise the dwarven faction.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Jeff Habermann &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jrhabermann@...\">jrhabermann@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] Shining Star of Light<br/>\n&gt;Date: Tue, 21 Sep 1999 13:04:16 -0700<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: Jeff Habermann &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jrhabermann@...\">jrhabermann@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks for all the help.

Most clerics will toss it once they get a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; screaming mace, or a BEM, or gem-encrusted scepter.  Because the quest<br/>\n&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t involves only killing bixies in Rivervale you can do this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; quest at an extremely low level.  I did the blessed oil quest over<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and over again.  It took me about 15 times or more of doing this.  I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; am a high elf, and I think I was apprehensive when I started.  Maybe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; dubious, I don&#39;t remember.  You have to get well into amiably to get<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the quest.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Another really good quest that I&#39;m doing now in my spare time is the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; diseased wolf quest.  You can kill rabid wolves and rabid grizzlies<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in Qeynos hills and give the pelts to Priestess Caulria in the UFO.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I turned in 4 wolf pelts and 1 grizzly pelt, got a plat for the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; grizzly pelt, and &#39;endure disease&#39; a 14th level spell (which you can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; buy for 4 plat, or sell for 6-7 gold).  I turned in these pelts, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; at 15th level, I got nearly a half a bar of experience.  Not bad<br/>\n&gt; &gt; considering 90% of rabid wolves die with one smite spell.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;From: &quot;Heather Daley&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:blushn@...\">blushn@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Our guildmaster, who is a paladin, just recently needed to raise his<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;faction<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;with the priests of Life, in order to obtain his soulfire sword.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Basically what we did to help raise his faction was:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;1) killing putrid skellies in South Karana(at Grimrots Camp)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;2) Turning in diseased animal pelts to the Temple of Life<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;3) Doing the Blessed oil Quest til he turned green<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;These will all raise your faction there. Even I, a person who <br/>\n&gt;originally<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;came from the temple of Life, needed to raise my faction in order to do<br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;quest. But to be quite honest, I did the quest simply cause I had never<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;done<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;a quest before, I tried the weapon out like once to see what the effect<br/>\n&gt;was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;and it has sat in the bank ever since.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Bree Wyndsdale<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;47th Cleric of Fennin Ro<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;From: Jeff Habermann &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jrhabermann@...\">jrhabermann@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;I keep reading that everyone on here loves to use there SSOL.

I am a human cleric from the Temple of <br/>\n&gt;Marr<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Freeport.  Will i have problems trying to do the quest, or will i be <br/>\n&gt;ok?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Just want to make sure, before I make that loooong journy from <br/>\n&gt;freeport<br/>\n&gt;to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;qeynos.
