Because when you do cast a heal and draw attention you<br/>\ndon&#39;t want to get damaged enough to require you to heal yourself or another<br/>\nmember has to do the same.  You or another party member will quickly burn up<br/>\nan excess of 48 mana healing you in such a case.  At higher levels it takes<br/>\nvery little time for a mob or single creature to do 300+ damage to you<br/>\nbefore they can be taunted away.<br/>\n<br/>\nA lot also depends on what wis increasing items you have.  I have a 160<br/>\nwisdom without using the BS Tunic and Gator Skin Leggings.  If you are<br/>\nlacking good wis items in other areas I would use anything you can find<br/>\nuntil you are 150+, then you can work on increasing your AC.  Magic<br/>\nresistance is also a consideration in different circumstances.  I will<br/>\nchange out a Lizard Scale Mantle for a BS Mantle if I am hunting high level<br/>\nmagic using creatures for the increased magic resistance.  It doesn&#39;t take<br/>\nlong for a Festering Hag to send you back to your bind point with a low<br/>\nresistance.<br/>\n<br/>\nObmi<br/>\nLvl 33 Cleric on Karana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
