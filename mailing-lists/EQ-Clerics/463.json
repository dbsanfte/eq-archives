You<br/>\ndon&#39;t need to be fighting monsters 20 levels above, and I didn&#39;t say this<br/>\nwas what was happening. This game can be played with monsters 5 levels above<br/>\nyou, or maybe a little more. All you have to get in, under the scenario<br/>\ndescribed, is one or two blows. You will be credited with a solo kill, and<br/>\nget a large amount of experience, much more than you could earn fighting<br/>\nblues or even whites on your own, or yellows or reds in a group. You will<br/>\nlevel with unnatural rapidity.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know this happens, a fellow group member described it being done for him.<br/>\nI don&#39;t think it happens very often; upper level people get tired of it ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose the only point is that in any complex system, people will try to<br/>\n&#39;game&#39; the system, exploiting its weak points for maximum advantage.<br/>\n<br/>\n== Gilead, dwarven cleric of Fennin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Rob Berryhill &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:racefan@...\">racefan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Monday, July 12, 1999 11:26 PM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [EQ-Clerics] Twinking & Kiting<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Rob Berryhill&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:racefan@...\">racefan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Umm, no.
