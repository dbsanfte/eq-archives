Nor do I see any SoW change.<br/>\n<br/>\nActually here it is, directly from eq.stratics.com:<br/>\n<br/>\nSeptember 13th, 9:00am<br/>\n----------------------<br/>\nBug Fixes:<br/>\n- Players levitating should be easier for other PCs to see.<br/>\n- When charmed/feared and killed players should not be returned to the<br/>\ncharacter selection screen.<br/>\n- Lore items in containers that are dropped should not be destroyed. <br/>\n- Charged items, such as the Staff of the Observers, should correctly report<br/>\nthe number of charges remaining after zoning.<br/>\n- Corpses should remain lootable even if a player goes linkdead while<br/>\nlooting <br/>\n- A player under the effect of charm or fear can no longer open their<br/>\nspellbook or sit in order to escape the effects of these spells. <br/>\n- A player using online help should no longer be locked into the help screen<br/>\nif another party initiates a trade.<br/>\n- Non-melee items equipped in weapon slots should no longer mutate if the pc<br/>\nis charmed.<br/>\n- Extremely large NPCs, ie Vox, should not suicide when stuck.<br/>\n<br/>\nNew emotes:<br/>\n- Here is a list of new emotes that have been added to the game: agree,<br/>\namaze, apologize, applaud, plead, bite, bleed, blink, blush, boggle, bonk,<br/>\nbored, brb, burp, bye, cackle, calm, clap, comfort, congratulate, cough,<br/>\ncringe, curious, dance, drool , duck, eye, gasp, giggle, glare, grin ,<br/>\ngroan, grovel, happy, hungry, introduce, jk (just kidding) , kneel, lost,<br/>\nmassage, moan, mourn , peer, point, ponder, puzzle, raise, ready, roar,<br/>\nsalute, shiver, shrug, sigh, smirk, snarl, snicker, stare, tap, tease,<br/>\nthank, thirsty, veto, welcome, whine, whistle, yawn<br/>\n<br/>\nPVP Changes:<br/>\n- In order to make PVP combat between spellcasters and melee types more<br/>\nviable some changes to PVP spell effects have been made. All damage spells<br/>\ncast in PVP combat will do less damage to the PC than the same spell would<br/>\ndo to an NPC. When a PC is under the effect of a root-type spell there is a<br/>\n20% chance that they will break free when a direct damage spell is cast upon<br/>\nthem.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpell Changes:<br/>\n- Levitate: All players may now cancel this effect. <br/>\n- Paralyzing Earth now Wizard and Necromancer useable. <br/>\n- The Mana cost on some Magician damage shields has been slightly reduced <br/>\n- Alter Plane: Hate and Alter Plane: Sky have been changed into higher level<br/>\nspells.<br/>\n- Succor: Ro (Druid) is now a level 39 spell (previously a typo as a level<br/>\n49 spell)<br/>\n- Curse of the Simple Mind (Enchanter) now lowers both Int AND Wis. <br/>\n- Selo`s Consonant Chain (Bard) should now work better.<br/>\n- Shadow Vortex (Necro) is more effective.<br/>\n- Screaming Terror is now an all or nothing save <br/>\n- this should stop the &#39;train&#39; problems that it was causing.<br/>\n- Gravity Flux will now research correctly for Wizards.<br/>\n- Lich and Bond of Death are now researchable for Necromancers <br/>\n- check your tomes.<br/>\n- The different types of Words of Collection and Words of Acquisition are<br/>\nnow more easily identifiable.<br/>\n- Dead Man Walking (Necromancer) has been renamed Dead Man Floating <br/>\n- Ignite Bones (Necromancer) has had the movement component removed. This<br/>\nmeans that it will no longer break root and snare spells, and that it will<br/>\nnow stack with the darkness line.<br/>\n- Syvelian`s Anti-Magic Aria (Bard) has been fixed.<br/>\n- A bug in some of the AoE code has been fixed <br/>\n- AoE spells will now effect more monsters.<br/>\n- Some Magician Summoned items are now lore items. Items that have turned<br/>\nlore have had other small benefits added to them.<br/>\n- Dance of the Fireflies (Druid) has been changed from Divination to<br/>\nConjuration.<br/>\n- Rangers have gained the spell Dance of the Fireflies (level 15)<br/>\n- High Level Enchanter Illusion spells have had the remainder of their<br/>\neffects implemented.<br/>\n- Magi research components have been added to more monsters throughout the<br/>\nworld.<br/>\n- There is a new pet command: /pet taunt and /pet notaunt. Pets default to<br/>\n/pet taunt<br/>\n- The Rods for the Ice Comet quests will now pop much more often.<br/>\n- Envenomed Breath (Shaman) has had its damage raised slightly.<br/>\n- Scourge (Necromancer and Shaman) has had its damage raised slightly.<br/>\n- Enchantment of Light and Enchantment of Brilliance (Enchanter) have<br/>\nbeenreplaced by new enchantment spells. These spells have been added to a<br/>\nhidden vendor somewhere in the game.<br/>\n- New quests for Necromancers to research their pets have been added<br/>\n<br/>\nPets:<br/>\n- High level pets (44th and 49th lvl spells) do less damage<br/>\n- Pets will now navigate some outdoor and dungeon areas better<br/>\n<br/>\nDoT Changes:<br/>\n- If the monster is in melee with you, there is no change to how a DoT spell<br/>\nworks.<br/>\n- If the monster is running away from you (fear, wounded, etc.), there is no<br/>\nchange to how a DoT spell works.<br/>\n- If the monster is moving when the damage from the DoT is applied (happens<br/>\nevery few seconds), it will take 66% of the damage that it would have taken.<br/>\n<br/>\n- DoT spells have all had their duration slightly increased. If the monster<br/>\nmoves for 18 seconds during a fight, it will take as much damage from the<br/>\nDoT as it would before the patch. If the monster moves for less then 18<br/>\nseconds during a fight, your DoT will do more damage then it would have done<br/>\nbefore the patch. If the monster moves more then 18 seconds during the<br/>\nfight, it will take less damage then it would have before the patch.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Heather Daley [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:blushn@...\">blushn@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: 1999/09/14 10:25 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] New Patch<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Heather Daley&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:blushn@...\">blushn@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, well i didn&#39;t play EQ last night so I din&#39;t actually read the new patch <br/>\nfor myself, but I was on Battlecom with a friend who read it to me. Am I <br/>\nunder the correct assumption that they nerfed our buffs??  I am told that <br/>\nthey do not last nearly as long as they used to. This Whole new patch from <br/>\nmy understanding is the icing on the cake for Verant, they really get first <br/>\nprize for F@#$ing the game up.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of the High level clerics who have ever hunted in Sol B or L Guk, or <br/>\nhave helped a Paladin friend kill Sir Lucan, knows what its like buffing to <br/>\nprepare for these events.  ok so now our buffs don&#39;t last half as long as <br/>\nthey did and if you don&#39;t have a manastone or an enchanter, that leaves us <br/>\npretty much screwed. the time it takes to regain mana after buffing, you <br/>\nwill have to start buffing over again. Verant does everything they possibly <br/>\ncan to screw with each class and the success people have in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel extremely sorry for the druids and the necromancers of the game, i <br/>\nknow everyone has their own opinions about kiting, but lets face it, this is<br/>\n<br/>\nwhat these classes do, now they have screwed up DOTs, they have made SoW <br/>\nonly last like 10 minutes instead of about 25,I bet they f$%^ed up snare as <br/>\nwell, and they nerfed all the pets.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk and the KING of all Verants high and mighty decisions. LETS NOT FIX A <br/>\nPROBLEM LETS JUST MAKE SOMETHING ELSE WORSE. Point in case, The Box of <br/>\nAbu&#39;kar 100% weight reduction, Verants code F&#39;d up and lvl 6 mobs were <br/>\ndropping them in Butcherblock or something similiar, SO the almighty Verant <br/>\ninstead of Fixing the damn goblins went and Changed the Box. Beware if you <br/>\nare a meleeist with a variety of weapons when you log into the Game you will<br/>\n<br/>\nbe encumbered.   I think it was quite nice of them to change the box from <br/>\n100% to a measly 10%. SO hence don&#39;t fix the problem just screw everyone <br/>\nover.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;braces herself for a rippin&gt;<br/>\nLet the Flames begin,<br/>\nBree Wyndsdale<br/>\n46th nerfed cleric of Fennin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nONElist:  your connection to people who share your interests.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
