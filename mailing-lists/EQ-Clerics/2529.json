One<br/>\ncaveat: fear is BAD in dungeons.  The AE fear (wave of fear) is a great<br/>\nspell later as it can be used to get the MOBs off of the group while the<br/>\nevac&#39;er gets off his/her ggate.<br/>\n<br/>\nAstur il&#39;Ayan, Cleric of Brell<br/>\nSCARAB on Solusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Curtis Bennett&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:die_kluge@...\">die_kluge@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I just made 24, and just bought my spells<br/>\n&gt; greater healing<br/>\n&gt; bravery<br/>\n&gt; wave of fear<br/>\n&gt; counteract poison<br/>\n&gt; symbol of Ryltan (and 20 bloodstones)<br/>\n&gt; dismiss undead<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I didn&#39;t buy hammer of striking (what a joke), and I didn&#39;t buy<br/>\n&gt; instill fear.

I figured wave of fear<br/>\n&gt; would be really, really handy, but instill fear was kind of worthless<br/>\n&gt; compared to it, if I understand them correctly.
