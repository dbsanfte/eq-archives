The Druid spell was typo&#39;d at 49 instead of 39 and we DID care.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, at least in the game I play in, if a ruling is made that turns<br/>\nout to be unbalancing, the gamemaster DOES reserve the right to go<br/>\nback and rework the rules so it is no longer unbalancing. Otherwise,<br/>\nthe game becomes not fun for the rest of the players.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if the Box was unbalancing or not. But Verant is the gamemaster<br/>\nhere. The gamemaster is always right. If you don&#39;t like the way the gamemaster<br/>\nchooses to run the game, you have two choices 1) try to convince the<br/>\nGM that they are messing things up instead of helping 2) leave and go<br/>\nplay under a different Gm.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf enough people do (2) then the GM might get the idea that hey are<br/>\nmessing up. Or they might decide they don&#39;t want to run that type of<br/>\ngame that people want to play under and just not run  a game at all.<br/>\n<br/>\n===================================================<br/>\nSarah\t\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sarah@...\">sarah@...</a><br/>\n===================================================<br/>\nMy picture of the world is of masses of people extending gifts to other <br/>\npeople, doing favors -- but nobody keeping score. -- Dr. Whitsett<br/>\n===================================================</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
