You meditate and heal your fighters. When you have the<br/>\nmana up you can take a few swings at those crocs and caimans aswell. This<br/>\nshould work swell up to 19. The only drawback is the money. You wont get<br/>\nany what so ever. But Xp wise it&#39;s brilliant. If you want to solo i can<br/>\nsuggest SRO. Usually pretty empty there (at Solusek Ro atleast). There you<br/>\ncan kill ghouls, tarantulas and dry bone skels (easy with those).<br/>\nHope it might help you.<br/>\n<br/>\nI come in peace ..<br/>\n&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;Bracket Starreach of Solusek Ro&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
