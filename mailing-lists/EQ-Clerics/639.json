If it weren&#39;t for this, the game would seem too easy. I think<br/>\nthis kind of game balance is great for the most part. However, I question<br/>\ncertain classes, which is why I choose to play the ones that I think have<br/>\nthe best balance.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\tPerhaps a Princess...

Whereas, with pure spellcasters, even at 35+ in level, they<br/>\n&gt; are being nearly killed (and killed) by MOBs MUCH lower in level<br/>\n&gt; than them. if you get a MOB on THEM during a dungeon crawl, you<br/>\n&gt; HAVE to get the MOB off right away.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Be patient. Level 8 will come. My druid is having some of the same<br/>\n&gt; impatience<br/>\n&gt; problems being level 13 with level 14 dangling in front of her eyes :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; EVERY level of spells, by the time it becomes close to time to your<br/>\n&gt; next level, starts to look weak against the monsters. Similarly with <br/>\n&gt; meditate. I don&#39;t think anything needs to change. This just shows that<br/>\n&gt; they chose a good place to put the skill in, whenyou absolutely<br/>\n&gt; can not stand to wait any longer :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sarah Heacock<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Fri, 23 Jul 1999, Walt Zimbeck wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Walt Zimbeck&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wzimbeck@...\">wzimbeck@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I was wondering what the proper procedure was to petition for a change.<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; do not know about the rest of you but I feel that clerics should get<br/>\n&gt; &gt; meditate at six and not have to wait until eight for it.  My seventh<br/>\n&gt; level<br/>\n&gt; &gt; cleric spends a lot of time just sitting waiting for mana for restore.<br/>\n&gt; It<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is really glaring when you are grouped with spell casters and after the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; battle you heal them up and then have to sit for five or ten minutes to<br/>\n&gt; get<br/>\n&gt; &gt; your mana back when they are ready to go again in just two or three<br/>\n&gt; minutes.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Let me know your feelings on this and I will try to get it started if<br/>\n&gt; there<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is enough support and if not then I will just live with it the way it<br/>\n&gt; is.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; On a side note a very strange thing happened to me this morning.   I was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hunting in Butcherblock and ran out of food.   Rather than making the<br/>\n&gt; long<br/>\n&gt; &gt; run back to Felwithe for more food I decided to gate.   I got a message<br/>\n&gt; &gt; about that zone being down and that they would put me in a safe place<br/>\n&gt; within<br/>\n&gt; &gt; my zone.   The safe place ended up just outside the dwarf city and I was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; near the GF zone point, but that is not the problem.   Everything except<br/>\n&gt; &gt; keyboard locked up tight.   I could not use my mouse to do anything at<br/>\n&gt; all.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; No casting, no sitting, no selling or buying and worst of all no camping<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; escape that mess and of course no GM&#39;s or Guides around.   I could not<br/>\n&gt; even<br/>\n&gt; &gt; do a soft boot to escape and ended up doing a hard re-boot.     I<br/>\n&gt; suppose<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that maybe I could have tried to get back to the GF zone point and try<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; zone out to see if that cleared it up but my defensive spells were about<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wear off and I could not refresh them.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thanks all for listening to my rantings,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Congratulations SAYNO2DRUGS.
