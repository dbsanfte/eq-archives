We also killed<br/>\n&gt; Lrodd, who gave us GREAT exp<br/>\n&gt; back then.  I never went anywhere my entire P4 beta<br/>\n&gt; days after level 9<br/>\n&gt; except Befallen, and we levelled like crazy.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That has not changed one bit. The first floor is very<br/>\nsafe as long as you stay away from the one path all<br/>\ntrains follow, and away from the well. This will keep<br/>\nyou from fighting in the main room, and one side room<br/>\nthat is located above the spiral stairs. The rest of<br/>\nthe level is train free. There are plenty of skeletons<br/>\nto go around, the shadowknight is there to kill for<br/>\nfun, and lrodd for the incredible exp. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In live, we went to Befallen about mid-teens I<br/>\n&gt; think, and did well on the<br/>\n&gt; second floor down.  The problem was there were a LOT<br/>\n&gt; of trains. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Very true, the side area of the second floor is nasty<br/>\nsince there are a few necros and skeletons scattered<br/>\nthat will assist fights in adjoining rooms.<br/>\nEssentially second floor is a waste since you die too<br/>\nmuch from the trains on the third floor, and clearing<br/>\nout the rooms to the female/ogre sk is really not<br/>\nworth it. It&#39;s better to wait until level 16/17 and go<br/>\ndirectly to level 3. Of course, this means in a<br/>\nsizeable group. 4 level 17-20 characters can break the<br/>\nspawn on the third level and then just clean up on exp<br/>\nand items. The rewards for doing this are the Gossimer<br/>\nrobes/thaumaturgist robes/dagger of marnek/wand of<br/>\nmarnek/bone bladed claymore. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn summary, incredible place for levels 9-12, great<br/>\nplace for levels 16-20 or so. The troubles people have<br/>\nis when they either try to solo, or go to level 2/3 at<br/>\nmid teen levels. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have done this with two clerics and a necro. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nEylena</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
