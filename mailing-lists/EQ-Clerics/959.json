BTW I find that contradicting.<br/>\n&gt; Evil + Cleric just seems a bit ironic.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; For those clerics who are not fill with hate, yes, I do believe since we are<br/>\n&gt; gifted with the ability to heal we should do all we can to sustain life over<br/>\n&gt; death.

As a child of Hate, my only duty is to tend to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Innoruuk&#39;s followers to ensure his greater glory.  All others are merely<br/>\n&gt; &gt; fuel to feed his fires, like kindling.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Vylkan, Servant of Hate<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Tallon Zek<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m new to this mail list, and thought I would introduce<br/>\n&gt; &gt; myself with a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;topic<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to discuss.  I&#39;ve often wondered what exactly it means to be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a cleric in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Norrath.  My personal opinion is that we should always be merciful to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;those<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; around us, and help in any way we can.  Even if to heal<br/>\n&gt; &gt; someone we don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;even<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; know completely depletes our mana.  What do you think of this?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Perhaps that is what Karana asks of you.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;But Innoruk is the God of Hate and Pain. Pain is real. You can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;avoid it. of all the gods, he is the only one honest with his followers.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;He WANTS us killing everything. So why should I use the powers he gives<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;me on those who do not followhim, and will actively work against him?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;              Free Games & Cash Prizes!<br/>\n&gt; Gamesville - The World&#39;s Biggest & Best Game Show Site!<br/>\n&gt;         <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/ad/gamesville0\">http://www.onelist.com/ad/gamesville0</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
