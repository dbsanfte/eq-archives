Then I tried to<br/>\nget a screaming mace once I hit 19th.  I had truly never had to camp<br/>\nanything until I tried to get the bracer of battle off the Orc<br/>\nWarlord.  It changed my perception of the game, and left a bit of a<br/>\nsour taste in my mouth.  I ended up just buying the mace from an old<br/>\nfriend, but I was getting pretty tired of camping for that bracer, I<br/>\ncan tell you that much.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Chris Wheeler &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wheelech@...\">wheelech@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I hope you are all successful.  Personally, I am too impatient to camp for<br/>\n&gt;items, even if it it only takes an hour.  So if your protest helps in that<br/>\n&gt;regard, I am sure it will benfit me as well.  My approach is to just play<br/>\n&gt;the game, amass experience and wealth, and hope that I can buy what I need.<br/>\n&gt;Mind you , I&#39;m only 16th level now, so in the future, I may need to camp <br/>\n&gt;for<br/>\n&gt;stuff.  But so far, I have not camped for a single thing, I am happy with<br/>\n&gt;what my character can and can&#39;t do, and have no complaints about world<br/>\n&gt;called Norrath. The only complaints I have I can live with, and they mostly<br/>\n&gt;have to do with the UI of the game and with GM conduct.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;From: Jeff Portwine [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jdport@...\">jdport@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;Sent: 1999/11/30 11:43 AM<br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] Cleric Sit-in<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: &quot;Jeff Portwine&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jdport@...\">jdport@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Aye, but looking at it from your perspective you could consider that if the<br/>\n&gt;sit-in is successful, it&#39;s possible that the 8 hour camps could be reduced<br/>\n&gt;which would give you LESS time to sit around on purpose (camping for<br/>\n&gt;items)...  =)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;It all depends on how you look at it...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Eachann Bronzeleaf<br/>\n&gt;Cleric of Tunare, Tarew Marr<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt;From: Chris Wheeler &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wheelech@...\">wheelech@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sent: Tuesday, November 30, 1999 11:39 AM<br/>\n&gt;Subject: RE: [EQ-Clerics] Cleric Sit-in<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Chris Wheeler &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wheelech@...\">wheelech@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Well, I&#39;m taking this sit in from a different perspective.

I do enough sitting around, what <br/>\n&gt;with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; trying to find a group and all to play in.
