If a wiz nukes ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-774513046\">Well, not exactly.  A 100pt heal and a 100pt nuke is a bit different.  The way<br/>\nthe taunt works is that any undamaged mob will come after you.  If a wiz nukes<br/>\nfor 80, then starts to get beat on and I heal him for 100, the MOB will not come<br/>\nafter the me.  However, if there were 3 mobs, the other two sure will.  There is<br/>\nsome formula that heals figure into, but it&#39;s not a 1-to-1 relationship on how<br/>\nmuch you heal.   If your puller has a damage shield on him/her, I can still get<br/>\noff that first superior heal without pulling more than 1 in a 3 pull off him.<br/>\nMost of the time I won&#39;t pull anything off him if he has a damage shield on<br/>\n(especially lava shield).<br/>\n<br/>\nLook at the MOBs as we look at them.  I&#39;ll use low level orcs as an example.  If<br/>\nthere was an orc warrior, an orc wizard (ok, no such thing exists, but for<br/>\nargument sake pretend!), and an orc priest that were all blue to you, which one<br/>\ndo your group take out first?  It may hurt with the wizard casting on you, but<br/>\nyou take out the priest first, then the wiz, then the warrior.  You may have one<br/>\nperson trying to distract the wizard and the main tank taunt the warrior to keep<br/>\nhim of the casters and the cleric, but the priest has to die first or it gets a<br/>\nlot harder.  MOB IA is very similar to this.  Just like when we see that Orc<br/>\nPriest / Lizardman Judicator / Cleric of Innoruuk (unless you have an enchanter<br/>\nthat can mes them) then healer has to die first, MOBs think along the same lines<br/>\nbut take in to account the amount of damage that&#39;s been done to them and the<br/>\nadditional hate built up (through taunt effects).  If they didn&#39;t take this into<br/>\naccount, the healing classes would be a lot harder to play as you&#39;ve have to<br/>\nhave to do crowd control and heal.<br/>\n<br/>\nAilamil the Longwinded strikes again!<br/>\nTunare&#39;s most devout servant<br/>\nTarew Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPrevious Post:<br/>\noh, it&#39;s true!   I believe that the monsters see a 100pt heal as a 100pt hit<br/>\non them... so if you do a greater heal or a superior heal, it&#39;s like a<br/>\nreally big area effect nuke so far as they are concerned.  Heal spells are a<br/>\nhuge huge taunt...<br/>\n<br/>\nEachann Bronzeleaf<br/>\nCleric of Tunare, Tarew Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
