You should have specialized in alteration(hopefully guys thats the<br/>\nright one for healing:)P) I know a lvl 43 cleric who has specialized in this<br/>\nand the difference is amazing your heals heal more hpts, faster casting very<br/>\nrarely does he not recover if hit when healing and it takes only close to<br/>\nhalf the mana that a cleric who doesn&#39;t specialize uses. The results are<br/>\namazing at higfher lvls. However man dont think im gripping at you because i<br/>\nhave read your other mails and you know what your talking about. Its just i<br/>\nwould have picked the healing specialization....but now that I think about<br/>\nit man your undead spells will be much much more efficient so maybe it was a<br/>\ngood choice. Now if you would have oicked something like divination or<br/>\nconjuring we would have a really  really big problem on our hands. Well<br/>\nthanks for hearing me out man...Later and goodluck.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKrix Mathar<br/>\n<br/>\nGuardians of Lore<br/>\nP.S. The way it goes is when you specialize you can specialize in all your<br/>\nfields but the first one to go over 50 is the one you will be the best at<br/>\nand amy keep going up in all the others can not go past 50..<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Mystik &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mystik@...\">mystik@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Tuesday, June 29, 1999 5:23 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] Specialization<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Mystik &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mystik@...\">mystik@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;i think it does work....i did spec evoc because then i could use less mana<br/>\n </span></blockquote>for<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;offensive spells and save my mana for healing the group when needed.....so<br/>\n </span></blockquote>far,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;it seems to be working ok for me....last night i think i got it up to like<br/>\n </span></blockquote>90,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;but i guess it&#39;ll take a while to show for real....like when it&#39;s 150<br/>\n&gt;higher....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Alvarez, Ruben (consultant) wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; From: &quot;Alvarez, Ruben (consultant)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ruben.alvarez@...\">ruben.alvarez@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; With the last few patches did they fix specialization for clerics?
