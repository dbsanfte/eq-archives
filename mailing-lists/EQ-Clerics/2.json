I agree, its nice to have a place where clerics can discuss things :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI personally have started to wonder if my role is going to be the same from now on, i.e. staring at the pages of my spell books<br/>\nfor what seems to be ages, then getting up for a short burst of casting, then BAM back to the book again. I recently have been<br/>\nhunting in Unrest, where clerics SHOULD rule, and yet I was told by a shaman that HIS poison spell was more effective then my<br/>\nDismiss undead, and I am a few levels higher then this shaman. It didn&#39;t make me mad so much as disappointed, I truely want to be<br/>\nGREAT at some part in the game, and I thought it was with undead &lt;G&gt; Anyway, this isn&#39;t meant to be a rant in as much as a<br/>\nquestion; do any of you all feel this way at times?<br/>\n<br/>\nBack the those pages!<br/>\n<br/>\nJazebo D&#39;Elysian 28 Cleric Veeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqdungin@...\">eqdungin@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hello , just wanted to say hello to everyone, and hope the list grows! it&#39;s nice to have a place just for clerics to discuss.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Dungin<br/>\n&gt; Level 18 Cleric Rathe<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; What was YOUR favorite part?!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Tell other Star Wars fans at ONElist! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
