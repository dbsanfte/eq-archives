You must have had a really bad group.

I moved on only because I<br/>\nthought I was getting a little stale, and I knew I was going to have to be<br/>\nlevel 24 or 25 before I could safely fight in the barroom or the tower, or<br/>\nlevel 30 before I could go to the basement. And when I hit those levels, I&#39;m<br/>\na&#39;comin&#39; back!<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately, a lot of other people like Unrest, too, which is why it isn&#39;t<br/>\nunusual to see 100 people in that zone on Fennin Ro, evenings =(.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s true, the trains can be amazing. But one nice thing about Unrest is<br/>\nthat the lawn is so wide open, you can often get out of the way of the<br/>\ntrain, which you can&#39;t do in Befallen or Guk, or even Crushbone often. It&#39;s<br/>\nawe inspiring to watch two festering hags, a werebat, a greater darkbone or<br/>\ntwo, a couple of mortuary fungi, a tentacle terror, the dwarven spirit and a<br/>\ngaggle of tormented dead, darkbones, lurking mummies and death beetles<br/>\nthunder past you, headed for the exit!<br/>\n<br/>\n== Gilead, dwarven cleric of Fennin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: LevonQeri &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:baghramian@...\">baghramian@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Friday, July 16, 1999 9:06 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] A good place<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;LevonQeri&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:baghramian@...\">baghramian@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;well the reason I said that came from personal experiance..
