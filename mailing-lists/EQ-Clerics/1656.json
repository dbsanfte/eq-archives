As soon as I installed<br/>\nTSC, I went directly from 7th to 8th (cap in BG:TSC) because I had gotten so<br/>\nmany xp. What fun is it if you have no goals for your character? The thing<br/>\nthat keeps me playing EQ is the fact that I have so many goals to attain.<br/>\nThe abilities and spells are spaced out to where you are dying to get to<br/>\nthat next level. If it wasn&#39;t for this, what reason would we all play?<br/>\n<br/>\nDrizben D&#39;Vorn<br/>\nDefiled High Priest of Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;John Erik Maynus&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jmaynus@...\">jmaynus@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; from 50 to what ever Lvl just cause they have enough exp too.
