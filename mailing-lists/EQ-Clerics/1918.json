We had to pull the priest room and the Champ<br/>\nroom first as we were the first ones there (full spawn).  After buffing everyone<br/>\nI was don&#39;t to 40% mana.  We took the first 2 rooms easily. I guess I should<br/>\ntell you who we had in our group.  50 Monk, 40 Warrior, 41 Warrior, 42 Ranger,<br/>\n39 Druid, and me.  We start spacing the kills in the Kings room so we can take<br/>\nthem one at a time.  A couple other groups come in and they take the Champ and<br/>\nPriest rooms.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, after we had spaced the spawn in the King&#39;s room, I would constantly be at<br/>\nfull mana before the next spawn, so I melee&#39;d along with everyone else, I cast<br/>\nRetribution, I ran around the dungeon doing res&#39;s (make almost 300 plat from<br/>\ndoing them- I don&#39;t charge friends, but these 2 guys I can&#39;t stand died so, even<br/>\nthough I really don&#39;t like them, I res&#39;d them for money  hehe).  I was doing<br/>\nthis for several hours when someone pulls 2 LDCs, a Bat, and a Lava Beattle<br/>\nthrough the area- the priest room get&#39;s wiped out (except one who made it to the<br/>\nzone), the Champ room made the mistake of thinking they could pick off the<br/>\nstraggler (the Lava Beattle).  Well, they get all the bugs back and they evac.<br/>\nWell, we&#39;re sitting up in the King Room nice and safe.  Zone pupolation went<br/>\nfrom 39 to 18.  One group was in the bug area (other side from where the bad<br/>\npull came from) and one was in the noble area.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe,re sitting there talking within our group &quot;Hope the King spawns this time&quot;,<br/>\n&quot;Hey, wouldn&#39;t it be cool if the priest spawned too?&quot;,  &quot;Ya, with the BP&quot;.  I&#39;m<br/>\nthinking, okay, so far we&#39;ve had it easy, but the King and Priest at the same<br/>\ntime is tough!  I say, &quot;If the priest comes up while the King has spawned-<br/>\neveryone but [our main tank-level 41 warrior] on the priest or he will heal the<br/>\nKing until we are all dead.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWell LO AND BEHOLD! ..... it never did happen, that would be a really<br/>\ninteresting story, huh?  But I had a blast being able to swing my mace, cast<br/>\nsome DD, run around pulling (hehe), and make a bit of money!<br/>\n<br/>\nAilamil Faithbringer<br/>\nTarew Marr<br/>\n<br/>\nWho loves building up a story, and really did want to fight the King and Priest<br/>\ntogether- just didn&#39;t work out that way :)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
