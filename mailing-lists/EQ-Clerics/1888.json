As a general rule I melee at the start of a fight (as<br/>\nlong as I have lotsa mana) unless its a caster, then I am stun stun look<br/>\nfor heals stun stun. I also throw a nuke in if the burner is low and a<br/>\nrunner is taking off or stun and let the meleers do their business. BTW<br/>\nstuns are very useful they halt a MOB that is running, doesn&#39;t cancel<br/>\nchains or snares, interupts a caster and stops it damaging for a round<br/>\nand with some of the things we have been fighting they can hit for 60 or<br/>\nmore a time and several attacks a round.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt also helps to get in a group with an enchanter above 29 and a bard<br/>\nabove 32 ;p<br/>\n<br/>\nNiomar wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Niomar&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Niomar@...\">Niomar@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Okay, I am now lvl 10 and really concerned about this.  From what EVERYONE<br/>\n&gt; tells me (which I totally disagree with and the whole subject matter makes<br/>\n&gt; me sick) is that when older (25+) all we do is heal...no melee, no DD, just<br/>\n&gt; heal and med.  First...is that true or can we still melee..I know we won&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; exactly be able to solo melee...but as in a group or possibly as the only<br/>\n&gt; tank?..and while on that subject, can we solo undead up into all our higher<br/>\n&gt; lvls or do we still need help then too?  And finally the mana issue.  I am<br/>\n&gt; dwarven cleric and have a 100 in strength and 103 in wisdom...will that be a<br/>\n&gt; high enough wisdom to have proper mana to heal my group and such?

Any good cleric websites with detailed spell descriptions (like how<br/>\n&gt; much damage our spells deal, how much HPs our healing spells heal, and the<br/>\n&gt; exact numbers on our buffs, etc)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
