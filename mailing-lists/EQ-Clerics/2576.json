When I first got the spell at 14 I was doing max of 89 and<br/>\nnow at 15 it is up to 90.  I know that the damage is therefore a little<br/>\ndependent on age.   Does wisdom or any other stat have some impact on the<br/>\nmaximum damage that we can do?  I am really tempted to remove my few wisdom<br/>\nenhancing items to see if it drops but then again if it is based on natural<br/>\nwisdom then this would not tell me anything at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell I am off to see if I can make it 16th again.   Some advice to all.  Do<br/>\nnot let an air elemental ambush you as you are running to retrieve your<br/>\nbody.<br/>\n<br/>\nYilari<br/>\nErollisi Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
