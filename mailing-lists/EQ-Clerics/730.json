Heard there was over<br/>\n4,000 ppl in Tallon Zek when it went live, not too long after it went up<br/>\nthey took it down saying they wasn&#39;t gonna put it back up till they had more<br/>\nTeam Servers up and that would be at least a week.<br/>\nFrom what I read while ppl waited for it to get up that there were TONS of<br/>\nppl in the chat room, many cussing and screaming about it.  I&#39;ve also<br/>\nnoticed this when a few or all servers go down, ppl act like that can&#39;t wait<br/>\nfor a few hours to get back on.  Theres some much to real life and tons of<br/>\nthings to do outside but yet ppl would rather sit in the house all day<br/>\nplaying EQ instade of spending time with friends and loved ones but of<br/>\ncourse they just sit there and whin every 5 seconds about &quot;When&#39;s it gonna<br/>\nbe back up?&quot; throw in a few cuss words and whin some more.  I may be flamed<br/>\nfor this letter, but I just can&#39;t see why ppl acted that way.  Yes I play EQ<br/>\nlike crazy, but I try to hang around friends and family as much as I can.<br/>\nGuess like that post on a web site said &quot;I refuse to call EQ a real game,<br/>\nit&#39;s video game crack&quot;.  If ya feel the need to flame me, go a head, but I<br/>\nbet many of you agree with what I&#39;m saying here.  It&#39;s just my 2 cents (or<br/>\n2cp).<br/>\n<br/>\n**************************<br/>\nAzor<br/>\nLvl 18 Human Cleric of the Rathe<br/>\n**************************</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
