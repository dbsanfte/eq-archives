Stats 16 damage, 50<br/>\n&gt;delay, and hits with magical damage. It&#39;s the fruit of a Troll quest (I<br/>\n&gt;don&#39;t know the details), but if you are not a troll, it can be sometimes be<br/>\n&gt;purchased from other players for around 200 pp. It can be used by large<br/>\n&gt;races. I have played with an ogre who used one with great effectiveness.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Now here&#39;s the odd thing: the weapon info on www.gameznet.com/eq states <br/>\n&gt;that<br/>\n&gt;it can be used by &#39;priest&#39; classes, including dwarves. I assume that by<br/>\n&gt;&#39;priest&#39; they mean clerics, as there are no druids among the dwarves. <br/>\n&gt;Unless<br/>\n&gt;they are thinking of paladins?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Can this be true? This is a two-handed axe thingie, 2H slashing. There is <br/>\n&gt;no<br/>\n&gt;other slashing weapon I know of that clerics can use. Plus, how do you <br/>\n&gt;train<br/>\n&gt;in 2H slashing skill? As far as I know, no cleric guildmaster is able to<br/>\n&gt;train that! Don&#39;t you have to put a skill point into it before your skill<br/>\n&gt;will rise?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Does anyone have any information on this weapon? Has anyone used it, as a<br/>\n&gt;cleric?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Not sure I would want to use it, it&#39;s only minimally better than a glowing<br/>\n&gt;wooden crook staff, which can be had for substantially less money, but<br/>\n&gt;still, I&#39;m curious as to whether it is actually usable by clerics.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;== Gilead, 17th level dwarven cleric on Fennin Ro, halfway to his screaming<br/>\n&gt;mace, and looking desperately for a Bracer of Battle.
