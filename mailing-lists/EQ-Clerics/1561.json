It seems that everywhere I&#39;ve been has a lot of greens and<br/>\nyellows, or some blues hanging around with a bunch of yellows/reds.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny advice on where a young cleric can get some experience.  I&#39;m tired of<br/>\nrunning for the zone when those Legionnaires come to the aide of their cent<br/>\ncounterparts.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure you all remember getting 9th, but I don&#39;t know if you felt the<br/>\ndisappointment, that I did, in the spells that we got.  I was all psyched to<br/>\nget root and maybe soothe, but what else is there that works well?  I&#39;m<br/>\nstill using furor as my DD spell.  Seems pretty weak compared to a 9th level<br/>\nDruid&#39;s &quot;ignite&quot; spell that took a cent out in 2 casts.  I can hit em 4 or 5<br/>\ntimes with furor and still have to duke it out for a while.  Any<br/>\nencouragement out there?<br/>\n<br/>\nWixl<br/>\n9th level Cleric<br/>\nBertoxxulous Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
