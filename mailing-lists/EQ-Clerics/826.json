I say far less...<br/>\nShould all of Norrath be available to every player from the get go?  I say<br/>\nno...<br/>\n<br/>\nHill giants and griffins kill low levels too...but we have accepted that as<br/>\npart of the game.  If the damage gate had been there from day one, it would<br/>\nhave been more along the lines of &quot;Cool!  You can&#39;t even gate there and<br/>\nsurvive until you are level xx!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBrad stated the Plane of Fear was supposed to be hard, in the context of<br/>\nhard for very high level characters.<br/>\nMay seem elitist, but I think the high level players will probably<br/>\nappreciate this more than hate it...keeping the lower levels out so they can<br/>\nfocus on themselves and not having to save newbies that just wander in to<br/>\nthe Plane of Fear.  And how does that sound?  &quot;I just wandered in to the<br/>\nPlane of Fear...ho hum.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it also proves to be an achievement of sorts, being able to warp into<br/>\nthe Plane of Fear and survive the shock that would kill the average person.<br/>\nI am all for a Plane that causes damage when you enter it...makes it more<br/>\nominous and harsh!  Is the Plane of Fear supposed to be a cake walk?<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is not a flame, I am just stating a counterpoint.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\tFrom:\tPerhaps a Princess...

Heres what the post on EQVault said<br/>\n\t&gt; &quot;Brad also stated that he was looking into a way to keep the low<br/>\nlevels out<br/>\n\t&gt; of the Plane of Fear. Perhaps something like the gate leading to<br/>\nthe plane<br/>\n\t&gt; doing damage to those who walk through it. Thus killing any low<br/>\nlevel player<br/>\n\t&gt; before he even gets a glimpse of the plane.&quot;<br/>\n\t&gt; Gee thats real fair, &quot;Hhhhmmm, I wonder what this gate is?&quot;  *ZAP<br/>\nkill!!!*<br/>\n\t&gt; I say let them in but make it harder for low lvls, just like a low<br/>\nlvl<br/>\n\t&gt; player wouldn&#39;t want to go to Unrest and if they did it&#39;s their<br/>\nfault when<br/>\n\t&gt; they die.  Maybe put up a gate but around the gate have monster<br/>\nthat would<br/>\n\t&gt; jump low lvl players.  But for the gate to hurt EVERYONE and kill<br/>\nthe low<br/>\n\t&gt; lvls to me is very unfair.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tNot to mention crippling high levels that go in to fight<br/>\nlegitimately,<br/>\n\tby starting them off hurt@<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n\tCongratulations COUNTRYSIDE-ELIST.
