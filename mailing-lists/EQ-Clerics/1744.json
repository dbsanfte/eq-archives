","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-91059916\">Hail my friends.  I am new to the clerical ranks and<br/>\nhad a question about weapons.  I&#39;ve read a few guides<br/>\nthough there seems to be some conflict on weapons. <br/>\nSome guides say one-handed blunt, another say<br/>\ntwo-handed blunt, and lastly, some say both.  I would<br/>\njust like to know what everyone else thinks on the<br/>\nsubject.  Any other tips (as in armor, spells,<br/>\nhunting, etc) for a young dwarven clerics (lvl4) would<br/>\nbe great too.  Thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nNiomar, Dwarven Cleric of Xegony<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.  There be any good cleric websites with like<br/>\nclerial weapons and stragies and very descriptive<br/>\nspell definitions (like eq.castersrealm.com but for<br/>\nclerics? ::duck::).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n=====</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
