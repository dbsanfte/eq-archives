Im glad there<br/>\nis a list up for all of us clerics to get together and haggle about<br/>\nstuff. I would like to respond about the shaman poison spell is better<br/>\nthen clerics undead, im afraid to say but shaman spells are no wear<br/>\nclose. Beleive me i have a shaman. Right now im doing 148 damage a pop<br/>\ncosting me only 90 mana and we all know how fast undead spells recover<br/>\n:) <br/>\n<br/>\nThe only other class which are almost equal with us in damage to mana<br/>\nratio are wizards and thats only at higher levels. Don&#39;t think that the<br/>\ncleric class is just a band aid class, i get right up there in the<br/>\nfights clobbering away. I might only be doing 17 points a hit but when<br/>\nyour fighting a monster a Mob and do about 200 damage in 40 secs or so<br/>\nit adds up. 29th level is the golden level. We get new attack spell<br/>\nWrath which can do up to 198 +2 per level. My undead spells doing a<br/>\nwhopping 150 damage. Get new spell called Guard which increases AC, get<br/>\nRestore spell and New Divine Aura spell which not only lasts longer it<br/>\nwill rapidly restore hp and stamina.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell fellow cleric i must be off to fight for justice and honor.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnursin, High Cleric BTG<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nLooking to expand your world?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nONElist has over 150,000 e-mail communities from which to chose!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
