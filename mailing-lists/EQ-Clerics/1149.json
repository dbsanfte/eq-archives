You are wrong and no need to be so <br/>\n&gt; adamant. We are all<br/>\n&gt; here to learn.  There are plenty of items that do similar things. The<br/>\n&gt; polished tomahawk I mentioned earlier is a 1h slash item that <br/>\n&gt; if wielded by<br/>\n&gt; a level 10 caster often gives berserker effect. Which gives <br/>\n&gt; the user about<br/>\n&gt; 100 hit points of invulnerability. As I explained earlier <br/>\n&gt; this caused me to<br/>\n&gt; loose to a range 2 levels lower than me by a large margin!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
