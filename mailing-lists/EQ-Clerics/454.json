So<br/>\n&gt;Mr. J Daniels account would fit into what I heard about getting someone to<br/>\n&gt;level 20 in 5 hours.  This is all hear-say but I believe it.  Here is how I<br/>\n&gt;heard they did it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;First new character is outfitted in high level equipment and kick a??<br/>\n&gt;weapon.<br/>\n&gt;Then a group of 40+ characters buff the newbie; spells like Resolution,<br/>\n&gt;Symbol of Naltron, Armor of Faith from a cleric.  Talisman of Altune,<br/>\n&gt;Stamina, Guardian, Alacrity, Agility from a shaman.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Next Tanks go in on a level 20+ creature and taunt, clerics cast immobilize<br/>\n&gt;and the newbie starts hitting on it.  If need be the cleric heals.  Once<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;creature is under half health the high level group takes it out and the<br/>\n&gt;newbie gets lots and lots of exp.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Heard of another way that may be even faster. Buff yer newbie, as above.<br/>\nHave the high levels pick on a tough monster. Knock it down to a tiny bit of<br/>\nhealth left.. then zone. Let the newbie take the few remaining hp off it.<br/>\nInstant huge xp for the newbie. I can believe you could bring a newbie to<br/>\nlevle 20 in 5 real-time hours with this technique.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a problem here, though. Lots of your offensive capability and<br/>\ndefensive capability (which translates as higher AC) depends on having<br/>\nactually fought and defended. As a cleric, I am well aware of this: although<br/>\nI think my primary duty during a battle is healing, I try to get as many<br/>\nblows with my mace or staff in as I can, to max out those skills, and always<br/>\nsolo a few beasties per level to bring my Defense skills up to scratch.<br/>\nOtherise, if there is ever a crisis and I *have* to help out on the front<br/>\nline, I would not be effective.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the newbie doesn&#39;t do a fair amount of fighting, and take damage, he will<br/>\nwind up being a level 20 with the AC and offensive skills of a level 2.<br/>\n<br/>\n== Gilead, dwarven cleric of Fennin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
