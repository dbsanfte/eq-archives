Trust me.  Everyone loves me as a cleric.  My<br/>\nfirst char on this game is a ranger, and I got her up to lvl 40....so I know<br/>\nwhat battles are like in tight situation.  I KNOW what it is like when a<br/>\ncleric/healer does not heal...and one that runs around screaming and wont<br/>\nstand still for u to taunt the mob off...or one that runs to zone as soon as<br/>\nhe/she starts to get hit...or one who thinks that nuking is better then<br/>\nhealing.  I know these thing.  I am not one of those clerics.  The best way<br/>\nto know how to play a cleric is to first play the opposite...a tank that can<br/>\nnot heal or heal well...you would know what is expected in a cleric...or<br/>\nwhat you think would make the best cleric.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to my question about cleric soloing...it isnt because I think Im a<br/>\nwizard.  Hell, I know I am not even close in nuking power compare to all<br/>\nother nukers.  The reason why I asked was due to the fact that I just<br/>\nchanged server and I would like to restart a cleric character...but I want<br/>\nto catch up to my friends.  It is as simple as that...just to let you know<br/>\nthat my post was not the best springboard that leads to yours.  Since I was<br/>\nreally referring to a &quot;solo&quot; situation and you are really talking about a<br/>\n&quot;group&quot; situation.  I mean, who cares if the cleric nukes if he/she is<br/>\nsoloing?  No one is going to get hurt except for the cleric.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll protestation aside.  I have group with other clerics before who do<br/>\nexactly what you said you hate about them.  Yes, it is a low lvl thing...and<br/>\nI tend to tell them that they need to sit their butt down, med, and watch<br/>\nthe health bars, and for god sake dont let that health drops below 50%...esp<br/>\nfor casters.  So I think if you want to help the general well being of your<br/>\nserver...you should take the time and just tell these inexperience clerics<br/>\nwhat their main duty is in the group...you never know, they might become<br/>\nyour regular cleric...and won&#39;t you rather have one who you know you can<br/>\ntrust?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-Imogen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Hi all :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve played clerics in the past, and when I was grouped, I knew my job,<br/>\n&gt; and did it very well. I buffed the tanks before battle, watched their<br/>\n&gt; health bars carefully during battle, and (at levels before 25) engaged<br/>\n&gt; in a bit of melee if things were going well. No one had to ask me for a<br/>\n&gt; heal. I mean, come on. When you go to the doctor, should it be necesary<br/>\n&gt; for you to ask him to heal you? Hell, no. That&#39;s his job, for pete&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; sake.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyway, I have recently been playing a barbarian warrior, because I knew<br/>\n&gt; that I wanted to continue to melee, which would be a no-no for my cleric<br/>\n&gt; at higher levels. Now, however, I&#39;m finding it very difficult to find<br/>\n&gt; good clerics to group with. My warrior is level 19 now, and I can<br/>\n&gt; honestly say that I&#39;ve yet to find a cleric who knows what the hell he&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; supposed to do in a group. Is this just a problem with lower level<br/>\n&gt; clerics? I certainly hope so, because if I EVER see a cleric not buffing<br/>\n&gt; or healing in my groups at higher levels, I&#39;ll kick that person out of<br/>\n&gt; my group faster than you can say &quot;Bob&#39;s your uncle!&quot; I won&#39;t even bother<br/>\n&gt; to try explaining to them what they&#39;re supposed to do, because by that<br/>\n&gt; time, they will have already perfected their bad habits. And I have made<br/>\n&gt; it my solemn duty to NOT get myself or my group killed because of<br/>\n&gt; someone else&#39;s arrogant stupidity/ignorance.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That being said, I want to ask a question. Why are there (seemingly) so<br/>\n&gt; many clerics out there who nuke? For pete&#39;s sake! There&#39;s a pefectly<br/>\n&gt; good nuking class--wizard! Why didn&#39;t they choose that class?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I remember when I first got smite, I wanted to show everyone how<br/>\n&gt; powerful I was. But I quickly got over it, because people much preferred<br/>\n&gt; my healing and buffing capabilities over a smite or two during battle.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It just irritates the hell out of me when I have to fight side by side<br/>\n&gt; with a cleric who&#39;s at full health and who won&#39;t get beat on because he<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t melee worth a damn AND he won&#39;t heal me, even when I&#39;m down to my<br/>\n&gt; last bubble of health. GRRR!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyway, thanks for reading my--somewhat--rant on clerics. If you have<br/>\n&gt; any advice for me to give these people, I&#39;d be happy to hear it. Any<br/>\n&gt; time I&#39;ve tried to offer them advice, they&#39;ve either ignored me, or gave<br/>\n&gt; me some lame reason why they do what they do. Sigh.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Maybe I should resurrect my clerics....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Llewellen Iowerth<br/>\n&gt; Karana server<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Just curious...any clerics here solo (or come close to it) to lvl 50?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Is there a good website that tells you how to do the cleric armor quest?<br/>\n&gt; Like the loc of the items.  On a scale of 1-10 (1 being easy and 10<br/>\n&gt; being<br/>\n&gt; hard.)  What do you rank the cleric quest to be? </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
