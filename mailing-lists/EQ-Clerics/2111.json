From what I&#39;ve seen of higher levels, even having near<br/>\n&gt; double the wisdom of others, you get like enough mana to cast<br/>\n&gt; half a greater heal or whatever the non-full heal one is (I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; only lvl 20).

So you want as much WIS as you can the<br/>\nhigher lvl you go...cause each pt of WIS gets converted to more manna the<br/>\nhigher lvl you go...and that means more cast, more heals, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Imogen</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
