But anyways I went to<br/>\nwww.neverwinternights.net and read about it and it sounds like it might be<br/>\nthe RPG of all RPG&#39;s, you can be a GM type guy and control monsters,<br/>\nwildlife and even NPC&#39;s.  The only thing that might suck is only 20 lvls but<br/>\nas they said in AD&D lvl 20 is a force to be reckoned with and reaching such<br/>\na level is quite the achievement.  You can import characters from the BIG<br/>\nhit Baldur&#39;s Gate.<br/>\nAnd yes no monthly fee&#39;s and you can even play NWN in a single game.  Hope<br/>\nthe servers will be good and not all messed up like most free online games.<br/>\nBut anyways this will be a game I try!!<br/>\n<br/>\n**************************<br/>\nAzor<br/>\nLvl 18 Human Cleric of the Rathe<br/>\n**************************<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Curtis Bennett&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:die_kluge@...\">die_kluge@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Come winter of 2000 I will be playing Never Winter Nights.<br/>\n&gt; www.neverwinternight.net (or .com)<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s a DM-able Baldur&#39;s Gate style game that is fully customizable by<br/>\n&gt; the host DM.
