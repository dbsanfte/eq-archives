We need all the servers to<br/>\n&gt; get together on this one! Same spot on all servers. The more servers we<br/>\n&gt; do this on the more verant should take notice!

Our purpose is to show Verant that a great number of Clerics<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and their friends are dissatisfied with the current state of the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Cleric-only armor quests that were meant to replace Rubicite. The<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Cleric-only armor presently has two flaws that we would like to see<br/>\n&gt; &gt; corrected. One, the quests themselves take a ridiculously long amount<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of time to complete (days or weeks for just one piece), and two, the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; armor class (AC) of the Cleric-only armor is not on par with classes<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of its type (The new Cleric-only armor∩┐╜s AC is actually *lower* than<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the original Rubicite). To receive more information about these<br/>\n&gt; &gt; concerns and to find out how you can show your support, please visit<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://freepages.ugo.com/clericsrequest.\">http://freepages.ugo.com/clericsrequest.</a> And to those of you who<br/>\n&gt; &gt; already plan on participating in this event please check the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; information page, as several updates have been made. I look forward to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; seeing everyone there, and in all hopes we can get Verant to listen to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; our suggestions. Thank you all for your support.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sincerely,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Norin Grimsbane of The Tribunal<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
