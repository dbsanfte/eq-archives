As you get up towards levels 18, 19, 20... another great place to go get in a group is the Aviak city in South Karana.   Talk about crowded... it makes Oasis look empty, but it is really good xp... I got about 5 or 6 levels in a row there.. by the time i got to level 22 or 23 I was so sick of the crowds I couldn&#39;t stay any longer.<br/>\nIf you can get in a good group though, the xp can be very good in both places.  <br/>\n<br/>\n-Eachann Bronzeleaf<br/>\n-Cleric of Tunare, Tarrew Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:FalornEQ@...\">FalornEQ@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, November 09, 1999 3:53 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] Places to for a low level cleric to hunt (used to be unrest)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:FalornEQ@...\">FalornEQ@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I was wondering where would a level 14 cleric have a good time fighting, <br/>\n&gt; other than in Nro where i am now?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
