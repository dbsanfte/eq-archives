Verant needs to fix the coding on this, to make <br/>\n&gt; sure that the group gets the kill...or...whoever attacks the MOB first gets <br/>\n&gt; the kill. Its very very disheartening to camp something for hours and hours <br/>\n&gt; with your group, just to have a wizard or other high level spell casting <br/>\n&gt; class come along and take it with one shot.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Lana<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ----Original Message Follows----<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Patrick Myers&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chrisstauf@...\">chrisstauf@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [EQ-Clerics] Kill Stealing<br/>\n&gt; Date: Tue, 03 Aug 1999 10:25:23 MST<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Patrick Myers&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chrisstauf@...\">chrisstauf@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please forgive, for I am new to this list, but here is my problem and<br/>\n&gt; suggestion for Verant:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My number one problem with the game is kill stealing. This frustrates me to<br/>\n&gt; no end.  I can&#39;t begin to tell you how long I have been trying for a Shiny<br/>\n&gt; Brass Shield in Crushbone and how many kills have been stolen from me from<br/>\n&gt; some mage hiding in a tree.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think the problem is how Verant determines who gets the kill. As I<br/>\n&gt; understand it, the single person that inflicts the most damage is awarded<br/>\n&gt; the kill.  This means that it does not matter if you are grouped and your<br/>\n&gt; group does more damage than the spell caster.  Does this seem crazy to<br/>\n&gt; anyone else.  It should work that the groups damage counts as one. I believe<br/>\n&gt; that this would cut down on the amount of kills that are stolen.  It seems<br/>\n&gt; like an easy fix and it makes logical sense.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What is everyone else&#39;s opinion, and has anybody heard of Verant commenting<br/>\n&gt; on this issue?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Chrisstauf..of the Lightbringers guild<br/>\n&gt; Cleric of the 14th circle<br/>\n&gt; Karana server<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  your connection to online communities.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ONElist members are using Shared Files in great ways!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Are you?
