The<br/>\n&gt; highest I&#39;ve ever gotten a cleric to is lvl 28.  Last night was the first<br/>\n&gt; time I ever played a lvl 50 cleric and I have to admit it was like being<br/>\n&gt; toss into the water without knowing how to swim.  We were doing a dragon run<br/>\n&gt; of all things.  Anyway, the healing part I think I gotten down...I mainly<br/>\n&gt; just cast superior heals...the time needed to cast a CH was just too nerve<br/>\n&gt; racking for me.  I was told to cast panzia (sp?) symbol on caster and nalton<br/>\n&gt; (sp?) on tanks (why that is so...I didn&#39;t bothered to ask...was a bit too<br/>\n&gt; busy trying to figured out other stuff).  If there is a druid around then do<br/>\n&gt; most clerics not cast Reso and AoF?  Most tanks were asking for SLN...were<br/>\n&gt; they trying to split buff duty between druid/shaman/clerics?  Anyway, can<br/>\n&gt; any lvl 49+ clerics out there give out advise on what you normally do in<br/>\n&gt; highly stressful combat situation with multi groups going on.  Thanks a<br/>\n&gt; bunch.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I died like 5 times last nite...hope that wasn&#39;t too unusual.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     GRAB THE GATOR!
