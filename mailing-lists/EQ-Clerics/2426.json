The merchant in solA that sells<br/>\ntinkerers bags for 5kilo plat needs to do a couple things.<br/>\n1. reduce the cost of the bag 3kilo plat seems more reasonable. (see<br/>\nbelow why you would want to reduce the cost)<br/>\n2. start selling Rubicite, make it fairly expensive I guess around<br/>\n150-200pp per ac would be fair.<br/>\n<br/>\nVerdant armour should be for sale in erudin (at the moment the merchant<br/>\nwill only sell to GM&#39;s as I understand it).<br/>\nBlack iron for sale in kaladim.<br/>\nAdd some more store bought armour types.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdd some more smithed & taylored armours (ie. add a vial of some sought<br/>\nof mana from an enchanter, and some component and get some magic/bonus)<br/>\neg. imagine a ruby encrusted silvered/cromed/guilded/shiny breastplate<br/>\nAC17 +?str/wis   (sure it would probably cost alot in components and<br/>\nwould very hard to smith, ie failures so even more expensive) ie. U<br/>\nmight combine a ruby, the vial, 2 sheets of steel, a mold, a flask of<br/>\nwater, a bar of enchanted silver/gold/electrum/platnium and a file.<br/>\nMaybe introduce a spell &quot;Bless water&quot; make it so you need to get a flask<br/>\nof &quot;holy water&quot; (that way no single class can singly corner the market<br/>\neg. enchanters).<br/>\nOr maybe make it a 2 step process make first step might be to make gem<br/>\nencrusted sheets<br/>\n<br/>\nNow as far as magic weapons go.<br/>\nAdd some pirate merchants in OOT, or the dwarven merchant in OOT or DE<br/>\nin Neriak or a few all over the place. Lets add some more store bought<br/>\nMagic weapons at the mo there is Combine and well balanced. Now if there<br/>\nwas more variety in store bought magic weapons, people wouldn&#39;t feel the<br/>\nneed to camp for a magic item. Item drops might become more the by<br/>\nproduct of going into a dungeon, not the reason for going there.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso the price of steel plate needs to be reduced.<br/>\nBasically if something is too expensive people will not buy it, think<br/>\nabout it if a twinker can spend a few hours and get a really decent<br/>\nitem, or spend a few hours to get enuf cash to buy an inferior item<br/>\nwhich will they do. Chain is also too expensive. (imo chain should be<br/>\ntwice to 3 times the price of leather, and plate 2 to 4 times the price<br/>\nof chain).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nouch, I ranted ... sorry<br/>\n<br/>\nChris Drew wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Chris Drew &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:xcdrewx@...\">xcdrewx@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; WARNING KINDA OFF TOPIC:<br/>\n&gt; ************************<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I play a fantasy/medievel LARP &lt;NERO&gt; and this seems<br/>\n&gt; to be the way with all the magic items in our game.<br/>\n&gt; At lower levels, dagger, potions, etc.. are worth alot<br/>\n&gt; to you, coin is very valuable.  As you progress you<br/>\n&gt; are going on small quests and getting abundunce of<br/>\n&gt; coin to gain levels, and few items.  As you progress<br/>\n&gt; to higher level the magic items are whats the most<br/>\n&gt; wanted.  Your sword can only be so good unless its<br/>\n&gt; magical, the shield and armor is the same unless its<br/>\n&gt; magical.  Everyone wants magic items, and cause you<br/>\n&gt; have been adventuring so long, and are killing larger<br/>\n&gt; creatures now you have an abundance of coin.<br/>\n&gt; Items can only be traded for itmes, cause coin is a<br/>\n&gt; common thing.  The way this can only be solved is that<br/>\n&gt; the coin is used for something, to gain levels, its<br/>\n&gt; turned in for exp.  In EQ the coin is worthless in<br/>\n&gt; only regards to buying items.  Maybe if it was used to<br/>\n&gt; buy entertainment, or to buy house, estates, etc..<br/>\n&gt; than it would be needed.  They must make coin valuable<br/>\n&gt; at all stages in level progression.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Later<br/>\n&gt; Chris<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Dharkness<br/>\n&gt; Cleric of Innouurk<br/>\n&gt; Vallon Zek<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- Jeff Portwine &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jdport@...\">jdport@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I didn&#39;t really camp until the last 5 levels or so<br/>\n&gt; &gt; when I started wanting some of the items that I was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; finally getting high enough level to get.   After a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; while you find that the higher level you get the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; less value platinum has and everything that you want<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to have is either A) No-Drop, B) costs just an<br/>\n&gt; &gt; outrageous amount of platinum (because plat is so<br/>\n&gt; &gt; easy to come by at high levels) or C) the person who<br/>\n&gt; &gt; has the item wants to trade it instead of selling it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (again because plat isn&#39;t worth that much compared<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to the time spent getting items).   In the case of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; C, you need to camp to get the items that the person<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is willing to trade the item you want for... so you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; either camp for that or you camp for the item you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; actually want.. either way you are going to camp.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; In the case of A, you have no choice because it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; No-Drop so nobody else can get it for you, and in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the case of B.. well you will be saving your pennies<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a long long time.    So, I think that you will find<br/>\n&gt; &gt; yourself camping in levels to come and you will<br/>\n&gt; &gt; realize pretty quickly why people are complaining<br/>\n&gt; &gt; about it =)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -Eachann Bronzeleaf<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -Cleric of Tunare, Tarew Marr<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Chris Wheeler &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wheelech@...\">wheelech@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Tuesday, November 30, 1999 1:21 PM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: RE: [EQ-Clerics] Cleric Sit-in<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: Chris Wheeler &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wheelech@...\">wheelech@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I hope you are all successful.

So if<br/>\n&gt; &gt; your protest helps in that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; regard, I am sure it will benfit me as well.
