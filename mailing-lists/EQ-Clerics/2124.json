You CAN go there at level 13 with a group and kill yard trash for pretty good xp, but the trains there are really nasty.  I didn&#39;t really do all that well in unrest until around level 24 when I got greater healing and dismiss undead.  At that point, I was able to camp a room inside the house with relative ease.  It&#39;s a great zone for loot as well as xp because most all of the monsters above the yard trash carry fine steel weapons, and a few have small bronze armor pieces.   This zone is especially good for us clerics since about 90% of the monsters there are undead.<br/>\n<br/>\nEachann Bronzeleaf,<br/>\nCleric of Tunare, Tarrew Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:FalornEQ@...\">FalornEQ@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, November 09, 1999 3:38 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] Unrest is so unrestful!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:FalornEQ@...\">FalornEQ@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Where in the hell is Unrest :-)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Falorrn<br/>\n&gt; Ignorant level 13 cleric<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
