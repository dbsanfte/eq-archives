One is the Jojongua pelt quest in Felwithe.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Technically, I guess, this is a Paladin quest, but the Paladin that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; initiates it, asks if you will help the &quot;clerics of tunare&quot; so it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; kind of overlaps.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;From what I have heard, Jojongua, the named Kobold in Innothule Swamp,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is a rare spawn, and those that have killed him, have never ever<br/>\n&gt; &gt; looted a pelt off his cold, dead body.  Also from what I have heard,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the corpse remains, even though there is no loot, and doesn&#39;t go away<br/>\n&gt; &gt; after looting.  Anyone have any information on this quest?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Ergo Soulhealer<br/>\n&gt; &gt; test server </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
