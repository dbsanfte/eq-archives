Usually<br/>\n&gt; all it does is teleport to corpse and return a little xp. But at that time it did a whole<br/>\n&gt; lot more. And all of them were negative side effects. After resurrection i had all my<br/>\n&gt; mana drained, had only 50% of HP, had some kind of weakness effect on me and<br/>\n&gt; all this without any addition to the positive effects (xp gain). I feel this is a terribly<br/>\n&gt; wrong move by Verant. And besides they did not mention a thing about it in the<br/>\n&gt; patch message. Why the heck did they do something like this? Do they want to<br/>\n&gt; ruin the cleric now that it is perfectly balanced? That would be awfully stupid.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Iyenya Goldenheart<br/>\n&gt; Lvl 30 dwarf cleric<br/>\n&gt; Innoruuk server<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You can WIN $100 to Amazon.com by starting a new list at ONElist.<br/>\n&gt; Drawing is held each week through August 20.
