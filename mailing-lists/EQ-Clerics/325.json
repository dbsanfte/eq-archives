Avoid it at all costs! Seriously, RunnyEye can be fun, but<br/>\n&gt;I have died WAY too many times from Borxx (Evil Eye) so I avoid that place<br/>\n&gt;like the plague.

Once i had only 1 HP<br/>\nleft after zoning from Runnyeye... that inspired me to write a story to EQVault<br/>\ntitled &#39;Borxx got me... NOT!&#39; and had some great responses to that story. I<br/>\nwill certainly go back to Runnyeye just to finally see her slayed down when<br/>\nI am done with Mistmoore... though it will probably take a few levels before<br/>\nI will leave Faydwer again. I myself didn&#39;t die too many times there, and at <br/>\nthat time i didn&#39;t really care about it. I got past level 20 in there and i think i<br/>\nleveled 4 or 5 times fighting in there. At 22 i went back to Faydwer.<br/>\n<br/>\nIyenya Goldenheart<br/>\nLvl 24 dwarf cleric<br/>\nInnoruuk server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
