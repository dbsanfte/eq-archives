I suggest searching for new areas.  I\r<br/>\nhave found a zone that has never had more than 25\r<br/>\npeople in it since I have been there.  Exp. is\r<br/>\ngreat and I am making about 60pp a day in loot.\r<br/>\nDid I mention that I now have full bronze from\r<br/>\nthis same zone?  I am not a level 49 player\r<br/>\neither.  I made 18 last night and I already have\r<br/>\ntwo bubbles of exp. toward 19.  I have all the lvl\r<br/>\n19 spells bought, an incredible amount of jewelry,\r<br/>\nand over 500pp in the bank.  Once again I implore\r<br/>\nyou to travel and to form 6 member groups.  If you\r<br/>\nhear about a great place then every one else has\r<br/>\nalso.  Find your own area.  There are many that\r<br/>\nare hardly ever visited and you&#39;ll have your\r<br/>\ncloice on what, when, and where to kill.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nBlessed\r<br/>\nLevel 18 Cleric\r<br/>\nRodcet Nife</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
