Regarding 1HB vs. 2HB - At your level I would stay with the 1HB skill if you have not trained at all in 2HB.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-855033455\">GUARD = upgrade to spirit armor line of spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding 1HB vs. 2HB - At your level I would stay with the 1HB skill if you<br/>\nhave not trained at all in 2HB.  Reasoning will be that your melee is going<br/>\nto significantly decrease as your levels progress.  Also, work on trying to<br/>\nget a charred guardian shield as soon as you can (+9 wis).  Also there are<br/>\nsome +wis 1HB weapons that you will be able to obtain once you get a little<br/>\nhigher in levels.  (Tainted Battleworm morningstar = +6 wis)  If you MUST<br/>\nuse a 2HB make sure to keep your 1HB skill up if possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding Taunts - Taunt skill takes time to build up to be effective.  The<br/>\nbest anti-taunt a cleric has when getting the crap beat out of him/her is<br/>\nDivine Aura.  Just cast DA and usually the mob will head back to the tank.<br/>\n=)  If not.. this is a good time to start running!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Sirensa<br/>\nPriestess of Innoruuk<br/>\nSolusek Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
