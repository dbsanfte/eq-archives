It uses small amount<br/>\n&gt; of manna and is relatively quick to cast. Generally I cast it and if not<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I sometimes use flash of light,  one problem I have found however, is that<br/>\nthey can still cast on you if they are blinded.  I did not think this was<br/>\nthe case, but the one duel I lost was because a shaman friend of mine<br/>\nnuked me hard while he was blind.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; rooted I ran round the back of them and start hitting them. From the back no<br/>\n&gt; melee weapon effects you.  I always use a 1 handed weapon (fast=28) on the<br/>\n&gt; principal that I have more chance to interrupt other players casts. I seldom<br/>\n&gt; use stun though after that post I will reevaluate it. ( I just hate to waste<br/>\n&gt; manna for no damage!) On the stun part. An experienced PvP Caster need not<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hrm,  my current stun does damage, around 74 I believe.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; look for you all he has to do is cast, unless of course he is being pounding<br/>\n&gt; from behind which puts them off.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again,   maybe I should of clarified,   I didnt give my exact step by step<br/>\nmethods, but when I stun and move behind the caster, i&#39;m right next to<br/>\nthem whacking away with my black mace.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I would also suggest not to be hesitant to use divine aura quickly.<br/>\n&gt; Especially if rooted. One hope is that you can be aided by other players.<br/>\n&gt; Otherwise the general wiz technique is root and nuke. If they don&#39;t notice<br/>\n&gt; (or do not understand) they may waste a lot of manna.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree..<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; However I have in general lost to casters, mainly because the Pk&#39;s on Rallos<br/>\n&gt; tend to wait till your health is at the last bubble while fighting a MOB<br/>\n&gt; then kill you with one/two unexpected blasts. Which Sucks.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>From people I have talked to, clerics are great in duels, I know a level<br/>\n50 wizard who&#39;s only duel loses have been to clerics.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
