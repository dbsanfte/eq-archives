I<br/>\n&gt; then kept casting light healing/healing on newbies<br/>\n&gt; near my town till my alteration hit 51!  That was it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   I realize that abjuration is probably the most used<br/>\n&gt; due to all the buffing, but alteration is the most<br/>\n&gt; critical to a cleric!  I would rather run out of mana<br/>\n&gt; while buffing than while healing.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Then again, i guess it all depends on how you want to<br/>\n&gt; do it, this is just my personal opinion<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Adira SoulSaver  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- Jeff Portwine &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jdport@...\">jdport@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;HR&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0<br/>\n&gt; Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;META content=&quot;text/html; charset=iso-8859-1&quot;<br/>\n&gt; http-equiv=Content-Type&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;META content=&quot;MSHTML 5.00.2014.210&quot; name=GENERATOR&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;STYLE&gt;&lt;/STYLE&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;/HEAD&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;BODY bgColor=#ffffff&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;A question for all you<br/>\n&gt; level 50 clerics, or at <br/>\n&gt; least clerics above level 30...&nbsp; what is the best<br/>\n&gt; school of magic to <br/>\n&gt; specialize in?&nbsp;&nbsp; My initial thought is that<br/>\n&gt; I would want to specialize <br/>\n&gt; in alteration since that is the school that the<br/>\n&gt; healing spells are in and I <br/>\n&gt; think I use the healing spells more than any<br/>\n&gt; other...&nbsp; Somebody else <br/>\n&gt; suggested that I put one practice point into each<br/>\n&gt; school and just go with <br/>\n&gt; whichever one increases over 50 first... the theory<br/>\n&gt; being that whichever one <br/>\n&gt; goes over 50 first is probably the one I use the<br/>\n&gt; most.&nbsp;&nbsp; Does anybody <br/>\n&gt; else have any ideas reguarding which school is best to<br/>\n&gt; specialize <br/>\n&gt; in?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;I am level 29, about half<br/>\n&gt; way to 30... so I will <br/>\n&gt; soon be facing this choice.&nbsp; Thanks!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;-Eachann<br/>\n&gt; Bronzeleaf&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;-Cleric of Tunare, Tarew <br/>\n&gt; Marr&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;HR&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;html&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; =====<br/>\n&gt; Get paid for reading E-Mail!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sendmoreinfo.com/id/63758\">http://www.sendmoreinfo.com/id/63758</a><br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
