(i&#39;m a big looks are important person =)) and the bronze <br/>\nis just to heavy for my DE cleric.... i know rubi is an option and even <br/>\nthough i could camp it.. i really don&#39;t want to spend that much time to get a <br/>\ngood set... i also have about 1900pp in the bank so i could buy some of the <br/>\nplatemail from merchants.. but with all that i could only get like 4 of the <br/>\nlesser pieces.... I have heard about silver plated pieces (mainly leggings... <br/>\nare there any others?) and mithril... does anyone know of any others? or have <br/>\ninfo on what might be a good way to obtain some sort of armor to replace my <br/>\nbronze? either more pp for platemail or maybe a spoiler on mithril, like <br/>\nwhere and what level... any help is greatly appreciated =)<br/>\n<br/>\nThralkin<br/>\nVeeshan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
