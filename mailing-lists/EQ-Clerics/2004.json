I think the only cleric spell<br/>\n&gt;      that takes longer to cast is shield of words.  The only time I found<br/>\n&gt;      this spell usefull was when I was grouped with a L50 warrior since he<br/>\n&gt;      had so many hp superior heal was only healing one bub of his health.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;      Last night I was in LGuk and our group was camping the froglik King.<br/>\n&gt;      Now this guy hits hard and fast (140 double attacks) and I was casting<br/>\n&gt;      superior heals one after another just to keep our tank (L50 sk) alive.<br/>\n&gt;       There is no way I could have gotten off a complete heal during these<br/>\n&gt;      fights.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;      It also doesn&#39;t make much sence to me that it takes longer to<br/>\n&gt;      completely heal someone than it does to ressurect them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;      I think all of our healing spells need reduced casting times,  It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;      very frustrating when your tank looses their last 2 bubs of health<br/>\n&gt;      when your trying to get a heal off just to see thoes blue sparkles<br/>\n&gt;      around their corpse.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;      Just something to think about.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;      Drogo DarkBane<br/>\n&gt;      The Rathe<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
