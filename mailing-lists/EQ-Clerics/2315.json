His replacement spawn is<br/>\n&gt;from one to 5 gators.  The necessary lvl escapes me but I&#39;d say its 34<br/>\n&gt;solo (although a pure caster can probably do them at 30) to be safe.<br/>\n&gt;The gators won&#39;t agro so you can kill one at a time.  You have to clear<br/>\n&gt;them all out before the next spawn cycle will start.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;They weight only .4 so they do drop your overall weight significantly.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Mal<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&lt;&lt; text3.html &gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
