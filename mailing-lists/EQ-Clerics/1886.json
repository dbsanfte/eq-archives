From what EVERYONE<br/>\n&gt; tells me (which I totally disagree with and the whole subject matter makes<br/>\n&gt; me sick) is that when older (25+) all we do is heal...no melee, no DD, just<br/>\n&gt; heal and med.  First...is that true or can we still melee..I know we won&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; exactly be able to solo melee...but as in a group or possibly as the only<br/>\n&gt; tank?..and while on that subject, can we solo undead up into all our higher<br/>\n&gt; lvls or do we still need help then too?  And finally the mana issue.  I am<br/>\n&gt; dwarven cleric and have a 100 in strength and 103 in wisdom...will that be a<br/>\n&gt; high enough wisdom to have proper mana to heal my group and such?

Any good cleric websites with detailed spell descriptions (like how<br/>\n&gt; much damage our spells deal, how much HPs our healing spells heal, and the<br/>\n&gt; exact numbers on our buffs, etc)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
