Don&#39;t respond with the original message attached.<br/>\n<br/>\nPro:  Saves bandwidth.  People don&#39;t have to download 10K worth of message<br/>\nto see 2K worth of response.<br/>\n<br/>\nCon:  Someone coming in the middle of the thread won&#39;t know what you are<br/>\ntalking about.  As you can see, I am a member of this believe.  I think that<br/>\nif you use good judgement then you won&#39;t have to worry about it.  Just don&#39;t<br/>\nquote a 2 page e-mail just to make a 2 sentence response.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  Don&#39;t use anything but plain text.<br/>\n<br/>\nPro:  A lot of people on these lists use *nix or some other form of test<br/>\nonly mail readers.  Things like html and RTF only detract from the message<br/>\nand sometimes make in unreadable.  I support this believe.  I would rather<br/>\nhave everyone be able to read my message than to have it look good to the<br/>\n30% who can support html.<br/>\n<br/>\nCon:  It makes the post look better (sometimes).  I don&#39;t think this is a<br/>\nconcern.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe those are the two issues that concerned you.  This is my<br/>\nunderstanding so it may not be totally right.  One other thing, you may want<br/>\nto make a more descriptive title to your thread.  Something like &#39;List<br/>\nEtiquette&#39; would be appropriate.  I would change it now but it will screw<br/>\nwith people who are deleting this thread with a filter.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nDavid Burger<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:david.burger@...\">david.burger@...</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.deadbbs.com/~burger/\">http://www.deadbbs.com/~burger/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nReality is whatever refuses to go away when I stop believing in it.<br/>\n   - Philip K.

Since then<br/>\ni have done as asked, but alot of ppl are replying to messages without<br/>\ndeleting the threads, while i understand the reason, NOW, for deleting the<br/>\nthread,i do not understand why others don&#39;t delete as well?  i am a little<br/>\nmiffed about this as it was not asked nicely of me, well maybe i took it<br/>\nwrong, but just the same, if i have to delete the threads then why does<br/>\neveryone else not have to.  Also i was adding color to the message as i<br/>\nthought it looked better and was told not to do that as well!!  oh well i<br/>\nwas just wondering why i was told to do so and since then i have seen many<br/>\nlong messages by others.  err ppl i am not slamming anyone i am just asking<br/>\na general question -- thanx for yer time -- anne *hugs*<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nONElist now brings ICQ Instant Messaging to members<br/>\nFor details,<br/>\n&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/info/news.html\">http://www.onelist.com/info/news.html</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
