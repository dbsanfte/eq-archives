Have to of course be in a good group<br/>\nfor both, as those places can get out of hand easily.<br/>\n   In Lower Guk, you can hunt in the bedroom, undead side.  In Sol B I would<br/>\nreccomend hunting right near one of the zones to Sol A, there are 3 I<br/>\nbelieve.  Don&#39;t fight at the main zone to Lavastorm that is train central<br/>\nand you will get some pretty nasty stuff there.  Both of these dungeons are<br/>\nreally crowded most of the time, when I was 35 it wasn&#39;t to bad, so I don&#39;t<br/>\nknow how bad fighting for spawns would be now.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can also see about getting into a Avatar room group in Cazic.  Perhaps<br/>\nDeepwater Goblins and Spectres in Oasis and Spectres in Feerott.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are the places I remember being in that level area i hope this helps<br/>\n<br/>\nBut hell levels are going to take awhile to get through especially if you<br/>\ndon&#39;t have a lot of time to play often.   The fastest I have seen anyone get<br/>\nthrough 35 was 3 days and that was with playing constantly ( he wasn&#39;t<br/>\nworking at te time and was home all day). Then on the other hand it took our<br/>\ngroup Paladin I think a month of playing each night and a lot of the<br/>\nweekends to get through 35.<br/>\n<br/>\nBree<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: David Bradshaw &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Logain@...\">Logain@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, December 07, 1999 2:17 AM<br/>\nSubject: [EQ-Clerics] Places to get the heck out of 35?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;David Bradshaw&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Logain@...\">Logain@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have been stuck on level 35 for years now... (ok a slight exageration..)<br/>\n&gt; Someone told me that the specs in Feerrot was a good spot to get out of<br/>\nthis<br/>\n&gt; level... I just spent 4 hours in Kith with a group and only got 25% of a<br/>\n&gt; bbl. We where fighting many different things including reds...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; A few ppl in my group told me they ended up having to solo to get out of<br/>\n&gt; this level with any type of speed...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Any insight would be appreciated.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thump Ghoulsbane<br/>\n&gt; 35th Cleric of the Underfoot<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
