Our guild<br/>\nis doing another dragon run again tonight or planes =( (at least that&#39;s the<br/>\nrumor) I am more nervous then I can say.  Thanks for all the advise...I&#39;ve<br/>\nprinted out all of y&#39;all&#39;s replies so I can read it while I play...EGAD<br/>\nthat&#39;s a confidence builder there isn&#39;t it?!  Good thing the tanks in my<br/>\ngroup won&#39;t know ;P<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll try not to die as much tonight...dont want my friend to come back to<br/>\nfind she now has a lvl 48 character or something =P<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night, after dying so much, I started to make sure I kept a really<br/>\nreally really good distance from the battle.  Hope that&#39;s the way to do<br/>\nit...I was so good at keeping the distance that I couldn&#39;t cast at the tanks<br/>\ncause they were &quot;out of range&quot; =/ So I wasted a few precious second trying<br/>\nto get closer to the battle to heal while the health bar was going down<br/>\nsteadily...was too stressful.  Then I got close enough, maybe too close, to<br/>\nheal and die...again...*sigh*  On the bright side...I was the only one in my<br/>\ngroup that die majority of the time...all the tanks were kept alive pretty<br/>\nwell most of the time...can&#39;t say the same for the enchanter and the shammie<br/>\nin my group though =/  They went down too fast for me to heal.  I&#39;m pretty<br/>\nsure I&#39;ll get the exact science of this sooner or later =/<br/>\n<br/>\nI have no idea being a cleric can be this stressful.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
