No waiting for<br/>\nthem to run back.  You should bind yourself close to where you are hunting<br/>\nso you can get back fast and revive the others.  It&#39;s an incredibly useful<br/>\nspell to your party members.  Especially if you are travelling across the<br/>\ncontinent and you have members who are bound only in cities, if one of them<br/>\ndies, you can get them back quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\nMik</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
