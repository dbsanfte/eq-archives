Altho one might rightfully think that our armor quests should be no<br/>\nharder or easier than other classes. My gripe is the lack of experience<br/>\nconnected to the quests. And not just the fact that we don&#39;t get exp for<br/>\ncompleting a quest like most other classes do, but also the fact that for<br/>\nmany (most?) people tryin to do the quest, there&#39;s no exp to be had while<br/>\nyou&#39;re sitting around waiting. For many (again, most?) of us, most of the<br/>\nquest stuff is in the middle of a mass of green mobs.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I see it, there are really only two explanations for the difiiculty of<br/>\nour quests compared to other classes... the lack of exp connected to our<br/>\nquests compared to other classes... and Verant&#39;s lack of action to make<br/>\nadjustments (or to be more accurate, Verant&#39;s deceptiveness about what they<br/>\nwould be doing and when. I interpretted some of their statements weeks ago<br/>\nto mean that this patch would have adjustments. And I know others did as<br/>\nwell).<br/>\n<br/>\n1. They are inept. (heh, seems that way sometimes, but more likely it&#39;s....)<br/>\n<br/>\n2. They are doing it intentially to some end. If you buy into this<br/>\nexplanation, then there can be only one reason they would intentionally nerf<br/>\n(for lack of a better EQ word) our quests. They have some reason for wanting<br/>\nto slow down mid to high lev clerics. Why? Dunno... maybe they want to keep<br/>\ndown the availability of lev 49 res casters? And what better way to keep<br/>\nsomeone from getting to 49 as fast as they might than by sending them off on<br/>\nsome less than useful armor quest that could well keep them from leveling<br/>\nfor weeks? Dunno... maybe they think we&#39;re overpowered or too well balanced<br/>\nand see this as a less than obvious way to nerf us a bit? Whatever their<br/>\nreasoning, I&#39;m convinced it&#39;s being done for a reason. And I don&#39;t really<br/>\nexpect to see any changes of any significance, so I&#39;m content to spend my<br/>\ntime leveling so I can get some plane armor before they nerf that even more.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPantheus<br/>\nEM</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
