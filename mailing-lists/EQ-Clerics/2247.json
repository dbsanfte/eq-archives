Personally I won&#39;t throw myself in <br/>\nfront of a running giant to save someone else (literally). If I were a <br/>\npaladin or good cleric maybe I could do that but only from a roleplaying <br/>\npoint of view. A cleric of Innoruuk should probably conclude that whoever <br/>\ndies was not fit to serve Innoruuk anyway. And it can be tactically <br/>\nmotivated to stay alive so that you can ressurrect the others.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunetaly there are instances when we have to choose between saving the <br/>\ntank and ourselves. One example is when the tank is being beaten down by a <br/>\ntrain. As you all know healing that tank will result in an instant <br/>\ntrain-takeover that results in our death. On one single occation this has <br/>\nhappened to me, and I chose not to heal the tank since I knew I would die. <br/>\nWe evaced instead and everyone made it out. I&#39;m interested in other views <br/>\non this matter.<br/>\n<br/>\n// JS</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
