In case you never heard of<br/>\nit, it Brads new way of getting rid of high lvl characters camping lower lvl<br/>\nspawn points.<br/>\nThis is what he said but it<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;If a higher level player who would get no exp for the kill is camping a<br/>\nspawn, and a group of players that would get exp (meaning they should be<br/>\nthere) wants to fight there, the higher level player must yield. The lower<br/>\nlevel group has the right of way.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the other disciplinary information in that post, it sounds like the<br/>\nsame policy that&#39;s always been in place: if you are warned several times and<br/>\ncontinue to break the rules, you will be banned.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you all think this will work or just tick off a lot of players?  I&#39;m not<br/>\nsure if I&#39;m for it or not, but also remember if your a camper doing this and<br/>\nyou&#39;re warned a few times you&#39;ll be banned from the game.  I don&#39;t really<br/>\ncamp, I do in a few spots but not a lot but only in places that give me exp.<br/>\nHe said it wouldn&#39;t be actively enforced till it was officially announced.<br/>\nSome ppl are wanting us to be able to vote yes or no on it but as of now<br/>\nBrad isn&#39;t letting us vote<br/>\n<br/>\n**************************<br/>\nAzor<br/>\nLvl 18 Human Cleric of the Rathe<br/>\n**************************</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
