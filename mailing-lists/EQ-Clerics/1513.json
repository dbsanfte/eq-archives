I am 17th (almost 18th) and am having <br/>\nserious trouble there.  Last night 6 people from my guild were there, all <br/>\n15-20 and we had a rough time.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were at the back wall pulling from the back door.  We had SoW and invis <br/>\nto undead on the puller at all times, but there were many times where she <br/>\nended up bringing quite a few too many ghouls.  (tried to pull 1 and <br/>\nsuddenly there were 7 of them on us!)<br/>\n<br/>\nAre we hunting at too high a level, or are we pulling from the wrong place?  <br/>\nOr do we just suck?  We only had 2 deaths last night, but many many many <br/>\nclose calls.  Lets just say thank god our druid was also saving 50% mana for <br/>\nheals.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeddik<br/>\nJaegergruppe<br/>\nBristlebane</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
