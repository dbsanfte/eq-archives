Although I&#39;d like to obtain Mist Armor<br/>\n&gt; myself, it&#39;s just not feasible at this time.  However, you can be as vain<br/>\n&gt; (I&#39;m very aware of how my character appears), as any other class.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;You wanna be a good cleric?

However, outside of battle you can still wear your travelling<br/>\n&gt; clothes.
