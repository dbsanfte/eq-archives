And I did<br/>\nabsolutely NO research into what stats were good for starting as a cleric.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I was totally nekkid (lost my newbie armor when I lost my corpse -<br/>\nhehehe) until about level 5 when I got some patchwork.  At about level 7 I<br/>\nreceived a Runed Totem Staff from a necro friend that was about 5 levels<br/>\nhigher (and he was soooo OLD then!)  I was the envy of all the other newbie<br/>\nDE clerics.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was still wearing patchwork into my late teens - at which time I was able<br/>\nto acquire some ringmail and bronze.  By early 20&#39;s I was all Bronze armor<br/>\nwith +2 wis rings!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt wasn&#39;t until about level 25 that I started to get some +wis increasing<br/>\ndecent items =)  Including an Observer Staff!!<br/>\n<br/>\nSooo... the moral of this story is - It is NOT about what you wear, it&#39;s<br/>\nabout how well you play your class.  (well maybe a little bit about how you<br/>\nlook - the purple stuff sure is nice!) hehehe.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Sirensa<br/>\nPriestess of Innoruuk<br/>\nSolusek Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
