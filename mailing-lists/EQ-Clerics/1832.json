I&#39;d like to give props out to you all, and everyone on the<br/>\neq-cleric forum at stratic. (if any of you do both of these)<br/>\nSo far that forum and this list is easily, from what i&#39;ve seen, most of<br/>\nthe maturist ppl in this game..mind you, there are always exceptions.<br/>\nWell anyways, I&#39;ve run into real life head on, and basically my playing<br/>\ntime has become very short, to almost non existant.. :(<br/>\nI&#39;m currently lvl 20, and am finding myself getting somewhat<br/>\nfrustrated.  I have a few wizards in the group of ppl that I play with<br/>\n(all higher lvl though) and I am able to occasinoally go to multiple<br/>\nzones.  I&#39;m having an extremely tough time finding a group.  Now, I know<br/>\nmy name has not been tarnished, unless it&#39;s been by an adolescent, so I<br/>\nrule that case out.  My friends say this is a tough time for a cleric to<br/>\nfind groups because our heal spell isn&#39;t that effective (which I<br/>\nagree).  But, being the poor melee&#39;ers we are, I can&#39;t solo (one<br/>\nexception..If I can do 2 things..1) find undead available to kill 2)<br/>\nroot holds).<br/>\nI&#39;ve been to unrest, lake rathe, oasis, bird citie (south karana? or<br/>\nnorth..can&#39;t remember), perma, and basically I never get tells back from<br/>\nanyone.  Now one thing I&#39;ve noticed is that the number of clerics has<br/>\nrisen, and groups will often tell me, &#39;sorry, we already have a<br/>\ncleric&#39;.  And I&#39;m not sure why they wouldn&#39;t want another one! Oh well,<br/>\nI throw that away assuming they are playing their first character.<br/>\nAnyways, I was basically just looking for a place to hunt and that I can<br/>\neasily get a group.  It sucks when you might have 2 hours to play a<br/>\nweek, and you spend 1 hour advertising for a group...<br/>\nOr is it possibly I&#39;m going to have to do my best to find a place to<br/>\nsolo undead for 4 levels?<br/>\n<br/>\nAny and all help would be appreciated.<br/>\nTIA<br/>\n<br/>\nEvertorn<br/>\n20th lvl erudite cleric<br/>\nVeeshan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
