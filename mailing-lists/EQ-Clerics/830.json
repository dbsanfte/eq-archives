High level<br/>\ncharacters would leave in droves for Asheron&#39;s Call, Middle Earth, whatever<br/>\nelse is out there.<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of the fun, and the addictive factor, of RPG&#39;s is the illusion of<br/>\ngrowth: every day you get stronger, more powerful, able to to places you<br/>\nwere not able to before -- cf. the Plane of Fear discussion -- and<br/>\nsuccessfully kill critters that you would have run in terror from a few<br/>\nlevels before.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf characters stop growing, a lot of the fun of the game is gone. I hit the<br/>\nlevel cap in Balder&#39;s Gate about midway through Chapter 4...and lost<br/>\ninterest in the game a few days later. Haven&#39;t finished it, probably won&#39;t<br/>\never.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not sure why Verant would NOT want to raise the level cap.<br/>\n<br/>\nI imagine there might be ways to fake it. For example, besides items that<br/>\nraise stats, there might be items that raised one&#39;s Offensive or Defensive<br/>\nor weapons capabilities beyond their caps at level 50, making you<br/>\neffectively a level 55 or 60 or higher character, even though you are still<br/>\nnominally level 50. Hm. That might be interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill, I think Verant has to do something to allow players to increase their<br/>\ncapabilities beyond 50, and to provide challenging places for them to go to<br/>\nexercise those capabilities, if they want to retain their player base.<br/>\n<br/>\n== Gilead, dwarven cleric of Fennin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Azor &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jmaynus@...\">jmaynus@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Friday, August 06, 1999 1:37 PM<br/>\nSubject: [EQ-Clerics] Expansion Pak<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Azor&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jmaynus@...\">jmaynus@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;For those dying for the upcoming expansion pak the bad news is, it won&#39;t be<br/>\n&gt;out before Christmas BUT March 16th, 2000.

A bit later<br/>\n </span></blockquote>he<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;said something about if they did it might be from Lvl 50-60.  I think 50 is<br/>\n&gt;cool for now but if they do give us more I think it should be at least 75.<br/>\n&gt;As I was writing this I read more on EQVault they guy said Verant is<br/>\n&gt;thinking of raising the lvl cap to 55 or so.
