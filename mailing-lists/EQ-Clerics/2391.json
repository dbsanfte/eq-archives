Our purpose is to show Verant that a great number of Clerics and their friends are dissatisfied with the current state of the Cleric-only armor quests that were meant to replace Rubicite. The Cleric-only armor presently has two flaws that we would like to see corrected. One, the quests themselves take a ridiculously long amount of time to complete (days or weeks for just one piece), and two, the armor class (AC) of the Cleric-only armor is not on par with classes of its type (The new Cleric-only armor&#39;s AC is actually *lower* than the original Rubicite).

I look forward to seeing everyone there, and in all hopes we can get Verant to listen to our suggestions. Thank you all for your support.<br/>\n<br/>\nSincerely,<br/>\n<br/>\nNorin Grimsbane of The Tribunal</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
