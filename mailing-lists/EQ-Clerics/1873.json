Be careful as thee<br/>\nare alot of HG about sometimes and cyclops. They should be easy for you.<br/>\nAlso in this zone as someone has mentioned are gorge hounds not too hard and<br/>\nCrag Spiders. Crags are tough and have nasty poison. carrions might be<br/>\nbetter to start with but a crag if you root , blast, melee and leave enough<br/>\nto cure the poison after should be ok too and great xp just pull them to the<br/>\nriver bank as the lions have a massive agro radius if you try and med here.<br/>\n<br/>\nSouth Karanas has alot of soloable stuff as does Rathe mountains, or the<br/>\nultra boring and penniless way (you will be poor as wehn you started with<br/>\nthis one) Oasis. Pick dry bones off as well as crypt mummies DW caimans and<br/>\ncrocodiles.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwylork<br/>\n<br/>\nP.s. if your really lucky and brave an Eye might show that is why when in<br/>\nthis zone prot vs magic and poison are essential latter for spiders<br/>\nobviously.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
