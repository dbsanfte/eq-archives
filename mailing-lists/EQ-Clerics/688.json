Another truly bizzarre thing<br/>\nis how the economy makes no sense at all.  You&#39;ve got merchants who<br/>\nwillingly buy things that have no market value, ie, fish scales.  And<br/>\nwill gladly give you money for them.  I mean, let&#39;s say I&#39;ve got 100<br/>\nfish scales in my inventory and walk up to a merchant, he&#39;ll buy them<br/>\noff me with a smile.  What&#39;s he gonna do with all those fish scales?<br/>\nIs there some sort of underground trade in fish scales that I&#39;m not<br/>\naware of?  I don&#39;t know how these merchants are making any money.<br/>\n  And those guards.  I tell you where they need to be - out patrolling<br/>\nroads killing hill giants so that people can travel between Qeynos and<br/>\nFreeport, for example.  Travel is just downright treacherous and seems<br/>\nto discourage adventuring.  crazy.<br/>\n  I love the game, don&#39;t get me wrong, but it&#39;s just plain kooky.<br/>\nThey need to hire me is what they need to do. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;HEY! You&#39;re absolutely right. And I have an idea. First, improve EQ&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;quest elements,  then make unique items like journeyman boots quest<br/>\n&gt;items. VERY DIFFICULT items could be part of a VERY DIFFICULT quest, but<br/>\n&gt;that&#39;s ok, cause there would be no camping, no kill stealing, and you<br/>\n&gt;would be doing a lot more exploring and getting experience while doing<br/>\n&gt;it. And, I think, you&#39;d be having a lot more fun using your brain than<br/>\n&gt;using the /gesture command (after that 35th level wizard just stole your<br/>\n&gt;kill for the 3rd time in the same day). What do you think? I mean, isn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;that why they call it EVERquest?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Saidinn D&#39;iniluki<br/>\n&gt;Dark Elf Cleric<br/>\n&gt;Karana server<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;ONElist:  your connection to like-minds and kindred spirits.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
