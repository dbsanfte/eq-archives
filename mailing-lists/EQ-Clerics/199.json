I know this is ranting but hear me out. I know we aren&#39;t fighters but we are defensive players in the game. Why not give us a few defensive weapons. Weapons with random charges of some type of defensive spell. I know ya&#39;ll will all say well what about the screaming mace? Blah it does a whole lot of good for you when your not even supposed to be tanking right? Anyway, why not have that cast as an area affect yaulp? That would be much kewler and much more beneficial to the group. What do all of ya&#39;ll think about something like that? I&#39;m not saying that the clerics in general are unbalanced in the game but what I&#39;m saying is there are weapons that are class specific to most other classes but the clerics. Please give me your feedback. Please feel free to rant right back at me to... just don&#39;t be too harsh! :)<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************<br/>\nHuman Cleric<br/>\nRamsess De&#39;Vizier<br/>\nRallos Zek<br/>\n**********************</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
