Don&#39;t even consider doing that 1 pt thing into each, cause I know someone who made a lot of food and water for themselves and group and wound up specializing in Conjuration.  Train each of the other ones 1 time, then alteration like 5 - 10 times, just to be sure you max that one first.<br/>\n<br/>\nMik<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Jeff Portwine <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Friday, November 19, 1999 2:15 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [EQ-Clerics] The specialize skill<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  A question for all you level 50 clerics, or at least clerics above level 30...  what is the best school of magic to specialize in?   My initial thought is that I would want to specialize in alteration since that is the school that the healing spells are in and I think I use the healing spells more than any other...  Somebody else suggested that I put one practice point into each school and just go with whichever one increases over 50 first... the theory being that whichever one goes over 50 first is probably the one I use the most.   Does anybody else have any ideas reguarding which school is best to specialize in?<br/>\n  I am level 29, about half way to 30... so I will soon be facing this choice.  Thanks!<br/>\n<br/>\n  -Eachann Bronzeleaf<br/>\n  -Cleric of Tunare, Tarew Marr </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
