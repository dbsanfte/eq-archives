We have this thread about being a tank vs.<br/>\nbeing a healer as a cleric, and then we see this cleric only weapon<br/>\nand it basically screams, &quot;be a tank!&quot;  I mean, yaulp III, and the<br/>\nstats are mightily impressive.  So, it would seem that Verant wants<br/>\nus to be a tank.  Otherwise, it would have had moderate damage but<br/>\nlike some really good effect like the cleanse effect of the SSOL but<br/>\nhave like +20 wisdom or something impressive.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:srutkowski@...\">srutkowski@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Even if I was given the opportunity to loot that weapon, I probably <br/>\n&gt;wouldn&#39;t.<br/>\n&gt;The only reason I might loot it is for the novelty or for trade- isn&#39;t it <br/>\n&gt;no<br/>\n&gt;drop?  If so, there goes that thought.  I&#39;ll take my Charred Guardian <br/>\n&gt;Shield and<br/>\n&gt;soon completed Paw anyday over that weapon.  Wow, a whole what- maybe 60 <br/>\n&gt;pts of<br/>\n&gt;damage to something that has 2K-5K hitpoints?  If it had some +wis like the<br/>\n&gt;shaman or druid only weapons (those in the game and being implemented), <br/>\n&gt;then<br/>\n&gt;maybe.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Oh well, I don&#39;t really need a weapon anyway, but thanks for thinking of us<br/>\n&gt;Verant.  Oh, wait a minute..... you think clerics are so balanced that you <br/>\n&gt;don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;want to give us weapon that may help us do our job?  You&#39;re right on class<br/>\n&gt;balance, but never mind the thanks :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ailamil </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
