Be careful at first what you pull. By standing in the right spot,<br/>\nuse of root and ward you should be able pull and take yellows easily. Use<br/>\nthe wood elf camp as your base and you can run back and forth for safety.<br/>\nOften there will be other clerics around that can pitch in if things get out<br/>\nof hand. Be careful though as you are the lowest level where I would risk it<br/>\nand even the orcs round there might beat you to a pulp.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Garza, Russell [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:r.garza@...\">r.garza@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, September 24, 1999 3:39 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: [EQ-Clerics] A lower level Cleric speaks...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Garza, Russell&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:r.garza@...\">r.garza@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHello all, <br/>\n<br/>\nI barely got lvl 9 last night (Woo Hoo!), and can&#39;t figure out any good<br/>\nspots to hunt.  It seems that everywhere I&#39;ve been has a lot of greens and<br/>\nyellows, or some blues hanging around with a bunch of yellows/reds.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny advice on where a young cleric can get some experience.  I&#39;m tired of<br/>\nrunning for the zone when those Legionnaires come to the aide of their cent<br/>\ncounterparts.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure you all remember getting 9th, but I don&#39;t know if you felt the<br/>\ndisappointment, that I did, in the spells that we got.  I was all psyched to<br/>\nget root and maybe soothe, but what else is there that works well?  I&#39;m<br/>\nstill using furor as my DD spell.  Seems pretty weak compared to a 9th level<br/>\nDruid&#39;s &quot;ignite&quot; spell that took a cent out in 2 casts.  I can hit em 4 or 5<br/>\ntimes with furor and still have to duke it out for a while.  Any<br/>\nencouragement out there?<br/>\n<br/>\nWixl<br/>\n9th level Cleric<br/>\nBertoxxulous Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
