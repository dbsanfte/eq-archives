I just gained 25 thru 27 there, and previous to<br/>\nthat I gained 22 thru 24 in Cazic.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll you need to do is get in a good group and hold the &quot;corner&quot; in MM (this<br/>\nis just around the tower, right  before you reach the tunnel to the<br/>\nGraveyard.), from here the puller can clear out the tunnel and the lake/hill<br/>\nspawns with the occasional garg from the tower above.  If you are in a high<br/>\nlevel group 24-30 (avg lvl 27), then you could easily hold the GY as well.<br/>\nJust clear the tunnel first, and then move to the GY.  Remember to sit just<br/>\nto the *right* inside the entrance.  There is one &quot;glyphed&quot; spawn here and<br/>\ntwo across the yard.  Then there are some behind the building, but you can<br/>\npull one to two of these at a time.  Also, the nice benefit is every 25-30<br/>\nmins, the Avenging Caitiff (lv30) spawns and a good gorup of 26+ could<br/>\neasily take him solo.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Cazic, just hold the yard with a low-to-mid 20s group and pull *lots* of<br/>\nstuff from the Maze.  Not much to it, just make sure the puller knows<br/>\nhis/her way around the Maze.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn Enchanter who knows how to use Mez can be invaluable in both of these<br/>\ncircumstances, because if your puller or the group next to you&#39;s puller<br/>\nyanks too much from either the GY or Maze, then you could actually handle<br/>\nthem one at a time.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne a side note, the loot in MM is poor unless you move to the GY, where as<br/>\nin Cazic almost all but the lizzies that /con green to you and perhaps the<br/>\nWarders, will drop an FS weapon if they wield a weapon (which can be quite<br/>\nfrequently).<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps some =)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Z.C.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
