I even got boots out of the<br/>\ndeal.(granted<br/>\n&gt; efreeti boots are better, but I was wearing charred, so they are better<br/>\nthan<br/>\n&gt; what I had)  The game has gotten kind of boring as of late and the plane<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; fear adds a new and exciting twist to my playtime, I can&#39;t wait to go back<br/>\n&gt; this weekend again.(no wonder I am still level 47, hehe)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I guess from my standpoint I can either, try and complete these quests<br/>\nwhich<br/>\n&gt; gets me no experience at all, with no idea of what I will recieve OR I can<br/>\n&gt; get XP in Lguk or SolB all week long, so I have a nice buffer for going to<br/>\n&gt; fear on the weekends and potential for getting armor that I already know<br/>\nis<br/>\n&gt; Whoop daddy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Just my thoughts once again,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Bree Wyndsdale<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
