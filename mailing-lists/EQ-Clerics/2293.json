You can either hunt the better loot areas or<br/>\nyou can be a wandering merchant.  You just have to<br/>\ngive up a little bit of hunting time and a lot of<br/>\nrunning back and forth to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nEXAMPLES:<br/>\n<br/>\nTake a few plat with you (lets just say 9 for<br/>\nstarters)<br/>\nGo to unrest or cazic thule and hang in the zone area.<br/>\n Auction off that you are buying fine steel for 3pp<br/>\neach.  Most people hunting these areas end up with an<br/>\nover abundance of fine steel and will sell it just to<br/>\nget rid of the weight while still making a few plat. <br/>\nTake this to the nearest town and sell.  You should<br/>\nget approximately 5pp each (depending on your charisma<br/>\nof course)  3 fine steel items x 5 pp each equals out<br/>\nto about 15pp.  Go back in and advertise again.  This<br/>\ntime you can buy 5 items at 3pp each.  Wash rinse<br/>\nrepeat!  Two trips and you already doubled your plat.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother way is to become a wandering banker.  Offer to<br/>\nexchange your gold and plat for someone&#39;s copper and<br/>\nsilver (charge a small amount of course!).<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a few ideas, I know they work but have never<br/>\ntried them since I would rather hunt =)<br/>\n<br/>\nAdira SoulSaver<br/>\n<br/>\n--- &quot;Cliff, Monty&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mcliff@...\">mcliff@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt;      <br/>\n&gt; Just curious, but how did you afford all this stuff<br/>\n&gt; at L14 and still <br/>\n&gt; be able to do jewlcraft?
