I would<br/>\nprobably choose the runed circlet becasue it is only one wisdom less and has<br/>\nmore AC.   When you get a few more levels and into your 30&#39;s you can camp<br/>\nthe nightshade wreath if you really want to have +5/+5 instead of +4/+4.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Another question,<br/>\n&gt; Do you think gatorscale leggings are better than the cleric legs?<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s a AC 4 reduction, but an increase in +4 wisdom.  Just curious on<br/>\n&gt; everyone&#39;s thoughts on this one.  Does gatorscale look like leather?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>there is no doubt in my mind whatsoever that the gator legs are better.<br/>\nSome will argue with me on this point i&#39;m about to make, but in my opinion<br/>\nAC is not all that important.  At least the way I play I find that I am<br/>\nbecoming more and more of a caster every level and I hardly melee at all<br/>\nnow.  When something is on me i&#39;m shouting at my group to get it off so I<br/>\ncan heal them.  Since (ideally) I&#39;m not getting hit all that much AC is less<br/>\nimportant.  The argument could be made that more AC would help you take hits<br/>\nand thus give your group more time to get stuff off of you.  However, the 4<br/>\nAC isn&#39;t that huge of a difference... the cleric legs give +intelligence<br/>\nwhich is totally useless to a cleric.   Take the +wisdom... IMHO you should<br/>\nalways take the Wisdom above just about anything else.   Another good point<br/>\nof the gator legs is that they only weigh 0.2 (or was it 0.4?) , and if you<br/>\nare anything like me you are always encumbered and it&#39;s nice to have such<br/>\nnice gear weigh so little.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Eachann Bronzeleaf<br/>\n-Cleric of Tunare, Tarew Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ______________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; FREE ADVICE FROM REAL PEOPLE!
