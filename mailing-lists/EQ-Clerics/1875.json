I spent a stupid amount of time killing the pirahna in the<br/>\nlake, and giving the teeth to Fiddy Bobick.  As it turns out, it&#39;s a<br/>\nreally good quest, that gives quite a bit of loot, for as easy as it<br/>\nis.  You might try this one.<br/>\n  Although, now that I think of it, I don&#39;t know if this quest affects<br/>\nthe R&#39;vale clerics or not.  What faction is that?<br/>\n  Also, I wouldn&#39;t be too concerned about buying spells there.  As a<br/>\nhigh elf, I can get my spells cheaper in Felwithe anyway.  I just got<br/>\nto level 19, and needed to buy spells, and Qeynos and Rivervale were<br/>\nthe highest.  Freeport had decent prices, and Felwithe is usually the<br/>\nlowest, although it matches Freeport on many of them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Chris Wheeler &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wheelech@...\">wheelech@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: &quot;&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&#39;&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: [EQ-Clerics] Faction in Rivervale<br/>\n&gt;Date: Mon, 18 Oct 1999 13:34:03 -0400<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hi all,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I am a halfling cleric of Rivervale, and have lost faction in my town with<br/>\n&gt;the merchants.  This was caused by fighting with Mangler.  I killed him 3 <br/>\n&gt;or<br/>\n&gt;4 times as a young halfling, because he atacked me.  The 5th time I did it,<br/>\n&gt;I lost enough faction to con dubious, and hence, lose buying and selling<br/>\n&gt;privileges.  I was able to regain my faction by handing in 24 RE warbeads <br/>\n&gt;to<br/>\n&gt;the sheriff. That was level 9.  However, at level 11, I was again attacked<br/>\n&gt;by him, but he was killed by someone else. No matter, my faction bit the<br/>\n&gt;dust again.  Now, at level 13, almost 14, I have handed in 96 warbeads, and<br/>\n&gt;still con dubious to the merchants, and still can&#39;t buy nor sell (other <br/>\n&gt;than<br/>\n&gt;to the druids).  My questions are this:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;1) How many RE warbeads do I need to hand in?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;2) As I get higher in level, is it more required of me to regain faction?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The only reason this really matters is because I can&#39;t buy my spells from<br/>\n&gt;the cleric guild any more.  Otherwise, I wouldn&#39;t give a hoot.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;From: Mike Schlagenhauf [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:trelane@...\">trelane@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;Sent: 1999/10/18 12:58 PM<br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] Testament of Vanear - SPOILER!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: &quot;Mike Schlagenhauf&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:trelane@...\">trelane@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;It&#39;s actually an exact 7 hour spawn.
