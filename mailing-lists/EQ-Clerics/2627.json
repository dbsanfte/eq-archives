Druid&#39;s buffs<br/>\ndon&#39;t stack with our buffs.  Like skin like steel is equivalent to<br/>\nbravery, I think.  So, rather than deplete the poor cleric&#39;s mana,<br/>\nthey might have tried to just space that out, and let the Druid take<br/>\nsome of the buffing responsibility.  Tanks would want the symbol of<br/>\nPinzarn spell since that would stack with anything, and would add a<br/>\nton of HP to them.  The wizards wouldn&#39;t quite need that much, and I&#39;m<br/>\nnot sure why they requested anything at all, since if the dragon<br/>\nstarts whopping on them, there&#39;s not much hope anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my two cents.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Rose&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rliu@...\">rliu@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nReply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: [EQ-Clerics] Seeking advice...<br/>\nDate: Thu, 13 Jan 2000 13:02:02 -0600<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHello,<br/>\n<br/>\nMy RL friend who has a lvl 50 cleric is going to go on a 1 month vacation.<br/>\nShe has asked me to play her cleric for our guild when it&#39;s needed.  The<br/>\nhighest I&#39;ve ever gotten a cleric to is lvl 28.  Last night was the first<br/>\ntime I ever played a lvl 50 cleric and I have to admit it was like being<br/>\ntoss into the water without knowing how to swim.  We were doing a dragon run<br/>\nof all things.  Anyway, the healing part I think I gotten down...I mainly<br/>\njust cast superior heals...the time needed to cast a CH was just too nerve<br/>\nracking for me.  I was told to cast panzia (sp?) symbol on caster and nalton<br/>\n(sp?) on tanks (why that is so...I didn&#39;t bothered to ask...was a bit too<br/>\nbusy trying to figured out other stuff).  If there is a druid around then do<br/>\nmost clerics not cast Reso and AoF?  Most tanks were asking for SLN...were<br/>\nthey trying to split buff duty between druid/shaman/clerics?  Anyway, can<br/>\nany lvl 49+ clerics out there give out advise on what you normally do in<br/>\nhighly stressful combat situation with multi groups going on.  Thanks a<br/>\nbunch.<br/>\n<br/>\nI died like 5 times last nite...hope that wasn&#39;t too unusual.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
