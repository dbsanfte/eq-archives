There is an item indexed on EQ&#39;izer called a<br/>\n&gt; &#39;black silk evening tunic&#39;. It increases your charisma, but isn&#39;t very good<br/>\n&gt; armor. ^_^ Forget where it comes from. Anyone seen anyone wearing one? What<br/>\n&gt; does it look like? Is it strapless?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; For that matter, it might be interesting to go bar-hopping in a tux, my<br/>\n&gt; being a male, and all.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But wait. We&#39;re clerics. Shouldn&#39;t we be able to wear vestments on special<br/>\n&gt; occasions?

What makes it worse is the spell has a small<br/>\n&gt; duration<br/>\n&gt; &gt;and it takes valuable seconds to get yourself pointed back in the right<br/>\n&gt; &gt;direction. Oh well, one can only hope that if enough p<br/>\n&gt; &gt;eople complain EQ designers will adjust it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Also I would like to get your opinions on the fashion issue. What do you<br/>\n&gt; &gt;think of the women of Norrath being able to attend an event, such as a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;wedding in a dress. There also should a gathering place in Qeynos where an<br/>\n&gt; &gt;event could take place without being attacked by beasts, or the guys could<br/>\n&gt; &gt;really become Knights in Shining Armor by protecting all the fair damsels<br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Norrath. Again an item for my wish list as I sometimes get tired of wearing<br/>\n&gt; &gt;my full battle dress all the time. Healingsun, Solusek Ro.
