I have looked all over the web to find the stats of the later hammers I can summon, but have been unable to find them.  Could somebody let me know the stats for the other hammers?  Thanks.  I know they aren&#39;t the best in &quot;ratio&quot;, but they will always be my favorite because they are a gift from Rodcet Nife.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAlso, while lurking I have noticed a lot of complaints that there aren&#39;t any cleric only weapons in the game.  Heh.  Who else gets to use the Hammer of Wrath? :)\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nDevotion\r<br/>\nGuildmaster - Clerics of Norrath Povar</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
