In my experiences<br/>\n&gt;with the game, this is what I have found.  A cleric will never be a tank <br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;yes you will get hit, Mobs tend to dislike clerics when they heal, do DD or<br/>\n&gt;Stun, so AC is a good thing to have but Mana is king for a cleric, In my<br/>\n&gt;opinion.  AC will in no way, shape or form save your life.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;It is an absolute necessity to have good tanks and for you to trust your<br/>\n&gt;tanks, granted this takes time to get really comfortable with a good group<br/>\n&gt;of people.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Basically what i&#39;m saying is while AC is good, you should not be getting<br/>\n&gt;hit.  When you do get hit, your tanks are obligated to taunt the beast off<br/>\n&gt;of you, no matter how many mobs you are fighting.  This is the way it works<br/>\n&gt;in the group I hunt with. My group is always the same with minor <br/>\n&gt;alterations<br/>\n&gt;to one position, it is an advantage having a group that is with each other<br/>\n&gt;all the time, you come to learn how each one will react in certain<br/>\n&gt;situations.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;we have in our standard group:<br/>\n&gt;Paladin, Ranger, Warrior, Wizard, Enchanter, and me the Cleric.<br/>\n&gt;the Tanks( pal, rng, war)are very attentive to when a mob starts to hit a<br/>\n&gt;caster or me, so the more wisdom I have the more I can effectively do my <br/>\n&gt;job<br/>\n&gt;as it was intended which is healing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I even gave up my Azure sleeves ( 12ac) for Platinum armbands ( no AC, but <br/>\n&gt;3<br/>\n&gt;wis) lol, never can have to much wisdom.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Just my opinion,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Bree Wyndsdale<br/>\n&gt;45th Cleric of Fennin Ro<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;From: &quot;Rose&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rliu@...\">rliu@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Subject: [EQ-Clerics] AC vs Stat enhancing armor<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Date: Tue, 24 Aug 1999 11:42:34 -0500<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;From: &quot;Rose&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rliu@...\">rliu@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Hail all,<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;This question most likely has been asked already and I apologize if I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt;&gt;repeating but I am new to the list and rather new to casting class in<br/>\n&gt;&gt;general.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;My question is, which is better, pure AC or stat enchancing armor?  I was<br/>\n&gt;&gt;thinking of covering myself fully in bronze plate but there are things <br/>\n&gt;&gt;like<br/>\n&gt;&gt;BS tunic, barb arms, silver plated bracers that I will be putting aside.  <br/>\n&gt;&gt;I<br/>\n&gt;&gt;am playing mostly a casting cleric...and I figured AC would save my life<br/>\n&gt;&gt;more then any stat enhancing armor.
