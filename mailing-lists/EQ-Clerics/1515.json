Death after death after death.  Between deaths and <br/>\nrunning to the zone there were no points made.  The only time we were there <br/>\nsuccessfully was in a room (hand room) i think.  Then shortly a high lvl <br/>\ncleric came in and ran us out....i am now almost lvl 27 and haven&#39;t been <br/>\nback yet.  I may try to go back soon though...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;William Hooker&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wahooker@...\">wahooker@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_CLERIC@...\">EQ_CLERIC@...</a>, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: [EQ-Clerics] Suggestions for high teen levels in unrest?<br/>\n&gt;Date: Fri, 24 Sep 1999 07:52:25 EDT<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: &quot;William Hooker&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wahooker@...\">wahooker@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I have heard from many many people that unrest is a great place for a <br/>\n&gt;cleric<br/>\n&gt;to go starting around 14 or so.  I am 17th (almost 18th) and am having<br/>\n&gt;serious trouble there.  Last night 6 people from my guild were there, all<br/>\n&gt;15-20 and we had a rough time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;We were at the back wall pulling from the back door.  We had SoW and invis<br/>\n&gt;to undead on the puller at all times, but there were many times where she<br/>\n&gt;ended up bringing quite a few too many ghouls.  (tried to pull 1 and<br/>\n&gt;suddenly there were 7 of them on us!)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Are we hunting at too high a level, or are we pulling from the wrong place?<br/>\n&gt;Or do we just suck?  We only had 2 deaths last night, but many many many<br/>\n&gt;close calls.  Lets just say thank god our druid was also saving 50% mana <br/>\n&gt;for<br/>\n&gt;heals.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Meddik<br/>\n&gt;Jaegergruppe<br/>\n&gt;Bristlebane<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
