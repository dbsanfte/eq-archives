The group was consisting<br/>\nof 3 tanks and 2 clerics.  We had some good fighting/pulling and basically<br/>\nit was a good raid.  I was unsure, and still is, on what my role as the<br/>\n&quot;other&quot; cleric is.  The more experienced cleric in the group was rather<br/>\nuncommunicative.  I basically buffed and kept the buffing on all the tanks,<br/>\nand the clerics.  I cast out SH when I saw health going down drastically and<br/>\nGH once in awhile. I did cast Naltron on all the tanks though...wasted alot<br/>\nof money =/  I had like 20 peridot now Im down to 5<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCan anyone tell me if u use atone on any of these raids?  If so, just how do<br/>\nu go about using it?  I mean do you heal, atone, heal, atone...just so that<br/>\nthe thing won&#39;t frenzy on you?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again for all the helpful tips and advice =)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
