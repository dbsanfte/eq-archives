They<br/>\nhave no way currently to change to another server, and after a while of<br/>\nbeocming frustrated LEAVE the game.  Fennin has a constant flood of people<br/>\nin almost ALL zones.  If someone finds something new, a new spawn point<br/>\nwhich is decent, a new piece of EQ, etc....people FLOOD that zone.  About<br/>\nthe only zones/areas I see uncrowded in EQ are zones/areas that I get<br/>\nabsolutly NO exp from....none what so ever in my currently lvl.   Befallen<br/>\nis even overcrowded (i&#39;ve seen 60 people in the folks)  Unrest commonly has<br/>\n60 people in it  aday...most bitching about stealing kills.  I&#39;m actually<br/>\nbeginning to despise playing EQ because of this fact myself.  You cant go<br/>\nsomewhere with friends and have fun because when you do, you find people in<br/>\nthat spot you guys planned to hit, and if you try to join, they bitch at<br/>\nyou.  When people start to leave, and you start seeing websites posting how<br/>\nbad it is....more and more often....you&#39;ll see an outflow of people.  How<br/>\nmany people have you all seen leave Fennin, or any high lag server due to<br/>\nfrustrattion?  My bet would be the same amount as the new people you&#39;ve seen<br/>\ncoming in.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBann<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Mr. J Daniels [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warpig@...\">warpig@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, September 10, 1999 1:49 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] EQ Slowly Dying?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom:\t&quot;Mr. J Daniels&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warpig@...\">warpig@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nLets see, Fennin Ro had 1900 people on it when I logged on last night,  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think its going anywhere soon.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Fri, 10 Sep 1999, Jesse Anderton wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Jesse Anderton&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tsedek50@...\">tsedek50@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The real shame about a game like EQ is that once it&#39;s gone no one can play<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; anymore.

Many are just bored of the game and are quiting<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &gt;or<br/>\n&gt; &gt;getting ready to, others are getting tired of Verant changing everything <br/>\n&gt; &gt;and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;some of it is for the worse.  I&#39;ve read where they are saying it&#39;s too<br/>\nlate<br/>\n&gt; &gt;to save EQ, some even say even the new addon will not save it cause it&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; &gt;still be the same game with just some new things.  And yeah it might<br/>\nspice<br/>\n&gt; &gt;it up a bit, but for how long, I give it 3-4 months tops.  After 3-4<br/>\nmonths<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the power gamers will already have the extra lvls, everyone should have <br/>\n&gt; &gt;been<br/>\n&gt; &gt;in all the new zones, had a chance to play the new lizardman race.  So<br/>\nonce<br/>\n&gt; &gt;that happens it&#39;s gonna be right back to where it is now.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Some are waiting for Asheron&#39;s Call and others are waiting for<br/>\nMiddle-Earth<br/>\n&gt; &gt;to be released.  Will AC or ME finish off EQ?  I guess time will tell but<br/>\n&gt; &gt;since theres like 3-4 other RPGs coming out by the year 2000 I say one of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;them will put an end to EQ.  And if EQ does die to fast it&#39;s no ones<br/>\nfault<br/>\n&gt; &gt;but Verants for not listening to the paying customers, they listen to a<br/>\nfew<br/>\n&gt; &gt;but not the whole.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Even tho EQ is a very good game it can&#39;t or won&#39;t be around forever.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;**************************<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Azor<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Lvl 18 Human Cleric of the Rathe<br/>\n&gt; &gt;**************************<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;ONElist:  your connection to online communities.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; How would you like to have a voice in the marketplace and be<br/>\n&gt; rewarded for it?
