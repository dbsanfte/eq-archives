I see what <br/>\nhe&#39;s saying about not giving people buffs just because they don&#39;t want them.  <br/>\nBut I also see where RPing your character is to give him all of the buffs.  <br/>\nPerhaps your character is the ultimate giver.  Always helping even when <br/>\npeople don&#39;t want it.  Do you remember your mother helping you clean your <br/>\nroom even though you didn&#39;t want it?  Well, maybe some characters are like <br/>\nthat.
