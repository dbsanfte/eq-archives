My group of 5<br/>\nwere the only people in Befallen the other day.  That&#39;s right, just 5<br/>\npeople in the entire zone.  I can&#39;t count the number of times I have<br/>\nbeen the only person in freeport or Rivervale.  Last night we were the<br/>\nonly ones in Erudia, and likewise the only ones in Kerra Isle. (not<br/>\nwisp isle).<br/>\n  A lot of Test regulars don&#39;t want more people.  Me, I welcome it.<br/>\nSometimes it&#39;s hard to find a group.  Sure test may be somewhat<br/>\nunstable, but we get all the latest patches, and in the evenings its<br/>\nfairly reliable.  We deal with it.  But we are a happy lot, and we<br/>\njust sit back and laugh at you people that have to deal with camping<br/>\nissues, or kill-stealing, or lag.<br/>\n  Heh.<br/>\nOh, to get into the test server, run testeqgame.exe, I think. It&#39;s a<br/>\ndifferent executable.  At most, there are a like 250 people.  A word<br/>\nof warning, though, Race War is being tested, but only a few people<br/>\nare participating in it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Ralph Carothers &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:CarothersR@...\">CarothersR@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: &quot;&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&#39;&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: RE: [EQ-Clerics] EQ Slowly Dying?<br/>\n&gt;Date: Fri, 10 Sep 1999 13:56:07 -0400<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;at the same time, fennin has this because the new people joining the game<br/>\n&gt;see fennin with the highest amount, and not understanding how the game<br/>\n&gt;works....they head to where the most are naturally.  then they get a lil<br/>\n&gt;higher....dont want to lose the character, and they are then stuck.  They<br/>\n&gt;have no way currently to change to another server, and after a while of<br/>\n&gt;beocming frustrated LEAVE the game.  Fennin has a constant flood of people<br/>\n&gt;in almost ALL zones.  If someone finds something new, a new spawn point<br/>\n&gt;which is decent, a new piece of EQ, etc....people FLOOD that zone.  About<br/>\n&gt;the only zones/areas I see uncrowded in EQ are zones/areas that I get<br/>\n&gt;absolutly NO exp from....none what so ever in my currently lvl.   Befallen<br/>\n&gt;is even overcrowded (i&#39;ve seen 60 people in the folks)  Unrest commonly has<br/>\n&gt;60 people in it  aday...most bitching about stealing kills.  I&#39;m actually<br/>\n&gt;beginning to despise playing EQ because of this fact myself.  You cant go<br/>\n&gt;somewhere with friends and have fun because when you do, you find people in<br/>\n&gt;that spot you guys planned to hit, and if you try to join, they bitch at<br/>\n&gt;you.  When people start to leave, and you start seeing websites posting how<br/>\n&gt;bad it is....more and more often....you&#39;ll see an outflow of people.  How<br/>\n&gt;many people have you all seen leave Fennin, or any high lag server due to<br/>\n&gt;frustrattion?  My bet would be the same amount as the new people you&#39;ve <br/>\n&gt;seen<br/>\n&gt;coming in.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Bann<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;From: Mr. J Daniels [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warpig@...\">warpig@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;Sent: Friday, September 10, 1999 1:49 PM<br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] EQ Slowly Dying?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From:\t&quot;Mr. J Daniels&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warpig@...\">warpig@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Lets see, Fennin Ro had 1900 people on it when I logged on last night,  I<br/>\n&gt;don&#39;t think its going anywhere soon.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;On Fri, 10 Sep 1999, Jesse Anderton wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Jesse Anderton&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tsedek50@...\">tsedek50@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The real shame about a game like EQ is that once it&#39;s gone no one can <br/>\n&gt;play<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; anymore.

Many are just bored of the game and are <br/>\n&gt;quiting<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;getting ready to, others are getting tired of Verant changing <br/>\n&gt;everything<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;some of it is for the worse.  I&#39;ve read where they are saying it&#39;s too<br/>\n&gt;late<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;to save EQ, some even say even the new addon will not save it cause <br/>\n&gt;it&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;still be the same game with just some new things.  And yeah it might<br/>\n&gt;spice<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;it up a bit, but for how long, I give it 3-4 months tops.  After 3-4<br/>\n&gt;months<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;the power gamers will already have the extra lvls, everyone should have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;been<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;in all the new zones, had a chance to play the new lizardman race.  So<br/>\n&gt;once<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;that happens it&#39;s gonna be right back to where it is now.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Some are waiting for Asheron&#39;s Call and others are waiting for<br/>\n&gt;Middle-Earth<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;to be released.  Will AC or ME finish off EQ?  I guess time will tell <br/>\n&gt;but<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;since theres like 3-4 other RPGs coming out by the year 2000 I say one <br/>\n&gt;of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;them will put an end to EQ.  And if EQ does die to fast it&#39;s no ones<br/>\n&gt;fault<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;but Verants for not listening to the paying customers, they listen to a<br/>\n&gt;few<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;but not the whole.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Even tho EQ is a very good game it can&#39;t or won&#39;t be around forever.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;**************************<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Azor<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Lvl 18 Human Cleric of the Rathe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;**************************<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor <br/>\n&gt;----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;ONElist:  your connection to online communities.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; How would you like to have a voice in the marketplace and be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; rewarded for it?
