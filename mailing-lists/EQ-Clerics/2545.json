Suprisingly, it isn&#39;t as<br/>\nprofitable as you might imagine.  At some points, it gets down right<br/>\nannoying to do. I have made about 30pp doing it in one nite, but it does<br/>\nbecome tiresome.  If you have the patience to do it, you can spend hours<br/>\ntrying to buy and sell.  But in my opinion, it just ends up being a waste of<br/>\ntime.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrytewing.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Heather Daley [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:blushn@...\">blushn@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: 1999/12/14 11:43 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] making money (was: wis items)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Heather Daley&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:blushn@...\">blushn@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was a great little business on Fennin Ro called, Rokk and Rhunes <br/>\nEmporium, hehe.  These 2 Ogres had this business going in Cazic doing the <br/>\nvery same thing.  At least one of them was there everyday. They had to have <br/>\nmade tremendous amounts of cash there.  It is very time consuming and takes <br/>\naways from the hunt quite a bit, but it is an easy way to make cash.<br/>\nI also just recently noticed that there is a travelling person in South <br/>\nKarana now, he starts out at the Bridge, announcing to the zone he is there <br/>\nto change their money for them from Copper to silver, gold, etc...  He then <br/>\ntravels to different set locations, Centaurs, aviaks, etc... advertising as <br/>\nhe goes.  I&#39;m not sure how successful he is but seems like it would be <br/>\nprofittable.<br/>\n<br/>\nBree</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
