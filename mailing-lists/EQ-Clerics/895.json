As a 20th lvl cleric, i help all who i see, <br/>\nunless i am in a group and we are fighting, as i may need my manna for heals <br/>\nwithin my group.  I have made a staunch rule that my group comes first!! As <br/>\na clecic i heal my party members first even if it means i will lose my life. <br/>\n  If i am in a battle and someone calls for help the only way i help them is <br/>\nwhen i am done with the current battle or if my party members have the fight <br/>\nunder control.  Often times i go to places that i know i am way to high to <br/>\nbe and just stand back and heal others, i enjoy helping and thats why i <br/>\nchose to be a cleric.  Again welcome to the list **hugs**<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AsmodeusDP@...\">AsmodeusDP@...</a><br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: [EQ-Clerics] Cleric Behaviour<br/>\n&gt;Date: Fri, 20 Aug 1999 23:01:02 EDT<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AsmodeusDP@...\">AsmodeusDP@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m new to this mail list, and thought I would introduce myself with a <br/>\n&gt;topic<br/>\n&gt;to discuss.  I&#39;ve often wondered what exactly it means to be a cleric in<br/>\n&gt;Norrath.  My personal opinion is that we should always be merciful to those<br/>\n&gt;around us, and help in any way we can.  Even if to heal someone we don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt;even<br/>\n&gt;know completely depletes our mana.
