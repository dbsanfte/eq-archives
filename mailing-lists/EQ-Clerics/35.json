All three times I came out on top because I was<br/>\n&gt;prepared.  I sat down and memorized flash of light and root along with my<br/>\n&gt;regular arsenal of spells.  Those two spells can turn the tide on any fight<br/>\n&gt;up to 3 levels above you.  First you blind them, that way they have no Idea<br/>\n&gt;where you are.  Then you root them, walk around behind them and beat on<br/>\n </span></blockquote>them<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;or stand back and nuke them.  The tactic I used on a spell caster was<br/>\n&gt;simple.  I challenged him and as soon as he accepted I cast divine aura on<br/>\n&gt;myself.  He mana hosed himself in the first 25 second and I had free reign<br/>\n&gt;to beat him soundly about the head and shoulders.

Anyways, he was about 2 or 3<br/>\n&gt;&gt; levels ahead of me, and a magician.  My advice against spell casters<br/>\n&gt;&gt; would be just to fight as normal against them, and try to disrupt their<br/>\n&gt;&gt; spelling, and after they bombard you with their spells and drain their<br/>\n&gt;&gt; mana, heal yourself.  This would make their magic casting in vain, and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; give you the advantage.  If you have plenty of magic left, smite them,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; or use any other powerful magic against them to drop their health down,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; and simply melee them until their dead or unconscious (anyway you<br/>\n&gt;&gt; prefer).<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Aldaren wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; From: Aldaren &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:knight@...\">knight@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Hail fellow Clerics,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;   I have witnessed and read about many adventurers dueling to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; test their skills or to settle a dispute.  However, I have<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; never seen a Cleric duel nor have heard of one.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;   Since we are in charge of Saving lives, how do we tune<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; ourselves to Take a life? Clerics are far from being cowards,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; but to decline a duel or be somewhat at a loss durring a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; potential guild war, can bring shame upon the class.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;   So I ask, are there any dueling clerics out there that can<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; lend their experiences to a beginning duelest?
