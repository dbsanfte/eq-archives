A ticked cleric...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  From: &quot;Jeff Portwine&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jdport@...\">jdport@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Warning... a serious rant follows:<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Rant begins]<br/>\n<br/>\n  I just read the patch notes for the new patch and I must say I am<br/>\nEXTREMELY displeased.   I&#39;ve been hearing rumors for a couple of weeks from<br/>\nmany different sources that this new patch was going to improve the<br/>\nsituations clerics have with the HORRIBLE camps the have to do to get their<br/>\narmor.   Well, this patch seems to have enhancements for just about everyone<br/>\nexcept clerics.  Not one single thing in it to effect clerics.  Even the<br/>\narmor of Ro, they say they are chaning it to increase the drops.  That is<br/>\njust BS.  I will be the first to admit that the paladin armor quests are<br/>\nhard.  They are very very hard.  But they aren&#39;t hard becasue of the rarity<br/>\nof drops!!!!  Most of their stuff drops relatively often... though it is<br/>\nhard to get (i.e. the caudrons in mistmoore).    How many days now have I<br/>\nbeen camping that freaking Aviak in the OOT???  Just about every cleric i&#39;ve<br/>\ntalked to who is trying to get that, has been camping it for like 2 months<br/>\nand not gotten it.  Those who have gotten it say it took them about 2<br/>\nmonths.  What&#39;s worse is that I still have 3 or 4 camps to do that are as<br/>\nbad or worse.  This is absolutely absurd.  People like me with jobs and<br/>\nlives outside of EQ cannot possibly do these quests and it just pisses me<br/>\noff to no end.    I had thought that there was going to be some relief with<br/>\nhis patch... maybe there will be and it just wasn&#39;t documented... but seeing<br/>\nas how they documented enhancements for just about every single other person<br/>\nin norrath  I really doubt it.   I guess all the feedbacks from every cleric<br/>\nin Norrath just doesn&#39;t matter to Verant.<br/>\n<br/>\n  [rant done]<br/>\n<br/>\n  Heh.. well i won&#39;t stop trying for the armor.. i&#39;m determined to get it<br/>\nwhich makes me wonder about my own sanity since i probably won&#39;t even wear<br/>\nit in most situations.  I just want it for pride.. and it will make<br/>\nsomething very nice to wear to events like weddings and stuff.    Though<br/>\nit&#39;ll be months and months before i have it anyway...<br/>\n<br/>\n  -Eachann<br/>\n<br/>\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n--<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Please click above to support our sponsor<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n--</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
