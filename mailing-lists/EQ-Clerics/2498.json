Before that I had picked up loads of small bronze in<br/>\n&gt;Unrest.  Anyway I&#39;ve been trying to sell this stuff off but not really<br/>\n&gt;had much success..  It&#39;s possible that because I&#39;m from the UK and play<br/>\n&gt;UK evenings I only have a smaller playerbase to sell to but by the end<br/>\n&gt;of the evening the server is normally upto 1000-1300 players..  I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt;ended up giving the stuff away to low level DE clerics (I like to help<br/>\n&gt;DE clerics since there are so few of us).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Personally it&#39;s just not worth the time I need to spend trying to sell<br/>\n&gt;the stuff.. perhaps if I collected enough and went to somewhere like<br/>\n&gt;Qeynos/Qeynos Hills/West Karana, I might be able to sell a lot of the<br/>\n&gt;medium bronze.. but again it&#39;s taking the time to do the trip..<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Dyfed, Erollisi Marr<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Vinamin L&#39;Crit<br/>\n&gt;Lvl 36 DE Cleric<br/>\n&gt;Erollisi Marr<br/>\n&gt;&lt;&lt; text3.html &gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
