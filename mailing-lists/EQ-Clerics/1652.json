What will become of all the exp they gained after<br/>\nthey got Lvl 50?  I think it would be dumb of Verant to allow them to go<br/>\nfrom 50 to what ever Lvl just cause they have enough exp too.  Think about<br/>\nit, would you wanna install the expansion pak just to see &quot;You moved up a<br/>\nlevel(s), Welcome to level 60!&quot; or higher?  What fun would that be?<br/>\nLike one said what if the lvl cap will be say 60 and when you install the<br/>\npak you find out you had enough exp to hit Lvl 60?  Wouldn&#39;t we all want to<br/>\nearn those new lvls with the pak and not now and just have it stored away<br/>\ntill it comes out?<br/>\nI go with what some say, have it to where when the pak comes out you need<br/>\none more kill or a few kills that give you exp to hit Lvl 51.  I doubt I&#39;ll<br/>\nbe on Lvl 50 by then anyways cause I&#39;m just taken my sweet time and getting<br/>\nlvls when I get them and not rushing it.  But if I do make it to 50 by then<br/>\nand I have enough exp to go up a few lvls I wouldn&#39;t wanna see welcome to<br/>\nLvl 53 or higher before I get to play the new pak.<br/>\nOk thats all.<br/>\n<br/>\n***************************<br/>\nAzor Spellbound<br/>\nLvl 21 Human Cleric of The Rathe<br/>\n***************************</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
