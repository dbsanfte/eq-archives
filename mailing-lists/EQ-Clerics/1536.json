I totally agree with hunting scarecrows at<br/>\n14-17. They give great exp. They do hit hard and fast though... team up with<br/>\nan Enchanter and they&#39;re easy pickings (Tashan&#39;s and Languid Pace work<br/>\nwonders). I hunted them with an Enc friend and we never died once. We<br/>\nstarted at 14(me) and 12(him) and left at 16(me) and 15(him). That area of<br/>\nthe W Karanas is pretty safe to med, and the odd wandering critter got<br/>\nkilled by his pet.<br/>\n<br/>\nInterestingly I teamed with a L15 monk one day when the Enchanter wasn&#39;t<br/>\naround... found it _much_ harder. Not nearly as efficient, and the monk was<br/>\ngetting down there in HP.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing about hunting scarecrows... it&#39;s a refreshing change - it<br/>\nmakes you feel like a wizard with melee ability!
