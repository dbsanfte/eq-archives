Right now I have a BloodForge<br/>\n&gt; Hammer, whic does great dmg, but is slow and heavy.  I also find I am<br/>\n&gt; soloing less, so I want a 1H that I can use my SBS with.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My current 1H blunt is a FS Mace, which has 8dmg, and rougly the same dly as<br/>\n&gt; the Screaming Mace.  Its wt is 10.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Other than the magical effects, is there any advantage to buying one? Or<br/>\n&gt; should I save my money?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Brytewing, lvl 16 halfling cleric.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
