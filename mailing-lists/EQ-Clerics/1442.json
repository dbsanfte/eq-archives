I was a<br/>\nparticipant in the slaying of Vox when she dropped this staff.  I was<br/>\nhoping to be offered a chance to acquire it, but understood why it was<br/>\ndeemed that a non cleric character should receive, since clerics could res<br/>\nthemselves.  So far, I only know of one of these staves on The Rathe<br/>\nserver, and Vox has been killed multiple times.  I am sure that more will<br/>\ncome, but how soon before it happens?  An item such as this HARDLY devalues<br/>\nthe cleric, if anything it will show the wielder a true appreciation of the<br/>\npinnacle of our power.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;The effect is 10 charges of RES.

I&#39;ve yet to own an item which could<br/>\nbe recharged (Observer Staff notwithstanding).  Even if the Staff in<br/>\nquestion were rechargeable, I have no evidence to support that it&#39;s not,<br/>\nI&#39;m sure the procedure would be a long and arduous one.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, let me get this straight, because this staff has the ability to cast<br/>\nRessurrection, you believe that clerics are useless and not needed anymore?<br/>\n I&#39;m sorry if you see our class as nothing more than mobile ressurrection<br/>\ncenters, but there are MANY things we do besides cast Ressurrection on<br/>\nfallen comrades, and our non-ressurrection abilities will always be called<br/>\non in combat.<br/>\n<br/>\nI won&#39;t begrudge Verant a wondrous item, that was created with good<br/>\nintentions.  If I do have one qualm it&#39;s that they didn&#39;t make this a<br/>\ncleric only item, because if there is anything I agree with Bann on, it is<br/>\nthat ressurrections should only be allowed access to by Clerics.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Aosinator Lightbringer<br/>\n-Devout follower of Mithaniel Marr on The Rathe<br/>\n-- <br/>\n                               |&#92;      _,,,---,,_      <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:darshan@...\">darshan@...</a>   ZZZzz /,`.-&#39;`&#39;    -.  ;-;;,_   <br/>\n                              |,4-  ) )-,_. ,&#92; (  `&#39;-&#39;  <br/>\n                             &#39;---&#39;&#39;(_/--&#39;  `-&#39;&#92;_)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
