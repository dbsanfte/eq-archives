Last night Fennin Ro had OVER 1950 people <br/>\non that ONE server!!!!!! They need to lock that server down completely and <br/>\npossibly move any level 10 and below character over to another server. <br/>\nPersonally, I don&#39;t think ANY server should have more than 500 people on it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, they need to have more than one zone carry certain &#39;very saught&#39; after <br/>\nitems, such as Rubicite armor. Why does Cazic Thule have to be the only <br/>\nzone? Of COURSE there will be 70-100 people in the zone! Move the Ruby <br/>\naround...put some in Rathe Mountains, make a level 25+ zone on Erudin so <br/>\nRuby can drop there....but not all in one zone. Look at the Journeyman <br/>\nboots. ONE NPC in the entire game has it, its a no drop item, meaning you <br/>\nhave to loot it yourself. Why cant this npc drop it everytime to stop <br/>\novercamping and people from Kill stealing? No, that would make way too much <br/>\nsense, I guess.<br/>\n<br/>\nOver camping and lagging CAN end if some of the ideas that so many have sent <br/>\nin are implemented. But of course, that would cause Verant having to <br/>\nactually DO something...can&#39;t have that.

The other problem is that the server is<br/>\n&gt;overcrowded the begin with.  The main oringinal servers are always over <br/>\n&gt;1500<br/>\n&gt;people in peak hours.  IMHO..  Maybe they should lock full servers up to <br/>\n&gt;new<br/>\n&gt;people.  Make them play the less crowded servers.  Or maybe they will allow<br/>\n&gt;people to move from one server to another server with thier charector.  I<br/>\n&gt;know this will never happen but who know...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Qanin<br/>\n&gt;The Rathe<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: \tAzor[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jmaynus@...\">jmaynus@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sent: \tWednesday, July 07, 1999 8:54 AM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: \tRe: [EQ-Clerics] rez question<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Azor&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jmaynus@...\">jmaynus@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Then I think Verant needs to really do something about all this.  I mean<br/>\n&gt; &gt; if<br/>\n&gt; &gt; places like Unrest and Cazic are gonna be so over crowded that it cause <br/>\n&gt;so<br/>\n&gt; &gt; much lag then maybe they should hurry up and give as that new land mass<br/>\n&gt; &gt; they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; been working on or something.  But of course once we get this on land <br/>\n&gt;mass<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you know it&#39;ll be crowded for a long time, everyone will be dying to go<br/>\n&gt; &gt; see<br/>\n&gt; &gt; what it&#39;s like.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; **************************<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Azor<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Lvl 16 Human Cleric of the Rathe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; **************************<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: Lanadina the Magician &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lanadina@...\">lanadina@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m on Fennin Ro too.....Cazic Thule was horrid last night.
