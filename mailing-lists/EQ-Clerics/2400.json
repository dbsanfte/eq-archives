Don&#39;t get me wrong Verant irriates me more than you know, but in my opinion clerics as far from the ones who should be complaining.  Look at the poor paladins for christ sake, now there&#39;s a class that needs help.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, lets look at the poor, poor paladins.   I feel so bad for the whole holy bunch.. really I do *drips with sarcasm*.    I admit, the paladins got shafted in terms of difficulty.. i.e. needing master smithing, etc.  HOWEVER... it should be noted that many of the best and coolest items in the games are PALADIN only, or at least used by Paladins.   Ghoulbane and Soulfire are but two of these really incredible weapons that can be used ONLY by paladins.  Then, not only does the Paladin armor get better AC (which is perhaps how it should be), but also gets better +wis!!! For the Paladins to get more +wisdom than the clerics, when +wis is the only thing that really matters to clerics is just plain stupid.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Have you all taken the time to notice that our quest armor had stats to it, perhaps that is why the AC is not as high as ruby.(I know the stats suck) but the AC is better than a BS tunic and Gator legs which I have been wearing for over 10 levels.<br/>\nExactly my point.... who cares that the BS Tunic and Gator legs have less AC than the cleric armor... they both have +wisdom.  Also my runed circlet, has +wisdom.  As a result, I cannot get the cleric BP, the cleric lets, or the cleric helm because to do so would take away the asset that is most important to me as a cleric, my wisdom.    I actually have the cleric legs (after about 10 hours of camping UGH) and I plan on giving them to another cleric as soon as I get the chance  to get Gator Skin Leggings because the Leggings have +wisdom and only weigh 0.4...  I wouldn&#39;t have even bothered with the cleric legs if I had looked at the Gator Legs stats first.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, in truth.. I don&#39;t mind having the lower AC.  But I will participate in the sit-in anyway because maybe the show of force will get Verant to change SOMETHING... and if not the AC maybe they will give us the +Wisdom that we need.   I keep on hearing the Paladins complain about how hard their armor is to get, and they are right... it is... but it gets really annoying to hear that incessant complaint when their class gets such good stuff...  I would love to have something equivelant to the soulfire or ghoulbane... (especially if it looked as cool as the soulfire &lt;grins&gt;... a flaming mace?? lol)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, these are just my opinions... of course.<br/>\n<br/>\nEachann Bronzeleaf<br/>\nCleric of Tunare, Tarew Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
