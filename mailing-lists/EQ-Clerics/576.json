I tried it once against the critters<br/>\nin Mistmoore and the result was that a dark sacrificer pet attacked me, i think it was the<br/>\nclosest critter. Is the effect area the same as in Word of Pain? Meaning you have to be<br/>\nvery close to the mobs you want to fear? How often is that spell resisted? At the same<br/>\nrate as the basic Fear spell?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the only use for that spell is when the party is being hammered by multiple creatures<br/>\nand after casting going straigth to zone since the feared critters will bring a whole army of<br/>\nother critters on us.<br/>\n<br/>\nIyenya Goldenheart<br/>\nLvl 27 dwarf cleric<br/>\nInnoruuk server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
