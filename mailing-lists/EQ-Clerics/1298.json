Not that difficult, but time consuming. <br/>\n<br/>\nCleanse does exactly what you described. Random cleaning effect which<br/>\nis nice in places like befallen where there are a ton of DoT spells and<br/>\ndisease from undead.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can get the mace recharged in the store room in Quyenos by someone<br/>\nwhose name sarts with W something(since I am at work i don&#39;t have my<br/>\nnotes :)) <br/>\n<br/>\n20pp? *sigh* Once more back to collecting silver pieces to save enough<br/>\nfor my spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn another note, the delivering the note to the paladin in splitpaw<br/>\nquest, is a great quest for people in their higher teens, since on<br/>\ncompletion you receive a random clerical spell from levels 19, 24, or<br/>\n29. This has saved me a fair amount of money already.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Clerics have a hard time doing the quest?  LOL i am<br/>\n&gt; a human cleric and had <br/>\n&gt; no troule doing said quest, in fact it was one of<br/>\n&gt; the easier ones i have <br/>\n&gt; done.  Now for my question, what exactly does clense<br/>\n&gt; do?  I was under the <br/>\n&gt; impression that it took of negitive effects on the<br/>\n&gt; player, tho it always <br/>\n&gt; seems to clense me when i dont need it, and there<br/>\n&gt; are only 30 charges on it. <br/>\n&gt;   I have no clue how to get it recharged.  I am a<br/>\n&gt; lvl 24 cleric on Xegony, <br/>\n&gt; and am now using a screaming mace which i perfer,<br/>\n&gt; the SSoL was nice, fast, <br/>\n&gt; and consistant in the amount of damg it did, but the<br/>\n&gt; effect was wasted on my <br/>\n&gt; toon as i never seem to get many neg effects on me. <br/>\n&gt; Suffice it to say I <br/>\n&gt; gave my SSoL to a noobie that was begging, LOL he<br/>\n&gt; loved it and i was happy <br/>\n&gt; to help, as far as what it is worth, i have no clue<br/>\n&gt; as i would pay nothing <br/>\n&gt; over 20p for it and thats going above the value to<br/>\n&gt; me.  It&#39;s prob worth alot <br/>\n&gt; to ppl who want them badly and less to others that<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t.   just INHO, stay <br/>\n&gt; safe and have fun<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nBid and sell for free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://auctions.yahoo.com\">http://auctions.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
