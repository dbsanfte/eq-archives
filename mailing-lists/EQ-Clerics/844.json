Since then <br/>\ni have done as asked, but alot of ppl are replying to messages without <br/>\ndeleting the threads, while i understand the reason, NOW, for deleting the <br/>\nthread,i do not understand why others don&#39;t delete as well?  i am a little <br/>\nmiffed about this as it was not asked nicely of me, well maybe i took it <br/>\nwrong, but just the same, if i have to delete the threads then why does <br/>\neveryone else not have to.  Also i was adding color to the message as i <br/>\nthought it looked better and was told not to do that as well!!  oh well i <br/>\nwas just wondering why i was told to do so and since then i have seen many <br/>\nlong messages by others.  err ppl i am not slamming anyone i am just asking <br/>\na general question -- thanx for yer time -- anne *hugs*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
