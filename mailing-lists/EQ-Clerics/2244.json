Like the first time I snuck through Rivervale....what a<br/>\nrush! (actually, there was no sneaking going on, got a SoW and booked to the<br/>\nzone) BUT, as most of you know, the best dungeons in the game are accessed,<br/>\nor close to, EVIL cities (Cazic, Guk, SolA/B, PoF). This has saved me more<br/>\ntimes than I can count now. ie. Cazic Thule: Big train comes and everybody<br/>\nzones to Feerrott...guess what? Bouncer Hurd is on the other side slapping<br/>\ndown every good race that zones and forces them to go back to that nasty<br/>\ntrain of lizzies. But not me, &#39;cause me and Hurd go way back. Heck, I even<br/>\nbuffed and healed him for NOT killing me (j/k) Anyway, there are definate<br/>\nadvantages of being evil at higher levels. From a RP&#39;ing view, I love it. If<br/>\nyou have never played an Evil race, I would suggest giving it a try to see<br/>\nthe opposite side of the coin. Nothing better than running for your life as<br/>\nsoon as you get off the boat in Butcherblock ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nDrizben D&#39;Vorn<br/>\nDefiled High Priest of Innoruuk<br/>\nOblivion Knight of the 29th Circle<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Pamela Bendel &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pyuna@...\">pyuna@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I guess the one thing I&#39;d think about here is not the looks but good <br/>\n&gt; vs evil. I just restarted my DE cleric - and I personally think they <br/>\n&gt; look good in anything but brass &lt;shudder&gt;. DE&#39;s are limited in the <br/>\n&gt; areas that they can go though (or so it seems to me). Seems like the <br/>\n&gt; vast majority of areas I&#39;m KOS. I have to be invised by friends to <br/>\n&gt; travel the majority of the realms. When you first create the char you <br/>\n&gt; are warned that it&#39;s a high difficultly combination. If you want to <br/>\n&gt; travel freely you spend a lot of time killing things to raise your <br/>\n&gt; faction. I sometimes wish I could move about as freely as a goodie - <br/>\n&gt; but oh well - I love my DE.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Pyuna<br/>\n&gt; ~7th Level DE Cleric<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
