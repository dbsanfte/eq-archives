I agree on the patchwork, but smithing isn&#39;t<br/>\ncheap. On established servers it&#39;s usually cheaper to buy banded or skip<br/>\nstraight to bronze, given that the smithing market is becoming so depressed,<br/>\nand places like Unrest get more low-level players in them by the day...<br/>\n<br/>\nElbeno<br/>\n16 times blessed by Karana<br/>\nBristlebane<br/>\n(Just turned master smith, broke, still in patchwork/leather that I had<br/>\nsince level 4 or so :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: AoS/Aosinator &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:darshan@...\">darshan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; For a cleric looking to save some money in the<br/>\n&gt; beginning, i would strongly suggest tailoring as a starting <br/>\n&gt; skill.  You can<br/>\n&gt; armor yeself for relatively little money, and can save the <br/>\n&gt; rest of the cash<br/>\n&gt; for spells.  As you go up in levels, you should definitely work on<br/>\n&gt; smithing, since it&#39;s relatively cheap to increase the skill <br/>\n&gt; to the point<br/>\n&gt; where you can make banded armor with relative reliability.  <br/>\n&gt; Besides, it&#39;s a<br/>\n&gt; helluva lot cheaper than purchasing chain from the store! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
