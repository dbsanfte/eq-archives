No way! Are you going to be extremely weak?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You betcha!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Granted, it was a REALLY nice thing to be able to be resurrected and have <br/>\n&gt; your full mana and HP on your character, and being ready to go after you <br/>\n&gt; loot, but if EQ is about Roleplaying, and about trying to be<br/>\n&gt; semi-realistic <br/>\n&gt; in some cases, ressurect was not broken in the last patch, but instead, it<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; was made to be a little more beleiveable/realistic.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Let the flames begin, just be gentle &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Lanadina<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ======<br/>\n&gt; From: Olli Haapam∩┐╜ki &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:olli.haapamaki@...\">olli.haapamaki@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I just did a revive on myself yesterday and was damn surprised to the <br/>\n&gt; result. Usually<br/>\n&gt; all it does is teleport to corpse and return a little xp. But at that time<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; it did a whole<br/>\n&gt; lot more. And all of them were negative side effects. After resurrection i<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; had all my<br/>\n&gt; mana drained, had only 50% of HP, had some kind of weakness effect on me<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; all this without any addition to the positive effects (xp gain). I feel<br/>\n&gt; this <br/>\n&gt; is a terribly<br/>\n&gt; wrong move by Verant. And besides they did not mention a thing about it in<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; patch message. Why the heck did they do something like this? Do they want<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; ruin the cleric now that it is perfectly balanced?
