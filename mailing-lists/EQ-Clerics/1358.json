I agree wholeheartedly! As Verant scrambles desparately to<br/>\nmake sure no one can &quot;cheat,&quot; (i.e. kiting, resurrect, pottery, box of<br/>\nabu karr, killer necro pets, reduction in buff times and SOW times, life<br/>\ntaps getting resisted, etc. ad nauseum), they lose focus on the fact<br/>\nthat EQ is just a friggin game, and that no one really cares if druids<br/>\ncan kite, or that pottery can be a lucrative skill to learn for those<br/>\nnot willing to spend ungodly amounts of time and money on such noble<br/>\npursuits like smithing. These phenomena are merely the natural<br/>\nprogression of a game that is maturing and becoming more than its<br/>\ncreators could envision. And what&#39;s wrong with that? Verant should take<br/>\na chill pill and quit worrying about whether one or more classes or a<br/>\nstupid item are too powerful. GIVE IT A REST, VERANT!<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery nerf patch that comes along makes me shake my head and sigh with<br/>\npent up frustration. Just thinking about some of the most recent SNAFUs<br/>\nmakes me so mad at how stupid Verant is that I can&#39;t even write any more<br/>\nabout it. But then I think, Hey, it&#39;s a game. And then I calm down and<br/>\nwonder how I could have spent the last 5 months of my life caring so<br/>\nmuch about a game whose goal seems to be to get every player to be in<br/>\nthe unenviable position of having to camp spawn spots or get the hell<br/>\nout and go on with his/her life.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for a great 5 months, Verant. Get a life and let the players play<br/>\nthe damn game.<br/>\n<br/>\nSaidinn Witchwood, RIP<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Curtis Bennett [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:die_kluge@...\">die_kluge@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, September 14, 1999 4:50 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [EQ-Clerics] gaming philosophy <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Curtis Bennett&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:die_kluge@...\">die_kluge@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou know, just an aside, and not related to clerics in any way, but<br/>\nI&#39;ve been a D&D dungeon master for about 10 years, and if I gave a<br/>\nbag of holding (similar to a box of abu&#39;kar) in January and then<br/>\naround March if I told him, &quot;Oh, I made a mistake on that.  Instead of<br/>\nweighing nothing, it nows weighs half of what is inside.&quot; you can bet<br/>\nthat that player would be pretty pissed. It&#39;s no different here.  It<br/>\nonly shows lack of organization on Verant&#39;s part and poor testing.<br/>\nEQ is a great game, but I&#39;ve never seen a company that is just so bad<br/>\nat &quot;getting it&quot;.  Verant just doesn&#39;t &quot;get it&quot;.  They need to focus<br/>\ntheir effort on making new quests and stop screwing with what they<br/>\nalready have.  The more they change things, the more bugs they are<br/>\ngoing to introduce.  Take the testament of venear for example.  It has<br/>\napparently been changed to be equipable, but the quest appears to be<br/>\nbroke now.  Slick trick.<br/>\n  Stabilize the damn game, and then add stuff to it.  So what if that<br/>\nDruid spell was &quot;typo&#39;d&quot; at 39 instead of 49.  Big damn deal.  Just<br/>\nleave it alone.  No one cares about their typos.  It&#39;s friggin game<br/>\nfor christ&#39;s sake.  It&#39;s not like we&#39;re dealing with health care<br/>\nreform here.<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nEnter ONElist&#39;s Friends & Family Program <br/>\nWIN $100 to Amazon.com!
