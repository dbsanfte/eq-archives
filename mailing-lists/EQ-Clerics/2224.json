I would never put my group <br/>\nin perill though. the reason I do it is not to do damage but rather to keep <br/>\nmy defense and dodge skills up. It will really come in handy at hight levels <br/>\nwhen I do a huge heal and they come after me. I just ask my party members to <br/>\nlet it beat on me for a while, then I back off and let them do their work.<br/>\n<br/>\nChrisstauf Healingsoul<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Nope it isnt just you....  I think most clerics from 20 below have some <br/>\n&gt;kind<br/>\n&gt;of feeling that we can melee with the rest.  I knew I had that feeling till<br/>\n&gt;I was level 24 and finally realized that my melee just blows compared to <br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;rest.  Give it some time.  The more experienced clerics about 20+ will heal<br/>\n&gt;and buff instead of melee.  Its just a phase I wouldnt worry about it to<br/>\n&gt;much.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Qanin Skywanderer<br/>\n&gt;The Rathe 27th Circle<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
