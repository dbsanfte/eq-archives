I am L50 now and have never had over <br/>\n     2000p in the bank (only have 500p in there now) and I still wear 2 <br/>\n     pieces of bronze (gloves and cloak).  I think the important thing is <br/>\n     to have fun and do what you like (hates camping and farming items).  <br/>\n     Don&#39;t worry about what others have. If you have good friends and good <br/>\n     groups items will come in time. Besides, what&#39;s to look forward to if <br/>\n     you have everything you need by the time you reach L20?<br/>\n     <br/>\n     Drogo DarkBane<br/>\n     L50 Halfling Cleric<br/>\n     The Rathe</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
