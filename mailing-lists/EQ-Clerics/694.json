Are <br/>\nyou going to have full health? No way! Are you going to be extremely weak? <br/>\nYou betcha!<br/>\n<br/>\nGranted, it was a REALLY nice thing to be able to be resurrected and have <br/>\nyour full mana and HP on your character, and being ready to go after you <br/>\nloot, but if EQ is about Roleplaying, and about trying to be semi-realistic <br/>\nin some cases, ressurect was not broken in the last patch, but instead, it <br/>\nwas made to be a little more beleiveable/realistic.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet the flames begin, just be gentle &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nLanadina<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n======<br/>\nFrom: Olli Haapam∩┐╜ki &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:olli.haapamaki@...\">olli.haapamaki@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI just did a revive on myself yesterday and was damn surprised to the <br/>\nresult. Usually<br/>\nall it does is teleport to corpse and return a little xp. But at that time <br/>\nit did a whole<br/>\nlot more. And all of them were negative side effects. After resurrection i <br/>\nhad all my<br/>\nmana drained, had only 50% of HP, had some kind of weakness effect on me and<br/>\nall this without any addition to the positive effects (xp gain). I feel this <br/>\nis a terribly<br/>\nwrong move by Verant. And besides they did not mention a thing about it in <br/>\nthe<br/>\npatch message. Why the heck did they do something like this? Do they want to<br/>\nruin the cleric now that it is perfectly balanced? That would be awfully <br/>\nstupid.<br/>\n<br/>\nIyenya Goldenheart<br/>\nLvl 30 dwarf cleric<br/>\nInnoruuk server<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can WIN $100 to Amazon.com by starting a new list at ONElist.<br/>\nDrawing is held each week through August 20.
