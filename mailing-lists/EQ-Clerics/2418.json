Naturally, I<br/>\ncan&#39;t say who, but in the interest of preventing a similar fiasco as with<br/>\nthe Monk sit-in, I will confirm that players in Fenin&#39;s Fear Plane were<br/>\nlagged out due to over-loading network resources on the server which houses<br/>\nboth Fear and West Freeport.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe server didn&#39;t crash, the network resources were overloaded, and so<br/>\npeople lagged out, leaving the Fear Plane with a half-linkdead party, which<br/>\ndied, followed by people reconnecting into Fear as a now very lonely, and<br/>\nshortly after very dead, person.<br/>\n<br/>\nFear plane did not crash itself - that would have made the players safe -<br/>\nbecause Fear does not populate for some time after a reboot. Instead, the<br/>\noverload of players on the server caused the tragic and needless deaths of<br/>\npeople who just wanted to enjoy the game, and made their corpse recovery<br/>\neven harsher.<br/>\n<br/>\nClerics and Necromancers, I urge you - find a better way to protest. You are<br/>\ngoing down a path which will, again, bring needless suffering on those who<br/>\nare not participating. Non-violent protest is admirable, but if it causes<br/>\ndeath, its no longer non-violent, is it?<br/>\n-----<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe a sit-in, now that it is known that it causes problems to other<br/>\nplayers, is not a good way to protest. Please invent another form of<br/>\npeaceful protest, for the sake of others!<br/>\n<br/>\n~ Briza X`Ris ~<br/>\n~ Mistress of Innoruuk ~<br/>\n~ Fennin RO ~</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
