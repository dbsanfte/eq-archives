I can guarantee you that if you try to be a &quot;melee&quot; cleric at<br/>\nhigh levels (except in easy fights, that is) you will develop a reputation<br/>\nand have a *VERY* hard time getting into a good group.  Good groups in EQ<br/>\nare the difference between life and death, and are the ability to do things<br/>\nfar beyond your &quot;normal&quot; level.  If you develop a reputation of not<br/>\nutilizing your healing skills to their fullest, you will never been invited<br/>\nto a group for the difficult adventures such as fighting Nagafen, or going<br/>\ninto the Plane of Fear (or any plane, for that matter).  As GZ posted on<br/>\nEQVault the other day, groups *expect* the healers to actually HEAL.  We are<br/>\nnot there to add a measily amount of damage, we are there to<br/>\nheal/med/heal/med/heal/med/buff.  Unfortunately, there are far too many<br/>\nclerics in the land of Norrath that still believe they can be a tank-healer.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is not to say, however, that we cannot melee or use our damage spells.<br/>\nYou just have to learn judicious use of them and balance that with mana<br/>\nusage, downtime, group dynamic and difficulty of the fight.<br/>\n<br/>\nAstur il&#39;Ayan, Cleric of Brell<br/>\nSolusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Salt&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:salt@...\">salt@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So far everyone has said that sticking to casting is the way to go. I must<br/>\n&gt; say, that is the way I&#39;m going to go. I would willingly give up my weapon<br/>\n&gt; for a +9 wis (or so) item. I don&#39;t mind being in a melee, but<br/>\n&gt; with a decent<br/>\n&gt; sized group, I will stay well away from the mobs so I can stick<br/>\n&gt; to what I do<br/>\n&gt; best (and enjoy most).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Having said that, I must point out that it is my choice to do<br/>\n&gt; that. I&#39;m not<br/>\n&gt; doing it because anyone told me to, I do it because it&#39;s how I<br/>\n&gt; like to play.<br/>\n&gt; Part of the reason I enjoy it so much is because I am able to make that<br/>\n&gt; decision. If I had to do it because I wasn&#39;t allowed any choice,<br/>\n&gt; it wouldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; be so appealing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From what you said, it sounds like you really want to go for the<br/>\n&gt; melee stats<br/>\n&gt; over wisdom. I encourage you to do so, for no other reason than<br/>\n&gt; because you<br/>\n&gt; want to. This is *your* character, you should play him the way *you* want.<br/>\n&gt; Make your decision based on what will get you more enjoyment from<br/>\n&gt; the game.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Salt </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
