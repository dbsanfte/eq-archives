And is the parchment (forgot<br/>\n&gt; what it says, some kind of list) part of it?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 2nd question, I just reached 10th level.  Is it a barrier level?  I<br/>\n&gt; haven&#39;t played much at 10th, but seems like xp is slow.  Could be my<br/>\n&gt; perception.  Or do the barrier levels start later?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The Best Place to Buy Movies - Reel.com<br/>\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/reel1\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/reel1</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
