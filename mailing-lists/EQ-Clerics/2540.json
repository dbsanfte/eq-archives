These 2 Ogres had this business going in Cazic doing the <br/>\nvery same thing.  At least one of them was there everyday. They had to have <br/>\nmade tremendous amounts of cash there.  It is very time consuming and takes <br/>\naways from the hunt quite a bit, but it is an easy way to make cash.<br/>\nI also just recently noticed that there is a travelling person in South <br/>\nKarana now, he starts out at the Bridge, announcing to the zone he is there <br/>\nto change their money for them from Copper to silver, gold, etc...  He then <br/>\ntravels to different set locations, Centaurs, aviaks, etc... advertising as <br/>\nhe goes.  I&#39;m not sure how successful he is but seems like it would be <br/>\nprofittable.<br/>\n<br/>\nBree</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
