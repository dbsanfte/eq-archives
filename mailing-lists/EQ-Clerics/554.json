I have found that against npcs FOL is pretty useless, they seem<br/>\nto hit just as much, and it doesnt seem to last very long.  As stated<br/>\nearlier, PvP is where it is really useful....they dont stop their attack,<br/>\nbut you can run away, and they will have no idea where you went...pretty<br/>\ngood if you have to escape, or you just wanna buy a little time.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDank Skunksage<br/>\nthe Rathe<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 11:03 AM 7/16/99 -0700, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Chas Watkins &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cwatkins@...\">cwatkins@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So you FOL but what does it do?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Does the MOB temporarily stop his attack. <br/>\n&gt;In a PvP does the other PC have to stop his attack.
