Even I, a person who originally<br/>\n&gt;came from the temple of Life, needed to raise my faction in order to do the<br/>\n&gt;quest. But to be quite honest, I did the quest simply cause I had never <br/>\n&gt;done<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;a quest before, I tried the weapon out like once to see what the effect was<br/>\n&gt;and it has sat in the bank ever since.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Bree Wyndsdale<br/>\n&gt;47th Cleric of Fennin Ro<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: Jeff Habermann &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jrhabermann@...\">jrhabermann@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;Subject: [EQ-Clerics] Shining Star of Light<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Date: Tue, 21 Sep 1999 10:25:31 -0700<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I keep reading that everyone on here loves to use there SSOL.
