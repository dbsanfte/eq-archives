Umm,<br/>\nrephrased:<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you specialize (at skill lvl 1), do you immediately start seeing<br/>\nmana/casting/recovery time in that spell-type?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m only GUESSING the answer is that when you specialize (even at lvl 1)<br/>\nyour mana goes further.  As you go up in Specialization, your mana (cost per<br/>\nspell in time/mana/recovery) goes even further until you reach 50.  At 51,<br/>\nyour main Specialization continues its mana-costsavings while your other 4<br/>\nSpecializations - while not getting worse - languish behind your main<br/>\nSpecialization.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes that make sense, and am I close to understanding?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Lanadina the Magician &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lanadina@...\">lanadina@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, June 30, 1999 3:04 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] ARGH<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Lanadina the Magician &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lanadina@...\">lanadina@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Dan,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ok...let me try to explain very very simply =)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When you specialize in a skill, that is completely seperate from your<br/>\nnormal<br/>\n&gt; skill, (EX. Alteration). My cleric isnt high enough to specialize, but I<br/>\n&gt; have a level 25 magician who has specialized in both Conjuration and<br/>\n&gt; Evocation. I use Conjuration alot more, so I will let that one go past the<br/>\n&gt; 50 mark. Once the SPECIALIZATION skill goes over 50, that ONE will be the<br/>\n&gt; skill you master at...the other skills that you specialize will be capped<br/>\nat<br/>\n&gt; 50. That does not mean that your actual skill in Conjuration or any other<br/>\n&gt; skill will stop moving up. Look at Specialization as another skill<br/>\nentirely.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Once you are able to specialize (I beleive you have to be level 30 to do<br/>\n&gt; that as a Cleric) you will need to go to your guild trainer, and put ONE<br/>\n&gt; point in whatever skill you want to specialize in. As a cleric, I will<br/>\nwant<br/>\n&gt; to do Alteration, so I use less mana when I heal, cast faster, and with<br/>\nless<br/>\n&gt; interruptions.  Once you have ONE POINT in there, it will go up as you<br/>\nplay<br/>\n&gt; in EQ. You will see when it goes up with a message like, Your<br/>\nspecialization<br/>\n&gt; (Conjuration) has increased! (25) or whatever you have in that skill. By<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; time you are level 30, your skill in Alteration is already going to rock,<br/>\n&gt; (about 150 or so).  So, whatever skills you have, they will keep rising,<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; only thing that will stop rising, is if you specialize in more than one<br/>\n&gt; skill, and one of them has gone over 50 skill. Everything will keep going<br/>\n&gt; up, until you hit 50 in specialize, and the one that went over 50 first,<br/>\n&gt; will keep rising. (Phew, I hope I didnt confuzzle you more)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Specialization Alteration and Alteration are TWO different skills. Both<br/>\nwill<br/>\n&gt; keep going up =)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hope this clarifies it!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lanadina<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Dan Harmon&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:deharmon@...\">deharmon@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I must be missing a very basic piece of information or just suffering<br/>\nfrom<br/>\n&gt; &gt;brain fart.  Assume that I don&#39;t have a clue and am probably talking<br/>\nabout<br/>\n&gt; &gt;something different than what YOU mean.  :)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I&#39;m a lvl 13 cleric.  Abjuration, alteration, evocation are AT LEAST at<br/>\n&gt; &gt;skill lvl 60, and probably divination and conjuration are pretty high as<br/>\n&gt; &gt;well.  How can that be explained?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I haven&#39;t noticed any better casting ability in any of my spells.  How<br/>\ncan<br/>\n&gt; &gt;that be explained?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;If I HAVE specialized, how can I tell which one it is?(they went over 50<br/>\n&gt; &gt;about 3 weeks ago...I don&#39;t have a clue which was first).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;If I HAVEN&#39;T specialized, how do I do it?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;If I HAVEN&#39;T specialized, what happens to the other 2-4 spell classes<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; &gt;have already gone over 50?
