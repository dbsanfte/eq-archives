Pally&#39;s and Sk&#39;s don&#39;t seem to have enough hp to make it <br/>\n&gt;     mana efficent to use without letting them get down to low in health <br/>\n&gt;     which is very risky (one inturrept and they are done).  The main tank <br/>\n&gt;     that I group with is a L50 SK and superior heal can heal just over 2 <br/>\n&gt;     bubs on her.  I agree that CH is extreamly mana efficent when used <br/>\n&gt;     properly but I still think it should have a shorter casting time.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;d have to disagree with this.  I&#39;ve seen 2 pallies that when buffed up,<br/>\nare very hp heavy as well.  Sharak is the first one that comes to mind.  I<br/>\nhaven&#39;t grouped with SK&#39;s too much, so I can&#39;t really comment on that side<br/>\nof the cheal.  ;)  As it stands, I&#39;m happy with the casting duration of<br/>\ncheal, it&#39;s not too long or too short IMHO.  If you know how many hps yer<br/>\ntank has to start with, and you have a general idea how fast their hps are<br/>\ngoing down, it will take a lil work, but you can learn the timing without<br/>\nputting yer tank in danger.<br/>\n     <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;     Last night our SK was buffed with resolution, symbol of pinzam and an <br/>\n&gt;     enchanters runeIII spell.  By the time she got back from pulling the <br/>\n&gt;     king she was down to 2 bubs of health and I started a superior heal as <br/>\n&gt;     soon as she was in range yet he still killed her before the spell went <br/>\n&gt;     off &lt;Drogo mourns over the loss of Sinlar&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Personally, if i can help it, I will start to sheal someone when they are<br/>\ndown a bub and a half (I&#39;m speaking of tanks in the 40+ region).  Since a<br/>\nbub and a half is at least 600 hps for meleers of this level.  There&#39;s<br/>\nreally no difference if you heal them for 600 hps when they are down 700<br/>\nhps or if they are down 1200hps, yer mana will still be used efficiently.<br/>\nIn the scenario you mentioned, there was absolutely nothing you could do.<br/>\nIf you couldn&#39;t even get a sheal off, then it really doesn&#39;t have much to<br/>\ndo with the casting time of cheal.  ;)  Cheal is a weapon, but it&#39;s a<br/>\ndouble edged one (aren&#39;t they all?).  Cast it before it&#39;s going to be more<br/>\nmana efficent that casting 2 sheals, and yer throwing mana out the window.<br/>\nCast it to late... well.. NEVER cast it to late.  ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen dealing with behemoth tanks, on the level of Snaggle Tooth (one of my<br/>\nfavorite tanks to take care of), who has over 3500 hps or something really<br/>\ndisgusting high (=P), a cheal will save you TONS of mana.  A cleric is much<br/>\nbetter prepared and will have much more mana to spare, with a huge tank<br/>\ntanking all the damage.  (Mind you, I said tank, as in singular.  Having<br/>\ndamage spread out on 4 different meleers at the same time is a nightmare).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-Aosinator Lightbringer<br/>\n-Devout follower of Mithaniel Marr on The Rathe<br/>\n<br/>\n                               |&#92;      _,,,---,,_      <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:darshan@...\">darshan@...</a>   ZZZzz /,`.-&#39;`&#39;    -.  ;-;;,_   <br/>\n                              |,4-  ) )-,_. ,&#92; (  `&#39;-&#39;  <br/>\n                             &#39;---&#39;&#39;(_/--&#39;  `-&#39;&#92;_)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
