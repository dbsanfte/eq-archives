You will eventually get<br/>\nto a zone.  This is Dagnor&#39;s cauldron.  The zone is basically only a<br/>\nplace where people go through to get to Unrest.  There are some fairly<br/>\ntough critters here for a 13th level, so be careful.  Go through the<br/>\nlong hallway and go to the water&#39;s edge, and go right.  If you stay<br/>\nnear the water, you&#39;re fairly safe.  Go until you get to around loc<br/>\n-1600 (or maybe positive 1600), and something..  At night, it&#39;s easier<br/>\nto see, since the entrance is lit up.  There is a cave in the wall.<br/>\nGo back up on top of the cliff, and you&#39;ll see it- a big square hole<br/>\nin the wall.  You could go there at 13th, and fight the death beetles<br/>\nthat tend to swarm over everything.  Probably would be good xp for<br/>\nyou, actually.  Just stay out of the house.  First floor is blue and<br/>\ngreen to me at 20, and it only gets tougher from there.<br/>\n<br/>\nErgo Soulhealer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:FalornEQ@...\">FalornEQ@...</a><br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] Unrest is so unrestful!<br/>\n&gt;Date: Tue, 9 Nov 1999 15:38:36 EST<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Where in the hell is Unrest :-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Falorrn<br/>\n&gt;Ignorant level 13 cleric<br/>\n&gt;&lt;&lt; text3.html &gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
