But <br/>\nthe fact of the matter is this. Bannable or not, Kill Stealing and the jerks <br/>\nthat propagate the kill stealers are the problem. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I walk up to an area that has people already hunting, I ask if they <br/>\nwould mind if I joined the rotation. I expect the same courtesy of others. <br/>\nEven if they dont ask, but leave me alone when I engage a foe, this is fine <br/>\nand again I will reciprocate. (Kinda like a silent aggreement) But if someone <br/>\nis BLATENTLY killstealing, I will ask them nicely to stop and again ask if <br/>\nthey would like to join my group or join the rotation. If they continue to <br/>\nkillsteal, my prostestations will increase in response.

I will not give in. I know others will say that * I * <br/>\nam the one with the problem. Maybe so.. but if giving and asking for common <br/>\ncourtesy and recieving instead malicious killstealing and smug, &quot;you can&#39;t <br/>\ntouch me so live with it&quot; attitudes while simply tucking my tail and letting <br/>\nthe bully have his way is the right thing to do.. then I guess I&#39;ll be banned.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would rather be banned than be bullied by children and social miscreants. <br/>\nI&#39;ll take my chances with the GM&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nFight fire with fire.<br/>\n<br/>\nGrannus</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
