This is a forum for us to help each other, and for us to <br/>\ndebate issues.  I like having issues that I want to respond to(gives me <br/>\nsomething to do while downtimes at work), shhhh, don&#39;t tell my boss.  I like <br/>\na good debate, it is healthy.

It is a matter of principle in my opinion and what kind of standards<br/>\n&gt;you have. I would not refuse a gift, but I am not twinked either, I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;get items that I couldn&#39;t myself get...I gave up my manastone once so My<br/>\n&gt;husband could trade for a E blade, they are things that you do for those <br/>\n&gt;you<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;care about.   SO don&#39;t use gifts  in this discussion, would you in RL call <br/>\n&gt;a<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;person who recieved a christmas present  a beggar or someone who didn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt;work<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;for a living, no I don&#39;t think so.<br/>\n&gt;I buff people out of the kindness of my heart, I don&#39;t get many beggars for<br/>\n&gt;buffs cause half of them have no clue what level I am and what buffs I <br/>\n&gt;have.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;And if for some reason I needed a SoW, then I would pay for it, unless the<br/>\n&gt;kind soul refused the money I was offering. Many times someone will ask me<br/>\n&gt;for a res and that they will pay me, I res them then refuse the payment,<br/>\n&gt;just how I am. I expect to be asked for resurrections, I am a cleric, thats<br/>\n&gt;my job, and if it is within my reach to do it at the time they are asking <br/>\n&gt;me<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I usually will. Its those people who say &quot; Can a lvl 49+ cleric res me<br/>\n&gt;please&quot; that irritate me, you want help but only if it is a certain lvl of<br/>\n&gt;help,  and to coin a phrase &quot;beggars can&#39;t be choosers&quot; no pun intended of<br/>\n&gt;course, but if you want a res that bad, you should take what you can get <br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;not be so picky.<br/>\n&gt;Bree<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: Chris Wheeler &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wheelech@...\">wheelech@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;To: &quot;&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&#39;&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Subject: RE: [EQ-Clerics] What do you think of begging (not the skill)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Date: Thu, 9 Sep 1999 13:13:26 -0400<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: Chris Wheeler &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wheelech@...\">wheelech@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I suppose that is your opinion.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;However, you did say you received a screaming mace from your husband.  <br/>\n&gt;That<br/>\n&gt; &gt;doesn&#39;t sound like something you earned or bought.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I&#39;m with you on the camping issue.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Despising a beggar is certainly a fair reaction. In fact, the trade skill<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&#39;begging&#39; rarely results in success.  I agree that beggars can be <br/>\n&gt;annoying.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;But aren&#39;t they in real life?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;And, how do you classify someone who asks for a buff?  As a beggar?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Sheesh.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;May as well not ask for anything in the game.  I constantly ask for SOW.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;And do so in an RP&#39;ing context.  I&#39;m not one of those types who shouts <br/>\n&gt;&#39;Who<br/>\n&gt; &gt;can give me SOW&#39;.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Yes, I have begged.  And in all my travels, I have never asked out right<br/>\n&gt; &gt;for<br/>\n&gt; &gt;anything.  I have roleplayed a down on his luck cleric.  I have also <br/>\n&gt;worked<br/>\n&gt; &gt;very hard to get the 52pp I have in the bank.  That was earned 10% <br/>\n&gt;begging,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;60% trading up armour and selling to players, and 30% loot selling.  If,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;after hearing my story, people are inclined to donate, so be it.  I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;consider<br/>\n&gt; &gt;that begging.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Now, for those who feel it is laziness, well, thats your opinion as well.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;for one don&#39;t think RP&#39;ing for 3 hours straight, just to earn a few plat <br/>\n&gt;is<br/>\n&gt; &gt;lazy.  Its pretty bloody time intensive and not very rewarding.  Its the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;RP&#39;ing interaction, and the bit of realism I add to the world that I <br/>\n&gt;enjoy.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;And, I also give to beggars.

I believe they stem from me having<br/>\n&gt; &gt;started playing way back when the game was first released.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I despise Beggars....I have always been a helpful person, but the biggest<br/>\n&gt; &gt;mistake you can make with me is to beg.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I started out in this game with nothing just like the rest of you, Some<br/>\n&gt; &gt;people call me bitter, which is not the case, i am a very happy player, i<br/>\n&gt; &gt;enjoy this game quite a bit, but I have a sense of value for items, I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;EARN(not by Buying or begging) ALL of my equipment, I have never asked<br/>\n&gt; &gt;anyone for anything and never will. I wore Patchwork, yes patchwork <br/>\n&gt;leather<br/>\n&gt; &gt;until I was lvl 20, yes 20, I remember having only 6gp and I bought a PW<br/>\n&gt; &gt;tunic for 4, dropped the tunic and was SOL.  I was never able to buy all <br/>\n&gt;my<br/>\n&gt; &gt;spells at early levels right when I was able to use them, i had to buy a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;few<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;at a time, I used a hammer of wrath until I was lvl 20 and my husband had<br/>\n&gt; &gt;given me a screaming Mace which I used up til I was high enough level to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;kill the savant and get a black enamelled one.  I Appreciate all the <br/>\n&gt;items<br/>\n&gt; &gt;that I have, I don&#39;t get items that I cannot use, I don&#39;t overcamp places<br/>\n&gt; &gt;to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;get mega quantities of items.  I don&#39;t buy items, money means nothing in<br/>\n&gt; &gt;this game. There is nothing I hate more than to have a group with one<br/>\n&gt; &gt;caster<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;who already has a SMR camping the Arch Magi.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I am begged on a daily basis and when Someone begs from me, they are damn<br/>\n&gt; &gt;well not gonna get a copper from me. I am a generous person, I buff <br/>\n&gt;people<br/>\n&gt; &gt;all the time and have given away many items that I have gotten <br/>\n&gt;replacements<br/>\n&gt; &gt;for. i.e. I gave a black iron medallion to a low lvl druid I met in<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Rivervale one day, we just chatted and he never asked for anything, I <br/>\n&gt;gave<br/>\n&gt; &gt;it to him out of the kindness of my heart.  I guess basically i feel I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;worked my butt off to get what I have and if you are begging from people<br/>\n&gt; &gt;you<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;are not even trying to get things for yourself, makes me very ill.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Enough of my rant.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Can&#39;t wait to hear feedbacks on this one.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Bree Wyndsdale<br/>\n&gt; &gt;46th Cleric of Fennin Ro<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;From: Chris Wheeler &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wheelech@...\">wheelech@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;To: &quot;&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&#39;&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Subject: [EQ-Clerics] What do you think of begging (not the skill)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Date: Thu, 9 Sep 1999 12:24:38 -0400<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;From: Chris Wheeler &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wheelech@...\">wheelech@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Hi all.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;I gave seen this debate before in other places.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;What do you all think of begging as a method of acquiring<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;cash/armour/weapons?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;I don&#39;t mean the skill of begging, but I mean approaching other PC&#39;s <br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;asking them to spare a bit?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Now, I am for it.  I beleive that RP&#39;ing worlds parallel the real <br/>\n&gt;world,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;inthe real world, there are those who are poor, and need to beg for <br/>\n&gt;thier<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;sustenance.  At the lower levels, I gained most of my armour and my <br/>\n&gt;money<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;from begging.  Now I do it in a RP&#39;ing context, and not as &#39;Hey, got <br/>\n&gt;any<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;free armour I can have?&#39;.  I think that this is a valid strategy.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;As well, now that I am entering the teens, I don&#39;t need to beg as <br/>\n&gt;often.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;But I do barter with players, and when doing so, I subtly make them<br/>\n&gt; &gt;beleive<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;that I am a poor cleric (which I really am). In doing so, I have made<br/>\n&gt; &gt;some<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;great deals, and am able to get some good bargains on armour.  Last <br/>\n&gt;nite,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;for instance, I bought a bloodforge hammer for 15 pp, and a FS staff.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;what I could see, they usually went for around 30 pp.  In my opionion,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;its<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;no different than trading in ussed car and dressing down and making the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;saleperson beleive you are poorer than you really are.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Any other thoughts?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor <br/>\n&gt;----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Show your ONElist SPIRIT!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/tshirt2\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/tshirt2</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;With a new ONElist SHIRT available through our website.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Congratulations to MSers_Online.
