I used the Hammer of Wrath up til 21 when i switched to the crook.  I might&#39;ve used a screaming mace, but I would have had to buy it because Crushbone orcs lower faction with Neriak guards.  The Hammer of Striking is horrible for the level we get it at IMHO.  It is damage 6 and delay 28 or 29 i believe.  This is BARELY better than the 6 dmg and 32 delay of hammer of Wrath.  I&#39;ve heard of 2 good 1h blunt weapons.  One is the enamled black mace which is found in lower guk and I forgot the stats.  Another is the sceptre of rahotep (which a level 50 cleric on Rathe uses).  THe stats can be found on www.gameznet.com/eq/ and under equipment.  Oh yeah, the observers staff is an awsome 1h also, 12 dmg 35 delay, also has some attributes and casts sentinel.  Its a level 30 quest tho.<br/>\nAllsar Olath`Vlos - 23rd circle cleric - The Rathe<br/>\n    -----Original Message-----<br/>\n    From: LevonQeri &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:baghramian@...\">baghramian@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n    To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n    Date: Friday, June 25, 1999 2:14 PM<br/>\n    Subject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] Level and Weapon Used.<br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n    Hail brothers and sisters.<br/>\n    I&#39;m  lvl 23 now and friends got me Glowing Crook staff, from LockJaw in Oasis (spawns ever 1 hour or so, also gives the Lockjaw vest ). My weapon is really good now compared what I had before. This staff is 2h blunt, 11dmg, 35del and weighs 8.5lb. Not to mention it IS magical. So no need to conjure a second weapon for magic mobs.<br/>\n    My previous 1hb weapon was Morning star, bought from a NPC in Qeyons and I used both Runed Totem Staff and Fine Steel Great Staff ( FSGS is 36del 8.5lb but NOT magical, RTS is 37del 11lb, +5hp, +5mana and magical).<br/>\n    I recommend that everyone of us develop both 1h blunt and 2h blunt skills. I don&#39;t know exactly what&#39;s the best 1h blunt weapon but I&#39;ve heard Screaming Mace is one of them and I&#39;m waiting to get to lvl 24 and see what kind of weapon is &quot;Hammer of Striking&quot;.<br/>\n    I hope this helps.<br/>\n    <br/>\n    Levo<br/>\n    Bertox.<br/>\n    <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">         ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n        From: Kris Becan <br/>\n        To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq-clerics@onelist.com\">eq-clerics@onelist.com</a> <br/>\n        Sent: Friday, June 25, 1999 11:49 AM<br/>\n        Subject: [EQ-Clerics] Level and Weapon Used.<br/>\n        <br/>\n        <br/>\n        I&#39;m just wondering what everyone is using for a weapon at what levels?
