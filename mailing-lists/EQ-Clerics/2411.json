Personally, I am too impatient to camp for<br/>\nitems, even if it it only takes an hour.  So if your protest helps in that<br/>\nregard, I am sure it will benfit me as well.  My approach is to just play<br/>\nthe game, amass experience and wealth, and hope that I can buy what I need.<br/>\nMind you , I&#39;m only 16th level now, so in the future, I may need to camp for<br/>\nstuff.  But so far, I have not camped for a single thing, I am happy with<br/>\nwhat my character can and can&#39;t do, and have no complaints about world<br/>\ncalled Norrath. The only complaints I have I can live with, and they mostly<br/>\nhave to do with the UI of the game and with GM conduct.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Jeff Portwine [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jdport@...\">jdport@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: 1999/11/30 11:43 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] Cleric Sit-in<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Jeff Portwine&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jdport@...\">jdport@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAye, but looking at it from your perspective you could consider that if the<br/>\nsit-in is successful, it&#39;s possible that the 8 hour camps could be reduced<br/>\nwhich would give you LESS time to sit around on purpose (camping for<br/>\nitems)...  =)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt all depends on how you look at it...<br/>\n<br/>\nEachann Bronzeleaf<br/>\nCleric of Tunare, Tarew Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: Chris Wheeler &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wheelech@...\">wheelech@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, November 30, 1999 11:39 AM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [EQ-Clerics] Cleric Sit-in<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Chris Wheeler &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wheelech@...\">wheelech@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well, I&#39;m taking this sit in from a different perspective.  I only get a<br/>\nfew<br/>\n&gt; hours of play time a week, and I think that I&#39;d rather use it playing the<br/>\n&gt; game as opposed to sitting around.  I do enough sitting around, what with<br/>\n&gt; trying to find a group and all to play in.
