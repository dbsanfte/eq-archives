I have NEVER been ripped<br/>\noff. On rare occasions, I know of people who have been. Ebay has ways of handling<br/>\nthese things. The chance of being ripped off on Ebay seems to be higher<br/>\nin certain categories than others, though (beanie babies, furbies, I know<br/>\nfor sure)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have also sold on Ebay. It is not ebay&#39;s fault that people are dishonest.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) I believe Verant officially frowns on this practice. But there is<br/>\nnot a lo they can do to stop it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSarah heacock<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thu, 29 Jul 1999, Patrick Myers wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Patrick Myers&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chrisstauf@...\">chrisstauf@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Has anybody seen what you can buy for Everquest on Ebay...if you want a <br/>\n&gt; laugh go to www.ebay.com in the search box type everquest *** where *** is <br/>\n&gt; your server name..ex &quot;everquest karana&quot;.
