There were about a dozen<br/>\npeople in Unrest.  There are a few guilds, but none all that large.<br/>\nI have a guild called &quot;Hand of Tunare&quot; that has 10 members.  The<br/>\npeople are all friendly and helpful.<br/>\nPros:<br/>\nI&#39;ve never had anyone kill-steal anything I was fighting.<br/>\nCamping is not nearly as difficult, since there is not as much<br/>\ncompetition for the stuff.<br/>\nSeveral zones are usually always empty.  Splitpaw, Runnyeye, Befallen.<br/>\nPeople are very friendly and helpful.  The other night, in North<br/>\nFreeport, a 45th level fighter gave me (yes, gave) a black enameled<br/>\nmace!<br/>\nWe get all the new patches first.<br/>\nCons:<br/>\nNo GM support.  Which is almost a pro, since it encourages more<br/>\nteam-work.  If your body is in a hard to reach spot, you have to get<br/>\nfriends together to get it.  The GM support isn&#39;t non-existent, but<br/>\nvery rare, at least.<br/>\nNot very many people.  At higher levels, it may be difficult to get<br/>\na group together.  Sometimes it&#39;s difficult to get binds in towns.<br/>\nHow you gonna get a bind when you&#39;re the only one in Rivervale?<br/>\nTest goes down; sometimes often, and sometimes in the worst places.<br/>\nI died 3 times one night in Befallen when the server went down while<br/>\nI was in the middle of the second level.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Test Server has a special executable, found in the everquest<br/>\ndirectory.  When it loads, there is only one server choice - test<br/>\nserver.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you decide to come to test server, look me up.  I got a bronze<br/>\nmace in Unrest last night that I&#39;ll give you.<br/>\n<br/>\nErgo Soulhealer<br/>\n20th level high elf Cleric of Tunare<br/>\nguildmaster, Hand of Tunare<br/>\nMay Tunare bless and keep you.<br/>\ntest server<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: EvertorN &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:evertorn@...\">evertorn@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: [EQ-Clerics] An odd Cleric Question<br/>\n&gt;Date: Tue, 09 Nov 1999 06:15:29 -0700<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hi all.  I decided this would be a good place to put this, since everyone <br/>\n&gt;has<br/>\n&gt;good input on our class, while others refuse to help one another, I dunno.<br/>\n&gt;Basically I currently play on veeshan server, and for months have been fed <br/>\n&gt;up<br/>\n&gt;with it.  Now I&#39;ve heard other ppl say (and could be rumors) that there is <br/>\n&gt;less<br/>\n&gt;ks&#39;ing on other servers, as well as not a dominate god guild like foh on <br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;server.  (to Those of you possibly in FOH on this list, no offense, the <br/>\n&gt;group of<br/>\n&gt;friends I play with (UWS) as well as I have had bad run ins with your <br/>\n&gt;guild.<br/>\n&gt;Basically FoH and UWS has gone there...let&#39;s not do it again in here)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So basically my question to you is the server you play on how do you like <br/>\n&gt;it?<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m seriously considereing abandoning all my characters on Veeshan to play <br/>\n&gt;on a<br/>\n&gt;better server.  This game is all about the playability in the environment, <br/>\n&gt;which<br/>\n&gt;veeshan seriously limits those not powerhungry play the game.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Evertorn Soul<br/>\n&gt;Level 20 Erudite Cleric on Veeshan<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&lt;&lt; text3.html &gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
