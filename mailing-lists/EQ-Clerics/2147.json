You CAN go there at level 13 with a group and kill yard trash <br/>\n&gt;for pretty good xp, but the trains there are really nasty.  I didn&#39;t really <br/>\n&gt;do all that well in unrest until around level 24 when I got greater healing <br/>\n&gt;and dismiss undead.  At that point, I was able to camp a room inside the <br/>\n&gt;house with relative ease.  It&#39;s a great zone for loot as well as xp because <br/>\n&gt;most all of the monsters above the yard trash carry fine steel weapons, and <br/>\n&gt;a few have small bronze armor pieces.   This zone is especially good for us <br/>\n&gt;clerics since about 90% of the monsters there are undead.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Eachann Bronzeleaf,<br/>\n&gt;Cleric of Tunare, Tarrew Marr<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt;From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:FalornEQ@...\">FalornEQ@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sent: Tuesday, November 09, 1999 3:38 PM<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] Unrest is so unrestful!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:FalornEQ@...\">FalornEQ@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Where in the hell is Unrest :-)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Falorrn<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Ignorant level 13 cleric<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&lt;&lt; text3.html &gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
