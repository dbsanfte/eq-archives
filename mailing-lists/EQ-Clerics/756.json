This","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1810997936\">Please forgive, for I am new to this list, but here is my problem and <br/>\nsuggestion for Verant:<br/>\n<br/>\nMy number one problem with the game is kill stealing. This frustrates me to <br/>\nno end.  I can&#39;t begin to tell you how long I have been trying for a Shiny <br/>\nBrass Shield in Crushbone and how many kills have been stolen from me from <br/>\nsome mage hiding in a tree.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the problem is how Verant determines who gets the kill. As I <br/>\nunderstand it, the single person that inflicts the most damage is awarded <br/>\nthe kill.  This means that it does not matter if you are grouped and your <br/>\ngroup does more damage than the spell caster.  Does this seem crazy to <br/>\nanyone else.  It should work that the groups damage counts as one. I believe <br/>\nthat this would cut down on the amount of kills that are stolen.  It seems <br/>\nlike an easy fix and it makes logical sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is everyone else&#39;s opinion, and has anybody heard of Verant commenting <br/>\non this issue?<br/>\n<br/>\nChrisstauf..of the Lightbringers guild<br/>\nCleric of the 14th circle<br/>\nKarana server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
