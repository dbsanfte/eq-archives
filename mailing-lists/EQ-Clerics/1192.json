I beleive that RP&#39;ing worlds parallel the real world, and<br/>\ninthe real world, there are those who are poor, and need to beg for thier<br/>\nsustenance.  At the lower levels, I gained most of my armour and my money<br/>\nfrom begging.  Now I do it in a RP&#39;ing context, and not as &#39;Hey, got any<br/>\nfree armour I can have?&#39;.  I think that this is a valid strategy.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs well, now that I am entering the teens, I don&#39;t need to beg as often.<br/>\nBut I do barter with players, and when doing so, I subtly make them beleive<br/>\nthat I am a poor cleric (which I really am). In doing so, I have made some<br/>\ngreat deals, and am able to get some good bargains on armour.  Last nite,<br/>\nfor instance, I bought a bloodforge hammer for 15 pp, and a FS staff.  From<br/>\nwhat I could see, they usually went for around 30 pp.  In my opionion, its<br/>\nno different than trading in ussed car and dressing down and making the<br/>\nsaleperson beleive you are poorer than you really are.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny other thoughts?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
