Like getting armor, I was lvl 3-4 and already had kinda nice armor,<br/>\nmaybe it was cause it didn&#39;t cost much and the fact you get money very easy.<br/>\nBut getting lvls might be easy but from what I&#39;ve read there is no lvl cap<br/>\nat all so you can get as many lvls as you like (I like that in an RPG), same<br/>\ngoes for your skills.  I haven&#39;t really messed with the spell system yet but<br/>\nI do know if ppl would report bugs, and ideas on how to make AC better<br/>\ninstade of &quot;I played it a few time and it wasn&#39;t good so I quit playing, EQ<br/>\nis for me&quot; then maybe AC will be better.<br/>\nPpl did that with EQ, I remember in Phase 3 and 4 I read post after post<br/>\nwhere ppl were saying &quot;This game has to many bugs in, I&#39;m never playing this<br/>\nthing again&quot;.  Maybe if more ppl would&#39;ve reported buys and their ideas on<br/>\nhow to make EQ better we&#39;d have even a better EQ to play, but instade they<br/>\nleft to never play again.<br/>\nAnother thing about Asheron&#39;s Call is the fact I think ppl are trying to<br/>\ncompare it to EQ too much.  Can&#39;t do that cause AC is not EQ and I doubt the<br/>\ncompany wants it to be.  Ppl are saying AC is just another UO, wrong.  I&#39;ve<br/>\nplayed UO and it totally sucked but I really enjoy AC, I don&#39;t see where ppl<br/>\nget the idea AC is like UO.  Yes they need to add banks in the game, maybe<br/>\nwork on the spell system and a few other things, but instade of ppl leaving<br/>\nit maybe they should try telling them their ideas on how to make AC better<br/>\nand then maybe they&#39;ll like the game.<br/>\n<br/>\n**************************<br/>\nAzor<br/>\nLvl 18 Human Cleric of the Rathe<br/>\n**************************<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Rob Berryhill&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:racefan@...\">racefan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m glad you liked it.

Both are good games, everyone whined about how EQ&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; interface and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; all that, AC&#39;s seems to be better yet I&#39;ve read in a few places ppl are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; saying it&#39;s worse.  I don&#39;t find AC hard to play at all, it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; easy to learn,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have pretty good graphics, gameplay is easy and I think AC feels<br/>\n&gt; &gt; more like a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; real RPG then EQ does on how they handle skills and all that.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; **************************<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Azor<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Lvl 18 Human Cleric of the Rathe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; **************************<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: Paul Heenan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pheenan@...\">pheenan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Aye, you are correct there.
