That&#39;s the critter<br/>\nthat will spawn in his place if he doesn&#39;t. The problem, he told me, is that<br/>\nwhen it spawns, it wanders around and then down to the 3rd level.  AND it&#39;s<br/>\nnot named, he said, so you don&#39;t know what to look for if you weren&#39;t there<br/>\nto see it spawn.   Your timing has to be good.  If the placeholder has<br/>\nspawned and made it down to third floor, and you don&#39;t know it when you show<br/>\nup to camp him,  then he&#39;s not gonna spawn til someone kills it.  He said it<br/>\ndidn&#39;t take him long to get the ring from Gynok because he kept killing the<br/>\nplaceholder when it spawned and pretty quickly Gynok would spawn.<br/>\n<br/>\nMik</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
