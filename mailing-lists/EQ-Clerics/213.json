I&#39;m new to this mail group but thought I would put in my 2cents here. I<br/>\n&gt; am a level 10 High Elf Cleric on the Rodcet Nife server. I regularly group<br/>\n&gt; with a Paladin and a Wizard. They know better than to tell me that my only<br/>\n&gt; job is to sit back and heal. I jump right in with them and watch their<br/>\n&gt; health rather intently. If I see that they need my services, I back out,<br/>\n&gt; heal them and then get right back in. I don&#39;t tank as the Paladin enjoys<br/>\n&gt; doing that herself. I will often times use that little strike spell to get<br/>\n&gt; the targets attention. My attack isn&#39;t all that great but at least I feel I<br/>\n&gt; contribute more than just an occasional healing spell or buff to the group.<br/>\n&gt; No one has complained yet.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Zoya<br/>\n&gt; 10th level<br/>\n&gt;  HE Cleric<br/>\n&gt;  Rodcet Nife<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Squires, Dean&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:DeanSquires@...\">DeanSquires@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;To: &quot;&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&#39;&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Subject: [EQ-Clerics] Cleric Brawlers<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Date: Mon, Jun 28, 1999, 10:21 AM<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Squires, Dean&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:DeanSquires@...\">DeanSquires@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Just wanted to open a discussion on Clerics who love to fight.  I am<br/>\n&gt; &gt;happy being a cleric, but I cannot resist jumping into the heat of a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;battle and kicking some back.  I also like to occassionally tank.  I try<br/>\n&gt; &gt;to save all my mana for healing, but sometimes I just love to blast<br/>\n&gt; &gt;away.  This is probably because I feel useless when grouped as my<br/>\n&gt; &gt;regular attack doesn&#39;t compare to others in the group.  Anyone else feel<br/>\n&gt; &gt;this way?
