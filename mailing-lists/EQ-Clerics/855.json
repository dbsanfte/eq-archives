I must of misunderstood LORE<br/>\nitems. I know you can have only one but I thought that made them no drop no<br/>\ntrade. Can anyone please explain why an item, other than the newbie stuff<br/>\nand our summoned hammers might be No Drop. Or if they know of one.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks <br/>\n<br/>\nChas<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; With the introduction of LORE items. That is the No drop/No trade items.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Lore items aren&#39;t necessarily no drop/no trade.  My Mistmoore shield is<br/>\na Lore item that I routinely bank, loan to my bard friend, etc.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for when loot can be taken.  Yes, lore items can be taken; no, nodrop<br/>\nitems cannot be taken.  And items can only be taken in a PvP venue; in a<br/>\nduel, there&#39;s no looting.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
