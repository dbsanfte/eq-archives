Am I <br/>\nunder the correct assumption that they nerfed our buffs??  I am told that <br/>\nthey do not last nearly as long as they used to. This Whole new patch from <br/>\nmy understanding is the icing on the cake for Verant, they really get first <br/>\nprize for F@#$ing the game up.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of the High level clerics who have ever hunted in Sol B or L Guk, or <br/>\nhave helped a Paladin friend kill Sir Lucan, knows what its like buffing to <br/>\nprepare for these events.  ok so now our buffs don&#39;t last half as long as <br/>\nthey did and if you don&#39;t have a manastone or an enchanter, that leaves us <br/>\npretty much screwed. the time it takes to regain mana after buffing, you <br/>\nwill have to start buffing over again. Verant does everything they possibly <br/>\ncan to screw with each class and the success people have in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel extremely sorry for the druids and the necromancers of the game, i <br/>\nknow everyone has their own opinions about kiting, but lets face it, this is <br/>\nwhat these classes do, now they have screwed up DOTs, they have made SoW <br/>\nonly last like 10 minutes instead of about 25,I bet they f$%^ed up snare as <br/>\nwell, and they nerfed all the pets.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk and the KING of all Verants high and mighty decisions. LETS NOT FIX A <br/>\nPROBLEM LETS JUST MAKE SOMETHING ELSE WORSE. Point in case, The Box of <br/>\nAbu&#39;kar 100% weight reduction, Verants code F&#39;d up and lvl 6 mobs were <br/>\ndropping them in Butcherblock or something similiar, SO the almighty Verant <br/>\ninstead of Fixing the damn goblins went and Changed the Box. Beware if you <br/>\nare a meleeist with a variety of weapons when you log into the Game you will <br/>\nbe encumbered.   I think it was quite nice of them to change the box from <br/>\n100% to a measly 10%. SO hence don&#39;t fix the problem just screw everyone <br/>\nover.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;braces herself for a rippin&gt;<br/>\nLet the Flames begin,<br/>\nBree Wyndsdale<br/>\n46th nerfed cleric of Fennin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
