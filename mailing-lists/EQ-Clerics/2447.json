Although there is no way","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-462745556\">If you can manage a couple hundred pp for the, you might try for the<br/>\nCaduceus of the Sacrament, a quest from the Temple of Solusek Ro. Although<br/>\nthere is no way you can do this quest solo at your level, you could manage<br/>\nit based on the good will of others, which I will outline below. This weapon<br/>\nhas no WIS bonus, but is just a great 1HB melee weapon, 12/32.<br/>\n<br/>\nWeapon info:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/caduceusofscarament.html\">http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/caduceusofscarament.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;spoiler&gt; Quest info:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.gameznet.com/eq/quest/cadeceusofsacrament.html\">http://www.gameznet.com/eq/quest/cadeceusofsacrament.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nOne hard part at 16th level might be getting the money. If you can&#39;t get it<br/>\nthen, by level 19 you should be ready to fight with a nice full group in<br/>\nSolusek A. There you&#39;ll get good experience and your share of fine steel<br/>\nweapons as well as straight platinum. The weapons you can sell for several<br/>\npp ea.<br/>\n<br/>\nSveltina, Level 45 cleric of Tunare, Xegony<br/>\n<br/>\nok, I&#39;d written my own with how I thought a lower level cleric could get the<br/>\npieces.<br/>\n&lt;spoiler follows&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe icon of the sacrament is in Mistmoore, behind the middle of the three<br/>\ndoors in the &quot;bugged&quot; room behind the hidden wall at the back of the<br/>\ngraveyard. It is an on the ground spawn. There are three doors on one side<br/>\nof this room, with a fake door on the other. Opening the fake door actually<br/>\nopens the three doors as well, behind which are tiny alcoves each containing<br/>\nsome unpleasant bad guy. Go in the middle one to get the icon. To do this<br/>\nyou will need to have invisibility cast on you, I think it helps if it is by<br/>\nsomebody in their 30s. Look at a map of MM, and better yet get a friendly<br/>\nperson to help you go back and get it. It is an 8 hour spawn I think, so<br/>\nideally you&#39;d know it was there before venturing. Because of the many trains<br/>\nin MM, there are always hurt people coming out, and healing some of them<br/>\nshould generate enough good will to get some assistance. You can also buy<br/>\ninvisibility potions for 10pp to 13pp in a couple places (like Rivervale).<br/>\nThat&#39;s awfully expensive, especially at 16th. I got somebody to invis me and<br/>\nwent in and grabbed it. I also recommend spirit of the wolf in case it wears<br/>\noff, and divine aura all ready to go. SOW and divine aura can save a<br/>\nMistmoore gone terribly wrong, but the hope is to fight nothing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe ingot of the sacrament is in Rathe Mtns. A darker shade of giant<br/>\nskeleton (high 20s) spawns there occasionally. Often there are people<br/>\nhunting there, and if they don&#39;t need it they may let you loot it,<br/>\nespecially if you warn them that this no drop item is coming and you need it<br/>\nfor a quest. Happily, much lower undead also spawn at those ruins. For some<br/>\noccassionally touch up healing you may be able to get higher people to pull<br/>\nthem one at a time, which should be good hunting for you or your group.<br/>\nActually, they may just pull them and let you have them as they need to<br/>\n&quot;prune out the greenies&quot; to get the stuff they want to spawn, but not want<br/>\nto spend their resources killing them all.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you can get the enchanter that does the enchanted bars for you to buy<br/>\nthem as well, they are almost certain to have a much higher charisma than<br/>\nyou, so even if they skim a few plat that way, it&#39;s likely to be cheaper.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Chris Wheeler &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wheelech@...\">wheelech@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, December 06, 1999 12:41 PM<br/>\nSubject: [EQ-Clerics] Screaming Mace Question<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Chris Wheeler &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wheelech@...\">wheelech@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am considering buying a Screaming Mace.
