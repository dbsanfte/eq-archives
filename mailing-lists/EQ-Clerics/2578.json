I&#39;m at level 50, and Holy Might still hits for 60 pts max and<br/>\nForce for 90 and Sound of Force for 220.  Now, some spells and bard songs<br/>\nare designed to go up one- two pts of dmg as you level after getting the<br/>\noriginal spell/song, but they do not go up ad infinitum.  For instance, a<br/>\nbard&#39;s song Brusco&#39;s Boastful Bellow does 1 - 2 pts more damage each time<br/>\nyou level after initially getting it. Same with some of the druids dd spells<br/>\nas well.  But none of these spells damage done is dependent on what your<br/>\nwisdom is, although your chance for success or failure  in casting does<br/>\ndepend on your skill in channeling and some say dexterity as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, the critter you are casting on has a lot to do with how much damage<br/>\nyou will inflict.  A high red will resist most all the time.  The closer to<br/>\nyour level the critter cons the better your chance for hitting him and doing<br/>\nmax damage.  In addition to the level of the critter, some critters have<br/>\nvery high magic resistance, such as the ogre guards at Ogukk in Feerott and<br/>\nthe Fire Imps in SolB.  Which means they are gonna resist your spells a<br/>\nhigher percentage of the time.  Another determinative is that some of the<br/>\ncritters are casters with the ability to buff themselves with the same<br/>\nspells we have, so you have to &quot;debuff&quot; them first before your casters will<br/>\nhave any real chance of success at hitting them with their dd spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nI realize this is a very long winded answer, and the bottom line I guess is<br/>\nthat there is a max amt of dmg set by Verant on each spell/song that is not<br/>\ndependent on your stats, such as wisdom, or your level.<br/>\n<br/>\nMik<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Kurt Walther&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:itzkurt@...\">itzkurt@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Sunday, December 19, 1999 5:48 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] Another question<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Kurt Walther&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:itzkurt@...\">itzkurt@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Expulse undead does 94 damage for me and I am lvl 24.
