This is a tradeoff you","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1937705364\">Pure spellcasters get meditate sooner than Priest classes.<br/>\nJust like pure spellcasters get their spells sooners than priest classes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a tradeoff you make since you get more melee skills than spell casters<br/>\nI see clerics that can actually afford to be hit a few times at higher<br/>\nlevels. Whereas, with pure spellcasters, even at 35+ in level, they<br/>\nare being nearly killed (and killed) by MOBs MUCH lower in level<br/>\nthan them. if you get a MOB on THEM during a dungeon crawl, you<br/>\nHAVE to get the MOB off right away.<br/>\n<br/>\nBe patient. Level 8 will come. My druid is having some of the same impatience<br/>\nproblems being level 13 with level 14 dangling in front of her eyes :)<br/>\n<br/>\nEVERY level of spells, by the time it becomes close to time to your<br/>\nnext level, starts to look weak against the monsters. Similarly with <br/>\nmeditate. I don&#39;t think anything needs to change. This just shows that<br/>\nthey chose a good place to put the skill in, whenyou absolutely<br/>\ncan not stand to wait any longer :)<br/>\n<br/>\nSarah Heacock<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Fri, 23 Jul 1999, Walt Zimbeck wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Walt Zimbeck&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wzimbeck@...\">wzimbeck@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I was wondering what the proper procedure was to petition for a change.   I<br/>\n&gt; do not know about the rest of you but I feel that clerics should get<br/>\n&gt; meditate at six and not have to wait until eight for it.  My seventh level<br/>\n&gt; cleric spends a lot of time just sitting waiting for mana for restore.   It<br/>\n&gt; is really glaring when you are grouped with spell casters and after the<br/>\n&gt; battle you heal them up and then have to sit for five or ten minutes to get<br/>\n&gt; your mana back when they are ready to go again in just two or three minutes.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Let me know your feelings on this and I will try to get it started if there<br/>\n&gt; is enough support and if not then I will just live with it the way it is.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On a side note a very strange thing happened to me this morning.   I was<br/>\n&gt; hunting in Butcherblock and ran out of food.   Rather than making the long<br/>\n&gt; run back to Felwithe for more food I decided to gate.   I got a message<br/>\n&gt; about that zone being down and that they would put me in a safe place within<br/>\n&gt; my zone.   The safe place ended up just outside the dwarf city and I was<br/>\n&gt; near the GF zone point, but that is not the problem.   Everything except<br/>\n&gt; keyboard locked up tight.   I could not use my mouse to do anything at all.<br/>\n&gt; No casting, no sitting, no selling or buying and worst of all no camping to<br/>\n&gt; escape that mess and of course no GM&#39;s or Guides around.   I could not even<br/>\n&gt; do a soft boot to escape and ended up doing a hard re-boot.     I suppose<br/>\n&gt; that maybe I could have tried to get back to the GF zone point and try to<br/>\n&gt; zone out to see if that cleared it up but my defensive spells were about to<br/>\n&gt; wear off and I could not refresh them.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks all for listening to my rantings,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Congratulations SAYNO2DRUGS.
