Even then, you will most likely find<br/>\nyourself spending many happy hours trying to recover your corpse. The<br/>\nproblem is that you will quickly get bored with the first level, and<br/>\nwill convince yourself that the lower levels can&#39;t be all that bad.<br/>\nWell, they are. And the loot isn&#39;t all that great, either.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrust me, I have many friends who swear they will never return to that<br/>\nplace. And these people are good players.<br/>\n<br/>\nSaidinn Witchwood<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. I know there are probably some of you out there who actually love<br/>\nBefallen, but PLEASE, can we at least agree that Wixl shouldn&#39;t go to<br/>\nBefallen until at least level 15?<br/>\n<br/>\nP.P.S No hard feelings, Mikaela :)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
