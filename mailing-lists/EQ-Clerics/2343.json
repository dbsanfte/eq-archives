Hate does not necessarily<br/>\npreclude healing. The only real contradiction as far as clerics and their<br/>\ngods go, is Bertoxxulous, the plaguebringer.<br/>\n<br/>\nGnomes and humans default to him because the list is in alphabetic order and<br/>\nhe is highest in their list of choices. This is why at the character<br/>\nselection screen gnome and human clerics have the &#39;evil&#39; background. It also<br/>\nexplains why the gnome cleric guild master hangs out at the necromancer<br/>\n(gnome necros must follow Bertoxxulous) guild, buffing the decaying<br/>\nskeletons that wander the mines of malfunction.<br/>\n<br/>\nSalt</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
