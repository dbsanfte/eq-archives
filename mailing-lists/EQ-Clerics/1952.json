But I see your point.<br/>\nI guess my assumption was that this was done during the normal course<br/>\nof activities.  Ok, so if I wanted to spend all day long on smithing<br/>\nor pottery, or hell, even fishing, then I guess I could do that.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Well, I&#39;m on the test server, and with 300 people, I&#39;m not sure I<br/>\ncould really make that much money.
