Maybe AC&#39;s is a lot different but by the time<br/>\nyou get to the character select screen on EQ I could&#39;ve been playing AC for<br/>\n2-3 mins.  Both are good games, everyone whined about how EQ&#39;s interface and<br/>\nall that, AC&#39;s seems to be better yet I&#39;ve read in a few places ppl are<br/>\nsaying it&#39;s worse.  I don&#39;t find AC hard to play at all, it&#39;s easy to learn,<br/>\nhave pretty good graphics, gameplay is easy and I think AC feels more like a<br/>\nreal RPG then EQ does on how they handle skills and all that.<br/>\n<br/>\n**************************<br/>\nAzor<br/>\nLvl 18 Human Cleric of the Rathe<br/>\n**************************<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: Paul Heenan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pheenan@...\">pheenan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Aye, you are correct there.
