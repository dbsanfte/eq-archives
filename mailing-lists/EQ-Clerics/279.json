One problem I  can&#39;t seem to solve is the<br/>\n&gt;money issue.  How did u guys get the spells and armor you  needed?  I<br/>\n&gt;figure my lvl 9 spells will cost me near 25pp, and I still have my<br/>\n&gt;newbie armor, and a rusty warhammer, nothing else...to get all leather<br/>\n&gt;armor would cost me around 25-30pp...I&#39;m currently lvl 7, and I have<br/>\n&gt;10pp to my name.  It&#39;s a start, yes, but no where near where it needs to<br/>\n&gt;be.<br/>\n&gt;Even after this, how did you get money for the more exp spells?<br/>\n&gt;This money issue is driving me crazy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;EvertorN<br/>\n&gt;Level 7 Erudite Cleric<br/>\n&gt;Proud member of United We Stand/ Honorable Players<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Looking for a new hobby?
