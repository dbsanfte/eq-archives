I tried creating new characters on other<br/>\nservers but what I found was that while I didn&#39;t miss the &quot;twinking&quot; I did<br/>\nwith my other babies on The Rathe, what I DID miss were my friends and my<br/>\nguild and all the things we did together.  (Can&#39;t live without green spam!!)<br/>\nSo for me, going to another server isn&#39;t really an option right now.  It&#39;s<br/>\nreally the people that keep me coming back to EQ, not just the game.  If I<br/>\ncould bundle them all up and take them to Test, I would, but unfortunately,<br/>\nit isn&#39;t gonna happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nMik<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Heather M.

Daley&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:blushn@...\">blushn@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My Friends and I are burned out quite a bit on Fennin Ro, way too crowded,<br/>\n&gt; and the Planes are near to impossible half the time.  Well, we decided to<br/>\n&gt; take a break and I am having a blast.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We created characters on the test server. No Spam, No crowding, and no<br/>\n&gt; problems so far about finding stuff to hunt. We are still very young yet<br/>\n&gt; though and it is fun having to work for all our stuff again.  On Fennin We<br/>\n&gt; could create newbie and give them things, but on test we can&#39;t &quot;twink&quot; so<br/>\nit<br/>\n&gt; feels just like it did when I started out on March 18th.<br/>\n&gt; I made a cleric again, while my friends made classes that are different<br/>\nform<br/>\n&gt; what their high levels on Fennin are.  My thought are I have always liked<br/>\n&gt; playign the cleric and well if we are gonna go anywhere on Test, you have<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; have a cleric so I am happy to repeat.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Just thought I would share that with everyone, I am having a blast once<br/>\n&gt; again =)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Bree, 50th cleric of Fennin Ro<br/>\n&gt; Laurelei, 4th cleric of Test<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
