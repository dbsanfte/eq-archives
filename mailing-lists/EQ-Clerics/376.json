I think it&#39;s mainly<br/>\ndue to the fact that its such a small zone.  Theres always lots of<br/>\nmovement there, especially during a fresh spawn.  And, as far as I&#39;m<br/>\nconcerned, 55 is too many for a zone of that size.  One thing that has<br/>\nhelped me with my lag is turning off any video effects.  I believe it&#39;s<br/>\nparticle effects but I&#39;m not sure (at work).  It helps with video lag<br/>\ntremendously.  The only downside (if you consider it a downside) is<br/>\nthat you cant see the &quot;fireworks&quot; that come with the spells and you<br/>\ncant see rain or snow.  It doesnt affect the game play and I really<br/>\ndont miss out on it =)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing that tends to slow me down is my sound card.  It&#39;s an<br/>\nonboard and it sucks.  I keep my 3d sound off and go about my business.<br/>\n It&#39;s not bad, just not as many sound effects.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helped some!<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Azor &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jmaynus@...\">jmaynus@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Azor&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jmaynus@...\">jmaynus@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Last night (or this morning, depends on how you look<br/>\n&gt; at 12am), I was in<br/>\n&gt; Unrest was a group of 5 for a while.  I did a /<br/>\n&gt; which will tell ya who&#39;s in<br/>\n&gt; the zone and it said there were only 55 people in<br/>\n&gt; Unrest.  Yes 55 people but<br/>\n&gt; still laggy as crap in there.  I got attacked by a<br/>\n&gt; Werebat and some kinda<br/>\n&gt; skel maybe a monk can&#39;t remember but I could not see<br/>\n&gt; them at all, thats<br/>\n&gt; happened to me in Steamfont with Minos.  It&#39;ll say<br/>\n&gt; you are hit by a Mino for<br/>\n&gt; whatever but you can&#39;t see them.  But anyways I take<br/>\n&gt; off from the Werebat<br/>\n&gt; and Skel just to be killed by a Hag.  But running<br/>\n&gt; even with SoW on ya in<br/>\n&gt; Unrest can be a pain cause of the lag.  At times it<br/>\n&gt; wasn&#39;t bad at all but<br/>\n&gt; other times WOW lag slowed ya down a lot.<br/>\n&gt; Also looted a corpse someone left in Unrest to find<br/>\n&gt; a Small Bronze Collar.<br/>\n&gt; Heard it was worth maybe 10-12pp but sell it to a<br/>\n&gt; store and they only wanna<br/>\n&gt; give ya 8gp, yeah right like I&#39;d take 8gp for a<br/>\n&gt; Bronze Collar.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; **************************<br/>\n&gt; Azor<br/>\n&gt; Lvl 16 Human Cleric of the Rathe<br/>\n&gt; **************************<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jdean2@...\">jdean2@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I know, I know, Rodcet Nife isn&#39;t as crowded as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; many of the other servers, but it can still be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; crowded.  I suggest searching for new areas.  I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have found a zone that has never had more than 25<br/>\n&gt; &gt; people in it since I have been there.  Exp. is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; great and I am making about 60pp a day in loot.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Did I mention that I now have full bronze from<br/>\n&gt; &gt; this same zone?  I am not a level 49 player<br/>\n&gt; &gt; either.  I made 18 last night and I already have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; two bubbles of exp. toward 19.  I have all the lvl<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 19 spells bought, an incredible amount of jewelry,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and over 500pp in the bank.  Once again I implore<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you to travel and to form 6 member groups.  If you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hear about a great place then every one else has<br/>\n&gt; &gt; also.  Find your own area.  There are many that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; are hardly ever visited and you&#39;ll have your<br/>\n&gt; &gt; cloice on what, when, and where to kill.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Blessed<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Level 18 Cleric<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Rodcet Nife<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ONElist members are using Shared Files in great<br/>\n&gt; ways!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Are you?
