You just have to be<br/>\nsmart enough to know your level&#39;s limits, and lucky enough to live a day<br/>\nlonger than the next guy. The point is simple: If you want to level<br/>\nquickly, don&#39;t even think about befallen until you&#39;re level is<br/>\nsufficient to survive a train or two.<br/>\n<br/>\nSaidinn Witchwood.<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. Frankly, I&#39;ve never seen a level 6 person in Befallen. If you were<br/>\nthere at level six and had fun, then my hat goes off to you. Me, I&#39;d<br/>\nrather hunt in Butcherblock at that level.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
