Sure, others want a cleric around (haven&#39;t had too much <br/>\nproblem finding a group with my cleric, although there sure were some really <br/>\n&quot;dry&quot; nights when finding a group was concerned), but I personally found <br/>\nthat they just want you to heal, med, heal, med, and so on, even in the <br/>\nmidst of battle.  At lower levels, when a cleric can still dish out <br/>\ncomparable damage to other low level fighters, a cleric stepping into the <br/>\nfray and meleeing is fine.  However, at high levels, if the tanks need to <br/>\npull you off monsters because you meleeed (and the damage you do is nothing <br/>\ncompared to anyone else, anyway), groups get seriously ticked off at you.  <br/>\nPerhaps I was just playing the wrong class, but, as far as I&#39;m concerned, <br/>\ngroups want a cleric for strictly performing duties that I really don&#39;t care <br/>\nto perform full time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m only a level 8 druid so far, but I really enjoy the druid much more.  <br/>\nI&#39;m really looking forward to the spells that will ease the frustrations of <br/>\nthe game, such as travelling.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Chris Fresquez&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fresquez@...\">fresquez@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hail all,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I hate to admit this but im having trouble finding groups to play with... <br/>\n&gt;It<br/>\n&gt;seems that everyone wants a lvl 14 or so cleric cos they can heal more, and<br/>\n&gt;admittedly i have problems keeping up with the damage that creatures a few<br/>\n&gt;lvls higher than me can dish out (being only able to heal 30 a pop).  so i<br/>\n&gt;was wondering if anyone knows of a good hunting place i could check out at<br/>\n&gt;lvl 12 and 13 (one bar left till 13 woo).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;thanks<br/>\n&gt;Gwaihir<br/>\n&gt;Cazic-Thule<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Got an opinion?<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Make it count!
