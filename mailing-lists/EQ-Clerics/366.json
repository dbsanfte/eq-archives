Last night Fennin Ro had OVER 1950 people<br/>\n&gt; on that ONE server!!!!!! They need to lock that server down completely and<br/>\n&gt; possibly move any level 10 and below character over to another server.<br/>\n&gt; Personally, I don&#39;t think ANY server should have more than 500 people on it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also, they need to have more than one zone carry certain &#39;very saught&#39; after<br/>\n&gt; items, such as Rubicite armor. Why does Cazic Thule have to be the only<br/>\n&gt; zone? Of COURSE there will be 70-100 people in the zone! Move the Ruby<br/>\n&gt; around...put some in Rathe Mountains, make a level 25+ zone on Erudin so<br/>\n&gt; Ruby can drop there....but not all in one zone. Look at the Journeyman<br/>\n&gt; boots. ONE NPC in the entire game has it, its a no drop item, meaning you<br/>\n&gt; have to loot it yourself. Why cant this npc drop it everytime to stop<br/>\n&gt; overcamping and people from Kill stealing? No, that would make way too much<br/>\n&gt; sense, I guess.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Over camping and lagging CAN end if some of the ideas that so many have sent<br/>\n&gt; in are implemented. But of course, that would cause Verant having to<br/>\n&gt; actually DO something...can&#39;t have that. (naww...I&#39;m not upset heheh &lt;grin&gt;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lanadina </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
