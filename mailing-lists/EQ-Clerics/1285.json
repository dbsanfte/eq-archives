Think about it.&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI HAVE thought about it.  And if THAT is Verant&#39;s policy, then YES, that is<br/>\nwhat you tell them and they must yield or face adverse action from Verant.<br/>\nUnder Brad&#39;s proposed policy, if I&#39;ve been camping an item for hours where<br/>\nthe mob is green, and YOU, a lower level comes along and tells me to go<br/>\naway, then I have to yield.  Is THAT fair?  Think about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeither Mystix nor myself  have ever said it was fair for a higher level to<br/>\ntake a spawn from a lower level that was already there.  I do NOT support<br/>\nthat, and I think Verant needs to do SOMETHING to fix the problem.  I just<br/>\ndon&#39;t think what Brad is proposing is the solution.  They need to find a<br/>\nsolution that doesn&#39;t penalize one group over another, that&#39;s all I am<br/>\nsaying.  Why does everyone think I am supporting high level jerks who muscle<br/>\ntheir way in and steal spawns? I&#39;m NOT.  I abhor such people and think<br/>\nsomething DOES need to be done about them.  I just don&#39;t agree with Brad&#39;s<br/>\nsolution.  Sheesh, peeps, read our posts more carefully.<br/>\n<br/>\nMik<br/>\n<br/>\nMik</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
