Anyways, he was about 2 or 3<br/>\nlevels ahead of me, and a magician.  My advice against spell casters<br/>\nwould be just to fight as normal against them, and try to disrupt their<br/>\nspelling, and after they bombard you with their spells and drain their<br/>\nmana, heal yourself.  This would make their magic casting in vain, and<br/>\ngive you the advantage.  If you have plenty of magic left, smite them,<br/>\nor use any other powerful magic against them to drop their health down,<br/>\nand simply melee them until their dead or unconscious (anyway you<br/>\nprefer).<br/>\n<br/>\nAldaren wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Aldaren &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:knight@...\">knight@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hail fellow Clerics,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   I have witnessed and read about many adventurers dueling to<br/>\n&gt; test their skills or to settle a dispute.  However, I have<br/>\n&gt; never seen a Cleric duel nor have heard of one.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Since we are in charge of Saving lives, how do we tune<br/>\n&gt; ourselves to Take a life? Clerics are far from being cowards,<br/>\n&gt; but to decline a duel or be somewhat at a loss durring a<br/>\n&gt; potential guild war, can bring shame upon the class.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   So I ask, are there any dueling clerics out there that can<br/>\n&gt; lend their experiences to a beginning duelest?  I am a level<br/>\n&gt; 19 cleric but I wish to open the discussion to all levels.<br/>\n&gt; Tips for fighting hybrids, magic using classes, and especially<br/>\n&gt; adventureres that are of lvls higher than yourself.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; //Aldaren<br/>\n&gt;   &quot;There is no comfort between the Craddle and the Grave...&quot;-unknown<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Looking to expand your world?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; ONElist has nearly 160,000 e-mail communities from which to chose!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>-- <br/>\n<br/>\n       Deidden of SCARAB</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
