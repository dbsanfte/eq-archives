Your personal life will start suffering very<br/>\nsoon from this highly addictive game.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter you play eq a while, you will see that each race has very strong<br/>\npoints, and all develop very powerful, the key I have found, is pick a<br/>\nrace you like.. Dont worry about your progression, you will BE powerful<br/>\nif you hit higher levels, its all a matter of it fitting your playstyle.<br/>\nWisdom=Life for a cleric, its where we get our mana, at lower levels we<br/>\nwill be able to stand in the front lines with the warriors and dish it<br/>\nout, but later, we just cant take the beating, while we do MUCH better<br/>\nthan the Fragile mage classes (Wizard, Magician, etc) even WE cant take<br/>\nthe massive ammounts of damage those monsters dish out. So, our role is<br/>\na medic, to preform, you need high wisdom. I personally chose a Erudite<br/>\nbecause I dont plan to be doing much fighting (low strength/stamina) but<br/>\nsuper high Intel(Rate at which I learn skills) and wisdom... And,<br/>\nbecause I think they look the coolest all decked out. :) (Just me)<br/>\n<br/>\n=)<br/>\n<br/>\nEnjoy the game Curtis<br/>\n<br/>\nCzar<br/>\nThe BurningHeart<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\tCurtis Bennett [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cbennett@...\">cbennett@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tMonday, June 14, 1999 4:28 PM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject:\t[EQ-Clerics] novice questions<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Curtis Bennett &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cbennett@...\">cbennett@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hi, I just bought EQ (my friends talked me into it)<br/>\n&gt; and they wanted me to play a Cleric - which fortunately<br/>\n&gt; is what I always play anyway because I like them.  I read<br/>\n&gt; through some of the archives here, and I have a few <br/>\n&gt; questions:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What is the best race for the cleric?  I made a high-elf.<br/>\n&gt; Are they good?  It seemed to have the highest wisdom.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It looks like strength is really important?  What is a <br/>\n&gt; good minimum strength.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; thanks for the help.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; ONElist members are using Shared Files in great ways!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Are you?
