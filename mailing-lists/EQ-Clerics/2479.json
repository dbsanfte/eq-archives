I really feel that this is a problem that all of us have in<br/>\nchanging from solo hunting with maybe a small group now and then to actually<br/>\nneeding a group that you know you can depend on to do their job and when you<br/>\nsay medding they do not pull another critter.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am 15 and was in Oasis today for the second time.  We were having a good<br/>\ntime until a ghoul showed up and I was OOM and most did not have magic<br/>\nweapon.  We had also just finished fighting two Orc Warriors also which had<br/>\ndepleted my mana and a lot of the group&#39;s health.    I ended up gating out<br/>\nfrom gypsy camp since some idiot had pulled a train of spectres into the<br/>\narea and I had already met one up close and personal at the dock area.<br/>\nNeedless to say he won easily.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that I have a list of those with who I will not group and those that<br/>\nI love to group with.   Hopefully those that want to be independent will<br/>\nlearn to work with others or leave the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nYilari, Cleric of Tunare<br/>\nBlades of Honor<br/>\nErollisi Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: Chris Wheeler &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wheelech@...\">wheelech@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ya, you&#39;re right.
