Heard there was over<br/>\n&gt;4,000 ppl in Tallon Zek when it went live, not too long after it went up<br/>\n&gt;they took it down saying they wasn&#39;t gonna put it back up till they had<br/>\n </span></blockquote>more<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Team Servers up and that would be at least a week.<br/>\n&gt;From what I read while ppl waited for it to get up that there were TONS of<br/>\n&gt;ppl in the chat room, many cussing and screaming about it.
