Frame<br/>\nrate was so bad I couldn&#39;t really move, decided to try to leave got blinded<br/>\nand next thing I know I was killed.  Went looking for corpse got killed<br/>\nagain by new monsters they added to the zone.  Found corpse looted it and<br/>\nwith in 5 mins if that the server disconnected on me for like that 5th time<br/>\nin 10 mins.  Was in chat room too hear someone say if you had anything on<br/>\nyour corpses it was all gone, heard like up too 100 ppl lost EVERYTHING but<br/>\nnot 100% sure on how many ppl it was.  Many were saying if they didn&#39;t get<br/>\nthings back they&#39;d never play EQ again.  Also was told if you got killed in<br/>\na GM event you&#39;d lose no exp but yet I did.  Tonight wasn&#39;t a good time for<br/>\nVerant to mess up with Asheron&#39;s Call coming out on Tuesday.  I did hear in<br/>\nthe chat room before logging that GM&#39;s were replacing lost items but who<br/>\nknows for sure about that.<br/>\n<br/>\n***************************<br/>\nAzor Spellbound<br/>\nLvl 24 Human Cleric of The Rathe<br/>\n***************************</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
