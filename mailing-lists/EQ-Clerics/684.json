When Sierra&#39;s customer service went down, we (on<br/>\nthe realm) were all informed that Middle Earth wouldnt even be started<br/>\nfor at least a year, if not more.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, Stephen Nichols is the one who is doin all the developing.  As<br/>\nany realmer (ex realmer even) knows, Stephen blew us ALL off and left<br/>\nfor greener pastures.  He was one of the only ones actually<br/>\nimplementing stuff in the game, when he dumped the game, everything<br/>\nsuffered.  Any game being worked on by such a fickle person would have<br/>\nto suck.  Maybe not at first, but eventually he&#39;ll lose interest in<br/>\nthat and dump it too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Vicki &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:vicki@...\">vicki@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Vicki&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:vicki@...\">vicki@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Azor&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jmaynus@...\">jmaynus@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Realm.  The Realm at first was a big game, but<br/>\n&gt; over time ppl got tired of<br/>\n&gt; it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and they quit playing where is the Realm now?  It<br/>\n&gt; might still be there but<br/>\n&gt; &gt; how often is it updated, how many ppl are on there<br/>\n&gt; now to play with or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; against?  I like EQ about as much as the next<br/>\n&gt; person, but I have a feeling<br/>\n&gt; &gt; we won&#39;t see it around or as big as it is now for<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d say 2-3 more years,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with games such as Middle-Earth, Asherions Call<br/>\n&gt; and I&#39;ve heard of one more<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you played Realm then you would know better then<br/>\n&gt; to even think for one<br/>\n&gt; minute that with Stephen involved in Middle Earth -<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s not going to be<br/>\n&gt; anything but a mess.  I don&#39;t think he could program<br/>\n&gt; his way out of a paper<br/>\n&gt; bag! And I for one will NEVER buy a game that he is<br/>\n&gt; involved in.<br/>\n&gt; Been there, done that! lol<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; People left Realm to come here for the most part,<br/>\n&gt; Sierra is in trouble -<br/>\n&gt; Middle Earth is not being worked on at this time and<br/>\n&gt; it will be years before<br/>\n&gt; it comes out if ever. It would not surprise me to<br/>\n&gt; see somewhere down the<br/>\n&gt; road that Sierra sells the rights to it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Its the same with everything in life, things change<br/>\n&gt; and in the computer<br/>\n&gt; industry they improve at an alarming rate. On a<br/>\n&gt; Monday you can buy a state<br/>\n&gt; of the art CD Rom and by Friday something better has<br/>\n&gt; come out.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I mean 2-3 years for a game is a very long time. I<br/>\n&gt; love EQ just as much as<br/>\n&gt; the next person (for now-hehe) but that won&#39;t stop<br/>\n&gt; me from looking around<br/>\n&gt; when something better comes out :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You can WIN $100 to Amazon.com!<br/>\n&gt; If you join ONElist∩┐╜s FRIENDS & FAMILY program.
