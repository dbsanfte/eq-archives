","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-594130849\">I agree with what you are saying, but lag is a network issue. These<br/>\nthings don&#39;t clog a network.  You need a new video card if you are<br/>\nhaving problems here.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor us to have this discussion, we need to better define what &quot;lag&quot;<br/>\nis.  And what it is, is network congestion, or slow-down.  The pre-<br/>\ndefined EQ world will not affect that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Ralph Carothers &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:CarothersR@...\">CarothersR@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;this is where you are WRONG.  Lag in the game can be defined by 2<br/>\n&gt;things.....both effecting your speed:  a)  data rate to you for varying<br/>\n&gt;objects anf their placement (eg - corpses, monsters etc)<br/>\n&gt;b)  Your system&#39;s speed and ability to deal with the &quot;pre-defined&quot; images<br/>\n&gt;you have.  Example:  3dfx is fill limited to like 1833 textures (some ODD<br/>\n&gt;number like that)  when more than that is there....your system goes NUTS<br/>\n&gt;swapping in and out....  as it is....if more than 20 people and monsters <br/>\n&gt;are<br/>\n&gt;on your screen....fighting....casting spells etc...your system is gonna go<br/>\n&gt;nuts trying to keep up.  and it does.  You get sometimes 1-2 fps (frames <br/>\n&gt;per<br/>\n&gt;second) which appears to be lag.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Bann<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;From: Curtis Bennett [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:die_kluge@...\">die_kluge@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;Sent: Tuesday, September 28, 1999 4:35 PM<br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: [EQ-Clerics] lag (was: rez changed)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: &quot;Curtis Bennett&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:die_kluge@...\">die_kluge@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;These things don&#39;t increase lag.  Think about it.  The game world is<br/>\n&gt;completely pre-defined.  The server doesn&#39;t send you any information<br/>\n&gt;about what the trees, buildings or scenery looks like.  All the<br/>\n&gt;server sends is information about what the monsters are doing, what<br/>\n&gt;the people are doing, any messages, and if there are any corpses or<br/>\n&gt;equipment laying on the ground anywhere.  That is, things that are<br/>\n&gt;not part of the static world.  You have a CD, that CD stores the<br/>\n&gt;pre-defined world.<br/>\n&gt;   I could see where corpses would increase lag because that<br/>\n&gt;information would need to be sent to you.  A lot of people in a zone,<br/>\n&gt;and a lot of monsters running aggro.  All these things would do it.<br/>\n&gt;Faydark does not take longer to load than North Ro. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
