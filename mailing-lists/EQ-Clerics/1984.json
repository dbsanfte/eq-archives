I think the only cleric spell <br/>\n     that takes longer to cast is shield of words.  The only time I found <br/>\n     this spell usefull was when I was grouped with a L50 warrior since he <br/>\n     had so many hp superior heal was only healing one bub of his health.<br/>\n     <br/>\n     Last night I was in LGuk and our group was camping the froglik King.  <br/>\n     Now this guy hits hard and fast (140 double attacks) and I was casting <br/>\n     superior heals one after another just to keep our tank (L50 sk) alive. <br/>\n      There is no way I could have gotten off a complete heal during these <br/>\n     fights.<br/>\n     <br/>\n     It also doesn&#39;t make much sence to me that it takes longer to <br/>\n     completely heal someone than it does to ressurect them.<br/>\n     <br/>\n     I think all of our healing spells need reduced casting times,  It&#39;s <br/>\n     very frustrating when your tank looses their last 2 bubs of health <br/>\n     when your trying to get a heal off just to see thoes blue sparkles <br/>\n     around their corpse.<br/>\n     <br/>\n     Just something to think about.<br/>\n     <br/>\n     Drogo DarkBane<br/>\n     The Rathe</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
