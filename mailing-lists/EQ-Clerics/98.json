As far as I can tell Dwarf&#39;s make the &quot;best&quot; clerics, with the one drawback that later they can&#39;t wear green splintered mail.  However, we can wear almost all other magical armors.  I have a base str of 103 and w/ my shield, weapon, full set of bronze except the mantle which is BloodStained my base weight w/ food and water is I too face weight issues even w/ 103 str.  For instance while hunting in permafrost I find it necessary to have a shaman summon me a spirit pack (all items inside the pack weigh 0).  This is necessary becuase after picking up 2 FS weapons I&#39;m encumbered.  The closes place to permafrost to sell is a LONG ways away.  You can&#39;t be leaving allt he time to sell and bank items.  I recommend having a shaman summon you some of these spirit packs.  Also make sure you get STR buffs from somebody... you will need them.  One warning about the spirit pack though.  It disapears when you logout, any items still in the pack when you logout also disapear.  So always move them to another regular backpack before you logout.<br/>\n<br/>\nDuhas Alegulper<br/>\nTarrew Marr<br/>\nCleric of 20th circle</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
