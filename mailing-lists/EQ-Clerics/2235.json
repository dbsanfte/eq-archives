If the fight is under control, I nuke till my<br/>\nheart is content.  I also like to nuke the runners<br/>\njust to get them out of the way.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a time and a place for nuking.  I believe<br/>\nthat a clerics primary purpose is to keep their group<br/>\nalive.  In bad situations, I taunt the mobs on me, hit<br/>\ndivine barrier and scream for my party to zone.  I am<br/>\nalways the last one to zone and usually do the most<br/>\ndying.  But, that&#39;s my job.<br/>\n<br/>\nI imagine everyone plays their cleric differently.<br/>\nWhen grouped with another cleric, I make it a point to<br/>\nlet them know that &quot;I&quot; will be the primary healer.  I<br/>\ntrust no other clerics unless they have proved<br/>\nthemselves to me already.

But I<br/>\n&gt; do know that I<br/>\n&gt; play AGAINST solo clerics (Ie the orcs, etc that one<br/>\n&gt; runs into in<br/>\n&gt; Oasis. These are effectively solo critters) The<br/>\n&gt; NPCs, when soloing,<br/>\n&gt; do a LOT of nuking. So I think maybe that is what<br/>\n&gt; the nukes are<br/>\n&gt; for!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But I do know about playing caster types that can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; melee well (druid and<br/>\n&gt; enchanter)<br/>\n&gt; It is not just frustrating to sit and med through a<br/>\n&gt; fight. It can also get<br/>\n&gt; to the point where you don&#39;t feel you are<br/>\n&gt; contributing to the group. It<br/>\n&gt; might be useful to remind a cleric that feels they<br/>\n&gt; need to melee/nuke every<br/>\n&gt; fight they aren&#39;t directly healing that it is okay<br/>\n&gt; to sit out a fight, med<br/>\n&gt; ALL<br/>\n&gt; the way through, and not fight at all. Even if they<br/>\n&gt; are not needed for<br/>\n&gt; healing.<br/>\n&gt; (We tend to pull blue meleers that my monk friend<br/>\n&gt; can handle all on her<br/>\n&gt; own when I&#39;m low on mana. Then I can sit and med<br/>\n&gt; throughout. But it still<br/>\n&gt; feels a little odd. As if I&#39;m not doing my &quot;part&quot; --<br/>\n&gt; It can be easy, at<br/>\n&gt; level<br/>\n&gt; 18, to think I should still be meleeing. I haven&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; gotten to the part of<br/>\n&gt; my life where I&#39;m not effective yet. (And indeed, my<br/>\n&gt; AC is about the same as<br/>\n&gt; the monk&#39;s.<br/>\n&gt; But she clearly does much more damage than I)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyway, you might want to humor your insecure<br/>\n&gt; clerics and such. let them<br/>\n&gt; know that<br/>\n&gt; they are STILL contributing even if they don&#39;t do<br/>\n&gt; ANYTHING in a particular<br/>\n&gt; battle.<br/>\n&gt; Or maybe even a series of battles (if you&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; fighting a lot of blues. Then<br/>\n&gt; this<br/>\n&gt; could even be possible) The cleric is still buffing,<br/>\n&gt; and being there, ready<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; heal, and cure poison/disease if you happen to get<br/>\n&gt; hit by one of those.<br/>\n&gt; And...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Faerain, level 18 Soldier of Tunare, Solusek Ro,<br/>\n&gt; Phoenix<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: Rose [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rliu@...\">rliu@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Sent: Tuesday, November 16, 1999 10:25 AM<br/>\n&gt; &gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;Subject: RE: [EQ-Clerics] Why do so many clerics<br/>\n&gt; think they&#39;re wizards?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Rose&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rliu@...\">rliu@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Hmm well since you are using my post as a stepping<br/>\n&gt; ladder to your<br/>\n&gt; &gt;rant...lemme just first clarify to you that I know<br/>\n&gt; what a cleric&#39;s main<br/>\n&gt; &gt;function in the group is.  Trust me.  Everyone<br/>\n&gt; loves me as a cleric.  My<br/>\n&gt; &gt;first char on this game is a ranger, and I got her<br/>\n&gt; up to lvl<br/>\n&gt; &gt;40....so I know<br/>\n&gt; &gt;what battles are like in tight situation.  I KNOW<br/>\n&gt; what it is like when a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;cleric/healer does not heal...and one that runs<br/>\n&gt; around screaming and wont<br/>\n&gt; &gt;stand still for u to taunt the mob off...or one<br/>\n&gt; that runs to zone<br/>\n&gt; &gt;as soon as<br/>\n&gt; &gt;he/she starts to get hit...or one who thinks that<br/>\n&gt; nuking is better then<br/>\n&gt; &gt;healing.  I know these thing.  I am not one of<br/>\n&gt; those clerics.  The best way<br/>\n&gt; &gt;to know how to play a cleric is to first play the<br/>\n&gt; opposite...a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;tank that can<br/>\n&gt; &gt;not heal or heal well...you would know what is<br/>\n&gt; expected in a cleric...or<br/>\n&gt; &gt;what you think would make the best cleric.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;As to my question about cleric soloing...it isnt<br/>\n&gt; because I think Im a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;wizard.  Hell, I know I am not even close in nuking<br/>\n&gt; power compare to all<br/>\n&gt; &gt;other nukers.  The reason why I asked was due to<br/>\n&gt; the fact that I just<br/>\n&gt; &gt;changed server and I would like to restart a cleric<br/>\n&gt; character...but I want<br/>\n&gt; &gt;to catch up to my friends.  It is as simple as<br/>\n&gt; that...just to let you know<br/>\n&gt; &gt;that my post was not the best springboard that<br/>\n&gt; leads to yours.  Since I was<br/>\n&gt; &gt;really referring to a &quot;solo&quot; situation and you are<br/>\n&gt; really talking about a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&quot;group&quot; situation.  I mean, who cares if the cleric<br/>\n&gt; nukes if he/she is<br/>\n&gt; &gt;soloing?  No one is going to get hurt except for<br/>\n&gt; the cleric.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;All protestation aside.  I have group with other<br/>\n&gt; clerics before who do<br/>\n&gt; &gt;exactly what you said you hate about them.  Yes, it<br/>\n&gt; is a low lvl<br/>\n&gt; &gt;thing...and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I tend to tell them that they need to sit their<br/>\n&gt; butt down, med, and watch<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the health bars, and for god sake dont let that<br/>\n&gt; health drops below<br/>\n&gt; &gt;50%...esp<br/>\n&gt; &gt;for casters.  So I think if you want to help the<br/>\n&gt; general well being of your<br/>\n&gt; &gt;server...you should take the time and just tell<br/>\n&gt; these inexperience clerics<br/>\n&gt; &gt;what their main duty is in the group...you never<br/>\n&gt; know, they might become<br/>\n&gt; &gt;your regular cleric...and won&#39;t you rather have one<br/>\n&gt; who you know you can<br/>\n&gt; &gt;trust?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;-Imogen<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Hi all :)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I&#39;ve played clerics in the past, and when I was<br/>\n&gt; grouped, I knew my job,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; and did it very well. I buffed the tanks before<br/>\n&gt; battle, watched their<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; health bars carefully during battle, and (at<br/>\n&gt; levels before 25) engaged<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; in a bit of melee if things were going well. No<br/>\n&gt; one had to ask me for a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; heal. I mean, come on. When you go to the doctor,<br/>\n&gt; should it be necesary<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; for you to ask him to heal you? Hell, no. That&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; his job, for pete&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; sake.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Anyway, I have recently been playing a barbarian<br/>\n&gt; warrior, because I knew<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; that I wanted to continue to melee, which would<br/>\n&gt; be a no-no for my cleric<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; at higher levels. Now, however, I&#39;m finding it<br/>\n&gt; very difficult to find<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; good clerics to group with. My warrior is level<br/>\n&gt; 19 now, and I can<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; honestly say that I&#39;ve yet to find a cleric who<br/>\n&gt; knows what the hell he&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>=== message truncated ===<br/>\n&lt;HR&gt;<br/>\n&lt;html&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>=====<br/>\nGet paid for reading E-Mail!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sendmoreinfo.com/id/63758\">http://www.sendmoreinfo.com/id/63758</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
