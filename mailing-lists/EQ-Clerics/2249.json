Does<br/>\nanyone know how far in you have to go to start getting some items?  I<br/>\nmean killing the fish at the entrance is good exp but really crap for<br/>\nloot.  Unfortunately, right at the entrance there are casting messages<br/>\nfrom the mermaids and a couple of others, so if the entrance is lvl 35<br/>\nto 42, what lvl is the stuff just in the zone?<br/>\n<br/>\nAny info would be appreciated as I&#39;d like to know what I&#39;m facing before<br/>\nventuring too far into the dungeon.  Getting ressed underwater can be<br/>\nproblematic ... drowning after a res would suck.  I&#39;ve bound myself in<br/>\nfront of the Kelethin bank and I have bottles of enduring breath in the<br/>\nbank for a quick grab before a res. (My main tanks are in the same<br/>\nsituation).<br/>\n<br/>\nps the Pirahna around entrance hit harder than SG&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nMalanni Mournblade<br/>\nKarana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
