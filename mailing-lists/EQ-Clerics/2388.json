Rabid wolves are decent, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, scarecrows in West Karana.<br/>\nGet in a full group, and fight orcs or gnolls in highhold pass.<br/>\nThere is a ghoul camp in North Ro that would be good.  Stay away from<br/>\nDerv camp #1, though.  Dorn B&#39;Dynn will mop the floor with you.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnrest would be good.  You could fight tormented dead, and probably<br/>\nstill get xp for death beetles.  Pretty far from where you are,<br/>\nthough.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could fight Orcs and panthers in Everfrost, near the Permafrost<br/>\nentrance.  Leave the mammoths alone! :)<br/>\n<br/>\nBlackburrow, would be good, too.  You&#39;d need a group though.<br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of people might tell you to go to Oasis, but the loot completely<br/>\nsucks there.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as loot is concerned, the rabid grizzlies would be the best<br/>\nfor the amount of difficulty.  You get 1/2 plat and a spell (7gp) for<br/>\nevery pelt. Ghoul camp would be good, since they drop bronze weapons<br/>\nsometimes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Chris Wheeler &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wheelech@...\">wheelech@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: &quot;&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&#39;&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: [EQ-Clerics] Hunting at lvl 16<br/>\n&gt;Date: Mon, 29 Nov 1999 14:45:53 -0500<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hi all,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ok, beaten to death question, but I&#39;ll ask anyways.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Where will I gain good xp at lvl 16?  I have been hanging out in the East<br/>\n&gt;Karana&#39;s and North Karana&#39;s lately.  I used to hunt Befallen, but find that<br/>\n&gt;I am probably too strong for the 2nd level and too weak for the 3rd.  West<br/>\n&gt;commons doesn&#39;t have much, and Beholder is now a limbo zone (lots of low<br/>\n&gt;blues, and hi reds).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I am interested in xp, but am concerned I am not making enough money, so<br/>\n&gt;some good xp/loot combo areas would be good.  I must admit, i haven&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;explored much beyond the West commons or the Karanas.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Brytewing, 16th level, the rathe.<br/>\n&gt;&lt;&lt; text3.html &gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
