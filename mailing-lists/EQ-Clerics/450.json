So<br/>\nMr. J Daniels account would fit into what I heard about getting someone to<br/>\nlevel 20 in 5 hours.  This is all hear-say but I believe it.  Here is how I<br/>\nheard they did it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFirst new character is outfitted in high level equipment and kick a??<br/>\nweapon.  <br/>\nThen a group of 40+ characters buff the newbie; spells like Resolution,<br/>\nSymbol of Naltron, Armor of Faith from a cleric.  Talisman of Altune,<br/>\nStamina, Guardian, Alacrity, Agility from a shaman.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNext Tanks go in on a level 20+ creature and taunt, clerics cast immobilize<br/>\nand the newbie starts hitting on it.  If need be the cleric heals.  Once the<br/>\ncreature is under half health the high level group takes it out and the<br/>\nnewbie gets lots and lots of exp.    <br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, if the RL person behind this character hadn&#39;t played before they<br/>\nhave completely ruined the game for them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt will be fun to test this idea out one day, but for now I need to work my<br/>\nway up high.<br/>\n<br/>\nFidan<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Mr. J Daniels [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warpig@...\">warpig@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, July 12, 1999 2:27 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] Twinking & Kiting<br/>\n<br/>\nThats 10 GAME days, not 10 REAL days non-stop.<br/>\n<br/>\nMr. J Daniels<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mon, 12 Jul 1999, David Bradshaw wrote:<br/>\nFrom: &quot;David Bradshaw&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Logain@...\">Logain@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n What did they tag team playing the character?
