If you /hail Gavel, he will tell you who in the<br/>\nTemple to give the enchanted platinum bars to in order to get the<br/>\nappropriate piece in return (vulcanized, magnetized, etc).  Although, please<br/>\nnote that the proper people do not respond to questions about the type of<br/>\nplatinum they give in return.
