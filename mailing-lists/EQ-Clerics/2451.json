Well, we decided to<br/>\ntake a break and I am having a blast.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe created characters on the test server. No Spam, No crowding, and no<br/>\nproblems so far about finding stuff to hunt. We are still very young yet<br/>\nthough and it is fun having to work for all our stuff again.  On Fennin We<br/>\ncould create newbie and give them things, but on test we can&#39;t &quot;twink&quot; so it<br/>\nfeels just like it did when I started out on March 18th.<br/>\nI made a cleric again, while my friends made classes that are different form<br/>\nwhat their high levels on Fennin are.  My thought are I have always liked<br/>\nplayign the cleric and well if we are gonna go anywhere on Test, you have to<br/>\nhave a cleric so I am happy to repeat.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust thought I would share that with everyone, I am having a blast once<br/>\nagain =)<br/>\n<br/>\nBree, 50th cleric of Fennin Ro<br/>\nLaurelei, 4th cleric of Test</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
