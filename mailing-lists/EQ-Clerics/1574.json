I remember reading once on EQVault that<br/>\nBrad didn&#39;t seem to happy with the power gamers.  Can&#39;t remember all he said<br/>\nbut I know he didn&#39;t see why anyone would want to play EQ like that, said<br/>\nhow if he did he&#39;d get bored of it fast, also talked about ppl hitting Lvl<br/>\n50 in just a few months when it should&#39;ve taken them at least a year.  Cause<br/>\nif you notice what are they changing all the time?  High lvl spells, high<br/>\nlvl zones and it&#39;s not for the better but to make it harder on the players<br/>\nso they can&#39;t get lvls as fast as they once did.<br/>\nJust like that rumor that they might be making it to where if you heal<br/>\nsomeone it might not even work.  If they do that then whats the point in<br/>\nbeing a Cleric if we can&#39;t heal a party member thats in trouble?<br/>\nIf Verant thinks the game is so unbalanced now, then why did they release it<br/>\nthis way?  Why not have waited a few extra months and fix the classes?  I<br/>\nthink they did believe it was well balanced but when players start whinning<br/>\nthat their class isn&#39;t as good as the next then instade of making them a bit<br/>\nbetter, that other class gets punished for it and get their spells weakened,<br/>\nor where they may or may not work on another player.<br/>\nWell thats enough outta me for now.<br/>\n<br/>\n**************************<br/>\nAzor Spellbound<br/>\nLvl 20 Human Cleric of the Rathe<br/>\n**************************<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Mikaela&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mikaela1@...\">mikaela1@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I couldn&#39;t agree more,  Azor.  Verant seems totally preoccupied with<br/>\n&gt; discovering and fixing ways players have found to make the game more<br/>\n&gt; playable, rather than looking for positive changes that should be made to<br/>\n&gt; improve both the classes and the game, itself.  It seems all they focus on<br/>\n&gt; is how to make things harder on the players.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Why DON&#39;T they fix Fear Plane, or do something to improve the gosh awful<br/>\n&gt; camping that is going on every single place where a decent item is found.<br/>\n&gt; Last weekend, we (our level 50s) went to like 7 different places to try<br/>\n </span></blockquote>and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; obtain items for some of us that didn&#39;t have them.  This was at 10am EDT<br/>\n </span></blockquote>on<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; a Sunday morning.  Every single last place was camped and the lower level<br/>\n&gt; groups that were there told us they would be there all day and nite.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Since<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; there was really nothing else for us to do, (can&#39;t go to Fear and noone<br/>\n&gt; needs exp anymore)  we all simply logged and went about doing  RL things<br/>\n&gt; outside of EQ.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Verant needs to wake up to the fact that their high level players are<br/>\n&gt; getting fed up and bored, and THAT&#39;s why they are leaving and/or selling<br/>\n&gt; their characters on ebay and looking for new games.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Mik </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
