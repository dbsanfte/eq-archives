As somebody else said though, in Freeport the Paladin&#39;s and the Clerics guild are in the same temple... and unless they are carrying a weapon that identifies them as a cleric or a paladin, it&#39;s not easy to tell which is which.  If you go to a paladin guildmaster, they will still say you are not a paladin and refuse to help you.   However, the person standing next to them may be a cleric... so you can train from them.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Eachann Bronzeleaf,<br/>\n-Cleric of Tunare, Tarew Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: Anne O &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:topaaz1@...\">topaaz1@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, November 22, 1999 12:20 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] Guild Training<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Anne O&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:topaaz1@...\">topaaz1@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; someone prob alrdy ans this but, the clerics and the pally&#39;s are allys, so <br/>\n&gt; therefore you can tain at both guilds, that is why you usually allmost <br/>\n&gt; always find the cleric and payy guild in same building or very close <br/>\n&gt; togerher, i train at either, whichever i come to first =0)<br/>\n&gt; topaaz====xegony<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Marquardt, Kris L.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Kris_Marquardt@...\">Kris_Marquardt@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;To: &quot;&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&#39;&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Subject: [EQ-Clerics] Guild Training<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Date: Mon, 22 Nov 1999 08:36:36 -0700<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Last time I leveled I went back to Freeport to train.
