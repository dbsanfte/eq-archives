The rings are NOT no trade - so it IS possible to purchase<br/>\n&gt; them - though they are excessively costly to get from another player.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not NO DROP so I believe you can trade it.  I&#39;m told that someone<br/>\nsold one for 4000pp on Erolissi Marr but I can&#39;t confirm that story.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And at your level, killing Mitty should give you good experience, so get a<br/>\n&gt; group and hunt her, you don&#39;t have to rely on smite alone if you have a<br/>\n&gt; group - everyone in the group could get experience, thus no one would mind<br/>\n&gt; overly helping you to camp.  (Druids seems to like the paw also - you can<br/>\n&gt; get a druid to help you camp and help you to kill Mitty - and get both of<br/>\n&gt; you the rings)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I camped there for 30 hours total to get the ring, most of that time I<br/>\nwas with one of the following: lvl 35 cleric, lvl 24 druid, lvl 20<br/>\ndruid. I also got other druids/clerics popping in to see if she was<br/>\ncamped.  So it is possible to group (but will lengthen your total camp<br/>\ntime considerably if the others are after rings too)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I did to help disuade KSing was to give any extra rings I got to<br/>\nanother kerra that I wasn&#39;t going to kill. That way if someone came<br/>\nalong that needed the copper or silver rings I offered them them in<br/>\nreturn for looting rights on the first gold ring.  Then just told them<br/>\nwhich kitty to kill.  That worked nicely for me.  Just remember to give<br/>\nthe kitty your ring then loot Mitty to get a replacement since you can&#39;t<br/>\ncarry two at once (being LORE).<br/>\n <br/>\nVinamin<br/>\nSon of Innoruuk<br/>\nPriest of The Lady<br/>\nErollisi Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
