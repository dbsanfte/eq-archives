As far as I&#39;ve heard, primarily a quest zone with few or no agro mobs<br/>\nat this point.  I think it&#39;s likely that there will be some before they patch it<br/>\ntoo us, but now it&#39;s just the quest NPCs.  I also hear that there IS a quest for<br/>\nthe Shadow Weapons in this zone.  The zone will be reached in lavastorm in the<br/>\ntunnel that teleports you accross lavastorm (near Sol A & B entrance).  Kind of<br/>\nstrange, but supposedly you don&#39;t run into the zone entrance, you click on a<br/>\ncontainer laying on the groud (a bag).  This information was posted on another<br/>\nlist, so take it for what you will, but the guy who posted does play on the test<br/>\nserver (I haven&#39;t been on test in awhile myself).<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething to look forward to<br/>\n<br/>\nAilamil Faithbringer</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
