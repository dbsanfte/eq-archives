They know there is no <br/>\nway they can prevent me from getting into the thick of things.  Depending on <br/>\nwhat we have when we travel, I am either a fighting medic (ie fight and cast <br/>\nheals while still fighting), a fighting nuker(depending on how many, what <br/>\nother type of healers, and what we are fighting.), or a sit a med type (only <br/>\nhappens when it is a  long ass fight and OOM , life is low on folks.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI rarly play the sit and med in battle.  I have all the good armor I can <br/>\nwith my mace and shield (cant see a cleric using a staff.   Its just an RP <br/>\nthing.) and wading into combat, much to the shgrin of my comrades...<br/>\n<br/>\nJaxim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Alvarez, Ruben (consultant)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ruben.alvarez@...\">ruben.alvarez@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: &quot;&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&#39;&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] Cleric Brawlers<br/>\n&gt;Date: Mon, 28 Jun 1999 11:50:53 -0400<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: &quot;Alvarez, Ruben (consultant)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ruben.alvarez@...\">ruben.alvarez@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Well I am still a level 16 cleric.  lately I have been hunting in oasis <br/>\n&gt;with<br/>\n&gt;me and a level 17 warrior.  Pretty much we have figured the system down<br/>\n&gt;pack.  He obviously tanks it and I dont do anything except hit it and heal<br/>\n&gt;him.  I never use any other spells.  I did use Smite on the DW Croc or Ca<br/>\n&gt;but it just seems to waste more mana and we have to wait a bit longer so I<br/>\n&gt;can med.  So now we just bang away and when he needs I heal I heal him.<br/>\n&gt;Then there is no wait time for me to med because I have about 75% mana left<br/>\n&gt;after the fight and we do pretty good with me casting Smite.  I noticed <br/>\n&gt;with<br/>\n&gt;multiple clerics in a group one would usually be the dedicated healer the<br/>\n&gt;other would be the cleric who casts Smite and the emergency healer in case<br/>\n&gt;the other cleric gets hit.  We as clerics are primary goal is to keep our<br/>\n&gt;members alive.  Sometimes its a hard job to keep.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Qanin<br/>\n&gt;The Rathe<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;From: Dawn Lamb [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dawn@...\">dawn@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;Sent: Monday, June 28, 1999 11:29 AM<br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] Cleric Brawlers<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: &quot;Dawn Lamb&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dawn@...\">dawn@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hi. I&#39;m new to this mail group but thought I would put in my 2cents here. I<br/>\n&gt;am a level 10 High Elf Cleric on the Rodcet Nife server. I regularly group<br/>\n&gt;with a Paladin and a Wizard. They know better than to tell me that my only<br/>\n&gt;job is to sit back and heal. I jump right in with them and watch their<br/>\n&gt;health rather intently. If I see that they need my services, I back out,<br/>\n&gt;heal them and then get right back in. I don&#39;t tank as the Paladin enjoys<br/>\n&gt;doing that herself. I will often times use that little strike spell to get<br/>\n&gt;the targets attention. My attack isn&#39;t all that great but at least I feel I<br/>\n&gt;contribute more than just an occasional healing spell or buff to the group.<br/>\n&gt;No one has complained yet.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Zoya<br/>\n&gt;10th level<br/>\n&gt;  HE Cleric<br/>\n&gt;  Rodcet Nife<br/>\n&gt;----------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Squires, Dean&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:DeanSquires@...\">DeanSquires@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;To: &quot;&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&#39;&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Subject: [EQ-Clerics] Cleric Brawlers<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Date: Mon, Jun 28, 1999, 10:21 AM<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Squires, Dean&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:DeanSquires@...\">DeanSquires@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Just wanted to open a discussion on Clerics who love to fight.  I am<br/>\n&gt; &gt;happy being a cleric, but I cannot resist jumping into the heat of a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;battle and kicking some back.  I also like to occassionally tank.  I try<br/>\n&gt; &gt;to save all my mana for healing, but sometimes I just love to blast<br/>\n&gt; &gt;away.  This is probably because I feel useless when grouped as my<br/>\n&gt; &gt;regular attack doesn&#39;t compare to others in the group.  Anyone else feel<br/>\n&gt; &gt;this way?
