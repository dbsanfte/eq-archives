I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1522126370\">I don&#39;t have the rest of the messages for this thread, but if you are <br/>\nreferring to asking people for items, cash, etc.... Rule number one is don&#39;t <br/>\ndo it.  I never ever respond to someone who asks me for things, I dislike <br/>\nbeggars.  I will gladly help another who merely just chats with me, if I get <br/>\nto talking with someone.  I will offer all kinds of information and advise, <br/>\nas well as giving items and cash.  But never never if they ask for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nlet me give an example.....I was on another server with a lvl 5 cleric I <br/>\nmade, she was still roaming around west freeport and she saw a dwarf enter <br/>\nwhere she was resting.  She merely said &quot;Greetings&quot;, asked how he was, <br/>\ntalked with him for a bit, I never once asked for a thing.  He was a level <br/>\n47 cleric.  He buffed me very well, and asked if I would like a weapon. I <br/>\nthanked him over and over, because its people like that who make the game <br/>\nworth playing.  He was a generous man.  I was happy to chat with him and <br/>\nthat he would sit and chat with me.  He ended up giving me a Combine Morning <br/>\nStar, Black Iron medallion and 200 plat, I was shocked to say the least. I <br/>\nwill never forget his generousity and hope I can repay him sometime.   My <br/>\nlevel 50 cleric has done this very same thing for lower level characters, <br/>\njust because they sat and chatted, and Didn&#39;t beg.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I am completely off what the topic of this thread is I apologize, just <br/>\nresponding to what I saw in this last posting.<br/>\n<br/>\nBree Wyndsdale - 50th cleric on Fennin Ro<br/>\nLaurelei - 5th cleric on Test<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Levi Kemp&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:levikemp@...\">levikemp@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] Norrath Economy<br/>\n&gt;Date: Mon, 13 Dec 1999 09:51:05 -0600<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I find that really amazing, I occasionally get a little bit of help when it <br/>\n&gt;comes to equipment, something like ringmail that someone doesn&#39;t need <br/>\n&gt;anymore, but never that much equipment or PP. Sometimes I wonder about <br/>\n&gt;that, my friends get free stuff all the time, is it the way you ask or <br/>\n&gt;something?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Janor - Dwarf Cleric on Tunare<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;At the entrance he again asked me if I would not accept a tip.   I told <br/>\n&gt;him<br/>\n&gt; &gt;that yes I would accept a small one expecting a pp or two maybe.  Well he<br/>\n&gt; &gt;tipped me 50pp.   Needless to say I was stunned but accepted.   50pp to a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;5th level is a fortune for sure.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I don&#39;t quite go to that extreme, but I do something similar on a regular<br/>\n&gt;basis. When I run out of cats eye, and I&#39;m in a town I have bad faction, I<br/>\n&gt;always give a 1st lvl character 15 PP to pick me up 40 of them. At 2 and a<br/>\n&gt;half gold each, he gets 5 PP to keep. A nice bonus for a first lvl. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
