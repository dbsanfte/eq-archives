However, there are still a couple things<br/>\n&gt;that puzzle me. I was really hoping someone could<br/>\n&gt;enlighten me. :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;1) Charm, does cancel magic work on it or not? I have<br/>\n&gt;tried casting several times with mied results.<br/>\n&gt;Sometimes it seems to cancel it sometimes it does not.<br/>\n&gt;All of my party members had only endure magic on, so<br/>\n&gt;the second dispell should have theoretically worked,<br/>\n&gt;but sometimes it did not. What gives?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;2) When charmed, I thought you could not use your<br/>\n&gt;skills/spells. This seemed to be the case until late<br/>\n&gt;last night when a 28th cater was charmed and then<br/>\n&gt;proceeded to kill me in three casts. I also lost about<br/>\n&gt;a half a bubble of exp from this PC death. I later<br/>\n&gt;asked the caster and she said that she was killed me<br/>\n&gt;by a spell that was memorized in the 6th slot, not the<br/>\n&gt;8th slot like some peeple think. Her 8th slot was a<br/>\n&gt;gate.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So, what gives?? I think correct information would<br/>\n&gt;come in handy in later levels.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks!!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Eylena 20th circle Priestess of Tunare.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;=====<br/>\n&gt;&lt;&lt; text3.html &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Topaaz / LadyJay - *Power Corrupts and absolute Power corrupts absolutly* <br/>\n*hugs*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
