I like to be able to loot a<br/>\nlittle and not have to run back to town every 10 minutes. I have since<br/>\nrectified the situation though and have a Darkwood shield (+9 strength),<br/>\nbloodstained mantle (+3 strength) and something else that has put me at<br/>\nabout 112 strength... no problems anymore...<br/>\n<br/>\nDriftwood<br/>\nlvl 29 Cleric on Solusek Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
