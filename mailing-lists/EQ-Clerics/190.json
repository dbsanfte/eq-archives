I am<br/>\nhappy being a cleric, but I cannot resist jumping into the heat of a<br/>\nbattle and kicking some back.  I also like to occassionally tank.  I try<br/>\nto save all my mana for healing, but sometimes I just love to blast<br/>\naway.  This is probably because I feel useless when grouped as my<br/>\nregular attack doesn&#39;t compare to others in the group.  Anyone else feel<br/>\nthis way?  Any experiences to share?<br/>\n<br/>\nBaelstorm <br/>\n10th Level<br/>\n(Solusek Ro)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
