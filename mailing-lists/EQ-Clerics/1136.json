And clerics ARE well balanced.<br/>\nHowever, I still think that clerics should not be able to be stunned<br/>\nwhile Divine Aura is up. I don&#39;t agree with Geoffrey that to change this<br/>\nwould give clerics a &quot;get out of jail free card.&quot; Many times, there is<br/>\nnowhere for the cleric to go even when he&#39;s invulnerable. And often he&#39;s<br/>\ntoo hurt to get to a zone fast enough to matter. In some cases, casting<br/>\nDivine Aura merely postpones the inevitable. Since you can&#39;t cast or<br/>\nfight, all you have time for is to find a nice cozy corner to die in.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne exception: with DA on, you can sit and memorize gate (unless you get<br/>\nstunned, of course!), and hope that you&#39;re lucky enough to get it to<br/>\nwork after DA wears off.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis being said, I think someone should tell EQVault to update their<br/>\ncleric guide. It says that while you have DA on, you can cast Heal on<br/>\nyour group members and help them get away from the mob by meleeing the<br/>\nMOB, which will offer enough distraction for your friends to hightail it<br/>\nto safety. Ha ha! Wouldn&#39;t that be nice?<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: FlashD [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:DunleyG@...\">DunleyG@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, September 03, 1999 1:28 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [EQ-Clerics] Interview with Geoffrey Zatkin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;FlashD&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:DunleyG@...\">DunleyG@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWell Looks Like The Cleric Petition was answered, with a big &quot;NO&quot;.
