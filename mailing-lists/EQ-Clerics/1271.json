Granted, you cant<br/>\ndo this with all of the lower levels....but do you know how often I&#39;ve had<br/>\nhigher levels come in without as many principles as most of you?  Why dont<br/>\nyou start bitching at those who HAVE gone and made this a problem?<br/>\n<br/>\nExample:  I&#39;m in Blackburrow one day.  The onyx earrings have to be one of<br/>\nthe SIMPLEST things to get ahold of.  A Magician, lvl 27 walks in, says he&#39;s<br/>\nhere to get the earring, and he&#39;ll take everything until he does....if we<br/>\ndont like it....LEAVE.<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, this is a great attitude people. We had 2 of the damn things to sell,<br/>\nand offered them and his answer:  &quot;WHy should I buy from a lower level when<br/>\nI can get them myself.&quot;  Or then we have the fact that I can pick these<br/>\nsuckers up at HOW MANY merchants?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the paw of opalla quest you could EASILY purchase the damn rings from<br/>\nlower levels who got them....not only does it get rid of some of that cash<br/>\nyou had sitting around doing NOTHING, but it keeps everyone happy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBann<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Mystik [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mystik@...\">mystik@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Sunday, September 12, 1999 7:48 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] Yield Policy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Mystik &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mystik@...\">mystik@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nmik, i agree wholeheartedly....there are items i&#39;d like to get as well,<br/>\nbecause<br/>\ni wason&#39;t able or didn&#39;t know about them till the mobs wouldn&#39;t give me<br/>\nexp....seems the fair thing to do is what you said...&lt;paraphrased&gt; first<br/>\ncome,<br/>\nfirst serve<br/>\n<br/>\n(&#92;/)ystix<br/>\n<br/>\nMikaela wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Mikaela&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mikaela1@...\">mikaela1@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ll tell you what my whole opinion is on this camping/yield issue.

Everything there<br/>\n </span></blockquote>was<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; green to us, but myself and a level 50 shaman friend wanted wreaths<br/>\n </span></blockquote>and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; sceptres, which we didn&#39;t have.  Under Brad&#39;s rule, if a group of<br/>\n&gt; level 35+ comes, and they can get exp for that area, then we have to<br/>\n </span></blockquote>yield<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and give up a spot we have been at for hours. Tell me where the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>fairness in<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; THAT<br/>\n&gt; rule is.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Since there are very few places I can get exp anymore and have maxxed<br/>\n&gt; out level 50, I am going around and getting items I don&#39;t have because<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I was<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; focusing on exp and helping others level as well.

I think that is totally unfair. Just because I am level 50<br/>\n </span></blockquote>doesn&#39;t<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; mean I&quot;m not<br/>\n&gt; entitled to get items I don&#39;t have just because the mobs don&#39;t give me<br/>\n </span></blockquote>exp<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; anymore.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Again, my opinion is....first there stays there.  Then when they<br/>\n </span></blockquote>leave, the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; next group in line gets the camp spot.  I don&#39;t think levels should<br/>\n </span></blockquote>have<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; anything to do with who gets the camp spot.
