One problem I  can&#39;t seem to solve is the<br/>\n&gt; money issue.  How did u guys get the spells and armor you  needed?  I<br/>\n&gt; figure my lvl 9 spells will cost me near 25pp, and I still have my<br/>\n&gt; newbie armor, and a rusty warhammer, nothing else...to get all leather<br/>\n&gt; armor would cost me around 25-30pp...I&#39;m currently lvl 7, and I have<br/>\n&gt; 10pp to my name.  It&#39;s a start, yes, but no where near where it needs to<br/>\n&gt; be.<br/>\n&gt; Even after this, how did you get money for the more exp spells?<br/>\n&gt; This money issue is driving me crazy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; EvertorN<br/>\n&gt; Level 7 Erudite Cleric<br/>\n&gt; Proud member of United We Stand/ Honorable Players<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Looking for a new hobby?
