I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1341673786\">I always seem to notice exceptionally high amounts of lag right after a new patch - don&#39;t know if that is coincidence or not, just personal experience.   I have also experience 10-15 second lag spikes where my lag-o-meter does not show packet-loss.  However, my entire group also experienced these lag spikes without packet-loss meter moving also... thus I can safely guess it is not ALL of our computers acting up at once.. Others in the zone comment over /ooc about lag sometimes too - always at the same time.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t know what to do about it cept just hope it passes... but I don&#39;t think it is always PC related... even when meter not showing lag.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd in response to teen&#39;s hunting - from about level 18-22 I hunted aviak guards in lake rathe (and some undead there at night) and found it to be GREAT experience if you can find a good group :)  Gets a little crowded at peak times..but a cleric can usually find his/her way into any group ;) <br/>\n<br/>\nJust my thoughts ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nSirensa Qi&#39;Seraph<br/>\nDark Elf Cleric, Solusek Ro Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
