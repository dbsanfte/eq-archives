Flash of light is an awesome little tool, if it works. Its<br/>\nfast and uses little mana. He also has cure blindness and he would be stupid<br/>\nto not have it memorized. If he is a lower level it can last a reasonable<br/>\ntime.<br/>\nHowever if you use blindness move behind him to add to the disorientation.<br/>\n<br/>\nUse a one handed weapon if you can. The faster hit times will help keep his<br/>\nspells interrupted.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy suggestion and it is only one possible tactic is stick to blindness,<br/>\ncancel magic and healing. Your offensive spells really are not that good<br/>\nmana/damage wise.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlind then get in close and hit him with your club. He will try and DOT you<br/>\nand slow you down with spells. Then bash the hell out of you. Keep hitting<br/>\ntill you are half down on mana. Then blind and heal yourself. Your heal<br/>\nspells are far better mana efficiency. Then keep hitting. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck and let us know how it goes. If you are two levels higher than him<br/>\nand can&#39;t take him. Then you have a problem. One is risky. At the same I<br/>\nwould favor the Shaman. But clever tactics might win the day for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards<br/>\n<br/>\nNynenom of Rallos Zek<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Not Entirely Innocent Until Proven Definitely Guilty<br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:douglas@...\">douglas@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, August 13, 1999 10:09 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] Please Help!
