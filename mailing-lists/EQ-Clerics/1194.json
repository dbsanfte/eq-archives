But it&#39;s still the case that on the older servers, people<br/>\n&gt;are skipping straight to bronze, or receiving very underpriced banded from<br/>\n&gt;higher-level friends who don&#39;t need it, or whatever. The market for banded<br/>\n&gt;is getting younger and younger, and hence people expect banded for cheaper<br/>\n&gt;and cheaper just because they don&#39;t have that kind of money to spend.<br/>\n&gt;Also, of the friends that I group with regularly, only 1 can wear banded <br/>\n&gt;who<br/>\n&gt;hasn&#39;t already got it :-(<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;But let&#39;s not go too far into a smithing discussion...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;A question:<br/>\n&gt;Despite clerics traditionally being a poor class, I suspect that many<br/>\n&gt;clerics do one or more trade skills... Anyone? My favourite is baking<br/>\n&gt;because you can cook on the move.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Elbeno<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: AoS/Aosinator &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:darshan@...\">darshan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Actually I&#39;m quite serious.  If ye need to armor 3 or 4<br/>\n&gt; &gt; players, and they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; are willing to pay for the base costs of the materials, you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; could easily<br/>\n&gt; &gt; gain enough skill to make banded reliably.  I estimate it would take<br/>\n&gt; &gt; roughly 250 to 300 platinum pieces to bring smithing up to the level<br/>\n&gt; &gt; necessary to create Banded.  With 3 or 4 people, that comes<br/>\n&gt; &gt; out to 75 to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 100pp each for banded.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;WIN a trip to Hawaii!<br/>\n&gt;Enter ONElist&#39;s Hawaiian Sweepstakes.
