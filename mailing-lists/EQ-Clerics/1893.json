When I get into a group, the idea is<br/>\nthat we are going to fight large quantities of stuff (like orcs in<br/>\nHighhold, or King Crush and his cronies in CB), and I&#39;m needed for<br/>\nhealing and buffing.  As a Dwarf, you are probably better at melee<br/>\nthan a high elf (which I am), as my strength is only 75.<br/>\n  Like someone else mentioned, if you are in a group with other<br/>\nhealers, you can slack off on the healing duties.  I LOVE grouping<br/>\nwith bards because their heal song usually keeps everyone topped off<br/>\non their hit points.  Druids are nice too, because they get healing<br/>\nat 19 (the same spell we get at 14).  So at my level, a Druid is as<br/>\ngood a healer as I am.  Both of these can make a clerics life easier.<br/>\n  I find that most people expect you to heal, since that is what we<br/>\nare best at.  I mean, that&#39;s why you played the class, isn&#39;t it?  If<br/>\nnot, I suggest you switch to becoming a wizard.<br/>\n  On the point that people say that all we do is heal/med/buff etc, I<br/>\nthink that is true to a degree, but the game is the game you make it.<br/>\nI think it would be stingy of a cleric to get into a group and try to<br/>\nmelee and DD.  I mean it would be futile.  You&#39;d never hit with your<br/>\nweapon.  Last night my group was fighting Dvinn and I never could hit<br/>\nhim.  There wasn&#39;t any casters in the group so my smite spell was a<br/>\nnice way to bring his hit points down, but I used it sparingly to save<br/>\nmana for heals.  If there had been a wizard in the group, casting<br/>\nsmite (78 damage at my level) is just a waste of time, since their<br/>\nspells are already doing over 100.<br/>\n  When it comes down to it, if you save a groups ass with a lot of<br/>\nhealing spells, they are going to love you for it, and ask you back<br/>\nagain and again.  But the game is what you make of it.  It is possible<br/>\nto solo at all levels.  I can still solo scarecrows in West Karana.<br/>\nThey are blue to me.  I get more xp in a group though, and I have more<br/>\nfun that way.<br/>\n  And I&#39;d say that 103 wisdom is fine.  My High Elf has 112 base<br/>\nwisdom.  Later on you will want to get more and more +wis items.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Niomar&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Niomar@...\">Niomar@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Okay, I am now lvl 10 and really concerned about this.  From what EVERYONE<br/>\n&gt;tells me (which I totally disagree with and the whole subject matter makes<br/>\n&gt;me sick) is that when older (25+) all we do is heal...no melee, no DD, just<br/>\n&gt;heal and med.  First...is that true or can we still melee..I know we won&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;exactly be able to solo melee...but as in a group or possibly as the only<br/>\n&gt;tank?..and while on that subject, can we solo undead up into all our higher<br/>\n&gt;lvls or do we still need help then too?  And finally the mana issue.  I am<br/>\n&gt;dwarven cleric and have a 100 in strength and 103 in wisdom...will that be <br/>\n&gt;a<br/>\n&gt;high enough wisdom to have proper mana to heal my group and such?
