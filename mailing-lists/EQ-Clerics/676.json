Not only can they successfully keep other<br/>\nlower- to mid-level players from camping nice spawn spots (aviak guards<br/>\nin Lake Rathe comes to mind), but now they have a new creature to hunt.<br/>\nThe rest of us will have to move over to make room for the exodus of<br/>\nmid-level players running for their lives out of Oasis.<br/>\n<br/>\nBEGIN RANT:<br/>\nIf Verant wants to nix camping, they should make more lower- to<br/>\nmid-level mobs, and then restrict the server to 1,000 players. Would<br/>\nthat be so difficult to do? As for the incredibly insane camping that<br/>\ngoes on in places like Najena (for the journeyman boots), I really don&#39;t<br/>\nknow how to address that. As it stands now, though, I am certain that<br/>\nunless I buy a pair off EBay or in-game, I will never own them. I can&#39;t<br/>\nafford to spend one to two weeks camped for 18 hours a day, fighting the<br/>\nkill/loot stealers. And that&#39;s NOT sour grapes. That&#39;s just how it is,<br/>\nfriends and neighbors. And for those of you who have the boots and will<br/>\nswear to me that it took you only a day to get them, I congratulate you<br/>\non your accomplishment.<br/>\nEND RANT<br/>\n<br/>\nSaidinn D&#39;iniluki<br/>\nDark Elf Cleric<br/>\nKarana Server<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: curtis bennett [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:die_kluge@...\">die_kluge@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, July 28, 1999 11:23 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [EQ-Clerics] Oasis Warning<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;curtis bennett&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:die_kluge@...\">die_kluge@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYea... so much for hunting in Oasis now.

Well they are chicken feed.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; As of patch we now have deepwater goblins. Shamans over 35+ with the <br/>\n&gt;wolf<br/>\n&gt; &gt; pets running around the beach of Oasis. Are they aggressive? YES Are <br/>\n&gt;they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; strong? HELL YES<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Last night I witnessed one clean the beach between 2nd and 1st rock, <br/>\n&gt;then<br/>\n&gt; &gt; kill a SAND GIANT and go back to the water for a swim. Apparently the <br/>\n&gt;Gods<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have decided they did not appreciate our camping along the beach. Party<br/>\n&gt; &gt; time<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is over.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; They also added cistern asps. No biggie probably 14th level or so.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; So if this is 100% true and you&#39;re around Lvl 35 or lower you might <br/>\n&gt;wanna<br/>\n&gt; &gt; be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; extra careful there.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; **************************<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Azor<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Lvl 18 Human Cleric of The Rathe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; **************************<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; How do you enter ONElist&#39;s WEEKLY DRAWING for $100?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; By joining the FRIENDS & FAMILY program.
