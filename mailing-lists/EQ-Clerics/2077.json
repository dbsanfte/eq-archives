It wasn&#39;t the being dead part I couldn&#39;t believe but<br/>\nwhat it was he had in his hand.  Now remember his character is a Ranger, pic<br/>\nshows him wearing the new Ranger armor but in his hand was the SoulFire<br/>\nwhich is a Pally only weapon.  Can we say cheating?  Now if one of us tried<br/>\nthat crap we&#39;d get banned from the game but he can wield a Pally only weapon<br/>\nwhen he&#39;s a Ranger?<br/>\nThat shows me the ppl like Brad and GM can get away with anything in the<br/>\ngame.  I also read on the EQ newsgroup that last Sunday the night of the<br/>\nevents that the GM&#39;s were doing things that they&#39;ve told players not to do<br/>\nand if they did they&#39;d get banned for it.  Heard they were camping at zone<br/>\npoints waiting for a player to zone over and kill them and also camping<br/>\nbinding points and killing someone over and over everytime he/she died and<br/>\ncame back at their bind point till they got ticked and pulled the plug on<br/>\ntheir modems.  If we would do that junk we&#39;d get banned for it.<br/>\nCan&#39;t wait to hear what Brad has to say about him wielding a SoulFire.<br/>\n<br/>\n**************************<br/>\nAzor Spellbound<br/>\nLvl 24 Human Cleric of the Rathe<br/>\n**************************</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
