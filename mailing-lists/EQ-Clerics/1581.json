Honestly, I<br/>\n\t&gt;could do without asking people to res their 3 2 day old corpses that they<br/>\n\t&gt;have been &#39;saving for you&#39; the second I enter a zone.  Or being told by<br/>\n\t&gt;someone on the other side of the world that next time I stop by a particular<br/>\n\t&gt;zone, could I &#39;pls rez them&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well I can see it already:<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayerX /tell clericY Can you please resuscitate my corpse in the next zone? I only have 30 minutes left to res it. Can&#39;t find any other clerics of suitable level nearby. Please I really need your help.<br/>\nClericY /tell PlayerX Sorry man I&#39;m grouped and my group needs me<br/>\nPlayerX /tell clericY Please? I really need it I will pay you 10plat<br/>\nClericY /tell PlayerX Make it 20 and I&#39;ll explain it to my group<br/>\nPlayerX /tell clericY Deal!<br/>\n<br/>\nnext day...<br/>\nPlayerX posts message on forums and mailing lists<br/>\n*whine* *moan* *complain* Awww clerics are so nasty they won&#39;t come to my beck and call. Can you believe one had the nerve to charge me 20plat for a lousy resuscitate? I mean it&#39;s not even a resurrection! Verant have made clerics too powerful. They make too much money!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo there you have it, the Shamans/Druids have a money spinner in SOW, Druids/Wizards have a money spinner in group teleport, Enchanters have a money spinner in enchanting metal for jewelcraft, and now Clerics have a money spinner in Resurrection. We were complaining that people expect heals just for free right? Well, how things change...<br/>\nBring on the new complaints!<br/>\nOh, and &quot;Show me the money!&quot; :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEOM <br/>\n<br/>\nNOTICE - This message contains information intended only for the use of the addressee named above.
