Since it&#39;s moving slow and you&#39;re moving fast<br/>\nyou can beat it easy.  This is for soloers only, it&#39;s so you can get good<br/>\nexp without a group.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the twinking you asked about it&#39;s when you&#39;re on a low lvl and a<br/>\nfriend thats on a higher lvl gives you money, weapons and armor that a low<br/>\nlvl player shouldn&#39;t really have.  Also can be done by you having a high lvl<br/>\nand a low lvl characters and giving a friend the items to hand to you&#39;re low<br/>\nlvl character.<br/>\n<br/>\n**************************<br/>\nAzor<br/>\nLvl 17 Human Cleric of the Rathe<br/>\n**************************<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;curtis bennett&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:die_kluge@...\">die_kluge@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; God, playing this game is like learning a new language.<br/>\n&gt; What is kiting?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Heather M.
