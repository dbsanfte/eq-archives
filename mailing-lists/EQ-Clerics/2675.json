The base level is around 20th level for<br/>\nthe vast portions of the dungeon.  The upper floor of upper Guk is<br/>\naround levels 18-22.  Probably somewhere around 20-24 for the lower<br/>\nlevel of Upper Guk (down the stairs, or down the slope, depending on<br/>\nwhich way you went).  There are certain level cut-off points which a<br/>\ngroup shouldn&#39;t go beyond.  One of these is the Shin Lord room.  A<br/>\ngroup of mid-20s can own upper guk, but once they get to the Shin Lord<br/>\nroom, they would get the foo knocked out of them.  The other room is<br/>\nthe Priest room.  Again, a group of mid 20s could rock, but then get<br/>\nslaughtered in this room.  It&#39;s at these points that a group of high<br/>\n20s is required.<br/>\n  The ancient croc room is about as far into UG as you can possibly<br/>\nget.  If you look on a map, there is a small room that leads off a<br/>\nlarge lake.  This little room goes nowhere, and the lake is at the<br/>\nnorthern-most part on the map.  This is the croc room.  From what I<br/>\nknow,the croc is low 30s in level.  The other saltwater crocs are<br/>\nsimilar level.  Apparently, the crocs do not aggro.  While I suspect<br/>\na full group of mid-high 20s could take the room, getting there is the<br/>\nmain problem.  There are two ways to get there.  The dungeon makes 2<br/>\nbig circles, basically.  The way on the left goes through the Priest<br/>\nroom.  A group of mid 20s could not get through this room alive.  I<br/>\nhave not been the other way.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Good luck.<br/>\n<br/>\nErgo Soulhealer<br/>\n25th hie clr<br/>\ntest server<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Chrisstauf k&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chrisstauf@...\">chrisstauf@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nReply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [EQ-Clerics] The Ancient crok in Upper Guk<br/>\nDate: Tue, 25 Jan 2000 10:49:29 MST<br/>\n<br/>\nCould any of you fellow clerics post some information or where to get<br/>\ninformatino regarding obtaining the Gator Skin Leggings from the ancient<br/>\ncroc.
