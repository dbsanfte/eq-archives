But it&#39;s still the case that on the older servers, people<br/>\nare skipping straight to bronze, or receiving very underpriced banded from<br/>\nhigher-level friends who don&#39;t need it, or whatever. The market for banded<br/>\nis getting younger and younger, and hence people expect banded for cheaper<br/>\nand cheaper just because they don&#39;t have that kind of money to spend.<br/>\nAlso, of the friends that I group with regularly, only 1 can wear banded who<br/>\nhasn&#39;t already got it :-(<br/>\n<br/>\nBut let&#39;s not go too far into a smithing discussion...<br/>\n<br/>\nA question:<br/>\nDespite clerics traditionally being a poor class, I suspect that many<br/>\nclerics do one or more trade skills... Anyone? My favourite is baking<br/>\nbecause you can cook on the move.<br/>\n<br/>\nElbeno<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: AoS/Aosinator &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:darshan@...\">darshan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Actually I&#39;m quite serious.  If ye need to armor 3 or 4 <br/>\n&gt; players, and they<br/>\n&gt; are willing to pay for the base costs of the materials, you <br/>\n&gt; could easily<br/>\n&gt; gain enough skill to make banded reliably.  I estimate it would take<br/>\n&gt; roughly 250 to 300 platinum pieces to bring smithing up to the level<br/>\n&gt; necessary to create Banded.  With 3 or 4 people, that comes <br/>\n&gt; out to 75 to<br/>\n&gt; 100pp each for banded.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
