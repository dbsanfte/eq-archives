I got this info off two separate<br/>\nsites.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;snip&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nZones<br/>\n<br/>\nThree new areas, tentatively titled, Temple of Solusek<br/>\nRo, The Hole and Paineel, will be accessable via the<br/>\nToxxullia Forest on Erudin. The zones will be free of<br/>\ncharge and available via an optional patch. More<br/>\ninformation regarding these new zones will be made<br/>\navailable as their release date nears.<br/>\n<br/>\n- The Temple of Solusek Ro should be on-line and<br/>\navailable to our customers, free of charge, by<br/>\nmid-October. A release date for The Hole and Paineel<br/>\nhas not been set.<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nGeneral Issues<br/>\n<br/>\nThough a majority of the EverQuest development team&#39;s<br/>\ntime has been dedicated to the enhancement of current<br/>\ngame play related features, such as dungeon and class<br/>\ntuning and balancing, item/weapon implementation, and<br/>\nspell functionality, we have been able to work on the<br/>\nfollowing.<br/>\n<br/>\n- We are working to make it possible for players to<br/>\nmanually organize spells within their spell book.<br/>\n- Level 35+ characters meditating automatically when<br/>\nthey sit down - without the spell book being brought<br/>\nup.<br/>\n- When a player or NPC speaks in a langauge other than<br/>\n&quot;Common Tongue&quot;, denoting the langauge being spoken<br/>\n(if their skill in that langauge is high enough)<br/>\nproceeding the text.<br/>\n- The ability for the user to manually adjust their<br/>\nclipping plane (the point at which the 3D geometry is<br/>\ndrawn in) on the fly via an in-game slider bar to not<br/>\nonly enhance performance, but to also allow the<br/>\nclipping plane to be moved out much further than it is<br/>\ncurrently set to.<br/>\n- Approximately 20+ new character animations to be<br/>\nmated with the /text socials which were recently added<br/>\nlast week.<br/>\n- Allowing the ability for guilds to be at war with<br/>\nmultiple guilds.<br/>\n- Functionality is being added to allow Enchanters to<br/>\nenchant items.<br/>\n- The ability to send messages to everyone in a<br/>\nplayers Friend&#39;s List whom are currently on-line.<br/>\n- Adding the option for players to not allow looting<br/>\nbefore a guild war is initiated.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;/snip&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough these are somewhat frivilous changes, I can<br/>\nsee how it can make a few things more fun.  I, for<br/>\none, am very excited about the new med changes for<br/>\nlevel 35+, especially since I will be at that level by<br/>\nthe time the change is implemented! (i&#39;m also looking<br/>\nforward to the animations that will accompany the new<br/>\nemotes, but we wont even go into that now )<br/>\n<br/>\nAdira SoulSaver<br/>\nBandaid of Tunare<br/>\n30th Season (and yeah, 30 is a major hell level)<br/>\nRodcet Nife Server<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\nGet paid for reading E-Mail!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sendmoreinfo.com/id/63758\">http://www.sendmoreinfo.com/id/63758</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
