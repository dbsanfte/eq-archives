Which path should<br/>\nI follow? Some people argue that high level clerics CAN melee, while<br/>\nothers argue that at high levels, clerics should concentrate on their<br/>\nhealing and buffing skills. &quot;After all, if you wanted to be a warrior,<br/>\nyou should have been one.&quot; Yeah, yeah, heard that, been there. With the<br/>\nright equipment, though (Jboots, a flowing black sash of haste, an<br/>\nobserver&#39;s staff, etc.), a cleric should be able to hold his or her own<br/>\nin combat, even after level 35. <br/>\n<br/>\nAny suggestions, comments, advice before I commit to one group of items<br/>\nor the other?<br/>\n<br/>\nSaidinn Witchwood<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n    GRAB THE GATOR!
