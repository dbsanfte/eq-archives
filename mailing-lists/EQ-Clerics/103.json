I read<br/>\n&gt;through some of the archives here, and I have a few<br/>\n&gt;questions:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;What is the best race for the cleric?  I made a high-elf.<br/>\n&gt;Are they good?  It seemed to have the highest wisdom.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;It looks like strength is really important?  What is a<br/>\n&gt;good minimum strength.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;thanks for the help.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;ONElist members are using Shared Files in great ways!<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Are you?
