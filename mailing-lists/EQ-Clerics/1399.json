And not only weapon skills, but weapons: even the best 1H and 2H<br/>\nblunts in all of Norrath cannot compare with even so lowly a weapon as the<br/>\nBBC, which even a melee class in his mid teens should be able to afford. And<br/>\nthere is much better stuff than the BBC out there. And finally, we never get<br/>\ndual wield or double attack, which puts us far, far back in the amount of<br/>\ndamage we inflict compared to melee classes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m level 27 now, and I have been thinking about this a lot lately. Although<br/>\nI love to melee, and love to see that mace mangling the mob&#39;s flesh and<br/>\nsplintering its bones, and watch its HP bar ebb away... I have to agree with<br/>\nthe groups I&#39;ve been with who urge me to just sit and med through battle,<br/>\nand &#39;wake up&#39; only to cast a heal. By the time I&#39;m level 40, I expect to be<br/>\nmeleeing not at all. What&#39;s the point? I&#39;ll be doing maybe a sixth or an<br/>\neighth of the damage of the tanks, putting myself at risk of having my<br/>\nspells interrupted, and not medding up the mana that my tanks desperately<br/>\nneed.<br/>\n<br/>\nNope. There is no melee in my future, I suspect. Or at most, only enough to<br/>\nmax out my Defense skill, so as to keep my AC maxed. After that, I&#39;ll be<br/>\nstaring at the spellbook.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet&#39;s at least petition Verant to make the *&^%$# spellbook transparent, so<br/>\nwe can enjoy the battle during med! ^_^<br/>\n<br/>\n== Gilead Stonechapel, dwarven cleric of Brell (May his Name be forever<br/>\nblessed in the halls of stone!), Fennin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Rob Berryhill &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:racefan@...\">racefan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Wednesday, September 15, 1999 3:45 PM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [EQ-Clerics] the road less traveled...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Rob Berryhill&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:racefan@...\">racefan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The equipment is irrelevant since our Weapon skill lags so far behind.<br/>\n&gt;Regardless of the equipment you use, a high level cleric will miss quite<br/>\n&gt;often.

I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt;&gt; talking 115 str, 130 dex and 125 agi (and 85 sta), all wearable at the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; same time.

Which path should<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I follow? Some people argue that high level clerics CAN melee, while<br/>\n&gt;&gt; others argue that at high levels, clerics should concentrate on their<br/>\n&gt;&gt; healing and buffing skills. &quot;After all, if you wanted to be a warrior,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; you should have been one.&quot; Yeah, yeah, heard that, been there. With the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; right equipment, though (Jboots, a flowing black sash of haste, an<br/>\n&gt;&gt; observer&#39;s staff, etc.), a cleric should be able to hold his or her own<br/>\n&gt;&gt; in combat, even after level 35.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Any suggestions, comments, advice before I commit to one group of items<br/>\n&gt;&gt; or the other?<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Saidinn Witchwood<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    GRAB THE GATOR!
