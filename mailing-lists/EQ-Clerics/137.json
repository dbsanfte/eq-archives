That&#39;s what divine aura is for.  Divine aura is there to save<br/>\nyour ass.. and you can stay til the lasst minute with it.  Gate takes<br/>\nmuch longer to cast and doesn&#39;t seem nearly as reliable.  Here&#39;s what<br/>\nspells I keep memmed.<br/>\n<br/>\n(When fighting Undead)<br/>\nCenter (too lazy to take out and put back in.. saves time)<br/>\nInvis vs undead (play in unrest and you&#39;ll see why it&#39;s memmed)<br/>\nRoot (makes it easier for me to solo..  also helps me get away)<br/>\nSmite (never know when some normal monster will jump ya)<br/>\nFear (effective way to get those mobs off the casters.. and you)<br/>\nExpulse undead (self explanatory)<br/>\nDivine aura (i can heal til the end for my group and try to get any mobs<br/>\non me..  then once group is safe i can go divine aura and almost always<br/>\nmake it out alive.. along with my entire group)<br/>\nHealing (self explanatory)<br/>\n<br/>\n(When fighting normal stuff)<br/>\nCenter (same reason as above)<br/>\nFear (same as above)<br/>\nRoot (same as above)<br/>\nSoothe (keeps those pesky low lvl mobs from goin agro on ya)<br/>\nSmite (self explanatory)<br/>\nWord of Pain (does decent area dam for mana cost.. also can get ALL the<br/>\nmobs on you so group can escape if needed)<br/>\nDivine Aura  (same as above)<br/>\nHealing (same as above)<br/>\n<br/>\nI just can&#39;t see why some of you have so many DD spells in.  You&#39;re a<br/>\nCLERIC.  You are here to heal.. to keep the people alive.  The reason<br/>\nbehind your spells should be to keep the group alive and yourself. <br/>\nRemember that.  Only 2 people have died that I&#39;ve grouped with.  Both<br/>\nwere unavoidable.  (who can stop a train of 12, yes 12, angry mobs.. <br/>\nmost of which were yellow or red)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
