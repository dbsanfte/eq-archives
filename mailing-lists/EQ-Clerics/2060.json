Is that the same place you are talking about? I scoped it out this<br/>\nweekend while I was getting a Thex Mallet. There were 3 skels there, so I am<br/>\ngonna go back this weekend and camp it. I have heard that his placeholder is<br/>\nthe one on the left of the three spawns.

I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m hunting in the right place.  It&#39;s in<br/>\n&gt; the room next to the DE SK  (the left DE SK if you are facing as if you<br/>\n&gt; have just come through the wooden door opposite the hidden wall in the<br/>\n&gt; corridor) This spawn only spawns 3 times a day or so anyway so it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; sommat special.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Is there anything else I should be doing to trigger his spawn or am I<br/>\n&gt; just being very unlucky and who ever gets the other spawn each day is<br/>\n&gt; getting Babbinsbort?  Did people clear out the level just before he  was<br/>\n&gt; supposed to spawn? clear out the room? kill Gynok? kill Cmdr<br/>\n&gt; Windstream?  any ideas on triggers people cos this is driving me mad. :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And why are all our quests in zones where there is nothing else close to<br/>\n&gt; our level to hunt.. I wouldn&#39;t mind camping stuff if we could at least<br/>\n&gt; get xp while we were doing it.. oh well.. this is turning out to be more<br/>\n&gt; of a pain than the paw of opella was..<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Vinamin<br/>\n&gt; Son of Innoruuk<br/>\n&gt; Priest of The Lady<br/>\n&gt; Erollisi Marr<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
