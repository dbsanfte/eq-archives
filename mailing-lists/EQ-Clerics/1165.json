To put it<br/>\nbluntly, I got hammered. :) I managed to get my alcohol tolerance from 0 to<br/>\n60. I noticed that my STR and STA went up a little bit. I had previously<br/>\nheard that this was a warrior only effect, but now I know otherwise.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the last couple of days I worked on tolerance a bit more and maxed it for<br/>\nmy level (130 at 25). I am still unable to get the STR and STA boost without<br/>\ngetting too drunk to be useful. I am imagining a point at which I can slam<br/>\ndown a few meads before a battle and not fall over myself when I need to<br/>\ncast.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, I am beginning to find that when I&#39;m in a decent sized<br/>\nparty and we&#39;re hunting tough mobs, I stay out of danger so I can stick to<br/>\nhealing. I had always assumed that this would be the case, especially at<br/>\nhigher levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo is it worth continuing to work on alcohol tolerance? It certainly doesn&#39;t<br/>\ncost much (its actually a good way to get rid of some silver and copper :)<br/>\nand I&#39;m enjoying annoying my wizard friend with it. But is it going to be of<br/>\nany use to me?<br/>\n<br/>\nSalter<br/>\nFennin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
