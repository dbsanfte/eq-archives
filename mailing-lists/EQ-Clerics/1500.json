The first time the guy<br/>\ntried to attack me, even though i ran there with SoW.  I think however that<br/>\nsomone started the quest, but never finished it.  So the guy took it out on<br/>\nme. :)  When i got the SSoL the guy told me to talk to Whysia  in the Temple<br/>\nStore House about recharging it.   Where is this Temple Store House?  Anyway<br/>\nI just wanted to say thanks for all the previous help.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
