Keep Pinzarn, SoW, RM and your other resist<br/>\nlines up at all times on all your party (assuming you are in a high level<br/>\narea, such as the FGs, Planes, or Kedge.)  Your casters, especially<br/>\nEnchanters, will need those extra HPs and other buffs because when mobs get<br/>\nunmessed, they are really pissed at the chanters and attack em with a<br/>\nvengeance.  One little tip.....if you get multiple critters and a chanter<br/>\nhas messed, do NOT let anyone attack one of the messed ones until a tank has<br/>\nFIRST taunted it, to keep it off your chanter once you are ready to break<br/>\nits mess.<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to ignore our group heal (GH) spells cause the ratio of hps restored<br/>\nto mana cost was absurd.  Then they fixed Word of Health, to where it is a<br/>\nvery decent spell that restores a good amount of hps to all your party.<br/>\nWhen we do dragons, we have two clerics in each of our assault groups.  The<br/>\nclerics split up all the buffs along the way, and then when it&#39;s actually<br/>\ntime to assault the dragons, one of us will be responsible for GHs and the<br/>\nother for SH and CH.  I can get off 4 GHs before I am OOM.  This has saved<br/>\nour party more times than I can count at the dragons.  I have begun to keep<br/>\nGH and SH memmed at all times when there are two clerics in our group, and<br/>\nlet the other cleric handle SH and CHs.  We always call out what we are<br/>\ngoing to cast and on whom so we don&#39;t cross heal and waste mana, i.e. CH<br/>\nDonzi (which stands for Complete Heal Donzi), or GH (group heal), and we<br/>\nalways say what our mana level is at constantly.<br/>\n<br/>\nMik<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Sirensa Qi&#39;Seraph&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sirensa@...\">Sirensa@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, January 13, 2000 2:11 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] Seeking advice...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Sirensa Qi&#39;Seraph&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sirensa@...\">Sirensa@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Regarding playing a level 50 cleric:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Symbol buffs:<br/>\n&gt; Pinzam gem is a jasper (cost about 8gp or so depending on faction)<br/>\n&gt; Naltron gem is a peridot (cost about 11pp or so depending on faction)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Tanks NEED the extra HP&#39;s that Naltron brings for dragon runs, etc.  If<br/>\nyou<br/>\n&gt; cannot afford the gems, have them give you pp for them or bring some in<br/>\n&gt; advance.  (I Naltron everyone for dragons, but that is just me)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Regarding Reso and AOF:<br/>\n&gt; In extreme combat situation I will Shield of Words all the tanks<br/>\n&gt; (+AC/+defense) and AOF the casters.  If a 49+ druid is around and they<br/>\ndon&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; mind, they can cast Skin Like Nature (SLN) on tanks (does not stack with<br/>\n&gt; reso and reso and SLN will not over-write each other)  You will still need<br/>\n&gt; to cast your AC buff (SoW or AOF).  Druids can also help to cast the<br/>\nEndure<br/>\n&gt; cold/fire buffs.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Regarding Complete Heal:<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t use in dragon situations.  Occasionally I use on the planes,<br/>\ndungeon<br/>\n&gt; hunts and fire giant type runs, but ONLY on tanks with HP&#39;s over 2500 or<br/>\nso.<br/>\n&gt; Mana cost for C-Heal is 400 (versus 250 for Superior heal) and can save<br/>\nyou<br/>\n&gt; a bit of mana on high health point tank types.  If you do use it, it is<br/>\nbest<br/>\n&gt; if you start to cast when HP&#39;s drop to 2 bubbles.  You will get a feel for<br/>\n&gt; when you will have time to do this and when a superior heal is needed for<br/>\n&gt; the lower casting time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ~Sirensa<br/>\n&gt; Solusek Ro<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Get great offers on top-notch products that match your interests!<br/>\n&gt; Sign up for eLerts at:<br/>\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/elerts1\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/elerts1</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
