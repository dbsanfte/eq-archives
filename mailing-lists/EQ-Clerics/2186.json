This might be wrong , but<br/>\nI was told that it used to be every 7 hours but now they have changed it to<br/>\n2 spawns per day.   I waited a FULL 7 hours when I camped him, so if it is<br/>\nin fact 7 hours then I must have got there RIGHT after he died, and the<br/>\nplace was empty when I got there so I believe it is longer than 7 hours.<br/>\nI hate the camping quests... I guess that is Verant&#39;s idea of a good time.<br/>\n   I literally sat at his spawn site for 7 hours.   He is level 15 or so...<br/>\ngreen to me at 27.    It is a nice item though...<br/>\n<br/>\nIn part of their quest against camping, EQ set things up with a spawn<br/>\nrange. Not a specific time. the 7 hour spawn will have a time of, say, 5 to<br/>\n7 hours in which it will respawn. As far as I know, the longest spawn in<br/>\nthe game is something on the Shaman armour quest, with a maximum of 48<br/>\nhours between death and respawn.<br/>\n<br/>\nLareneg.
