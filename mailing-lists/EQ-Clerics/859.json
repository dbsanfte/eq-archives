I have<br/>\n5 dwarven tongues (the bandit tongues, and Rondo&#39;s tongue from CB) and<br/>\nI had them all in the bank, each taking up 5 slots.  I decided I would<br/>\nbuy a box, put them in the box, and then put them back.  Much to my<br/>\ndismay, when I put the box in the bank, it said I couldn&#39;t because<br/>\nevery tongue was now NODROP.  I wish they would fix that.  No I am<br/>\nforced to carry around these damned tongues everywhere.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Chas Watkins &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cwatkins@...\">cwatkins@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: &quot;&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&#39;&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: RE: [EQ-Clerics] but can they be looted????<br/>\n&gt;Date: Wed, 11 Aug 1999 16:21:50 -0700<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: Chas Watkins &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cwatkins@...\">cwatkins@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks for that, but now I&#39;m really confused. I must of misunderstood LORE<br/>\n&gt;items. I know you can have only one but I thought that made them no drop no<br/>\n&gt;trade. Can anyone please explain why an item, other than the newbie stuff<br/>\n&gt;and our summoned hammers might be No Drop. Or if they know of one.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Chas<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; With the introduction of LORE items. That is the No drop/No trade items.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Lore items aren&#39;t necessarily no drop/no trade.  My Mistmoore shield is<br/>\n&gt;a Lore item that I routinely bank, loan to my bard friend, etc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;As for when loot can be taken.  Yes, lore items can be taken; no, nodrop<br/>\n&gt;items cannot be taken.  And items can only be taken in a PvP venue; in a<br/>\n&gt;duel, there&#39;s no looting.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Congratulations to Molly Jones<br/>\n&gt;This week&#39;s FRIENDS & FAMILY WINNER!<br/>\n&gt;To enter, go to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html\">http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
