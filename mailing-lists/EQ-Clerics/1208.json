I beleive that RP&#39;ing worlds parallel the real world,<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; inthe real world, there are those who are poor, and need to beg for thier<br/>\n&gt; sustenance.  At the lower levels, I gained most of my armour and my money<br/>\n&gt; from begging.  Now I do it in a RP&#39;ing context, and not as &#39;Hey, got any<br/>\n&gt; free armour I can have?&#39;.  I think that this is a valid strategy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As well, now that I am entering the teens, I don&#39;t need to beg as often.<br/>\n&gt; But I do barter with players, and when doing so, I subtly make them<br/>\nbeleive<br/>\n&gt; that I am a poor cleric (which I really am). In doing so, I have made some<br/>\n&gt; great deals, and am able to get some good bargains on armour.  Last nite,<br/>\n&gt; for instance, I bought a bloodforge hammer for 15 pp, and a FS staff.<br/>\nFrom<br/>\n&gt; what I could see, they usually went for around 30 pp.  In my opionion, its<br/>\n&gt; no different than trading in ussed car and dressing down and making the<br/>\n&gt; saleperson beleive you are poorer than you really are.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Any other thoughts?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Show your ONElist SPIRIT!<br/>\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/tshirt2\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/tshirt2</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt; With a new ONElist SHIRT available through our website.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
