My weapon is really good now compared what I had before. This staff is 2h blunt, 11dmg, 35del and weighs 8.5lb. Not to mention it IS magical. So no need to conjure a second weapon for magic mobs.<br/>\nMy previous 1hb weapon was Morning star, bought from a NPC in Qeyons and I used both Runed Totem Staff and Fine Steel Great Staff ( FSGS is 36del 8.5lb but NOT magical, RTS is 37del 11lb, +5hp, +5mana and magical).<br/>\nI recommend that everyone of us develop both 1h blunt and 2h blunt skills. I don&#39;t know exactly what&#39;s the best 1h blunt weapon but I&#39;ve heard Screaming Mace is one of them and I&#39;m waiting to get to lvl 24 and see what kind of weapon is &quot;Hammer of Striking&quot;.<br/>\nI hope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nLevo<br/>\nBertox.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Kris Becan <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq-clerics@onelist.com\">eq-clerics@onelist.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Friday, June 25, 1999 11:49 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [EQ-Clerics] Level and Weapon Used.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m just wondering what everyone is using for a weapon at what levels?
