A spell you cast say before<br/>\n&gt;you fight and it works like the Bards heal song and heals you a little over<br/>\n&gt;time.  Have a icon the shows up like any buffs you have on a stay for 5-10<br/>\n&gt;mins.  Maybe later do a group heal spell like this one.  I&#39;m not saying to<br/>\n&gt;have to heal us or someone says a lot but just a little over time, maybe<br/>\n&gt;have a few, (depends on how many lvls they give us), and say the first one<br/>\n&gt;does 5 heal points so many secs, the next one does 20 every so many secs.<br/>\n&gt;Just an idea.  What do you all think on that idea?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;***************************<br/>\n&gt;Azor Spellbound<br/>\n&gt;Lvl 20 Human Cleric of The Rathe<br/>\n&gt;***************************<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
