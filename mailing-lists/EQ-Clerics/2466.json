","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1127201959\">Hi all,<br/>\n<br/>\nThe following is just a rant. Nothing of substance, just me venting about<br/>\nlast nites gameplay.  If you don&#39;t want to read it, feel free to skip.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRant.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, last nite was just one of those bad group experiences.  I have<br/>\nrecently decided to setup home in Unrest.  Granted, its a dangerous place<br/>\nfor a lvl 16 cleric, but I consider myself a decent enough playe, one who,<br/>\nin the words of Kenny Rogers, &#39;..knows when to hold, knows when to fold em,<br/>\nknows when to walk away, knows when to run...&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I start last nite, and within ten minutes have a full group going.  Thats<br/>\nwhat I love about Unrest, its so easy to get a group going.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways, we have 2 bards, an enchanter, a pally, and 2 clerics.  So we<br/>\nstart.  I am nominated as the puller, which i don&#39;t like, but what the heck.<br/>\nSo i pull the first few mobs.  Each time, we kill something, I immediately<br/>\nhere the &#39;ching-ching&#39; sound (looting) and see i receive a split of the<br/>\nmoney.  Of course, this is happening during the fighting, as opposed to the<br/>\nend.  So i mention that it would probably be wiser to wait till the fight<br/>\nwas over before looting, as the mobs in unrest are unruly, and any break in<br/>\nthe fighting could cost us our lives.  Plus, it would be nice to get a fair<br/>\nshare of the looting rights.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we pull more, and of course, more looting during fighting occurs.  This<br/>\ntime I am more adament about the looting.  I amthen told by our lowest level<br/>\nbard that she wants free for all looting.  I usually would agree that free<br/>\nfor all is ok, but I told her that it wouldn&#39;t be fair if only one person<br/>\ngot all the fine steel and bronze.  So we conclude that we will ffa the<br/>\nmoney, and alpha the bronze and FS.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext pull, we get a nasty train.  We stay to fight, and we are doing ok,<br/>\nuntil the clerics run out of mana. fortunately, we had killed a few, so we<br/>\ngot some good xp.  But the healing is about to end (oom) and we (the<br/>\nclerics) yell RUN-ZONE.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course no one listens, they keep fighting, the clerics make it out, two<br/>\nof the group die, and the others limp out with a bubble each.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe get blasted by the group... Why didn&#39;t you heal, you should have had your<br/>\nact together...  Well, we explain that the we can only heal for as much mana<br/>\nas we have, and when the clerics say run, its run time.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we regroup, and go back in.  Another train, this time the enchanter<br/>\ndecides he&#39;ll play tank when he goes OOM. We tell him to back off, but no,<br/>\nhe stays and fights, causing the clerics to wast mana on him for heals.  He<br/>\ndied, and of course, blames us.<br/>\n<br/>\nWash, rinse repeat.  More stupid group moves, more dying.  It ranged from<br/>\nlooting probs to players taking off to &#39;explore&#39; then dying.  And, we had<br/>\nthe people who were higher in level leave our group (we were abel to<br/>\nreplace, but anyone with a brain didn&#39;t stay in the group long).  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the end, I died once, but it was enough to wipe my Xp for the night, and<br/>\nI made a total of 3 gold ( i usually make 10pp).<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess the conclusion is this: Some players think clerics are a bottomless<br/>\npit of mana/healing, and any death in a group is always the result of the<br/>\ncleric not healing properly/fast enough.  My philosophy is tanks first,<br/>\neveryone else next, me last. I&#39;ll tell you this, I now know who not to group<br/>\nwith in Unrest, or anywhere else for that matter.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBrytewing, 16th Cleric of the Rathe.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
