<div id="ygrps-yiv-841370405">I agree.<br/>
<br/>
 The past three nights I have been floating between lvl 11 and lvl 12 in<br/>
befallen.  The trains can just be too tough.  And on the Rathe, there are<br/>
rarely enough players to help you out of a pinch when that train of dread<br/>
bones, greater skels, zombies and ghouls come running by!  Not to mention<br/>
the fact that you have to be extremely careful not to fall down those<br/>
winding and rocky stairs as you are trying to run back to safety, else you<br/>
are toast!<br/>
<br/>
I am not returning there until at least lvl 14, and even then, I will think<br/>
twice.<br/>

&quot;Go to Befallen.  It&#39;s a great place for a cleric your level [level 9].<br/>
I spent levels<br/>
9 - 16 in Befallen in beta and had a blast.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Go to Befallen as a level 9 cleric? HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!<br/>
<br/>
Oh my, that was a good one Mikaela. *shakes head in friendly disbelief*<br/>
:)<br/>

Wixn, PLEASE don&#39;t go to Befallen until you are at least level 15, and<br/>
have an experienced group with you. Even then, you will most likely find<br/>
yourself spending many happy hours trying to recover your corpse. The<br/>
problem is that you will quickly get bored with the first level, and<br/>
will convince yourself that the lower levels can&#39;t be all that bad.<br/>
Well, they are. And the loot isn&#39;t all that great, either.<br/>
<br/>
Trust me, I have many friends who swear they will never return to that<br/>
place. And these people are good players.<br/>

P.S. I know there are probably some of you out there who actually love<br/>
Befallen, but PLEASE, can we at least agree that Wixl shouldn&#39;t go to<br/>
Befallen until at least level 15?<br/>
<br/>
P.P.S No hard feelings, Mikaela :)</div>
