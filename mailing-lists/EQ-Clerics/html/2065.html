<b>Subject:</b> New items in Kithicor <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1612366322">Weird things have been going on in Kithicor since the Plane of Hate opened<br/>
this weekend (at least on Brell Serilis). There are many high-level undead<br/>
creatures (30+ skels) roaming there at night now from what I hear. Also,<br/>
they seem to be dropping some pretty decent items for Clerics. Here are 2<br/>
that a friend of mine has found already:<br/>
<br/>
Tainted Teir&#39;Dal Great Staff<br/>
MAGIC NODROP<br/>
Damage 16, Delay 42, Weight 7.5<br/>
+3 WIS, +3 INT, -5 Disease<br/>
WAR, CLR, SHD, DRU, MNK, SHM, NEC, WIZ, MAG, ENC<br/>
ALL<br/>
<br/>
Tainted Battleworn Morning Star<br/>
MAGIC NODROP<br/>
Damage 7, Delay 30, Weight 9.0<br/>
+6 WIS, -5 Disease<br/>
WAR, CLR, PAL, RNG, SHD, DRU, MNK, BRD, ROG, SHM<br/>
ALL<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t been to Kithicor since PoH opened, but I am excited to see some<br/>
more action in an otherwise dead zone. Good thing I got Turgan&#39;s Note and<br/>
the Ingot before they added all the baddies ;)<br/>
