<div id="ygrps-yiv-672997635">It&#39;s off of the zone Dagnor&#39;s Cauldron, which is off of Butcher Block in Faydwer.   You CAN go there at level 13 with a group and kill yard trash for pretty good xp, but the trains there are really nasty.  I didn&#39;t really do all that well in unrest until around level 24 when I got greater healing and dismiss undead.  At that point, I was able to camp a room inside the house with relative ease.  It&#39;s a great zone for loot as well as xp because most all of the monsters above the yard trash carry fine steel weapons, and a few have small bronze armor pieces.   This zone is especially good for us clerics since about 90% of the monsters there are undead.<br/>
