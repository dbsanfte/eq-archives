<div id="ygrps-yiv-1938978534">So Runnyeye is a good place for say a Lvl 15-16?  If so I might go there<br/>
instade of Unrest, or maybe go to both, just take turns one day go to<br/>
Runnyeye the next go to Unrest or so.  I would really love to get my hands<br/>
on some blackened armor or any good armor, all I have right now is leather<br/>
and a good hat, not sure what it is.<br/>
