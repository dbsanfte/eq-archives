<b>Subject:</b> Meditation change? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-876450764">I was wondering what the proper procedure was to petition for a change.   I<br/>
do not know about the rest of you but I feel that clerics should get<br/>
meditate at six and not have to wait until eight for it.  My seventh level<br/>
cleric spends a lot of time just sitting waiting for mana for restore.   It<br/>
is really glaring when you are grouped with spell casters and after the<br/>
battle you heal them up and then have to sit for five or ten minutes to get<br/>
your mana back when they are ready to go again in just two or three minutes.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know your feelings on this and I will try to get it started if there<br/>
is enough support and if not then I will just live with it the way it is.<br/>
<br/>
On a side note a very strange thing happened to me this morning.   I was<br/>
hunting in Butcherblock and ran out of food.   Rather than making the long<br/>
run back to Felwithe for more food I decided to gate.   I got a message<br/>
about that zone being down and that they would put me in a safe place within<br/>
my zone.   The safe place ended up just outside the dwarf city and I was<br/>
near the GF zone point, but that is not the problem.   Everything except<br/>
keyboard locked up tight.   I could not use my mouse to do anything at all.<br/>
No casting, no sitting, no selling or buying and worst of all no camping to<br/>
escape that mess and of course no GM&#39;s or Guides around.   I could not even<br/>
do a soft boot to escape and ended up doing a hard re-boot.     I suppose<br/>
that maybe I could have tried to get back to the GF zone point and try to<br/>
zone out to see if that cleared it up but my defensive spells were about to<br/>
wear off and I could not refresh them.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks all for listening to my rantings,</div>
