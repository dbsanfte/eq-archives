<div id="ygrps-yiv-2087105999">From what you say, I imagine that you have not played in any other universe.<br/>
Let me tell you that compared to some other universes (and one comes to<br/>
mind) EQ is extremely well balanced and fun to play. No, in it you can not<br/>
get all the super gear at level 1. Thank the gods for that.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I give the game 3-4 years(at least). Ohh, I dont expect to see<br/>
the same number of people next year and the one after. Most likely there<br/>
will be a syphoning from other games but I dont see it as dying anytime<br/>
soon.<br/>
<br/>
As for another comment somewhere else about Fennin being overcrowded. I play<br/>
on Cazic Thule and find it is fairly decent most places. There are a few<br/>
zones where all the jerks go to and I keep away from those. But there are<br/>
also some where people are extremely decent and helpful. What I have noticed<br/>
is that power gamers seem to generally belong to the first category.<br/>
<br/>
Well, that was my 2cp worth. And now let me get my fire suit as protection<br/>
for my last paragraph &lt;G&gt;<br/>

The real shame about a game like EQ is that once it&#39;s gone no one can play<br/>
anymore.  Guess it&#39;s one of the drawbacks to massively multiplayer games...<br/>
<br/>
I hope it isn&#39;t dying any time soon.<br/>

&gt;I&#39;ve been reading on the EQ newsgroup that a good bit of ppl think EQ is<br/>
&gt;already starting to die.  Many are just bored of the game and are quiting<br/>
&gt;or<br/>
&gt;getting ready to, others are getting tired of Verant changing everything<br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;some of it is for the worse.  I&#39;ve read where they are saying it&#39;s too late<br/>
&gt;to save EQ, some even say even the new addon will not save it cause it&#39;ll<br/>
&gt;still be the same game with just some new things.  And yeah it might spice<br/>
&gt;it up a bit, but for how long, I give it 3-4 months tops.  After 3-4 months<br/>
&gt;the power gamers will already have the extra lvls, everyone should have<br/>
&gt;been<br/>
&gt;in all the new zones, had a chance to play the new lizardman race.  So once<br/>
&gt;that happens it&#39;s gonna be right back to where it is now.<br/>
&gt;Some are waiting for Asheron&#39;s Call and others are waiting for Middle-Earth<br/>
&gt;to be released.  Will AC or ME finish off EQ?  I guess time will tell but<br/>
&gt;since theres like 3-4 other RPGs coming out by the year 2000 I say one of<br/>
&gt;them will put an end to EQ.  And if EQ does die to fast it&#39;s no ones fault<br/>
&gt;but Verants for not listening to the paying customers, they listen to a few<br/>
&gt;but not the whole.<br/>
&gt;Even tho EQ is a very good game it can&#39;t or won&#39;t be around forever.<br/>
