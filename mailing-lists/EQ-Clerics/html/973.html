<b>Subject:</b> What wisdom increasing items are available? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-193927965">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I am a level 10 halfling cleric of Bristlebane, Brytewing on the Rathe<br/>
server.  I have spent my life in Rivervale, Misty Thicket, and am now<br/>
venturing into RunneyEye with small groups.<br/>
<br/>
My question is this:  I have heard alot of talk about wisdom increaing<br/>
items.  However, I have yet to see any in my gameplaying experiences.  Could<br/>
some of you more experienced players give me a hint as to what items<br/>
increase wisdom, and perhaps where I could best find them?<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks.</div>
