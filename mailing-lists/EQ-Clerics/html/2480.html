<div id="ygrps-yiv-83560668">Donzi paid 1000 plat for my gator leggins on The Rathe about 6 weeks ago.  I<br/>
think the price was a bit high, but the time and aggravation to do the camp<br/>
is worse.  It&#39;s easier for us to just go kill ogre guards where at least we<br/>
are safe and get experience, and make the 1000 plat, than to sit and camp<br/>
the stupid croc, IF it&#39;s not camped, which most of the time it is.<br/>

&gt; I am trying to get some gator leggings on Erollisi Marr.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am willing to buy or trade but I have yet to meet anyone with a<br/>
reasonable<br/>
&gt; offer.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What would be a good plat amount for them, and what would be a reasonable<br/>
&gt; trade for them?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have heard they go for 600 plat. I also tried trading a plat armband and<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; Black Pearl Choker, and the guy would even return my replys.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I do have a extra charred guardian shield, but I do not feel that it<br/>
should<br/>
&gt; be a straight trade (leggings for shield).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Any help is (as always) greatly appreciated,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
