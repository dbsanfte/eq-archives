<div id="ygrps-yiv-236075606">I really don&#39;t care about how hard the items are to get, after all... it is<br/>
a quest. Altho one might rightfully think that our armor quests should be no<br/>
harder or easier than other classes. My gripe is the lack of experience<br/>
connected to the quests. And not just the fact that we don&#39;t get exp for<br/>
completing a quest like most other classes do, but also the fact that for<br/>
many (most?) people tryin to do the quest, there&#39;s no exp to be had while<br/>
you&#39;re sitting around waiting. For many (again, most?) of us, most of the<br/>
quest stuff is in the middle of a mass of green mobs.<br/>
<br/>
As I see it, there are really only two explanations for the difiiculty of<br/>
our quests compared to other classes... the lack of exp connected to our<br/>
quests compared to other classes... and Verant&#39;s lack of action to make<br/>
adjustments (or to be more accurate, Verant&#39;s deceptiveness about what they<br/>
would be doing and when. I interpretted some of their statements weeks ago<br/>
to mean that this patch would have adjustments. And I know others did as<br/>
well).<br/>
<br/>
1. They are inept. (heh, seems that way sometimes, but more likely it&#39;s....)<br/>
<br/>
2. They are doing it intentially to some end. If you buy into this<br/>
explanation, then there can be only one reason they would intentionally nerf<br/>
(for lack of a better EQ word) our quests. They have some reason for wanting<br/>
to slow down mid to high lev clerics. Why? Dunno... maybe they want to keep<br/>
down the availability of lev 49 res casters? And what better way to keep<br/>
someone from getting to 49 as fast as they might than by sending them off on<br/>
some less than useful armor quest that could well keep them from leveling<br/>
for weeks? Dunno... maybe they think we&#39;re overpowered or too well balanced<br/>
and see this as a less than obvious way to nerf us a bit? Whatever their<br/>
reasoning, I&#39;m convinced it&#39;s being done for a reason. And I don&#39;t really<br/>
expect to see any changes of any significance, so I&#39;m content to spend my<br/>
time leveling so I can get some plane armor before they nerf that even more.<br/>
