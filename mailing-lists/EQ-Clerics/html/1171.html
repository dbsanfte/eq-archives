<div id="ygrps-yiv-1004986304"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;But wait. We&#39;re clerics. Shouldn&#39;t we be able to wear vestments on special<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah I wish we could wear clothing other than newbie(naked) or stuff that<br/>
looks just like it.<br/>
<br/>
I love just wandering around newbie areas preforming random acts of<br/>
goodness, and I rarely feel like the humble priest wandering amoung the<br/>
people dressed in full banded with my hammer et cetera...<br/>
<br/>
I would love to be able to just wear a white robe with armour underneath<br/>
it... <br/>
or a tabard....wouldn&#39;t that be cool, with the symbol of your god on it??<br/>
<br/>
Imagine a party of Clerics and Paladins dressed in blinding white robes and<br/>
tabards, wading into a pile of undead.... (yeah yeah, white don&#39;t last too<br/>
long in combat....but still!)<br/>
