<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1653812403">It sounds to me like you are right on track.  I&#39;m 15th now, but at 9th<br/>
I was in full leather, and was until around 12th when a halfling<br/>
fighter friend of mine retired his character (he was around 12th) and<br/>
he gave me all his small ringmail pieces.  So aside from boots, gloves<br/>
hat, and no face piece, I have ringmail and a few banded pieces. And<br/>
an SBS shield from Crushbone.  I also did get the 2 rings you got, but<br/>
had to pay 4 plat a piece for them, which is what it costs to make<br/>
them.  At 9th, you should be able to fight at the Chessboard with<br/>
one other person, preferably a tank.  You would be safe using ward<br/>
undead till about half of your mana, and then heals for the rest.  The<br/>
tank will need to be patient with you, as you will need to med a lot.<br/>
It&#39;s also about time to make the trip to Qeynos to get a Shining Star<br/>
of Light, and while you&#39;re there, pick up Trumpy Irontoe&#39;s head.  I<br/>
think I was 11th or 12th when I made this trip.  Be forewarned though,<br/>
killing Trumpy _really_ lowers faction with circleofunseenhands and<br/>
corruptqeynosguards.  I have to be careful now.  There are two taverns<br/>
in Qeynos that have KOS people to me, and the corrupt guards walking<br/>
around Qeynos are &#39;dubious&#39; to me now.  These are both great weapons<br/>
and should be gotten as soon as possible.  Trumpy is an easy kill.<br/>
He was green to me when I killed him.  I saw him wandering around the<br/>
pier area.<br/>
  One other note, just as it takes clerics a little while to get used<br/>
to the idea of being a straight-healer, it also takes melee classes<br/>
a while to learn to respect our need to meditate.  I can&#39;t tell you<br/>
the number of times a bored bard or fighter said, &#39;let&#39;s go&#39; when I<br/>
was at 50% mana and regretted it later.<br/>
  And I mentioned that I&#39;m 15th, and those 2 rings are still the only<br/>
stat enhancing items I have as well.  Aside from the +2 disease save<br/>
necklace and the SBS shield and bloodforge hammers +10 sv magic.<br/>
  All the good stat enhancing stuff is on like 20th level mobs.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and another thing that not many people know, the skeletons at the<br/>
first part of Steamfont (right when you enter Steamfont) were blue to<br/>
me at 15th (so were undead pawns).  And they give much better loot.<br/>
You have to be very careful though, as they will help each other out<br/>
if they see you in combat with another one.  But keep this in mind if<br/>
the chessboard is camped.<br/>

&gt;I have been following this thread with considerable interest.  I am running<br/>
&gt;a high elf cleric on Erollisi Marr who is currently nine.  My problem is<br/>
&gt;that is hard to get into a group since a lot still want to solo at this age<br/>
&gt;level and the groups that do offer want to either go to Crushbone or like<br/>
&gt;today to the Chessboard.   When I have grouped I try to aid in melee and<br/>
&gt;still watch the health of the party members.  I do not use Furor at all in<br/>
&gt;combat saving my mana for healing and buffing only.  I have also had a <br/>
&gt;group<br/>
&gt;not give me a chance to med back to even 50% before starting to fight <br/>
&gt;again.<br/>
&gt;Another problem of course is that once I begin to heal the mob starts<br/>
&gt;beating on me and they cannot pull it off.  I try not to fight back when<br/>
&gt;this happens to give them a chance to get it off me though.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I did manage to purchase a couple of 2 wisdom rings today for a total of<br/>
&gt;2pp.  These are the first stat enhancing items I have gotten.  As usual I <br/>
&gt;am<br/>
&gt;almost completely broke now after buying my ninth level spells and the<br/>
&gt;rings.   I am still wearing a mixture of leather, PW and cloth armor and<br/>
&gt;using a cracked staff in combat.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am open to any and all suggestions that you elders my wish to impart upon<br/>
&gt;me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thank you,<br/>
&gt;Yilari<br/>

&gt; &gt; Yes, Anne, I agree that first and foremost we are and should be healers.<br/>
&gt; &gt; THAT is our primary role in EQ.  But as I said in my previous post,  <br/>
&gt;there<br/>
&gt; &gt; are opportunities for you to get to melee even in a group, you just have<br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt; &gt; know when NOT to melee but sit and med.  If I&quot;m FM and they just pulled <br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt; &gt; critter, and I know they have to get down to 2 bubbs of health before I<br/>
&gt;heal<br/>
&gt; &gt; with complete healing, I&#39;m not gonna just sit or stand there and watch <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt; battle.  The key is knowing WHEN you get to and stay at melee, WHEN you<br/>
&gt;use<br/>
&gt; &gt; your DD spells, and WHEN you sit down and do your heal and med routine.<br/>
&gt;Not<br/>
&gt; &gt; a single one of my group has EVER questioned me when I get to melee or<br/>
&gt;cast<br/>
&gt; &gt; a dd spell.  They trust me and know that I will not let them die because <br/>
&gt;I<br/>
&gt; &gt; am not watching their hps or don&#39;t have mana to heal them or don&#39;t know<br/>
&gt;WHEN<br/>
&gt; &gt; to heal them.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;  I know one cleric whose tank died in the Avatar Room in Cazic because <br/>
&gt;he<br/>
&gt; &gt; (the cleric)  didn&#39;t want to &quot;waste&quot; any mana on a complete heal and<br/>
&gt;waited<br/>
&gt; &gt; til the tank was at 1 bubble before he began to cast, and then his spell<br/>
&gt; &gt; fizzled.  The tank was NOT happy and would not group with him anymore.  <br/>
&gt;I<br/>
&gt; &gt; also &quot;grew up&quot; so to speak with a cleric/wizard wannabe, who didn&#39;t want<br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt; &gt; do anything but nuke with his dd spells.  In fact, he even specialized <br/>
&gt;in<br/>
&gt; &gt; Evocation instead of Alteration so he could save mana on his dd spells.  <br/>
&gt;I<br/>
&gt; &gt; got tired of grouping with him because I couldn&#39;t depend on him as a<br/>
&gt;back-up<br/>
&gt; &gt; cleric for healing cause he never had any mana cause he was always <br/>
&gt;nuking.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; A cleric who doesn&#39;t learn these &quot;Whens&quot; early on will not be effective.<br/>
&gt; &gt; It&#39;s called Learning How To Be A Cleric 101, with advanced courses as <br/>
&gt;you<br/>
&gt; &gt; get older.  If a group member dies because you didn&#39;t heal him/her on<br/>
&gt;time,<br/>
&gt; &gt; or didn&#39;t have mana to heal cause you were meleeing or throwing<br/>
&gt;Retributions<br/>
&gt; &gt; around like they were a 50 mana cost spell, then shame on ya and you<br/>
&gt;should<br/>
&gt; &gt; go play another class cause you simply don&#39;t understand what clerics are<br/>
&gt;all<br/>
&gt; &gt; about and how to play them.<br/>
