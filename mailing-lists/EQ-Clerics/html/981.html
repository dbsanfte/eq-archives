<b>Subject:</b> AC vs Stat enhancing armor <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-39304130">Hail all,<br/>
<br/>
This question most likely has been asked already and I apologize if I&#39;m<br/>
repeating but I am new to the list and rather new to casting class in<br/>
general.<br/>
<br/>
My question is, which is better, pure AC or stat enchancing armor?  I was<br/>
thinking of covering myself fully in bronze plate but there are things like<br/>
BS tunic, barb arms, silver plated bracers that I will be putting aside.  I<br/>
am playing mostly a casting cleric...and I figured AC would save my life<br/>
more then any stat enhancing armor.  Any thoughts?<br/>
