<div id="ygrps-yiv-1245966648"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;This might be a silly plead for advice but here it is...I am restarting my<br/>
&gt;cleric on a new server.  My old cleric is a high elf female.  I am torn<br/>
&gt;between restarting as a dark elf or stick with the high elf.  Which in<br/>
&gt;y&#39;all&#39;s opinion...looks better?  I have never seen a dark elf in the purple<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not sure about the elves. I took a dwarven cleric because when they are in<br/>
bronze armour, they look like a renegade pumpkin. Actually, my guild has a<br/>
betting pool going right now about what I&#39;ll look like in the new armour.<br/>
So far, the smart money is &quot;Bloated eggplant&quot;</div>
