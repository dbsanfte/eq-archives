<div id="ygrps-yiv-1415801767">The line about how you have to be close to 30 to do them... I think this was intentional... Most classes you have to be fairly high level to do them, and I think for the Paladin armor you have to be a little higher still.   Really, that&#39;s how it should be... the armor should be a high level thing.  Kind of something to show that you have made it that far.  However, the armor should be WORTH getting, and as you and others have pointed out it really isn&#39;t.... ((Bah, intelligence in my legs!! &lt;continues Topaaz&#39;s rant&gt;))    =)<br/>

&gt; um no pammy my day will not come =0), for one reason only I REFUSE to do the <br/>
&gt; quests!!! also i NEVER laugh at another&#39;s misfortune ( hmm not to say that i <br/>
&gt; dont laugh at you in general sweety) but folks Pam raises all valid points, <br/>

&gt; &gt;Count me in on the sit in!  Although some of the<br/>
&gt; &gt;cleric items seem decent enough, the simple fact that<br/>
&gt; &gt;we are expected to watch for ground spawns disgust me!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;The first time I waited for a ground spawn, I was in<br/>
&gt; &gt;Kithicor (this was before all the undead was<br/>
&gt; &gt;introduced there).  I had been sitting all by my<br/>
&gt; &gt;lonely for 3 hours (at least) and nothing happened.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Unfortunately, I had to run afk.  By the time I got<br/>
&gt; &gt;back there was a /tell from someone saying that they<br/>
&gt; &gt;picked up the item while passing through.  BAH.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Last night we were hunting undead in Kithicor.  It was<br/>
&gt; &gt;morning in the game and I decided to check that spot<br/>
&gt; &gt;since our &quot;puller&quot; said it looked like a bag was<br/>
&gt; &gt;sitting on the ground.  Well, I got excited and ran<br/>
&gt; &gt;over there.  Heh, not a good idea, i tell ya... Even<br/>
&gt; &gt;tho most of the mobs in kith con blue to me, they are<br/>
&gt; &gt;horrible to even attempt to solo.  Needless to say I<br/>
&gt; &gt;got splattered to the ground and lost my level.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Happened the second time too!  (no laughing at me<br/>
&gt; &gt;Topaaz, your day will come as mine did!)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I have also died in MistMoore while waiting for the<br/>
&gt; &gt;ground spawn in there and I cant even attempt to find<br/>
&gt; &gt;the named gobbo in the Cauldron without a druid with<br/>
&gt; &gt;me.  To this day I haven&#39;t any of my ingots or icons.<br/>
&gt; &gt;I dont feel like dedicating weeks of time just for<br/>
&gt; &gt;ground staring.  Although I would love the added AC, I<br/>
&gt; &gt;feel that my wisdom enhancing clothing will have to do<br/>
&gt; &gt;for now.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; here here, well said Jeff, i agree i want more<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; wisdom.  i refuse to do the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; quests, as far as im concerned AAC is useless to me<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; in comparison to the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; wisdom i need, legs with intel=rediculas!!! plain<br/>
