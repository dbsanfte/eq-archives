<div id="ygrps-yiv-1221165142">&quot;Game days&quot; consists of only a few hours of real life.  That, indeed, is<br/>
impossible.  10 Real Days to 30 *is* entirely possible, however.  I reached<br/>
level 21 in 6 days played and I did it with only 60pp given to me and no<br/>
other help.  I was purposely power-leveling because my regular group needed<br/>
me to catch them since we are unable to find a cleric that actually knows<br/>
how to play a cleric.  They seem to all want to be battle mages!  We even<br/>
grouped with two clerics that did not even have ANY heal spells memorized!<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Talking about days played, this reminds me of the discussion we had<br/>
&gt; on here a while back about twinking a character to level 20.  Someone<br/>
&gt; mentioned that it could be done in 10 game days.  Others believed<br/>
&gt; that that would be nearly impossible.<br/>
&gt;   I have a 12th level cleric (just made 12th last night) and I have<br/>
&gt; been playing for 5 game days.  Now I spend a great deal of time doing<br/>
&gt; &quot;crap&quot; in terms of experience - raising skills, swimming, raising<br/>
&gt; sense-heading, fishing, exploring, doing quests, etc.  Basically just<br/>
&gt; having fun with the game.  I came across a Druid that was around 9th<br/>
&gt; or 10th when I first grouped with her.  I think at the time I was<br/>
&gt; probably 10th level.  I added her to my friends list.  When I saw her<br/>
&gt; again, she was 16th - I removed her from my friends list knowing I<br/>
&gt; would probably never get to group with her again as she had outleveled<br/>
&gt; me.  Last time I saw her was week before last and she was 19th.<br/>
&gt;   So, I guess my point is, if you&#39;re very aggressive and fight a lot<br/>
&gt; of monsters steadily, you can really level rapidly.  This would<br/>
&gt; obviously have to be someone that&#39;s a very experienced player cause<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s hard to otherwise know where to go and what to do.  Relative<br/>
&gt; newcomers, like myself, are more intrigued just by exploring and<br/>
&gt; doing quests than by just hardcore leveling.<br/>
