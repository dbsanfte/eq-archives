<div id="ygrps-yiv-2104772897"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Are there any other DE clerics out there who are<br/>
&gt; struggling a little with the duplicity of our natures?<br/>
&gt;  Evil, yet healing?  Yeah, I know, I could take the<br/>
&gt; notion that evil people are good to other evil people,<br/>
&gt; but that seems almost like a cop out...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Dark Elves worship Innoruuk, the god of hate. Hate does not necessarily<br/>
preclude healing. The only real contradiction as far as clerics and their<br/>
gods go, is Bertoxxulous, the plaguebringer.<br/>
<br/>
Gnomes and humans default to him because the list is in alphabetic order and<br/>
he is highest in their list of choices. This is why at the character<br/>
selection screen gnome and human clerics have the &#39;evil&#39; background. It also<br/>
explains why the gnome cleric guild master hangs out at the necromancer<br/>
(gnome necros must follow Bertoxxulous) guild, buffing the decaying<br/>
skeletons that wander the mines of malfunction.<br/>
