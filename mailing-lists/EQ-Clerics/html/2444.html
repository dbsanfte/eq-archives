<div id="ygrps-yiv-739545226">well, it is a fairly decent weapon...i think the dmg is 6 tho.....but other than<br/>
that, it&#39;s a nice weapon, and you&#39;ll want a magical weapon when you start going<br/>
to dungeons like unrest and the like....and the yaulp on the mace does help in<br/>
soloing....at least imho it does...but keep in mind that your spells are also<br/>
very helpful....(: just my 2cp worth<br/>

&gt; Hi,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am considering buying a Screaming Mace.  Right now I have a BloodForge<br/>
&gt; Hammer, whic does great dmg, but is slow and heavy.  I also find I am<br/>
&gt; soloing less, so I want a 1H that I can use my SBS with.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My current 1H blunt is a FS Mace, which has 8dmg, and rougly the same dly as<br/>
&gt; the Screaming Mace.  Its wt is 10.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Other than the magical effects, is there any advantage to buying one? Or<br/>
&gt; should I save my money?<br/>
