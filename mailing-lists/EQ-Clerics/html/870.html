<div id="ygrps-yiv-773678352">I play on Rallos Zek and I have always found Stun to be a waste of time you<br/>
need the Mana.<br/>
<br/>
Some suggestions. Flash of light is an awesome little tool, if it works. Its<br/>
fast and uses little mana. He also has cure blindness and he would be stupid<br/>
to not have it memorized. If he is a lower level it can last a reasonable<br/>
time.<br/>
However if you use blindness move behind him to add to the disorientation.<br/>
<br/>
Use a one handed weapon if you can. The faster hit times will help keep his<br/>
spells interrupted.<br/>
<br/>
My suggestion and it is only one possible tactic is stick to blindness,<br/>
cancel magic and healing. Your offensive spells really are not that good<br/>
mana/damage wise.<br/>
<br/>
Blind then get in close and hit him with your club. He will try and DOT you<br/>
and slow you down with spells. Then bash the hell out of you. Keep hitting<br/>
till you are half down on mana. Then blind and heal yourself. Your heal<br/>
spells are far better mana efficiency. Then keep hitting. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck and let us know how it goes. If you are two levels higher than him<br/>
and can&#39;t take him. Then you have a problem. One is risky. At the same I<br/>
would favor the Shaman. But clever tactics might win the day for you.<br/>

Stun and flash of light to distract; furor to do the nuking?  <br/>
