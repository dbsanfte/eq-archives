<div id="ygrps-yiv-155485100">actually....IPX is used in a lot more than just &quot;old netware networks&quot;  Most<br/>
modern netware networks, Small networks in general and peer to peer systems<br/>
use IPX ALOT.  Ipx also being one of the best protocols to play LAN games<br/>
over.......if the person has a winmodem....yeah this will effect it even<br/>
more....but if they have a winmodem they are S.O.L. anyways....<br/>

If your lag meter is fine, but you&#39;re getting pauses like this, it points to<br/>
your PC config.<br/>
A few things to try:<br/>
 <br/>
1. Do you have a resident virus checker and what are its settings? Or do you<br/>
have some other kind of scheduled CPU/disk/memory hog?<br/>
2. Do you have IPX drivers installed? I used to get a bad pausing problem in<br/>
all games. It went away when I uninstalled the IPX drivers (I didn&#39;t really<br/>
need them and you probably don&#39;t unless you run on an old Netware network).<br/>
3. Before you run EQ, reboot and clear your taskbar of resident stuff.</div>
