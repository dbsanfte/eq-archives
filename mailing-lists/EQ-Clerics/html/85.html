<div id="ygrps-yiv-155338086">the plate he was probably talking about is green splinted platemail..<br/>
only setback to it is that it is VERY rare and is only wearable by human<br/>
sized characters.  but..  it does have very high AC and magical<br/>
bonuses.. not to mention that it&#39;s EXTREMELY light.  the gauntlets alone<br/>
on it have 12 ac and like +10 str..  and that&#39;s just for the hands.  one<br/>
can only imagine what the breasplate gives.  even monks can wear this<br/>
plate..  weird huh.  In my opinion, this platemail should be available<br/>
to all sizes, not just the human sized players.  kinda sucks to be a<br/>
large or small race.  EQ has done some very screwd up things.  Clerics<br/>
get stiffed a ton.</div>
