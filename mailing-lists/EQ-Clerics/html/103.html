&gt;Hi, I just bought EQ (my friends talked me into it)<br/>
&gt;and they wanted me to play a Cleric - which fortunately<br/>
&gt;is what I always play anyway because I like them.  I read<br/>
&gt;through some of the archives here, and I have a few<br/>
&gt;questions:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What is the best race for the cleric?  I made a high-elf.<br/>
&gt;Are they good?  It seemed to have the highest wisdom.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It looks like strength is really important?  What is a<br/>
&gt;good minimum strength.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;thanks for the help.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
