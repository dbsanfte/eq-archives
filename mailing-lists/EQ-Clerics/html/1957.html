<b>Subject:</b> game enhancements maybe change for cleric quests? =) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-893422352">*General Enhancements*<br/>
<br/>
- If a user is killed due to self-inflicted spell or melee damage,<br/>
experience will be lost.<br/>
- When using a levitation spell, players are now vulnerable to attack from<br/>
both waterbound and landbound creatures.<br/>
- A number of enhancements have been made to balance the class specific<br/>
armor quests implemented last week.<br/>
- A bug was resolved which resulted in a quest reward not being given<br/>
approximately 1 percent of the time. - This has been fixed.<br/>
<br/>
***************<br/>
Hopefully this means a decrease in spawn time!!!   Not sure if game is back<br/>
up from patch yet... but if anyone confirms what &quot;A number of enhancements<br/>
have been made to balance the class specific armor quests implemented last<br/>
week&quot; means specifically, I would love to know!<br/>
