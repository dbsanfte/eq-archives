<div id="ygrps-yiv-232027784">Today while killing Aviaks in South Karana with a friend, we were sitting<br/>
and medding up and out of the blue 2-3 Aviaks Avo&#39;s came over and started<br/>
beating the crap out of us.  Needless to say we both died, thing is I<br/>
thought Aviaks only attacked when attacked or when they saw you attacking<br/>
another one?  If so how come they came up and attacked us when all we were<br/>
doing was sitting and medding?<br/>
