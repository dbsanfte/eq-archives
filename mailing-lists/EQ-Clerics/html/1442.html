<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;ok....have any of you seen this piece of CRAP?!?!  I can not beleive they<br/>
 </span></blockquote>put this into the game to be &gt;honest....because well, in my opinion, even<br/>
if it IS hard to get....more will fall, and as more come....it &gt;devalues<br/>
the cleric.<br/>
<br/>
Actually I thought this was a very nice staff to be honest.  I was a<br/>
participant in the slaying of Vox when she dropped this staff.  I was<br/>
hoping to be offered a chance to acquire it, but understood why it was<br/>
deemed that a non cleric character should receive, since clerics could res<br/>
themselves.  So far, I only know of one of these staves on The Rathe<br/>
server, and Vox has been killed multiple times.  I am sure that more will<br/>
come, but how soon before it happens?  An item such as this HARDLY devalues<br/>
the cleric, if anything it will show the wielder a true appreciation of the<br/>
pinnacle of our power.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;The effect is 10 charges of RES.  Now, if this can be recharged.....you<br/>
 </span></blockquote>have a nice staff to pull your ass out &gt;of the fire and dont need that<br/>
cleric anymore.....Clerics, Palys, Druids and Shaman can wield the sucker<br/>
too.  &gt;Yeah, a dragon drops it (Vox)  but its still BULL@!^& to me that<br/>
they would even do that after saying they &gt;want no one else to be able to res.<br/>
<br/>
You are making wild assumptions here.  I&#39;ve yet to own an item which could<br/>
be recharged (Observer Staff notwithstanding).  Even if the Staff in<br/>
question were rechargeable, I have no evidence to support that it&#39;s not,<br/>
I&#39;m sure the procedure would be a long and arduous one.  <br/>
<br/>
Now, let me get this straight, because this staff has the ability to cast<br/>
Ressurrection, you believe that clerics are useless and not needed anymore?<br/>
 I&#39;m sorry if you see our class as nothing more than mobile ressurrection<br/>
centers, but there are MANY things we do besides cast Ressurrection on<br/>
fallen comrades, and our non-ressurrection abilities will always be called<br/>
on in combat.<br/>
<br/>
I won&#39;t begrudge Verant a wondrous item, that was created with good<br/>
intentions.  If I do have one qualm it&#39;s that they didn&#39;t make this a<br/>
cleric only item, because if there is anything I agree with Bann on, it is<br/>
that ressurrections should only be allowed access to by Clerics.<br/>
