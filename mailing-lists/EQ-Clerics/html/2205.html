<b>Subject:</b> for perhaps a princess <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-985002183">Good advice, Sarah. I hadn&#39;t thought about that. But as soon as you<br/>
mentioned the fact that sitting out a fight can be uncomfortable for a<br/>
cleric, I realized that I felt exactly the same way when I was a cleric!<br/>
yeah, that makes a lot of sense. I&#39;ll have to remember to tell any<br/>
future clerics that I group with that their contribution is the most<br/>
important of all, even though it looks as though they&#39;re just sitting on<br/>
their butts. :)<br/>

I don&#39;t know about soloing clerics, exactly. But I do know that I<br/>
play AGAINST solo clerics (Ie the orcs, etc that one runs into in<br/>
Oasis. These are effectively solo critters) The NPCs, when soloing,<br/>
do a LOT of nuking. So I think maybe that is what the nukes are<br/>
for!<br/>
<br/>
But I do know about playing caster types that can&#39;t melee well (druid<br/>
and<br/>
enchanter)<br/>
It is not just frustrating to sit and med through a fight. It can also<br/>
get<br/>
to the point where you don&#39;t feel you are contributing to the group. It<br/>
might be useful to remind a cleric that feels they need to melee/nuke<br/>
every<br/>
fight they aren&#39;t directly healing that it is okay to sit out a fight,<br/>
med<br/>
ALL<br/>
the way through, and not fight at all. Even if they are not needed for<br/>
healing.<br/>
(We tend to pull blue meleers that my monk friend can handle all on her<br/>
own when I&#39;m low on mana. Then I can sit and med throughout. But it<br/>
still<br/>
feels a little odd. As if I&#39;m not doing my &quot;part&quot; -- It can be easy, at<br/>
level<br/>
18, to think I should still be meleeing. I haven&#39;t gotten to the part of<br/>
my life where I&#39;m not effective yet. (And indeed, my AC is about the<br/>
same as<br/>
the monk&#39;s.<br/>
But she clearly does much more damage than I)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, you might want to humor your insecure clerics and such. let them<br/>
know that<br/>
they are STILL contributing even if they don&#39;t do ANYTHING in a<br/>
particular<br/>
battle.<br/>
Or maybe even a series of battles (if you&#39;re fighting a lot of blues.<br/>
Then<br/>
this<br/>
could even be possible) The cleric is still buffing, and being there,<br/>
ready<br/>
to<br/>
heal, and cure poison/disease if you happen to get hit by one of those.<br/>
And...<br/>

&gt;Hmm well since you are using my post as a stepping ladder to your<br/>
&gt;rant...lemme just first clarify to you that I know what a cleric&#39;s main<br/>
&gt;function in the group is.  Trust me.  Everyone loves me as a cleric.  My<br/>
&gt;first char on this game is a ranger, and I got her up to lvl<br/>
&gt;40....so I know<br/>
&gt;what battles are like in tight situation.  I KNOW what it is like when a<br/>
&gt;cleric/healer does not heal...and one that runs around screaming and wont<br/>
&gt;stand still for u to taunt the mob off...or one that runs to zone<br/>
&gt;as soon as<br/>
&gt;he/she starts to get hit...or one who thinks that nuking is better then<br/>
&gt;healing.  I know these thing.  I am not one of those clerics.  The best way<br/>
&gt;to know how to play a cleric is to first play the opposite...a<br/>
&gt;tank that can<br/>
&gt;not heal or heal well...you would know what is expected in a cleric...or<br/>
&gt;what you think would make the best cleric.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As to my question about cleric soloing...it isnt because I think Im a<br/>
&gt;wizard.  Hell, I know I am not even close in nuking power compare to all<br/>
&gt;other nukers.  The reason why I asked was due to the fact that I just<br/>
&gt;changed server and I would like to restart a cleric character...but I want<br/>
&gt;to catch up to my friends.  It is as simple as that...just to let you know<br/>
&gt;that my post was not the best springboard that leads to yours.  Since I was<br/>
&gt;really referring to a &quot;solo&quot; situation and you are really talking about a<br/>
&gt;&quot;group&quot; situation.  I mean, who cares if the cleric nukes if he/she is<br/>
&gt;soloing?  No one is going to get hurt except for the cleric.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;All protestation aside.  I have group with other clerics before who do<br/>
&gt;exactly what you said you hate about them.  Yes, it is a low lvl<br/>
&gt;thing...and<br/>
&gt;I tend to tell them that they need to sit their butt down, med, and watch<br/>
&gt;the health bars, and for god sake dont let that health drops below<br/>
&gt;50%...esp<br/>
&gt;for casters.  So I think if you want to help the general well being of your<br/>
&gt;server...you should take the time and just tell these inexperience clerics<br/>
&gt;what their main duty is in the group...you never know, they might become<br/>
&gt;your regular cleric...and won&#39;t you rather have one who you know you can<br/>
&gt;trust?<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Hi all :)<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; I&#39;ve played clerics in the past, and when I was grouped, I knew my job,<br/>
&gt;&gt; and did it very well. I buffed the tanks before battle, watched their<br/>
&gt;&gt; health bars carefully during battle, and (at levels before 25) engaged<br/>
&gt;&gt; in a bit of melee if things were going well. No one had to ask me for a<br/>
&gt;&gt; heal. I mean, come on. When you go to the doctor, should it be necesary<br/>
&gt;&gt; for you to ask him to heal you? Hell, no. That&#39;s his job, for pete&#39;s<br/>
&gt;&gt; sake.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Anyway, I have recently been playing a barbarian warrior, because I knew<br/>
&gt;&gt; that I wanted to continue to melee, which would be a no-no for my cleric<br/>
&gt;&gt; at higher levels. Now, however, I&#39;m finding it very difficult to find<br/>
&gt;&gt; good clerics to group with. My warrior is level 19 now, and I can<br/>
&gt;&gt; honestly say that I&#39;ve yet to find a cleric who knows what the hell he&#39;s<br/>
&gt;&gt; supposed to do in a group. Is this just a problem with lower level<br/>
&gt;&gt; clerics? I certainly hope so, because if I EVER see a cleric not buffing<br/>
&gt;&gt; or healing in my groups at higher levels, I&#39;ll kick that person out of<br/>
&gt;&gt; my group faster than you can say &quot;Bob&#39;s your uncle!&quot; I won&#39;t even bother<br/>
&gt;&gt; to try explaining to them what they&#39;re supposed to do, because by that<br/>
&gt;&gt; time, they will have already perfected their bad habits. And I have made<br/>
&gt;&gt; it my solemn duty to NOT get myself or my group killed because of<br/>
&gt;&gt; someone else&#39;s arrogant stupidity/ignorance.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; That being said, I want to ask a question. Why are there (seemingly) so<br/>
&gt;&gt; many clerics out there who nuke? For pete&#39;s sake! There&#39;s a pefectly<br/>
&gt;&gt; good nuking class--wizard! Why didn&#39;t they choose that class?<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; I remember when I first got smite, I wanted to show everyone how<br/>
&gt;&gt; powerful I was. But I quickly got over it, because people much preferred<br/>
&gt;&gt; my healing and buffing capabilities over a smite or two during battle.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; It just irritates the hell out of me when I have to fight side by side<br/>
&gt;&gt; with a cleric who&#39;s at full health and who won&#39;t get beat on because he<br/>
&gt;&gt; can&#39;t melee worth a damn AND he won&#39;t heal me, even when I&#39;m down to my<br/>
&gt;&gt; last bubble of health. GRRR!<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Anyway, thanks for reading my--somewhat--rant on clerics. If you have<br/>
&gt;&gt; any advice for me to give these people, I&#39;d be happy to hear it. Any<br/>
&gt;&gt; time I&#39;ve tried to offer them advice, they&#39;ve either ignored me, or gave<br/>
&gt;&gt; me some lame reason why they do what they do. Sigh.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Maybe I should resurrect my clerics....<br/>

&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Just curious...any clerics here solo (or come close to it) to lvl 50?<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Is there a good website that tells you how to do the cleric armor quest?<br/>
&gt;&gt; Like the loc of the items.  On a scale of 1-10 (1 being easy and 10<br/>
&gt;&gt; being<br/>
&gt;&gt; hard.)  What do you rank the cleric quest to be?<br/>
