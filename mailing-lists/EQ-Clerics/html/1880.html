&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have often wondered if casting buffs on NPCs is<br/>
&gt; actually beneficial to them, but I have never taken<br/>
&gt; the time to experiment. It does seem to me that most<br/>
&gt; spells do not affect NPCs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I tried healing a guard that was fighting a dark elf<br/>
&gt; in freeport, and the guards life did not move. I tried<br/>
&gt; healing him like four times without any sucess. This<br/>
&gt; would also go along with my experience killing dark<br/>
&gt; elf guards. Seems for some reason, people take offense<br/>
&gt; to me killing their guards. :) The solution is that I<br/>
&gt; occasionally have a dragoon trained on me. Since I am<br/>
&gt; only level 20, it would be easier for a dark elf<br/>
&gt; cleric to just heal the corporal until I died.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The other side is I have heard of people casting see<br/>
&gt; invisible on NPC guards and having them attack invis<br/>
&gt; players. Also seems that other people have had success<br/>
&gt; healing NPCs as they are fighting kill stealers.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; so, the question I guess I have is what buff spells<br/>
&gt; work on NPCs and what spells do not?<br/>
