<div id="ygrps-yiv-392144479">i have a manastone and it works quite well...right click it, and you exchange<br/>
60hp for 30mana...sort of a bad ratio, but when you have an ac and hp buff on<br/>

&gt; Hey guys,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Does anybody have one of these Manastones? If so, exactly how do you use it?<br/>
&gt; Is there a strategy to it? If it converts HP to Mana, then how do you stay<br/>
&gt; alive with less HP available? I read about high level Druids and Shaman<br/>
&gt; using their &quot;regeneration&quot; line of spells to get HP back as they use it. Is<br/>
&gt; there a similar way to use it for us Clerics? Any tips would be appreciated.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>
