<div id="ygrps-yiv-1092510184">hiya walt and all i can tell you is i solo&#39;ed alot at that lvl, but this is <br/>
important, if you are the sole healer of the group, you must first know if <br/>
they want you in melee or healin capassity.  If you are the healer then you <br/>
have to tell yer party that the fighting and downtime go accourding to yer <br/>
manna, plain and simple!!  if they want you to heal then they have to wait <br/>
for yer manna to be at full unless its a lil thing that they can do without <br/>
you, in that case you med while they fight.  you will find that you are in <br/>
higher demand when you get to higher lvls.  just be patient and let them <br/>
know right from the start that you may not be the leader of the group but <br/>
the fighting does run on yer time, not theirs, as you are the one healing, <br/>
and if they want you to melee then they should not expect heals at critical <br/>
moments<br/>

&gt;I have been following this thread with considerable interest.  I am running<br/>
&gt;a high elf cleric on Erollisi Marr who is currently nine.  My problem is<br/>
&gt;that is hard to get into a group since a lot still want to solo at this age<br/>
&gt;level and the groups that do offer want to either go to Crushbone or like<br/>
&gt;today to the Chessboard.   When I have grouped I try to aid in melee and<br/>
&gt;still watch the health of the party members.  I do not use Furor at all in<br/>
&gt;combat saving my mana for healing and buffing only.  I have also had a <br/>
&gt;group<br/>
&gt;not give me a chance to med back to even 50% before starting to fight <br/>
&gt;again.<br/>
&gt;Another problem of course is that once I begin to heal the mob starts<br/>
&gt;beating on me and they cannot pull it off.  I try not to fight back when<br/>
&gt;this happens to give them a chance to get it off me though.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I did manage to purchase a couple of 2 wisdom rings today for a total of<br/>
&gt;2pp.  These are the first stat enhancing items I have gotten.  As usual I <br/>
&gt;am<br/>
&gt;almost completely broke now after buying my ninth level spells and the<br/>
&gt;rings.   I am still wearing a mixture of leather, PW and cloth armor and<br/>
&gt;using a cracked staff in combat.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am open to any and all suggestions that you elders my wish to impart upon<br/>
&gt;me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thank you,<br/>
&gt;Yilari<br/>
