<div id="ygrps-yiv-980354722">Sounds like fun.  Of course, nothing like that would ever happen on<br/>
Test, but it did sound like fun, nonetheless.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t know if I have just been lucky last week or so, or if they have<br/>
&gt;a new directive for GMs to do this, but I have participated in three<br/>
&gt;separate battles against NPCs controlled by GMs on two different<br/>
&gt;servers.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I LOVED it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The complete randomness that this brought to the zone was such a<br/>
&gt;welcome addition. One in particular was extremely well done. The GM<br/>
&gt;spawned a powerful giant rat in a newbie zone. The fun started once the<br/>
&gt;players realized what was going on. There were enough experienced<br/>
&gt;players starting new characters that a plan was formed rather quickly.<br/>
&gt;Several groups formed under these players and then a simulaneous attack<br/>
&gt;occured. It was a tremendous amount of fun for the &quot;new&quot; players as<br/>
&gt;well as the more experienced players. There weren&#39;t any characters<br/>
&gt;invloved that were higher then 8 I believe. The GM actually broadcast a<br/>
&gt;message congratulating all and naming several that went above and<br/>
&gt;beyond in their attempt to role play. He even rewarded me(level 5) with<br/>
&gt;a nice bracer for the way I circled the fight and healed key members of<br/>
&gt;the three groups. He said something like &quot;for showing others by example<br/>
&gt;what a cleric is supposed to be.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Now, the point of all that rambling was how much I think this adds to<br/>
&gt;the game.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1. You have an intelligent opponent without having to be PvP.<br/>
&gt;2. Tremendous opportunity for role-play.<br/>
&gt;3. Fun for game-knowledgable as well as newbies.<br/>
&gt;4. I would much rather obtain items in this way, then pitching a tent<br/>
&gt;in Najena for 17 hours straight.<br/>
&gt;5. No EXP is lost by a death from a NPC controlled by a GM.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I know this is not exactly cleric specific, but since the last episode<br/>
&gt;happened to a cleric and I like this list...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Any thoughts?<br/>
