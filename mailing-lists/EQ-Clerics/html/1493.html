<div id="ygrps-yiv-2075280642">Hey yea, that&#39;s a pretty neat trick, Verant.  I want one!  I would<br/>
like to see if anyone actually has one of these, and if so, could<br/>
a cleric actually use it?  Seems like a pretty decent weapon,<br/>
actually.  Boy, that would really throw people - Cleric walking around<br/>
with a sword.  That&#39;s usually what gives me away - the fact that I&#39;ve<br/>
got a hammer in my hand.  I had a Pal friend that had the same armor<br/>
as me, and aside from the weapon, we looked identical.<br/>
<br/>
How crazy.<br/>

&gt;On another Cleric list this URL was listed and if this is true then Verant<br/>
&gt;are idiots.<br/>

&gt;This weapon is for clerics and it&#39;s a slashing weapon.<br/>
