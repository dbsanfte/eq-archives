<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-802838185">As many of you know tonights event on the Rathe server was a joke.  Frame<br/>
rate was so bad I couldn&#39;t really move, decided to try to leave got blinded<br/>
and next thing I know I was killed.  Went looking for corpse got killed<br/>
again by new monsters they added to the zone.  Found corpse looted it and<br/>
with in 5 mins if that the server disconnected on me for like that 5th time<br/>
in 10 mins.  Was in chat room too hear someone say if you had anything on<br/>
your corpses it was all gone, heard like up too 100 ppl lost EVERYTHING but<br/>
not 100% sure on how many ppl it was.  Many were saying if they didn&#39;t get<br/>
things back they&#39;d never play EQ again.  Also was told if you got killed in<br/>
a GM event you&#39;d lose no exp but yet I did.  Tonight wasn&#39;t a good time for<br/>
Verant to mess up with Asheron&#39;s Call coming out on Tuesday.  I did hear in<br/>
the chat room before logging that GM&#39;s were replacing lost items but who<br/>
knows for sure about that.<br/>
