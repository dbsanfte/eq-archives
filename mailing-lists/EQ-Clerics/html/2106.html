<div id="ygrps-yiv-2077927619">I apologize for being off-topic here but this is a perfect example of the<br/>
sort of thing that should not be allowed on this list.   Someone asks a<br/>
question in a polite way and gets this kind of answer?   This is why there<br/>
are so many problems in EQ is because of immature people like this.<br/>

Come on over to our server if you would please.  Start in Kelethin and I<br/>
will aid you however I can with a few things to get you started.  I think I<br/>
have a spare cracked staff and maybe some cloth armor stashed away.<br/>

&gt; Stay the hell off Karana, our server&#39;s ready to crap out all the time<br/>
&gt; and needs to be replaced.  Goto one of the new servers if you are<br/>
&gt; starting over. Maybe it will be stable for a while.<br/>
