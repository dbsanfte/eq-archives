&gt; Just a quick query, is bronze worth auctioning, is there a demand for it,<br/>
&gt; and if so how much?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Help appreciated as always<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m on Erollisi Marr and recently have picked up loads of medium bronze<br/>
armour in Sol B.  Before that I had picked up loads of small bronze in<br/>
Unrest.  Anyway I&#39;ve been trying to sell this stuff off but not really<br/>
had much success..  It&#39;s possible that because I&#39;m from the UK and play<br/>
UK evenings I only have a smaller playerbase to sell to but by the end<br/>
of the evening the server is normally upto 1000-1300 players..  I&#39;ve<br/>
ended up giving the stuff away to low level DE clerics (I like to help<br/>
DE clerics since there are so few of us).<br/>
<br/>
Personally it&#39;s just not worth the time I need to spend trying to sell<br/>
the stuff.. perhaps if I collected enough and went to somewhere like<br/>
Qeynos/Qeynos Hills/West Karana, I might be able to sell a lot of the<br/>
medium bronze.. but again it&#39;s taking the time to do the trip..<br/>
