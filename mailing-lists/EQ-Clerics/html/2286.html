<div id="ygrps-yiv-120309689">I too started my cleric way back when twinking did not exist.  And I did<br/>
absolutely NO research into what stats were good for starting as a cleric.<br/>
<br/>
I think I was totally nekkid (lost my newbie armor when I lost my corpse -<br/>
hehehe) until about level 5 when I got some patchwork.  At about level 7 I<br/>
received a Runed Totem Staff from a necro friend that was about 5 levels<br/>
higher (and he was soooo OLD then!)  I was the envy of all the other newbie<br/>
DE clerics.<br/>
<br/>
I was still wearing patchwork into my late teens - at which time I was able<br/>
to acquire some ringmail and bronze.  By early 20&#39;s I was all Bronze armor<br/>
with +2 wis rings!<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t until about level 25 that I started to get some +wis increasing<br/>
decent items =)  Including an Observer Staff!!<br/>
<br/>
Sooo... the moral of this story is - It is NOT about what you wear, it&#39;s<br/>
about how well you play your class.  (well maybe a little bit about how you<br/>
look - the purple stuff sure is nice!) hehehe.<br/>
