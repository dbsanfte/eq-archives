<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1970848678">Others in this thread have offered good advice.<br/>
<br/>
I remember running around one day at level 6 or 7, knocking off orc pawns,<br/>
skellies and pixie tricksters near Felwithe, just for their weapons. No xp,<br/>
but at the end of the day I had about 4 plat.<br/>
<br/>
I second the idea of realizing that you are not going to be able to upgrade<br/>
your armor as soon as a warrior. I wore patchwork through level 10 or so,<br/>
when I began to replace it with ring. Not banded, too expensive. Ring is<br/>
lots cheaper, at least for a dwarf in Faydwer, because there&#39;s lots of it<br/>
coming out of Unrest, almost as high AC as banded. A little heavier, but I&#39;m<br/>
a dwarf with good strength. I got my first bronze at Level 15, when I<br/>
happened to be in a zone where a dark elf who was deleting her character was<br/>
having a fire sale of small bronze. My bronze breastplate was taken directly<br/>
from the smoking corpse of a dry bone skeleton in Unrest.<br/>
<br/>
Remember, you can always get cheaper armor if you go to the source. I picked<br/>
up Emperor Crush&#39;s dwarven ringmail tunic for 10 pp in Crushbone the other<br/>
day, from a wizard who wanted to get rid of it, and offered to sell me<br/>
another for the same price. Small bronze, which is found in Unrest, goes for<br/>
very low sums from players in Unrest (who want to unburden themselves<br/>
without having to to trek back to Butcherblock to sell or bank) and even in<br/>
Butcherblock from players who are leaving Unrest and going back to Antonica.<br/>
Would you believe 8 pp for small bronze pauldrons?<br/>
<br/>
When buying armor, buy smart. Wait for good prices.<br/>
<br/>
Like others, I killed bandits for the occasional bronze weapon, only these<br/>
were the bandits in Lesser Faydark. When I hit level 10, I started killing<br/>
minos, and mino axes, which I can always sell for 4 pp if I am patient, were<br/>
my main source of income from level 10 to level 14 or so, when I journeyed<br/>
to Antonica.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, you don&#39;t need to buy all those spells available at level 9, right<br/>
away. I would buy:<br/>
<br/>
    Summon Food (pays for itself in food costs)<br/>
    Center (Buffs R Us)<br/>
    Hammer of Wrath (a better weapon than you will be able to afford for a<br/>
while, probably, and it hits for magic to boot)<br/>
<br/>
    If you still have money:<br/>
    Root<br/>
    Endure fire (useful for fighting ebon drakes)<br/>
    Sense the dead (not expensive, and a mana-cheap way of keeping your Div<br/>
skill up for the occasional use of Invis to Undead)<br/>
    Endure poison<br/>
<br/>
    I agree with the other poster who said that Word of Pain is an<br/>
invitation to have all the mobs attack you at once. And it is expensive in<br/>
mana to boot.<br/>
<br/>
    And a question to everyone else: have you ever found much use in Soothe,<br/>
Fear, and Invigor? Soothe sounds great, but I just haven&#39;t gotten much use<br/>
out of it. Fear is the same way. The one time I tried it, the feared bandit<br/>
ran backwards two feet, then came right back and was in my face, with the<br/>
other bandit I was figting. I think I died that time. And has anyone found<br/>
much use for Invigor?<br/>
