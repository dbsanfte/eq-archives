<div id="ygrps-yiv-217160752">Babbin is in the 3rd floor.  If you go thru the door across from the secret door, go thru that room, you go over a pile of dirt in the doorway.  This leaves you in a room where if you looks left, there is a corner missing..  anyways, go thru the door to the left.  Inside that room, is a pillar fallen on its side.  Babbin spawns behind that fallen pillar, it is a 7 hour 5 minute spawn.  I killed about 12 placehgolders before he popped, but then he spawned twice in a row...go figure.<br/>

    Gloves:  Where in befallen does Babbinsbort spawn?  I know somewhere on the 3rd level... but i&#39;m really not very familiar with befallen... not nearly as familiar as I should be as a cleric =)</div>
