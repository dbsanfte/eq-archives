<div id="ygrps-yiv-594130849">I agree with what you are saying, but lag is a network issue. These<br/>
things don&#39;t clog a network.  You need a new video card if you are<br/>
having problems here.<br/>
<br/>
For us to have this discussion, we need to better define what &quot;lag&quot;<br/>
is.  And what it is, is network congestion, or slow-down.  The pre-<br/>
defined EQ world will not affect that.<br/>

&gt;this is where you are WRONG.  Lag in the game can be defined by 2<br/>
&gt;things.....both effecting your speed:  a)  data rate to you for varying<br/>
&gt;objects anf their placement (eg - corpses, monsters etc)<br/>
&gt;b)  Your system&#39;s speed and ability to deal with the &quot;pre-defined&quot; images<br/>
&gt;you have.  Example:  3dfx is fill limited to like 1833 textures (some ODD<br/>
&gt;number like that)  when more than that is there....your system goes NUTS<br/>
&gt;swapping in and out....  as it is....if more than 20 people and monsters <br/>
&gt;are<br/>
&gt;on your screen....fighting....casting spells etc...your system is gonna go<br/>
&gt;nuts trying to keep up.  and it does.  You get sometimes 1-2 fps (frames <br/>
&gt;per<br/>
&gt;second) which appears to be lag.<br/>

&gt;These things don&#39;t increase lag.  Think about it.  The game world is<br/>
&gt;completely pre-defined.  The server doesn&#39;t send you any information<br/>
&gt;about what the trees, buildings or scenery looks like.  All the<br/>
&gt;server sends is information about what the monsters are doing, what<br/>
&gt;the people are doing, any messages, and if there are any corpses or<br/>
&gt;equipment laying on the ground anywhere.  That is, things that are<br/>
&gt;not part of the static world.  You have a CD, that CD stores the<br/>
&gt;pre-defined world.<br/>
&gt;   I could see where corpses would increase lag because that<br/>
&gt;information would need to be sent to you.  A lot of people in a zone,<br/>
&gt;and a lot of monsters running aggro.  All these things would do it.<br/>
