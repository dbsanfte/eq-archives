&gt; weird, we also are hunting the EE&#39;s in the gorge(very boring , i might add)<br/>
&gt; and as far as i know it is possible to be charmed and cast but not by these<br/>
&gt; lil eyes?? we have been there for over 2 weeks now, have been charmed, and<br/>
&gt; have never casted while charmed, hmmm, and i am thinking ya did&#39;nt cancle<br/>
&gt; magic for the charm to stop, it was just short lived, evenerone says to sit<br/>
&gt; down when charmed, lol, i tried last nite--then i shouted-ummm its kinda<br/>
&gt; hard to sit down when yer courser won&#39;t work, when charmed everything<br/>
&gt; freezes up for me , except my typing--so i really don&#39;t know as my friend<br/>
&gt; said even the typing is not suposed to work.  oh well i wasn&#39;t much help but<br/>
&gt; i just wanted to say that<br/>

&gt; &gt;I have spent the last two days fighting evil eyes in<br/>
&gt; &gt;the gorge. However, there are still a couple things<br/>
&gt; &gt;that puzzle me. I was really hoping someone could<br/>
&gt; &gt;enlighten me. :)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;1) Charm, does cancel magic work on it or not? I have<br/>
&gt; &gt;tried casting several times with mied results.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Sometimes it seems to cancel it sometimes it does not.<br/>
&gt; &gt;All of my party members had only endure magic on, so<br/>
&gt; &gt;the second dispell should have theoretically worked,<br/>
&gt; &gt;but sometimes it did not. What gives?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;2) When charmed, I thought you could not use your<br/>
&gt; &gt;skills/spells. This seemed to be the case until late<br/>
&gt; &gt;last night when a 28th cater was charmed and then<br/>
&gt; &gt;proceeded to kill me in three casts. I also lost about<br/>
&gt; &gt;a half a bubble of exp from this PC death. I later<br/>
&gt; &gt;asked the caster and she said that she was killed me<br/>
&gt; &gt;by a spell that was memorized in the 6th slot, not the<br/>
&gt; &gt;8th slot like some peeple think. Her 8th slot was a<br/>
&gt; &gt;gate.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;So, what gives?? I think correct information would<br/>
&gt; &gt;come in handy in later levels.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Thanks!!!<br/>
