If it works your screen freezes you cannot see what you are doing, your<br/>
mouse pointer freezes too. The area on the screen you see with (depending on<br/>
your viewing mode) goes black. However you can still use hotkeys but it<br/>
takes a clear mind to stay still (so not to interrupt your spell) and cast<br/>
cancel magic (or cure blindness) especially if someone is pounding on you.<br/>
<br/>
I have only cast invulnerable once while being PK&#39;d and it did not stop them<br/>
Pk&#39;ing me. Never understood that. If someone has better exp in PvP, please<br/>
enlighten me.<br/>
<br/>
If he understands invulnerable. He will see his spell has no effect and just<br/>
med for the 15 secs while you are invul.<br/>
<br/>
Yes cancel magic can suck they way it works. Don&#39;t forget to buff against<br/>
poison as that is a big DOT for the Shaman.<br/>

&quot;Flash of light is an awesome little tool, if it works. Its<br/>
fast and uses little mana. He also has cure blindness and he would be<br/>
stupid<br/>
to not have it memorized. If he is a lower level it can last a<br/>
reasonable<br/>
time.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I was told by a friend who hunted in Runnyeye that Verant issued a patch<br/>
that caused your ENTIRE screen to go black when you get blinded. I will<br/>
have to try this on myself. Because if this is the case, then even<br/>
though the troll shaman has me targeted, he will be unable to use his<br/>
mouse to click his memorized spells. He WILL be able to cast spells IF<br/>
he has hotkeyed them AND remembers which keyboard number goes to which<br/>
spell....but I know for a fact that this shaman hasn&#39;t done that.<br/>
So......It looks like I&#39;m going to be a Flash of Light caster on Sunday<br/>
night at the PVP grounds in Neriak. Hmm....maybe I should first cast<br/>
Invulnerability on myself to get him to waste his mana, then blast him<br/>
with Flash of Light, and keep blasting him with it while I melee the<br/>
crap out of him.....means that I&#39;m going to have to memorize extinguish<br/>
fatigue as well, cause it&#39;s gonna take me FOREVER to melee him to death.<br/>
And I should probably memorize Cancel magic in case he decides to root<br/>
me....But someone said earlier that Cancel magic starts at the top of<br/>
the stack. Why? That&#39;s where all MY buffs are! If I remember correctly<br/>
(from Highpass and the gnoll shamans who cast root), I think Cancel<br/>
magic starts at the bottom of the stack. Otherwise, it would be a<br/>
worthless friggin spell, eh?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the suggestions so far...keep them coming...and let me know<br/>
what you think of the Flash of Light strategy :)<br/>
