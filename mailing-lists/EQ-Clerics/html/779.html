&lt;&lt; Thats fine but be warned you can get banned for it.  Just like you can get<br/>
 banned for cussing EVEN though there is a /filter command which turns off<br/>
 cusswords.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Disclaimer &gt; Mr. Daniels. This is _not_ directed personally to you or anyone <br/>
else in particular, just a rant in general.<br/>
<br/>
I couldn&#39;t give a RATS A$$ if they ban me or not.. as a matter of fact, it <br/>
probably would do me good to get back to real life and out of Norrath. But <br/>
the fact of the matter is this. Bannable or not, Kill Stealing and the jerks <br/>
that propagate the kill stealers are the problem. <br/>
<br/>
When I walk up to an area that has people already hunting, I ask if they <br/>
would mind if I joined the rotation. I expect the same courtesy of others. <br/>
Even if they dont ask, but leave me alone when I engage a foe, this is fine <br/>
and again I will reciprocate. (Kinda like a silent aggreement) But if someone <br/>
is BLATENTLY killstealing, I will ask them nicely to stop and again ask if <br/>
they would like to join my group or join the rotation. If they continue to <br/>
killsteal, my prostestations will increase in response. At a certain point in <br/>
time (where if in a PvP setting I would attack) I do..<br/>
<br/>
I will cast to interrupt<br/>
I will trade to interrupt<br/>
I will engage the MOB and then turn off auto -attack<br/>
I will petition<br/>
I will spam<br/>
I will shout<br/>
I will do ANYTHING and EVERYTHING in my power to make that GREEDY, <br/>
UNCOOPERATIVE, CRASS, RUDE JERK&#39;s life, as miserable as he&#39;s making mine and <br/>
others he bullies.<br/>
<br/>
Yes.. these people are either bullies, or the ones pushed around by bullies <br/>
or just plain spoiled brats who, their entire lives, got whatever they wanted <br/>
and never suffered the consequences of their actions.<br/>
<br/>
I will not walk away. I will not give in. I know others will say that * I * <br/>
am the one with the problem. Maybe so.. but if giving and asking for common <br/>
courtesy and recieving instead malicious killstealing and smug, &quot;you can&#39;t <br/>
touch me so live with it&quot; attitudes while simply tucking my tail and letting <br/>
the bully have his way is the right thing to do.. then I guess I&#39;ll be banned.<br/>
<br/>
I would rather be banned than be bullied by children and social miscreants. <br/>
I&#39;ll take my chances with the GM&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
Fight fire with fire.<br/>
