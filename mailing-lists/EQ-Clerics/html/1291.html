<b>Subject:</b> Hmm..trying to get back to cleric questions. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2134926847">I have a couple cleric related questions that I would appreciate some<br/>
input on.<br/>
<br/>
First off: I have completed the Testament of Vanear(spelling?) a bit<br/>
ago. My understanding a while back was that you could not equip it, but<br/>
that it was going to be fixed in a patch. I tried equiping it last<br/>
night and still no luck. Does anybody have any information on this? <br/>
<br/>
Second: I know that prices very greatly from server to server, but what<br/>
sort of price range am I looking at if I want to sell my shinig star of<br/>
light mace? around 20pp, around 100pp?? I really have no idea, and<br/>
since I am a broke cleric(is there another kind) I would like to get a<br/>
proper amount of money for it. <br/>
<br/>
Third: I am still confused by the flash of light spell. I never used it<br/>
much, but a friend of mine swears up and down by it. What exaclt are<br/>
the effects if you cast it on a mob? If they do not have you targeted,<br/>
will they now have you targeted even though they are blind? I was try<br/>
to think of a way to use it against casters specifically. <br/>
<br/>
All thoughts would be greatly appreciated. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
