<div id="ygrps-yiv-1126012213">That is my experience as well.  IF I am lucky, I can kill her and still be<br/>
at 1/2 mana (177 wis at level 32).  I have found that there really is only<br/>
two ways to kill her - 1&gt; clear out the 4 Priestesses that are beside her<br/>
and out front or, 2&gt; pull her to the zone.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Well, on the Karana server she was definitely green to me at<br/>
&gt; L30.  She also<br/>
&gt; &gt; went down with two Wraths.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; She is green to me at lvl 31 and I&#39;ve never managed to down her in less<br/>
&gt; than four wraths so I don&#39;t really believe that she goes down in two<br/>
&gt; wraths.. (and that is without her being healed since I cleared out all<br/>
&gt; the other kitty&#39;s that heal her).<br/>
