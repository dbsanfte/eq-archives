&gt; One wiz can do enough damage to a mob that the total gropu can not make<br/>
&gt; up for.   Your idea,  in theory makes sense, however, it  would not<br/>
&gt; correct the situation.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wrong, usually speaking a kill stealer has to stay within the levels he is<br/>
and the others who are hunting the same place. A 12th level Wiz may be able<br/>
to steal kill from a 15 level Magician  ALONE - BUT he cannot get off enough<br/>
spells to make up for a group total nor would he have the mana to do such a<br/>
thing blasting his high mana spells off.<br/>
<br/>
Our 4 person group on one round can do about 500 damage with spells not<br/>
counting pets and melee. No lone Wiz can compete with that unless he is<br/>
*very* high level above us and that is usually not the case.  Usually the<br/>
kill stealer wants to get off that one shot of a large damage spell  so they<br/>
get the kill but take no risk.  Usually at that point if everyone stops<br/>
attacking and backs away towards the KS - and then politely say how very<br/>
sorry you are, and here you can have it :)  makes them go away very soon :)</div>
