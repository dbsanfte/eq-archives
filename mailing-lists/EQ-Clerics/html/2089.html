<div id="ygrps-yiv-700570336">Wisdom is important.  I am also level 20.  Let&#39;s go through the<br/>
numbers.  I am a high elf and my base wisdom is 112.  I have the<br/>
following +wis items: testament of vanear, 2 +2 wis rings, lizardscale<br/>
mantle, and black iron medallion. for a total of +20 wisdom.  This<br/>
leaves me with 132 wisdom.  I&#39;m trying to find someone to make me two<br/>
+3 wisdom earrings, which will give me 138 wisdom.<br/>
At 112 wisdom, my mana is 487.  I think healing takes 70 mana so<br/>
that&#39;s 6 healing spells, with 50+ mana left over.<br/>
At 138 wisdom, my mana will be 592, which is 8 healing spells with 40+<br/>
mana left over.  So, it should be apparent that it makes a big<br/>
difference.<br/>
<br/>
  I am shooting for the &#39;pure caster&#39; cleric.  There seems to be two<br/>
different types of clerics.  (maybe 3), those that seem to really<br/>
want to play fighters (they usually play dwarven clerics), and those<br/>
that understand what a cleric is really for, and play the pure<br/>
caster cleric.  An optional third type is those that play pure caster<br/>
for the sake of trying to be a wizard and throwing around smite spells<br/>
all over the place.<br/>
  When it comes down to it, a fighter-cleric is just a waste, imho.<br/>
You can layer on all kinds of +str, +agi and +dex items, the best<br/>
armor you can find, and the best weapons, and you will never ever<br/>
come close to a fighter or paladin of your level.  A clerics combat<br/>
skills just don&#39;t compare to those of a fighter.  When I close in on<br/>
combat and try to hit with my screaming mace, I miss most of the time.<br/>
  I think the bottom line is, while you don&#39;t *have* to layer on +wis<br/>
items, I think you are truly ignoring what your class is all about.<br/>
The more mana you have, the more effective you become.  And the cleric<br/>
that can get out 2 more healing spells is a much more handy cleric to<br/>
have around.  None of this makes up for how well you play, of course,<br/>
but it certainly does help.<br/>
<br/>
As a side note, there are several +wis items that can be had by a 20th<br/>
level cleric.<br/>
Testament of Vanear +10 wisdom (Qeynos quest)<br/>
+2 wisdom rings (4 plat each from an enchanter)<br/>
+3 wisdom earrings (around 30 plat each from an enchanter)<br/>
black iron medallion +3 wisdom (found on goblin warlord in runnyeye)<br/>
lizardscale mantle +3 wisdom (cazic-thule) I bought mine.<br/>
prayer cloth of Tunare +3(crushbone) part of the screaming mace quest<br/>
labyrinth talisman +3 wisdom (found on Brahmm in beholder)<br/>
polished bone bracelets +3 wisdom (evil eyes in beholder)<br/>
<br/>
Things to shoot for in the mid-20s:<br/>
bloodstained tunic +4 wisdom (undead knight in unrest)<br/>
Paw of Opolla +9 wisdom (quest)<br/>
Savant&#39;s cap +3 wisdom (reclusive ghoul magi in unrest)<br/>
crown of leaves +5 wisdom (Narra Tanith, rare spawn in South Karana)<br/>
bloodstone eyepatch +3 wisdom (imp familiar in mistmoore)<br/>
mammoth hide cloak +4 wisdom (goblin alchemist in permafrost)<br/>
gatorscale leggings +4 wisdom (ancient croc in upper guk)<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps,<br/>

&gt;  The one recurring thing I see here, is wisdom is everything. Is this <br/>
&gt;true? From what I&#39;ve seen of higher levels, even having near double the <br/>
&gt;wisdom of others, you get like enough mana to cast half a greater heal or <br/>
&gt;whatever the non-full heal one is (I&#39;m only lvl 20). Seems strange that wis <br/>
&gt;is so important if this is the case.<br/>
