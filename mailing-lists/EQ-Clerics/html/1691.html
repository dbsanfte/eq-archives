<div id="ygrps-yiv-594897109">I&#39;ve had this for problem for a long, long time.<br/>
<br/>
My usual partner is also a ranger.  We&#39;ve traveled together since sometime<br/>
between L4-L6.  We would often fight stuff and he&#39;d get experience and I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t... even stuff that was blue to both of us.  We&#39;d also fight stuff<br/>
that was green to both of us, and he&#39;d get the experience.  He&#39;d also<br/>
generally get levels just a little ahead of me.  We were pretty much the<br/>
same level until recently.  I&#39;ve just come to accept this. =(<br/>
<br/>
He is a Half-Elf Ranger and I am a High Elf Cleric.  I guess I always just<br/>
blew it off to some race/class issues.  I assumed because he was a fighting<br/>
class, exp came easier (like in D&D).  Also, Half Elves didn&#39;t receive as<br/>
quite of a dramatic attribute adjustment.<br/>
<br/>
In the long run, it&#39;s not a major issue.  But I know how it can be a concern<br/>
a lower levels.<br/>

&gt; Sorry about the previous posting on the &quot;Paws of Opalla&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I, a level 14 Cleric, and I was grouped with a level 14 Ranger last night.<br/>
&gt; We were wondering around CB last night killing legionnaires. There were<br/>
&gt; several occasions when she got party experience and Idid n&#39;t. Can anyone<br/>
&gt; explain how this can happen when we are both the same level?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Regards<br/>
