<div id="ygrps-yiv-1750198559">Amen, Bro! I agree wholeheartedly! As Verant scrambles desparately to<br/>
make sure no one can &quot;cheat,&quot; (i.e. kiting, resurrect, pottery, box of<br/>
abu karr, killer necro pets, reduction in buff times and SOW times, life<br/>
taps getting resisted, etc. ad nauseum), they lose focus on the fact<br/>
that EQ is just a friggin game, and that no one really cares if druids<br/>
can kite, or that pottery can be a lucrative skill to learn for those<br/>
not willing to spend ungodly amounts of time and money on such noble<br/>
pursuits like smithing. These phenomena are merely the natural<br/>
progression of a game that is maturing and becoming more than its<br/>
creators could envision. And what&#39;s wrong with that? Verant should take<br/>
a chill pill and quit worrying about whether one or more classes or a<br/>
stupid item are too powerful. GIVE IT A REST, VERANT!<br/>
<br/>
Every nerf patch that comes along makes me shake my head and sigh with<br/>
pent up frustration. Just thinking about some of the most recent SNAFUs<br/>
makes me so mad at how stupid Verant is that I can&#39;t even write any more<br/>
about it. But then I think, Hey, it&#39;s a game. And then I calm down and<br/>
wonder how I could have spent the last 5 months of my life caring so<br/>
much about a game whose goal seems to be to get every player to be in<br/>
the unenviable position of having to camp spawn spots or get the hell<br/>
out and go on with his/her life.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for a great 5 months, Verant. Get a life and let the players play<br/>
the damn game.<br/>
<br/>

You know, just an aside, and not related to clerics in any way, but<br/>
I&#39;ve been a D&D dungeon master for about 10 years, and if I gave a<br/>
bag of holding (similar to a box of abu&#39;kar) in January and then<br/>
around March if I told him, &quot;Oh, I made a mistake on that.  Instead of<br/>
weighing nothing, it nows weighs half of what is inside.&quot; you can bet<br/>
that that player would be pretty pissed. It&#39;s no different here.  It<br/>
only shows lack of organization on Verant&#39;s part and poor testing.<br/>
EQ is a great game, but I&#39;ve never seen a company that is just so bad<br/>
at &quot;getting it&quot;.  Verant just doesn&#39;t &quot;get it&quot;.  They need to focus<br/>
their effort on making new quests and stop screwing with what they<br/>
already have.  The more they change things, the more bugs they are<br/>
going to introduce.  Take the testament of venear for example.  It has<br/>
apparently been changed to be equipable, but the quest appears to be<br/>
broke now.  Slick trick.<br/>
  Stabilize the damn game, and then add stuff to it.  So what if that<br/>
Druid spell was &quot;typo&#39;d&quot; at 39 instead of 49.  Big damn deal.  Just<br/>
leave it alone.  No one cares about their typos.  It&#39;s friggin game<br/>
for christ&#39;s sake.  It&#39;s not like we&#39;re dealing with health care<br/>
reform here.<br/>
