&gt;I suggest we do this on every server.Why not? We need all the servers to<br/>
&gt;get together on this one! Same spot on all servers. The more servers we<br/>
&gt;do this on the more verant should take notice! Come on guys, I may not<br/>
&gt;be a web master but lets all make a diffrence instead of those of you on<br/>
&gt;the Fennin Ro server.Hope to see E&#39;ci players there. Remember December<br/>
&gt;3, 1999 6 PM PST (9 PM EST) on all servers in west Freeport.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I am proud to announce that the Cleric Sit-In will take place on<br/>
&gt; &gt; December 3, 1999 at 6PM PST (9PM EST) on Fennin Ro in the city of<br/>
&gt; &gt; Freeport. Our purpose is to show Verant that a great number of Clerics<br/>
&gt; &gt; and their friends are dissatisfied with the current state of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Cleric-only armor quests that were meant to replace Rubicite. The<br/>
&gt; &gt; Cleric-only armor presently has two flaws that we would like to see<br/>
&gt; &gt; corrected. One, the quests themselves take a ridiculously long amount<br/>
&gt; &gt; of time to complete (days or weeks for just one piece), and two, the<br/>
&gt; &gt; armor class (AC) of the Cleric-only armor is not on par with classes<br/>
&gt; &gt; of its type (The new Cleric-only armor∩┐╜s AC is actually *lower* than<br/>
&gt; &gt; the original Rubicite). To receive more information about these<br/>
&gt; &gt; concerns and to find out how you can show your support, please visit<br/>

&gt; &gt; already plan on participating in this event please check the<br/>
&gt; &gt; information page, as several updates have been made. I look forward to<br/>
&gt; &gt; seeing everyone there, and in all hopes we can get Verant to listen to<br/>
&gt; &gt; our suggestions. Thank you all for your support.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
