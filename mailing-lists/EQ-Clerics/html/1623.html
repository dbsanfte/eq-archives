<b>Subject:</b> Hi Mik! Some Befallen shudders <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-972636120">Heh, I&#39;m speaking only from personal experience, Mik. ;) For me and my<br/>
friends (about 12 of us in all), Befallen has always been and always<br/>
will be a nightmare of epic proportions. I must say, though, that we<br/>
never had experienced pullers in our groups. We were more of an outside<br/>
kind of clan, sticking mostly to Oasis, North Ro, South Karana, Lake<br/>
Rathe, etc. For us, it wasn&#39;t the trains that were so terrible but,<br/>
rather, the spawn rate on the 2nd and 3rd levels. We couldn&#39;t kill them<br/>
fast enough :) And our necros&#39; pets never worked very well down there<br/>
(or in any dungeon, for that matter).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we&#39;re all playing different characters now, and we all agree<br/>
that if any one of us says &quot;Hey, let&#39;s go check out Befallen,&quot; the rest<br/>
of us will disown him/her on the spot. :)<br/>

Hey Saidinn, never apologize for having a different opinion, hon, that&#39;s<br/>
what this list is all about.  And my ego isn&#39;t that large that I take<br/>
personal offense just cause someone DOES have a different opinion.<br/>
<br/>
Now, concerning Befallen.  I wasn&#39;t kidding.  But then again, perhaps<br/>
it&#39;s<br/>
changed since my days long ago.  When I was in P4, at level 9, when we<br/>
got<br/>
our first undead spells, myself and 5 others (including another level 9<br/>
cleric) went to Befallen.  We stayed on the FIRST floor, of course, and<br/>
killed the skels and the rats.  We also killed Lrodd, who gave us GREAT<br/>
exp<br/>
back then.  I never went anywhere my entire P4 beta days after level 9<br/>
except Befallen, and we levelled like crazy.  We moved downstairs around<br/>
level 12 or so, if I recall correctly.  But then again, this was beta.<br/>
So<br/>
much has changed even in live since it began.<br/>
<br/>
In live, we went to Befallen about mid-teens I think, and did well on<br/>
the<br/>
second floor down.  The problem was there were a LOT of trains.  From<br/>
the<br/>
best of my recollection, we left Befallen for Oasis because of the gosh<br/>
awful trains.  We also went to Permafrost and hunted right there in the<br/>
zone<br/>
corridor, pulling from upstairs by the firepit in the room on your<br/>
right.<br/>
We graduated from Perma in the Flag Room at about level 20, to my<br/>
recollection.  Back then, our group was like the ONLY ones in all of<br/>
Perma<br/>
on most nites.  Occassionally another group would come in and go camp in<br/>
the<br/>
Flag Room, but inevitably they&#39;d wind up training down on us.<br/>
<br/>
Again, we actually did do Befallen at level 9 and did fine, but that was<br/>
an<br/>
awfully long time ago and perhaps a lot has changed.  I will defer to<br/>
those<br/>
of you who have had recent experience in Befallen, and I&#39;m sure know it<br/>
much<br/>
better than I now.<br/>
<br/>
Mik</div>
