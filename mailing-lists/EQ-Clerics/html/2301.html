<div id="ygrps-yiv-1507146147">&lt;SNIP&gt;&gt;&lt;I heard a rumor, that they no longer dropped these however...<br/>
I hope that&#39;s not true because I really want one and they morning stars are<br/>
no-drop<br/>
items... so if they no longer are being dropped in Kithicore i can never get<br/>
one =(&gt;<br/>
<br/>
O I can answer this one for you, Eachann.  The following is a snip from the<br/>
ranger list.  I got an answer from that list as well, and this is what they<br/>
have to say about it =/<br/>
<br/>
&lt;SNIP&gt;&lt;&lt;During the actual dark elf invasion, Enchanted weapons were dropped,<br/>
as<br/>
well as a few really nice artifacts.  Then, after Innorukk cast the<br/>
zonewide spell of instant death, the first wave of undead spawned and<br/>
killed those who were returning to their corpses.  For the first 2 real<br/>
life days, these undead dropped Tainted weapons.  The tainted were just<br/>
as good as teh Enchanted in most cases except they were no drop and had<br/>
-5 sv disease.  Then the GMs announced that the undead would not spawn<br/>
in kithicor, at least for a while.  This was probably due to the fact<br/>
that the weapons were way too nice.  After another couple days the<br/>
undead came back but only dropped Ruined weapons, and much more rarely.<br/>
The Ruined weapons have the same stat bonuses but much worse attack and<br/>
delays.  Im not sure if the undead have been changed again tho, as i<br/>
havent hunted there for a while.<br/>
