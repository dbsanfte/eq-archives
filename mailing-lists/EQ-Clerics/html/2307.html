<div id="ygrps-yiv-37261038">Jojo isn&#39;t that high of a monster, I remember running into him many of times<br/>
when I played a Troll Shaman.  I was told by many he was maybe Lvl 10-15 but<br/>
it&#39;s been a long time since then and I&#39;m not 100% sure of his lvl but it<br/>
didn&#39;t seem to high.  Never killed him (yet) but he is on my hit list.<br/>

&gt; actually, i have seen him killed, and was given the pelt from him....it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; lore....the name&#39;s &lt;i think&gt; a large kobold pelt or something like<br/>
&gt; that...he&#39;s not hard to kill, just has alot of hp.....my druid was i think<br/>
&gt; 32 or around there, and took him down with a few combusts<br/>

&gt; &gt; Someone asked to keep the posts coming, so here goes.  :)  slow day at<br/>
&gt; &gt; work for me, too.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; There are a couple of quests that have always intrigued me that appear<br/>
&gt; &gt; to be broken.  One is the Jojongua pelt quest in Felwithe.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Technically, I guess, this is a Paladin quest, but the Paladin that<br/>
&gt; &gt; initiates it, asks if you will help the &quot;clerics of tunare&quot; so it<br/>
&gt; &gt; kind of overlaps.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;From what I have heard, Jojongua, the named Kobold in Innothule Swamp,<br/>
&gt; &gt; is a rare spawn, and those that have killed him, have never ever<br/>
&gt; &gt; looted a pelt off his cold, dead body.  Also from what I have heard,<br/>
&gt; &gt; the corpse remains, even though there is no loot, and doesn&#39;t go away<br/>
&gt; &gt; after looting.  Anyone have any information on this quest?<br/>
