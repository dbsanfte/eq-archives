<div id="ygrps-yiv-1512308029">There&#39;s your problem, you should have downloaded the small 28 meg upgrade.<br/>
:-)<br/>
I blamed my SBLive drivers for performance problems for the longest time...<br/>
but in the end they weren&#39;t the cause. A bit surprising since I had some<br/>
flaky dev drivers for the longest time last year.<br/>
<br/>
But YMMV. There are a lot of extra bits to the SBLive package, that&#39;s for<br/>
sure.<br/>
<br/>
One sound side effect I have is that I don&#39;t seem to be able to go all the<br/>
way to the end on the sound detail slider - I can&#39;t get the 3D sounds and<br/>
all that. Anyone else had this?<br/>
