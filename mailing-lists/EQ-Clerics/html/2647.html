&gt;Well, I had fun getting this awesome weapon over the holidays. If you would<br/>
&gt;like to know all the details, read on. Warning: it&#39;s kinda long...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;This is a hidden quest given by Gavel in the Temple of Solusek Ro. If you<br/>
&gt;hail him and say &quot;What of Sacrament&quot;, he says that the Ingot and Icon are<br/>
&gt;merely legend! He also says that if you could bring him both Ingot, Icon <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;2 magnetized platinum bars, that he could forge something very special:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ingot of the Sacrament:<br/>
&gt;Go to the Rathe Mountains and find the Undead Ruins. To get there, as you<br/>
&gt;zone in from the Feerrott, take a left at the first 4-way intersection you<br/>
&gt;come to. Keep the mountain wall on your left and you will eventually come<br/>
&gt;upon a gold tower with undead, this is NOT the spawn. Keep going until you<br/>
&gt;see what looks like a druid teleport spot (ruins) with undead; this is it.<br/>
&gt;Here spawn the giant undead skeletons. You are looking for the rare spawn<br/>
&gt;that looks like a giant dread bone skel (dark brownish-red in color). He is<br/>
&gt;a low 30th lvl mob and will be quite tough to solo. I, a 34th Cleric, and a<br/>
&gt;27th Rogue took him easily. We even had another normal giant skel wacking <br/>
&gt;on<br/>
&gt;us, so a group of 3 or so at 30 should do. Also, these guys drop &quot;A <br/>
&gt;skeletal<br/>
&gt;finger&quot;, which is a Necro quest for Shadowbound armor. You could use this <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;attract the company of a necromancer to aid you in destroying the spawn.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Icon of the Sacrament:<br/>
&gt;To get the Icon you must travel to Mistmoore. At the back of the Graveyard<br/>
&gt;there is a secret wall (back left, facing the graveyard). Pass through and<br/>
&gt;you will be in a small, square room. There is yet another secret wall<br/>
&gt;immediately to your right as you enter. Go through and you will find<br/>
&gt;yourself in a room with 4 doors. The only door that can be opened is the <br/>
&gt;one<br/>
&gt;you are facing as you enter. But be warned, opening the door causes the<br/>
&gt;other 3 to open. And unless there is a party camping there, there will be a<br/>
&gt;nasty creature behind each. There is only 1 wall with 2 doors. The Icon is<br/>
&gt;behind the left door of this wall. It is lying on the ground and looks like<br/>
&gt;a voodoo doll. Also, this is a 6-hour spawn. I like to call this one my<br/>
&gt;&quot;12pp solution&quot;. Why? Because that&#39;s how much a potion of invisibility <br/>
&gt;costs<br/>
&gt;=) I traveled to Mistmoore and asked if there was a party in the graveyard,<br/>
&gt;and there was. I asked if they had been killing the things in the secret<br/>
&gt;room, they had been. I asked if they had picked up the doll behind the door<br/>
&gt;and they told me they had done so about 2 hours before. So....I just logged<br/>
&gt;and came back 4 hours later, which happened to be around 6:00AM. This <br/>
&gt;worked<br/>
&gt;out great because nobody was in-zone at that time. Drank my invisibility<br/>
&gt;potion, strolled in, opened the door, picked it up and got the heck out.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Magnetized Platinum Bars:<br/>
&gt;Purchase 2 regular Platinum Bars from a Jewelry shop or from an Enchanter<br/>
&gt;(hint: create an Enchanter and dump all points into CHA and check the<br/>
&gt;prices). Take these to Ostorm in the Temple of Solusek Ro (he will be<br/>
&gt;upstairs through several doors on the right side of the Temple). Give <br/>
&gt;Ostorm<br/>
&gt;1 bar at a time and he will return it to your inventory as a Magnetized<br/>
&gt;Platinum Bar.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Give Gavel the Ingot, Icon and both Magnetized bars (I separated the bars)<br/>
&gt;and he will give you your reward:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Caduceus of the Sacrament<br/>
&gt;Magic Lore No Drop<br/>
&gt;Weight: 8.0<br/>
&gt;Type: 1HB Dmg: 12 Del: 32<br/>
&gt;Cleric only<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I constantly hit for 28&#39;s with this thing (89 STR). When I cast Frenzied<br/>
&gt;Strength and Yaulp II, I get some in the low 30&#39;s. Truly awesome weapon <br/>
&gt;that<br/>
&gt;is relatively easy to get.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Good Luck!<br/>
