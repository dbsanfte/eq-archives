&gt;     No immature is when you give a player all your buffs just becuase they<br/>
&gt;wanted to RP and didn&#39;t want your help and yes it does ruin the Rping<br/>
&gt;enviroment. And we are not going ot turn this into some kind of  blown out<br/>
&gt;argument just becuase you think that my life is this game.<br/>

guidance seldom ask or want it :)<br/>
