<div id="ygrps-yiv-739062027">I guess the one thing I&#39;d think about here is not the looks but good <br/>
vs evil. I just restarted my DE cleric - and I personally think they <br/>
look good in anything but brass &lt;shudder&gt;. DE&#39;s are limited in the <br/>
areas that they can go though (or so it seems to me). Seems like the <br/>
vast majority of areas I&#39;m KOS. I have to be invised by friends to <br/>
travel the majority of the realms. When you first create the char you <br/>
are warned that it&#39;s a high difficultly combination. If you want to <br/>
travel freely you spend a lot of time killing things to raise your <br/>
faction. I sometimes wish I could move about as freely as a goodie - <br/>
but oh well - I love my DE.<br/>

&gt;Hello,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This might be a silly plead for advice but here it is...I am restarting my<br/>
&gt;cleric on a new server.  My old cleric is a high elf female.  I am torn<br/>
&gt;between restarting as a dark elf or stick with the high elf.  Which in<br/>
&gt;y&#39;all&#39;s opinion...looks better?  I have never seen a dark elf in the purple<br/>
&gt;armor...do they look silly?  Does the purple make em look like a blueberry<br/>
&gt;and grape mix?  I have never seen a dark elf in the yellow quest armor as<br/>
&gt;well.  I do like the way the dark elf females look but given the color<br/>
&gt;scheme I might not be able to live with myself if the color is too much of<br/>
&gt;an offense to my fashion sense =).  The only thing I do not like about the<br/>
&gt;high elf females is the face...they look too haughty. Although I have to<br/>
&gt;admit that plate armor looks really good on the females.  However, another<br/>
&gt;reluctance is the fact that there just seems to be more high elves cleric<br/>
&gt;then dark elves...yeah I know the stat is better...but I want to look my<br/>
&gt;best as well and be unique ;)  Anyway advise is appreciated...thanks.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;These are female characters I am talking about.<br/>
