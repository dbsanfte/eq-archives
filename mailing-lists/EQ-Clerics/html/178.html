&gt; You&#39;ve obviously never dealt with hags or just didn&#39;t think before you<br/>
&gt; spoke.  Hags *spells* are the thing that will kill you.  Seeing as they<br/>
&gt; stop to cast on you very frequently during chase you can put enough<br/>
&gt; distance between you and them while divine is on before you get to the<br/>
&gt; zone.  So by the time ya make it to the zone they are out of range for<br/>
&gt; spells and divine has saved you again.  All you need is about 10 secs to<br/>
&gt; make it away from a hag.  They will just stand there are try to cast on<br/>
&gt; you.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>True, I haven&#39;t fought hags before.  If spells are what they use to kill you<br/>
though, then unless they are stun type spells, they wont interrupt your<br/>
casting, and gate will work fine to get you out of there.  At least this has<br/>
worked for me when I have been on the receiving end of most spells from<br/>
wizard, necro and shaman type casters. Except for the damage + stun spells<br/>
of druids and enchanters, casting continues.  I suppose charm type spells<br/>
would also be a problem. Do they use these?</div>
