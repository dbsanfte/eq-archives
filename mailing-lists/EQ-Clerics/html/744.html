<div id="ygrps-yiv-1238691407"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; From: &quot;Curtis Bennett&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:die_kluge@...">die_kluge@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt; Talking about days played, this reminds me of the discussion we had<br/>
&gt; on here a while back about twinking a character to level 20.  Someone<br/>
&gt; mentioned that it could be done in 10 game days.  Others believed<br/>
&gt; that that would be nearly impossible.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Hmmh well, I am a powergamer (I like it to optimize things to their full<br/>
extent). I have a character on a mud with which I made top player in 1week<br/>
1day, while the others below me were over 3weeks of age. Mind you,<br/>
most players in that mud were powerplayers, it was no chat/roleplay<br/>
mud. After initial adjustation to the graphical setting, navigating,<br/>
general usage of everything etc., one 14th char on Erollisi Marr<br/>
(under 5days), general fooling around with a few classes that<br/>
sounded interesting I finally started on the fresh Quellious with my main<br/>
char of now. At the moment, I am 22nd level with under 5days<br/>
of age. And this also includes probably at least closer to day of<br/>
exploring and general fooling around with new places. Also,<br/>
I am quite sure I could shave quite a bit of time from the progress<br/>
if I started again. Exp gathered in groups instead of soloing<br/>
is probably under 10%. And no twinking (how could I? =)),<br/>
no guild help (haven&#39;t got any) and solo most of the time.<br/>
Been to Cazic, Unrest, Perma, visited Mistmoore, CBone<br/>
BBurrow. Been in all 3 continents, but mostly on Antonica.<br/>
I just hate Faydwer =) And class was bard, not necro or<br/>
magician or druid, the so-called powergamer classes.<br/>
Haven&#39;t tried any of those btw, so don&#39;t know for sure if I<br/>
could optimize them to go any faster. I seriously doubt<br/>
that any class can level 14-20 faster than a bard though.<br/>
<br/>
  After the rambling if you are still reading, I can just say that<br/>
if you are _twinking_ a character, I would guess the time it<br/>
takes to go to 20th level is (take calculator) ... I would<br/>
guestimate under 2days of played time. Calculating in also<br/>
guild help power-leveling. Probably closer to 1d than 2d.<br/>
Don&#39;t like the figures, blame someone else than me =)<br/>
And if some guild has actually powerleveled a guy to 20th<br/>
and resulted with longer time than 2days, that guild needs<br/>
someone able to powerplay ;)<br/>
