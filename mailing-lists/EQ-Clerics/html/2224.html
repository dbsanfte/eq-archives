<b>Subject:</b> RE: Why do so many clerics think they&#39;re wizards? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-651181294">I am newly level 20 and I do melee at some times. I would never put my group <br/>
in perill though. the reason I do it is not to do damage but rather to keep <br/>
my defense and dodge skills up. It will really come in handy at hight levels <br/>
when I do a huge heal and they come after me. I just ask my party members to <br/>
let it beat on me for a while, then I back off and let them do their work.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;Nope it isnt just you....  I think most clerics from 20 below have some <br/>
&gt;kind<br/>
&gt;of feeling that we can melee with the rest.  I knew I had that feeling till<br/>
&gt;I was level 24 and finally realized that my melee just blows compared to <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;rest.  Give it some time.  The more experienced clerics about 20+ will heal<br/>
&gt;and buff instead of melee.  Its just a phase I wouldnt worry about it to<br/>
&gt;much.<br/>
