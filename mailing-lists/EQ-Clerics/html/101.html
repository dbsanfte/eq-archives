<div id="ygrps-yiv-1302120587">I recently saw a Erudite Paladin in Befallen, I was completely<br/>
impressed, the character looked amazing all decked out in banded.. I was<br/>
so impressed, I have decided to start my cleric as a Erudite.. <br/>
<br/>
Anyone play a erudite cleric, I cant remember ever seeing one....<br/>
<br/>
If someone is playing this race/class, Please give me some pointers on<br/>
it... I would love to hear some pros/cons..<br/>
<br/>
Thanks tons!</div>
