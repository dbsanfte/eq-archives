<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1459606502">I can confirm that my lvl 39 res does the same thing as well as the lvl 49<br/>
res, all have the same ill effects.<br/>
<br/>
I am on Fennin Ro where they have killed Nagafen now at least twice, i have<br/>
not participated but been in the zone and this change to the line of res<br/>
spells completely blows their tactics out of the water.  Basically what they<br/>
do is, there are certain number of tanks, tank dies cleric res&#39;s them they<br/>
continue tanking, especially when on of the tanks is a lvl 50 monk.  Looks<br/>
like they will have to change their tactics a bit now.<br/>
