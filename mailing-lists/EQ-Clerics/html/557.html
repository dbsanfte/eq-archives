<div id="ygrps-yiv-42910379">On EQVault they had the new Producers Letter which Brad stated in about a<br/>
month we&#39;ll have a new zone free to d/l and another one  a month or two<br/>
after that.  I think he said theres 3 new zones getting ready to be put up.<br/>
They don&#39;t know if they want it to where you HAVE to get the new zones or a<br/>
only if you want them type of deal.  You can bet I&#39;ll get them.<br/>
