<div id="ygrps-yiv-1002868719">In Dagnor&#39;s Cauldron.<br/>
Dagnor&#39;s Cauldron is off Butcherblock.<br/>
<br/>
In Butcherblock, at the crossroads, go south.  You will eventually get<br/>
to a zone.  This is Dagnor&#39;s cauldron.  The zone is basically only a<br/>
place where people go through to get to Unrest.  There are some fairly<br/>
tough critters here for a 13th level, so be careful.  Go through the<br/>
long hallway and go to the water&#39;s edge, and go right.  If you stay<br/>
near the water, you&#39;re fairly safe.  Go until you get to around loc<br/>
-1600 (or maybe positive 1600), and something..  At night, it&#39;s easier<br/>
to see, since the entrance is lit up.  There is a cave in the wall.<br/>
Go back up on top of the cliff, and you&#39;ll see it- a big square hole<br/>
in the wall.  You could go there at 13th, and fight the death beetles<br/>
that tend to swarm over everything.  Probably would be good xp for<br/>
you, actually.  Just stay out of the house.  First floor is blue and<br/>
green to me at 20, and it only gets tougher from there.<br/>
