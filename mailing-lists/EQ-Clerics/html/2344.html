<div id="ygrps-yiv-2051543078">I guess I am just a lousy RP&#39;er but I have been doing a lot of hunting in WC<br/>
and N. Ro and have had DE&#39;s in my party and we have treated each other as<br/>
equals.   I also had a Troll stop and bind the wounds on my monk once.  I<br/>
guess it is really all in the way you treat this game.  I know that I play<br/>
my paladin a lot different than I do my cleric and ranger.  My paladin has<br/>
left groups when a necro or SK joined.   Kinda snobbish if you ask me but<br/>
that is the way this paladin is.<br/>
<br/>
Each member of the party needs to do what they can do best to ensure the<br/>
survival and growth of all.  Tanks should fight, nukers should nuke and<br/>
clerics can fight and heal when needed.  I know that I save my mana for a<br/>
few buffs but mostly for healing.  It really is nice to get in a group that<br/>
understands that our need to med to regain our mana.  I just love to have a<br/>
bard in the party to aid in the healing process also.  If a tank is hurt bad<br/>
I can get them back to 90% and med back up and let the bard&#39;s song do the<br/>
rest.<br/>
<br/>
At 12 I am just now starting to see people begin to work together more as a<br/>
team and not as a bunch of individuals.  If someone does something that<br/>
hurts the team then they are told very politely what they did wrong and how<br/>
to avoid that in the future.  Then of course I am seeing a lot more of what<br/>
I consider kill stealing also now.<br/>
<br/>
I really got ticked off today.   I was on the flats in N. Ro soloing and was<br/>
jumped by a madman.   It was a very close fight but he killed me and I had<br/>
him down to about a half bubble.   What frosted me though was that another<br/>
character just stood there and watched even though I asked a couple of times<br/>
for help.   When I went down unconcious he started to attack to get the easy<br/>
experience.    To me this is the worst kind of behavior possible but I guess<br/>
I will have to learn to live with it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again all for all your help and advice,<br/>

&gt; As a lvl 35 DE cleric on Erollisi Marr I don&#39;t agree.. we heal the<br/>
&gt; warriors of Innoruuk so they may harm our enemies... it&#39;s a basic cleric<br/>
&gt; principle.. heal the tanks because they can do more damage than we can..<br/>
&gt; even &#39;good race&#39; clerics know that.. (well those not trying to be a<br/>
&gt; wizard do).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; All races need their medics and we are our races healers.. we promote<br/>
&gt; pain through extending the life of those more suited to causing pain..<br/>
&gt; our heals cause our enemies to hate us.. kinda apt really..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Dark Elf Clerics do make sense.. you just have to look at it the right<br/>
&gt; way..  Anyway we rock and look far better than any poncy good race<br/>
&gt; cleric..<br/>

&gt; &gt; Heh... well, I&#39;m on Erollisi Marr, but I&#39;m one of<br/>
&gt; &gt; those bad DE cleric types... won&#39;t be too helpful to<br/>
&gt; &gt; ya, I&#39;m afraid :P<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Are there any other DE clerics out there who are<br/>
&gt; &gt; struggling a little with the duplicity of our natures?<br/>
&gt; &gt;  Evil, yet healing?  Yeah, I know, I could take the<br/>
&gt; &gt; notion that evil people are good to other evil people,<br/>
&gt; &gt; but that seems almost like a cop out...<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I agree with this for sure.  Is there anyone on<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Erollisi Marr?<br/>
