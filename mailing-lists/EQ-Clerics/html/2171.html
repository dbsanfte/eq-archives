<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-128764521"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt;Well I am level<br/>
&gt; 25 and just<br/>
&gt; &gt;wondering where can I hunt?  The best places that a cleric will feel<br/>
&gt; &gt;welcomed,  and if you say unrest no way!!!!  Thanks guys :)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, this might be a crowded area, but I always make good exp with the<br/>
birds in SK.  By 25 I can also solo the undead embalmer etc in Lake<br/>
Rathe...I would try to lull (or is it calm now) them first though.<br/>
<br/>
The knight room in RE is also doable with 3 or more ppl at this lvl. (Tip:<br/>
always jump into the water if the situation gets out of hand)<br/>
<br/>
Drez, the ogre capn, bonecracker in Najena are all good too with a full<br/>
party around this lvl.<br/>
<br/>
Permafrost is nice too but that place can train easily if you are not<br/>
careful.  Try camping the preacher room at this lvl.  You would still get<br/>
exp and maybe a ruined circlet in the bargain.  (Tip: always try to mix<br/>
camping and exp gaining together...would make things alot easier on yourself<br/>
in the long run ;)<br/>
<br/>
Evil eyes in Beholder.  The spawn is very fast and you would still gain exp.<br/>
You might just be able to camp this area solo, if not, then you would just<br/>
need one other person with you.  Again, you might just get lucky and get<br/>
some poish bone bracelets in the bargain for your trouble ;)<br/>
<br/>
Divinn in Crushbone.  I dunno, this might be green to you now but I vaguely<br/>
remember killing him with 2 other friends around lvl 20+ and gaining<br/>
exp....You would need 2 other person to be safe in this area in the tower.<br/>
<br/>
The DE guards in front of Lavastorm.  I hunted here with a monk friend.  He<br/>
would go pull the guard and I&#39;ll just heal him from way way back...those<br/>
guards hit hard and are hard to kill.  However, their loot is good and u can<br/>
always zone into lavastorm if thing gets out of hand.<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; You know..I see these messages every no and then about cant find<br/>
&gt; a group and<br/>
&gt; just cannot understand it. No matter where I have been I have always been<br/>
&gt; welcomed into a group within a matter of minutes.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>O trust me, it can happened.  One time I spend a whole night in Unrest and<br/>
can not find a group.  I was around lvl 24 or so.  This might have been due<br/>
to the fact that the server I was on was relatively new at the time and not<br/>
alot of other ppl my lvl were to be found in that zone.  There was only 1<br/>
group there that was around my lvl.  I finally got a slot in that group and<br/>
then they promptly kicked me out cause they promised the slot to a tank<br/>
friend.  The group consist of a shaman, a bard, a rogue, and 2 other tanks<br/>
and they kick me, the cleric, out so that another tank can join their group.<br/>
So that left the shaman as the primary healer....and this was in Unrest of<br/>
all places.  Not the most wise grouping decision on their part I feel.  I<br/>
have never been kicked out of any group before and I find it was very rude<br/>
on their part to invite me and then not 1 min later &quot;O sorry we have to kick<br/>
you out cause we promise a friend she can have a slot in the group&quot; (exact<br/>
wording)....very tackless.  I hope they all died.  O well =/<br/>
