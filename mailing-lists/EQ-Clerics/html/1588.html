&gt; I think once they come out with the add-on and give us new lvls and new<br/>
&gt; spells one cool idea for a heal spell is....... A spell you cast say before<br/>
&gt; you fight and it works like the Bards heal song and heals you a little over<br/>
&gt; time.  Have a icon the shows up like any buffs you have on a stay for 5-10<br/>
&gt; mins.  Maybe later do a group heal spell like this one.  I&#39;m not saying to<br/>
&gt; have to heal us or someone says a lot but just a little over time, maybe<br/>
&gt; have a few, (depends on how many lvls they give us), and say the first one<br/>
&gt; does 5 heal points so many secs, the next one does 20 every so many secs.<br/>
&gt; Just an idea.  What do you all think on that idea?<br/>
