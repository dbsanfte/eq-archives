<div id="ygrps-yiv-1069017279">Heh youre only a level 2 :) Theres a lot more to a cleric than that oh 30 mana you have then.  Like me, at level 28, i have about 850 mana, so i can heal a pretty number of HPs :)<br/>

    Subject: [EQ-Clerics] My Experience With a Level 2 Cleric<br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
        I just created a Cleric today and got him up to level 2.  At the guild shop I noticed so many classes of spells...attack spells, healings spells, and other spells were all handled by different NPC&#39;s.  I&#39;ll be spending A LOT of money on spells.  I do have a minor gripe with clerics, though.  They just don&#39;t have enough total mana, and the Minor Healing spell isn&#39;t strong enough.  I was grouped up with a Warrior and after wasting all of my mana healing him four times, only half of his health had grown back.  Clerics need more mana!  What do you think?<br/>
