<div id="ygrps-yiv-400686822">I was joking to all those that took my slightly warped sense of humor in the<br/>
wrong sense.  I know that Verant is trying to make this the best game possible<br/>
and think that none of their employees has the disrespect for their porduct,<br/>
their customers, or their fellow employees that is shown in that post.  And I<br/>
think they are doing a great job!<br/>
<br/>
I was just blowing off a little stress in a fun, creative way.  I appologize if<br/>
it came off the wrong way.</div>
