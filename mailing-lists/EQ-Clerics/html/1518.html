<div id="ygrps-yiv-46258188">I would definitely say that 14th is the bare minimum that a cleric<br/>
should be going in there.  I went at 13th and vowed not to return<br/>
until I was at least 14th.  As it turns out, I journeyed to Qeynos at<br/>
that time, and now I just made 16th and haven&#39;t been back.  I have<br/>
heard that the aggro range was increased greatly, though.<br/>
  I think there are a lot more options for players at this level aside<br/>
from just Unrest.  I made 16th killing Scarecrows in West Karana.<br/>
Solo&#39;ing blues was iffy, because they hit so hard.  With at least 1<br/>
partner, I was generally ok.  And with 2, we could fight yellows.<br/>
They give great xp, btw, and for some reason, they don&#39;t aggro, even<br/>
though they &quot;scowled at me, ready to attack.&quot;  So you can walk right<br/>
up to them.<br/>
  When my friends weren&#39;t online, I hunted Tovax Vmar in Qeynos Hills,<br/>
occasional wisps, and the barbarian poacher (forget his name).<br/>
  My friends found Everfrost, near Permafrost, to be a great place to<br/>
level from 13th to 14th.  Fighting Orcs, and mammoth calves.  You can<br/>
get xp here til about 17th.  When my group all gets on again, we are<br/>
talking about going into Splitpaw.  When we all get to our high teens,<br/>
we might fight West Karana Bandits.  (we need to get revenge on them,<br/>
anyway) There is also a ghoul camp in WK, but I haven&#39;t fought there<br/>
yet, but I suspect it might be a prime location to hunt at the higher<br/>
teen levels, too.<br/>
<br/>
  So, bottom line is, there are plenty of places to hunt aside from<br/>
Unrest.  Many of these I mentioned are not very popular, either, and<br/>
could be hunted without much interference.<br/>

&gt;I have heard from many many people that unrest is a great place for a <br/>
&gt;cleric<br/>
&gt;to go starting around 14 or so.  I am 17th (almost 18th) and am having<br/>
&gt;serious trouble there.  Last night 6 people from my guild were there, all<br/>
&gt;15-20 and we had a rough time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We were at the back wall pulling from the back door.  We had SoW and invis<br/>
&gt;to undead on the puller at all times, but there were many times where she<br/>
&gt;ended up bringing quite a few too many ghouls.  (tried to pull 1 and<br/>
&gt;suddenly there were 7 of them on us!)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Are we hunting at too high a level, or are we pulling from the wrong place?<br/>
&gt;Or do we just suck?  We only had 2 deaths last night, but many many many<br/>
&gt;close calls.  Lets just say thank god our druid was also saving 50% mana <br/>
&gt;for<br/>
&gt;heals.<br/>
