<div id="ygrps-yiv-116240980">Semi related to the post below, (It would of taken care of the situation<br/>
with low level mobs dropping the box.)  why dont they put level limits on<br/>
items.   In other words, you cant use the BOX unless you are level 30+.   <br/>
That sure would take care of twinking. <br/>
<br/>
With that said, I dont think they should make items that only low levels<br/>
can wear, just limit the level at which you can start using an item.<br/>

&gt; They already changed the items back.  There has been a lot of BS going on at<br/>
&gt; Verant with this box and some people are trying to cover up some bad judgement<br/>
&gt; errors (IMHO).  I don&#39;t think they are getting away with it anymore.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The problem I see with this change if it was intended is the following:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The first Box of Akbar was dropped by a Spectre (level 34+ MOB) and then on some<br/>
&gt; live and dead frogs in Lower Guk- all level 34+.  Then, poof (someone screwed up<br/>
&gt; the box or thought the box was too powerful and decided to nerf it) it starts<br/>
&gt; dropping on level 8 MOBS with the same attributes (would be like a Mithril<br/>
&gt; 2hander dropping on the orc trainer).  This was awhile after the last attempt to<br/>
&gt; change this box to some other item (some research compenent I believe).  So now<br/>
&gt; a whole bunch of level 8 to 11 or so people have a Box that reduces all items to<br/>
&gt; zero weight.  Here&#39;s my take on what&#39;s happening over at the Big House after<br/>
&gt; this was discovered:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ---Verant employee Roleplaying----<br/>
&gt; &quot;We can&#39;t have that.  Let&#39;s make the box only reduce weight by 10%&quot;, says Verant<br/>
&gt; employee A.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;Great idea!  We can say it was a typo in the first place.&quot; says Verant Employee<br/>
&gt; B.  &quot;That way we don&#39;t have to go back to [Verant Employee C who works on the<br/>
&gt; MOBs, but gets updates on what they drop from Verant Employee A and B] and tell<br/>
&gt; him we messed up AND we don&#39;t get caught for screwing up that last table.  Man<br/>
&gt; if that got out, we would look like idiots.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;Not only that, we would actually have to do some more work.  Now, it&#39;s just<br/>
&gt; [Employee C]&#39;s problem and those GM suckers we hired.  Maybe we can piss Brad<br/>
&gt; off again.  Is this like the 3rd time we&#39;ve done that?&quot; replies Verant Employee<br/>
&gt; A.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Employee B chuckles and responds, &quot;Yep!  Man this is so cool!  We get to be<br/>
&gt; jerks to our customers, our boss, and our other employees, but we still get to<br/>
&gt; keep our job!  Meanwhile we can slack off!!   God I love my job.  Let&#39;s go make<br/>
&gt; another box that reduces weight by 100% and give it to our characters.<br/>
&gt; Nevermind, we can do that later- I bet I can take the fire giant solo with all<br/>
&gt; the new stuff I&#39;ve created, but haven&#39;t put into the game yet.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;This is going to be cool!  I hate to admit that I&#39;m just as addicted to this<br/>
&gt; game as those pathetic people who pay to play it,&quot;  Verant Employee A states.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;Me too, but screw them, we rock!&quot;  Verant Employee B ends.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; See, I roleplay with the best of &#39;em!  I am slightly pissed (and only slightly,<br/>
&gt; despite what some of you will think after getting to this point in my post) of<br/>
&gt; at this non-disclosure and piss poor customer service from a company that<br/>
&gt; started off with great customer service and support.  I understand that you have<br/>
&gt; to keep some things (quests, item location, tactics) undocumented and let the<br/>
&gt; players figure it out, but to change things that people are used to in the game<br/>
&gt; and not let them know about it is bad customer service.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I also know what it is like to put together an update for a software package,<br/>
&gt; and I sure as hell can&#39;t get away with not letting people know what I change in<br/>
&gt; our software package.  Can&#39;t understand how you would tell people EXACTLY how<br/>
&gt; you were changing their DOT damage on druid, shaman and necro spells, then go<br/>
&gt; and forget that you changed all this other stuff.  Just seems unprofessional.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sorry for the long post, but I&#39;m long winded and, being a high elf, I feel a<br/>
&gt; compulsion to tell you what is the right point of view  (more roleplaying hehe).<br/>
