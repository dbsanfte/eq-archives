&gt; &gt;Just wanted to open a discussion on Clerics who love to fight.  I am<br/>
&gt; &gt;happy being a cleric, but I cannot resist jumping into the heat of a<br/>
&gt; &gt;battle and kicking some back.  I also like to occassionally tank.  I try<br/>
&gt; &gt;to save all my mana for healing, but sometimes I just love to blast<br/>
&gt; &gt;away.  This is probably because I feel useless when grouped as my<br/>
&gt; &gt;regular attack doesn&#39;t compare to others in the group.  Anyone else feel<br/>
&gt; &gt;this way?  Any experiences to share?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well i VERY rarely use Smite against any critters but i find Holy Might<br/>
&gt; quite a good offensive spell since it prevents the mob from hitting the<br/>
&gt; tanks and thus saving HP. It&#39;s only the undead that i really use my<br/>
&gt; offensive spells against, especially if there are more than one cleric<br/>
&gt; in group. If i find that there is no real danger of anyone getting killed<br/>
&gt; and that i will not need to med to heal them i go in and melee. Doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; it really make you feel good when you finally see the horrible werebat<br/>
&gt; in front of your group slayed down and that you had some real good blows<br/>
&gt; at it? At least i do : )<br/>
