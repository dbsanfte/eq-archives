<div id="ygrps-yiv-1374425939">You&#39;re right about not using your melee skills once you get high level and<br/>
travel with groups to go after the big game.  When I am with a full group of<br/>
my guild and we are doing FGs, or the dragons, or the AM and ghoul savant in<br/>
Lguk, all I do is sit and med and maybe Root depending on what other class<br/>
is with us.  I serve two purposes only during these trips...buff and heal.<br/>
<br/>
However.....I DO melee when it&#39;s just Donzi and I duoing.  When we do the<br/>
bouncer guards at Ogguk or SGs (anything that has to be meleed and not cast<br/>
on, like spectres) I stay at melee with Donzi until he gets to just below<br/>
two bubbles of health, then I throw a complete heal on him, and go right<br/>
back to melee.  With that BEM, I am routinely hitting for 16 - 19, and it&#39;s<br/>
very very fast, so 20 - 30 hits during a battle DOES make a difference.<br/>
<br/>
With the SGs, I do use Retribution a couple of times, since it always does<br/>
516 dmg, and 2 - 3 of these makes a difference in the length of battle as<br/>
well.  I make sure to stand pretty far back when I use Retribution to<br/>
prevent the SG from whacking me.  Donzi has exceptionally high taunt (it&#39;s<br/>
totally maxxed for a level 50 warrior) so he is able to keep them off me in<br/>
the event they do turn on me.  But you can&#39;t cast on those ogre bouncers,<br/>
cause their magic resistance is so high you&#39;re simply wasting mana cause you<br/>
will always be resisted. Nothing to do with them but melee, and Donzi and I<br/>
killed them very very easily alone with both of us at melee and me throwing<br/>
a complete heal on him.  Of course, he does have that incredible sword from<br/>
Fear, and his crit hit has gone as high as 172.  He truly is the best player<br/>
at melee I have ever seen, with over 3000 hps buffed, several great pieces<br/>
of Fear armor and that sword, and all of his his melee skills (both offense<br/>
and defense) maxxed.  There&#39;s nowhere in Norrath (with the exception of Fear<br/>
now) that I am afraid to go as long as I have Donzi with me.  (Which is<br/>
always..heh.)  With all of my cleric skills just about maxxed now, the two<br/>
of us make a great team.  I would heartily endorse falling in love with a<br/>
warrior...*grins*....a cleric and warrior are awesome together.<br/>
