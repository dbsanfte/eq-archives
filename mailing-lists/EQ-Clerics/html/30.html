&gt;Subject: 14 lvl spells<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hello all, <br/>
&gt;I just made 14 recently and wonder if you can help me out with spells.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Any recommendations for 14 lvl spells beside heal and bind?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve been thinking about Halo of Light because I hate the dark but<br/>
&gt;I dont want to spend 7pp on something that a lantern does. Does it really<br/>
&gt;help to see around you when your in the dark or is just in the immediate radius?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There is absolutely no use for such a spell as Halo of light IMHO. When you complete the Screaming Mace quest (Crushbone zone) you will probably have two items which both work as a halo of light. Both Screaming Mace and Shiny Brass Shield provide light to times when i travel in the dark. Don&#39;t spend any money on such a useless spell as Halo of light. But if you are not anywhere near Faydwer then if you absolutely must have some light for the dark times go for it.<br/>
<br/>
For other lvl 14 spells i have Healing, Expulse Undead/Smite all the time memmed and Bind Affinity, Cancel Magic and Invis vs Undead are often memmed.<br/>
