<div id="ygrps-yiv-1732743765">Personally im put off by begging.  It really annoys me when low levs come up and beg for stuff.  I earned everything i have they can too.  Now I will give them nice items or plat if they will do erronds or kill smaller things for me for loot.  Stuff they get ep off of.  For instance im a baker.  I pay 1pp per snake egg brought to me.  I recently ired a newboe to collect 100 snake eggs and i would give him a Black Enameled Mace.  Stuff like that.  Make them earn their stuff they&#39;ll appreciate it more.  Ok I must stop now im sounding like a Old man.<br/>

  I would like to say that you were no where off topic, that is exactly what I was talking about. I was confused because a lot of my friends beg and ask while I myself at lower levels give away extra weapons and PW I earn during the bone chip quest. It&#39;s not much but to me it is since that is all I can do. I don&#39;t normally give stuff to people who are asking, usually to others what feel like talking.</div>
