<b>Subject:</b> Rathe Guilds <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1202789315">A bit off topic, but does anyone know of any guilds on the Rathe that would suit a 21st level cleric?<br/>
As the Rathe has aged and gotten a bit overcrowded, I find it harder and harder to find good people to group with as well as very difficult to find places to hunt that aren&#39;t crammed to 200% capacity. I was thinking perhaps that a guild might be able to help me here, by providing information and good groupmates...<br/>
<br/>
    Any ideas/comments?<br/>
