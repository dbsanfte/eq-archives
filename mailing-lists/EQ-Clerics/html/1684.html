<div id="ygrps-yiv-1093788771">I, a level 14 Cleric, and I was grouped with a level 14 Ranger last night.<br/>
We were wondering around CB last night killing legionnaires. There were<br/>
several occasions when she got party experience and Idid n&#39;t. Can anyone<br/>
explain how this can happen when we are both the same level?<br/>
