<b>Subject:</b> Kill Stealing <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1810997936">Please forgive, for I am new to this list, but here is my problem and <br/>
suggestion for Verant:<br/>
<br/>
My number one problem with the game is kill stealing. This frustrates me to <br/>
no end.  I can&#39;t begin to tell you how long I have been trying for a Shiny <br/>
Brass Shield in Crushbone and how many kills have been stolen from me from <br/>
some mage hiding in a tree.<br/>
<br/>
I think the problem is how Verant determines who gets the kill. As I <br/>
understand it, the single person that inflicts the most damage is awarded <br/>
the kill.  This means that it does not matter if you are grouped and your <br/>
group does more damage than the spell caster.  Does this seem crazy to <br/>
anyone else.  It should work that the groups damage counts as one. I believe <br/>
that this would cut down on the amount of kills that are stolen.  It seems <br/>
like an easy fix and it makes logical sense.<br/>
<br/>
What is everyone else&#39;s opinion, and has anybody heard of Verant commenting <br/>
on this issue?<br/>
