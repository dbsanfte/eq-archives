<div id="ygrps-yiv-702922366"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; can&#39;t or doesn&#39;t do it in time.  I play with a good friend so<br/>
&gt; when I asked him about this<br/>
&gt; he says that he is taunting the mob constantly, but it won&#39;t<br/>
&gt; leave me.  So, don&#39;t just assume<br/>
&gt; the warrior isn&#39;t doing HIS job.  It seems the Mobs will stick<br/>
&gt; with a healer until he&#39;s dead<br/>
&gt; sometimes.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Aye.  For those of you who has never play a tank, FYI taunt isn&#39;t worth a<br/>
crap around low 20s and below.  What I am telling you guys is to always have<br/>
another escape/survival plan if the tanks are unable to pull the mobs off.<br/>
<br/>
If you play with a ranger, ask the ranger to snare or root (snare is better<br/>
though) the mob.  Those spells works as good as taunt...if not better.<br/>
<br/>
BTW once u are at 2 bubbles of health...it is close to impossible for anyone<br/>
to pull those mobs off.  If you ever get that low on health, and the mob is<br/>
still at full health or there are still more then one mob standing...just<br/>
cast divine aura and run towards the zone.<br/>
