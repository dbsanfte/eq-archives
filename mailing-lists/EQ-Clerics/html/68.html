<div id="ygrps-yiv-1132839824">One thing about using cancel magic is that you can only cancel the spells of<br/>
those casters that are at your lvl or below also you cant have buffs if you<br/>
take this root because cancel magic will cancel the buffs first (older<br/>
spells ---&gt; newer spells is the order in which it will cancel) but with cure<br/>
blindness I ahve cured myself when i was blinded by a red muddites so you<br/>
see where cure comes in good:) Also I have had only to cast it once to get<br/>
rid of it nonlike some poisons which can take up to three cast.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Go fight muddites in beholder.  You&#39;ll find a pretty damn good use for<br/>
&gt;cure blindness real quick.  Not to mention any other time one of your<br/>
&gt;party members gets blinded.  Or..  If you yourself get blinded while<br/>
&gt;soloing it kinda puts a kink in your gameplan.  Not being able to see<br/>
&gt;what&#39;s going on can cost you your life.  As with a few other cure<br/>
&gt;spells, it sometimes has to be cast more than once to be effective. &lt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have been using Cancel Magic effectively against the blindness that the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Muddites cause. I have one question: Is it significantly faster to cast a<br/>
Cure Blindness than Cancel Magic? I know cancel magic uses 50% more mana but<br/>
it is so little anyway (20 -&gt; 30) that there is no point in purchasing the<br/>
spell just for that. Besides the cancel magic works for a wider variety of<br/>
things. Very useful when you are rooted, isn&#39;t it? Is there anything that<br/>
could cause blindness and that cancel magic could not cure?<br/>
