<div id="ygrps-yiv-1101463443">Until you come up with a better idea, i&#39;d recommend still doing the sit-in.<br/>
It is well known that it is occurring, so people if they are wise will avoid<br/>
those areas during that time.   If you actually know of a better way to get<br/>
Verant&#39;s attention, then do share...  if not, well maybe the complaints of<br/>
people who are lagging out will help us all in getting Verant&#39;s attention...<br/>
maybe they will realize that if they actually listen to the players it can<br/>
save a lot of headaches for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t get me wrong, i don&#39;t want to cause problems for other players... but<br/>
I don&#39;t know a better way than the sit-in.  When the rangers did it to try<br/>
to convince Verant to give them critical hits with bows, it worked.  Verant<br/>
is supposed to be fixing the problems with feign death, I believe in this<br/>
patch.   So things like this can work... and I am sorry if it adversely<br/>
affects other players for a few hours, but if that&#39;s what it takes to be<br/>
heard then so be it.<br/>

&gt;I have heard this very same thing about Fear, as well as, Hate.  I play on<br/>
&gt;Fennin Ro and it will become bogged down and very lagged if there are that<br/>
&gt;many people and it WILL cause deaths.  I for one was going to hate this<br/>
&gt;friday evening, however we are all reconsidering our fun adventure due to<br/>
&gt;this sit-in.<br/>
&gt;Its bad enough already that Fennin is the most heavily populated servers as<br/>
&gt;it is. I was in West Freeport as I previously stated when the Monk protest<br/>
&gt;took place and Yes I almost died, I was soloing Guard Jendl, when I<br/>

&gt;could not even sit down for pete&#39;s sake, thank god I could walk and<br/>
&gt;turn...So I was able to zone out.<br/>
&gt;I have already stated to you all how I feel about the sit-in so I won&#39;t go<br/>
&gt;there again, but please think of all the other innocent people who just<br/>
