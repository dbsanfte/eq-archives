<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1908406076">I have heard this very same thing about Fear, as well as, Hate.  I play on <br/>
Fennin Ro and it will become bogged down and very lagged if there are that <br/>
many people and it WILL cause deaths.  I for one was going to hate this <br/>
friday evening, however we are all reconsidering our fun adventure due to <br/>
this sit-in.<br/>
Its bad enough already that Fennin is the most heavily populated servers as <br/>
it is. I was in West Freeport as I previously stated when the Monk protest <br/>
took place and Yes I almost died, I was soloing Guard Jendl, when I realized <br/>
I could not longer click icons or use hotkeys to cast any spells at all, I <br/>
could not even sit down for pete&#39;s sake, thank god I could walk and <br/>
turn...So I was able to zone out.<br/>
I have already stated to you all how I feel about the sit-in so I won&#39;t go <br/>
there again, but please think of all the other innocent people who just want <br/>
to have fun and play, who you have a potential to adversely effect with this <br/>
action.<br/>
