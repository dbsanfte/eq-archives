<div id="ygrps-yiv-1141330407">I strongly suggest you stick to one hand blunt.  First<br/>
of all, 2h blunt will cause your stamina to drain<br/>
FAST!  Also, there are many cleric only one hand blunt<br/>
weapons floating around.  Althout the damage is not<br/>
great, it all adds up.  It also gives you the<br/>
opportunity to hold some great wisdom item in your<br/>
other hand.  SOme prefer the testament or paw, but I<br/>
prefer a charred guardian shield.  +9 wisdom plus AC,<br/>
it&#39;s perfect ;)<br/>
<br/>
The symbol line is awesome but does get really<br/>
expensive to cast.  It will be a favorite among your<br/>
party. Currently, I am at level 36 so I have symbol of<br/>
pinzarn.  It costs nearly a plat per cast.  I go<br/>
through approximately 250 of these per week.  But then<br/>
again, I make decent money so it does not bother me<br/>
all that much.  Symbol, guard(holy armor line) and<br/>
valor(courage line) all stack nicely together.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helped a little bit.<br/>
