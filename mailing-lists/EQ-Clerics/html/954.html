<div id="ygrps-yiv-651142658">At your level, the best 2 choices are the Shining Star of Light<br/>
or the Bloodforge hammer.  Of course, you could just continue to use<br/>
the hammer of wrath, too.<br/>
<br/>
To get the shining star of light requires real good Qeynos Priest of<br/>
Life faction (and of course for you to journey to Qeynos).  Be sure<br/>
to read this quest first (it is a qeynos-based quest).  The SSOL is<br/>
a decent 1h weapon that is 6/28, weighs 5 pounds, I think, and casts<br/>
&#39;cleanse&#39;, which removes negative effects.<br/>
<br/>
The Bloodforge hammer is also a Qeynos quest (kind of).  This is what<br/>
I did, while I was in Qeynos increased my PriestsofLife faction by<br/>
doing the blessed oil quest, I found Trumpy Irontoe near the docks<br/>
and killed him (green to me at 12th), and got his head. Be warned, as<br/>
this will seriously lower your faction with some groups in Qeynos.<br/>
The BF hammer is 13/50 2h and adds +10 to saves vs. magic.  It weighs<br/>
10 pounds.  This quest is a Kaladim quest, and you need to be amiable<br/>
with the stormguard(I think) in Kaladim - the dwarven fighter guild.<br/>
I think killing Crushbone orcs raises that faction, so I didn&#39;t even<br/>
have to work on it, it was already amiable when I got there (Kaladim).<br/>
<br/>
I have both of these weapons.  I&#39;m trying to increase my 2h skill, but<br/>
I switch to the SSOL when the going gets tough!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ergo 13th level high elf cleric on test server<br/>

&gt;I&#39;m a level 10 cleric and have enjoyed the journey.  I wanted to be a <br/>
&gt;purely caster cleric so I put 130 points into Wisdom. My strength however <br/>
&gt;is only 60 which means that I can&#39;t equip the stronger heavier armor. <br/>
&gt;That&#39;s okay, I fully expected this, however does anyone know of a good 2 <br/>
&gt;handed or 1 handed weapon that is not very heavy.  I prefer it not to be <br/>
&gt;over 10 pounds, lighter if possible.  Any suggestions would be helpful. </span></blockquote></div>
