<b>Subject:</b> Places to get the heck out of 35? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1713273408">I have been stuck on level 35 for years now... (ok a slight exageration..)<br/>
Someone told me that the specs in Feerrot was a good spot to get out of this<br/>
level... I just spent 4 hours in Kith with a group and only got 25% of a<br/>
bbl. We where fighting many different things including reds...<br/>
<br/>
A few ppl in my group told me they ended up having to solo to get out of<br/>
this level with any type of speed...<br/>
<br/>
Any insight would be appreciated.<br/>
