<div id="ygrps-yiv-1069539214">I am not sure if this is vanity or what, but I sure like the way my female<br/>
high elf looks in her leather armor.  I may just keep it for traveling<br/>
clothes like you say when I start getting some better stuff.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Well, you are in the wrong class if you are big on looks my friend, until<br/>
&gt; &gt;you can get to PoF and get the Mist Armor.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not too sure I agree with this.  With the options of storebought<br/>

&gt; travelling and social occasions.  Although I&#39;d like to obtain Mist Armor<br/>
&gt; myself, it&#39;s just not feasible at this time.  However, you can be as vain<br/>
&gt; (I&#39;m very aware of how my character appears), as any other class.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;You wanna be a good cleric? Mostly likely the answer is yes.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Then you will look like a newbie.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Absolutely, during times of battle you will look like a nightmarish<br/>
&gt; hodgepodge.  However, outside of battle you can still wear your travelling<br/>
&gt; clothes.  I normally carry my mithril breastplate, as well as the rest of<br/>
&gt; my outfit with me, so that when I&#39;m not fighting, I don&#39;t look a mess.  =)<br/>
