<div id="ygrps-yiv-815855406">I think thats a bold plan, but one that I agree with.  Groups should use<br/>
TOTAL damage, so if a group does 2000 dmg and one wizzy does 1000, the group<br/>
shoud get the kill even if each member only did 600.<br/>
If that guy was kill stealing and shouting obscenities, you should report<br/>
him to a GM.  Get him banned and then see if he sells it on eBay :)<br/>

&gt;&gt;I disagree on the moving anyone on lvl 10 and below to another server.<br/>

&gt;and<br/>
&gt;&gt;up, next thing you know you&#39;re on another server and they are still on<br/>
 </span></blockquote>that<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;one and you can&#39;t group or talk to them anymore?  I think only 500<br/>
&gt;&gt;per-server is too little, I&#39;d say 1,000 to 1,500 is cool I&#39;d take 1,950 to<br/>
&gt;&gt;2,000 if they&#39;d put in more places for us to go and hunt and give us more<br/>
&gt;&gt;cool items to loot.  I heard the Glowing Crook you get off Lock Jaw can be<br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt;&gt;pain cause 20+ Wizards kill the steal and get the Crook.  Thats something<br/>
&gt;&gt;else they need to fix, I mean how is it right for me as a Cleric to be<br/>
&gt;&gt;beating the crap outta something and a powerful Wizard comes along and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>with<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;one blast kills it and gets the exp and the loot?  Are Wizards too<br/>
&gt;powerful,<br/>
&gt;&gt;seems like it too me, I know a Wizard that on Lvl 12 was doing over 100<br/>

&gt;That bit about the 100 pt damage spell is not quite correct. I have played<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Wizard, and at level 12 you get Shock of Lightning, which does damage in<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;low 80&#39;s. You don&#39;t get a 100 pt damage spell until level 16. At levels 14<br/>
&gt;and 15, clerics can actually do more damage to the undead (although not to<br/>
&gt;other mobs) than a wizard.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;People hate wizards because they can killsteal, but you know, it&#39;s like<br/>
 </span></blockquote>that<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;old joke: Why do dogs lick their b***s? Answer: because they can.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In Unrest, and other undead dungeons, clerics can killsteal, and a couple,<br/>
&gt;including the notorious Soulbasher (may Brell curse his name and fizzle his<br/>
&gt;spells!) do so regularly. We curse wizards because they commit sins...that<br/>
&gt;we are usually not capable of. But when we are capable, a few clerics will<br/>
&gt;be succumb to temptation and be killstealers as well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It&#39;s funny. I didn&#39;t killsteal as a wizard, but switched characters because<br/>
&gt;of an impression that no one really wanted a wizard. As a cleric, I have a<br/>
&gt;new appreciation of wizards. My thing is healing, and having a wizard in my<br/>
&gt;party can vastly reduce the damage I have to heal, because the mobs get<br/>
&gt;taken down more quickly. Less downtime, less mana expenditure, safer fights<br/>
&gt;against tougher mobs -- a better time is had by all. I really appreciate<br/>
&gt;having a wizard in the party.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The whole killstealing thing is due to a very, very bad design decision by<br/>
&gt;Verant. I.e., that a group&#39;s total damage is ignored in assigning credit<br/>
 </span></blockquote>for<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;kills, and if an outside player has done more damage than any *single*<br/>
 </span></blockquote>group<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;member, then he gets credit for the kill. Brad posted a note about this<br/>
&gt;design decision to the Vault message boards, that was reprinted widely on<br/>
&gt;the news pages. Verant seemed to feel that if a group&#39;s total damage was<br/>
&gt;counted, then groups would steal from individuals.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Duh! Now we have exactly the opposite problem. And why, in a group-oriented<br/>
&gt;game, are we catering to the least ethical, most unsocial, nastiest solo<br/>
&gt;players?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I ran into a guy -- yes, a wizard -- named Odisius, in Unrest on Fennin Ro<br/>
&gt;the other night, who was soloing and killstealing from groups. He said he<br/>
&gt;had no real interest in playing the game, but was only trying to level to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>20<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;so he could sell the character/account on eBay.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This is the kind of person the current damage-assignment algorithm benfits.<br/>
&gt;Aaaccckkk! This is dumb, and make the game frustrating for those who really<br/>
&gt;want to play and enjoy it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am going to send Verant some screenshots of Odisius sceaming obscenities,<br/>
&gt;and describe his behavior, along with a plea to rethink the kill-assignment<br/>
&gt;algorithm. Everyone should email Verant with the same request, talk it up<br/>
 </span></blockquote>on<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;the message boards and newsgroups, and maybe Verant change the code and end<br/>
&gt;this whole killstealing debacle.<br/>
