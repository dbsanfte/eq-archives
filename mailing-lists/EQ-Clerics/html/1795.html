<b>Subject:</b> A Question on Stats... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-70603257">A question about stats...Does the law of diminishing returns come into<br/>
play with our stats? Specifically, do we get less of a return on stats<br/>
the higher they go? My agility is currently 141, and my dexterity is<br/>
129...should I continue to try to find stat increasing items, or will it<br/>
matter at all if I have 5 or 6 more agi than I do now? In fact, does it<br/>
matter very much after 100? <br/>
<br/>
Just curious, that&#39;s all :)<br/>
