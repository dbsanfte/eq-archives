<div id="ygrps-yiv-498478994"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; One sound side effect I have is that I don&#39;t seem to be able to go all the<br/>
&gt; way to the end on the sound detail slider - I can&#39;t get the 3D sounds and<br/>
&gt; all that. Anyone else had this?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Even thought I don&#39;t have a 3d sound card, I was unable to turn the sound<br/>
realism up at all. I had turned it down previously to save resources on my<br/>
slow ass poota, but when it&#39;s all the way down you don&#39;t hear the ching when<br/>
you level. We all know how important that is. :)<br/>
<br/>
Strange I thought, wondering what it could be. Then lo and behold the next<br/>
time I ran EQ the slider could move again.<br/>
<br/>
But don&#39;t start me on system lag (what I&#39;ve always called the non PL or ping<br/>
induced lag). At times I have lost count of how many clicks on &#39;done&#39; it<br/>
takes to get out of my inventory, or to open a door. There are some parts of<br/>
some zones where I get almost a quarter of a frame per second. Usually they<br/>
are the parts you have to go through to escape trains. :&#92;<br/>
