<div id="ygrps-yiv-1399627274"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; It doesn&#39;t spawn once or twice per 24 hours... it&#39;s random.  Some people<br/>
&gt; have to camp for weeks to get legs, but i&#39;ve heard of people getting 3<br/>
&gt; ancient crocks in an hour and getting legs on two of those<br/>
&gt; spawns.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll believe that when I see it with my own eyes &gt;:P~~~~  In my limited<br/>
experience so far in this case, and yes I do admit that my 48 hrs stint is<br/>
considered limited experience, my conclusion bout the ancient croc is that<br/>
he is a shy little beast...well maybe not little.</div>
