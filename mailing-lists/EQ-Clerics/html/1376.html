<div id="ygrps-yiv-2072933311">Well, just too throw in my two cents...<br/>
<br/>
I am a software developer (not with Verant), and I can assure you, there are<br/>
never any conspiracy meetings to thwart our users efforts.  If that were the<br/>
case, we&#39;d lose customers.<br/>
<br/>
That said, ALL SOFTWARE IS RELEASED WITH BUGS!!!  Get used to it.  That is<br/>
never ever going to change.  There is always a tradeoff between stability<br/>
and time to market.  Verant made an excellent decision to release the<br/>
software when it did.  By doing so, it captured market share and loyalty.<br/>
<br/>
As for bug fixes and feature changes, all I have to say is be thankful that<br/>
Verant is committed to providing timely updates.  Not every software company<br/>
is commited to that.<br/>
<br/>
As for the bugs and fixes that are addressed, I&#39;m sure that they do it in<br/>
terms of priority, ease of development, and risk. In Verants case, balance<br/>
in EQ is an ongoing bug.  To fix it, they probably incorporate similar<br/>
techniques used through out the industry.  They evaluate user needs and<br/>
wants, balance that with the schedule, and evaluate how changing one portion<br/>
of the software will effect other portions.<br/>
<br/>
Since none of us work for Verant, I think it is safe to assume that none of<br/>
us can really say what goes on there.  However, it is probably also safe to<br/>
assume that each developer, manager, and employee of that company has great<br/>
pride in their product, and does not intentionally sabotage the way that<br/>
thier users interact with it or enjoy it. <br/>
<br/>
Developing software is different than developing any other product in the<br/>
marketplace, in that changing technologies, user demands, and market<br/>
conditions mature and change much quicker than in most other sectors.  As<br/>
consumers of such products, you need to be aware of this, and accept it as<br/>
reality.  Otherwise, some of you are doomed to nayesaying and conspiracy<br/>
theories forever.<br/>
<br/>
Just my opinion.<br/>
