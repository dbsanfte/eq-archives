<div id="ygrps-yiv-242411443">This is the information I&#39;ve gathered about Gull, but it&#39;s possible that<br/>
it&#39;s wrong... but I think it&#39;s right.   Reguardless it sure hasn&#39;t helped me<br/>
get him... Gull is I think the hardest camp of all of them.  At least all<br/>
I&#39;ve done so far (i haven&#39;t done the bracers or the Glacial Bear yet).<br/>
<br/>
There are 14 regular aviak spawns on the island.<br/>
There is a 15th one that spawns rarely... I&#39;ve been told it spawns<br/>
every 8 hours, but I cannot verify this.   I can however verify that there<br/>
are in fact 14 spawns and rarely a 15th one.  I just can&#39;t verify the spawn<br/>
time on it.  The 15th spawn is on occasion Gull... but very very rarely.<br/>
I&#39;ve been told that this spawn spot will change every 8 hours even if nobody<br/>
kills the place holder.  I&#39;ve also been told that if you have a ranger on<br/>
the island tracking, the placeholer will always be the last bird on the<br/>
list.    The person who told me this said that he knew of at least 2<br/>
instances where Gull had spawned when nobody was on the island.<br/>
<br/>
This is all I know... I&#39;ve been trying for Gull a LONG time and have had<br/>
absolutely zero success with it.    Sometimes i wonder if he really exists.<br/>

&gt;&gt; How often does he spawn?<br/>
&gt; 7 hours or so<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;   Do you have to kill other aviaks to get him to<br/>
&gt;&gt; spawn?<br/>
&gt; Yes. He has a placeholder. Now, knowing which one is the tricky<br/>
&gt;part, so you have to &quot;clean&quot; the island.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;   Does he always drop the ingot?<br/>
&gt; Yes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;   Any other tips or info would be<br/>
&gt;&gt; greatly appreciated.<br/>
&gt; Best thing to do is to clear the island of all birds then log and<br/>
&gt;come back 7 hours later. Took me over 2 months to finally get him, and in<br/>
&gt;that time I went from lvl 27 to 35 =)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Good Luck!<br/>
