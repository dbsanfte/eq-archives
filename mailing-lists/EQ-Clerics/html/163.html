<div id="ygrps-yiv-588094057">So as long as you casted the heal while you targeted yourself, it will still <br/>
heal yourself? It won&#39;t heal the monster, even though, when the spell is done <br/>
casting, the monster is targeted? Or do you have to wait until it is done <br/>
casting on you, for it to work?</div>
