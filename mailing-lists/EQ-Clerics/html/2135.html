<div id="ygrps-yiv-1717568599">There is a totem that is +18 wisdom. <br/>
I too used an observer staff for quite a while.  However as soon as you<br/>
can get a charred guardian shield or paw of opallo, you&#39;ll want to switch<br/>
back to a non wisdom 1h weapon.  (The shield and paw are more wisdom than<br/>
the staff).<br/>
<br/>
I used an enamelled black mace with the shield, or paw with the shield,<br/>
until I got one of the +6 wis ruined maces in kith.  Now I never use the<br/>
shield, I go with the mace in one hand and the paw in the other.<br/>

&gt; LOL.. are you suggesting that you have a +18 Wisdom 1HB weapon??  What do you use?<br/>
&gt; I am hoping to get one of those tarnished morning stars that the undead in Kithicore carry,<br/>
&gt; so that I can have a 1HB with +Wisdom... but for now i&#39;m sticking with my 2HB Staff of <br/>
&gt; Observers which is a very nice weapon.. as fast as a mace, higher damage, and +Wis/+mana.<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s only disadvantage is that it is 2H... <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m level 26, what do you use being up near 50?<br/>

&gt; &gt; If I can find a +18 wis 2HB weapon, I just might give it a try LOL!<br/>
