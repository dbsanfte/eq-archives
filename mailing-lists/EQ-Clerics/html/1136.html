<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-654212911">I agree with most of what Geoffrey said. It is difficult to balance the<br/>
classes in relation to each other. And clerics ARE well balanced.<br/>
However, I still think that clerics should not be able to be stunned<br/>
while Divine Aura is up. I don&#39;t agree with Geoffrey that to change this<br/>
would give clerics a &quot;get out of jail free card.&quot; Many times, there is<br/>
nowhere for the cleric to go even when he&#39;s invulnerable. And often he&#39;s<br/>
too hurt to get to a zone fast enough to matter. In some cases, casting<br/>
Divine Aura merely postpones the inevitable. Since you can&#39;t cast or<br/>
fight, all you have time for is to find a nice cozy corner to die in.<br/>
<br/>
One exception: with DA on, you can sit and memorize gate (unless you get<br/>
stunned, of course!), and hope that you&#39;re lucky enough to get it to<br/>
work after DA wears off.<br/>
<br/>
This being said, I think someone should tell EQVault to update their<br/>
cleric guide. It says that while you have DA on, you can cast Heal on<br/>
your group members and help them get away from the mob by meleeing the<br/>
MOB, which will offer enough distraction for your friends to hightail it<br/>
to safety. Ha ha! Wouldn&#39;t that be nice?<br/>
