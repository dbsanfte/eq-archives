<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1125828148">I hear a few people out there, who believe that having the Sit-in will lag-out people who are fighting in the Planes...I respect this concern.  This is also the reason why I encourage people to spread out throughout all three zones of Freeport.  It would be hard to get all three zones full enough to begin lagging out, and if they did I would encourage people to move even out to North Ro and ECommons.  I have posted these instructions on the web page for this reason only.<br/>
<br/>
On another note, Verant is quite aware of the event at this time, and they plan to do their best in keeping lag down.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all and I hope this is of some comfort to those concerned.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
Norin Grimsbane</div>
