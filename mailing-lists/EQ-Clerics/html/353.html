<div id="ygrps-yiv-1944141943">I agree with locking new people out of new servers, but if you sort your<br/>
servers by people online, you&#39;ll notice Solusek Ro is always in the top<br/>
3.. so we&#39;d need to add this to the list.  What I don&#39;t understand is<br/>
how rarely I hear anything from the people on this server!<br/>
<br/>
I also think that with time, this may cure itself. With new servers<br/>
added, people will migrate and make new characters on a new server where<br/>
there is less lag.  I did this myself on Qeuell!  Go Glog!<br/>
<br/>
I also agree with not moving characters from server to server.  For one<br/>
thing that would take a lot of Verant&#39;s resources which would be better<br/>
put to use making new races, skills and zones. Also it would take away<br/>
from being a newbie on a new server...<br/>

&gt; I think allowing us to move from server to server would be a bad idea.<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; think it&#39;d cause to many problems, just my luck they&#39;d be some bug<br/>
&gt; caused by<br/>
&gt; moving like that and my character would get deleted for good or messed<br/>
&gt; up<br/>
&gt; bad.  But I take it back about hurrying up and giving us that new land<br/>
&gt; mass,<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t want them to rush it and have tons of bugs in it.  But the<br/>
&gt; idea<br/>
&gt; about locking out the newbies to certin servers that is a good idea.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; say Rathe and Xeynos and Finnin Ro should be the main three that they<br/>
&gt; get<br/>
&gt; locked out of for a while.  Not trying to be mean to new players but<br/>
&gt; those<br/>
&gt; servers are getting too many players on them and at times you have<br/>
&gt; TONS of<br/>
&gt; trouble finding a place to hunt and it can also cause TONS of lag in<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; area if there too many players camped there.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Thats true until it settles down.  The other problem is that the<br/>
&gt; server is<br/>
&gt; &gt; overcrowded the begin with.  The main oringinal servers are always<br/>
&gt; over<br/>
&gt; 1500<br/>
&gt; &gt; people in peak hours.  IMHO..  Maybe they should lock full servers<br/>
&gt; up to<br/>
&gt; new<br/>
&gt; &gt; people.  Make them play the less crowded servers.  Or maybe they<br/>
&gt; will<br/>
&gt; allow<br/>
&gt; &gt; people to move from one server to another server with thier<br/>
&gt; charector.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; know this will never happen but who know...<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Then I think Verant needs to really do something about all this.<br/>
&gt; I mean<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; if<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; places like Unrest and Cazic are gonna be so over crowded that it<br/>
&gt; cause<br/>
&gt; so<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; much lag then maybe they should hurry up and give as that new land<br/>
&gt; mass<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; they<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; been working on or something.  But of course once we get this on<br/>
&gt; land<br/>
&gt; mass<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; you know it&#39;ll be crowded for a long time, everyone will be dying<br/>
&gt; to go<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; see<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; what it&#39;s like.<br/>
