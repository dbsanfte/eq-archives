Clerics have a hard time doing the quest?  LOL i am a human cleric and had <br/>
no troule doing said quest, in fact it was one of the easier ones i have <br/>
done.  Now for my question, what exactly does clense do?  I was under the <br/>
impression that it took of negitive effects on the player, tho it always <br/>
seems to clense me when i dont need it, and there are only 30 charges on it.<br/>
<br/>
  I have no clue how to get it recharged.  I am a lvl 24 cleric on Xegony, <br/>
and am now using a screaming mace which i perfer, the SSoL was nice, fast, <br/>
and consistant in the amount of damg it did, but the effect was wasted on my<br/>
<br/>
toon as i never seem to get many neg effects on me.  Suffice it to say I <br/>
gave my SSoL to a noobie that was begging, LOL he loved it and i was happy <br/>
to help, as far as what it is worth, i have no clue as i would pay nothing <br/>
over 20p for it and thats going above the value to me.  It&#39;s prob worth alot<br/>
<br/>
to ppl who want them badly and less to others that don&#39;t.   just INHO, stay <br/>
safe and have fun<br/>

&gt;The SSoL is a funny thing. It is probably worth more than it seems. Similar<br/>
&gt;weapons for pure casters (e.g. Water Crystal staff) I&#39;ve seen selling for<br/>
&gt;100pp+. The SSoL is basically a mediocre weapon, but with a pretty useful<br/>
&gt;effect. Many clerics cannot do the quest (or don&#39;t want to spend time<br/>
&gt;building faction). To them, it may be fairly desirable.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I traded my first one to a lvl 30 Teir&#39;dal cleric in return for a pair of<br/>
&gt;crested spaulders (AC11, +6sta), and I think I got the better deal. So I<br/>
&gt;would say: make your way over to East Commons or Nektulos and you may get a<br/>
&gt;good price.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Second: I know that prices very greatly from server to<br/>
&gt; &gt; server, but what<br/>
&gt; &gt; sort of price range am I looking at if I want to sell my<br/>
&gt; &gt; shinig star of<br/>
&gt; &gt; light mace? around 20pp, around 100pp?? I really have no idea, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; since I am a broke cleric(is there another kind) I would like to get a<br/>
&gt; &gt; proper amount of money for it.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; All thoughts would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks!<br/>
