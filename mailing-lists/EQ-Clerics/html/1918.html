<b>Subject:</b> A Cleric&#39;s Life (Was Re: Mana) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1171632395">Well, I&#39;m almost done with level 45 finally :)  Want to share my EQ life last<br/>
night.<br/>
<br/>
I was in Sol B, the King room.  We had to pull the priest room and the Champ<br/>
room first as we were the first ones there (full spawn).  After buffing everyone<br/>
I was don&#39;t to 40% mana.  We took the first 2 rooms easily. I guess I should<br/>
tell you who we had in our group.  50 Monk, 40 Warrior, 41 Warrior, 42 Ranger,<br/>
39 Druid, and me.  We start spacing the kills in the Kings room so we can take<br/>
them one at a time.  A couple other groups come in and they take the Champ and<br/>
Priest rooms.<br/>
<br/>
Well, after we had spaced the spawn in the King&#39;s room, I would constantly be at<br/>
full mana before the next spawn, so I melee&#39;d along with everyone else, I cast<br/>
Retribution, I ran around the dungeon doing res&#39;s (make almost 300 plat from<br/>
doing them- I don&#39;t charge friends, but these 2 guys I can&#39;t stand died so, even<br/>
though I really don&#39;t like them, I res&#39;d them for money  hehe).  I was doing<br/>
this for several hours when someone pulls 2 LDCs, a Bat, and a Lava Beattle<br/>
through the area- the priest room get&#39;s wiped out (except one who made it to the<br/>
zone), the Champ room made the mistake of thinking they could pick off the<br/>
straggler (the Lava Beattle).  Well, they get all the bugs back and they evac.<br/>
Well, we&#39;re sitting up in the King Room nice and safe.  Zone pupolation went<br/>
from 39 to 18.  One group was in the bug area (other side from where the bad<br/>
pull came from) and one was in the noble area.<br/>
<br/>
We,re sitting there talking within our group &quot;Hope the King spawns this time&quot;,<br/>
&quot;Hey, wouldn&#39;t it be cool if the priest spawned too?&quot;,  &quot;Ya, with the BP&quot;.  I&#39;m<br/>
thinking, okay, so far we&#39;ve had it easy, but the King and Priest at the same<br/>
time is tough!  I say, &quot;If the priest comes up while the King has spawned-<br/>
everyone but [our main tank-level 41 warrior] on the priest or he will heal the<br/>
King until we are all dead.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well LO AND BEHOLD! ..... it never did happen, that would be a really<br/>
interesting story, huh?  But I had a blast being able to swing my mace, cast<br/>
some DD, run around pulling (hehe), and make a bit of money!<br/>

Who loves building up a story, and really did want to fight the King and Priest<br/>
together- just didn&#39;t work out that way :)</div>
