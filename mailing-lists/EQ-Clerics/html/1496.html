<div id="ygrps-yiv-126544973">Ok, I did some research on EQ&#39;Lizer and EQitem and neither list this<br/>
item.  I got the &quot;bands of Tunare&quot; item that I asked about recently<br/>
(that no one responded to) on gamestats, so I suspect they don&#39;t<br/>
exist.  This item is probably fake as well.  Why anyone would go<br/>
through the trouble of faking an item is beyond me.<br/>
It&#39;s probably a fake, or intended as a joke of some kind.  But I think<br/>
that sometimes what one finds off gamestats needs to be taken with a<br/>
grain of salt.  Especially since they don&#39;t keep their equipment/<br/>
weapons sections as updated as some of the other sites.<br/>

&gt;&gt;This weapon is for clerics and it&#39;s a slashing weapon.<br/>
