<div id="ygrps-yiv-31743259">you are right.....i know i was poor then....i had to save every cp i<br/>
got.....saved for a good while just to buy banded at that level....wasn&#39;t in a<br/>
guild till later, but it was a pain.....at least what i did was try to get in<br/>
good groups in unrest.....that helped with some stuff like the savant&#39;s cap, but<br/>
as for the bronze, i couldn&#39;t wear it &lt;darn small sizes....&gt; but if you&#39;re in a<br/>
good group in unrest, they will do a split and stuff like that...giving you the<br/>
bronze weapons and money that they get....i;d say go to unrest at lv 15<br/>
maybe....some of the yard trash has been known to sport bronze weapons on<br/>
occassion.... (;<br/>

&gt; &gt;Invigor can be helpgul if you ever fight underwater or swim for a long<br/>
&gt; &gt;time.  There ARE places where you fight in water.. heh.  Fear is a very<br/>
&gt; &gt;useful spell as well.  I don&#39;t see how yall are so poor.  I&#39;m lvl 18 and<br/>
&gt; &gt;have 110 plat in the bank.  I&#39;ve got a full suit of bronze.. a screaming<br/>
&gt; &gt;mace.. and a shiny brass shield.  Not to mention the wisdom<br/>
&gt; &gt;rings/earrings that i bought for 20 plat.  Sheesh.  Why yall so poor?<br/>
