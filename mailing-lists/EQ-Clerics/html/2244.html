<div id="ygrps-yiv-1528206626">You&#39;re right about it being hard to travel around, but I look at it from a<br/>
RP&#39;ing perspective. Like the first time I snuck through Rivervale....what a<br/>
rush! (actually, there was no sneaking going on, got a SoW and booked to the<br/>
zone) BUT, as most of you know, the best dungeons in the game are accessed,<br/>
or close to, EVIL cities (Cazic, Guk, SolA/B, PoF). This has saved me more<br/>
times than I can count now. ie. Cazic Thule: Big train comes and everybody<br/>
zones to Feerrott...guess what? Bouncer Hurd is on the other side slapping<br/>
down every good race that zones and forces them to go back to that nasty<br/>
train of lizzies. But not me, &#39;cause me and Hurd go way back. Heck, I even<br/>
buffed and healed him for NOT killing me (j/k) Anyway, there are definate<br/>
advantages of being evil at higher levels. From a RP&#39;ing view, I love it. If<br/>
you have never played an Evil race, I would suggest giving it a try to see<br/>
the opposite side of the coin. Nothing better than running for your life as<br/>
soon as you get off the boat in Butcherblock ;)<br/>

&gt; I guess the one thing I&#39;d think about here is not the looks but good <br/>
&gt; vs evil. I just restarted my DE cleric - and I personally think they <br/>
&gt; look good in anything but brass &lt;shudder&gt;. DE&#39;s are limited in the <br/>
&gt; areas that they can go though (or so it seems to me). Seems like the <br/>
&gt; vast majority of areas I&#39;m KOS. I have to be invised by friends to <br/>
&gt; travel the majority of the realms. When you first create the char you <br/>
&gt; are warned that it&#39;s a high difficultly combination. If you want to <br/>
&gt; travel freely you spend a lot of time killing things to raise your <br/>
&gt; faction. I sometimes wish I could move about as freely as a goodie - <br/>
&gt; but oh well - I love my DE.<br/>
