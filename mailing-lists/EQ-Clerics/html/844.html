<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1363558714">ok i have a question, when i first joined this list i was told not to just <br/>
simply reply to a message, that i must first delete the thread.  Since then <br/>
i have done as asked, but alot of ppl are replying to messages without <br/>
deleting the threads, while i understand the reason, NOW, for deleting the <br/>
thread,i do not understand why others don&#39;t delete as well?  i am a little <br/>
miffed about this as it was not asked nicely of me, well maybe i took it <br/>
wrong, but just the same, if i have to delete the threads then why does <br/>
everyone else not have to.  Also i was adding color to the message as i <br/>
thought it looked better and was told not to do that as well!!  oh well i <br/>
was just wondering why i was told to do so and since then i have seen many <br/>
long messages by others.  err ppl i am not slamming anyone i am just asking <br/>
a general question -- thanx for yer time -- anne *hugs*</div>
