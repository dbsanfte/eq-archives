<b>Subject:</b> Re[2]: Sacrement icon and ingot? - Spoiler <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-848849257">I just got my Caducous (sp?) of Sacrement last night.  The ingot does <br/>
     spawn on the red giant skeleton in the undead ruins of the rathe <br/>
     mountains.  He&#39;s not that easy a foe as it took me 3 banish undeads to <br/>
     kill him, he was blue to a L39 cleric.  I was there for mabye 15-20 <br/>
     mins last night and saw 2 of these ingots droped so the spawn is <br/>
     fairly quick on this one.<br/>
     <br/>
     Once you get this ingot and the icon from mistmoor you also need 2 <br/>
     enchanted plat bars (why we need enchanted plat to do our quests I&#39;ll <br/>
     never know) that you turn into magnitized bars in the temple.  Give <br/>
     these to Gavel and you have a nice new 12 dam 32 delay 1 hand blunt <br/>
     weapon (although it just looks like a morning star).<br/>

I heard it spawns on those giant skeletons.. but only on red ones.  I can <br/>
*not* confirm though as I have not seen it for myself.</div>
