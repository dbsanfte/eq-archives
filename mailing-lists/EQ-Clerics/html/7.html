<b>Subject:</b> 15th level to 19th level <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-554773318">What I want to know is....where should I be fighting in order to go from<br/>
15th level to 19th level quickly? I&#39;ve been in Highpass Hold recently<br/>
with a group of 4 others, but the xp for gnolls wasn&#39;t that good, and<br/>
the orcs were camped heavily. I&#39;m in Freeport now, and need a good place<br/>
to go (preferably with a group, as my Smite spell is difficult to cast<br/>
while being attacked!)<br/>
<br/>
thanks,<br/>

Hail all im a 28th Level cleric on the Mith Marr server. Im glad there<br/>
is a list up for all of us clerics to get together and haggle about<br/>
stuff. I would like to respond about the shaman poison spell is better<br/>
then clerics undead, im afraid to say but shaman spells are no wear<br/>
close. Beleive me i have a shaman. Right now im doing 148 damage a pop<br/>
costing me only 90 mana and we all know how fast undead spells recover<br/>
:) <br/>
<br/>
The only other class which are almost equal with us in damage to mana<br/>
ratio are wizards and thats only at higher levels. Don&#39;t think that the<br/>
cleric class is just a band aid class, i get right up there in the<br/>
fights clobbering away. I might only be doing 17 points a hit but when<br/>
your fighting a monster a Mob and do about 200 damage in 40 secs or so<br/>
it adds up. 29th level is the golden level. We get new attack spell<br/>
Wrath which can do up to 198 +2 per level. My undead spells doing a<br/>
whopping 150 damage. Get new spell called Guard which increases AC, get<br/>
Restore spell and New Divine Aura spell which not only lasts longer it<br/>
will rapidly restore hp and stamina.<br/>
<br/>
Well fellow cleric i must be off to fight for justice and honor.<br/>
