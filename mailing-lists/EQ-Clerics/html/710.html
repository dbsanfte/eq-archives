<div id="ygrps-yiv-97784880">o i agree...it totally SUX........not only do they lower the dmg our best dd does by at least<br/>
50 points...&lt;those 50 points make a difference...i was able to solo a greater kobold in sol b<br/>
using 3 rets and maybe one stun...now it takes at least 3 rets and 2 stuns of 85 points&gt; but<br/>
then they dump this freakin rez aura.....and don&#39;t get me started on the no cleric only<br/>
weapons......that and the fact that we can&#39;t wear all mithril like warriors or pallies....only<br/>
thing we can wear is the bp and the bracers...no sleeves, no greeves.....what gives? it&#39;s all<br/>
plate claases EXCEPT for clerics<br/>

&gt; I just did a revive on myself yesterday and was damn surprised to the result. Usually<br/>
&gt; all it does is teleport to corpse and return a little xp. But at that time it did a whole<br/>
&gt; lot more. And all of them were negative side effects. After resurrection i had all my<br/>
&gt; mana drained, had only 50% of HP, had some kind of weakness effect on me and<br/>
&gt; all this without any addition to the positive effects (xp gain). I feel this is a terribly<br/>
&gt; wrong move by Verant. And besides they did not mention a thing about it in the<br/>
&gt; patch message. Why the heck did they do something like this? Do they want to<br/>
&gt; ruin the cleric now that it is perfectly balanced? That would be awfully stupid.<br/>
