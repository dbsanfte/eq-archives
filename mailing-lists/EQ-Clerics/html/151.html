<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I just can&#39;t see why some of you have so many DD spells in.  You&#39;re a<br/>
&gt;CLERIC.  You are here to heal.. to keep the people alive.  The reason<br/>
&gt;behind your spells should be to keep the group alive and yourself. <br/>
&gt;Remember that.  Only 2 people have died that I&#39;ve grouped with.  Both<br/>
&gt;were unavoidable.  (who can stop a train of 12, yes 12, angry mobs.. <br/>
&gt;most of which were yellow or red).<br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well if i am the only DD spellcaster in group i like to use the spell in situation<br/>
where there is no real danger of anyone getting low on health and when we need<br/>
to get rid of the critter real fast.<br/>
 <br/>
And when we have one yellow or red critter which has targetted many members<br/>
sharing the damage i think Holy Might is a great way to prevent the critter from<br/>
doing harm for a while. I just wish it wouldn&#39;t be resisted by the reds so often...<br/>
 <br/>
So i think our only job in party is not just healing, but also assisting the group<br/>
in defeating some of the critters. In bad times i always do heal - med - heal - med<br/>
though. Besides if you just heal all the time it gets pretty monotonous. And i don&#39;t<br/>
keep the party members topped in HP all the time i only heal if they have less than<br/>
80% of health.<br/>
 <br/>
This is just the way i play and i find it enjoyable that way. When i finally have to leave<br/>
from a party they often say &#39;thanks for taking care of us&#39; or something like that. I<br/>
love it.<br/>
