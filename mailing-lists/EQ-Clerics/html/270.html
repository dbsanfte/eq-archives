&gt; I must be missing a very basic piece of information or just suffering from<br/>
&gt; brain fart.  Assume that I don&#39;t have a clue and am probably talking about<br/>
&gt; something different than what YOU mean.  :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m a lvl 13 cleric.  Abjuration, alteration, evocation are AT LEAST at<br/>
&gt; skill lvl 60, and probably divination and conjuration are pretty high as<br/>
&gt; well.  How can that be explained?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I haven&#39;t noticed any better casting ability in any of my spells.  How can<br/>
&gt; that be explained?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If I HAVE specialized, how can I tell which one it is?(they went over 50<br/>
&gt; about 3 weeks ago...I don&#39;t have a clue which was first).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If I HAVEN&#39;T specialized, how do I do it?<br/>
&gt; If I HAVEN&#39;T specialized, what happens to the other 2-4 spell classes that<br/>
&gt; have already gone over 50?  Do they stay at 65, or do they drop back down?<br/>

&gt; &gt; You can specialize in all spell types.  But, once one reaches 51 the rest<br/>
&gt; &gt; will cap at 50, and the skill that reached 51 first will keep increasing.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I am level 30 I trained as much as I could in alteration and I havent<br/>
&gt; &gt; touched the other specialization skills, I want to make sure my specialize<br/>
&gt; &gt; in alt. is the first to hit 51<br/>
