<div id="ygrps-yiv-320484309">Hi all, <br/>
<br/>
I want to do the SSoL quest.  I am a 16th level Hafling cleric of<br/>
Bristlebane.  The problem, I think lies with my faction in the Temple of<br/>
Life. Aeston Wemur cons apprehensive, and when I ask him for the<br/>
instructions, he gives them to me, until I ask him about travelling afar,<br/>
after which he says that the word is out not to trust me.  <br/>
<br/>
THis particualarily sucks because I gave him the honeyjum, and instead of<br/>
giving me the potion, he said my name was bad, not to trust me, etc. And he<br/>
took my honeyjum!!<br/>
<br/>
So, my question is, how do I raise my faction with the Temple of Life?</div>
