<div id="ygrps-yiv-802390514"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Number 1 has the smoothest video of all of them, with the fewest pauses.<br/>
&gt;The 128MBRam also makes zoning a bit faster than the other two machines.<br/>
&gt;(Before the Voodoo3, I had an ATI AllinWonderPro (4M) that would pause<br/>
&gt;reliably every time a new set of textures were needed.)  Unless you match<br/>
&gt;memory, video and cpu speed, you won&#39;t have optimal performance.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There are alot of things that affect how smoothly your game runs. Computer<br/>
memory, CPU speed, video memory, 3D chipset, harddrive speed, swap space. <br/>
<br/>
People&#39;s comments about unloading various TSR&#39;s is to free up memory, swap<br/>
space and CPU. If you&#39;re running something like, say, Seti@home which uses<br/>
ALL avaliable CPU cycles, you&#39;re going to slow the game down alot.<br/>
By unloading any TSRs that access memory, swap space, CPU time or the<br/>
harddrive, you&#39;re going to reduce the resources that the game needs. This<br/>
can show in clipping, packet loss, lag, or even crashing. (I experience<br/>
some crashing because Microsloth has &quot;personality differences&quot; with my SCSI<br/>
card. I&#39;ve asked several times for a *nix version of EQ to be released, but<br/>
they don&#39;t plan on ever doing so. *sigh*)</div>
