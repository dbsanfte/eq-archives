<div id="ygrps-yiv-417954494">Well I am still a level 16 cleric.  lately I have been hunting in oasis with<br/>
me and a level 17 warrior.  Pretty much we have figured the system down<br/>
pack.  He obviously tanks it and I dont do anything except hit it and heal<br/>
him.  I never use any other spells.  I did use Smite on the DW Croc or Ca<br/>
but it just seems to waste more mana and we have to wait a bit longer so I<br/>
can med.  So now we just bang away and when he needs I heal I heal him.<br/>
Then there is no wait time for me to med because I have about 75% mana left<br/>
after the fight and we do pretty good with me casting Smite.  I noticed with<br/>
multiple clerics in a group one would usually be the dedicated healer the<br/>
other would be the cleric who casts Smite and the emergency healer in case<br/>
the other cleric gets hit.  We as clerics are primary goal is to keep our<br/>
members alive.  Sometimes its a hard job to keep.  <br/>

Hi. I&#39;m new to this mail group but thought I would put in my 2cents here. I<br/>
am a level 10 High Elf Cleric on the Rodcet Nife server. I regularly group<br/>
with a Paladin and a Wizard. They know better than to tell me that my only<br/>
job is to sit back and heal. I jump right in with them and watch their<br/>
health rather intently. If I see that they need my services, I back out,<br/>
heal them and then get right back in. I don&#39;t tank as the Paladin enjoys<br/>
doing that herself. I will often times use that little strike spell to get<br/>
the targets attention. My attack isn&#39;t all that great but at least I feel I<br/>
contribute more than just an occasional healing spell or buff to the group.<br/>
No one has complained yet.<br/>

&gt;Just wanted to open a discussion on Clerics who love to fight.  I am<br/>
&gt;happy being a cleric, but I cannot resist jumping into the heat of a<br/>
&gt;battle and kicking some back.  I also like to occassionally tank.  I try<br/>
&gt;to save all my mana for healing, but sometimes I just love to blast<br/>
&gt;away.  This is probably because I feel useless when grouped as my<br/>
&gt;regular attack doesn&#39;t compare to others in the group.  Anyone else feel<br/>
&gt;this way?  Any experiences to share?<br/>
