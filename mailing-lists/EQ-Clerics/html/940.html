<b>Subject:</b> Cleric&#39;s and PvP <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1723572060">Has anyone tried healing or buffing a NPC or a MOB. I play a Cleric on<br/>
Rallos Zek (PvP) and my main rationale is I like to heal. I play a &quot;good&quot;<br/>
cleric and have healed bad/good races. My main irritation is when I&#39;m<br/>
suddenly PK&#39;d by a member of my own race. (High Elf. I hang my head in shame<br/>
at my fallen brothers and sisters)<br/>
 <br/>
Anyway normally there is a +/- 4 range for PvP correct? It seems to me that<br/>
the Cleric is uniquely positioned so that we can severely inconvenience<br/>
other players far below our level. If they are fighting a MOB can we heal<br/>
the MOB? Can we buff it? I must admit I have never tried it, I just thought<br/>
of it. Has anyone any experience of this??<br/>
 <br/>
