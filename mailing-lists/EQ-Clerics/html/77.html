I think i never did anything that could worsen my faction standing with them. So do i need to raise my faction standing with them before they will talk to me? Or is this similar case as when any Elf tries to trade with the Innkeeper at Kaladim (I think Irontoe something was his name) and he always turns them down. I&#39;m also having the same problem with the human clerics in Freeport. Do i really have to go all the way to Kaladim to be able to use my training points?<br/>

I too have a female, dwarven cleric - 9th lev on Fennin Ro.  I&#39;m also<br/>
having difficulty training in Rivervale.  They just don&#39;t seem to like<br/>
dwarves. I&#39;ve had to go to Freeport to train, which I was able to do<br/>
after hunting around the temple a bit for the right person.  Even then,<br/>
there were several people who wouldn&#39;t have anything to do with me.<br/>
<br/>
Is there some sort of faction hit because of my god, or is it something<br/>
else?<br/>
