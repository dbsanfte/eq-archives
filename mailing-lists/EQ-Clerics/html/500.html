<b>Subject:</b> Starting a New Cleric Suggestions Please ~ Possible Repeat <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1904933969">Sorry If this is a repeat. I am having problem with my mail!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am going to move to the Race war server. If I had a choice I would play a<br/>
High Elf Cleric. Which I play on Rallos Zek and Love, Lots of Manna.<br/>
<br/>
However all my friends want to be on the human team. Barbarian, Erudite or<br/>
Human.<br/>
So any ideas on what is best to pick and your reasons. Obviously the choices<br/>
are Erudite or Human.<br/>
<br/>
The Erudite has more Wisdom <br/>
<br/>
Str  Sta  Ag   Dx   W    Int  Ch             <br/>
65   75   70   70   93   105  70  +30<br/>
<br/>
but the Human is a better all rounder<br/>
<br/>
Str  Sta  Ag   Dx   W    Int  Ch     <br/>
80   80   75   75   85   75   75  +30<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I looking for people with high level Clerics 20 plus as I do not want figure<br/>
out I&#39;ve made a mistake later.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
