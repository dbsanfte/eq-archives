Go kill the place holder.  Bind in the corner, and login and gate there every 7 hours and 5 minutes I think it is.  That way you &quot;control&quot; the spawn.  He will spawn some day...I killed probably 10 placeholders, then he spawned twice in a row (7 hours apart of course).  Now I have gaunts.  Next up is greaves and bracers. :)<br/>

    I agree completely!  <br/>

    I have obtained everything but the gloves and chestplate (two of the hardest pieces probably).  Wow, I mean they really give Everquest a great name!  I get to sit in Befallen for hours, and hours killing waiting for a lucky roll of the dice.  After I&#39;m done, I get to go over to Dagnors Cauldron, and compete with every druid on the server for Bilge, this is a great set of quests!  I can&#39;t believe with all the changes, that once again the cleric was over looked.  For christs sake the druid got his tracking raised!  Oh sorry, those poor druids help em out some more, they aren&#39;t getting enough!<br/>

        Warning... a serious rant follows:<br/>
         <br/>
        [Rant begins]<br/>
         <br/>
        I just read the patch notes for the new patch and I must say I am EXTREMELY displeased.   I&#39;ve been hearing rumors for a couple of weeks from many different sources that this new patch was going to improve the situations clerics have with the HORRIBLE camps the have to do to get their armor.   Well, this patch seems to have enhancements for just about everyone except clerics.  Not one single thing in it to effect clerics.  Even the armor of Ro, they say they are chaning it to increase the drops.  That is just BS.  I will be the first to admit that the paladin armor quests are hard.  They are very very hard.  But they aren&#39;t hard becasue of the rarity of drops!!!!  Most of their stuff drops relatively often... though it is hard to get (i.e. the caudrons in mistmoore).    How many days now have I been camping that freaking Aviak in the OOT???  Just about every cleric i&#39;ve talked to who is trying to get that, has been camping it for like 2 months and not gotten it.  Those who have gotten it say it took them about 2 months.  What&#39;s worse is that I still have 3 or 4 camps to do that are as bad or worse.  This is absolutely absurd.  People like me with jobs and lives outside of EQ cannot possibly do these quests and it just pisses me off to no end.    I had thought that there was going to be some relief with his patch... maybe there will be and it just wasn&#39;t documented... but seeing as how they documented enhancements for just about every single other person in norrath  I really doubt it.   I guess all the feedbacks from every cleric in Norrath just doesn&#39;t matter to Verant.   <br/>

        Heh.. well i won&#39;t stop trying for the armor.. i&#39;m determined to get it which makes me wonder about my own sanity since i probably won&#39;t even wear it in most situations.  I just want it for pride.. and it will make something very nice to wear to events like weddings and stuff.    Though it&#39;ll be months and months before i have it anyway...<br/>
