<div id="ygrps-yiv-1385881587">I would agree it is a personal choice :)  At level 40 I have both 1HB and 2HB skills at about 100 which is about half of max for my level - and honestly this is because for the past 15-20 levels I don&#39;t melee - hardly ever.  Weapon/Shield slots for me are used to gain as much +wis as possible ;)  I can whack a MOB if necessary - but I usually cast.<br/>
