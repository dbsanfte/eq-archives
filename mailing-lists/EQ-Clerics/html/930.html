<b>Subject:</b> RE: My Experience With a Level 2 Cleric <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1436370032">At level 40 I have no problems with  mana.<br/>
I&#39;m<br/>
using Superior Heal for tanks, and greater healing for caster types.<br/>
Even grouped with level 50&#39;s I can keep them healed to full without mana<br/>
problems during a fight.    With 181 wisdom at level 40 I have 1528 mana.<br/>
If I have an enchanter with me and he casts insight on<br/>
me my mana goes up 1600+.    The key is mana management,  never heal<br/>
someone too early, make sure the full effects of your heal are going to be<br/>
used and not wasted.      The only exception I use to this rule is if<br/>
someone who drops fast starts getting hit.  (I.E. Wizards, Enchanters.)  I<br/>
tend to let loose with my quick heal spell (GH)  a lot sooner than I would<br/>
on a tank.<br/>
<br/>
Also, if you ever get in a group with a Bard and Enchanter, the mana song,<br/>
clarity combo is insane,  the mana regens so fast you hardly ever are oom.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; and other spells were all handled by different NPC&#39;s.  I&#39;ll be spending A<br/>
&gt; LOT of money on spells.  I do have a minor gripe with clerics, though.  They<br/>
&gt; just don&#39;t have enough total mana, and the Minor Healing spell isn&#39;t strong<br/>
&gt; enough.  I was grouped up with a Warrior and after wasting all of my mana<br/>
&gt; healing him four times, only half of his health had grown back.  Clerics<br/>
&gt; need more mana!  What do you think?<br/>
