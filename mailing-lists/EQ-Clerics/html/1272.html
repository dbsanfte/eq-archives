You are missing the entire point of my post.  I am talking about the<br/>
principle itself.  That no one group of people should be discriminated<br/>
against or treated differently or penalized because they happen to be of a<br/>
higher OR lower level.  THAT is the point.  And it doesn&#39;t matter whether or<br/>
not you can buy the item from someone else....and believe me, I have tried<br/>
to buy the rings and they are getting more costly than the Box of Abu-Kar IF<br/>
you can even find them.  But again, that is NOT the point.  It is the<br/>
PRINCIPLE behind Brad&#39;s yield policy that I am saying I feel is just flat<br/>
wrong because it treats groups differently, which I do not believe is fair.<br/>
A broad sweeping policy change such as this is going to create significant<br/>
problems from my viewpoint, especially among higher levels such as myself<br/>
who are now attempting to acquire certain items I haven&#39;t gotten in the<br/>
past, for whatever reason.<br/>
<br/>
And yes, I do know there are higher level jerks out there who feel they can<br/>
push their way into any area and take what they want just because they are<br/>
higher level and have more fire/melee power.  But I am not responsible for<br/>
the actions of these people, who will exist in any online game you play, and<br/>
I certainly don&#39;t believe responsible, mature players like myself should be<br/>
penalized because of them.  And in my experience, bitching at these types of<br/>
people, as you suggest, is a waste of time and effort...you can&#39;t change<br/>
people, and they will continue to play as they will, good or bad.<br/>
<br/>
Again, I feel the policy should be...first there stays there, and then the<br/>
next in line gets the spot, regardless of level.  This is the fair way to do<br/>
it.<br/>

&gt;Its funny to see this on a CLERICAL  HELP list first off....secondly....why<br/>
&gt;cant you go and BUY the item from the lower levels then?  Granted, you cant<br/>
&gt;do this with all of the lower levels....but do you know how often I&#39;ve had<br/>
&gt;higher levels come in without as many principles as most of you?  Why dont<br/>
&gt;you start bitching at those who HAVE gone and made this a problem?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Example:  I&#39;m in Blackburrow one day.  The onyx earrings have to be one of<br/>
&gt;the SIMPLEST things to get ahold of.  A Magician, lvl 27 walks in, says<br/>
 </span></blockquote>he&#39;s<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;here to get the earring, and he&#39;ll take everything until he does....if we<br/>
&gt;dont like it....LEAVE.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Yeah, this is a great attitude people. We had 2 of the damn things to sell,<br/>
&gt;and offered them and his answer:  &quot;WHy should I buy from a lower level when<br/>
&gt;I can get them myself.&quot;  Or then we have the fact that I can pick these<br/>
&gt;suckers up at HOW MANY merchants?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;For the paw of opalla quest you could EASILY purchase the damn rings from<br/>
&gt;lower levels who got them....not only does it get rid of some of that cash<br/>
&gt;you had sitting around doing NOTHING, but it keeps everyone happy.<br/>

&gt;mik, i agree wholeheartedly....there are items i&#39;d like to get as well,<br/>
&gt;because<br/>
&gt;i wason&#39;t able or didn&#39;t know about them till the mobs wouldn&#39;t give me<br/>
&gt;exp....seems the fair thing to do is what you said...&lt;paraphrased&gt; first<br/>
&gt;come,<br/>
&gt;first serve<br/>

&gt;&gt; I&#39;ll tell you what my whole opinion is on this camping/yield issue.  I<br/>
&gt;think<br/>
&gt;&gt; the<br/>
&gt;&gt; first group there stays there, regardless of their level.  And noone<br/>
&gt;is able<br/>
&gt;&gt; to throw<br/>
&gt;&gt; another group out if that group was there first.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; I have wanted a nightshade wreath and gem sceptre for ages.  So today,<br/>
&gt;&gt; myself and 5 other level 50s went to camp MM castle.  Everything there<br/>
&gt;was<br/>
&gt;&gt; green to us, but myself and a level 50 shaman friend wanted wreaths<br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;&gt; sceptres, which we didn&#39;t have.  Under Brad&#39;s rule, if a group of<br/>
&gt;&gt; level 35+ comes, and they can get exp for that area, then we have to<br/>
&gt;yield<br/>
&gt;&gt; and give up a spot we have been at for hours. Tell me where the<br/>
&gt;fairness in<br/>
&gt;&gt; THAT<br/>
&gt;&gt; rule is.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Since there are very few places I can get exp anymore and have maxxed<br/>
&gt;&gt; out level 50, I am going around and getting items I don&#39;t have because<br/>
&gt;I was<br/>
&gt;&gt; focusing on exp and helping others level as well.  I plan to do the<br/>
&gt;Paw of<br/>
&gt;&gt; Opallo quest next.  Mitty is green to me, as is Gynok Moltar.  Should<br/>
&gt;I have<br/>
&gt;&gt; to leave camping them just because lower levels come to camp for the<br/>
&gt;same<br/>
&gt;&gt; items I<br/>
&gt;&gt; want?  I think that is totally unfair. Just because I am level 50<br/>
&gt;doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;&gt; mean I&quot;m not<br/>
&gt;&gt; entitled to get items I don&#39;t have just because the mobs don&#39;t give me<br/>
&gt;exp<br/>
&gt;&gt; anymore.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Again, my opinion is....first there stays there.  Then when they<br/>
&gt;leave, the<br/>
&gt;&gt; next group in line gets the camp spot.  I don&#39;t think levels should<br/>
&gt;have<br/>
&gt;&gt; anything to do with who gets the camp spot.  I don&#39;t think high levels<br/>
&gt;&gt; should force lower levels away from a camp spot, and I don&#39;t think<br/>
&gt;lower<br/>
&gt;&gt; levels should be able to force higher levels away if they were there<br/>
&gt;first.<br/>
&gt;&gt; To do it any other way discriminates against one group over another<br/>
&gt;(higher<br/>
&gt;&gt; vs. lower).<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; And I&#39;ll tell you this....if a GM tells me to leave a camp spot I have<br/>
&gt;been<br/>
&gt;&gt; at<br/>
&gt;&gt; for hours for an item I don&#39;t have that I want just because some lower<br/>
&gt;&gt; levels  arrived and want my spot, then I won&#39;t be playing EQ for very<br/>
&gt;&gt; much longer.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; The only fair way IMO is first there stays there, regardless of level,<br/>
&gt;then<br/>
&gt;&gt; whomever was next gets it next, and so on and so on.  Get in line and<br/>
&gt;take a<br/>
&gt;&gt; number.  No one group of players should be favored over another.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; To do it Brad&#39;s way, would mean that any player that didn&#39;t get an<br/>
&gt;item<br/>
&gt;&gt; while he/she was<br/>
&gt;&gt; able to get exp from that particular mob could basically never get<br/>
&gt;that item<br/>
&gt;&gt; cause they could be<br/>
&gt;&gt; thrown out of the camp spot everytime lower levels came along.  This<br/>
&gt;is<br/>
&gt;&gt; totally not fair.<br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;What does everyone think of this Yield Policy?  In case you never<br/>
&gt;heard of<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;it, it Brads new way of getting rid of high lvl characters camping<br/>
&gt;lower<br/>
&gt;&gt; lvl<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;spawn points.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;This is what he said but it<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&quot;If a higher level player who would get no exp for the kill is<br/>
&gt;camping a<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;spawn, and a group of players that would get exp (meaning they should<br/>
&gt;be<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;there) wants to fight there, the higher level player must yield. The<br/>
&gt;lower<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;level group has the right of way.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;As for the other disciplinary information in that post, it sounds<br/>
&gt;like the<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;same policy that&#39;s always been in place: if you are warned several<br/>
&gt;times<br/>
&gt;&gt; and<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;continue to break the rules, you will be banned.&quot;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;Do you all think this will work or just tick off a lot of players?<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m not<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;sure if I&#39;m for it or not, but also remember if your a camper doing<br/>
&gt;this<br/>
&gt;&gt; and<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;you&#39;re warned a few times you&#39;ll be banned from the game.  I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;really<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;camp, I do in a few spots but not a lot but only in places that give<br/>
&gt;me<br/>
&gt;&gt; exp.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;He said it wouldn&#39;t be actively enforced till it was officially<br/>
&gt;announced.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;Some ppl are wanting us to be able to vote yes or no on it but as of<br/>
&gt;now<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;Brad isn&#39;t letting us vote<br/>
