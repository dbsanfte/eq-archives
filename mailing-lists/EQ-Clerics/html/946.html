<div id="ygrps-yiv-94415418">I&#39;m a level 10 cleric and have enjoyed the journey.  I wanted to be a purely caster cleric so I put 130 points into Wisdom. My strength however is only 60 which means that I can&#39;t equip the stronger heavier armor. That&#39;s okay, I fully expected this, however does anyone know of a good 2 handed or 1 handed weapon that is not very heavy.  I prefer it not to be over 10 pounds, lighter if possible.  Any suggestions would be helpful.</div>
