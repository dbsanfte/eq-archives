<div id="ygrps-yiv-444128642">This was a quest that not many would&#39;ve found out about unless someone<br/>
would&#39;ve talked about it.  I wouldn&#39;t have known about it if it wasn&#39;t for<br/>
someone else, neither they nor myself say anything to truely give it away.<br/>
Nothing wrong with giving a hint away or saying theres a quest.<br/>
