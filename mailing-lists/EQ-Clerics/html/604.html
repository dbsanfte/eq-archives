<div id="ygrps-yiv-588051043">Glad someone else mentioned it, when i made 14 bought my spells, and didnt<br/>
know if any components were needed. But, since i just did a stint in the<br/>
pixies/fairies had a bunch of gems on me. Spell went off but at lev-14<br/>
didnt see any great improvements from center +holy armor, especially since<br/>
the gem cost about 3g+.<br/>
