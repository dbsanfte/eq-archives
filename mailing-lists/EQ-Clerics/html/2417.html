<div id="ygrps-yiv-1991481459">Thats Great to hear that your friend enjoys playing his paladin, perhaps all <br/>
is not lost.<br/>
My thoughts on it though are this, Sure you can buff the pally up, he&#39;s got <br/>
a good amount of HP, but the funny thing is, is this...because he is not <br/>
dishing the damage, the mobs pay absolutely no attention to him, so......I <br/>
don&#39;t have to heal him.<br/>
Saturday night we did the fire giants, Not once through the whole night did <br/>
I have to heal the paladin......I must also add to that though, if he wasn&#39;t <br/>
there I would have died, he had to Lay Hands on me, Fire Giant decided I was <br/>
to be his next meal apparently, lol<br/>
<br/>
I agree everyone looks at their roles differently, just like clerics play <br/>
varying levels of our class, I&#39;m sure the other classes play that way as <br/>
well.  What bothers me is to see someone playing a game we choose to play, <br/>
devote immense amounts of time to, pay for, then not have any incentives to <br/>
continue.  No sense of accomplishment or satisfaction for their efforts, <br/>
instead Verant continues to take away and/or neglect the classes that need <br/>
the most help.<br/>
