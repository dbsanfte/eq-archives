&gt; Heck if even druids can get a weapon (Wee Harvester) that only they can<br/>
&gt; equip i bet there is a cleric only weapon somewhere around Norrath. I&#39;d be<br/>
&gt; surprised if not. It&#39;s just damn hard to come by. But even if there isn&#39;t that<br/>
&gt; kind of weapons i&#39;m still happy playing my cleric. At level 25 i am doing less<br/>
&gt; melee than never before because the mobs hit my party members so hard<br/>
&gt; that i need to be very careful in watching their health. Especially if there<br/>
&gt; are pure casters in group.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The first time we had a tough situation in Mistmoore and i had to do greater<br/>
&gt; heal twice on a party member all the critters suddenly attacked me and i was<br/>
&gt; slayed in a matter of seconds. I was the only one to die on that assault.<br/>
&gt; Sometimes clerics life is hard :(. That has not happened again though. We<br/>
&gt; killed plenty of inkies there that day *grin*. And i did get enough melee that<br/>
&gt; day that i was able to max out my 2HB skill for the level that i just had<br/>
&gt; gained. Now i need to max my 1HB skill... there is a bit more work to do.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>After comparing my class to others, I must say I am happy being a<br/>
Cleric.  The best weapon we could get (in my opinion) would have to be<br/>
the observer&#39;s staff.  It&#39;s 12 DMG, 35 Dly, 5+ Wis and 5+ Int.  That&#39;s<br/>
pretty close to what some of you have been looking for.  I am quite<br/>
happy with this weapon, but I must say I really don&#39;t need a better one.<br/>
<br/>
The reason for this is that as I gain more levels, and venture into the<br/>
harder dungeons (Cazic Thule etc.) I realise that my duty as a healer is<br/>
above all else.  I find myself healing our tanks and casters more often<br/>
than anything else.  However in Cazic, since the lizzies are smart,<br/>
they&#39;ll tend to attack the healer on the first or second heal you make<br/>
(if there is more than one), so my advise to you, would be to<br/>
concentrate on buffing yourself with armour, wisdom, and invulerablity<br/>
spells.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
I personnaly would love to see Cleric only weapons.  Even if it isn&#39;t<br/>
the greatest, we all, as healers would have something to show that would<br/>
be unique to us.<br/>
