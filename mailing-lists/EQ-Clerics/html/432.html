<div id="ygrps-yiv-229122908">what you need to do, then is save it to a gif....still kinda big, but<br/>
not as big as a bmp.....since paint basically sucks, &lt;sorry my opinion<br/>
and i&#39;m entitled to it&gt; but i&#39;d look into finding a program that can<br/>
read bmp and jpeg, and save to jpeg...i know there&#39;s plenty out<br/>
there...can&#39;t think of any off hand, but i know they are out there<br/>

&gt;       when you take shots in EQ, they will appear as bmp files in<br/>
&gt;      your EverQuest dtoirectory, and you can open em like that<br/>
&gt;      and save them as whatever file format you want...i use<br/>
&gt;      paintshop pro 5, but anything that can read bmp and change<br/>
&gt;      em to jpeg will work (:<br/>
