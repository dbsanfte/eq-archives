<br/>
have you considered taking a positive approach to things, rather than<br/>
simply engaging in shooting down everyone else&#39;s ideas simply because<br/>
you disagree with them? <br/>
<br/>
The idea proposed - that group damage count more than individual damage<br/>
- would go a far way towards ending the &quot;solo wiz killstealer&quot; syndrome<br/>
that seems to have alienated vast swaths of people towards the wizard<br/>
class.  You did offer up the rather odd suggestion that killstealers<br/>
would then form groups to steal kills; whle this might be true, it would<br/>
limit the actual areas that killstealers could affect on any given<br/>
server (because 6 killstealers forming a group leaves 5 areas open), and<br/>
it would also be less feasible because of the argument that someone else<br/>
put forth - that killstealers by nature are ineffectual groupmembers and<br/>
the groups would disintegrate.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
