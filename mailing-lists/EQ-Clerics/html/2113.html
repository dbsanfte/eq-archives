The Karana server crashed on halloween and my pl went from consistently<br/>
0 to consistently 10% min with major spikes every day.  The server is<br/>
junk and Verant appears to dumb to replace it.  I have no problems<br/>
helping anyone who comes but if my cleric wasn&#39;t 37 and my necro 22 I&#39;d<br/>
move to a different sever cause this one just adds frustration.  This is<br/>
not just my connection either, all the time in every zone you&#39;ll see<br/>
shouts &quot;is anyone else having lag/pl/server spikes&quot;<br/>
