&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m new to the game (as a cleric or otherwise) so all these<br/>
&gt; spells are kind of confusing to me.  Some spells, like healing<br/>
&gt; are obvious, but others like &#39;lull&#39; are not so.  Is there any<br/>
&gt; source on the web that defines all these spells?<br/>

harbor (shark infested) i found an odus pearl on the ground under a shark.<br/>
Now sharks are very aggressive. I cast lull on it, swam right up, picked it<br/>
up and swam away.  It lowers a creatures aggressive level.<br/>
