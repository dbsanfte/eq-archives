<div id="ygrps-yiv-1253366796">Dear confused ones:) Okay I know how confusing this is but Ill make it<br/>
real easy for you all:)(took me a while  To understand). &gt;&gt; Specailization<br/>
is a skill that you can practice just like evoke,abjuration,alteration...etc<br/>
you have 5 specialization slots you can practice each one. Know if you click<br/>
on one the npc will say &quot;Would you like to practice your skills in<br/>
Specializing in Evoke,if you click on the next specialize slot they will say<br/>
&quot;Would you like to practice your skill specializing in Alteration and so on<br/>
for all 5 of your spoecialization slots.(Each specialization slot represents<br/>
each one of your magery skills evoke,abjuration,alteration,conjuring,and<br/>
divenation, so each slot al;lows you to specialize in one of those 5 So its<br/>
like this (not the exact order)1. Specialize in Evoke &gt;&gt;slot 2. Specialize<br/>
in abjuration &gt;&gt;Slot 3. Specialize in Alteration&gt;&gt;Slot 4. Specialize in<br/>
Divination&gt;&gt;Slot 5.Specialize in conjuration...get it?? NOW the first one of<br/>
your specialization slots to get over 50 points will keep going up then the<br/>
rest will be capped at 50 points. So put about 10 points into the one you<br/>
are going top use all teh time wait till it gets almosyt to 50 before you<br/>
specialize in any other magery skills.Specializing does not cap your<br/>
abjuration,conjuration,evokekation,alteration,or divination(theser are<br/>
totaly different skills from all the specialization skills) skills.<br/>
Specializing allows you to cast faster use less mana, and interruptions are<br/>
drastically reduced. So if you pick Specialize in alteration to go over<br/>
50points teh rest will not go over 50 but Specailize in alteration keeps<br/>
goping which makes any spells that use the alteration skill Use less mana ,<br/>
be more effective, longer duration, faster casting of that skill,and you<br/>
will be intterupted alot less or at least you&#39;ll recover alot more. So you<br/>
get it now &gt;&gt;Specialize in Alteration is one skill, Alteration is another&lt;&lt;<br/>
So when you get better at specializie it says &quot;You have become better at<br/>
Specializing in Alteration(67) but it still says &quot;You have become better at<br/>
Alteration(165)&quot; See what i mean guys hope you understand that cus my<br/>
fingers hurt:)<br/>

&gt;I must be missing a very basic piece of information or just suffering from<br/>
&gt;brain fart.  Assume that I don&#39;t have a clue and am probably talking about<br/>
&gt;something different than what YOU mean.  :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m a lvl 13 cleric.  Abjuration, alteration, evocation are AT LEAST at<br/>
&gt;skill lvl 60, and probably divination and conjuration are pretty high as<br/>
&gt;well.  How can that be explained?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I haven&#39;t noticed any better casting ability in any of my spells.  How can<br/>
&gt;that be explained?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If I HAVE specialized, how can I tell which one it is?(they went over 50<br/>
&gt;about 3 weeks ago...I don&#39;t have a clue which was first).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If I HAVEN&#39;T specialized, how do I do it?<br/>
&gt;If I HAVEN&#39;T specialized, what happens to the other 2-4 spell classes that<br/>
&gt;have already gone over 50?  Do they stay at 65, or do they drop back down?<br/>

&gt;&gt; You can specialize in all spell types.  But, once one reaches 51 the rest<br/>
&gt;&gt; will cap at 50, and the skill that reached 51 first will keep increasing.<br/>
&gt;&gt; I am level 30 I trained as much as I could in alteration and I havent<br/>
&gt;&gt; touched the other specialization skills, I want to make sure my<br/>
