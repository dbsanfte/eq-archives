Don&#39;t Panic, you started out with a good base for wisdom but Mik is <br/>
absolutely right.  As for putting points into strength, well I made the same <br/>
mistake when I made Bree, but all is not lost.  I might scare you all in <br/>
saying my Base wisdom is 89, frightning isn&#39;t it?<br/>
My current wisdom at my level is 180 without our enchanters buff, which <br/>
bring me to 192.  Yes I screwed up bad making Bree, but almost every piece <br/>
of equipment I have is wisdom enhancing, Strength is not gonna make a damn <br/>
bit of difference at high levels. These are my stats without any enhancing <br/>
buffs.  Str106, sta95, agi95, dex80(yuck), 180wis, 95int, 72cha......My dex <br/>
used to be higher, this is also important, but it will go up again when I <br/>
get the PoF bracers.  I am going to be taking a big dive in str soon -18 to <br/>
be exact, in order to use the new Pearl kedge totems, I am getting 2 of them <br/>
so in total I will lose 18 str but gain 36wisdom, more mana keeps my tanks <br/>
alive, I very rarely if ever melee.  The only time I am doing a good deal of <br/>
DD is in Lower Guk(undead side) I can with my wisdom cast Banish undead <br/>
10times doing a damage total of 5850points.  But my group knows that my mana <br/>
management skills are good, when we invite someone out of the ordinary to <br/>
our group, we usually let them know what we expect of them and what they can <br/>
expect from us and the leader just tells me &quot;Bree, you just do what you do&quot; <br/>
they don&#39;t tell me to only heal, or only damage.  They trust my judgement.<br/>
<br/>
At your level, you will probably not have an over abundance of wisdom items, <br/>
I know I didn&#39;t, most of my items have been attained from lvl30+. I <br/>
personally would not suggest wearing plate, maybe some Blackened Iron(really <br/>
heavy) or bronze for now til you can get wisdom items I.E. BS tunic, Gator <br/>
legs. There is really no reason to spend all that money on platemail just to <br/>
look cool unless you are rich.<br/>
Back in my younger days, I was wearing Patchwork leather until lvl 20 and <br/>
then Banded mail up til i got my BS tunic and ruby legs, then I got the <br/>
gator legs and ditched the ruby.<br/>
<br/>
Just my thoughts,<br/>
