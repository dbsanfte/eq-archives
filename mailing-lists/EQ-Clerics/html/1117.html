 </span></blockquote>Level 41<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I would add that Flash of Light is great for offense and defense.<br/>
&gt; If the opponent is not used to being blinded it will freak them out and if<br/>
&gt; they do not have there spells memmed it disables them. It uses small amount<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I sometimes use flash of light,  one problem I have found however, is that<br/>
they can still cast on you if they are blinded.  I did not think this was<br/>
the case, but the one duel I lost was because a shaman friend of mine<br/>
nuked me hard while he was blind.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; rooted I ran round the back of them and start hitting them. From the back no<br/>
&gt; melee weapon effects you.  I always use a 1 handed weapon (fast=28) on the<br/>
&gt; principal that I have more chance to interrupt other players casts. I seldom<br/>
&gt; use stun though after that post I will reevaluate it. ( I just hate to waste<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; look for you all he has to do is cast, unless of course he is being pounding<br/>
&gt; from behind which puts them off.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again,   maybe I should of clarified,   I didnt give my exact step by step<br/>
methods, but when I stun and move behind the caster, i&#39;m right next to<br/>
them whacking away with my black mace.<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I would also suggest not to be hesitant to use divine aura quickly.<br/>
&gt; Especially if rooted. One hope is that you can be aided by other players.<br/>
&gt; Otherwise the general wiz technique is root and nuke. If they don&#39;t notice<br/>
&gt; (or do not understand) they may waste a lot of manna.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree..<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; However I have in general lost to casters, mainly because the Pk&#39;s on Rallos<br/>
&gt; tend to wait till your health is at the last bubble while fighting a MOB<br/>
&gt; then kill you with one/two unexpected blasts. Which Sucks.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>From people I have talked to, clerics are great in duels, I know a level<br/>
50 wizard who&#39;s only duel loses have been to clerics.<br/>
