I am currently a lvl 15 cleric an the Rathe server. My <br/>
recommendations for a weapon would be to try to find a mob that <br/>
carries a staff. Great worn staff is an excellent 2h blunt weapon, <br/>
but do not neglect your 1h blunt skill as you will be in dire need of <br/>
it at higher lvls. I usually switch between my 1h and 2h to keep both <br/>
at an equal lvl. <br/>
As far as spells goes I recommend getting as many of them as <br/>
possible. With the possible exception of Cure Blindness which I have <br/>
yet to find a use for. <br/>
