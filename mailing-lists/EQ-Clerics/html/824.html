&gt; Brad also talked about Plane of Fear and he&#39;s idea on how to keep low lvl<br/>
&gt; ppl out of it.  Heres what the post on EQVault said<br/>
&gt; &quot;Brad also stated that he was looking into a way to keep the low levels out<br/>
&gt; of the Plane of Fear. Perhaps something like the gate leading to the plane<br/>
&gt; doing damage to those who walk through it. Thus killing any low level player<br/>
&gt; before he even gets a glimpse of the plane.&quot;<br/>
&gt; Gee thats real fair, &quot;Hhhhmmm, I wonder what this gate is?&quot;  *ZAP kill!!!*<br/>
&gt; I say let them in but make it harder for low lvls, just like a low lvl<br/>
&gt; player wouldn&#39;t want to go to Unrest and if they did it&#39;s their fault when<br/>
&gt; they die.  Maybe put up a gate but around the gate have monster that would<br/>
&gt; jump low lvl players.  But for the gate to hurt EVERYONE and kill the low<br/>
&gt; lvls to me is very unfair.<br/>
