<div id="ygrps-yiv-1423919380">I travel in Nro alot it seems and I have been in there when Rahotep has <br/>
Spawned I tracked him when I was getting my Divination up and He spawned at <br/>
least 2 times while I was doing it. I tracked him When I was at the Derv Camp <br/>
next to the Oasis Zone so I beleive that when He spawns if not killed right <br/>
away He walks Near the Zone. I know that it was him because I was there when <br/>
the People Killed him although they did not get the Scepter.<br/>
