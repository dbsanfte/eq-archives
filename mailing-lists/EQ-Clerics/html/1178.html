&gt; AOS!!!!!!  Have you been lurking on this list unbeknowst to me? *thwaps her<br/>
&gt; bud Aos*<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hey everyone, I want you to meet Aosinator Lightbringer, level 50<br/>
&gt; cleric/wannabe tank on The Rathe and my running mate in EQ ever since P4.<br/>
&gt; She is a VERY knowledgeable cleric and will be able to help us LOTS here on<br/>
&gt; the list with her experience.  I owe all my early patchwork and later banded<br/>
&gt; to her wonderful sewing and smithing skills.  With all the money she made,<br/>
&gt; she was also able to buy me all my spells up to level 24.  She was without a<br/>
&gt; doubt the richest level 15 cleric you ever saw.  Had over 2000 plat in the<br/>
&gt; bank which she spent on all 6 of our group for armor and spells.  I&#39;d of<br/>
&gt; still been in patchwork at level 24 with about 4 spells if it weren&#39;t for<br/>
&gt; Aos.  &lt;hugs Aos tight tight&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Mik (who thinks she has to behave now that she knows Aos is watching her!!<br/>
&gt; LOL) </span></blockquote></div>
