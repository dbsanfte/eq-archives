<div id="ygrps-yiv-1871207021">Ok i have keep quiet long enough !!  Beg if you choose to- or not for those <br/>
of you who think beggers are a lower from of life  but plz remember this my <br/>
friends--when a begger (r/l or game) says can you help me-look upon them and <br/>
think to yerself, There go I, but for the grace of God!!  Sheesh yesterdy I <br/>
was in Qeynos, and a player asked me if i had any spare armor or weapons <br/>
that i could help a low lvl brother with and I without hesitation said LOL <br/>
yes I do.  I took him to bank, gave him stuff i was saving for my other <br/>
toons, including a shineing star and a GLS,(i just had finished the quest <br/>
and changed to a screaming mace, also armor of leather and 4PP.  Gave him <br/>
advice on where to hunt, and what quests would be good for him.  Now i ask <br/>
you, how hard is it to give someone who is lower a helping hand??  For <br/>
Christs sakes, i can earn it again or i can buy it, whats the big deal--this <br/>
is a freaking game and r/l emotions should not come into play here.  Yes you <br/>
all have a right to yer standards, but again a game that is called <br/>
role-playing is just that, a game!!!  LOL chill out and try to have some <br/>
fun, heh this list amazes me.  I do not get annoyed at ppl who ask, if i can <br/>
help them i do, if i can not i POLITELY tell them i can not.  There are too <br/>
many rude ppl in this game, and for those of you who are gonna ask &quot;did you <br/>
earn it&quot;,  DON&#39;T, cuz i earned everything i have.  one last thing, its hard <br/>
to start out fresh, we all know this, but try to remember what it was like <br/>
when ya did, and help when ya can, even if someone is asking for it.  I ask <br/>
for SOW on occation and i offer to pay for all that, i never ask anyone for <br/>
anything usually cuz i enjoy doing it the hard way.  Ok sorry i am done now  <br/>
plz remember this is only a game and have fun.  BTW why get annoyed at ppl <br/>
who can make 80-120k a year from begging?? you go to work everyday and, LOL, <br/>
so do they, heh, begging IS their job!!!!  and this is in no way directed at <br/>
the writer of this letter alone, i just used this one to do my reply.<br/>

&gt;I hate people who beg almost as much as people who train me, worse than <br/>
&gt;people<br/>
&gt;using ooc or shout for stuff that should be done in say.  Once had a guy <br/>
&gt;that<br/>
&gt;was using auction to give his group battle commands- that pissed me off.  <br/>
&gt;That&#39;s<br/>
&gt;what the /ignore is good for.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;ABSOLUTE worst thing is people begging for money or items.  I give away <br/>
&gt;free<br/>
&gt;heals and buffs, but for a level 8 to ask if they can have my BE Mace, that <br/>
&gt;cool<br/>
&gt;cloak, or that thing on my head really pisses me off.  Now I&#39;m really <br/>
&gt;getting<br/>
&gt;going so &lt;RANT ON&gt;  The res requests are starting to really piss me off.  I <br/>
&gt;do a<br/>
&gt;few for some lower level characters in Mistmoore, next thing I know there <br/>
&gt;are 17<br/>
&gt;people asking me to res their body 2 and 3 times.   I don&#39;t mind sitting <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;medding for an hour or two to clean up Guk or Sol B, but mid level peeps <br/>
&gt;asking<br/>
&gt;me repeatedly (every 2 to 3 minutes) while I&#39;m deep in the castle sucks.<br/>
&gt;Sometimes I miss messages from my party because the text screams by.  All <br/>
&gt;these<br/>
&gt;peeps are like level 20 to 27.  Next time my response is going to be &quot;You <br/>
&gt;take<br/>
&gt;the risks being here, so either get used to dying or get outta this zone&quot;<br/>
&gt;/ignore xxx.<br/>
&gt;&lt;RANT OFF&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;PC begging really sucks, just like it sucks in RL.  A couple years ago an<br/>
&gt;article was written in the LA area about the street beggars who make $80K <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;$120K a year.  This just pissed me off.  Here I go to college, get good <br/>
&gt;grades,<br/>
&gt;work my tail off and make less than someone who doesn&#39;t take a shower, <br/>
&gt;doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;brush their teeth and doesn&#39;t wash their clothes for weeks at a time?  Made <br/>
&gt;me<br/>
&gt;sick.  If I played on a PvP server (especially one without the +/- 6 level <br/>
&gt;rule<br/>
&gt;like Rallos) begging would be an instant death penalty for anyone that did <br/>
&gt;it to<br/>
&gt;me.  I would actually hope that their bind point was right in front of me <br/>
&gt;so I<br/>
&gt;could keep killing them for awhile.  I like making statements.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Yes!  I have very strong opinions!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
