<div id="ygrps-yiv-2031473285">we are poor cuz not only do we pay for armors, we pay for spells.  and the<br/>
reagents to use them.  So therefore we are poor saps ;)  (Bloodstones for<br/>
instance for Rylatan are a mere 7gp - 1pp depending on faction/charm :)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; A question:<br/>
&gt; Despite clerics traditionally being a poor class, I suspect that many<br/>
&gt; clerics do one or more trade skills... Anyone? My favourite is baking<br/>
&gt; because you can cook on the move.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have a question of my own, why is the cleric traditionally a poor class<br/>
(fund wise)?  Is it due to the fact that we med so much that we forget to<br/>
loot?  I have been hunting with the same group of ppl since lvl 15 and we<br/>
are all pretty fair about loot.  However, the other day we took in a dwarf<br/>
paladin, and my gosh, he was a greedy little bastard.  Looted everything in<br/>
sight.  However, when hunting with my group, I usually get a good<br/>
split...it&#39;s the monk who I feel sorry for...he can never carry anything so<br/>
he doesnt loot...but he is the richest one amongst us...=/<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I was thinking of starting pottery or maybe brewing.  Brewing would<br/>
guarantee me an in on any party and pottery, will, just seems unusual enough<br/>
to do.  Too bad we can&#39;t have alchemy or that would have been my first<br/>
choice.<br/>
