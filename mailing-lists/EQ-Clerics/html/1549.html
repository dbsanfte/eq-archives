    Subject: [EQ-Clerics] Ok, complaint time!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
    Hi,<br/>
<br/>
    I have never publically complained about EQ, but lately, the lag has<br/>
literally been killing me!<br/>
<br/>
    I&#39;ve noticed, that the past week has been extraordinarily bad for lag.<br/>
Sure, I get lag now in then in the past, but the past week, the lag has been<br/>
unbearable.  Though the strange thing  is, my lag metre doesn&#39;t show any<br/>
lag.  I have experience the following problems:<br/>
<br/>
    1) Travelling:  When travelling, I get these pauses, where the whole<br/>
screen sort of &#39;stops&#39; every 10 - 15 seconds.  This makes long trips over<br/>
zones very annoying.<br/>
<br/>
    2) Fighting:  Two nites in a row now, I have been in Befallen, and had<br/>
mobs trained on me.  NOrmally, I can outrun them to safety.  But the past<br/>
while, the lag seems to prevent me from casting spells and hitting back.<br/>
However, the mobs seem to do the same amount of dmg no matter what the lag<br/>
situation is.  I know you may think that I am just expressing sour grapes<br/>
for dying, but it isn&#39; t the case.  I have bee killed many times before, and<br/>
rightly so.  But the deaths lately, when related to lag, seem to give the<br/>
mobs an unfair advantage.<br/>
<br/>
    3)Item usage: Lag has prevented my door keys from working right away in<br/>
Befallen. I find I have to click things two or three times to get them to<br/>
work.  This applies to looting, selling, trading, and using items such as<br/>
keys.<br/>
<br/>
    Any ways, I just want to know if any of you have had any of these<br/>
problems of late.  I am really trying to figure out if this is a link<br/>
related problem, or if a recent patch affected playablility in this manner.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
    Chris.</div>
