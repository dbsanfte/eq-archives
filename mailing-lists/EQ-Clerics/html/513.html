<b>Subject:</b> Re: EQ - worse rpg ever? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1876657295">I disagree whole- heartedly. I have played RPGs since the age of 8 (I am 26 <br/>
now), and I have played many multi-player RPGs (when they were first invented <br/>
around 1986 or so)  where roleplaying was great, and one of them was very <br/>
recent- a year ago to be exact. Of course there were questions where someone <br/>
will ask what level you are or the monsters hit points, but there was also a <br/>
great deal of roleplaying, so it didnt matter -  I have even  been OOC on <br/>
*more* then one occasionof times myself. But people were there because it was <br/>
a different world to escape to. Norrath to me is an empty world.<br/>
  I have never been in a game where so many people ripped me off so they can <br/>
get more money to buy that next cool item.  I can understand if your <br/>
character is a thief or some other mischievous being that follows a deity of <br/>
that sort- but  how many times has this happened to you - <br/>
  1)  A  paladin left you for death while you were fighting off monsters- and <br/>
he/she ran without thought of honor or disgrace - as what he would say to <br/>
explain the situation - &quot; I didnt want to  lose &quot; a half bar of experience&#39;&#39; <br/>
  2) A  holy cleric  said to you &quot;It&#39;s a nosave lightstone&quot; in Kerra isle <br/>
(Before nosave lightstones were implemented in Kerra isle)<br/>
 3) A person following a deity of &#39;goodness&#39; loot every corpse in sight even <br/>
though it wasnt his/her turn. <br/>
 4) A person diband your group to join another group for more &quot; experience&#39;&quot; <br/>
rather then enjoying the moment of adventurers  for the cause of good <br/>
adventure.<br/>
 5)  A ranger or druid killing a bear, lion, elephant, etc - for &quot;exp or to <br/>
increase my &#39;tailoring skill&#39; &quot; <br/>
 Etc, etc..the list goes on. I expected these things to happen, but I have <br/>
never met a single perons in EQ that actually tried  to adhere to their <br/>
character.  The world of EQ is full of greed and who can be the next &#39; <br/>
coolest high level character&#39;. <br/>
