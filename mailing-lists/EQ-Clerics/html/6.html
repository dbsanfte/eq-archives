<div id="ygrps-yiv-848705095">Hail all im a 28th Level cleric on the Mith Marr server. Im glad there is a list up for all of us clerics to get together and haggle about stuff. I would like to respond about the shaman poison spell is better then clerics undead, im afraid to say but shaman spells are no wear close. Beleive me i have a shaman. Right now im doing 148 damage a pop costing me only 90 mana and we all know how fast undead spells recover :) <br/>
<br/>
The only other class which are almost equal with us in damage to mana ratio are wizards and thats only at higher levels. Don&#39;t think that the cleric class is just a band aid class, i get right up there in the fights clobbering away. I might only be doing 17 points a hit but when your fighting a monster a Mob and do about 200 damage in 40 secs or so it adds up. 29th level is the golden level. We get new attack spell Wrath which can do up to 198 +2 per level. My undead spells doing a whopping 150 damage. Get new spell called Guard which increases AC, get Restore spell and New Divine Aura spell which not only lasts longer it will rapidly restore hp and stamina.<br/>
<br/>
Well fellow cleric i must be off to fight for justice and honor.<br/>
