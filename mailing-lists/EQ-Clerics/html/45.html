<div id="ygrps-yiv-1127477087">My lvl 16 cleric duels quite abit.  I typically duel within my guild to tune<br/>
my skills.  I have once beaten a lvl 18 ranger within my guild and I<br/>
regularly beat a lvl 16 wizard in my guild.  Against another caster the<br/>
fight usually starts with us both rooting one another (of course I&#39;m buffed<br/>
prior to battle).  Then the spell casting starts.  As long as my Smite goes<br/>
off before there bolt or other spell I&#39;ll win.  Each time they start to cast<br/>
a spell I hit them with a furor which interupts their casting.  Then I<br/>
follow it with another smite.  I typically exert all my mana on offensive<br/>
spells against a caster.  By the time I&#39;m oom I usually have three-quarters<br/>
of my life and their at around a quarter.  I then move in and melee them<br/>
with a screaming mace until submission.  Casters don&#39;t have many hit points<br/>
so fall easy to a melee.  The  only time I get in trouble is if their smart<br/>
an dinvis th emselves after I exaust my mana<br/>
then they hide somewhere and meditate then root me and I&#39;m hosed.  Against a<br/>
fighting type... I usually tie them up w/ unconventional spells.  First<br/>
rooting them.. then dispelling any buffs that they have.  I&#39;ll follow up w/<br/>
a smite or two and then start melee.  I usually have them to three quarters<br/>
hp by now and am full my self.  Then I melee them for a bit until I&#39;m down<br/>
to about a bubble and a half and their about half health.  Then I&#39;ll root<br/>
them again... I&#39;ll back up and cast 2 HEALING on myself bringing me to full<br/>
health.  I usually have a bit of time here so will med for the few seconds<br/>
that I can to get that half bubble of mana.  Then the root wears off and<br/>
they come charging... I&#39;ll smite them again and try to finish them off in<br/>
melee.  The best I&#39;ve done against a fighter type is 2 lvl&#39;s higher than I.<br/>

&gt; Hail fellow Clerics,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I have witnessed and read about many adventurers dueling to<br/>
&gt; test their skills or to settle a dispute.  However, I have<br/>
&gt; never seen a Cleric duel nor have heard of one.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Since we are in charge of Saving lives, how do we tune<br/>
&gt; ourselves to Take a life? Clerics are far from being cowards,<br/>
&gt; but to decline a duel or be somewhat at a loss durring a<br/>
&gt; potential guild war, can bring shame upon the class.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   So I ask, are there any dueling clerics out there that can<br/>
&gt; lend their experiences to a beginning duelest?  I am a level<br/>
&gt; 19 cleric but I wish to open the discussion to all levels.<br/>
&gt; Tips for fighting hybrids, magic using classes, and especially<br/>
&gt; adventureres that are of lvls higher than yourself.<br/>
