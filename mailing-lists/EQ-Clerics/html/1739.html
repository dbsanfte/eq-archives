&gt; I was under the impression that the paw of opalla was no trade - therefore<br/>
&gt; not really &quot;a dime a dozen&quot;  And I would never begrudge another cleric a<br/>
&gt; good item.  The rings are NOT no trade - so it IS possible to purchase<br/>
&gt; them - though they are excessively costly to get from another player.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not NO DROP so I believe you can trade it.  I&#39;m told that someone<br/>
sold one for 4000pp on Erolissi Marr but I can&#39;t confirm that story.<br/>

&gt; group and hunt her, you don&#39;t have to rely on smite alone if you have a<br/>
&gt; group - everyone in the group could get experience, thus no one would mind<br/>
&gt; overly helping you to camp.  (Druids seems to like the paw also - you can<br/>
&gt; get a druid to help you camp and help you to kill Mitty - and get both of<br/>
&gt; you the rings)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I camped there for 30 hours total to get the ring, most of that time I<br/>
was with one of the following: lvl 35 cleric, lvl 24 druid, lvl 20<br/>
druid. I also got other druids/clerics popping in to see if she was<br/>
camped.  So it is possible to group (but will lengthen your total camp<br/>
time considerably if the others are after rings too)<br/>
<br/>
What I did to help disuade KSing was to give any extra rings I got to<br/>
another kerra that I wasn&#39;t going to kill. That way if someone came<br/>
along that needed the copper or silver rings I offered them them in<br/>
return for looting rights on the first gold ring.  Then just told them<br/>
which kitty to kill.  That worked nicely for me.  Just remember to give<br/>
the kitty your ring then loot Mitty to get a replacement since you can&#39;t<br/>
carry two at once (being LORE).<br/>
