<div id="ygrps-yiv-893579509">Giving bone chips to Lushun Novashine works, but the faction gained<br/>
is very slight.  The blessed oil quest, while slow and tedious, is<br/>
free and does seem to raise it much more.<br/>
  There is also another quest, where you can kill the monk standing<br/>
by the tree.  Occasionally, you&#39;ll see Estle attacking him.  Forget<br/>
his name.  I never did kill him, but he is a traitor to Rodcet and<br/>
converted to Bertoxxulous.  I suspect killing him will raise faction<br/>
with priestoflife, too.<br/>
  Say to the priest (Aeston Wemore) &quot;I will be traveling afar&quot; if he<br/>
says he can not trust you, or whatever, you can&#39;t do it.  And you&#39;re<br/>
right, amiable is not good enough.  After I made amiable I had to do<br/>
the blessed oil quest about 3 more times.  So, somewhere between<br/>
amiable and warmly (or is it kindly?)<br/>
  The halflings name in Rivervale is Kizzie Montopp and she is just<br/>
to the left, coming out of Fool&#39;s guild in an herb shop.  I was<br/>
actually &#39;dubious&#39; to her, and despite her threats of calling the<br/>
guards on me, she still gave me the honeyjum.<br/>
<br/>
  Also, a quick note on the bloodforge hammer, you do not have to<br/>
have done ANY quests for Byzar (is that his name?) Bloodforge in the<br/>
warrior&#39;s guild in Kaladim.  I had never met the guy, was amiable<br/>
anyway (because of killing so many Crushbone orcs) and gave him<br/>
Trumpy&#39;s head, and he gave me the hammer.  It&#39;s a dirt simple quest,<br/>
just kill one guy, give him the head.  It&#39;s just that it&#39;s on the<br/>
other side of the world.  And the head is nodrop, I believe, so you<br/>
have to do it yourself.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;If you attempt to get the SSOL (Shining Star of Light)  You need faction<br/>
&gt;good with only the Qeynos (Rodcet Nife) Clerics.  I&#39;m one of Mithaniel&#39;s<br/>
&gt;(Marr).  So naturally they didnt accept me....I got the factions up in <br/>
&gt;these<br/>
&gt;ways.(this WILL work currently, they fixed most faction quests)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;There is a wandering brother, wanders newbie area and goes up along <br/>
&gt;platform<br/>
&gt;to the &quot;Ufo.&quot;<br/>
&gt;Give him 2 bone chips and he will heal you, and increase faction with <br/>
&gt;Rodcet<br/>
&gt;Nife Priests of Life.<br/>
&gt;(I bought a slew of chips :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also:  Hail the 3 priest on right. (should be 2 guys one girl)  and he will<br/>
&gt;ask you to deliver blessed oil.  Take the blessed oil to the brother in<br/>
&gt;Karanas, go out the exit of Qeynos hills on the path to High Hold.  You&#39;ll<br/>
&gt;see a Tree jut outside the path, USUALLY the brother (estelle) will be <br/>
&gt;right<br/>
&gt;there.  if he isnt:  hang a left. there should be some house to the left,<br/>
&gt;he&#39;s usually right in front of a house there.  hand him the oil, and you&#39;ll<br/>
&gt;get a faction increase.  He will sometimes give a 2nd quest in return (gave<br/>
&gt;me it alot after i got to indifferent)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I continued this till I was amiable (the blessed oil and bone chips)  and<br/>
&gt;then did the brother Hayle quest....taking the prayer beads estelle gave me<br/>
&gt;to the high priestess he mentions (it flies by so scroll back) and then<br/>
&gt;running to split paw and handing them over.  (I was lvl 21 when I did this<br/>
&gt;so nothing attacked me)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I did this quest because:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;There is a priest when you first walk into the temple on the left.  (name<br/>
&gt;begins with an A) You can tell if you can do the SSOL quest if you hail <br/>
&gt;him,<br/>
&gt;and continue along the lines of going out to take the word of rodcet nife<br/>
&gt;(there is a quest for near and far, forget exact wording)  the one is a<br/>
&gt;quest for the clothspinner sisters, which is level restricted, and the <br/>
&gt;other<br/>
&gt;is a cure for a guy in west karanas, if he asks you to help with this cure,<br/>
&gt;you can now do the quest.  if not....you&#39;ll just waste your honey jum :( (I<br/>
&gt;wasted 3 learning this, had friends holding them ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;For honeyjum...kill bixies in rivervale.  get 3 honeycombs, walk into a hut<br/>
&gt;to the RIGHT of the tavern. (circlular brown hut with rogue guild) and a<br/>
&gt;woman there will make it for you.  (the priest in qeynos gives her name)<br/>
&gt;Give her 3 honeycombs, 5 gp and she (regardless of faction) will hand over<br/>
&gt;the honey jum.  (I was &quot;eyes you with apprehension&quot;)  take this jum to the<br/>
&gt;priest on the left in qeynos who gives the quest, he will give you a potion<br/>
&gt;in return (jum AND potion are lore)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Take this potion to the guy he indicated in the karanas,  he&#39;s along the<br/>
&gt;shore line in West Karanas, so its a quick walk.  hand this guy the potion<br/>
&gt;(he even says he&#39;s sick) and he will thank you, and give a rusty scythe<br/>
&gt;which is lore.  Take this scythe back to the same priest (first one on left<br/>
&gt;side) and he will give you the SSOL.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Now....as I said....EVEN IF FACTION IS AMIABLE IN QEYNOS WITH PRIESTS OF<br/>
&gt;LIFE....CHECK TO MAKE SURE HE WILL GIVE YOU THE QUEST.  I&#39;m amiable...but<br/>
&gt;had to get REAL close to &quot;warmly&quot;  in order to even GET the quest.  I know<br/>
&gt;some Qeynos clerics who can even get the quest!!!!!  He kept saying I <br/>
&gt;needed<br/>
&gt;to prove myself to Rodcet Nife.....after I did the brother Hayle quest<br/>
&gt;(prayer beads after blessed oil) I seemed to prove myself....and I&#39;ve <br/>
&gt;gotten<br/>
&gt;2 SSOL&#39;s so far :)  (Currently using it too)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;6/28,  cleric paly only, and effect is CLEANSE (removes poison and<br/>
&gt;dieseases)<br/>
