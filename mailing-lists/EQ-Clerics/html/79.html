<div id="ygrps-yiv-1252731858">If you have recieved this message multiple times, I apologise, but it was <br/>
necessary to reach everyone possible.<br/>
<br/>
  I am writing today to try to correct an injustice that has been in <br/>
existance from the date of release. Many may feel that this issue is small <br/>
compared to many of the other problems with the game at this point. However, <br/>
I feel that I am missing a large piece of the game because it appears as <br/>
though I am not allowed to fletch.<br/>
<br/>
  From all that I have heard and seen, there are only two places to buy the <br/>
necessary components for making arrows: Kelethin and Surefall Glade. As an <br/>
evil character (Dark Elf, Troll, Ogre) it is near impossible to get these <br/>
items, and even more difficult to get them in quantities which make the <br/>
trade skill worth practicing.<br/>
<br/>
  Part of the irony in thi situation is that there IS an Ogre in the <br/>
Feerrott which sells Bowyering components, but any fletcher will tell you <br/>
that you need to increase your skills with arrows before making bows.<br/>
<br/>
  In order to help resolve this situation, I wish to show the EQ Developers <br/>
that the players do have a voice. I propose a 3 step plan for you to help <br/>
solve this problem.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1. In game, /feedback, and state that you would like to see a Merchant who <br/>
sells arrow components in a conspicuous place in Neriak, Grobb, or Oggok<br/>
<br/>
2. Go to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://24.0.101.19/eq/">http://24.0.101.19/eq/</a> and sign the petition that has been put up. <br/>
All that it asks for is a character name, race, class, and server. This list <br/>
will be sent straight to the EQ Developers as extra firepower for the cause.<br/>
<br/>
3. Tell all the EQ gamers that you know to follow steps 1 and 2.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In order for this to work, we need everyone&#39;s support, not just those of the <br/>
darker affiliation. No matter what race or class your characters are, please <br/>
participate to show that we can make a difference.<br/>
