<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;This was mentioned on one of the cleric mailing lists.  Could someone repost <br/>
&gt;what the name was, and what dragon it drops from?  Also, would it be a <br/>
&gt;reasonable trade for a Reed Belt?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The Triad (Composed of 3 guilds:  Knights of Eternal Good (KEG), Emaf&#39;Aitch<br/>
(MFH), and Clan Icewind (CIW) on the Rathe server has been slaying both<br/>
dragons, Vox and Nagefen, on a consistent basis.  Originally, Vox has been<br/>
the only dragon that drops a White Dragon Tooth, which had the effect of<br/>
summoning a level 49 necromancer pet.  She dropped this item pretty often<br/>
it seemed, at least 1 tooth every two kills, sometimes 2 teeth on one body.<br/>
 However, after slaying Lord Nagafen roughly 10 times, Lord Nagafen now<br/>
drops a Red Dragon tooth as well (Many peeps, including me, believe this is<br/>
a new item drop for Nagafen, that was recently introduced).  Many of us are<br/>
holding onto these items for now, in case they are needed for some sort of<br/>
&quot;super&quot; quest (Hmmm...  could these be needed for the fabled Fiery Avenger<br/>
quest they are revamping?).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not much of a trader, so I couldn&#39;t comment on what a reasonable trade<br/>
for the Reed Belt would be.  <br/>
