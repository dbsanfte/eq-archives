<div id="ygrps-yiv-1221729740">I would have to say, why would you want to melee?  Even after 35.  We are<br/>
NOT the greatest fighters....but the spells we have can help us to make blue<br/>
mobs lives a living hell, especially with raising wisdom....beleive it or<br/>
not, until I got my wis higher and ac tweaked just a smidge, I couldnt fight<br/>
for crap!  I&#39;d die to lots of crap at 21.  And finally after getting a lil<br/>
more wis, and that ac up there....I&#39;m kicking ass!  (146 wisdom as a human<br/>
cleric (base 95) and i still have chances for MORE wis :))<br/>

I have the opportunity to buy items off Ebay that would give me<br/>
outstanding stats as far as strength, agility and dexterity go. I&#39;m<br/>
talking 115 str, 130 dex and 125 agi (and 85 sta), all wearable at the<br/>
same time. However, my wisdom would be only 105. <br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, I also have the opportunity to buy wisdom items that<br/>
would increase my wisdom by 35 points (to about 136). Which path should<br/>
I follow? Some people argue that high level clerics CAN melee, while<br/>
others argue that at high levels, clerics should concentrate on their<br/>
healing and buffing skills. &quot;After all, if you wanted to be a warrior,<br/>
you should have been one.&quot; Yeah, yeah, heard that, been there. With the<br/>
right equipment, though (Jboots, a flowing black sash of haste, an<br/>
observer&#39;s staff, etc.), a cleric should be able to hold his or her own<br/>
in combat, even after level 35. <br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions, comments, advice before I commit to one group of items<br/>
or the other?<br/>
