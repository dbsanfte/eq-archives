<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-714038979">I am proud to announce that the Cleric Sit-In will take place on December 3, 1999 at 6PM PST (9PM EST) on Fennin Ro in the city of Freeport. Our purpose is to show Verant that a great number of Clerics and their friends are dissatisfied with the current state of the Cleric-only armor quests that were meant to replace Rubicite. The Cleric-only armor presently has two flaws that we would like to see corrected. One, the quests themselves take a ridiculously long amount of time to complete (days or weeks for just one piece), and two, the armor class (AC) of the Cleric-only armor is not on par with classes of its type (The new Cleric-only armor&#39;s AC is actually *lower* than the original Rubicite). To receive more information about these concerns and to find out how you can show your support, please visit <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://freepages.ugo.com/clericsrequest.">http://freepages.ugo.com/clericsrequest.</a> And to those of you who already plan on participating in this event please check the information page, as several updates have been made. I look forward to seeing everyone there, and in all hopes we can get Verant to listen to our suggestions. Thank you all for your support.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
