<b>Subject:</b> Using Trade window against KSers. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-117220868">Believe it or not, but, repeatedly opening a trade window on someone to<br/>
interrupt their play is a bannable offense.   Kill<br/>
Stealing, in and of itself is *NOT* bannable. <br/>
<br/>
If you find a KSer that doesnt have his trade options turned off, and you<br/>
do this sort of thing,  YOU will be the one banned, not the kser.<br/>
