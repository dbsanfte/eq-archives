<div id="ygrps-yiv-1694170552">I routinely give away free pieces of ring/bronze armor and some weapons, but<br/>
if someone begs from me, they get ignored permanently.  I cannot STAND<br/>
having someone I do not know feel they have the right to beg off of me<br/>
simply because I am a higher level than them.  I *EARNED* all of my<br/>
equipment and money and they can do the same.<br/>

&gt; Hi all.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I gave seen this debate before in other places.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What do you all think of begging as a method of acquiring<br/>
&gt; cash/armour/weapons?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t mean the skill of begging, but I mean approaching other PC&#39;s and<br/>
&gt; asking them to spare a bit?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now, I am for it.  I beleive that RP&#39;ing worlds parallel the real<br/>
&gt; world, and<br/>
&gt; inthe real world, there are those who are poor, and need to beg for thier<br/>
&gt; sustenance.  At the lower levels, I gained most of my armour and my money<br/>
&gt; from begging.  Now I do it in a RP&#39;ing context, and not as &#39;Hey, got any<br/>
&gt; free armour I can have?&#39;.  I think that this is a valid strategy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As well, now that I am entering the teens, I don&#39;t need to beg as often.<br/>
&gt; But I do barter with players, and when doing so, I subtly make<br/>
&gt; them beleive<br/>
&gt; that I am a poor cleric (which I really am). In doing so, I have made some<br/>
&gt; great deals, and am able to get some good bargains on armour.  Last nite,<br/>
&gt; for instance, I bought a bloodforge hammer for 15 pp, and a FS<br/>
&gt; staff.  From<br/>
&gt; what I could see, they usually went for around 30 pp.  In my opionion, its<br/>
&gt; no different than trading in ussed car and dressing down and making the<br/>
&gt; saleperson beleive you are poorer than you really are.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Any other thoughts? </span></blockquote></div>
