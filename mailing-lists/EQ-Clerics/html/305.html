<div id="ygrps-yiv-809215304">yeah...med bronze....i&#39;ve yet to see where to get some, but i know you can in<br/>
najena &lt;i believe&gt; and i&#39;ve heard perma since the patch......but those are<br/>
higher lv dungeons and really makes no sense because by the time you can get med<br/>
bronze, you&#39;re high enough to get better...like rubi or wis adding<br/>
stuff.....really weird....<br/>

&gt; It is *very* easy to have full bronze by 18 or before! Just go to Unrest and<br/>
&gt; buy all the bronze off of the over-weight people in there.  It sells for<br/>
&gt; cheap. Of course, that only works for us stouts.  If you want medium bronze,<br/>
&gt; good luck.<br/>
