<div id="ygrps-yiv-1533643154">I am not sure about what level to solo them at, ( i forget Quite frankly) I<br/>
did a lot of soloing there myself, but they(verant) changed a few things<br/>
there which prevented me from soloing them anymore.<br/>
  They made the Spectres &quot;cry for help&quot; range larger, they also changed<br/>
their pathing.  Many spectres would get stuck on walls trying to come out of<br/>
the Cave, Verant made it so if they get stuck they teleport to your /loc.  I<br/>
stopped soloing the Spectres the day that I pulled one, was fighting a great<br/>
battle, then magically I had Three land on my head.<br/>
Perhaps you can solo the one outside without stirring the rest of them up,<br/>
Sorry I didn&#39;t really answer your questin, i don&#39;t remember what level.  I<br/>
just thought I would make this info known incase you were not aware.<br/>

&gt;Feerrott? I am level 34 now and just got Expel undead.<br/>
