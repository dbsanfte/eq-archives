<div id="ygrps-yiv-1282165299">Ya know we said the same thing....If we could move our entire guild over to<br/>
test we would, but that is just impossible.....there are only 3 of us on<br/>
test at this time. we have me the cleric, our paladin is a monk and our<br/>
ranger is a bard.   If ya feel like making a character there you are welcome<br/>
to hunt along with us, we all started out in freeport.  they are lvl 5 and<br/>
i&#39;m lvl  4, we are hunting right near the zone point in befallen and we were<br/>
the only people there last night, the XP was great )<br/>
<br/>
I was so happy I made patchwork pants for myself )))<br/>
Funny the things you get enjoyment out of again<br/>

&gt; Bree, I think that is wonderful.  I tried creating new characters on other<br/>
&gt; servers but what I found was that while I didn&#39;t miss the &quot;twinking&quot; I did<br/>
&gt; with my other babies on The Rathe, what I DID miss were my friends and my<br/>
&gt; guild and all the things we did together.  (Can&#39;t live without green<br/>
spam!!)<br/>
&gt; So for me, going to another server isn&#39;t really an option right now.  It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; really the people that keep me coming back to EQ, not just the game.  If I<br/>
&gt; could bundle them all up and take them to Test, I would, but<br/>
unfortunately,<br/>
&gt; it isn&#39;t gonna happen.<br/>

&gt; &gt; My Friends and I are burned out quite a bit on Fennin Ro, way too<br/>
crowded,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and the Planes are near to impossible half the time.  Well, we decided<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; &gt; take a break and I am having a blast.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; We created characters on the test server. No Spam, No crowding, and no<br/>
&gt; &gt; problems so far about finding stuff to hunt. We are still very young yet<br/>
&gt; &gt; though and it is fun having to work for all our stuff again.  On Fennin<br/>
We<br/>
&gt; &gt; could create newbie and give them things, but on test we can&#39;t &quot;twink&quot;<br/>
so<br/>
&gt; it<br/>
&gt; &gt; feels just like it did when I started out on March 18th.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I made a cleric again, while my friends made classes that are different<br/>
&gt; form<br/>
&gt; &gt; what their high levels on Fennin are.  My thought are I have always<br/>
liked<br/>
&gt; &gt; playign the cleric and well if we are gonna go anywhere on Test, you<br/>
have<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; have a cleric so I am happy to repeat.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Just thought I would share that with everyone, I am having a blast once<br/>
&gt; &gt; again =)<br/>
