&gt;you can get to PoF and get the Mist Armor.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not too sure I agree with this.  With the options of storebought Steel,<br/>
Rubicite and Mithril, you can come up with a very nice looking outfit for<br/>
travelling and social occasions.  Although I&#39;d like to obtain Mist Armor<br/>
myself, it&#39;s just not feasible at this time.  However, you can be as vain<br/>
(I&#39;m very aware of how my character appears), as any other class.<br/>

&gt;Then you will look like a newbie.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Absolutely, during times of battle you will look like a nightmarish<br/>
hodgepodge.  However, outside of battle you can still wear your travelling<br/>
clothes.  I normally carry my mithril breastplate, as well as the rest of<br/>
my outfit with me, so that when I&#39;m not fighting, I don&#39;t look a mess.  =)<br/>
