<b>Subject:</b> Re: Faction in Rivervale <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-348419552">When I first came to Rivervale (as a high elf), I was dubious to<br/>
everyone.  I spent a stupid amount of time killing the pirahna in the<br/>
lake, and giving the teeth to Fiddy Bobick.  As it turns out, it&#39;s a<br/>
really good quest, that gives quite a bit of loot, for as easy as it<br/>
is.  You might try this one.<br/>
  Although, now that I think of it, I don&#39;t know if this quest affects<br/>
the R&#39;vale clerics or not.  What faction is that?<br/>
  Also, I wouldn&#39;t be too concerned about buying spells there.  As a<br/>
high elf, I can get my spells cheaper in Felwithe anyway.  I just got<br/>
to level 19, and needed to buy spells, and Qeynos and Rivervale were<br/>
the highest.  Freeport had decent prices, and Felwithe is usually the<br/>
lowest, although it matches Freeport on many of them.<br/>

&gt;Subject: [EQ-Clerics] Faction in Rivervale<br/>
&gt;Date: Mon, 18 Oct 1999 13:34:03 -0400<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hi all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am a halfling cleric of Rivervale, and have lost faction in my town with<br/>
&gt;the merchants.  This was caused by fighting with Mangler.  I killed him 3 <br/>
&gt;or<br/>
&gt;4 times as a young halfling, because he atacked me.  The 5th time I did it,<br/>
&gt;I lost enough faction to con dubious, and hence, lose buying and selling<br/>
&gt;privileges.  I was able to regain my faction by handing in 24 RE warbeads <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;the sheriff. That was level 9.  However, at level 11, I was again attacked<br/>
&gt;by him, but he was killed by someone else. No matter, my faction bit the<br/>
&gt;dust again.  Now, at level 13, almost 14, I have handed in 96 warbeads, and<br/>
&gt;still con dubious to the merchants, and still can&#39;t buy nor sell (other <br/>
&gt;than<br/>
&gt;to the druids).  My questions are this:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1) How many RE warbeads do I need to hand in?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;2) As I get higher in level, is it more required of me to regain faction?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The only reason this really matters is because I can&#39;t buy my spells from<br/>
&gt;the cleric guild any more.  Otherwise, I wouldn&#39;t give a hoot.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;It&#39;s actually an exact 7 hour spawn.  I spent the 7 hours there from the<br/>
&gt;previous time he was killed (I managed to get there right when it <br/>
&gt;happened).<br/>
&gt;I teamed up with a lv 30 shadowknight who wanted the other piece of paper<br/>
&gt;(not the page, some note) from Dyllin Starshine.  He managed to hit<br/>
&gt;Starshine with one spell and was instantly down for the count.  At very<br/>
&gt;least I&#39;d have somebody with you who can cast see invis, so you can tell if<br/>
&gt;some wizard or druid is going to come in & KS, you can at least let &#39;em <br/>
&gt;know<br/>
&gt;that you know they&#39;re there (cast cancel magic on &#39;em repeatedly, see how<br/>
&gt;aggravated they get with ya  ^_^ ).<br/>

&gt; &gt; I have heard that he is a 6-hour spawn.  He spawns in the open area<br/>
&gt; &gt; near the smugglers, in a little tent-thingy against the wall.<br/>
