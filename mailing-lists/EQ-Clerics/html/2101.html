<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-479149095">Hello All!  This is my first post to this forum.  I have been reading emails<br/>
on this list for some time now, and I have found much valuable information<br/>
here.  My thanks to all for my increased knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
I am trying to complete the cleric armor quest for the greaves.  I already<br/>
have the ingot, but I need to find the icon.  The quest info I have<br/>
indicates that I must kill the erudite Maugrim who spawns in Kerra Ridge on<br/>
the necro isle.  I have been there and I have not found Maugrim.  Does<br/>
anyone have more details as to where Maugrim spawns, or how to get it to<br/>
spawn?  I would greatly appreciate any information you may have.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!<br/>
