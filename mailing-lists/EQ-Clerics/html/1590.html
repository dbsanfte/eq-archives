What I hate is how hard it is to target NPCs when there are so many<br/>
frikkin corpses lying around. Very frustrating, especially as I&#39;m in<br/>
Blackburrow now. Last night, there were more corpses in Blackburrow than<br/>
there were players :) (16 players total, 27 corpses that I could count.)</div>
