<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1996707512">I hate people who beg almost as much as people who train me, worse than people<br/>
using ooc or shout for stuff that should be done in say.  Once had a guy that<br/>
was using auction to give his group battle commands- that pissed me off.  That&#39;s<br/>
what the /ignore is good for.<br/>
<br/>
ABSOLUTE worst thing is people begging for money or items.  I give away free<br/>
heals and buffs, but for a level 8 to ask if they can have my BE Mace, that cool<br/>
cloak, or that thing on my head really pisses me off.  Now I&#39;m really getting<br/>
going so &lt;RANT ON&gt;  The res requests are starting to really piss me off.  I do a<br/>
few for some lower level characters in Mistmoore, next thing I know there are 17<br/>
people asking me to res their body 2 and 3 times.   I don&#39;t mind sitting and<br/>
medding for an hour or two to clean up Guk or Sol B, but mid level peeps asking<br/>
me repeatedly (every 2 to 3 minutes) while I&#39;m deep in the castle sucks.<br/>
Sometimes I miss messages from my party because the text screams by.  All these<br/>
peeps are like level 20 to 27.  Next time my response is going to be &quot;You take<br/>
the risks being here, so either get used to dying or get outta this zone&quot;<br/>
/ignore xxx.<br/>
&lt;RANT OFF&gt;<br/>
<br/>
PC begging really sucks, just like it sucks in RL.  A couple years ago an<br/>
article was written in the LA area about the street beggars who make $80K to<br/>
$120K a year.  This just pissed me off.  Here I go to college, get good grades,<br/>
work my tail off and make less than someone who doesn&#39;t take a shower, doesn&#39;t<br/>
brush their teeth and doesn&#39;t wash their clothes for weeks at a time?  Made me<br/>
sick.  If I played on a PvP server (especially one without the +/- 6 level rule<br/>
like Rallos) begging would be an instant death penalty for anyone that did it to<br/>
me.  I would actually hope that their bind point was right in front of me so I<br/>
could keep killing them for awhile.  I like making statements.<br/>
<br/>
Yes!  I have very strong opinions!</div>
