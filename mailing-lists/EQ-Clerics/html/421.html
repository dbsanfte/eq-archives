<div id="ygrps-yiv-681430865">Ok thanks, I&#39;m now on Lvl 17 it didn&#39;t take me half as long as I thought it<br/>
take to go from 16 to 17.  Me and a friend group in Kerra Isle and killed a<br/>
lot of Clawknights till we hit Lvl 17.  After that we made our way to<br/>
Highpass and grouped for other guild members then we got tired of the kill<br/>
stealers and everyone jumping at everything that respawned that we moved to<br/>
Beholder.  Then we decided to give it a go in Runnyeye, big mistake.  It was<br/>
too bad at first and no one got killed but the things were tearing us up.<br/>
It got close to the time for Cerfnet to go down so you broke up the group<br/>
and logged off.<br/>
