<div id="ygrps-yiv-1414280697">Well if you think that was bad listen to this.  Yesterday i decided to take<br/>
a mental health day from work.  I wake up and the first thing I do is go on<br/>
EQ.  I logged in and I was at cazic.  So I yelled Level 31 cleric looking to<br/>
group.  So i get into a group to take on Archon.  It was me,  2 SK&#39;s 2<br/>
wizards and a ranger and druid.  So we decided We would invis and go up all<br/>
the way to archon.  Well everyone in the group can invis themselves and I<br/>
start screaming for a invis.  Noone comes down until they start fighting in<br/>
Archon.  Then somebody realizes oh we forgot to invis the cleric.  Well POOF<br/>
a train comes like 5 lizzy I go invun.  Getting stuned.  Used 2nd<br/>
invunerbilty.  Well MORE STUNS.  Ok I try to gate out.  Your spell has been<br/>
interupted.5x  Well I die.  Get to my corpse everyone said sorry.  Well you<br/>
think thats the end but there is more!!!!  Now i lost a level because any<br/>
level after hell level you lose a whole bub of exp.  So now I am level 30.<br/>
Ok we all go to Archon room there are about 5 to 7 lizzy.  My invisibilty<br/>
fades. I START SCREAMING I NEED INVIS.  But noone there invis me.  Well that<br/>
nice little jucidor and his 3 brothers tried to cast wrath on me also the<br/>
crudader used his harm touch on me as well/  Hehehehe Used a invunerbily<br/>
before he gets the spell off.  So the wizzy says I AM GOING TO USE EVAC.<br/>
Well he gets the spell off while we were winning the fight and boom we are<br/>
in North Karana.  We rest up and everyone invis themselves BUT ME.  The<br/>
wizard gates to the wizard portal in Cazic with me with NO INVIS.  Well if<br/>
anyone has ever been there,  there are always at least 3 lizzy hanging<br/>
around there.  Well I used my last invunerbilty then tried to gate.  The<br/>
first gate was interupted down to 80%.  2nd gate intterupted 60% 3rd gate<br/>
interupted 30% 4th gate interupted 20%  5th gate worked with 19HP.  I said<br/>
to the group I am leaving since you have no clue how important the cleric<br/>
is.  I left and decided I was going to go to Rathe mountains. Well Mr. Hurd<br/>
showed me what a real ass whoopin is.  Died lost level 31 again.  Back to<br/>
30. Played all last night still havent gotten that level back. The moral of<br/>
the story. HELL LEVEL SUCKS.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hi all,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The following is just a rant. Nothing of substance, just me venting about<br/>
&gt; last nites gameplay.  If you don&#39;t want to read it, feel free to skip.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Rant.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well, last nite was just one of those bad group experiences.  I have<br/>
&gt; recently decided to setup home in Unrest.  Granted, its a dangerous place<br/>
&gt; for a lvl 16 cleric, but I consider myself a decent enough playe, one who,<br/>
&gt; in the words of Kenny Rogers, &#39;..knows when to hold, knows when to fold<br/>
&gt; em,<br/>
&gt; knows when to walk away, knows when to run...&#39;.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So I start last nite, and within ten minutes have a full group going.<br/>
&gt; Thats<br/>
&gt; what I love about Unrest, its so easy to get a group going.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyways, we have 2 bards, an enchanter, a pally, and 2 clerics.  So we<br/>
&gt; start.  I am nominated as the puller, which i don&#39;t like, but what the<br/>
&gt; heck.<br/>
&gt; So i pull the first few mobs.  Each time, we kill something, I immediately<br/>
&gt; here the &#39;ching-ching&#39; sound (looting) and see i receive a split of the<br/>
&gt; money.  Of course, this is happening during the fighting, as opposed to<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; end.  So i mention that it would probably be wiser to wait till the fight<br/>
&gt; was over before looting, as the mobs in unrest are unruly, and any break<br/>
&gt; in<br/>
&gt; the fighting could cost us our lives.  Plus, it would be nice to get a<br/>
&gt; fair<br/>
&gt; share of the looting rights.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So we pull more, and of course, more looting during fighting occurs.  This<br/>
&gt; time I am more adament about the looting.  I amthen told by our lowest<br/>
&gt; level<br/>
&gt; bard that she wants free for all looting.  I usually would agree that free<br/>
&gt; for all is ok, but I told her that it wouldn&#39;t be fair if only one person<br/>
&gt; got all the fine steel and bronze.  So we conclude that we will ffa the<br/>
&gt; money, and alpha the bronze and FS.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Next pull, we get a nasty train.  We stay to fight, and we are doing ok,<br/>
&gt; until the clerics run out of mana. fortunately, we had killed a few, so we<br/>
&gt; got some good xp.  But the healing is about to end (oom) and we (the<br/>
&gt; clerics) yell RUN-ZONE.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Of course no one listens, they keep fighting, the clerics make it out, two<br/>
&gt; of the group die, and the others limp out with a bubble each.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We get blasted by the group... Why didn&#39;t you heal, you should have had<br/>
&gt; your<br/>
&gt; act together...  Well, we explain that the we can only heal for as much<br/>
&gt; mana<br/>
&gt; as we have, and when the clerics say run, its run time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So we regroup, and go back in.  Another train, this time the enchanter<br/>
&gt; decides he&#39;ll play tank when he goes OOM. We tell him to back off, but no,<br/>
&gt; he stays and fights, causing the clerics to wast mana on him for heals.<br/>
&gt; He<br/>
&gt; died, and of course, blames us.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Wash, rinse repeat.  More stupid group moves, more dying.  It ranged from<br/>
&gt; looting probs to players taking off to &#39;explore&#39; then dying.  And, we had<br/>
&gt; the people who were higher in level leave our group (we were abel to<br/>
&gt; replace, but anyone with a brain didn&#39;t stay in the group long).  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In the end, I died once, but it was enough to wipe my Xp for the night,<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; I made a total of 3 gold ( i usually make 10pp).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I guess the conclusion is this: Some players think clerics are a<br/>
&gt; bottomless<br/>
&gt; pit of mana/healing, and any death in a group is always the result of the<br/>
&gt; cleric not healing properly/fast enough.  My philosophy is tanks first,<br/>
&gt; everyone else next, me last. I&#39;ll tell you this, I now know who not to<br/>
&gt; group<br/>
&gt; with in Unrest, or anywhere else for that matter.<br/>
