<div id="ygrps-yiv-750954192">Okay the sentries is on an Isalnd with gargoyles and specteres on it<br/>
dont worry spectetres ar3 part of her duty (ill explain it in a minute) from<br/>
the sister dock go straight out to the goblin island you will come to the<br/>
Oracle if you face his directionj teh follow the shore to your left adn keep<br/>
an eye on your right youll see an island come to view shes on this one swim<br/>
straight out and when you get on the island she spawns to the right of where<br/>
you first hit shore. What happens when she spawns go     shell sit there for<br/>
about a minute andf then go and confront the 4 specteres in the middle of<br/>
the island and of course she dies now whether or not the potion will keep<br/>
her alive im not sure on Povar she has not spawned since i have been there<br/>
but about 2 times and i have been on that island for about 3 weeks i think<br/>

&gt;Hi all.  I don&#39;t want to be spoiled, just nudged =)  The very first cleric<br/>
&gt;quest where it is my duty to refresh the sentries of the Temple of Marr<br/>
&gt;still haunts me.  I went to the ocean of tears to search for the remaining<br/>
&gt;sentry and retreated as I saw the island FULL of goblins.  I am not a bit<br/>
&gt;higher in level and decided to complete this quest.  Is she out there? or<br/>
 </span></blockquote>is<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;the quest broken?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;btw: Sailing in the OOT, I went West (as I recall) and seemed to be headed<br/>
&gt;toward Kaladim, am I recalling wrong, or is something messed up besides me?<br/>
