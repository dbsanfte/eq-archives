<div id="ygrps-yiv-1454200423">The peacekeeper battlestaff is a low level quest for erudite clerics of quellios.  Talk to a cleric in the temple of light(in the building, not on the ledge). I have no idea what the stats (if any, it may be just a quest item) of this staff are, as i have only found one pearl of odus.<br/>
