<b>Subject:</b> Re: fear plane <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-35189766">On a newsgroup someone was saying how buggy Plane of Fear really is, a few<br/>
things people said it was suppose to be like that, like a spell that&#39;ll hit<br/>
you for like 1,000 dmg.  But this guy was saying a Lvl 1 Orge could go in<br/>
there and get by all these tough baddies and cause some major trains.  For<br/>
one I&#39;d like to know how a low lvl anything can get even close to this<br/>
place, luck?  But someone replied to the post and said it was true a low lvl<br/>
player could do that.<br/>
I&#39;d love to see this place at least once, seen screen shots but pics are<br/>
nothing I want to see the real deal.<br/>
Also heard the lag for this place (I take it is bad) was as bad as<br/>
Lavastorm.  Since I haven&#39;t been to Lavastorm yet I wouldn&#39;t know, but if<br/>
it&#39;s as bad as Unrest the lag will have to suck.<br/>
