<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1441431010">I haven&#39;t picked up a trade skill yet.  I am debating between baking and<br/>
smithing.  Tailoring seems too boring.  Though I am only at lvl 11, so I am<br/>
still scrimping and saving for those spells/armour combos.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
One way I have been able to come by money really has to do with &#39;geography&#39;.<br/>
Being a halfling in Rivervale, I have met many higher level characters.<br/>
Rivervale seems to be a crossroads.  So there are always many people there<br/>
to sell loot to, to beg from, and to generally get good buffs from.<br/>
<br/>
In contrary, I played a DE cleric in neriak, and barely ever had enough<br/>
money to buy food.  As well, I&#39;ve played a human cleric in Qeynos, with much<br/>
the same results.<br/>

Noted, good idea. But it&#39;s still the case that on the older servers, people<br/>
are skipping straight to bronze, or receiving very underpriced banded from<br/>
higher-level friends who don&#39;t need it, or whatever. The market for banded<br/>
is getting younger and younger, and hence people expect banded for cheaper<br/>
and cheaper just because they don&#39;t have that kind of money to spend.<br/>
Also, of the friends that I group with regularly, only 1 can wear banded who<br/>
hasn&#39;t already got it :-(<br/>
<br/>
But let&#39;s not go too far into a smithing discussion...<br/>
<br/>
A question:<br/>
Despite clerics traditionally being a poor class, I suspect that many<br/>
clerics do one or more trade skills... Anyone? My favourite is baking<br/>
because you can cook on the move.<br/>

&gt; Actually I&#39;m quite serious.  If ye need to armor 3 or 4 <br/>
&gt; players, and they<br/>
&gt; are willing to pay for the base costs of the materials, you <br/>
&gt; could easily<br/>
&gt; gain enough skill to make banded reliably.  I estimate it would take<br/>
&gt; roughly 250 to 300 platinum pieces to bring smithing up to the level<br/>
&gt; necessary to create Banded.  With 3 or 4 people, that comes <br/>
&gt; out to 75 to<br/>
&gt; 100pp each for banded.<br/>
