<div id="ygrps-yiv-364302694">It _is_ possible to quite effectively fight (as a caster) while blind. You<br/>
just need to use hotkeys for everything. Spells on the hotkey panel, F2-F6<br/>
to target party members (you did write down the order, right?), assist on a<br/>
hotkey (to nuke the mob your tank is fighting, say), and if you&#39;re soloing<br/>
or dueling, use tab to toggle between your target and you if you need to<br/>
heal yourself. The main thing is to keep your head, not fumble the keys, and<br/>
use the HP/Mana bar information you could see up until the point you were<br/>
blinded.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re fighting something that blinds, e.g. an evil eye, it&#39;s funny to<br/>
regain your sight and see dead mobs at your feet _and_ your party healed<br/>
:-). Like, what happened folks?<br/>
<br/>
I just keep heal on a hotkey, but I would certainly put more spells on<br/>
hotkeys if I were going into a duel. Having said that, you&#39;re right, I&#39;d<br/>
imagine Flash of Light is a good spell to use on an unprepared opponent<br/>
(I&#39;ve never duelled).<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think Flash of Light would yield better results. It lasts <br/>
&gt; much longer<br/>
&gt; (12-18 seconds, I think), and he cannot cast while blinded. <br/>
&gt; If you want<br/>
&gt; to confuse your opponent even more, cast Fear on him after you&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; blinded him. He&#39;ll never know what hit him.<br/>
