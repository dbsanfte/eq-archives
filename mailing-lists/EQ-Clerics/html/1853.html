<div id="ygrps-yiv-738034984">Rodcet Nife is great. There have been times when my<br/>
level 20 cleric would have to put on her roleplay tag<br/>
just to avoid all the random and constant tells about<br/>
joining a group. Of course, that doesn&#39;t include all<br/>
the people that have added me to their friends lists. <br/>
Of course, I join random groups fairly often, and when<br/>
I leave I say something like if you need a cleric in<br/>
the future, look me up. :)<br/>
Its pretty hard being that wanted. <br/>

&gt; &gt; Hi all.  I&#39;d like to give props out to you all,<br/>
&gt; and everyone on the<br/>
&gt; &gt; eq-cleric forum at stratic. (if any of you do both<br/>
&gt; of these)<br/>
&gt; &gt; So far that forum and this list is easily, from<br/>
&gt; what i&#39;ve seen, most of<br/>
&gt; &gt; the maturist ppl in this game..mind you, there are<br/>
&gt; always exceptions.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Well anyways, I&#39;ve run into real life head on, and<br/>
&gt; basically my playing<br/>
&gt; &gt; time has become very short, to almost non<br/>
&gt; existant.. :(<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;m currently lvl 20, and am finding myself<br/>
&gt; getting somewhat<br/>
&gt; &gt; frustrated.  I have a few wizards in the group of<br/>
&gt; ppl that I play with<br/>
&gt; &gt; (all higher lvl though) and I am able to<br/>
&gt; occasinoally go to multiple<br/>
&gt; &gt; zones.  I&#39;m having an extremely tough time finding<br/>
&gt; a group.  Now, I know<br/>
&gt; &gt; my name has not been tarnished, unless it&#39;s been<br/>
&gt; by an adolescent, so I<br/>
&gt; &gt; rule that case out.  My friends say this is a<br/>
&gt; tough time for a cleric to<br/>
&gt; &gt; find groups because our heal spell isn&#39;t that<br/>
&gt; effective (which I<br/>
&gt; &gt; agree).  But, being the poor melee&#39;ers we are, I<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t solo (one<br/>
&gt; &gt; exception..If I can do 2 things..1) find undead<br/>
&gt; available to kill 2)<br/>
&gt; &gt; root holds).<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve been to unrest, lake rathe, oasis, bird citie<br/>
&gt; (south karana? or<br/>
&gt; &gt; north..can&#39;t remember), perma, and basically I<br/>
&gt; never get tells back from<br/>
&gt; &gt; anyone.  Now one thing I&#39;ve noticed is that the<br/>
&gt; number of clerics has<br/>
&gt; &gt; risen, and groups will often tell me, &#39;sorry, we<br/>
&gt; already have a<br/>
&gt; &gt; cleric&#39;.  And I&#39;m not sure why they wouldn&#39;t want<br/>
&gt; another one! Oh well,<br/>
&gt; &gt; I throw that away assuming they are playing their<br/>
&gt; first character.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Anyways, I was basically just looking for a place<br/>
&gt; to hunt and that I can<br/>
&gt; &gt; easily get a group.  It sucks when you might have<br/>
&gt; 2 hours to play a<br/>
&gt; &gt; week, and you spend 1 hour advertising for a<br/>
&gt; group...<br/>
&gt; &gt; Or is it possibly I&#39;m going to have to do my best<br/>
&gt; to find a place to<br/>
&gt; &gt; solo undead for 4 levels?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Any and all help would be appreciated.<br/>
&gt; &gt; TIA<br/>
