<div id="ygrps-yiv-1617471377"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
&gt; Do you think that Verant would notice 10 people sitting in on each server,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>or 150 people sitting in on one server?   I&#39;m not arguing your point, just<br/>
askin the question.   I think that you may very well get more notice by<br/>
doing it all on one server, if in fact you could get a huge turn out.  If<br/>
you did it on all servers you would just spread it out more and get smaller<br/>
turnouts on all servers instead of a huge showing on one.<br/>
    -The event is on just one server: Fennin Ro.  I don&#39;t know who started<br/>
this idea of mulitple servers, but please check the official web page for<br/>
all information.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://freepages.ugo.com/clericsrequest/">http://freepages.ugo.com/clericsrequest/</a><br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; On a side note,  I think the point is moot... I think the powers that be<br/>
 </span></blockquote>have determined that that armor is all good and I don&#39;t believe they will be<br/>
changing anything, even if we get 2000 clerics to sit in at freeport.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    - Again, I realize there are those who believe that we our reaching for<br/>
our goals in vain, but it can never be said that we did not try.  In fact,<br/>
it is my firm belief that never trying is worse than failure.</div>
