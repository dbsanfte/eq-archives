<b>Subject:</b> Deepwater Harpoon -- Does anybody have one? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1074752910">I was just wondering if anybody has done the Deepwater Harpoon quest. I<br/>
think it would be really cool to go /anon and pretend to be a Paladin<br/>
(especially for me &#39;cause I&#39;m a DE ;)) I heard that if a cleric swings it it<br/>
only does like 1 point of damage, but I just want it for the looks (and hey,<br/>
+5 WIS ain&#39;t bad) I am on a Paladin email list and they have pretty much<br/>
summed up how to get it, I would just like any first-hand experience from<br/>
the Clerics out there that might have one. Thanks...<br/>
