<div id="ygrps-yiv-1512337487">I keep an ongoing wishlist, and I revise it occasionally if I get an<br/>
item, or if I get high enough level to obtain something that I<br/>
previously couldn&#39;t.  I just made 24, and I thought I would add a few<br/>
of the cleric quest armor pieces to the list.  I didn&#39;t add all of<br/>
them, but I added a few that are better than what I currently have.  I<br/>
didn&#39;t add the chestplate since I don&#39;t want to camp Bilge, and I want<br/>
a BS tunic, anyway.  I didn&#39;t add the legs since I would rather have<br/>
gatorscale legs, and I didn&#39;t add the shield (who would?).  The rest<br/>
seemed decent enough.  Now then, I have a few questions,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying for the boots, gauntlets, arms bracers, and the caduceus..<br/>
For those that have done these quests, are they obtainable by a 24th<br/>
level cleric (i.e., me)?  Specifically, the boots (stumpwatch,<br/>
cabinwatch shouldn&#39;t be hard), don&#39;t know about the rest. Possible?<br/>
What level is Babbinsbort?  What level is Gull?  And how do you get<br/>
to him?<br/>
Looks like the bracers require killing some mid 30s ghoul, so I will<br/>
wait on these.<br/>
What level is the greater darkbone skeleton in Rathe mountains?<br/>
<br/>
How do I make galvanized, magnetized, and vulcanized platinum bars?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any info,<br/>
