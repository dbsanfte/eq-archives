<div id="ygrps-yiv-436079215">Heres something else....<br/>
<br/>
We were in South Karana fighting birdies...my group was fighting, and a <br/>
wizard comes along trying to steal the kill. How to deal with that? We all <br/>
took off auto attack, and let the bird attack her when she tried to kill <br/>
steal. She didn&#39;t last long &lt;snickers&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Another thing I&#39;ve done, playing my Magician, I would click on a spell, make <br/>
it look like I&#39;m casting, and the KSer would attack the bird...not knowing <br/>
that we never attacked it. Since birds are only aggressive if attacked, we <br/>
watched this KSer get pummeled to the ground. Needless to say, she left <br/>
after that =)<br/>
<br/>
haha!<br/>

Ok, so then 6, kill-stealing Wizards can group together and do over 1,000<br/>
point of damage in a matter of seconds? It is better the way it is. Just<br/>
remember to train Dvinn to those kill stealers and you&#39;ll be alright ;)<br/>

 &gt; Please forgive, for I am new to this list, but here is my problem and<br/>
 &gt; suggestion for Verant:<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; My number one problem with the game is kill stealing. This frustrates me<br/>
 &gt; to<br/>
 &gt; no end.  I can&#39;t begin to tell you how long I have been trying for a <br/>

 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; I think the problem is how Verant determines who gets the kill. As I<br/>
 &gt; understand it, the single person that inflicts the most damage is awarded<br/>
 &gt; the kill.  This means that it does not matter if you are grouped and your<br/>
 &gt; group does more damage than the spell caster.  Does this seem crazy to<br/>
 &gt; anyone else.  It should work that the groups damage counts as one. I<br/>
 &gt; believe<br/>
 &gt; that this would cut down on the amount of kills that are stolen.  It <br/>

 &gt; like an easy fix and it makes logical sense.<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; What is everyone else&#39;s opinion, and has anybody heard of Verant<br/>
 &gt; commenting<br/>
 &gt; on this issue?<br/>
