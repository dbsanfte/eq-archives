<div id="ygrps-yiv-1224625713">I agree with Vicki!  When Sierra&#39;s customer service went down, we (on<br/>
the realm) were all informed that Middle Earth wouldnt even be started<br/>
for at least a year, if not more.<br/>
<br/>
Also, Stephen Nichols is the one who is doin all the developing.  As<br/>
any realmer (ex realmer even) knows, Stephen blew us ALL off and left<br/>
for greener pastures.  He was one of the only ones actually<br/>
implementing stuff in the game, when he dumped the game, everything<br/>
suffered.  Any game being worked on by such a fickle person would have<br/>
to suck.  Maybe not at first, but eventually he&#39;ll lose interest in<br/>
that and dump it too.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Realm.  The Realm at first was a big game, but<br/>
&gt; over time ppl got tired of<br/>
&gt; it<br/>
&gt; &gt; and they quit playing where is the Realm now?  It<br/>
&gt; might still be there but<br/>
&gt; &gt; how often is it updated, how many ppl are on there<br/>
&gt; now to play with or<br/>
&gt; &gt; against?  I like EQ about as much as the next<br/>
&gt; person, but I have a feeling<br/>
&gt; &gt; we won&#39;t see it around or as big as it is now for<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d say 2-3 more years,<br/>
&gt; &gt; with games such as Middle-Earth, Asherions Call<br/>
&gt; and I&#39;ve heard of one more<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you played Realm then you would know better then<br/>
&gt; to even think for one<br/>
&gt; minute that with Stephen involved in Middle Earth -<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s not going to be<br/>
&gt; anything but a mess.  I don&#39;t think he could program<br/>
&gt; his way out of a paper<br/>
&gt; bag! And I for one will NEVER buy a game that he is<br/>
&gt; involved in.<br/>
&gt; Been there, done that! lol<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; People left Realm to come here for the most part,<br/>
&gt; Sierra is in trouble -<br/>
&gt; Middle Earth is not being worked on at this time and<br/>
&gt; it will be years before<br/>
&gt; it comes out if ever. It would not surprise me to<br/>
&gt; see somewhere down the<br/>
&gt; road that Sierra sells the rights to it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Its the same with everything in life, things change<br/>
&gt; and in the computer<br/>
&gt; industry they improve at an alarming rate. On a<br/>
&gt; Monday you can buy a state<br/>
&gt; of the art CD Rom and by Friday something better has<br/>
&gt; come out.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I mean 2-3 years for a game is a very long time. I<br/>
&gt; love EQ just as much as<br/>
&gt; the next person (for now-hehe) but that won&#39;t stop<br/>
&gt; me from looking around<br/>
&gt; when something better comes out :)<br/>
