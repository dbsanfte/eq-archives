<b>Subject:</b> Rahotep <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1683864394">Anyone have any information on where/when Rahotep spawns?  Rahotep,<br/>
being, of course, the named mummy that spawns in North Ro that drops<br/>
the Scepter of Rahotep (a 9/38 1-handed weapon).<br/>
<br/>
I had read that he spawns just south of the undead ruins every two<br/>
days at midnight.  But I was there on an odd and an even day at<br/>
midnight and no Rahotep.  I talked to one person in the zone and they<br/>
said they saw Rahotep near the Runed pillar (next to the beach)<br/>
and the sun was out.<br/>
<br/>
Is this something I&#39;m gonna need a ranger for?</div>
