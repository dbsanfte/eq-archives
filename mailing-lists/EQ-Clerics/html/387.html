<b>Subject:</b> Cleric only weapons & first day in Mistmoore <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-523434038">Heck if even druids can get a weapon (Wee Harvester) that only they can<br/>
equip i bet there is a cleric only weapon somewhere around Norrath. I&#39;d be<br/>
surprised if not. It&#39;s just damn hard to come by. But even if there isn&#39;t that<br/>
kind of weapons i&#39;m still happy playing my cleric. At level 25 i am doing less<br/>
melee than never before because the mobs hit my party members so hard<br/>
that i need to be very careful in watching their health. Especially if there<br/>
are pure casters in group.<br/>
<br/>
The first time we had a tough situation in Mistmoore and i had to do greater<br/>
heal twice on a party member all the critters suddenly attacked me and i was<br/>
slayed in a matter of seconds. I was the only one to die on that assault.<br/>
Sometimes clerics life is hard :(. That has not happened again though. We<br/>
killed plenty of inkies there that day *grin*. And i did get enough melee that<br/>
day that i was able to max out my 2HB skill for the level that i just had <br/>
gained. Now i need to max my 1HB skill... there is a bit more work to do.<br/>
