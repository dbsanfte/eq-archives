<div id="ygrps-yiv-157369350">When I was in Kerra Isle at 24, she was green to me, and the druid I was<br/>
grouped with was also 24.  The druid was getting xp (while I was not, oddly<br/>
enough, but I&#39;ve seen that happen before with greens).  Based on what I saw,<br/>
she&#39;s probably around 18-20.  She is basically a cleric of about lv 14, as<br/>
she will cast center, holy armor, and can smite quite a few times.  Also she<br/>
can heal herself with Healing, so as a lone cleric it can be a long<br/>
mana-burning battle, especially if you don&#39;t kill the other two pristesses<br/>
on the side.  She really doesn&#39;t have a lot of HP, but the hardest part<br/>
about killing her is the two Kerran Pristesses that sit on each side of her.<br/>
They can cast light healing on her, but with there being two of them, they<br/>
can heal her quite quickly.  I&#39;d recommend having Holy Might ready and a<br/>
partner, and both be around 20-22 before you venture trying to kill her.<br/>
Not that she&#39;s really tough, just that her placement can make it tough.  :)<br/>

&gt; What appx. level is Mitty?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;3) Go To Kerra Isle, Kill High Priestess Mitty several hundred times, she<br/>
&gt; &gt;drops most of what you need. You will get the Copper, Silver and Gold<br/>
&gt; &gt;rings from her. Again each ring will have a pos and neg attribute.<br/>
