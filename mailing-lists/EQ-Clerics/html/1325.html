<div id="ygrps-yiv-1823848441">Another cleric on the list I moderate named Lemac Justerian had an excellent<br/>
idea to solve the camping problem that didn&#39;t end up penalizing any<br/>
particular group or result in a huge amount of GM time being spent<br/>
arbitrating arguments among groups as to who should yield and who should<br/>
have the camp spot.<br/>
<br/>
His suggestion was that coveted items be made random spawns on different<br/>
mobs for the level of that item, and that the spawns of the critters be<br/>
random, as well.  Like the way the black pearls and Box of Abu-Kar are now.<br/>
I know I have found a Box of Abu-Kar on an ogre guard, and the spectres in<br/>
Feerott also drop them, but it is totally random and total luck.<br/>
<br/>
This way, these high level kill stealers wouldn&#39;t be able to time the spawn<br/>
of the one and only critter who drops the item and then run in to steal it.<br/>
It also would eliminate camping one particular area for that one critter<br/>
that drops that item.<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like a good idea to me.<br/>
