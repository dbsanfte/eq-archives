<b>Subject:</b> begging (the skill) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-423702076">This topic of begging begs the question (pun intended) about the<br/>
begging skill.  Is it as worthless as it seems?  I&#39;m not sure what<br/>
my skill is in it.  I have an enchanter friend that has like 80 beg<br/>
and he said all he ever got was a few deaths and a copper piece.<br/>
<br/>
And is the way to increase beg without having to beg someone&#39;s pet?<br/>
They apparently fixed it so you can&#39;t beg the boats anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Ergo 15th level cleric<br/>
high elf<br/>
