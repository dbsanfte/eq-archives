<div id="ygrps-yiv-1330998624">I was about to start my own topic with quests but someone beat me to it.<br/>
Right now with quests, armor and such most classes I dont even bother<br/>
anymore.  I dont care what I am wielding what I am wearing.  Hey I am level<br/>
27 and I still wear some banded pieces and my good old spiked collar, but I<br/>
just got my Lizzy Cloak which wasnt to hard to get :)Going off the topic a<br/>
bit yeah the extra +5 dex I noticed did help my channeling A LOT!!!!  Anyway<br/>
back to the topic.   Why because I dont want to camp a site for 2 weeks that<br/>
when it is my turn to get that item only to get it kill stolen or someone<br/>
else in the group got greedy and took it.  Quests in EQ are about camping<br/>
till you get the item.  Its that easy.  I agree with Eachann about making<br/>
rare items spawn random.  Seems like Verant doesnt have the know how to<br/>
program that into the system.  It will reduce the camping a lot and IMHO I<br/>
think it will make the game much more fun instead of people staying weeks<br/>
even months in 1 zone.  If our characters ever got fat from camping 1 site<br/>
over and over and not exercising,  most of us would start looking like a<br/>
Orge.  <br/>

p.s Oh about my previous post about not finding a group...  Looks like in 3<br/>
months when I was gone things have changed.  Thanks guys.<br/>

IF they want to stop camping, why do they make quests like this?   It is<br/>
just stupid.  Look at what they did to the cleric armor quest... everything<br/>
on it takes 7 hours or more to spawn.   And making us camp Bilge just adds<br/>
insult to injury.. .i mean that goblin is HEAVILY camped already because it<br/>
holds teh Kedge Totem and some kind of belt.  It rarely spawns and has<br/>
people lined up for a chance at him, and now they gave it the cleric armor<br/>
icon as well so we not only have to compete for this rare spawn with other<br/>
clerics, but also with every other class who wants his items...<br/>
*sigh*  <br/>
<br/>
Why can&#39;t they make the quests like the Warriors aviak charm quest... where<br/>
we could kill just normal MOBs and they would rarely drop the icon?   This<br/>
would make it still difficult to get the piece, since it would be a rare<br/>
(very rare??) drop... but we could just hunt and try to find it instead of<br/>
having to camp one rare spawn.    Or maybe they could make it not a hunt at<br/>
all, but rather a spawn that can come up in random locations, random zones,<br/>
and you need to follow clues or solve a puzzle in order to know where and<br/>
when it will spawn?  Something like that... these camping quests just (for<br/>
lack of a better term) suck.    They said they wanted to put the &quot;Quest&quot;<br/>
back in EverQuest, but all they have done is put more emphasis than ever on<br/>
CAMP.  <br/>
<br/>
Oh well, who am I to say... just another player... one of many...<br/>
