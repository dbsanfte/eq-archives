<div id="ygrps-yiv-1144782967">I personally prefer Mistmoore over Unrest in almost every case, now.  One<br/>
notable exception, however, is that as a cleric you will be _very_ hard<br/>
pressed to solo here effectively.  To judge how well you would do with the<br/>
weakest mobs, go into Crushbone and try to solo D&#39;Vinn without his dagger.<br/>
If you can kill him easily, then you&#39;ll have no problem there with a single<br/>
Initiate Familiar.  Problem is, most of the spawns come in at least twos,<br/>
some come in threes.<br/>
    And anything under 10 people killing things around the base of the tower<br/>
will result in trains at least as ugly as those in Unrest.  At level 20, you<br/>
may want to stick to Unrest for a level or two.  Mistmoore has an ugly<br/>
tendency to turn on a healer the moment they finish their first heal spell<br/>
in a battle.  And when a blue initiate familiar is beating on me double<br/>
rounds, sometimes hitting for 31-40, it makes my job at healing a little<br/>
tougher.  With a proper group, though, you can gain xp super-quick.  I made<br/>
24 from 23 in at most 6 played hours, at least an hour of which was sitting<br/>
in Lesser Fay waiting for the Ancillae train on the other side to clear out.<br/>
Keep in mind that some things there can see invis, too.  Hope that helps ya.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now that I&#39;m Lvl 20 I&#39;ve been wanting to go else where to get some nice<br/>
exp<br/>
&gt; instade of Highpass.  I know Unrest is good and I&#39;m thinking of going back<br/>
&gt; there, but is there any other place for a Lvl 20 Cleric to go for good exp<br/>
&gt; thats not to hard?  Is MistMoore to hard for a Lvl 20?<br/>
