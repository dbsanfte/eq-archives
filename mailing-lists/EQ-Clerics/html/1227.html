<div id="ygrps-yiv-1725246429">I&#39;m only 15th, but I generally help anyone with binds/buffs and heals.<br/>
The other day I went to the orc lift and offered free binds and buffs<br/>
and a dozen people showed up.  I have a cracked staff in the bank, and<br/>
maybe if I&#39;m feeling nice, I&#39;ll give it to a low level cleric one of<br/>
these days.  But not if anyone asked me for anything.<br/>
<br/>
Someone did (t)ell me the other day asking for some extra money.  He<br/>
was 2nd level.  I told him he needed to earn it like I did, and like<br/>
everyone else did.  I play on the test, and it tends to be friendlier<br/>
than other servers, and people help each other out, but for crying out<br/>
loud.  No 2nd level should be asking for anything.  Kinda defeats the<br/>
purpose of the game at that point.<br/>
<br/>
Point being, I&#39;ll throw away mana like it&#39;s going out of style.  It&#39;s<br/>
just mana.  I don&#39;t care.  But I have only given things to my RL<br/>
friends in the game.  I had to earn the stuff, and so should everyone<br/>
else.</div>
