<div id="ygrps-yiv-44199930">Instill fear is great if you are solo and pull 2 MOBs, or if you have no<br/>
enchanter/bard in your group and need to give the group some time.  One<br/>
caveat: fear is BAD in dungeons.  The AE fear (wave of fear) is a great<br/>
spell later as it can be used to get the MOBs off of the group while the<br/>
evac&#39;er gets off his/her ggate.<br/>

&gt; I just made 24, and just bought my spells<br/>
&gt; greater healing<br/>
&gt; bravery<br/>
&gt; wave of fear<br/>
&gt; counteract poison<br/>
&gt; symbol of Ryltan (and 20 bloodstones)<br/>
&gt; dismiss undead<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I didn&#39;t buy hammer of striking (what a joke), and I didn&#39;t buy<br/>
&gt; instill fear.  Reason being I never used fear.  But my question is:<br/>
&gt; Is instill fear worth buying?  Is there some marvelous tactic using<br/>
&gt; the fear spells that I&#39;m not familiar with?  I figured wave of fear<br/>
&gt; would be really, really handy, but instill fear was kind of worthless<br/>
&gt; compared to it, if I understand them correctly.  Can someone shed<br/>
&gt; some light?<br/>
