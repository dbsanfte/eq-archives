<div id="ygrps-yiv-1682417509">Thanks for the advice.  I think I&#39;ll stick with the high-elf for now. <br/>
I wanted to play a cleric of something-Nife the god of healing.  But <br/>
the high-elf&#39;s all worship Tunare, I guess.  Oh well. <br/>

&gt;Congratulations, Curtis.. Your personal life will start suffering very <br/>
&gt;soon from this highly addictive game. <br/>

girlfriend.  Maybe she won&#39;t leave me.  :) <br/>

BTW, I&#39;m Ergo.  Me and my friends are playing on the test server.</div>
