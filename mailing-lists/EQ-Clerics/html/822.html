<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-844293422">For those dying for the upcoming expansion pak the bad news is, it won&#39;t be<br/>
out before Christmas BUT March 16th, 2000.  On EQVault today they had a post<br/>
from a guy that went to Gen-Con and he said it wouldn&#39;t be out till<br/>
3-16-2000.<br/>
Speaking of the pak many ppl keep saying they are adding more lvls for us,<br/>
Brad himself has stated before they didn&#39;t know if we would be getting more<br/>
lvls.  He said they saw no real reason to give us more lvls.  A bit later he<br/>
said something about if they did it might be from Lvl 50-60.  I think 50 is<br/>
cool for now but if they do give us more I think it should be at least 75.<br/>
As I was writing this I read more on EQVault they guy said Verant is<br/>
thinking of raising the lvl cap to 55 or so.  Gee a whole 5 lvls!!<br/>
