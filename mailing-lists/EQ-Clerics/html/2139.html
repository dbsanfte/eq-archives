<div id="ygrps-yiv-1492862835">Wow, Thank you for all the information, I really do appreciate this.  I&#39;ll have<br/>
to do a little more digging, and if there&#39;s anything else you want to add,<br/>
please do so.<br/>
one more question, I usually get times to play on the weekend (though I didn&#39;t<br/>
get a chance to play for about 3 weeks), What is the Latest Server?  And have<br/>
they said if another new one will be coming on line anytime soon?<br/>
Thanks again :)<br/>
