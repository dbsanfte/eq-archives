<div id="ygrps-yiv-1434071582">Tis hard till you get to 14th level. 8th you get meditate and all seems great and then 10th to 11th you think ow that warrior isnt healing very fast wheres all my mana gone - these are lean levels where you yearn for level 14. The healing spell you get then will keep you going into the eatly 20&#39;s and be great for other than the real high hp guys like the ogres and trolls...bigger and better healing spells are on their way - as long as you keep that wisdom going up you will keep being able to heal the party pro rata to your level...you didnt say but what is your race and wisdom - as long as your wisdom is 100+ you will do fine just give it time...and some will say lower as you can pick + wisdom items up in the game and the extra doesnt mean alot at the start..personally I am a dwarf with a base of 110 and glad I have alot of mana; personal preference. Good luck and dont worry it does get better...clerics rock!!<br/>

    Subject: [EQ-Clerics] My Experience With a Level 2 Cleric<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
        I just created a Cleric today and got him up to level 2.  At the guild shop I noticed so many classes of spells...attack spells, healings spells, and other spells were all handled by different NPC&#39;s.  I&#39;ll be spending A LOT of money on spells.  I do have a minor gripe with clerics, though.  They just don&#39;t have enough total mana, and the Minor Healing spell isn&#39;t strong enough.  I was grouped up with a Warrior and after wasting all of my mana healing him four times, only half of his health had grown back.  Clerics need more mana!  What do you think?<br/>
