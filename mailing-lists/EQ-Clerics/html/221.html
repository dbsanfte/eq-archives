<b>Subject:</b> Effects of raising wisdom <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-146399150">When I raise my wisdom 5 points though a magical item, how exactly does that<br/>
affect my mana?  Does my mana get recalculated as if I had a character with<br/>
the new wisdom value through all levels?  If so, this seems to be a<br/>
fantastic way to jack up your mana.  I see items all around that raise your<br/>
mana directly by 20 or so, but it would seem that a minor adjustment in<br/>
wisdom (if the above were true) would make a better improvement.<br/>
<br/>
Basically my question is what happens when you raise your wisdom?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
