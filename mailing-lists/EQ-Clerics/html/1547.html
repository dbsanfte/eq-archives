<div id="ygrps-yiv-2147257480">Unrest is perfect when there are around 40 people in the zone.  Less than 30<br/>
there and you are looking at trains.  The best place to be in your mid-20s<br/>
is in a room in the house *IF* the other rooms are also camped. If you are<br/>
the only one in the house, you WILL be fighting the entire house because<br/>
everything can see through the walls and floors (except the basement).  You<br/>
can get insane exp and loot in the hand room, the bar room, the tower, or<br/>
the reclusive ghoul magi room, but you have to others in the house.<br/>

&gt; I was at Unrest at lvl 23 with a full group including a 2nd cleric.  The<br/>
&gt; place was horrible.  Death after death after death.  Between deaths and<br/>
&gt; running to the zone there were no points made.  The only time we<br/>
&gt; were there<br/>
&gt; successfully was in a room (hand room) i think.  Then shortly a high lvl<br/>
&gt; cleric came in and ran us out....i am now almost lvl 27 and haven&#39;t been<br/>
&gt; back yet.  I may try to go back soon though...<br/>
