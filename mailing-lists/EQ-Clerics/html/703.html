<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1986803020">1) I have never bought anything Everquest related on Ebay. However I have,<br/>
in the past, used Ebay for other transactions. I have NEVER been ripped<br/>
off. On rare occasions, I know of people who have been. Ebay has ways of handling<br/>
these things. The chance of being ripped off on Ebay seems to be higher<br/>
in certain categories than others, though (beanie babies, furbies, I know<br/>
for sure)<br/>
<br/>
I have also sold on Ebay. It is not ebay&#39;s fault that people are dishonest.<br/>
<br/>
2) I believe Verant officially frowns on this practice. But there is<br/>
not a lo they can do to stop it.<br/>

&gt; Has anybody seen what you can buy for Everquest on Ebay...if you want a <br/>
&gt; laugh go to www.ebay.com in the search box type everquest *** where *** is <br/>
&gt; your server name..ex &quot;everquest karana&quot;. See what comes up. I saw 5000PP <br/>
&gt; going for over $100.00..I also saw a bloodforge hammer going for <br/>
&gt; $30.00...that&#39;s real money..I see them sell for around 30pp in the game..Am <br/>
&gt; I to understand a Platinum is equivalant to a dollar..I could only <br/>
&gt; dream...just thought everybody would get a kick out of that. What are your <br/>
&gt; thoughts on this practice? Anybody have any nightmare stories about getting <br/>
&gt; ripped off?<br/>
