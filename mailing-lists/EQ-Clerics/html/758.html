<div id="ygrps-yiv-1670621507">I completely agree with you. Verant needs to fix the coding on this, to make <br/>
sure that the group gets the kill...or...whoever attacks the MOB first gets <br/>
the kill. Its very very disheartening to camp something for hours and hours <br/>
with your group, just to have a wizard or other high level spell casting <br/>
class come along and take it with one shot.<br/>

Please forgive, for I am new to this list, but here is my problem and<br/>
suggestion for Verant:<br/>
<br/>
My number one problem with the game is kill stealing. This frustrates me to<br/>
no end.  I can&#39;t begin to tell you how long I have been trying for a Shiny<br/>
Brass Shield in Crushbone and how many kills have been stolen from me from<br/>
some mage hiding in a tree.<br/>
<br/>
I think the problem is how Verant determines who gets the kill. As I<br/>
understand it, the single person that inflicts the most damage is awarded<br/>
the kill.  This means that it does not matter if you are grouped and your<br/>
group does more damage than the spell caster.  Does this seem crazy to<br/>
anyone else.  It should work that the groups damage counts as one. I believe<br/>
that this would cut down on the amount of kills that are stolen.  It seems<br/>
like an easy fix and it makes logical sense.<br/>
<br/>
What is everyone else&#39;s opinion, and has anybody heard of Verant commenting<br/>
on this issue?<br/>
