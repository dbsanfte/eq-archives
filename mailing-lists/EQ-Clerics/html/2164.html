<div id="ygrps-yiv-1005502504">The best suggestion that I can give you is to keep pushing forward... when I was a cleric in my teens I was very tempted to make a new character because in all honesty, it just wasn&#39;t very much fun at that time.   Once you get your level 19 spells though, things become a lot more fun.   You up your DD spell to smite which does 80-some damage per hit and you get what has become one of my favorite spells,  Holy Might.    Holy Might does 30-some damage and puts a pretty long stun on the MOB.   You also get nice buffs at 19, Bravery and Spirit Armor.    Then at 24 you can add Greater Healing to all that...     The teens really suck for a cleric, but now that I&#39;m level 27 I wouldn&#39;t trade my cleric for any other class... stick with it and just keep trying to find groups... because it is in groups that the clerics power shows.   We simply aren&#39;t meant to play solo as clerics...<br/>

&gt; I also seem to have this trouble finding a group even though I will heal<br/>
&gt; anyone that I see hurt whether in combat or just resting.    I think it is<br/>
&gt; mainly my level though on my part.  It seems to me that most people wish to<br/>
&gt; solo yet at 10th - 12th level.   I am really getting very discouraged as I<br/>
&gt; have been level 10 for weeks now.  It seems that every time I get a bar of<br/>
&gt; exp I die a couple of times and lose it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I hunt normally either in ButcherBlock or around the entrance to CrushBone.<br/>
&gt; It seems that BB is mostly deserted when I am around and there is nothing<br/>
&gt; for me to hunt there.  I have hunted the Chess Board a couple of times when<br/>
&gt; I was able to find a group.   The orcs around the CB entrance are either low<br/>
&gt; green (no exp) or else there are 3 or more at once on me and that is death<br/>
&gt; for sure.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Any suggestions would be appreciated.<br/>

&gt; &gt; You know..I see these messages every no and then about cant find a group<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; just cannot understand it. No matter where I have been I have always been<br/>
&gt; &gt; welcomed into a group within a matter of minutes. Sometimes It would take<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; little work on my part. Such as casting buffs and heals on passer bys or<br/>
&gt; &gt; what not. Here is the line that I use. &quot;Cleric of the X circle seeks group<br/>
&gt; &gt; to heal in battle&quot;. seems to work great for me. Who would&#39;nt want a<br/>
&gt; cleric?<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;Well I am back :P  Took a nice 3 month break from my cleric and EQ.  WOW<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;have things changed.  I was in High Hold going to East Co and had to go<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;through Kichlor Forest.  I almost died trying to get through.  I didnt<br/>
&gt; know<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;they changed that area.  DAMN!!!!!!  Anyway....  The reason I decided to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;leave because I couldnt find a group in any of the places.  I still<br/>
&gt; couldnt<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;believe noone wanted a cleric in their group.  Well I am level 25 and<br/>
&gt; just<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;wondering where can I hunt?  The best places that a cleric will feel<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;welcomed,  and if you say unrest no way!!!!  Thanks guys :)<br/>
