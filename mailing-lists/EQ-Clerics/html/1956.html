<div id="ygrps-yiv-950062069">At level 42 I have not developed any trade skills either.  And probably<br/>
won&#39;t unless they become specific to a quest item that I need.  I tinkered<br/>
with brewing for awhile because alcohol consumption is a fine skill to<br/>
master ;) but found that sitting in a city to work up that skill took away<br/>
from valuable killing/exploration time.  That and I am just lazy ;)  Also -<br/>
I have always had enough plat to purchase what I need without supplementing<br/>
my income with trade skills.<br/>
