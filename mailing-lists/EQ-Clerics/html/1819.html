&gt; I have been looking for Jovan the Fervent in Highpass hold. No luck yet.<br/>
&gt; Has anyone seen him?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have also been searching in Kithicor for the burned down hut. I found two<br/>
&gt; of them so far, but no icon/ingots. Near one hut were four shadowed men. I<br/>
&gt; and another cleric died trying to kill them, thinking that maybe one of<br/>
&gt; them has a part.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also, has anyone found the icon in Lake Rathe that belongs to the Reliant?<br/>
