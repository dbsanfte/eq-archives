<div id="ygrps-yiv-881567129">ok....have any of you seen this piece of CRAP?!?!  I can not beleive they<br/>
put this into the game to be honest....because well, in my opinion, even if<br/>
it IS hard to get....more will fall, and as more come....it devalues the<br/>
cleric.<br/>
<br/>
The effect is 10 charges of RES.  Now, if this can be recharged.....you have<br/>
a nice staff to pull your ass out of the fire and dont need that cleric<br/>
anymore.....Clerics, Palys, Druids and Shaman can wield the sucker too.<br/>
Yeah, a dragon drops it (Vox)  but its still BULL@!^& to me that they would<br/>
even do that after saying they want no one else to be able to res.<br/>
