Unrest is the lowest level zone of all what I call &quot;high pressure zones&quot;...<br/>
by high pressure i mean the trains and the fighting can get pretty intense.<br/>
Don&#39;t get me wrong, all zones have trains and can have intense fighting...<br/>
but certain zones are big xp/loot zones and have much more danger... Unrest<br/>
is the lowest level of these zones.  As a result, you get a lot of people<br/>
there who haven&#39;t really &quot;grown up&quot; yet, as it is the first high pressure<br/>
zone they&#39;ve been in.   You also have a lot of people who have matured in EQ<br/>
and know how to group... but when you do a pick-up group you never know what<br/>
you are gonna get...<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand when I am in a group like Cazic where most people are<br/>
level 30&#39;ish.. almost all of them have this experience and know their roles<br/>
in the group and how to handle different situations.  That&#39;s not to say you<br/>
won&#39;t get bad groups in Cazic (or Guk, Sol, etc) but I think your chances of<br/>
getting a GOOD group are significantly better... that has been my experience<br/>
anyway.<br/>
<br/>
This is just my theory =)  Who knows, maybe i&#39;m way off base &lt;grins&gt; but<br/>
based on my own experience it seems to be the truth...<br/>

&gt;Ya, you&#39;re right.  Just something in me felt guilty about leaving.  After<br/>
&gt;all, I was the group leader, and I had invited people in to the group.  But<br/>
&gt;next time, I will definately know better... famous last words...<br/>

&gt;Personally, I would have left that group...and fast. It was established in<br/>
&gt;the beginning that you had problems with teamwork (the loot thing). If I<br/>

&gt;&gt; Hi all,<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; The following is just a rant. Nothing of substance, just me venting about<br/>
