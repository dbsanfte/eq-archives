<div id="ygrps-yiv-1922057681">Um, not raising the level cap would be a really, really bad idea. High level<br/>
characters would leave in droves for Asheron&#39;s Call, Middle Earth, whatever<br/>
else is out there.<br/>
<br/>
Part of the fun, and the addictive factor, of RPG&#39;s is the illusion of<br/>
growth: every day you get stronger, more powerful, able to to places you<br/>
were not able to before -- cf. the Plane of Fear discussion -- and<br/>
successfully kill critters that you would have run in terror from a few<br/>
levels before.<br/>
<br/>
If characters stop growing, a lot of the fun of the game is gone. I hit the<br/>
level cap in Balder&#39;s Gate about midway through Chapter 4...and lost<br/>
interest in the game a few days later. Haven&#39;t finished it, probably won&#39;t<br/>
ever.<br/>
<br/>
I am not sure why Verant would NOT want to raise the level cap.<br/>
<br/>
I imagine there might be ways to fake it. For example, besides items that<br/>
raise stats, there might be items that raised one&#39;s Offensive or Defensive<br/>
or weapons capabilities beyond their caps at level 50, making you<br/>
effectively a level 55 or 60 or higher character, even though you are still<br/>
nominally level 50. Hm. That might be interesting.<br/>
<br/>
Still, I think Verant has to do something to allow players to increase their<br/>
capabilities beyond 50, and to provide challenging places for them to go to<br/>
exercise those capabilities, if they want to retain their player base.<br/>

&gt;For those dying for the upcoming expansion pak the bad news is, it won&#39;t be<br/>
&gt;out before Christmas BUT March 16th, 2000.  On EQVault today they had a<br/>
 </span></blockquote>post<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;from a guy that went to Gen-Con and he said it wouldn&#39;t be out till<br/>
&gt;3-16-2000.<br/>
&gt;Speaking of the pak many ppl keep saying they are adding more lvls for us,<br/>
&gt;Brad himself has stated before they didn&#39;t know if we would be getting more<br/>
&gt;lvls.  He said they saw no real reason to give us more lvls.  A bit later<br/>
 </span></blockquote>he<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;said something about if they did it might be from Lvl 50-60.  I think 50 is<br/>
&gt;cool for now but if they do give us more I think it should be at least 75.<br/>
&gt;As I was writing this I read more on EQVault they guy said Verant is<br/>
&gt;thinking of raising the lvl cap to 55 or so.  Gee a whole 5 lvls!!<br/>
