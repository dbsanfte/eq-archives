<div id="ygrps-yiv-1832468410">Someone mentioned on here a while back about going to Paw and giving<br/>
the Paladin in the cell the note (or prayer beads?) from the Blessed<br/>
Oil flask.  I am 18th level, and while I can afford all of my 19th<br/>
level spells, if I can get a lot of them for free, it will certainly<br/>
be worth it.  Can anyone give me approximate directions on how to get<br/>
to the Paladin in the cell?<br/>
  I&#39;m thinking I can bind myself at the Bridge, and deliver the thing<br/>
to the Pally, gate back, use the WK shortcut to get back to Qeynos<br/>
get another one, and then gate back, and avoid crossing WK altogether,<br/>
and do this several times.  It should be an amazing time saver, and I<br/>
can get a lot of the spells I need.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.</div>
