&gt; Ok, all this IPX talk, and we&#39;ve forgotten the original post--I too am<br/>
&gt; getting strange lag at times, which has never happened before. And my<br/>
&gt; meter is not showing any lag at all. I find it disconcerting, to say the<br/>
&gt; least. Rest assured, I have a very fast computer/graphics setup, and a<br/>
&gt; fast modem. I recently downloaded a big 28 meg SBLive! upgrade...I<br/>
&gt; wonder if that crap has affected my gameplay somehow...I hate some of<br/>
&gt; those SBLive! components.<br/>

I seem to zone slowly...<br/>
<br/>
About 2 weeks ago, I started getting disconnected when I zone.  Not just once,<br/>
but nearly everytime.  I wrote EQ tech support, but solved the problem on my<br/>
own without them.<br/>
<br/>
With all of the screenshots I had taken and never cleaned up, as well as the<br/>
email that had been piling up and never read (all those distribution lists I<br/>
used to pay attention to before I became an EQ Addict), my harddrive partition<br/>
was getting full, and was extremely fragmented.<br/>
<br/>
I cleaned up the email, removed 90% of the screenshots, defraged, and my<br/>
problems went away.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I still get disconnected sometimes due to network problems (lag, etc.)<br/>
but tracert will tell me if it&#39;s local, in-route, or on the EQ end, so I know<br/>
when to panic or not.  And the client problems are gone after a small amount<br/>
of sys maintenance.<br/>
