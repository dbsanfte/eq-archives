<div id="ygrps-yiv-928808620">Well, I had fun getting this awesome weapon over the holidays. If you would<br/>
like to know all the details, read on. Warning: it&#39;s kinda long...<br/>

This is a hidden quest given by Gavel in the Temple of Solusek Ro. If you<br/>
hail him and say &quot;What of Sacrament&quot;, he says that the Ingot and Icon are<br/>
merely legend! He also says that if you could bring him both Ingot, Icon and<br/>
2 magnetized platinum bars, that he could forge something very special:<br/>
<br/>
Ingot of the Sacrament:<br/>
Go to the Rathe Mountains and find the Undead Ruins. To get there, as you<br/>
zone in from the Feerrott, take a left at the first 4-way intersection you<br/>
come to. Keep the mountain wall on your left and you will eventually come<br/>
upon a gold tower with undead, this is NOT the spawn. Keep going until you<br/>
see what looks like a druid teleport spot (ruins) with undead; this is it.<br/>
Here spawn the giant undead skeletons. You are looking for the rare spawn<br/>
that looks like a giant dread bone skel (dark brownish-red in color). He is<br/>
a low 30th lvl mob and will be quite tough to solo. I, a 34th Cleric, and a<br/>
27th Rogue took him easily. We even had another normal giant skel wacking on<br/>
us, so a group of 3 or so at 30 should do. Also, these guys drop &quot;A skeletal<br/>
finger&quot;, which is a Necro quest for Shadowbound armor. You could use this to<br/>
attract the company of a necromancer to aid you in destroying the spawn.<br/>
<br/>
Icon of the Sacrament:<br/>
To get the Icon you must travel to Mistmoore. At the back of the Graveyard<br/>
there is a secret wall (back left, facing the graveyard). Pass through and<br/>
you will be in a small, square room. There is yet another secret wall<br/>
immediately to your right as you enter. Go through and you will find<br/>
yourself in a room with 4 doors. The only door that can be opened is the one<br/>
you are facing as you enter. But be warned, opening the door causes the<br/>
other 3 to open. And unless there is a party camping there, there will be a<br/>
nasty creature behind each. There is only 1 wall with 2 doors. The Icon is<br/>
behind the left door of this wall. It is lying on the ground and looks like<br/>
a voodoo doll. Also, this is a 6-hour spawn. I like to call this one my<br/>
&quot;12pp solution&quot;. Why? Because that&#39;s how much a potion of invisibility costs<br/>
=) I traveled to Mistmoore and asked if there was a party in the graveyard,<br/>
and there was. I asked if they had been killing the things in the secret<br/>
room, they had been. I asked if they had picked up the doll behind the door<br/>
and they told me they had done so about 2 hours before. So....I just logged<br/>
and came back 4 hours later, which happened to be around 6:00AM. This worked<br/>
out great because nobody was in-zone at that time. Drank my invisibility<br/>
potion, strolled in, opened the door, picked it up and got the heck out.<br/>
<br/>
Magnetized Platinum Bars:<br/>
Purchase 2 regular Platinum Bars from a Jewelry shop or from an Enchanter<br/>
(hint: create an Enchanter and dump all points into CHA and check the<br/>
prices). Take these to Ostorm in the Temple of Solusek Ro (he will be<br/>
upstairs through several doors on the right side of the Temple). Give Ostorm<br/>
1 bar at a time and he will return it to your inventory as a Magnetized<br/>
Platinum Bar.<br/>
<br/>
Give Gavel the Ingot, Icon and both Magnetized bars (I separated the bars)<br/>
and he will give you your reward:<br/>

I constantly hit for 28&#39;s with this thing (89 STR). When I cast Frenzied<br/>
Strength and Yaulp II, I get some in the low 30&#39;s. Truly awesome weapon that<br/>
is relatively easy to get.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck!<br/>
