 </span></blockquote>O I have yet to go after each of these individual mobs myself so it&#39;s a bit<br/>
hard to say how difficult they are, but one way to determined how hard it<br/>
is, is by looking at what zone the item is in.  You can bet that the mob<br/>
that carries these things are going to be harder then the average mob in<br/>
that zone...or on par with the hardest...although this might not hold true<br/>
in all cases.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the items that have been listed by me and other posters, from what I<br/>
can see, are mobs that you can kill from 25+.  The lowest difficulty one<br/>
that I&#39;ve see so far are the king and warlord in RE...I can be wrong in this<br/>
though.<br/>
