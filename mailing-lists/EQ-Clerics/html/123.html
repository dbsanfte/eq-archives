<div id="ygrps-yiv-1527787788">It really depends on what you are fighting. I am LVL 23 and I am always <br/>
memorizing new spells. All you can do is memorize the spells you think you <br/>
will need next. It takes practice. Good luck<br/>

 casted often and i can&#39;t decide on what to keep memmed at all times.<br/>
