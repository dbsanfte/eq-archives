&gt; Evil, yet healing?  Yeah, I know, I could take the<br/>
&gt;notion that evil people are good to other evil people,<br/>
&gt;but that seems almost like a cop out...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The way I think about it for my own dark elf is that, although Innoruuk<br/>
likes<br/>
death,sometimes it is necessary to keep someone alive in order for MORE<br/>
death<br/>
to occur.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, he has his clerics. Whose job is to do his will. If her spells fizzle,<br/>
obviously this was not one her god wished to be kept alive.<br/>
<br/>
What I would like to know is the experiences of other dark elves in going to<br/>
Fawdyer.</div>
