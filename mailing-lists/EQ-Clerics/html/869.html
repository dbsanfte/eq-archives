blind, fear, holy might, smite, and root.  all are good also remember to <br/>
have pro magic, poison and disease up.  I know thier DoTs use it.. ya might <br/>
want to try and get the SSoL before the fight as well as that will help <br/>
remove any DoTs that the shaman might put on ya.<br/>
<br/>
Get Stun, and Holy might in mem (if ya have the time that is) and only use <br/>
them when they start to cast... stun is a fast casting spell.  holy might is<br/>
<br/>
a little longer.  blind works well.  If it is used right before the fear <br/>
they will run away and not know where.. that could be good for ya.<br/>
<br/>
Root might not be all that good for ya as he does not need to hit you to <br/>
kill you... also have dispell magic ready, just remember it will start at <br/>
the top.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hi all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m in a guild that encourages weekly fights in pvp areas in order to<br/>
&gt;increase prestige and guild rank. I&#39;m currently a level 15 cleric, and<br/>
&gt;have been challenged by a level 14 troll shaman (yipes). Any hints,<br/>
&gt;tips, or fighting strategies would be most helpful. I am skilled in both<br/>
&gt;one handed and two handed blunt, and have a runed totem staff, a fine<br/>
&gt;steel morning star, and a Qeynos shield (ac 10). My dark elf cleric also<br/>
&gt;has 90 str, 73 sta, 99 agi, 88 dex, and 98 wis. If I can get to level 19<br/>
&gt;before sunday night (gonna have to camp Jonah Brucker all weekend with<br/>
&gt;my necro friend!), I can buy Extinguish fatigue, endure magic, daring,<br/>
&gt;holy might (not sure what the stats are on it, but it sounds promising),<br/>
&gt;extinguish fatigue, and spirit armor.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This is my second character, and I made sure (this time!) to get skill<br/>
&gt;in Divinate...so I can possibly blind the shaman at the start. I could<br/>
&gt;try fearing him, too, but don&#39;t know if that will work in the small pvp<br/>
&gt;area in neriak. Hmm. I also have cancel magic, but you know how those<br/>
&gt;shamans can cast and cast and cast....and i&#39;d hate to waste my mana. If<br/>
&gt;i buff with all the endure spells before hand, will I be all right<br/>
&gt;against his debuffing spells? I will also be wearing Crush&#39;s tunic,<br/>
&gt;which gives +8 resistance to heat, poison, magic, and cold. And I will<br/>
&gt;have some bronze, too, so my ac shouldn&#39;t be too low. However, i know<br/>
&gt;that the shaman will be in full banded. And he will be wielding a<br/>
&gt;bloodforge hammer, which he says hits for 25-26 consistently. With my<br/>
&gt;runed totem staff, i hit for 19. With the morning star, i hit for 16.<br/>
&gt;However, with his buffs, he will be extremely difficult to hit! And my<br/>
&gt;stamina will not last long at all, especially after he hits me with his<br/>
&gt;level 14 spell that sucks str, sta, and ac. Sighhhh....What&#39;s a poor<br/>
&gt;cleric to do?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Please help!<br/>
