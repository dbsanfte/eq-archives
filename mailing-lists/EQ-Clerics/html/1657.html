<div id="ygrps-yiv-1499013729">RE: [EQ-Clerics] Lvls After Expansion PakI remember reading somewhere that<br/>
when the level cap is raised with the expansion pack, the levels will be<br/>
_much_ harder to actually gain.  As in almost exponentially harder to gain.<br/>
I&#39;d have to go back thru EQVault&#39;s back issues and look, but they were<br/>
talking as though to go from 51 to 52 was going to be a very arduous process<br/>
to go through, let alone getting to 60.  Not to say that people won&#39;t reach<br/>
that quickly, still, but they&#39;ve already said they&#39;re going to make it much<br/>
more difficult to do.  And as far as gaining xp past filling the bubble for<br/>
50, I would guess that Verant thought of that a long time ago, even if some<br/>
of their other decisions seem a little short-sighted at times.  For now,<br/>
though, what&#39;s the point in speculating on something you have absolutely no<br/>
idea about, Azor?  If you&#39;re that concerned about it, post the question to<br/>
one of the EQ newsgroups that Smedley seems to read religiously.  As long as<br/>
you don&#39;t make it an irrational rant of a post, chances are that he&#39;ll give<br/>
a response.  *shrug*  Might at least answer the question...<br/>

Yeah it might be fair for them to gain Lvls with the exp they&#39;ve gained BUT<br/>
if they had enough exp to max the cap again you know a lot would throw a fit<br/>
saying it wasn&#39;t fair at all.  I know I wouldn&#39;t want to max out my Lvl cap<br/>
before the pak is released if I were already on Lvl 50 by then.  But yeah<br/>
allowing them to gain a few Lvls might be good, say go from 50 to 53 or 54<br/>
tops.  Guess we&#39;ll find out by March 16th, 2000 </span></blockquote></div>
