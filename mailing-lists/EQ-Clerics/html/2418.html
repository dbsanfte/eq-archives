I have a very old friend who contributes to the Guide program. Naturally, I<br/>
can&#39;t say who, but in the interest of preventing a similar fiasco as with<br/>
the Monk sit-in, I will confirm that players in Fenin&#39;s Fear Plane were<br/>
lagged out due to over-loading network resources on the server which houses<br/>
both Fear and West Freeport.<br/>
<br/>
The server didn&#39;t crash, the network resources were overloaded, and so<br/>
people lagged out, leaving the Fear Plane with a half-linkdead party, which<br/>
died, followed by people reconnecting into Fear as a now very lonely, and<br/>
shortly after very dead, person.<br/>
<br/>
Fear plane did not crash itself - that would have made the players safe -<br/>
because Fear does not populate for some time after a reboot. Instead, the<br/>
overload of players on the server caused the tragic and needless deaths of<br/>
people who just wanted to enjoy the game, and made their corpse recovery<br/>
even harsher.<br/>
<br/>
Clerics and Necromancers, I urge you - find a better way to protest. You are<br/>
going down a path which will, again, bring needless suffering on those who<br/>
are not participating. Non-violent protest is admirable, but if it causes<br/>
death, its no longer non-violent, is it?<br/>
-----<br/>
<br/>
I believe a sit-in, now that it is known that it causes problems to other<br/>
players, is not a good way to protest. Please invent another form of<br/>
peaceful protest, for the sake of others!<br/>
