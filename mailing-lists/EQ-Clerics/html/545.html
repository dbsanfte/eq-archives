<br/>
There has been a large discussion going on about the validity of roleplaying <br/>
in Everquest.  While I agree that there are a lot of people in the game that <br/>
don&#39;t really &#39;roleplay&#39; much, consider this.<br/>
<br/>
I believe that &#39;roleplaying&#39; has started to gain a definition that is not <br/>
due.  When I play Devotion on the Povar server, I am ALWAYS in character.  I <br/>
see through his eyes, I want what he wants, I fight what he fights.  That <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean that Devotion is likely to say &quot;Have at thee, knave!&quot;  <br/>
Interestingly, saying &#39;thee&#39; and &#39;thou&#39; exclusively really doesn&#39;t have <br/>
anything to do with roleplaying, even in a fantasy setting.  One thing to <br/>
remember about EQ is that the game DOES NOT OCCUR on Earth, or in any <br/>
specific time frame that we have a point of reference for.  There is no <br/>
reason why a person in the world of Everquest could not say the word &#39;Cool&#39; <br/>
to mean that he likes something, or &#39;That sucks!&#39; to mean that he doesn&#39;t <br/>
like something.  Roleplaying is all about the individual choices the <br/>
character makes about his ethics and morals.<br/>
<br/>
For instance:  when I play Devotion, I speak normally.  I don&#39;t say &#39;thee&#39; <br/>
or &#39;thou&#39;.  Some people do, and when they do, I continue to talk normally to <br/>
them.  That is THEIR role, not mine.  Devotion is not the kind of guy who <br/>
would try to speak formally all the time, nor is the DEFINITION of roleplay <br/>
formal speaking.  Now Devotion WOULD go out of his way to root a monster who <br/>
is chasing a player who is in danger of death.  He also WOULD offer <br/>
assistance to newbies for a period of 5-10 minutes each time he passes under <br/>
a city gate. (Those from the Freeport area of the Povar server should be <br/>
used to hearing Devotion yelling &quot;Free healing, buffs, food, and water for <br/>
newbies&quot;.  See, it&#39;s ok for me to say newbies, and buffs.  I&#39;m still <br/>
roleplaying.  The words &#39;newbies&#39; and &#39;buffs&#39; exist in the reality of <br/>
Norrath.  I still feel that I&#39;m roleplaying.<br/>
<br/>
As to the complaint that a paladin leaves someone to die, etc. etc.  <br/>
Honestly, in a world full of 1000 paladins (being conservative), I think it <br/>
is expecting too much that each of them be honorable, and follow the exact <br/>
same code.  That may make them a bad paladin within the game&#39;s reality, but <br/>
that doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that they aren&#39;t roleplaying.  I feel the same <br/>
way about druids and rangers killing forest animals.  I have met many that <br/>
don&#39;t, and many that do.  It doesn&#39;t mean they aren&#39;t roleplaying if they <br/>
kill a few bears, it just means their faith isn&#39;t as strong as it could be.  <br/>
They will pay the price with decreased faction in their guild.  Now if a <br/>
paladin is being dishonourable in my presence, I may choose to let him know <br/>
that as a priest of Rodcet Nife, he is out of line.  If he continues to be <br/>
dishonorable, so be it.  Rodcet Nife will deal with him when the time comes.<br/>
<br/>
I guess the point I&#39;m trying to make is this.  Everquest is a reality unto <br/>
itself.  It is not feudal Camelot, nor is it AD&D.  That may make it less <br/>
fun for people who want it to be one of those two things, but it just isn&#39;t <br/>
going to be that.  It&#39;s a real world where people live and die every day <br/>
fighting monsters.  It&#39;s a world where quests are available, taverns exist <br/>
and sell brews, tailors make patchwork armor, and Dorn eats newbies for <br/>
breakfast.  Norrath has it&#39;s own lore, it&#39;s own stories to tell, and it&#39;s <br/>
own language.  That language contains words like OOM, NP, buffs, SBH, and so <br/>
on.  It also contains language that can help another, like &quot;Go to Unrest at <br/>
about lvl 16 to get good exp as a cleric&quot;.  There is no difference between <br/>
asking where a good sword comes from or where to go to get exp and asking a <br/>
friend in RL if they know of a company that is hiring.  That person is just <br/>
asking you where they can go to make progress in the life they have created <br/>
in Norrath.  Tell them, help them out.  Make friends.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been lurking on this list for quite a while, and I have seen many <br/>
arguments about roleplaying.  Roleplaying is what you make it.  It&#39;s playing <br/>
YOUR role, not rules that are enforced for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s my 2 cents.<br/>
