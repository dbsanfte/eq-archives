&gt; On a newsgroup someone was saying how buggy Plane of Fear really is, a few<br/>
&gt; things people said it was suppose to be like that, like a spell that&#39;ll hit<br/>
&gt; you for like 1,000 dmg.  But this guy was saying a Lvl 1 Orge could go in<br/>
&gt; there and get by all these tough baddies and cause some major trains.  For<br/>
&gt; one I&#39;d like to know how a low lvl anything can get even close to this<br/>
&gt; place, luck?  But someone replied to the post and said it was true a low lvl<br/>
&gt; player could do that.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d love to see this place at least once, seen screen shots but pics are<br/>
&gt; nothing I want to see the real deal.<br/>
&gt; Also heard the lag for this place (I take it is bad) was as bad as<br/>
&gt; Lavastorm.  Since I haven&#39;t been to Lavastorm yet I wouldn&#39;t know, but if<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s as bad as Unrest the lag will have to suck.<br/>

&gt; &gt; i wouldn&#39;t consider going there till at least 40+...preferably 45+...and<br/>
&gt; in at<br/>
&gt; &gt; least 2-3 full, well-rounded groups.....nasty place, but it&#39;s loads of fun<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Yeah common for now, knowing Verant they&#39;ll change this one day.  They<br/>
&gt; might<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; not but who knows.  Anymore it seems like with every patch they make<br/>
&gt; another<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; item a lore or a No Drop item, they keep up with the No Drops and we<br/>
&gt; won&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; be able to drop, sell or trade anything.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; But anyways what lvl is the Plane of Fear?<br/>
