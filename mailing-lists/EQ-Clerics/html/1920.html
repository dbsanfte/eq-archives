<div id="ygrps-yiv-1592516041">I have to disagree on this one with ya Mik, at least from the standpoint of<br/>
being a High Elf Cleric.  Until you get several items in the mid 30s to mid 40s<br/>
(Plat Armband, Runed Mith Bracer), having a low strength makes you a liability<br/>
unless you always hunt with a group that you trust.  If you get overweight,<br/>
you&#39;re toast as you agi drops significantly.  Sure, you can start destroying<br/>
items and/or money that you&#39;ve looted, but until you&#39;ve gotten above 30, money<br/>
is a real issue (at least it was for me- gosh this seems like so long ago).  You<br/>
need to hold on to all you can.<br/>
<br/>
I really agree on putting the rest of your points into strength, especially as a<br/>
High Elf.  Humans have a decent Strength, so I&#39;d got agi here.  Dwarfs- you put<br/>
any more points into strength and I&#39;ll have to beat you over the head!  Agi here<br/>
too.  Halflings have great agility and dex, so I&#39;d have to say str (sta or chr<br/>
after that).  Erudites have need of some agi and strength, gnomes- I can<br/>
remember the starting stats on gnome, so no comment :(<br/>
<br/>
This wasn&#39;t the way I started out Ailamil, however.  I pumped my High Elf wisdom<br/>
up to all of 110 (yikes!), put points into str, agi, even 2 into int!  I still<br/>
have to replace a couple items, but I have 181 wisdom now, and 102 strenght.  I<br/>
still need the Paw and a couple of levels, then it&#39;s PoF time for me.  Only time<br/>
in recent memory that I&#39;ve needed more mana (since level 41) was when I was 40%<br/>
before the battle started- using the manastone, of course.<br/>
