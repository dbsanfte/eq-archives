<div id="ygrps-yiv-272232814">I come up with a couple of ideas that I could do that could probably<br/>
work well.  If you&#39;re adventurous, make your way into any high level<br/>
dungeon, Unrest or Cazic Thule would work well.  At 8th you could get<br/>
into Unrest somewhat easily, but Cazic would be difficult.  you&#39;d have<br/>
to run from the guards outside, then you&#39;d have to gate out, but you&#39;d<br/>
want to gate out anyway with my money-making idea.<br/>
<br/>
Basically, walk into a dungeon and advertise that you are going to buy<br/>
FS weapons.  You&#39;ll pay 3 plat for maces and hammers, and 2 plat for<br/>
swords and daggers.  These are relatively cheap prices, and people may<br/>
be willing to sell to you so they don&#39;t have to go to a merchant. This<br/>
requires an initial investment on your part of 20-30 plat.  Maybe you<br/>
could get an interest free loan from a high level friend. :)  As soon<br/>
as you are loaded down, you gate back to the bank (get a bind there,<br/>
first), and you make a tidy profit.  Wash/rinse/repeat.  Another way<br/>
is to offer to exchange copper/silver for 15 copper to 1 silver.  In<br/>
other words, they give you 15 copper, you give them 1 silver back.<br/>
A lot of people will probably go for this.  I had 500 copper in Cazic<br/>
one time, and the penny-pincher that I am, went all the way to bank to<br/>
claim my 5 gold!  Most people destroy copper after a certain level.<br/>
300 copper weighs about 10 pounds, and is just not worth carrying<br/>
around.  If they can exchange it, they probably will.  Using the math<br/>
(300/15)=20 silver that&#39;s 2 gold. you could *buy* 300 copper for 2 gp.<br/>
The profit here won&#39;t be great, but if you do it enough it will be.<br/>
<br/>
Another way to make money, is collect bone chips, and walk into<br/>
Nektulos forest (you&#39;re safe right near the zone), and sell 10 bone<br/>
chips for a plat.  Clerics can get bone chips easy enough.  Any place<br/>
where there are high level necros hanging out, they will want to buy<br/>
these.  The more the better.  Also, kill the pirahna fish in Rivervale<br/>
enough and you&#39;ll get lots of fish scales.  (I had 100 once), and sell<br/>
those to Druids for a tidy profit.  Spider silk is sought out by<br/>
wizards, too, and you can sell bat wings as well.  These are all some<br/>
ideas.<br/>
