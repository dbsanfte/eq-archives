<div id="ygrps-yiv-821078419">Dear Clerics, <br/>
  We all have Our own way of playing, Wheter we use Divine or we use Gate, We will either make or we wont personally am at Rathtear and when your fighting all the way across from the nearest divine is about as useless as trying to ask the monster to pls stop hitting you and Gate you would have a better chance by far fear the creature&gt;Then again if your being attacked by more than one NPC then gate is about useless and Divine you would have a better chance so its all about where and how you figh5t really<br/>
determines which one to use and the one person who said gate sucks in most situation like in cazic thule at 29 you get a AE fear spell that would be much more practicle to try and use in this situation and then try and gate but then again it all depends on your mana status.<br/>
