&gt; I got my testament of Vanear last night.  And what Martyn Adams says<br/>
&gt; is entirely true (I admit, I was a bit skeptical at first.)  I am<br/>
&gt; going to post this information to gamestats today.  You need not go to<br/>
&gt; Erudia at all to get this.  Indeed, just give Moodoro Finharn 2gp and<br/>
&gt; he will give you the book.  Then give him the 4gp and he will start<br/>
&gt; giving you playing cards....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Stats are +10 wis, +10 mana.<br/>
&gt; I think it&#39;s off-hand held only.  But I do know the Paw of Opolla(sp)<br/>
&gt; can be held in either hand.  And some brave clerics hold both for a<br/>
&gt; truly intense increase in wisdom.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>The Testament is off hand only and the paw can be held in either.  I<br/>
normally carry paw in main hand, testament in off hand but have three<br/>
hotkey slots set up (one for main hand, one for off hand, one for first<br/>
inventory slot) so I can click on my weapon, click on paw, click on<br/>
testament click on inventory slot to change to holding a weapon quickly.<br/>
Not that I solo that often but sometimes you do just need a weapon to<br/>
finish something off.<br/>
