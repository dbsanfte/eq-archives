<div id="ygrps-yiv-243104982">Money could be made valuable again. The merchant in solA that sells<br/>
tinkerers bags for 5kilo plat needs to do a couple things.<br/>
1. reduce the cost of the bag 3kilo plat seems more reasonable. (see<br/>
below why you would want to reduce the cost)<br/>
2. start selling Rubicite, make it fairly expensive I guess around<br/>
150-200pp per ac would be fair.<br/>
<br/>
Verdant armour should be for sale in erudin (at the moment the merchant<br/>
will only sell to GM&#39;s as I understand it).<br/>
Black iron for sale in kaladim.<br/>
Add some more store bought armour types.<br/>
<br/>
Add some more smithed & taylored armours (ie. add a vial of some sought<br/>
of mana from an enchanter, and some component and get some magic/bonus)<br/>
eg. imagine a ruby encrusted silvered/cromed/guilded/shiny breastplate<br/>
AC17 +?str/wis   (sure it would probably cost alot in components and<br/>
would very hard to smith, ie failures so even more expensive) ie. U<br/>
might combine a ruby, the vial, 2 sheets of steel, a mold, a flask of<br/>
water, a bar of enchanted silver/gold/electrum/platnium and a file.<br/>
Maybe introduce a spell &quot;Bless water&quot; make it so you need to get a flask<br/>
of &quot;holy water&quot; (that way no single class can singly corner the market<br/>
eg. enchanters).<br/>
Or maybe make it a 2 step process make first step might be to make gem<br/>
encrusted sheets<br/>
<br/>
Now as far as magic weapons go.<br/>
Add some pirate merchants in OOT, or the dwarven merchant in OOT or DE<br/>
in Neriak or a few all over the place. Lets add some more store bought<br/>
Magic weapons at the mo there is Combine and well balanced. Now if there<br/>
was more variety in store bought magic weapons, people wouldn&#39;t feel the<br/>
need to camp for a magic item. Item drops might become more the by<br/>
product of going into a dungeon, not the reason for going there.<br/>
<br/>
Also the price of steel plate needs to be reduced.<br/>
Basically if something is too expensive people will not buy it, think<br/>
about it if a twinker can spend a few hours and get a really decent<br/>
item, or spend a few hours to get enuf cash to buy an inferior item<br/>
which will they do. Chain is also too expensive. (imo chain should be<br/>
twice to 3 times the price of leather, and plate 2 to 4 times the price<br/>
of chain).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ouch, I ranted ... sorry<br/>

&gt; WARNING KINDA OFF TOPIC:<br/>
&gt; ************************<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I play a fantasy/medievel LARP &lt;NERO&gt; and this seems<br/>
&gt; to be the way with all the magic items in our game.<br/>
&gt; At lower levels, dagger, potions, etc.. are worth alot<br/>
&gt; to you, coin is very valuable.  As you progress you<br/>
&gt; are going on small quests and getting abundunce of<br/>
&gt; coin to gain levels, and few items.  As you progress<br/>
&gt; to higher level the magic items are whats the most<br/>
&gt; wanted.  Your sword can only be so good unless its<br/>
&gt; magical, the shield and armor is the same unless its<br/>
&gt; magical.  Everyone wants magic items, and cause you<br/>
&gt; have been adventuring so long, and are killing larger<br/>
&gt; creatures now you have an abundance of coin.<br/>
&gt; Items can only be traded for itmes, cause coin is a<br/>
&gt; common thing.  The way this can only be solved is that<br/>
&gt; the coin is used for something, to gain levels, its<br/>
&gt; turned in for exp.  In EQ the coin is worthless in<br/>
&gt; only regards to buying items.  Maybe if it was used to<br/>
&gt; buy entertainment, or to buy house, estates, etc..<br/>
&gt; than it would be needed.  They must make coin valuable<br/>
&gt; at all stages in level progression.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I didn&#39;t really camp until the last 5 levels or so<br/>
&gt; &gt; when I started wanting some of the items that I was<br/>
&gt; &gt; finally getting high enough level to get.   After a<br/>
&gt; &gt; while you find that the higher level you get the<br/>
&gt; &gt; less value platinum has and everything that you want<br/>
&gt; &gt; to have is either A) No-Drop, B) costs just an<br/>
&gt; &gt; outrageous amount of platinum (because plat is so<br/>
&gt; &gt; easy to come by at high levels) or C) the person who<br/>
&gt; &gt; has the item wants to trade it instead of selling it<br/>
&gt; &gt; (again because plat isn&#39;t worth that much compared<br/>
&gt; &gt; to the time spent getting items).   In the case of<br/>
&gt; &gt; C, you need to camp to get the items that the person<br/>
&gt; &gt; is willing to trade the item you want for... so you<br/>
&gt; &gt; either camp for that or you camp for the item you<br/>
&gt; &gt; actually want.. either way you are going to camp.<br/>
&gt; &gt; In the case of A, you have no choice because it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; No-Drop so nobody else can get it for you, and in<br/>
&gt; &gt; the case of B.. well you will be saving your pennies<br/>
&gt; &gt; a long long time.    So, I think that you will find<br/>
&gt; &gt; yourself camping in levels to come and you will<br/>
&gt; &gt; realize pretty quickly why people are complaining<br/>
&gt; &gt; about it =)<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I hope you are all successful.  Personally, I am<br/>
&gt; &gt; too impatient to camp for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; items, even if it it only takes an hour.  So if<br/>
&gt; &gt; your protest helps in that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; regard, I am sure it will benfit me as well.  My<br/>
&gt; &gt; approach is to just play<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the game, amass experience and wealth, and hope<br/>
&gt; &gt; that I can buy what I need.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Mind you , I&#39;m only 16th level now, so in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; future, I may need to camp for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; stuff.  But so far, I have not camped for a single<br/>
&gt; &gt; thing, I am happy with<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; what my character can and can&#39;t do, and have no<br/>
&gt; &gt; complaints about world<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; called Norrath. The only complaints I have I can<br/>
&gt; &gt; live with, and they mostly<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; have to do with the UI of the game and with GM<br/>
&gt; &gt; conduct.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Aye, but looking at it from your perspective you<br/>
&gt; &gt; could consider that if the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; sit-in is successful, it&#39;s possible that the 8<br/>
&gt; &gt; hour camps could be reduced<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; which would give you LESS time to sit around on<br/>
&gt; &gt; purpose (camping for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; items)...  =)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; It all depends on how you look at it...<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, I&#39;m taking this sit in from a different<br/>
&gt; &gt; perspective.  I only get a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; few<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hours of play time a week, and I think that I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; &gt; rather use it playing the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; game as opposed to sitting around.  I do enough<br/>
&gt; &gt; sitting around, what with<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; trying to find a group and all to play in.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; sure don&#39;t want to do it on<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; purpose.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Just my thought.<br/>
