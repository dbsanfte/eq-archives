<div id="ygrps-yiv-1743734806">i always feel like a bum when someone dies in my group..i try to let folks <br/>
know when i am low on mana...sometimes things are so nuts  you don&#39;t have <br/>
time to say anything....but sometimes....you just lose ppl i suppose....let <br/>
me ask this question.  sometimes...say an enchanter or someone without  alot <br/>
of HP, is doing the most damage and all the baddies are on him and he is <br/>
getting low..you go to heal him...and you fizzle a time or God forbid <br/>
twice...and he is down...then you lose him as a target..you got a second <br/>
there you can get him back up...but my targeting loses him...that drives me <br/>
nuts...anyone else have that problem?<br/>

&gt;Ya, you&#39;re right.  Just something in me felt guilty about leaving.  After<br/>
&gt;all, I was the group leader, and I had invited people in to the group.  But<br/>
&gt;next time, I will definately know better... famous last words...<br/>

&gt;Personally, I would have left that group...and fast. It was established in<br/>
&gt;the beginning that you had problems with teamwork (the loot thing). If I <br/>
&gt;see<br/>
&gt;that the group is not cooperating from the very start, I leave as quickly <br/>
&gt;as<br/>
&gt;I can. It&#39;s not worth dying over when a better group is probably 10 ft.<br/>
&gt;away. Granted, it&#39;s not always easy to find another group, I will take<br/>
&gt;soloing over dying because of somebody else&#39;s stupidity. At least if I die<br/>
&gt;solo, I know it was MY fault.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hi all,<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The following is just a rant. Nothing of substance, just me venting <br/>
&gt;about<br/>
&gt; &gt; last nites gameplay.  If you don&#39;t want to read it, feel free to skip.<br/>
