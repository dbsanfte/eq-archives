<div id="ygrps-yiv-75104092">Just an update on how it went last night from the newbie lvl 50 cleric ;)<br/>
<br/>
Well, I only died once and none of the tanks died.  The group was consisting<br/>
of 3 tanks and 2 clerics.  We had some good fighting/pulling and basically<br/>
it was a good raid.  I was unsure, and still is, on what my role as the<br/>
&quot;other&quot; cleric is.  The more experienced cleric in the group was rather<br/>
uncommunicative.  I basically buffed and kept the buffing on all the tanks,<br/>
and the clerics.  I cast out SH when I saw health going down drastically and<br/>
GH once in awhile. I did cast Naltron on all the tanks though...wasted alot<br/>
of money =/  I had like 20 peridot now Im down to 5<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone tell me if u use atone on any of these raids?  If so, just how do<br/>
u go about using it?  I mean do you heal, atone, heal, atone...just so that<br/>
the thing won&#39;t frenzy on you?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for all the helpful tips and advice =)</div>
