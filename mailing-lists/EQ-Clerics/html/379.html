<div id="ygrps-yiv-535465382">I just heard about this new Paladin only sword, Soul Fire.  Why does it seem<br/>
like Paladin&#39;s and other classes get weapons thats made just for that class<br/>
and Cleric&#39;s does not have anything like that?  If they do I&#39;ve never heard<br/>
of them, but it would be nice to have a mace or hammer thats made just for<br/>
us Cleric&#39;s or even armor made just for us.  What does everyone think about<br/>
that?<br/>
