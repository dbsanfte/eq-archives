<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-839797973">I am only a level 18 cleric and have been fighting the crows in West Karana<br/>
and I am not familiar being charmed as of yet and I guess I am thankful I<br/>
have not been charmed but my question is? Is charm an area affect? Does the<br/>
evil eye, or whatever cast it on all the party members at once or one at a<br/>
time? If one at a time, is it possible to remove some of the spells in your<br/>
slot before the charm effect hits you?<br/>
Also, as I am advancing toward level 20, I will only be able to take the<br/>
crows for two more levels and will have to move on. I have read many<br/>
messages of places to go, many do not like Befallen or Unrest, so are there<br/>
any suggestions of other possible places? Many times I find I am solo,<br/>
especially during the week.Has anyone done the skeletons etc, at the ruins<br/>
in West Karana and could I possibly solo there?Healingsun, Solusek Ro</div>
