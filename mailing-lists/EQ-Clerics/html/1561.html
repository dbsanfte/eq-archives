<div id="ygrps-yiv-1414973053">Hello all, <br/>
<br/>
I barely got lvl 9 last night (Woo Hoo!), and can&#39;t figure out any good<br/>
spots to hunt.  It seems that everywhere I&#39;ve been has a lot of greens and<br/>
yellows, or some blues hanging around with a bunch of yellows/reds.<br/>
<br/>
Any advice on where a young cleric can get some experience.  I&#39;m tired of<br/>
running for the zone when those Legionnaires come to the aide of their cent<br/>
counterparts.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure you all remember getting 9th, but I don&#39;t know if you felt the<br/>
disappointment, that I did, in the spells that we got.  I was all psyched to<br/>
get root and maybe soothe, but what else is there that works well?  I&#39;m<br/>
still using furor as my DD spell.  Seems pretty weak compared to a 9th level<br/>
Druid&#39;s &quot;ignite&quot; spell that took a cent out in 2 casts.  I can hit em 4 or 5<br/>
times with furor and still have to duke it out for a while.  Any<br/>
encouragement out there?<br/>
