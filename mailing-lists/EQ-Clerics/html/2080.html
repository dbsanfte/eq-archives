<div id="ygrps-yiv-659528741">1) Fiery Avenger is probably what Aradune was wielding. Which is not yet set<br/>
to Paladin only.<br/>
<br/>
2) The &quot;camping the binding point&quot; were NOT GM characters. They were spawned<br/>
NPCs that stayed in one spot (The dark elves in Rivervale) I suspect the<br/>
same of those creatures that were &quot;camping the zoning point&quot; they were<br/>
pulled there by someone they were killing, and people kept coming through<br/>
oftne enough they never wandered back to their spawn point.<br/>
<br/>
Not ALL of the NPCs in the War (in fact most of them weren&#39;t) were run by<br/>
player GM-types.<br/>

&gt;I can&#39;t believe the screen shot I saw on www.eqvault.com it was a pic of<br/>
&gt;Brad&#39;s character dead.  It wasn&#39;t the being dead part I couldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;believe but<br/>
&gt;what it was he had in his hand.  Now remember his character is a<br/>
&gt;Ranger, pic<br/>
&gt;shows him wearing the new Ranger armor but in his hand was the SoulFire<br/>
&gt;which is a Pally only weapon.  Can we say cheating?  Now if one of us tried<br/>
&gt;that crap we&#39;d get banned from the game but he can wield a Pally<br/>
&gt;only weapon<br/>
&gt;when he&#39;s a Ranger?<br/>
&gt;That shows me the ppl like Brad and GM can get away with anything in the<br/>
&gt;game.  I also read on the EQ newsgroup that last Sunday the night of the<br/>
&gt;events that the GM&#39;s were doing things that they&#39;ve told players not to do<br/>
&gt;and if they did they&#39;d get banned for it.  Heard they were camping at zone<br/>
&gt;points waiting for a player to zone over and kill them and also camping<br/>
&gt;binding points and killing someone over and over everytime he/she died and<br/>
&gt;came back at their bind point till they got ticked and pulled the plug on<br/>
&gt;their modems.  If we would do that junk we&#39;d get banned for it.<br/>
&gt;Can&#39;t wait to hear what Brad has to say about him wielding a SoulFire.<br/>
