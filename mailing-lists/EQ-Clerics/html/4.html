<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1321947849">Hi everyone! It&#39;s really nice to have this kind of mailing list for the most important class of the game. No other class goes above us as a party member. We rock!<br/>
<br/>
And now to the subject...<br/>
I wonder what all of you clerics of Norrath think about different undead zones around. I myself have only been in Estate of Unrest and Befallen. By far Estate of Unrest is a lot better place to hunt IMHO. I don&#39;t know maybe i just had very bad luck but the two days i were there were horrible. I died constantly because at first i did not have the keys and was left behind doors since everyone was so impatient going around and second when i had the keys my party went there in a rush and it ended to my death. Took many deaths to finally drag my corpse out of that unholy dungeon. Guess i just didn&#39;t meet the right people ( (Are the races in Antonica always like that?). Now i am back at Faydwer and got back the XP i lost in Befallen mostly by hunting in Unrest. After that experience i have to say that i really LOVE Unrest. Never going back to Befallen without a decent party that also thinks about the healers of the party.<br/>
<br/>
I know there is also The Castle Mistmoore in Faydwer but people say that in order to succeed in that place you need to have full party of at least lvl 18 players. I&#39;d like to hear about this from you people that have been there.<br/>
