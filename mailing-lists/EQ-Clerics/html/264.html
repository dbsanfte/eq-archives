Ok...let me try to explain very very simply =)<br/>
<br/>
When you specialize in a skill, that is completely seperate from your normal <br/>
skill, (EX. Alteration). My cleric isnt high enough to specialize, but I <br/>
have a level 25 magician who has specialized in both Conjuration and <br/>
Evocation. I use Conjuration alot more, so I will let that one go past the <br/>
50 mark. Once the SPECIALIZATION skill goes over 50, that ONE will be the <br/>
skill you master at...the other skills that you specialize will be capped at <br/>
50. That does not mean that your actual skill in Conjuration or any other <br/>
skill will stop moving up. Look at Specialization as another skill entirely.<br/>
<br/>
Once you are able to specialize (I beleive you have to be level 30 to do <br/>
that as a Cleric) you will need to go to your guild trainer, and put ONE <br/>
point in whatever skill you want to specialize in. As a cleric, I will want <br/>
to do Alteration, so I use less mana when I heal, cast faster, and with less <br/>
interruptions.  Once you have ONE POINT in there, it will go up as you play <br/>
in EQ. You will see when it goes up with a message like, Your specialization <br/>
(Conjuration) has increased! (25) or whatever you have in that skill. By the <br/>
time you are level 30, your skill in Alteration is already going to rock, <br/>
(about 150 or so).  So, whatever skills you have, they will keep rising, the <br/>
only thing that will stop rising, is if you specialize in more than one <br/>
skill, and one of them has gone over 50 skill. Everything will keep going <br/>
up, until you hit 50 in specialize, and the one that went over 50 first, <br/>
will keep rising. (Phew, I hope I didnt confuzzle you more)<br/>
<br/>
Specialization Alteration and Alteration are TWO different skills. Both will <br/>
keep going up =)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hope this clarifies it!<br/>

&gt;I must be missing a very basic piece of information or just suffering from<br/>
&gt;brain fart.  Assume that I don&#39;t have a clue and am probably talking about<br/>
&gt;something different than what YOU mean.  :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m a lvl 13 cleric.  Abjuration, alteration, evocation are AT LEAST at<br/>
&gt;skill lvl 60, and probably divination and conjuration are pretty high as<br/>
&gt;well.  How can that be explained?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I haven&#39;t noticed any better casting ability in any of my spells.  How can<br/>
&gt;that be explained?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If I HAVE specialized, how can I tell which one it is?(they went over 50<br/>
&gt;about 3 weeks ago...I don&#39;t have a clue which was first).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If I HAVEN&#39;T specialized, how do I do it?<br/>
&gt;If I HAVEN&#39;T specialized, what happens to the other 2-4 spell classes that<br/>
&gt;have already gone over 50?  Do they stay at 65, or do they drop back down?<br/>

&gt; &gt; You can specialize in all spell types.  But, once one reaches 51 the <br/>
&gt;rest<br/>
&gt; &gt; will cap at 50, and the skill that reached 51 first will keep <br/>
&gt;increasing.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I am level 30 I trained as much as I could in alteration and I havent<br/>
&gt; &gt; touched the other specialization skills, I want to make sure my <br/>
&gt;specialize<br/>
&gt; &gt; in alt. is the first to hit 51<br/>
