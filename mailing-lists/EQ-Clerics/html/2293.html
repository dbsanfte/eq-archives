<div id="ygrps-yiv-373766857">Well, there are tons of ways to make money at younger<br/>
levels!  You can either hunt the better loot areas or<br/>
you can be a wandering merchant.  You just have to<br/>
give up a little bit of hunting time and a lot of<br/>
running back and forth to do it.<br/>
<br/>
EXAMPLES:<br/>
<br/>
Take a few plat with you (lets just say 9 for<br/>
starters)<br/>
Go to unrest or cazic thule and hang in the zone area.<br/>
 Auction off that you are buying fine steel for 3pp<br/>
each.  Most people hunting these areas end up with an<br/>
over abundance of fine steel and will sell it just to<br/>
get rid of the weight while still making a few plat. <br/>
Take this to the nearest town and sell.  You should<br/>
get approximately 5pp each (depending on your charisma<br/>
of course)  3 fine steel items x 5 pp each equals out<br/>
to about 15pp.  Go back in and advertise again.  This<br/>
time you can buy 5 items at 3pp each.  Wash rinse<br/>
repeat!  Two trips and you already doubled your plat.<br/>
<br/>
Another way is to become a wandering banker.  Offer to<br/>
exchange your gold and plat for someone&#39;s copper and<br/>
silver (charge a small amount of course!).<br/>
<br/>
Just a few ideas, I know they work but have never<br/>
tried them since I would rather hunt =)<br/>

&gt; Just curious, but how did you afford all this stuff<br/>
&gt; at L14 and still <br/>
&gt; be able to do jewlcraft?  I couldn&#39;t even afford to<br/>
&gt; buy all my spells <br/>
&gt; at L14 with any of my characters (have 3 spell<br/>
&gt; casters over L14), I <br/>
&gt; must be missing something.<br/>
