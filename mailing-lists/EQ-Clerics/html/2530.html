<div id="ygrps-yiv-1457919308">Problem with Wave of Fear is that it is AE from the caster out (like the<br/>
Word of Pain series). While Inspire Fear can be cast at a much greater<br/>
distance on a single target. Just depends on what you want to do. Other than<br/>
that the only difference is 10 mana points. I rely upon Inspire Fear when I<br/>
get in over my head when soloing.<br/>

&gt; I just made 24, and just bought my spells<br/>
&gt; greater healing<br/>
&gt; bravery<br/>
&gt; wave of fear<br/>
&gt; counteract poison<br/>
&gt; symbol of Ryltan (and 20 bloodstones)<br/>
&gt; dismiss undead<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I didn&#39;t buy hammer of striking (what a joke), and I didn&#39;t buy<br/>
&gt; instill fear.  Reason being I never used fear.  But my question is:<br/>
&gt; Is instill fear worth buying?  Is there some marvelous tactic using<br/>
&gt; the fear spells that I&#39;m not familiar with?  I figured wave of fear<br/>
&gt; would be really, really handy, but instill fear was kind of worthless<br/>
&gt; compared to it, if I understand them correctly.  Can someone shed<br/>
&gt; some light?<br/>
