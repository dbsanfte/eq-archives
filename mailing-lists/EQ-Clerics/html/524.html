<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1536329493">Yes- I do agree with a lot of the messages. Nothing is ever perfect, and I <br/>
chose to gripe about what was not perfect. Everquest is a great game besides <br/>
the events I had to endure.  <br/>
Perhaps I did venture with some bad people- I have learned from the earlier <br/>
posts that there are some great people out there in EQ. Perhaps I just have <br/>
the worse luck in the world when I am grouping. <br/>
 I am sorry to place my anger on EQ on this mailing list. I just wish people <br/>
wouldnt think about reaching that next level so much- but I have learned from <br/>
the earlier posts that it is not true. <br/>
 I must have the worse luck on meeting people on the two servers I mainly <br/>
play!! Sorry everyone :) igore my earlier posts :)<br/>
