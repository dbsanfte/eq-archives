<b>Subject:</b> Re: game enhancements maybe change for cleric quests? =) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-461826802">i hope that one enhancement is that the cleric armor is no longer<br/>
nodrop.....was able to get the bp &lt;which is called &quot;chestplate of the<br/>
constant&quot;....&gt; and check the stats &lt;which are ac18, stam 8, and 5vs magic for<br/>
those that are curious&gt; and it&#39;s magic, lore, AND nodrop....why is ours nodrop?<br/>
all the other classes&#39; armor isn&#39;t....the compos are, just like ours, but the<br/>
finished product isn&#39;t....that&#39;s bull imho....<br/>
<br/>
o and btw, for those of you curise, the color is gold...not like the gold<br/>
efreeti boots, but more of a goldish color and not as yellow....very nice<br/>
looking again imho<br/>
<br/>
enough ranting for now (:<br/>

&gt; *General Enhancements*<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; - If a user is killed due to self-inflicted spell or melee damage,<br/>
&gt; experience will be lost.<br/>
&gt; - When using a levitation spell, players are now vulnerable to attack from<br/>
&gt; both waterbound and landbound creatures.<br/>
&gt; - A number of enhancements have been made to balance the class specific<br/>
&gt; armor quests implemented last week.<br/>
&gt; - A bug was resolved which resulted in a quest reward not being given<br/>
&gt; approximately 1 percent of the time. - This has been fixed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ***************<br/>
&gt; Hopefully this means a decrease in spawn time!!!   Not sure if game is back<br/>
&gt; up from patch yet... but if anyone confirms what &quot;A number of enhancements<br/>
&gt; have been made to balance the class specific armor quests implemented last<br/>
&gt; week&quot; means specifically, I would love to know!<br/>
