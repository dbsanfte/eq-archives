<div id="ygrps-yiv-53201348">I have never heard of the distance thing before. I have been far away from<br/>
the kill sometimes and still have gotten experience. Medding while my Ranger<br/>
friend impatiently tracks something down and kills it.<br/>
<br/>
They may have been green but the were definitely the same &quot;con&quot; to both of<br/>
us. As they should be, because &quot;con&quot; is a level distinction. I believe.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the thought though.<br/>

Maybe you were not close enough to the legionnaire when it was killed.<br/>
There is only so much distance away you can be from the group and still get<br/>
experience.  Was the Orc blue for the both of you?  If it was green that<br/>
might explain you both not getting experience...<br/>
<br/>
Just a couple thoughts...<br/>
