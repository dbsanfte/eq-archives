<div id="ygrps-yiv-1940248248">well are there any ways to increase are framerate or get patches which will <br/>
emhance are cards to keep up and handle the frame rates. I have a voodoo <br/>
banshee which i hate and was wondering if a voodoo 3 3000 is alot better. I <br/>
do not know much about graphic cards but if i can get some review saying <br/>
that voodoo 3 is way way better then my banshee on handleing stuff i might <br/>
just buy it.<br/>
<br/>
thx for the info on lag so far<br/>
