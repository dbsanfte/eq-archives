I have been looking for Jovan the Fervent in Highpass hold. No luck yet.<br/>
Has anyone seen him?<br/>
<br/>
I have also been searching in Kithicor for the burned down hut. I found two<br/>
of them so far, but no icon/ingots. Near one hut were four shadowed men. I<br/>
and another cleric died trying to kill them, thinking that maybe one of<br/>
them has a part.<br/>
<br/>
Also, has anyone found the icon in Lake Rathe that belongs to the Reliant?<br/>
