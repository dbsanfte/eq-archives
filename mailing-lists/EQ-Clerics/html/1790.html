<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-604640872">Gynok&#39;s place holder spawns at the zone and does a shout to the whole<br/>
zone, you will see a giant rat shouts &quot;some garbage about waking me or<br/>
something&quot; it then wanders thru 1st level, then 2nd level then 3rd<br/>
level. So unless the spot is camped the only way be sure is to go thru<br/>
and kill anything that seems to be moving, and since the place holder<br/>
may have made it to his final resting place, everything on the third<br/>
floor, then go back up and camp the zone killing everything that spawns<br/>
and does a shout.<br/>
<br/>
The place holder can be anything that spawns in Befallen, but I have<br/>
seen/heard Giant rats, putrid skeles, a skeleton and ghouls.<br/>

&gt; Does anyone know for certain what or where Gynok&#39;s placeholder is on<br/>
&gt; 3rd floor?  I sat inside zone entrance to Befallen killing everything<br/>
&gt; that spawned where Gynok is supposed to spawn for 4 hours one night<br/>
&gt; and he never spawned in all that time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; All I can say is UGH I hate camping =)<br/>
