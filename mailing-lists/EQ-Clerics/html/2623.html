<div id="ygrps-yiv-986679082">Symbol line of spells adds to the persons maximum HP total.  The top end one<br/>
is Symbol of Naltron, which adds up to 400hps I guess (maybe more, can&#39;t<br/>
remember).  This will make complete heal more effecient on your tanks, as<br/>
your 50th lvl warrior will probably have over 3000hps, when you cheal him<br/>
for 400 mana, you get a pretty good ratio.<br/>
<br/>
Skin Like Nature (SLN) is the druid version of Resolution basically, but<br/>
it&#39;s apparently better as it adds more HPs and rumors of a small regen<br/>
effect.  Work out with your druid how he wants to do his buffing.  I always<br/>
through resolution on everyone, it&#39;s cheap and helps out.  On tanks, I put<br/>
resolution, shield of words, and symbol spell (usually pinzarn as it&#39;s<br/>
cheaper 1pp per cast, naltron is better, but costs 10pp, get&#39;s expensive).<br/>
Depending on situation, I will also throw on resistance debuffs, but usually<br/>
only for big events as their duration is mediocre at best...<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps...<br/>

Hello,<br/>
<br/>
My RL friend who has a lvl 50 cleric is going to go on a 1 month vacation.<br/>
She has asked me to play her cleric for our guild when it&#39;s needed.  The<br/>
highest I&#39;ve ever gotten a cleric to is lvl 28.  Last night was the first<br/>
time I ever played a lvl 50 cleric and I have to admit it was like being<br/>
toss into the water without knowing how to swim.  We were doing a dragon run<br/>
of all things.  Anyway, the healing part I think I gotten down...I mainly<br/>
just cast superior heals...the time needed to cast a CH was just too nerve<br/>
racking for me.  I was told to cast panzia (sp?) symbol on caster and nalton<br/>
(sp?) on tanks (why that is so...I didn&#39;t bothered to ask...was a bit too<br/>
busy trying to figured out other stuff).  If there is a druid around then do<br/>
most clerics not cast Reso and AoF?  Most tanks were asking for SLN...were<br/>
they trying to split buff duty between druid/shaman/clerics?  Anyway, can<br/>
any lvl 49+ clerics out there give out advise on what you normally do in<br/>
highly stressful combat situation with multi groups going on.  Thanks a<br/>
bunch.<br/>
<br/>
I died like 5 times last nite...hope that wasn&#39;t too unusual.<br/>
