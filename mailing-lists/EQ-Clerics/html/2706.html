<div id="ygrps-yiv-83230102">Welcome to our list, Charlemagne.  I think everyone will agree that it is<br/>
not only the absolute best cleric resource in conjunction with our (Rayne&#39;s)<br/>
website, but is the best all around for learning strategies, tips, info on<br/>
different classes, armor, weapons, etc.  We have some of the most talented<br/>
and skilled players in all EQ right here, and I hope you enjoy your time<br/>
with us.  I know I get better and better each day at my cleric profession<br/>
because of the folks who are here providing info.<br/>
<br/>
Again..hail and well met.<br/>

&gt; Hail and Well Met<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am a new member to this list nd just wanted to say hello to everyone. I<br/>
hope to learn much from this list and gain friendships from others on it.<br/>
Perhaps even grouping with some in the Future. I play on the a Paladin<br/>
mainly myself but am the Guildmaster of the new guild Family of Friends<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.com/onlineguild/">http://www.geocities.com/onlineguild/</a> and make it my business to know about<br/>
all the different aspects of the game to help my fellow guildmates. Family<br/>
of Friends is currently recruiting and we have a membership application area<br/>
on our web site for potential recruits. Family of Friends resides on the<br/>
Bertoxxulous server. If nothing else there are two very useful links for<br/>
online gamers in general on our links page.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ...And Justice For All<br/>
