<div id="ygrps-yiv-1499427134">Yep yep Bree, I agree.  Based on what I have heard about the stats on this<br/>
new cleric armor, I&#39;ll go for Fear armor any day.  Plus, the excitement and<br/>
hunting in Fear is a heck of a lot more fun for me than sitting and camping<br/>
waiting for a spawn and running endlessly all over the dang game.<br/>

&gt; I prefer the excitement of fear to running around aimlessly anyday.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I went to fear for the first time this past weekend, and even though I<br/>
died<br/>
&gt; 7 times in 2 days, I had a blast. I even got boots out of the<br/>
deal.(granted<br/>
&gt; efreeti boots are better, but I was wearing charred, so they are better<br/>
than<br/>
&gt; what I had)  The game has gotten kind of boring as of late and the plane<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; fear adds a new and exciting twist to my playtime, I can&#39;t wait to go back<br/>
&gt; this weekend again.(no wonder I am still level 47, hehe)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I guess from my standpoint I can either, try and complete these quests<br/>
which<br/>
&gt; gets me no experience at all, with no idea of what I will recieve OR I can<br/>
&gt; get XP in Lguk or SolB all week long, so I have a nice buffer for going to<br/>
&gt; fear on the weekends and potential for getting armor that I already know<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; Whoop daddy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just my thoughts once again,<br/>
