<div id="ygrps-yiv-1826306729">You definitely got a better deal &lt;G&gt; On Fennin Ro, a guild member bought a <br/>
SSoL for 35PP. Now that I created my little cleric (shes level 8!) she is <br/>
carrying that weapon. Damage isnt all that hot, but boy, its great getting <br/>
cleansed a second after getting diseased by a mummy =)<br/>
<br/>
Hehee!<br/>

The SSoL is a funny thing. It is probably worth more than it seems. Similar<br/>
weapons for pure casters (e.g. Water Crystal staff) I&#39;ve seen selling for<br/>
100pp+. The SSoL is basically a mediocre weapon, but with a pretty useful<br/>
effect. Many clerics cannot do the quest (or don&#39;t want to spend time<br/>
building faction). To them, it may be fairly desirable.<br/>
<br/>
I traded my first one to a lvl 30 Teir&#39;dal cleric in return for a pair of<br/>
crested spaulders (AC11, +6sta), and I think I got the better deal. So I<br/>
would say: make your way over to East Commons or Nektulos and you may get a<br/>
good price.<br/>

 &gt; Second: I know that prices very greatly from server to<br/>
 &gt; server, but what<br/>
 &gt; sort of price range am I looking at if I want to sell my<br/>
 &gt; shinig star of<br/>
 &gt; light mace? around 20pp, around 100pp?? I really have no idea, and<br/>
 &gt; since I am a broke cleric(is there another kind) I would like to get a<br/>
 &gt; proper amount of money for it.<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; All thoughts would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; Thanks!<br/>
