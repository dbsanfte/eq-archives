<b>Subject:</b> Re: Yield Policy <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1897945474">I think some very valid points have been made concerning Brad&#39;s proposed<br/>
yield policy.  And I want to complement the post reminding everyone that<br/>
this IS only a game, and this list is not for flaming or personally<br/>
attacking each other, simply because we have differing opinions.  I am the<br/>
moderator for another cleric list, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:EQ_Clerics@onelist.com">EQ_Clerics@onelist.com</a> and the peeps on<br/>
this list are simply wonderful.   Everyone respects each other&#39;s right to<br/>
their opinion, even though there are a lot of differing views, and it&#39;s<br/>
quite fun and interesting.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think I have misrepresented the case of higher level players such as<br/>
myself.  Many of us don&#39;t have certain items we have to camp where although<br/>
the mobs don&#39;t give us exp anymore, can still kill us if things turn bad.<br/>
We had our level 50 monk die twice yesterday in MM castle from a swarm of<br/>
greenies, and once we all had to evac when things got really ugly.  So it&#39;s<br/>
really not completely safe for us, even tho we aren&#39;t getting exp.  And I<br/>
don&#39;t think we should not be able to get those items anymore and have to<br/>
yield to the lower levels who do get exp. In my opinion, reverse<br/>
discrimination is just as bad as discrimination.  You are still penalizing<br/>
one group over another regardless of how you look at it.<br/>
<br/>
I personally abhor players who because of their level think they can bully<br/>
their way in to take over a camp spot.  I also object to players who camp<br/>
spots for days to get all their guildmates that item, or to sell them either<br/>
IG or on ebay.  Howver, I think petitioning GMs is the way to deal with<br/>
these peeps, or sending feedback to Verant, rather than implementing<br/>
game-wide policy that so adversely impacts one group of players over<br/>
another.<br/>
<br/>
And just remember, you lower levels today who are cheering this policy will,<br/>
one day, fall into the higher level group, and I assure you that your<br/>
feelings will change when you find it is YOUR ox that is being gored.  My<br/>
only point has always been and still is.....policy should be fair and treat<br/>
everyone the same.  No discrimination or reverse discrimination against ANY<br/>
one group.  Find another way to deal with the problem and the jerks who have<br/>
created it.  Don&#39;t penalize the responsible, mature players as well because<br/>
you eventually will run them out of the game, and the only thing you will<br/>
have left ARE the jerks.<br/>
