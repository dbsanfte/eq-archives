<div id="ygrps-yiv-1361844201">I have seen very very few GOOD clerics on the nameless right now. I am <br/>
currently lv 28 and i ony know of about 6 to about 10 GOOD clerics, and i <br/>
KNOW there are more groups then that. A lot of the one&#39;s i&#39;ve seen have been <br/>
nuker clerics that i hate so much. So if your a cleric on Nameless, have you <br/>
witnessed thes ame thing?<br/>
