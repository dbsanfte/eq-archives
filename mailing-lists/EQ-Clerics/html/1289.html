<div id="ygrps-yiv-855796087">What I think should be forced is not the fact if you are camping for an item<br/>
and you get no exp for the kill and me and my group comes along I shouldn&#39;t<br/>
have the right to say &quot;OK buddy move along&quot; but it should be forced that you<br/>
have to share, you get your turn then me and my group, then you and then me<br/>
and my group, etc.....<br/>
I have camped in Crush Bone for the Shiny Brass Shield before and watched a<br/>
lvl 20 wizard EVERYTIME the Trainer spawned he&#39;d jump up and blast him.  The<br/>
wizard gave no one a chance to kill the trainer.  Even when someone came up<br/>
and said &quot;I got the next Trainer!&quot; the wizard would laugh and go &quot;If you<br/>
think you can&quot; or something like that.<br/>
So instade of getting banned for not yielding it should be banned after 3<br/>
warnings of not sharing the spawn.  I know thats what Mik and Mystix are<br/>
saying that we should be able to share the spawn but how many ppl do you<br/>
know that truely shares them?  I&#39;ve seen and heard about many players that<br/>
would not share.  But in away it should be &quot;first come first served&quot; but not<br/>
to the point of &quot;We were here first, it&#39;s our camp now go away&quot; it should be<br/>
they were there first they get the first shot at the spawn but once they had<br/>
their kill and no loot then it&#39;s back to the end of the line to let the next<br/>
person have a chance.<br/>
But to me Brad needs to changing it from Yield Policy to Sharing Policy.<br/>
