First I would like to say I have no intentions of &quot;flaming&quot; anyone here. [warning long]<br/>
I would also like to again state the fact the I realize in such a large and diverse world as the one we live in there will obviously be those who do share the same feelings I do and that there might even be many who are strongly opposed to my goals.  I accept this fact of life and move on, for I also believe that in order to successfully accomplish a goal that is worth anything, one must meet with opposition.<br/>
<br/>
Below are my responses to the respective comments:<br/>
<br/>
Ya know, the monks did this already last week about Feign Death, as far as I could see it didn&#39;t make a damn bit of difference.  Don&#39;t get me wrong Verant irriates me more than you know, but in my opinion clerics as far from the ones who should be complaining.  Look at the poor paladins for christ sake, now there&#39;s a class that needs help.<br/>
Have you all taken the time to notice that our quest armor had stats to it, perhaps that is why the AC is not as high as ruby.(I know the stats suck) but the AC is better than a BS tunic and Gator legs which I have been wearing for over 10 levels.<br/>
<br/>
-I have spent a great deal of time going over the current situation of the Cleric class and the equipment they are provided.  There are 2 distinctly different types of Clerics (in all honesty there are many more than that).  One plays the class like they would play a pure (*read &quot;intelligence-based&quot;) caster--by casting spells and medding back up more mana to cast more spells, and when solo they simply root/nuke their opponents. The other plays what I refer to as a &quot;classic&quot; Cleric, where one believes that the should take advantage of their ability to wear heavy armor that provides them with great protection.  This type of Cleric also believes there is more to playing than just medding/healing.  Neither of the two types is wrong.  Neither of them is right.  We all play how we wish and what &quot;role&quot; we wish to fulfill.  What I wish to do is provide the Cleric class that choice.  The ability to play what they wish, and in the &quot;classic&quot; sense be able to have the protection that they are supposed to have.  I am trying to provide people with choice and opportunity.  This is the exact reason why I have not even mentioned (and at this point never will mention) trying to change the bonus stats on the Cleric armor.  I feel that is a choice that should be left up to the player.  The reason behind all the effort that myself and many others are putting into this is to give us choice.  A very valuable asset that Verant has seemingly not allowed us to have <br/>
(Note:  I will acknowledge at this point that there are quite a few rare items that provide good AC, but as most are all above lv40+ and this sit-in pertains only to the class-specific replacements for Rubicite, I am going to avoid that topic.  Please respect my decision in this matter as I am trying to keep the focus of the matter realistic.  Thank you) <br/>

My only request would be that they give a wisdom stat to some of the pieces.<br/>
anyway, when I was at the monk one,  not purposely I was trying to kill guards,  the whole zone crashed, almost got me killed(that would have been fun).  After everyone left(the monks) Aradune made an appearance in West freeport Where he cautiously answered a few questions, not about the monks of course.<br/>
I think a show of force is great, I probably won&#39;t paticipate as I don&#39;t really have a problem with the armor. If your point was to get wisdom stats I would say cool, but verant is not gonna budge on that.  There was rumor that they would add wisdom to the legs, then there was one rumor that they would add wisdom to the BP, so I&#39;m not holding my breath.<br/>
Yes cleric armor is hard to get I have only 2 pieces some of it I am not going to bother with, paladin armor is much harder and more expensive to get.  Besides the fact that their class sucks after lvl 40 they are also getting a bum deal on the armor.  Don&#39;t get me wrong one of my best friends is a pally, he is so frustrated with his class and verant will do nothing about it.  Aradunes direct quote &quot; I think paladin&#39;s are great, my other character is a paladin&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In regards to the Paladin armor (as I have received many comments about this class), I have never played a Paladin past lvl 4.  I cannot speak from personal experience.  If there are any Paladins out there who feel they understand the Paladin class and in particular the Armor of Ro, please contact me at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:clericsitin@...">clericsitin@...</a> .  Please realize though that I suggest you have reasonable communications skills and that you present yourself in a polite manner (some of the emails..about 3, that I have received have been quite...crude to say the least).<br/>
I have made observations about the Paladin class (and more specifically the Armor of Ro).  It has come to my attention that many things about the Paladin quests do not require mindless waiting, but in fact many of the items you must obtain are not even no drop.  Now admittedly, the Blacksmithing part was creative if not tedious (but I believe considering the level you need to acquire the items that becoming a Master Smith cannot be so difficult).  As well, many have stated that the required faction has been lowered in order to make the quests easier to complete.  I do have a great deal of sympathy for the Paladins, but as their armor is actually worth it (the AC is excellent after that patch, the stats are incredible..+14 wis and Clerics only get +10...along with the fact that they provide more of everything else as well, saves +10, str, dex, sta all good..4, 6, 6 respectively) My sympathies do not extend very far.  I would not mind having to complete something similar to the paladin&#39;s quest, at least then I am not mindless waiting for something to spawn and I might actually be getting xp if I do have to wait (please keep in mind that almost all the Cleric quest items appear on MoBs in places where in order to be high enough level to defeat it then the other MOBs will not give you xp).  It is just very hard for me to feel sorry for the Paladins given the fact that I have not played one, and that there are is actually good enough to wear.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Let me put it this way, clerics have More AC than casters and most druids.  Clerics have l Less AC than tanks. my AC is usually between 700 and 741, my tanks AC (ranger and pally) is between 750 and 800 or so(monks and warriors I believe are much higher).  Should we have the same AC as a tank, WE are not tanks. I think we got it damn good as it is. Hell I made it to level 50 without a problem.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am not sure about what you are wearing vs. what your tanks are wearing, but I can almost guarantee that either your tanks are not equiped for AC or you are not equiped to maximize wisdom.  Sorry if I&#39;m ignorant here, but those numbers just seem out of place of everthing I&#39;ve seen.  Also, try and remember what those numbers were like in the level 30 range as that is where the Class-only armor really applies.<br/>
I am happy you made it to level 50 without any problems, many have, but I am not trying to ease any problems.  I just wish to make the game a more interesting one.<br/>
<br/>
As for the Cleric-only armor, I will quote Pirmin Nimblefoot when I say, &quot;I believe Verant has honestly confused the terms, &#39;hard&#39; and &#39;time-consuming&#39; leaving us with little choice but to consume time&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
It can always be said that there is much to be done, but it can only be realized if someone steps forward to try.  <br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
