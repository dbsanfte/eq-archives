<div id="ygrps-yiv-521187993">I cross posted this as soon as I got it so I am sure the statement was made<br/>
this week.  I can only say that I am optimistic enough to believe that what<br/>
we did at that sit-in was recognized and taken under consideration.<br/>
<br/>
I am not sure how many of you were at the sit-in but the great majority of<br/>
clerics there were very well behaved in spite of the constant criticisms and<br/>
slams that we were getting from others.   I can almost assure you that if we<br/>
had been on a PvP server that all of us would have been attacked for sure.<br/>
I was really proud of those that were there and of the patience and attitude<br/>
they showed.<br/>

&gt; My Question is when did you see this posted and are you sure they are<br/>
&gt; referring to Quest armor?  With this last patch they made the drop rate of<br/>
&gt; class specific armor in the Planes more frequent.  Just don&#39;t want anyone<br/>
