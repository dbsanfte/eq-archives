<div id="ygrps-yiv-2027688281">I was at GenCon, too.  The Ruins are pretty neat.  They had a 50th<br/>
level GM Human Paladin with a fire sword of some type that did 35 dmg<br/>
that you could play with to walk around.  The new race is called the<br/>
Iksar, and they are lizard men.  The story behind the land is that<br/>
the dragons found out about it, or something, and there was a great<br/>
war, and now it&#39;s kind of a wasteland.  They&#39;ve done some nice things<br/>
graphically with it.  The trees sway in the breeze, and the are using<br/>
more polygons on the monsters.  This Hill Giant they had in it looked<br/>
really cool.  The guy showed how the shirt on the giant was a separate<br/>
polygon and move separately from the body.  Kinda neat.  They had a<br/>
rhino that looked really good (he said it was around 30th level) and<br/>
an enourmous scorpion that was just huge.<br/>
  I ended up taking over the controls after this kid left, and was<br/>
wandering down a beach next to some cliff facings, and I found a<br/>
column just off the beach, in the water.  I swam out to it and found<br/>
a tunnel that led back to the shore underwater.  I swam into it and<br/>
it was dark, and I couldn&#39;t see (human at night) and I thought, &quot;let&#39;s<br/>
just see how invincible this character really is&quot;.  The guy was busy<br/>
talking, and needless to say, I drowned his 50th level character by<br/>
taking 1843 points of damage per gulp.  Funny.<br/>
  The actual zone looks like a cross between Innothile Swamp and<br/>
East commons or something.  Kinda flat, kind green and dreary.  He<br/>
mentioned that you could get to the land via Freeport.  Not sure<br/>
exactly where the island is located.<br/>

&gt;For those dying for the upcoming expansion pak the bad news is, it won&#39;t be<br/>
&gt;out before Christmas BUT March 16th, 2000.  On EQVault today they had a <br/>
&gt;post<br/>
&gt;from a guy that went to Gen-Con and he said it wouldn&#39;t be out till<br/>
&gt;3-16-2000.<br/>
&gt;Speaking of the pak many ppl keep saying they are adding more lvls for us,<br/>
&gt;Brad himself has stated before they didn&#39;t know if we would be getting more<br/>
&gt;lvls.  He said they saw no real reason to give us more lvls.  A bit later <br/>
&gt;he<br/>
&gt;said something about if they did it might be from Lvl 50-60.  I think 50 is<br/>
&gt;cool for now but if they do give us more I think it should be at least 75.<br/>
&gt;As I was writing this I read more on EQVault they guy said Verant is<br/>
&gt;thinking of raising the lvl cap to 55 or so.  Gee a whole 5 lvls!!<br/>
