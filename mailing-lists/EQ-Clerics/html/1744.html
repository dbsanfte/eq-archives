<div id="ygrps-yiv-91059916">Hail my friends.  I am new to the clerical ranks and<br/>
had a question about weapons.  I&#39;ve read a few guides<br/>
though there seems to be some conflict on weapons. <br/>
Some guides say one-handed blunt, another say<br/>
two-handed blunt, and lastly, some say both.  I would<br/>
just like to know what everyone else thinks on the<br/>
subject.  Any other tips (as in armor, spells,<br/>
hunting, etc) for a young dwarven clerics (lvl4) would<br/>
be great too.  Thanks.<br/>

P.S.  There be any good cleric websites with like<br/>
clerial weapons and stragies and very descriptive<br/>
spell definitions (like eq.castersrealm.com but for<br/>
clerics? ::duck::).<br/>
