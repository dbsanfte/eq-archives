<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-756724782">Just wondering if anyone has found a valid use (other than training<br/>
Divination, for which it is perfect) for Sense Magic.  It seems to me that<br/>
every item I find that is magical, clearly states so in the description.  I<br/>
am assuming that there are hidden magic items (i.e. appear normal until you<br/>
cast Sense Magic on them), but has anyone ever found one?</div>
