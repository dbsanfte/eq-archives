<br/>
Also you can be stunned.<br/>
<br/>
But is a superb lifesaver never leave home without it and also when all is<br/>
bad and your party gets descended on cast an area effect spell and then just<br/>
keep casting till it goes off and try to zone (hopefully you are sowed). Ok<br/>
if you die the party will have survived as all those not being attacked will<br/>
be on you but 9 times out of 10 I get the party out of jail when someone has<br/>
dropped a train into an already delicate situation.<br/>
<br/>
Apart from the party situaiton gives you a chance when a giant or other<br/>
toughie is on you or indeed any situation goes bad..the first one is<br/>
desperation ok and you do need to be close ..<br/>
<br/>
It is a quick casting spell though..anyway I digress all you asked was can<br/>
you and the answer is no...shame real shame<br/>
<br/>
P.s. and has been said stun is a real bummer it gets through; dont try<br/>
version one when there are alot of &#39;stunners&#39; in the group.<br/>

&gt; Can this be done?  Can u cast divine aura and then gate?  I have yet to<br/>
try<br/>
&gt; because I&#39;m always too busy running when I feel the need to cast divine<br/>
&gt; aura...and end up dying anyway &gt;:(<br/>
