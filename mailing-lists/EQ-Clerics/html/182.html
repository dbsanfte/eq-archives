<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;That&#39;s not true. Divine lasts 30 seconds, and is ALOT faster to cast and<br/>
&gt;takes only 10 mana. It has saved my butt alot of times in unrest and several<br/>
&gt;other places where things didn&#39;t quiet go the way we wanted.<br/>
&gt;I would recommend that ever cleric mems Divine all the time. The first time<br/>
&gt;you use it, it&#39;ll prove itself. I can&#39;t wait to get the next Divine spell.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have both Gate and Divine Aura memmed all the time nowadays. I replaced <br/>
the Spirit Armor with it since i find that spell taking up too much mana for too<br/>
little benefit. Now i have escaped from a few battles with gate even if i had many<br/>
critters at me. Once i was hit by 3 critters in Upper Guk for a total of 70 DMG<br/>
and i still managed to gate... must have been my lucky day. Tried the same<br/>
in Unrest and i always got interrupted. And Divine Aura has not been saving<br/>
my butt lately since i always get stunned... i really think this should be changed<br/>
since people with SOW can outrun the critters without any kind of problems.<br/>
Why not us too with DA?<br/>
