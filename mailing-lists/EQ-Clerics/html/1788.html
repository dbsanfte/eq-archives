<div id="ygrps-yiv-2039563673">Ok, guys, I&#39;m camping Gynok now.  You must be sure to kill the placeholder<br/>
or he won&#39;t spawn.  The spawn spot is right at zone entrance.  It can be<br/>
anything from a rat to an IBS to a ghoul.  The putrid skel and ghoul<br/>
placeholders TALK when they spawn.  First thing you have to do is go to<br/>
level 3 and kill everything down there.  That&#39;s only way you can be sure to<br/>
get the placeholder.  It can be an IBS or anything.  So after you kill<br/>
everything down there, youwill hve killed the placeholder and then you just<br/>
have to camp that zone spot and kill everything that spawns.  Not every<br/>
placeholder will talk.  The IBSs and rats don&#39;t talk.  The placeholder will<br/>
ROAM after it spawns and make its way to level 3.  That&#39;s why you have to<br/>
clear everything down there first to be sure you get it.  Otherwise it will<br/>
never spawn.<br/>

&gt; I was hunting there from lvl 7 to lvl 18, but only saw<br/>
&gt; Gynok twice, it spawn at lvl 1 near zone entrance. Not<br/>
&gt; sure the time, but I don&#39;t think it spawn every 4<br/>
&gt; hours. Hope this help!<br/>
