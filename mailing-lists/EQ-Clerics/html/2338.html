<div id="ygrps-yiv-965996735">I agree with this for sure.  Is there anyone on Erollisi Marr?<br/>
<br/>
Again I wish to thank all for the help I have gotten from this list.   After<br/>
weeks of frustration in trying to make 11 in and around CB Yilari moved to<br/>
Freeport temporarily.    Well today she made 12 and has a lot of fun killing<br/>
orcs in EC and dervs in N. Ro.  She has also had fun with the zombies and<br/>
mummies at the ruins in EC and the occasional wisp that comes along.  No<br/>
luck finding a GSL though yet.  Her only bad experience came when she was<br/>
talked into venturing down into Oasis.<br/>
<br/>
I also understand what you all have been saying about being helpful and<br/>
people will notice.  Yilari has ran all over EC healing and curing disease<br/>
etc when people call out for aid.  Today someone came up to her and gave her<br/>
a chain tunic.   Now she is looking to either give away or sell her leather<br/>
one.<br/>
<br/>
I am wondering about weapons now.   She currently uses either cracked staff<br/>
or summoned hammer.  She cannot afford one of the really nice weapons yet<br/>
but what should she be looking for?   Remember that she barely has 11pp in<br/>
the bank and has to be able to afford 14th level spells soon also.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks all,<br/>
Yilari, High Elven Cleric of Tunare, Erollsi Marr<br/>
