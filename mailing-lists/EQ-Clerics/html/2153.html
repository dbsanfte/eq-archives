<div id="ygrps-yiv-503219559">At 48 I use a charred guardian shield (9 wis) and a BE mace.  Still trying to<br/>
get the Paw Of Opella and a Tained Morning Star (5 wis).  Any 2 HB weapon that I<br/>
would use would have to have enough wis to offset me loosing the AC from the<br/>
shield.  If a 2HB weapon had 15-18 wis I could change out the plat armband and<br/>
the gatorscale legs that I&#39;m using for Steel arms (or Asure Sleeves) and<br/>
silver-plated leggings (total of 7 wis, plus the 9 from the shield = 16 wis).<br/>
Other option is getting the Kedge Totem (18wis!  -9 str).  Still no melee<br/>
involved with the Totem or the Paw.<br/>
<br/>
The only 2 HB weapons that I know of (save Dragon drops) have really low wis.  I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t give up the shield for them.<br/>
