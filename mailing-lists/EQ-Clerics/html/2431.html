<div id="ygrps-yiv-950653607">I had this same problem!   It turns out that raising your faction with the temple of life is quite a pain in the rear... The easiest way I found was to do the blessed oil quest over and over again.   If you are not familiar with this, the details can be found at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://everquest.gamestats.com">http://everquest.gamestats.com</a> .   It basically involves getting a vial of oil at the temple of life and running it out to WK and delivering it to brother somebody... heh... I forget the names of the NPC&#39;s involved.  There are actually two &quot;brothers&quot; that spawn there...  A third one occasionally spawns and this 3rd one is a fake who actually attacks the two brothers you are there trying to meet. (I think the fake ones name is Brother Tristle or something like that and the one you are trying to give the oil to is Brother Estle or something like that...).   You have to do this quest a whole bunch of times to get your faction good enough to do the quest.     One side benefit of this, is that when you give him the oil, he gives you a letter which you can return to the temple of life.. when you do this she tells you to go to paw and give a message to another priest of life who is in the jail there.  When you complete this whole long quest, you get a level 24 cleric spell (symbol of Rytalm) which saves you some plat later on =).   IF you hurry and do this quest now (before they make Paw a level 25&#39;ish dungeon) you can probably do it =)    Being level 16, you will probably need some help though... i think the current level of the gnolls in Paw is around 15&#39;ish.<br/>

Hope this helps!!<br/>

&gt; Hi all, <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I want to do the SSoL quest.  I am a 16th level Hafling cleric of<br/>
&gt; Bristlebane.  The problem, I think lies with my faction in the Temple of<br/>
&gt; Life. Aeston Wemur cons apprehensive, and when I ask him for the<br/>
&gt; instructions, he gives them to me, until I ask him about travelling afar,<br/>
&gt; after which he says that the word is out not to trust me.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; THis particualarily sucks because I gave him the honeyjum, and instead of<br/>
&gt; giving me the potion, he said my name was bad, not to trust me, etc. And he<br/>
&gt; took my honeyjum!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, my question is, how do I raise my faction with the Temple of Life?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
