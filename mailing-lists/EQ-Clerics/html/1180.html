 </span></blockquote>Oooowwww!  I swear I just got here!  &lt;wonders if there&#39;s a way to purge<br/>
Onelist&#39;s membership logs&gt;<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Hey everyone, I want you to meet Aosinator Lightbringer, level 50<br/>
&gt;cleric/wannabe tank on The Rathe and my running mate in EQ ever since P4.<br/>
&gt;She is a VERY knowledgeable cleric and will be able to help us LOTS here on<br/>
&gt;the list with her experience.  I owe all my early patchwork and later banded<br/>
&gt;to her wonderful sewing and smithing skills.  With all the money she made,<br/>
&gt;she was also able to buy me all my spells up to level 24.  She was without a<br/>
&gt;doubt the richest level 15 cleric you ever saw.  Had over 2000 plat in the<br/>
&gt;bank which she spent on all 6 of our group for armor and spells.  I&#39;d of<br/>
&gt;still been in patchwork at level 24 with about 4 spells if it weren&#39;t for<br/>
&gt;Aos.  &lt;hugs Aos tight tight&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Erm... ye afford me to much gratitude Mik.  Ye would have done just fine<br/>
without me I&#39;m sure hon.  Besides, it was fun making patchwork and banded<br/>
for everyone.  ;)  For a cleric looking to save some money in the<br/>
beginning, i would strongly suggest tailoring as a starting skill.  You can<br/>
armor yeself for relatively little money, and can save the rest of the cash<br/>
for spells.  As you go up in levels, you should definitely work on<br/>
smithing, since it&#39;s relatively cheap to increase the skill to the point<br/>
where you can make banded armor with relative reliability.  Besides, it&#39;s a<br/>
helluva lot cheaper than purchasing chain from the store!<br/>

&gt;LOL)<br/>
