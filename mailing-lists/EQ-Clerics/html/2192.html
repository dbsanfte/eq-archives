<div id="ygrps-yiv-2057501227">I think the bottom-line with camping is that, as an RPG, in the same<br/>
style as Baldur&#39;s Gate or Ultima 6,7,whatever, if you had a party and<br/>
someone gave you a quest to go kill such and such, it&#39;s cut and dry to<br/>
go find him, and kill him.  If you can&#39;t find him; that means he&#39;s<br/>
somewhere else.  In Everquest, it means you have to wait hours before<br/>
he shows up.  It&#39;s frustrating, and very dissapointing.  It&#39;s not a<br/>
quest, it&#39;s an exercise in boredom.  I&#39;m trying to think of their<br/>
logic, but I can&#39;t quite see the point.<br/>
  I agree that rare spawns like Bilge should only carry the cleric<br/>
thing, and not other things.  Say you had someone that dropped an item<br/>
like a testament of Vanear.  Of course you would want it to be rare.<br/>
Otherwise, everyone would kill him, and sell the ToV and everyone<br/>
would have one.  They already fixed the &#39;everyone will have one&#39;<br/>
problem by requiring the enchanted platinum bars.  I could easily get<br/>
a cadaceus of sacrament, if it wasn&#39;t for the ~220 plat I need for the<br/>
bars.<br/>
  Like the earlier poster said, I would rather see numerous things be<br/>
required, and they be common things.  I&#39;d rather see these NPCs give<br/>
you a 10-slot bag with crazy requirements.  Some things could be<br/>
common, store-bought things, and others would be things like aviak<br/>
charms, and legionnaire shoulderpads, and giant snake fangs, and<br/>
whatever.  It&#39;d be a hell of a lot more fun running all over the<br/>
world getting things you KNOW you could get, rather than spending your<br/>
whole life waiting in line for something.<br/>
  And they should make it so that if it&#39;s a cleric-only thing, then<br/>
only a cleric should be able to loot it.  Why let a fighter loot a<br/>
cleric icon?  It should just say, &quot;you don&#39;t need that&quot;, and not let<br/>
him loot it.  Then, he might be nice and /shout for any clerics that<br/>
want it can come and have it.  I looted a werebat wing and ghoul<br/>
carrion in Unrest and carried them around for a couple of days before<br/>
someone told me they were for quests that I couldn&#39;t do.<br/>
<br/>
  Ah, what the hell am I talking about.  I play on Test.  I have no<br/>
problem getting the things I need.  :)<br/>

&gt;I was about to start my own topic with quests but someone beat me to it.<br/>
&gt;Right now with quests, armor and such most classes I dont even bother<br/>
&gt;anymore.  I dont care what I am wielding what I am wearing.  Hey I am level<br/>
&gt;27 and I still wear some banded pieces and my good old spiked collar, but I<br/>
&gt;just got my Lizzy Cloak which wasnt to hard to get :)Going off the topic a<br/>
&gt;bit yeah the extra +5 dex I noticed did help my channeling A LOT!!!!  <br/>
&gt;Anyway<br/>
&gt;back to the topic.   Why because I dont want to camp a site for 2 weeks <br/>
&gt;that<br/>
&gt;when it is my turn to get that item only to get it kill stolen or someone<br/>
&gt;else in the group got greedy and took it.  Quests in EQ are about camping<br/>
&gt;till you get the item.  Its that easy.  I agree with Eachann about making<br/>
&gt;rare items spawn random.  Seems like Verant doesnt have the know how to<br/>
&gt;program that into the system.  It will reduce the camping a lot and IMHO I<br/>
&gt;think it will make the game much more fun instead of people staying weeks<br/>
&gt;even months in 1 zone.  If our characters ever got fat from camping 1 site<br/>
&gt;over and over and not exercising,  most of us would start looking like a<br/>
&gt;Orge.<br/>

&gt;p.s Oh about my previous post about not finding a group...  Looks like in 3<br/>
&gt;months when I was gone things have changed.  Thanks guys.<br/>

&gt;IF they want to stop camping, why do they make quests like this?   It is<br/>
&gt;just stupid.  Look at what they did to the cleric armor quest... everything<br/>
&gt;on it takes 7 hours or more to spawn.   And making us camp Bilge just adds<br/>
&gt;insult to injury.. .i mean that goblin is HEAVILY camped already because it<br/>
&gt;holds teh Kedge Totem and some kind of belt.  It rarely spawns and has<br/>
&gt;people lined up for a chance at him, and now they gave it the cleric armor<br/>
&gt;icon as well so we not only have to compete for this rare spawn with other<br/>
&gt;clerics, but also with every other class who wants his items...<br/>
&gt;*sigh*<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Why can&#39;t they make the quests like the Warriors aviak charm quest... where<br/>
&gt;we could kill just normal MOBs and they would rarely drop the icon?   This<br/>
&gt;would make it still difficult to get the piece, since it would be a rare<br/>
&gt;(very rare??) drop... but we could just hunt and try to find it instead of<br/>
&gt;having to camp one rare spawn.    Or maybe they could make it not a hunt at<br/>
&gt;all, but rather a spawn that can come up in random locations, random zones,<br/>
&gt;and you need to follow clues or solve a puzzle in order to know where and<br/>
&gt;when it will spawn?  Something like that... these camping quests just (for<br/>
&gt;lack of a better term) suck.    They said they wanted to put the &quot;Quest&quot;<br/>
&gt;back in EverQuest, but all they have done is put more emphasis than ever on<br/>
&gt;CAMP.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; In part of their quest against camping, EQ set things up with a spawn<br/>
&gt; &gt; range. Not a specific time. the 7 hour spawn will have a time of, say, 5<br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt; &gt; 7 hours in which it will respawn. As far as I know, the longest spawn in<br/>
&gt; &gt; the game is something on the Shaman armour quest, with a maximum of 48<br/>
&gt; &gt; hours between death and respawn.<br/>
