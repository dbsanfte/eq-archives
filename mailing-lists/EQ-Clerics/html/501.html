&gt; Yeah I&#39;d say it&#39;s channeling that helps you do that.  Not even for sure what<br/>
&gt; channeling skill is up to mines on, I think 80 something or 90.  But I<br/>
&gt; should have Lvl 19 either by tonight or tomorrow, depends on how long I play<br/>
&gt; but I already have close to 2 bubbles of exp into 18.<br/>
&gt; Whats new toy do ya have?  Whats DE mean?<br/>

&gt; &gt; well, me personally, i think it&#39;s channelling that helps you recover from<br/>
&gt; being hit and still<br/>
&gt; &gt; casting.....i could be wrong, but i believe that&#39;s what it is....also,<br/>
&gt; later on, it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; important to have as much mana as you can, so i&#39;d invest in wis adding<br/>
&gt; items......believe me,<br/>
&gt; &gt; that can go along way....for example, i died today &lt;yeah i know i&#39;m not<br/>
&gt; supposed to do that,<br/>
&gt; &gt; but it happens&gt;....well, when i got back and looted my corpse, from all<br/>
&gt; the wis adding items<br/>
&gt; &gt; i have, it gave me 2 extra bars of mana....base wis 95 and with items,<br/>
&gt; 138....this was on lv<br/>
&gt; &gt; 40, so it does make a difference<br/>
