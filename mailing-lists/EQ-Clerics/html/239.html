<b>Subject:</b> Still kinda dense on specialization, sorry. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1710175661">I understand what it is, but have a couple questions.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a lvl 13.  All my casting is at lvl65.  If I understand it correctly, I<br/>
can&#39;t even specialize until lvl 30, right?  By that time ALL my magic skill<br/>
levels will be at 150.<br/>
<br/>
So if I specialize (I believe alteration IS the healing/buffing one) at lvl<br/>
30, what happens?  I&#39;m thinking that my alteration will continue to go up,<br/>
but the other 3 or 4 will suddenly take a 100 level dive back to lvl 50?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not bitching, I just haven&#39;t decided whether or not I want to do it.<br/>
Thank god it&#39;ll take me a minimum of 2 more months before I get to lvl 30 &<br/>
apparently have to worry about making that decision. :)</div>
