<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2088621813">LOL, I hate it when no one realizes that I cannot heal<br/>
due to 50 mobs on me.  Then they start screaming at me<br/>
to heal.  A group has to work together in order to<br/>
accomplish anything in this game.<br/>
<br/>
I also have a hotkey that says, &quot;Cleric is tanking!!<br/>
Cleric is tanking!!  Cleric should NOT be tanking!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully someone will get the point after they see<br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
I realize that a cleric should only buff and heal. <br/>
That&#39;s all I do, unless there are just two in my<br/>
party.  If the fight is under control, I nuke till my<br/>
heart is content.  I also like to nuke the runners<br/>
just to get them out of the way.<br/>
<br/>
There is a time and a place for nuking.  I believe<br/>
that a clerics primary purpose is to keep their group<br/>
alive.  In bad situations, I taunt the mobs on me, hit<br/>
divine barrier and scream for my party to zone.  I am<br/>
always the last one to zone and usually do the most<br/>
dying.  But, that&#39;s my job.<br/>
<br/>
I imagine everyone plays their cleric differently.<br/>
When grouped with another cleric, I make it a point to<br/>
let them know that &quot;I&quot; will be the primary healer.  I<br/>
trust no other clerics unless they have proved<br/>
themselves to me already.  I dont like putting my<br/>
group in a risky situation only to find out that<br/>
cleric #2 sucks at his/her job. (not sure if I fall<br/>
into the &quot;self riteous &quot;I know what i am doing but no<br/>
one else does&quot; class but at this point,I dont care. i<br/>
would just rather keep my friends safe than watch them<br/>
fall)<br/>
<br/>
Enough rambling for now,<br/>

&gt; First put aside your self righteous &quot;I know what i&#39;m<br/>
&gt; doing, but no one else<br/>
&gt; does&quot; attitude.  Clerics don&#39;t hold a monopoly on<br/>
&gt; stupidity in this game.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Many times I have been grouped with higher level,<br/>
&gt; higher HP tanks, and have<br/>
&gt; been smoked because they don&#39;t know how to or don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; know why they should<br/>
&gt; keep Mob&#39;s OFF OF THE HEALER!!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have a special macro just for these times, which<br/>
&gt; broadcasts to my group<br/>
&gt; that I have a MOB on me, and that no one gets healed<br/>
&gt; till its off of me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The primary responsibilty of a cleric is healing and<br/>
&gt; buffing.  Not fighting.<br/>
&gt; However, if needs be, those smite and melee skills<br/>
&gt; are there because<br/>
&gt; idiotic, barbarian warriors, like so many I&#39;ve met,<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t have an inkling<br/>
&gt; about protecting healers.<br/>

&gt; I don&#39;t know about soloing clerics, exactly. But I<br/>
&gt; do know that I<br/>
&gt; play AGAINST solo clerics (Ie the orcs, etc that one<br/>
&gt; runs into in<br/>
&gt; Oasis. These are effectively solo critters) The<br/>
&gt; NPCs, when soloing,<br/>
&gt; do a LOT of nuking. So I think maybe that is what<br/>
&gt; the nukes are<br/>
&gt; for!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But I do know about playing caster types that can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; melee well (druid and<br/>
&gt; enchanter)<br/>
&gt; It is not just frustrating to sit and med through a<br/>
&gt; fight. It can also get<br/>
&gt; to the point where you don&#39;t feel you are<br/>
&gt; contributing to the group. It<br/>
&gt; might be useful to remind a cleric that feels they<br/>
&gt; need to melee/nuke every<br/>
&gt; fight they aren&#39;t directly healing that it is okay<br/>
&gt; to sit out a fight, med<br/>
&gt; ALL<br/>
&gt; the way through, and not fight at all. Even if they<br/>
&gt; are not needed for<br/>
&gt; healing.<br/>
&gt; (We tend to pull blue meleers that my monk friend<br/>
&gt; can handle all on her<br/>
&gt; own when I&#39;m low on mana. Then I can sit and med<br/>
&gt; throughout. But it still<br/>
&gt; feels a little odd. As if I&#39;m not doing my &quot;part&quot; --<br/>
&gt; It can be easy, at<br/>
&gt; level<br/>
&gt; 18, to think I should still be meleeing. I haven&#39;t<br/>
&gt; gotten to the part of<br/>
&gt; my life where I&#39;m not effective yet. (And indeed, my<br/>
&gt; AC is about the same as<br/>
&gt; the monk&#39;s.<br/>
&gt; But she clearly does much more damage than I)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway, you might want to humor your insecure<br/>
&gt; clerics and such. let them<br/>
&gt; know that<br/>
&gt; they are STILL contributing even if they don&#39;t do<br/>
&gt; ANYTHING in a particular<br/>
&gt; battle.<br/>
&gt; Or maybe even a series of battles (if you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; fighting a lot of blues. Then<br/>
&gt; this<br/>
&gt; could even be possible) The cleric is still buffing,<br/>
&gt; and being there, ready<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; heal, and cure poison/disease if you happen to get<br/>
&gt; hit by one of those.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Hmm well since you are using my post as a stepping<br/>
&gt; ladder to your<br/>
&gt; &gt;rant...lemme just first clarify to you that I know<br/>
&gt; what a cleric&#39;s main<br/>
&gt; &gt;function in the group is.  Trust me.  Everyone<br/>
&gt; loves me as a cleric.  My<br/>
&gt; &gt;first char on this game is a ranger, and I got her<br/>
&gt; up to lvl<br/>
&gt; &gt;40....so I know<br/>
&gt; &gt;what battles are like in tight situation.  I KNOW<br/>
&gt; what it is like when a<br/>
&gt; &gt;cleric/healer does not heal...and one that runs<br/>
&gt; around screaming and wont<br/>
&gt; &gt;stand still for u to taunt the mob off...or one<br/>
&gt; that runs to zone<br/>
&gt; &gt;as soon as<br/>
&gt; &gt;he/she starts to get hit...or one who thinks that<br/>
&gt; nuking is better then<br/>
&gt; &gt;healing.  I know these thing.  I am not one of<br/>
&gt; those clerics.  The best way<br/>
&gt; &gt;to know how to play a cleric is to first play the<br/>
&gt; opposite...a<br/>
&gt; &gt;tank that can<br/>
&gt; &gt;not heal or heal well...you would know what is<br/>
&gt; expected in a cleric...or<br/>
&gt; &gt;what you think would make the best cleric.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;As to my question about cleric soloing...it isnt<br/>
&gt; because I think Im a<br/>
&gt; &gt;wizard.  Hell, I know I am not even close in nuking<br/>
&gt; power compare to all<br/>
&gt; &gt;other nukers.  The reason why I asked was due to<br/>
&gt; the fact that I just<br/>
&gt; &gt;changed server and I would like to restart a cleric<br/>
&gt; character...but I want<br/>
&gt; &gt;to catch up to my friends.  It is as simple as<br/>
&gt; that...just to let you know<br/>
&gt; &gt;that my post was not the best springboard that<br/>
&gt; leads to yours.  Since I was<br/>
&gt; &gt;really referring to a &quot;solo&quot; situation and you are<br/>
&gt; really talking about a<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;group&quot; situation.  I mean, who cares if the cleric<br/>
&gt; nukes if he/she is<br/>
&gt; &gt;soloing?  No one is going to get hurt except for<br/>
&gt; the cleric.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;All protestation aside.  I have group with other<br/>
&gt; clerics before who do<br/>
&gt; &gt;exactly what you said you hate about them.  Yes, it<br/>
&gt; is a low lvl<br/>
&gt; &gt;thing...and<br/>
&gt; &gt;I tend to tell them that they need to sit their<br/>
&gt; butt down, med, and watch<br/>
&gt; &gt;the health bars, and for god sake dont let that<br/>
&gt; health drops below<br/>
&gt; &gt;50%...esp<br/>
&gt; &gt;for casters.  So I think if you want to help the<br/>
&gt; general well being of your<br/>
&gt; &gt;server...you should take the time and just tell<br/>
&gt; these inexperience clerics<br/>
&gt; &gt;what their main duty is in the group...you never<br/>
&gt; know, they might become<br/>
&gt; &gt;your regular cleric...and won&#39;t you rather have one<br/>
&gt; who you know you can<br/>
&gt; &gt;trust?<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; Hi all :)<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; I&#39;ve played clerics in the past, and when I was<br/>
&gt; grouped, I knew my job,<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; and did it very well. I buffed the tanks before<br/>
&gt; battle, watched their<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; health bars carefully during battle, and (at<br/>
&gt; levels before 25) engaged<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; in a bit of melee if things were going well. No<br/>
&gt; one had to ask me for a<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; heal. I mean, come on. When you go to the doctor,<br/>
&gt; should it be necesary<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; for you to ask him to heal you? Hell, no. That&#39;s<br/>
&gt; his job, for pete&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; sake.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Anyway, I have recently been playing a barbarian<br/>
&gt; warrior, because I knew<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; that I wanted to continue to melee, which would<br/>
&gt; be a no-no for my cleric<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; at higher levels. Now, however, I&#39;m finding it<br/>
&gt; very difficult to find<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; good clerics to group with. My warrior is level<br/>
&gt; 19 now, and I can<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; honestly say that I&#39;ve yet to find a cleric who<br/>
&gt; knows what the hell he&#39;s<br/>
