<div id="ygrps-yiv-193759677">Correct, the latest server is The Nameless. I am currently on that server <br/>
(from Prexus) playing my first cleric and I must say it is fun. Starting out <br/>
on a new server with a class that groups love is the best grouping exp i&#39;ve <br/>
ever had. I am currently lv 23 with the av newbie lvl being around 14 to 20. <br/>
There are a lot of 14 to 20&#39;s, but all the major dungeons lv 20 and up are <br/>
empty enuf to have HARDLY any trains and some VERY nice exp (excluding <br/>
unrest.. ppl like to solo the house there at lv 13.. where&#39;d they get that <br/>
idea?) Places like Guk, Cazic Thule, Mistmoore, etc all have less then 10 <br/>
ppl in them at a time.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to start a new server i would highly suggest the Nameless. Even <br/>
has several gms on... tho not as many as other servers =&#92;<br/>
