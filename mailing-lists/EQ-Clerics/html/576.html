<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-951032689">Have any of you people found real use for this spell? I tried it once against the critters<br/>
in Mistmoore and the result was that a dark sacrificer pet attacked me, i think it was the<br/>
closest critter. Is the effect area the same as in Word of Pain? Meaning you have to be<br/>
very close to the mobs you want to fear? How often is that spell resisted? At the same<br/>
rate as the basic Fear spell?<br/>
<br/>
I think the only use for that spell is when the party is being hammered by multiple creatures<br/>
and after casting going straigth to zone since the feared critters will bring a whole army of<br/>
other critters on us.<br/>
