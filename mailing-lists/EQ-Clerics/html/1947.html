<div id="ygrps-yiv-1749056949">It&#39;s so sad to see all these clerics bickering over petty wealth.  <br/>
     When I was L15 I was wearing patchwork and using a summoned hammer.  <br/>
     As long as I had the money to buy spells I was happy (did have to <br/>
     borrow some from my friends).  I am L50 now and have never had over <br/>
     2000p in the bank (only have 500p in there now) and I still wear 2 <br/>
     pieces of bronze (gloves and cloak).  I think the important thing is <br/>
     to have fun and do what you like (hates camping and farming items).  <br/>
     Don&#39;t worry about what others have. If you have good friends and good <br/>
     groups items will come in time. Besides, what&#39;s to look forward to if <br/>
     you have everything you need by the time you reach L20?<br/>
