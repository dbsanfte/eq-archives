<div id="ygrps-yiv-73097875">Depends on what you mean by difficult... if you consider the fact that you have to camp for days on end to get the parts needed for the quests then it is worse than a 10... other than that it&#39;s probably a 3 or a 4... i mean tracking something down and killing it isn&#39;t that hard if you are around the level that Verant intended you to be to get the armor... and camping locations is certainly easy enough to do, it just sucks doing it.<br/>
<br/>
As for solo&#39;ing, I honestly don&#39;t think a cleric can solo to 50.  I could be wrong, but it is much easier to group.  The power of a cleric is shown in groups, not in soloing.   I find that I cannot solo most blue things now that I&#39;m in my high 20&#39;s and the things that are blue that I can solo take up so much of my mana that I am medding for a very long time after every fight so it isn&#39;t worth it at all to try to solo as a cleric.   That&#39;s IMHO of course =)<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just curious...any clerics here solo (or come close to it) to lvl 50?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Is there a good website that tells you how to do the cleric armor quest?<br/>
&gt; Like the loc of the items.  On a scale of 1-10 (1 being easy and 10 being<br/>
&gt; hard.)  What do you rank the cleric quest to be?<br/>
