<div id="ygrps-yiv-852989739">That is not necessarily true.  I&#39;m a level 4 cleric with full banded and 2<br/>
combine weapons plus jewelry.  When I started this character I played till I<br/>
had gotten about 4 plat then I started brewing.  Once I became a master<br/>
brewer I started pottery.  With pottery you can make 30-40 plat an hour.  I<br/>
have not been twinked but I would fit your description.  Another twinking<br/>
method is for a high level cleric to buff a low level character and then<br/>
stun a mid level creature as the low level character kills him.  I have<br/>
heard of a guild that can have a new character to level 20 in 5 hours with<br/>
this method.  <br/>

	I have heard several descriptions for it but the most common is when<br/>
<br/>
you give your low lvl Char equip or money from your higher lvl char.  Like a<br/>
<br/>
lvl 2 Cleric with full chainmail you know has been twinked.<br/>
<br/>
	Kiting is when that Druid (or other caster with a DOT spell) casts<br/>
it <br/>
on a monster and then runs, casts, runs,ect .. till the monster is dead. <br/>
