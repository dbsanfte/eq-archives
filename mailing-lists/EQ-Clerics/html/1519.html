<div id="ygrps-yiv-2106999348">Plane of Fear = fixed. (3 seperate lands have been in there since it has<br/>
been re-tweaked)<br/>
<br/>
Rogues....I think alot of their problems HAVE been fixed....except a few<br/>
things like failing poison if moving.....<br/>
<br/>
And some classes need to be made weaker to balance the game....then<br/>
again...some also need to be made stronger to balance as well....<br/>

I read on another e-mail list that on the test server they have done it once<br/>
again and they are now changing rez spells.  This is what I&#39;ve read.<br/>
<br/>
Corpses that are older than 2 hours cannot be resurrected.<br/>
Corpses that are produced from a duel cannot be resurrected after 10<br/>
minutes.<br/>
<br/>
I wish Verant would just leave things alone and fix the things that need<br/>
fixed like Plan of Fear, Rogues and things like that and stop making classes<br/>
weaker.<br/>
