<div id="ygrps-yiv-1341329412">This really doesn&#39;t deal with clerics in specific but after some searching I couldn&#39;t find the answer to my question.  If you are in a guild, how do you get out of it, do you have to talk to the guild master or just type some kind of command? like /guildremove &lt;shrug&gt;.  Just wondering.</div>
