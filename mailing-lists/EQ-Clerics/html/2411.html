<div id="ygrps-yiv-1235552820">I hope you are all successful.  Personally, I am too impatient to camp for<br/>
items, even if it it only takes an hour.  So if your protest helps in that<br/>
regard, I am sure it will benfit me as well.  My approach is to just play<br/>
the game, amass experience and wealth, and hope that I can buy what I need.<br/>
Mind you , I&#39;m only 16th level now, so in the future, I may need to camp for<br/>
stuff.  But so far, I have not camped for a single thing, I am happy with<br/>
what my character can and can&#39;t do, and have no complaints about world<br/>
called Norrath. The only complaints I have I can live with, and they mostly<br/>
have to do with the UI of the game and with GM conduct.<br/>

Aye, but looking at it from your perspective you could consider that if the<br/>
sit-in is successful, it&#39;s possible that the 8 hour camps could be reduced<br/>
which would give you LESS time to sit around on purpose (camping for<br/>
items)...  =)<br/>
<br/>
It all depends on how you look at it...<br/>

&gt; Well, I&#39;m taking this sit in from a different perspective.  I only get a<br/>
few<br/>
&gt; hours of play time a week, and I think that I&#39;d rather use it playing the<br/>
&gt; game as opposed to sitting around.  I do enough sitting around, what with<br/>
&gt; trying to find a group and all to play in.  I sure don&#39;t want to do it on<br/>
&gt; purpose.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just my thought.<br/>
