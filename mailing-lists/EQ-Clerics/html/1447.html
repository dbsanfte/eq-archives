<div id="ygrps-yiv-1720286973">I agree that fashion is a must.<br/>
<br/>
I am a high elf female and my graphic looks like this:<br/>
<br/>
No head gear showing of the beatiful chiseled features<br/>
and long blonde hair :)Bronze breastplate with banded<br/>
leggings creating a decent looking mix of orange and<br/>
black skirt with jewels. Bare arms(bracelets) and<br/>
black gloves(leather). Golden boots(banded). One<br/>
handed mace(ssol) and a book(testament of vanear). <br/>
I get many compliments on my looks, which is exactly<br/>
what I am striving for since I am playing a very vain,<br/>
superior acting cleric that always helps those less<br/>
fortunate than herself, which is everybody. (what a<br/>
sentence:))<br/>

&gt; I have mostly ringmail and banded with leather boots<br/>
&gt; and armbands<br/>
&gt; (mostly because of the weight limits of a strength<br/>
&gt; of 75).  But my<br/>
&gt; small ringmail shirt is ac 12 and someone wanted me<br/>
&gt; to wear a lockjaw<br/>
&gt; hide vest that they had acquired.  The ac was the<br/>
&gt; same, but the vest<br/>
&gt; gave me a +5 to my stamina (not that I care), but I<br/>
&gt; chose not to wear<br/>
&gt; it and keep my ringmail because the vest looked like<br/>
&gt; leather and I<br/>
&gt; prefered the look of the ringmail, +5 stamina or<br/>
&gt; not.  :) </span></blockquote></div>
