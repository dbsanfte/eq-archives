<div id="ygrps-yiv-795194104">What part of Qeynos is this quest and who do I have to talk to to get the<br/>
quest and what lvl should one be on to do it?  I got the Bloodforge Hammer<br/>
about a week ago and it&#39;s a pretty good weapon, not the greatest but it&#39;s<br/>
good.  I&#39;ve heard the Hammer can be sold for 35-70pp.  But I&#39;d like to do<br/>
this Shining Star of Light if a lvl 18 Cleric can do it (yes still lvl 18,<br/>
started a new char the other day trying to get him up in lvls before going<br/>
back to Azor).<br/>
