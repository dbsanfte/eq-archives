<div id="ygrps-yiv-370816916">It is very easy to get up faction in Rivervale..<br/>
<br/>
1.  Stop killing Mangler..  the only way he attacks you is if you go in the<br/>
back room of Kevlin Diggs shop (which you don&#39;t need to unless you&#39;re a<br/>
rogue trying to complete a quest).  If Mangler does attack you zone out so<br/>
you don&#39;t take the faction hit.<br/>
<br/>
2.  Not sure what lvl you are, but kill Mooto if you can.  He gives great<br/>
faction.<br/>
<br/>
3.  Continue to hand in RE warbeads and orc centurion belts.<br/>
<br/>
4.  After Misty thicket stops giving you exp, head over to Beholder&#39;s Maze.<br/>
It gives good exp and it still raises the same factions as Misty.   Same<br/>
goes with Runnyeye once Beholder gets too easy for ya.<br/>
<br/>
BTW..  you don&#39;t have to buy your spells from Rivervale..  go somewhere else<br/>
if it&#39;s a must.</div>
