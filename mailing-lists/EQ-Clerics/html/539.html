&lt;&lt; Needless to say, I won&#39;t group with him again.  If there<br/>
 was a way to give him a negative feedback rating, you can bet I would<br/>
 have done it.  We all would have done it.  That way, any other<br/>
 potential group could read his feedback and go, &quot;uh, maybe not.&quot;  And<br/>
 he&#39;s doomed to a life of solo-ing.<br/>
 <br/>
 my two cents. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But there is a way.... name him! Talk to others.... pass the word.... THAT is <br/>
how its done... the making of reputaions, good and bad! SHOUT his name and <br/>
his deed... trust me I do. [well my cleric doesn&#39;t shout, not his way... <br/>
hardly yalks unless he&#39;s known you for a looong time actually ;-)]<br/>
