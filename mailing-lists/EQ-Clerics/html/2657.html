<b>Subject:</b> Scouting in Hate <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2079387935">Now, I am no where near the level needed to enter<br/>
Hate, but I keep hearing people complain that you<br/>
cannot use wolf form or illusions to scout anymore. <br/>
The preferred scout on E Marr is a DE Cleric, who is<br/>
already amiable to Hate, because Innoruuk is the god<br/>
they worship!<br/>
<br/>
The key is to keep that Cleric from getting any bad<br/>
faction, but that&#39;s not too bad, as you simply<br/>
relegate him/her to res duty as well as scouting.<br/>
<br/>
Like I said, I&#39;m not high enough to know this tactic<br/>
first hand, but I was a little surprised that this<br/>
list wasn&#39;t mentioning it as a scouting method when<br/>
the other methods got &quot;nerfed.&quot;  Or did this method<br/>
get ruined as well?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m interested because, as a DE Cleric myself, I was<br/>
looking forward to having a nice Important Role later<br/>
on in life :) .  &#39;Course, all you &quot;goodie&quot; guilds may<br/>
have trouble getting me to help..... ;)<br/>
<br/>
Haith, Dark Elf Cleric of Erollisi Marr<br/>
