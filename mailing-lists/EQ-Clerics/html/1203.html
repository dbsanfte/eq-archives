<div id="ygrps-yiv-1774554515">I suppose that is your opinion.<br/>
<br/>
However, you did say you received a screaming mace from your husband.  That<br/>
doesn&#39;t sound like something you earned or bought.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m with you on the camping issue.<br/>
<br/>
Despising a beggar is certainly a fair reaction. In fact, the trade skill<br/>
&#39;begging&#39; rarely results in success.  I agree that beggars can be annoying.<br/>
But aren&#39;t they in real life?<br/>
<br/>
And, how do you classify someone who asks for a buff?  As a beggar?  Sheesh.<br/>
May as well not ask for anything in the game.  I constantly ask for SOW.<br/>
And do so in an RP&#39;ing context.  I&#39;m not one of those types who shouts &#39;Who<br/>
can give me SOW&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I have begged.  And in all my travels, I have never asked out right for<br/>
anything.  I have roleplayed a down on his luck cleric.  I have also worked<br/>
very hard to get the 52pp I have in the bank.  That was earned 10% begging,<br/>
60% trading up armour and selling to players, and 30% loot selling.  If,<br/>
after hearing my story, people are inclined to donate, so be it.  I consider<br/>
that begging.<br/>
<br/>
Now, for those who feel it is laziness, well, thats your opinion as well.  I<br/>
for one don&#39;t think RP&#39;ing for 3 hours straight, just to earn a few plat is<br/>
lazy.  Its pretty bloody time intensive and not very rewarding.  Its the<br/>
RP&#39;ing interaction, and the bit of realism I add to the world that I enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
And, I also give to beggars.  Having received from others, I feel I should<br/>
give as well.<br/>

Ahhh not sure how yall are going to react with this one, but I have some <br/>
very strong feelings on this issue. I believe they stem from me having <br/>
started playing way back when the game was first released.<br/>
<br/>
I despise Beggars....I have always been a helpful person, but the biggest <br/>
mistake you can make with me is to beg.<br/>
<br/>
I started out in this game with nothing just like the rest of you, Some <br/>
people call me bitter, which is not the case, i am a very happy player, i <br/>
enjoy this game quite a bit, but I have a sense of value for items, I <br/>
EARN(not by Buying or begging) ALL of my equipment, I have never asked <br/>
anyone for anything and never will. I wore Patchwork, yes patchwork leather <br/>
until I was lvl 20, yes 20, I remember having only 6gp and I bought a PW <br/>
tunic for 4, dropped the tunic and was SOL.  I was never able to buy all my <br/>
spells at early levels right when I was able to use them, i had to buy a few<br/>
<br/>
at a time, I used a hammer of wrath until I was lvl 20 and my husband had <br/>
given me a screaming Mace which I used up til I was high enough level to <br/>
kill the savant and get a black enamelled one.  I Appreciate all the items <br/>
that I have, I don&#39;t get items that I cannot use, I don&#39;t overcamp places to<br/>
<br/>
get mega quantities of items.  I don&#39;t buy items, money means nothing in <br/>
this game. There is nothing I hate more than to have a group with one caster<br/>
<br/>
who already has a SMR camping the Arch Magi.<br/>
I am begged on a daily basis and when Someone begs from me, they are damn <br/>
well not gonna get a copper from me. I am a generous person, I buff people <br/>
all the time and have given away many items that I have gotten replacements <br/>
for. i.e. I gave a black iron medallion to a low lvl druid I met in <br/>
Rivervale one day, we just chatted and he never asked for anything, I gave <br/>
it to him out of the kindness of my heart.  I guess basically i feel I <br/>
worked my butt off to get what I have and if you are begging from people you<br/>
<br/>
are not even trying to get things for yourself, makes me very ill.<br/>
Enough of my rant.<br/>
Can&#39;t wait to hear feedbacks on this one.<br/>

&gt;Hi all.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I gave seen this debate before in other places.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What do you all think of begging as a method of acquiring<br/>
&gt;cash/armour/weapons?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t mean the skill of begging, but I mean approaching other PC&#39;s and<br/>
&gt;asking them to spare a bit?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Now, I am for it.  I beleive that RP&#39;ing worlds parallel the real world, <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;inthe real world, there are those who are poor, and need to beg for thier<br/>
&gt;sustenance.  At the lower levels, I gained most of my armour and my money<br/>
&gt;from begging.  Now I do it in a RP&#39;ing context, and not as &#39;Hey, got any<br/>
&gt;free armour I can have?&#39;.  I think that this is a valid strategy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As well, now that I am entering the teens, I don&#39;t need to beg as often.<br/>
&gt;But I do barter with players, and when doing so, I subtly make them beleive<br/>
&gt;that I am a poor cleric (which I really am). In doing so, I have made some<br/>
&gt;great deals, and am able to get some good bargains on armour.  Last nite,<br/>
&gt;for instance, I bought a bloodforge hammer for 15 pp, and a FS staff.  From<br/>
&gt;what I could see, they usually went for around 30 pp.  In my opionion, its<br/>
&gt;no different than trading in ussed car and dressing down and making the<br/>
&gt;saleperson beleive you are poorer than you really are.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Any other thoughts?<br/>
