<div id="ygrps-yiv-2078720858">RE: [EQ-Clerics] Lvls After Expansion PakTo answer at least one of those yes they keep gaining exp after the hit Lvl 50.  Thats what got ppl wondering on what will happen once the pak is released, cause they keep getting exp and they wonder whats gonna happen with that exp.  As for what happens to the bar onces its filled, ask a Lvl 50 we have at least two on this list.  I think I heard once it&#39;s filled it changes colors or something.<br/>

  isnt this a bit....ridiculous?  First off....are they EVEN GAINING EXP after 50?  and if so....its damn hard enough....killing drags etc.  Not to mention....whathappens when the bar fills completely?  does it restart?    Unless you can answer me.....please....dont write this kinda philisophical crap.<br/>
