&gt; Please forgive, for I am new to this list, but here is my problem and<br/>
&gt; suggestion for Verant:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My number one problem with the game is kill stealing. This frustrates me<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; no end.  I can&#39;t begin to tell you how long I have been trying for a Shiny<br/>
&gt; Brass Shield in Crushbone and how many kills have been stolen from me from<br/>
&gt; some mage hiding in a tree.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Already being looked into by Verant - they are putting the group total<br/>
damage on some servers - not telling us which ones for now and seeing how it<br/>
goes.<br/>
<br/>
Their fear at the start was a &quot;group&quot; of kill stealers vs one KS, but we<br/>
pretty much shot that down, considering steal killers are usually jerks and<br/>
has anyone ever seen a group of jerks get along? NO, they would just<br/>
continue to be jerks with each other. Are other thought was even if they did<br/>
group, they would be in one place instead of six jerks in six places :)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - Read the EQ website and the producers letter  for updates on this<br/>
and/or any interviews in which Brad talks about this. </span></blockquote></div>
