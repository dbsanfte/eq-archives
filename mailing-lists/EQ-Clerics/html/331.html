<div id="ygrps-yiv-690459521">No actually what i meant is that there are certain lvls that are harder to<br/>
get XP in, you will see this as you get higher up, for example, lvl 30,<br/>
lvl35, lvl40 lvl 45, all of these levels seem to take forever to earn the<br/>
necessary Experience, i think they are set up that way for a reason, to try<br/>
to slow us down...that is why i say if you res a person in those specific<br/>
level they will not see as noticeable a difference as a person who is in<br/>
another level.<br/>

&gt;I think what she was saying is it depends on what Lvl the person you&#39;re<br/>
&gt;casting it on is on.  Like since I&#39;m still lvl 15 (should hit Lvl 16<br/>
&gt;sometime today), if casted it on me I would not get much exp back but if<br/>

&gt;So I take it you finally got you one of those Staff of the Observer you&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;been wanting forever.  Hope you like it and congrats on Lvl 40.  Why is Lvl<br/>
&gt;40 gonna suck by the way?  Is it like Lvl 20 when ya die you lose close to<br/>

&gt;&gt; actually, that does make a lot of sense.....it would seem that hte higher<br/>
&gt;lv you<br/>
&gt;&gt; are, the more exp you can give back.....i just know now that i have to go<br/>
&gt;thru<br/>
&gt;&gt; hell all over again....lv 40&#39;s gonna SUCK majorly......o btw, i have a<br/>
&gt;question<br/>
&gt;&gt; about the staff of the observer while i&#39;m thinking about it....it has one<br/>
&gt;charge<br/>
&gt;&gt; of the sentinel spell....&lt;which is a crock ir should be unlimited like<br/>

&gt;staff?<br/>
&gt;&gt; which would suck there too....any info would be greatly appreciated on<br/>
&gt;this...i<br/>
