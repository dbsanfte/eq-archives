&gt;  I disagree whole- heartedly. I have played RPGs since the age of 8 (I<br/>
&gt; am 26 <br/>
&gt; now), and I have played many multi-player RPGs (when they were first<br/>
&gt; invented <br/>
&gt; around 1986 or so)  where roleplaying was great, and one of them was<br/>
&gt; very <br/>
&gt; recent- a year ago to be exact. Of course there were questions where<br/>
&gt; someone <br/>
&gt; will ask what level you are or the monsters hit points, but there was<br/>
&gt; also a <br/>
&gt; great deal of roleplaying, so it didnt matter -  I have even  been OOC<br/>
&gt; on <br/>
&gt; *more* then one occasionof times myself. But people were there because<br/>
&gt; it was <br/>
&gt; a different world to escape to. Norrath to me is an empty world.<br/>
&gt;   I have never been in a game where so many people ripped me off so<br/>
&gt; they can <br/>
&gt; get more money to buy that next cool item.  I can understand if your <br/>
&gt; character is a thief or some other mischievous being that follows a<br/>
&gt; deity of <br/>
&gt; that sort- but  how many times has this happened to you - <br/>
&gt;   1)  A  paladin left you for death while you were fighting off<br/>
&gt; monsters- and <br/>
&gt; he/she ran without thought of honor or disgrace - as what he would say<br/>
&gt; to <br/>
&gt; explain the situation - &quot; I didnt want to  lose &quot; a half bar of<br/>
&gt; experience&#39;&#39; <br/>
&gt;   2) A  holy cleric  said to you &quot;It&#39;s a nosave lightstone&quot; in Kerra<br/>
&gt; isle <br/>
&gt; (Before nosave lightstones were implemented in Kerra isle)<br/>
&gt;  3) A person following a deity of &#39;goodness&#39; loot every corpse in<br/>
&gt; sight even <br/>
&gt; though it wasnt his/her turn. <br/>
&gt;  4) A person diband your group to join another group for more &quot;<br/>
&gt; experience&#39;&quot; <br/>
&gt; rather then enjoying the moment of adventurers  for the cause of good <br/>
&gt; adventure.<br/>
&gt;  5)  A ranger or druid killing a bear, lion, elephant, etc - for &quot;exp<br/>
&gt; or to <br/>
&gt; increase my &#39;tailoring skill&#39; &quot; <br/>
&gt;  Etc, etc..the list goes on. I expected these things to happen, but I<br/>
&gt; have <br/>
&gt; never met a single perons in EQ that actually tried  to adhere to<br/>
&gt; their <br/>
&gt; character.  The world of EQ is full of greed and who can be the next &#39;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; coolest high level character&#39;. <br/>
