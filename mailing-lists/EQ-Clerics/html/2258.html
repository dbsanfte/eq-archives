<div id="ygrps-yiv-1612837908"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Make a halfing halfings rock,  de&#39;s suck as clerics, horrible starting<br/>
&gt;stats.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just to clear the records so no one believes that crap about de clerics<br/>
sucking - My DE cleric does NOT suck, she does quite well, as anyone in her<br/>
guild and group can testify.  Starting stats are just that.. starting and<br/>
THEY CAN BE MODIFIED with stat increasing equipment.<br/>
<br/>
Not to mention the person asked who LOOKED best.  The question has nothing<br/>
to do with skill or stats, but looks.  To say a DE sucks is just spouting<br/>
off about something you know nothing about.<br/>

DE cleric... and no I don&#39;t suck</div>
