<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1899106770">Here&#39;s a little information for the younger clerics out there.  If you see any<br/>
&quot;errors&quot; or misconceptions, please feel free to jump in.  I&#39;m a level 23 cleric<br/>
and usually hunt with two rangers and one enchanter - and all are about the <br/>
same level.<br/>
<br/>
Here are the spells I put into memory when getting the group together -  Symbols, <br/>
Spirit Armor, Daring, Divine Aura, Endure Magic, Stun, Holy Might, Heal<br/>
<br/>
I found that I can now hunt in many of the mid-level dungeons with moderate <br/>
ease. Finding a group to join is your first and foremost priority. The combos<br/>
are infinite, but I really like to have at least one true tank (crunchy on the<br/>
outside and soft on the insides) and someone to do crowd control (enchanter <br/>
works the best). Prior to the start of the grouping experience, before I even <br/>
buff myself, I drop four spells on the tank - Daring, Spirit Armor, Symbols <br/>
and Endure Magic. As far as the bang for your buck, these four spells can and<br/>
will make the difference in just about ANY battle.  Then I drop Daring on <br/>
the rest of the group (the HPs really help a lot if running to the zone) and<br/>
depending upon my mana and supplies, Symbols too.  <br/>
<br/>
I make it clear to everyone that the tank(s) will get heals when they are <br/>
down to two bubbles.  I will  stun the big mobs at will, saving my mana for <br/>
heals later on.  I don&#39;t even HAVE Smite memmed, because of the high mana cost <br/>
involved. (I&#39;m no nuker and have never pretended to be one unless i&#39;m soloing.)<br/>
If a MOB gets on a magic user (soft on the outside, softer on the inside) I <br/>
promise to stun the MOB and keep it busy until someone else can take it off of <br/>
me.  Since I&#39;m fairly tough (crunchy on the outside) I can take a beating for <br/>
a while before having to scream for help like a little girly-man. My AC of 480 <br/>
gives me moderate protection from just about anything at my level.  So the <br/>
tactics are worked out - I Stun at the beginning of battle,  Root/Invigorate/Taunt <br/>
during the mid-battle and Heal near the end.<br/>
<br/>
I scour the area (do the /who) looking for an enchanter at level 29 or better.<br/>
When I find one, I trade buffs with him (I give him Daring, he gives me Clarity).<br/>
This way, I can not only participate in melee during the beginning of a fight,<br/>
but I can QUICKLY heal everyone up after the battle and med up to 100% by the <br/>
time everyone else is ready.  I also work out a deal for SOW whether a buff <br/>
trade or cash deal - I&#39;ll explain that later.<br/>
<br/>
Then I swap out my spells for battle - Word of Shadow, Fear, Daring, Divine Aura,<br/>
Stun, Holy Might, Extinguish Fatigue, Heal<br/>
<br/>
After a few battles, I start recasting the various buffs, staggering the spells<br/>
across the group members so that they don&#39;t all terminate at the same exact time.<br/>
This allows me to keep at least 80% mana at ANY given time while keeping all my<br/>
fighters well-fed and cared for.  If we are collecting yard-trash (fighting the <br/>
annoyingly common greenies) I will jump in and help with the melee (hey, my <br/>
Screaming Mace is NOT gonna rust away - I&#39;ll be DAMNED if that happens).<br/>
<br/>
Since I&#39;m not usually fighting, I can keep an eye on everyone&#39;s health bars.<br/>
Also, by scanning the battle text (I have the hits turned ON so I can see <br/>
who is catching the most potential grief) I know who will be needing the most <br/>
help with Stuns/Heals in the very near future.  I keep an eye out for other<br/>
MOBs nearby and alert the rest of the group if and when an extra baddie gets <br/>
pulled by the raging battle.  I use /TELL to inform someone else of something<br/>
happening because typing in /Group mode sometimes gets lost in the sauce.  The<br/>
caster(s) in the group knows that I am their personal protector - with the <br/>
provision that as soon as I pull the MOB off of them, they will take it back <br/>
off of me.<br/>
<br/>
I also keep an eye on the fighters and the speed at which they are attacking.<br/>
I tell them if their stamina (yellow bar) gets down to three bubbles, to send<br/>
me the message /G ZING ME  and I hit them with an Extinguish Fatigue spell. <br/>
Many people ignore this spell but watch what happens when you get a Ranger <br/>
dual-weilding weapons against something big.  The spell immediately speeds up<br/>
his attack speed, allowing him to get more hits on the MOB as if he was fresh<br/>
for battle.  It&#39;s a VERY underutilized spell and rarely used by other clerics.<br/>
I don&#39;t go into battle without it - the faster my tanks hit, the safer I am. <br/>
It&#39;s that simple. &lt;grin&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Naturally, I&#39;m the best qualified for knowing when to zone or not.  I see <br/>
everyone&#39;s hit points and I know how much mana I have left for Heals.  I tell<br/>
everyone to let the group know when they are at LOM status (less than 2 bubs<br/>
of mana) so that we can best judge the final fight.  I have a macro written<br/>
which tells the group to &quot;/G ZONE ZONE ZONE ZONE&quot;  (just like that - it&#39;s VERY hard<br/>
to miss THAT in your text windows) while at the same time letting people know<br/>
nearby &quot;/Say Train coming.. watch out!!&quot;.   The third line has the text command<br/>
&quot;/Shout Train to zone - be careful!&quot;.  This is just being courteous to other <br/>
groups and gives them a chance to save their own collective ass before we bring<br/>
lots of bad things down upon them.<br/>
<br/>
I keep Word of Shadow memmed for special occasions.  When three of my group <br/>
members are under two bubbles and my mana is low and the gators just keep on <br/>
attacking, I&#39;ll jump into the middle of the battle and hit my Word of Shadow<br/>
spell.  This rains down pain upon everything near me and turns me into the <br/>
poster boy for pain for all baddies involved.  Most of them usually turn and <br/>
start smacking me around.  I then hit my Divina Aura spell, preventing the <br/>
damage from creasing MY skull to much. I make sure that everyone is already <br/>
running and when my barrier is about to give out (15 seconds or so) I take off,<br/>
letting the SOW keep me ahead of the nasties.  <br/>
<br/>
While I don&#39;t usually have to do this (most evacuations are handled the normal<br/>
way, everyone running to the zone and me throwing a Heal or two on the ones<br/>
left hanging by a thread) the times it does happen, lives get saved and people<br/>
get happy.  <br/>
<br/>
After the battle, I heal everyone up to 80% and then med up, knowing that we&#39;ll<br/>
all hit 100% at about the same time (their health, my mana).  Then we go back<br/>
in and get some revenge on the critters that did us dirty before. I tell <br/>
everyone in my group - Payback is TRULY a bitch.<br/>
<br/>
Well, that&#39;s all I have for now.  Again, please feel free to embellish where <br/>
you can.  But please, if you are going to reply, SNIP the bulk of this message<br/>
so that people don&#39;t have to read my drivel more than once. &lt;grin&gt;<br/>
