<div id="ygrps-yiv-1738311118">Someone in my group went linkdead frequently last night and we got a notice <br/>
each time.  When he was in the same zone as us, the warning was in yellow.  <br/>
When he was in another zone, it was in red.  I play on the Bristlebane server <br/>
so I think it&#39;s live on all the servers.<br/>
