&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just an update on how it went last night from the newbie lvl 50 cleric ;)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well, I only died once and none of the tanks died.  The group was consisting<br/>
&gt; of 3 tanks and 2 clerics.  We had some good fighting/pulling and basically<br/>
&gt; it was a good raid.  I was unsure, and still is, on what my role as the<br/>
&gt; &quot;other&quot; cleric is.  The more experienced cleric in the group was rather<br/>
&gt; uncommunicative.  I basically buffed and kept the buffing on all the tanks,<br/>
&gt; and the clerics.  I cast out SH when I saw health going down drastically and<br/>
&gt; GH once in awhile. I did cast Naltron on all the tanks though...wasted alot<br/>
&gt; of money =/  I had like 20 peridot now Im down to 5<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Can anyone tell me if u use atone on any of these raids?  If so, just how do<br/>
&gt; u go about using it?  I mean do you heal, atone, heal, atone...just so that<br/>
&gt; the thing won&#39;t frenzy on you?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks again for all the helpful tips and advice =)<br/>
