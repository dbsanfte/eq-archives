<div id="ygrps-yiv-774513046">Well, not exactly.  A 100pt heal and a 100pt nuke is a bit different.  The way<br/>
the taunt works is that any undamaged mob will come after you.  If a wiz nukes<br/>
for 80, then starts to get beat on and I heal him for 100, the MOB will not come<br/>
after the me.  However, if there were 3 mobs, the other two sure will.  There is<br/>
some formula that heals figure into, but it&#39;s not a 1-to-1 relationship on how<br/>
much you heal.   If your puller has a damage shield on him/her, I can still get<br/>
off that first superior heal without pulling more than 1 in a 3 pull off him.<br/>
Most of the time I won&#39;t pull anything off him if he has a damage shield on<br/>
(especially lava shield).<br/>
<br/>
Look at the MOBs as we look at them.  I&#39;ll use low level orcs as an example.  If<br/>
there was an orc warrior, an orc wizard (ok, no such thing exists, but for<br/>
argument sake pretend!), and an orc priest that were all blue to you, which one<br/>
do your group take out first?  It may hurt with the wizard casting on you, but<br/>
you take out the priest first, then the wiz, then the warrior.  You may have one<br/>
person trying to distract the wizard and the main tank taunt the warrior to keep<br/>
him of the casters and the cleric, but the priest has to die first or it gets a<br/>
lot harder.  MOB IA is very similar to this.  Just like when we see that Orc<br/>
Priest / Lizardman Judicator / Cleric of Innoruuk (unless you have an enchanter<br/>
that can mes them) then healer has to die first, MOBs think along the same lines<br/>
but take in to account the amount of damage that&#39;s been done to them and the<br/>
additional hate built up (through taunt effects).  If they didn&#39;t take this into<br/>
account, the healing classes would be a lot harder to play as you&#39;ve have to<br/>
have to do crowd control and heal.<br/>

Previous Post:<br/>
oh, it&#39;s true!   I believe that the monsters see a 100pt heal as a 100pt hit<br/>
on them... so if you do a greater heal or a superior heal, it&#39;s like a<br/>
really big area effect nuke so far as they are concerned.  Heal spells are a<br/>
huge huge taunt...<br/>
