<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1690330057">That is why I wish the shortcut was gone. Because it IS a bug.<br/>
I do not use it on a general basis. I tested it since I had posted here it<br/>
was gone and had my comment challenged.<br/>
<br/>
Since I was at the area that it was at, I decided to see for myself. I had<br/>
never used it before and do not plan to use it repeatedly. I wish Verant<br/>
would take it out because yes, it bothers me, that people who are willing to<br/>
break the rules are getting rewarded for it.<br/>

&gt;So let me get this straight, it sounds like at least three people have<br/>
&gt;admitted exploiting a bug... and at least one plans to exploit<br/>
&gt;it repeatedly<br/>
&gt;for the sake of saving a bit of time getting a few spells?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hmm. </span></blockquote></div>
