<div id="ygrps-yiv-881607563">I haven&#39;t heard of him spawning on the island... the few people i&#39;ve known<br/>
who&#39;ve seen him say he spawns either near unrest or near the orc camp... I<br/>
don&#39;t know which or if either is true... I do know though that he paths<br/>
towards the paladan hero camp near the BB zone.  He was killed by those NPC<br/>
Paladins a couple of times while I was hunting him.   I ended up getting my<br/>
Bilge ingot after a druid killed Bilge and looted the cleric item... I paid<br/>
him 50pp to go to Solusek Ro with me and turn it in so that I could turn in<br/>
the rest of the quest items, thus getting the chestplate.<br/>

&gt; Hello there fellow clerics. Just wanted to see if anyone here knows the<br/>
&gt; general location where Bilge spawns in the cauldron and if there is a<br/>
&gt; trick to get him to spawn other than killing every wandering goblin in<br/>
&gt; sight. Somone told me he spawns on the island on the very top, but<br/>
&gt; I have never seen the dirty critter yet.<br/>
