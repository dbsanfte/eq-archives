<div id="ygrps-yiv-958308360">Has anyone looted a Spear of Warding off an Mino?  Last night I saw a Mino<br/>
dead and I noticed he was holding something in his hand and it wasn&#39;t an<br/>
axe.  But I didn&#39;t loot it cause someone was killing them and looting the<br/>
ones around it.  A bit later I saw another one dead just inside the cave in<br/>
Steamfont, no one was around so I looted it to find a spear.  The spear was<br/>
called Spear of Warding and was magic, atk delay was like 24 or so and dmg<br/>
was 6, I went to sell it and the store would give me nothing for it.  So I<br/>
just figured it had to be an quest item, I logged off for a while and when I<br/>
got back on the spear was gone.  If this spear is an quest item, what quest<br/>
is it for?  No one seems to know anything about it and it seems to be a new<br/>
item and quest.<br/>
