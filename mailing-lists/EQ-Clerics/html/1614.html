A higher Polygon count and texture count, means slowwer redraw more<br/>
texture and memory swapping. Plus more mathematical calculations.<br/>

&gt; I have heard that stationary non moving objects do not increase lag, If that<br/>
&gt; were the cas than all the trees , rocks, buildings, and whatever else that<br/>
&gt; may be in zone would increase lag too IMO.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;i agree.....i get sick of zoning into unrest and cazic and lagging<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; just because of the corpse rate...those are the zones that sadly to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; say, i have to turn off particle density because i lag too much with<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; them on....&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Can anyone confirm (as in from Verant) that corpses increase lag? I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; &gt;heard this for a long time, but I don&#39;t really understand it.<br/>
