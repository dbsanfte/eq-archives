The *drawing* of the corpses I would maintain don&#39;t contribute one<br/>
iota to network lag, but _may_ contribute some to FPS slowdowns (like<br/>
the slide show effect you get with AoE spells), but even so, it&#39;s<br/>
minimal. <br/>
<br/>
The number of corpses may contribute a teensy bit to the amount of<br/>
data being shuffled around the network, but frankly, I see much more<br/>
variation based on the number of active players than corpses.<br/>
<br/>
So the answer then is &quot;no, it has not been verified that corpses<br/>
contribute to lag, other than by anectodal experience and theory&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, all that said, I agree with the rez change; what was happening<br/>
was in the letter of the game mechanics but not the spirit.<br/>
