<div id="ygrps-yiv-1705624812">Even if they made it so a groups combined damage was taken into<br/>
consideration solo wizards would still get the kill credit.  They can do<br/>
so much damage per spell that there really isn&#39;t enough HP left on a mob<br/>
for  a group total to be more.  <br/>
 Verants choice of whoever does the most damage vs. group damage, makes <br/>
no difference.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; The whole killstealing thing is due to a very, very bad design decision by<br/>
&gt; Verant. I.e., that a group&#39;s total damage is ignored in assigning credit for<br/>
&gt; kills, and if an outside player has done more damage than any *single* group<br/>
&gt; member, then he gets credit for the kill. Brad posted a note about this </span></blockquote></div>
