<div id="ygrps-yiv-207799224">I assume you&#39;re referring to the pickclaws then?<br/>
And what do the named prisoners/bandits drop?  Anything interesting?<br/>

I&#39;ll beat the High Keep drum ;)<br/>
<br/>
Worth the wait for a group. Has places for you to get great exp from 24 to<br/>
35... and that&#39;s not the best part. The best thing about Keep is Keep<br/>
itself. Guards handy if things get bad... zone handy if they get worse...<br/>
vendor handy so you don&#39;t hafta waste a scrap of loot if you don&#39;t want...<br/>
bank handy so you don&#39;t hafta throw out coppers to stay unencumbered... and<br/>
food and water sold there if you don&#39;t feel like conjuring some (like who<br/>
does anymore anyway?&lt;G&gt;). The only other thing you could ask from a zone<br/>
would be that you were the only one that knew about it! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
And while you&#39;re waiting for that group... you might be able to solo the<br/>
named prisoner in the jail area or the named bandits outside in High Pass.<br/>

I&#39;m trying to figure out where to get xp at 24th level.  I really like<br/>
Upper Guk, but there is kind of a hole at 24th level in Upper Guk.  My<br/>
friends all want to do Cazic Thule, but I find it so incredibly<br/>
boring.  I was thinking Unrest, but I have so many bad memories of<br/>
such bad trains there.  Seems like Runnyeye might be good, but not too<br/>
familiar with it.  Not sure what levels of creatures are there.  Then<br/>
there is Borxx who could probably kick our ass.<br/>
   Friend of mine suggested East Karana might be a good place to solo.<br/>
Said I could solo evil eyes there.  And as risky/exciting as that<br/>
sounds, I don&#39;t think I could continue to get xp there until 29th.<br/>
   Paw and Mistmoore are still too high/tough.  I heard Sol A might be<br/>
good, but I&#39;ve never been to Lavastorm, and worry about falling into<br/>
lava as I&#39;ve heard you&#39;re oft to do when zoning into the place.  Maybe<br/>
dark elf guards in Nektulos?  What level are griffons?  What level are<br/>
the giant skels in Rathe mountains?  Maybe pickclaws in highkeep?<br/>
<br/>
Anyone have any recommendations for either a group of low 20s, or for<br/>
me to solo at 24?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,<br/>
