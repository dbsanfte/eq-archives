<div id="ygrps-yiv-2072326579">Instead of capping the servers they just need to add about 3 to 5 more<br/>
servers I think this would help level out the number of players per server.<br/>
I would go to a new server with lower number of people and start over!<br/>

&gt; A cap might be nice but put it to low and you&#39;ll have a lot off ticked off<br/>
&gt; people cause they can&#39;t get onto their server.  If that starts to happen<br/>
we<br/>
&gt; might see a lot of ppl quiting the game, ya I know less ppl playing means<br/>
&gt; more places to hunt without fighting over who gets what kill and less lag.<br/>
&gt; But thing about that less ppl playing (less money for Verant) less money<br/>
for<br/>
&gt; them could mean the end of EverQuest, I mean look at other games such as<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; Realm.  The Realm at first was a big game, but over time ppl got tired of<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; and they quit playing where is the Realm now?  It might still be there but<br/>
&gt; how often is it updated, how many ppl are on there now to play with or<br/>
&gt; against?  I like EQ about as much as the next person, but I have a feeling<br/>
&gt; we won&#39;t see it around or as big as it is now for I&#39;d say 2-3 more years,<br/>
&gt; with games such as Middle-Earth, Asherions Call and I&#39;ve heard of one more<br/>
&gt; coming out.  If these 3 games hit it big a lot of ppl with switch from EQ<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; them, if they switch these 3 games to put an end to EQ.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I agree that the servers need to capped. I even think 1000 on a server<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; &gt; alot...I would love to see servers capped at 500. Wow,<br/>
&gt; &gt; would THAT be something =)<br/>
