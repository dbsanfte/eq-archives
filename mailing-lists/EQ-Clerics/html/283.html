<div id="ygrps-yiv-1405854285">Actually, they put in burned out ones only for the ones that used to not<br/>
have any loot. They did this to avoid people only hunting the ones that<br/>
glow.  You still get lightstones and greater lightstones in the same<br/>
frequency, but now they all glow so you can&#39;t tell which are carrying the<br/>
good ones.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s a really good idea, but getting the lightstones now is a<br/>
&gt; bust...they took<br/>
&gt; out looting lightstones and glightstones a while back with a<br/>
&gt; path...now you get<br/>
&gt; a burned out lightstone or a nosave lightstone...pretty much<br/>
&gt; worthless....if you<br/>
&gt; had one before the patch, you still have it...&lt;have one on both<br/>
&gt; my toons&gt; but<br/>
&gt; you can no longer loot em...you still get money off the wisps<br/>
&gt; tho....just root<br/>
&gt; and blast...doesn&#39;t always work, but it sure does help....if you<br/>
&gt; need help, get<br/>
&gt; a warrior with a combine (; they take the hits, and you can just blast<br/>
&gt; away...what i did...(: </span></blockquote></div>
