<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1517953376">What does everyone think of this Yield Policy?  In case you never heard of<br/>
it, it Brads new way of getting rid of high lvl characters camping lower lvl<br/>
spawn points.<br/>
This is what he said but it<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If a higher level player who would get no exp for the kill is camping a<br/>
spawn, and a group of players that would get exp (meaning they should be<br/>
there) wants to fight there, the higher level player must yield. The lower<br/>
level group has the right of way.<br/>
<br/>
As for the other disciplinary information in that post, it sounds like the<br/>
same policy that&#39;s always been in place: if you are warned several times and<br/>
continue to break the rules, you will be banned.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Do you all think this will work or just tick off a lot of players?  I&#39;m not<br/>
sure if I&#39;m for it or not, but also remember if your a camper doing this and<br/>
you&#39;re warned a few times you&#39;ll be banned from the game.  I don&#39;t really<br/>
camp, I do in a few spots but not a lot but only in places that give me exp.<br/>
He said it wouldn&#39;t be actively enforced till it was officially announced.<br/>
Some ppl are wanting us to be able to vote yes or no on it but as of now<br/>
Brad isn&#39;t letting us vote<br/>
