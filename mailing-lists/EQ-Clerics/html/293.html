<div id="ygrps-yiv-35490723">Yes after lvl 9 fear becomes alot more effective and it will<br/>
save your ass many, mnay times to come believe this is where the fear+gate<br/>
combo works great. Invigor nah about useless really  un less when you get<br/>
hungry or thirsty and stop regaining hitpoints/stamina. sooth I never used<br/>
it but at 19 when calm comes around its a must. I can sit by myself at 20<br/>
and and calm bandits and take out a whole camp bymyself one by one. Damn<br/>
forgot what else I was going to say.<br/>

&gt;Others in this thread have offered good advice.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I remember running around one day at level 6 or 7, knocking off orc pawns,<br/>
&gt;skellies and pixie tricksters near Felwithe, just for their weapons. No xp,<br/>
&gt;but at the end of the day I had about 4 plat.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I second the idea of realizing that you are not going to be able to upgrade<br/>
&gt;your armor as soon as a warrior. I wore patchwork through level 10 or so,<br/>
&gt;when I began to replace it with ring. Not banded, too expensive. Ring is<br/>
&gt;lots cheaper, at least for a dwarf in Faydwer, because there&#39;s lots of it<br/>
&gt;coming out of Unrest, almost as high AC as banded. A little heavier, but<br/>

&gt;happened to be in a zone where a dark elf who was deleting her character<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Antonica.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Would you believe 8 pp for small bronze pauldrons?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;When buying armor, buy smart. Wait for good prices.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Like others, I killed bandits for the occasional bronze weapon, only these<br/>
&gt;were the bandits in Lesser Faydark. When I hit level 10, I started killing<br/>
&gt;minos, and mino axes, which I can always sell for 4 pp if I am patient,<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Finally, you don&#39;t need to buy all those spells available at level 9, right<br/>
&gt;away. I would buy:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    Summon Food (pays for itself in food costs)<br/>
&gt;    Center (Buffs R Us)<br/>
&gt;    Hammer of Wrath (a better weapon than you will be able to afford for a<br/>
&gt;while, probably, and it hits for magic to boot)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    If you still have money:<br/>
&gt;    Root<br/>
&gt;    Endure fire (useful for fighting ebon drakes)<br/>
&gt;    Sense the dead (not expensive, and a mana-cheap way of keeping your Div<br/>
&gt;skill up for the occasional use of Invis to Undead)<br/>
&gt;    Endure poison<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    I agree with the other poster who said that Word of Pain is an<br/>
&gt;invitation to have all the mobs attack you at once. And it is expensive in<br/>
&gt;mana to boot.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    And a question to everyone else: have you ever found much use in<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;Fear, and Invigor? Soothe sounds great, but I just haven&#39;t gotten much use<br/>
&gt;out of it. Fear is the same way. The one time I tried it, the feared bandit<br/>
&gt;ran backwards two feet, then came right back and was in my face, with the<br/>
&gt;other bandit I was figting. I think I died that time. And has anyone found<br/>
&gt;much use for Invigor?<br/>
