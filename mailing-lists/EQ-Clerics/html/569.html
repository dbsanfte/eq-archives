<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-701804160">ok i know today that the AE upgrade, word of healing does exist...heals<br/>
about the same as a greater heal, and i do believe it&#39;s lv 49....in any<br/>
case, it&#39;d be a welcome change on the higher levels with that wimpy<br/>
group healing....healing on higher levels is like using light heal in<br/>
the 30s....not much count...but if any of you happen to see where to<br/>
purchase this spell, please fill me in....&lt;i&#39;m just lazy and don&#39;t feel<br/>
like popping into all the cleric guilds in norrath trying to find it&gt; (;<br/>
