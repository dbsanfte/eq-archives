<div id="ygrps-yiv-1744152293">It seems to me that Verant does a lot of things weird.  Now a lot of<br/>
people compare the game to AD&D, so I&#39;ll do the same.  It seems<br/>
absurd to me to think that if the party kills a red dragon in AD&D,<br/>
for example, that they should expect the same kind of loot over and<br/>
over again.  Seems to me the game should have been more random in<br/>
terms of where items were found.  Sure jboots should be rare, but I<br/>
agree, to make them only appear on 1 person is just insane.  If they<br/>
are that rare, then they are unique, and then as soon as that person<br/>
got killed the owner would become the only person in the whole world<br/>
to have them.  These are called artifacts and are unique.  But this<br/>
kind of game has no room for artifacts.  In order to fully remove<br/>
camping, they need to stop making the items appear to just one<br/>
creature.  At the very least it seems that they could post something<br/>
saying that &quot;the jboot location has changed. so-and-so no longer has<br/>
them.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;I am certain that<br/>
&gt;unless I buy a pair off EBay or in-game, I will never own them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;they are no drop, so there is no way you can buy them from someone you have<br/>
&gt;to loot the corpse yourself for the boots.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And for those of you who have the boots and will<br/>
&gt;swear to me that it took you only a day to get them, I congratulate you on<br/>
&gt;your accomplishment.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It took my group 29 hours to get 4 pair of boots. I looted the first pair,<br/>
&gt;and had it within an hour. But the rest came with 6 hour differences or so.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I do beleive that items such as JBoots should be put on more than one NPC.<br/>
&gt;To have them only on Drezlna, is absolutely ridiculous. We had two kills of<br/>
&gt;ours stolen when we camped that 29 hours. Verant should put items such as<br/>
&gt;JBoots and Rubicite Armor on SEVERAL NPCs throughout Norrath. That way, <br/>
&gt;more<br/>
&gt;people will have a chance to own such items.....but I suppose that would<br/>
&gt;make too many people happy and Verant doesn&#39;t appear to have the happiness<br/>
&gt;of the customer in mind.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I agree that the servers need to capped. I even think 1000 on a server is<br/>
&gt;alot...I would love to see servers capped at 500. Wow,<br/>
&gt;would THAT be something =)<br/>
