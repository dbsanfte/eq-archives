<div id="ygrps-yiv-484208484">Befallen trip..<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We stayed on the FIRST<br/>
&gt; floor, of course, and<br/>
&gt; killed the skels and the rats.  We also killed<br/>
&gt; Lrodd, who gave us GREAT exp<br/>
&gt; back then.  I never went anywhere my entire P4 beta<br/>
&gt; days after level 9<br/>
&gt; except Befallen, and we levelled like crazy.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That has not changed one bit. The first floor is very<br/>
safe as long as you stay away from the one path all<br/>
trains follow, and away from the well. This will keep<br/>
you from fighting in the main room, and one side room<br/>
that is located above the spiral stairs. The rest of<br/>
the level is train free. There are plenty of skeletons<br/>
to go around, the shadowknight is there to kill for<br/>
fun, and lrodd for the incredible exp. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; In live, we went to Befallen about mid-teens I<br/>
&gt; think, and did well on the<br/>
&gt; second floor down.  The problem was there were a LOT<br/>
&gt; of trains. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Very true, the side area of the second floor is nasty<br/>
since there are a few necros and skeletons scattered<br/>
that will assist fights in adjoining rooms.<br/>
Essentially second floor is a waste since you die too<br/>
much from the trains on the third floor, and clearing<br/>
out the rooms to the female/ogre sk is really not<br/>
worth it. It&#39;s better to wait until level 16/17 and go<br/>
directly to level 3. Of course, this means in a<br/>
sizeable group. 4 level 17-20 characters can break the<br/>
spawn on the third level and then just clean up on exp<br/>
and items. The rewards for doing this are the Gossimer<br/>
robes/thaumaturgist robes/dagger of marnek/wand of<br/>
marnek/bone bladed claymore. <br/>
<br/>
In summary, incredible place for levels 9-12, great<br/>
place for levels 16-20 or so. The troubles people have<br/>
is when they either try to solo, or go to level 2/3 at<br/>
mid teen levels. <br/>
<br/>
I have done this with two clerics and a necro. :)<br/>
