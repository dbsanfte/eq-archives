<div id="ygrps-yiv-322078344">I play on the the Xegony server, and we do have trouble with KSing, but <br/>
doesn&#39;t seem to be as bad as it once was or maybe i have become more <br/>
patient, not sure.  but as far as the guildthing goes....have many guilds, <br/>
but i haven&#39;t noticed an overwhelming amount of one particular guild, some <br/>
have quite a few members, but never noticed any problems.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hi all.  I decided this would be a good place to put this, since everyone <br/>
&gt;has<br/>
&gt;good input on our class, while others refuse to help one another, I dunno.<br/>
&gt;Basically I currently play on veeshan server, and for months have been fed <br/>
&gt;up<br/>
&gt;with it.  Now I&#39;ve heard other ppl say (and could be rumors) that there is <br/>
&gt;less<br/>
&gt;ks&#39;ing on other servers, as well as not a dominate god guild like foh on <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;server.  (to Those of you possibly in FOH on this list, no offense, the <br/>
&gt;group of<br/>
&gt;friends I play with (UWS) as well as I have had bad run ins with your <br/>
&gt;guild.<br/>
&gt;Basically FoH and UWS has gone there...let&#39;s not do it again in here)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So basically my question to you is the server you play on how do you like <br/>
&gt;it?<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m seriously considereing abandoning all my characters on Veeshan to play <br/>
&gt;on a<br/>
&gt;better server.  This game is all about the playability in the environment, <br/>
&gt;which<br/>
&gt;veeshan seriously limits those not powerhungry play the game.<br/>
