<div id="ygrps-yiv-1718751239">It&#39;s the place where you buy spells, etc right near the guy that gives<br/>
you the SSOL.  So, in other words, if you walk more than 20 feet<br/>
trying to find the place, you&#39;ve walked too far.<br/>
<br/>
  And congratulations on your SSOL.<br/>

&gt;Well, it took me 2 trys, but i finally got the SSOL.  The first time the <br/>
&gt;guy<br/>
&gt;tried to attack me, even though i ran there with SoW.  I think however that<br/>
&gt;somone started the quest, but never finished it.  So the guy took it out on<br/>
&gt;me. :)  When i got the SSoL the guy told me to talk to Whysia  in the <br/>
&gt;Temple<br/>
&gt;Store House about recharging it.   Where is this Temple Store House?  <br/>
&gt;Anyway<br/>
&gt;I just wanted to say thanks for all the previous help.<br/>
