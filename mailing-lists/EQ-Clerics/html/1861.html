<div id="ygrps-yiv-46704986">It is very hard to explain, but I will attempt to.  1st warning - you must<br/>
either be able to gate or have a 2nd person with you, or you will be locked<br/>
in the cell.  Enter Paw and cross the first bridge.  The hall heads left<br/>
there and there are 3 doors at the end.  The left door leads to a overpass<br/>
over the area you came through, the right door leads deeper into the<br/>
dungeon.  The middle door leads to the jail cells.<br/>

&gt; As of when?  I did it just the other day on test and it still worked.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And isn&#39;t anyone going to answer my question about where the Paladin<br/>
&gt; is in Paw??!  :) </span></blockquote></div>
