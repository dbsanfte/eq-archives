<div id="ygrps-yiv-1610351760">Karlan, the first player to reach 50 was able to get another character to 50<br/>
in 17 days played.  I&#39;m pretty sure the first 20  levels took him no time at<br/>
all.<br/>

	My top character is level 16 (well 15 now, but that is a long<br/>
story..<br/>
he WAS 16) and made that in under 6 game days. A good deal of that was spent<br/>
dying and wandering. If I concentrate on him he should hit 20 in 10 game<br/>
days<br/>
easily and I would hardly consider myself experienced. I would bet a<br/>
twinked,<br/>
power leveled character can hit 20 in 5 days or less. I have a friend who<br/>
hit<br/>
20 in 6 days with his Barbarian Warrior.</div>
