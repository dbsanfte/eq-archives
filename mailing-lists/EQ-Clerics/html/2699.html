<div id="ygrps-yiv-1349516409"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; 1. Are high elf clerics the lowest leveling race/class in the game?<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d heard that at least high elves leveled about the slowest, and my<br/>
&gt; observations seem to lend itself to that assumption.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have no idea how fast or slow other races level... I do know that I level<br/>
pretty slowly (I am a high elf) but whether that is because of my race or<br/>
the way I play/places I hunt I cannot say.<br/>

&gt; 2. I&#39;ve got all the pieces for my caduceus of the sacrement.  The<br/>
&gt; thing from Mistmoore, the piece from the darkbone giant skel, and two<br/>
&gt; plat bars.  When I go to Ro temple, and I give the bars to the person<br/>
&gt; to magnetize them, do I give them 1 bar at a time?  Also, do I give<br/>
&gt; all 4 things to the person (is it Gavel?) at the same time, with the<br/>
&gt; 2 bars in each box, filling up the 4 total slots (bar, bar, ingot,<br/>
&gt; icon)?  I don&#39;t want to screw it up!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You give the enchanted platinum bars to the guy to magnatize them one at a<br/>
time.  Each time you give him one, a magnatized one will appear in your<br/>
inventory.  It should be able to place them in bags, but I&#39;d have one of<br/>
your 8 slots totally open for safety.   When you turn in all 4 items, you<br/>
can give him all at once or one at a time... either way works.  If you give<br/>
him everything at once, make sure you separate the 2 magnatized bars of<br/>
platinum.  Don&#39;t give them to him stacked.<br/>
<br/>
On a related note, if you ever have a non-cleric friend who has looted an<br/>
ingot or an icon and you have all the other stuff to complete the quest you<br/>
can do the quest with his ingot/icon even though it is no-drop.  Just have<br/>
him go to Sol Ro with you, and have him turn in his piece to the appropriate<br/>
person first.  After he turns in his ingot/icon you turn in all of your<br/>
stuff and you will get your armor.   All quests are like this so far as I<br/>
know... the person who turns in the final quest item gets the credit for the<br/>
quest and the item.<br/>

&gt; 3. Is Aviak Isle a good place to solo at 26th level?  I just made 26th<br/>
&gt; and while I don&#39;t know if I can take gull or not, I&#39;d like to give it<br/>
&gt; the ol&#39; college try (if I see him).  But I&#39;m curious if I could solo<br/>
&gt; here with relative safety.  I&#39;d hate to pull one blue and have 14<br/>
&gt; birds jump me, with nowhere to run to. How does one leave this island?<br/>
&gt; Gate away?  Is this the island right near the Butcherblock pier?  Any<br/>
&gt; solo&#39;ing tips here are appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You should be ok at 26th level to solo there.  I am not sure how good the xp<br/>
will be because you&#39;ll have to med a lot but you should be able to survive<br/>
just fine.   The aviaks should not attack you unless you attack them first..<br/>
but be careful becasue they will help each other if they see you fighting<br/>
one.   Pull one that is away from any others all the way to the edge of the<br/>
island to fight one at a time.   The Quetzels are the toughest aviaks there<br/>
and they hit pretty hard... root and blast them.   The Tanagers are the<br/>
second toughest... but you shouldn&#39;t have a problem with them.  I suspect<br/>
they will be blue to you but I don&#39;t know exactly what levels things are<br/>
there.    At 26th, Gull will be a real challenge since I&#39;ve heard he is 25.<br/>
I am sure you can come close though with the root and blast method....<br/>
good luck to you!    I&#39;ve been looking for him for several weeks now and<br/>
have yet to see him spawn.<br/>
<br/>
As for escape... gating away is the only way.  Be bound on the BB pier... if<br/>
you are bound on another island in OOT the birds will follow you.. though<br/>
they may have a long way to swim to get to you =)   It is not the island<br/>
near the BB pier btw... its&#39; a long swim no matter where you try to get to<br/>
it from.   If you are coming from freeport, you can take the boat to the<br/>
rocks right before BB and get off there and start swimming north... if you<br/>
are going from BB you can go to the first island and then start swimming<br/>
north... I don&#39;t have a map near me to look.. i believe the coords are<br/>
2000,-4000... or -2000,4000.  I get the positive and negative mixed up...<br/>
but the numbers are right =).<br/>
