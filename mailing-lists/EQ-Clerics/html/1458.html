<div id="ygrps-yiv-1144253792">the pelts USED to work....just like the ale quest from freeport it was<br/>
removed though.  They beleive that it was too easy to up your faction and<br/>
they changed it.  I got pelts from a friend, AND slaughtered like 30 of the<br/>
lil buggers and, with the same patch that killed the Ale quest in freeport,<br/>
found the factions were now screwed in Qeynos too with easy quests.<br/>

I will agree the oil and prayer beads are a better form of gaining faction, <br/>
however when I stated skellies and pelts I was not speculating I was stating<br/>
<br/>
fact, I personally used the skellies and pelts ONLY to raise my faction at <br/>
the time(it was a quite awhile ago). My paladin friend however used the <br/>
quests in conjunction with the others to help himself.<br/>

&gt;the skeles I can not confirm.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Oil, the prayer beads and turning in skele bone chips does work.  The one<br/>
&gt;where you get a moonstone works.....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;PELTS....doesnt.  It (unless they changed it last patch) was &quot;fixed&quot;  Not<br/>
&gt;even the fleshy orb gave anything.....I tried this for over 10 hours....and<br/>
&gt;learned the factions for temple of life ;)  the prayer beads quest is a <br/>
&gt;VERy<br/>
&gt;nice faction upper btw.  but long.<br/>

&gt;Our guildmaster, who is a paladin, just recently needed to raise his <br/>
&gt;faction<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;with the priests of Life, in order to obtain his soulfire sword.<br/>
&gt;Basically what we did to help raise his faction was:<br/>
&gt;1) killing putrid skellies in South Karana(at Grimrots Camp)<br/>
&gt;2) Turning in diseased animal pelts to the Temple of Life<br/>
&gt;3) Doing the Blessed oil Quest til he turned green<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;These will all raise your faction there. Even I, a person who originally<br/>
&gt;came from the temple of Life, needed to raise my faction in order to do the<br/>
&gt;quest. But to be quite honest, I did the quest simply cause I had never <br/>
&gt;done<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;a quest before, I tried the weapon out like once to see what the effect was<br/>
&gt;and it has sat in the bank ever since.<br/>

&gt; &gt;I keep reading that everyone on here loves to use there SSOL.  I would <br/>
&gt;like<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;to get this weapon as well.  I am a human cleric from the Temple of Marr <br/>
&gt;in<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Freeport.  Will i have problems trying to do the quest, or will i be ok?<br/>
&gt; &gt;Just want to make sure, before I make that loooong journy from freeport <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt; &gt;qeynos.  Thanks<br/>
