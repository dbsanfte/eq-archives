&gt; Hello,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This might be a silly plead for advice but here it is...I am restarting my<br/>
&gt; cleric on a new server.  My old cleric is a high elf female.  I am torn<br/>
&gt; between restarting as a dark elf or stick with the high elf.  Which in<br/>
&gt; y&#39;all&#39;s opinion...looks better?  I have never seen a dark elf in the purple<br/>
&gt; armor...do they look silly?  Does the purple make em look like a blueberry<br/>
&gt; and grape mix?  I have never seen a dark elf in the yellow quest armor as<br/>
&gt; well.  I do like the way the dark elf females look but given the color<br/>
&gt; scheme I might not be able to live with myself if the color is too much of<br/>
&gt; an offense to my fashion sense =).  The only thing I do not like about the<br/>
&gt; high elf females is the face...they look too haughty. Although I have to<br/>
&gt; admit that plate armor looks really good on the females.  However, another<br/>
&gt; reluctance is the fact that there just seems to be more high elves cleric<br/>
&gt; then dark elves...yeah I know the stat is better...but I want to look my<br/>
&gt; best as well and be unique ;)  Anyway advise is appreciated...thanks.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; These are female characters I am talking about.<br/>
