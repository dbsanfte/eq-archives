  I too hate the stun effect, but i&#39;ve gotten used to it by now and<br/>
accept it as part of EQ life.  However, what I would like to see<br/>
added to the Divine Aura line is maybe a running acceleration for 5<br/>
or 10 seconds during the first part of DA.  <br/>
  How many of you have casted DA only to crawl about 2 steps and<br/>
die, leaving your corpse in a worse situation than when you started?<br/>
Most clerics usually have about a bub or less by the time they DA,<br/>
and with that much health left, you basically walk when trying<br/>
to run.  An extra burst of speed just for a few seconds would give<br/>
us just a tad more chance of escaping or at least dying in a more<br/>
corpse &quot;friendly&quot; area. =)  <br/>
<br/>
Just a thought,<br/>
