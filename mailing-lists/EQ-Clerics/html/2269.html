<div id="ygrps-yiv-1522122061"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Well, I consider myself to be under equipped for my level (getting harder to <br/>
&gt;say that now that I have some purple stuff) as I have had a few items for <br/>
&gt;almost 30 levels now.  Anyway I&#39;ll give you a run down on the items I wear.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How about posting a list of what you were wearing at the milestones (lvl<br/>
10, lvl 20, etc) That way we could see what we should be looking for when<br/>
we reach those levels.</div>
