<div id="ygrps-yiv-1780917915">2 Extra bars of Mana????? I find that impossible, I have tested the Wisdom<br/>
item theory.  Let me say this my base Wisdom was 89, with all the items I<br/>
had that added wisdom, i was at 124.<br/>
I conducted a test...I removed all of my Wisdom granting items so my wis was<br/>
89. I began to cast Greater healing ( I did not fizzle) I was able to cast<br/>
it 5 times( 150 per cast).....I then tried to cast Holy Might ( 35 per<br/>
cast ) and was unbable to.....<br/>
<br/>
I then put all of my WIS items back on so my wis was 124 i once again cast<br/>
greater healing 5 times ( no fizzle 150 per cast)....with the BS MANA I had<br/>
left over i was able to cast ONE holy might (35 MANA) and one flash of light<br/>
(12 MANA). SO, with this test i have decided that instead of using ALL my<br/>
item slots to try to bring up wisdom, which is a complete waste of time, I<br/>
would get some really good wis Items( like plus 6 wis ring, Adementite<br/>
epolets, ETC) and i would replace some items with DEX, yes DEX increasings<br/>
items.<br/>
<br/>
DEX does directly affect your ability to cast while being hit, not to<br/>
mention if you have a weapon that randomly casts an effect, DEX plays a<br/>
great part in how Often it works.  I have seen it make a difference with our<br/>
regular gnome wizard, who naturally has a high DEX( she is over 115)She can<br/>
literally cast almost any spell while being hit,I will estimate that she is<br/>
interrupted only 10% of the time, I have seen her Gate from terrible<br/>
situations while being completely pounded and my in-game husband, has found<br/>
great success with his DEX over 105 now, Our Paladins DEX is 117, and even<br/>
though he has no DD spells, his Ghoulbane is much much more effective<br/>
against the undead, My DEX is now 100 and I have seen a difference in my<br/>
casting, then gnome and I were medding in Soluseks eye ons day when someoen<br/>
trained a boat load of nasties by us, they took an extreme liking to me, I<br/>
was able to cast greater heal on myself 5 successive times without being<br/>
interrupted.<br/>
So, that is my rant, i feel very strongly about it, WIS is good don&#39;t get me<br/>
wrong, but there will NEVER be a way to add enough wisdom to make a really<br/>
big difference in the Mana that I have. SO i sacfrifice a small amount of<br/>
mana, while gaining a better ability to help people while in battle, I think<br/>
the trade off is fair. By the way,  Yes channeling is a great factor in<br/>
recovering as well.<br/>
