Hmmm.... you make some very good points, however I think you are too general. <br/>
For myself U can echo a lot of what you say. <br/>
<br/>
I came here with friends from another game, which I still play, and we have <br/>
had our differences - still firends - but differences on how we wish to play.<br/>
<br/>
I role play, and the best way I have found to role play is to play solo - at <br/>
my clerics level now I find it harder and harder, it would be much better for <br/>
me to group if levelling was my priority. More power is useful, it opens more <br/>
places to me in a safer way. I was much slower at first in gaining power than <br/>
my friends because I would explore, visit the taverns - and always I would be <br/>
there alone. The bartender is a little slow on conversation ;-).<br/>
<br/>
The game itself is a stage to me, role plating is perfectly possible, the <br/>
difficulty as you have found is finding others to role play with you. The <br/>
stage is very big, and there are role players out there... at different <br/>
levels, some at early stages of learning, could include myself there - I am <br/>
not so skilled as a player in a text based tavern that played a stool for the <br/>
whole night, a magical stool yes but a stool personality - verrrrry funny <br/>
too, didn&#39;t like guys sitting on him ;-).<br/>
<br/>
I have developed another charachter that is better at soloing, and have my <br/>
favourite type of charachter [sorry I do love clerics too] waiting for a <br/>
realistic update to its abilities - classically a soloing charachter.<br/>
<br/>
Leaving here isn&#39;t the answer, the land is there to role play in. The <br/>
elements are there - ok, quests could be more interesting and thats a little <br/>
disappointing for now - but set your own quests. I don&#39;t camp, I take risks <br/>
for others in my role as cleric - I have my own path that dictates who and <br/>
how I help as I travel around. I have some friends that role play, and some <br/>
who are developing role play, some that want to role play if they could work <br/>
it out, and some that power game and camp...  imagination is the key, if I am <br/>
around people strangers or friends that start to turn my dreamland into <br/>
reality then I make my exit.<br/>
<br/>
I have zero problem with how people want to play this game, it is my escapism <br/>
from the real world - if people ask me what level I am then they get an <br/>
answer based on the charachter I am playing... my dwarven cleric is a little <br/>
surly and gets some hmmm misunderstood comments but that doesn&#39;t really <br/>
matter to me, I still try and explain ooc so that some can have a glimpse of <br/>
what they may be missing out on.<br/>
<br/>
There is supposed to be a race war server starting, that could, and should, <br/>
lend itself to role playing.<br/>
<br/>
Finally.... there are those doing their best to role play, they are maybe few <br/>
and far between and maybe keep it to themselves too much because they&#39;ve <br/>
given up finding others... however, if you leave then that&#39;s one less. For <br/>
me, I stay and will keep to my path[s], this is a young place yet... give it <br/>
a chance, and role play your heart out and maybe you will find more people <br/>
sitting round the camp fire with you telling you about far places you have <br/>
yet to visit....<br/>
