<b>Subject:</b> New Cleric heal spell idea..... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-917347028">I think once they come out with the add-on and give us new lvls and new<br/>
spells one cool idea for a heal spell is....... A spell you cast say before<br/>
you fight and it works like the Bards heal song and heals you a little over<br/>
time.  Have a icon the shows up like any buffs you have on a stay for 5-10<br/>
mins.  Maybe later do a group heal spell like this one.  I&#39;m not saying to<br/>
have to heal us or someone says a lot but just a little over time, maybe<br/>
have a few, (depends on how many lvls they give us), and say the first one<br/>
does 5 heal points so many secs, the next one does 20 every so many secs.<br/>
Just an idea.  What do you all think on that idea?<br/>
