<b>Subject:</b> Where can I find Greater Heal?! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-455727652">OK last night I searched the Hall of Truth and the cleric guild in Freeport<br/>
and Can-Not-Find the stupid greater heal spell.  I just ran all the way from<br/>
South Karana and before I ran allll the way back to Qeynos, I just need to<br/>
know if the greater heal spell can be found in Qeynos.  Anyone knows?  Also,<br/>
maybe there is a vendor hidden somewhere in the cleric guild and I wasn&#39;t<br/>
able to find him/her in Freeport...can the greater heal spell be found in<br/>
Freeport at all?  Help.<br/>
