<div id="ygrps-yiv-2085337447"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; can learn them.  I was just wondering if anybody can tell me<br/>
&gt; anything about the Divine Barrier spell?  I know that it is an<br/>
&gt; upgrade to Divine Aura, but what does it improve on?  Does it<br/>
&gt; last longer?  It can&#39;t possibly cast any quicker or cost less<br/>
&gt; mana =).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hello,<br/>
<br/>
Well the good thing about Divine Barrier is that you can cast it right after<br/>
Divine aura.  Gives you more time to make it to the zone. =)<br/>
