<div id="ygrps-yiv-1152472106">Well, I consider myself to be under equipped for my level (getting harder to <br/>
say that now that I have some purple stuff) as I have had a few items for <br/>
almost 30 levels now.  Anyway I&#39;ll give you a run down on the items I wear.<br/>
<br/>
+3 wis earring (2)           (can&#39;t remember what they are called)<br/>
+6 wis ring (2)              (ditto)<br/>
Runed Circlet                4ac +4wis/int<br/>
BI Medallion                 +3 wis/int  (have had this forever it seems)<br/>
Plat ruby veil               +7 wis/st<br/>
Mirthil BP                   17ac +15 agi<br/>
Mirthil Bracer (2)           4ac +3st +5wis<br/>
Adamentium Epaulets (sp?)    9ac +7wis<br/>
Charred boots                6ac +3agi +fire/pois I think<br/>
Charred guardian shield      10ac +9wis<br/>
Caduceus of Sacrament        or my shovel for 2hb :)<br/>
Bronze gloves                woo hoo<br/>
Bronze cloak                 don&#39;t see L50&#39;s with bronze everyday<br/>
Ethernal Mist Vembracers     15ac +9st +magic  (was plat armband)<br/>
Ethernal Mist Leggings       14ac +5st/agi +9wis +dis/pois (was gator legs)<br/>
Girdle of the Diligent       10ac +5wis/sta (was belt of the river)<br/>
<br/>
All those stats are just from memory so I&#39;m sure there are some errors.  I <br/>
have never enjoyed camping for stuff especially when no exp is involved <br/>
(hence the cloak) and I refuse to pay some of the prices people want for <br/>
stuff.  As an example this past weekend at the bazaar someone was selling a <br/>
nightshade wreath (1ac +5wis/int) and the opening bid was 2k plat (not like I <br/>
even have that much).  Now compare this to the runed circlet which I paid 400 <br/>
plat for and tell me if it&#39;s worth another 1600 plat.<br/>
