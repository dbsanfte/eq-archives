<div id="ygrps-yiv-1424959716">Seems to me that Verant is widening the gap between your average players<br/>
(like me) who &quot;used&quot; to enjoy playing EQ, and the POWERlevelers, who now<br/>
have a distinct advantage. Not only can they successfully keep other<br/>
lower- to mid-level players from camping nice spawn spots (aviak guards<br/>
in Lake Rathe comes to mind), but now they have a new creature to hunt.<br/>
The rest of us will have to move over to make room for the exodus of<br/>
mid-level players running for their lives out of Oasis.<br/>
<br/>
BEGIN RANT:<br/>
If Verant wants to nix camping, they should make more lower- to<br/>
mid-level mobs, and then restrict the server to 1,000 players. Would<br/>
that be so difficult to do? As for the incredibly insane camping that<br/>
goes on in places like Najena (for the journeyman boots), I really don&#39;t<br/>
know how to address that. As it stands now, though, I am certain that<br/>
unless I buy a pair off EBay or in-game, I will never own them. I can&#39;t<br/>
afford to spend one to two weeks camped for 18 hours a day, fighting the<br/>
kill/loot stealers. And that&#39;s NOT sour grapes. That&#39;s just how it is,<br/>
friends and neighbors. And for those of you who have the boots and will<br/>
swear to me that it took you only a day to get them, I congratulate you<br/>
on your accomplishment.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I read on another post that with the new patch they did a few changes <br/>
&gt;with<br/>
&gt; &gt; the Oasis.<br/>
&gt; &gt; This is what the post said<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;Ok new news on this one... if anyone has hunted there before you know <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt; typical problems of avoiding sand giant, spectres, and sometimes<br/>
&gt; &gt; Tarantualla<br/>
&gt; &gt; whatever his name is. Well they are chicken feed.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; As of patch we now have deepwater goblins. Shamans over 35+ with the <br/>
&gt;wolf<br/>
&gt; &gt; pets running around the beach of Oasis. Are they aggressive? YES Are <br/>
&gt;they<br/>
&gt; &gt; strong? HELL YES<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Last night I witnessed one clean the beach between 2nd and 1st rock, <br/>
&gt;then<br/>
&gt; &gt; kill a SAND GIANT and go back to the water for a swim. Apparently the <br/>
&gt;Gods<br/>
&gt; &gt; have decided they did not appreciate our camping along the beach. Party<br/>
&gt; &gt; time<br/>
&gt; &gt; is over.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; They also added cistern asps. No biggie probably 14th level or so.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; So if this is 100% true and you&#39;re around Lvl 35 or lower you might <br/>
&gt;wanna<br/>
&gt; &gt; be<br/>
&gt; &gt; extra careful there.<br/>
