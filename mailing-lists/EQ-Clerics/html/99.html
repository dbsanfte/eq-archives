<b>Subject:</b> re to clerics and armor <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-68749404">I chose the high-elf cleric due to the higher wis.<br/>
and placed all the points I could into wisdom. <br/>
Sure my Str. is only 60 base and is up to 70 with<br/>
magic items.  I don&#39;t plan to ever be decked out<br/>
in the best armor.  A cleric is not a front line<br/>
weapon.  At higher levels I hope to never run out<br/>
of mana and hope to never let my friends die.  So<br/>
with this in mind it doesn&#39;t make a difference to<br/>
me to have a set of Full plate which I still may<br/>
but doubt it.<br/>
