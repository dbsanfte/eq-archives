&quot;I wish Verant would just leave things alone and fix the things that<br/>
need<br/>
fixed like Plan of Fear, Rogues and things like that and stop making<br/>
classes<br/>
weaker.&quot;<br/>

I reply:<br/>

Yeah, it would be nice if they would do smart things like that. For<br/>
example, FINISH the damn cities, for God&#39;s sake! Why is Qeynos the only<br/>
city in norrath that is complete?? (maybe because Brad&#39;s character lives<br/>
near there???) Qeynos is the only city where EVERY npc will talk to you<br/>
AND to each other. It&#39;s the only city to have a message board where<br/>
players can leave messages to one another. It&#39;s the only city to have<br/>
cool catacombs and underground.<br/>
<br/>
Sighhh...and why do barbarian males have no animation for when they hold<br/>
a shield?<br/>
<br/>
I could go on and on and on...C&#39;mon Verant, stop the insanity! You are<br/>
acting like the evil MUD gods of other games who destroyed a good thing<br/>
by paying too much attention to so-called &quot;balance&quot; while not listening<br/>
to the cries of the players, who are the most important commodity you<br/>
have. The game is fine as it is...please don&#39;t keep doing this. And if<br/>
you must &quot;balance&quot; things, then GIVE rather than TAKE. Please.<br/>
