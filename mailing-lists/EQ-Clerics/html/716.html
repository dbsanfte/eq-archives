&gt;Druids are complaining about the doubling of our succor spells.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; and don&#39;t get me started on the no cleric only weapons......that and the<br/>
&gt; &gt; fact that we can&#39;t wear all mithril like warriors or pallies....only<br/>
&gt; &gt; thing we can wear is the bp and the bracers...no sleeves, no <br/>
&gt;greeves.....<br/>
&gt; &gt; what gives? it&#39;s all plate claases EXCEPT for clerics<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hey! At least you can wear some of it. Druids are left off of all the<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;And druids don&#39;t get druid-only weapons either.<br/>
