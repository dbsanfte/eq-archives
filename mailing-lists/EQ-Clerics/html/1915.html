<div id="ygrps-yiv-1406674917">IMHO, you should&#39;ve put your pts into wisdom and if you were going to put<br/>
some into another stat, agility.  Normal  plate is too heavy, and has no<br/>
wisdom enhancements, only AC.  You want items that give you wisdom.  And at<br/>
high levels, you shouldh&#39;t be getting hit much, if at all, if your tanks are<br/>
doing their jobs.  I have sacrificed AC for wisdom, and have no regrets.<br/>
Agility will keep you from getting hit as often, also.   Understand now,<br/>
this is at HIGH levels.  Which is what your goal should ultimately be.<br/>

&gt; 170 wisdom?!?!  Ack...that has to be a joke for me.<br/>
&gt; With my base wisdom of 103 and me being fairly new,<br/>
&gt; the only way I will be able to get wisdom items is<br/>
&gt; from killing the mobs myself (which means I will have<br/>
&gt; to be fairly high to even get any good items)...Being<br/>
&gt; new I can&#39;t afford them items as of now; plus I hear<br/>
&gt; we clerics are very poor for a LONG while cause we<br/>
&gt; have to buy armor and spells...which so far seems to<br/>
&gt; be true.  In all honestly did I do the right thing by<br/>
&gt; putting my strength up to 100 (I read a guide that<br/>
&gt; said I should so I could wear full plate) or should I<br/>
&gt; have just pilled all my points in wisdom?<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hate to discourage you, but at higher levels, you<br/>
&gt; &gt; will melee VERY little.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Your value is healing and buffing.  And the damage<br/>
&gt; &gt; you will be able to do<br/>
&gt; &gt; against high level mobs is very minimal.  You will<br/>
&gt; &gt; be fighting mobs with<br/>
&gt; &gt; 1000s of hps at high levels, and a lot of them have<br/>
&gt; &gt; very high magic<br/>
&gt; &gt; resistance, so your spells are useless cause they<br/>
&gt; &gt; are resisted most always.<br/>
&gt; &gt; And these mobs hit HARD...some for over 100 hps<br/>
&gt; &gt; damage a pop.  You can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; survive at melee with these mobs, only the big tanks<br/>
&gt; &gt; can.  You serve one<br/>
&gt; &gt; purpose mainly, and that is healing to keep everyone<br/>
&gt; &gt; alive. Regarding<br/>
&gt; &gt; undead,  clerics used to be able to solo specs quite<br/>
&gt; &gt; easily with undead<br/>
&gt; &gt; spells, but they changed the pathing of them at the<br/>
&gt; &gt; spec cave in Feerott and<br/>
&gt; &gt; now it&#39;s dangerous cause you can&#39;t really pull them<br/>
&gt; &gt; solo anymore.  You pull<br/>
&gt; &gt; one and two or three come, and that&#39;s BAD news.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Regarding the mana issue....you will need to get<br/>
&gt; &gt; your hands on as many<br/>
&gt; &gt; wisdom enhancing items as you can, because you will<br/>
&gt; &gt; need all the mana you<br/>
&gt; &gt; can get to increase the effectiveness and efficiency<br/>
&gt; &gt; of your healing powers.<br/>
&gt; &gt; The more mana you have the longer you can keep your<br/>
&gt; &gt; group alive and the less<br/>
&gt; &gt; med time you have.  So start amassing those wisdom<br/>
&gt; &gt; items and try to get your<br/>
&gt; &gt; wisdom at least up into the 170s minimum.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Sorry to disillusion you, but high levels clerics<br/>
&gt; &gt; are relegated mostly to<br/>
&gt; &gt; healing and buffing and medding.  That&#39;s what your<br/>
&gt; &gt; specialty is and at those<br/>
&gt; &gt; levels, the other healing classes can&#39;t come close<br/>
&gt; &gt; to our healing powers<br/>
&gt; &gt; with our superior and complete heal.  The good news<br/>
&gt; &gt; is that no high level<br/>
&gt; &gt; group ventures anywhere without at least one good<br/>
&gt; &gt; cleric.  YOu are a MUST<br/>
&gt; &gt; have.<br/>
