I had some trouble doing it in that I had to go from dubious to good<br/>
amiable in quyenos. Not that difficult, but time consuming. <br/>
<br/>
Cleanse does exactly what you described. Random cleaning effect which<br/>
is nice in places like befallen where there are a ton of DoT spells and<br/>
disease from undead.<br/>
<br/>
You can get the mace recharged in the store room in Quyenos by someone<br/>
whose name sarts with W something(since I am at work i don&#39;t have my<br/>
notes :)) <br/>
<br/>
20pp? *sigh* Once more back to collecting silver pieces to save enough<br/>
for my spells.<br/>
<br/>
On another note, the delivering the note to the paladin in splitpaw<br/>
quest, is a great quest for people in their higher teens, since on<br/>
completion you receive a random clerical spell from levels 19, 24, or<br/>
29. This has saved me a fair amount of money already.<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Clerics have a hard time doing the quest?  LOL i am<br/>
&gt; a human cleric and had <br/>
&gt; no troule doing said quest, in fact it was one of<br/>
&gt; the easier ones i have <br/>
&gt; done.  Now for my question, what exactly does clense<br/>
&gt; do?  I was under the <br/>
&gt; impression that it took of negitive effects on the<br/>
&gt; player, tho it always <br/>
&gt; seems to clense me when i dont need it, and there<br/>
&gt; are only 30 charges on it. <br/>
&gt;   I have no clue how to get it recharged.  I am a<br/>
&gt; lvl 24 cleric on Xegony, <br/>
&gt; and am now using a screaming mace which i perfer,<br/>
&gt; the SSoL was nice, fast, <br/>
&gt; and consistant in the amount of damg it did, but the<br/>
&gt; effect was wasted on my <br/>
&gt; toon as i never seem to get many neg effects on me. <br/>
&gt; Suffice it to say I <br/>
&gt; gave my SSoL to a noobie that was begging, LOL he<br/>
&gt; loved it and i was happy <br/>
&gt; to help, as far as what it is worth, i have no clue<br/>
&gt; as i would pay nothing <br/>
&gt; over 20p for it and thats going above the value to<br/>
&gt; me.  It&#39;s prob worth alot <br/>
&gt; to ppl who want them badly and less to others that<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t.   just INHO, stay <br/>
&gt; safe and have fun<br/>
&gt; <br/>
