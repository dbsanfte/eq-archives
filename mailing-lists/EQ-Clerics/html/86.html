<div id="ygrps-yiv-871810346">Heh i&#39;ve heard that the green splinted platemail is only acquirable by a<br/>
full group of level 50 people.  VERY hard plus rare i would suppose.  So our<br/>
chances of getting right now would not be very high :)<br/>

&gt;the plate he was probably talking about is green splinted platemail..<br/>
&gt;only setback to it is that it is VERY rare and is only wearable by human<br/>
&gt;sized characters.  but..  it does have very high AC and magical<br/>
&gt;bonuses.. not to mention that it&#39;s EXTREMELY light.  the gauntlets alone<br/>
&gt;on it have 12 ac and like +10 str..  and that&#39;s just for the hands.  one<br/>
&gt;can only imagine what the breasplate gives.  even monks can wear this<br/>
&gt;plate..  weird huh.  In my opinion, this platemail should be available<br/>
&gt;to all sizes, not just the human sized players.  kinda sucks to be a<br/>
&gt;large or small race.  EQ has done some very screwd up things.  Clerics<br/>
&gt;get stiffed a ton.<br/>
