&gt; Norrath.  My personal opinion is that we should always be merciful to those <br/>
&gt; around us, and help in any way we can.  Even if to heal someone we don&#39;t even <br/>
&gt; know completely depletes our mana.  What do you think of this?  <br/>

But Innoruk is the God of Hate and Pain. Pain is real. You can&#39;t<br/>
avoid it. of all the gods, he is the only one honest with his followers.<br/>
He WANTS us killing everything. So why should I use the powers he gives<br/>
me on those who do not followhim, and will actively work against him?</div>
