<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-453286008">Ok..  I can&#39;t see why anyone would waste a spot in their spells for<br/>
gate.  That&#39;s what divine aura is for.  Divine aura is there to save<br/>
your ass.. and you can stay til the lasst minute with it.  Gate takes<br/>
much longer to cast and doesn&#39;t seem nearly as reliable.  Here&#39;s what<br/>
spells I keep memmed.<br/>
<br/>
(When fighting Undead)<br/>
Center (too lazy to take out and put back in.. saves time)<br/>
Invis vs undead (play in unrest and you&#39;ll see why it&#39;s memmed)<br/>
Root (makes it easier for me to solo..  also helps me get away)<br/>
Smite (never know when some normal monster will jump ya)<br/>
Fear (effective way to get those mobs off the casters.. and you)<br/>
Expulse undead (self explanatory)<br/>
Divine aura (i can heal til the end for my group and try to get any mobs<br/>
on me..  then once group is safe i can go divine aura and almost always<br/>
make it out alive.. along with my entire group)<br/>
Healing (self explanatory)<br/>
<br/>
(When fighting normal stuff)<br/>
Center (same reason as above)<br/>
Fear (same as above)<br/>
Root (same as above)<br/>
Soothe (keeps those pesky low lvl mobs from goin agro on ya)<br/>
Smite (self explanatory)<br/>
Word of Pain (does decent area dam for mana cost.. also can get ALL the<br/>
mobs on you so group can escape if needed)<br/>
Divine Aura  (same as above)<br/>
Healing (same as above)<br/>
<br/>
I just can&#39;t see why some of you have so many DD spells in.  You&#39;re a<br/>
CLERIC.  You are here to heal.. to keep the people alive.  The reason<br/>
behind your spells should be to keep the group alive and yourself. <br/>
Remember that.  Only 2 people have died that I&#39;ve grouped with.  Both<br/>
were unavoidable.  (who can stop a train of 12, yes 12, angry mobs.. <br/>
most of which were yellow or red)</div>
