<div id="ygrps-yiv-1096830654">I don&#39;t know about all scores, but I do know that the benefits of a<br/>
high charisma seem to peg around 100 when trading with merchants.  Two<br/>
friends of mine tested a charisma of 95 versus a charisma of 110+ and<br/>
the price of items was the same.  So there is a cap on that one.<br/>
(unless you&#39;re an enchanter, and the higher the charisma the better)<br/>
<br/>
My theory on combat stats is that it matches your stat versus some<br/>
combat number of the creature.  My 2hblunt was like 20 points off max<br/>
and I was fighting orcs in highhold, and it shot through the roof, and<br/>
now it is 1 point off max.  I noticed an incredible increase in the<br/>
amount of damage that I did, and the amount of times I was hitting.<br/>
When I walk through newbie zones I always kill faction things like<br/>
orcs and gnolls, and it seems like I always hit them for 25 (with my<br/>
BF hammer).  So to make a long story short, I think the skill itself<br/>
has a lot to do with the skill of the enemy.  It matches your number<br/>
against theirs, and the difference is apparently how well you do when<br/>
you hit it.  Or something like that.  That&#39;s my theory anyway.<br/>
<br/>
  So, bottomline, I think the higher the score, the better, but only<br/>
against more and more powerful creatures.<br/>

&gt;Subject: [EQ-Clerics] A Question on Stats...<br/>
&gt;Date: Tue, 12 Oct 1999 09:58:20 -0500<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;A question about stats...Does the law of diminishing returns come into<br/>
&gt;play with our stats? Specifically, do we get less of a return on stats<br/>
&gt;the higher they go? My agility is currently 141, and my dexterity is<br/>
&gt;129...should I continue to try to find stat increasing items, or will it<br/>
&gt;matter at all if I have 5 or 6 more agi than I do now? In fact, does it<br/>
&gt;matter very much after 100?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Just curious, that&#39;s all :)<br/>
