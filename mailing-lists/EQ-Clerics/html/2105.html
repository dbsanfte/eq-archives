<div id="ygrps-yiv-2102599608">Evertorn, the biggest kept secret in EQ is the test server.  Last<br/>
night at peak there were 336 people on.  There were about a dozen<br/>
people in Unrest.  There are a few guilds, but none all that large.<br/>
I have a guild called &quot;Hand of Tunare&quot; that has 10 members.  The<br/>
people are all friendly and helpful.<br/>
Pros:<br/>
I&#39;ve never had anyone kill-steal anything I was fighting.<br/>
Camping is not nearly as difficult, since there is not as much<br/>
competition for the stuff.<br/>
Several zones are usually always empty.  Splitpaw, Runnyeye, Befallen.<br/>
People are very friendly and helpful.  The other night, in North<br/>
Freeport, a 45th level fighter gave me (yes, gave) a black enameled<br/>
mace!<br/>
We get all the new patches first.<br/>
Cons:<br/>
No GM support.  Which is almost a pro, since it encourages more<br/>
team-work.  If your body is in a hard to reach spot, you have to get<br/>
friends together to get it.  The GM support isn&#39;t non-existent, but<br/>
very rare, at least.<br/>
Not very many people.  At higher levels, it may be difficult to get<br/>
a group together.  Sometimes it&#39;s difficult to get binds in towns.<br/>
How you gonna get a bind when you&#39;re the only one in Rivervale?<br/>
Test goes down; sometimes often, and sometimes in the worst places.<br/>
I died 3 times one night in Befallen when the server went down while<br/>
I was in the middle of the second level.<br/>
<br/>
The Test Server has a special executable, found in the everquest<br/>
directory.  When it loads, there is only one server choice - test<br/>
server.<br/>
<br/>
If you decide to come to test server, look me up.  I got a bronze<br/>
mace in Unrest last night that I&#39;ll give you.<br/>

May Tunare bless and keep you.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hi all.  I decided this would be a good place to put this, since everyone <br/>
&gt;has<br/>
&gt;good input on our class, while others refuse to help one another, I dunno.<br/>
&gt;Basically I currently play on veeshan server, and for months have been fed <br/>
&gt;up<br/>
&gt;with it.  Now I&#39;ve heard other ppl say (and could be rumors) that there is <br/>
&gt;less<br/>
&gt;ks&#39;ing on other servers, as well as not a dominate god guild like foh on <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;server.  (to Those of you possibly in FOH on this list, no offense, the <br/>
&gt;group of<br/>
&gt;friends I play with (UWS) as well as I have had bad run ins with your <br/>
&gt;guild.<br/>
&gt;Basically FoH and UWS has gone there...let&#39;s not do it again in here)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So basically my question to you is the server you play on how do you like <br/>
&gt;it?<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m seriously considereing abandoning all my characters on Veeshan to play <br/>
&gt;on a<br/>
&gt;better server.  This game is all about the playability in the environment, <br/>
&gt;which<br/>
&gt;veeshan seriously limits those not powerhungry play the game.<br/>
