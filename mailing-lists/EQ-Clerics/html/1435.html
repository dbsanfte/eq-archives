<div id="ygrps-yiv-1006325942">Well, personally When I am playing I am hunting.  I work FT and by the time<br/>
I get on at night, we have to try and get together and do something before<br/>
someone has to go to bed, the weekends are a different story. I do spend<br/>
time helping others out and going into town and such.   I don&#39;t get much<br/>
time for &quot;travel&quot; and nice as it may seem to have a different outfit, My<br/>
group does not get items we do not need. There is enough camping for items<br/>
in the game now as it stands and for my group to camp a Mithril BP for me<br/>
&quot;for looks&quot; is not what we practice. I had a pair of ruby pants in the bank<br/>
but honestly i can&#39;t be bothered with carrying all that stuff around all the<br/>
time, just to impress people.<br/>
My point being, that if they we going to make items for us to increase our<br/>
wisdom stats I think the designers could have done a better job of trying to<br/>
make them match for our class specifically.<br/>
Also, just my opinion Human females look like ass in Steel plate and/or<br/>
bronze armor. Full ruby and Mithril and the mist armor I like, but the<br/>
others don&#39;t appeal to me what so ever.<br/>
<br/>
Just My thoughts,<br/>

&gt;&gt;Well, you are in the wrong class if you are big on looks my friend, until<br/>
&gt;&gt;you can get to PoF and get the Mist Armor.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m not too sure I agree with this.  With the options of storebought Steel,<br/>
&gt;Rubicite and Mithril, you can come up with a very nice looking outfit for<br/>
&gt;travelling and social occasions.  Although I&#39;d like to obtain Mist Armor<br/>
&gt;myself, it&#39;s just not feasible at this time.  However, you can be as vain<br/>
&gt;(I&#39;m very aware of how my character appears), as any other class.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;You wanna be a good cleric? Mostly likely the answer is yes.<br/>
&gt;&gt;Then you will look like a newbie.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Absolutely, during times of battle you will look like a nightmarish<br/>
&gt;hodgepodge.  However, outside of battle you can still wear your travelling<br/>
&gt;clothes.  I normally carry my mithril breastplate, as well as the rest of<br/>
&gt;my outfit with me, so that when I&#39;m not fighting, I don&#39;t look a mess.  =)<br/>
