<div id="ygrps-yiv-1600766046">What level are you? because I am level 19 , and I could solo a yellow Dry <br/>
bone in unrest if every piece fell together right, but certainly not <br/>
reliably. i guess just make sure you do it near a zone, plus there is a lot <br/>
of down time between fights, sooo much better in a group , its how this game <br/>
is built<br/>
