&gt; &gt; Reasoning, after you cast your first &quot;real&quot; heal (greater heal for 280+ hp)<br/>
&gt; &gt; most monsters will attack you. DEX will allow you to cast while being hit<br/>
&gt; &gt; (it helps your channeling).<br/>

with GZ on spell issues) and GZ said he didn&#39;t think it helped at all<br/>
but was going to check the code out in case it had some indirect way of<br/>
effecting it.  The guy who runs the site did some tests and seemed to<br/>
think it did help with channelling.<br/>
