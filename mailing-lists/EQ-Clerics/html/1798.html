<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-35901863">Well the formula may be correct but i have capped my skill at 175 for 1 <br/>
handed and sure my 2 Handed will be the same, 171 right now. Could any other <br/>
level 45+ tell me if they have more then 175 or have capped in that range. I <br/>
talked with another 50 cleric and he maxed out at 183 and hes a high elf. <br/>
Dont know if race as a say in the skill cap for 1 handed but i know i am <br/>
capped at 175 been like that for 3 weeks.</div>
