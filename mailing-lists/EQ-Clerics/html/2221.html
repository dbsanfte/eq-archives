<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1429826548">You are experiencing the reason why I became a cleric in the first place.  I<br/>
played one throughout 3 phases of beta and decided that in final I wanted to<br/>
do something different, so I started a Troll SK and joined my friends.  At<br/>
level 20 we discovered that clerics that knew the meaning of the word are<br/>
*very* hard to find, so I started Astur.<br/>
<br/>
Now at level 40, I *still* see clerics in their mid-40s that do NOT heal or<br/>
buff, not even when asked!  There are several on Sol Ro that people avoid<br/>
like the plague.  I do not understand how they ever get that high in levels,<br/>
because as soon as most people realize how deadly they are for the group,<br/>
the groups either break up or kick out the bad cleric.<br/>
<br/>
This last weekend some friends of mine were with a group that had a level 35<br/>
cleric and a level 44 cleric.  The first thing the level 44 cleric did upon<br/>
joining the group was buff herself (no one else) and state &quot;you have heals&quot;<br/>
to the level 35 cleric.  They were in the priest room and during a<br/>
particularly bad fight the level 35 cleric said (repeatedly) &quot;OOM - YOU HAVE<br/>
HEALS&quot; and the level 44 cleric sat there and WATCHED while the group died,<br/>
all the while with FM! Needless to say that group immediately broke up.<br/>
BTW, I left the group when she joined because I *knew* her and tried to warn<br/>
the others.  I later got tells from everyone in that group saying they<br/>
wished they had listened to my warning.<br/>
<br/>
As to your question of &quot;why&quot; it is this way, I can only speculate.  I think<br/>
some of it has to do with the fact that our description on Verant&#39;s web site<br/>
states, &quot;The Cleric is a holy man endowed by his patron deity with the power<br/>
to heal, and, to a lesser extent, call upon the wrath of his deity to smite<br/>
his foes&quot; so they assume we are plate-wearing mages.<br/>

&gt; Hi all :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve played clerics in the past, and when I was grouped, I knew my job,<br/>
&gt; and did it very well. I buffed the tanks before battle, watched their<br/>
&gt; health bars carefully during battle, and (at levels before 25) engaged<br/>
&gt; in a bit of melee if things were going well. No one had to ask me for a<br/>
&gt; heal. I mean, come on. When you go to the doctor, should it be necesary<br/>
&gt; for you to ask him to heal you? Hell, no. That&#39;s his job, for pete&#39;s<br/>
&gt; sake.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway, I have recently been playing a barbarian warrior, because I knew<br/>
&gt; that I wanted to continue to melee, which would be a no-no for my cleric<br/>
&gt; at higher levels. Now, however, I&#39;m finding it very difficult to find<br/>
&gt; good clerics to group with. My warrior is level 19 now, and I can<br/>
&gt; honestly say that I&#39;ve yet to find a cleric who knows what the hell he&#39;s<br/>
&gt; supposed to do in a group. Is this just a problem with lower level<br/>
&gt; clerics? I certainly hope so, because if I EVER see a cleric not buffing<br/>
&gt; or healing in my groups at higher levels, I&#39;ll kick that person out of<br/>
&gt; my group faster than you can say &quot;Bob&#39;s your uncle!&quot; I won&#39;t even bother<br/>
&gt; to try explaining to them what they&#39;re supposed to do, because by that<br/>
&gt; time, they will have already perfected their bad habits. And I have made<br/>
&gt; it my solemn duty to NOT get myself or my group killed because of<br/>
&gt; someone else&#39;s arrogant stupidity/ignorance.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That being said, I want to ask a question. Why are there (seemingly) so<br/>
&gt; many clerics out there who nuke? For pete&#39;s sake! There&#39;s a pefectly<br/>
&gt; good nuking class--wizard! Why didn&#39;t they choose that class?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I remember when I first got smite, I wanted to show everyone how<br/>
&gt; powerful I was. But I quickly got over it, because people much preferred<br/>
&gt; my healing and buffing capabilities over a smite or two during battle.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It just irritates the hell out of me when I have to fight side by side<br/>
&gt; with a cleric who&#39;s at full health and who won&#39;t get beat on because he<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t melee worth a damn AND he won&#39;t heal me, even when I&#39;m down to my<br/>
&gt; last bubble of health. GRRR!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway, thanks for reading my--somewhat--rant on clerics. If you have<br/>
&gt; any advice for me to give these people, I&#39;d be happy to hear it. Any<br/>
&gt; time I&#39;ve tried to offer them advice, they&#39;ve either ignored me, or gave<br/>
&gt; me some lame reason why they do what they do. Sigh.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Maybe I should resurrect my clerics....<br/>
