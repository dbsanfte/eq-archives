<div id="ygrps-yiv-663912738">Sorry Mik, Mystik I should have THOUGHT ABOUT IT, didn&#39;t mean to piss anyone<br/>
off.<br/>
<br/>
Most everyone agrees something has to be done, This is Verant attempt to do<br/>
something.  I personally like the random loot on the random spawn Idea, but<br/>
the  loot/poses an item once, and the min/max level cap on a  magic item are<br/>
also  possible ideas.<br/>
<br/>
The reason I feel &quot;First Come First Served&quot; isn&#39;t fair is  an experience I<br/>
had in Crush. I went to get the Crush Tunic. When I got to the tower 2  solo<br/>
mages were camping.  I asked to join but they said they would rather solo,<br/>
but one offered to sell me the Tunic.  Soon after Emperor Crush spawned.<br/>
Though  I tried to kill him, but the mages just blew him away. I then<br/>
realized I had no chance to get the item so I paid  the PP. Under the first<br/>
come first served rule I would have had to wait  hours till both left,<br/>
formed a group capable of Killing Crush, then split the loot with my group.<br/>
In the mean Time hope the mage does not come back and KS<br/>
