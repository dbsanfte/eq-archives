<div id="ygrps-yiv-1713001651">Mik, the problem is that there is _no_ solution that will not penalise some<br/>
group of players.<br/>
No wait, there is _one_. Implementing the random (but still as rare) spawn<br/>
on similar level mobs across Norrath. And Verant will not do that because it<br/>
violates the background stories. In fact even this solution could be said to<br/>
penalise the small percentage of players who actually know or care about the<br/>
background stories. But at least it might encourage some kind of real<br/>
adventuring, exploration and discovery, rather than the mentality of &quot;I must<br/>
have this item, I&#39;ve found out from the web where this item is, I&#39;ll go camp<br/>
the item for 24 hours&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Yielding on green mobs isn&#39;t fair.<br/>
First come first served isn&#39;t fair.<br/>
Life isn&#39;t fair.<br/>
