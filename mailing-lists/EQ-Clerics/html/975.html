<div id="ygrps-yiv-1520861821">I was just hanging out on the dock, and lo and behold, I saw Trumpy<br/>
walking around out there.  So, if you&#39;re patient, just wait for him.<br/>
He&#39;ll leave eventually.  I have no reason to believe there was anyone<br/>
in the bar that got him drunk to make him leave.  At the time I think<br/>
I was the only person in south qeynos.<br/>

&gt;Be warned that Trumpy will hold a grudge. I was coming back from South<br/>
&gt;Karana to Qeynos and agreed to bind 2 people on the docks, and just as I <br/>
&gt;was<br/>
&gt;about to do it, Trumpy and a city guard (friend of his) turned up and<br/>
&gt;whacked me upside down from behind. I was *not* impressed, as I intended to<br/>
&gt;bind myself at the bank after binding the adventurers. I had to run back<br/>
&gt;again from South Karana. Argh.<br/>
&gt;I&#39;d only killed him once before and cast root on him another time for a<br/>
&gt;friend to kill him. Both times we bought him drinks till he opened up the<br/>
&gt;conversation.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;There were murmurs that if you get him absolutely drunk first then you get <br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt;good faction hit, which cancels out the bad faction hit from killing him<br/>
&gt;afterwards. I haven&#39;t verified that.<br/>

&gt; &gt; At your level, the best 2 choices are the Shining Star of Light<br/>
&gt; &gt; or the Bloodforge hammer.  Of course, you could just continue to use<br/>
&gt; &gt; the hammer of wrath, too.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; To get the shining star of light requires real good Qeynos Priest of<br/>
&gt; &gt; Life faction (and of course for you to journey to Qeynos).  Be sure<br/>
&gt; &gt; to read this quest first (it is a qeynos-based quest).  The SSOL is<br/>
&gt; &gt; a decent 1h weapon that is 6/28, weighs 5 pounds, I think, and casts<br/>
&gt; &gt; &#39;cleanse&#39;, which removes negative effects.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The Bloodforge hammer is also a Qeynos quest (kind of).  This is what<br/>
&gt; &gt; I did, while I was in Qeynos increased my PriestsofLife faction by<br/>
&gt; &gt; doing the blessed oil quest, I found Trumpy Irontoe near the docks<br/>
&gt; &gt; and killed him (green to me at 12th), and got his head. Be warned, as<br/>
&gt; &gt; this will seriously lower your faction with some groups in Qeynos.<br/>
&gt; &gt; The BF hammer is 13/50 2h and adds +10 to saves vs. magic.  It weighs<br/>
&gt; &gt; 10 pounds.  This quest is a Kaladim quest, and you need to be amiable<br/>
&gt; &gt; with the stormguard(I think) in Kaladim - the dwarven fighter guild.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I think killing Crushbone orcs raises that faction, so I didn&#39;t even<br/>
&gt; &gt; have to work on it, it was already amiable when I got there (Kaladim).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I have both of these weapons.  I&#39;m trying to increase my 2h skill, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; I switch to the SSOL when the going gets tough!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Ergo 13th level high elf cleric on test server<br/>
