<div id="ygrps-yiv-1247244656">I thind i know that wizard on the Rathe or one of them.  I&#39;ve played<br/>
several characters on the Rathe that were self made meaning they were<br/>
running around in cloth and scrounging money for spells for lvl&#39;s they<br/>
had passed.  Camping is boring and i&#39;d rather play the game than camp an<br/>
item.  I will however check such a location as Trainer Hill for an<br/>
opportunity on that Shiney Brass Shield which is a highly coveted item.  <br/>
<br/>
Having a wizard pop out of the shadows to steal your kill so you can see<br/>
a SBS auctioned at a price way beyond your means might be part of the<br/>
game or a reflection on real life.  Typically those wizards are high lvl<br/>
and are there to steal Crush and possibly Dvinn from groups that are<br/>
tanking. When unsuccessful they go to Trainer Hill to steal.<br/>
<br/>
One time i was in a party of 6 lvl 9 and 10 lvl characters.  A nice<br/>
group for the trainer.  A lvl 34 druid shows up and initiates talk while<br/>
we are in group chat.  The trainer pops up and he instantly decides that<br/>
he wants it and steals it from my group.  Turns out he was stealing from<br/>
the poor to give to the poor.  A regular Robin Hood I called him.  He<br/>
was just there to play God cause he was bored.  Experiences like that<br/>
really taint my enjoyment of the game.  <br/>
<br/>
If that is going to be an ongoing occurance from the SBS to J boots or<br/>
whatever, THEN I WELCOME VERANT CHAMPIONING THE CAUSE OF THE LOW LVL<br/>
PLAYER!<br/>
<br/>
There is however the incidence of twinked low lvl players being<br/>
manufactured into 25th lvl characters in 24 hours with the massive<br/>
assistance of high lvl characters who erase damage inventories caused by<br/>
high lvl characters.  The low lvl character steps in when the creature<br/>
has a thread of life and scores the kill on a few points damage.  <br/>
<br/>
My 17 Cleric in Befallen scored three kills with three blasts while<br/>
helping with what he thought was a third lvl train that was brought to<br/>
the atrium at the entrance to lvl 2.  Turns out the second and part of<br/>
the third lvl&#39;s were being drained for the benefit of characters that<br/>
were lvl 10 to 12 at the time i checked the list of Befallen players.  <br/>
<br/>
My Cleric, with nothing to do, and not interested in interfering with<br/>
the organized crime on The Rathe, decided to log off and come back<br/>
another day.  Some day he might decide not to come back if things don&#39;t<br/>
change.<br/>
<br/>
Regarding trainer hill, I have since learned that when the Hill is empty<br/>
to ask if there are any invisible or hiding characters in line, or<br/>
possibly someone up in that tree on the left.  Believe me, scum wizards<br/>
have no courtesy and my list of non-eligable resurrections is dominated<br/>
by wizards.<br/>

&gt; What I think should be forced is not the fact if you are camping for an item<br/>
&gt; and you get no exp for the kill and me and my group comes along I shouldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; have the right to say &quot;OK buddy move along&quot; but it should be forced that you<br/>
&gt; have to share, you get your turn then me and my group, then you and then me<br/>
&gt; and my group, etc.....<br/>
&gt; I have camped in Crush Bone for the Shiny Brass Shield before and watched a<br/>
&gt; lvl 20 wizard EVERYTIME the Trainer spawned he&#39;d jump up and blast him.  The<br/>
&gt; wizard gave no one a chance to kill the trainer.  Even when someone came up<br/>
&gt; and said &quot;I got the next Trainer!&quot; the wizard would laugh and go &quot;If you<br/>
&gt; think you can&quot; or something like that.<br/>
&gt; So instade of getting banned for not yielding it should be banned after 3<br/>
&gt; warnings of not sharing the spawn.  I know thats what Mik and Mystix are<br/>
&gt; saying that we should be able to share the spawn but how many ppl do you<br/>
&gt; know that truely shares them?  I&#39;ve seen and heard about many players that<br/>
&gt; would not share.  But in away it should be &quot;first come first served&quot; but not<br/>
&gt; to the point of &quot;We were here first, it&#39;s our camp now go away&quot; it should be<br/>
&gt; they were there first they get the first shot at the spawn but once they had<br/>
&gt; their kill and no loot then it&#39;s back to the end of the line to let the next<br/>
&gt; person have a chance.<br/>
&gt; But to me Brad needs to changing it from Yield Policy to Sharing Policy.<br/>

&gt; &gt; i didn&#39;t say that was right now did i? there are jerks everywhere you go,<br/>
&gt; &gt; unavoidable....all you can do is report em....that they&#39;re disrupting<br/>
&gt; &gt; you....that isn&#39;t right for them to do that, but i do think if you&#39;re at a<br/>
&gt; place<br/>
&gt; &gt; for an item and you get no exp, you shouldn&#39;t have to leave like<br/>
&gt; that..that&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; not fair<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  YA RIGHT !!!!!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  So Mik and  Mystic  If that&#39;s your idea of fairness  then the next time<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; level 50 wizard shows up and nukes a mob  my  group has been  camping<br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; hours , should I tell them  &quot;Mik says its first com first served&quot;  and<br/>
&gt; to go<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; away. Think about it.<br/>
