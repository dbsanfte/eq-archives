<div id="ygrps-yiv-740760512">You hafta connect through Sonys Station for EQ, so either way you have to go<br/>
through a gaming type zone.  Maybe AC&#39;s is a lot different but by the time<br/>
you get to the character select screen on EQ I could&#39;ve been playing AC for<br/>
2-3 mins.  Both are good games, everyone whined about how EQ&#39;s interface and<br/>
all that, AC&#39;s seems to be better yet I&#39;ve read in a few places ppl are<br/>
saying it&#39;s worse.  I don&#39;t find AC hard to play at all, it&#39;s easy to learn,<br/>
have pretty good graphics, gameplay is easy and I think AC feels more like a<br/>
real RPG then EQ does on how they handle skills and all that.<br/>
