<div id="ygrps-yiv-823508082">Go fight muddites in beholder.  You&#39;ll find a pretty damn good use for<br/>
cure blindness real quick.  Not to mention any other time one of your<br/>
party members gets blinded.  Or..  If you yourself get blinded while<br/>
soloing it kinda puts a kink in your gameplan.  Not being able to see<br/>
what&#39;s going on can cost you your life.  As with a few other cure<br/>
spells, it sometimes has to be cast more than once to be effective.</div>
