<div id="ygrps-yiv-179356183">I prefer AC increasing items for chest and legs such as rubicite or bronze,<br/>
forgoing a BS Tunic and Gator Skin Leggings which equal +8 wisdom, which<br/>
equates to 48 mana.  Because when you do cast a heal and draw attention you<br/>
don&#39;t want to get damaged enough to require you to heal yourself or another<br/>
member has to do the same.  You or another party member will quickly burn up<br/>
an excess of 48 mana healing you in such a case.  At higher levels it takes<br/>
very little time for a mob or single creature to do 300+ damage to you<br/>
before they can be taunted away.<br/>
<br/>
A lot also depends on what wis increasing items you have.  I have a 160<br/>
wisdom without using the BS Tunic and Gator Skin Leggings.  If you are<br/>
lacking good wis items in other areas I would use anything you can find<br/>
until you are 150+, then you can work on increasing your AC.  Magic<br/>
resistance is also a consideration in different circumstances.  I will<br/>
change out a Lizard Scale Mantle for a BS Mantle if I am hunting high level<br/>
magic using creatures for the increased magic resistance.  It doesn&#39;t take<br/>
long for a Festering Hag to send you back to your bind point with a low<br/>
resistance.<br/>
