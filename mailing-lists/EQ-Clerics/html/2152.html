<div id="ygrps-yiv-376630242"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Just be careful with it because the scarecrows seem to have <br/>
&gt; very good magic<br/>
&gt; resistance... I never had very good luck soloing them until <br/>
&gt; they got to be blue.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>For me it was usually OK, root seemed to work pretty well... but every now<br/>
and again I&#39;d get a rogue crow - usually blue - that took me to within an<br/>
inch of my life. Never killed me though. I started soloing them at 16 and<br/>
went on to 19 pretty easily (playing catchup with my normal group, heh). The<br/>
other thing about them is they are a handy point on the Qeynos-Splitpaw<br/>
route which (as all Qeynos clerics know) is the level 19 spell quest route.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; if there are 2 or 3 other people there, you may as <br/>
&gt; well go hunt<br/>
&gt; someplace else becasue there aren&#39;t enough scarecrows for everybody.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is where I am glad that I play mornings and lunchtimes GMT...<br/>
