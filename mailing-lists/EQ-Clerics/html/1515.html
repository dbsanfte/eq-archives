<b>Subject:</b> Re: Suggestions for high teen levels in unrest? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1614242785">I was at Unrest at lvl 23 with a full group including a 2nd cleric.  The <br/>
place was horrible.  Death after death after death.  Between deaths and <br/>
running to the zone there were no points made.  The only time we were there <br/>
successfully was in a room (hand room) i think.  Then shortly a high lvl <br/>
cleric came in and ran us out....i am now almost lvl 27 and haven&#39;t been <br/>
back yet.  I may try to go back soon though...<br/>

&gt;I have heard from many many people that unrest is a great place for a <br/>
&gt;cleric<br/>
&gt;to go starting around 14 or so.  I am 17th (almost 18th) and am having<br/>
&gt;serious trouble there.  Last night 6 people from my guild were there, all<br/>
&gt;15-20 and we had a rough time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We were at the back wall pulling from the back door.  We had SoW and invis<br/>
&gt;to undead on the puller at all times, but there were many times where she<br/>
&gt;ended up bringing quite a few too many ghouls.  (tried to pull 1 and<br/>
&gt;suddenly there were 7 of them on us!)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Are we hunting at too high a level, or are we pulling from the wrong place?<br/>
&gt;Or do we just suck?  We only had 2 deaths last night, but many many many<br/>
&gt;close calls.  Lets just say thank god our druid was also saving 50% mana <br/>
&gt;for<br/>
&gt;heals.<br/>
