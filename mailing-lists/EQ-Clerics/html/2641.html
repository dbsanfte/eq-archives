&gt;front of the dragon as to damage I take.  And you MUST be in healing range<br/>
&gt;of your party, otherwise why be there?  One VERY interesting thing I have<br/>
&gt;discovered tho......on the last two dragon raids I positioned myself BEHIND<br/>
&gt;the dragon, almost under his/her butt.  Guess what....I did not suffer<br/>
&gt;nearly the dmg from their spells I did when I was in front of them yet was<br/>
&gt;still in healing range of my party.  And I never got physically hit,<br/>
&gt;although I rarely do unless I get summoned, then I get clawed big time.<br/>

actually live through Nagafen :)<br/>
