<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Er, you&#39;re kidding, right? I agree on the patchwork, but smithing isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;cheap. On established servers it&#39;s usually cheaper to buy banded or skip<br/>
&gt;straight to bronze, given that the smithing market is becoming so depressed,<br/>
&gt;and places like Unrest get more low-level players in them by the day...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually I&#39;m quite serious.  If ye need to armor 3 or 4 players, and they<br/>
are willing to pay for the base costs of the materials, you could easily<br/>
gain enough skill to make banded reliably.  I estimate it would take<br/>
roughly 250 to 300 platinum pieces to bring smithing up to the level<br/>
necessary to create Banded.  With 3 or 4 people, that comes out to 75 to<br/>
100pp each for banded.<br/>
