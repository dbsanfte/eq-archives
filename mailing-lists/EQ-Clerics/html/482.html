<b>Subject:</b> Question about dexterity <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-900181209">I have question to you fellow clerics that would like to have a clear answer to. The<br/>
question is that does dexterity effect in spellcasting any way? Does it make us<br/>
to recover from mobs interrupting our spellcasting better? I have heard some<br/>
clerics claim this. I have a dex of 98 and i do find it quite often that even if critters<br/>
hit me HARD i am able to cast a healing spell. I have even gated several times<br/>
out from a heated battle while being hit for a total of 70 dmg.<br/>
<br/>
Just thinking if buying those jewellery craft items that raise dex are worth it :)<br/>
