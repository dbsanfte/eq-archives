 </span></blockquote>We get group heal spell at level 34 - though it does not heal too much heal<br/>
for the 180 mana it costs to cast - course it is great when everyone in<br/>
group needs a little bit healed.  Also - party members need to be pretty<br/>
close for this spell to work on everyone - works better in a dungeon than in<br/>
fields as everyone is a little more clustered together.<br/>
<br/>
I used RTS up until about level 30 - when I finally was able to get observer<br/>
staff.  The quests for the testament of vanear and paw of opalla (both +wis<br/>
higher than observer staff) are extremely difficult for dark elf to obtain<br/>
as they take place in the &quot;goody-goody&quot; race cities =)<br/>
<br/>
Armor-wise:  Bronze works in a pinch but is TOOOOO heavy.  Steel is lighter<br/>
and same AC as bronze, but you really should be trying to get the items with<br/>
+wis stats such as gator scale leggings, BS tunic, mammoth hide cloak,<br/>
adamantite epolets (shoulder slot) etc.  You might look a little newbie-ish<br/>
but the +wis is necessary for cleric.<br/>
<br/>
Just my opinions :)<br/>
