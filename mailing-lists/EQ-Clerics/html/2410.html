<div id="ygrps-yiv-1518293979">I prefer the wisdom myself friends, I am looking forward to finally getting <br/>
some EM armor.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I am not sure about what you are wearing vs. what your tanks are<br/>
&gt;wearing, but I can almost guarantee that either your tanks are not &gt;equiped <br/>
&gt;for AC or you are not equiped to maximize wisdom.  Sorry if &gt;I&#39;m ignorant <br/>
&gt;here, but those numbers just seem out of place of &gt;everthing I&#39;ve seen<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would like to hear what your findings in this area are, What is so <br/>
unbalanced as you see it.  I only have me and my tanks to compare to.  I <br/>
have 100 points worth of wisdom items that I wear regularly or thereabouts.  <br/>
when I wear the Quest BP and Legs and buff myself I have had my AC up to <br/>
741( I think I also had feet like cat)  The ranger is wearing Ranger quest <br/>
armor, exehood, thorny vine boots, hero bracer, not sure what else.  The <br/>
paladin is wearing azure sleeves, silver-plated legs, hero bracer, serp <br/>
bracer ( i think) umm some black chestpiece not sure which one it is.  <br/>
Pallys AC is higher than the rangers typically.  My Buff gives an added 31 <br/>
AC(sheild of words)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Let me also clarify that I feel for the paladins not because of their quest <br/>
armor, but the general problems that the class has.  My friend is a level 47 <br/>
pally, I have grouped with him everyday since level 7.  He has gone from a <br/>
viable tank to a standby meleeist.  His lay hands doesn&#39;t work half the time <br/>
when you need it to and in a big fight he is lucky if he does 300 total <br/>
damage to one mob, whereas our ranger(who I have also grouped with since lvl <br/>
7) does in excess of 700 to 800 points of damage per mob.  He feels, as well <br/>
as, many other paladins of his level, that he is less than effective to <br/>
group with. ( I personally wouldn&#39;t trade him for the world).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
They have even taken many many hours to compare damage and rates of contact <br/>
as opposed to misses and such, still the paladin Always falls short, always, <br/>
they have tried raising AC, then raising Dex, agi, etccc. str, whatever, <br/>
also different combos of higher stats, the paladins can never measure up in <br/>
combat, no matter what they have tried.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t find your response to me a flame, i value hearing other peoples <br/>
opinions, I just look at the classes as whole varied spectrum and feel that <br/>
the clerics are the last ones who should be complaining at this point.  <br/>
Paladins and shadowknights are starving for help, they are not as formidable <br/>
at the higher level ranks.  Paladins have to do these extensive quests which <br/>
require hours of research to get a less than par weapon ( i.e. Soulfire - <br/>
People this weapon sucks compared to a mithril 2hander......Ghoulbane is <br/>
good in certain situations i will agree on that) all of that hard work, <br/>
dedication, patience, just so they can feel even worse about themselves when <br/>
they finally achieve it.  Suffice to say, our pally has started a monk now, <br/>
which our group does really need, to work the planes and pull big mobs, so <br/>
as I am sad that our fearless leader pally will be gone, I am happy he is <br/>
not going to give up completely and try to continue on with a new character.<br/>
