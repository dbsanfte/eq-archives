<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-676008769">Wow! I remember dueling a troll when I was level 13, and I never thought<br/>
to use Flash of Light or Root. VERY interesting. I should have thought<br/>
to use Divine Aura, too, because that friggin troll cast some nasty<br/>
weakening spells on me which, for a cleric, can be devastating. However,<br/>
I was able to outwit him in the end, although it was a very close thing.<br/>
I will have to remember these great tactics. Excellent!<br/>
