<div id="ygrps-yiv-407472267">I&#39;m kind of curious myself about getting some decent equipment for myself. I am only level 8 but the sooner I start the better. Could someone maybe suggest a good way to make some quick cash or get some decent equipment for my level. I am willing to put a lot of effort into it. I want to be able to catch up with some of my friends, they are much higher level than I am.<br/>
