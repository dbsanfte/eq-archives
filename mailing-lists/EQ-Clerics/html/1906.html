<div id="ygrps-yiv-1236838695">I totally agree that melee at high levels is useless. You may be able <br/>
     to get a decent weapon but when you only hit once every 10 swings the <br/>
     damage doesn&#39;t add up very fast.  When I&#39;m in a group it&#39;s strictly <br/>
     med and heal with maybe the odd stun thrown in.<br/>
     <br/>
     As far as soloing goes, It can be done by a cleric fairly easily once <br/>
     you hit L44 (power level for clerics imo).  I pretty much soloed from <br/>
     47 to 50 by fighting spectres in oasis and oot as well as a few other <br/>
     npc&#39;s.  I personally have no trouble pulling spectres single, have <br/>
     never fought them in feerott though.  Experience had really started to <br/>
     slow down from the dungeons and soloing was a nice change from the <br/>
     med/heal routine.<br/>
     <br/>
     As far as mana goes, my base wisdom is 105 and I am currently at 170 <br/>
     and should be able to get it to 190 before to long (still need a paw). <br/>
      I can take out 2 spectres solo before I need to med and haven&#39;t had <br/>
     much problems with mana when grouped.<br/>

Hate to discourage you, but at higher levels, you will melee VERY little. <br/>
Your value is healing and buffing.  And the damage you will be able to do <br/>
against high level mobs is very minimal.  You will be fighting mobs with <br/>
1000s of hps at high levels, and a lot of them have very high magic <br/>
resistance, so your spells are useless cause they are resisted most always. <br/>
And these mobs hit HARD...some for over 100 hps damage a pop.  You can&#39;t <br/>
survive at melee with these mobs, only the big tanks can.  You serve one <br/>
purpose mainly, and that is healing to keep everyone alive. Regarding undead, <br/>
 clerics used to be able to solo specs quite easily with undead spells, but <br/>
they changed the pathing of them at the spec cave in Feerott and now it&#39;s <br/>
dangerous cause you can&#39;t really pull them solo anymore.  You pull one and <br/>
two or three come, and that&#39;s BAD news.<br/>
     <br/>
Regarding the mana issue....you will need to get your hands on as many <br/>
wisdom enhancing items as you can, because you will need all the mana you <br/>
can get to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of your healing powers. <br/>
The more mana you have the longer you can keep your group alive and the less <br/>
med time you have.  So start amassing those wisdom items and try to get your <br/>
wisdom at least up into the 170s minimum.<br/>
     <br/>
Sorry to disillusion you, but high levels clerics are relegated mostly to <br/>
healing and buffing and medding.  That&#39;s what your specialty is and at those <br/>
levels, the other healing classes can&#39;t come close to our healing powers <br/>
with our superior and complete heal.  The good news is that no high level <br/>
group ventures anywhere without at least one good cleric.  YOu are a MUST <br/>
have.<br/>
     <br/>

&gt; Okay, I am now lvl 10 and really concerned about this.  From what EVERYONE <br/>
&gt; tells me (which I totally disagree with and the whole subject matter makes <br/>
&gt; me sick) is that when older (25+) all we do is heal...no melee, no DD, <br/>
just<br/>
&gt; heal and med.  First...is that true or can we still melee..I know we won&#39;t <br/>
&gt; exactly be able to solo melee...but as in a group or possibly as the only <br/>
&gt; tank?..and while on that subject, can we solo undead up into all our <br/>
higher<br/>
&gt; lvls or do we still need help then too?  And finally the mana issue.  I am <br/>
&gt; dwarven cleric and have a 100 in strength and 103 in wisdom...will that be <br/>
a<br/>
&gt; high enough wisdom to have proper mana to heal my group and such?  Any <br/>
other<br/>
&gt; tips would be most helpful.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; P.S.  Any good cleric websites with detailed spell descriptions (like how <br/>
&gt; much damage our spells deal, how much HPs our healing spells heal, and the <br/>
&gt; exact numbers on our buffs, etc)<br/>
