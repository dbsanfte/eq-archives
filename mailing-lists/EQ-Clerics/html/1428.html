<div id="ygrps-yiv-1919266281">Here&#39;s a list off the top of my head, in order of difficulty.  These are all<br/>
plate based, so no BloodStained or others are listed here.  I&#39;ve never seen<br/>
<br/>
type, what is available, what zone, level needed to kill appropriate mobs (and<br/>
still get exp from kill)<br/>
<br/>
Barbed (full)- In Befallen 12-20<br/>
Bronze(full)- Unrest, Nejena, Lake Rathe, various other places 14+ (or so-been<br/>
awhile)<br/>
Blackened(full)- Runnyeye 20-33<br/>
Rubicite(full)- Cazic- all- 30-45 (maybe more for AoF)<br/>
Silver-Plated Bracer- Shin Lord in Upper Guk full group of 30s can handle, no<br/>
exp at 43<br/>
<br/>
***all below items you will get exp above 45 for killing mobs with the items, so<br/>
I&#39;ll list group level***<br/>
<br/>
Chestplate of Dark Flame- Mistmoore- full party of 40s<br/>
Black Enam. Chestplate- Lower Guk- at least high 30s- well balanced group<br/>
Silver-Plated Leggins- Yuk Priest in Lower Guk (live side) group of 38+ (I was<br/>
there at 38 with a 43+ group with no problem)<br/>
Charred (gaunthlets, BP, Shield, Boots, ???)- Sol A, Mid 30s group should be<br/>
able to get all pieces available<br/>
Mithril(full?)- Sol B groups of high 30s up to 50; there are some name confusion<br/>
things (Chest pieces: Lower Guk- Mithril Runed Tunic (not plate look); Sol B-<br/>
Mithril BP(plate look))<br/>
Lustrous Russet- PoF- only non-class specific armor from PoF- unattainable at<br/>
current<br/>
Ethereal Mist - PoF- unattainable at current, but best (although purple) you can<br/>
get.<br/>
<br/>
Steele Plate(full)- store bough<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps<br/>
