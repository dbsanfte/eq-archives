<div id="ygrps-yiv-364400626">Well.. i know with today&#39;s patch this is now an item that you can put in your <br/>
left hand slot, and yeilds +10 mana and +10 wisdom.. a necessity for any <br/>
cleric... but its also lore and no drop... and I am a DE cleric... I know the <br/>
quest starts in Erudin and also takes place in i think qeynos and HH, but <br/>
does anyone know a way in which i might be able to obtain this valuable item? <br/>
 Especially since DE clerics get zero quests... and casters get that stein <br/>
thing that isn&#39;t no drop... i guess i&#39;ll have to yell at some GMs for that <br/>
one.... anyone who can give a more detailed spoiler or a way to increase <br/>
faction with only the npcs who are abosolutly necessary for the quest would <br/>
be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance for the info.</div>
