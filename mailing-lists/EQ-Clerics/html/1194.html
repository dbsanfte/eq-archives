<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1229232866">I have dabbled in a few different trade skills.....I am a master in fishing <br/>
which really doesn&#39;t amount to much except feeding myself, I have a mediocre <br/>
skill in tailoring(studded leather skill), i have a smithing skill of 67 and <br/>
have just recently started Fletching(my husband is a ranger)skill lvl is <br/>
only 32....we already have 2 bakers in our guild and, i&#39;m leaving the <br/>
jewelcraft to the enchanters...so I was considering trying brewing next, I <br/>
think its fun to try the different skills out and when I am not hunting then <br/>
I have something to keep me busy )<br/>
Just my thoughts<br/>

&gt;Noted, good idea. But it&#39;s still the case that on the older servers, people<br/>
&gt;are skipping straight to bronze, or receiving very underpriced banded from<br/>
&gt;higher-level friends who don&#39;t need it, or whatever. The market for banded<br/>
&gt;is getting younger and younger, and hence people expect banded for cheaper<br/>
&gt;and cheaper just because they don&#39;t have that kind of money to spend.<br/>
&gt;Also, of the friends that I group with regularly, only 1 can wear banded <br/>
&gt;who<br/>
&gt;hasn&#39;t already got it :-(<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But let&#39;s not go too far into a smithing discussion...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;A question:<br/>
&gt;Despite clerics traditionally being a poor class, I suspect that many<br/>
&gt;clerics do one or more trade skills... Anyone? My favourite is baking<br/>
&gt;because you can cook on the move.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Actually I&#39;m quite serious.  If ye need to armor 3 or 4<br/>
&gt; &gt; players, and they<br/>
&gt; &gt; are willing to pay for the base costs of the materials, you<br/>
&gt; &gt; could easily<br/>
&gt; &gt; gain enough skill to make banded reliably.  I estimate it would take<br/>
&gt; &gt; roughly 250 to 300 platinum pieces to bring smithing up to the level<br/>
&gt; &gt; necessary to create Banded.  With 3 or 4 people, that comes<br/>
&gt; &gt; out to 75 to<br/>
&gt; &gt; 100pp each for banded.<br/>
