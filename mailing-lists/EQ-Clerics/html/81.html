<div id="ygrps-yiv-1970454578">I was wondering as a Dark Elf Cleric, can they really wear plate? Right now, <br/>
I think I made the mistake of only having 65 str. That seems to be too little <br/>
to wear plate later on, let alone the heavy bronze. If this isn&#39;t the case, <br/>
please let me know so I can jump for joy. Thanks much.<br/>
