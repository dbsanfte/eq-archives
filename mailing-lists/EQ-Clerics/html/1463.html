Does anyone know what happens when your account runs out? Mine is set to<br/>
expire October 1st (I started a six-month account on April 1st), and I<br/>
haven&#39;t heard anything from our kind and intelligent friends at Verant.<br/>
If I decide not to play EQ any more, or just quit for a while, will my<br/>
character be deleted/wiped? If so, then I&#39;d better get on the ball and<br/>
start giving my stuff away. It seems like a waste, though. Cause I&#39;ll<br/>
probably come back in a couple months to play again, and I don&#39;t want to<br/>
have to start over. But I also don&#39;t want to keep paying the monthly fee<br/>
if I&#39;m not gonna be online.<br/>

&gt; &lt;slight spoiler warning&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think the important thing to remember about the SSOL is that it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; a fairly low-level item.  Most clerics will toss it once they get a<br/>
&gt; screaming mace, or a BEM, or gem-encrusted scepter.  Because the quest<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t involves only killing bixies in Rivervale you can do this<br/>
&gt; quest at an extremely low level.  I did the blessed oil quest over<br/>
&gt; and over again.  It took me about 15 times or more of doing this.  I<br/>
&gt; am a high elf, and I think I was apprehensive when I started.  Maybe<br/>
&gt; dubious, I don&#39;t remember.  You have to get well into amiably to get<br/>
&gt; the quest.<br/>
&gt;   Another really good quest that I&#39;m doing now in my spare time is the<br/>
&gt; diseased wolf quest.  You can kill rabid wolves and rabid grizzlies<br/>
&gt; in Qeynos hills and give the pelts to Priestess Caulria in the UFO.<br/>
&gt; I turned in 4 wolf pelts and 1 grizzly pelt, got a plat for the<br/>
&gt; grizzly pelt, and &#39;endure disease&#39; a 14th level spell (which you can<br/>
&gt; buy for 4 plat, or sell for 6-7 gold).  I turned in these pelts, and<br/>
&gt; at 15th level, I got nearly a half a bar of experience.  Not bad<br/>
&gt; considering 90% of rabid wolves die with one smite spell.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Our guildmaster, who is a paladin, just recently needed to raise his<br/>
&gt; &gt;faction<br/>
&gt; &gt;with the priests of Life, in order to obtain his soulfire sword.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Basically what we did to help raise his faction was:<br/>
&gt; &gt;1) killing putrid skellies in South Karana(at Grimrots Camp)<br/>
&gt; &gt;2) Turning in diseased animal pelts to the Temple of Life<br/>
&gt; &gt;3) Doing the Blessed oil Quest til he turned green<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;These will all raise your faction there. Even I, a person who originally<br/>
&gt; &gt;came from the temple of Life, needed to raise my faction in order to do<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt;quest. But to be quite honest, I did the quest simply cause I had never<br/>
&gt; &gt;done<br/>
&gt; &gt;a quest before, I tried the weapon out like once to see what the effect<br/>
was<br/>
&gt; &gt;and it has sat in the bank ever since.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt;I keep reading that everyone on here loves to use there SSOL.  I would<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;like<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;to get this weapon as well.  I am a human cleric from the Temple of Marr<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;in<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;Freeport.  Will i have problems trying to do the quest, or will i be ok?<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;Just want to make sure, before I make that loooong journy from freeport<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;qeynos.  Thanks<br/>
