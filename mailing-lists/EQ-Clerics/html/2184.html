<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1508886430">Ok I will stand up here and get flamed / shouted at (actually flaming is<br/>
good on this list ie not bad sooooo)<br/>
<br/>
DEX Definitely in my opinion no matter what GZ or whoever says helps my<br/>
channeling and spell casting nooooo end ie makes it great.<br/>
<br/>
I have a halfling druid with a very very high dex.. made that way for that<br/>
reason and I can honestly say that it woops my clerics reasonable dex into<br/>
the ground, and I am talkin tryin to snare a cyclops as was or a HG (as is<br/>
now) flat on my back faced away and pindin on me, it goes off on 4th try, 1<br/>
fail (interrupt) 2 savesd and one positive I rely on it whole heartedly and<br/>
ok channeling is high but so is dex about 135/145 dependin if rings on or<br/>
not.<br/>
<br/>
I have experimented with characters same class (ie cleric) and lesser dex<br/>
and I get wopped on np spell , he not go off...<br/>
<br/>
Agreed it hasd been publicised but for me up until last night I LOVE my high<br/>
dex....<br/>
<br/>
But as always this post is made in the best possible taste and is open to<br/>
debate as is a good one and if is chewin over old cud well I said along time<br/>
ago it hasnt for a while and I still hold to me guns; sorry but when I saw<br/>
this one i had to reiterate what I know to be true for me; coincidence or<br/>
not..</div>
