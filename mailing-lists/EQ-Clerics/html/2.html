<div id="ygrps-yiv-2113829582">Hello to everyone also! I agree, its nice to have a place where clerics can discuss things :)<br/>
<br/>
I personally have started to wonder if my role is going to be the same from now on, i.e. staring at the pages of my spell books<br/>
for what seems to be ages, then getting up for a short burst of casting, then BAM back to the book again. I recently have been<br/>
hunting in Unrest, where clerics SHOULD rule, and yet I was told by a shaman that HIS poison spell was more effective then my<br/>
Dismiss undead, and I am a few levels higher then this shaman. It didn&#39;t make me mad so much as disappointed, I truely want to be<br/>
GREAT at some part in the game, and I thought it was with undead &lt;G&gt; Anyway, this isn&#39;t meant to be a rant in as much as a<br/>
question; do any of you all feel this way at times?<br/>
<br/>
Back the those pages!<br/>
