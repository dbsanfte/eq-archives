<b>Subject:</b> Playing on Test server <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1146301985">My Friends and I are burned out quite a bit on Fennin Ro, way too crowded,<br/>
and the Planes are near to impossible half the time.  Well, we decided to<br/>
take a break and I am having a blast.<br/>
<br/>
We created characters on the test server. No Spam, No crowding, and no<br/>
problems so far about finding stuff to hunt. We are still very young yet<br/>
though and it is fun having to work for all our stuff again.  On Fennin We<br/>
could create newbie and give them things, but on test we can&#39;t &quot;twink&quot; so it<br/>
feels just like it did when I started out on March 18th.<br/>
I made a cleric again, while my friends made classes that are different form<br/>
what their high levels on Fennin are.  My thought are I have always liked<br/>
playign the cleric and well if we are gonna go anywhere on Test, you have to<br/>
have a cleric so I am happy to repeat.<br/>
<br/>
Just thought I would share that with everyone, I am having a blast once<br/>
again =)<br/>
