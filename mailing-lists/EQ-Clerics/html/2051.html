&gt;I roamed around kithicor for a few hours last night, I found 4 huts, only<br/>
&gt;three of them I was able to locate over and over the 4th one with the<br/>
&gt;shadowmen for some reason I only saw once.  I tried killing all the undead<br/>
&gt;spawns, I looked on the floors, I found nothing.  I went to befallen<br/>
 </span></blockquote>looking<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;for that Babbin something or other no luck there, I went to HpH and did not<br/>
&gt;find Jovan, I went to runnyeye and there was no Sludge, I even went to OOT<br/>
&gt;but I have no clue what Island that Aviak named gull is on. Needless to say<br/>
&gt;last night was fruitless and a great waste of time.  I am now in<br/>
&gt;Butcherblock mtns and am going to have my hubby try and track Bilge in<br/>
&gt;Dagnors for me, perhaps I will find something eventually.<br/>
&gt;I have no info on what quest gives each piece, I am assuming the quests<br/>
 </span></blockquote>that<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;require 3 enc plat bars are the ones for legs and BP since that armor is<br/>
&gt;more expensive. I just hope all this wasted time is worth the armor we will<br/>
&gt;recieve.  So far all the other classes armor has not been impressive<br/>
&gt;compared to the things my guildmates already have.<br/>
&gt;As i get more details I wil post them and would love to hear from all of<br/>

&gt;&gt;I have been looking for Jovan the Fervent in Highpass hold. No luck yet.<br/>
&gt;&gt;Has anyone seen him?<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;I have also been searching in Kithicor for the burned down hut. I found<br/>
 </span></blockquote>two<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;&gt;of them so far, but no icon/ingots. Near one hut were four shadowed men. I<br/>
&gt;&gt;and another cleric died trying to kill them, thinking that maybe one of<br/>
&gt;&gt;them has a part.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Also, has anyone found the icon in Lake Rathe that belongs to the Reliant?<br/>
