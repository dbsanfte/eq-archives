<div id="ygrps-yiv-244163440">Has anybody gotten any of the Ingots or Icons yet? I wrote them all down,<br/>
doesn&#39;t look like an easy task. The enchanted platinum bars should be a hoot<br/>
to get (125pp each, i believe). Anybody know where to get these the<br/>
cheapest, or is there a mob that drops platinum bars? I&#39;ve seen the Muddites<br/>
in the Gorge drop electrum bars.<br/>
Looks like it&#39;s gonna add a lot of travel for us. Oh well, still better than<br/>
going into the PoF, for now ;)<br/>
