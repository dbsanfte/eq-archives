<b>Subject:</b> Re: Question about dexterity <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1103740589">Well i just thought dexterity might be making us spellcasters focus on the task we are doing,<br/>
be it melee or spellcasting, better. If you think exactly what dexterity means in general not in<br/>
EQ alone i think it has a wider meaning than getting that hammer to hit the nail exactly<br/>
like you want it.<br/>
<br/>
But well i think i will keep my money for those expensive wis items and not spend any money<br/>
on any items that add dex but not wis i have high enough dex already :)<br/>
<br/>
Heh my dwarf is wearing full bronze except for black iron gloves and bracers and i&#39;m happy<br/>
with it. I can still carry enough loot so that i don&#39;t need to go sell things until the end of the<br/>
playing session.<br/>
