&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hello all,<br/>
&gt; I just made 14 recently and wonder if you can help me out with spells.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Any recommendations for 14 lvl spells beside heal and bind?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been thinking about Halo of Light because I hate the dark but<br/>
&gt; I dont want to spend 7pp on something that a lantern does. Does it really<br/>
&gt; help to see around you when your in the dark or is just in the immediate radius?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Can you explain how cancel magic works? Does it remove the negative effects<br/>
&gt; of spells on people?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; How much HP does Symbol of Transal add and what item do you need for it?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The Endure Cold and Endure Disease spells seem pretty useless to me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for help,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Now I&#39;m not familiar of all of the level 14 spells available (it&#39;s been<br/>
a long time for me), but I do believe if smite and expulse undead is<br/>
available to you, get it.  Trust me, those two spells are worth the cost<br/>
in plat.  As for Halo of Light, if you&#39;re willing to give up your head<br/>
armour, then Halo of Light is for you, it does offer you an AC of 3<br/>
though, in case you&#39;re wondering.  The Symbol of Transal is a nice<br/>
addition if you&#39;re looking for HP buffs, it gives you about 60-70+ hit<br/>
points, only problem is that it requires a gem for a reagent (around<br/>
1-6gp at cost I think).<br/>
<br/>
The Endure brand of spells I find useful if you&#39;re ever fighting against<br/>
particular enemies that use certain elements against you.  For example,<br/>
if you&#39;re fighting against something that uses cold as a weapon, endure<br/>
cold will reduce the amount of damage taken off of you.<br/>
