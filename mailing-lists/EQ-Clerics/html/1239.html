<div id="ygrps-yiv-1277440349">Nindar, what you need to do is start grouping with guild peeps and get to know them, and let them get to know you, then you will most likely be invited to join into their guild. Go to Cazic Thule which is almost always full of different guild folks, and a cleric is always welcome.  Generally, most guild members like to do the inviting and sponsoring, but only after they have gotten to know you because they will be vouching for you to the rest of their guildmates.  I get a lot of tells from people I don&#39;t know who see what guild I am, asking me if they can join and would I sponsor them.  But it generally doesn&#39;t work that way, at least with the more respected guilds, because one bad apple can ruin the name of the entire guild.  Grouping with them and getting to know them, and them you, is the way to get into the respected guilds. After you get to know some of them, ask them if you can accompany them on some guild &quot;outings&quot; or to camp some rare items.  If it is a good match up, you will get an invite.<br/>

    Subject: [EQ-Clerics] Rathe Guilds<br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A bit off topic, but does anyone know of any guilds on the Rathe that would suit a 21st level cleric?<br/>
    As the Rathe has aged and gotten a bit overcrowded, I find it harder and harder to find good people to group with as well as very difficult to find places to hunt that aren&#39;t crammed to 200% capacity. I was thinking perhaps that a guild might be able to help me here, by providing information and good groupmates...<br/>
     <br/>
        Any ideas/comments?<br/>
     <br/>
