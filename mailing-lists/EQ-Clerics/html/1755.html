&gt; when you are charmed, you personally cannot control your spells and<br/>
&gt; skills....but the thing that charmed you can....they have control of you<br/>
&gt; and generally seem to use you(the charmee) as offensively as possible.  I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; not sure about the cancel magic thing...it should work.  Maybe sometimes it<br/>
&gt; take 2 cancels to fully remove the affect. </span></blockquote></div>
