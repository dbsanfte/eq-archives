<div id="ygrps-yiv-1972377589">All I can say is that at high levels, you won&#39;t be doing much, if any melee<br/>
at all.  You will be relegated to sitting and medding and buffing/healing<br/>
because you will be doing very high level mobs and your piddling dmg against<br/>
a critter with 15,000 hps is worthless.  You will be needed for two reasons<br/>
only...buffing your tanks and healing them.  Your melee skills won&#39;t be used<br/>
hardly at all.<br/>
