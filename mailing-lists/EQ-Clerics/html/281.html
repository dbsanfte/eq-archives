<div id="ygrps-yiv-1518777186">that&#39;s a really good idea, but getting the lightstones now is a bust...they took<br/>
out looting lightstones and glightstones a while back with a path...now you get<br/>
a burned out lightstone or a nosave lightstone...pretty much worthless....if you<br/>
had one before the patch, you still have it...&lt;have one on both my toons&gt; but<br/>
you can no longer loot em...you still get money off the wisps tho....just root<br/>
and blast...doesn&#39;t always work, but it sure does help....if you need help, get<br/>
a warrior with a combine (; they take the hits, and you can just blast<br/>
away...what i did...(:<br/>

&gt;             Hail again Friends,<br/>
&gt;     Umm money, heheheh thats something you won&#39;t see much of Bro&#39; until<br/>
&gt; about lvl 25 Im lvl 21 and only have like 230pp in my name and I just made<br/>
&gt; all of it at lvl 20 selling  Skulls of Jhen&#39;Tra,and runed totem staffs (once<br/>
&gt; you hit lvl 20 go to Rake Rathtear fight gnoll Ebalmers (easy) for the<br/>
&gt; skulls and high shamans for the staffs)(also easy) then at night when all<br/>
&gt; the undead come out fight Dry Bones where you can find small bronze pieces<br/>
&gt; which sell for a good penny. Okay but for your lvl have no fear I have a<br/>
&gt; great place for you to make money man take the boat from Eruridan&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;wait<br/>
&gt; I can explain this easier whereever you are Qeynos or Euridan take the boat<br/>
&gt; until you hit thje island withj the cat ppl fight wisp!! great money you get<br/>
&gt; lightstones and Greater lightstones sell the light stones to the cat vendor<br/>
&gt; for about 7gp then take the G. Lightstones and sell them to the ppl in<br/>
&gt; either Euridan or Qeynos try the hills or BB..WARNING: DON&quot;T attack teh<br/>
&gt; Kerran Beetles(catsa hate it fopr some reason and will attack you.. Also<br/>
&gt; dont mess with teh spiders they are a bitch poison + hiot hard as hell you<br/>
&gt; can also fight the zombies on the other side of the dock.....)Umm you may<br/>
&gt; want to wait till about lvl 10 for wisp but you can try them just use all<br/>
&gt; your mana to ...??? use your Direct Damage spell forgot the name.Watch out<br/>
&gt; though wisp will group and that hurts you can fight them all the way to lvl<br/>
&gt; 14:)Then go to freeport and ask me later where to lvl. Oh to any one out<br/>
&gt; there who can give me a pointer on where to fight at lvl 21 I&#39;ve tried<br/>
&gt; mistmoore hard to find a group  and tried unrest got tired of the damn<br/>
&gt; goblins killing me when I had to walk there and trains there are awful. Any<br/>
&gt; tips??<br/>
