I don&#39;t think I have misrepresented the case of higher level players<br/>
such as<br/>
myself.  Many of us don&#39;t have certain items we have to camp where<br/>
although<br/>
the mobs don&#39;t give us exp anymore, can still kill us if things turn<br/>
bad.<br/>
We had our level 50 monk die twice yesterday in MM castle from a swarm<br/>
of<br/>
greenies, and once we all had to evac when things got really ugly.  So<br/>
it&#39;s<br/>
really not completely safe for us, even tho we aren&#39;t getting exp.  And<br/>
I<br/>
don&#39;t think we should not be able to get those items anymore and have to<br/>
yield to the lower levels who do get exp. In my opinion, reverse<br/>
discrimination is just as bad as discrimination.  You are still<br/>
penalizing<br/>
one group over another regardless of how you look at it.<br/>
<br/>
Bann:<br/>
Ok,  Mika, you bring this up.....then we have another case to bring up:<br/>
Remember when Plane of Fear opened?  All the higher lvls complained because<br/>
lower levels in guilds were being brought in to get items they could NEVER<br/>
touch on their own.  So what does Verant do to combat this?  (Next to<br/>
tweaking it into the nastiest of places.....)  they put a LEVEL CAP on it.<br/>
Have I yet heard a higher lvl complain an area has a lvl cap?<br/>
Nope....because they can go into it.  That&#39;s discriminating against us<br/>
lowers who may just wanna try to enter into the zone. (See: Ogre warriors<br/>
rushing into PoF at lvl 1)<br/>
<br/>
Its ridiculous for anyone who would RP to say:  Well, now I think anything I<br/>
want should be mine.<br/>
<br/>
Why?  In any other roleplaying game you have their are things you can pass<br/>
by as you go through zones and level, and at a later date...you can NEVER<br/>
touch them, unless you throughly explored.  Verant has tried to encourage<br/>
this NUMEROUS times.  Before this date do you know how Verant wanted this<br/>
issue resolved?  I do...I&#39;ve been thrown into the policy MANY times.....they<br/>
wanted you to TAKE TURNS.  Either, your full group tries to kill the spawn<br/>
once and lets the next try....OR, your group, their group...your<br/>
group....their group.  And the 2nd method is ALWAYS favored.  I had this<br/>
enforced on me not on a rare spawn before....but a NORMAL EXP SPAWN.  (The<br/>
undead chess board in Faydwer.)  Myself, and another gentleman whom wasnt<br/>
even in my group were there for 3 hours,  people came and went, finally this<br/>
one girl comes along, starts slaying EVERYTHING SHE SEES.....EVERYTYHING.<br/>
She tried the spawn spot me and this other guy were sharing.....and we stole<br/>
the kills back.  ONLY on that spot.  And her boyfriend logs on with a 35<br/>
necro (against to lvl 14/15&#39;s and takes everything, and we call a GM in.<br/>
After waiting 2 hours, the gm finally comes in and deals with it....2 hours.<br/>
TWO.  Meanwhile, he followed us anywhere we went.  And then the GM tells us<br/>
to share.....which after 45 mins of watching, and over 10 kills, and KNOWING<br/>
we were not in a group, she told us to do.  Then the GM finally sees what<br/>
the girl is doing and apologized and asked us to move to a different area to<br/>
avoid problems since the other girl didnt want to move.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah....that was fair.  I&#39;ve dealt with this kinda crap since day 1 in EQ.<br/>
I play on Fennin, you want experiences in frustration....try playing there.<br/>
I&#39;ve almost NO HOPE of getting Jboots,  lvl 50&#39;s (since PoF was re-tweaked)<br/>
sit in there DAY AND NIGHT slaying it all....its not on rotation, its KOS.<br/>
They steal ALL.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Mika:<br/>
<br/>
I personally abhor players who because of their level think they can<br/>
bully<br/>
their way in to take over a camp spot.  I also object to players who<br/>
camp<br/>
spots for days to get all their guildmates that item, or to sell them<br/>
either<br/>
IG or on ebay.  Howver, I think petitioning GMs is the way to deal with<br/>
these peeps, or sending feedback to Verant, rather than implementing<br/>
game-wide policy that so adversely impacts one group of players over<br/>
another.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Bann:<br/>
<br/>
A petition can take HOURS to get through....you play on Fennin for a while<br/>
and just see how long it takes for you to get a single petition through MOST<br/>
days.  SOmetimes, and this is saying like 1/10 tries I get an answer within<br/>
20 mins.  Meanwhile you deal with watching this person or group stealing it<br/>
all from you.....and you&#39;ve only got 4 hours online a night (unless its a<br/>
weekend)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Mika:<br/>
<br/>
And just remember, you lower levels today who are cheering this policy<br/>
will,<br/>
one day, fall into the higher level group, and I assure you that your<br/>
feelings will change when you find it is YOUR ox that is being gored.<br/>
My<br/>
only point has always been and still is.....policy should be fair and<br/>
treat<br/>
everyone the same.  No discrimination or reverse discrimination against<br/>
ANY<br/>
one group.  Find another way to deal with the problem and the jerks who<br/>
have<br/>
created it.  Don&#39;t penalize the responsible, mature players as well<br/>
because<br/>
you eventually will run them out of the game, and the only thing you<br/>
will<br/>
have left ARE the jerks.<br/>
<br/>
Mik<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
bann:  I cant wait to fall into this group.  I&#39;m halfway there....I deal<br/>
with not being able to get some of spawns when I was younger by BUYING the<br/>
items because I know how those lower levels FELT.  I still do....especially<br/>
being in the middle now.  What would be your way of making this fair that is<br/>
WORKABLE.....workable that NO ONE could get around it...and you have no<br/>
frustrations from your lower OR higher lvls.   GM responses come VERY<br/>
infrequently, so discount a GM&quot;s response (the lower sits there for hours<br/>
sometimes if he wants a try, and watches his kills stolen even if he WAS<br/>
there first)  Coding this above policy into the game would piss off the<br/>
higher lvls.  If they made the dungeons inaccessable to higher lvls (aka-<br/>
befallen only lvl 1-25)  You&#39;d get pissy about that....(meanwhile the lower<br/>
levels actually have a CHANCE to loot these dungeons for a change.)<br/>
<br/>
You cant EVER manage to please everyone.  I play the game starcraft<br/>
also....I love it....i think its incredibly balanced and know strategies to<br/>
kick anyone&#39;s ass with all 3 players.  Meanwhile, others think its<br/>
INCREDIBLY unbalanced.  Why&gt;?  Because they lose some features in upgrades<br/>
and gain others as well....but they look at their current strategies and<br/>
cant invent NEW ones.<br/>
<br/>
How many upper lvls tell me I cant buy something for PP or Gold anymore<br/>
because &quot;gold and all money is now useless.&quot;  They have NO NEED for it.<br/>
They need items....not cash.  Meanwhile the lower lvls could use cash for<br/>
spells, for trade skills, for armor.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying to look at this from a OVERALL perspective...not a single player.<br/>
The lowers are discriminated in MANY ways already, yet you overlook that<br/>
completely.   How many LOWER LEVEL GM RUN QUESTS are there?  (answer:  maybe<br/>
1 inside a month on ONE server at a time)  All of them deal so far with lvl<br/>
35+ monsters, and the lowers watch items that are unique given to just the<br/>
higher lvls and wish they could do some of the quests to HAVE FUN.  Mostly<br/>
all of the lower lvl quests from NPCS GIVE CRAP.  (yeah, how useless is 3<br/>
copper for some of these quests?)<br/>
<br/>
You have to view this game as a WHOLE.  This would cause lvl 50&#39;s to<br/>
actually get rid of their excess cash.  and the lowers could sell their<br/>
items for a change.  This game has been changing since we started in it.<br/>
We&#39;ve been given res changes (downgraded) and downgraded DD<br/>
spells....(retribution)  But I dont see as much complaining about it as<br/>
this.<br/>
