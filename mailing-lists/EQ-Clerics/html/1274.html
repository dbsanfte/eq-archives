<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Its funny to see this on a CLERICAL  HELP list first off....secondly....why<br/>
&gt;cant you go and BUY the item from the lower levels then?  Granted, you cant<br/>
&gt;do this with all of the lower levels....but do you know how often I&#39;ve had<br/>
&gt;higher levels come in without as many principles as most of you?  Why dont<br/>
&gt;you start bitching at those who HAVE gone and made this a problem?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Simply because it&#39;s not our place to start bitching at those who have gone<br/>
and made this problem.  Doing so would not solve any problems, it would just<br/>
aggravate us.  Sure, some higher levels are jerks, but should everyone be<br/>
penalized for it?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Example:  I&#39;m in Blackburrow one day.  The onyx earrings have to be one of<br/>
&gt;the SIMPLEST things to get ahold of.  A Magician, lvl 27 walks in, says he&#39;s<br/>
&gt;here to get the earring, and he&#39;ll take everything until he does....if we<br/>
&gt;dont like it....LEAVE.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well then, I would simply take this persons name down, see if he is in a<br/>
guild, and then post a message on the proper message boards to warn people<br/>
off about him.  Granted, there&#39;s not a whole lot you can do about it, but at<br/>
least you can try to warn other peeps about this moron&#39;s practices.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Yeah, this is a great attitude people. We had 2 of the damn things to sell,<br/>
&gt;and offered them and his answer:  &quot;WHy should I buy from a lower level when<br/>
&gt;I can get them myself.&quot;  Or then we have the fact that I can pick these<br/>
&gt;suckers up at HOW MANY merchants?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So you assume that all high level players have this attitude?  If not, what<br/>
bearing does this have on the original question, is it fair to displace<br/>
players who don&#39;t get xp for a mob, in deference to those players that do?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;For the paw of opalla quest you could EASILY purchase the damn rings from<br/>
&gt;lower levels who got them....not only does it get rid of some of that cash<br/>
&gt;you had sitting around doing NOTHING, but it keeps everyone happy.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Easily?  Do you know how long I&#39;ve been waiting to purchase just the<br/>
platinum ring for this quest?  About a good 3 weeks now, if not longer.  Not<br/>
a single one have I seen for sale at a bazaar or otherwise.  Sure, the<br/>
silver and copper are easy to come by, I&#39;ll give you that much, but the gold<br/>
and platinum rings are all but impossible to buy.  I&#39;ve also spent a<br/>
ludicrous amount of time waiting for Gynok Moltor, just like everyone else has.<br/>
