<div id="ygrps-yiv-794790272">Hello.  I just have two questions.  First, does anyone know the stats for all <br/>
our summoned weapons?  I presently have the first one, but I don&#39;t use it <br/>
anymore.  I&#39;m curious if our higher level ones are any better.  Second, does <br/>
anyone have any screen shots of what our plane of fear armor looks like?  Not <br/>
the info when you right click it, but what it looks like when you wear it.  I <br/>
think it&#39;s the ethereal mist armor set.  You can send them to me instead of <br/>
cluttering up the list.  Thanks!<br/>
