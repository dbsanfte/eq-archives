<div id="ygrps-yiv-820623282">The night of the event I heard GM&#39;s say the undead will stay in Kithicor<br/>
Forest.  Last I checked the Rathe Server still didn&#39;t have them due to that<br/>
nasty little problem that happened after the event.<br/>
But GM&#39;s said the Kithicor was no longer a safe zone.<br/>

&gt; I was under the impression that these undead creatures were just part of<br/>
&gt; the event for opening the plane of hate.  Can anyone confirm that these<br/>
&gt; creatures are still spawning?  That morning star looks nice.<br/>
