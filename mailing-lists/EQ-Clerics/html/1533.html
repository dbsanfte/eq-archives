<div id="ygrps-yiv-1154041765">A lot of modern games still support IPX it&#39;s true, and it does provide a<br/>
lower ping on a LAN than IP (eg 5ms vs 50ms) but it&#39;s fast becoming a legacy<br/>
protocol where games are concerned. Even if games run on a LAN and not over<br/>
the internet, odds are they should support IP as well, either because it&#39;s<br/>
not much extra code (if they&#39;re using Winsock) or because they roll their<br/>
own BSD sockets code, equally fairly easy.<br/>
<br/>
In modern games with decent latency handling, a 50ms ping can easily be<br/>
handled. 5ms is nice, but 50ms isn&#39;t going to break the bank.<br/>
<br/>
I found that getting rid of IPX was a small price to pay for stopping my<br/>
computer hitting 1/5 FPS for 30 seconds every 10 minutes or so.</div>
