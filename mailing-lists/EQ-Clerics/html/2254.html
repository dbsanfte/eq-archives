<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1650039916">I really love it when I have to tell a tank to please use his taunt button.  If<br/>
I stay with him long he better be using it often.  Every class has it&#39;s members<br/>
who play their character a different one than was intended.  The cleric or<br/>
enchanter that casts DD are the best examples because both of these classes make<br/>
a group perform much better with less risks when we do OTHER things.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also seen a ranger or druid not use snare, a couple warriors who got up out<br/>
of their chair when fighting and did something else (casters and I took a<br/>
beating, but it was funny to hear a ranger and a warrior ask for a res after we<br/>
booted them out of the group while we moved on).<br/>
<br/>
Now, that being said, who&#39;s responsibility is it to play that class?  It&#39;s not<br/>
the warrior&#39;s responsibility to play a cleric, if he wanted to play a cleric<br/>
then he should go create one.  I did want to play an enchanter so I did create<br/>
one and now I know TONS about the class.  If that cleric is causing you lots of<br/>
down time or people die, then suggest (in a nice way) things he could do to<br/>
improve on his tactics.  If he doesn&#39;t get it, change groups.  If he does get it<br/>
and everyone is happy, you just made a really good friend.<br/>
<br/>
I burn all the time, I also stun the hell out of MOBs and that helps save me a<br/>
TON on mana.  Everyone needs the chance to get to learn what their class can and<br/>
can&#39;t do.  This is a growth process.  At level 20, a clerics melee skills really<br/>
aren&#39;t THAT bad compared to a hybrid&#39;s.  Their weapon skills should be at 80,<br/>
while the tank classes are at 100.  The biggest difference is the double<br/>
attack/duel wield.  Rangers get both as do warriors, paladins and SKs only get<br/>
double attack.  And the hybrids start getting these between level 17 and 20 so<br/>
the skill is still fairly low.  This starts to change by level 22 or 23, but<br/>
clerics can still melee into their 30s and make a dent before sitting down to<br/>
get that first heal off.  Its really after level 35 that it becomes a total<br/>
waste of time to do melee, althought I did kill the EXG for both a CGS and a<br/>
Charred BP yesterday.  The CWG Model EXG is 100% magic resistant so I HAD to<br/>
melee it, so I just healed myself while I swung my mace.  Now if I could just<br/>
get double attack and . . . .   LOL  (no thanks).<br/>
<br/>
One thing I do not advocate- no not tell someone else they suck or are not<br/>
playing their character right.  If you were to ever tell me how to play my game,<br/>
I&#39;d tell you to start their own cleric, find another healer, or just let me do<br/>
my job.<br/>
