<div id="ygrps-yiv-100221241">I don&#39;t think AC is that easy but yes theres things to it that are way too<br/>
easy.  Like getting armor, I was lvl 3-4 and already had kinda nice armor,<br/>
maybe it was cause it didn&#39;t cost much and the fact you get money very easy.<br/>
But getting lvls might be easy but from what I&#39;ve read there is no lvl cap<br/>
at all so you can get as many lvls as you like (I like that in an RPG), same<br/>
goes for your skills.  I haven&#39;t really messed with the spell system yet but<br/>
I do know if ppl would report bugs, and ideas on how to make AC better<br/>
instade of &quot;I played it a few time and it wasn&#39;t good so I quit playing, EQ<br/>
is for me&quot; then maybe AC will be better.<br/>
Ppl did that with EQ, I remember in Phase 3 and 4 I read post after post<br/>
where ppl were saying &quot;This game has to many bugs in, I&#39;m never playing this<br/>
thing again&quot;.  Maybe if more ppl would&#39;ve reported buys and their ideas on<br/>
how to make EQ better we&#39;d have even a better EQ to play, but instade they<br/>
left to never play again.<br/>
Another thing about Asheron&#39;s Call is the fact I think ppl are trying to<br/>
compare it to EQ too much.  Can&#39;t do that cause AC is not EQ and I doubt the<br/>
company wants it to be.  Ppl are saying AC is just another UO, wrong.  I&#39;ve<br/>
played UO and it totally sucked but I really enjoy AC, I don&#39;t see where ppl<br/>
get the idea AC is like UO.  Yes they need to add banks in the game, maybe<br/>
work on the spell system and a few other things, but instade of ppl leaving<br/>
it maybe they should try telling them their ideas on how to make AC better<br/>
and then maybe they&#39;ll like the game.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m glad you liked it.  Personally, I lasted about 3 hours the first time<br/>
&gt; and maybe another additional 4 hours total.  I made level 5 in no time<br/>

&gt; &gt; You hafta connect through Sonys Station for EQ, so either way you<br/>
&gt; &gt; have to go<br/>
&gt; &gt; through a gaming type zone.  Maybe AC&#39;s is a lot different but by the<br/>

&gt; &gt; playing AC for<br/>
&gt; &gt; 2-3 mins.  Both are good games, everyone whined about how EQ&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; interface and<br/>
&gt; &gt; all that, AC&#39;s seems to be better yet I&#39;ve read in a few places ppl are<br/>
&gt; &gt; saying it&#39;s worse.  I don&#39;t find AC hard to play at all, it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; easy to learn,<br/>
&gt; &gt; have pretty good graphics, gameplay is easy and I think AC feels<br/>
&gt; &gt; more like a<br/>
&gt; &gt; real RPG then EQ does on how they handle skills and all that.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Asheron&#39;s Call isn&#39;t really Microsoft, it&#39;s Turbine&#39;s.  Microsoft is<br/>
&gt; &gt; just<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the publisher, Turbine is making it.  And it&#39;s not all that<br/>
&gt; &gt; bad they are<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; still working on it.  Give it time don&#39;t judge it till it&#39;s<br/>
