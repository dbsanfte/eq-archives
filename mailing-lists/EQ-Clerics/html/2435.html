<div id="ygrps-yiv-894937781">Chris, you can raise your fraction by doing the prayer bead quest and also by<br/>
killing the rabid wolves and bear in Qeynos hills. You turn the rabid pelts<br/>
into the Temple of  Life for fraction and experience. I always tried for the<br/>
bears as you get good experience and a spell that if you can not use you can<br/>
sell it. Just be careful you do not run into Holly or the Ranger who will kill<br/>
you, even though  you are getting rid of the diseased population.<br/>
My fraction problem was the opposite in Rivervale and I had to spend a lot of<br/>
time building up my fraction there by doing quests. Good luck<br/>

&gt; Hi all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I want to do the SSoL quest.  I am a 16th level Hafling cleric of<br/>
&gt; Bristlebane.  The problem, I think lies with my faction in the Temple of<br/>
&gt; Life. Aeston Wemur cons apprehensive, and when I ask him for the<br/>
&gt; instructions, he gives them to me, until I ask him about travelling afar,<br/>
&gt; after which he says that the word is out not to trust me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; THis particualarily sucks because I gave him the honeyjum, and instead of<br/>
&gt; giving me the potion, he said my name was bad, not to trust me, etc. And he<br/>
&gt; took my honeyjum!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So, my question is, how do I raise my faction with the Temple of Life?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
