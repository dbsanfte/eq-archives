<div id="ygrps-yiv-1533988584">While it is quite annoying that this has changed - and changed this late<br/>
in the history of the project, it doesn&#39;t bother me too much.  Honestly, I<br/>
could do without asking people to res their 3 2 day old corpses that they<br/>
have been &#39;saving for you&#39; the second I enter a zone.  Or being told by<br/>
someone on the other side of the world that next time I stop by a particular<br/>
zone, could I &#39;pls rez them&#39;.<br/>
    I&#39;m also not too annoyed by the new staff with 10 charges of<br/>
resurrection that one of the dragons dropped (as long as it can&#39;t be<br/>
recharged - can anything in this game be recharged?) - this thing is going<br/>
to be so rare that the owner would be crazy to use any of the charges and<br/>
cut down it&#39;s resale value (especially when they can get res&#39;d for free from<br/>
one of their 50th cleric friends)<br/>
