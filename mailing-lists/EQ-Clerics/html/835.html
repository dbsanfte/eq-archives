<div id="ygrps-yiv-1138414372">i agree....i heard a rumor that they might raise it to 60, but that from 50 to<br/>
60 would all be hell levels....that&#39;s an interesting option....not only would<br/>
there just be 10 levels, but it would feel like 20.....even moreso depending on<br/>
how many times you died....wonder what new spells they&#39;d emplement<br/>
tho.....they&#39;d have to have at least one more spell level....what would be<br/>
better then ressurection tho? &lt;points to ponder&gt; (;<br/>

&gt; Um, not raising the level cap would be a really, really bad idea. High level<br/>
&gt; characters would leave in droves for Asheron&#39;s Call, Middle Earth, whatever<br/>
&gt; else is out there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Part of the fun, and the addictive factor, of RPG&#39;s is the illusion of<br/>
&gt; growth: every day you get stronger, more powerful, able to to places you<br/>
&gt; were not able to before -- cf. the Plane of Fear discussion -- and<br/>
&gt; successfully kill critters that you would have run in terror from a few<br/>
&gt; levels before.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If characters stop growing, a lot of the fun of the game is gone. I hit the<br/>
&gt; level cap in Balder&#39;s Gate about midway through Chapter 4...and lost<br/>
&gt; interest in the game a few days later. Haven&#39;t finished it, probably won&#39;t<br/>
&gt; ever.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am not sure why Verant would NOT want to raise the level cap.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I imagine there might be ways to fake it. For example, besides items that<br/>
&gt; raise stats, there might be items that raised one&#39;s Offensive or Defensive<br/>
&gt; or weapons capabilities beyond their caps at level 50, making you<br/>
&gt; effectively a level 55 or 60 or higher character, even though you are still<br/>
&gt; nominally level 50. Hm. That might be interesting.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Still, I think Verant has to do something to allow players to increase their<br/>
&gt; capabilities beyond 50, and to provide challenging places for them to go to<br/>
&gt; exercise those capabilities, if they want to retain their player base.<br/>
