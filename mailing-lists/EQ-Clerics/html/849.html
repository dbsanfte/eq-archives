<div id="ygrps-yiv-552058752">I picked up a Shining Star of Light the other day.  Just some words of<br/>
advice for anyone trying this quest.  It starts in Qeynos, true, but<br/>
the first thing you need is from Rivervale.  My faction was &#39;dubious&#39;<br/>
and I still got it, but the npc still gave me crap.  I went ahead and<br/>
spent a couple of days there just raising faction with them.  By the<br/>
time I got to Qeynos, I was indifferent with the priests there, and<br/>
they wouldn&#39;t give me the quest.  There is a quest to deliver blessed<br/>
oil flasks to west karana.  Best thing to do is bind yourself near the<br/>
temple and deliver the flask to west karana and then gate back;<br/>
repeat.  You need to improve the priestsoflife faction.  Killing<br/>
gnolls won&#39;t do that.<br/>
  My friend actually got me the mace.  I gave him my item, and before<br/>
he got the mace, he gave me his.  Saved me a heck of a lot of time.<br/>
He had been working on his faction for a while before I arrived.<br/>
<br/>
Once you get it, the guy says, if you want to [recharge the shining<br/>
star of life] talk to soandso in the storeroom.  He called it the<br/>
shining star of LIFE.  Interesting.  Does anyone know how many charges<br/>
this thing has, or how long it&#39;s gonna last me before I have to make<br/>
another trip back to Qeynos?</div>
