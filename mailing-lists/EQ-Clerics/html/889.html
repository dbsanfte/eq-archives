<div id="ygrps-yiv-1257492709">I can only concur.  As a child of Hate, my only duty is to tend to <br/>
Innoruuk&#39;s followers to ensure his greater glory.  All others are merely <br/>
fuel to feed his fires, like kindling.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I&#39;m new to this mail list, and thought I would introduce myself with a <br/>
&gt;topic<br/>
&gt; &gt; to discuss.  I&#39;ve often wondered what exactly it means to be a cleric in<br/>
&gt; &gt; Norrath.  My personal opinion is that we should always be merciful to <br/>
&gt;those<br/>
&gt; &gt; around us, and help in any way we can.  Even if to heal someone we don&#39;t <br/>
&gt;even<br/>
&gt; &gt; know completely depletes our mana.  What do you think of this?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Perhaps that is what Karana asks of you.<br/>
&gt;But Innoruk is the God of Hate and Pain. Pain is real. You can&#39;t<br/>
&gt;avoid it. of all the gods, he is the only one honest with his followers.<br/>
&gt;He WANTS us killing everything. So why should I use the powers he gives<br/>
&gt;me on those who do not followhim, and will actively work against him?<br/>
