<div id="ygrps-yiv-1659362473">I&#39;m at work.  I, like you, try to play all night, and then come to<br/>
work, only to read about the game, surf web sites about the game, look<br/>
at maps, read about items.  And today I went to lunch with two of my<br/>
friends and we talked about the game (they play too).  Is that an<br/>
addiction, or what?<br/>

&gt;Just wondering...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;...if I&#39;m the only one who sits at work all day, reading these messages as<br/>
&gt;they come in. Its bad enough I play all night.  Now, between surfing for EQ<br/>
&gt;info, reading the newsgroup, and reading this list, its a wonder I get<br/>
&gt;anything done at all!<br/>
