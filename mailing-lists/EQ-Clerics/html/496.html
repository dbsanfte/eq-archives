<div id="ygrps-yiv-1178379437">Not to bag on anyone or anything but inorder to properlly do that test you <br/>
would need to more or less drain your mana right after taking off the +Wis <br/>
items...<br/>
<br/>
What I mean is that: your at FM, you remove your +wis items, your mana is <br/>
still FM for when you did have the +wis items.  So the test is not correct.<br/>
<br/>
I know as of right now my big +7 wis I get though my items at lvl 19 give me <br/>
about 40 extra spell points.  That is not much but remember that is ONLY +7 <br/>
and at 19!!!!! For those that want you can goto this site and use the mana <br/>
cal. to find out what your base mana is as well as what your adjusted mana <br/>
is.<br/>

&gt;2 Extra bars of Mana????? I find that impossible, I have tested the Wisdom<br/>
&gt;item theory.  Let me say this my base Wisdom was 89, with all the items I<br/>
&gt;had that added wisdom, i was at 124.<br/>
&gt;I conducted a test...I removed all of my Wisdom granting items so my wis <br/>
&gt;was<br/>
&gt;89. I began to cast Greater healing ( I did not fizzle) I was able to cast<br/>
&gt;it 5 times( 150 per cast).....I then tried to cast Holy Might ( 35 per<br/>
&gt;cast ) and was unbable to.....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I then put all of my WIS items back on so my wis was 124 i once again cast<br/>
&gt;greater healing 5 times ( no fizzle 150 per cast)....with the BS MANA I had<br/>
&gt;left over i was able to cast ONE holy might (35 MANA) and one flash of <br/>
&gt;light<br/>
&gt;(12 MANA). SO, with this test i have decided that instead of using ALL my<br/>
&gt;item slots to try to bring up wisdom, which is a complete waste of time, I<br/>
&gt;would get some really good wis Items( like plus 6 wis ring, Adementite<br/>
&gt;epolets, ETC) and i would replace some items with DEX, yes DEX increasings<br/>
&gt;items.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;DEX does directly affect your ability to cast while being hit, not to<br/>
&gt;mention if you have a weapon that randomly casts an effect, DEX plays a<br/>
&gt;great part in how Often it works.  I have seen it make a difference with <br/>
&gt;our<br/>
&gt;regular gnome wizard, who naturally has a high DEX( she is over 115)She can<br/>
&gt;literally cast almost any spell while being hit,I will estimate that she is<br/>
&gt;interrupted only 10% of the time, I have seen her Gate from terrible<br/>
&gt;situations while being completely pounded and my in-game husband, has found<br/>
&gt;great success with his DEX over 105 now, Our Paladins DEX is 117, and even<br/>
&gt;though he has no DD spells, his Ghoulbane is much much more effective<br/>
&gt;against the undead, My DEX is now 100 and I have seen a difference in my<br/>
&gt;casting, then gnome and I were medding in Soluseks eye ons day when someoen<br/>
&gt;trained a boat load of nasties by us, they took an extreme liking to me, I<br/>
&gt;was able to cast greater heal on myself 5 successive times without being<br/>
&gt;interrupted.<br/>
&gt;So, that is my rant, i feel very strongly about it, WIS is good don&#39;t get <br/>
&gt;me<br/>
&gt;wrong, but there will NEVER be a way to add enough wisdom to make a really<br/>
&gt;big difference in the Mana that I have. SO i sacfrifice a small amount of<br/>
&gt;mana, while gaining a better ability to help people while in battle, I <br/>
&gt;think<br/>
&gt;the trade off is fair. By the way,  Yes channeling is a great factor in<br/>
&gt;recovering as well.<br/>

&gt; &gt;well, me personally, i think it&#39;s channelling that helps you recover from<br/>
&gt;being hit and still<br/>
&gt; &gt;casting.....i could be wrong, but i believe that&#39;s what it is....also,<br/>
&gt;later on, it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt;important to have as much mana as you can, so i&#39;d invest in wis adding<br/>
&gt;items......believe me,<br/>
&gt; &gt;that can go along way....for example, i died today &lt;yeah i know i&#39;m not<br/>
&gt;supposed to do that,<br/>
&gt; &gt;but it happens&gt;....well, when i got back and looted my corpse, from all <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;wis adding items<br/>
&gt; &gt;i have, it gave me 2 extra bars of mana....base wis 95 and with items,<br/>
&gt;138....this was on lv<br/>
&gt; &gt;40, so it does make a difference<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; I have question to you fellow clerics that would like to have a clear<br/>
&gt;answer to. The<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; question is that does dexterity effect in spellcasting any way? Does it<br/>
&gt;make us<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; to recover from mobs interrupting our spellcasting better? I have heard<br/>
&gt;some<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; clerics claim this. I have a dex of 98 and i do find it quite often <br/>
&gt;that<br/>
&gt;even if critters<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; hit me HARD i am able to cast a healing spell. I have even gated <br/>
&gt;several<br/>
&gt;times<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; out from a heated battle while being hit for a total of 70 dmg.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Just thinking if buying those jewellery craft items that raise dex are<br/>
&gt;worth it :)<br/>
