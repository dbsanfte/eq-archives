<div id="ygrps-yiv-349670029">I agree with your point, but you are misinterpreting what I am saying. You<br/>
don&#39;t need to be fighting monsters 20 levels above, and I didn&#39;t say this<br/>
was what was happening. This game can be played with monsters 5 levels above<br/>
you, or maybe a little more. All you have to get in, under the scenario<br/>
described, is one or two blows. You will be credited with a solo kill, and<br/>
get a large amount of experience, much more than you could earn fighting<br/>
blues or even whites on your own, or yellows or reds in a group. You will<br/>
level with unnatural rapidity.<br/>
<br/>
I know this happens, a fellow group member described it being done for him.<br/>
I don&#39;t think it happens very often; upper level people get tired of it ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I suppose the only point is that in any complex system, people will try to<br/>
&#39;game&#39; the system, exploiting its weak points for maximum advantage.<br/>

&gt;Umm, no. Have you ever tried to hit a creature 20 levels above you with<br/>
&gt;either your weapon OR your spells? You WON&#39;T.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Heard of another way that may be even faster. Buff yer newbie, as above.<br/>
&gt;&gt; Have the high levels pick on a tough monster. Knock it down to a<br/>
&gt;&gt; tiny bit of<br/>
&gt;&gt; health left.. then zone. Let the newbie take the few remaining hp off it.<br/>
&gt;&gt; Instant huge xp for the newbie. I can believe you could bring a newbie to<br/>
&gt;&gt; levle 20 in 5 real-time hours with this technique.<br/>
