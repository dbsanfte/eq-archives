<div id="ygrps-yiv-1744867320">that&#39;s all well and good job security, but the drop on armor seems too rare for<br/>
that.....had 6 clerics there tonight...about the same amnt of worry wraiths were<br/>
pulled....6-8...only one dropped with armor....as compared to the tentacle<br/>
tormenters that drop the ranger armor....about 4 i htink were pulled, and 3<br/>
loaded with armor...what kinda screwed ratio is that?<br/>

&gt; Good point.  We agree the low levels should be curbed from getting there,<br/>
&gt; the how is left for some debate.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;You feel a sense of foreboding as you approach the gate.  You feel you can<br/>
&gt; go no further.&quot;   Good enough...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Still, I think something should occur if you move into another dimension.<br/>
&gt; Its not like passing from North to South Karana after all...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And more along the topic of clerics, the gate damage would mean more groups<br/>
&gt; would need us clerics to go with them, right?<br/>
&gt; Sounds to me like job security!<br/>

&gt;         I think what would be better if it could be done is have the gate<br/>
&gt; setup to<br/>
&gt;         where you HAVE to be a certin Lvl to get in, say you should be lvl<br/>
&gt; 35 to get<br/>
&gt;         in if you&#39;re not at least Lvl 35 the gate kicks you back out.  Plus<br/>
&gt; if this<br/>
&gt;         Plane of Fear is suppose to be so hard then why not have the zone<br/>
&gt; before it<br/>
&gt;         harder so these low lvl players can&#39;t even get close to it?<br/>

&gt;         &gt; And if the gate damage had been in the game from day one, would<br/>
&gt; there be<br/>
&gt;         &gt; complaints?  I say far less...<br/>
&gt;         &gt; Should all of Norrath be available to every player from the get<br/>
&gt; go?  I say<br/>
&gt;         &gt; no...<br/>
&gt;         &gt;<br/>
&gt;         &gt; Hill giants and griffins kill low levels too...but we have<br/>
&gt; accepted that<br/>
&gt;         as<br/>
&gt;         &gt; part of the game.  If the damage gate had been there from day one,<br/>
&gt; it<br/>
&gt;         would<br/>
&gt;         &gt; have been more along the lines of &quot;Cool!  You can&#39;t even gate<br/>
&gt; there and<br/>
&gt;         &gt; survive until you are level xx!&quot;<br/>
&gt;         &gt;<br/>
&gt;         &gt; Brad stated the Plane of Fear was supposed to be hard, in the<br/>
&gt; context of<br/>
&gt;         &gt; hard for very high level characters.<br/>
&gt;         &gt; May seem elitist, but I think the high level players will probably<br/>
&gt;         &gt; appreciate this more than hate it...keeping the lower levels out<br/>
&gt; so they<br/>
&gt;         can<br/>
&gt;         &gt; focus on themselves and not having to save newbies that just<br/>
&gt; wander in to<br/>
&gt;         &gt; the Plane of Fear.  And how does that sound?  &quot;I just wandered in<br/>
&gt; to the<br/>
&gt;         &gt; Plane of Fear...ho hum.&quot;<br/>
&gt;         &gt;<br/>
&gt;         &gt; And it also proves to be an achievement of sorts, being able to<br/>
&gt; warp into<br/>
&gt;         &gt; the Plane of Fear and survive the shock that would kill the<br/>
&gt; average<br/>
&gt;         person.<br/>
&gt;         &gt; I am all for a Plane that causes damage when you enter it...makes<br/>
&gt; it more<br/>
&gt;         &gt; ominous and harsh!  Is the Plane of Fear supposed to be a cake<br/>
&gt; walk?<br/>
&gt;         &gt;<br/>
&gt;         &gt; This is not a flame, I am just stating a counterpoint.<br/>
