<div id="ygrps-yiv-2122919224">The cleric is left out from bad groups not good ones. If a BI medallion came<br/>
up or a PBB I had first call because I was always sat staring at a blank<br/>
page whilst the mage got to play with the enemy......<br/>
<br/>
I would make this clear that i got first shout and re spiked collars as a<br/>
warrior I never wanted to give up my ringmail/banded/bronze...etc for such a<br/>
poor item and I must say as a cleric I preferred my bronze one too the extra<br/>
AC is just too much to give away especially as later you cast one heal spell<br/>
mid combat in places such as MM and the 500 damage the rest of the party has<br/>
dealt out suddenly becomes nothing and bam 3 familiars on me...<br/>
<br/>
Basically get the rules straight when afetr class specific items dont get<br/>
walked over and if you dont like it move on is my advice..<br/>
