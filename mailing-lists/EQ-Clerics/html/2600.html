<div id="ygrps-yiv-24643289">Well I see what you mean, I don&#39;t see a rouge dwarf smithing, but I do see a elvish ranger fletching. I suppose it really depends.<br/>
<br/>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
Er. I see the dwarf connection to smithing. I don&#39;t see the other two.<br/>
Why would my druid want to fletch? Or my bard for that matter?<br/>
<br/>
And I see high elves as the jewelry type. Gnomes have tinkering already.<br/>
High Elves are so proud, they would be the one to perfect such an idea.<br/>
<br/>
However, I think that this would not be something to add after the<br/>
game is already out, etc. it should have been added before, if at all.</div>
