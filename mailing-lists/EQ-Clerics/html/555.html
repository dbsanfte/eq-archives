<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1676750402">So if you back away from a MOB does it follow you. If it did n&#39;t that would<br/>
make sense.<br/>
It is supposed to be blind after all. <br/>
That might give you time to do a heal or too before getting back into the<br/>
fray.<br/>
<br/>
Always looking for alternative tactics. FOL 12 Mana Vs 40 for Fear. <br/>
<br/>
Does it have a strong resist rate?<br/>

FOL will temporarily blind your opponent (obviously).....but that doesnt<br/>
stop them from swinging their weapon...if they are in range to hit you,<br/>
they will. I have found that against npcs FOL is pretty useless, they seem<br/>
to hit just as much, and it doesnt seem to last very long.  As stated<br/>
earlier, PvP is where it is really useful....they dont stop their attack,<br/>
but you can run away, and they will have no idea where you went...pretty<br/>
good if you have to escape, or you just wanna buy a little time.  <br/>

&gt;So you FOL but what does it do?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Does the MOB temporarily stop his attack. <br/>
&gt;In a PvP does the other PC have to stop his attack. Or can he stand still<br/>
&gt;melee away or keep blasting you?<br/>

&gt;&gt; Can you discuss a little how you use Flash of Light? I bought it, I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;&gt; think I have ever used it. I have seen it written that is is mainly good<br/>
&gt;for<br/>
&gt;&gt; PvP, which I don&#39;t do. How does it work against monsters?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Actually, it IS most effective in a PvP situation, but even against<br/>
&gt;monsters, it&#39;s useful &#39;til about level 9 or so when you get Furor. =)<br/>
&gt;Flash of light to blind, then heal your compeers.  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In a fight, however, it&#39;s not THAT effective as an offensive tool -<br/>
&gt;again, it&#39;s PvP where it shines.  Against beasties, you CAN FoL and then<br/>
&gt;fear them, but they always know exactly where to come back. <br/>
&gt;-- <br/>
&gt;We cross our bridges when we come to them and burn them behind<br/>
&gt;us, with nothing to show for our progress but the memory of the smell<br/>
&gt;of smoke and the presumption that once our eyes watered.<br/>
