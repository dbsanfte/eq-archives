<b>Subject:</b> 1hb vs. 2hb (was: Question) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-605573401">This is an age-old clerical debate, Patrick.  I think the general<br/>
consensus is that it&#39;s whatever you want.  There are some very good<br/>
2hb weapons, but you sacrifice not having a shield.  I think a lot of<br/>
high level clerics really like having a mace in 1 hand, and either<br/>
a paw of opallo or testament in the other, or maybe a nice shield,<br/>
charred guardian, or shiny brass, or whathaveyou.  Personally, I used<br/>
1 handed blunt all the way to around 12-13th level when I switched to<br/>
a bloodforge hammer, which I still use at 17th.  In fact just last<br/>
night my 2hb skill surpassed my 1hb skill at 54 vs. 53 (max is 72) so<br/>
both of them are suffering a bit due to my switching.  I figure at<br/>
some point I will dump some skill points into these to raise them a<br/>
bit, since they increase so slowly.<br/>
  I figure that around 20th I will go get a screaming mace, and I will<br/>
do the testament of venear quest, which I will hold in my off hand.<br/>
<br/>
Tunare be with you<br/>
Ergo, 17th level high elf cleric - test<br/>
Guildmaster - Hand of Tunare<br/>

&gt;Hail my friends.  I am new to the clerical ranks and<br/>
&gt;had a question about weapons.  I&#39;ve read a few guides<br/>
&gt;though there seems to be some conflict on weapons.<br/>
&gt;Some guides say one-handed blunt, another say<br/>
&gt;two-handed blunt, and lastly, some say both.  I would<br/>
&gt;just like to know what everyone else thinks on the<br/>
&gt;subject.  Any other tips (as in armor, spells,<br/>
&gt;hunting, etc) for a young dwarven clerics (lvl4) would<br/>
&gt;be great too.  Thanks.<br/>

&gt;P.S.  There be any good cleric websites with like<br/>
&gt;clerial weapons and stragies and very descriptive<br/>
&gt;spell definitions (like eq.castersrealm.com but for<br/>
&gt;clerics? ::duck::).<br/>
