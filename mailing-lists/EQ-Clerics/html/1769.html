 </span></blockquote>It casts it on one player at a time. One time an evil eye charmed me, so I<br/>
started beating on my partner, although I didn&#39;t cast any spells. Then the<br/>
eye charmed him, and we just followed the thing around for a little while,<br/>
unable to do anything but laugh (to ourselves, we weren&#39;t able to type).<br/>
<br/>
As for forgetting spells before you get charmed, it&#39;s not really an option,<br/>
since the spell takes effect instantly. If you really tried, you could<br/>
forget one spell before it hits you. As long as you can recognize that its<br/>
the charm spell being cast, and not another.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>From about level 20 to 24, I recommend the aviak guards in Lake Rathe. They<br/>
can be soloed for the most part, root and nuke works well with a bit of<br/>
melee to finish them off. If you can get into a group, the aviak village in<br/>
South Karana is also very good.<br/>
<br/>
That being said, I would probably have hunted a lot more in Unrest if my<br/>
system had a bit more processing power. The slowdown I got in there was only<br/>
bearable for short periods.<br/>
