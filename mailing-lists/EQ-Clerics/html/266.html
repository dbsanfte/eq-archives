<div id="ygrps-yiv-1518339333">Thanks to both you & The Scotts for your explanations...I FINALLY<br/>
understand!<br/>
<br/>
Heh, but I have a follow-up question &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
Why bother EVER specializing in anything but the one you want over 50?  Umm,<br/>
rephrased:<br/>
<br/>
When you specialize (at skill lvl 1), do you immediately start seeing<br/>
mana/casting/recovery time in that spell-type?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m only GUESSING the answer is that when you specialize (even at lvl 1)<br/>
your mana goes further.  As you go up in Specialization, your mana (cost per<br/>
spell in time/mana/recovery) goes even further until you reach 50.  At 51,<br/>
your main Specialization continues its mana-costsavings while your other 4<br/>
Specializations - while not getting worse - languish behind your main<br/>
Specialization.<br/>
<br/>
Does that make sense, and am I close to understanding?<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ok...let me try to explain very very simply =)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When you specialize in a skill, that is completely seperate from your<br/>
normal<br/>
&gt; skill, (EX. Alteration). My cleric isnt high enough to specialize, but I<br/>
&gt; have a level 25 magician who has specialized in both Conjuration and<br/>
&gt; Evocation. I use Conjuration alot more, so I will let that one go past the<br/>
&gt; 50 mark. Once the SPECIALIZATION skill goes over 50, that ONE will be the<br/>
&gt; skill you master at...the other skills that you specialize will be capped<br/>
at<br/>
&gt; 50. That does not mean that your actual skill in Conjuration or any other<br/>
&gt; skill will stop moving up. Look at Specialization as another skill<br/>
entirely.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Once you are able to specialize (I beleive you have to be level 30 to do<br/>
&gt; that as a Cleric) you will need to go to your guild trainer, and put ONE<br/>
&gt; point in whatever skill you want to specialize in. As a cleric, I will<br/>
want<br/>
&gt; to do Alteration, so I use less mana when I heal, cast faster, and with<br/>
less<br/>
&gt; interruptions.  Once you have ONE POINT in there, it will go up as you<br/>
play<br/>
&gt; in EQ. You will see when it goes up with a message like, Your<br/>
specialization<br/>
&gt; (Conjuration) has increased! (25) or whatever you have in that skill. By<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; time you are level 30, your skill in Alteration is already going to rock,<br/>
&gt; (about 150 or so).  So, whatever skills you have, they will keep rising,<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; only thing that will stop rising, is if you specialize in more than one<br/>
&gt; skill, and one of them has gone over 50 skill. Everything will keep going<br/>
&gt; up, until you hit 50 in specialize, and the one that went over 50 first,<br/>
&gt; will keep rising. (Phew, I hope I didnt confuzzle you more)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Specialization Alteration and Alteration are TWO different skills. Both<br/>
will<br/>
&gt; keep going up =)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hope this clarifies it!<br/>

&gt; &gt;I must be missing a very basic piece of information or just suffering<br/>
from<br/>
&gt; &gt;brain fart.  Assume that I don&#39;t have a clue and am probably talking<br/>
about<br/>
&gt; &gt;something different than what YOU mean.  :)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I&#39;m a lvl 13 cleric.  Abjuration, alteration, evocation are AT LEAST at<br/>
&gt; &gt;skill lvl 60, and probably divination and conjuration are pretty high as<br/>
&gt; &gt;well.  How can that be explained?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I haven&#39;t noticed any better casting ability in any of my spells.  How<br/>
can<br/>
&gt; &gt;that be explained?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;If I HAVE specialized, how can I tell which one it is?(they went over 50<br/>
&gt; &gt;about 3 weeks ago...I don&#39;t have a clue which was first).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;If I HAVEN&#39;T specialized, how do I do it?<br/>
&gt; &gt;If I HAVEN&#39;T specialized, what happens to the other 2-4 spell classes<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; &gt;have already gone over 50?  Do they stay at 65, or do they drop back<br/>
down?<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; You can specialize in all spell types.  But, once one reaches 51 the<br/>
&gt; &gt;rest<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; will cap at 50, and the skill that reached 51 first will keep<br/>
&gt; &gt;increasing.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I am level 30 I trained as much as I could in alteration and I havent<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; touched the other specialization skills, I want to make sure my<br/>
&gt; &gt;specialize<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; in alt. is the first to hit 51<br/>
