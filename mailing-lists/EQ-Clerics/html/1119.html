&gt;Mr. J Daniels said:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;What i typically do is stun the chaster, then run behind them quickly<br/>
&gt;at<br/>
&gt;an angle, then start nuking them.   When they unstun they take some time<br/>
&gt;to turn around to look for you, when you notice this, stun them again.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I reply:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m don&#39;t know if this is good advice. For one thing, the lower level<br/>
&gt;stun lasts only two seconds. By the time you&#39;ve run around the caster,<br/>
&gt;he&#39;s not stunned anymore. For another thing, the recast time for stun is<br/>
&gt;very long. And, if the caster is smart, he won&#39;t turn around to find<br/>
&gt;you. He should already have you targeted, and he&#39;ll just hit his cast<br/>
&gt;button. He doesn&#39;t have to see you to cast a spell. And, if you&#39;re<br/>
&gt;dueling, he should realize that you won&#39;t be outside his casting range.<br/>
&gt;I think Flash of Light would yield better results. It lasts much longer<br/>
&gt;(12-18 seconds, I think), and he cannot cast while blinded. If you want<br/>
&gt;to confuse your opponent even more, cast Fear on him after you&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;blinded him. He&#39;ll never know what hit him.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This from having dueled nasty necros in Lake Rathe. They really hated it<br/>
&gt;when I Feared them, heh heh.<br/>
