<div id="ygrps-yiv-2133351297">i didn&#39;t say that was right now did i? there are jerks everywhere you go,<br/>
unavoidable....all you can do is report em....that they&#39;re disrupting<br/>
you....that isn&#39;t right for them to do that, but i do think if you&#39;re at a place<br/>
for an item and you get no exp, you shouldn&#39;t have to leave like that..that&#39;s<br/>
not fair<br/>
