I&#39;ve been reading on the EQ newsgroup that a good bit of ppl think EQ is<br/>
already starting to die.  Many are just bored of the game and are quiting or<br/>
getting ready to, others are getting tired of Verant changing everything and<br/>
some of it is for the worse.  I&#39;ve read where they are saying it&#39;s too late<br/>
to save EQ, some even say even the new addon will not save it cause it&#39;ll<br/>
still be the same game with just some new things.  And yeah it might spice<br/>
it up a bit, but for how long, I give it 3-4 months tops.  After 3-4 months<br/>
the power gamers will already have the extra lvls, everyone should have been<br/>
in all the new zones, had a chance to play the new lizardman race.  So once<br/>
that happens it&#39;s gonna be right back to where it is now.<br/>
Some are waiting for Asheron&#39;s Call and others are waiting for Middle-Earth<br/>
to be released.  Will AC or ME finish off EQ?  I guess time will tell but<br/>
since theres like 3-4 other RPGs coming out by the year 2000 I say one of<br/>
them will put an end to EQ.  And if EQ does die to fast it&#39;s no ones fault<br/>
but Verants for not listening to the paying customers, they listen to a few<br/>
but not the whole.<br/>
Even tho EQ is a very good game it can&#39;t or won&#39;t be around forever.<br/>
