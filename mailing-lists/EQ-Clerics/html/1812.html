<div id="ygrps-yiv-1702035272">I prefer the excitement of fear to running around aimlessly anyday.<br/>
<br/>
I went to fear for the first time this past weekend, and even though I died <br/>
7 times in 2 days, I had a blast. I even got boots out of the deal.(granted <br/>
efreeti boots are better, but I was wearing charred, so they are better than <br/>
what I had)  The game has gotten kind of boring as of late and the plane of <br/>
fear adds a new and exciting twist to my playtime, I can&#39;t wait to go back <br/>
this weekend again.(no wonder I am still level 47, hehe)<br/>
<br/>
I guess from my standpoint I can either, try and complete these quests which <br/>
gets me no experience at all, with no idea of what I will recieve OR I can <br/>
get XP in Lguk or SolB all week long, so I have a nice buffer for going to <br/>
fear on the weekends and potential for getting armor that I already know is <br/>
Whoop daddy.<br/>
<br/>
Just my thoughts once again,<br/>
