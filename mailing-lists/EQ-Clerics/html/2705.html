I am a new member to this list nd just wanted to say hello to everyone. I hope to learn much from this list and gain friendships from others on it. Perhaps even grouping with some in the Future. I play on the a Paladin mainly myself but am the Guildmaster of the new guild Family of Friends <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.com/onlineguild/">http://www.geocities.com/onlineguild/</a> and make it my business to know about all the different aspects of the game to help my fellow guildmates. Family of Friends is currently recruiting and we have a membership application area on our web site for potential recruits. Family of Friends resides on the Bertoxxulous server. If nothing else there are two very useful links for online gamers in general on our links page.<br/>

...And Justice For All<br/>
