<div id="ygrps-yiv-919743335">Er. I see the dwarf connection to smithing. I don&#39;t see the other two.<br/>
Why would my druid want to fletch? Or my bard for that matter?<br/>
<br/>
And I see high elves as the jewelry type. Gnomes have tinkering already.<br/>
High Elves are so proud, they would be the one to perfect such an idea.<br/>
<br/>
However, I think that this would not be something to add after the<br/>
game is already out, etc. it should have been added before, if at all.<br/>

&gt;I have to say that was really thought out and after reading it I would have to agree on the race/skill idea. I find it easier to see a dwarf smiting, an elf fletching, and a gnome making jewelry.<br/>
