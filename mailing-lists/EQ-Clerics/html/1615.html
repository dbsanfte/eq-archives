<div id="ygrps-yiv-918953924">Hey Saidinn, never apologize for having a different opinion, hon, that&#39;s<br/>
what this list is all about.  And my ego isn&#39;t that large that I take<br/>
personal offense just cause someone DOES have a different opinion.<br/>
<br/>
Now, concerning Befallen.  I wasn&#39;t kidding.  But then again, perhaps it&#39;s<br/>
changed since my days long ago.  When I was in P4, at level 9, when we got<br/>
our first undead spells, myself and 5 others (including another level 9<br/>
cleric) went to Befallen.  We stayed on the FIRST floor, of course, and<br/>
killed the skels and the rats.  We also killed Lrodd, who gave us GREAT exp<br/>
back then.  I never went anywhere my entire P4 beta days after level 9<br/>
except Befallen, and we levelled like crazy.  We moved downstairs around<br/>
level 12 or so, if I recall correctly.  But then again, this was beta.  So<br/>
much has changed even in live since it began.<br/>
<br/>
In live, we went to Befallen about mid-teens I think, and did well on the<br/>
second floor down.  The problem was there were a LOT of trains.  From the<br/>
best of my recollection, we left Befallen for Oasis because of the gosh<br/>
awful trains.  We also went to Permafrost and hunted right there in the zone<br/>
corridor, pulling from upstairs by the firepit in the room on your right.<br/>
We graduated from Perma in the Flag Room at about level 20, to my<br/>
recollection.  Back then, our group was like the ONLY ones in all of Perma<br/>
on most nites.  Occassionally another group would come in and go camp in the<br/>
Flag Room, but inevitably they&#39;d wind up training down on us.<br/>
<br/>
Again, we actually did do Befallen at level 9 and did fine, but that was an<br/>
awfully long time ago and perhaps a lot has changed.  I will defer to those<br/>
of you who have had recent experience in Befallen, and I&#39;m sure know it much<br/>
better than I now.<br/>
