that I gained 22 thru 24 in Cazic.<br/>

All you need to do is get in a good group and hold the &quot;corner&quot; in MM (this<br/>
is just around the tower, right  before you reach the tunnel to the<br/>
Graveyard.), from here the puller can clear out the tunnel and the lake/hill<br/>
spawns with the occasional garg from the tower above.  If you are in a high<br/>
level group 24-30 (avg lvl 27), then you could easily hold the GY as well.<br/>
Just clear the tunnel first, and then move to the GY.  Remember to sit just<br/>
to the *right* inside the entrance.  There is one &quot;glyphed&quot; spawn here and<br/>
two across the yard.  Then there are some behind the building, but you can<br/>
pull one to two of these at a time.  Also, the nice benefit is every 25-30<br/>
mins, the Avenging Caitiff (lv30) spawns and a good gorup of 26+ could<br/>
easily take him solo.<br/>
<br/>
In Cazic, just hold the yard with a low-to-mid 20s group and pull *lots* of<br/>
stuff from the Maze.  Not much to it, just make sure the puller knows<br/>
his/her way around the Maze.<br/>
<br/>
An Enchanter who knows how to use Mez can be invaluable in both of these<br/>
circumstances, because if your puller or the group next to you&#39;s puller<br/>
yanks too much from either the GY or Maze, then you could actually handle<br/>
them one at a time.<br/>
<br/>
One a side note, the loot in MM is poor unless you move to the GY, where as<br/>
in Cazic almost all but the lizzies that /con green to you and perhaps the<br/>
Warders, will drop an FS weapon if they wield a weapon (which can be quite<br/>
frequently).<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps some =)<br/>
