<div id="ygrps-yiv-669014000">The best quests that I&#39;ve ever done are the following quests (in order<br/>
of preference) :<br/>
<br/>
Rabid grizzly/wolf quest in Qeynos hills.  I made two levels off this<br/>
quest (although not exclusively, the majority of the xp came from this<br/>
quest for two of my levels).  The rabid grizzly and rabid wolf quest<br/>
consists of killing rabid wolves and grizzlies in Qeynos hills and<br/>
turning in the pelts to Princess Caulria in N. Qeynos in the UFO. For<br/>
wolves, you get faction, and xp, for the grizzlies you get 1 or 2 pp,<br/>
faction, experience, and the 14th level cleric scroll endure disease,<br/>
which you can sell for around 7gp for a vendor.  If you find a 13th<br/>
level cleric, you can sell it to them for more, since it sells for 7pp<br/>
from a vendor.  The amount of xp for this quest is phenomenal.  The<br/>
rabid grizzlies spawn most frequently in the valley just north of the<br/>
guard tower.  It is a noticeable amount of xp when you turn in a<br/>
grizzly pelt.  If you turn in enough wolf pelts, you will see a jump<br/>
in the xp on that, too.  If you loot a &quot;fleshy orb&quot; off a diseased<br/>
animal, just hold on to it.  The quest for this is apparently broken.<br/>
<br/>
Another good quest is the legionnaire shoulderpad quest.  Turn in 2<br/>
orc legionnaire shoulderpads (off legionnaires in Crushbone) to Nanloe<br/>
Kusback (I can&#39;t believe I remember these names) and you will get some<br/>
xp, faction, and I think some minor item.  The xp for this quest is<br/>
pretty good, but it&#39;s not quite as easy.  You may be able to buy the<br/>
shoulderpads from people too lazy to do the quest for a few gold, too.<br/>
<br/>
Another good one that I&#39;m thinking about doing is turning in orc belts<br/>
to the same guy in Kaladim.  I turned in like 20 one time (you can<br/>
turn in 4 at a time), and I jumped up from amiably to warmly, so the<br/>
faction is pretty good, and I got a piece of patchwork armor for all<br/>
of it, so I had a bunch of armor to sell afterwords.  So the loot was<br/>
pretty good.  You could probably sell the armor to newbies, too.<br/>
<br/>
Another decent quest is the pirahna fish in Rivervale.  Kill the<br/>
pirahna in the river, and turn the teeth in to Fiddy Bobeck (yet<br/>
another name) on the pier (or in the hut) and he will give you some<br/>
xp, faction, and a minor item, and some change.  This one is probably<br/>
not as good at this level, but it was awesome to me at 13th. I think<br/>
I made 12th level off this quest.  It was also the only quest (aside<br/>
from giving bandages to Joogl honeybugger in Misty) that I could do<br/>
when I first came to R&#39;vale, since I was dubious with everyone.<br/>
<br/>
Something else I&#39;ve been thinking of doing, for the money, or for the<br/>
xp and faction, is bone chips.  As a cleric with our sense undead<br/>
spell (an often overlooked ability) we can find every skeleton and<br/>
kill them.  Necromancers will sometimes pay stupid amounts of money<br/>
for a bunch of bone chips.  You could conceivable get 100 bone chips<br/>
and sell them to some necromancer for a fair bit of change.  I was<br/>
thinking of stepping into Nektulos forest, or something, and<br/>
auctioning off bone chips, and see what kind of response I could get.<br/>
Another one is fish scales.  Druids want these.  You can get a bunch<br/>
for doing the pirahna fish quest, and then sell the fish scales to a<br/>
druid somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
On the bone chips thing, there are several people that take bone<br/>
chips.  So you could turn them in at Felwithe, Kaladim, Lassun<br/>
Novashine in Qeynos, and Wolten Grafe (I think) in S. Qeynos.<br/>
<br/>
Well, these are about the best quests that I&#39;ve done repeatedly, and<br/>
have had some success with.  I&#39;m sure others might have some good<br/>
suggestions as well.<br/>

&gt;     What would you say is the best quest for the ease of doing?  I mean<br/>
&gt;obviously I won&#39;t be doing and high level quests if I am lvl 15-20 or so,<br/>
&gt;but what would you recommend for that lvl?  I am just getting tired of the<br/>
&gt;boredom of blood and guts for a bit, and wanting to try something else - <br/>
&gt;any<br/>
&gt;input on the matter is welcome.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thank You!<br/>
