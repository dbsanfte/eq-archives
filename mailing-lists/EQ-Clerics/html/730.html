<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1243708254">I can&#39;t believe how that Team Server went, even tho the had a banner up<br/>
about all day saying &quot;PLEASE don&#39;t hang out on the chat server waiting for<br/>
Tallon Zek, it will be up much,, much later tonight&quot; ppl still lived in the<br/>
chat rooms making it VERY hard to log into the game.  Heard there was over<br/>
4,000 ppl in Tallon Zek when it went live, not too long after it went up<br/>
they took it down saying they wasn&#39;t gonna put it back up till they had more<br/>
Team Servers up and that would be at least a week.<br/>
From what I read while ppl waited for it to get up that there were TONS of<br/>
ppl in the chat room, many cussing and screaming about it.  I&#39;ve also<br/>
noticed this when a few or all servers go down, ppl act like that can&#39;t wait<br/>
for a few hours to get back on.  Theres some much to real life and tons of<br/>
things to do outside but yet ppl would rather sit in the house all day<br/>
playing EQ instade of spending time with friends and loved ones but of<br/>
course they just sit there and whin every 5 seconds about &quot;When&#39;s it gonna<br/>
be back up?&quot; throw in a few cuss words and whin some more.  I may be flamed<br/>
for this letter, but I just can&#39;t see why ppl acted that way.  Yes I play EQ<br/>
like crazy, but I try to hang around friends and family as much as I can.<br/>
Guess like that post on a web site said &quot;I refuse to call EQ a real game,<br/>
it&#39;s video game crack&quot;.  If ya feel the need to flame me, go a head, but I<br/>
bet many of you agree with what I&#39;m saying here.  It&#39;s just my 2 cents (or<br/>
2cp).<br/>
