<b>Subject:</b> in response to lag issue... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1341673786">I always seem to notice exceptionally high amounts of lag right after a new patch - don&#39;t know if that is coincidence or not, just personal experience.   I have also experience 10-15 second lag spikes where my lag-o-meter does not show packet-loss.  However, my entire group also experienced these lag spikes without packet-loss meter moving also... thus I can safely guess it is not ALL of our computers acting up at once.. Others in the zone comment over /ooc about lag sometimes too - always at the same time.  <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t know what to do about it cept just hope it passes... but I don&#39;t think it is always PC related... even when meter not showing lag.  <br/>
<br/>
And in response to teen&#39;s hunting - from about level 18-22 I hunted aviak guards in lake rathe (and some undead there at night) and found it to be GREAT experience if you can find a good group :)  Gets a little crowded at peak times..but a cleric can usually find his/her way into any group ;) <br/>
<br/>
Just my thoughts ;)<br/>
