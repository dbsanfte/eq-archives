<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1501284129">I roamed around kithicor for a few hours last night, I found 4 huts, only <br/>
three of them I was able to locate over and over the 4th one with the <br/>
shadowmen for some reason I only saw once.  I tried killing all the undead <br/>
spawns, I looked on the floors, I found nothing.  I went to befallen looking <br/>
for that Babbin something or other no luck there, I went to HpH and did not <br/>
find Jovan, I went to runnyeye and there was no Sludge, I even went to OOT <br/>
but I have no clue what Island that Aviak named gull is on. Needless to say <br/>
last night was fruitless and a great waste of time.  I am now in <br/>
Butcherblock mtns and am going to have my hubby try and track Bilge in <br/>
Dagnors for me, perhaps I will find something eventually.<br/>
I have no info on what quest gives each piece, I am assuming the quests that <br/>
require 3 enc plat bars are the ones for legs and BP since that armor is <br/>
more expensive. I just hope all this wasted time is worth the armor we will <br/>
recieve.  So far all the other classes armor has not been impressive <br/>
compared to the things my guildmates already have.<br/>
As i get more details I wil post them and would love to hear from all of you <br/>
if you get them as well. Any help is appreciated.<br/>

&gt;I have been looking for Jovan the Fervent in Highpass hold. No luck yet.<br/>
&gt;Has anyone seen him?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have also been searching in Kithicor for the burned down hut. I found two<br/>
&gt;of them so far, but no icon/ingots. Near one hut were four shadowed men. I<br/>
&gt;and another cleric died trying to kill them, thinking that maybe one of<br/>
&gt;them has a part.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also, has anyone found the icon in Lake Rathe that belongs to the Reliant?<br/>
