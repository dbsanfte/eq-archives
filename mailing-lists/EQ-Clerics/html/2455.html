<div id="ygrps-yiv-1476808039">Bree, I would LOVE to join you guys on test.  What are your names? I need to<br/>
decide what kind of character to make.  That is a good combo, BTW...a bard,<br/>
cleric and monk.  Gotta figure out what class/race combo that is good can<br/>
start in Freeport, since I know I&#39;d never get a teleport or bind if I was<br/>
born in like Erudin or Kelethin.<br/>

&gt; Ya know we said the same thing....If we could move our entire guild over<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; test we would, but that is just impossible.....there are only 3 of us on<br/>
&gt; test at this time. we have me the cleric, our paladin is a monk and our<br/>
&gt; ranger is a bard.   If ya feel like making a character there you are<br/>
welcome<br/>
&gt; to hunt along with us, we all started out in freeport.  they are lvl 5 and<br/>
&gt; i&#39;m lvl  4, we are hunting right near the zone point in befallen and we<br/>
were<br/>
&gt; the only people there last night, the XP was great )<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was so happy I made patchwork pants for myself )))<br/>
&gt; Funny the things you get enjoyment out of again<br/>

&gt; &gt; Bree, I think that is wonderful.  I tried creating new characters on<br/>
other<br/>
&gt; &gt; servers but what I found was that while I didn&#39;t miss the &quot;twinking&quot; I<br/>
did<br/>
&gt; &gt; with my other babies on The Rathe, what I DID miss were my friends and<br/>
my<br/>
&gt; &gt; guild and all the things we did together.  (Can&#39;t live without green<br/>
&gt; spam!!)<br/>
&gt; &gt; So for me, going to another server isn&#39;t really an option right now.<br/>
It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; really the people that keep me coming back to EQ, not just the game.  If<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; &gt; could bundle them all up and take them to Test, I would, but<br/>
&gt; unfortunately,<br/>
&gt; &gt; it isn&#39;t gonna happen.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; My Friends and I are burned out quite a bit on Fennin Ro, way too<br/>
&gt; crowded,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and the Planes are near to impossible half the time.  Well, we decided<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; take a break and I am having a blast.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; We created characters on the test server. No Spam, No crowding, and no<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; problems so far about finding stuff to hunt. We are still very young<br/>
yet<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; though and it is fun having to work for all our stuff again.  On<br/>
Fennin<br/>
&gt; We<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; could create newbie and give them things, but on test we can&#39;t &quot;twink&quot;<br/>
&gt; so<br/>
&gt; &gt; it<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; feels just like it did when I started out on March 18th.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I made a cleric again, while my friends made classes that are<br/>
different<br/>
&gt; &gt; form<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; what their high levels on Fennin are.  My thought are I have always<br/>
&gt; liked<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; playign the cleric and well if we are gonna go anywhere on Test, you<br/>
&gt; have<br/>
&gt; &gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; have a cleric so I am happy to repeat.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Just thought I would share that with everyone, I am having a blast<br/>
once<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; again =)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Bree, 50th cleric of Fennin Ro<br/>
