<div id="ygrps-yiv-2115116892">I just can&#39;t wait to hit Lvl 19 I get some more spells and should have<br/>
enough money for them and still have some left over.  I know I can&#39;t wait to<br/>
hit Lvl 20, get my last name. I know I heard before when you hit Lvl 20 and<br/>
die you lose a bubble of exp, since they fixed it to where when ya die you<br/>
don&#39;t lose as much exp how much do you lose now on 20 and up?<br/>

&gt; &gt;Is it really true that levels 30, 35, and so on are unusually hard? Has<br/>
&gt; &gt;Verant confirmed this, or is it just a subjective impression of players?<br/>
