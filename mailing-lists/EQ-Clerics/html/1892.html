<div id="ygrps-yiv-293142203">170 wisdom?!?!  Ack...that has to be a joke for me. <br/>
With my base wisdom of 103 and me being fairly new,<br/>
the only way I will be able to get wisdom items is<br/>
from killing the mobs myself (which means I will have<br/>
to be fairly high to even get any good items)...Being<br/>
new I can&#39;t afford them items as of now; plus I hear<br/>
we clerics are very poor for a LONG while cause we<br/>
have to buy armor and spells...which so far seems to<br/>
be true.  In all honestly did I do the right thing by<br/>
putting my strength up to 100 (I read a guide that<br/>
said I should so I could wear full plate) or should I<br/>
have just pilled all my points in wisdom?<br/>

&gt; Hate to discourage you, but at higher levels, you<br/>
&gt; will melee VERY little.<br/>
&gt; Your value is healing and buffing.  And the damage<br/>
&gt; you will be able to do<br/>
&gt; against high level mobs is very minimal.  You will<br/>
&gt; be fighting mobs with<br/>
&gt; 1000s of hps at high levels, and a lot of them have<br/>
&gt; very high magic<br/>
&gt; resistance, so your spells are useless cause they<br/>
&gt; are resisted most always.<br/>
&gt; And these mobs hit HARD...some for over 100 hps<br/>
&gt; damage a pop.  You can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; survive at melee with these mobs, only the big tanks<br/>
&gt; can.  You serve one<br/>
&gt; purpose mainly, and that is healing to keep everyone<br/>
&gt; alive. Regarding<br/>
&gt; undead,  clerics used to be able to solo specs quite<br/>
&gt; easily with undead<br/>
&gt; spells, but they changed the pathing of them at the<br/>
&gt; spec cave in Feerott and<br/>
&gt; now it&#39;s dangerous cause you can&#39;t really pull them<br/>
&gt; solo anymore.  You pull<br/>
&gt; one and two or three come, and that&#39;s BAD news.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Regarding the mana issue....you will need to get<br/>
&gt; your hands on as many<br/>
&gt; wisdom enhancing items as you can, because you will<br/>
&gt; need all the mana you<br/>
&gt; can get to increase the effectiveness and efficiency<br/>
&gt; of your healing powers.<br/>
&gt; The more mana you have the longer you can keep your<br/>
&gt; group alive and the less<br/>
&gt; med time you have.  So start amassing those wisdom<br/>
&gt; items and try to get your<br/>
&gt; wisdom at least up into the 170s minimum.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sorry to disillusion you, but high levels clerics<br/>
&gt; are relegated mostly to<br/>
&gt; healing and buffing and medding.  That&#39;s what your<br/>
&gt; specialty is and at those<br/>
&gt; levels, the other healing classes can&#39;t come close<br/>
&gt; to our healing powers<br/>
&gt; with our superior and complete heal.  The good news<br/>
&gt; is that no high level<br/>
&gt; group ventures anywhere without at least one good<br/>
&gt; cleric.  YOu are a MUST<br/>
&gt; have.<br/>
