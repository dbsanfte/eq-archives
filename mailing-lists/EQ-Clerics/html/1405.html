<div id="ygrps-yiv-683107383">Yes, Anne, I agree that first and foremost we are and should be healers.<br/>
THAT is our primary role in EQ.  But as I said in my previous post,  there<br/>
are opportunities for you to get to melee even in a group, you just have to<br/>
know when NOT to melee but sit and med.  If I&quot;m FM and they just pulled a<br/>
critter, and I know they have to get down to 2 bubbs of health before I heal<br/>
with complete healing, I&#39;m not gonna just sit or stand there and watch the<br/>
battle.  The key is knowing WHEN you get to and stay at melee, WHEN you use<br/>
your DD spells, and WHEN you sit down and do your heal and med routine.  Not<br/>
a single one of my group has EVER questioned me when I get to melee or cast<br/>
a dd spell.  They trust me and know that I will not let them die because I<br/>
am not watching their hps or don&#39;t have mana to heal them or don&#39;t know WHEN<br/>
to heal them.<br/>
<br/>
 I know one cleric whose tank died in the Avatar Room in Cazic because he<br/>
(the cleric)  didn&#39;t want to &quot;waste&quot; any mana on a complete heal and waited<br/>
til the tank was at 1 bubble before he began to cast, and then his spell<br/>
fizzled.  The tank was NOT happy and would not group with him anymore.  I<br/>
also &quot;grew up&quot; so to speak with a cleric/wizard wannabe, who didn&#39;t want to<br/>
do anything but nuke with his dd spells.  In fact, he even specialized in<br/>
Evocation instead of Alteration so he could save mana on his dd spells.  I<br/>
got tired of grouping with him because I couldn&#39;t depend on him as a back-up<br/>
cleric for healing cause he never had any mana cause he was always nuking.<br/>
<br/>
A cleric who doesn&#39;t learn these &quot;Whens&quot; early on will not be effective.<br/>
It&#39;s called Learning How To Be A Cleric 101, with advanced courses as you<br/>
get older.  If a group member dies because you didn&#39;t heal him/her on time,<br/>
or didn&#39;t have mana to heal cause you were meleeing or throwing Retributions<br/>
around like they were a 50 mana cost spell, then shame on ya and you should<br/>
go play another class cause you simply don&#39;t understand what clerics are all<br/>
about and how to play them.<br/>
