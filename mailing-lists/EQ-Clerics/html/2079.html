<div id="ygrps-yiv-611684282">I think he responded to that before. Can&#39;t remember when, just search deja<br/>
news.<br/>
<br/>
Of course he will havea few extra&#39;s and what not. He is, after all, the<br/>
executive producer.  However, I doubt very much that he abuses his power,<br/>
and probably plays and dies much the same way we all do.<br/>
<br/>
As for GM&#39;s, well, thats another story, needless to say, I am less than<br/>
pleased with them and their &quot;help&quot;.  But, I&#39;d rather dwell on playing and<br/>
having fun.  If other players twink, including Brad and GM&#39;s, that doesn&#39;t<br/>
bother me, as long as it doesn&#39;t ruin my enjoyment of the game.<br/>

I can&#39;t believe the screen shot I saw on www.eqvault.com it was a pic of<br/>
Brad&#39;s character dead.  It wasn&#39;t the being dead part I couldn&#39;t believe but<br/>
what it was he had in his hand.  Now remember his character is a Ranger, pic<br/>
shows him wearing the new Ranger armor but in his hand was the SoulFire<br/>
which is a Pally only weapon.  Can we say cheating?  Now if one of us tried<br/>
that crap we&#39;d get banned from the game but he can wield a Pally only weapon<br/>
when he&#39;s a Ranger?<br/>
That shows me the ppl like Brad and GM can get away with anything in the<br/>
game.  I also read on the EQ newsgroup that last Sunday the night of the<br/>
events that the GM&#39;s were doing things that they&#39;ve told players not to do<br/>
and if they did they&#39;d get banned for it.  Heard they were camping at zone<br/>
points waiting for a player to zone over and kill them and also camping<br/>
binding points and killing someone over and over everytime he/she died and<br/>
came back at their bind point till they got ticked and pulled the plug on<br/>
their modems.  If we would do that junk we&#39;d get banned for it.<br/>
Can&#39;t wait to hear what Brad has to say about him wielding a SoulFire.<br/>
