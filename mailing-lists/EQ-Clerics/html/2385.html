<div id="ygrps-yiv-1275506377">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
Ok, beaten to death question, but I&#39;ll ask anyways.<br/>
<br/>
Where will I gain good xp at lvl 16?  I have been hanging out in the East<br/>
Karana&#39;s and North Karana&#39;s lately.  I used to hunt Befallen, but find that<br/>
I am probably too strong for the 2nd level and too weak for the 3rd.  West<br/>
commons doesn&#39;t have much, and Beholder is now a limbo zone (lots of low<br/>
blues, and hi reds).<br/>
<br/>
I am interested in xp, but am concerned I am not making enough money, so<br/>
some good xp/loot combo areas would be good.  I must admit, i haven&#39;t<br/>
explored much beyond the West commons or the Karanas.<br/>
