<div id="ygrps-yiv-68829620">I like this, I have not tried Surefall Glade, but as for Kelethin, my <br/>
Barbarian Warrior can not fit thru the door of the arrow shop. He is too <br/>
wide. I have tried ducking, and all sorts of things, just doesn&#39;t work. This <br/>
shop however, is only needed to buy the fletching kit, because all the other <br/>
stuff is used is bought at a tent vendor somewhere high in the trees. I <br/>
really wanted to do Fletching with my Troll Warrior, this was impossible so I <br/>
know how you feel. I will certainly /feedback this and sign the petition.<br/>
