<div id="ygrps-yiv-1711290930">ch is good, and it does work....you just need to play with it more and work on<br/>
the timing...it&#39;s best if you can anticipate the sitiuation and time it to<br/>
where the tank has one bar of life left....works good that way, and it&#39;s more<br/>
mana efficient...i have used it before, case in point in sol b at the bat<br/>
cave....our tank &lt;lv 50 pally&gt; pulled a few lcd&#39;s &lt;nasty bugs that bloodboil<br/>
you.....for those of you that aren&#39;t familiar with that zone&gt;, and it was<br/>
helpful to use ch instead of running oom from casting multiple sh&#39;s<br/>

&gt;      Does anyone else think Complete Heal is an almost useless spell in<br/>
&gt;      combat situations?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      This spell has one of the longest delays for a cleric so it is very<br/>
&gt;      dangerous to use in combat situations.  I think the only cleric spell<br/>
&gt;      that takes longer to cast is shield of words.  The only time I found<br/>
&gt;      this spell usefull was when I was grouped with a L50 warrior since he<br/>
&gt;      had so many hp superior heal was only healing one bub of his health.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      Last night I was in LGuk and our group was camping the froglik King.<br/>
&gt;      Now this guy hits hard and fast (140 double attacks) and I was casting<br/>
&gt;      superior heals one after another just to keep our tank (L50 sk) alive.<br/>
&gt;       There is no way I could have gotten off a complete heal during these<br/>
&gt;      fights.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      It also doesn&#39;t make much sence to me that it takes longer to<br/>
&gt;      completely heal someone than it does to ressurect them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      I think all of our healing spells need reduced casting times,  It&#39;s<br/>
&gt;      very frustrating when your tank looses their last 2 bubs of health<br/>
&gt;      when your trying to get a heal off just to see thoes blue sparkles<br/>
&gt;      around their corpse.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      Just something to think about.<br/>
