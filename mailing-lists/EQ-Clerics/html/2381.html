<div id="ygrps-yiv-1450301105">I should be making 14 later this week and would like to know what spells are<br/>
best to get first.   As you all are aware money is a definite problem at<br/>
this level.<br/>
<br/>
I had a wonderful week as far as donations to my equipment goes.  I was<br/>
given a banded tunic and a blackened neck guard plus getting rawhide gloves<br/>
from a zombie really helped.  A few lootings of ghouls has also helped my<br/>
bank account a lot.<br/>
<br/>
I am still having trouble finding groups at times but so far with only one<br/>
exception I have not lost a party member yet.  The only exception was an<br/>
ill-fated venture into Oasis when I was still 11th.  I really think that<br/>
upon making 14 I will head back to GFay.  I have nothing against Freeport<br/>
and EC but I think the humans are all jealous of us elves. (grins)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again all,<br/>
