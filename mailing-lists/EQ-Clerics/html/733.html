&gt;I can&#39;t believe how that Team Server went, even tho the had a banner up<br/>
&gt;about all day saying &quot;PLEASE don&#39;t hang out on the chat server waiting for<br/>
&gt;Tallon Zek, it will be up much,, much later tonight&quot; ppl still lived in the<br/>
&gt;chat rooms making it VERY hard to log into the game.  Heard there was over<br/>
&gt;4,000 ppl in Tallon Zek when it went live, not too long after it went up<br/>
&gt;they took it down saying they wasn&#39;t gonna put it back up till they had<br/>
 </span></blockquote>more<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Team Servers up and that would be at least a week.<br/>
&gt;From what I read while ppl waited for it to get up that there were TONS of<br/>
&gt;ppl in the chat room, many cussing and screaming about it.  I&#39;ve also<br/>
&gt;noticed this when a few or all servers go down, ppl act like that can&#39;t<br/>
 </span></blockquote>wait<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;for a few hours to get back on.  Theres some much to real life and tons of<br/>
&gt;things to do outside but yet ppl would rather sit in the house all day<br/>
&gt;playing EQ instade of spending time with friends and loved ones but of<br/>
&gt;course they just sit there and whin every 5 seconds about &quot;When&#39;s it gonna<br/>
&gt;be back up?&quot; throw in a few cuss words and whin some more.  I may be flamed<br/>
&gt;for this letter, but I just can&#39;t see why ppl acted that way.  Yes I play<br/>
 </span></blockquote>EQ<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;like crazy, but I try to hang around friends and family as much as I can.<br/>
&gt;Guess like that post on a web site said &quot;I refuse to call EQ a real game,<br/>
&gt;it&#39;s video game crack&quot;.  If ya feel the need to flame me, go a head, but I<br/>
&gt;bet many of you agree with what I&#39;m saying here.  It&#39;s just my 2 cents (or<br/>
&gt;2cp).<br/>
