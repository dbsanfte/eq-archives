<div id="ygrps-yiv-1498318764">^_^ It is very nice to see a like-minded cleric. I am<br/>
Annabelle Prettily, level 14 cleric of Tunare in<br/>
Prexus server. I see all my friends and folk around me<br/>
rising up in level WAY faster than me, because they<br/>
can blast faster, or, they can tank better than me.<br/>
<br/>
I love being lovable (that&#39;s dumb, isn&#39;t it?). But its<br/>
true! I waste my time healing folk, especially in<br/>
Crushbone, where folk think they can take on Dvinn as<br/>
a group of level 14-15 folk. I save their lives by<br/>
myself and offer to heal, cure and bandage (at my<br/>
expense). Seeing them rise so fast is pretty<br/>
upsetting, but when they give me LOTS of good armor,<br/>
and even my RTS and Screaming mace for free (you heard<br/>
me), all that healing somehow makes it worth it,<br/>
because you are so lovable.<br/>
<br/>
(Look at it this way. I can drain my mana from full to<br/>
nil just to save lives and they are &quot;very grateful,&quot;<br/>
even as they didn&#39;t ask for it (but undoubtedly, they<br/>
need it.)<br/>
<br/>
What I am saying is that I agree with you that we<br/>
should enjoy ourselves. I don&#39;t care if my spells are<br/>
slow (it is very slow). Or that I get stunned when I<br/>
cast Divine Aura on myself and get hit later on. I<br/>
also know I am very short of money (ever since they<br/>
patched up the pottery exploit). All I know is that I<br/>
am there and that I try my best to save lives (and<br/>
waste time which can be used to rise in level). That<br/>
is what being a cleric is all about. Otherwise, why be<br/>
a cleric? After all, you aren&#39;t a cleric unless you<br/>
behave like one. ^_^<br/>
<br/>
And besides, being that kind of cleric, just to<br/>
illustrate what I mean, I just did an ooc looking for<br/>
the warlord&#39;s bracer in CB, and got from Larissa, a<br/>
magic-user who remembers me so well for who I am<br/>
(which is healing folk), my screaming mace and some<br/>
very good armor. In other words, DON&#39;T think of money.<br/>
Think of being a lovable cleric, and be true to<br/>
yourself. The satisfaction of knowing people will help<br/>
you in any way they can when they are strong enough is<br/>
good enough.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;      It&#39;s so sad to see all these clerics bickering<br/>
&gt; over petty wealth.  <br/>
&gt;      When I was L15 I was wearing patchwork and<br/>
&gt; using a summoned hammer.  <br/>
&gt;      As long as I had the money to buy spells I was<br/>
&gt; happy (did have to <br/>
&gt;      borrow some from my friends).  I am L50 now and<br/>
&gt; have never had over <br/>
&gt;      2000p in the bank (only have 500p in there now)<br/>
&gt; and I still wear 2 <br/>
&gt;      pieces of bronze (gloves and cloak).  I think<br/>
&gt; the important thing is <br/>
&gt;      to have fun and do what you like (hates camping<br/>
&gt; and farming items).  <br/>
&gt;      Don&#39;t worry about what others have. If you have<br/>
&gt; good friends and good <br/>
&gt;      groups items will come in time. Besides, what&#39;s<br/>
&gt; to look forward to if <br/>
&gt;      you have everything you need by the time you<br/>
&gt; reach L20?<br/>
