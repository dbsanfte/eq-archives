<div id="ygrps-yiv-1182663670">Both spells have their uses. If you are stuck in the middle of a large zone and a large train comes down on you.. . neither divine or gate will save you. About the only chance you have is a druid&#39;s Succor or a wizard&#39;s Evacuate. And that is only if they see the train coming, or are invis or for some reason dont get targeted by the train.</div>
