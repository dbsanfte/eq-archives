<div id="ygrps-yiv-630938238">If the programming gents would get there act stright they should modify these<br/>
equations to<br/>
reflect a truer model.<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s say we are talking about the Blacksmithing skill.  Dwarves should be<br/>
naturally be better<br/>
at this skill than say a Troll or Ogre.  But if each of these characters start<br/>
off with equal INT then<br/>
they will go up along the same learning curve.  What should happen is that<br/>
severial factors should<br/>
be taken in consideration:<br/>
<br/>
Race: the natural affinity of a race to pick up or have inherent knowledge in a<br/>
skill<br/>
Int: the rate at which a skill has a chance of increases as the Int goes up.<br/>
perhaps on a log scale from 0 to 200.<br/>
Wis: the modifer for failing all together or succeding after a blunder and<br/>
recovering from an oopsie.<br/>
Dex: the nimbleness of the crafter to increase his chances to create an item<br/>
due to it&#39;s complexity or an advanced design (perhaps it<br/>
should be given more weight in Jewlery crafting and other such like skills)<br/>
Str: The stronger the character the easier it would be to fold or bend metal<br/>
and thus the crafter would not be wore out<br/>
after attempting to create a heavy piece of armor.  If the crafter attempted to<br/>
many items in a row then his success rate would drop.<br/>
Sta: as in Str the more or faster you craft the more your Sta should drop thus<br/>
modifing the possibility of success or failure.<br/>
Location: If your race is warm or amiable then you&#39;d feal at home at that<br/>
particuar forge.  But if your less liked perhaps a modifer should<br/>
be place to make it seem as if your not quite comfortable working in a place<br/>
that the locals might take a dislike to you and attempt to linch<br/>
you.<br/>
<br/>
I know they will not go this far but I think that something like this would<br/>
make it easier for a Dwarf to gain Mastery in Blacksmithing, a<br/>
Gnome to gain Mastery in Jewlery craft and a host of other Race/Skill combo&#39;s<br/>
that would be more or less &#39;realistic&#39; to the &#39;game&#39; instead of<br/>
saying well your Int is 100 and your a Troll (if possible) you&#39;d be much better<br/>
at crafting Jewlery than Gnomes with a lower Int rating.  Although<br/>
Gnomes should be born and bread to the Jewlery and Tinkering craft.<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 cents worth...<br/>

&gt; Higher INT = Higher % chance to increase in skill while practicing a trade<br/>
&gt; Higher WIS = Lower % chance of failure while practicing a trade<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In other words, higher INT will enable you to increase your skill faster<br/>
&gt; than a lower INT would. While higher WIS will help you not fail as much<br/>
&gt; while you are doing it. Being a Dark Elf and a Blacksmith I have proven<br/>
&gt; this. With both INT and WIS being high I Mastered Blacksmithing (136 skill)<br/>
&gt; with a mere 120pp. Whereas my Ranger (80 WIS, 75 INT) took well over 300pp<br/>
&gt; to master it.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t think this is true... I could be wrong.. maybe you are right, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;m pretty sure that intelligence is what helps with all skills including<br/>
&gt; &gt; trade skills.  I always thought this was kind of stupid.. i mean since<br/>
&gt; &gt; when<br/>
&gt; &gt; do good blacksmiths need to be intelligent?  hehe.. it should depend on<br/>
&gt; &gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; trade skill which stat is checked...<br/>
