&gt; 2 Extra bars of Mana????? I find that impossible, I have tested the Wisdom<br/>
&gt; item theory.  Let me say this my base Wisdom was 89, with all the items I<br/>
&gt; had that added wisdom, i was at 124.<br/>
&gt; I conducted a test...I removed all of my Wisdom granting items so my wis<br/>
was<br/>
&gt; 89. I began to cast Greater healing ( I did not fizzle) I was able to cast<br/>
&gt; it 5 times( 150 per cast).....I then tried to cast Holy Might ( 35 per<br/>
&gt; cast ) and was unbable to.....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I then put all of my WIS items back on so my wis was 124 i once again cast<br/>
&gt; greater healing 5 times ( no fizzle 150 per cast)....with the BS MANA I<br/>
had<br/>
&gt; left over i was able to cast ONE holy might (35 MANA) and one flash of<br/>
light<br/>
&gt; (12 MANA). SO, with this test i have decided that instead of using ALL my<br/>
&gt; item slots to try to bring up wisdom, which is a complete waste of time, I<br/>
&gt; would get some really good wis Items( like plus 6 wis ring, Adementite<br/>
&gt; epolets, ETC) and i would replace some items with DEX, yes DEX increasings<br/>
&gt; items.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This wisdom mana thing is extemely confusing to me to begin with :)<br/>
I used the mana calculator that some said was close not exactly but within a<br/>
10-20 mana of give or take. I put in your stats and got this:<br/>
<br/>
Your Current Level Is: 36<br/>
<br/>
The Base Wisdom For Your Char Is: 89<br/>
<br/>
Your Base Mana At This Level Is: 712<br/>
<br/>
Your Modified Wisdom Is Now: 124<br/>
<br/>
Your Modified Mana At This Level Is: 964<br/>
<br/>
Extra Mana As A Result Of Modifiers Is: 252<br/>
<br/>
For what its worth :)  lol </span></blockquote></div>
