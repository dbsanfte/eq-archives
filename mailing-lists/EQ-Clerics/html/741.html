<div id="ygrps-yiv-1472120145">My top character is level 16 (well 15 now, but that is a long story..<br/>
he WAS 16) and made that in under 6 game days. A good deal of that was spent<br/>
dying and wandering. If I concentrate on him he should hit 20 in 10 game days<br/>
easily and I would hardly consider myself experienced. I would bet a twinked,<br/>
power leveled character can hit 20 in 5 days or less. I have a friend who hit<br/>
20 in 6 days with his Barbarian Warrior.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Talking about days played, this reminds me of the discussion we had<br/>
&gt; on here a while back about twinking a character to level 20.  Someone<br/>
&gt; mentioned that it could be done in 10 game days.  Others believed<br/>
&gt; that that would be nearly impossible.<br/>
&gt;   I have a 12th level cleric (just made 12th last night) and I have<br/>
&gt; been playing for 5 game days.  Now I spend a great deal of time doing<br/>
&gt; &quot;crap&quot; in terms of experience - raising skills, swimming, raising<br/>
&gt; sense-heading, fishing, exploring, doing quests, etc.  Basically just<br/>
&gt; having fun with the game.  I came across a Druid that was around 9th<br/>
&gt; or 10th when I first grouped with her.  I think at the time I was<br/>
&gt; probably 10th level.  I added her to my friends list.  When I saw her<br/>
&gt; again, she was 16th - I removed her from my friends list knowing I<br/>
&gt; would probably never get to group with her again as she had outleveled<br/>
&gt; me.  Last time I saw her was week before last and she was 19th.<br/>
&gt;   So, I guess my point is, if you&#39;re very aggressive and fight a lot<br/>
&gt; of monsters steadily, you can really level rapidly.  This would<br/>
&gt; obviously have to be someone that&#39;s a very experienced player cause<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s hard to otherwise know where to go and what to do.  Relative<br/>
&gt; newcomers, like myself, are more intrigued just by exploring and<br/>
&gt; doing quests than by just hardcore leveling.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Azor, you have hit the nail on the head!  Now I to admit I am hooked like a<br/>
&gt; &gt;Mo Fo., but I do have time limits on it (imposed by me!) As it is I have<br/>
&gt; &gt;lived many many days on that damn game... and I will most likly live many<br/>
&gt; &gt;more...<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt;I can&#39;t believe how that Team Server went, even tho the had a banner up<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;about all day saying &quot;PLEASE don&#39;t hang out on the chat server waiting for<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;Tallon Zek, it will be up much,, much later tonight&quot; ppl still lived in <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;chat rooms making it VERY hard to log into the game.  Heard there was over<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;4,000 ppl in Tallon Zek when it went live, not too long after it went up<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;they took it down saying they wasn&#39;t gonna put it back up till they had<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;more<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;Team Servers up and that would be at least a week.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;From what I read while ppl waited for it to get up that there were TONS of<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;ppl in the chat room, many cussing and screaming about it.  I&#39;ve also<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;noticed this when a few or all servers go down, ppl act like that can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;wait<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;for a few hours to get back on.  Theres some much to real life and tons of<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;things to do outside but yet ppl would rather sit in the house all day<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;playing EQ instade of spending time with friends and loved ones but of<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;course they just sit there and whin every 5 seconds about &quot;When&#39;s it gonna<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;be back up?&quot; throw in a few cuss words and whin some more.  I may be <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;flamed<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;for this letter, but I just can&#39;t see why ppl acted that way.  Yes I play<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;EQ<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;like crazy, but I try to hang around friends and family as much as I can.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;Guess like that post on a web site said &quot;I refuse to call EQ a real game,<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;it&#39;s video game crack&quot;.  If ya feel the need to flame me, go a head, but I<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;bet many of you agree with what I&#39;m saying here.  It&#39;s just my 2 cents (or<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;2cp).<br/>
