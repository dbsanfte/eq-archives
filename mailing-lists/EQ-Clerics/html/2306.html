&gt;level 19, I use a Langseaux of the Wolves in big groups, because I want<br/>
&gt;to be sure that I&#39;m doing max damage. I can consistently hit for 29-32<br/>
&gt;each time I hit, and with crits up to 56, and a low charisma, those MOBS<br/>
&gt;really hate me. Which is exactly what I want them to do :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>&lt;nods&gt; problem is, at the higher levels, those 2h slashers dont deal out<br/>
damage quick enough to keep the mobs pissed at you :) But youre right, any<br/>
tank that cant keep the healer(s) alive needs some serious work :)<br/>
