Higher WIS = Lower % chance of failure while practicing a trade<br/>
<br/>
In other words, higher INT will enable you to increase your skill faster<br/>
than a lower INT would. While higher WIS will help you not fail as much<br/>
while you are doing it. Being a Dark Elf and a Blacksmith I have proven<br/>
this. With both INT and WIS being high I Mastered Blacksmithing (136 skill)<br/>
with a mere 120pp. Whereas my Ranger (80 WIS, 75 INT) took well over 300pp<br/>
to master it.<br/>

&gt; I don&#39;t think this is true... I could be wrong.. maybe you are right, but<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m pretty sure that intelligence is what helps with all skills including<br/>
&gt; trade skills.  I always thought this was kind of stupid.. i mean since<br/>
&gt; when<br/>
&gt; do good blacksmiths need to be intelligent?  hehe.. it should depend on<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; trade skill which stat is checked...<br/>
