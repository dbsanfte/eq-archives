<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1930541611">Just an FYI for any dark elf clerics :) <br/>
<br/>
I was told last night that the pages needed for the testament of vanear quest were also no drop/trade items.  Since one of the pages is obtained in Qeynos, it was be extremely hard for any dark elf to get that item.  <br/>
<br/>
If any of you dark elf clerics out there have found a way to obtain this item, please let me know.<br/>
