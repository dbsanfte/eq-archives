<b>Subject:</b> What do you think of begging (not the skill) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1555429406">Hi all.<br/>
<br/>
I gave seen this debate before in other places.<br/>
<br/>
What do you all think of begging as a method of acquiring<br/>
cash/armour/weapons?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mean the skill of begging, but I mean approaching other PC&#39;s and<br/>
asking them to spare a bit?<br/>
<br/>
Now, I am for it.  I beleive that RP&#39;ing worlds parallel the real world, and<br/>
inthe real world, there are those who are poor, and need to beg for thier<br/>
sustenance.  At the lower levels, I gained most of my armour and my money<br/>
from begging.  Now I do it in a RP&#39;ing context, and not as &#39;Hey, got any<br/>
free armour I can have?&#39;.  I think that this is a valid strategy.<br/>
<br/>
As well, now that I am entering the teens, I don&#39;t need to beg as often.<br/>
But I do barter with players, and when doing so, I subtly make them beleive<br/>
that I am a poor cleric (which I really am). In doing so, I have made some<br/>
great deals, and am able to get some good bargains on armour.  Last nite,<br/>
for instance, I bought a bloodforge hammer for 15 pp, and a FS staff.  From<br/>
what I could see, they usually went for around 30 pp.  In my opionion, its<br/>
no different than trading in ussed car and dressing down and making the<br/>
saleperson beleive you are poorer than you really are.<br/>
<br/>
Any other thoughts?</div>
