<div id="ygrps-yiv-1945911759">Actually, it is somewhat by level.  Holy Might starts out at 39 dmg (I<br/>
think) and goes up one point per level.  It is now at 44 dmg for me at level<br/>
44.  Every one of our damage spells gains a point or two with each level and<br/>
some cap off at a certain point, some don&#39;t.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; The maximum amount of dmg done by a spell is pre-determined by Verant, and<br/>
&gt; has nothing at all to do with the individual player&#39;s level or stats, such<br/>
&gt; as wisdom.   I&#39;m at level 50, and Holy Might still hits for 60 pts max and<br/>
&gt; Force for 90 and Sound of Force for 220.  Now, some spells and bard songs<br/>
&gt; are designed to go up one- two pts of dmg as you level after getting the<br/>
&gt; original spell/song, but they do not go up ad infinitum.  For instance, a<br/>
&gt; bard&#39;s song Brusco&#39;s Boastful Bellow does 1 - 2 pts more damage each time<br/>
&gt; you level after initially getting it. Same with some of the<br/>
&gt; druids dd spells<br/>
&gt; as well.  But none of these spells damage done is dependent on what your<br/>
&gt; wisdom is, although your chance for success or failure  in casting does<br/>
&gt; depend on your skill in channeling and some say dexterity as well. </span></blockquote></div>
