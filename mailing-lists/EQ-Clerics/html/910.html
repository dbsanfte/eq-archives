Woh woh.. hehe I didn&#39;t want us to start attacking IRL habits.  I see what <br/>
he&#39;s saying about not giving people buffs just because they don&#39;t want them.  <br/>
But I also see where RPing your character is to give him all of the buffs.  <br/>
Perhaps your character is the ultimate giver.  Always helping even when <br/>
people don&#39;t want it.  Do you remember your mother helping you clean your <br/>
room even though you didn&#39;t want it?  Well, maybe some characters are like <br/>
that.  Just a thought.<br/>

&lt;&lt;  No immature is when you give a player all your buffs just becuase they<br/>
 wanted to RP and didn&#39;t want your help and yes it does ruin the Rping<br/>
 enviroment. And we are not going ot turn this into some kind of  blown out<br/>
 argument just becuase you think that my life is this game. &gt;&gt;</div>
