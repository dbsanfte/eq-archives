<div id="ygrps-yiv-1607463145">Ummm hers the thing about corpse time&gt;&gt; Your corpse if over lvl 6 then<br/>
your body will stay in the game for 7real days(Out of game meaning not<br/>
playing the game it counts even when you on the character select screen  but<br/>
not in the server selection screen s go to tech. chat they will actually go<br/>
to ytour server and help you from the chat room:))and 24 hours in game (real<br/>
time this also means being at the character select screen and being on with<br/>
your other characters also counts as this time) However what you have on<br/>
your corpse and how much the stuff is worth will raise this time, so if you<br/>
ahve like 500pp on you and a full set of plate and maybe a crapload of other<br/>
kick ass stuff your decay time willl be drastically changed meaning it could<br/>
take days(real time in the game ) or weeks (out of game) so basically it all<br/>
depends on your valubales your carring but base is 24 in game and 7 days out<br/>
of game..<br/>

&gt;ok....upon my most recent excursion, i ventured away from the<br/>
&gt;lizard-filled ruins of cazic thule, and set out for the undead dungeon<br/>
&gt;lower guk....well, when i got there, &lt;mind you i had not been there but<br/>
&gt;once before&gt; i was following some group members, and went into a room<br/>
&gt;with vampire bats..&lt;they&#39;re not undead btw&gt; and was promptly<br/>
&gt;attacked.....the group was helping me, but things took a turn for the<br/>
&gt;worse and we had to run for the zone....i unfortunately was killed<br/>
&gt;swimming in the water back to the zone. well, when i went to go find my<br/>
&gt;corpse, it wasn&#39;t there, and doing the /corpse command revealed nothing<br/>
&gt;except for &quot;it can&#39;t be summoned from here&quot; well, i guess it got stuck<br/>
&gt;in hte wall or something, so i peititioned them to move it so i could<br/>
&gt;loot it..haven&#39;t got a response to it yet, but am gonna keep<br/>
&gt;trying.....what my question is &lt;i know you&#39;re saying about time!!&gt; is<br/>
&gt;this...does anyone know how long of logged in time will a lv 37 &lt;this is<br/>
&gt;freakin why i didn&#39;t get to make 38 :P&gt; will stay around? i need them to<br/>
&gt;move it before time&#39;s up, and i was wondeirng how long it would remain<br/>
&gt;there.....i think so far i&#39;ve been logged on about 7 and a half hours<br/>
&gt;since it happened...i&#39;ve heard it&#39;ll be there for 24 hours of logged in<br/>
&gt;time...is this right?<br/>
