<div id="ygrps-yiv-441633369">Hello, all.<br/>
<br/>
I have been using the Hammer of Wrath since level 9.  I have looked all over the web to find the stats of the later hammers I can summon, but have been unable to find them.  Could somebody let me know the stats for the other hammers?  Thanks.  I know they aren&#39;t the best in &quot;ratio&quot;, but they will always be my favorite because they are a gift from Rodcet Nife.<br/>
<br/>
Also, while lurking I have noticed a lot of complaints that there aren&#39;t any cleric only weapons in the game.  Heh.  Who else gets to use the Hammer of Wrath? :)<br/>
