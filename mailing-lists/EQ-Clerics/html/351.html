<div id="ygrps-yiv-419643256">I think allowing us to move from server to server would be a bad idea.  I<br/>
think it&#39;d cause to many problems, just my luck they&#39;d be some bug caused by<br/>
moving like that and my character would get deleted for good or messed up<br/>
bad.  But I take it back about hurrying up and giving us that new land mass,<br/>
I don&#39;t want them to rush it and have tons of bugs in it.  But the idea<br/>
about locking out the newbies to certin servers that is a good idea.  I&#39;d<br/>
say Rathe and Xeynos and Finnin Ro should be the main three that they get<br/>
locked out of for a while.  Not trying to be mean to new players but those<br/>
servers are getting too many players on them and at times you have TONS of<br/>
trouble finding a place to hunt and it can also cause TONS of lag in that<br/>
area if there too many players camped there.<br/>

&gt; Thats true until it settles down.  The other problem is that the server is<br/>
&gt; overcrowded the begin with.  The main oringinal servers are always over<br/>

&gt; &gt; Then I think Verant needs to really do something about all this.  I mean<br/>
&gt; &gt; if<br/>
&gt; &gt; places like Unrest and Cazic are gonna be so over crowded that it cause<br/>
