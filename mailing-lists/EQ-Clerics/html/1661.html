<b>Subject:</b> RE: going linkdead <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1863480350">This was implemented in the patch that was installed yesterday. One of our<br/>
party members went linkdead and it said &quot;&lt;name&gt; has gone linkdead.&quot; in<br/>
bright yellow. It was our Wizard, so we knew to get the heck out!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I read on the EQ &quot;official&quot; website that on the test server - If a party<br/>
&gt; member goes link-dead, the remaining members will be notified.   Yayayaya<br/>
&gt; - that is one change I would NOT mind Verant making!<br/>
