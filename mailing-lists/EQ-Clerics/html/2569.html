<div id="ygrps-yiv-684480184">At 19th in Sol A I would fight young and cinder goblins. They&#39;d be red,<br/>
but with a full group, and especially with an enchanter it would be<br/>
managable. I&#39;m not sure if it would work without an enchanter at that level,<br/>
because you&#39;d want to deal with one at a time. I&#39;d also do it down next to<br/>
the zone to Sol B. That is from lavastorm entrance, down the windy stairs,<br/>
either through the hole in the wall or around by the pendulum axe, coming<br/>
out above the big doors turn right and straight down the hallway, which goes<br/>
down a ramp turning right to a small room at the bottom.<br/>
    There&#39;s no spawn anywhere past the hall at the top of that ramp, and the<br/>
zone to Sol B is right next to it. If you get more than you can manage zone<br/>
out. You can try and root one on your way out and if you&#39;re lucky and come<br/>
back right away you may be able to catch that single one either still rooted<br/>
or behind the crowd going back. That shouldn&#39;t be the case all the time, but<br/>
it helps reduce the down time if there is a bad pull.<br/>
    With an enchanter to mesmerize extras, and a group that will /assist the<br/>
tank you should be okay. If you don&#39;t have an enchanter you can try and<br/>
break the spawn with your lull/soothe/calm/pacify line. If you have a shaman<br/>
in the group get him to buff your charisma before using lull. The shaman can<br/>
also do some of the enchanter stuff by using malise to reduce magic<br/>
resistance for your casters, and speeding your tank and slowing the mob.<br/>
These things help effectively reduce the mob to your level. Of course the<br/>
shaman can&#39;t mesmerize though.</div>
