<div id="ygrps-yiv-346836985">If I had chosen a Dwarf, I would have dumped ALL the points I could into<br/>
WIS. Their base STR and STA are exceptional compared to the other races to<br/>
choose from. Alas, I chose a Dark Elf, so I had to spend several points<br/>
getting my STR and STA up to a comfortable level. You should be fine though,<br/>
103 WIS is a good base. You will find plenty of items, and have good quests<br/>
to get great WIS items.<br/>

&gt; 170 wisdom?!?!  Ack...that has to be a joke for me. <br/>
&gt; With my base wisdom of 103 and me being fairly new,<br/>
&gt; the only way I will be able to get wisdom items is<br/>
&gt; from killing the mobs myself (which means I will have<br/>
&gt; to be fairly high to even get any good items)...Being<br/>
&gt; new I can&#39;t afford them items as of now; plus I hear<br/>
&gt; we clerics are very poor for a LONG while cause we<br/>
&gt; have to buy armor and spells...which so far seems to<br/>
&gt; be true.  In all honestly did I do the right thing by<br/>
&gt; putting my strength up to 100 (I read a guide that<br/>
&gt; said I should so I could wear full plate) or should I<br/>
&gt; have just pilled all my points in wisdom?<br/>
