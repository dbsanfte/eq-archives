<div id="ygrps-yiv-493586665">You&#39;ve obviously never dealt with hags or just didn&#39;t think before you<br/>
spoke.  Hags *spells* are the thing that will kill you.  Seeing as they<br/>
stop to cast on you very frequently during chase you can put enough<br/>
distance between you and them while divine is on before you get to the<br/>
zone.  So by the time ya make it to the zone they are out of range for<br/>
spells and divine has saved you again.  All you need is about 10 secs to<br/>
make it away from a hag.  They will just stand there are try to cast on<br/>
you.</div>
