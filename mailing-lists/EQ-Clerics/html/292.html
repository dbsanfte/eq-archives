<div id="ygrps-yiv-1850094556">Thats not 100% true, I&#39;ve known people to still get lightstones off Wisp.  I<br/>
just bought a Greater Lightstone off someone yesterday.  About a month ago<br/>
in West Karana someone was saying that there was still lightstones, greater,<br/>
nosave and they even said something about a lesser lightstone.  Not sure if<br/>
there really is a Lesser one or not.  But from what I&#39;ve heard they are<br/>
still good lightstone on the game to loot off wisp.<br/>
