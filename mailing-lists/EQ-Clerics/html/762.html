&gt; I completely agree with you. Verant needs to fix the coding on this, to make <br/>
&gt; sure that the group gets the kill...or...whoever attacks the MOB first gets <br/>
&gt; the kill. Its very very disheartening to camp something for hours and hours <br/>
&gt; with your group, just to have a wizard or other high level spell casting <br/>
&gt; class come along and take it with one shot.<br/>
<br/>

This would prevent someone from helping someone who has gotten in <br/>
over their head by taking the critter off their back as they run.<br/>
<br/>
It would also make it EASIER to killsteal by someone. Just run in<br/>
and get the first hit in andit doesn&#39;t matter who has been camping there.<br/>
