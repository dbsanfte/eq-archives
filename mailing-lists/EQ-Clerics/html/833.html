<div id="ygrps-yiv-1038859398">I agree with you completely....I have not seen a&quot;cap&quot; so to speak for my<br/>
cleric, However many of my meleeist friends, including my In-game Husband<br/>
who is a ranger&quot;, are losing interest VERY fast in this game their skills<br/>
have capped at 200 and they have nothing at all to look forward to.  they<br/>
are geting bored, people need to see progress, improvement in their<br/>
characters.<br/>
<br/>
If they do not raise the skill cap up and the levels in which we can attain,<br/>
there are going to be a lot of people leaving for other games.  My in game<br/>
husband says he has nothing to look forward to anymore, except a few more HP<br/>
per level thats it, he will never be a better fighter than he is already and<br/>
for me it&#39;s sad to hear that.<br/>

&gt;Um, not raising the level cap would be a really, really bad idea. High<br/>

&gt;Part of the fun, and the addictive factor, of RPG&#39;s is the illusion of<br/>
&gt;growth: every day you get stronger, more powerful, able to to places you<br/>
&gt;were not able to before -- cf. the Plane of Fear discussion -- and<br/>
&gt;successfully kill critters that you would have run in terror from a few<br/>
&gt;levels before.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If characters stop growing, a lot of the fun of the game is gone. I hit the<br/>
&gt;level cap in Balder&#39;s Gate about midway through Chapter 4...and lost<br/>
&gt;interest in the game a few days later. Haven&#39;t finished it, probably won&#39;t<br/>
&gt;ever.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am not sure why Verant would NOT want to raise the level cap.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I imagine there might be ways to fake it. For example, besides items that<br/>
&gt;raise stats, there might be items that raised one&#39;s Offensive or Defensive<br/>
&gt;or weapons capabilities beyond their caps at level 50, making you<br/>
&gt;effectively a level 55 or 60 or higher character, even though you are still<br/>
&gt;nominally level 50. Hm. That might be interesting.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Still, I think Verant has to do something to allow players to increase<br/>

&gt;exercise those capabilities, if they want to retain their player base.<br/>

&gt;post<br/>
&gt;&gt;from a guy that went to Gen-Con and he said it wouldn&#39;t be out till<br/>
&gt;&gt;3-16-2000.<br/>
&gt;&gt;Speaking of the pak many ppl keep saying they are adding more lvls for us,<br/>
&gt;&gt;Brad himself has stated before they didn&#39;t know if we would be getting<br/>
 </span></blockquote>more<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;lvls.  He said they saw no real reason to give us more lvls.  A bit later<br/>
&gt;he<br/>
&gt;&gt;said something about if they did it might be from Lvl 50-60.  I think 50<br/>
 </span></blockquote>is<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;&gt;cool for now but if they do give us more I think it should be at least 75.<br/>
&gt;&gt;As I was writing this I read more on EQVault they guy said Verant is<br/>
&gt;&gt;thinking of raising the lvl cap to 55 or so.  Gee a whole 5 lvls!!<br/>
