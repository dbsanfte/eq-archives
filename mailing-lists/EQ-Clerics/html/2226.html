<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-236890173">It&#39;s been my experience that the majority of all mob attacks on a<br/>
cleric (due to them healing) can be avoided.  Just dont be too quick with<br/>
throwing a heal.  I never heal anyone in my party if they  have taken<br/>
lessthan 2 bubs of damage. Depending on what is attacking them I typically<br/>
wait till they have taken 3 bubs of damage.        This doesn&#39;t apply to<br/>
wizards,  I always heal them almost as soon as they start to drop.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If the puller is running back to the group and will need a heal as soon as<br/>
they are in range, I always tell my party to get ready to clear me,<br/>
healing someone right as the party starts to engage a mob is almost always<br/>
guaranteed to get you attacked.   <br/>
<br/>
I always said clerics had the best taunt in the game....:)<br/>

&gt; &gt; can&#39;t or doesn&#39;t do it in time.  I play with a good friend so<br/>
&gt; &gt; when I asked him about this<br/>
&gt; &gt; he says that he is taunting the mob constantly, but it won&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; leave me.  So, don&#39;t just assume<br/>
&gt; &gt; the warrior isn&#39;t doing HIS job.  It seems the Mobs will stick<br/>
&gt; &gt; with a healer until he&#39;s dead<br/>
&gt; &gt; sometimes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Aye.  For those of you who has never play a tank, FYI taunt isn&#39;t worth a<br/>
&gt; crap around low 20s and below.  What I am telling you guys is to always have<br/>
&gt; another escape/survival plan if the tanks are unable to pull the mobs off.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you play with a ranger, ask the ranger to snare or root (snare is better<br/>
&gt; though) the mob.  Those spells works as good as taunt...if not better.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; BTW once u are at 2 bubbles of health...it is close to impossible for anyone<br/>
&gt; to pull those mobs off.  If you ever get that low on health, and the mob is<br/>
&gt; still at full health or there are still more then one mob standing...just<br/>
&gt; cast divine aura and run towards the zone.<br/>
