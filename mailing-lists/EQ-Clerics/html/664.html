<div id="ygrps-yiv-1883856522">Hail folks.<br/>
Today I saw the emails about the quest that gives that very nice (+9wis) shield but all of the emails I read (12  of &#39;em) had very little info about the quest. Can someone please write a little more about it? like who  to talk to, where it ends and such, thanks in advance.<br/>
