<div id="ygrps-yiv-1982624161">On the subject of 9th level spells<br/>
Center is really good, and you will use this until 18th level.<br/>
Hammer of Wrath is decent, but you should go to Qeynos and get an SSOL<br/>
instead.<br/>
I&#39;m 16th and still haven&#39;t bought invigor.<br/>
Word of pain is only good as a parlor trick for killing a bunch of<br/>
rats standing around you.  In fact, I used it today in the Qeynos<br/>
sewers and killed 4 rats with one spell.  Pretty neat.  With tough<br/>
mobs it&#39;s basically like shouting, &quot;hey, everyone, attack me!&quot;<br/>
Summon food is handy.<br/>
Root is handy.<br/>
I think fear is over-rated, but I have used it a few times.<br/>
I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever used endure fire, endure poison is only<br/>
slightly more useful.<br/>
<br/>
Not that these spells aren&#39;t useful, but I suspect you could be just<br/>
as useful of a cleric by just buying root, summon food, center, sense<br/>
the dead is sometimes handy (and it&#39;s cheap), and sometimes you might<br/>
be asked to &#39;soothe&#39; something, so get that one too.  And, like I<br/>
said, depending on your weapon, hammer of wrath - which I used till<br/>
around 12th.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t quite remember where I went at 9th.  I seem to recall it being<br/>
a rather difficult level, though.  10th was hard, too.  You might try<br/>
Steamfont, the skeletons there are pretty tough.  If you get in a<br/>
group try the chessboard.  At your level it is still too risky to<br/>
solo pawns.  But you can root/ward undead skeletons.  Ooh, I know, the<br/>
pirahna in the Rivervale river.  Perfect place.  Not only would the<br/>
pirahna give you xp, but it&#39;s a great quest (give the teeth to Fiddy<br/>
Bobeck), and gives you good loot.  Also, beyond the wall in Misty<br/>
Thicket.  Try goblin warriors, and giant scarabs.  With center/holy<br/>
armor, you could probably solo a yellow giant scarab.  They really are<br/>
a pretty pathetic creature.<br/>
<br/>
  Yea, now that I think about it, Misty Thicket is where you want to<br/>
be.  This place can take you all the way (technically) to 14th, maybe<br/>
even 15th (but it would be real slow at that point).<br/>
  Another good place might be the Qeynos hills fighting gnolls, or the<br/>
Qeynos sewers fighting gelatinous cubes and frogloks.  Sounds like you<br/>
are in Faydwar though by the Orc comment.<br/>
<br/>
hope this helps.<br/>

&gt;Hello all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I barely got lvl 9 last night (Woo Hoo!), and can&#39;t figure out any good<br/>
&gt;spots to hunt.  It seems that everywhere I&#39;ve been has a lot of greens and<br/>
&gt;yellows, or some blues hanging around with a bunch of yellows/reds.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Any advice on where a young cleric can get some experience.  I&#39;m tired of<br/>
&gt;running for the zone when those Legionnaires come to the aide of their cent<br/>
&gt;counterparts.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m sure you all remember getting 9th, but I don&#39;t know if you felt the<br/>
&gt;disappointment, that I did, in the spells that we got.  I was all psyched <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;get root and maybe soothe, but what else is there that works well?  I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;still using furor as my DD spell.  Seems pretty weak compared to a 9th <br/>
&gt;level<br/>
&gt;Druid&#39;s &quot;ignite&quot; spell that took a cent out in 2 casts.  I can hit em 4 or <br/>
&gt;5<br/>
&gt;times with furor and still have to duke it out for a while.  Any<br/>
&gt;encouragement out there?<br/>
