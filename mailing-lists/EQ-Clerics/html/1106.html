<br/>
The following thoughts are experience from a PvP server.<br/>
<br/>
I would add that Flash of Light is great for offense and defense.<br/>
If the opponent is not used to being blinded it will freak them out and if<br/>
they do not have there spells memmed it disables them. It uses small amount<br/>
of manna and is relatively quick to cast. Generally I cast it and if not<br/>
rooted I ran round the back of them and start hitting them. From the back no<br/>
melee weapon effects you.  I always use a 1 handed weapon (fast=28) on the<br/>
principal that I have more chance to interrupt other players casts. I seldom<br/>
use stun though after that post I will reevaluate it. ( I just hate to waste<br/>
manna for no damage!) On the stun part. An experienced PvP Caster need not<br/>
look for you all he has to do is cast, unless of course he is being pounding<br/>
from behind which puts them off.<br/>
<br/>
I would also suggest not to be hesitant to use divine aura quickly.<br/>
Especially if rooted. One hope is that you can be aided by other players.<br/>
Otherwise the general wiz technique is root and nuke. If they don&#39;t notice<br/>
(or do not understand) they may waste a lot of manna.<br/>
<br/>
However I have in general lost to casters, mainly because the Pk&#39;s on Rallos<br/>
tend to wait till your health is at the last bubble while fighting a MOB<br/>
then kill you with one/two unexpected blasts. Which Sucks.<br/>
<br/>
That happened to me at the chessboard once. I had a good laugh though<br/>
because I managed to cast flash of light on an undead bishop just before I<br/>
died. The PK&#39;r must have had a little shock to see the undead bishop and his<br/>
summoned pet bearing down on him. At least I would think so since his body<br/>
was next to mine when I came to claim my stuff. *grin*<br/>

Clerics can easily beat any pure type caster class of their same level.<br/>
All you have  to do is cast stun/ and the best offensive spell at your<br/>
level.<br/>
<br/>
What i typically do is stun the chaster, then run behind them quickly at<br/>
an angle, then start nuking them.   When they unstun they take some time<br/>
to turn around to look for you, when you notice this, stun them again.<br/>
<br/>
It really works well.  I havent dueled too much but i&#39;m 9 and 1 vs casters<br/>
in duels.<br/>

&gt; I have a few thoughts on PvP and clerics. I play a cleric on Vallon Zek<br/>
and <br/>
&gt; occationally battle other players. In my experience, clerics are not good <br/>
&gt; offensively, but rather good defensively, especially grouped.<br/>
&gt; Once a necromancer cast dots on me (engulfing darkness and boil blood I <br/>
&gt; believe), plus fear. I dropped HPs rapidly, but managed to cast a couple<br/>
of <br/>
&gt; heals on myself, and then the DOTs wore off.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Can clerics generally survive a fight versus casters by healing<br/>
themselves? <br/>
&gt; If I cast 4 greater heals on myself I can heal for 1200+ damage. Although<br/>
I <br/>
&gt; am not sure, I doubt a wizard will have the mana to deliver 2000 damage at<br/>
<br/>
&gt; my level (24), and some of his damage might be resisted. Assuming I have <br/>
&gt; full armour, I should be able to root and melee the caster to death.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Other useful spells are blindness and stun. I use the low level variants<br/>
of <br/>
&gt; stun since they take less mana. Divine aura is useful since the attacker <br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t always observe that I am invulnerable, especially casters, since <br/>
&gt; they don&#39;t get any damage information (=&quot;blabla hit by non melee for 140 <br/>
&gt; damage&quot; etc).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Buying an egg shaped pumice is also a good investment, although it is<br/>
quite <br/>
&gt; expensive. It is a magic item sold by some vendors (in Neriak, the one<br/>
near <br/>
&gt; the bank) and has 5 charges of &quot;pillage enchantment&quot;, that will cancel <br/>
&gt; several effects like charm/DOTs (and buffs) at the same time.<br/>
