&gt; Vin, you can do the entrance to Sob B no problem...<br/>

never seen anyone in there less than that level.. mostly 40+.. I&#39;ve<br/>
recently moved over there and though I failed to find a group yesterday<br/>
(I was trying at a time when it was very full and laggy) I expect I<br/>
should be okay today..  Xp in Unrest was proving a little too hard to<br/>
get since the ghost room can only support one group and there always<br/>
seemed to be either too many or too little lvl 30+&#39;s to group with.. <br/>
Lets hope Sol B is a little more accessible today..<br/>
