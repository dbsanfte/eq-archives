<div id="ygrps-yiv-813912413">Oh come on, go for the female gnome cleric.  You will most likely be <br/>
     the only one on your server.  I have only ever seen one gnome cleric.<br/>
     Also, why not choose a Halfling cleric? we rock :)  I only know one <br/>
     other L50 Halfling cleric on my server where humans,high elves and <br/>
     de&#39;s are a dime a dozen.<br/>
     <br/>
     I wouldn&#39;t worry about what you look like in plate to much as most of <br/>
     the time you will either look like a misfit or a druid.  I came so <br/>
     close to making a macro shouting &quot;I am NOT a druid&quot;.  I was getting so <br/>
     many sow requests it was driving me nuts.  I personally feel that <br/>
     steel plate is a waste of money for a cleric and it takes a very very <br/>
     long time to get that purple stuff (as it&#39;s commonly referred to).<br/>
