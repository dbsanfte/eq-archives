<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1153816717">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
In your opinion, what has been the server that has given you the best role<br/>
playing experience?  I am currently on the Rathe Server, and find it (now it<br/>
could be my area/zone) to be a little dry in terms of roleplaying<br/>
characters.<br/>
<br/>
What are all of your opinions?</div>
