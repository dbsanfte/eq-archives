<div id="ygrps-yiv-587865545">My personal favorite thing to do if a wizard is trying to killsteal is to<br/>
let them hit it once hard (which if it&#39;s enough to get 51% of the damage<br/>
done to the creature, I guarantee it&#39;ll be enough), then I run towards the<br/>
wiz and semi-train the beast on them.  This especially works with LockJaw,<br/>
since he&#39;ll consistently hit for 30s-50s all the times I&#39;ve seen him, and a<br/>
wizard won&#39;t live long through that sort of barrage.  The other benefit<br/>
being that if they die, all that damage they did was all for naught, so<br/>
simply finish off the beast, get the xp and the loot, and laugh at them once<br/>
they come back in.  =)  It doesn&#39;t always work, sometimes the wizard is<br/>
powerful enough to withstand it, or has leatherskin, or something like that<br/>
and still gets the kill, but at least they&#39;re hurting from it and might<br/>
think a little the next time.  Just my $.0002pp.  :)<br/>

&gt; Even if they made it so a groups combined damage was taken into<br/>
&gt; consideration solo wizards would still get the kill credit.  They can do<br/>
&gt; so much damage per spell that there really isn&#39;t enough HP left on a mob<br/>
&gt; for  a group total to be more.<br/>
&gt;  Verants choice of whoever does the most damage vs. group damage, makes<br/>
&gt; no difference.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The whole killstealing thing is due to a very, very bad design decision<br/>
by<br/>
&gt; &gt; Verant. I.e., that a group&#39;s total damage is ignored in assigning credit<br/>
for<br/>
&gt; &gt; kills, and if an outside player has done more damage than any *single*<br/>
group<br/>
&gt; &gt; member, then he gets credit for the kill. Brad posted a note about this<br/>
