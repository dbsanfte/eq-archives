<div id="ygrps-yiv-2018371429">Just some random thoughts as I wait to get out of<br/>
work.<br/>
<br/>
To get the full clerical armor set from the temple of<br/>
Ro, you need something like 10 enchanted platinum bars<br/>
and items from monsters. These are suppossed to be a<br/>
mid levels cleric quests(level 20-40). platinum bars<br/>
are more then 100pp each, and I cringe to think the<br/>
amount of money a random high level enchater will<br/>
charge me for enchating the platinum. Ok, the quests<br/>
were meant to be tough, but lets compare them to say,<br/>
necromancer armor. They have to get items from mid<br/>
20&#39;s monsters, and create shadowsilk with tailoring<br/>
skill where shadowsilk is trivial at 30 for all of<br/>
their armor. The harvester quest item requires a fire<br/>
opal, which they can buy for 55pp. Now why are they<br/>
making quests for clerics, who are the poorest class<br/>
(buy armor and spells) such high amount of money for<br/>
their armor?<br/>
<br/>
*sigh* I have not even bothered thinking about doing<br/>
the quests as the enchanted platinum bars are very<br/>
much out of my reach for the next many levels. If I<br/>
save up all my money and get all the items, I will be<br/>
able to get at most two pieces, kind of disappointing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh well, back to running around in bits of bronze and<br/>
caster stuff.<br/>
