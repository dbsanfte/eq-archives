<div id="ygrps-yiv-717417895">Originally blindness caused your screen to flicker continually. You<br/>
could do NOTHING or at least I could not. <br/>
<br/>
	The new patch I think just causes the &quot;visible&quot; area to go black. Not<br/>
the rest of the stuff... <br/>
<br/>
	As for the buff problem for cancel magic. If it really does cancel<br/>
from the top down, then simply pad it. Cast a &quot;fake&quot; buff (something you don&#39;t<br/>
want or need to keep on like say fireshield or something) and then put all<br/>
your other buffs below that. Then when the fireshield wears off keep your<br/>
other buffs refreshed. They will stay where they are and the new &quot;bad&quot; spell<br/>
will go in the top spot.<br/>

&gt; &quot;Flash of light is an awesome little tool, if it works. Its<br/>
&gt; fast and uses little mana. He also has cure blindness and he would be<br/>
&gt; stupid<br/>
&gt; to not have it memorized. If he is a lower level it can last a<br/>
&gt; reasonable<br/>
&gt; time.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was told by a friend who hunted in Runnyeye that Verant issued a patch<br/>
&gt; that caused your ENTIRE screen to go black when you get blinded. I will<br/>
&gt; have to try this on myself. Because if this is the case, then even<br/>
&gt; though the troll shaman has me targeted, he will be unable to use his<br/>
&gt; mouse to click his memorized spells. He WILL be able to cast spells IF<br/>
&gt; he has hotkeyed them AND remembers which keyboard number goes to which<br/>
&gt; spell....but I know for a fact that this shaman hasn&#39;t done that.<br/>
&gt; So......It looks like I&#39;m going to be a Flash of Light caster on Sunday<br/>
&gt; night at the PVP grounds in Neriak. Hmm....maybe I should first cast<br/>
&gt; Invulnerability on myself to get him to waste his mana, then blast him<br/>
&gt; with Flash of Light, and keep blasting him with it while I melee the<br/>
&gt; crap out of him.....means that I&#39;m going to have to memorize extinguish<br/>
&gt; fatigue as well, cause it&#39;s gonna take me FOREVER to melee him to death.<br/>
&gt; And I should probably memorize Cancel magic in case he decides to root<br/>
&gt; me....But someone said earlier that Cancel magic starts at the top of<br/>
&gt; the stack. Why? That&#39;s where all MY buffs are! If I remember correctly<br/>
&gt; (from Highpass and the gnoll shamans who cast root), I think Cancel<br/>
&gt; magic starts at the bottom of the stack. Otherwise, it would be a<br/>
&gt; worthless friggin spell, eh?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for the suggestions so far...keep them coming...and let me know<br/>
&gt; what you think of the Flash of Light strategy :)<br/>
