<div id="ygrps-yiv-82039748">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never killed Mitty the Kitty but have been there to case the joint<br/>
and seen her killed by three different soloists or groups.  Her official<br/>
lvl is under 20 but being a named cat you know she is tougher.  I&#39;ve<br/>
seen her solo&#39;d by a 50 shaman and a 34 wizard, and a group of a 29 and<br/>
19 druids.  I&#39;m told she has 800 hp&#39;s and the lvl 12 priestesses about<br/>
230 hp&#39;s.  Never saw anyone there except the 19 druid that was getting<br/>
xp.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is the priestesses will heal Mitty, and there are about half<br/>
a dozen of them.  I was told the priestesses were a few worries for the<br/>
lvl 19 druid.  Medding invis is a bonus we don&#39;t have.<br/>
<br/>
Basically to camp Mitty, you need enough mustard to blast and bash for<br/>
2000 pts every 18 1/2 minutes.  Don&#39;t ask me how to prime the pump cause<br/>
I was never there to see how difficult killing the whole lot is.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard rumours these NPC casters have unlimited mana.  Didn&#39;t<br/>
believe it untill i was at unrest and my 27 cleric and a 29 druid took<br/>
on a lvl 29 hag of some desription at the end of a train returning to<br/>
the station.  Lucky for us it was kill stolen cause both of us were<br/>
under two bubbles of health by the time it was killed.  The hag also had<br/>
time to put several spells into the other two PC&#39;s that were<br/>
helping/kill stealing.  It this situation I&#39;d say helping. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Another curiosity I&#39;d like to mention.  I have a 27 Cleric on the Rathe<br/>
at the request of personal friends that complain of a lack of high lvl<br/>
Clerics on that server.  I&#39;ve just started up a character on the<br/>
Tribunal and have noticed a lack of high lvl clerics there as well when<br/>
i do searches.  Is it just me or is just damn difficult to lvl up a<br/>
cleric?  Its tough to solo a cleric and good groups are hard to luck<br/>
upon.  Joining groups in unrest was getting me killed enough to break<br/>
even on xp.<br/>
<br/>
Another peeve is asking warriors and monks if they want to team up and<br/>
being denied, followed by a request for a heal.  I lvl up faster soloing<br/>
but can i get a heal while you are here?  I&#39;m going to attack this<br/>
Dervish thug with one bar of health and put you in a situation of<br/>
healing a stranger or watching that stranger die.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m going to be one surly dwarf cleric by the time I hit lvl<br/>
49.  If i know you and like you, happy to help.  Strangers, hope you<br/>
made a good name with other clerics along the way, cause I&#39;m here to<br/>
play the game.  If you want true charity workers, go to the Salvation<br/>
Army. :-)<br/>

&gt; My understanding is that she is around level 30.  I hear her spells hit for<br/>
&gt; between 60 - 80 dmg and she has about 700 hps.  She spawns every 18 and 1/2<br/>
&gt; minutes, I am also told.  If this is incorrect, someone please correct me.<br/>
