<div id="ygrps-yiv-1959673404">Well,<br/>
   First, at your level your revive spell gives NO experience back,  you<br/>
dont get your first ressurection spell which gives exp back, till level<br/>
39.      As for the HP loss and the negative buff on you, thats<br/>
interesting, I&#39;ll have to check and see what happens.   (As long as you<br/>
get XP back still, I kinda think the HP loss and temporary sickness is<br/>
kinda realistic, for rezing someone.)  If anything its just a temporary<br/>
annoyance.....nothing major.<br/>

&gt; I just did a revive on myself yesterday and was damn surprised to the result. Usually<br/>
&gt; all it does is teleport to corpse and return a little xp. But at that time it did a whole<br/>
&gt; lot more. And all of them were negative side effects. After resurrection i had all my<br/>
&gt; mana drained, had only 50% of HP, had some kind of weakness effect on me and<br/>
&gt; all this without any addition to the positive effects (xp gain). I feel this is a terribly<br/>
&gt; wrong move by Verant. And besides they did not mention a thing about it in the<br/>
&gt; patch message. Why the heck did they do something like this? Do they want to<br/>
&gt; ruin the cleric now that it is perfectly balanced? That would be awfully stupid.<br/>
