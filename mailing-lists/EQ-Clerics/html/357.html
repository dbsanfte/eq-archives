<div id="ygrps-yiv-245592081">I disagree on the moving anyone on lvl 10 and below to another server.  How<br/>
would you feel if you were Lvl 10 or below and you had friends say on 12 and<br/>
up, next thing you know you&#39;re on another server and they are still on that<br/>
one and you can&#39;t group or talk to them anymore?  I think only 500<br/>
per-server is too little, I&#39;d say 1,000 to 1,500 is cool I&#39;d take 1,950 to<br/>
2,000 if they&#39;d put in more places for us to go and hunt and give us more<br/>
cool items to loot.  I heard the Glowing Crook you get off Lock Jaw can be a<br/>
pain cause 20+ Wizards kill the steal and get the Crook.  Thats something<br/>
else they need to fix, I mean how is it right for me as a Cleric to be<br/>
beating the crap outta something and a powerful Wizard comes along and with<br/>
one blast kills it and gets the exp and the loot?  Are Wizards too powerful,<br/>
seems like it too me, I know a Wizard that on Lvl 12 was doing over 100 dmg<br/>
to things with one cast of a magic spell.  I on Lvl 16 get&#39;s lucky to do 76<br/>
dmg to somethings with one cast of a spell.<br/>

&gt; zone? Of COURSE there will be 70-100 people in the zone! Move the Ruby<br/>
&gt; around...put some in Rathe Mountains, make a level 25+ zone on Erudin so<br/>
&gt; Ruby can drop there....but not all in one zone. Look at the Journeyman<br/>
&gt; boots. ONE NPC in the entire game has it, its a no drop item, meaning you<br/>
&gt; have to loot it yourself. Why cant this npc drop it everytime to stop<br/>
&gt; overcamping and people from Kill stealing? No, that would make way too<br/>
 </span></blockquote>much<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Over camping and lagging CAN end if some of the ideas that so many have<br/>
