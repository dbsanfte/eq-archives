<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;From: &quot;Jeff Portwine&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:jdport@...">jdport@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As you all saw from my rant the other day, I&#39;m one of those insane clerics<br/>
 </span></blockquote>who realizes that the armor isn&#39;t that great, but still wants &gt;to do these<br/>
awful quests to get it &lt;grins&gt;.    I think I have at least one piece of just<br/>
about every armor quest now except for the &gt;bracers, which ironically is the<br/>
piece that I want the most.  I have a few questions about the quests that I<br/>
thought maybe some of &gt;you who have done the quests could help me with.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Bracers:  Does anybody know exactly where Zahal and Regis spawn?  I know<br/>
 </span></blockquote>that Zahal spawns somewhere in NK and Regis in &gt;WK... I heard that Zahal<br/>
spawns somewhere in the NE corner of NK.. but that is as much as I know<br/>
about either one of them.   &gt;How long do I have after killing Zahal to get<br/>
to where Regis spawns?  Will he have been spawned and killed by another<br/>
player &gt;already by the time i run from Zahal to Regis?<br/>
<br/>
Zahal spawns somewhere near the wood bridge in NK but immediately starts to<br/>
wandering the zone.  After killing Zahal the zombie Regis will spawn along<br/>
the north wall in between the water and the named treant.  Regis will not<br/>
move until attacked, just be careful of the werewolf hunter NPCs, they will<br/>
attack and kill Regis if they get close enough, they run an east/west line<br/>
just south of the north zone wall.  I don&#39;t believe Zahal has any<br/>
placeholders<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Chestplate:  Does Bilge have a single spawn point, or can he spawn<br/>
 </span></blockquote>anywhere?  I&#39;ve asked around about this but nobody seems to &gt;know where<br/>
Bilge spawns or who his placeholders are.<br/>
<br/>
When I got Bilge he spawned near the entrance to Dagnors from BB and swam<br/>
towards the goblin camp where he met his demise.  Thats a;; I can say.....<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Gloves:  Where in befallen does Babbinsbort spawn?  I know somewhere on the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>3rd level... but i&#39;m really not very familiar with &gt;befallen... not nearly<br/>
as familiar as I should be as a cleric =)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen the loc posted on several sites.......included Rayne&#39;s<br/>
board.........<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Also... about this icon under the water... I tried to get that last night,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>but unfortunately it wasn&#39;t there when I got to it.   Is there an &gt;easy way<br/>
to get to this spot?  The way I did it was to have somebody cast enduring<br/>
breath on me and then ran to the first hole in &gt;the ice i could find...<br/>
alas, that hole is quite a ways away and I don&#39;t think I&#39;d have made it<br/>
without EB.  Is there a closer hole that I &gt;was missing?<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll need enduring breath, you have to jump in the water on the left part<br/>
of the &#39;Y&#39; section of the river and swim south and back north to the right<br/>
section of the &#39;Y&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;As for all of the other quests, are there any tricks for making the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Galacial Bear, Gull Skytallon, or any of the other rare spawns &gt;come out?<br/>
Or is it just sit there for days on end praying that the next 8 hour cycle<br/>
will be the one when they spawn?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard the Glacial Bear has wandering ice bone skeletons as placeholders<br/>
(not the static ones) but have not done this quest.  I do not believe that<br/>
Gull has a placeholder but that Maugrim can be made to spawn quicker by<br/>
killing other necros on the island.<br/>
