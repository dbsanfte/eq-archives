<div id="ygrps-yiv-257683100">I agree with you that CPU isn&#39;t everything, but it does become the final<br/>
limiting factor for EQ after all else falls away.<br/>
<br/>
    I am still suprised at your #2 and #3 though - I&#39;ve tested EQ with both<br/>
cards and never had frame rate problems with either - and from your<br/>
description of &#39;pauses&#39; (as opposed to general slowness) it almost sounds<br/>
like disk swapping, is it possible that 64mb isn&#39;t enough ram for EQ<br/>
(considering your #1 config has 128mb) and is causing a lot more Virtual<br/>
memory activity?<br/>
<br/>
    In any case of your #3, I would highly recommend that folk *not* play EQ<br/>
with a Voodoo I or Voodoo II based accelerator because of the poor bus<br/>
interface that the early Voodoo line fell prey to (and the Voodoo III has<br/>
somewhat has inherited - Doh! please don&#39;t smack me 3DFX =) ) EQ is<br/>
definantly a texture heavy game and AGP makes all the difference in the<br/>
world for moving them around.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;Although you may be correct, you are a bit misleading.  CPU isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;everything.  I play Everquest on three different machines:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1. Celeron 300, Voodoo3 3500, 128MBRam<br/>
&gt;2. PII 350, Riva TNT, 64MBRam<br/>
&gt;3. Celeron 433, Voodoo2, 64MBRam<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Number 1 has the smoothest video of all of them, with the fewest pauses.<br/>
&gt;The 128MBRam also makes zoning a bit faster than the other two machines.<br/>
&gt;(Before the Voodoo3, I had an ATI AllinWonderPro (4M) that would pause<br/>
&gt;reliably every time a new set of textures were needed.)  Unless you match<br/>
&gt;memory, video and cpu speed, you won&#39;t have optimal performance.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;That being said, if I over clock #1 above to 450MHZ, then EQ does run<br/>
&gt;better.<br/>

&gt;Actually a little known fact about EQ is that it&#39;s almost entirely CPU<br/>
&gt;limited.<br/>
