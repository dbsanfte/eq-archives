Ok, do you play on veeshan?  If not lemme give you a quick history of unrest<br/>
:)<br/>
I first started playing this game in may, I didn&#39;t find a character I liked<br/>
until around amonth later.  I settled on a Gnome Warrior and played him till<br/>
lvl 24.  Now, during my stint in unrest (lvl 16-23) It was a VERY popular<br/>
place.  There could be upwards of 115 ppl in there at the same time.<br/>
Basically, &#39;safety in numbers&#39;.  Now that I&#39;m high enough lvl to actually go<br/>
there with my cleric, there&#39;s avg. about 30 ppl there.  Take 15 or so off<br/>
becaus they are lvl 30+, and your left with around  15 ppl for a group.. Now,<br/>
14 of these are first time players, and there&#39;s me left.  Now I have found a<br/>
group before, but left immediatly because I couldn&#39;t talk any sense into<br/>
them.  They insisted on pulling from certain places in the first floor, and<br/>
pulling from the second floor.  BIG MISTAKE<br/>
Pulling from the second floor (when no one is camping it) usually brings the<br/>
ENTIRE second floor to you.  (then what do they do? run right towards the<br/>
group, instant death almost) Pulling from certain areas in the first floor,<br/>
pulls the ENTIRE floor.<br/>
So I left because I didn&#39;t want to continuasly die.<br/>
Oh and I try to stay away from soloing non dead because the delay on smite is<br/>
so long.<br/>
Where are these Undead Reavers you speak of in East Karana?<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m 18th level, but I certainly hope I don&#39;t have this problem when I<br/>
&gt; get to level 20!  I would think that groups would still want 20th<br/>
&gt; level clerics if for no other reason than for Daring and Spirit Armor!<br/>
&gt; Admittedly, I&#39;m a little jealous that Druids at 19th get the same heal<br/>
&gt; spell I do, so why get a cleric, when the Druid serves the same<br/>
&gt; purpose at this level.  I kinda bothered me.<br/>
&gt;   I suspect you can solo with some success (or get some cleric friends<br/>
&gt; together) the undead reavers in East Karana, or you might still can<br/>
&gt; get xp (albeit probably not much) from scarecrows in WK.  I would<br/>
&gt; still think Unrest would want clerics, or start your own group!  You<br/>
&gt; might try Mistmoore, although 20 may be too low for that place, I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t know.  You could probably solo crag spiders and gorge hounds<br/>
&gt; in EK, too.  You might try to get a group at the pickclaws in HH, too.<br/>
&gt; Hmm, beyond that, I don&#39;t know.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Good luck!<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Hi all.  I&#39;d like to give props out to you all, and everyone on the<br/>
&gt; &gt;eq-cleric forum at stratic. (if any of you do both of these)<br/>
&gt; &gt;So far that forum and this list is easily, from what i&#39;ve seen, most of<br/>
&gt; &gt;the maturist ppl in this game..mind you, there are always exceptions.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Well anyways, I&#39;ve run into real life head on, and basically my playing<br/>
&gt; &gt;time has become very short, to almost non existant.. :(<br/>
&gt; &gt;I&#39;m currently lvl 20, and am finding myself getting somewhat<br/>
&gt; &gt;frustrated.  I have a few wizards in the group of ppl that I play with<br/>
&gt; &gt;(all higher lvl though) and I am able to occasinoally go to multiple<br/>
&gt; &gt;zones.  I&#39;m having an extremely tough time finding a group.  Now, I know<br/>
&gt; &gt;my name has not been tarnished, unless it&#39;s been by an adolescent, so I<br/>
&gt; &gt;rule that case out.  My friends say this is a tough time for a cleric to<br/>
&gt; &gt;find groups because our heal spell isn&#39;t that effective (which I<br/>
&gt; &gt;agree).  But, being the poor melee&#39;ers we are, I can&#39;t solo (one<br/>
&gt; &gt;exception..If I can do 2 things..1) find undead available to kill 2)<br/>
&gt; &gt;root holds).<br/>
&gt; &gt;I&#39;ve been to unrest, lake rathe, oasis, bird citie (south karana? or<br/>
&gt; &gt;north..can&#39;t remember), perma, and basically I never get tells back from<br/>
&gt; &gt;anyone.  Now one thing I&#39;ve noticed is that the number of clerics has<br/>
&gt; &gt;risen, and groups will often tell me, &#39;sorry, we already have a<br/>
&gt; &gt;cleric&#39;.  And I&#39;m not sure why they wouldn&#39;t want another one! Oh well,<br/>
&gt; &gt;I throw that away assuming they are playing their first character.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Anyways, I was basically just looking for a place to hunt and that I can<br/>
&gt; &gt;easily get a group.  It sucks when you might have 2 hours to play a<br/>
&gt; &gt;week, and you spend 1 hour advertising for a group...<br/>
&gt; &gt;Or is it possibly I&#39;m going to have to do my best to find a place to<br/>
&gt; &gt;solo undead for 4 levels?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Any and all help would be appreciated.<br/>
&gt; &gt;TIA<br/>
