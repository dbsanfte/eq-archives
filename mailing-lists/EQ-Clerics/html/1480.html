<div id="ygrps-yiv-229691209">Though that is logical it does not make any practical sense. If it worked<br/>
that way, sometime in my career as a Cleric. I would have had a heal<br/>
resisted. That has never happened to me in months of play.<br/>

According to everything I have ever read, Magic Resistance has always had<br/>
the chance of working for OR against you. If you have enough stat-increasing<br/>
items to raise your MR into the 90 percentile, then most spells (even Heals)<br/>
have a chance of being resisted. I believe it&#39;s in the manual too, could be<br/>
wrong, but I will double-check tonight.<br/>

&gt;     Has anyone been able to confirm or deny that healing spells now have a<br/>
&gt; chance of being resisted by other players on the test server?<br/>
