<div id="ygrps-yiv-406476179"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;What do you mean, in an intelligent manner?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Have ye ever considered starting a trade business of some kind?  Perhaps<br/>
running errands for other players?  Smithing, Jewelcrafting, things that<br/>
you recycle your money into that will yeild more than what ye started with?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  The most profitable thing at 15th level is either bronze weapons or<br/>
&gt;greater lighstones.  Both of which are semi-rare.  These are the only<br/>
&gt;things that I can think of.  You can kill the occasional gem dropping mob in <br/>
&gt;Faydwar, Pixies, or Drakes, or those winged-women things in<br/>
&gt;Steamfont, but even those aren&#39;t that valuable or very common.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The above thigns you mention, are a great start to building up some cash to<br/>
start a trade skill that will allow you to reap more benefits in the future.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  The only other thing I can think of is that you are doing quests and<br/>
&gt;then auctioning the items.  Like doing the Shining Star of Light quest<br/>
&gt;over and over again and then selling it for 50 pp a pop or something.<br/>
&gt;I suppose it might fetch that much on a production server, certainly<br/>
&gt;not on Test.  Seems like the demand would run low, and most newbies<br/>
&gt;simply can&#39;t afford that much.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This too is a good idea.  And you have hit on a very important topic..<br/>
suppy and demand.  If everyone has something that you can offer, perhaps<br/>
it&#39;s time to look for other items that people are in need off?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Beyond that, I can not thing of any normal means to acquire 4000 plat<br/>
&gt;by the time you reach 15th level.  It is inconceivable.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Inconceivable does not mean impossible.  There are many ways for ye to make<br/>
a large amount of cash.  Albeit, most of the time at the expense of gaining<br/>
experience and going up levels, I will admit.  But sometimes, when ye find<br/>
a good source of income, it&#39;s a good idea, in the earlier levels, to forgo<br/>
gaining experience, and making some plats instead.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  You talk like it is common knowledge that everyone should have 4000<br/>
&gt;plat by the time they are 15th level.  That&#39;s just absurd.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Absolutely not.  I only made my statements, because it sounded like you<br/>
were accusing someone of exploiting in the game, to make a good sized<br/>
amount of plat.  I was refuting your claim that it could not be done<br/>
without exploiting.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  A friend of mine stayed up all night once and killed wisps on wisp<br/>
&gt;isle.  He sold all the greater lightstones to the gypsy camp and ended<br/>
&gt;up making around 800 plat.  It took him nearly a day to do that.  He<br/>
&gt;was 20th level.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I started killing wisps when I was around level 9, it was and still is, a<br/>
great way to make some initial money.  But honestly, it won&#39;t feed ya for a<br/>
long time, you need to find another way to make more cash.  Either by<br/>
starting up a trade skill of some kind, offering a service that no other<br/>
players have thought of, or in other ways, making yerself useful to other<br/>
players.<br/>
<br/>
I guess the point i&#39;m trying to make, is there are many other ways to make<br/>
plat in the game, other than just hunting.  But initially, you&#39;ll have to<br/>
do a lot of hunting to discover those ways.  ;)<br/>
