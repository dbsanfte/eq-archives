<div id="ygrps-yiv-1827142482">Cancel Magic starts at the top of the stack. Druids have complained a<br/>
LOT about how useless this makes the spell.<br/>
<br/>
You might want to practice putting a short-lived buff on yourself first<br/>
(Firefist for Druids. Or perhaps Shield of Thistles, which is combat<br/>
length) so it wears off. then see which spell is removed by Cancel Magic<br/>
when you use it.<br/>

&gt; &quot;Flash of light is an awesome little tool, if it works. Its<br/>
&gt; fast and uses little mana. He also has cure blindness and he would be<br/>
&gt; stupid<br/>
&gt; to not have it memorized. If he is a lower level it can last a<br/>
&gt; reasonable<br/>
&gt; time.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was told by a friend who hunted in Runnyeye that Verant issued a patch<br/>
&gt; that caused your ENTIRE screen to go black when you get blinded. I will<br/>
&gt; have to try this on myself. Because if this is the case, then even<br/>
&gt; though the troll shaman has me targeted, he will be unable to use his<br/>
&gt; mouse to click his memorized spells. He WILL be able to cast spells IF<br/>
&gt; he has hotkeyed them AND remembers which keyboard number goes to which<br/>
&gt; spell....but I know for a fact that this shaman hasn&#39;t done that.<br/>
&gt; So......It looks like I&#39;m going to be a Flash of Light caster on Sunday<br/>
&gt; night at the PVP grounds in Neriak. Hmm....maybe I should first cast<br/>
&gt; Invulnerability on myself to get him to waste his mana, then blast him<br/>
&gt; with Flash of Light, and keep blasting him with it while I melee the<br/>
&gt; crap out of him.....means that I&#39;m going to have to memorize extinguish<br/>
&gt; fatigue as well, cause it&#39;s gonna take me FOREVER to melee him to death.<br/>
&gt; And I should probably memorize Cancel magic in case he decides to root<br/>
&gt; me....But someone said earlier that Cancel magic starts at the top of<br/>
&gt; the stack. Why? That&#39;s where all MY buffs are! If I remember correctly<br/>
&gt; (from Highpass and the gnoll shamans who cast root), I think Cancel<br/>
&gt; magic starts at the bottom of the stack. Otherwise, it would be a<br/>
&gt; worthless friggin spell, eh?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for the suggestions so far...keep them coming...and let me know<br/>
&gt; what you think of the Flash of Light strategy :)<br/>
