&lt;&lt; Etc, etc..the list goes on. I expected these things to happen, but I have <br/>
 never met a single perons in EQ that actually tried  to adhere to their <br/>
 character.  The world of EQ is full of greed and who can be the next &#39; <br/>
 coolest high level character&#39;.  &gt;&gt;<br/>

There are some, but like I said few and far between.... keep searching and <br/>
you will find them. I have met all the types you talk about, and yes have <br/>
slipped from charachter a lot myself - iots HARD work when you are in the <br/>
minority. However, all my charachters have a strong declared path, and they <br/>
pretty much keep to it... as I get better at it the pretty much will <br/>
disappear.... non-roleplayers [most] bring flashes of reality... haha I get <br/>
enough of that in rl ;-).<br/>
