<b>Subject:</b> EQ - worse rpg ever? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1367030315">Count me out of Everquest. I have played this RPG since it first hit the <br/>
shelves of my local game store- and I must say; I am quite disappointed to <br/>
where it has ended up as. <br/>
 It had great promise, but frankly-  it&#39;s the worse fantasy game i have ever <br/>
played. As a matter of fact;  THERE IS NO &#39;FANTASY&#39; about it!!!! I had a <br/>
number of fantastic dreams when I first heard of Everquest- a land where one <br/>
can travel across lands and dimensions, a true world where you can follow a <br/>
trail through a path of forest for hours to reach the fabled land of elves- <br/>
or journey through a dark dungeon where rumors of a powerful sorceror made <br/>
his home there-, creating monstrosities and twisting creatures and beings to <br/>
its desire, with people cowering in fear to its name- or journey to an inn <br/>
within a city, where you meat cut-throats, warriors, magicians of promised <br/>
power to journey with you to a quest assigned to you- but these dreams have <br/>
been shattered! Never has any of this happened in the world of Norrath to me. <br/>
 Playing as a priestess of Tunare, I had great ambitions of journeying and <br/>
making a mark upon my name as an adventurerer and holy advisor. But I am lost <br/>
in a world of technicality- noone cares about adventuring or imagination in <br/>
the world of Norrath. I am lost in a world of levels, fancy weapons, and <br/>
items. Noone in the world of EQ cares about being in a diffrent world- its <br/>
only a contest on who can reach the highest level, get the most fanciful <br/>
weapon, or the the most striking robe. <br/>
 Try to prove me wrong- I doubt it! Through my months of journeying in the <br/>
world of Norrath, I HAVE ONLY MET ONE PERSON  that truly tried to roleplay <br/>
(and i have met many people through different servers) - and even he turned <br/>
into the &#39;world of mundane unimagination&#39; after a month. Am I wrong? Read <br/>
this mailing list- what do people talk about on this list? This is what they <br/>
talk about- <br/>
   &quot; How can I find the (some generic magic item that everyone else talks <br/>
about) &quot; <br/>
   What level is --- (some monster that someone wants to kill to get an item, <br/>
and camp out til he/she gets it)<br/>
    Where can I hunt to get to level (a number) -<br/>
     Etc.... etc....&quot;<br/>
 Not that any of this is wrong, people are asking for help- but this is all <br/>
anyone talks about in EQ! ! ! I once belonged to an RPG community and game  <br/>
where mailing lists were designed to be &#39;in character&#39; , where Mordok the <br/>
warrior may  share his thoughts about the Golden Dragons Inn, or the Dark <br/>
Elves gathering a war party to rid the land of people who oppose them, or <br/>
magicians giving hints to the knowledge of their power through a quest for <br/>
them (And i thought this was one of the most exciting RPGs until they started <br/>
charging money per hour to play) - does any of this happen EQ, wheteher <br/>
through mailing lists or in the game itself?  To believe that EQ made a <br/>
measly attempt to have people roleplay by coloring their names a different <br/>
color!? All i get from those people  are male characters asking for my phone <br/>
number or address (considering I play a female character), or  --- <br/>
  &quot;How much damage does that spell do?<br/>
   When will  (the monster) spawn again? <br/>
    WHat number is your (skill) at? <br/>
   Whats the stats of your (item) ? <br/>
  I can&#39;t wait til reach level (#) etc...etc...&quot; <br/>
    I am not making bones about it- yes, it is great to reach the next level <br/>
so you can cast a different spell, etc.. to enliven your adventure-  but what <br/>
does everyone else look for after that? THIS is what - <br/>
    &quot; I can&#39;t wait to reach the next level!!! &quot; <br/>
  So what happens when you reach level 100? What are you going to do then, <br/>
keep fighting monsters til you reach level 101?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
  There is no fiction about EQ. Its not a RPG, its a video game with no <br/>
imagination. Its a game with promised excitement, yet it will rot (and it is <br/>
already starting to) from the inside, and will not last long at all. I am <br/>
quitting my characters, and looking forward to this other game that i saw on <br/>
the web ( a complicated multi-player text RPG, but not a traditional MUD). I <br/>
am sure mostl of the people reading this doesn&#39;t give a damn about anything <br/>
of what I said -  trash me all you want- I dont care. <br/>
