<div id="ygrps-yiv-1973906714">Maybe it&#39;s just me, or does anyone else notice this...<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re in a group, or a group is forming, and someone mentions going<br/>
into Beholder and killing eyes to get Polished Bone Bracelets.  And<br/>
so a group forms, and there is a spell-caster, and you and some tanks<br/>
or a bard or rogue, or whatever.  And a PBB is found, and the whole<br/>
group immediately says, &quot;Give it to the wizard.&quot;  Even though it is a<br/>
+3 wis +3 int item that can benefit both of you equally.  And unless<br/>
you actually speak up and say something, they would just give it to<br/>
the wizard without a second thought on the matter.<br/>
  Or you&#39;re a weakling high elf cleric and something like a purity<br/>
belt or studded leather collar comes up, and the fighter gets it, even<br/>
though it&#39;s everything you can do to keep from being encumbered and<br/>
that +1 strength would mean the difference between being encumbered or<br/>
not, and the fighter has a 120 strength already, and is never<br/>
encumbered.  Why is that?<br/>
  I find that a lot of my RL friends seem to be willing to go and get<br/>
items for each other, the poor cleric is always left in the dirt.  It<br/>
seems like all my friends have something that was given to them by<br/>
someone else, but all my stuff I had to earn.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not bitching per se, I was just wondering if anyone else had<br/>
noticed this phenomenon.</div>
