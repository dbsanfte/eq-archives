<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-681024875">These things don&#39;t increase lag.  Think about it.  The game world is<br/>
completely pre-defined.  The server doesn&#39;t send you any information<br/>
about what the trees, buildings or scenery looks like.  All the<br/>
server sends is information about what the monsters are doing, what<br/>
the people are doing, any messages, and if there are any corpses or<br/>
equipment laying on the ground anywhere.  That is, things that are<br/>
not part of the static world.  You have a CD, that CD stores the<br/>
pre-defined world.<br/>
  I could see where corpses would increase lag because that<br/>
information would need to be sent to you.  A lot of people in a zone,<br/>
and a lot of monsters running aggro.  All these things would do it.<br/>

&gt;Of course they increase lag.<br/>
&gt;A higher Polygon count and texture count, means slowwer redraw more<br/>
&gt;texture and memory swapping. Plus more mathematical calculations.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I have heard that stationary non moving objects do not increase lag, If <br/>
&gt;that<br/>
&gt; &gt; were the cas than all the trees , rocks, buildings, and whatever else <br/>
&gt;that<br/>
&gt; &gt; may be in zone would increase lag too IMO.<br/>
