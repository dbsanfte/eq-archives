<div id="ygrps-yiv-2043254969">The regular and greater lightstones are still there, it is just that now <br/>
all of the wisps that used to not have any stones carry the burned <br/>
out ones.  Keeps people from knowing which wisps have the good <br/>
ones whereas it used to be very easy to tell which wisps had <br/>
stones and which didnt.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; that&#39;s a really good idea, but getting the lightstones now is a<br/>
&gt; bust...they took out looting lightstones and glightstones a while back<br/>
&gt; with a path...now you get a burned out lightstone or a nosave<br/>
&gt; lightstone...pretty much worthless....if you had one before the patch, you<br/>
&gt; still have it...&lt;have one on both my toons&gt; but you can no longer loot<br/>
&gt; em...you still get money off the wisps tho....just root and<br/>
&gt; blast...doesn&#39;t always work, but it sure does help....if you need help,<br/>
&gt; get a warrior with a combine (; they take the hits, and you can just blast<br/>
&gt; away...what i did...(:<br/>
