<br/>
I&#39;ll clear up a lot of junk that you might find on everelore.  Gynok<br/>
definately spawns at the zone point. He starts there, if he is being<br/>
camped he dies there, if not he slaughters 1st floor players then works<br/>
his way down to the third lvl.  If you see a Ghoul spawn there, that is<br/>
the place holder so kill it.  Otherwise the Ghoul will run Gynoks<br/>
pattern, being the only truly mobile spawn in the zone.  Gynok won&#39;t<br/>
spawn while that Ghoul is on the loose.  <br/>
<br/>
Read everelore.com for theories as to what makes Gynok spawn.  My 29<br/>
druid has killed him twice by luck.  Once after Gynok spawned on my<br/>
Clerics head while medding at the entrance, the other time the druid<br/>
picked it up on tracking and gated to the spawn point and followed the<br/>
corpses to the 2nd lvl.  It was lucky in that 90% of my time in Befallen<br/>
that spawn is camped.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t think a 22 cleric can solo Gynok.  Clerics are lousy soloists<br/>
although Gynok is undead.<br/>
<br/>
I traded one of my rings for a Guardian Shield (+8 wisdom).  Don&#39;t think<br/>
i have the patience to camp Mitty for two gold rings while not getting<br/>
xp.<br/>

&gt; Hey Everyone,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I really would like to complete my Paw of Opalla, i TOTALLY lucked in<br/>
&gt; to the first 3 rings, i camped Mitty for about an hour and she droped<br/>
&gt; the gold and copper.  Picked the silver up in Blackburrow, and now all<br/>
&gt; i need is the Platinum.  Therein lies the problem.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have heard many differing accounts of where to find Gynok Molter.<br/>
&gt; So, if you have SEEN him, not heard about him being somewhere, but<br/>
&gt; ACTUALLY SEEN HIM with YOUR character, please let me know where.  Yes,<br/>
&gt; i know Befallen, but where?  First floor in entrance area? Third floor<br/>
&gt; near Elf Skeletons??  Please let me know any visual sightings.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>
