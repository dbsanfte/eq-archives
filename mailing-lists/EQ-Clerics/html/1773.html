<div id="ygrps-yiv-1547779680">Not sure if anyone else has seen this bug but I thought I&#39;d ask just to<br/>
see if it&#39;s a clientside bug I&#39;ve picked up or not.<br/>
<br/>
If I have an alcoholic drink in slot 3 of my inventory and I right click<br/>
on my third spell to forget it I seem to drink one bottle of whatever I<br/>
have in that 3rd inventory slot.  I didn&#39;t notice I was doing this the<br/>
first time and I was messing about with my spells memming and remmemming<br/>
spells to cure someone..  I stood up and everything was swaying all over<br/>
the place.. it seems I&#39;d drunk about 3 bottles of alcohol while I was<br/>
memmin/forgetting spells..  this almost got my entire party killed since<br/>
I couldn&#39;t cast when I needed to.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else experienced this?<br/>
