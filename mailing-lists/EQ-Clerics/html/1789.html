<b>Subject:</b> Re: Gynok&#39;s Placeholders <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-184663664">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
There has been some excellent posts on Gynok placeholders.  I was<br/>
earlier under the impression that the place holder roamed lvl three<br/>
cause I&#39;ve killed it while camping a spot that was out of the way.  I<br/>
would lend support to the theory that it takes up a stationary residence<br/>
at a random spot on lvl 3.<br/>
<br/>
Knowing the locations of the spawns on lvl three I have noticed<br/>
irregularaties which I now believe to be the Gynok placeholder.  Knowing<br/>
what i have learned from these posts I don&#39;t believe it is necessary to<br/>
clear lvl 3 to kill the placeholder.  I think I&#39;d have a good chance at<br/>
sniping the culprit.  If you don&#39;t know the floor, two spawns that are<br/>
standing unusually close to each other are is a good place to start.<br/>
<br/>
I have never been in Befallen to camp Gynok but my 29 Druid has two<br/>
kills while my Cleric was getting to lvl 20 in Befallen.  The 29 Druid<br/>
pretty much had the run of the place except for the odd Ghoul and<br/>
Thaumalurgist that wanted a piece.  Those Thaumalurgists are nasty.<br/>
