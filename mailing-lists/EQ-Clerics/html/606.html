&gt; Glad someone else mentioned it, when i made 14 bought my spells, and didnt<br/>
&gt; know if any components were needed. But, since i just did a stint in the<br/>
&gt; pixies/fairies had a bunch of gems on me. Spell went off but at lev-14<br/>
&gt; didnt see any great improvements from center +holy armor, especially since<br/>
&gt; the gem cost about 3g+.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think you&#39;re missing the point here - the &quot;improvement&quot; of Symbols<br/>
isn&#39;t that they REPLACE &lt;HP/AC Buff + AC Buff&gt; but that they *stack* on<br/>
top.  When I have Bravery, Spirit Armor, Symbol of Ryltan, and Guard on<br/>
me, I&#39;m able to do some good second-line tanking easily, without<br/>
worries.<br/>
