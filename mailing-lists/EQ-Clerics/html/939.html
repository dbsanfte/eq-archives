<div id="ygrps-yiv-1730847519">that&#39;s in the PoF (Plane of Fear)  which is what I said to discount :)<br/>
Paly&#39;s and Tanks can get items by lvl 20 that are THIERS only...as can most<br/>
classes....which is why I it kinda peeves me about how Clerics are treated<br/>
sometimes....<br/>

<br/>
ok,  this may seem kinda moot to bring up....but has anyone found (next to<br/>
in Plane of Fear) any CLERIC only items? <br/>
<br/>
i bring this up because after going through EQlizer again...i find the: <br/>
<br/>
Polished Mithril Torque <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
its got +13 int AND wis....and War, Pal, Rog, Brd, Shd, Rng and MNK can wear<br/>
it.  That&#39;s it.  A Cleric cant wear a piece of armor a Ranger even could,<br/>
and that a MONK can, which would give him his prime requiste, yet classes<br/>
which shouldnt be touching this are. (Monk, how many wear anything with 4<br/>
weight?  not .4, but 4, when they cant really go above 14!!!)<br/>
<br/>
Its lil things like this that really get to me about how Verant works.  Was<br/>
just wondering how all you other clerics felt...and if you knew who we could<br/>
posibly contact in Verant to maybe fix some of the lil oversites!!!!<br/>
