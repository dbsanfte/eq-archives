<div id="ygrps-yiv-2090714594">Hi. I&#39;m new to this mail group but thought I would put in my 2cents here. I<br/>
am a level 10 High Elf Cleric on the Rodcet Nife server. I regularly group<br/>
with a Paladin and a Wizard. They know better than to tell me that my only<br/>
job is to sit back and heal. I jump right in with them and watch their<br/>
health rather intently. If I see that they need my services, I back out,<br/>
heal them and then get right back in. I don&#39;t tank as the Paladin enjoys<br/>
doing that herself. I will often times use that little strike spell to get<br/>
the targets attention. My attack isn&#39;t all that great but at least I feel I<br/>
contribute more than just an occasional healing spell or buff to the group.<br/>
No one has complained yet.<br/>

&gt;Just wanted to open a discussion on Clerics who love to fight.  I am<br/>
&gt;happy being a cleric, but I cannot resist jumping into the heat of a<br/>
&gt;battle and kicking some back.  I also like to occassionally tank.  I try<br/>
&gt;to save all my mana for healing, but sometimes I just love to blast<br/>
&gt;away.  This is probably because I feel useless when grouped as my<br/>
&gt;regular attack doesn&#39;t compare to others in the group.  Anyone else feel<br/>
&gt;this way?  Any experiences to share?<br/>
