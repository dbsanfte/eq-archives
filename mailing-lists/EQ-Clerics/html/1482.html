<b>Subject:</b> Changes in spawning <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-623457359">I have hunted the Shrine in LF a lot and I have noticed a difference their<br/>
last night. One the mummies and skeletons (lvl 9-13)have a lot more booty. I<br/>
made several plat in an hour. HOWEVER there was a spawn variation last<br/>
night. Normally I just take them in rotation and they spawn about every 5<br/>
mins. Once last night a 2nd mummy spawned about 10 seconds after I pulled<br/>
the first. Has anyone noticed this. Personally I really like the idea as it<br/>
changed a &quot;cushy&quot; kill into a near death experience. I look forward to<br/>
hearing your thoughts.<br/>
