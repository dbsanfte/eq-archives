<div id="ygrps-yiv-818393233">Ok, all this IPX talk, and we&#39;ve forgotten the original post--I too am<br/>
getting strange lag at times, which has never happened before. And my<br/>
meter is not showing any lag at all. I find it disconcerting, to say the<br/>
least. Rest assured, I have a very fast computer/graphics setup, and a<br/>
fast modem. I recently downloaded a big 28 meg SBLive! upgrade...I<br/>
wonder if that crap has affected my gameplay somehow...I hate some of<br/>
those SBLive! components.<br/>
