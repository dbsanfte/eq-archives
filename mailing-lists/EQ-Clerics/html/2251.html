<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;BI Medallion                 +3 wis/int  (have had this forever it seems)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>lol, i&#39;ve had mine forever too... it&#39;s the first +wis item I owned<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Mirthil Bracer (2)           4ac +3st +5wis<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh what I wouldn&#39;t do for these... but alas, i&#39;m only level 29... give it<br/>
time...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Adamentium Epaulets (sp?)    9ac +7wis<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wow!  Where do these come from?  I will assume they are out of my range for<br/>
a while yet, but it&#39;s nice to dream...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Ethernal Mist Leggings       14ac +5st/agi +9wis +dis/pois (was gator legs)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>400<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;plat for and tell me if it&#39;s worth another 1600 plat.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>LOL... 2000 plat eh?  How much did it end up selling for?   The runed<br/>
circlet is definately a better value.. and actually you can get that very<br/>
easily (even at my level) if you are willing to wait for that slow spawning<br/>
goblin preacher...<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t planning on going for the cleric armor... but then I looked closer<br/>
and realized it actually is a little better than rubicite (except for the<br/>
obvious Rubi breastplate which had that nice healing aura on it)... and I<br/>
saw a cleric wearing most of the cleric armor the other day and it looked<br/>
really nice on him.  So I may try to get some of that, though I don&#39;t know<br/>
that I want to replace my bloodstained tunic which has +wisdom on it....<br/>
