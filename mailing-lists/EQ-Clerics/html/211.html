<div id="ygrps-yiv-1070810141">well, the main reason i don&#39;t use a 1h blunt now is because i like being able to<br/>
hit harder....the hardest i&#39;ve hit with the staff is 31, but the max i ever hit<br/>
with a screaming mace was like 17....plus, i haven&#39;t seen any 1h blunt that goes<br/>
higher than 9 dmg...i&#39;m sure they exist somewhere....at least i&#39;d hope so<br/>

&gt; I notice that most of you are using 2H blunt weapons. Do ya&#39;ll have problems<br/>
&gt; with the weight issues? If so what do you use to compensate it? I have a<br/>
&gt; darken wood shield and that gives me a greater lightstone glow and +9 str. I<br/>
&gt; really enjoy having that shield for the fact of being able to carry more<br/>
&gt; stuff. Anyway my thoughts. </span></blockquote></div>
