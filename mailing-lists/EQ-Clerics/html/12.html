<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-346238245">If you are in Freeport i would suggest finding one fighter or perhaps two<br/>
and go to oasis. You meditate and heal your fighters. When you have the<br/>
mana up you can take a few swings at those crocs and caimans aswell. This<br/>
should work swell up to 19. The only drawback is the money. You wont get<br/>
any what so ever. But Xp wise it&#39;s brilliant. If you want to solo i can<br/>
suggest SRO. Usually pretty empty there (at Solusek Ro atleast). There you<br/>
can kill ghouls, tarantulas and dry bone skels (easy with those).<br/>
Hope it might help you.<br/>
<br/>
I come in peace ..<br/>
