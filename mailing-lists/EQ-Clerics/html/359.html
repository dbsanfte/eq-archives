<div id="ygrps-yiv-643029567">Limiting it to 1500 AT A TIME would be a good idea.  If the server has<br/>
1500 when you log on, then it sucks to be you.  Make another character<br/>
on another server.  Serves you right for loggin off!  he he he  (what do<br/>
you mean, you have a life outside of EQ?).<br/>
<br/>
It would benefit those currently playing on the server.. but I guess<br/>
there is no solution to help the number of people currently existing on<br/>
a server right now. (besides preventing further account creations for<br/>
the older servers...)<br/>

&gt; I disagree on the moving anyone on lvl 10 and below to another server.<br/>
&gt; How<br/>
&gt; would you feel if you were Lvl 10 or below and you had friends say on<br/>
&gt; 12 and<br/>
&gt; up, next thing you know you&#39;re on another server and they are still on<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; one and you can&#39;t group or talk to them anymore?  I think only 500<br/>
&gt; per-server is too little, I&#39;d say 1,000 to 1,500 is cool I&#39;d take<br/>
&gt; 1,950 to<br/>
&gt; 2,000 if they&#39;d put in more places for us to go and hunt and give us<br/>
&gt; more<br/>
&gt; cool items to loot.  I heard the Glowing Crook you get off Lock Jaw<br/>
&gt; can be a<br/>
&gt; pain cause 20+ Wizards kill the steal and get the Crook.  Thats<br/>
&gt; something<br/>
&gt; else they need to fix, I mean how is it right for me as a Cleric to be<br/>
&gt; beating the crap outta something and a powerful Wizard comes along and<br/>
&gt; with<br/>
&gt; one blast kills it and gets the exp and the loot?  Are Wizards too<br/>
&gt; powerful,<br/>
&gt; seems like it too me, I know a Wizard that on Lvl 12 was doing over<br/>
&gt; 100 dmg<br/>
&gt; to things with one cast of a magic spell.  I on Lvl 16 get&#39;s lucky to<br/>
&gt; do 76<br/>
&gt; dmg to somethings with one cast of a spell.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I couldnt agree with you more!!!! Last night Fennin Ro had OVER 1950<br/>
&gt; people<br/>
&gt; &gt; on that ONE server!!!!!! They need to lock that server down<br/>
&gt; completely and<br/>
&gt; &gt; possibly move any level 10 and below character over to another<br/>
&gt; server.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Personally, I don&#39;t think ANY server should have more than 500<br/>
&gt; people on<br/>
&gt; it.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Also, they need to have more than one zone carry certain &#39;very<br/>
&gt; saught&#39;<br/>
&gt; after<br/>
&gt; &gt; items, such as Rubicite armor. Why does Cazic Thule have to be the<br/>
&gt; only<br/>
&gt; &gt; zone? Of COURSE there will be 70-100 people in the zone! Move the<br/>
&gt; Ruby<br/>
&gt; &gt; around...put some in Rathe Mountains, make a level 25+ zone on<br/>
&gt; Erudin so<br/>
&gt; &gt; Ruby can drop there....but not all in one zone. Look at the<br/>
&gt; Journeyman<br/>
&gt; &gt; boots. ONE NPC in the entire game has it, its a no drop item,<br/>
&gt; meaning you<br/>
&gt; &gt; have to loot it yourself. Why cant this npc drop it everytime to<br/>
&gt; stop<br/>
&gt; &gt; overcamping and people from Kill stealing? No, that would make way<br/>
&gt; too<br/>
&gt; much<br/>
&gt; &gt; sense, I guess.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Over camping and lagging CAN end if some of the ideas that so many<br/>
&gt; have<br/>
&gt; sent<br/>
&gt; &gt; in are implemented. But of course, that would cause Verant having to<br/>
&gt; &gt; actually DO something...can&#39;t have that. (naww...I&#39;m not upset heheh<br/>
&gt; &lt;grin&gt;)<br/>
