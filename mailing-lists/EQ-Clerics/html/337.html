<div id="ygrps-yiv-424024727">I didn&#39;t know, I was just taking a guess.  I just made it to Lvl 16, took me<br/>
many days to hit it but then again the Mino&#39;s I fought most were green to me<br/>
and a few would con risky blue to me.  At 16 they still give me a bit of exp<br/>
(but not much), but I&#39;m getting ready to jump on over to Unrest or Runnyeye.<br/>
From what I&#39;ve heard I think it&#39;ll be Unrest, heard Runnyeye can be a pain<br/>
even for players in the 30&#39;s.  Hope to get Lvl 20 by next week but I have a<br/>
feeling it&#39;ll be a bit longer then that.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I think what she was saying is it depends on what Lvl the person you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; &gt; casting it on is on.  Like since I&#39;m still lvl 15 (should hit Lvl 16<br/>
&gt; &gt; sometime today), if casted it on me I would not get much exp back but if<br/>
