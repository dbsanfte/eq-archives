<div id="ygrps-yiv-1650351126">I am certain that<br/>
unless I buy a pair off EBay or in-game, I will never own them.<br/>
<br/>
they are no drop, so there is no way you can buy them from someone you have <br/>
to loot the corpse yourself for the boots.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And for those of you who have the boots and will<br/>
swear to me that it took you only a day to get them, I congratulate you on <br/>
your accomplishment.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It took my group 29 hours to get 4 pair of boots. I looted the first pair, <br/>
and had it within an hour. But the rest came with 6 hour differences or so.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I do beleive that items such as JBoots should be put on more than one NPC. <br/>
To have them only on Drezlna, is absolutely ridiculous. We had two kills of <br/>
ours stolen when we camped that 29 hours. Verant should put items such as <br/>
JBoots and Rubicite Armor on SEVERAL NPCs throughout Norrath. That way, more <br/>
people will have a chance to own such items.....but I suppose that would <br/>
make too many people happy and Verant doesn&#39;t appear to have the happiness <br/>
of the customer in mind.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I agree that the servers need to capped. I even think 1000 on a server is <br/>
alot...I would love to see servers capped at 500. Wow,<br/>
would THAT be something =)<br/>
