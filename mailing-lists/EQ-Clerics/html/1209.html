&gt; Get a life.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; EQ is not one. Its a game, a fashion if you like, it<br/>
&gt; will flourish for<br/>
&gt; while. It may be 6 months, it may be years. Other<br/>
&gt; games will come and go,<br/>
&gt; they will have success and failures too. Some people<br/>
&gt; will move on straight<br/>
&gt; away, others will wait till they close the servers<br/>
&gt; down and ball their eyes<br/>
&gt; out. WHO CARES.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Enjoy the game, enjoy your character, enjoy this<br/>
&gt; sense of community. Enjoy<br/>
&gt; it now. You might be dead in real life in 6 months.<br/>
&gt; So stop worrying, stop<br/>
&gt; whining...just hang out here with us Clerics.<br/>
&gt; Discuss evening wear, PvP<br/>
&gt; play, begging if you like... but most of all enjoy<br/>
&gt; life and EQ.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

Well said!<br/>
<br/>
I have never played a computer game that has kept my attention for more<br/>
then 50 hours or so. I am somewhere around 20days played(480 hours)with<br/>
EQ. That in itself is incredible to me. I expect I will get bored of<br/>
it, or something newer and better will come along, but it has been<br/>
money more then well spent. I enjoy every aspect, even having to work<br/>
around aspects of the game I don&#39;t agree with(divine aura stun, dot<br/>
bug).<br/>
<br/>
Lets keep discussing the clerics and aspects which can improve each<br/>
person&#39;s enjoyment of the game.<br/>
<br/>
I often camp........but to heal and buff, not for items. For example, I<br/>
will hang out outside of unrest and just wait for the escapees of the<br/>
nasty trains that happen often in that place. Great fun roleplaying<br/>
while being very useful to other players. People will often donate nice<br/>
items for helping them (blood stained mantle, bronze items, etc.) Form<br/>
of begging if you accept(in keeping with the other current thread)?? <br/>
<br/>
Just random thoughts while waiting for a meeting at work.<br/>
