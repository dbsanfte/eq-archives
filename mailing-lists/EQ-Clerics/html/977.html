<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1056271542">One easy item to get is a +2 wisdom ring.  Enchanters can make these<br/>
when their jewelry skill is still fairly low.  I had a 13th level<br/>
enchanter friend make me some.  They will cost you 4 platinum apiece.<br/>
If you want +2 wisdom earrings, those will run you 25 plat apiece and<br/>
will require a much more skilled enchanter.<br/>

&gt;Hi all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am a level 10 halfling cleric of Bristlebane, Brytewing on the Rathe<br/>
&gt;server.  I have spent my life in Rivervale, Misty Thicket, and am now<br/>
&gt;venturing into RunneyEye with small groups.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My question is this:  I have heard alot of talk about wisdom increaing<br/>
&gt;items.  However, I have yet to see any in my gameplaying experiences.  <br/>
&gt;Could<br/>
&gt;some of you more experienced players give me a hint as to what items<br/>
&gt;increase wisdom, and perhaps where I could best find them?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Many thanks.<br/>
