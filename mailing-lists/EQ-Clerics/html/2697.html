Subject: [EQ-Clerics] Several questions<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; From: &quot;Curtis Bennett&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:die_kluge@...">die_kluge@...</a>&gt;<br/>

&gt; 1. Are high elf clerics the lowest leveling race/class in the game?<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d heard that at least high elves leveled about the slowest, and my<br/>
&gt; observations seem to lend itself to that assumption.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Dunno, sorry<br/>
<br/>
&gt; 2. I&#39;ve got all the pieces for my caduceus of the sacrement.  The<br/>
&gt; thing from Mistmoore, the piece from the darkbone giant skel, and two<br/>
&gt; plat bars.  When I go to Ro temple, and I give the bars to the person<br/>
&gt; to magnetize them, do I give them 1 bar at a time?  Also, do I give<br/>
&gt; all 4 things to the person (is it Gavel?) at the same time, with the<br/>
&gt; 2 bars in each box, filling up the 4 total slots (bar, bar, ingot,<br/>
&gt; icon)?  I don&#39;t want to screw it up!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
To magnetize/vulcanize/galvanize the bars, you find the correct NPC and hand<br/>
the bars over ONE AT A TIME.  You can find out who you need to see by asking<br/>
&quot;What about Galvanized?&quot;, etc. to the original quest giver.  When turning in<br/>
all the pieces to the quest giver, make sure the bars are NOT stacked, and<br/>
each of the 4 boxes has an item.  Also make sure you have an open inventory<br/>
slot.....you&#39;ll really like that mace, it is great for a one handed weapon.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; 3. Is Aviak Isle a good place to solo at 26th level?  I just made 26th<br/>
&gt; and while I don&#39;t know if I can take gull or not, I&#39;d like to give it<br/>
&gt; the ol&#39; college try (if I see him).  But I&#39;m curious if I could solo<br/>
&gt; here with relative safety.  I&#39;d hate to pull one blue and have 14<br/>
&gt; birds jump me, with nowhere to run to. How does one leave this island?<br/>
&gt; Gate away?  Is this the island right near the Butcherblock pier?  Any<br/>
&gt; solo&#39;ing tips here are appreciated.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You should be able to pull to the very shore of the island with little<br/>
chance of a wanderer diving in, that is what I did.  To get off the island,<br/>
you can gate or swim to one of the two islands that the boats stop at and<br/>
then re-board the boat to either BB or FP.<br/>
