<div id="ygrps-yiv-1350685347">It doesn&#39;t spawn once or twice per 24 hours... it&#39;s random.  Some people<br/>
have to camp for weeks to get legs, but i&#39;ve heard of people getting 3<br/>
ancient crocks in an hour and getting legs on two of those spawns.  Granted,<br/>
that was very lucky for them and not the norm... but luck is what it&#39;s all<br/>
about.<br/>

&gt; Sorta hard to describe where he is...basically, he is near the zone to the<br/>
&gt; live side of LG.  Best way to show you where he is is have someone lead<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; there or look at a map of UG.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Dunno how exciting it would be for your guild to hunt there though.  Maybe<br/>
&gt; if they kill all the frogs while getting there.  His placeholder and his<br/>
&gt; spawn time is 15 min.  I truely believe he only spawns twice in 24 hours<br/>
&gt; though...if even that...sometimes I think he only spawns once in 24 hrs.<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; camped that spot for 48 hrs straight practically and finally just traded<br/>
&gt; some stuff for the leggings.  I heard some people who were after the<br/>
leggins<br/>
&gt; have to camp over a week to get em.  BTW the legs are the rare drops.  I<br/>
&gt; collected up to 3 arms while camping him in 48 hours.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The reason why I say that this spot might be boring for a guild raid is<br/>
due<br/>
&gt; to the fact that it is usually camped...by ppl who usually can camp<br/>
&gt; solo...(i.e. druids, wizzie, necro, shamans, etc) The arms are sought<br/>
after<br/>
&gt; by the int casters and the leggins are sought after by all the wis<br/>
casters.<br/>
&gt; On top of that...it&#39;s a pretty boring camp.<br/>
&gt; To camp it solo...you must be at least 36.  A small group (let say less<br/>
then<br/>
&gt; 5 ppl) of 25+ can handle that spot easily.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Might be best to have your guild do the entire UG to liven things a bit.<br/>
&gt; Making a round of all the name spawn area might be fun.<br/>
