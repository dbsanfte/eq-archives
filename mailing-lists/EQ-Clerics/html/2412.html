<div id="ygrps-yiv-159755992">I was totally keen on the game, too, at 16th level.  Then I tried to<br/>
get a screaming mace once I hit 19th.  I had truly never had to camp<br/>
anything until I tried to get the bracer of battle off the Orc<br/>
Warlord.  It changed my perception of the game, and left a bit of a<br/>
sour taste in my mouth.  I ended up just buying the mace from an old<br/>
friend, but I was getting pretty tired of camping for that bracer, I<br/>
can tell you that much.<br/>

&gt;I hope you are all successful.  Personally, I am too impatient to camp for<br/>
&gt;items, even if it it only takes an hour.  So if your protest helps in that<br/>
&gt;regard, I am sure it will benfit me as well.  My approach is to just play<br/>
&gt;the game, amass experience and wealth, and hope that I can buy what I need.<br/>
&gt;Mind you , I&#39;m only 16th level now, so in the future, I may need to camp <br/>
&gt;for<br/>
&gt;stuff.  But so far, I have not camped for a single thing, I am happy with<br/>
&gt;what my character can and can&#39;t do, and have no complaints about world<br/>
&gt;called Norrath. The only complaints I have I can live with, and they mostly<br/>
&gt;have to do with the UI of the game and with GM conduct.<br/>

&gt;Aye, but looking at it from your perspective you could consider that if the<br/>
&gt;sit-in is successful, it&#39;s possible that the 8 hour camps could be reduced<br/>
&gt;which would give you LESS time to sit around on purpose (camping for<br/>
&gt;items)...  =)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It all depends on how you look at it...<br/>

&gt; &gt; Well, I&#39;m taking this sit in from a different perspective.  I only get a<br/>
&gt;few<br/>
&gt; &gt; hours of play time a week, and I think that I&#39;d rather use it playing <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt; game as opposed to sitting around.  I do enough sitting around, what <br/>
&gt;with<br/>
&gt; &gt; trying to find a group and all to play in.  I sure don&#39;t want to do it <br/>
&gt;on<br/>
&gt; &gt; purpose.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Just my thought.<br/>
