<div id="ygrps-yiv-1350245077">Nope it isnt just you....  I think most clerics from 20 below have some kind<br/>
of feeling that we can melee with the rest.  I knew I had that feeling till<br/>
I was level 24 and finally realized that my melee just blows compared to the<br/>
rest.  Give it some time.  The more experienced clerics about 20+ will heal<br/>
and buff instead of melee.  Its just a phase I wouldnt worry about it to<br/>
much.<br/>

Hi all :)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve played clerics in the past, and when I was grouped, I knew my job,<br/>
and did it very well. I buffed the tanks before battle, watched their<br/>
health bars carefully during battle, and (at levels before 25) engaged<br/>
in a bit of melee if things were going well. No one had to ask me for a<br/>
heal. I mean, come on. When you go to the doctor, should it be necesary<br/>
for you to ask him to heal you? Hell, no. That&#39;s his job, for pete&#39;s<br/>
sake.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I have recently been playing a barbarian warrior, because I knew<br/>
that I wanted to continue to melee, which would be a no-no for my cleric<br/>
at higher levels. Now, however, I&#39;m finding it very difficult to find<br/>
good clerics to group with. My warrior is level 19 now, and I can<br/>
honestly say that I&#39;ve yet to find a cleric who knows what the hell he&#39;s<br/>
supposed to do in a group. Is this just a problem with lower level<br/>
clerics? I certainly hope so, because if I EVER see a cleric not buffing<br/>
or healing in my groups at higher levels, I&#39;ll kick that person out of<br/>
my group faster than you can say &quot;Bob&#39;s your uncle!&quot; I won&#39;t even bother<br/>
to try explaining to them what they&#39;re supposed to do, because by that<br/>
time, they will have already perfected their bad habits. And I have made<br/>
it my solemn duty to NOT get myself or my group killed because of<br/>
someone else&#39;s arrogant stupidity/ignorance.<br/>
<br/>
That being said, I want to ask a question. Why are there (seemingly) so<br/>
many clerics out there who nuke? For pete&#39;s sake! There&#39;s a pefectly<br/>
good nuking class--wizard! Why didn&#39;t they choose that class?<br/>
<br/>
I remember when I first got smite, I wanted to show everyone how<br/>
powerful I was. But I quickly got over it, because people much preferred<br/>
my healing and buffing capabilities over a smite or two during battle.<br/>
<br/>
It just irritates the hell out of me when I have to fight side by side<br/>
with a cleric who&#39;s at full health and who won&#39;t get beat on because he<br/>
can&#39;t melee worth a damn AND he won&#39;t heal me, even when I&#39;m down to my<br/>
last bubble of health. GRRR! <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks for reading my--somewhat--rant on clerics. If you have<br/>
any advice for me to give these people, I&#39;d be happy to hear it. Any<br/>
time I&#39;ve tried to offer them advice, they&#39;ve either ignored me, or gave<br/>
me some lame reason why they do what they do. Sigh.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I should resurrect my clerics....<br/>

Just curious...any clerics here solo (or come close to it) to lvl 50?<br/>
<br/>
Is there a good website that tells you how to do the cleric armor quest?<br/>
Like the loc of the items.  On a scale of 1-10 (1 being easy and 10<br/>
being<br/>
hard.)  What do you rank the cleric quest to be?<br/>
