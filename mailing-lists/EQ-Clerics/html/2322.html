<div id="ygrps-yiv-1523390057">That&#39;s not really true... they are allies, but you can&#39;t get training from a Paladin guildmaster.  As somebody else said though, in Freeport the Paladin&#39;s and the Clerics guild are in the same temple... and unless they are carrying a weapon that identifies them as a cleric or a paladin, it&#39;s not easy to tell which is which.  If you go to a paladin guildmaster, they will still say you are not a paladin and refuse to help you.   However, the person standing next to them may be a cleric... so you can train from them.<br/>

&gt; someone prob alrdy ans this but, the clerics and the pally&#39;s are allys, so <br/>
&gt; therefore you can tain at both guilds, that is why you usually allmost <br/>
&gt; always find the cleric and payy guild in same building or very close <br/>
&gt; togerher, i train at either, whichever i come to first =0)<br/>

&gt; &gt;Last time I leveled I went back to Freeport to train. Not knowing the area<br/>
&gt; &gt;very well I managed to go to the Paladin&#39;s guild instead of the cleric&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt;guild without realizing it (yes, I know, not very clever but it was very<br/>
&gt; &gt;late). I located a trainer there and the system allowed her to train me.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Just curious if any one else has done this and if this might allow a player<br/>
&gt; &gt;to literally use any guild to train in. This has ,embarrassingly enough,<br/>
&gt; &gt;worked twice for me.<br/>
