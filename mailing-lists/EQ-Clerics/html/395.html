<div id="ygrps-yiv-276336096">I agree, I like 1hb better cause for one I can then have a shield, can&#39;t do<br/>
that if I&#39;m carrying around a big 2hb staff.  I don&#39;t think they should have<br/>
it to were Clerics can&#39;t wield staffs tho, to many Cleric&#39;s would get very<br/>
upset cause they can&#39;t use the SoO or any other cool staff they like.<br/>
I&#39;d like to see a Cleric only weapon thats at least 12+ dmg 38 delay, 7+<br/>
wis, 7+ int or something like that.  We just need a cool weapon that only we<br/>
can use.<br/>

&gt; But see then we run into the problem of &quot;1hb or 2hb&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Me personally I think it should be 1hb because I just dont see a cleric<br/>
&gt; wielding a 2 handed weapon, not even a staff.  I always picture a cleric<br/>
&gt; wielding a mace (hammer if dwarf) and a shield.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now a Morning Star is close enough for me, but a staff?  Just seems wrong.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As we have said in the past, we are not a melee class, but I would still<br/>
&gt; love a one hander that did over 10 dmg with less than 40 delay.<br/>
&gt; What would be cool though is something like +7(or more) wis and a party<br/>
