<div id="ygrps-yiv-1107225502"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;  The one recurring thing I see here, is wisdom is everything. Is<br/>
&gt; this true? From what I&#39;ve seen of higher levels, even having near<br/>
&gt; double the wisdom of others, you get like enough mana to cast<br/>
&gt; half a greater heal or whatever the non-full heal one is (I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; only lvl 20). Seems strange that wis is so important if this is the case.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Actually by 20, you should start collecting some WIS items for yourself as<br/>
well...as that is the turning pt IMO.  You see, the formula goes something<br/>
like this...for ever 5 WIS = (lvl) manna. EX: at lvl 20 for ever 5 WIS I get<br/>
20 manna and at lvl 21 for ever 5 WIS I get 21 manna...that means that by 50<br/>
for ever 1 WIS you get 10 manna.  So you want as much WIS as you can the<br/>
higher lvl you go...cause each pt of WIS gets converted to more manna the<br/>
higher lvl you go...and that means more cast, more heals, etc.<br/>
