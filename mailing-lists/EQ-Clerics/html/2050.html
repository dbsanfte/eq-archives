&gt;      I just got my Caducous (sp?) of Sacrement last night.  The ingot does<br/>
&gt;      spawn on the red giant skeleton in the undead ruins of the rathe<br/>
&gt;      mountains.  He&#39;s not that easy a foe as it took me 3 banish undeads to<br/>
&gt;      kill him, he was blue to a L39 cleric.  I was there for mabye 15-20<br/>
&gt;      mins last night and saw 2 of these ingots droped so the spawn is<br/>
&gt;      fairly quick on this one.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      Once you get this ingot and the icon from mistmoor you also need 2<br/>
&gt;      enchanted plat bars (why we need enchanted plat to do our quests I&#39;ll<br/>
&gt;      never know) that you turn into magnitized bars in the temple.  Give<br/>
&gt;      these to Gavel and you have a nice new 12 dam 32 delay 1 hand blunt<br/>
&gt;      weapon (although it just looks like a morning star).<br/>
