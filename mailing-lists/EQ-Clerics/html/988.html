<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Can you elaborate on these things?  What thing from Runnyeye?<br/>
&gt;And where are those other items found?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh, sorry, the name escaped me when I was posting it.  As several ppl have<br/>
pointed out in response to my post, the &quot;thingy&quot; is the black iron<br/>
medallion.  I think it can be found on both the king and warlord of RE. Its<br/>
a pretty common drop.<br/>
<br/>
Charred shield can be found in Sol A...off a clockwork I heard so bad<br/>
faction against the gnomes...but who cares about faction with the gnomes<br/>
anyways? ;) JK  I like gnomes...they are cute...unless they are stealing my<br/>
kill.<br/>
<br/>
The jewelled scepter can be found in MM but that&#39;s all I know and I heard<br/>
you have to be in a full group of 35+ to get it.<br/>
<br/>
Umm I&#39;m not even sure if the savant cap gives WIS I think it gives manna or<br/>
INT.<br/>
