<b>Subject:</b> More on the Plane of Fear <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-407226513">Brad also talked about Plane of Fear and he&#39;s idea on how to keep low lvl<br/>
ppl out of it.  Heres what the post on EQVault said<br/>
&quot;Brad also stated that he was looking into a way to keep the low levels out<br/>
of the Plane of Fear. Perhaps something like the gate leading to the plane<br/>
doing damage to those who walk through it. Thus killing any low level player<br/>
before he even gets a glimpse of the plane.&quot;<br/>
Gee thats real fair, &quot;Hhhhmmm, I wonder what this gate is?&quot;  *ZAP kill!!!*<br/>
I say let them in but make it harder for low lvls, just like a low lvl<br/>
player wouldn&#39;t want to go to Unrest and if they did it&#39;s their fault when<br/>
they die.  Maybe put up a gate but around the gate have monster that would<br/>
jump low lvl players.  But for the gate to hurt EVERYONE and kill the low<br/>
lvls to me is very unfair.<br/>
