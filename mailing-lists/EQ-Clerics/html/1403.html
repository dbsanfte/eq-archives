<div id="ygrps-yiv-1515168317">I don&#39;t think you have to give up one to the exclusion of the other (melee<br/>
skills for casting skills).  I think a good cleric will develop both of<br/>
these skills, which makes them more well-rounded with more options.  As I<br/>
said in a previous post, I still melee in certain situations, and in others,<br/>
I do nothing but buff, heal and med and depending on the critters, throw in<br/>
a dd spell every now and then if appropriate.<br/>
