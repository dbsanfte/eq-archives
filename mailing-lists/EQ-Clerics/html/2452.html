<div id="ygrps-yiv-1904311222">Go to SolB or the bedroom/Savant&#39;s room in Lguk.  Another place is the upper<br/>
throne room in Cazic, but SolB and Lguk prolly better exp and less trains<br/>
and stupid people.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I have been stuck on level 35 for years now... (ok a slight<br/>
exageration..)<br/>
&gt; &gt; Someone told me that the specs in Feerrot was a good spot to get out of<br/>
this<br/>
&gt; &gt; level... I just spent 4 hours in Kith with a group and only got 25% of a<br/>
&gt; &gt; bbl. We where fighting many different things including reds...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; A few ppl in my group told me they ended up having to solo to get out of<br/>
&gt; &gt; this level with any type of speed...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Any insight would be appreciated.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I took a good while to get out of 35, I did it hunting in groups in Sol<br/>
&gt; B, Kings room if I managed to get into the group there (which being a<br/>
&gt; cleric wasn&#39;t actually that hard.. our server works on a waiting list..<br/>
&gt; however it seems to have two sections.. clerics and others.. :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Okay your going to be grouping with lvl 35-50&#39;s.. but you can get<br/>
&gt; through a lot of Kobolds in that time and you have a good chance of<br/>
&gt; picking up a pair of Runed Mithril Bracers (+5 wis +3 str AC 4).  Which<br/>
&gt; is nice.. :)<br/>
