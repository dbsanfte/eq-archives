<div id="ygrps-yiv-50768297">Well, this is definantly drifting waaaaay off topic, but let me break the<br/>
term &quot;full screen alpha blended lit polygons&quot; into simpler pieces and give a<br/>
few definitions:<br/>
<br/>
full screen polygon - basically a polygon that takes up the entire<br/>
screen -99% of modern consumer level 3D hardware can only render 3 sided<br/>
polygons (triangles or &#39;tris&#39;).   So in this case, imagine 10 very large<br/>
triangles that take up your entire screen.<br/>
<br/>
alpha blended - A good example of this is EQ&#39;s particle system - note how<br/>
the particles (when a spell is cast, etc) are translucent?  The 3D hardware<br/>
term for this translucency is &#39;alpha blending&#39; - which basically means<br/>
taking an arbitrary extra mathematical compenent (the &#39;alpha&#39; component) to<br/>
determine exactly how translucent the triangle or pixel is.  For example, a<br/>
triangle rendered with a 0 alpha value would be completely non translucent,<br/>
a triangle rendered with a .5 alpha value would be 50% translucent and one<br/>
rendered with a 1.0 alpha value would be completely translucent (invisible)<br/>
<br/>
lit - 3D jargon for having had 3D lighting information applied.  For<br/>
example, a &#39;tri&#39; that has been &#39;lit&#39;, takes into account all the nearby<br/>
lightsources in the 3d world and alters it&#39;s color to simulate the effects<br/>
of lighting on it.  For example, at night in EQ, the polys are darker<br/>
because the &#39;sun&#39; light has been turned down, so the lighting on the &#39;tris&#39;<br/>
is much darker.<br/>
<br/>
            I hope this helps,<br/>

&gt; Gosh I have to admit Im getting quit an education here.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;snip&gt; &lt;&lt;For example, I can bog down a voodoo II down to 10fps using only<br/>
&gt;10 textures if I render them all on full screen alpha blended lit polygons<br/>
&gt;(but the number of texels is in the tens of millions).... Anyways I hope<br/>
&gt;this helps to clear things up a bit&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Not really, Nindar,  I have no clue what you just said on the part &quot;full<br/>
&gt;screen alpha blended lit polygons&quot;...err wanna explain?   This is<br/>
&gt;fascinating btw...=)<br/>
