&gt;<br/>
&gt; I agree with this for sure.  Is there anyone on Erollisi Marr?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Again I wish to thank all for the help I have gotten from this list.<br/>
After<br/>
&gt; weeks of frustration in trying to make 11 in and around CB Yilari moved to<br/>
&gt; Freeport temporarily.    Well today she made 12 and has a lot of fun<br/>
killing<br/>
&gt; orcs in EC and dervs in N. Ro.  She has also had fun with the zombies and<br/>
&gt; mummies at the ruins in EC and the occasional wisp that comes along.  No<br/>
&gt; luck finding a GSL though yet.  Her only bad experience came when she was<br/>
&gt; talked into venturing down into Oasis.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I also understand what you all have been saying about being helpful and<br/>
&gt; people will notice.  Yilari has ran all over EC healing and curing disease<br/>
&gt; etc when people call out for aid.  Today someone came up to her and gave<br/>
her<br/>
&gt; a chain tunic.   Now she is looking to either give away or sell her<br/>
leather<br/>
&gt; one.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am wondering about weapons now.   She currently uses either cracked<br/>
staff<br/>
&gt; or summoned hammer.  She cannot afford one of the really nice weapons yet<br/>
&gt; but what should she be looking for?   Remember that she barely has 11pp in<br/>
&gt; the bank and has to be able to afford 14th level spells soon also.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks all,<br/>
&gt; Yilari, High Elven Cleric of Tunare, Erollsi Marr<br/>
