<div id="ygrps-yiv-804279241">aye the dmg was reduced.....max total dmg on lv 48 &lt;it doesn&#39;t go up after<br/>
that&gt; 516....would&#39;ve been doing around like you said, 550.....it starts out<br/>
doing 501, then raises 5 every level until it reaches 516....seems kinda like<br/>
a gyp to me...and banish never goes up...it&#39;s always max dmg of 585.....what<br/>
gives? i thought clerics were supposed to be able to slaughter undead &lt;hey<br/>
that&#39;s what we do&gt; and yet, druids of the same level can do 600+ i<br/>
believe...that&#39;s screwed<br/>

&gt; 1 word,  Retribution.    Dmg at level 44 is about 502.   I know a level 50<br/>
&gt; cleric who is doing 550 damage now.  (this spell was reduced recently, it<br/>
&gt; used to do more damage.)<br/>
