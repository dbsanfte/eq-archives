&gt;I could be wrong but I think a game day is about 1.5 hours real time.  So<br/>
&gt;Mr. J Daniels account would fit into what I heard about getting someone to<br/>
&gt;level 20 in 5 hours.  This is all hear-say but I believe it.  Here is how I<br/>
&gt;heard they did it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;First new character is outfitted in high level equipment and kick a??<br/>
&gt;weapon.<br/>
&gt;Then a group of 40+ characters buff the newbie; spells like Resolution,<br/>
&gt;Symbol of Naltron, Armor of Faith from a cleric.  Talisman of Altune,<br/>
&gt;Stamina, Guardian, Alacrity, Agility from a shaman.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Next Tanks go in on a level 20+ creature and taunt, clerics cast immobilize<br/>
&gt;and the newbie starts hitting on it.  If need be the cleric heals.  Once<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;creature is under half health the high level group takes it out and the<br/>
&gt;newbie gets lots and lots of exp.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Heard of another way that may be even faster. Buff yer newbie, as above.<br/>
Have the high levels pick on a tough monster. Knock it down to a tiny bit of<br/>
health left.. then zone. Let the newbie take the few remaining hp off it.<br/>
Instant huge xp for the newbie. I can believe you could bring a newbie to<br/>
levle 20 in 5 real-time hours with this technique.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a problem here, though. Lots of your offensive capability and<br/>
defensive capability (which translates as higher AC) depends on having<br/>
actually fought and defended. As a cleric, I am well aware of this: although<br/>
I think my primary duty during a battle is healing, I try to get as many<br/>
blows with my mace or staff in as I can, to max out those skills, and always<br/>
solo a few beasties per level to bring my Defense skills up to scratch.<br/>
Otherise, if there is ever a crisis and I *have* to help out on the front<br/>
line, I would not be effective.<br/>
<br/>
If the newbie doesn&#39;t do a fair amount of fighting, and take damage, he will<br/>
wind up being a level 20 with the AC and offensive skills of a level 2.<br/>
