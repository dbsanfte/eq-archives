<div id="ygrps-yiv-42124896">I hate to be a party pooper but i find that weapon almost to good to be <br/>
possible. With the given stats and what it does it would make it almost the <br/>
most powerful weapon in the game. 14 damage at 28 speed and cast spells that <br/>
do 200 damage. I am almost 40th cleric and asked my other cleric buds all 50 <br/>
and they have never heard of it and even inqured it to Gm Teur and he said <br/>
he has no clue. BUT I HOPE IT DOES, one think id for sure clerics have the <br/>
weakest weapons in the game. I know bla bla clerics are not fighters bla bla <br/>
but how come a wizard does more damage in melee then i do. i use a Sceptor <br/>
of Flame since that is the best 1 handed blunt i have seen and heard of so <br/>
far, and have black Enamaled Mace for back up. Soon they will add new <br/>
weapons for us when they see we lack in that department so all we can do is <br/>
complain and wait. Well must get back to EQ see if i can get back into hell <br/>
for the 3rd time and count the hours it will take me to get out.<br/>
<br/>
Later</div>
