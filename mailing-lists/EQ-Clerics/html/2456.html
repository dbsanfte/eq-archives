<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-865816296">Just so that everyone knows, playing on the Test Server does has its<br/>
pitfall.  For instance, just last night, everyone came back after a server<br/>
dump and everyone lost one item or another.  A lvl 38 druid friend of mine<br/>
lost everything she was wearing.  Most ppl either lost stuff in their<br/>
inventory, person, bank account, or ALL.  From what I understand from<br/>
talking to Test Server veterans who has been there over 4 months, this<br/>
occurs quit often and from the last time, they either didnt get their items<br/>
replace or didnt get all of them replace.  Basically, he says that he had to<br/>
restart with the items twice.<br/>
<br/>
Other things that can go wrong on Test is that some skills can get screw up<br/>
and not fix for quit awhile....for instance, druid&#39;s tracking.<br/>
<br/>
Also, it seems that more and more ppl are now coming over to Test...its<br/>
beginning to become just as crowded as a production server...so I don&#39;t know<br/>
if there will be as much advantages over the regular server.<br/>
<br/>
Just thought to let u guys know.<br/>
