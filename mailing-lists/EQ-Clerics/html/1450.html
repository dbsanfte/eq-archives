<div id="ygrps-yiv-93169010">I am a high elf cleric of Tunare and I had issues with<br/>
faction. I was dubious when i got there. I spent<br/>
several days raising my faction with the &quot;priests of<br/>
life&quot;. Killing gnolls does not do it. You actually<br/>
have to perform quests for the temple of life. The<br/>
actualy quest, once you can get it, is easy.<br/>
