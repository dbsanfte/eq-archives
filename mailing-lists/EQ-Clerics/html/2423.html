<div id="ygrps-yiv-476995370">First off, this is not a paladin board. Second off paladins and SK&#39;s have a<br/>
much better selection of equipment. Third, smithing is not that difficult<br/>
and I am GLAD that they are trying something different for a class that was<br/>
always wrought with powergamers looking for the next big ass sword of death.<br/>
Paladins werre supposed to be good, well liked, and a reason why they got<br/>
all those benefits. Not so they can kill gnomes or dwarves with impunity and<br/>
not worry about their &quot;goodness.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Without a protest, there armors were changed, fine.<br/>
<br/>
Lets review some other quests.<br/>
<br/>
A shaman comes over to Unrest, gets all three pieces he needs for these<br/>
areas (2 unrest, 1 Dragnor&#39;s Cauldron) in one night. ALSO, these monsters<br/>
and fighting groups are mostly of parity level so you can (GET THIS!!!)<br/>
Group AND get EXP!!!<br/>
<br/>
A Ranger&#39;s griffawn feather drops as easily as rain on the Karanas.<br/>
<br/>
You look around and See Paladin, ShodowKnight, Bard, Ranger, Shamen, Mages,<br/>
all with new gear. But you barely see ANY Cleric armor. (I finally saw one<br/>
person with cleric armor yesterday).<br/>
<br/>
Now lets look at a Cleric scenario...<br/>
<br/>
Before Kith became a death zone (RULE #1: careful what you wish for, you<br/>
just might get it) we all sat in the woods screaming for something to do.<br/>
Now we got it. but you would have to be a psycopath to sit in the kith now<br/>
for 8+ hours EACH PIECE.<br/>
<br/>
Before no one would sit around with a cleric for 16 hours plus with no EXP<br/>
and no money. So it is a solo sit match. I brought a book and read<br/>
&quot;Stalingrad&quot; for a weekend. ANY game where you have to sit online just to<br/>
burn time to &quot;hold&quot; a spot, is at the very least flawed.<br/>
<br/>
Now in Kith, you need a group 35-50 if you expect to live for the time<br/>
needed to do the quest.<br/>
<br/>
BILGE: Ah what a wonderful time for this MOB. No one will tell you where he<br/>
is or help you, due to the fact that all druids (with tracking) and Shamen<br/>
are also trying to kill him instantly for a shot at the belt or totem. AND<br/>
he spawns once a week. People usually get this item on a fluke, I know I<br/>
did.<br/>
<br/>
Sludge: Easy enough but no one wants to take a cleric down to a green<br/>
monster to let you kill it.<br/>
<br/>
GULL: Ah, I love this lil guy. A 17 hour spawn that takes you an hour to get<br/>
to where he is to find out, HE isn&#39;t there! JOY. &quot;Hey anyone want to travel<br/>
with me for an hour with no exp and barely any money just to see if Gull is<br/>
there?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Guk: Sit in a room for seven hours, good thing you didn&#39;t attack any<br/>
froggies. What? You did? better come back after 30th....to sit. No exp and<br/>
no coin.<br/>
<br/>
Babbinsbort: Pin the tail on the gnome! He is a rare 7 hour spawn which may<br/>
or may not show up in the seven hours. FEAR not! just sit and wait for a few<br/>
days until he does, no exp and no coin, and good luck trying to find someone<br/>
to sit around with you for no exp and no coin.<br/>
<br/>
Same goes for the Glacier Bear, Zahal, and Maugrim.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Cleric armor has the following flaws:<br/>
<br/>
Time consumption (Stump sit, MObs spawn very rare while in other zones other<br/>
classes mosters show every 5 minutes) with little or no reward, and no<br/>
social interaction.<br/>
<br/>
Weak AC for a class that gets whalloped after the second heal.<br/>
<br/>
Heavy Weight for a weight conscious class.<br/>
<br/>
Stat Add which add very little to our premium stat.<br/>
(it is my belief that stats adds give the best boneses to 85 or 100, and<br/>
therefore having pieces which help all stats will actualy help MORE than<br/>
having all have wis)<br/>
<br/>
I would be happy if any ONE of these things changes.<br/>
