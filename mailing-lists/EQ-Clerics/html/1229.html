<div id="ygrps-yiv-335849750">Come winter of 2000 I will be playing Never Winter Nights.<br/>
www.neverwinternight.net (or .com)<br/>
It&#39;s a DM-able Baldur&#39;s Gate style game that is fully customizable by<br/>
the host DM.  It&#39;s gonna blow EQ away in terms of flexibility and<br/>
playability.  Once this game comes out, I will never play EQ again.<br/>

&gt;I&#39;ve been reading on the EQ newsgroup that a good bit of ppl think EQ is<br/>
&gt;already starting to die.  Many are just bored of the game and are quiting <br/>
&gt;or<br/>
&gt;getting ready to, others are getting tired of Verant changing everything <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;some of it is for the worse.  I&#39;ve read where they are saying it&#39;s too late<br/>
&gt;to save EQ, some even say even the new addon will not save it cause it&#39;ll<br/>
&gt;still be the same game with just some new things.  And yeah it might spice<br/>
&gt;it up a bit, but for how long, I give it 3-4 months tops.  After 3-4 months<br/>
&gt;the power gamers will already have the extra lvls, everyone should have <br/>
&gt;been<br/>
&gt;in all the new zones, had a chance to play the new lizardman race.  So once<br/>
&gt;that happens it&#39;s gonna be right back to where it is now.<br/>
&gt;Some are waiting for Asheron&#39;s Call and others are waiting for Middle-Earth<br/>
&gt;to be released.  Will AC or ME finish off EQ?  I guess time will tell but<br/>
&gt;since theres like 3-4 other RPGs coming out by the year 2000 I say one of<br/>
&gt;them will put an end to EQ.  And if EQ does die to fast it&#39;s no ones fault<br/>
&gt;but Verants for not listening to the paying customers, they listen to a few<br/>
&gt;but not the whole.<br/>
&gt;Even tho EQ is a very good game it can&#39;t or won&#39;t be around forever.<br/>
