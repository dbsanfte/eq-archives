<b>Subject:</b> Re: EQ - worse rpg ever? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-500579368">The reasons all those situations exist is simple.  There is no other<br/>
way to get XP aside from killing monsters and finishing quests.  And<br/>
the quests, from what I&#39;ve seen, give jack for experience.  In a real<br/>
role-playing game, the DM could strip the Paladin of his status if he<br/>
abandoned his party.  That doesn&#39;t happen here.  Maybe EQ should<br/>
implement some kind of EBAY-style feedback system.  Group members<br/>
could give negative feedback to a character for doing something they<br/>
didn&#39;t like.  There were four of us in Crushbone fighting over by<br/>
the slaver pits.  We looked around and the bard was gone, completely.<br/>
I did a tell to find out where he was.  &quot;I went back to town to sell<br/>
some stuff.&quot;  Needless to say, I won&#39;t group with him again.  If there<br/>
was a way to give him a negative feedback rating, you can bet I would<br/>
have done it.  We all would have done it.  That way, any other<br/>
potential group could read his feedback and go, &quot;uh, maybe not.&quot;  And<br/>
he&#39;s doomed to a life of solo-ing.<br/>
<br/>
my two cents.<br/>

&gt;  I disagree whole- heartedly. I have played RPGs since the age of 8 (I am <br/>
&gt;26<br/>
&gt;now), and I have played many multi-player RPGs (when they were first <br/>
&gt;invented<br/>
&gt;around 1986 or so)  where roleplaying was great, and one of them was very<br/>
&gt;recent- a year ago to be exact. Of course there were questions where <br/>
&gt;someone<br/>
&gt;will ask what level you are or the monsters hit points, but there was also <br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt;great deal of roleplaying, so it didnt matter -  I have even  been OOC on<br/>
&gt;*more* then one occasionof times myself. But people were there because it <br/>
&gt;was<br/>
&gt;a different world to escape to. Norrath to me is an empty world.<br/>
&gt;   I have never been in a game where so many people ripped me off so they <br/>
&gt;can<br/>
&gt;get more money to buy that next cool item.  I can understand if your<br/>
&gt;character is a thief or some other mischievous being that follows a deity <br/>
&gt;of<br/>
&gt;that sort- but  how many times has this happened to you -<br/>
&gt;   1)  A  paladin left you for death while you were fighting off monsters- <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;he/she ran without thought of honor or disgrace - as what he would say to<br/>
&gt;explain the situation - &quot; I didnt want to  lose &quot; a half bar of <br/>
&gt;experience&#39;&#39;<br/>
&gt;   2) A  holy cleric  said to you &quot;It&#39;s a nosave lightstone&quot; in Kerra isle<br/>
&gt;(Before nosave lightstones were implemented in Kerra isle)<br/>
&gt;  3) A person following a deity of &#39;goodness&#39; loot every corpse in sight <br/>
&gt;even<br/>
&gt;though it wasnt his/her turn.<br/>
&gt;  4) A person diband your group to join another group for more &quot; <br/>
&gt;experience&#39;&quot;<br/>
&gt;rather then enjoying the moment of adventurers  for the cause of good<br/>
&gt;adventure.<br/>
&gt;  5)  A ranger or druid killing a bear, lion, elephant, etc - for &quot;exp or <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;increase my &#39;tailoring skill&#39; &quot;<br/>
&gt;  Etc, etc..the list goes on. I expected these things to happen, but I have<br/>
&gt;never met a single perons in EQ that actually tried  to adhere to their<br/>
&gt;character.  The world of EQ is full of greed and who can be the next &#39;<br/>
&gt;coolest high level character&#39;.<br/>
