<div id="ygrps-yiv-1011544045">well, me personally, i think it&#39;s channelling that helps you recover from being hit and still<br/>
casting.....i could be wrong, but i believe that&#39;s what it is....also, later on, it&#39;s<br/>
important to have as much mana as you can, so i&#39;d invest in wis adding items......believe me,<br/>
that can go along way....for example, i died today &lt;yeah i know i&#39;m not supposed to do that,<br/>
but it happens&gt;....well, when i got back and looted my corpse, from all the wis adding items<br/>
i have, it gave me 2 extra bars of mana....base wis 95 and with items, 138....this was on lv<br/>
40, so it does make a difference<br/>

&gt; I have question to you fellow clerics that would like to have a clear answer to. The<br/>
&gt; question is that does dexterity effect in spellcasting any way? Does it make us<br/>
&gt; to recover from mobs interrupting our spellcasting better? I have heard some<br/>
&gt; clerics claim this. I have a dex of 98 and i do find it quite often that even if critters<br/>
&gt; hit me HARD i am able to cast a healing spell. I have even gated several times<br/>
&gt; out from a heated battle while being hit for a total of 70 dmg.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just thinking if buying those jewellery craft items that raise dex are worth it :)<br/>
