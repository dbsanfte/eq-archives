<div id="ygrps-yiv-1485051809">Instead of going to befallen at 15 you should go to unrest.  I was 14 when i<br/>
went to unrest and am now 22.  I solo more than I group..  I take on yellow<br/>
undead with the utmost of ease and have occasionally soloed reds.  Maybe I&#39;m<br/>
just lucky, but after doing it for most of my char&#39;s life, I really doubt<br/>
it.</div>
