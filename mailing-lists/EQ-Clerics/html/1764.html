<b>Subject:</b> Divine aura or divine barrier <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-867378867">I just reached level 29 and tested divine barrier. I am a bit disappointed. <br/>
I noticed that divine barrier lasts for around 22 secs while divine aura <br/>
lasts for some 20 secs. Divine barrier also restores some HPs, I was <br/>
standing and noticed around 50 hit points regenerated.<br/>
<br/>
But 100 mana!?! That is a lot of mana in an emergency. Can the rest of you <br/>
clerics please give me advice. What do you prefer to use after level 29?<br/>
