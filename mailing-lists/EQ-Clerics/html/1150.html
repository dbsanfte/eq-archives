<div id="ygrps-yiv-2005458667">You are wrong. Divine Aura and Barrier are awesome. I can&#39;t count the times <br/>
they have saved me. Let me try to explain this. We are in lower guk fighting <br/>
Mino&#39;s and Froggies. Our tank gets a bad pull and pulls 4 or 5 things. Or <br/>
another group has a couple. I know as soon as I cast a heal every single <br/>
creature that isn&#39;t being attacked is Aggro to me and will come to beat the <br/>
crap out of me. Now your tanks will not be able to pull all these creatures <br/>
off you fast enough. So I just cast Divine Aura. It is amazing how fast they <br/>
stop trying to hit me when they know they are doing no damage. Now if you are <br/>
trying to zone. granted you will get stunned and never make it to zone. IE <br/>
unrest<br/>

&lt;&lt; I had always assumed that the stun during Divine Aura was a bug and not to <br/>
 maintain balance.  I thought the balance was kept by this spell in that it <br/>
 could only be used once every 15 minutes.  Even if you die and have to <br/>
 rememorize it, you still have to wait the 15 minutes to use it again.  If <br/>
 this stun thing isn&#39;t a bug, then I probably won&#39;t use this spell more.  I <br/>
 hardly use it now as it is since the only time I really need it is if I&#39;m <br/>
 going to die and I have no hope of running since I&#39;m so low on life anyways. <br/>
