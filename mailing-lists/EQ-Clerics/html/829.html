<div id="ygrps-yiv-1147107842">Good point.  We agree the low levels should be curbed from getting there,<br/>
the how is left for some debate.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You feel a sense of foreboding as you approach the gate.  You feel you can<br/>
go no further.&quot;   Good enough...<br/>
<br/>
Still, I think something should occur if you move into another dimension.<br/>
Its not like passing from North to South Karana after all...<br/>
<br/>
And more along the topic of clerics, the gate damage would mean more groups<br/>
would need us clerics to go with them, right?<br/>
Sounds to me like job security!<br/>

	I think what would be better if it could be done is have the gate<br/>
setup to<br/>
	where you HAVE to be a certin Lvl to get in, say you should be lvl<br/>
35 to get<br/>
	in if you&#39;re not at least Lvl 35 the gate kicks you back out.  Plus<br/>
if this<br/>
	Plane of Fear is suppose to be so hard then why not have the zone<br/>
before it<br/>
	harder so these low lvl players can&#39;t even get close to it?<br/>
