<div id="ygrps-yiv-1790965172">I am level 15 as well, and I actually have both a SSOL and a<br/>
bloodforge hammer.  Most of the time I like to use my hammer because<br/>
I like the sound of &#39;crunch&#39; that it makes when it hits for 25.  I<br/>
switch to the SSOL and my SBS when I am fighting spell-casters and<br/>
need the extra speed to interrupt their casting, and cleansing myself<br/>
is nice, too.<br/>
  So, bottom-line is, if you make the trip to Qeynos, do the SSOL<br/>
quest (real handy to read the quest first, as it involves Rivervale),<br/>
and pick up Trumpy Irontoe&#39;s head while you&#39;re at it so that you can<br/>
pick up a bloodforge hammer.  Trumpy&#39;s head is nodrop so if your<br/>
dwarf faction isn&#39;t amiably, too, you might have to wag his head<br/>
around for a while until you get it there.<br/>
<br/>
  On that note, the orc belt quest is an incredibly good quest to<br/>
raise the dwarven faction.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &lt;slight spoiler warning&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I think the important thing to remember about the SSOL is that it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; a fairly low-level item.  Most clerics will toss it once they get a<br/>
&gt; &gt; screaming mace, or a BEM, or gem-encrusted scepter.  Because the quest<br/>
&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t involves only killing bixies in Rivervale you can do this<br/>
&gt; &gt; quest at an extremely low level.  I did the blessed oil quest over<br/>
&gt; &gt; and over again.  It took me about 15 times or more of doing this.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; am a high elf, and I think I was apprehensive when I started.  Maybe<br/>
&gt; &gt; dubious, I don&#39;t remember.  You have to get well into amiably to get<br/>
&gt; &gt; the quest.<br/>
&gt; &gt;   Another really good quest that I&#39;m doing now in my spare time is the<br/>
&gt; &gt; diseased wolf quest.  You can kill rabid wolves and rabid grizzlies<br/>
&gt; &gt; in Qeynos hills and give the pelts to Priestess Caulria in the UFO.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I turned in 4 wolf pelts and 1 grizzly pelt, got a plat for the<br/>
&gt; &gt; grizzly pelt, and &#39;endure disease&#39; a 14th level spell (which you can<br/>
&gt; &gt; buy for 4 plat, or sell for 6-7 gold).  I turned in these pelts, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; at 15th level, I got nearly a half a bar of experience.  Not bad<br/>
&gt; &gt; considering 90% of rabid wolves die with one smite spell.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;Our guildmaster, who is a paladin, just recently needed to raise his<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;faction<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;with the priests of Life, in order to obtain his soulfire sword.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Basically what we did to help raise his faction was:<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;1) killing putrid skellies in South Karana(at Grimrots Camp)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;2) Turning in diseased animal pelts to the Temple of Life<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;3) Doing the Blessed oil Quest til he turned green<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;These will all raise your faction there. Even I, a person who <br/>
&gt;originally<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;came from the temple of Life, needed to raise my faction in order to do<br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;quest. But to be quite honest, I did the quest simply cause I had never<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;done<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;a quest before, I tried the weapon out like once to see what the effect<br/>
&gt;was<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;and it has sat in the bank ever since.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;I keep reading that everyone on here loves to use there SSOL.  I would<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;like<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;to get this weapon as well.  I am a human cleric from the Temple of <br/>
&gt;Marr<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Freeport.  Will i have problems trying to do the quest, or will i be <br/>
&gt;ok?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Just want to make sure, before I make that loooong journy from <br/>
&gt;freeport<br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;qeynos.  Thanks<br/>
