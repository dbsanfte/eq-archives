<div id="ygrps-yiv-502679436">Heh, I just knew I would get some kind of question about this.<br/>
Debated as to whether I should have included in my original question.<br/>
:)  The shortcut is this :<br/>
<br/>
When you zone into West Karana from North Karana along the river&#39;s<br/>
edge, swim into the river and go underwater and go to the zone edge,<br/>
(I&#39;m not sure if going to the zone edge is necessary, but I do) and<br/>
then swim to the left like you are trying to zone back into North<br/>
Karana.  You will get a message :<br/>
&quot;Player is beneath the world at (some location) transporting to a safe<br/>
location.&quot;  It might also be necessary to go to the bottom of the<br/>
river, which I usually do as well.<br/>
<br/>
And you will end up at the Stone marker just inside the zone near<br/>
where Brother Trintle spawns.  From there, it is just a hop, skip and<br/>
a jump to Qeynos hills - and you bypassed having to cross the entire<br/>
zone, or at least the vast majority of it.<br/>
