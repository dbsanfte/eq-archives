<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1785800675">These places can be very tough, but when I was in level 35 I was getting<br/>
mega XP in Lower guk and in SolusekB.  Have to of course be in a good group<br/>
for both, as those places can get out of hand easily.<br/>
   In Lower Guk, you can hunt in the bedroom, undead side.  In Sol B I would<br/>
reccomend hunting right near one of the zones to Sol A, there are 3 I<br/>
believe.  Don&#39;t fight at the main zone to Lavastorm that is train central<br/>
and you will get some pretty nasty stuff there.  Both of these dungeons are<br/>
really crowded most of the time, when I was 35 it wasn&#39;t to bad, so I don&#39;t<br/>
know how bad fighting for spawns would be now.<br/>
<br/>
You can also see about getting into a Avatar room group in Cazic.  Perhaps<br/>
Deepwater Goblins and Spectres in Oasis and Spectres in Feerott.<br/>
<br/>
These are the places I remember being in that level area i hope this helps<br/>
<br/>
But hell levels are going to take awhile to get through especially if you<br/>
don&#39;t have a lot of time to play often.   The fastest I have seen anyone get<br/>
through 35 was 3 days and that was with playing constantly ( he wasn&#39;t<br/>
working at te time and was home all day). Then on the other hand it took our<br/>
group Paladin I think a month of playing each night and a lot of the<br/>
weekends to get through 35.<br/>

&gt; I have been stuck on level 35 for years now... (ok a slight exageration..)<br/>
&gt; Someone told me that the specs in Feerrot was a good spot to get out of<br/>
this<br/>
&gt; level... I just spent 4 hours in Kith with a group and only got 25% of a<br/>
&gt; bbl. We where fighting many different things including reds...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A few ppl in my group told me they ended up having to solo to get out of<br/>
&gt; this level with any type of speed...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Any insight would be appreciated.<br/>
