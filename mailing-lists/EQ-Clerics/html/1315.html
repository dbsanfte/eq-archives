<div id="ygrps-yiv-1122503715">Can everyone watch out for long replies? Right before you post a Re:<br/>
message, scroll down the message you are sending and trim the copied message<br/>
at the bottom. It seems some people are copying all of a digest into a<br/>
reply, and its really making the list hard to read. And also, make sure<br/>
messages you are replying to are &quot;marked&quot;. Example:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;From:<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:somebody@...">somebody@...</a><br/>
&gt;Title: Blah blah<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Can someone tell me some mailing list courtesy?<br/>
&gt; thanks, <br/>

 </span></blockquote>The &quot;&gt;&quot;s make it easy to skip old messages. Its worth the few extra seconds,<br/>
and often your email software can do it automatically. Thanks,<br/>
