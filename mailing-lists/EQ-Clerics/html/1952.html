<div id="ygrps-yiv-338367260">I see where you are going with this.... Ok, so if I want to spend the<br/>
whole game using my trade skill, I could do that, I suppose.... I&#39;d<br/>
rather hunt and get items, and explore, etc....  But I see your point.<br/>
I guess my assumption was that this was done during the normal course<br/>
of activities.  Ok, so if I wanted to spend all day long on smithing<br/>
or pottery, or hell, even fishing, then I guess I could do that.<br/>
<br/>
  Well, I&#39;m on the test server, and with 300 people, I&#39;m not sure I<br/>
could really make that much money.  Besides, it&#39;s more a family-type<br/>
community there, and people tend to give things away, more than sell<br/>
them.  At least I do.  Like giving away my Shining Star of Light....<br/>

&gt; &gt;What do you mean, in an intelligent manner?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Have ye ever considered starting a trade business of some kind?  Perhaps<br/>
&gt;running errands for other players?  Smithing, Jewelcrafting, things that<br/>
&gt;you recycle your money into that will yeild more than what ye started with? </span></blockquote></div>
