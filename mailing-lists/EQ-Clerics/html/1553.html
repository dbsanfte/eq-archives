<div id="ygrps-yiv-1589125576">just so you KNOW why this is people...and he IS right....it will save much<br/>
more than GAMES!!! This lil puppy will go and detect when you are &quot;idle&quot;<br/>
and at such deemed times will then INDEX your whole frigging hard drive.<br/>
Idle times can be ANY times the hard drive is not active.....it can be<br/>
random times during the day....it can be any time the program basically<br/>
deems not enough activity is going on....and sometimes this is when games<br/>
have loaded everything into memory and are not bothering to touch the hard<br/>
drive. the loading constantly causes your slow down ALOT.<br/>

One other game killer you should remove - MS Find Fast!  This gets installed<br/>
by default with Office, and you cannot do yourself a bigger favor than<br/>
removing it.<br/>

&gt; If your lag meter is fine, but you&#39;re getting pauses like this,<br/>
&gt; it points to<br/>
&gt; your PC config.<br/>
&gt; A few things to try:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1. Do you have a resident virus checker and what are its<br/>
&gt; settings? Or do you<br/>
&gt; have some other kind of scheduled CPU/disk/memory hog?<br/>
&gt; 2. Do you have IPX drivers installed? I used to get a bad pausing<br/>
&gt; problem in<br/>
&gt; all games. It went away when I uninstalled the IPX drivers (I<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t really<br/>
&gt; need them and you probably don&#39;t unless you run on an old Netware<br/>
&gt; network).<br/>
&gt; 3. Before you run EQ, reboot and clear your taskbar of resident stuff.<br/>
