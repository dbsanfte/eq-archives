<div id="ygrps-yiv-612265139">I think 14th level spells are like 7 plat apiece.  Or thereabouts.<br/>
You will want to buy:<br/>
healing<br/>
smite<br/>
bind affinity<br/>
expulse undead<br/>
invisibility to undead (it&#39;s really cheap, anyway)<br/>
cancel magic<br/>
and symbol of transal (+hp buff)<br/>
<br/>
Symbol of Transal will require cat&#39;s eye agates to cast.  They are<br/>
2gp apiece.  So, pick up a few of those as well.  Your group members<br/>
will thank you for this buff.<br/>
<br/>
The less useful spells are halo of light, endure disease and endure<br/>
cold.<br/>
<br/>
As a side note, if you turn in a rabid grizzly pelt to Priestess<br/>
Caulria in N. Qeynos, she will give you endure disease (a 7 plat<br/>
value)<br/>

&gt;I too should be making 14 some time soon, and was wondering how much it&#39;s <br/>
&gt;going to cost to buy all the needed spells.  I&#39;ve got about 40 pp in the <br/>
&gt;bank, and am wearing all leather.  Will this be enough cash and what spells <br/>
&gt;should be purchased first?<br/>

&gt;I should be making 14 later this week and would like to know what spells <br/>
&gt;are<br/>
&gt;best to get first.   As you all are aware money is a definite problem at<br/>
&gt;this level.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I had a wonderful week as far as donations to my equipment goes.  I was<br/>
&gt;given a banded tunic and a blackened neck guard plus getting rawhide gloves<br/>
&gt;from a zombie really helped.  A few lootings of ghouls has also helped my<br/>
&gt;bank account a lot.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am still having trouble finding groups at times but so far with only one<br/>
&gt;exception I have not lost a party member yet.  The only exception was an<br/>
&gt;ill-fated venture into Oasis when I was still 11th.  I really think that<br/>
&gt;upon making 14 I will head back to GFay.  I have nothing against Freeport<br/>
&gt;and EC but I think the humans are all jealous of us elves. (grins)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks again all,<br/>
