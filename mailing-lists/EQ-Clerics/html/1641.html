<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-738719851">Sianne, the manastone is the rare drop off the Evil Eye on the live side of<br/>
LGuk.  Its normal drop is the Evil Eye bag, an 8 slot, 70 - 75% weight<br/>
reduction item that is lore (one bag per person but you can sell/trade it).<br/>
You get to the live side by going through a door which is by the gargoyles<br/>
at the bridge in LGuk.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t go down there without a strong group of 40+.  You have to go into<br/>
a pit, and it can get ugly.<br/>
