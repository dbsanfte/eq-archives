<div id="ygrps-yiv-2084012793">Hi all.  I don&#39;t want to be spoiled, just nudged =)  The very first cleric <br/>
quest where it is my duty to refresh the sentries of the Temple of Marr <br/>
still haunts me.  I went to the ocean of tears to search for the remaining <br/>
sentry and retreated as I saw the island FULL of goblins.  I am not a bit <br/>
higher in level and decided to complete this quest.  Is she out there? or is <br/>
the quest broken?<br/>
<br/>
btw: Sailing in the OOT, I went West (as I recall) and seemed to be headed <br/>
toward Kaladim, am I recalling wrong, or is something messed up besides me? <br/>
