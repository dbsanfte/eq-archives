<div id="ygrps-yiv-1243243015">Does anyone out there have a list of the cleric spells and what they do?  I <br/>
would really love to get that.  Even though it spoils the fun of seeing what <br/>
a new spell can do, I would at least like to have an idea of what it does <br/>
before I spend 15pp on it.  <br/>
