<div id="ygrps-yiv-1586910597">I have no idea on rez, never had rez casted on my or seen it casted on<br/>
anyone yet.  Who knows I might be Lvl 20 by the end of next week and have my<br/>
last name and so cooler spells.  I&#39;m luck to have half of Lvl 15, got killed<br/>
two times by mino&#39;s today.  Both times I got jumped by two Mino&#39;s at the<br/>
same time and couldn&#39;t get away or get help in time.  Hope that doesn&#39;t<br/>
happen again for a long time.  But good luck on get Lvl 40!<br/>

&gt; no lev 2 rez is supposed to give you i think at least half of what you got<br/>
&gt; back....lv 3 is supposed to give you almost all of what you lost back<br/>
