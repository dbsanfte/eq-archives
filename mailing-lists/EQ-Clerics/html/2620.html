<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-68134580">where i am hunting now and have been since 24 is between a few spots, all in <br/>
same area, rth mts-great exp-solo or group for giant skullys-also group for <br/>
cyclopes-excellent exp........aviack city-always decent exp <br/>
here.........paw-outside-wonderful exp here-grouped with at least 2 others, <br/>
the outside is great exp also-inside go ot in a full group and WITH <br/>
tanks.......i am finding it easy to do paw in its various spots, LOL but i <br/>
do tend to stay outside as inside scares lvl 40&#39;s sometimes.....Clerics are <br/>
always a welcome addition in these place so you should have no trouble <br/>
getting into a group...one for place in rth mts is the ruins, not by the <br/>
tower but the other ruins-very goos exp there........<br/>

&gt; &gt;friends all want to do Cazic Thule, but I find it so incredibly<br/>
&gt; &gt;boring.  I was thinking Unrest, but I have so many bad memories of<br/>
&gt; &gt;such bad trains there.  Seems like Runnyeye might be good, but not too<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I found that unrest was very good for me up until about 26... at which <br/>
&gt;point<br/>
&gt;I went to Cazic until I was around 32 or so...  If Cazic is boring then you<br/>
&gt;are doing somethin wrong because there is usually a LOT of action there...<br/>
&gt;sometimes too much =)   I certainly don&#39;t think it&#39;s any more boring than<br/>
&gt;any other zone.   Unrest trains can be bad, but<br/>
&gt;the best way to level there is to join a group in a room in a house and <br/>
&gt;once<br/>
&gt;you are settled in a room (I leveled up to 26 fairly quickly in the hand<br/>
&gt;room) there are usually no trains.  Every zone is bad with trains if you <br/>
&gt;try<br/>
&gt;to fight in the first open area you come to near the zone.  Also, when you<br/>
&gt;get in high 20&#39;s, low 30&#39;s I know a GREAT place to level.  I almost hate to<br/>
&gt;say anything for fear of a terrific (if a little boring) spot geting over<br/>
&gt;crowded... but the icy orc camp in everfrost is a very safe place to group<br/>
&gt;with excellent xp.  I didn&#39;t find this place until level 33 and leveld to <br/>
&gt;35<br/>
&gt;in 2 days there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;  Paw and Mistmoore are still too high/tough.  I heard Sol A might be<br/>
&gt; &gt;good, but I&#39;ve never been to Lavastorm, and worry about falling into<br/>
&gt; &gt;lava as I&#39;ve heard you&#39;re oft to do when zoning into the place.  Maybe<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Paw and MM are too tough as you said... Sol A is ok if you get a good <br/>
&gt;group,<br/>
&gt;but I&#39;d get a couple more levels first.  As for zoning into lava, i&#39;ve <br/>
&gt;never<br/>
&gt;heard that nor have I ever seen that... the lava is no where near the zone<br/>
&gt;of nektulos/lavastorm... (though there is a huge pit right out side the <br/>
&gt;zone<br/>
&gt;to Sol A and Sol B)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;the giant skels in Rathe mountains?  Maybe pickclaws in highkeep?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;pickclaws are very good at your level, but that area tends to be HORRIBLY<br/>
&gt;crowded (at least on my server) and you are very lucky if you can even get<br/>
&gt;in a group there.<br/>
