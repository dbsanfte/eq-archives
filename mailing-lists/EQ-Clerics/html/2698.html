 </span></blockquote>I really honestly do not think so.  I play a high elf<br/>
cleric and I have kept up with my regular group since<br/>
I started her (she just hit 45.)  We all spend the<br/>
same amount of time playing too, since we all work<br/>
pretty much the same schedules.  I had assumed that<br/>
they leveled slower also.  I realized it was just<br/>
becuase we died more.  Healing is, in essence, one<br/>
hell of a taunt.  The more you heal, the more the mob<br/>
will hate you and the harder it is for the tank to<br/>
taunt it off you.  Since I passed up alot of AC items<br/>
for wisdom items, i tend to fall fast.  Even with all<br/>
the dying my cleric does, she keeps up just fine.<br/>
