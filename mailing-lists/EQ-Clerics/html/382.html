True, but how much of a tank/solo class is a cleric compared to a paladin?<br/>
And if there were to be a cleric super-weapon, would it be 1h or 2h?  I know<br/>
personally I&#39;d want 1h mace or hammer, but there are plenty of people who&#39;d<br/>
want a nice 2h staff.<br/>
&lt;/devil&#39;s advocate&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That aside, I agree, I&#39;ve not found much in the way of a 1h blunt weapon<br/>
that does more than 9 dmg, and certainly none that have those sort of side<br/>
benefits.  I know I&#39;d love to have a weapon that alone just added another 7<br/>
wis to my character.  I&#39;ve just read on EQ&#39;Lizer that &quot;two or three&quot;<br/>
paladins already have them, and they&#39;re about lv 18.  That screams to me<br/>
that either the game balance is about to be completely upended by a single<br/>
weapon (just my opinion from seeing the same sort of weapon implementation<br/>
on MUDs that I played), or that they&#39;re going to get something even better<br/>
that takes a higher level to accomplish the quest.  All in all, I agree, I&#39;d<br/>
like to see some more powerful 1h blunt, something with more than 9dmg<br/>
(maybe there is something like that, I just haven&#39;t heard about it yet).<br/>

&gt; The Soul Fire Sword is Charges 5, 2HD Slashing, ATK Delay 45, DMG 23, STR<br/>
&gt; +7, WIS +7, Effect: Complete Healing, WT 5.0 Class Pal.<br/>
&gt; Thats not fair, Clerics should get something like this but instade of<br/>
sword<br/>
&gt; it can be a mace or hammer or a staff.<br/>
