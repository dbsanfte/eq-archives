 </span></blockquote>Either you or I have read it wrong. By my way of looking at it, this will<br/>
leave more corpses lying around. When someone is ressurected, they loot<br/>
their corpse and it disappears. If they aren&#39;t ressurected, they take longer<br/>
to get to their corpse (presumably, unless they are standing next to it and<br/>
only doing to regain exp) and so the corpse stays around longer, continuing<br/>
to clutter your view.<br/>
