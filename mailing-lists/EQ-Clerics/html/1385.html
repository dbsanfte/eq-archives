<div id="ygrps-yiv-1402761518">I&#39;m just about to hit level 24 (woohoo new spells!) and was wondering<br/>
about the &#39;Wave of Fear&#39; spell at the new spell level.  Looking at the<br/>
description, it looks like it could be a party saver: things start going<br/>
badly, 2 or more party members drop below 1.5 bars of health and only enough<br/>
mana for one more healing spell - OR - I could jump into the fray, cast wave<br/>
of fear, and have lots of the attacking nasties flee in terror as the group<br/>
hoofs it for the zone.  Do those of you who have this spell find yourself<br/>
using it in this way, or is it not effective enough for this sort of thing?<br/>
