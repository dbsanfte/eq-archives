&gt; I have been stuck on level 35 for years now... (ok a slight exageration..)<br/>
&gt; Someone told me that the specs in Feerrot was a good spot to get out of this<br/>
&gt; level... I just spent 4 hours in Kith with a group and only got 25% of a<br/>
&gt; bbl. We where fighting many different things including reds...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A few ppl in my group told me they ended up having to solo to get out of<br/>
&gt; this level with any type of speed...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Any insight would be appreciated.<br/>
<br/>

B, Kings room if I managed to get into the group there (which being a<br/>
cleric wasn&#39;t actually that hard.. our server works on a waiting list..<br/>
however it seems to have two sections.. clerics and others.. :)<br/>
<br/>
Okay your going to be grouping with lvl 35-50&#39;s.. but you can get<br/>
through a lot of Kobolds in that time and you have a good chance of<br/>
picking up a pair of Runed Mithril Bracers (+5 wis +3 str AC 4).  Which<br/>
is nice.. :)<br/>
