<div id="ygrps-yiv-1834655663">RE: [EQ-Clerics] Lvls After Expansion PakYeah it might be fair for them to gain Lvls with the exp they&#39;ve gained BUT if they had enough exp to max the cap again you know a lot would throw a fit saying it wasn&#39;t fair at all.  I know I wouldn&#39;t want to max out my Lvl cap before the pak is released if I were already on Lvl 50 by then.  But yeah allowing them to gain a few Lvls might be good, say go from 50 to 53 or 54 tops.  Guess we&#39;ll find out by March 16th, 2000<br/>

  personally....i would say they should get credit for the exp they&#39;ve gained after.  if it changes color it sounds like its going through making it harder each time for the exp to gain....which is exactly what happens to us in lvls....so its fair if they jumped to 53 or 60 etc.<br/>

   <br/>
  And just for your knowledge....i used to play a few muds....on one...called MajorMud, when this same problem came up.....people didnt shoot up ten lvls....they shot up about 2 maybe 3....and this was after MONTHS of work.  They made sure it didnt happen, because an extreme unbalance can happen.</div>
