<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1268910663">&lt;I read on the EQ &quot;official&quot; website that on the test server - If a party<br/>
member goes link-dead, the remaining members will be notified.   Yayayaya -<br/>
that is one change I would NOT mind Verant making!&gt;<br/>
  <br/>
This has been published on the production/live servers as well.  Last<br/>
night, after a particularly brutal match with 2 dars in Lguk, my only other<br/>
party member went linkdead, and the system told me as such.  Boy, it was a<br/>
harrowing 3 minutes until he got back =)<br/>
