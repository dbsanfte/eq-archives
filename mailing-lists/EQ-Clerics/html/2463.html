<b>Subject:</b> places to solo <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-800407139">Is there a good place to solo for a cleric (myself, namely &lt;g&gt;) at<br/>
level 22?  DW crocs and caimans are still blue, but those are fairly<br/>
camped, and I noticed that one was green to me the other day, so they<br/>
are not ideal.  I can&#39;t think of any place else where I would get xp,<br/>
or that would be solo-able.<br/>
<br/>
thanks</div>
