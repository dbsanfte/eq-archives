<div id="ygrps-yiv-1932201527">I rarely cast offensive spells. Yes, it&#39;s fun. Yes, I am tempted to. Resist<br/>
that temptation!<br/>
<br/>
There are many reasons not to cast offensive spells. First, we are only<br/>
mediocre at them, except against the dead. If your group needs offensive<br/>
spells, go to the source: get a wizard.<br/>
<br/>
Second, they drain our mana for healing and buffing, which we are the very<br/>
best of any class at. Why hurt your most valuable ability? It&#39;s like a<br/>
fighter discarding his sword. (If you really enjoy healing and buffing less<br/>
than fighting, or offense spell casting, then you don&#39;t want to be a cleric.<br/>
Delete the character, and start a tank or a wizard.)<br/>
<br/>
Third, you DON&#39;T want to be the member of your group who does the most<br/>
damage. That just focuses the mob&#39;s attack onto you, and then you&#39;re really<br/>
in trouble: all your spells, healing included, get disrupted, and you&#39;re<br/>
probably getting hurt worse than the tanks, who get better Defense and Dodge<br/>
skills, have higher AC because of their higher Defense, and may even have<br/>
better armor because they have not had to spend half their income on spells,<br/>
as you have :-(. Now the tanks have to drag the mob off you, and they&#39;re not<br/>
getting healed. They won&#39;t appreciate you very much, and with good reason!<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I do cast offensive spells occasionally. When I am soloing, which is<br/>
maybe 15 to 20 percent of the time. And when a critter is fleeing, the tanks<br/>
can&#39;t keep up with it, and it looks like it might be running into an area<br/>
where it will bring other mobs into the battle. For example, an injured<br/>
ghoul running back into the house in Unrest, or a froglok running back into<br/>
the mazes of Guk. Uh-oh! Expulse Undead on that ghoul *now*, and Smite the<br/>
froglok, or you will have a mess of higher level mobs in your face. But<br/>
those are about the only times.<br/>
<br/>
My play style: when the puller brings the mob, I jump in with the tanks and<br/>
start hitting. I do NOT cast. If the tanks are getting hurt, I pull back and<br/>
heal. If *I* am getting hurt, I pull back and heal. I can do a lot more<br/>
damage to the mob by healing my tanks, than by any offensive spell I can<br/>
cast. If no one is getting hurt, I keep on whacking at the mob.<br/>
<br/>
Think about it this way: If you spend the mana to heal a tank from, say half<br/>
health to full, how much damage can he do in the time it takes the mob to<br/>
knock him back to half health again? It&#39;s a LOT more than a cleric could<br/>
have done, if he had used the same amount of mana to cast an offensive<br/>
spell. Although that damage was done by the tank, part of it belongs to you,<br/>
because it would not have happened without you. That tank would have been<br/>
dead or running. In my experience, virtually all tanks realize this, and are<br/>
grateful to their clerics. So what if your staff or your mace is doing a lot<br/>
less damage than the tanks&#39; weapons, and connecting less often?<br/>
<br/>
EQ works best, and is the most fun, when every class does what it is best<br/>
at. For us, that is healing and buffing. If you really want to cast<br/>
offensive spells, be a wizard. If you want to bash, be a tank. Yes, I enjoy<br/>
whacking away with my runed totem staff, but that&#39;s not my real job. My real<br/>
job is that of a healer and protector, and that&#39;s what I save my mana for. I<br/>
get tremendous satisfaction out of knowing that at the end of the evening,<br/>
we were able to kill mobs a level or two higher than we would have if I had<br/>
not been present, and get better loot and better xp, and that no one died.<br/>
That&#39;s enough for me.<br/>

&gt;Hi. I&#39;m new to this mail group but thought I would put in my 2cents here. I<br/>
&gt;am a level 10 High Elf Cleric on the Rodcet Nife server. I regularly group<br/>
&gt;with a Paladin and a Wizard. They know better than to tell me that my only<br/>
&gt;job is to sit back and heal. I jump right in with them and watch their<br/>
&gt;health rather intently. If I see that they need my services, I back out,<br/>
&gt;heal them and then get right back in. I don&#39;t tank as the Paladin enjoys<br/>
&gt;doing that herself. I will often times use that little strike spell to get<br/>
&gt;the targets attention. My attack isn&#39;t all that great but at least I feel I<br/>
&gt;contribute more than just an occasional healing spell or buff to the group.<br/>
&gt;No one has complained yet.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;&gt;Just wanted to open a discussion on Clerics who love to fight.  I am<br/>
&gt;&gt;happy being a cleric, but I cannot resist jumping into the heat of a<br/>
&gt;&gt;battle and kicking some back.  I also like to occassionally tank.  I try<br/>
&gt;&gt;to save all my mana for healing, but sometimes I just love to blast<br/>
&gt;&gt;away.  This is probably because I feel useless when grouped as my<br/>
&gt;&gt;regular attack doesn&#39;t compare to others in the group.  Anyone else feel<br/>
&gt;&gt;this way?  Any experiences to share?<br/>
