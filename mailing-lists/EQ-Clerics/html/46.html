<div id="ygrps-yiv-833663366">Hiya!  Symbol of Transal is expensive to use, it uses a cat&#39;s eye agate<br/>
which is around 2.5 gold.  Although I do use it, it&#39;s mainly for when I am<br/>
soloing.  Also, smite is a good spell.  It does around 74 damage but is slow<br/>
to cast and and is quite a mana sucker.  I use that mainly for sticky<br/>
situations and when I&#39;m soloing a tougher critter.  I also use it as a<br/>
taunt, mainly to get the critter off one of my damaged group members.  Most<br/>
creatures do not like getting hurt and go after the one who hurts them most.<br/>
I still keep furor memorized also and use that for finishing off a runner.<br/>
Healing is a must, but light healing is still always kept at my side for<br/>
when either myself or a group member needs a little health boost.  Cancel<br/>
magic will remove root and charm, but caution is needed when using it,<br/>
mainly because it will cancel buffs also.  I&#39;ve had to rebuff my group many<br/>
times when I accidentally canceled magic on them after the root/charm had<br/>
already wore off!<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps some!<br/>

&gt;Hello all,<br/>
&gt;I just made 14 recently and wonder if you can help me out with spells.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Any recommendations for 14 lvl spells beside heal and bind?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve been thinking about Halo of Light because I hate the dark but<br/>
&gt;I dont want to spend 7pp on something that a lantern does. Does it really<br/>
&gt;help to see around you when your in the dark or is just in the immediate<br/>

&gt;Can you explain how cancel magic works? Does it remove the negative effects<br/>
&gt;of spells on people?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;How much HP does Symbol of Transal add and what item do you need for it?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The Endure Cold and Endure Disease spells seem pretty useless to me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks for help,<br/>
