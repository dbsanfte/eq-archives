<div id="ygrps-yiv-812867419">I have mostly ringmail and banded with leather boots and armbands<br/>
(mostly because of the weight limits of a strength of 75).  But my<br/>
small ringmail shirt is ac 12 and someone wanted me to wear a lockjaw<br/>
hide vest that they had acquired.  The ac was the same, but the vest<br/>
gave me a +5 to my stamina (not that I care), but I chose not to wear<br/>
it and keep my ringmail because the vest looked like leather and I<br/>
prefered the look of the ringmail, +5 stamina or not.  :)<br/>

&gt;   I am not sure if this is vanity or what, but I sure like the way my <br/>
&gt;female<br/>
&gt;high elf looks in her leather armor.  I may just keep it for traveling<br/>
&gt;clothes like you say when I start getting some better stuff.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;Well, you are in the wrong class if you are big on looks my friend, <br/>
&gt;until<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;you can get to PoF and get the Mist Armor.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;m not too sure I agree with this.  With the options of storebought<br/>
&gt;Steel,<br/>
&gt; &gt; Rubicite and Mithril, you can come up with a very nice looking outfit <br/>
&gt;for<br/>
&gt; &gt; travelling and social occasions.  Although I&#39;d like to obtain Mist Armor<br/>
&gt; &gt; myself, it&#39;s just not feasible at this time.  However, you can be as <br/>
&gt;vain<br/>
&gt; &gt; (I&#39;m very aware of how my character appears), as any other class.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;You wanna be a good cleric? Mostly likely the answer is yes.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Then you will look like a newbie.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Absolutely, during times of battle you will look like a nightmarish<br/>
&gt; &gt; hodgepodge.  However, outside of battle you can still wear your <br/>
&gt;travelling<br/>
&gt; &gt; clothes.  I normally carry my mithril breastplate, as well as the rest <br/>
&gt;of<br/>
&gt; &gt; my outfit with me, so that when I&#39;m not fighting, I don&#39;t look a mess.  <br/>
