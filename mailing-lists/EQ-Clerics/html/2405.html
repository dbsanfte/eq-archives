<div id="ygrps-yiv-1572038959">Since there has been so much talk about Rubicite replacements here... <br/>
here is something I would LOVE to see!  I&#39;m not suggesting it should be cleric only, but if it were we would be the envy of Norrath.. lol.    I would love to see a piece of armor similar to the Rubicite Breast Plate which instead of having a healing Aura would instead have an &quot;aura of clarity&quot; (for lack of a better term) and would help replenish manA.   This would be an incredible piece of armor for a druid, cleric, or shaman... even for a ranger or Paladin, though I imagine rangers and Paladins would normally opt for higher AC and or HP.    I don&#39;t know if anything like this will ever happen, it may be considered too unbalancing... I would love to see it though.  I think that would be as highly sought out (and should be as difficult to get!) as the jboots...   <br/>
