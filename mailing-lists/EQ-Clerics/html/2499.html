Gordon,<br/>
Congrats on your new position. I am glad to see Verant has put a person in<br/>
charge of bringing user issues before the dev team / management team, etc. I<br/>
hope this will go far to improve communication with Verant and the players.<br/>
<br/>
There are a lot of issues that need to be addressed, but the one I&#39;d like to<br/>
bring to your attention in this thread is the new class quest armor. For the<br/>
record, I play a Dark Elf Cleric, and I was thrilled to see that new quests<br/>
would be available to me (DE Clerics don&#39;t have a lot of quests - actually<br/>
zero for them specifically). I&#39;m sure a lot of other classes have the similar<br/>
complaints, so I&#39;m not just talking about the Cleric armor (and Caduceus)<br/>
quests, but it is the only class armor I can comment on in specifics.<br/>
<br/>
When Brad talked about removing Rubicite from the game, one of the reasons <br/>
entioned was to reduce camping. Herein is the problem I&#39;d like to address. <br/>
The Cleric armor (and others) requires a lot of camping! Two items in Kithicor<br/>
spawn once every 7-8 hours and require you to sit and watch one spot for it to<br/>
appear. I have to admit a bit of luck in that I logged out near the item and<br/>
logged in right after the servers came back up from a patch to get these items.<br/>
This isn&#39;t really questing, it&#39;s more finding the loophole in the system! <br/>
Also, many of the other items require camping a rare spawn in order to get the<br/>
item. These creatures (Babinsport, Bilge, Gull for some) spawn once every 7-8<br/>
hours, and also have placeholders! So what happens is that you end up sitting<br/>
in an area camping, waiting for the rare spawn to appear. To make matters<br/>
worse, some quest NPCs are also dropping good non-quest items, or quest items<br/>
for other classes, making them very heavily camped. Also, they tend to appear<br/>
in areas where there isn&#39;t a whole lot else to do. Babinsport for one, spawns<br/>
in Befallen, and there&#39;s not a lot to do for a 35th level character in <br/>
efallen.<br/>
<br/>
So, My point is that camping hasn&#39;t really been reduced, just spread out. What<br/>
would I like to see? I would like to see someone address and comment on this<br/>
issue. If the intent was to spread out the camps so that everyone isn&#39;t sitting<br/>
in Cazic Thule, that&#39;s one thing. But a lot of people (myself included) were<br/>
under the impression that the quests were suppose to reduce camping entirely.<br/>
Could you or someone else comment on the rare spawns in the class armor quests?<br/>
Were they intentional? Were they supposed to reduce camping times or just<br/>
spread it out? Will they be changed? Are we just being stupid and doing<br/>
something wrong? <br/>
<br/>
All the classes have issues with the stats for the armor, and I personally<br/>
don&#39;t want to go there. I just want to know what is the theory behind the<br/>
camping for these items. I sat and camped the Troll SK in befallen to get a <br/>
BC and I really hated camping! I would love to get my class armor, but I know<br/>
I won&#39;t, because of the camping involved. Thank you for your time and attention.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;My Question is when did you see this posted and are you sure they are <br/>
&gt;referring to Quest armor?  With this last patch they made the drop rate of <br/>
&gt;class specific armor in the Planes more frequent.  Just don&#39;t want anyone to <br/>
&gt;get hopes up if they are not talking about quest armor<br/>
