<div id="ygrps-yiv-31827071">Personally this is how I look at the stun thing..I think its great it makes<br/>
total sense that you can still be stunned while invurnable think about it if<br/>
you where invurnable you could not be hurt  right, say someone was chasing<br/>
you with a bat and you were invurnable and he hit you with it well it would<br/>
not hurt but it sure as hell would knock the hell out of you the pain would<br/>
not be there however. I just put it it into real life it makes total since.<br/>

&gt;You are wrong. Divine Aura and Barrier are awesome. I can&#39;t count the times<br/>
&gt;they have saved me. Let me try to explain this. We are in lower guk<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Mino&#39;s and Froggies. Our tank gets a bad pull and pulls 4 or 5 things. Or<br/>
&gt;another group has a couple. I know as soon as I cast a heal every single<br/>
&gt;creature that isn&#39;t being attacked is Aggro to me and will come to beat the<br/>
&gt;crap out of me. Now your tanks will not be able to pull all these creatures<br/>
&gt;off you fast enough. So I just cast Divine Aura. It is amazing how fast<br/>

&gt; could only be used once every 15 minutes.  Even if you die and have to<br/>
&gt; rememorize it, you still have to wait the 15 minutes to use it again.  If<br/>
&gt; this stun thing isn&#39;t a bug, then I probably won&#39;t use this spell more.  I<br/>
&gt; hardly use it now as it is since the only time I really need it is if I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; going to die and I have no hope of running since I&#39;m so low on life<br/>
