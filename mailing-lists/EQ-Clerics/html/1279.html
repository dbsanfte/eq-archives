<br/>
From my personal experience, your theory of first come, first serve is<br/>
wonderful, but as it stands right now it&#39;s not feasible in<br/>
implementation.<br/>
<br/>
Case in point:<br/>
<br/>
Last Saturday, some friends were doing a dungeon crawl in Crushbone -<br/>
the simple goal, to kill everyone once from the lowest pawn to DVinn.<br/>
So the group got all the way to the Tower, and killed Crush, killed The<br/>
Prophet, killed the Guard, and ... got interrupted by some druid between<br/>
24 and 28th level (he was blue to me, but I was just tagging along, not<br/>
actually killing).  And the duid said &quot;I own the Tower.  Get out.&quot;  And<br/>
then proceeded to take every spawn in the Tower.  *shrug*<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now, granted, this is obviously personal anecdote ... and I HATE arguing<br/>
using personal anecdote because for every personal experience one has,<br/>
someone else has a counter one. =)  But, the point is, the theory of<br/>
first come first serve is excellent right up to the point where someone<br/>
decides that they are above manners or have been wronged by others and<br/>
thus have earned the right to be rude.  The druid in the above example<br/>
actually said something inane about &quot;survival of the fittest, har har.&quot;<br/>
*shrug*<br/>
