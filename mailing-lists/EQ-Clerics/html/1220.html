<div id="ygrps-yiv-1835749539"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I have a question of my own, why is the cleric traditionally a poor class<br/>
&gt;(fund wise)?  Is it due to the fact that we med so much that we forget to<br/>
&gt;loot?  I have been hunting with the same group of ppl since lvl 15 and we<br/>
&gt;are all pretty fair about loot.  However, the other day we took in a dwarf<br/>
&gt;paladin, and my gosh, he was a greedy little bastard.  Looted everything in<br/>
&gt;sight.  However, when hunting with my group, I usually get a good<br/>
&gt;split...it&#39;s the monk who I feel sorry for...he can never carry anything so<br/>
&gt;he doesnt loot...but he is the richest one amongst us...=/<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The reasons I&#39;m so poor are:<br/>
<br/>
1) I usually med immediately after combat ceases in preparation for the<br/>
train the ALWAYS comes when you&#39;re down on mana and HPs.... (though<br/>
sometimes my group is nice and reminds me to loot)<br/>
2) Armour is expensive (still wearing some leather)<br/>
3) Spells are even MORE expensive (just hit 20th lvl and I&#39;m still 20PP in<br/>
debt to a friend for the last batch of spells...<br/>
4) Give over most of what I get to keep our Pally in good armour and so he<br/>
has good weaps<br/>
5) The Wizzie&#39;s spells are a bit of a priority after I buy heals and<br/>
buffs...so he can blow the crap out of stuff and save us from having to H2H<br/>
it...<br/>
6) I&#39;m pretty absentminded, and if not reminded to loot, I forget to  =0)</div>
