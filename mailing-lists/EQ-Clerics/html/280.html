<div id="ygrps-yiv-956604017">ahh the ever popular money issue...hehe what i did was just sell all the<br/>
loot i got....keep a few packs with you so you can hold more..then if i<br/>
didn&#39;t have enough money for the spells, i&#39;d get the ones i wanted most and<br/>
get the rest when i had the money.......at early levels, it&#39;s really hard to<br/>
get the money you need unless someone hands it to you<br/>

&gt; Hi, After playing about 3 characters, I decided to make another, and so<br/>
&gt; far I really like my cleric.  One problem I  can&#39;t seem to solve is the<br/>
&gt; money issue.  How did u guys get the spells and armor you  needed?  I<br/>
&gt; figure my lvl 9 spells will cost me near 25pp, and I still have my<br/>
&gt; newbie armor, and a rusty warhammer, nothing else...to get all leather<br/>
&gt; armor would cost me around 25-30pp...I&#39;m currently lvl 7, and I have<br/>
&gt; 10pp to my name.  It&#39;s a start, yes, but no where near where it needs to<br/>
&gt; be.<br/>
&gt; Even after this, how did you get money for the more exp spells?<br/>
&gt; This money issue is driving me crazy.<br/>
