&gt; Today on the EQ newsgroup someone posted this message about the jboots.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Recently it seems that the Devs have implemented a way so that Journeyman<br/>
&gt; Boots can no longer be traded from person to person by means of looting<br/>
&gt; corpses. This new rule irritates me, to say the least. I am deleting my<br/>
&gt; account and trying to give the boots to a friend whom I do not want to see<br/>
&gt; wasting away while camping for his own pair. Isn&#39;t there some way to trade<br/>
&gt; the darned things? If not, this only heightens the camping problem. Call me<br/>
&gt; a twink if you will. I prefer to call myself practical&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I went on to post....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;From what I&#39;ve heard you can not trade, sell or drop the jboots.  I agree<br/>
&gt; tho if you have to get them yourself and from what I&#39;ve heard about getting<br/>
&gt; them takes forever it just makes camping worse then before.  Cause now<br/>
&gt; you&#39;ll have tons of Lvl 35-40s sitting around waiting for the NPC to spawn<br/>
&gt; in hopes that it&#39;ll have the jboots&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Or at least I think it&#39;s around Lvl 35-40 for the JBoots.<br/>
