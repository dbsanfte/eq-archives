<div id="ygrps-yiv-194535004">Eq put alot of time into testing in Beta and I am glad it went gold rather<br/>
than wait 6-10 months more  ..personally. As I have previously said they<br/>
though have messed about too much in game with things suggested in the Beta<br/>
phase which had they been done then wouldnt be winged about on a daily basis<br/>
as they are now. That is my gripe about Beta not the fact it was released<br/>
too early. As with the many i see posting in these newsgroups many have been<br/>
playing for like 1-2 months. What game have you ever played some of you for<br/>
that length of time be honest if you are a n RPG fan online seriously.<br/>
Interplay could not even devise a stable engine for BG for most people even<br/>
when played through Heat or Gamespy and that is with possibly a 2 Gig<br/>
install. Here we are talking about a 500 MB install with the movie and<br/>
weekly patching. At least it is playable.<br/>
<br/>
Not flaming you and have run slightly off topic here but just saw the<br/>
reference to they should have kept it in the bag a bit more before spilling<br/>
it out and wanted to say i am glad they did...<br/>
<br/>
Re AC have the beta and havnt got round to the down load yet as have heard<br/>
some bad reports plus didnt like there xp amway pyramid thing. Will have to<br/>
do it and form my own opinion.<br/>
<br/>
Fair thee well<br/>

&gt; Actually, there&#39;s not much else they&#39;re working on, other than<br/>
&gt; stress-testing and zone population, that was in the letter I got when I<br/>
was<br/>
&gt; accepted into the 2nd phase of the beta.  They&#39;re just doing minor<br/>
tweaking<br/>
&gt; here and there to fix bugs and make sure balance is right (something EQ<br/>
&gt; should have paid more attention to in beta perhaps?), but they&#39;ve said<br/>
they<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t have very much left to do.  I will for one say that when I tried it,<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; played for maybe about 3 hours total before I got totally disgusted with<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; clunky interface, not to mention I&#39;m not a great fan of that style of<br/>
&gt; gameplay.  *shrug*  Just figured I&#39;d throw out what MS/Turbine has said<br/>
(and<br/>
&gt; some of my opinions ^_^ ).<br/>

&gt; &gt; Asheron&#39;s Call isn&#39;t really Microsoft, it&#39;s Turbine&#39;s.  Microsoft is<br/>
just<br/>
&gt; &gt; the publisher, Turbine is making it.  And it&#39;s not all that bad they are<br/>
&gt; &gt; still working on it.  Give it time don&#39;t judge it till it&#39;s released.<br/>
