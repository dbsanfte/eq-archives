<b>Subject:</b> Roleplay and Gating in combat Was re: Cleric Behaviour <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1067072225">I too am new in this ML. Being a cleric in Prexus, I<br/>
find more delight in healing folk wherever I go than<br/>
to rise in level. That is who I am, and that is what<br/>
I do.<br/>
<br/>
The satisfaction derived later on, makes up the<br/>
inconveniences we face. To illustrate this:<br/>
<br/>
Right now, I am a level 12 cleric (been offline a<br/>
month). I used to heal folk in Felwithe, Greater<br/>
Faydark, Butcherblock, Crushbone, Kelethin, Kaladim,<br/>
Unrest, and Befallen.<br/>
<br/>
When I used to be at Greater Faydark, I used to fight<br/>
with orcs. And at that time, in the world of Prexus,<br/>
we were not very strong (just launched in June).<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I despair over the STUPIDITY of folk around<br/>
me who just receive healing and get themselves<br/>
killed. And that is the main trouble. I heal stupid<br/>
folk as well. (Actually, I heal almost everybody I<br/>
see).<br/>
<br/>
Some names have been forgotten, but one comes to<br/>
mind. Peorith. A lady paladin. Once, she used to get<br/>
trashed up and I had to heal her, among others. Now,<br/>
she is far stronger than me, but she remembers me<br/>
fondly (even as I am level 12, and she is probably<br/>
level 20 something.)<br/>
<br/>
The point I am saying is that each of us have reasons<br/>
being clerics. It could be to &quot;serve&quot; our deity, or<br/>
to take a back seat in combat, and so on, so forth. I<br/>
know some clerics of Tunare like me, who hail me for<br/>
what I do. My behaviour and other clerics are very<br/>
likely to be different.<br/>
<br/>
How are we clerics supposed to behave is up to us. If<br/>
I want to heal EVERYBODY, even dark elves, I will<br/>
heal them. Some of my kind hate dark elves. Well, I<br/>
don&#39;t really care! I only care about this: That as<br/>
long as we are comrade at arms, that you are not rude<br/>
and impolite, that you need help, I am at your<br/>
service (which, incidentally brought the attention of<br/>
some powerful priestesses like Starr and Sadana).<br/>
<br/>
Because of this, it has made my life quite colourful.<br/>
I have had marriage proposals, offers to join a few<br/>
guilds, had my share of upsetting the orcs at<br/>
Crushbone (I was the reason why the death toll at<br/>
Crushbone dropped, I think). (Incidentally, I am<br/>
looking for the opportunity to build a relationship<br/>
with other guilds in Prexus. Hope clerical folks<br/>
could send me a private email).<br/>
<br/>
So I can&#39;t really see what is so significant about<br/>
cleric behaviour. We have reasons to be clerics. We<br/>
can be tanks, or can&#39;t be tanks (occasionally, I act<br/>
as a tank). We can be healers in a party or a guild<br/>
or for ourselves. For me, I don&#39;t care. I heal anyone<br/>
I see and refuse to aid anyone who is rude to me (and<br/>
let them just sit down, waiting for their health to<br/>
recover at a very slow pace). That is my &quot;behaviour&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Also, another thing for clerics. We all know that to<br/>
gate, it takes time. That is why clerics don&#39;t bother<br/>
gating when they are being attacked. Today, I was in<br/>
Befallen, and my health was down to a minimum. I was<br/>
dying and trapped in level 3 and alone. Thus, I was<br/>
forced to cast my gate spell, even as I thought it<br/>
was hopeless.<br/>
<br/>
And you know what? I GATED! I did receive 1 point of<br/>
damage while casting, but I was able to hold my<br/>
concentration. The moral of the story is: Sure, we<br/>
are going to get hit when casting the slow gate<br/>
spell. But when your life depends on it, try it. You<br/>
might be amazed that the spell will go through.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, when a cleric disappears in a party, a lot<br/>
of party members are going to die (but then, the<br/>
party members were busy attacking undead even when<br/>
warned by a low on mana cleric not to do so). Which<br/>
is why I said, I really have to tolerate STUPID folk.<br/>
And that, is my behaviour.<br/>
