<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-383299148">Go to eq.stratics.com and read the patch announcement.<br/>
<br/>
I may be wrong, but I don&#39;t see any mention of any cleric spell or buff<br/>
change. Nor do I see any SoW change.<br/>
<br/>
Actually here it is, directly from eq.stratics.com:<br/>
<br/>
September 13th, 9:00am<br/>
----------------------<br/>
Bug Fixes:<br/>
- Players levitating should be easier for other PCs to see.<br/>
- When charmed/feared and killed players should not be returned to the<br/>
character selection screen.<br/>
- Lore items in containers that are dropped should not be destroyed. <br/>
- Charged items, such as the Staff of the Observers, should correctly report<br/>
the number of charges remaining after zoning.<br/>
- Corpses should remain lootable even if a player goes linkdead while<br/>
looting <br/>
- A player under the effect of charm or fear can no longer open their<br/>
spellbook or sit in order to escape the effects of these spells. <br/>
- A player using online help should no longer be locked into the help screen<br/>
if another party initiates a trade.<br/>
- Non-melee items equipped in weapon slots should no longer mutate if the pc<br/>
is charmed.<br/>
- Extremely large NPCs, ie Vox, should not suicide when stuck.<br/>
<br/>
New emotes:<br/>
- Here is a list of new emotes that have been added to the game: agree,<br/>
amaze, apologize, applaud, plead, bite, bleed, blink, blush, boggle, bonk,<br/>
bored, brb, burp, bye, cackle, calm, clap, comfort, congratulate, cough,<br/>
cringe, curious, dance, drool , duck, eye, gasp, giggle, glare, grin ,<br/>
groan, grovel, happy, hungry, introduce, jk (just kidding) , kneel, lost,<br/>
massage, moan, mourn , peer, point, ponder, puzzle, raise, ready, roar,<br/>
salute, shiver, shrug, sigh, smirk, snarl, snicker, stare, tap, tease,<br/>
thank, thirsty, veto, welcome, whine, whistle, yawn<br/>
<br/>
PVP Changes:<br/>
- In order to make PVP combat between spellcasters and melee types more<br/>
viable some changes to PVP spell effects have been made. All damage spells<br/>
cast in PVP combat will do less damage to the PC than the same spell would<br/>
do to an NPC. When a PC is under the effect of a root-type spell there is a<br/>
20% chance that they will break free when a direct damage spell is cast upon<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
Spell Changes:<br/>
- Levitate: All players may now cancel this effect. <br/>
- Paralyzing Earth now Wizard and Necromancer useable. <br/>
- The Mana cost on some Magician damage shields has been slightly reduced <br/>
- Alter Plane: Hate and Alter Plane: Sky have been changed into higher level<br/>
spells.<br/>
- Succor: Ro (Druid) is now a level 39 spell (previously a typo as a level<br/>
49 spell)<br/>
- Curse of the Simple Mind (Enchanter) now lowers both Int AND Wis. <br/>
- Selo`s Consonant Chain (Bard) should now work better.<br/>
- Shadow Vortex (Necro) is more effective.<br/>
- Screaming Terror is now an all or nothing save <br/>
- this should stop the &#39;train&#39; problems that it was causing.<br/>
- Gravity Flux will now research correctly for Wizards.<br/>
- Lich and Bond of Death are now researchable for Necromancers <br/>
- check your tomes.<br/>
- The different types of Words of Collection and Words of Acquisition are<br/>
now more easily identifiable.<br/>
- Dead Man Walking (Necromancer) has been renamed Dead Man Floating <br/>
- Ignite Bones (Necromancer) has had the movement component removed. This<br/>
means that it will no longer break root and snare spells, and that it will<br/>
now stack with the darkness line.<br/>
- Syvelian`s Anti-Magic Aria (Bard) has been fixed.<br/>
- A bug in some of the AoE code has been fixed <br/>
- AoE spells will now effect more monsters.<br/>
- Some Magician Summoned items are now lore items. Items that have turned<br/>
lore have had other small benefits added to them.<br/>
- Dance of the Fireflies (Druid) has been changed from Divination to<br/>
Conjuration.<br/>
- Rangers have gained the spell Dance of the Fireflies (level 15)<br/>
- High Level Enchanter Illusion spells have had the remainder of their<br/>
effects implemented.<br/>
- Magi research components have been added to more monsters throughout the<br/>
world.<br/>
- There is a new pet command: /pet taunt and /pet notaunt. Pets default to<br/>
/pet taunt<br/>
- The Rods for the Ice Comet quests will now pop much more often.<br/>
- Envenomed Breath (Shaman) has had its damage raised slightly.<br/>
- Scourge (Necromancer and Shaman) has had its damage raised slightly.<br/>
- Enchantment of Light and Enchantment of Brilliance (Enchanter) have<br/>
beenreplaced by new enchantment spells. These spells have been added to a<br/>
hidden vendor somewhere in the game.<br/>
- New quests for Necromancers to research their pets have been added<br/>
<br/>
Pets:<br/>
- High level pets (44th and 49th lvl spells) do less damage<br/>
- Pets will now navigate some outdoor and dungeon areas better<br/>
<br/>
DoT Changes:<br/>
- If the monster is in melee with you, there is no change to how a DoT spell<br/>
works.<br/>
- If the monster is running away from you (fear, wounded, etc.), there is no<br/>
change to how a DoT spell works.<br/>
- If the monster is moving when the damage from the DoT is applied (happens<br/>
every few seconds), it will take 66% of the damage that it would have taken.<br/>
<br/>
- DoT spells have all had their duration slightly increased. If the monster<br/>
moves for 18 seconds during a fight, it will take as much damage from the<br/>
DoT as it would before the patch. If the monster moves for less then 18<br/>
seconds during a fight, your DoT will do more damage then it would have done<br/>
before the patch. If the monster moves more then 18 seconds during the<br/>
fight, it will take less damage then it would have before the patch.<br/>

Ok, well i didn&#39;t play EQ last night so I din&#39;t actually read the new patch <br/>
for myself, but I was on Battlecom with a friend who read it to me. Am I <br/>
under the correct assumption that they nerfed our buffs??  I am told that <br/>
they do not last nearly as long as they used to. This Whole new patch from <br/>
my understanding is the icing on the cake for Verant, they really get first <br/>
prize for F@#$ing the game up.<br/>
<br/>
All of the High level clerics who have ever hunted in Sol B or L Guk, or <br/>
have helped a Paladin friend kill Sir Lucan, knows what its like buffing to <br/>
prepare for these events.  ok so now our buffs don&#39;t last half as long as <br/>
they did and if you don&#39;t have a manastone or an enchanter, that leaves us <br/>
pretty much screwed. the time it takes to regain mana after buffing, you <br/>
will have to start buffing over again. Verant does everything they possibly <br/>
can to screw with each class and the success people have in the game.<br/>
<br/>
I feel extremely sorry for the druids and the necromancers of the game, i <br/>
know everyone has their own opinions about kiting, but lets face it, this is<br/>
<br/>
what these classes do, now they have screwed up DOTs, they have made SoW <br/>
only last like 10 minutes instead of about 25,I bet they f$%^ed up snare as <br/>
well, and they nerfed all the pets.<br/>
<br/>
Ok and the KING of all Verants high and mighty decisions. LETS NOT FIX A <br/>
PROBLEM LETS JUST MAKE SOMETHING ELSE WORSE. Point in case, The Box of <br/>
Abu&#39;kar 100% weight reduction, Verants code F&#39;d up and lvl 6 mobs were <br/>
dropping them in Butcherblock or something similiar, SO the almighty Verant <br/>
instead of Fixing the damn goblins went and Changed the Box. Beware if you <br/>
are a meleeist with a variety of weapons when you log into the Game you will<br/>
<br/>
be encumbered.   I think it was quite nice of them to change the box from <br/>
100% to a measly 10%. SO hence don&#39;t fix the problem just screw everyone <br/>
over.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;braces herself for a rippin&gt;<br/>
Let the Flames begin,<br/>
