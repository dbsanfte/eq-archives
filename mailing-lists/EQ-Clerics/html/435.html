&gt;I found it quite amusing last night while i was in Rathe Mts. we were<br/>
&gt;hunting Hill giants and there was a Druid who was a blue con to me, so he<br/>
&gt;was under lvl 35 and he was kiting hill giants that were yellow to me so<br/>
&gt;chances are it was red to him. amazing what kiting can do </span></blockquote></div>
