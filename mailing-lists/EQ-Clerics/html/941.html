<div id="ygrps-yiv-1560039061">I play a cleric on The Rathe.  I have experimented with healing MOBs, and as<br/>
far as I can tell , the answer is no.  Same goes for buffs.  That is, if you<br/>
mean to buff them while they are fighting other players.  If they are<br/>
fighting you, I think you can heal them, as I have done this accidentally in<br/>
the past.  I haven&#39;t done it recently, so I can&#39;t be 100% certain.  Though I<br/>
do seem to recall seeing the MOB&#39;s life bar inch back up after an accidental<br/>
heal on my behalf.<br/>

Has anyone tried healing or buffing a NPC or a MOB. I play a Cleric on<br/>
Rallos Zek (PvP) and my main rationale is I like to heal. I play a &quot;good&quot;<br/>
cleric and have healed bad/good races. My main irritation is when I&#39;m<br/>
suddenly PK&#39;d by a member of my own race. (High Elf. I hang my head in shame<br/>
at my fallen brothers and sisters)<br/>
 <br/>
Anyway normally there is a +/- 4 range for PvP correct? It seems to me that<br/>
the Cleric is uniquely positioned so that we can severely inconvenience<br/>
other players far below our level. If they are fighting a MOB can we heal<br/>
the MOB? Can we buff it? I must admit I have never tried it, I just thought<br/>
of it. Has anyone any experience of this??<br/>
 <br/>
