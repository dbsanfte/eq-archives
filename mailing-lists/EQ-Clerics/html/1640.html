<div id="ygrps-yiv-736990581">I&#39;m not saying that Voodoo II&#39;s won&#39;t work for EQ - I&#39;m mainly<br/>
discussing the exceptional situations in EQ where framerate just hits rock<br/>
bottom (like unrest or cazic) that aren&#39;t video card created.<br/>
<br/>
    BTW, The Matrox G200 is a *very* bad card - on par with the recent<br/>
crappy ATI  card.  (Boy, I really hope the video card OEM&#39;s don&#39;t read this<br/>
group =) )<br/>
    OTOH, Matrox really got their act together with the G400 - which IMHO is<br/>
the best consumer level card available right now. (and I have tried them<br/>
all, as well as some which won&#39;t be available until later this year)<br/>
    Matrox seems to go in cycles, it&#39;s hard to believe the same company that<br/>
gave us the great (original) millenium and now the G400 also gave us the<br/>
incredibly bad G200 and Mystique :^)<br/>
<br/>
... Anyways, my point is for the most part EQ runs fine with just about any<br/>
card, it&#39;s just when you enter a highly packed framerate death zone like<br/>
cazic or unrest (on the rathe at least), your choice of video card means<br/>
very little - as most of the time it&#39;s your CPU that&#39;s struggling to keep<br/>
up.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Hey, now, I use two Voodoo2 cards in SLI mode, and I am a<br/>
&gt;smoothly-running happy camper at 1024x768. My AGP card is a measly<br/>
&gt;Matrox G200 (just for fun, I tried running EQ using only THAT card at<br/>
&gt;1024x768. While the color was astonishingly improved, I could barely<br/>
&gt;move. :))<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Anyway, just for the record, i&#39;m running a 450Mhz K6-III, 256Mb of<br/>
&gt;SDRAM, have a very fast UltraDMA Fujitsu HD, and a nice fat 21&quot;<br/>
&gt;Viewsonic P815 monitor to watch all the action :)<br/>

can&#39;t disclose any information about the machine sitting on my desk in front<br/>
of me now :^)<br/>
