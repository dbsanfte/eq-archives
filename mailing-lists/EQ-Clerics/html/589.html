<div id="ygrps-yiv-194143058">2 quick questions:<br/>
<br/>
I got Rondo&#39;s tongue and a parchment of some kind from Rondo (the<br/>
dwarf in the slaver mines in Crushbone)  The tongue says it is a lore<br/>
item and I hear it&#39;s a quest, but where?  And is the parchment (forgot<br/>
what it says, some kind of list) part of it?<br/>
<br/>
2nd question, I just reached 10th level.  Is it a barrier level?  I<br/>
haven&#39;t played much at 10th, but seems like xp is slow.  Could be my<br/>
perception.  Or do the barrier levels start later?</div>
