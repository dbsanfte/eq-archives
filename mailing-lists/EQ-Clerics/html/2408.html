<div id="ygrps-yiv-1869897588">Count me in on the sit in!  Although some of the<br/>
cleric items seem decent enough, the simple fact that<br/>
we are expected to watch for ground spawns disgust me!<br/>
<br/>
The first time I waited for a ground spawn, I was in<br/>
Kithicor (this was before all the undead was<br/>
introduced there).  I had been sitting all by my<br/>
lonely for 3 hours (at least) and nothing happened. <br/>
Unfortunately, I had to run afk.  By the time I got<br/>
back there was a /tell from someone saying that they<br/>
picked up the item while passing through.  BAH.  <br/>
<br/>
Last night we were hunting undead in Kithicor.  It was<br/>
morning in the game and I decided to check that spot<br/>
since our &quot;puller&quot; said it looked like a bag was<br/>
sitting on the ground.  Well, I got excited and ran<br/>
over there.  Heh, not a good idea, i tell ya... Even<br/>
tho most of the mobs in kith con blue to me, they are<br/>
horrible to even attempt to solo.  Needless to say I<br/>
got splattered to the ground and lost my level. <br/>
Happened the second time too!  (no laughing at me<br/>
Topaaz, your day will come as mine did!)<br/>
<br/>
I have also died in MistMoore while waiting for the<br/>
ground spawn in there and I cant even attempt to find<br/>
the named gobbo in the Cauldron without a druid with<br/>
me.  To this day I haven&#39;t any of my ingots or icons. <br/>
I dont feel like dedicating weeks of time just for<br/>
ground staring.  Although I would love the added AC, I<br/>
feel that my wisdom enhancing clothing will have to do<br/>
for now.<br/>
