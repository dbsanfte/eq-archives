<div id="ygrps-yiv-699714705">I&#39;ll tell you what my whole opinion is on this camping/yield issue.  I think<br/>
the<br/>
first group there stays there, regardless of their level.  And noone is able<br/>
to throw<br/>
another group out if that group was there first.<br/>
<br/>
I have wanted a nightshade wreath and gem sceptre for ages.  So today,<br/>
myself and 5 other level 50s went to camp MM castle.  Everything there was<br/>
green to us, but myself and a level 50 shaman friend wanted wreaths and<br/>
sceptres, which we didn&#39;t have.  Under Brad&#39;s rule, if a group of<br/>
level 35+ comes, and they can get exp for that area, then we have to yield<br/>
and give up a spot we have been at for hours. Tell me where the fairness in<br/>
THAT<br/>
rule is.<br/>
<br/>
Since there are very few places I can get exp anymore and have maxxed<br/>
out level 50, I am going around and getting items I don&#39;t have because I was<br/>
focusing on exp and helping others level as well.  I plan to do the Paw of<br/>
Opallo quest next.  Mitty is green to me, as is Gynok Moltar.  Should I have<br/>
to leave camping them just because lower levels come to camp for the same<br/>
items I<br/>
want?  I think that is totally unfair. Just because I am level 50 doesn&#39;t<br/>
mean I&quot;m not<br/>
entitled to get items I don&#39;t have just because the mobs don&#39;t give me exp<br/>
anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Again, my opinion is....first there stays there.  Then when they leave, the<br/>
next group in line gets the camp spot.  I don&#39;t think levels should have<br/>
anything to do with who gets the camp spot.  I don&#39;t think high levels<br/>
should force lower levels away from a camp spot, and I don&#39;t think lower<br/>
levels should be able to force higher levels away if they were there first.<br/>
To do it any other way discriminates against one group over another (higher<br/>
vs. lower).<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;ll tell you this....if a GM tells me to leave a camp spot I have been<br/>
at<br/>
for hours for an item I don&#39;t have that I want just because some lower<br/>
levels  arrived and want my spot, then I won&#39;t be playing EQ for very<br/>
much longer.<br/>
<br/>
The only fair way IMO is first there stays there, regardless of level, then<br/>
whomever was next gets it next, and so on and so on.  Get in line and take a<br/>
number.  No one group of players should be favored over another.<br/>
<br/>
To do it Brad&#39;s way, would mean that any player that didn&#39;t get an item<br/>
while he/she was<br/>
able to get exp from that particular mob could basically never get that item<br/>
cause they could be<br/>
thrown out of the camp spot everytime lower levels came along.  This is<br/>
totally not fair.<br/>

&gt;What does everyone think of this Yield Policy?  In case you never heard of<br/>
&gt;it, it Brads new way of getting rid of high lvl characters camping lower<br/>
 </span></blockquote>lvl<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;spawn points.<br/>
&gt;This is what he said but it<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;If a higher level player who would get no exp for the kill is camping a<br/>
&gt;spawn, and a group of players that would get exp (meaning they should be<br/>
&gt;there) wants to fight there, the higher level player must yield. The lower<br/>
&gt;level group has the right of way.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As for the other disciplinary information in that post, it sounds like the<br/>
&gt;same policy that&#39;s always been in place: if you are warned several times<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;continue to break the rules, you will be banned.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Do you all think this will work or just tick off a lot of players?  I&#39;m not<br/>
&gt;sure if I&#39;m for it or not, but also remember if your a camper doing this<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;you&#39;re warned a few times you&#39;ll be banned from the game.  I don&#39;t really<br/>
&gt;camp, I do in a few spots but not a lot but only in places that give me<br/>
 </span></blockquote>exp.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;He said it wouldn&#39;t be actively enforced till it was officially announced.<br/>
&gt;Some ppl are wanting us to be able to vote yes or no on it but as of now<br/>
&gt;Brad isn&#39;t letting us vote<br/>
