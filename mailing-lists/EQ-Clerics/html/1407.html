<div id="ygrps-yiv-391777316">Mistmoore and Cazic are prime examples of when you have to learn to take the<br/>
punishment with multiple mobs. One heal and they say who is that there..yum<br/>
yum and that can be whether plenty of dam done by your party or spcin those<br/>
heals or whatever..<br/>
<br/>
And re taking the fall that was one of the places I died a bit on occasion<br/>
my fav tactic was pull the critters and say run as I hit divine a or b and<br/>
woops...still was normally sowed and gave them a head start to get the<br/>
hellout by gate or leggit, just depended how far i could get as to whether<br/>
my hits would last; the times I would normally die were when well deep and<br/>
was a gate and hope but then if I was saving 2 or more then i counted it a<br/>
worthwhile sacrifice, but did get a scolding for doing it but then they<br/>
realised they had better get out as I had done it and it was too late..again<br/>
MM was one of those places that evn though I had Div up they still kept<br/>
houndin me for some reason those inkies hated me reallll bad....<br/>

&gt; Mik i agree 100% with you, i was not debateing what you said, i was simply<br/>
&gt; stateing how i do it.  Furthermore, i melee alot but i choose to do it<br/>
when<br/>
&gt; i am Oom, i have died on many occations, when i was oom and ordered my<br/>
group<br/>
&gt; to flee, as i was full HP i stayed to get the critters of the rest of my<br/>
&gt; group.  IMHO i beleive that any cleric worth their salt will give up their<br/>
&gt; life to save the group as a whole, LOL don&#39;t get me wrong tho, i don&#39;t<br/>
like-<br/>
&gt; try to die, heh, and i am not saying this is the right way to go for all<br/>
&gt; clerics, it is just the way i play the role, most often i do not die tho<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; lvl right along with the rest of my group.  i have been blessed with a<br/>
great<br/>
&gt; group when we have more than one on us, and i am being hit, i usually just<br/>
&gt; have to say &quot;rook on me&quot; and they are by my side, taunting or whatever,<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; the only reason i ever lose anyone is if i am being hit and interuppted,<br/>
&gt; that part od it sucks, but alas we do have another cleric in group who<br/>
&gt; mainly does melee, so if i fail on a heal she can usually get my back,,,,,<br/>
&gt; thats all :)<br/>
