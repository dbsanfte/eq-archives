<div id="ygrps-yiv-14100422">I&#39;m 18th level, but I certainly hope I don&#39;t have this problem when I<br/>
get to level 20!  I would think that groups would still want 20th<br/>
level clerics if for no other reason than for Daring and Spirit Armor!<br/>
Admittedly, I&#39;m a little jealous that Druids at 19th get the same heal<br/>
spell I do, so why get a cleric, when the Druid serves the same<br/>
purpose at this level.  I kinda bothered me.<br/>
  I suspect you can solo with some success (or get some cleric friends<br/>
together) the undead reavers in East Karana, or you might still can<br/>
get xp (albeit probably not much) from scarecrows in WK.  I would<br/>
still think Unrest would want clerics, or start your own group!  You<br/>
might try Mistmoore, although 20 may be too low for that place, I<br/>
don&#39;t know.  You could probably solo crag spiders and gorge hounds<br/>
in EK, too.  You might try to get a group at the pickclaws in HH, too.<br/>
Hmm, beyond that, I don&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hi all.  I&#39;d like to give props out to you all, and everyone on the<br/>
&gt;eq-cleric forum at stratic. (if any of you do both of these)<br/>
&gt;So far that forum and this list is easily, from what i&#39;ve seen, most of<br/>
&gt;the maturist ppl in this game..mind you, there are always exceptions.<br/>
&gt;Well anyways, I&#39;ve run into real life head on, and basically my playing<br/>
&gt;time has become very short, to almost non existant.. :(<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m currently lvl 20, and am finding myself getting somewhat<br/>
&gt;frustrated.  I have a few wizards in the group of ppl that I play with<br/>
&gt;(all higher lvl though) and I am able to occasinoally go to multiple<br/>
&gt;zones.  I&#39;m having an extremely tough time finding a group.  Now, I know<br/>
&gt;my name has not been tarnished, unless it&#39;s been by an adolescent, so I<br/>
&gt;rule that case out.  My friends say this is a tough time for a cleric to<br/>
&gt;find groups because our heal spell isn&#39;t that effective (which I<br/>
&gt;agree).  But, being the poor melee&#39;ers we are, I can&#39;t solo (one<br/>
&gt;exception..If I can do 2 things..1) find undead available to kill 2)<br/>
&gt;root holds).<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve been to unrest, lake rathe, oasis, bird citie (south karana? or<br/>
&gt;north..can&#39;t remember), perma, and basically I never get tells back from<br/>
&gt;anyone.  Now one thing I&#39;ve noticed is that the number of clerics has<br/>
&gt;risen, and groups will often tell me, &#39;sorry, we already have a<br/>
&gt;cleric&#39;.  And I&#39;m not sure why they wouldn&#39;t want another one! Oh well,<br/>
&gt;I throw that away assuming they are playing their first character.<br/>
&gt;Anyways, I was basically just looking for a place to hunt and that I can<br/>
&gt;easily get a group.  It sucks when you might have 2 hours to play a<br/>
&gt;week, and you spend 1 hour advertising for a group...<br/>
&gt;Or is it possibly I&#39;m going to have to do my best to find a place to<br/>
&gt;solo undead for 4 levels?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Any and all help would be appreciated.<br/>
&gt;TIA<br/>
