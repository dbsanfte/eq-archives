<b>Subject:</b> Re: Can a cleric solo to 50? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1304407211">well, you can solo sg&#39;s on 50.....which is ok...i actually got exp from one<br/>
the other day that i killed solo....<br/>
<br/>
as for the cleric armor, i&#39;d have to say 2....most of the icons/ingots are<br/>
long spawns, and you need a group to get most of em...the only decent peice<br/>
is the mace, but i suggest doing that yourself....the armor may be tradeable,<br/>
but the mace isn&#39;t.....i found that out the hard way....had my druid do the<br/>
quest, and now she has a nice cadaceus of the sacrament /:<br/>

&gt; Just curious...any clerics here solo (or come close to it) to lvl 50?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Is there a good website that tells you how to do the cleric armor quest?<br/>
&gt; Like the loc of the items.  On a scale of 1-10 (1 being easy and 10 being<br/>
&gt; hard.)  What do you rank the cleric quest to be?<br/>
