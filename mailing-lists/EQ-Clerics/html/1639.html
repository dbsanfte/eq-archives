<br/>
&quot;In any case of your #3, I would highly recommend that folk *not* play<br/>
EQ<br/>
with a Voodoo I or Voodoo II based accelerator because of the poor bus<br/>
interface that the early Voodoo line fell prey to (and the Voodoo III<br/>
has<br/>
somewhat has inherited - Doh! please don&#39;t smack me 3DFX =) ) EQ is<br/>
definantly a texture heavy game and AGP makes all the difference in the<br/>
world for moving them around.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I respond:<br/>
<br/>
Hey, now, I use two Voodoo2 cards in SLI mode, and I am a<br/>
smoothly-running happy camper at 1024x768. My AGP card is a measly<br/>
Matrox G200 (just for fun, I tried running EQ using only THAT card at<br/>
1024x768. While the color was astonishingly improved, I could barely<br/>
move. :))<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, just for the record, i&#39;m running a 450Mhz K6-III, 256Mb of<br/>
SDRAM, have a very fast UltraDMA Fujitsu HD, and a nice fat 21&quot;<br/>
Viewsonic P815 monitor to watch all the action :)<br/>
