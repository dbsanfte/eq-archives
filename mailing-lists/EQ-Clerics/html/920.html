<div id="ygrps-yiv-1681743998">i dont know about you, but I&#39;m a cleric of Mithaniel Marr, I&#39;ve got 136<br/>
wisdom (higher than some dwarves I know) and using Greater healing (300 hps)<br/>
takes one bub of mana at 24.  If I remove all my EQ....i LOSE one bub of<br/>
mana also.  I figure I&#39;d be using about 1 and 1/2 mana if I didnt have my eq<br/>
on....so I&#39;d say up your wisdom, and mention that if your trying to heal a<br/>
tank who&#39;s 3-5 levels greater than you...WITHOUT greater healing....good<br/>
luck.  With normal healing, at lvl 23, using on a tank within my lvl<br/>
range...I&#39;d always heal 1 bub of health.  Greater i can usually do 1/3 AT<br/>
LEAST of his health.  That&#39;s a pretty decent amount...especially if the tank<br/>
is a bard.  (who has less hps than a warrior)  I wait till they hit 3 bubs<br/>
of health gone and wham....its right back....they cant beleive it.<br/>
Wizards....1 bub of health to full or almost full and they LOVE you.<br/>

Subject: [EQ-Clerics] My Experience With a Level 2 Cleric<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
    I just created a Cleric today and got him up to level 2.  At the guild<br/>
shop I noticed so many classes of spells...attack spells, healings spells,<br/>
and other spells were all handled by different NPC&#39;s.  I&#39;ll be spending A<br/>
LOT of money on spells.  I do have a minor gripe with clerics, though.  They<br/>
just don&#39;t have enough total mana, and the Minor Healing spell isn&#39;t strong<br/>
enough.  I was grouped up with a Warrior and after wasting all of my mana<br/>
healing him four times, only half of his health had grown back.  Clerics<br/>
need more mana!  What do you think?<br/>
