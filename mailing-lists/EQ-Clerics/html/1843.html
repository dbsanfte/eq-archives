<div id="ygrps-yiv-1964100993">So the Testament of Vanear can only be held in the hand where you have to<br/>
carry your shield? If that is true, then I will stick with my Charred<br/>
Guardian Shield which not only gives me +9 wisdom but AC as well.  The extra<br/>
AC is worth losing one point in wisdom if that is the only hand you can hold<br/>
the Testament in.<br/>
<br/>
Can the Paw be held in either hand?<br/>

&gt; I got my testament of Vanear last night.  And what Martyn Adams says<br/>
&gt; is entirely true (I admit, I was a bit skeptical at first.)  I am<br/>
&gt; going to post this information to gamestats today.  You need not go to<br/>
&gt; Erudia at all to get this.  Indeed, just give Moodoro Finharn 2gp and<br/>
&gt; he will give you the book.  Then give him the 4gp and he will start<br/>
&gt; giving you playing cards....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Stats are +10 wis, +10 mana.<br/>
&gt; I think it&#39;s off-hand held only.  But I do know the Paw of Opolla(sp)<br/>
&gt; can be held in either hand.  And some brave clerics hold both for a<br/>
&gt; truly intense increase in wisdom.<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Which hand is the book held in and what are the stats? Can you swap the<br/>
&gt; &gt;book<br/>
&gt; &gt;into your other hand?<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Being a Dark Elf Cleric, and one that has the Testament of Vanear I<br/>
can<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; tell you you don&#39;t need to do half of what you have written.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; To get the book just give Moodoro Finharn 2gp.  He gives you the<br/>
book..<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; then do the 4gp gamble thing to get the jester card.  Then give jester<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; card to Moodoro to get page.  Then go to HP and kill Dynil and get the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; other page. Stick both pages in book and hit combine.  No need to go<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Erudin at all..<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; You will need to not be KOS in Qeynos and HP of course but that is<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; reasonably easy to achieve and you should be aiming for it anyway in<br/>
my<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; opinion since DEs have so much hassle selling/banking as it is.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Talk to Rarnan Lapice on the top floor of the temple of divine light<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in Erudin.  This starts the quest.. I haven&#39;t done this part yet,<br/>
but<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve read about it.  Apparently you have to talk to several people<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one of them will eventually sell you the book for 2 gold.  The book<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a 2-slot inventory item.  There are two pages missing.  One of them<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on a guy named Dylin Fireshine in HHpass.  He conned low blue to me<br/>
at<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 17th.  I had a friend help me kill him, because the smugglers that<br/>
are<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; near him help out when you attack.  You can find him by swimming in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the lake and going into the small hole underwater.  You can find<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dylin up there under a little tent.  When you kill him you get 2<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; things, page 30 to the book, and a letter which is part of another<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; quest in Freeport.  After you kill him, the best qet-away tactic is<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to leap off the edge up the small ramp in front of him, and zone<br/>
into<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the keep.  The second page is in North Qeynos from a guy named<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Moodoro Finharn.  He hangs out in Crows bar.  I am KOS to everyone<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Crows bar, save for Moodoro, who is apprehensive, and blue to me at<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 18th.  If this is so, you can hail Moodoro and say &quot;I want page 34.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He will gamble with you to give you the page.  For every 4 gold you<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; give him, he will give you a random card.  If you get the joker<br/>
card,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; turn around and give him the joker card back, and he will give you<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; page.  I have heard that some people spent as much as 20 plat to get<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the card.  I just got it last night and it cost me 20 gold (5<br/>
tries).<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Go to the bank, and withdraw about 20 plat in gold to be safe.  :)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have the two pages, I just need to get the book now, and will get<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this week.  And I am 18th level, too.  You could effectively do this<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; quest at around 15th or so level, but you would need a group to help<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you kill Dylin, as he is at least around that level.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As a side note, a dark elf cleric should be able to do this.  You<br/>
can<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; exit the sewers and play cards with Moodoro IF he is outside Crows.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For the most part there are no guards around.  Getting the actual<br/>
book<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; itself would be tricky without since the Erudites are probably KOS<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you.  Although, if you sneak past and kill tons of Kerrans, you can<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; probably raise faction enough to pull it off.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I am looking for some information regarding this +10 wis/mana book<br/>
&gt; &gt;quest. I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;have heard that you have to start it in Erudin in the library. Does<br/>
&gt; &gt;anybody<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;know the persons name. Any other tips and tricks would be great.<br/>
And<br/>
&gt; &gt;if<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;anybody knows what kinda level you should be for this quest that<br/>
&gt; &gt;would<br/>
&gt; &gt;be<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;great. I better start practicing my 1hblunt that I havent used<br/>
since<br/>
&gt; &gt;8th<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;level.<br/>
