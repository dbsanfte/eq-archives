<b>Subject:</b> RE: Best looking clerics?.... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2039612460">Hmm...what are the starting stats for halfling clerics? Here is what I chose<br/>
for my DE:<br/>
STR 80<br/>
STA 80<br/>
AGI 90<br/>
DEX 75<br/>
WIS 98<br/>
INT 99<br/>
CHA 60<br/>
I am pretty sure that the only difference is that a halfling&#39;s DEX and INT<br/>
are opposite ours. But other than that I play my DE strictly for RP value. I<br/>
understand that I am not as dexterous as the little guys. That&#39;s the way<br/>
Innoruuk built me. All I can do is find things to help that stat. I think<br/>
it&#39;s important to play a character that you like, rather than for the stats.<br/>
Sure, if I wanted to max out WIS I would have chosen a High Elf. But playing<br/>
a High Elf would not make me happy. My personality fits the role of a DE, so<br/>
I choose this character, along with his shortcomings.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s all I have to say about that...<br/>
