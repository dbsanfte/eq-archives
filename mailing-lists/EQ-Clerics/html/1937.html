&gt;Aosinator had amassed almost 4000pp by the time she was level 15, and it<br/>

 </span></blockquote>4000pp!?!!   what the hell am I doing wrong....  I&#39;m like 22nd level now<br/>
and everything I own, including spells and some dabbling with trade skills,<br/>
MAYBE..   and I&#39;m broke!     <br/>
<br/>
If I may ask, was this from fighting/looting or from a trade skill of some<br/>
sort, or just a good head for buisness?<br/>
