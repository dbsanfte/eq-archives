<div id="ygrps-yiv-447138527"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;4000pp!?!!   what the hell am I doing wrong....  I&#39;m like 22nd level now<br/>
&gt;and everything I own, including spells and some dabbling with trade skills,<br/>
&gt;MAYBE..   and I&#39;m broke!     <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If I may ask, was this from fighting/looting or from a trade skill of some<br/>
&gt;sort, or just a good head for buisness?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A lot of fighting and looting was necessary initially.  I swear, I must<br/>
have wiped out hoardes of wisps, to this day I can still hear there<br/>
muttering when I walk by them.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
I used what cash I obtained from my adventures and invested them in various<br/>
trade skills, then used the money I had form trade skills and opened a<br/>
small item trading venture.  I tried to find out what items peeps needed,<br/>
that either I could get myself or purchase form other players that I knew.<br/>
Then I would resell those items at a small profit.  Repeat this over and<br/>
over for a month and ahalf and you will have a tidy amount of cash.<br/>
Warning, your experience will suffer.  The rest is really history, but to<br/>
be honest I gave up on the item trading idea long ago, when platinum pieces<br/>
became a way of just keeping score.  ;)<br/>
