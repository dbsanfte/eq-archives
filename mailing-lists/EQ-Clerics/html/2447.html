<div id="ygrps-yiv-462745556">If you can manage a couple hundred pp for the, you might try for the<br/>
Caduceus of the Sacrament, a quest from the Temple of Solusek Ro. Although<br/>
there is no way you can do this quest solo at your level, you could manage<br/>
it based on the good will of others, which I will outline below. This weapon<br/>
has no WIS bonus, but is just a great 1HB melee weapon, 12/32.<br/>

One hard part at 16th level might be getting the money. If you can&#39;t get it<br/>
then, by level 19 you should be ready to fight with a nice full group in<br/>
Solusek A. There you&#39;ll get good experience and your share of fine steel<br/>
weapons as well as straight platinum. The weapons you can sell for several<br/>
pp ea.<br/>

<br/>
ok, I&#39;d written my own with how I thought a lower level cleric could get the<br/>
pieces.<br/>
&lt;spoiler follows&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The icon of the sacrament is in Mistmoore, behind the middle of the three<br/>
doors in the &quot;bugged&quot; room behind the hidden wall at the back of the<br/>
graveyard. It is an on the ground spawn. There are three doors on one side<br/>
of this room, with a fake door on the other. Opening the fake door actually<br/>
opens the three doors as well, behind which are tiny alcoves each containing<br/>
some unpleasant bad guy. Go in the middle one to get the icon. To do this<br/>
you will need to have invisibility cast on you, I think it helps if it is by<br/>
somebody in their 30s. Look at a map of MM, and better yet get a friendly<br/>
person to help you go back and get it. It is an 8 hour spawn I think, so<br/>
ideally you&#39;d know it was there before venturing. Because of the many trains<br/>
in MM, there are always hurt people coming out, and healing some of them<br/>
should generate enough good will to get some assistance. You can also buy<br/>
invisibility potions for 10pp to 13pp in a couple places (like Rivervale).<br/>
That&#39;s awfully expensive, especially at 16th. I got somebody to invis me and<br/>
went in and grabbed it. I also recommend spirit of the wolf in case it wears<br/>
off, and divine aura all ready to go. SOW and divine aura can save a<br/>
Mistmoore gone terribly wrong, but the hope is to fight nothing.<br/>
<br/>
The ingot of the sacrament is in Rathe Mtns. A darker shade of giant<br/>
skeleton (high 20s) spawns there occasionally. Often there are people<br/>
hunting there, and if they don&#39;t need it they may let you loot it,<br/>
especially if you warn them that this no drop item is coming and you need it<br/>
for a quest. Happily, much lower undead also spawn at those ruins. For some<br/>
occassionally touch up healing you may be able to get higher people to pull<br/>
them one at a time, which should be good hunting for you or your group.<br/>
Actually, they may just pull them and let you have them as they need to<br/>
&quot;prune out the greenies&quot; to get the stuff they want to spawn, but not want<br/>
to spend their resources killing them all.<br/>
<br/>
If you can get the enchanter that does the enchanted bars for you to buy<br/>
them as well, they are almost certain to have a much higher charisma than<br/>
you, so even if they skim a few plat that way, it&#39;s likely to be cheaper.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hi,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am considering buying a Screaming Mace.  Right now I have a BloodForge<br/>
&gt; Hammer, whic does great dmg, but is slow and heavy.  I also find I am<br/>
&gt; soloing less, so I want a 1H that I can use my SBS with.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My current 1H blunt is a FS Mace, which has 8dmg, and rougly the same dly<br/>
as<br/>
&gt; the Screaming Mace.  Its wt is 10.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Other than the magical effects, is there any advantage to buying one? Or<br/>
&gt; should I save my money?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Brytewing, lvl 16 halfling cleric.<br/>
