<div id="ygrps-yiv-723411988">Yes I do have some thoughts in this... I think it also matters on your <br/>
race..<br/>
<br/>
As a Noble High elf I find if beneath such a noble calling<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I do not give free stuff to beggers.  I have never done so and I will not.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now as a player... I find it somewhat sick that folks feel the need to go <br/>
and beg for free stuff instead of tring to go out there and earn it.<br/>
<br/>
well that is just my PoV of the matter<br/>

&gt;Hi all.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I gave seen this debate before in other places.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What do you all think of begging as a method of acquiring<br/>
&gt;cash/armour/weapons?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t mean the skill of begging, but I mean approaching other PC&#39;s and<br/>
&gt;asking them to spare a bit?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Now, I am for it.  I beleive that RP&#39;ing worlds parallel the real world, <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;inthe real world, there are those who are poor, and need to beg for thier<br/>
&gt;sustenance.  At the lower levels, I gained most of my armour and my money<br/>
&gt;from begging.  Now I do it in a RP&#39;ing context, and not as &#39;Hey, got any<br/>
&gt;free armour I can have?&#39;.  I think that this is a valid strategy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As well, now that I am entering the teens, I don&#39;t need to beg as often.<br/>
&gt;But I do barter with players, and when doing so, I subtly make them beleive<br/>
&gt;that I am a poor cleric (which I really am). In doing so, I have made some<br/>
&gt;great deals, and am able to get some good bargains on armour.  Last nite,<br/>
&gt;for instance, I bought a bloodforge hammer for 15 pp, and a FS staff.  From<br/>
&gt;what I could see, they usually went for around 30 pp.  In my opionion, its<br/>
&gt;no different than trading in ussed car and dressing down and making the<br/>
&gt;saleperson beleive you are poorer than you really are.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Any other thoughts?<br/>
