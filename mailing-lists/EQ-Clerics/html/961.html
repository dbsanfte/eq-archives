<b>Subject:</b> spell question <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1246670339">Couple of things:<br/>
<br/>
First - Personally, I would rather see this mailing list as a way for<br/>
ALL clerics to exchange class specific information, rather than a place<br/>
for you to argue your selection of race.  Arguing back and forth only<br/>
clutters everyone&#39;s mailbox.  And because this mailing list does not<br/>
exist in the land of Norrath, RP-ing here is merely a waste of time -<br/>
when it is knowledge that should be shared here.<br/>
<br/>
Second - I am level 34.  Anyone level 39 or higher have information on<br/>
any additional DD spells that cleric will receive above wrath in damage<br/>
amount that are NOT only for use on undead??  Specifically the amount<br/>
of damage that any future spells will do. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks!! :) <br/>
