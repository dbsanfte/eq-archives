<div id="ygrps-yiv-316055978">And if the gate damage had been in the game from day one, would there be<br/>
complaints?  I say far less...<br/>
Should all of Norrath be available to every player from the get go?  I say<br/>
no...<br/>
<br/>
Hill giants and griffins kill low levels too...but we have accepted that as<br/>
part of the game.  If the damage gate had been there from day one, it would<br/>
have been more along the lines of &quot;Cool!  You can&#39;t even gate there and<br/>
survive until you are level xx!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Brad stated the Plane of Fear was supposed to be hard, in the context of<br/>
hard for very high level characters.<br/>
May seem elitist, but I think the high level players will probably<br/>
appreciate this more than hate it...keeping the lower levels out so they can<br/>
focus on themselves and not having to save newbies that just wander in to<br/>
the Plane of Fear.  And how does that sound?  &quot;I just wandered in to the<br/>
Plane of Fear...ho hum.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And it also proves to be an achievement of sorts, being able to warp into<br/>
the Plane of Fear and survive the shock that would kill the average person.<br/>
I am all for a Plane that causes damage when you enter it...makes it more<br/>
ominous and harsh!  Is the Plane of Fear supposed to be a cake walk?<br/>
<br/>
This is not a flame, I am just stating a counterpoint.<br/>

	&gt; Brad also talked about Plane of Fear and he&#39;s idea on how to keep<br/>
low lvl<br/>
	&gt; ppl out of it.  Heres what the post on EQVault said<br/>
	&gt; &quot;Brad also stated that he was looking into a way to keep the low<br/>
levels out<br/>
	&gt; of the Plane of Fear. Perhaps something like the gate leading to<br/>
the plane<br/>
	&gt; doing damage to those who walk through it. Thus killing any low<br/>
level player<br/>
	&gt; before he even gets a glimpse of the plane.&quot;<br/>
	&gt; Gee thats real fair, &quot;Hhhhmmm, I wonder what this gate is?&quot;  *ZAP<br/>
kill!!!*<br/>
	&gt; I say let them in but make it harder for low lvls, just like a low<br/>
lvl<br/>
	&gt; player wouldn&#39;t want to go to Unrest and if they did it&#39;s their<br/>
fault when<br/>
	&gt; they die.  Maybe put up a gate but around the gate have monster<br/>
that would<br/>
	&gt; jump low lvl players.  But for the gate to hurt EVERYONE and kill<br/>
the low<br/>
	&gt; lvls to me is very unfair.<br/>
<br/>
	Not to mention crippling high levels that go in to fight<br/>
legitimately,<br/>
	by starting them off hurt@<br/>
