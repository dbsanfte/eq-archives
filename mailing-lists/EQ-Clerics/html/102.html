<div id="ygrps-yiv-787833233">Hi, I just bought EQ (my friends talked me into it)<br/>
and they wanted me to play a Cleric - which fortunately<br/>
is what I always play anyway because I like them.  I read<br/>
through some of the archives here, and I have a few <br/>
questions:<br/>
<br/>
What is the best race for the cleric?  I made a high-elf.<br/>
Are they good?  It seemed to have the highest wisdom.<br/>
<br/>
It looks like strength is really important?  What is a <br/>
good minimum strength.<br/>
<br/>
thanks for the help.</div>
