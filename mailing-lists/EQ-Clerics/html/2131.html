<div id="ygrps-yiv-860558032">LOL.. are you suggesting that you have a +18 Wisdom 1HB weapon??  What do you use?<br/>
I am hoping to get one of those tarnished morning stars that the undead in Kithicore carry,<br/>
so that I can have a 1HB with +Wisdom... but for now i&#39;m sticking with my 2HB Staff of <br/>
Observers which is a very nice weapon.. as fast as a mace, higher damage, and +Wis/+mana.<br/>
It&#39;s only disadvantage is that it is 2H... <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m level 26, what do you use being up near 50?<br/>
