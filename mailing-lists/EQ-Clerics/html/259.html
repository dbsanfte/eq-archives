<div id="ygrps-yiv-29108147">From what I heard, this quest can give you 3 items. One is the BruteChopper <br/>
and there is another one wich is a 2hblunt with the same stats, and this one <br/>
can be used by clerics.<br/>

The other item is a earing +6 int, +6 wis and some ac...<br/>

&gt;There is a 2H slashing weapon called the Brutechopper. Stats 16 damage, 50<br/>
&gt;delay, and hits with magical damage. It&#39;s the fruit of a Troll quest (I<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t know the details), but if you are not a troll, it can be sometimes be<br/>
&gt;purchased from other players for around 200 pp. It can be used by large<br/>
&gt;races. I have played with an ogre who used one with great effectiveness.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Now here&#39;s the odd thing: the weapon info on www.gameznet.com/eq states <br/>
&gt;that<br/>
&gt;it can be used by &#39;priest&#39; classes, including dwarves. I assume that by<br/>
&gt;&#39;priest&#39; they mean clerics, as there are no druids among the dwarves. <br/>
&gt;Unless<br/>
&gt;they are thinking of paladins?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Can this be true? This is a two-handed axe thingie, 2H slashing. There is <br/>
&gt;no<br/>
&gt;other slashing weapon I know of that clerics can use. Plus, how do you <br/>
&gt;train<br/>
&gt;in 2H slashing skill? As far as I know, no cleric guildmaster is able to<br/>
&gt;train that! Don&#39;t you have to put a skill point into it before your skill<br/>
&gt;will rise?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Does anyone have any information on this weapon? Has anyone used it, as a<br/>
&gt;cleric?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Not sure I would want to use it, it&#39;s only minimally better than a glowing<br/>
&gt;wooden crook staff, which can be had for substantially less money, but<br/>
&gt;still, I&#39;m curious as to whether it is actually usable by clerics.<br/>

&gt;here, little guy, the kindly old dwarf won&#39;t hurt you!<br/>
