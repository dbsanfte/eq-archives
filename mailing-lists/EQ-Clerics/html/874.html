<div id="ygrps-yiv-1690331575">One way to test any spell effect:  cast it on yourself.  :)  Blindness does<br/>
cause your entire screen, including text and all to go completely black (I<br/>
think the lagmeter may stay), so the only way you can do anything is hotkey<br/>
spells.<br/>
<br/>
Also, to keep a top slot open, I prefer to use yaulp.  It only lasts 15<br/>
seconds, and you cast that, then your normal buff, let yaulp wear off, cast<br/>
the next one, etc.  The only problem with this is that I think cancel magic<br/>
ignores what is at the top, and actually goes with which is the oldest spell<br/>
first.  So you&#39;d have to totally debuff yourself in order to get to a DoT.<br/>
I&#39;d say your best bet will be to cast endure everything you can.  Also, if<br/>
he&#39;s a level lower than you, there&#39;s a slightly better chance of him<br/>
resisting your castings.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I was taking on a wizard of equal level, who by all means should have been<br/>
able to smoke me with magic.  What saved me was the endure mag/fire/cold<br/>
buffs, along with crush&#39;s tunic.  I resisted easily half of what he threw at<br/>
me, and I never had to fall back on divine aura.  Since divine aura is such<br/>
a quick cast, I&#39;d recommend having that on a hotkey, and have it ready as<br/>
soon as he casts a spell.  In my opinion, your best bet will be to root him<br/>
and keep him at casting distance, as you won&#39;t last long under the hitting<br/>
of 15-25hp/rd, let alone get a spell off through it all.  Make sure you&#39;re<br/>
at least buffed with Center/Daring, Holy/Spirit Armor, Symbol of Transaal,<br/>
and Endure Fire/Cold, and try like mad to get 19.  Good luck.<br/>

&gt; Originally blindness caused your screen to flicker continually. You<br/>
&gt; could do NOTHING or at least I could not.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The new patch I think just causes the &quot;visible&quot; area to go black. Not<br/>
&gt; the rest of the stuff...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As for the buff problem for cancel magic. If it really does cancel<br/>
&gt; from the top down, then simply pad it. Cast a &quot;fake&quot; buff (something you<br/>
don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; want or need to keep on like say fireshield or something) and then put all<br/>
&gt; your other buffs below that. Then when the fireshield wears off keep your<br/>
&gt; other buffs refreshed. They will stay where they are and the new &quot;bad&quot;<br/>
spell<br/>
&gt; will go in the top spot.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &quot;Flash of light is an awesome little tool, if it works. Its<br/>
&gt; &gt; fast and uses little mana. He also has cure blindness and he would be<br/>
&gt; &gt; stupid<br/>
&gt; &gt; to not have it memorized. If he is a lower level it can last a<br/>
&gt; &gt; reasonable<br/>
&gt; &gt; time.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I was told by a friend who hunted in Runnyeye that Verant issued a patch<br/>
&gt; &gt; that caused your ENTIRE screen to go black when you get blinded. I will<br/>
&gt; &gt; have to try this on myself. Because if this is the case, then even<br/>
&gt; &gt; though the troll shaman has me targeted, he will be unable to use his<br/>
&gt; &gt; mouse to click his memorized spells. He WILL be able to cast spells IF<br/>
&gt; &gt; he has hotkeyed them AND remembers which keyboard number goes to which<br/>
&gt; &gt; spell....but I know for a fact that this shaman hasn&#39;t done that.<br/>
&gt; &gt; So......It looks like I&#39;m going to be a Flash of Light caster on Sunday<br/>
&gt; &gt; night at the PVP grounds in Neriak. Hmm....maybe I should first cast<br/>
&gt; &gt; Invulnerability on myself to get him to waste his mana, then blast him<br/>
&gt; &gt; with Flash of Light, and keep blasting him with it while I melee the<br/>
&gt; &gt; crap out of him.....means that I&#39;m going to have to memorize extinguish<br/>
&gt; &gt; fatigue as well, cause it&#39;s gonna take me FOREVER to melee him to death.<br/>
&gt; &gt; And I should probably memorize Cancel magic in case he decides to root<br/>
&gt; &gt; me....But someone said earlier that Cancel magic starts at the top of<br/>
&gt; &gt; the stack. Why? That&#39;s where all MY buffs are! If I remember correctly<br/>
&gt; &gt; (from Highpass and the gnoll shamans who cast root), I think Cancel<br/>
&gt; &gt; magic starts at the bottom of the stack. Otherwise, it would be a<br/>
&gt; &gt; worthless friggin spell, eh?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks for the suggestions so far...keep them coming...and let me know<br/>
&gt; &gt; what you think of the Flash of Light strategy :)<br/>
