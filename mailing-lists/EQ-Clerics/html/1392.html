<b>Subject:</b> RE: Mana Formula <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1211067198">I think that last mana is very close.  I have 161 wis and am level 43.  I almost<br/>
have 170 wis (that darn gold ring wont pop on Mitty).  Anyway, Level 39<br/>
Resuscitate takes 500 mana to cast and drops my mana by under 2 bubbs.  I can<br/>
cast 3 Resuscitate in a row, then be so close OOM it hurts (I usuallu throw in a<br/>
sup heal too, so 2 is my normal max).  There is a little blue in the bar still,<br/>
could probably summon four food if I hadn&#39;t neglected my conjuration skill so<br/>
badly, but not much else).  I usually sit and med between recycle times for the<br/>
spell, but I don&#39;t think its enough to regain the mana I have when done.<br/>
<br/>
Using the formula given ([(wis/5)+2]*level) = [(161/5)+2*43]  = 1470.6<br/>
<br/>
After casting 3, I&#39;d say I have around 1600 mana, but it&#39;s awfully close.  This<br/>
is what the mana calculator on EQCasters uses (http://eq.castersrealm.com) and<br/>
it&#39;s the closest I&#39;ve seen.<br/>
<br/>
Still not a bad approximation.  I also heard that (Wis)*(Level)/4  is the<br/>
fomula, which give me 161*43/4 = 1730.75, which is probably too high.<br/>
