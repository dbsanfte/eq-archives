<b>Subject:</b> RE: i haven&#39;t been stunned lately..... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-472249844">The threads about divine aura reminded me to let you all know...i&#39;ve<br/>
used DA at least twice a night in Najena for the past week, and even<br/>
though I&#39;ve been running from skelly/ogre guard/magician/earth<br/>
elemental/mist elemental choo choo trains, I haven&#39;t been stunned once<br/>
while DA was active. Interesting.<br/>
<br/>
Is this MAYBE because the mobs who can stun are usually green? Most of<br/>
the skellys in the early stages of Najena are green, though I&#39;m not high<br/>
enough level for them to ignore (lvl 17). But I believe that I&#39;ve been<br/>
stunned while DA has not been acitve....hmm....i&#39;ll have to do some more<br/>
training (heh heh) and see what the deal is. Maybe Verant secretly<br/>
patched that little bug. Errr...chuckle....guffaw.....HAHAHAHAHA!!!!<br/>
Yeah, right. Freaking Nerf kings.<br/>
