<div id="ygrps-yiv-1170453884">This Happens with other things as well, not just with alcoholic beverages. I <br/>
must say though it hasn&#39;t happened lately to me.<br/>
I keep my guise of the deciever in slot 1 and my Jboots in slot 3 and I have <br/>
activated them both before in the same fashion, i do not know why it <br/>
happens.<br/>

&gt;Not sure if anyone else has seen this bug but I thought I&#39;d ask just to<br/>
&gt;see if it&#39;s a clientside bug I&#39;ve picked up or not.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If I have an alcoholic drink in slot 3 of my inventory and I right click<br/>
&gt;on my third spell to forget it I seem to drink one bottle of whatever I<br/>
&gt;have in that 3rd inventory slot.  I didn&#39;t notice I was doing this the<br/>
&gt;first time and I was messing about with my spells memming and remmemming<br/>
&gt;spells to cure someone..  I stood up and everything was swaying all over<br/>
&gt;the place.. it seems I&#39;d drunk about 3 bottles of alcohol while I was<br/>
&gt;memmin/forgetting spells..  this almost got my entire party killed since<br/>
&gt;I couldn&#39;t cast when I needed to.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyone else experienced this?<br/>
