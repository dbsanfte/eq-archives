<div id="ygrps-yiv-1127201959">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
The following is just a rant. Nothing of substance, just me venting about<br/>
last nites gameplay.  If you don&#39;t want to read it, feel free to skip.<br/>

<br/>
Rant.<br/>
<br/>
Well, last nite was just one of those bad group experiences.  I have<br/>
recently decided to setup home in Unrest.  Granted, its a dangerous place<br/>
for a lvl 16 cleric, but I consider myself a decent enough playe, one who,<br/>
in the words of Kenny Rogers, &#39;..knows when to hold, knows when to fold em,<br/>
knows when to walk away, knows when to run...&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
So I start last nite, and within ten minutes have a full group going.  Thats<br/>
what I love about Unrest, its so easy to get a group going.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyways, we have 2 bards, an enchanter, a pally, and 2 clerics.  So we<br/>
start.  I am nominated as the puller, which i don&#39;t like, but what the heck.<br/>
So i pull the first few mobs.  Each time, we kill something, I immediately<br/>
here the &#39;ching-ching&#39; sound (looting) and see i receive a split of the<br/>
money.  Of course, this is happening during the fighting, as opposed to the<br/>
end.  So i mention that it would probably be wiser to wait till the fight<br/>
was over before looting, as the mobs in unrest are unruly, and any break in<br/>
the fighting could cost us our lives.  Plus, it would be nice to get a fair<br/>
share of the looting rights.<br/>
<br/>
So we pull more, and of course, more looting during fighting occurs.  This<br/>
time I am more adament about the looting.  I amthen told by our lowest level<br/>
bard that she wants free for all looting.  I usually would agree that free<br/>
for all is ok, but I told her that it wouldn&#39;t be fair if only one person<br/>
got all the fine steel and bronze.  So we conclude that we will ffa the<br/>
money, and alpha the bronze and FS.<br/>
<br/>
Next pull, we get a nasty train.  We stay to fight, and we are doing ok,<br/>
until the clerics run out of mana. fortunately, we had killed a few, so we<br/>
got some good xp.  But the healing is about to end (oom) and we (the<br/>
clerics) yell RUN-ZONE.<br/>
<br/>
Of course no one listens, they keep fighting, the clerics make it out, two<br/>
of the group die, and the others limp out with a bubble each.  <br/>
<br/>
We get blasted by the group... Why didn&#39;t you heal, you should have had your<br/>
act together...  Well, we explain that the we can only heal for as much mana<br/>
as we have, and when the clerics say run, its run time.<br/>
<br/>
So we regroup, and go back in.  Another train, this time the enchanter<br/>
decides he&#39;ll play tank when he goes OOM. We tell him to back off, but no,<br/>
he stays and fights, causing the clerics to wast mana on him for heals.  He<br/>
died, and of course, blames us.<br/>
<br/>
Wash, rinse repeat.  More stupid group moves, more dying.  It ranged from<br/>
looting probs to players taking off to &#39;explore&#39; then dying.  And, we had<br/>
the people who were higher in level leave our group (we were abel to<br/>
replace, but anyone with a brain didn&#39;t stay in the group long).  <br/>
<br/>
In the end, I died once, but it was enough to wipe my Xp for the night, and<br/>
I made a total of 3 gold ( i usually make 10pp).<br/>
<br/>
I guess the conclusion is this: Some players think clerics are a bottomless<br/>
pit of mana/healing, and any death in a group is always the result of the<br/>
cleric not healing properly/fast enough.  My philosophy is tanks first,<br/>
everyone else next, me last. I&#39;ll tell you this, I now know who not to group<br/>
with in Unrest, or anywhere else for that matter.<br/>
