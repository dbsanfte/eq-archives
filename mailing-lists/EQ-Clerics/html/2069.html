&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyone have any information on where/when Rahotep spawns?  Rahotep,<br/>
&gt; being, of course, the named mummy that spawns in North Ro that drops<br/>
&gt; the Scepter of Rahotep (a 9/38 1-handed weapon).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I had read that he spawns just south of the undead ruins every two<br/>
&gt; days at midnight.  But I was there on an odd and an even day at<br/>
&gt; midnight and no Rahotep.  I talked to one person in the zone and they<br/>
&gt; said they saw Rahotep near the Runed pillar (next to the beach)<br/>
&gt; and the sun was out.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Is this something I&#39;m gonna need a ranger for?<br/>
