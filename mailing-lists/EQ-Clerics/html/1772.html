<div id="ygrps-yiv-2121259178">The only reason lately that I&#39;ll use these spells is to give my team time to get<br/>
the MOBs off me (Imp Protectors hit HARD!- and I once got Trapped behind<br/>
Skarlon&#39;s butt- not nice).  This time window, plus the anti-taunt effect is<br/>
usually enough to let me get up and start casting again.<br/>
<br/>
I usually will use DA first in a controlled area, where we know the spawns and<br/>
are not likely to get jumped.  I&#39;ll use DB first when there are a few heavy<br/>
hitting MOBs that jump me (well okay, I&#39;m trying to get either off- but DB seems<br/>
to work better, even with the longer casting time).  This works especially well<br/>
when I throw a heal on our puller then will wait until the last possible moment<br/>
to cancel DB if I have to heal, or just med through until DB fades.</div>
