<div id="ygrps-yiv-1526539092">I have used atone in battle before (specifically in lower guk) - it is not<br/>
time efficient, but it is rather amusing to see the mob change targets<br/>
immediately after forgetting it hates you.  Works best if it is still pissed<br/>
at the rest of your group members.<br/>
<br/>
Another fun trick with atone is if you happen to fight a froglok shaman or<br/>
other pet casting mob.  Once the master is dead, if everyone in the group is<br/>
ignoring the pet (ie - not attacking)  You can atone the pet and it will<br/>
suicide (usually).<br/>
<br/>
The only time I play with atone is when my group is not getting beat up<br/>
hard.  More to &quot;play&quot; not to be more effective in combat. :)<br/>
