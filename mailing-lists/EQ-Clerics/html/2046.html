<div id="ygrps-yiv-1306401720">I was wondering, lately in both HP & HK when I go to a shop owner he/she<br/>
tells me things like &quot;You make me sick, now leave my shop&quot; and won&#39;t buy<br/>
from me or sell to me at all.  I use to be able to till about a few weeks<br/>
back, I&#39;ve been turning in Orc scalps and goblin ears for faction but as of<br/>
now I still get the &quot;I dislike you&quot; from the shop owners.  Anyone have any<br/>
ideas?  Only thing I remember killing the said made my faction worse with HP<br/>
ppl was a DE in Qeynos and I only killed him like 1 - 2 times.<br/>
