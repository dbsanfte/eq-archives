I&#39;m  lvl 23 now and friends got me Glowing Crook staff, from LockJaw in Oasis (spawns ever 1 hour or so, also gives the Lockjaw vest ). My weapon is really good now compared what I had before. This staff is 2h blunt, 11dmg, 35del and weighs 8.5lb. Not to mention it IS magical. So no need to conjure a second weapon for magic mobs.<br/>
My previous 1hb weapon was Morning star, bought from a NPC in Qeyons and I used both Runed Totem Staff and Fine Steel Great Staff ( FSGS is 36del 8.5lb but NOT magical, RTS is 37del 11lb, +5hp, +5mana and magical).<br/>
I recommend that everyone of us develop both 1h blunt and 2h blunt skills. I don&#39;t know exactly what&#39;s the best 1h blunt weapon but I&#39;ve heard Screaming Mace is one of them and I&#39;m waiting to get to lvl 24 and see what kind of weapon is &quot;Hammer of Striking&quot;.<br/>
I hope this helps.<br/>

  I&#39;m just wondering what everyone is using for a weapon at what levels? I am a 21 level cleric mostly using a fine steel morning star, with the hammer of wraith for the magical creature. What about everyone else?<br/>
