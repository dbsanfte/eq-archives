<div id="ygrps-yiv-1221420692">as far as i know of, it only crashes when cazic is pulled.....something about<br/>
him...verant&#39;s working on fixing it...the exp loss is also doubled from in there<br/>
as well....which sux if you think you have enough to sustain one death and not<br/>
lose a level then die and come to find out you lose a whole bar instead of a<br/>
half.....<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ve been reading Plane of Fear is so buggy it crashes a lot.  If this is<br/>
&gt; true then why doesn&#39;t Verant fix it instade of getting rdy to put up Plane<br/>
&gt; of Hate?  Also if this is true then why would anyone want to travel in<br/>
&gt; there?  I&#39;d be to afraid that I&#39;d get in there kinda far just to have it<br/>
&gt; crash andwhen I got back on to find out that I had been killed and have to<br/>
&gt; run the risk of going back in there to get my corpse and have the zone crash<br/>
&gt; again.<br/>
&gt; Has anyone of you had this problem in Plane of Fear?<br/>
