<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-350000942">ok....upon my most recent excursion, i ventured away from the<br/>
lizard-filled ruins of cazic thule, and set out for the undead dungeon<br/>
lower guk....well, when i got there, &lt;mind you i had not been there but<br/>
once before&gt; i was following some group members, and went into a room<br/>
with vampire bats..&lt;they&#39;re not undead btw&gt; and was promptly<br/>
attacked.....the group was helping me, but things took a turn for the<br/>
worse and we had to run for the zone....i unfortunately was killed<br/>
swimming in the water back to the zone. well, when i went to go find my<br/>
corpse, it wasn&#39;t there, and doing the /corpse command revealed nothing<br/>
except for &quot;it can&#39;t be summoned from here&quot; well, i guess it got stuck<br/>
in hte wall or something, so i peititioned them to move it so i could<br/>
loot it..haven&#39;t got a response to it yet, but am gonna keep<br/>
trying.....what my question is &lt;i know you&#39;re saying about time!!&gt; is<br/>
this...does anyone know how long of logged in time will a lv 37 &lt;this is<br/>
freakin why i didn&#39;t get to make 38 :P&gt; will stay around? i need them to<br/>
move it before time&#39;s up, and i was wondeirng how long it would remain<br/>
there.....i think so far i&#39;ve been logged on about 7 and a half hours<br/>
since it happened...i&#39;ve heard it&#39;ll be there for 24 hours of logged in<br/>
time...is this right?<br/>
