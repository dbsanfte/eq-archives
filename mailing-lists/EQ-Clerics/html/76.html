<div id="ygrps-yiv-6902996">Hi there,<br/>
<br/>
I have no ideas on the wall ring subject, but as far as training I am a<br/>
human cleric and i can&#39;t train in Kaladim, i don&#39;t know that there is<br/>
anything that can be done about that.<br/>

&gt;Greetings fellow clerics of Norrath!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am currently playing a Lvl 19 female Dwarf cleric at Innoruuk server.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am about to complete the Wall squad ring quest at Rivervale (Ghobber<br/>
 </span></blockquote>considers me warmly now... shouldn&#39;t take long).<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;Yesterday when i was hunting goblins in Runnyeye with full party, someone<br/>
 </span></blockquote>asked me to charge his Wall squad ring. At first i started thinking how can<br/>
i do that. Then someone said that only halflings can charge them. So i never<br/>
had the chance of trying it. The person who asked me to charge the ring<br/>
thought i was a halfling :(. So can&#39;t clerics of any other race than<br/>
halfling charge these rings?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;And eh, why the heck the cleric guild at Rivervale won&#39;t let me train my<br/>
 </span></blockquote>skills? I think i never did anything that could worsen my faction standing<br/>
with them. So do i need to raise my faction standing with them before they<br/>
will talk to me? Or is this similar case as when any Elf tries to trade with<br/>
the Innkeeper at Kaladim (I think Irontoe something was his name) and he<br/>
always turns them down. I&#39;m also having the same problem with the human<br/>
clerics in Freeport. Do i really have to go all the way to Kaladim to be<br/>
able to use my training points?<br/>
