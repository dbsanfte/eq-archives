<div id="ygrps-yiv-1107447471">Clerics are mainly healers.. yes.  But that doesn&#39;t mean they can&#39;t do<br/>
other stuff.  My friend (lvl 48 cleric) says he is very offense<br/>
oriented.  It all depends on what his group is fighting.  If it&#39;s a<br/>
tough solo mob, he burns about half his mana on casting (he does 565 dam<br/>
a pop) and the other half on healing.  Medding whenever possible. <br/>
Clerics don&#39;t have to save all their mana for healing.  Most fights I<br/>
come out with 80% mana.  Soo..  I now dedicate more of my mana to<br/>
offense too.  Find a happy place.</div>
