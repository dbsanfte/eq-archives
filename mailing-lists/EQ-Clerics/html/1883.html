&gt;Subject: [EQ-Clerics] Faction in Rivervale<br/>
&gt;Date: Mon, 18 Oct 1999 13:34:03 -0400<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hi all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am a halfling cleric of Rivervale, and have lost faction in my town with<br/>
&gt;the merchants.  This was caused by fighting with Mangler.  I killed him 3 <br/>
&gt;or<br/>
&gt;4 times as a young halfling, because he atacked me.  The 5th time I did it,<br/>
&gt;I lost enough faction to con dubious, and hence, lose buying and selling<br/>
&gt;privileges.  I was able to regain my faction by handing in 24 RE warbeads <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;the sheriff. That was level 9.  However, at level 11, I was again attacked<br/>
&gt;by him, but he was killed by someone else. No matter, my faction bit the<br/>
&gt;dust again.  Now, at level 13, almost 14, I have handed in 96 warbeads, and<br/>
&gt;still con dubious to the merchants, and still can&#39;t buy nor sell (other <br/>
&gt;than<br/>
&gt;to the druids).  My questions are this:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1) How many RE warbeads do I need to hand in?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;2) As I get higher in level, is it more required of me to regain faction?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The only reason this really matters is because I can&#39;t buy my spells from<br/>
&gt;the cleric guild any more.  Otherwise, I wouldn&#39;t give a hoot.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
