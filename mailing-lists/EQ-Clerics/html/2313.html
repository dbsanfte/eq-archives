<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-182630733">Gatorscale leggings are found on the ancient croc in Upper Guk. There is a<br/>
spawn every 17 or 18 minutes, which can be from one to five saltwater crocs,<br/>
or the ancient itself. I believe the ancient always drops either the<br/>
leggings or gatorscale sleeves, which have +int.<br/>
<br/>
I have never tried to solo the ancient, but at level 35 the saltwater crocs<br/>
were easy enough, while still giving me experience. If you are level 24 or<br/>
so, a small group might be required. If you are 29, I would advise taking a<br/>
partner along. The crocs aren&#39;t linked, so you can nuke one and kill it<br/>
before going on to the next one.<br/>
<br/>
An interesting thing happened to me while I was camping the ancient just<br/>
this weekend. A wizard turned up, aftter the sleeves. We had had no ancient<br/>
spawn in a few hours. He mentioned that there was a rumour that if you stood<br/>
or sat on the last step furthest away from the spawn the ancient was more<br/>
likely to spawn. I&#39;m sure many of you know, when you are camping these<br/>
things you get desperate, and try strange things.<br/>
<br/>
Lo and behold, the ancient spawned. We nuked it to oblivion, and it had the<br/>
leggings! I was there with a druid friend of mine, and we still had to get<br/>
one more pair. Next spawn, nothing (I secretly blamed myself for this one,<br/>
because I accidently walked up on to the second step). Next spawn, ancient<br/>
again, with leggings again. I was flabbergasted, as I had never heard of the<br/>
ancient spawning that often.<br/>
<br/>
I told the wizard we would stick around for a couple more spawns to see if<br/>
the ancient appeared again. He was happy for the company (not that he needed<br/>
any more nuking power), because it gets mind numbingly boring down there.<br/>
Would you believe it, the ancient spawns *again*, this time with sleeves! I<br/>
was speechless. Three out of four spawns, producing two leggings and one<br/>
sleeves, exactly what we wanted.<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say, this wizard now has a fixture on my friends list. I started<br/>
to think he might have been a GM-Admin, and forced the spawn himself.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Norin for posting the question and allowing me to describe this<br/>
amazing experience.<br/>
