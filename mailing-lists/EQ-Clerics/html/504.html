 </span></blockquote>Ho ho ho, laddie! Ye can wear full bronze if yer a dwarf, ye can! Of course,<br/>
ye are limited in the loot ye can carry, which sorely grieves a dwarf, for<br/>
we are very fond of gold and gems...<br/>
<br/>
But having gotten me armor up to almost full bronze (at astonishingly low<br/>
prices in the small bronze mines of Unrest), I am now in the process of<br/>
replacing it with other stuff, that will boost me wisdom. As others have<br/>
said, the higher ye go, the less ye melee, and the more yer value to yer<br/>
group is in yer buffs and heals.<br/>
<br/>
But having said that, I would not turn down any rubicite if it happened to<br/>
come me way, no, I would not...<br/>
