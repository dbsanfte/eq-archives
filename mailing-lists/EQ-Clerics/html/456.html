<div id="ygrps-yiv-1249929294">hehe...ok kiting is what druids &lt;and bards sometimes&gt; can do.....basically<br/>
taking on an npc that&#39;s a few levels above you, yellow to red, and snaring<br/>
them, swarming them, and then running and blasting with sow on........i think<br/>
it&#39;s quite interesting.....useful too if you have the mana to be able to take<br/>
them down.....i haven&#39;t begun to master this yet, but still working on<br/>
it......would love to be able to solo a yellow kill without getting<br/>
killed...need more mana for that tho......<br/>

&gt; &gt;I found it quite amusing last night while i was in Rathe Mts. we were<br/>
&gt; &gt;hunting Hill giants and there was a Druid who was a blue con to me, so he<br/>
&gt; &gt;was under lvl 35 and he was kiting hill giants that were yellow to me so<br/>
&gt; &gt;chances are it was red to him. amazing what kiting can do<br/>
