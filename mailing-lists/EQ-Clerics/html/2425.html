************************<br/>
<br/>
I play a fantasy/medievel LARP &lt;NERO&gt; and this seems<br/>
to be the way with all the magic items in our game. <br/>
At lower levels, dagger, potions, etc.. are worth alot<br/>
to you, coin is very valuable.  As you progress you<br/>
are going on small quests and getting abundunce of<br/>
coin to gain levels, and few items.  As you progress<br/>
to higher level the magic items are whats the most<br/>
wanted.  Your sword can only be so good unless its<br/>
magical, the shield and armor is the same unless its<br/>
magical.  Everyone wants magic items, and cause you<br/>
have been adventuring so long, and are killing larger<br/>
creatures now you have an abundance of coin.<br/>
Items can only be traded for itmes, cause coin is a<br/>
common thing.  The way this can only be solved is that<br/>
the coin is used for something, to gain levels, its<br/>
turned in for exp.  In EQ the coin is worthless in<br/>
only regards to buying items.  Maybe if it was used to<br/>
buy entertainment, or to buy house, estates, etc..<br/>
than it would be needed.  They must make coin valuable<br/>
at all stages in level progression.<br/>

&gt; less value platinum has and everything that you want<br/>

&gt; outrageous amount of platinum (because plat is so<br/>
&gt; easy to come by at high levels) or C) the person who<br/>
&gt; has the item wants to trade it instead of selling it<br/>
&gt; (again because plat isn&#39;t worth that much compared<br/>
&gt; to the time spent getting items).   In the case of<br/>
&gt; C, you need to camp to get the items that the person<br/>
&gt; is willing to trade the item you want for... so you<br/>
&gt; either camp for that or you camp for the item you<br/>
&gt; actually want.. either way you are going to camp.  <br/>
&gt; In the case of A, you have no choice because it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; No-Drop so nobody else can get it for you, and in<br/>
&gt; the case of B.. well you will be saving your pennies<br/>
&gt; a long long time.    So, I think that you will find<br/>
&gt; yourself camping in levels to come and you will<br/>
&gt; realize pretty quickly why people are complaining<br/>
&gt; about it =)<br/>

&gt; &gt; I hope you are all successful.  Personally, I am<br/>
&gt; too impatient to camp for<br/>
&gt; &gt; items, even if it it only takes an hour.  So if<br/>
&gt; your protest helps in that<br/>
&gt; &gt; regard, I am sure it will benfit me as well.  My<br/>
&gt; approach is to just play<br/>
&gt; &gt; the game, amass experience and wealth, and hope<br/>
&gt; that I can buy what I need.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Mind you , I&#39;m only 16th level now, so in the<br/>
&gt; future, I may need to camp for<br/>
&gt; &gt; stuff.  But so far, I have not camped for a single<br/>
&gt; thing, I am happy with<br/>
&gt; &gt; what my character can and can&#39;t do, and have no<br/>
&gt; complaints about world<br/>
&gt; &gt; called Norrath. The only complaints I have I can<br/>
&gt; live with, and they mostly<br/>
&gt; &gt; have to do with the UI of the game and with GM<br/>
&gt; conduct.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Aye, but looking at it from your perspective you<br/>
&gt; could consider that if the<br/>
&gt; &gt; sit-in is successful, it&#39;s possible that the 8<br/>
&gt; hour camps could be reduced<br/>
&gt; &gt; which would give you LESS time to sit around on<br/>
&gt; purpose (camping for<br/>
&gt; &gt; items)...  =)<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; It all depends on how you look at it...<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, I&#39;m taking this sit in from a different<br/>
&gt; perspective.  I only get a<br/>
&gt; &gt; few<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; hours of play time a week, and I think that I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; rather use it playing the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; game as opposed to sitting around.  I do enough<br/>
&gt; sitting around, what with<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; trying to find a group and all to play in.  I<br/>
&gt; sure don&#39;t want to do it on<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; purpose.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Just my thought.<br/>
