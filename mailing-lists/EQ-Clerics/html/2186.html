I was told that it used to be every 7 hours but now they have changed it to<br/>
2 spawns per day.   I waited a FULL 7 hours when I camped him, so if it is<br/>
in fact 7 hours then I must have got there RIGHT after he died, and the<br/>
place was empty when I got there so I believe it is longer than 7 hours.<br/>
I hate the camping quests... I guess that is Verant&#39;s idea of a good time.<br/>
   I literally sat at his spawn site for 7 hours.   He is level 15 or so...<br/>
green to me at 27.    It is a nice item though...<br/>
<br/>
In part of their quest against camping, EQ set things up with a spawn<br/>
range. Not a specific time. the 7 hour spawn will have a time of, say, 5 to<br/>
7 hours in which it will respawn. As far as I know, the longest spawn in<br/>
the game is something on the Shaman armour quest, with a maximum of 48<br/>
hours between death and respawn.<br/>
