Subject: [EQ-Clerics] Testament of Vanear - hint for Dark Elf Clerics *small<br/>
spoiler*<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For those of us that are Dark Elf clerics - it looks as if it is still<br/>
possible to get the Testament of Vanear - despite being disliked in Erudin<br/>
and Qeynos.   You will need friends to help you though.<br/>
 <br/>
When the quest starts in Erudin, you (or a friend of yours if you have<br/>
someone) will be given a book, with slots and a combine button.  You search<br/>
for the missing pages (or get a nice friend to help you) and put the pages<br/>
in the book.   So, it appears that the Testament of Vanear is NOT formed<br/>
until you combine the items in the book.  If you have a friend willing to<br/>
get the items for you - a dark elf should in theory be able to get this no<br/>
drop quest item - just don&#39;t let your friend *combine* them.  You must do<br/>
that. (*note - the information I had did not say if the book or pages used<br/>
to combine were no drop - if anyone knows that they are, please let me know)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
I have not tried this myself - but I think I will :)  Hopefully it will<br/>
work!! <br/>
