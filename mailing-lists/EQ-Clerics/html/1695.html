<div id="ygrps-yiv-361942058">The benefit to Revive is that you can save a lot of down time if one or more<br/>
of your party members dies by bringing them back right away.  No waiting for<br/>
them to run back.  You should bind yourself close to where you are hunting<br/>
so you can get back fast and revive the others.  It&#39;s an incredibly useful<br/>
spell to your party members.  Especially if you are travelling across the<br/>
continent and you have members who are bound only in cities, if one of them<br/>
dies, you can get them back quickly.<br/>
