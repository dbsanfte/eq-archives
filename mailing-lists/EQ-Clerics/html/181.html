<div id="ygrps-yiv-1516390379">Whoa boy, you dont know what hags are :).  At level 23, 2 festering hag<br/>
spells kill me.  Their spells do about 250 a pop or around there.  I&#39;ve seen<br/>
them take down a 28 paladin in about 4 secs.  You dont have the time to cast<br/>
gate.  Yesterday, I was jumping off the roof in unrest as a quick way down,<br/>
and i LANDED on a hag.  So of course the first thing i did was hit my hotkey<br/>
(see the use of it?) for divine, RIGHT before she finished casting.  That<br/>
definately saved me.  I ran like hell and made it to zone before she could<br/>
cast again (amen SOW).<br/>

&gt;would also be a problem. Do they use these?<br/>
