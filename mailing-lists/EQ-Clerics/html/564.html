<div id="ygrps-yiv-370579972">Whoa! You must have had a really bad group. I lived in Unrest from level 16<br/>
until level 20, made lots of loot, didn&#39;t die any more than I did elsewhere,<br/>
and came out with a full set of bronze armor. I moved on only because I<br/>
thought I was getting a little stale, and I knew I was going to have to be<br/>
level 24 or 25 before I could safely fight in the barroom or the tower, or<br/>
level 30 before I could go to the basement. And when I hit those levels, I&#39;m<br/>
a&#39;comin&#39; back!<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, a lot of other people like Unrest, too, which is why it isn&#39;t<br/>
unusual to see 100 people in that zone on Fennin Ro, evenings =(.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s true, the trains can be amazing. But one nice thing about Unrest is<br/>
that the lawn is so wide open, you can often get out of the way of the<br/>
train, which you can&#39;t do in Befallen or Guk, or even Crushbone often. It&#39;s<br/>
awe inspiring to watch two festering hags, a werebat, a greater darkbone or<br/>
two, a couple of mortuary fungi, a tentacle terror, the dwarven spirit and a<br/>
gaggle of tormented dead, darkbones, lurking mummies and death beetles<br/>
thunder past you, headed for the exit!<br/>

&gt;well the reason I said that came from personal experiance.. I died about 9<br/>
&gt;times in one day in unrest and I was lvl 19. So I kinda hate the place and<br/>
&gt;didn&#39;t want him to come and flame me &#39;cause I suggest him to go there :)<br/>
