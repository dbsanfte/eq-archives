<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1300070431">Did they increase the spawn times of the Swirlspine Guardians lately?  Anyone<br/>
out there know?  We would pull the first 3, kill them, then do any ressing<br/>
necessary and rebuff only to find that they have respawned.  We did this in way<br/>
less than the 20 minutes the respawn used to be.  I figure we&#39;ll be okay once we<br/>
get a couple of level 50 enchanters with the groups we had down there, even the<br/>
48 enchanter that was there was able to mess the Guardians (wasn&#39;t too sure if<br/>
he would be able to).  I thought we could do it last night, but when we pulled<br/>
him someone just got a little jumpy on the evac call because of poor<br/>
communication.  By the time everyone got back it was already 2am :(<br/>
<br/>
We still need to get a body from down there soon, so any help ya could provide<br/>
would be appriciated.<br/>
