<b>Subject:</b> Info on two spells and other things <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-3385518">I&#39;ve read on various websites that the GUARD spell is an additional spell line<br/>
to the Armor series (Holy, Spirit, etc) and the Courage series (Center, Daring,<br/>
etc).  On other websites, GUARD is listed as the next upgrade to Spirit Armor.<br/>
<br/>
What is the HP bonus for the 2nd line of Symbols spells?  I&#39;m at level 23 and <br/>
fairly excited (I bought all the 24th level spells and the reagents for the <br/>
next Symbol line and keep them in a backpack with me) about my new buffs.<br/>
<br/>
Could one of you higher-level Clerics tell us the truth on these two spells?<br/>
<br/>
Also - Besides a Heal or GHeal, what&#39;s the best taunt for a cleric?  I&#39;ve found<br/>
that Flash of Light (or whatever that level 1 spell is called) is fairly decent.<br/>
Sometimes, if my Ranger buddy is taking too much of a beating, I&#39;d like to step<br/>
in and take some pressure off of him temporarily so that he can cast a few DD<br/>
and Entangle spells.<br/>
<br/>
One last point - I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that my 1HB weapon isn&#39;t going to <br/>
cut the mustard in days to come - is it too late for me to start working on my<br/>
2HB skill?  Can I take it from 3 (I&#39;m guessing) up to my current skill level of<br/>
1HB?  Or will I advance in 5 point increments with each level from this point <br/>
forward?  I&#39;m only asking because I saw a level 29-ish cleric with a big staff<br/>
beat the tar out of a Greater Zombie in Lake Rath the other day.  He was giving<br/>
almost as good as he got without using spells.  Needless to say, I was in awe.<br/>
<br/>
Forgive me if I&#39;m rehashing old material, but I&#39;m fairly new to this site and<br/>
I&#39;m sure there are others like me who would love to hear suggestions and helpful<br/>
hints from the WISER clerics out there. &lt;Grin&gt;  If no one has time for this <br/>
answer (no pressure mind you) then please let us know where we can get this <br/>
info.<br/>
<br/>
Sending my best wishes from Cazic Thule!!<br/>
