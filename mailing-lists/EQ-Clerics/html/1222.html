<div id="ygrps-yiv-1558657113">Rangers and druids often announce themselves as name so-and-so of the (lvl)<br/>
seasons.<br/>
What do cleric use?  I seem to have heard circles use.  For example, if I<br/>
was to announce myself, it would be Imogen cleric of the 25th circle...or<br/>
something like that.  What do other clerics use?<br/>
<br/>
-Imogen</div>
