<div id="ygrps-yiv-820481066">Well i have everything so far exsept the final page from Dyllin Starshine. I <br/>
was wondering if the quest is working or not, i spent the last 6 hours <br/>
camping where he was suppost to be and he never poped. i was wondering if it <br/>
os off another NPC or do i need to kill lots of smugglers to get the last <br/>
page. If anyone can help me please do<br/>
