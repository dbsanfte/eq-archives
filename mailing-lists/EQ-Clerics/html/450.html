<div id="ygrps-yiv-2029252999">I could be wrong but I think a game day is about 1.5 hours real time.  So<br/>
Mr. J Daniels account would fit into what I heard about getting someone to<br/>
level 20 in 5 hours.  This is all hear-say but I believe it.  Here is how I<br/>
heard they did it.  <br/>
<br/>
First new character is outfitted in high level equipment and kick a??<br/>
weapon.  <br/>
Then a group of 40+ characters buff the newbie; spells like Resolution,<br/>
Symbol of Naltron, Armor of Faith from a cleric.  Talisman of Altune,<br/>
Stamina, Guardian, Alacrity, Agility from a shaman.  <br/>
<br/>
Next Tanks go in on a level 20+ creature and taunt, clerics cast immobilize<br/>
and the newbie starts hitting on it.  If need be the cleric heals.  Once the<br/>
creature is under half health the high level group takes it out and the<br/>
newbie gets lots and lots of exp.    <br/>
<br/>
Of course, if the RL person behind this character hadn&#39;t played before they<br/>
have completely ruined the game for them.  <br/>
<br/>
It will be fun to test this idea out one day, but for now I need to work my<br/>
way up high.<br/>

 What did they tag team playing the character? Keep it going 24/7?<br/>

The most extreme case of twinking I have seen is making level 30 with 10<br/>
game days played.<br/>

Absolutely NO way that is true. Even with MAJOR twinking they still would<br/>
not hit well. 5 days would be an accomplishment, and 5 hours is just WAY<br/>
beyond impossible.<br/>
