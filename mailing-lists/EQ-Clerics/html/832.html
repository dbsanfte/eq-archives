<div id="ygrps-yiv-706535689">that&#39;s a very well stated opinion...i agree, it would be a good idea to keep the<br/>
lv 1 ogres out that start trains....trains in there are BAD....mass<br/>
deaths...whole groups of 18 lv 45+ either has to evac or die.......ugly ugly<br/>
trains........<br/>

&gt; And if the gate damage had been in the game from day one, would there be<br/>
&gt; complaints?  I say far less...<br/>
&gt; Should all of Norrath be available to every player from the get go?  I say<br/>
&gt; no...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hill giants and griffins kill low levels too...but we have accepted that as<br/>
&gt; part of the game.  If the damage gate had been there from day one, it would<br/>
&gt; have been more along the lines of &quot;Cool!  You can&#39;t even gate there and<br/>
&gt; survive until you are level xx!&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Brad stated the Plane of Fear was supposed to be hard, in the context of<br/>
&gt; hard for very high level characters.<br/>
&gt; May seem elitist, but I think the high level players will probably<br/>
&gt; appreciate this more than hate it...keeping the lower levels out so they can<br/>
&gt; focus on themselves and not having to save newbies that just wander in to<br/>
&gt; the Plane of Fear.  And how does that sound?  &quot;I just wandered in to the<br/>
&gt; Plane of Fear...ho hum.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And it also proves to be an achievement of sorts, being able to warp into<br/>
&gt; the Plane of Fear and survive the shock that would kill the average person.<br/>
&gt; I am all for a Plane that causes damage when you enter it...makes it more<br/>
&gt; ominous and harsh!  Is the Plane of Fear supposed to be a cake walk?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is not a flame, I am just stating a counterpoint. </span></blockquote></div>
