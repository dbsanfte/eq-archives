the quest for it themselves :)<br/>

&lt;&lt;I would like to know if any DARK ELF clerics have successfully completed the<br/>
paw of opalla or testament of vanear quests.  With my being KOS everyplace these<br/>
quests are given, it seems so difficult to complete =)  (and soooo unfair to us<br/>
evil classes that we cannot get the BEST +wis items)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been trying to find a way to complete them - would help to know if ANY<br/>
other dark elves have obtained either item =)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!&gt;&gt;</div>
