<div id="ygrps-yiv-1376503409">Haven&#39;t been to LF, but I have noticed a similiar thing in the West Commons.<br/>
More frequent spawns, ans well as different spawns.  For instance, I have<br/>
noticed quite a few more DE NPC&#39;s in that area, and have actually been<br/>
slaughtered by one of them.<br/>

I have hunted the Shrine in LF a lot and I have noticed a difference their<br/>
last night. One the mummies and skeletons (lvl 9-13)have a lot more booty. I<br/>
made several plat in an hour. HOWEVER there was a spawn variation last<br/>
night. Normally I just take them in rotation and they spawn about every 5<br/>
mins. Once last night a 2nd mummy spawned about 10 seconds after I pulled<br/>
the first. Has anyone noticed this. Personally I really like the idea as it<br/>
changed a &quot;cushy&quot; kill into a near death experience. I look forward to<br/>
hearing your thoughts.<br/>
