<b>Subject:</b> Why is fear more resisted than Flash of light <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-616558819">I reached level 9 over the weekend. I bought fear and FOL (yes lvl 1 but I<br/>
never bought it before)<br/>
<br/>
I spent 2 hours blinding myself while fishing to get my &quot;divinity&quot; *grin* up<br/>
to level 50. And then using it on a friendly Gnome wizard, same level.<br/>
Blindness is pretty successful most of the time. Succeeding 8/10 times. 6/10<br/>
being for more than 10 seconds.<br/>
<br/>
However when I use fear. I did n&#39;t do it enough times to get real statistics<br/>
but it &quot;seemed&quot; like less than 1 of 3.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone give a more accurate result? Especially as your enemy is higher in<br/>
levels.<br/>
<br/>
Also somebody on this list mentioned FOL was not that good against MOB&#39;s and<br/>
I found it very useful. If you cast it successfully and then back off. The<br/>
MOB wanders around. Very much like fear at a lower cost of Mana.<br/>
<br/>
Regards and thanks for all your feedback.<br/>
