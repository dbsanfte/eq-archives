<div id="ygrps-yiv-1716291945">I have a silly question. Been trying to figure out how <br/>
people are putting spells in there lower left hand hot key <br/>
slots. I&#39;ve tried doing it the way you put other things <br/>
there, i.e. left click and holding, but that just casts the <br/>
spell. I have also tried memming that spell to the hot keys <br/>
but that doesnt work either. I know there is something <br/>
simple I&#39;m missing so PLEASE let me know <br/>
<br/>
Thanks <br/>
