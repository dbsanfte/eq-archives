<div id="ygrps-yiv-140324677">I used scarecrows to do 19 and 20, and I am guessing give exp beyond 20.<br/>
And here is the risk free way (or it was for me).<br/>
Sense dead<br/>
run....<br/>
Root<br/>
Expluse Expulse until he breaks<br/>
spook<br/>

I found 4 or 5 expulses killed or got most very close to death. But if<br/>
you throw 3 on them you should be able to melee them into the ground.<br/>

&gt; Er I said Winsock when I meant DirectPlay.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyhow, to get back on topic... I totally agree with hunting scarecrows at<br/>
&gt; 14-17. They give great exp. They do hit hard and fast though... team up with<br/>
&gt; an Enchanter and they&#39;re easy pickings (Tashan&#39;s and Languid Pace work<br/>
&gt; wonders). I hunted them with an Enc friend and we never died once. We<br/>
&gt; started at 14(me) and 12(him) and left at 16(me) and 15(him). That area of<br/>
&gt; the W Karanas is pretty safe to med, and the odd wandering critter got<br/>
&gt; killed by his pet.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Interestingly I teamed with a L15 monk one day when the Enchanter wasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; around... found it _much_ harder. Not nearly as efficient, and the monk was<br/>
&gt; getting down there in HP.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The other thing about hunting scarecrows... it&#39;s a refreshing change - it<br/>
&gt; makes you feel like a wizard with melee ability! (root, nuke, nuke, nuke,<br/>
&gt; tank the last 1/3) :-)<br/>

&gt; &gt; Even if games run on a<br/>
&gt; &gt; LAN and not over<br/>
&gt; &gt; the internet, odds are they should support IP as well, either<br/>
&gt; &gt; because it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; not much extra code (if they&#39;re using Winsock) or because<br/>
&gt; &gt; they roll their<br/>
&gt; &gt; own BSD sockets code, equally fairly easy.<br/>
