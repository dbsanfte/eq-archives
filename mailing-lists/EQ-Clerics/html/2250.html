<div id="ygrps-yiv-1898435663">There are times when you have to choose between your own death and somebody<br/>
elses.  There are also many times when you know that going to save others is<br/>
very dangerous but you think you might be able to squeak by.   A couple of<br/>
situations....<br/>
<br/>
in your example of throwing yourself in front of a hill giant.. well I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t do that either.  I might throw the guy a heal, then run if the SG<br/>
came after me.. but taht is as close as I&#39;d come to that.   I have many<br/>
times though died to save my party or a tank...<br/>
<br/>
Just the other night, the tank of my group was pulling from the maze in<br/>
Cazic and suddenly i saw his hit points drop FAST... i ran into the maze to<br/>
find him and heal him.   In this case,   I knew it was dangerous but hoped i<br/>
could save his life and escape.  Unfortunately I got lost and was unable to<br/>
gate as the train that had him stunned and hurting poured over me.  In this<br/>
case, I made a judgement that I could save a life.  I didn&#39;t plan on dying,<br/>
but I knew the risk.. and the rest of the group escaped... I died.   These<br/>
things happen.<br/>
<br/>
there have been many other times when my group has faced a train or some<br/>
other mini disaster.. and I have died as a result of trying to heal people<br/>
enough to get them out of the zone... often i end up the last one out and<br/>
often I die for it.. again it&#39;s a judgement... you don&#39;t plan on dying, but<br/>
it&#39;s a calculated risk you take to try to help everybody survive.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, sometimes you party is in a bad fight and MOBS are on you<br/>
and everybody is tied up and having a hard time getting them off of you... I<br/>
cast a holy might and step away from my MOB.. i have time to heal myself<br/>
(down below 2 bubbles) or my tank (also nearing death)... usually in this<br/>
situation I heal myself, even though i know I don&#39;t have time to heal us<br/>
both before the MOB is on me again.  My reasoning here is that I&#39;m hoping<br/>
I&#39;ll get another chance to cast heal before the tank dies and I can get him<br/>
then... even if I don&#39;t get to heal him I am still alive and I can heal the<br/>
rest of the party wheras if I let myself die not only do I die, but that<br/>
tank dies and possibly the rest of the party as well...<br/>
<br/>
Basically I try very hard to put the best intrest of the group as a whole<br/>
first when I face those situations.    Yes, my play time is as valuable as<br/>
anybodies and I don&#39;t want to die and lose my xp, but remember... it&#39;s only<br/>
a game and it&#39;s only xp.  You will get your xp back =)   And people who you<br/>
die to save will remember that and what comes around goes around... that<br/>
favor will be returned some day.<br/>

&gt;&gt;always the last one to zone and usually do the most<br/>
&gt;&gt;dying.  But, that&#39;s my job.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I must disagree here. Even though we are healers our play time is as much<br/>
&gt;worth as any other player&#39;s playtime. Personally I won&#39;t throw myself in<br/>
&gt;front of a running giant to save someone else (literally). If I were a<br/>
&gt;paladin or good cleric maybe I could do that but only from a roleplaying<br/>
&gt;point of view. A cleric of Innoruuk should probably conclude that whoever<br/>
&gt;dies was not fit to serve Innoruuk anyway. And it can be tactically<br/>
&gt;motivated to stay alive so that you can ressurrect the others.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Unfortunetaly there are instances when we have to choose between saving the<br/>
&gt;tank and ourselves. One example is when the tank is being beaten down by a<br/>
&gt;train. As you all know healing that tank will result in an instant<br/>
&gt;train-takeover that results in our death. On one single occation this has<br/>
&gt;happened to me, and I chose not to heal the tank since I knew I would die.<br/>
&gt;We evaced instead and everyone made it out. I&#39;m interested in other views<br/>
&gt;on this matter.<br/>
