<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1622713947">I have spent the last two days fighting evil eyes in<br/>
the gorge. However, there are still a couple things<br/>
that puzzle me. I was really hoping someone could<br/>
enlighten me. :)<br/>
<br/>
1) Charm, does cancel magic work on it or not? I have<br/>
tried casting several times with mied results.<br/>
Sometimes it seems to cancel it sometimes it does not.<br/>
All of my party members had only endure magic on, so<br/>
the second dispell should have theoretically worked,<br/>
but sometimes it did not. What gives?<br/>
<br/>
2) When charmed, I thought you could not use your<br/>
skills/spells. This seemed to be the case until late<br/>
last night when a 28th cater was charmed and then<br/>
proceeded to kill me in three casts. I also lost about<br/>
a half a bubble of exp from this PC death. I later<br/>
asked the caster and she said that she was killed me<br/>
by a spell that was memorized in the 6th slot, not the<br/>
8th slot like some peeple think. Her 8th slot was a<br/>
gate. <br/>
<br/>
So, what gives?? I think correct information would<br/>
come in handy in later levels. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks!!!<br/>
