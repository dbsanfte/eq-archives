<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I  play a lvl 31 DE Cleric on Erollisi Marr.  Now my faction is good in<br/>
Highpass/Highkeep since I levelled from 18-29 almost constantly in those<br/>
two zones..   My faction in Qeynos isn&#39;t brilliant..  I&#39;m not attacked<br/>
but I can only sell to Tubal Weaver (who I guess has Highpass Faction<br/>
not Qeynos)  Everyone else refuses to sell to me.  I guess I need to<br/>
kill more gnolls (yawn).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway I have just completed the Testament of Vanear quest yesterday and<br/>
only need the gold ring for the paw quest.  So it is definately possible<br/>
for us to do it.  Though I have been of the habit of trying to up my<br/>
factions in all cities I can since I know how much of a pain it would be<br/>
having to go back to Neriak to sell each time.<br/>
<br/>
Out of the two cities I would probably work on your faction in<br/>
Highpass/HighKeep first.. since by doing so you are also upping your<br/>
faction with Corrupt Qeynos Guards (and possibly the normal Qeynos<br/>
guards but I can&#39;t be sure on that)<br/>
<br/>
Just kill orcs/gnolls until the guards let you in.. took me a few days<br/>
to get enough faction to be able to sell there..<br/>
<br/>
For the paw quest you don&#39;t really need good faction at all.. it is all<br/>
completable without having to go into any big city that you would get<br/>
killed in.. You have to go under one.. but as long as you manage to<br/>
sneak into the Qeynos aquaducts via the hidden entrance you don&#39;t need<br/>
to enter the city..  Also get a teleport to Tox forest when it comes to<br/>
camping Mitty it would be worth the cost.. fast and no sneaking through<br/>
Erudin/Qeynos..<br/>
