<div id="ygrps-yiv-1892488321">I have a lvl 4.9 dwarven cleric on Brel and was wondering about the Bind afiinity spell as well as Gate.  If I bind someone (once I get that spell), can they unbind themselves, or do they remain bound to the new location forever? Also, if I bind myself somewhere and then gate, where do I go, Butcherblock or my Bind Affinity location?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!</div>
