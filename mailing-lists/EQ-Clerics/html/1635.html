<div id="ygrps-yiv-1583028124">Actually a little known fact about EQ is that it&#39;s almost entirely CPU<br/>
limited.<br/>
<br/>
I was running a PIII450 with 256M ram and a Matrox G400 and getting<br/>
exceptionally low frame rates in places like unrest and cazic, then I<br/>
upgraded JUST my cpu to a PIII 600, and have no frame rate problems<br/>
whatsoever.  The problem is in the way they handle their server side<br/>
potentially visible set computations.  They can&#39;t store a conventional<br/>
server side PVS like normal 16 or 32 player network games, because it would<br/>
be far to computationally intensive (and requrie some pretty insane server<br/>
side hardware) to compute for 1500-2000people constantly.  Because of this,<br/>
their PVS is handled using a very simple spherical relevancy system - if<br/>
someone is in your relevant sphere, then the server considers them to be<br/>
relevant to your client and sends it over - not really a network problem,<br/>
just tons and tons of extra particles/etc for the physics and interpolation<br/>
subsystems on the client to think about.  This compounds in small or densely<br/>
packed zones like unrest and cazic because almost everything in the zone<br/>
becomes relevant to you, so your machine is having to think about almost<br/>
everything.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;well are there any ways to increase are framerate or get patches which will<br/>
&gt;emhance are cards to keep up and handle the frame rates. I have a voodoo<br/>
&gt;banshee which i hate and was wondering if a voodoo 3 3000 is alot better. I<br/>
&gt;do not know much about graphic cards but if i can get some review saying<br/>
&gt;that voodoo 3 is way way better then my banshee on handleing stuff i might<br/>
&gt;just buy it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;thx for the info on lag so far<br/>
