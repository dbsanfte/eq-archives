<b>Subject:</b> Re: Can a cleric solo to 50? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-42652065">I think pretty much any class could solo to level 50 if you didn&#39;t mind the down<br/>
times (except mabye rogues).  I&#39;m not sure why anyone would want to though as it<br/>
would get very boring.<br/>
<br/>
A cleric would have to stick to undead most of the time as our live dd spells <br/>
are really bad, especially in the low 40&#39;s when your still useing wrath.  I <br/>
didn&#39;t personally solo at all until I hit level 47 when I could pull spectres <br/>
solo so really don&#39;t know what i&#39;m talking about :)<br/>
<br/>
As for the cleric armor, the only quest I have done is the weapon.  Imo the <br/>
quest armor isn&#39;t very good at all and not worth the time or money it takes to <br/>
get it, but that&#39;s just my opinion.<br/>
