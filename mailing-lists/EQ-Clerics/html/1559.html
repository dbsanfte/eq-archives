<div id="ygrps-yiv-449178355"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; just so you KNOW why this is people...and he IS right....it will save much<br/>
&gt; more than GAMES!!! This lil puppy will go and detect when you are &quot;idle&quot;<br/>
&gt; and at such deemed times will then INDEX your whole frigging hard drive.<br/>
&gt; Idle times can be ANY times the hard drive is not active.....it can be<br/>
&gt; random times during the day....it can be any time the program basically<br/>
&gt; deems not enough activity is going on....and sometimes this is when games<br/>
&gt; have loaded everything into memory and are not bothering to touch the hard<br/>
&gt; drive. the loading constantly causes your slow down ALOT.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is the same as Internet Explorers concept of disconnecting when &#39;the<br/>
connection is no longer needed&#39;. ie (scuse the pun) when IE isnt using it.<br/>
So unless Office is doing something with your HDD anyway, it assumes it<br/>
isn&#39;t being used at all. After all, why would any Win9x PC use anything<br/>
except MS software?<br/>
