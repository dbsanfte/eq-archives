&gt; Can you tell me how you think you made it so fast. IS it because you only<br/>
&gt; attacked &quot;gambles&quot; or do some MOBs give better experience?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I think all same level monsters give same experience. Might be<br/>
small bonuses for casters, poisoning ones and only hit by magic<br/>
weapon ones etc. But probably very minor. What people don&#39;t<br/>
often remember is that every second off battle causes every second<br/>
in battle to have only half xp/time. Even if you kill that white/yellow<br/>
every 5mins it probably won&#39;t compare to killing 2 high blues. But<br/>
depends with what class you play. As bard I could almost totally<br/>
eliminate down time if I found a suitable area and wanted to. I can<br/>
first melee a mob down, if taken damage start next one by kiting<br/>
and healing at the same time, so forth. I mostly either took blue<br/>
after blue after blue (even greens that gave exp), or kited 3<br/>
any xp giving monsters up to yellows around.. at the same time =P<br/>
But finding places with enough bard-kitable monsters is hard.<br/>
<br/>
  For cleric, as low levels the classes don&#39;t have HUGE differences<br/>
in melee ability, get a great weapon and start doing blues, preferably<br/>
undead of course, with the occasional spell thrown in for damage.<br/>
Bit higher up maybe high blues with spells and melee mix. I doubt<br/>
soloing yellows is really that great for anyone but the pet classes,<br/>
which actually are a group of 2. And probably they would also be<br/>
better off with mowing down blues, where you can rely more on pet<br/>
and have much less downtime.<br/>
<br/>
  All of above said without any experience in playing a cleric, so<br/>
I suggest you to ignore it, or try it out and test and give results<br/>
how it goes. No idea if it works for clerics =)<br/>
