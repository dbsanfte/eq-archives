<div id="ygrps-yiv-950558974">that&#39;s not totally true....you can melee....and you and dd....if there&#39;s more<br/>
then one cleric in the group and you&#39;re in an undead dungeon, one of you might<br/>
be dd&#39;ing....just my thoughts on the matter...<br/>

&gt; Okay, I am now lvl 10 and really concerned about this.  From what EVERYONE<br/>
&gt; tells me (which I totally disagree with and the whole subject matter makes<br/>
&gt; me sick) is that when older (25+) all we do is heal...no melee, no DD, just<br/>
&gt; heal and med.  First...is that true or can we still melee..I know we won&#39;t<br/>
&gt; exactly be able to solo melee...but as in a group or possibly as the only<br/>
&gt; tank?..and while on that subject, can we solo undead up into all our higher<br/>
&gt; lvls or do we still need help then too?  And finally the mana issue.  I am<br/>
&gt; dwarven cleric and have a 100 in strength and 103 in wisdom...will that be a<br/>
&gt; high enough wisdom to have proper mana to heal my group and such?  Any other<br/>
&gt; tips would be most helpful.<br/>

&gt; P.S.  Any good cleric websites with detailed spell descriptions (like how<br/>
&gt; much damage our spells deal, how much HPs our healing spells heal, and the<br/>
&gt; exact numbers on our buffs, etc)<br/>
