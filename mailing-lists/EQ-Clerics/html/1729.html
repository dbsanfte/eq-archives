<b>Subject:</b> RE: Paw of Opalla and Desperate request for aid. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1222369010">The Paw will *NEVER* be &quot;a dime a dozen.&quot;  The gold ring is next to<br/>
impossible to get.  I have been trying to get one for myself and auctioning<br/>
for one for at least 2 months with no success.<br/>
<br/>
As for your problem with where to fight, I would suggest Aviaks or Crocs.<br/>
You will get good exp and not die as often.  Personally I LOVED Unrest from<br/>
level 16 to 25 and did not die very often, but you have to get a good group<br/>
to be successful there.  And do NOT pull there, go into a room and camp it<br/>
unless there are less than 30 people in the zone.<br/>

&gt; So basically those of us who still have to rely on Smiting are screwed....<br/>
&gt; bloody HELL...  Was hoping that this might be an item I could possibly<br/>
&gt; get...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Add in the fact that now everyone knows about the quest ....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; by the time i manage to get the Paw they&#39;ll be a dime a dozen like<br/>
&gt; bloodforge hammers....  so much for having a semi rare item...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve already wasted 10PP trying to get p34 for the Testament as well...<br/>
&gt; but I&#39;m dubious to him so I doubt I&#39;m gonna get anything...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ok, new topic....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Where can a 21st level Cleric(human) possibly go to get some XP...   I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; sooo tired of pull and kill in Permafrost and Unrest... with the all the<br/>
&gt; deaths I&#39;m barely gaining XP....  I lose like 3/4 to a full bub of XP<br/>
&gt; everytime I die... I&#39;ve been a half a bub from 22 three times now<br/>
&gt; and RIGHT<br/>
&gt; now I&#39;m at less than a bub into 21...  for level 20 I could hunt<br/>
&gt; scarecrows<br/>
&gt; to make up for the XP I lost in Perma... but now I get jack from em...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve tried the undead at lake rathe, but it&#39;s usually camped like<br/>
&gt; high holy<br/>
&gt; hell and everyone is so freakin obsessive there...  I accidently Expulse a<br/>
&gt; db some guy is walking towards and he chews my head off for 20 minutes on<br/>
&gt; shout... telling everyone I&#39;m a KSer...  right, sure, a freakin CLERIC<br/>
&gt; KSing... HAHAHAHAHA<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Help Please!   getting SO frustrated.... </span></blockquote></div>
