<b>Subject:</b> tanks and cleric only weapons <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-531953241">You know, it&#39;s funny.  We have this thread about being a tank vs.<br/>
being a healer as a cleric, and then we see this cleric only weapon<br/>
and it basically screams, &quot;be a tank!&quot;  I mean, yaulp III, and the<br/>
stats are mightily impressive.  So, it would seem that Verant wants<br/>
us to be a tank.  Otherwise, it would have had moderate damage but<br/>
like some really good effect like the cleanse effect of the SSOL but<br/>
have like +20 wisdom or something impressive.<br/>

&gt;Even if I was given the opportunity to loot that weapon, I probably <br/>
&gt;wouldn&#39;t.<br/>
&gt;The only reason I might loot it is for the novelty or for trade- isn&#39;t it <br/>
&gt;no<br/>
&gt;drop?  If so, there goes that thought.  I&#39;ll take my Charred Guardian <br/>
&gt;Shield and<br/>
&gt;soon completed Paw anyday over that weapon.  Wow, a whole what- maybe 60 <br/>
&gt;pts of<br/>
&gt;damage to something that has 2K-5K hitpoints?  If it had some +wis like the<br/>
&gt;shaman or druid only weapons (those in the game and being implemented), <br/>
&gt;then<br/>
&gt;maybe.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Oh well, I don&#39;t really need a weapon anyway, but thanks for thinking of us<br/>
&gt;Verant.  Oh, wait a minute..... you think clerics are so balanced that you <br/>
&gt;don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;want to give us weapon that may help us do our job?  You&#39;re right on class<br/>
&gt;balance, but never mind the thanks :)<br/>
