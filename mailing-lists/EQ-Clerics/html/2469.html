<b>Subject:</b> Gator Leggings? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1363686722">I am trying to get some gator leggings on Erollisi Marr.<br/>
<br/>
I am willing to buy or trade but I have yet to meet anyone with a reasonable<br/>
offer.<br/>
<br/>
What would be a good plat amount for them, and what would be a reasonable<br/>
trade for them?<br/>
<br/>
I have heard they go for 600 plat. I also tried trading a plat armband and a<br/>
Black Pearl Choker, and the guy would even return my replys.<br/>
<br/>
I do have a extra charred guardian shield, but I do not feel that it should<br/>
be a straight trade (leggings for shield).<br/>
<br/>
Any help is (as always) greatly appreciated,<br/>
<br/>
