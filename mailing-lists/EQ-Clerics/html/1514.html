<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-73003706">I have been having the exact same problem in Unrest myself.  I&#39;m currently <br/>
17th, and was hunting with a group my level and our pulls seemed to be <br/>
grabbing way to much.  And there were about 60 people in the zone at the time <br/>
so it wasn&#39;t like the house was exactly empty.  I was talking to one of my <br/>
friend about this and he said they increased the agro radius of undead <br/>
creatures.  This seems to be what has been happening.  As a novice of mine, I <br/>
was training alot of decaying skeletons across Everfrost because if you <br/>
attack one, it seems like everyone around for a *huge* radius would come and <br/>
join the fight.<br/>
