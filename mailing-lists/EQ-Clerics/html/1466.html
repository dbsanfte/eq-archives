<b>Subject:</b> bands of Tunare <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1047592409">I found an item on EQitem called &#39;bands of tunare&#39; that is an armband.<br/>
Stats are AC 1, wis +1, mana +2, save vs. fire -5.  It lists the loc<br/>
as being a Surefall quest.  Although, I can&#39;t find any information as<br/>
to which quest, or if these items even exist.  I would like to get a<br/>
pair of them (preferring the +2 wisdom over the benefits of AC 3<br/>
leather bracers).  If anyone has information on them, I (and perhaps<br/>
others on this list) would greatly appreciate it.</div>
