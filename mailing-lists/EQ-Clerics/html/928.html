&gt; Bahhh..by Karana&#39;s tears, i do so LOVE listening to the mushroom picking<br/>
&gt; Dark Elves speak about all their gods&#39; death and evil, when they often find<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ah. Our God Innoruk does not forbid us from using you guys when the result<br/>
is destruction and death more than we could do on our own. Sometimes it is<br/>
even His will that we heal you that you might serve his purposes longer before<br/>
you die.<br/>

If you do not serve Innoruk, then do not presume to understand his will.</div>
