<b>Subject:</b> RE: factions for shining star: <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-58400">If you attempt to get the SSOL (Shining Star of Light)  You need faction<br/>
good with only the Qeynos (Rodcet Nife) Clerics.  I&#39;m one of Mithaniel&#39;s<br/>
(Marr).  So naturally they didnt accept me....I got the factions up in these<br/>
ways.(this WILL work currently, they fixed most faction quests)<br/>
<br/>
There is a wandering brother, wanders newbie area and goes up along platform<br/>
to the &quot;Ufo.&quot;<br/>
Give him 2 bone chips and he will heal you, and increase faction with Rodcet<br/>
Nife Priests of Life.<br/>
(I bought a slew of chips :)<br/>
<br/>
Also:  Hail the 3 priest on right. (should be 2 guys one girl)  and he will<br/>
ask you to deliver blessed oil.  Take the blessed oil to the brother in<br/>
Karanas, go out the exit of Qeynos hills on the path to High Hold.  You&#39;ll<br/>
see a Tree jut outside the path, USUALLY the brother (estelle) will be right<br/>
there.  if he isnt:  hang a left. there should be some house to the left,<br/>
he&#39;s usually right in front of a house there.  hand him the oil, and you&#39;ll<br/>
get a faction increase.  He will sometimes give a 2nd quest in return (gave<br/>
me it alot after i got to indifferent)<br/>
<br/>
I continued this till I was amiable (the blessed oil and bone chips)  and<br/>
then did the brother Hayle quest....taking the prayer beads estelle gave me<br/>
to the high priestess he mentions (it flies by so scroll back) and then<br/>
running to split paw and handing them over.  (I was lvl 21 when I did this<br/>
so nothing attacked me)<br/>
<br/>
I did this quest because:<br/>
<br/>
There is a priest when you first walk into the temple on the left.  (name<br/>
begins with an A) You can tell if you can do the SSOL quest if you hail him,<br/>
and continue along the lines of going out to take the word of rodcet nife<br/>
(there is a quest for near and far, forget exact wording)  the one is a<br/>
quest for the clothspinner sisters, which is level restricted, and the other<br/>
is a cure for a guy in west karanas, if he asks you to help with this cure,<br/>
you can now do the quest.  if not....you&#39;ll just waste your honey jum :( (I<br/>
wasted 3 learning this, had friends holding them ;)<br/>
<br/>
For honeyjum...kill bixies in rivervale.  get 3 honeycombs, walk into a hut<br/>
to the RIGHT of the tavern. (circlular brown hut with rogue guild) and a<br/>
woman there will make it for you.  (the priest in qeynos gives her name)<br/>
Give her 3 honeycombs, 5 gp and she (regardless of faction) will hand over<br/>
the honey jum.  (I was &quot;eyes you with apprehension&quot;)  take this jum to the<br/>
priest on the left in qeynos who gives the quest, he will give you a potion<br/>
in return (jum AND potion are lore)<br/>
<br/>
Take this potion to the guy he indicated in the karanas,  he&#39;s along the<br/>
shore line in West Karanas, so its a quick walk.  hand this guy the potion<br/>
(he even says he&#39;s sick) and he will thank you, and give a rusty scythe<br/>
which is lore.  Take this scythe back to the same priest (first one on left<br/>
side) and he will give you the SSOL.<br/>
<br/>
Now....as I said....EVEN IF FACTION IS AMIABLE IN QEYNOS WITH PRIESTS OF<br/>
LIFE....CHECK TO MAKE SURE HE WILL GIVE YOU THE QUEST.  I&#39;m amiable...but<br/>
had to get REAL close to &quot;warmly&quot;  in order to even GET the quest.  I know<br/>
some Qeynos clerics who can even get the quest!!!!!  He kept saying I needed<br/>
to prove myself to Rodcet Nife.....after I did the brother Hayle quest<br/>
(prayer beads after blessed oil) I seemed to prove myself....and I&#39;ve gotten<br/>
2 SSOL&#39;s so far :)  (Currently using it too)<br/>
<br/>
6/28,  cleric paly only, and effect is CLEANSE (removes poison and<br/>
dieseases)<br/>
<br/>
Bann Sidhe<br/>
<br/>
24th cleric, fennin ro <br/>

At your level, the best 2 choices are the Shining Star of Light<br/>
or the Bloodforge hammer.  Of course, you could just continue to use<br/>
the hammer of wrath, too.<br/>
<br/>
To get the shining star of light requires real good Qeynos Priest of<br/>
Life faction (and of course for you to journey to Qeynos).  Be sure<br/>
to read this quest first (it is a qeynos-based quest).  The SSOL is<br/>
a decent 1h weapon that is 6/28, weighs 5 pounds, I think, and casts<br/>
&#39;cleanse&#39;, which removes negative effects.<br/>
<br/>
The Bloodforge hammer is also a Qeynos quest (kind of).  This is what<br/>
I did, while I was in Qeynos increased my PriestsofLife faction by<br/>
doing the blessed oil quest, I found Trumpy Irontoe near the docks<br/>
and killed him (green to me at 12th), and got his head. Be warned, as<br/>
this will seriously lower your faction with some groups in Qeynos.<br/>
The BF hammer is 13/50 2h and adds +10 to saves vs. magic.  It weighs<br/>
10 pounds.  This quest is a Kaladim quest, and you need to be amiable<br/>
with the stormguard(I think) in Kaladim - the dwarven fighter guild.<br/>
I think killing Crushbone orcs raises that faction, so I didn&#39;t even<br/>
have to work on it, it was already amiable when I got there (Kaladim).<br/>
<br/>
I have both of these weapons.  I&#39;m trying to increase my 2h skill, but<br/>
I switch to the SSOL when the going gets tough!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ergo 13th level high elf cleric on test server<br/>
<br/>

&gt;I&#39;m a level 10 cleric and have enjoyed the journey.  I wanted to be a <br/>
&gt;purely caster cleric so I put 130 points into Wisdom. My strength however <br/>
&gt;is only 60 which means that I can&#39;t equip the stronger heavier armor. <br/>
&gt;That&#39;s okay, I fully expected this, however does anyone know of a good 2 <br/>
&gt;handed or 1 handed weapon that is not very heavy.  I prefer it not to be <br/>
&gt;over 10 pounds, lighter if possible.  Any suggestions would be helpful.<br/>
<br/>
