<div id="ygrps-yiv-1721083677">I found Maugrim by sheer luck: after checking the island out, I camped and<br/>
when I logged in the next day Maugrim was standing right in front of me.<br/>
Was a helluva fight to kill though (I&#39;m level 30).<br/>
<br/>
FWIW, I&#39;ve heard other folks say you have to clear the island of the<br/>
WANDERING necros to get Maugrim to spawn.<br/>

&gt; Hello All!  This is my first post to this forum.  I have been reading<br/>
emails<br/>
&gt; on this list for some time now, and I have found much valuable information<br/>
&gt; here.  My thanks to all for my increased knowledge.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am trying to complete the cleric armor quest for the greaves.  I already<br/>
&gt; have the ingot, but I need to find the icon.  The quest info I have<br/>
&gt; indicates that I must kill the erudite Maugrim who spawns in Kerra Ridge<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; the necro isle.  I have been there and I have not found Maugrim.  Does<br/>
&gt; anyone have more details as to where Maugrim spawns, or how to get it to<br/>
&gt; spawn?  I would greatly appreciate any information you may have.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thank you!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
