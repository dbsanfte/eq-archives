Regarding 1HB vs. 2HB - At your level I would stay with the 1HB skill if you<br/>
have not trained at all in 2HB.  Reasoning will be that your melee is going<br/>
to significantly decrease as your levels progress.  Also, work on trying to<br/>
get a charred guardian shield as soon as you can (+9 wis).  Also there are<br/>
some +wis 1HB weapons that you will be able to obtain once you get a little<br/>
higher in levels.  (Tainted Battleworm morningstar = +6 wis)  If you MUST<br/>
use a 2HB make sure to keep your 1HB skill up if possible.<br/>
<br/>
Regarding Taunts - Taunt skill takes time to build up to be effective.  The<br/>
best anti-taunt a cleric has when getting the crap beat out of him/her is<br/>
Divine Aura.  Just cast DA and usually the mob will head back to the tank.<br/>
=)  If not.. this is a good time to start running!<br/>
