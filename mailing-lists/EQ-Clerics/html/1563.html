<div id="ygrps-yiv-1886635006">I have experienced the same, incredibly annoying &quot;pauses&quot; when travelling through zones.  I will simply just stop for several seconds, then start up again.  This happens constantly, not just once or twice, to where my group loses me, and it takes forever to travel long distances.  Also, I have experienced graphic problems where the person I&#39;m following simply vanishes, or shows he goes in a different direction.  Very very annoying.<br/>
