<div id="ygrps-yiv-1114632304">I got on test at lunch today, and I don&#39;t know if this was applied to<br/>
the production servers yet, but it said that they have added a way to<br/>
move the spell icons around in the spell book.  So, while they have<br/>
twinked some things, they have made some better.  I personally am<br/>
really looking forward to checking this out.  I would love to be able<br/>
to group spells in a more logical order than what they are in right<br/>
now.</div>
