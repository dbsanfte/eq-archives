<b>Subject:</b> Testament of Vanear - hint for Dark Elf Clerics  *small spoiler* <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1729453">For those of us that are Dark Elf clerics - it looks as if it is still possible to get the Testament of Vanear - despite being disliked in Erudin and Qeynos.   You will need friends to help you though.<br/>
<br/>
When the quest starts in Erudin, you (or a friend of yours if you have someone) will be given a book, with slots and a combine button.  You search for the missing pages (or get a nice friend to help you) and put the pages in the book.   So, it appears that the Testament of Vanear is NOT formed until you combine the items in the book.  If you have a friend willing to get the items for you - a dark elf should in theory be able to get this no drop quest item - just don&#39;t let your friend *combine* them.  You must do that. (*note - the information I had did not say if the book or pages used to combine were no drop - if anyone knows that they are, please let me know) <br/>
<br/>
I have not tried this myself - but I think I will :)  Hopefully it will work!! <br/>
