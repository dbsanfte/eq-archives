<div id="ygrps-yiv-668368283">If you start molding yourself as a pure caster below level 30 and stay totally<br/>
out of combat, you&#39;d better be prepared to die a lot when you get up to the 40s.<br/>
You need to keep up your denfense skill or just about everything will hit you,<br/>
and hit you hard.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not advocating being a partial tank, just let those MOBs agro on you a bit<br/>
every now and then after you heal.  Or if it&#39;s just one MOB, stun it then start<br/>
whacking away (80%+ mana) and then let it hit you a couple times.  Also, it can<br/>
be fun at higher levels to whip out that mace and whack on something for a bit,<br/>
even if all you are really doing is nocking the flies off it&#39;s back :)<br/>
<br/>
I personally feel that you should not disregard any attribute that you can.  The<br/>
only thing that&#39;s not maxxed for me is my 2HB (not used since level 4),<br/>
divinate, conjuration, and conjuration specialization skills.  These are slowly<br/>
getting up there, but it takes forever if you neglect them for awhile.<br/>
<br/>
If I can find a +18 wis 2HB weapon, I just might give it a try LOL!<br/>
