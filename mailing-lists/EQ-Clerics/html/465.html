<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1178668118">ok....on lv 34, you get word of health, which is a group heal....heals<br/>
around the same as healing, but is ae and uses more mana.....but what<br/>
i&#39;m wondering, isn&#39;t there an upgrade called word of healing which does<br/>
the same thing only with a better heal? i&#39;ve checked my spell list over<br/>
and over, and heard a lv 50 cleric in my guild say something about it,<br/>
but just wondering where do i get it? i haven&#39;t looked for the lv 44<br/>
spells yet, but will probably go to freeport to get them....has anyone<br/>
seen that in the temple of marr there?<br/>
