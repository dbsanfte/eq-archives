<div id="ygrps-yiv-661027159">Where is a good place for a Lvl 18 Cleric and a Lvl 18 Monk to go get good<br/>
exp and good loot?  As of now we&#39;re in Lake Rathe but haven&#39;t gotten to the<br/>
good stuff yet cause it was daytime.  But I&#39;m not to sure we want to take<br/>
the trip back over just to go to Unrest right now, maybe in a few days but I<br/>
think we kinda wanna stay on the side we&#39;re on till maybe Lvl 19 or 20.<br/>
We&#39;re wanting a place to get Lvls kinda fast at least till 20 but it doesn&#39;t<br/>
matter to me how fast we move up in lvls right now just want a place we can<br/>
get exp.<br/>
