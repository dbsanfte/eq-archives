<div id="ygrps-yiv-765026324">What do you mean, in an intelligent manner?  What manner is that?  I<br/>
am 19th, and before I bought my banded armor, I had 98 plat in the<br/>
bank and some change.  I have 8 greater lightstones in a backpack that<br/>
I can sell to the gypsies for around 72 plat.  That put me at around<br/>
170 plat.<br/>
  The most profitable thing at 15th level is either bronze weapons or<br/>
greater lighstones.  Both of which are semi-rare.  These are the only<br/>
things that I can think of.  You can kill the occasional gem dropping mob in <br/>
Faydwar, Pixies, or Drakes, or those winged-women things in<br/>
Steamfont, but even those aren&#39;t that valuable or very common.<br/>
  The only other thing I can think of is that you are doing quests and<br/>
then auctioning the items.  Like doing the Shining Star of Light quest<br/>
over and over again and then selling it for 50 pp a pop or something.<br/>
I suppose it might fetch that much on a production server, certainly<br/>
not on Test.  Seems like the demand would run low, and most newbies<br/>
simply can&#39;t afford that much.<br/>
Beyond that, I can not thing of any normal means to acquire 4000 plat<br/>
by the time you reach 15th level.  It is inconceivable.<br/>
  You talk like it is common knowledge that everyone should have 4000<br/>
plat by the time they are 15th level.  That&#39;s just absurd.<br/>
<br/>
  A friend of mine stayed up all night once and killed wisps on wisp<br/>
isle.  He sold all the greater lightstones to the gypsy camp and ended<br/>
up making around 800 plat.  It took him nearly a day to do that.  He<br/>
was 20th level.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Very profitable way to hunt?  Sounds like you&#39;re exploiting to me.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt;don&#39;t know any 15th level anythings that can shell out the 1000+ pp<br/>
&gt; &gt;for an observer staff.  That&#39;s a lot of greater lightstones and bronze<br/>
&gt; &gt;spears.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Can be done and has been done in the past, without use of exploits.<br/>
&gt;Aosinator had amassed almost 4000pp by the time she was level 15, and it<br/>
&gt;was by using her proceeds in an intelligent manner.  Don&#39;t point the<br/>
&gt;accusatory finger at someone until ye know all the facts.<br/>
