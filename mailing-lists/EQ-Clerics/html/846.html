&gt; ok i have a question, when i first joined this list i was told not to just<br/>
&gt; simply reply to a message, that i must first delete the thread.  Since<br/>
 </span></blockquote>then<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; i have done as asked, but alot of ppl are replying to messages without<br/>
&gt; deleting the threads, while i understand the reason, NOW, for deleting the<br/>
&gt; thread,i do not understand why others don&#39;t delete as well?  i am a little<br/>
&gt; miffed about this as it was not asked nicely of me, well maybe i took it<br/>
&gt; wrong, but just the same, if i have to delete the threads then why does<br/>
&gt; everyone else not have to.  Also i was adding color to the message as i<br/>
&gt; thought it looked better and was told not to do that as well!!  oh well i<br/>
&gt; was just wondering why i was told to do so and since then i have seen many<br/>
&gt; long messages by others.  err ppl i am not slamming anyone i am just<br/>
 </span></blockquote>asking<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Not sure what oyu mean by deleting the thread. If you were told to delete<br/>
everything in a reply message - this is simply wrong IMO! If you do not<br/>
quote the message or parts of the message that you are replying to we have<br/>
no way of knowing who and what you are talking about then. What you don&#39;t<br/>
want to do (according to some who can get extremely picky and shallow) is<br/>
quote the whole thread that has 10 others responses added to yours.<br/>
<br/>
I just deleted the garbage that gets added to your post and replied. But I<br/>
left what you said here so others could see what I was responding to.<br/>
<br/>
I really don&#39;t mind how you do it :)  I read everything and it really isn&#39;t<br/>
all that bad. Some complain because they pay for this - I say to them,  go<br/>
to a forum and read where it wont cost you then. Some say they dont have the<br/>
time to wade thru all the garbage to get to the reply - then dont! But they<br/>
sure have the time to carry on a thread of the do&#39;s and don&#39;ts of an e-mail<br/>
list and complain every chance they get :)  Don&#39;t sweat the small stuff -<br/>
you&#39;ll live longer :)</div>
