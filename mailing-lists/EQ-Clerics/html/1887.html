<div id="ygrps-yiv-2106323378">Hate to discourage you, but at higher levels, you will melee VERY little.<br/>
Your value is healing and buffing.  And the damage you will be able to do<br/>
against high level mobs is very minimal.  You will be fighting mobs with<br/>
1000s of hps at high levels, and a lot of them have very high magic<br/>
resistance, so your spells are useless cause they are resisted most always.<br/>
And these mobs hit HARD...some for over 100 hps damage a pop.  You can&#39;t<br/>
survive at melee with these mobs, only the big tanks can.  You serve one<br/>
purpose mainly, and that is healing to keep everyone alive. Regarding<br/>
undead,  clerics used to be able to solo specs quite easily with undead<br/>
spells, but they changed the pathing of them at the spec cave in Feerott and<br/>
now it&#39;s dangerous cause you can&#39;t really pull them solo anymore.  You pull<br/>
one and two or three come, and that&#39;s BAD news.<br/>
<br/>
Regarding the mana issue....you will need to get your hands on as many<br/>
wisdom enhancing items as you can, because you will need all the mana you<br/>
can get to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of your healing powers.<br/>
The more mana you have the longer you can keep your group alive and the less<br/>
med time you have.  So start amassing those wisdom items and try to get your<br/>
wisdom at least up into the 170s minimum.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to disillusion you, but high levels clerics are relegated mostly to<br/>
healing and buffing and medding.  That&#39;s what your specialty is and at those<br/>
levels, the other healing classes can&#39;t come close to our healing powers<br/>
with our superior and complete heal.  The good news is that no high level<br/>
group ventures anywhere without at least one good cleric.  YOu are a MUST<br/>
have.<br/>

&gt; Okay, I am now lvl 10 and really concerned about this.  From what EVERYONE<br/>
&gt; tells me (which I totally disagree with and the whole subject matter makes<br/>
&gt; me sick) is that when older (25+) all we do is heal...no melee, no DD,<br/>
just<br/>
&gt; heal and med.  First...is that true or can we still melee..I know we won&#39;t<br/>
&gt; exactly be able to solo melee...but as in a group or possibly as the only<br/>
&gt; tank?..and while on that subject, can we solo undead up into all our<br/>
higher<br/>
&gt; lvls or do we still need help then too?  And finally the mana issue.  I am<br/>
&gt; dwarven cleric and have a 100 in strength and 103 in wisdom...will that be<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; high enough wisdom to have proper mana to heal my group and such?  Any<br/>
other<br/>
&gt; tips would be most helpful.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; P.S.  Any good cleric websites with detailed spell descriptions (like how<br/>
&gt; much damage our spells deal, how much HPs our healing spells heal, and the<br/>
&gt; exact numbers on our buffs, etc)<br/>
