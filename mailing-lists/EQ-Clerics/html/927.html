<div id="ygrps-yiv-1733291419">You realize, if you dont like the buffs someone gives you you can left<br/>
click on their icon and it will remove the effect??  Just do that if you<br/>
are &#39;Rping&#39;.   (No it doesnt work against negative effects like root. :)<br/>
).<br/>

&gt; &gt;     No immature is when you give a player all your buffs just becuase they<br/>
&gt; &gt;wanted to RP and didn&#39;t want your help and yes it does ruin the Rping<br/>
&gt; &gt;enviroment. And we are not going ot turn this into some kind of  blown out<br/>
&gt; &gt;argument just becuase you think that my life is this game. </span></blockquote></div>
