<div id="ygrps-yiv-1459730354">Hello Fellow Druids,<br/>
<br/>
I recently just abandoned my 17th level cleric for a wood elf druid, who is <br/>
level 8 now.  Sure, others want a cleric around (haven&#39;t had too much <br/>
problem finding a group with my cleric, although there sure were some really <br/>
&quot;dry&quot; nights when finding a group was concerned), but I personally found <br/>
that they just want you to heal, med, heal, med, and so on, even in the <br/>
midst of battle.  At lower levels, when a cleric can still dish out <br/>
comparable damage to other low level fighters, a cleric stepping into the <br/>
fray and meleeing is fine.  However, at high levels, if the tanks need to <br/>
pull you off monsters because you meleeed (and the damage you do is nothing <br/>
compared to anyone else, anyway), groups get seriously ticked off at you.  <br/>
Perhaps I was just playing the wrong class, but, as far as I&#39;m concerned, <br/>
groups want a cleric for strictly performing duties that I really don&#39;t care <br/>
to perform full time.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m only a level 8 druid so far, but I really enjoy the druid much more.  <br/>
I&#39;m really looking forward to the spells that will ease the frustrations of <br/>
the game, such as travelling.<br/>

&gt;Hail all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I hate to admit this but im having trouble finding groups to play with... <br/>
&gt;It<br/>
&gt;seems that everyone wants a lvl 14 or so cleric cos they can heal more, and<br/>
&gt;admittedly i have problems keeping up with the damage that creatures a few<br/>
&gt;lvls higher than me can dish out (being only able to heal 30 a pop).  so i<br/>
&gt;was wondering if anyone knows of a good hunting place i could check out at<br/>
&gt;lvl 12 and 13 (one bar left till 13 woo).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;thanks<br/>
