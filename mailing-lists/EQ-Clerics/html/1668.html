<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 	&gt;Aye the book is the highest wis item in the game.  I just have a problem <br/>
	&gt;holding it... I dont like it.  I like a  damn shield!  I am a  Cleric by the <br/>
	&gt;Gods not a damn MU!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well you&#39;re a priest, what&#39;s wrong with bashing a MOB over the head with your new bible? ;)<br/>

BTW Dynil Fireshine was green to me at level 22 (when I killed him last Friday). I didn&#39;t camp him, just ducked in everytime I passed the area.<br/>
Got camo&#39;ed and brought along 200+ gold to see Moodoro last night, but he gave me the Jester card on the second try! So basically it only cost me 1plat for the Testament. &lt;big grin&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, that&#39;s confirmed that the quest is working now for anyone worried about it still being broken (as I was).<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>
