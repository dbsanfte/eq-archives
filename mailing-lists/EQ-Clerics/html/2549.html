<div id="ygrps-yiv-697457379">I did not ask for a tip at all let alone one that large.  I just try to play my cleric and the bard as being more than happy to help anyone in need and it seems that people notice and wish to help us also.  And in addition my bard ran from the orc lift clear to the entrance to LFay to help someone she did not even know.<br/>

Just treat people as you would like to be treated and what goes around comes around.  <br/>

  I find that really amazing, I occasionally get a little bit of help when it comes to equipment, something like ringmail that someone doesn&#39;t need anymore, but never that much equipment or PP. Sometimes I wonder about that, my friends get free stuff all the time, is it the way you ask or something?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;At the entrance he again asked me if I would not accept a tip.   I told him<br/>
  &gt;that yes I would accept a small one expecting a pp or two maybe.  Well he<br/>
  &gt;tipped me 50pp.   Needless to say I was stunned but accepted.   50pp to a<br/>
  &gt;5th level is a fortune for sure.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I don&#39;t quite go to that extreme, but I do something similar on a regular<br/>
  basis. When I run out of cats eye, and I&#39;m in a town I have bad faction, I<br/>
  always give a 1st lvl character 15 PP to pick me up 40 of them. At 2 and a<br/>
  half gold each, he gets 5 PP to keep. A nice bonus for a first lvl.<br/>
