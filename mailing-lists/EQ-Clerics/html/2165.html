<div id="ygrps-yiv-841757999">Try solo-ing the skeletons in steamfont.  Just be sure you get one by<br/>
itself, because others will come help.  And the loot is way better<br/>
than chessboard, anyway.  Or you might find low-teens groups here<br/>
fighting elementals or minos, or the various other stuff that wanders<br/>
this zone.  I&#39;m sure they would like having a cleric in their group.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, there are other suggestions, such as qeynos hills, or<br/>
the sewers, or blackburrow, or north ro, or west commons, or misty<br/>
thicket... but since you are on Faydwar, try Steamfont.<br/>

&gt;I also seem to have this trouble finding a group even though I will heal<br/>
&gt;anyone that I see hurt whether in combat or just resting.    I think it is<br/>
&gt;mainly my level though on my part.  It seems to me that most people wish to<br/>
&gt;solo yet at 10th - 12th level.   I am really getting very discouraged as I<br/>
&gt;have been level 10 for weeks now.  It seems that every time I get a bar of<br/>
&gt;exp I die a couple of times and lose it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I hunt normally either in ButcherBlock or around the entrance to CrushBone.<br/>
&gt;It seems that BB is mostly deserted when I am around and there is nothing<br/>
&gt;for me to hunt there.  I have hunted the Chess Board a couple of times when<br/>
&gt;I was able to find a group.   The orcs around the CB entrance are either <br/>
&gt;low<br/>
&gt;green (no exp) or else there are 3 or more at once on me and that is death<br/>
&gt;for sure.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Any suggestions would be appreciated.<br/>

&gt; &gt; You know..I see these messages every no and then about cant find a group<br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt; &gt; just cannot understand it. No matter where I have been I have always <br/>
&gt;been<br/>
&gt; &gt; welcomed into a group within a matter of minutes. Sometimes It would <br/>
&gt;take<br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt; &gt; little work on my part. Such as casting buffs and heals on passer bys or<br/>
&gt; &gt; what not. Here is the line that I use. &quot;Cleric of the X circle seeks <br/>
&gt;group<br/>
&gt; &gt; to heal in battle&quot;. seems to work great for me. Who would&#39;nt want a<br/>
&gt;cleric?<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;Well I am back :P  Took a nice 3 month break from my cleric and EQ.  <br/>
&gt;WOW<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;have things changed.  I was in High Hold going to East Co and had to go<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;through Kichlor Forest.  I almost died trying to get through.  I didnt<br/>
&gt;know<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;they changed that area.  DAMN!!!!!!  Anyway....  The reason I decided <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;leave because I couldnt find a group in any of the places.  I still<br/>
&gt;couldnt<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;believe noone wanted a cleric in their group.  Well I am level 25 and<br/>
&gt;just<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;wondering where can I hunt?  The best places that a cleric will feel<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;welcomed,  and if you say unrest no way!!!!  Thanks guys :)<br/>
