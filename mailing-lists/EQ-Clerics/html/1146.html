<div id="ygrps-yiv-1902065946">I had always assumed that the stun during Divine Aura was a bug and not to <br/>
maintain balance.  I thought the balance was kept by this spell in that it <br/>
could only be used once every 15 minutes.  Even if you die and have to <br/>
rememorize it, you still have to wait the 15 minutes to use it again.  If <br/>
this stun thing isn&#39;t a bug, then I probably won&#39;t use this spell more.  I <br/>
hardly use it now as it is since the only time I really need it is if I&#39;m <br/>
going to die and I have no hope of running since I&#39;m so low on life anyways.  <br/>
Although it is fun to cast this spell then jump off of things such as the <br/>
wizard teleport stones.  Always fun to scare people. Hehe.<br/>
