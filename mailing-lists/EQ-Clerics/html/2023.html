I have heard that this quest begins in Erudin, but that you need not go<br/>
there to do it. This is ALL I did:<br/>
<br/>
1. Go to Highpass and find the Smuggler&#39;s camp. If you go to the Inn and<br/>
jump in the water, you will see a hole in the side of the wall, swim through<br/>
and you will be there.<br/>
<br/>
2. Find Dynil (forgot his last name) who spawns under a little tent. He<br/>
looks just like a Qeynos guard with a helm on so you can&#39;t miss him. He is<br/>
around 13-15 level. When you kill him he drops &quot;Page 30 of a book&quot; (no<br/>
drop). (NOTE: His spawn time is right at 7 hours)<br/>
<br/>
3. Go to Qeynos and find Moordoro (this is where i went invis). He is in a<br/>
building to the right as soon as you enter the North gate. Just walk up to<br/>
him and give him 2gp. He will hand you the Testament of Vanear Container<br/>
(2-slot container). Then you give him 4gp and he will deal you a card from<br/>
his deck. (NOTE: You MUST give him GOLD pieces) When he deals you a Jester,<br/>
give it back to him and he will give you &quot;Page 34 of a book&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
4. Place both pages into the container and, Voila!, you have a Testament of<br/>
Vanear. Easy!<br/>
<br/>
Anymore questions, let me know.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; ok,  how does one do the quest then? :)  that would be my best question to<br/>
&gt; ask...I&#39;ve heard it touched on and not seen any answers as to how to<br/>
&gt; complete it!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
