<b>Subject:</b> Re: Clerics and the art of Dueling <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-986426657">Well personally, I have been in one duel myself (against a fellow guild<br/>
member), and I actually won (WOO HOO).  Anyways, he was about 2 or 3<br/>
levels ahead of me, and a magician.  My advice against spell casters<br/>
would be just to fight as normal against them, and try to disrupt their<br/>
spelling, and after they bombard you with their spells and drain their<br/>
mana, heal yourself.  This would make their magic casting in vain, and<br/>
give you the advantage.  If you have plenty of magic left, smite them,<br/>
or use any other powerful magic against them to drop their health down,<br/>
and simply melee them until their dead or unconscious (anyway you<br/>
prefer).<br/>

&gt; Hail fellow Clerics,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I have witnessed and read about many adventurers dueling to<br/>
&gt; test their skills or to settle a dispute.  However, I have<br/>
&gt; never seen a Cleric duel nor have heard of one.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Since we are in charge of Saving lives, how do we tune<br/>
&gt; ourselves to Take a life? Clerics are far from being cowards,<br/>
&gt; but to decline a duel or be somewhat at a loss durring a<br/>
&gt; potential guild war, can bring shame upon the class.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   So I ask, are there any dueling clerics out there that can<br/>
&gt; lend their experiences to a beginning duelest?  I am a level<br/>
&gt; 19 cleric but I wish to open the discussion to all levels.<br/>
&gt; Tips for fighting hybrids, magic using classes, and especially<br/>
&gt; adventureres that are of lvls higher than yourself.<br/>
