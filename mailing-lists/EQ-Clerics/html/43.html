<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1964479392">I agree. When I first made my new character coming from Beta, I figured I would<br/>
make a cleric. Dwarfs had the best stats for the job. It was great ! I started<br/>
off kiling stuff without having to run and they were powerful. The only downfall<br/>
is the Charisma and I didn&#39;t make much low level money.<br/>
But at higher level s like 15 and 16 all the way up to 19 I get money from stuff<br/>
I find and sell to PC&#39;s. I think that Dwarfs are the most effective clerics .<br/>

&gt; Interesting point you bring up about your Elven Cleric.  I played an Elven<br/>
&gt; Cleric up to level 11.  I stopped because I was having problems raising my<br/>
&gt; two-handed blunt up from 0.  I started a Dwarven Cleric and have seen the<br/>
&gt; difference.  I can solo pretty good and I can definitely back a fighter if<br/>
&gt; needed.  The problem with my first character was that I didn&#39;t have the<br/>
&gt; strength to do the damage and carry the gear that my Dwarf can.  So I guess<br/>
&gt; you kind of have to make the choice to be a back up fighter in the<br/>
&gt; beginning.  Interesting points though.<br/>

&gt; I dont think clerics can hold their own at all.  (besides undead) IMHO I am<br/>
&gt; a level 13 High Elf cleric. Our offensive spells dont do that much damage at<br/>
&gt; all.  I have read about the higher level offensive spells, and they dont<br/>
&gt; really impress me.  I love being a cleric saving lives and getting the<br/>
&gt; thanks from everyone.  Pretty much we cant solo.  (which I dont mind at all)<br/>
&gt; I want to be in a group.  When I play I must get a couple /tells an hour<br/>
&gt; asking me if I am in a group.  Or some high level asking me to heal 500+<br/>
&gt; HP&#39;s.  All I really want is appreciation.  Depending on their level I do<br/>
&gt; charge a small fee for a cure or a heal.  Usually what I do if they do give<br/>
&gt; me something depending how much, I will cure/heal the rest of the period I<br/>
&gt; am playing.  I think everyone will agree with me that being a cleric you are<br/>
&gt; going to be poor! Like I said,  I am level 13 and have about 2/5 of banded<br/>
&gt; armor.  When I see other classes have full banded and a fine steel weapon.<br/>
&gt; I was forced to move locations from Oasis which doesn&#39;t give much loot at my<br/>
&gt; level to Black Burrow.  I didn&#39;t mind the move at all.  I plan to stay in BB<br/>
&gt; until I get full banded armor all of my level 14 spells and maybe a fine<br/>
&gt; steel hammer.  I have to look up the stats for that.  Then I will probably<br/>
&gt; move back to the Oasis.  Well I am rambling right now plus there is work to<br/>
&gt; do.  Safe Journeys!<br/>

&gt; Let&#39;s get some content flowing on this list shall we?  Let&#39;s start with why<br/>
&gt; you want to be a cleric.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; With me it was a simple choice.  I like to be able to help people.  There is<br/>
&gt; nothing like coming upon someone locked in a life or death battle and<br/>
&gt; swaying the tide to their side.  I don&#39;t do it for any reward other than the<br/>
&gt; thank you I receive.  It is good to know that you helped.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I also like the fighting abilities of the Cleric.  Although not as good as<br/>
&gt; the Warrior or the Paladin, Clerics can definitely hold their own.<br/>
