<div id="ygrps-yiv-203904229">Hahaha  good old Realm...  Do you remember how simple 1.0 was?<br/>
Anyway with capping the servers to 1000 would be sweet but that will never<br/>
happen.  It would casue to much trouble.  I wouldnt mind if they brought up<br/>
new servers that have a cap on it.  THere are way to many on the main<br/>
servers ( oringinal beta )  Last night there  were close to 1800 on my<br/>
server (The Rathe)  There is no way they can cap that.  To many people would<br/>
be mad trying to get on those servers.  But rumor is that there is going to<br/>
be a quest that you can change servers which would be great.  <br/>

&gt; A cap might be nice but put it to low and you&#39;ll have a lot off ticked off<br/>
&gt; people cause they can&#39;t get onto their server.  If that starts to happen<br/>
&gt; we<br/>
&gt; might see a lot of ppl quiting the game, ya I know less ppl playing means<br/>
&gt; more places to hunt without fighting over who gets what kill and less lag.<br/>
&gt; But thing about that less ppl playing (less money for Verant) less money<br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; them could mean the end of EverQuest, I mean look at other games such as<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; Realm.  The Realm at first was a big game, but over time ppl got tired of<br/>
&gt; it<br/>
&gt; and they quit playing where is the Realm now?  It might still be there but<br/>
&gt; how often is it updated, how many ppl are on there now to play with or<br/>
&gt; against?  I like EQ about as much as the next person, but I have a feeling<br/>
&gt; we won&#39;t see it around or as big as it is now for I&#39;d say 2-3 more years,<br/>
&gt; with games such as Middle-Earth, Asherions Call and I&#39;ve heard of one more<br/>
&gt; coming out.  If these 3 games hit it big a lot of ppl with switch from EQ<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; them, if they switch these 3 games to put an end to EQ.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I agree that the servers need to capped. I even think 1000 on a server<br/>
&gt; is<br/>
&gt; &gt; alot...I would love to see servers capped at 500. Wow,<br/>
&gt; &gt; would THAT be something =)<br/>
