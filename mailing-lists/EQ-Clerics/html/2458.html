<div id="ygrps-yiv-623558593">Welcome to Test, Laurelei.  Test goes down without a moments notice<br/>
sometimes, and there is absolutely no GM support; which means we have<br/>
to rely on each other to help out when the going gets tough.  :)  It&#39;s<br/>
a real close-knit community, and a lot of people would have quite<br/>
playing EQ altogether if it wasn&#39;t for Test.  Look me up sometime if<br/>
I&#39;m in your neighborhood (currently Innothule Swamp, and I DOUBT<br/>
that&#39;s your neighborhood&lt;g&gt;), and I&#39;ll come by and hit you with Daring<br/>
and spirit armor; Transal if you role-play. :)<br/>

&gt;Date: Mon, 6 Dec 1999 07:45:37 -0500<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My Friends and I are burned out quite a bit on Fennin Ro, way too crowded,<br/>
&gt;and the Planes are near to impossible half the time.  Well, we decided to<br/>
&gt;take a break and I am having a blast.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We created characters on the test server. No Spam, No crowding, and no<br/>
&gt;problems so far about finding stuff to hunt. We are still very young yet<br/>
&gt;though and it is fun having to work for all our stuff again.  On Fennin We<br/>
&gt;could create newbie and give them things, but on test we can&#39;t &quot;twink&quot; so <br/>
&gt;it<br/>
&gt;feels just like it did when I started out on March 18th.<br/>
&gt;I made a cleric again, while my friends made classes that are different <br/>
&gt;form<br/>
&gt;what their high levels on Fennin are.  My thought are I have always liked<br/>
&gt;playign the cleric and well if we are gonna go anywhere on Test, you have <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;have a cleric so I am happy to repeat.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Just thought I would share that with everyone, I am having a blast once<br/>
&gt;again =)<br/>
