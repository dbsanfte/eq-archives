<div id="ygrps-yiv-1117289625">I think they were talking about the tarnished morning star... i&#39;ve never heard of the <br/>
&quot;enchanted MS&quot; though I have been wrong before... the tarnished morning star is, or <br/>
was, dropped by some of the undead that just recently started roaming the Kithicore <br/>
Forest during the night.    I heard a rumor, that they no longer dropped these however...<br/>
I hope that&#39;s not true because I really want one and they morning stars are no-drop <br/>
items... so if they no longer are being dropped in Kithicore i can never get one =(<br/>
