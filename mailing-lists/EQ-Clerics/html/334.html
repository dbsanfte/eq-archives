<div id="ygrps-yiv-1391192582">I am looking for a Cleric Guild...<br/>
<br/>
I play on the PvP server and I can&#39;t seen to find a Cleric/Healer guild. I<br/>
just want people to be able to identify me as someone who is aligned for<br/>
good and is not a PK type person. I do not want to get into heavy guild<br/>
commitments. However for Role Play purposes it is fun to have a guiding<br/>
philosophy. Any one..<br/>
<br/>
Know of a guild that they would like representation on Rallas Zek<br/>
Are in a healer guild on Rallos Zek<br/>
Want to form a healer guild on Rallos Zek<br/>
<br/>
Regards<br/>
<br/>
Nynenom lvl 7 Cleric!</div>
