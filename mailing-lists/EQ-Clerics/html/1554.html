<b>Subject:</b> Re: Suggestions for high teen levels in unrest? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-581802445">I have been in unrest since level 17.  Our group<br/>
always seems to come back there for some reason. <br/>
Although, we have had tons of close calls, I have<br/>
found this my very very very favorite place for<br/>
gaining ooooooodles of experience.  I think the main<br/>
thing is to have a very well balanced group.  At level<br/>
17-19 we did mainly yard trash.  Death beetles,<br/>
ghouls, greater skeletons.  From 19-20, we did alot of<br/>
dark bones and dry bones.  From 20 up (with a full<br/>
group of course) we tackled hags and the occasional<br/>
barbed boned skeleton (they hit like a semi and if you<br/>
pull more than one, you might think about making a run<br/>
for zone).  Now, at nearly 28, there isnt much that we<br/>
cant take.  Our group ranges from level 23 to 27 and<br/>
we can take on sizable trains.<br/>
<br/>
As Anne Falbo-Ortiz (Topaaz) can tell you, she has had<br/>
many mis adventures in this zone.  But, for me, it is<br/>
fun and I dont plan on leaving till level 29.<br/>
<br/>
The main thing is, learn the ropes of the place.  Try<br/>
to keep the same group and when looking for tanks,<br/>
advertise for one that is experienced in pulling. <br/>
Hopefully you&#39;ll get one.  <br/>
<br/>
To this day, we still stand along the back wall while<br/>
the younger groups look up at us with awe in their<br/>
eyes. (I got a big head, so sue me).  They have become<br/>
familiar with our group and know that if they end up<br/>
in trouble they can ask us for help.<br/>
<br/>
So far every one of my &quot;gals&quot; (characters) have gone<br/>
to unrest as soon as they earned the right of binding.<br/>

&gt; I was at Unrest at lvl 23 with a full group<br/>
&gt; including a 2nd cleric.  The <br/>
&gt; place was horrible.  Death after death after death. <br/>
&gt; Between deaths and <br/>
&gt; running to the zone there were no points made.  The<br/>
&gt; only time we were there <br/>
&gt; successfully was in a room (hand room) i think. <br/>
&gt; Then shortly a high lvl <br/>
&gt; cleric came in and ran us out....i am now almost lvl<br/>
&gt; 27 and haven&#39;t been <br/>
&gt; back yet.  I may try to go back soon though...<br/>

&gt; &gt;I have heard from many many people that unrest is a<br/>
&gt; great place for a <br/>
&gt; &gt;cleric<br/>
&gt; &gt;to go starting around 14 or so.  I am 17th (almost<br/>
&gt; 18th) and am having<br/>
&gt; &gt;serious trouble there.  Last night 6 people from my<br/>
&gt; guild were there, all<br/>
&gt; &gt;15-20 and we had a rough time.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;We were at the back wall pulling from the back<br/>
&gt; door.  We had SoW and invis<br/>
&gt; &gt;to undead on the puller at all times, but there<br/>
&gt; were many times where she<br/>
&gt; &gt;ended up bringing quite a few too many ghouls. <br/>
&gt; (tried to pull 1 and<br/>
&gt; &gt;suddenly there were 7 of them on us!)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Are we hunting at too high a level, or are we<br/>
&gt; pulling from the wrong place?<br/>
&gt; &gt;Or do we just suck?  We only had 2 deaths last<br/>
&gt; night, but many many many<br/>
&gt; &gt;close calls.  Lets just say thank god our druid was<br/>
&gt; also saving 50% mana <br/>
&gt; &gt;for<br/>
&gt; &gt;heals.<br/>
