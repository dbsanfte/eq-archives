 </span></blockquote>This isn&#39;t true. I have worked on my alcohol tolerance ever since I noticed<br/>
STR and STA go up during a wedding reception (prior to that I also thought<br/>
it was a warrior only effect). It&#39;s now at 150; only just hit level 30 so I<br/>
haven&#39;t maxed it yet. Sometimes I can knock a few back and get the STR and<br/>
STA buffs without being too drunk to cast, sometimes I can&#39;t.<br/>
