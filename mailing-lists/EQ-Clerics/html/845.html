From my understanding here are the issues:<br/>
<br/>
1.  Don&#39;t respond with the original message attached.<br/>
<br/>
Pro:  Saves bandwidth.  People don&#39;t have to download 10K worth of message<br/>
to see 2K worth of response.<br/>
<br/>
Con:  Someone coming in the middle of the thread won&#39;t know what you are<br/>
talking about.  As you can see, I am a member of this believe.  I think that<br/>
if you use good judgement then you won&#39;t have to worry about it.  Just don&#39;t<br/>
quote a 2 page e-mail just to make a 2 sentence response.<br/>
<br/>
2.  Don&#39;t use anything but plain text.<br/>
<br/>
Pro:  A lot of people on these lists use *nix or some other form of test<br/>
only mail readers.  Things like html and RTF only detract from the message<br/>
and sometimes make in unreadable.  I support this believe.  I would rather<br/>
have everyone be able to read my message than to have it look good to the<br/>
30% who can support html.<br/>
<br/>
Con:  It makes the post look better (sometimes).  I don&#39;t think this is a<br/>
concern.<br/>
<br/>
I believe those are the two issues that concerned you.  This is my<br/>
understanding so it may not be totally right.  One other thing, you may want<br/>
to make a more descriptive title to your thread.  Something like &#39;List<br/>
Etiquette&#39; would be appropriate.  I would change it now but it will screw<br/>
with people who are deleting this thread with a filter.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>

ok i have a question, when i first joined this list i was told not to just<br/>
simply reply to a message, that i must first delete the thread.  Since then<br/>
i have done as asked, but alot of ppl are replying to messages without<br/>
deleting the threads, while i understand the reason, NOW, for deleting the<br/>
thread,i do not understand why others don&#39;t delete as well?  i am a little<br/>
miffed about this as it was not asked nicely of me, well maybe i took it<br/>
wrong, but just the same, if i have to delete the threads then why does<br/>
everyone else not have to.  Also i was adding color to the message as i<br/>
thought it looked better and was told not to do that as well!!  oh well i<br/>
was just wondering why i was told to do so and since then i have seen many<br/>
long messages by others.  err ppl i am not slamming anyone i am just asking<br/>
a general question -- thanx for yer time -- anne *hugs*<br/>
