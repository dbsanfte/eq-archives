&gt;Hi all.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I gave seen this debate before in other places.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What do you all think of begging as a method of acquiring<br/>
&gt;cash/armour/weapons?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t mean the skill of begging, but I mean approaching other PC&#39;s and<br/>
&gt;asking them to spare a bit?<br/>

things a challenge. &quot;Free banded gorget to the first one to find me. From<br/>
where I am, I can see an undead pawn and a goblin shaman&quot;<br/>
<br/>
One of these days, I&#39;m going to hold a scavenger hunt. Say, 20 items. Some<br/>
can only be found in one place in Norrath. The first one to get them all to<br/>
 me. (or, barring that, the one who gets the MOST from the list) gets a<br/>
full set.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also been kicking around the idea of a marathon from Qeynos to Crushbone<br/>
<br/>
I have nothing against giving stuff away, but make &#39;em work for it -;&gt;<br/>
