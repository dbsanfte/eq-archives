<div id="ygrps-yiv-1706641955">You know, speaking of Unrest for 13th level characters, I was in<br/>
Unrest again last night, and there was a 13th level rogue killing<br/>
death beetles in there.  After every beetle slain he would /cheer and<br/>
was really whooping it up.  The high levels all got a big kick out of<br/>
it.  He was getting high level buffs and heals while he was there.<br/>
Not a bad deal.<br/>

&gt;It&#39;s off of the zone Dagnor&#39;s Cauldron, which is off of Butcher Block in <br/>
&gt;Faydwer.   You CAN go there at level 13 with a group and kill yard trash <br/>
&gt;for pretty good xp, but the trains there are really nasty.  I didn&#39;t really <br/>
&gt;do all that well in unrest until around level 24 when I got greater healing <br/>
&gt;and dismiss undead.  At that point, I was able to camp a room inside the <br/>
&gt;house with relative ease.  It&#39;s a great zone for loot as well as xp because <br/>
&gt;most all of the monsters above the yard trash carry fine steel weapons, and <br/>
&gt;a few have small bronze armor pieces.   This zone is especially good for us <br/>
&gt;clerics since about 90% of the monsters there are undead.<br/>
