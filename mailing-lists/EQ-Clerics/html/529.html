<div id="ygrps-yiv-848504238">Well I can personally see what you are talking about but I paly on Povar<br/>
and believe it or not ppl do RP on my server now you brought up a good point<br/>
about the cleric,paladin,and druids about what their roles should be and<br/>
should not be and your right. But the RP games that started in 1986 wre<br/>
nothing but words actually they were like that for a long time those kind of<br/>
RPing games  never attracted  the kind of assholes that a game with pics and<br/>
actuall visual movement thru a world would. Im tellign you as long as there<br/>
are RPing games   like EQ theres going to be ppl who just wont RP. Hopefully<br/>
youll find a RPing game that you like andc have fun.<br/>
