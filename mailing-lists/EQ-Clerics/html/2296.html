Here&#39;s another way to look at it.  The 29th level DD Wrath seems pretty good on paper although the damage/mana ratio sucks.  I do use that spell a lot when I solo (root/nuke) so Evocation maxes quickly each level if I solo a lot.  However, do you realize that you get NO OTHER DD until level 44?  So at level 43 your DD will be a wimpy 200 some odd points on MOBS with thousands of hit points.  It will not even drop a runner most likely.  Specializing in Evocation makes no sense for a cleric.  You might could argue Abjuration for buffing, but it is your heal spells that save the day..............<br/>
<br/>
If you are going to reduce fizzles and mana cost (what specialization does) then Alteration is the way to go.  Keep your DOTs alive (warriors, etc.) while they take the MOBs down.<br/>

  Subject: [EQ-Clerics] The specialize skill<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  A question for all you level 50 clerics, or at least clerics above level 30...  what is the best school of magic to specialize in?   My initial thought is that I would want to specialize in alteration since that is the school that the healing spells are in and I think I use the healing spells more than any other...  Somebody else suggested that I put one practice point into each school and just go with whichever one increases over 50 first... the theory being that whichever one goes over 50 first is probably the one I use the most.   Does anybody else have any ideas reguarding which school is best to specialize in?<br/>
  I am level 29, about half way to 30... so I will soon be facing this choice.  Thanks!<br/>
