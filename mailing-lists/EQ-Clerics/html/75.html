<b>Subject:</b> Wall squad ring <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-256448809">Greetings fellow clerics of Norrath!<br/>
<br/>
I am currently playing a Lvl 19 female Dwarf cleric at Innoruuk server.<br/>
<br/>
I am about to complete the Wall squad ring quest at Rivervale (Ghobber considers me warmly now... shouldn&#39;t take long).<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday when i was hunting goblins in Runnyeye with full party, someone asked me to charge his Wall squad ring. At first i started thinking how can i do that. Then someone said that only halflings can charge them. So i never had the chance of trying it. The person who asked me to charge the ring thought i was a halfling :(. So can&#39;t clerics of any other race than halfling charge these rings?<br/>
<br/>
And eh, why the heck the cleric guild at Rivervale won&#39;t let me train my skills? I think i never did anything that could worsen my faction standing with them. So do i need to raise my faction standing with them before they will talk to me? Or is this similar case as when any Elf tries to trade with the Innkeeper at Kaladim (I think Irontoe something was his name) and he always turns them down. I&#39;m also having the same problem with the human clerics in Freeport. Do i really have to go all the way to Kaladim to be able to use my training points?<br/>
<br/>
With all the best to fellow Norrathian clerics,<br/>
