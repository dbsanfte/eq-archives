<div id="ygrps-yiv-178598273">I couldn&#39;t agree more,  Azor.  Verant seems totally preoccupied with<br/>
discovering and fixing ways players have found to make the game more<br/>
playable, rather than looking for positive changes that should be made to<br/>
improve both the classes and the game, itself.  It seems all they focus on<br/>
is how to make things harder on the players.<br/>
<br/>
 Why DON&#39;T they fix Fear Plane, or do something to improve the gosh awful<br/>
camping that is going on every single place where a decent item is found.<br/>
Last weekend, we (our level 50s) went to like 7 different places to try and<br/>
obtain items for some of us that didn&#39;t have them.  This was at 10am EDT on<br/>
a Sunday morning.  Every single last place was camped and the lower level<br/>
groups that were there told us they would be there all day and nite.  Since<br/>
there was really nothing else for us to do, (can&#39;t go to Fear and noone<br/>
needs exp anymore)  we all simply logged and went about doing  RL things<br/>
outside of EQ.<br/>
<br/>
 Verant needs to wake up to the fact that their high level players are<br/>
getting fed up and bored, and THAT&#39;s why they are leaving and/or selling<br/>
their characters on ebay and looking for new games.<br/>
