<div id="ygrps-yiv-2124722581">You know..I see these messages every no and then about cant find a group and <br/>
just cannot understand it. No matter where I have been I have always been <br/>
welcomed into a group within a matter of minutes. Sometimes It would take a <br/>
little work on my part. Such as casting buffs and heals on passer bys or <br/>
what not. Here is the line that I use. &quot;Cleric of the X circle seeks group <br/>
to heal in battle&quot;. seems to work great for me. Who would&#39;nt want a cleric?<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Well I am back :P  Took a nice 3 month break from my cleric and EQ.  WOW<br/>
&gt;have things changed.  I was in High Hold going to East Co and had to go<br/>
&gt;through Kichlor Forest.  I almost died trying to get through.  I didnt know<br/>
&gt;they changed that area.  DAMN!!!!!!  Anyway....  The reason I decided to<br/>
&gt;leave because I couldnt find a group in any of the places.  I still couldnt<br/>
&gt;believe noone wanted a cleric in their group.  Well I am level 25 and just<br/>
&gt;wondering where can I hunt?  The best places that a cleric will feel<br/>
&gt;welcomed,  and if you say unrest no way!!!!  Thanks guys :)<br/>
