<div id="ygrps-yiv-1167815451">I read on another post that with the new patch they did a few changes with<br/>
the Oasis.<br/>
This is what the post said<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Ok new news on this one... if anyone has hunted there before you know the<br/>
typical problems of avoiding sand giant, spectres, and sometimes Tarantualla<br/>
whatever his name is. Well they are chicken feed.<br/>
<br/>
As of patch we now have deepwater goblins. Shamans over 35+ with the wolf<br/>
pets running around the beach of Oasis. Are they aggressive? YES Are they<br/>
strong? HELL YES<br/>
<br/>
Last night I witnessed one clean the beach between 2nd and 1st rock, then<br/>
kill a SAND GIANT and go back to the water for a swim. Apparently the Gods<br/>
have decided they did not appreciate our camping along the beach. Party time<br/>
is over.<br/>
<br/>
They also added cistern asps. No biggie probably 14th level or so.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So if this is 100% true and you&#39;re around Lvl 35 or lower you might wanna be<br/>
extra careful there.<br/>
