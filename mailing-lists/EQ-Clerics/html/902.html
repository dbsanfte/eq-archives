&lt;&lt; most clerics are good natured, but others just role-play, and i do not.  <br/>
 Many is the day i will heal a member of the HATE follower, and i get yelled <br/>
 at  that they would rather die than be healed by the likes of me, so ya know <br/>
 what i do?  I heal them full, then buff them to the max!!!  LOL  i love it, <br/>
 reguardless of which god you follow you are a cleric, and clerics heal, <br/>
 thats their job! plain and simple!! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
hehe, good show... this is what I do as well.  Even if someone is being an <br/>
ass, I&#39;ll help them out. <br/>
