<div id="ygrps-yiv-1907539270">What would you say is the best quest for the ease of doing?  I mean<br/>
obviously I won&#39;t be doing and high level quests if I am lvl 15-20 or so,<br/>
but what would you recommend for that lvl?  I am just getting tired of the<br/>
boredom of blood and guts for a bit, and wanting to try something else - any<br/>
input on the matter is welcome.<br/>
<br/>
Thank You!<br/>
