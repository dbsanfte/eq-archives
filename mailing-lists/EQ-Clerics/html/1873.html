<div id="ygrps-yiv-1374768003">Undead reavers are after zoning from NK over wooden bridge into EK hang a<br/>
right and there is a hill after a short bit full of them. Be careful as thee<br/>
are alot of HG about sometimes and cyclops. They should be easy for you.<br/>
Also in this zone as someone has mentioned are gorge hounds not too hard and<br/>
Crag Spiders. Crags are tough and have nasty poison. carrions might be<br/>
better to start with but a crag if you root , blast, melee and leave enough<br/>
to cure the poison after should be ok too and great xp just pull them to the<br/>
river bank as the lions have a massive agro radius if you try and med here.<br/>
<br/>
South Karanas has alot of soloable stuff as does Rathe mountains, or the<br/>
ultra boring and penniless way (you will be poor as wehn you started with<br/>
this one) Oasis. Pick dry bones off as well as crypt mummies DW caimans and<br/>
crocodiles.<br/>

P.s. if your really lucky and brave an Eye might show that is why when in<br/>
this zone prot vs magic and poison are essential latter for spiders<br/>
obviously.</div>
