<div id="ygrps-yiv-53557515">However, we have seen a significant drop of wis helping items after you get<br/>
past 200 (more like 170).<br/>
<br/>
While wisdom is key for mana DO NOT forget to get some DEX items. All good<br/>
clerics should try to get their dex up to 85, if not 100.<br/>
<br/>
Reasoning, after you cast your first &quot;real&quot; heal (greater heal for 280+ hp)<br/>
most monsters will attack you. DEX will allow you to cast while being hit<br/>
(it helps your channeling).<br/>
