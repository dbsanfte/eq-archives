<div id="ygrps-yiv-778388955">From lvl 9 on I went to the mummy shrine in Lesser F. Great Experience until<br/>
14 or 15. Be careful at first what you pull. By standing in the right spot,<br/>
use of root and ward you should be able pull and take yellows easily. Use<br/>
the wood elf camp as your base and you can run back and forth for safety.<br/>
Often there will be other clerics around that can pitch in if things get out<br/>
of hand. Be careful though as you are the lowest level where I would risk it<br/>
and even the orcs round there might beat you to a pulp.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck<br/>

Hello all, <br/>
<br/>
I barely got lvl 9 last night (Woo Hoo!), and can&#39;t figure out any good<br/>
spots to hunt.  It seems that everywhere I&#39;ve been has a lot of greens and<br/>
yellows, or some blues hanging around with a bunch of yellows/reds.<br/>
<br/>
Any advice on where a young cleric can get some experience.  I&#39;m tired of<br/>
running for the zone when those Legionnaires come to the aide of their cent<br/>
counterparts.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure you all remember getting 9th, but I don&#39;t know if you felt the<br/>
disappointment, that I did, in the spells that we got.  I was all psyched to<br/>
get root and maybe soothe, but what else is there that works well?  I&#39;m<br/>
still using furor as my DD spell.  Seems pretty weak compared to a 9th level<br/>
Druid&#39;s &quot;ignite&quot; spell that took a cent out in 2 casts.  I can hit em 4 or 5<br/>
times with furor and still have to duke it out for a while.  Any<br/>
encouragement out there?<br/>
