I am level 50 and have had my experience bars totally filled for weeks<br/>
now, and my screen since then still shows I gain exp when we kill a blue<br/>
or higher.  And there is no change of color, all the bars look like they<br/>
do at any other level.  Although I haven&#39;t died since I totally filled<br/>
all my bars at level 50, I know others who have and if they continued to<br/>
gain experience after filling them, they said they did not notice any<br/>
loss of exp until they died several times.  So don&#39;t ask me WHERE the<br/>
exp is going, but apparently it is increasing past that 5th bar since<br/>
you can die and not see any exp loss.<br/>
