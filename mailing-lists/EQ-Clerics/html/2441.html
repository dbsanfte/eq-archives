<div id="ygrps-yiv-456115335"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;At the entrance he again asked me if I would not accept a tip.   I told him<br/>
&gt;that yes I would accept a small one expecting a pp or two maybe.  Well he<br/>
&gt;tipped me 50pp.   Needless to say I was stunned but accepted.   50pp to a<br/>
&gt;5th level is a fortune for sure.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t quite go to that extreme, but I do something similar on a regular<br/>
basis. When I run out of cats eye, and I&#39;m in a town I have bad faction, I<br/>
always give a 1st lvl character 15 PP to pick me up 40 of them. At 2 and a<br/>
half gold each, he gets 5 PP to keep. A nice bonus for a first lvl.</div>
