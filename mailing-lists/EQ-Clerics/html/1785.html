<div id="ygrps-yiv-1308359353">Gynok definatly spawns on the first level right inside the zone enterance, he <br/>
looks like he is walking back from a train.  As for the spawn time, i camped <br/>
the spot for 5 hours, and i know that the place holder was NOT down on the <br/>
3rd level, and gynok spawned ONCE.  Good luck !!</div>
