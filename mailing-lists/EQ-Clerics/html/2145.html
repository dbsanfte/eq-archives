<div id="ygrps-yiv-255671590">If you don&#39;t like crowds, go to the scarecrow field in W Karana. Scarecrows<br/>
are undead, give great exp (at least on a par with what you can find in<br/>
Oasis), they aren&#39;t aggro (despite the fact that they may scowl at you) and<br/>
the field is a very safe place to meditate - no giants or otherwise<br/>
instakill mobs roam that far south. Plus you can sense the dead so even as a<br/>
human like me, the time of day and weather conditions don&#39;t matter. The<br/>
worst that happens is a cat or bear attack while meditating - which you<br/>
should easily be able to take care of.<br/>
<br/>
At 14 scarecrows will con white to red I think. I would recommend teaming up<br/>
with an enchanter and you&#39;ll have no problems. Don&#39;t team up with a tank -<br/>
I&#39;ve tried it, it&#39;ll just split your mana between nuking and healing and<br/>
you&#39;ll end up totally drained _and_ with the tank at low health. Scarecrows<br/>
can hit hard and fast at that level, so an enchanter is a perfect partner<br/>
with Tashan, Ebbing Strength and Languid Pace. And a pet who can take some<br/>
hits.<br/>
<br/>
If you feel lucky you can solo selected scarecrows when you get up a level<br/>
or two.<br/>
