<div id="ygrps-yiv-1869538698">I see from your rant Chris that you are having the same problems that I do.<br/>
I can get in a group where each person seems to know what role they will<br/>
play in the group to ensure success and then others where it is a<br/>
free-for-all.   I really feel that this is a problem that all of us have in<br/>
changing from solo hunting with maybe a small group now and then to actually<br/>
needing a group that you know you can depend on to do their job and when you<br/>
say medding they do not pull another critter.<br/>
<br/>
I am 15 and was in Oasis today for the second time.  We were having a good<br/>
time until a ghoul showed up and I was OOM and most did not have magic<br/>
weapon.  We had also just finished fighting two Orc Warriors also which had<br/>
depleted my mana and a lot of the group&#39;s health.    I ended up gating out<br/>
from gypsy camp since some idiot had pulled a train of spectres into the<br/>
area and I had already met one up close and personal at the dock area.<br/>
Needless to say he won easily.<br/>
<br/>
I know that I have a list of those with who I will not group and those that<br/>
I love to group with.   Hopefully those that want to be independent will<br/>
learn to work with others or leave the game.<br/>

&gt; Ya, you&#39;re right.  Just something in me felt guilty about leaving.  After<br/>
&gt; all, I was the group leader, and I had invited people in to the group.<br/>
