<div id="ygrps-yiv-1323700704">I am a High Elf Cleric 28th lv and I have decided to take the route of being<br/>
the healer of the group and nothing more, fighting only in small batles, but<br/>
in the larger more drawn out fight I find myself hanging in the backlines<br/>
like a pure caster and just keeping everyone alive with heals, even medding<br/>
in the middle of the fight just so i can get up enough mana for that one<br/>
last heal. I&#39;ve benn colecting alot of +wisdom item and sacrificing AC for<br/>
more WIS. My natural wisdom is only 105 but it is now at 162. my equipment<br/>
is:<br/>
BloodStaind Tunic (+4wis)<br/>
Adamantine Epulotes (+7wis)<br/>
Black Iron Medalion (+3wis)<br/>
Rune Circlet (+4wis)<br/>
Silver Ruby Vail (+3wis)<br/>
2 Polished Bone Bracers (+3wis each)<br/>
2 earings (+3wis each)<br/>
2 rings (+6wis each)<br/>
Plat Armband (+3wis)<br/>
Chared Gaurdian Sheild (+9wis)<br/>
<br/>
I have lost at least 20ac if not more by using these items but if your<br/>
working in battle with a good tank you shoudn&#39;t have to worry much about<br/>
getting beat on alot.</div>
