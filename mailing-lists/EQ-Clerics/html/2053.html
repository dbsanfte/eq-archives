<div id="ygrps-yiv-2097670345">To get magnetized bars you take your enchanted bars to a guy <br/>
named Orins or something like that.  When you ask Gavel about <br/>
magnetized bars he tells you his name.  Just give this guy one <br/>
enchanted bar and he will return to you a magnetized one.  <br/>
Anyway I just gave Gavel the icon,ingot and 2 magnetized bars <br/>
and he gave me the weapon.<br/>
<br/>
They changed the quests a bit in one of the patches, I think <br/>
that&#39;s when they added these magnetized,galvanized and something <br/>
else bars.<br/>
