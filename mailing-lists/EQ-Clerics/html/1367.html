It is amazingly easy to have errors in code -- especially when the<br/>
error is with data (as the amount of damage is, I&#39;ve gathered, from<br/>
the way it was described) -- that do not show up in the beta-testing.<br/>
<br/>
Then you go on to realize that the game is not a shipped product. It is<br/>
continually evolving. You might not like all the changes. But I truly <br/>
don&#39;t believe they are using errors in code as any sort of scape goat.<br/>
I can easily believe that they have errors in their data that do not<br/>
show up in the beta-testing.<br/>

If you want a game that never changes, do not play an online game. Buy one<br/>
of the off the shelf games. Daggerfall. Or something like taht. Online games<br/>
will change on you.<br/>
