<div id="ygrps-yiv-1342057723">So you FOL but what does it do?<br/>
<br/>
Does the MOB temporarily stop his attack. <br/>
In a PvP does the other PC have to stop his attack. Or can he stand still<br/>
melee away or keep blasting you?<br/>
<br/>

&gt; Can you discuss a little how you use Flash of Light? I bought it, I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; think I have ever used it. I have seen it written that is is mainly good<br/>
for<br/>
&gt; PvP, which I don&#39;t do. How does it work against monsters?<br/>
<br/>
Actually, it IS most effective in a PvP situation, but even against<br/>
monsters, it&#39;s useful &#39;til about level 9 or so when you get Furor. =)<br/>
Flash of light to blind, then heal your compeers.  <br/>
<br/>
In a fight, however, it&#39;s not THAT effective as an offensive tool -<br/>
again, it&#39;s PvP where it shines.  Against beasties, you CAN FoL and then<br/>
fear them, but they always know exactly where to come back. <br/>
