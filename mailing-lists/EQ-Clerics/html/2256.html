<div id="ygrps-yiv-1603945567">The Epaulets are from lower guk and are a fairly common item I believe, <br/>
have never actually camped them myself.<br/>
<br/>
Ethernal Mist is the &quot;purple stuff&quot; that is now dropped by the clerics <br/>
of innrouk, or whatever that heathen god is, in the plane of hate.  The <br/>
girdle is dropped by fetid fiends in the plane of fear.<br/>
<br/>
I have no idea what the wreath ended up selling for, I didn&#39;t hang <br/>
around to find out.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t recommend replacing anything that has +wis on it unless you <br/>
are replacing it with a very nice item or are already over the 200 <br/>
wisdom cap.<br/>

a while yet, but it&#39;s nice to dream...<br/>

     <br/>
     <br/>
 </span></blockquote>LOL... 2000 plat eh?  How much did it end up selling for?   The runed <br/>
circlet is definately a better value.. and actually you can get that very <br/>
easily (even at my level) if you are willing to wait for that slow spawning <br/>
goblin preacher...<br/>
     <br/>
I wasn&#39;t planning on going for the cleric armor... but then I looked closer <br/>
and realized it actually is a little better than rubicite (except for the <br/>
obvious Rubi breastplate which had that nice healing aura on it)... and I <br/>
saw a cleric wearing most of the cleric armor the other day and it looked <br/>
really nice on him.  So I may try to get some of that, though I don&#39;t know <br/>
that I want to replace my bloodstained tunic which has +wisdom on it....<br/>
