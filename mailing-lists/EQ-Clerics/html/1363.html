<b>Subject:</b> Re: Buff Duration in New Patch and another Manastone cocktail <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1170676453">I was hunting in Lower Guk last night and I did seem to be casting buffs more<br/>
often, mostly on myself- on everyone else they were lasting maybe just a little<br/>
shorter, but not a huge difference.  One thing I know was running out a lot<br/>
faster was our Druid&#39;s Pack Regeneration.  That thing only lasted maybe a<br/>
battle.  I told him &quot;If it keeps running out, don&#39;t waste your mana&quot; so he only<br/>
cast it twice.<br/>
<br/>
Pack regen is great for downtime, don&#39;t get me wrong, especially when you have a<br/>
manastone.  But the duration is the key- I could stone to 1/2 life and be ready<br/>
for the next battle, even when I burned a little bit (I just love killing<br/>
undead).  When I tried that last night I was about 3/4 health when I got up to<br/>
90% mana, as regen had already gone bye bye (we cast it before pull so regen can<br/>
happen during battle).  Oh well, our group knew it&#39;s job so I didn&#39;t get hit too<br/>
much after the first big heals :)<br/>
