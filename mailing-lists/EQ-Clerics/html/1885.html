<div id="ygrps-yiv-1342315351">Okay, I am now lvl 10 and really concerned about this.  From what EVERYONE<br/>
tells me (which I totally disagree with and the whole subject matter makes<br/>
me sick) is that when older (25+) all we do is heal...no melee, no DD, just<br/>
heal and med.  First...is that true or can we still melee..I know we won&#39;t<br/>
exactly be able to solo melee...but as in a group or possibly as the only<br/>
tank?..and while on that subject, can we solo undead up into all our higher<br/>
lvls or do we still need help then too?  And finally the mana issue.  I am<br/>
dwarven cleric and have a 100 in strength and 103 in wisdom...will that be a<br/>
high enough wisdom to have proper mana to heal my group and such?  Any other<br/>
tips would be most helpful.<br/>

P.S.  Any good cleric websites with detailed spell descriptions (like how<br/>
much damage our spells deal, how much HPs our healing spells heal, and the<br/>
exact numbers on our buffs, etc)</div>
