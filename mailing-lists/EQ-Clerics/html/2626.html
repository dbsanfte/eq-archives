<div id="ygrps-yiv-1339134889">Pinzam use jasper, only less than a plat, Naltron use peridot, it runs for<br/>
around 10pp.  Make sure you always cast resist magic, resist cold or fire<br/>
on the dragon raids.  Resolution gives about same ac/hp bonus as SLN, but<br/>
it takes much much less mana.   However, SLN also gives regen.  Druid has<br/>
no armor buff, shield of words is the best ac buff in the game, but takes a<br/>
lot of mana to cast (300).  Make sure you know cleric&#39;s role in a dragon<br/>
raid.  Mostly do heals and resurrects and buffs, staying out of dragon&#39;s<br/>
range.  Also, wear as much resist magic, cold fire stuff as possible.  That<br/>
extra 40 wisdom don&#39;t do you any good when you are running around<br/>
mindlessly after you take a dragon roar.  Also, Vox raid is different drom<br/>
Naggie raid, as clerics are needed for their stuns to stop her complete<br/>
healing.  I would recommand going to www.castersrealm.com to check out all<br/>
the cleric spells, before you do anything.  6 death for dragon raid is a<br/>
lot, most people only die 3 times max on average raid.  Make sure you have<br/>
one of the divine or both memorized and active at all times.  Just a few<br/>
things i want to point out, for now.<br/>

&gt;Hello,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My RL friend who has a lvl 50 cleric is going to go on a 1 month vacation.<br/>
&gt;She has asked me to play her cleric for our guild when it&#39;s needed.  The<br/>
&gt;highest I&#39;ve ever gotten a cleric to is lvl 28.  Last night was the first<br/>
&gt;time I ever played a lvl 50 cleric and I have to admit it was like being<br/>
&gt;toss into the water without knowing how to swim.  We were doing a dragon run<br/>
&gt;of all things.  Anyway, the healing part I think I gotten down...I mainly<br/>
&gt;just cast superior heals...the time needed to cast a CH was just too nerve<br/>
&gt;racking for me.  I was told to cast panzia (sp?) symbol on caster and nalton<br/>
&gt;(sp?) on tanks (why that is so...I didn&#39;t bothered to ask...was a bit too<br/>
&gt;busy trying to figured out other stuff).  If there is a druid around then do<br/>
&gt;most clerics not cast Reso and AoF?  Most tanks were asking for SLN...were<br/>
&gt;they trying to split buff duty between druid/shaman/clerics?  Anyway, can<br/>
&gt;any lvl 49+ clerics out there give out advise on what you normally do in<br/>
&gt;highly stressful combat situation with multi groups going on.  Thanks a<br/>
&gt;bunch.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I died like 5 times last nite...hope that wasn&#39;t too unusual.<br/>
