<div id="ygrps-yiv-1227966667">Hunt rabid grizzlies in Qeynos hills; turn the pelts in for an extreme<br/>
amount of xp.  Rabid wolves are decent, too.<br/>
<br/>
Also, scarecrows in West Karana.<br/>
Get in a full group, and fight orcs or gnolls in highhold pass.<br/>
There is a ghoul camp in North Ro that would be good.  Stay away from<br/>
Derv camp #1, though.  Dorn B&#39;Dynn will mop the floor with you.<br/>
<br/>
Unrest would be good.  You could fight tormented dead, and probably<br/>
still get xp for death beetles.  Pretty far from where you are,<br/>
though.<br/>
<br/>
You could fight Orcs and panthers in Everfrost, near the Permafrost<br/>
entrance.  Leave the mammoths alone! :)<br/>
<br/>
Blackburrow, would be good, too.  You&#39;d need a group though.<br/>
<br/>
A lot of people might tell you to go to Oasis, but the loot completely<br/>
sucks there.<br/>
<br/>
As far as loot is concerned, the rabid grizzlies would be the best<br/>
for the amount of difficulty.  You get 1/2 plat and a spell (7gp) for<br/>
every pelt. Ghoul camp would be good, since they drop bronze weapons<br/>
sometimes.<br/>

&gt;Hi all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ok, beaten to death question, but I&#39;ll ask anyways.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Where will I gain good xp at lvl 16?  I have been hanging out in the East<br/>
&gt;Karana&#39;s and North Karana&#39;s lately.  I used to hunt Befallen, but find that<br/>
&gt;I am probably too strong for the 2nd level and too weak for the 3rd.  West<br/>
&gt;commons doesn&#39;t have much, and Beholder is now a limbo zone (lots of low<br/>
&gt;blues, and hi reds).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am interested in xp, but am concerned I am not making enough money, so<br/>
&gt;some good xp/loot combo areas would be good.  I must admit, i haven&#39;t<br/>
&gt;explored much beyond the West commons or the Karanas.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Brytewing, 16th level, the rathe.<br/>
