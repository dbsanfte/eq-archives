<div id="ygrps-yiv-2134279880">This is actually true. The mobs treat each pulse of the song as a separate<br/>
spell on top of the fact that it is being cast on every member in the group.<br/>
So Bards in a full group are casting six spells simultaneously as far as<br/>
mobs are concerned and those spells are going off every pulse.<br/>

I think you are forgetting that we clerics have the best taunt of all in our<br/>
spellbooks.   It is called heal.   I have even noticed that a bard singing<br/>
the healing song will pull more critters to them someone doing more damage.<br/>
Am I mistaken in this or is it really true?<br/>

&gt; Heh.. it won&#39;t work.   I mean there may be a slight taunting factor<br/>

&gt; as clerics we don&#39;t really want to taunt.   Especially at higher levels,<br/>
