<div id="ygrps-yiv-695925699">Ok, so then 6, kill-stealing Wizards can group together and do over 1,000<br/>
point of damage in a matter of seconds? It is better the way it is. Just<br/>
remember to train Dvinn to those kill stealers and you&#39;ll be alright ;)<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Please forgive, for I am new to this list, but here is my problem and <br/>
&gt; suggestion for Verant:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My number one problem with the game is kill stealing. This frustrates me<br/>
&gt; to <br/>
&gt; no end.  I can&#39;t begin to tell you how long I have been trying for a Shiny<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Brass Shield in Crushbone and how many kills have been stolen from me from<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; some mage hiding in a tree.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think the problem is how Verant determines who gets the kill. As I <br/>
&gt; understand it, the single person that inflicts the most damage is awarded <br/>
&gt; the kill.  This means that it does not matter if you are grouped and your <br/>
&gt; group does more damage than the spell caster.  Does this seem crazy to <br/>
&gt; anyone else.  It should work that the groups damage counts as one. I<br/>
&gt; believe <br/>
&gt; that this would cut down on the amount of kills that are stolen.  It seems<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; like an easy fix and it makes logical sense.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What is everyone else&#39;s opinion, and has anybody heard of Verant<br/>
&gt; commenting <br/>
&gt; on this issue?<br/>
