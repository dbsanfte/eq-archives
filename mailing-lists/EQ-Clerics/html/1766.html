<b>Subject:</b> RE: 1hb vs. 2hb (was: Question) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-54778336">I cannot understand how any Cleric cannot keep both skills maxed for their<br/>
level. I can understand how it could be difficult for a tank, seeing how<br/>
they have ALL the weapon choices to train in. But we have only 2 melee<br/>
skills to work on. Here&#39;s how I did it:<br/>
At 1st/2nd level the first thing I bought was a Worn Great Staff for around<br/>
2.5g for my 2HB skill. At this time I was primarily hunting skeletons in<br/>
Nektulos, and I don&#39;t know if I got lucky or not, but one of them spawned<br/>
with a Cracked Staff. Voila! My melee skill problems were then answered. By<br/>
4th level I had both skills maxed and have kept them maxed to this day. Now<br/>
I am 22nd level (115 skill) using a Staff of the Observers. Everytime I<br/>
level, I cast Hammer of Wrath and get 1HB maxed. Then I destroy it and go<br/>
back to my Staff, and of course by the time I level again 2HB will be maxed.<br/>
<br/>
Now, as to never meleeing, I don&#39;t see how you don&#39;t. My group never minds<br/>
the extra 100-125 points of damage I can dish out per battle. I usually<br/>
blast once to pull, jump into melee, then back out and heal as needed.<br/>
<br/>
Just some info and possible strategies to any newbies out there.<br/>

&gt; 	I would agree it is a personal choice :)  At level 40 I have both<br/>
&gt; 1HB and 2HB skills at about 100 which is about half of max for my level -<br/>
&gt; and honestly this is because for the past 15-20 levels I don&#39;t melee -<br/>
&gt; hardly ever.  Weapon/Shield slots for me are used to gain as much +wis as<br/>
&gt; possible ;)  I can whack a MOB if necessary - but I usually cast.<br/>
