Now, really, Bree, honestly think about that (&#39;cuz if you&#39;re being sarcastic, it wasn&#39;t coming across at all to me...).  Do you really think all the people at Verant are sitting there around a giant table, plotting how they&#39;re going to screw over the players, or throwing darts at a dartboard for &quot;Nerf of the Day&quot;?<br/>
  Tell me, have you ever been a head builder for a major MUD?  I can personally say I have, for almost 2 years, and so I understand them having to change game balance on the go.  As players get more powerful, in ways they could not possibly have done without another 4-6 more months of Beta, the &quot;ideal&quot; game balance can start to get tipped.  And things like that box do get overlooked.  Some things start out a good idea, and then turn out to be a bad idea for some reason (i.e. players acquiring them more easily than was originally intended).<br/>
  Certainly they knew about it beforehand.  &#39;Why didn&#39;t they just change it then?&#39;, you might ask?  Well, honestly I&#39;d rather see them fix major game bugs than tweak/fix a single item that until fairly recently, wasn&#39;t something that a large percentage of players could obtain.  Now that there&#39;s a considerably larger portion of high-level players, the number of such items will increase, and need to be put on higher priority.  Also, think of the massive size of that equipment database.  This might raise an implementation question, but I&#39;m not about to start on something like that, as this is off-topic enough.<br/>
&lt;/DEVIL&#39;S ADVOCATE&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Now that I&#39;m done with that, I can certainly see how somebody might be a little miffed at having such an item toned down, but honestly, deal with it.  Take a step back for a sec, and realize it&#39;s not the end of the world.  I&#39;m not attacking anyone personally, but c&#39;mon, relax, take it in stride and let it go.  It&#39;s just a game...  And if you wanna flame me, do it in private, my e-mail&#39;s listed down right after this.<br/>
