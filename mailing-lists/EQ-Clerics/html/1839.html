<div id="ygrps-yiv-130625791">I play on test, actually, and we have a similar problem in Unrest<br/>
because the average server count at max is about 320 people.  :)<br/>
I&#39;m not sure exactly where the undead reavers are.  A troll warrior<br/>
friend was pulling a few of them for us, and we stayed at the bridge.<br/>
He came back once with a griffawn, a gorge hound, a reaver, and a crag<br/>
spider!  Needless to say the wizard died..., but it was fun.<br/>
  Any site that has a decent EK map should show the location of the<br/>
undead reavers.  I think there is a camp of them somewhere.<br/>

&gt;Hail Curtis.<br/>
&gt;Ok, do you play on veeshan?  If not lemme give you a quick history of <br/>
&gt;unrest<br/>
&gt;:)<br/>
&gt;I first started playing this game in may, I didn&#39;t find a character I liked<br/>
&gt;until around amonth later.  I settled on a Gnome Warrior and played him <br/>
&gt;till<br/>
&gt;lvl 24.  Now, during my stint in unrest (lvl 16-23) It was a VERY popular<br/>
&gt;place.  There could be upwards of 115 ppl in there at the same time.<br/>
&gt;Basically, &#39;safety in numbers&#39;.  Now that I&#39;m high enough lvl to actually <br/>
&gt;go<br/>
&gt;there with my cleric, there&#39;s avg. about 30 ppl there.  Take 15 or so off<br/>
&gt;becaus they are lvl 30+, and your left with around  15 ppl for a group.. <br/>
&gt;Now,<br/>
&gt;14 of these are first time players, and there&#39;s me left.  Now I have found <br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt;group before, but left immediatly because I couldn&#39;t talk any sense into<br/>
&gt;them.  They insisted on pulling from certain places in the first floor, and<br/>
&gt;pulling from the second floor.  BIG MISTAKE<br/>
&gt;Pulling from the second floor (when no one is camping it) usually brings <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;ENTIRE second floor to you.  (then what do they do? run right towards the<br/>
&gt;group, instant death almost) Pulling from certain areas in the first floor,<br/>
&gt;pulls the ENTIRE floor.<br/>
&gt;So I left because I didn&#39;t want to continuasly die.<br/>
&gt;Oh and I try to stay away from soloing non dead because the delay on smite <br/>
&gt;is<br/>
&gt;so long.<br/>
&gt;Where are these Undead Reavers you speak of in East Karana?<br/>

&gt; &gt; I&#39;m 18th level, but I certainly hope I don&#39;t have this problem when I<br/>
&gt; &gt; get to level 20!  I would think that groups would still want 20th<br/>
&gt; &gt; level clerics if for no other reason than for Daring and Spirit Armor!<br/>
&gt; &gt; Admittedly, I&#39;m a little jealous that Druids at 19th get the same heal<br/>
&gt; &gt; spell I do, so why get a cleric, when the Druid serves the same<br/>
&gt; &gt; purpose at this level.  I kinda bothered me.<br/>
&gt; &gt;   I suspect you can solo with some success (or get some cleric friends<br/>
&gt; &gt; together) the undead reavers in East Karana, or you might still can<br/>
&gt; &gt; get xp (albeit probably not much) from scarecrows in WK.  I would<br/>
&gt; &gt; still think Unrest would want clerics, or start your own group!  You<br/>
&gt; &gt; might try Mistmoore, although 20 may be too low for that place, I<br/>
&gt; &gt; don&#39;t know.  You could probably solo crag spiders and gorge hounds<br/>
&gt; &gt; in EK, too.  You might try to get a group at the pickclaws in HH, too.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hmm, beyond that, I don&#39;t know.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Good luck! </span></blockquote></div>
