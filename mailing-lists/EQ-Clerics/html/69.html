<div id="ygrps-yiv-2053849633">Cancel Magic cancels BUFFS as well, it also goes in order of oldest to<br/>
most recent.   So if you have some good buffs on the character you have to<br/>
get rid of those before yo uget to hte blindness.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Go fight muddites in beholder.  You&#39;ll find a pretty damn good use for<br/>
&gt; cure blindness real quick.  Not to mention any other time one of your<br/>
&gt; party members gets blinded.  Or..  If you yourself get blinded while<br/>
&gt; soloing it kinda puts a kink in your gameplan.  Not being able to see<br/>
&gt; what&#39;s going on can cost you your life.  As with a few other cure<br/>
&gt; spells, it sometimes has to be cast more than once to be effective. &lt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have been using Cancel Magic effectively against the blindness that the Muddites cause. I have one question: Is it significantly faster to cast a Cure Blindness than Cancel Magic? I know cancel magic uses 50% more mana but it is so little anyway (20 -&gt; 30) that there is no point in purchasing the spell just for that. Besides the cancel magic works for a wider variety of things. Very useful when you are rooted, isn&#39;t it? Is there anything that could cause blindness and that cancel magic could not cure?<br/>
