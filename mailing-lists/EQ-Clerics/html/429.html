<div id="ygrps-yiv-459901156">when you take shots in EQ, they will appear as bmp files in your<br/>
EverQuest dtoirectory, and you can open em like that and save them as<br/>
whatever file format you want...i use paintshop pro 5, but anything that<br/>
can read bmp and change em to jpeg will work (:<br/>
