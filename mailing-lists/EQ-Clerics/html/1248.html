<div id="ygrps-yiv-1612952277">at the same time, fennin has this because the new people joining the game<br/>
see fennin with the highest amount, and not understanding how the game<br/>
works....they head to where the most are naturally.  then they get a lil<br/>
higher....dont want to lose the character, and they are then stuck.  They<br/>
have no way currently to change to another server, and after a while of<br/>
beocming frustrated LEAVE the game.  Fennin has a constant flood of people<br/>
in almost ALL zones.  If someone finds something new, a new spawn point<br/>
which is decent, a new piece of EQ, etc....people FLOOD that zone.  About<br/>
the only zones/areas I see uncrowded in EQ are zones/areas that I get<br/>
absolutly NO exp from....none what so ever in my currently lvl.   Befallen<br/>
is even overcrowded (i&#39;ve seen 60 people in the folks)  Unrest commonly has<br/>
60 people in it  aday...most bitching about stealing kills.  I&#39;m actually<br/>
beginning to despise playing EQ because of this fact myself.  You cant go<br/>
somewhere with friends and have fun because when you do, you find people in<br/>
that spot you guys planned to hit, and if you try to join, they bitch at<br/>
you.  When people start to leave, and you start seeing websites posting how<br/>
bad it is....more and more often....you&#39;ll see an outflow of people.  How<br/>
many people have you all seen leave Fennin, or any high lag server due to<br/>
frustrattion?  My bet would be the same amount as the new people you&#39;ve seen<br/>
coming in.<br/>

&gt; The real shame about a game like EQ is that once it&#39;s gone no one can play<br/>
<br/>
&gt; anymore.  Guess it&#39;s one of the drawbacks to massively multiplayer<br/>
games...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I hope it isn&#39;t dying any time soon.<br/>

&gt; &gt;I&#39;ve been reading on the EQ newsgroup that a good bit of ppl think EQ is<br/>
&gt; &gt;already starting to die.  Many are just bored of the game and are quiting<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt;or<br/>
&gt; &gt;getting ready to, others are getting tired of Verant changing everything <br/>
&gt; &gt;and<br/>
&gt; &gt;some of it is for the worse.  I&#39;ve read where they are saying it&#39;s too<br/>
late<br/>
&gt; &gt;to save EQ, some even say even the new addon will not save it cause it&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; &gt;still be the same game with just some new things.  And yeah it might<br/>
spice<br/>
&gt; &gt;it up a bit, but for how long, I give it 3-4 months tops.  After 3-4<br/>
months<br/>
&gt; &gt;the power gamers will already have the extra lvls, everyone should have <br/>
&gt; &gt;been<br/>
&gt; &gt;in all the new zones, had a chance to play the new lizardman race.  So<br/>
once<br/>
&gt; &gt;that happens it&#39;s gonna be right back to where it is now.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Some are waiting for Asheron&#39;s Call and others are waiting for<br/>
Middle-Earth<br/>
&gt; &gt;to be released.  Will AC or ME finish off EQ?  I guess time will tell but<br/>
&gt; &gt;since theres like 3-4 other RPGs coming out by the year 2000 I say one of<br/>
&gt; &gt;them will put an end to EQ.  And if EQ does die to fast it&#39;s no ones<br/>
fault<br/>
&gt; &gt;but Verants for not listening to the paying customers, they listen to a<br/>
few<br/>
&gt; &gt;but not the whole.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Even tho EQ is a very good game it can&#39;t or won&#39;t be around forever.<br/>
