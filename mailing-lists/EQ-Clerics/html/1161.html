&gt; They have done so well in this game at keeping it balanced that as<br/>
&gt; long as<br/>
&gt; they say the stunned thing was done on purpose and not just a bug I<br/>
&gt; can let<br/>
&gt; it go.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s killed me though and that&#39;s always disappointing, and can even<br/>
&gt; lead to<br/>
&gt; many explitives.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I guess I think the game balance is good, and while my self interest<br/>
&gt; wants<br/>
&gt; my character to be more powerful, I can understand if the balance bean<br/>
&gt; counters think it is correct.<br/>

&gt; Hey, do any of you Bind Wound? At 255 you should be able to heal 63 or<br/>
&gt; 64<br/>
&gt; points with one bandage. How does that compare with meditation and<br/>
&gt; healing<br/>
&gt; spells? Maybe not for combat but for post combat recovery?<br/>

bandage skill above 100.</div>
