<div id="ygrps-yiv-1565586104">I would add that you will need just above &#39;amiable&#39; to get the quest.<br/>
*Just* getting to amiable won&#39;t do it.  You have to hit amiable, and<br/>
then do a few more quests to raise it further into amiable.<br/>
<br/>
I would also suggest, if you do the blessed oil quest, you bind<br/>
yourself in one of the places.  That way, you can just gate back and<br/>
save yourself at least half the walk. For instance, bind yourself<br/>
right in front of the priest that gives the quest.  Get the quest, and<br/>
then walk to WK, deliver the flask, and gate back; wash, rinse,<br/>
repeat.<br/>

&gt;Chris, you can raise your fraction by doing the prayer bead quest and also <br/>
&gt;by<br/>
&gt;killing the rabid wolves and bear in Qeynos hills. You turn the rabid pelts<br/>
&gt;into the Temple of  Life for fraction and experience. I always tried for <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;bears as you get good experience and a spell that if you can not use you <br/>
&gt;can<br/>
&gt;sell it. Just be careful you do not run into Holly or the Ranger who will <br/>
&gt;kill<br/>
&gt;you, even though  you are getting rid of the diseased population.<br/>
&gt;My fraction problem was the opposite in Rivervale and I had to spend a lot <br/>
&gt;of<br/>
&gt;time building up my fraction there by doing quests. Good luck<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hi all,<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I want to do the SSoL quest.  I am a 16th level Hafling cleric of<br/>
&gt; &gt; Bristlebane.  The problem, I think lies with my faction in the Temple of<br/>
&gt; &gt; Life. Aeston Wemur cons apprehensive, and when I ask him for the<br/>
&gt; &gt; instructions, he gives them to me, until I ask him about travelling <br/>
&gt;afar,<br/>
&gt; &gt; after which he says that the word is out not to trust me.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; THis particualarily sucks because I gave him the honeyjum, and instead <br/>
&gt;of<br/>
&gt; &gt; giving me the potion, he said my name was bad, not to trust me, etc. And <br/>
&gt;he<br/>
&gt; &gt; took my honeyjum!!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; So, my question is, how do I raise my faction with the Temple of Life?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
