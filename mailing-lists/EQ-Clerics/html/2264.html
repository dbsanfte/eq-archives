<div id="ygrps-yiv-294579237">I would agree with both of you guys, but want to add something you missed. <br/>
<br/>
Those tactics are great and wonderful.. but don&#39;t forget EQ is in real time, it&#39;s not turn-based game.. lag plays a MAJOR role in those nasty battles... we go fear and even with my connection ( 1.5mbps/384kbps ADSL ) I do get alot of lag and heals sometimes &quot;reach&quot; the target when he&#39;s dead or almost dead. Or we  were trying Vox on Bertox... yeah.. try those tactics there too :) soo many ppl around you there the lag gets unbearble.<br/>
<br/>
I would agree that those tacicts will work almost all the time in mid 20s-30s since you don&#39;t really need 4 groups ( the #1 reason of lag )  to hunt in a dungeon :)..<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 cents..<br/>

       That was a very good story and really good tactics for any clerics<br/>
       around your level.<br/>
<br/>
       Everyone keep in mind that tactics vary depending on what level you<br/>
       are.<br/>
<br/>
       If your below L20 it won&#39;t hurt to mele during battle since your mele<br/>
       skills are still fairly adaquet (just as long as you don&#39;t forget you<br/>
       are the healer of the group).<br/>
<br/>
       Once you get to higher levels mele is effectively useless for a cleric<br/>
       and is only something you do if you have full mana and no one needs a<br/>
       heal.  Also taunting mobs on you is the last thing you want to do.<br/>
       I&#39;ve recently been doing a lot of fear/hate fighting and if you get<br/>
       one of thoes mobs on you, unless your lucky enough to get a da/db off,<br/>
       you can be dead in 3 seconds (130+ quad attacks hurt bad even with my<br/>
       750+ ac and 1200+ hp).<br/>
<br/>
       In Hate there is no running to the zone for safety and the strategy<br/>
       used when a train is pulled is for the cleric to camp out asap (no<br/>
       being the hero and staying to heal because it won&#39;t make a difference)<br/>
       and live to be able to log back on in 5 min to rez everyone (it would<br/>
       get very expensive if everyone had to be gated in after every train,<br/>
       200+ plat a trip for the reagent).<br/>
<br/>
       In Fear it&#39;s a little different.  Assuming you are able to run in to<br/>
       the designated camp spot without dieing (2 for 3 on initial run in&#39;s)<br/>
       clerics bind themselves there (can&#39;t bind in hate).  Corpse recovery<br/>
       is a lot harder in fear due to mobs that teleport and fear you away<br/>
       from the camp site (this also pulls trains).  We usually have monks<br/>
       that pull the corpses back to the camp site for the clerics to rez.  I<br/>
       have to admit it was kinda scay being bound in Fear the first time.<br/>
       If you are about to die you /q or hit the reset button on your comp<br/>
       because you don&#39;t want to pop right back up in the middle of the<br/>
       battle naked.<br/>
<br/>
       Sorry, guess I kinda got off topic.  Anyway good post Daku.<br/>
