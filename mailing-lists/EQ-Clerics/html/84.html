      I too had the same question, I have a human cleric and have a max strength of 93 I believe(Sorry Guys who have 65 strength but that must get really annoying getting encumbered by carring one rusty sword:)P) And actually I dont have really high enough str. to wear full plate but I was in Lake Rathetear and saw a Gm I asked her about it I said clerics are supposta be able to wear plate but My strength is to low and he said that thats oaky there is stuff out there that will bring it up enough to wear plate.. heres a secret he also told me Shhhh....(Supposadily there is plate armor out there that adds strength Hmmm...  rumor maybe or maybe not....)<br/>
