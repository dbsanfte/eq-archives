<div id="ygrps-yiv-1433901458">Actually, I have never had that happen to me... the one item I accientally <br/>
looted a corpse that was not my turn, I left the item there...The time I <br/>
took an item off a corpse that I THOUGHT was mine... I gave him the bronze <br/>
item that it had.  The time that a paladin (Ehtaw)took my corpse, and I told <br/>
him that it was my turn, HE gave me the 3 items it had and said he was <br/>
sorry.<br/>
<br/>
My ranger(Galian) friend told me striaght up if I fought an elephant that he <br/>
would sit and watch me die(this was after I made a comment, (kidding) that <br/>
we should hunt them (I knew Galian would not do it)).  We then had a long IC <br/>
discussion on Tuanre and the different forms and what her wishs where ect <br/>
ect ect... it was fun it lasted over 10 mins just this discussion.<br/>
<br/>
I am sorry you have gotten bad groups... that happens a lot... I have been <br/>
really really lucky with the fact that I started out with a couple of <br/>
friends going in, and then even more lucky with the fact that I found others <br/>
just recently that I now game with as well... and let me tell ya I do have <br/>
fun.... the one thing that I do have some problems with is .... Why am I at <br/>
this damn bird village and why in the name of Tunare am I killing this damn <br/>
birds for... what did they do.... OR<br/>
<br/>
Why am I killing these damn frog guys????? hmmmm<br/>
<br/>
ahh well cant win them all huh?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Jaxim AND his controller...<br/>

&gt;  I disagree whole- heartedly. I have played RPGs since the age of 8 (I am <br/>
&gt;26<br/>
&gt;now), and I have played many multi-player RPGs (when they were first <br/>
&gt;invented<br/>
&gt;around 1986 or so)  where roleplaying was great, and one of them was very<br/>
&gt;recent- a year ago to be exact. Of course there were questions where <br/>
&gt;someone<br/>
&gt;will ask what level you are or the monsters hit points, but there was also <br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt;great deal of roleplaying, so it didnt matter -  I have even  been OOC on<br/>
&gt;*more* then one occasionof times myself. But people were there because it <br/>
&gt;was<br/>
&gt;a different world to escape to. Norrath to me is an empty world.<br/>
&gt;   I have never been in a game where so many people ripped me off so they <br/>
&gt;can<br/>
&gt;get more money to buy that next cool item.  I can understand if your<br/>
&gt;character is a thief or some other mischievous being that follows a deity <br/>
&gt;of<br/>
&gt;that sort- but  how many times has this happened to you -<br/>
&gt;   1)  A  paladin left you for death while you were fighting off monsters- <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;he/she ran without thought of honor or disgrace - as what he would say to<br/>
&gt;explain the situation - &quot; I didnt want to  lose &quot; a half bar of <br/>
&gt;experience&#39;&#39;<br/>
&gt;   2) A  holy cleric  said to you &quot;It&#39;s a nosave lightstone&quot; in Kerra isle<br/>
&gt;(Before nosave lightstones were implemented in Kerra isle)<br/>
&gt;  3) A person following a deity of &#39;goodness&#39; loot every corpse in sight <br/>
&gt;even<br/>
&gt;though it wasnt his/her turn.<br/>
&gt;  4) A person diband your group to join another group for more &quot; <br/>
&gt;experience&#39;&quot;<br/>
&gt;rather then enjoying the moment of adventurers  for the cause of good<br/>
&gt;adventure.<br/>
&gt;  5)  A ranger or druid killing a bear, lion, elephant, etc - for &quot;exp or <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;increase my &#39;tailoring skill&#39; &quot;<br/>
&gt;  Etc, etc..the list goes on. I expected these things to happen, but I have<br/>
&gt;never met a single perons in EQ that actually tried  to adhere to their<br/>
&gt;character.  The world of EQ is full of greed and who can be the next &#39;<br/>
&gt;coolest high level character&#39;.<br/>
