<div id="ygrps-yiv-1989056588">actually, that does make a lot of sense.....it would seem that hte higher lv you<br/>
are, the more exp you can give back.....i just know now that i have to go thru<br/>
hell all over again....lv 40&#39;s gonna SUCK majorly......o btw, i have a question<br/>
about the staff of the observer while i&#39;m thinking about it....it has one charge<br/>
of the sentinel spell....&lt;which is a crock ir should be unlimited like the<br/>
jboots&gt; but is there anyway to recharge it or maybe does it recharge on it&#39;s own<br/>
&lt;that was suggested to me by a guildmate&gt; or do i just have to get a new staff?<br/>
which would suck there too....any info would be greatly appreciated on this...i<br/>
love that staff, and the sentinel effect was really kewl and would come in handy<br/>
in places like cazic and lower guk....<br/>

&gt; Res not only depends on which form you use but also the level of the person<br/>
&gt; you use it on, i am lvl 34 now and of course mine gives back no XP at all, i<br/>
&gt; have been resed by a 39 cleric and have noticed a slight change in my XP<br/>
&gt; nothing really noteable, however just last night 2 party members died just<br/>
&gt; before I arrived in Solusek&#39;s Eye. there was a lvl 49 cleric there , of<br/>
&gt; course with the best res spell, my wizard friend who is also lvl 34 got half<br/>
&gt; a bubble of XP back, however, my paladin friend who is in Hell lvl 30, those<br/>
&gt; of you who have reached 30 know about this, he did not notice any movement<br/>
&gt; in his XP bar after res.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hope this helps<br/>
