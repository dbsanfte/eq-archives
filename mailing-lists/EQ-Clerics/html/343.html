<div id="ygrps-yiv-844889004">I&#39;ve only been in Unrest like once so far and that was on Lvl 14, got killed<br/>
had to search of corpse and once I got it I got outta there.  But I&#39;m not<br/>
sure how many people were in there at that time, was enough cause it was<br/>
laggy in there!!  Now that I&#39;m on Lvl 16 (for the 3rd time), I think I&#39;m<br/>
gonna go to Unrest in the morning and find me a group.  Just hope I don&#39;t<br/>
lose Lvl 16 again, kept losing it to stupid Mino&#39;s and once to the Mino<br/>
Hero.<br/>
