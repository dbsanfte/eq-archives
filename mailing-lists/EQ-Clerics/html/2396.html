<div id="ygrps-yiv-321953463">Ya know, the monks did this already last week about Feign Death, as far as I could see it didn&#39;t make a damn bit of difference.  Don&#39;t get me wrong Verant irriates me more than you know, but in my opinion clerics as far from the ones who should be complaining.  Look at the poor paladins for christ sake, now there&#39;s a class that needs help.<br/>
Have you all taken the time to notice that our quest armor had stats to it, perhaps that is why the AC is not as high as ruby.(I know the stats suck) but the AC is better than a BS tunic and Gator legs which I have been wearing for over 10 levels.<br/>
My only request would be that they give a wisdom stat to some of the pieces.<br/>
anyway, when I was at the monk one,  not purposely I was trying to kill guards,  the whole zone crashed, almost got me killed(that would have been fun).  After everyone left(the monks) Aradune made an appearance in West freeport Where he cautiously answered a few questions, not about the monks of course.<br/>
I think a show of force is great, I probably won&#39;t paticipate as I don&#39;t really have a problem with the armor. If your point was to get wisdom stats I  would say cool, but verant is not gonna budge on that.  There was rumor that they would add wisdom to  the legs, then there was one rumor that they would add wisdom to the BP, so I&#39;m not holding my breath.<br/>
Yes cleric armor is hard to get I have only 2 pieces some of it I am not going to bother with, paladin armor is much harder and more expensive to get.  Besides the fact that their class sucks after lvl 40 they are also getting a bum deal on the armor.  Don&#39;t get me wrong one of my best friends is a pally, he is so frustrated with his class and verant will do nothing about it.  Aradunes direct quote &quot; I think paladin&#39;s are great, my other character is a paladin&quot;<br/>
Let me put it this way, clerics have More AC than casters and most druids.  Clerics have l Less AC than tanks. my AC is usually between 700 and 741, my tanks AC (ranger and pally) is between 750 and 800 or so(monks and warriors I believe are much higher).  Should we have the same AC as a tank, WE are not tanks. I think we got it damn good as it is. Hell I made it to level 50 without a problem.<br/>
<br/>
Let the flaming begin, would love to hear your comments on this.<br/>

  Subject: [EQ-Clerics] Cleric Sit-in<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I am proud to announce that the Cleric Sit-In will take place on December 3, 1999 at 6PM PST (9PM EST) on Fennin Ro in the city of Freeport. Our purpose is to show Verant that a great number of Clerics and their friends are dissatisfied with the current state of the Cleric-only armor quests that were meant to replace Rubicite. The Cleric-only armor presently has two flaws that we would like to see corrected. One, the quests themselves take a ridiculously long amount of time to complete (days or weeks for just one piece), and two, the armor class (AC) of the Cleric-only armor is not on par with classes of its type (The new Cleric-only armor&#39;s AC is actually *lower* than the original Rubicite). To receive more information about these concerns and to find out how you can show your support, please visit <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://freepages.ugo.com/clericsrequest.">http://freepages.ugo.com/clericsrequest.</a> And to those of you who already plan on participating in this event please check the information page, as several updates have been made. I look forward to seeing everyone there, and in all hopes we can get Verant to listen to our suggestions. Thank you all for your support.<br/>
<br/>
  Sincerely,<br/>
<br/>
