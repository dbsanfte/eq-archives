<div id="ygrps-yiv-763810172">ok...upon making 39 &lt;yay (:&gt; i rezzed a couple ppl with<br/>
resusitate....but they say that exp didn&#39;t move...i rezzed one person<br/>
once, and another twice, one for each corpse.....the 2nd person said he<br/>
seen exp regained from the 2nd one, but not from the 1st, even tho he<br/>
got the mssg &quot;you have gained some exp back from the<br/>
