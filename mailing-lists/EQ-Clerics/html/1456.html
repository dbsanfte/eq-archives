 <br/>
 Thank you,<br/>

I play 4 charachters, my highest and favourite my 25th level cleric - with <br/>
that are a 12 Ranger 16 warrior 21 Mage.... I add that info for this <br/>
reason... my non-cleric charachters group with clerics and so I get a view <br/>
from both sides.<br/>
<br/>
My adice to the level 9 is this.... set the strategy for the group at the <br/>
start.... easy enough to say group with the same people - not always <br/>
practical, and though I have regular hunt partners and am reasonably well <br/>
known at early levels people are leveling at different rates and group make <br/>
ups can change quickly.... The cleric calls the shots - when to attack and <br/>
when to run.... signals during the fight that their mana is getting low... <br/>
that they are medding... that they need a mob being pulled off them.... tells <br/>
the group ro run.... I find that groups will very quickly understand your <br/>
worth and defer battle startegy to you if you keep it simple.... if they <br/>
don&#39;t time to look for another group. I too like others consider myself the <br/>
last line of defence and will hold the mob while my group gets away, I don&#39;t <br/>
want to be doing this because of repeated stupidity of a group or group <br/>
member that starts another battle before I the Cleric am ready... TELL them <br/>
to WAIT,<br/>
<br/>
At the level I am now I will rarely group with starngers.... they copuld kill <br/>
me or I could kill them... for a Cleric to be at his best the group eeds to <br/>
have complete trust in him, that comes over time.<br/>
<br/>
Develop the strategy and style of play that you enjoy most... for me shooting <br/>
out a DD can be better than a heal drawing the mob onto me and relieving the <br/>
party member being hit... we have decent hps and mele defence if not attack <br/>
and can TAKE some hits for the group while the mob is finished... tends to be <br/>
a tactic I use when there are 2 or 3 of us, ie takling the dmage that <br/>
otherwise would have been taken by my group member and which I would have had <br/>
to heal. LOTS to think about being a cleric... MUCH more than any of the <br/>
other charachters I play, and without any doubt I believe the cleric to be <br/>
the most influential and essential party member,,,, play it well and you are <br/>
a STAR.... make mistakes as we all do and you are a Villain... what other <br/>
class has such profile ;-)<br/>

ps My Warrior is called Rolla.... trust me a warrior cleric combination is <br/>
GREAT fun.... GREAT duo... if you see me I am always VERY happy to stanmd <br/>
there and slug it out while my fleeow clerics keep me in action ;-) send me a <br/>
tell.... keep the faith.... and keep em alive whatever you have to do.</div>
