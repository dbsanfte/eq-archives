<b>Subject:</b> Re: Cleric Tactics Pre/During/Post Battle <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-913331887">That was a very good story and really good tactics for any clerics <br/>
     around your level.<br/>
     <br/>
     Everyone keep in mind that tactics vary depending on what level you <br/>
     are.<br/>
     <br/>
     If your below L20 it won&#39;t hurt to mele during battle since your mele <br/>
     skills are still fairly adaquet (just as long as you don&#39;t forget you <br/>
     are the healer of the group).<br/>
     <br/>
     Once you get to higher levels mele is effectively useless for a cleric <br/>
     and is only something you do if you have full mana and no one needs a <br/>
     heal.  Also taunting mobs on you is the last thing you want to do.  <br/>
     I&#39;ve recently been doing a lot of fear/hate fighting and if you get <br/>
     one of thoes mobs on you, unless your lucky enough to get a da/db off, <br/>
     you can be dead in 3 seconds (130+ quad attacks hurt bad even with my <br/>
     750+ ac and 1200+ hp).<br/>
     <br/>
     In Hate there is no running to the zone for safety and the strategy <br/>
     used when a train is pulled is for the cleric to camp out asap (no <br/>
     being the hero and staying to heal because it won&#39;t make a difference) <br/>
     and live to be able to log back on in 5 min to rez everyone (it would <br/>
     get very expensive if everyone had to be gated in after every train, <br/>
     200+ plat a trip for the reagent).<br/>
     <br/>
     In Fear it&#39;s a little different.  Assuming you are able to run in to <br/>
     the designated camp spot without dieing (2 for 3 on initial run in&#39;s) <br/>
     clerics bind themselves there (can&#39;t bind in hate).  Corpse recovery <br/>
     is a lot harder in fear due to mobs that teleport and fear you away <br/>
     from the camp site (this also pulls trains).  We usually have monks <br/>
     that pull the corpses back to the camp site for the clerics to rez.  I <br/>
     have to admit it was kinda scay being bound in Fear the first time.  <br/>
     If you are about to die you /q or hit the reset button on your comp <br/>
     because you don&#39;t want to pop right back up in the middle of the <br/>
     battle naked.<br/>
     <br/>
     Sorry, guess I kinda got off topic.  Anyway good post Daku.<br/>
