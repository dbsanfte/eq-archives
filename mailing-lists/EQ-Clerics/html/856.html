Ostensibly, the reason there are certain NoTrade/NoDrop items is to<br/>
prevent farming items out - either through camping or through having<br/>
higher level characters obtain quest items for you (for instance,<br/>
crafted armor, the Brewer&#39;s Compendium, et alia).  I don&#39;t agree with<br/>
the philosophy, but it is something Verant sees as a solution.<br/>
<br/>
Lore Items are just to make sure that people don&#39;t go around<br/>
dual-wielding the PGT.<br/>
