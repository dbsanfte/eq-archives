<div id="ygrps-yiv-492991057">I have been following this thread and wanted to let you know about something<br/>
that just happened to me that is a good example.<br/>
<br/>
I had my 5th Bard at the Orc lift in GFay sitting to heal up and got a tell<br/>
from someone asking to help him locate his corpse in LFay.  I told him I was<br/>
rather young to wandering LFay yet and he said he would protect me okay so I<br/>
agreed.  He was a named Druid and we took off with me invisible and SOW&#39;d.<br/>
I found his corpse for him and he asked me whether I wanted cash or equip.<br/>
Well this bardling has been very lucky in that they were given full bronze<br/>
armor and 5 instruments plus about 30 plat by someone leaving the game when<br/>
they were level 2.   The armor is still in the bank and the bard wears PW<br/>
and cloth because that is the way I am.  I did buy a mino axe though.   Well<br/>
anyway, I told the druid that if he would just get me back to GFay that<br/>
would be enough.<br/>
<br/>
At the entrance he again asked me if I would not accept a tip.   I told him<br/>
that yes I would accept a small one expecting a pp or two maybe.  Well he<br/>
tipped me 50pp.   Needless to say I was stunned but accepted.   50pp to a<br/>
5th level is a fortune for sure.<br/>
<br/>
What a crazy world for sure we all adventure in.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, Yilari was given two +2 earrings today so she is in hog-heaven<br/>
also.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all who gave advice on 14th level spells.  She really appreciated<br/>
it a lot.  And thanks again for your advice in the past.  It has helped to<br/>
make her a good cleric I feel.  Today she had to leave her group at Derv<br/>
camp 2 in N. Ro.   As she was about to zone out she heard shout asking for a<br/>
cleric to join their group.   The party already had a shaman who was also<br/>
14.  She took this as a high complement to how she had helped the party that<br/>
day and what her loss meant to them.<br/>
<br/>
Good hunting all,<br/>
