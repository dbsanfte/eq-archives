I have obtained everything but the gloves and chestplate (two of the hardest<br/>
pieces probably).  Wow, I mean they really give Everquest a great name!  I<br/>
get to sit in Befallen for hours, and hours killing waiting for a lucky roll<br/>
of the dice.  After I&#39;m done, I get to go over to Dagnors Cauldron, and<br/>
compete with every druid on the server for Bilge, this is a great set of<br/>
quests!  I can&#39;t believe with all the changes, that once again the cleric<br/>
was over looked.  For christs sake the druid got his tracking raised!  Oh<br/>
sorry, those poor druids help em out some more, they aren&#39;t getting enough!<br/>
&lt;end rant&gt;<br/>

  Warning... a serious rant follows:<br/>
<br/>
  [Rant begins]<br/>
<br/>
  I just read the patch notes for the new patch and I must say I am<br/>
EXTREMELY displeased.   I&#39;ve been hearing rumors for a couple of weeks from<br/>
many different sources that this new patch was going to improve the<br/>
situations clerics have with the HORRIBLE camps the have to do to get their<br/>
armor.   Well, this patch seems to have enhancements for just about everyone<br/>
except clerics.  Not one single thing in it to effect clerics.  Even the<br/>
armor of Ro, they say they are chaning it to increase the drops.  That is<br/>
just BS.  I will be the first to admit that the paladin armor quests are<br/>
hard.  They are very very hard.  But they aren&#39;t hard becasue of the rarity<br/>
of drops!!!!  Most of their stuff drops relatively often... though it is<br/>
hard to get (i.e. the caudrons in mistmoore).    How many days now have I<br/>
been camping that freaking Aviak in the OOT???  Just about every cleric i&#39;ve<br/>
talked to who is trying to get that, has been camping it for like 2 months<br/>
and not gotten it.  Those who have gotten it say it took them about 2<br/>
months.  What&#39;s worse is that I still have 3 or 4 camps to do that are as<br/>
bad or worse.  This is absolutely absurd.  People like me with jobs and<br/>
lives outside of EQ cannot possibly do these quests and it just pisses me<br/>
off to no end.    I had thought that there was going to be some relief with<br/>
his patch... maybe there will be and it just wasn&#39;t documented... but seeing<br/>
as how they documented enhancements for just about every single other person<br/>
in norrath  I really doubt it.   I guess all the feedbacks from every cleric<br/>
in Norrath just doesn&#39;t matter to Verant.<br/>
<br/>
  [rant done]<br/>
<br/>
  Heh.. well i won&#39;t stop trying for the armor.. i&#39;m determined to get it<br/>
which makes me wonder about my own sanity since i probably won&#39;t even wear<br/>
it in most situations.  I just want it for pride.. and it will make<br/>
something very nice to wear to events like weddings and stuff.    Though<br/>
it&#39;ll be months and months before i have it anyway...<br/>
