<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-797042998">Does anyone know what is going on?   I got disconnected about thirty min ago<br/>
and can&#39;t get back in at all.   I get that unable to connect with login<br/>
server message.<br/>
<br/>
Also has anyone heard what high quality bear pelts sell for?   My ranger got<br/>
one in Misty and a merchant offered him close to 2gp.  He then put it up for<br/>
auction since he knew that it is used for those backpacks.   The person who<br/>
bought it told him they sell for closer to 20pp.  This is an 11th ranger and<br/>
he sure could have used the coins as he is saving for his combine longsword<br/>
now.<br/>

Sorry to be off topic on the cleric list with this.<br/>
