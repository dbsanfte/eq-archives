<div id="ygrps-yiv-778645351">Rose, the dragons&#39; spells are all AoE and will get you even when you stand<br/>
out of healing range of your party.   I&#39;ve learned that it makes no<br/>
difference if I stand on the steps (at Nag) or right behind my tanks in<br/>
front of the dragon as to damage I take.  And you MUST be in healing range<br/>
of your party, otherwise why be there?  One VERY interesting thing I have<br/>
discovered tho......on the last two dragon raids I positioned myself BEHIND<br/>
the dragon, almost under his/her butt.  Guess what....I did not suffer<br/>
nearly the dmg from their spells I did when I was in front of them yet was<br/>
still in healing range of my party.  And I never got physically hit,<br/>
although I rarely do unless I get summoned, then I get clawed big time.<br/>
<br/>
I assume all you dragon hunters out there are aware that in order for your<br/>
nukers&#39; spells to not be resisted and do max dmg you must have them<br/>
positioned and casting directly UNDER the dragons&#39; bellies? That is the<br/>
vulnerable spot, where they are the least resistant and more susceptible to<br/>
damage.<br/>
<br/>
Also, Rose..make dang sure you keep BOTH of your Invulnerable spells up when<br/>
doing these high level hunts.  Divine Aura and Divine Barrier.  I have<br/>
survived many a dragon raid or a bad FG pull  to be able to keep my party<br/>
alive by casting one of these on me early enough before I was almost dead.<br/>
Be sure to tell your party members when you cast it tho, so another healer<br/>
doesn&#39;t waste mana trying to heal you.<br/>

&gt; I want to thank everyone for taking the time to reply to my post.  Our<br/>
guild<br/>
&gt; is doing another dragon run again tonight or planes =( (at least that&#39;s<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; rumor) I am more nervous then I can say.  Thanks for all the advise...I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; printed out all of y&#39;all&#39;s replies so I can read it while I play...EGAD<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s a confidence builder there isn&#39;t it?!  Good thing the tanks in my<br/>
&gt; group won&#39;t know ;P<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll try not to die as much tonight...dont want my friend to come back to<br/>
&gt; find she now has a lvl 48 character or something =P<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Last night, after dying so much, I started to make sure I kept a really<br/>
&gt; really really good distance from the battle.  Hope that&#39;s the way to do<br/>
&gt; it...I was so good at keeping the distance that I couldn&#39;t cast at the<br/>
tanks<br/>
&gt; cause they were &quot;out of range&quot; =/ So I wasted a few precious second trying<br/>
&gt; to get closer to the battle to heal while the health bar was going down<br/>
&gt; steadily...was too stressful.  Then I got close enough, maybe too close,<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; heal and die...again...*sigh*  On the bright side...I was the only one in<br/>
my<br/>
&gt; group that die majority of the time...all the tanks were kept alive pretty<br/>
&gt; well most of the time...can&#39;t say the same for the enchanter and the<br/>
shammie<br/>
&gt; in my group though =/  They went down too fast for me to heal.  I&#39;m pretty<br/>
&gt; sure I&#39;ll get the exact science of this sooner or later =/<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have no idea being a cleric can be this stressful.<br/>
