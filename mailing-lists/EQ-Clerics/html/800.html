<b>Subject:</b> Fix for EQ.... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-908143989">Today on a newsgroup there was a post and it was some guys ideas on how to<br/>
make EQ a lot better.  For one he stated we should lose NO exp when we die,<br/>
said traveling without armor or weapon to get our corpse is bad enough.  I<br/>
disagree, if we lost no exp then the game would be less hard to do.  Die get<br/>
no punishment for dying would suck, even tho losing exp can suck but it&#39;s<br/>
fair.<br/>
Another one was to have it to where magic users could only bind themselves<br/>
in places that we can bind non-magic users.  We&#39;re the ones doing the<br/>
binding we have the right to be able to bind out side a city.  Plus we&#39;re<br/>
the ones NICE enough to bind non-magic users or people that just don&#39;t have<br/>
bind yet.<br/>
He also said we shouldn&#39;t be able to have our spell book back after we die<br/>
till we loot our corpse.  I see really nothing wrong with us having our<br/>
spell book at all times, considering a warrior or monk can fight well enough<br/>
without a weapon.  We get attacked with no spells or weapon and we stand no<br/>
chance unless its a very weak monster.<br/>
So really all his ideas wouldn&#39;t fix EQ it would make it worse.  Sounds like<br/>
he&#39;s just a angery warrior.<br/>
