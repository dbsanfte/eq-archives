<div id="ygrps-yiv-1903047211">My public apologies then for my statement.   Still your choice of words in<br/>
both of your messages does leave a lot to be desired.  And if you take that<br/>
as a flame so be it as it was not meant that way.  Only a statement that<br/>
certain language I feel is not appropriate on this list.<br/>

&gt; THat was meant as a warning that its unlikely he&#39;ll like the Karana<br/>
&gt; server not a flame. I never flame and frankly piss on you who do.<br/>
