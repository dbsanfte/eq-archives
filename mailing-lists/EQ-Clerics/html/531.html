<b>Subject:</b> Re: EQ - worse rpg ever? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1004171667">Well, I happen to agree...and the idea I wish could come into fruition,<br/>
but I am sure is an impossibility. Is to have a strict RP server (hell,<br/>
people could privatelly lease it from Verant or something) and then have<br/>
actual applications for approval on who can play on it. Then, have<br/>
volunteers (like the guides) who actually do more than just answer<br/>
technical questions, they actually monitor RPing. Of course, people could<br/>
lie on their applications or just make up historical backgrounds of their<br/>
characters and then not hold to them or get their Mom to write the essay<br/>
for them, but those people would hopefully get caught by their peers or by<br/>
the Guides. <br/>
<br/>
Of course, everyone would have to agree to a disclaimer when they sign up<br/>
for this server, but hell we agree to some jargon I never read every time<br/>
we logon. So, that would take care of whiny 12 year olds who might get mad<br/>
if they get caught not RPing while they lied on their application to get<br/>
in, and we would not get sued, heh.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, that is my dream server and who knows perhaps with enough support<br/>
a bunch of die-hard RP&#39;ers could pull it off. I would easily pay an extra<br/>
fee per month to have a server privately leased to a group of awesome,<br/>
RolePlaying people, making it one of the most sought after servers to play<br/>
on.<br/>
<br/>
Ooh, was trying to draw to a close and ended up with a whole &#39;nother<br/>
paragraph, sorry.<br/>

Khraagas (Bristlebane - had to make a troll, because the saddest thing<br/>
ever is that the only RP I can get out of EQ is Trolls and Ogres talking<br/>
stupid - AND that is sad.)<br/>
