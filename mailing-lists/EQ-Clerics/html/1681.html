<div id="ygrps-yiv-690196520">I don&#39;t know if anyone has written about this yet, but<br/>
these are the new changes that they are planning on<br/>
implementing soon.  I got this info off two separate<br/>
sites.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;snip&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Zones<br/>
<br/>
Three new areas, tentatively titled, Temple of Solusek<br/>
Ro, The Hole and Paineel, will be accessable via the<br/>
Toxxullia Forest on Erudin. The zones will be free of<br/>
charge and available via an optional patch. More<br/>
information regarding these new zones will be made<br/>
available as their release date nears.<br/>
<br/>
- The Temple of Solusek Ro should be on-line and<br/>
available to our customers, free of charge, by<br/>
mid-October. A release date for The Hole and Paineel<br/>
has not been set.<br/>
<br/>

General Issues<br/>
<br/>
Though a majority of the EverQuest development team&#39;s<br/>
time has been dedicated to the enhancement of current<br/>
game play related features, such as dungeon and class<br/>
tuning and balancing, item/weapon implementation, and<br/>
spell functionality, we have been able to work on the<br/>
following.<br/>
<br/>
- We are working to make it possible for players to<br/>
manually organize spells within their spell book.<br/>
- Level 35+ characters meditating automatically when<br/>
they sit down - without the spell book being brought<br/>
up.<br/>
- When a player or NPC speaks in a langauge other than<br/>
&quot;Common Tongue&quot;, denoting the langauge being spoken<br/>
(if their skill in that langauge is high enough)<br/>
proceeding the text.<br/>
- The ability for the user to manually adjust their<br/>
clipping plane (the point at which the 3D geometry is<br/>
drawn in) on the fly via an in-game slider bar to not<br/>
only enhance performance, but to also allow the<br/>
clipping plane to be moved out much further than it is<br/>
currently set to.<br/>
- Approximately 20+ new character animations to be<br/>
mated with the /text socials which were recently added<br/>
last week.<br/>
- Allowing the ability for guilds to be at war with<br/>
multiple guilds.<br/>
- Functionality is being added to allow Enchanters to<br/>
enchant items.<br/>
- The ability to send messages to everyone in a<br/>
players Friend&#39;s List whom are currently on-line.<br/>
- Adding the option for players to not allow looting<br/>
before a guild war is initiated.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;/snip&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Although these are somewhat frivilous changes, I can<br/>
see how it can make a few things more fun.  I, for<br/>
one, am very excited about the new med changes for<br/>
level 35+, especially since I will be at that level by<br/>
the time the change is implemented! (i&#39;m also looking<br/>
forward to the animations that will accompany the new<br/>
emotes, but we wont even go into that now )<br/>
