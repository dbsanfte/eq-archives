<b>Subject:</b> Clerics and the art of Dueling <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-880176536">Hail fellow Clerics,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I have witnessed and read about many adventurers dueling to<br/>
test their skills or to settle a dispute.  However, I have <br/>
never seen a Cleric duel nor have heard of one. <br/>
<br/>
  Since we are in charge of Saving lives, how do we tune<br/>
ourselves to Take a life? Clerics are far from being cowards,<br/>
but to decline a duel or be somewhat at a loss durring a<br/>
potential guild war, can bring shame upon the class.  <br/>
<br/>
  So I ask, are there any dueling clerics out there that can<br/>
lend their experiences to a beginning duelest?  I am a level<br/>
19 cleric but I wish to open the discussion to all levels. <br/>
Tips for fighting hybrids, magic using classes, and especially<br/>
adventureres that are of lvls higher than yourself.  <br/>
