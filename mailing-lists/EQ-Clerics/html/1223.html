&gt; Well, my final word on the begging issue is that you can choose to ignore,<br/>
&gt; but as an RP-ing strategy, I beleive it is perfectly valid. And ignoring and<br/>
&gt; beig rude is a perfectly valid response, in terms of RPing.<br/>

&gt; I didn&#39;t want this to turn into an ethical debate.  Hell, its only a game.<br/>

I tend to turn the snubbing of beggars into a role-playing gimmick<br/>
myself; my cleric launches into a speech (macro&#39;d, at this point) about<br/>
how The Mother of All loves her children, and gives each the<br/>
opportunities and chances to earn their success through their own<br/>
abilities blahblahblah.  Basically ending up saying &quot;Tunare helps those<br/>
who can help themselves.  Here&#39;s a couple of buffs, here&#39;s a tarnished<br/>
dagger - go get &#39;em, tiger.&quot; <br/>
