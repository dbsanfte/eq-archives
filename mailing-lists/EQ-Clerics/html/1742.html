<div id="ygrps-yiv-152697831">when you are charmed, you personally cannot control your spells and<br/>
skills....but the thing that charmed you can....they have control of you<br/>
and generally seem to use you(the charmee) as offensively as possible.  I&#39;m<br/>
not sure about the cancel magic thing...it should work.  Maybe sometimes it<br/>
take 2 cancels to fully remove the affect.  <br/>

&gt;I have spent the last two days fighting evil eyes in<br/>
&gt;the gorge. However, there are still a couple things<br/>
&gt;that puzzle me. I was really hoping someone could<br/>
&gt;enlighten me. :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1) Charm, does cancel magic work on it or not? I have<br/>
&gt;tried casting several times with mied results.<br/>
&gt;Sometimes it seems to cancel it sometimes it does not.<br/>
&gt;All of my party members had only endure magic on, so<br/>
&gt;the second dispell should have theoretically worked,<br/>
&gt;but sometimes it did not. What gives?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;2) When charmed, I thought you could not use your<br/>
&gt;skills/spells. This seemed to be the case until late<br/>
&gt;last night when a 28th cater was charmed and then<br/>
&gt;proceeded to kill me in three casts. I also lost about<br/>
&gt;a half a bubble of exp from this PC death. I later<br/>
&gt;asked the caster and she said that she was killed me<br/>
&gt;by a spell that was memorized in the 6th slot, not the<br/>
&gt;8th slot like some peeple think. Her 8th slot was a<br/>
&gt;gate. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So, what gives?? I think correct information would<br/>
&gt;come in handy in later levels. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks!!!<br/>
