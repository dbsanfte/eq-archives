<div id="ygrps-yiv-1587752863">I have been following this thread with considerable interest.  I am running<br/>
a high elf cleric on Erollisi Marr who is currently nine.  My problem is<br/>
that is hard to get into a group since a lot still want to solo at this age<br/>
level and the groups that do offer want to either go to Crushbone or like<br/>
today to the Chessboard.   When I have grouped I try to aid in melee and<br/>
still watch the health of the party members.  I do not use Furor at all in<br/>
combat saving my mana for healing and buffing only.  I have also had a group<br/>
not give me a chance to med back to even 50% before starting to fight again.<br/>
Another problem of course is that once I begin to heal the mob starts<br/>
beating on me and they cannot pull it off.  I try not to fight back when<br/>
this happens to give them a chance to get it off me though.<br/>
<br/>
I did manage to purchase a couple of 2 wisdom rings today for a total of<br/>
2pp.  These are the first stat enhancing items I have gotten.  As usual I am<br/>
almost completely broke now after buying my ninth level spells and the<br/>
rings.   I am still wearing a mixture of leather, PW and cloth armor and<br/>
using a cracked staff in combat.<br/>
<br/>
I am open to any and all suggestions that you elders my wish to impart upon<br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>
Yilari<br/>

&gt; Yes, Anne, I agree that first and foremost we are and should be healers.<br/>
