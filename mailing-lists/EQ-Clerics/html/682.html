<div id="ygrps-yiv-2063083650">I fully agree with you.  There has got to be a way to control the<br/>
servers but without the caps.  And if they do cap it, I think people<br/>
should have the option to be allowed to permanently move their<br/>
character to a less populated server.  But, it should be OPTIONAL to<br/>
move.  A forced move is just not fair.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with your statements about the realm.  I am an ex realmie.  I<br/>
remember before EQ even went into beta.  The Realm put a server cap on<br/>
it.  I would wait for over an hour just trying to get in, or wait in<br/>
line trying to get in.  Then, I would have to wait even longer for my<br/>
friends to be able to log in.  It was horrible and I was extremely<br/>
upset about it.  The realm lacked updates, and just before I left, it<br/>
lacked a staff period!  We were on our own.  Hackers got control and<br/>
the servers would be down for days.  I dont think this is gonna happen<br/>
in EQ though, they seem to be competent.  It&#39;s a well publicized game<br/>
also, unlike The Realm.  The realm was only available by mail order<br/>
through sierra&#39;s catalog.<br/>
<br/>
In any case, a cap would have it&#39;s advantages, it would also have alot<br/>
of drawbacks.<br/>

&gt; A cap might be nice but put it to low and you&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; have a lot off ticked off<br/>
&gt; people cause they can&#39;t get onto their server.  If<br/>
&gt; that starts to happen we<br/>
&gt; might see a lot of ppl quiting the game, ya I know<br/>
&gt; less ppl playing means<br/>
&gt; more places to hunt without fighting over who gets<br/>
&gt; what kill and less lag.<br/>
&gt; But thing about that less ppl playing (less money<br/>
&gt; for Verant) less money for<br/>
&gt; them could mean the end of EverQuest, I mean look at<br/>
&gt; other games such as the<br/>
&gt; Realm.  The Realm at first was a big game, but over<br/>
&gt; time ppl got tired of it<br/>
&gt; and they quit playing where is the Realm now?  It<br/>
&gt; might still be there but<br/>
&gt; how often is it updated, how many ppl are on there<br/>
&gt; now to play with or<br/>
&gt; against?  I like EQ about as much as the next<br/>
&gt; person, but I have a feeling<br/>
&gt; we won&#39;t see it around or as big as it is now for<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d say 2-3 more years,<br/>
&gt; with games such as Middle-Earth, Asherions Call and<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve heard of one more<br/>
&gt; coming out.  If these 3 games hit it big a lot of<br/>
&gt; ppl with switch from EQ to<br/>
&gt; them, if they switch these 3 games to put an end to<br/>
&gt; EQ.<br/>
