<div id="ygrps-yiv-1020185868">I hunted skeletons solo through level 10.  After level 10, I hunted in<br/>
Lavastorm in groups, fire drakes were really good experience and have pretty<br/>
decent loot for your level - gems and coins and such.  Also, Befallen might<br/>
be a good place to start heading - with a group.  I never solo hunted after<br/>
level 10 - just not enough DD power.  Might depend a little on your race<br/>
though how far you are willing to travel without being able to bind<br/>
yourself..<br/>
<br/>
Lavastorm and Befallen were close walks for me, being a dark elf :) and good<br/>
experience in both for levels 10+<br/>
