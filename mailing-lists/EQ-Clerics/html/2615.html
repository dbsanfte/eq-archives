<b>Subject:</b> xp at 24? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-850814352">I&#39;m trying to figure out where to get xp at 24th level.  I really like<br/>
Upper Guk, but there is kind of a hole at 24th level in Upper Guk.  My<br/>
friends all want to do Cazic Thule, but I find it so incredibly<br/>
boring.  I was thinking Unrest, but I have so many bad memories of<br/>
such bad trains there.  Seems like Runnyeye might be good, but not too<br/>
familiar with it.  Not sure what levels of creatures are there.  Then<br/>
there is Borxx who could probably kick our ass.<br/>
  Friend of mine suggested East Karana might be a good place to solo.<br/>
Said I could solo evil eyes there.  And as risky/exciting as that<br/>
sounds, I don&#39;t think I could continue to get xp there until 29th.<br/>
  Paw and Mistmoore are still too high/tough.  I heard Sol A might be<br/>
good, but I&#39;ve never been to Lavastorm, and worry about falling into<br/>
lava as I&#39;ve heard you&#39;re oft to do when zoning into the place.  Maybe<br/>
dark elf guards in Nektulos?  What level are griffons?  What level are<br/>
the giant skels in Rathe mountains?  Maybe pickclaws in highkeep?<br/>
<br/>
Anyone have any recommendations for either a group of low 20s, or for<br/>
me to solo at 24?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,<br/>
