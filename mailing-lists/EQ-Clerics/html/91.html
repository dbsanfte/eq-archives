<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1539116972"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I am a cleric and I wear a squad ring and as far as I know the only way<br/>
&gt; you can charge the ring is back in Rivervale and that&#39;s if you faction<br/>
&gt; is still good with them.  I&#39;ve had it for a while and I have never<br/>
&gt; found a way to charge it anyway.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>First you have to go to the cleric guild in rivervale<br/>
and then give the ring to the first cleric in front of you (the right one<br/>
because you have 4 cleric stand in front)<br/>
then you got it<br/>
