<div id="ygrps-yiv-675656478">I have seen messages everywhere from people looking for good Cleric sites.<br/>
I run a Cleric on Fennin Ro and have been looking for the same thing.<br/>
<br/>
I am tired of looking....<br/>
<br/>
To anyone who is interested. I am going to try and make a Clerics website<br/>
for EQ.  Please send me all the info you can about Clerics, Cleric quests,<br/>
where to hunt at what levels, items, anything.  I am also looking for<br/>
suggestions on what you would like to see in a web-site for Clerics.<br/>
<br/>
Please send all info to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:david.burger@...">david.burger@...</a><br/>
<br/>
I will post the URL after I have something worth while up.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

  Subject: [EQ-Clerics] Cleric Web Pages<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I recently started a Clerical character after having played the warrior<br/>
class for some time and have enjoyed it.  I&#39;ve been noticing web pages<br/>
dedicated specifically to other classes, i.e. shamans, enchanters, druids,<br/>
but have not found any for Clerics.  Anyone know of any good websites out<br/>
there dedicated specifically to the Clerical class?<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks if advance.<br/>
