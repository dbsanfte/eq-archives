 </span></blockquote>Well I&#39;m currently over in Unrest at the moment and have been for the<br/>
last week or so..  I got a teleport over to Greater Faydark to get<br/>
there..  I&#39;m not well liked at either dock so ship travel really isn&#39;t<br/>
for me..<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve not had that much trouble there so far.. yes every good NPC there<br/>
will attack you but if you stick to the zone edges and get a good map<br/>
you can normally get around okay.  I have Jboots which have saved my<br/>
life a number of times over the last week though.  One hint I would<br/>
say.. is if it&#39;s raining and you need to cross a zone on Faydwer.. just<br/>
climb a mountain and sit and med for a bit.. wait for the rain to go..<br/>
since the clipping plane patch rain has become deadly when travelling<br/>
hostile regions..  Yesterday I tried to cross Butchersblock and I<br/>
managed to pick up a female dwarf from somewhere.. I didn&#39;t see any<br/>
buildings that I went too close to.. I didn&#39;t see her at all until she<br/>
hit me..  Jboots saved me again.. but in the rush to zone I picked up<br/>
another 2 dwarves as I passed too close to their buildi ng..  (I reckon<br/>
the aggro zones on them are wider than the visible distance you can see<br/>
(when raining) which if true is very nasty)<br/>
<br/>
So apart from slightly difficult travel what else.. hmm.. trading.. Now<br/>
I can sell to a druid at the druid circle in Butchersblock which is<br/>
ideal for dumping off your FS weapons from unrest..  however I haven&#39;t<br/>
found anyone to buy food from.. but we&#39;re clerics so we can summon that<br/>
if necessary..<br/>
<br/>
Banking.. can&#39;t do this anywhere that I&#39;ve found..  Very annoying..<br/>
<br/>
Trading.. Trading is slightly harder in that you have to convince the<br/>
person you are buying from/selling to to come to you always.. since they<br/>
normally want to meet in the city of the zone your in.. or somewhere<br/>
equally as dangerous for you to get to..<br/>
<br/>
Anyway that&#39;s about all I have to sayabout Faydwer..  It&#39;s okay.. it has<br/>
some nice zones.. Unrest, Mistmoore, Kedge Keep.. but it&#39;s just not<br/>
home.. and the lack of banking is very annoying.. so unless you like to<br/>
travel a lot or have a Wiz/Druid on call to TP you back expect it to<br/>
feel like a camping trip.. and my will you really appreciate home much<br/>
more when you get back..  <br/>
<br/>
Oh well.. nearly high enough to hit Sol B.. :)<br/>
