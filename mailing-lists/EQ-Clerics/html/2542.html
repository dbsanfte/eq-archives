<div id="ygrps-yiv-600254735"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;those to Druids for a tidy profit.  Spider silk is sought out by<br/>
&gt;wizards, too, and you can sell bat wings as well.  These are all some<br/>
&gt;ideas.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why do wizards want spider silk in particular? My bard COVETS silk because<br/>
she is a tailor and it is a BIG pain to get it yourself. Everytime I find it<br/>
in the merchants, I buy it. Those are my best tailoring pieces. If someone<br/>
was auctioning selling spider silk, I&#39;d snap it up. (I don&#39;t auction buyig<br/>
because I&#39;ve found people don&#39;t respond to that very well)<br/>
<br/>
I find bone chips and bat wings are the easiest things to sell. The only<br/>
place fish scales are really desired enough to pay premium prices is up near<br/>
Kedge Keep. My druid carries a stack of 20 around and has never used any in<br/>
5 levels.</div>
