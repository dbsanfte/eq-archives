<div id="ygrps-yiv-265651566">What 1 point of mana converts too depends on the level.<br/>
The formula for mana calculation is as follows<br/>
((wis/5) +2) * level<br/>
<br/>
So if you at level 20, have 150 wisdom your mana would be<br/>
<br/>
(150/5)  = 30<br/>
( 30+2)  = 32<br/>
(32*20)  = 640<br/>
<br/>
You could take this further and determine what a +5 wisdom item would be<br/>
(155/5)  = 31<br/>
( 31+2)  = 33<br/>
(33*20)  = 660<br/>
<br/>
So a +5 wisdom item added to your inventory would give you 20 more mana.<br/>
It doesnt seem like much but trust me, it does add up, esp at higher<br/>
levels.<br/>
<br/>
That same +5 wisdom item at level 40 would give you 40 more mana<br/>
and at level 50, 50 more mana.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(I typed this up real quick so if my math is wrong please correct me :) ).<br/>

&gt; What?! Are there only evil clerics here?  BTW I find that contradicting.<br/>
&gt; Evil + Cleric just seems a bit ironic.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For those clerics who are not fill with hate, yes, I do believe since we are<br/>
&gt; gifted with the ability to heal we should do all we can to sustain life over<br/>
&gt; death.  However, you should manage your manna wisely.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Another subject:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Can anyone tell me how many manna 1 pt of WIS converts to?<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I can only concur.  As a child of Hate, my only duty is to tend to<br/>
&gt; &gt; Innoruuk&#39;s followers to ensure his greater glory.  All others are merely<br/>
&gt; &gt; fuel to feed his fires, like kindling.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m new to this mail list, and thought I would introduce<br/>
&gt; &gt; myself with a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;topic<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to discuss.  I&#39;ve often wondered what exactly it means to be<br/>
&gt; &gt; a cleric in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Norrath.  My personal opinion is that we should always be merciful to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;those<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; around us, and help in any way we can.  Even if to heal<br/>
&gt; &gt; someone we don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;even<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; know completely depletes our mana.  What do you think of this?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Perhaps that is what Karana asks of you.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;But Innoruk is the God of Hate and Pain. Pain is real. You can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;avoid it. of all the gods, he is the only one honest with his followers.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;He WANTS us killing everything. So why should I use the powers he gives<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;me on those who do not followhim, and will actively work against him?<br/>
