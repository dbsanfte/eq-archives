<div id="ygrps-yiv-63388318">That&#39;s not what I meant, Jeff. I meant that Holy Armor stacks with<br/>
Center. Of course it doesn&#39;t stack with its lower level equivalent.<br/>
Sorry if I misread your earlier post. :)<br/>

Umm.. no they don&#39;t.. lol.   I mean 2 of your buffs stack, but not all<br/>
of them.  Holy Armor stacks with Courage, but it doesn&#39;t stack with<br/>
Spirit Armor, just as courage won&#39;t stack with center.<br/>
<br/>
There are 2 lines of buffs... one is AC and the other is HP/AC.   You<br/>
can have one spell from each line casted effectively.   If somebody has<br/>
center on and you try to cast Courage, it will say &quot;your spell did not<br/>
take hold&quot;.  If they have Courage and you cast Center it will cancel<br/>
courage and give them center.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;My buffs are not that great yet at 10 as I only have center and the<br/>
&gt; first level spell to use.   I do not think that holy armor and center<br/>
&gt; can be stacked.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; OMG, Walt, are you being serious? Have you tried stacking Holy Armor and<br/>
&gt; Center? Haven&#39;t you been buffing yourself or others? Of course they<br/>
&gt; stack, my friend. All your buffs stack, one right on top of the other.<br/>
&gt; Eventually, you&#39;ll have a stack of four beautiful yellow shields that<br/>
&gt; will make you a power to be dealt with. Last night a cleric gave me<br/>
&gt; Bravery, Guard, Rune 1, and the level 2 Symbol. At level 19, I had 974<br/>
&gt; hp. And my AC was 473. Unfortunately, he was too high level (33) to be<br/>
&gt; in our group. Sighhh.....<br/>

&gt; I can not speak for all young clerics only for my own.  When I am in a<br/>
&gt; group<br/>
&gt; I will watch the health bars of all the others and break off from melee<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; heal.  Most of the time when I am in a group and heal, the mob will<br/>
&gt; start in<br/>
&gt; on me though.  I of course have taken off my auto-attack and changed<br/>
&gt; target.<br/>
&gt; Most of the time I have even backed off away from the critter.   I take<br/>
&gt; my<br/>
&gt; role as the medic in my group very seriously.  My buffs are not that<br/>
&gt; great<br/>
&gt; yet at 10 as I only have center and the first level spell to use.   I do<br/>
&gt; not<br/>
&gt; think that holy armor and center can be stacked.  As I have stated many<br/>
&gt; times here before though my problem is finding a group to start with.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I also will not use smite that often in melee unless I am alone since I<br/>
&gt; do<br/>
&gt; prefer to save my mana for healing and buffing.  Those two buffs alone<br/>
&gt; take<br/>
&gt; me about two bars of mana.   I have around a 105 or 110 wisdom and two<br/>
&gt; wisdom rings of +2.   I know I need more items but they are expensive<br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; sure and I, like most my age, am pretty broke.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I really do not see why the others fail to do their duty.  I often play<br/>
&gt; melee classes and have clerics and druids heal me when I am resting all<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; time.<br/>
