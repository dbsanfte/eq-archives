<div id="ygrps-yiv-134592070">Last night (or this morning, depends on how you look at 12am), I was in<br/>
Unrest was a group of 5 for a while.  I did a / which will tell ya who&#39;s in<br/>
the zone and it said there were only 55 people in Unrest.  Yes 55 people but<br/>
still laggy as crap in there.  I got attacked by a Werebat and some kinda<br/>
skel maybe a monk can&#39;t remember but I could not see them at all, thats<br/>
happened to me in Steamfont with Minos.  It&#39;ll say you are hit by a Mino for<br/>
whatever but you can&#39;t see them.  But anyways I take off from the Werebat<br/>
and Skel just to be killed by a Hag.  But running even with SoW on ya in<br/>
Unrest can be a pain cause of the lag.  At times it wasn&#39;t bad at all but<br/>
other times WOW lag slowed ya down a lot.<br/>
Also looted a corpse someone left in Unrest to find a Small Bronze Collar.<br/>
Heard it was worth maybe 10-12pp but sell it to a store and they only wanna<br/>
give ya 8gp, yeah right like I&#39;d take 8gp for a Bronze Collar.<br/>

&gt; I know, I know, Rodcet Nife isn&#39;t as crowded as<br/>
&gt; many of the other servers, but it can still be<br/>
&gt; crowded.  I suggest searching for new areas.  I<br/>
&gt; have found a zone that has never had more than 25<br/>
&gt; people in it since I have been there.  Exp. is<br/>
&gt; great and I am making about 60pp a day in loot.<br/>
&gt; Did I mention that I now have full bronze from<br/>
&gt; this same zone?  I am not a level 49 player<br/>
&gt; either.  I made 18 last night and I already have<br/>
&gt; two bubbles of exp. toward 19.  I have all the lvl<br/>
&gt; 19 spells bought, an incredible amount of jewelry,<br/>
&gt; and over 500pp in the bank.  Once again I implore<br/>
&gt; you to travel and to form 6 member groups.  If you<br/>
&gt; hear about a great place then every one else has<br/>
&gt; also.  Find your own area.  There are many that<br/>
&gt; are hardly ever visited and you&#39;ll have your<br/>
&gt; cloice on what, when, and where to kill.<br/>
