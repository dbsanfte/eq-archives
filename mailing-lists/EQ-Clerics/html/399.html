&gt;<br/>
&gt; Today on EQVault they posted a message from a guy named Billy and Brad<br/>
&gt; himself.  It goes like this<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Billy: A friend and I were talking about this, and it _seemed_ like a<br/>
 </span></blockquote>good<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; idea: have you guys ever considered letting players build their own house<br/>
 </span></blockquote>in<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Everquest, similar to UO? The only limiting factor to me seems like the<br/>
&gt; actual size of the world, might be a tad cramped...<br/>
&gt; Brad&#39;s response: Our plans, which are long term mind you, involve<br/>
&gt; &#39;rentables&#39; first, and then perhaps housing later. But I&#39;m definitely not<br/>
 </span></blockquote>at<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; a point where I&#39;ll commit to either doing it, nor to a time frame :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Billy: Also, with Everquest(1), do you plan on making any improvements to<br/>
&gt; the graphics engine at all, or is basically what we currently see, all<br/>
 </span></blockquote>that<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; there is going to be (I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s a bad thing, the visuals in<br/>
&gt; Everquest look great...just wondering as time goes on).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Brad: Absolutely -- EverQuest does not fully tap the potential of its<br/>
&gt; engine, and I think people will be pleasantly surprised as to how many<br/>
&gt; improvements visually we will make with upcoming zones and the Expansion<br/>
&gt; next year. You&#39;ll see more polygons, larger textures, more distant<br/>
 </span></blockquote>clipping<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; planes, more animation, and more things animated. And we&#39;re excited about<br/>
&gt; this, because a lot of the technology we put into the engine as finished<br/>
&gt; towards the end of the EverQuest development cycle and I don&#39;t think we<br/>
 </span></blockquote>were<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; able to totally exploit their potential -- now we can :)&quot;<br/>
