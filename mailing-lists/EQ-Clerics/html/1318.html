<div id="ygrps-yiv-742576099">Unfortunately this whole rule has been brought in for the K/S ers not people<br/>
like yourself that would probably be ammeniable to a bit of sharing and arnt<br/>
there to farm/harvest items which has been very widespread. It is sweeping<br/>
and unfair to people like yourself but was inevitable. You would be able to<br/>
trade/buy it but that isnt what you want I realise. Hopefully they will get<br/>
PoF and a few high level zones open soon to appease your lust and this<br/>
confrontation with a GM won&#39;t happen. From what I hear you wont be alone in<br/>
your furor though.<br/>
<br/>
Really though this K/s thing is again the many good gamers like I am sure<br/>
you are being penalised because of the selfishness of the trivial few -<br/>
however the trivial few made gaming a misery for the many low level<br/>
characters that were powerless to do anything about &#39;the fews&#39; actions in<br/>
game.<br/>
<br/>
First come first served is getting out of the rotation thing. yes you should<br/>
get your shot but then should maybe another groups turn. You cant say &#39;we<br/>
got here first so shove off&#39; - well you can of course but isnt very nice -<br/>
but then neither is what you are being told to do now in its way.<br/>
<br/>
My 2 pence worth is is tough on the high levelers but needed because of the<br/>
actions of the few making it a misery for many...<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ll tell you what my whole opinion is on this camping/yield issue.  I<br/>
think<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; first group there stays there, regardless of their level.  And noone is<br/>
able<br/>
&gt; to throw<br/>
&gt; another group out if that group was there first.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have wanted a nightshade wreath and gem sceptre for ages.  So today,<br/>
&gt; myself and 5 other level 50s went to camp MM castle.  Everything there was<br/>
&gt; green to us, but myself and a level 50 shaman friend wanted wreaths and<br/>
&gt; sceptres, which we didn&#39;t have.  Under Brad&#39;s rule, if a group of<br/>
&gt; level 35+ comes, and they can get exp for that area, then we have to yield<br/>
&gt; and give up a spot we have been at for hours. Tell me where the fairness<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; THAT<br/>
&gt; rule is.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Since there are very few places I can get exp anymore and have maxxed<br/>
&gt; out level 50, I am going around and getting items I don&#39;t have because I<br/>
was<br/>
&gt; focusing on exp and helping others level as well.  I plan to do the Paw of<br/>
&gt; Opallo quest next.  Mitty is green to me, as is Gynok Moltar.  Should I<br/>
have<br/>
&gt; to leave camping them just because lower levels come to camp for the same<br/>
&gt; items I<br/>
&gt; want?  I think that is totally unfair. Just because I am level 50 doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; mean I&quot;m not<br/>
&gt; entitled to get items I don&#39;t have just because the mobs don&#39;t give me exp<br/>
&gt; anymore.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Again, my opinion is....first there stays there.  Then when they leave,<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; next group in line gets the camp spot.  I don&#39;t think levels should have<br/>
&gt; anything to do with who gets the camp spot.  I don&#39;t think high levels<br/>
&gt; should force lower levels away from a camp spot, and I don&#39;t think lower<br/>
&gt; levels should be able to force higher levels away if they were there<br/>
first.<br/>
&gt; To do it any other way discriminates against one group over another<br/>
(higher<br/>
&gt; vs. lower).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And I&#39;ll tell you this....if a GM tells me to leave a camp spot I have<br/>
been<br/>
&gt; at<br/>
&gt; for hours for an item I don&#39;t have that I want just because some lower<br/>
&gt; levels  arrived and want my spot, then I won&#39;t be playing EQ for very<br/>
&gt; much longer.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The only fair way IMO is first there stays there, regardless of level,<br/>
then<br/>
&gt; whomever was next gets it next, and so on and so on.  Get in line and take<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; number.  No one group of players should be favored over another.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; To do it Brad&#39;s way, would mean that any player that didn&#39;t get an item<br/>
&gt; while he/she was<br/>
&gt; able to get exp from that particular mob could basically never get that<br/>
item<br/>
&gt; cause they could be<br/>
&gt; thrown out of the camp spot everytime lower levels came along.  This is<br/>
&gt; totally not fair.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt;What does everyone think of this Yield Policy?  In case you never heard<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; &gt;it, it Brads new way of getting rid of high lvl characters camping lower<br/>
&gt; lvl<br/>
&gt; &gt;spawn points.<br/>
&gt; &gt;This is what he said but it<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;If a higher level player who would get no exp for the kill is camping a<br/>
&gt; &gt;spawn, and a group of players that would get exp (meaning they should be<br/>
&gt; &gt;there) wants to fight there, the higher level player must yield. The<br/>
lower<br/>
&gt; &gt;level group has the right of way.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;As for the other disciplinary information in that post, it sounds like<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt;same policy that&#39;s always been in place: if you are warned several times<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt;continue to break the rules, you will be banned.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Do you all think this will work or just tick off a lot of players?  I&#39;m<br/>
not<br/>
&gt; &gt;sure if I&#39;m for it or not, but also remember if your a camper doing this<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt;you&#39;re warned a few times you&#39;ll be banned from the game.  I don&#39;t really<br/>
&gt; &gt;camp, I do in a few spots but not a lot but only in places that give me<br/>
&gt; exp.<br/>
&gt; &gt;He said it wouldn&#39;t be actively enforced till it was officially<br/>
announced.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Some ppl are wanting us to be able to vote yes or no on it but as of now<br/>
&gt; &gt;Brad isn&#39;t letting us vote<br/>
