<div id="ygrps-yiv-449270968">Well put.  And not only weapon skills, but weapons: even the best 1H and 2H<br/>
blunts in all of Norrath cannot compare with even so lowly a weapon as the<br/>
BBC, which even a melee class in his mid teens should be able to afford. And<br/>
there is much better stuff than the BBC out there. And finally, we never get<br/>
dual wield or double attack, which puts us far, far back in the amount of<br/>
damage we inflict compared to melee classes.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m level 27 now, and I have been thinking about this a lot lately. Although<br/>
I love to melee, and love to see that mace mangling the mob&#39;s flesh and<br/>
splintering its bones, and watch its HP bar ebb away... I have to agree with<br/>
the groups I&#39;ve been with who urge me to just sit and med through battle,<br/>
and &#39;wake up&#39; only to cast a heal. By the time I&#39;m level 40, I expect to be<br/>
meleeing not at all. What&#39;s the point? I&#39;ll be doing maybe a sixth or an<br/>
eighth of the damage of the tanks, putting myself at risk of having my<br/>
spells interrupted, and not medding up the mana that my tanks desperately<br/>
need.<br/>
<br/>
Nope. There is no melee in my future, I suspect. Or at most, only enough to<br/>
max out my Defense skill, so as to keep my AC maxed. After that, I&#39;ll be<br/>
staring at the spellbook.<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s at least petition Verant to make the *&^%$# spellbook transparent, so<br/>
we can enjoy the battle during med! ^_^<br/>

&gt;The equipment is irrelevant since our Weapon skill lags so far behind.<br/>
&gt;Regardless of the equipment you use, a high level cleric will miss quite<br/>
&gt;often.  It is pretty pointless to try and develop a &quot;fighter/healer&quot; type,<br/>
&gt;because around level 25 it stops working and only gets worse with levels.<br/>

&gt;&gt; I have the opportunity to buy items off Ebay that would give me<br/>
&gt;&gt; outstanding stats as far as strength, agility and dexterity go. I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;&gt; talking 115 str, 130 dex and 125 agi (and 85 sta), all wearable at the<br/>
&gt;&gt; same time. However, my wisdom would be only 105.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; On the other hand, I also have the opportunity to buy wisdom items that<br/>
&gt;&gt; would increase my wisdom by 35 points (to about 136). Which path should<br/>
&gt;&gt; I follow? Some people argue that high level clerics CAN melee, while<br/>
&gt;&gt; others argue that at high levels, clerics should concentrate on their<br/>
&gt;&gt; healing and buffing skills. &quot;After all, if you wanted to be a warrior,<br/>
&gt;&gt; you should have been one.&quot; Yeah, yeah, heard that, been there. With the<br/>
&gt;&gt; right equipment, though (Jboots, a flowing black sash of haste, an<br/>
&gt;&gt; observer&#39;s staff, etc.), a cleric should be able to hold his or her own<br/>
&gt;&gt; in combat, even after level 35.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Any suggestions, comments, advice before I commit to one group of items<br/>
&gt;&gt; or the other?<br/>
