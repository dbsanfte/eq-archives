<div id="ygrps-yiv-512534467">Well, as far as I am concerned, what you heard is true<br/>
for the most part.<br/>
<br/>
I am a 32 cleric on Rodcet Nife.  When I was young, I<br/>
did alot of tanking for my group.  I was able to back<br/>
off and heal them as needed.  As I started to gain<br/>
levels, I found it more and more important to find a<br/>
quiet corner and keep healing and medding.<br/>
<br/>
Right now we are in Solusek B (nagafens lair).  The<br/>
greater kobolds hit for 50+.  They not only hit hard,<br/>
they hit fast.  I have to constantly heal my main<br/>
tanks and stay as far out of the melee area as<br/>
possible.  First of all, your health will not be able<br/>
to afford to be beat on.  Secondly, since higher level<br/>
mobs tend to hit hard and fast, your heals will get<br/>
interrrupted much more often.  You will find that your<br/>
heals are a very very effective taunt (not that we<br/>
want them to be!!).  Your best bet would be to stay as<br/>
far away as the mob as possible.<br/>
<br/>
I am the only cleric in our group.  I find myself<br/>
buffing, medding, finishing the buffing, medding,<br/>
standing up to heal (mebbe a whack or two on a critter<br/>
if all is going well), medding, healing (take some<br/>
serious abuse from a mob that went aggro on me),<br/>
medding, buffing, wash, rinse, repeat.  This is the<br/>
story of my life.  Some may find it boring.  I don&#39;t. <br/>
I take pride in knowing what to do and when to do it. <br/>
I take pride in being the one to keep this group<br/>
alive.  I take pride in being able to save my members<br/>
from a long run through a dangerous zone after they<br/>
(heaven forbid) have died.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I guess what I am saying is yes, you will heal and med<br/>
throughout battles.  No, you will not be an effective<br/>
tank, and if you try to tank you will really endanger<br/>
your group.  No, you will not do good with melee.  And<br/>
no, you are not a nuker!  (even though our spells seem<br/>
nice and powerful when we first get them, they are<br/>
just not mana efficient and they take forever to<br/>
recover)<br/>
<br/>
A clerics life is definitely not for everyone.  Many<br/>
people would find it boring.  Sometimes it is, but<br/>
it&#39;s all worth it.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t like the way this sounds, then quit while<br/>
you are ahead.  It&#39;s not the life for you.  You might<br/>
be better suited to be a paladin or shadow knight<br/>
(shadow knights are awesome, we have on in our group).<br/>
<br/>
As far as wisdom goes, I have 133 at this time and<br/>
that is still not enough!  Try to find some wisdom<br/>
enhancing stuff and you&#39;ll do just fine!<br/>

&gt; tells me (which I totally disagree with and the<br/>
&gt; whole subject matter makes<br/>
&gt; me sick) is that when older (25+) all we do is<br/>
&gt; heal...no melee, no DD, just<br/>
&gt; heal and med.  First...is that true or can we still<br/>
&gt; melee..I know we won&#39;t<br/>
&gt; exactly be able to solo melee...but as in a group or<br/>
&gt; possibly as the only<br/>
&gt; tank?..and while on that subject, can we solo undead<br/>
&gt; up into all our higher<br/>
&gt; lvls or do we still need help then too?  And finally<br/>
&gt; the mana issue.  I am<br/>
&gt; dwarven cleric and have a 100 in strength and 103 in<br/>
&gt; wisdom...will that be a<br/>
&gt; high enough wisdom to have proper mana to heal my<br/>
&gt; group and such?  Any other<br/>
&gt; tips would be most helpful.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; P.S.  Any good cleric websites with detailed spell<br/>
&gt; descriptions (like how<br/>
&gt; much damage our spells deal, how much HPs our<br/>
&gt; healing spells heal, and the<br/>
&gt; exact numbers on our buffs, etc)<br/>
