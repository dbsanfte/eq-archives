<div id="ygrps-yiv-152446599">Symbol of Ryltan requires bloodstone and adds about 150 HP. It&#39;s a great<br/>
spell, it saves lives. You can often get the Bloodstone in lavastorm for a<br/>
few gold each from people hunting there, but a lot of times it is more<br/>
convienient to go in to town and just buy a bunch of it. I found it much<br/>
more affordable than Symbol of Transal based on money availability at the<br/>
time.</div>
