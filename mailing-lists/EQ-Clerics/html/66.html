&gt; First Off i like to say High to all fellow Clerics. Im a 29th Cleric on<br/>
Mith<br/>
&gt; Marr server. SO far there are only 2 magical 1 handed weapons in the game<br/>
we<br/>
&gt; can use besides all the normal ones and are spells. We all know about the<br/>
&gt; screaming mace, but i would like to Add about the Enamaled Black Mace<br/>
which<br/>
&gt; i currently have, does 8 damage, 28 speed and magical. Now i can rip some<br/>
&gt; ass with this weapon. Not to mention im doing 198 damage with my new Wrath<br/>
&gt; spell which is a upgrade from Smite. Now i need to stress that you toss<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; 2H weapons and start working on 1H. At high levels you are going to need<br/>
&gt; shields for sure, the more magic resistance you have the safer you will<br/>
be.<br/>
&gt; Right now i have a mistmoor shield which gives +10 Ac +10 resistance to<br/>
&gt; Magic, Disease & poison. Believe me anyone that has been to Mistmoor knows<br/>
&gt; that you need all the magic Resistance you can get. Not to mention we get<br/>
&gt; buff spells, so currently when im fighting i have 60 resistance and seeing<br/>
&gt; you resist 3 Shock Of Force spells in a row makes you breath a little bit<br/>
&gt; better :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If anyone has any questions about spells or anything give me a shout<br/>
&gt;<br/>
