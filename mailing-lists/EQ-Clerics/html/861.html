<b>Subject:</b> NPCs controlled by GMs <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-627988281">I don&#39;t know if I have just been lucky last week or so, or if they have<br/>
a new directive for GMs to do this, but I have participated in three<br/>
separate battles against NPCs controlled by GMs on two different<br/>
servers. <br/>
<br/>
I LOVED it.<br/>
<br/>
The complete randomness that this brought to the zone was such a<br/>
welcome addition. One in particular was extremely well done. The GM<br/>
spawned a powerful giant rat in a newbie zone. The fun started once the<br/>
players realized what was going on. There were enough experienced<br/>
players starting new characters that a plan was formed rather quickly.<br/>
Several groups formed under these players and then a simulaneous attack<br/>
occured. It was a tremendous amount of fun for the &quot;new&quot; players as<br/>
well as the more experienced players. There weren&#39;t any characters<br/>
invloved that were higher then 8 I believe. The GM actually broadcast a<br/>
message congratulating all and naming several that went above and<br/>
beyond in their attempt to role play. He even rewarded me(level 5) with<br/>
a nice bracer for the way I circled the fight and healed key members of<br/>
the three groups. He said something like &quot;for showing others by example<br/>
what a cleric is supposed to be.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Now, the point of all that rambling was how much I think this adds to<br/>
the game. <br/>
<br/>
1. You have an intelligent opponent without having to be PvP.<br/>
2. Tremendous opportunity for role-play.<br/>
3. Fun for game-knowledgable as well as newbies.<br/>
4. I would much rather obtain items in this way, then pitching a tent<br/>
in Najena for 17 hours straight.<br/>
5. No EXP is lost by a death from a NPC controlled by a GM.<br/>
<br/>
I know this is not exactly cleric specific, but since the last episode<br/>
happened to a cleric and I like this list...<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts?<br/>
