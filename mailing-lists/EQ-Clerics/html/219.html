<div id="ygrps-yiv-1446627579">-- From: &quot;Squires, Dean&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:DeanSquires@...">DeanSquires@...</a>&gt;<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Just wanted to open a discussion on Clerics who love to fight.  I am<br/>
&gt;happy being a cleric, but I cannot resist jumping into the heat of a<br/>
&gt;battle and kicking some back.  I also like to occassionally tank.  I try<br/>
&gt;to save all my mana for healing, but sometimes I just love to blast<br/>
&gt;away.  This is probably because I feel useless when grouped as my<br/>
&gt;regular attack doesn&#39;t compare to others in the group.  Anyone else feel<br/>
&gt;this way?  Any experiences to share?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well i VERY rarely use Smite against any critters but i find Holy Might<br/>
quite a good offensive spell since it prevents the mob from hitting the<br/>
tanks and thus saving HP. It&#39;s only the undead that i really use my <br/>
offensive spells against, especially if there are more than one cleric<br/>
in group. If i find that there is no real danger of anyone getting killed<br/>
and that i will not need to med to heal them i go in and melee. Doesn&#39;t<br/>
it really make you feel good when you finally see the horrible werebat<br/>
in front of your group slayed down and that you had some real good blows<br/>
at it? At least i do : )<br/>
