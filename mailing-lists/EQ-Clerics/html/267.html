<div id="ygrps-yiv-1546375954"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I&#39;m a lvl 13 cleric.  Abjuration, alteration, evocation are AT LEAST at<br/>
&gt; skill lvl 60, and probably divination and conjuration are pretty high as<br/>
&gt; well.  How can that be explained?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The skils you speak of are a seperate set from the actual &#39;specialization&#39;<br/>
skills.  In other words if you look at your skill list you would see<br/>
Abjuration as a skill as well as a skill named Specialize Abjuration.<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; I haven&#39;t noticed any better casting ability in any of my spells.  How can<br/>
&gt; that be explained?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>You arent specialized yet.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If I HAVE specialized, how can I tell which one it is?(they went over 50<br/>
&gt; about 3 weeks ago...I don&#39;t have a clue which was first).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>See above.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If I HAVEN&#39;T specialized, how do I do it?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You have to be level 30.  Once you reach level 30 go to a cleric guild<br/>
find an NPC who can train you and look for the boxes labeled<br/>
specialization.     There should be one specialization box for each type<br/>
of skill. <br/>
It doesnt say which casting type you can specialize in on the box but if<br/>
you select  one the guildmaster will say something (I dont remember what<br/>
it is exactly they say) which will have the name of the type of spell<br/>
that specialization applies too. (Alteration, Abjuration, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If I HAVEN&#39;T specialized, what happens to the other 2-4 spell classes that<br/>
&gt; have already gone over 50?  Do they stay at 65, or do they drop back down?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This  isnt how it works,  see above. :)</div>
