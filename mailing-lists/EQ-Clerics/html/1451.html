<div id="ygrps-yiv-1168440524">Just my opinion but I do not like the ssol.    I&#39;d much rather use the<br/>
staff of observers over SSOL.  I use an enamalled black mace now which is<br/>
better than both IMO.  (If you have a guardian shield to accompany it.) <br/>

&gt; I keep reading that everyone on here loves to use there SSOL.  I would like to get this weapon as well.  I am a human cleric from the Temple of Marr in Freeport.  Will i have problems trying to do the quest, or will i be ok?  Just want to make sure, before I make that loooong journy from freeport to qeynos.  Thanks<br/>
