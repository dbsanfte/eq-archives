<div id="ygrps-yiv-32529820">mik, i agree wholeheartedly....there are items i&#39;d like to get as well, because<br/>
i wason&#39;t able or didn&#39;t know about them till the mobs wouldn&#39;t give me<br/>
exp....seems the fair thing to do is what you said...&lt;paraphrased&gt; first come,<br/>
first serve<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ll tell you what my whole opinion is on this camping/yield issue.  I think<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; first group there stays there, regardless of their level.  And noone is able<br/>
&gt; to throw<br/>
&gt; another group out if that group was there first.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have wanted a nightshade wreath and gem sceptre for ages.  So today,<br/>
&gt; myself and 5 other level 50s went to camp MM castle.  Everything there was<br/>
&gt; green to us, but myself and a level 50 shaman friend wanted wreaths and<br/>
&gt; sceptres, which we didn&#39;t have.  Under Brad&#39;s rule, if a group of<br/>
&gt; level 35+ comes, and they can get exp for that area, then we have to yield<br/>
&gt; and give up a spot we have been at for hours. Tell me where the fairness in<br/>
&gt; THAT<br/>
&gt; rule is.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Since there are very few places I can get exp anymore and have maxxed<br/>
&gt; out level 50, I am going around and getting items I don&#39;t have because I was<br/>
&gt; focusing on exp and helping others level as well.  I plan to do the Paw of<br/>
&gt; Opallo quest next.  Mitty is green to me, as is Gynok Moltar.  Should I have<br/>
&gt; to leave camping them just because lower levels come to camp for the same<br/>
&gt; items I<br/>
&gt; want?  I think that is totally unfair. Just because I am level 50 doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; mean I&quot;m not<br/>
&gt; entitled to get items I don&#39;t have just because the mobs don&#39;t give me exp<br/>
&gt; anymore.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Again, my opinion is....first there stays there.  Then when they leave, the<br/>
&gt; next group in line gets the camp spot.  I don&#39;t think levels should have<br/>
&gt; anything to do with who gets the camp spot.  I don&#39;t think high levels<br/>
&gt; should force lower levels away from a camp spot, and I don&#39;t think lower<br/>
&gt; levels should be able to force higher levels away if they were there first.<br/>
&gt; To do it any other way discriminates against one group over another (higher<br/>
&gt; vs. lower).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And I&#39;ll tell you this....if a GM tells me to leave a camp spot I have been<br/>
&gt; at<br/>
&gt; for hours for an item I don&#39;t have that I want just because some lower<br/>
&gt; levels  arrived and want my spot, then I won&#39;t be playing EQ for very<br/>
&gt; much longer.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The only fair way IMO is first there stays there, regardless of level, then<br/>
&gt; whomever was next gets it next, and so on and so on.  Get in line and take a<br/>
&gt; number.  No one group of players should be favored over another.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; To do it Brad&#39;s way, would mean that any player that didn&#39;t get an item<br/>
&gt; while he/she was<br/>
&gt; able to get exp from that particular mob could basically never get that item<br/>
&gt; cause they could be<br/>
&gt; thrown out of the camp spot everytime lower levels came along.  This is<br/>
&gt; totally not fair.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Mik (who abhors discrimination or favoritism in any way, shape or form)<br/>

&gt; &gt;What does everyone think of this Yield Policy?  In case you never heard of<br/>
&gt; &gt;it, it Brads new way of getting rid of high lvl characters camping lower<br/>
&gt; lvl<br/>
&gt; &gt;spawn points.<br/>
&gt; &gt;This is what he said but it<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;If a higher level player who would get no exp for the kill is camping a<br/>
&gt; &gt;spawn, and a group of players that would get exp (meaning they should be<br/>
&gt; &gt;there) wants to fight there, the higher level player must yield. The lower<br/>
&gt; &gt;level group has the right of way.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;As for the other disciplinary information in that post, it sounds like the<br/>
&gt; &gt;same policy that&#39;s always been in place: if you are warned several times<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt;continue to break the rules, you will be banned.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Do you all think this will work or just tick off a lot of players?  I&#39;m not<br/>
&gt; &gt;sure if I&#39;m for it or not, but also remember if your a camper doing this<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt;you&#39;re warned a few times you&#39;ll be banned from the game.  I don&#39;t really<br/>
&gt; &gt;camp, I do in a few spots but not a lot but only in places that give me<br/>
&gt; exp.<br/>
&gt; &gt;He said it wouldn&#39;t be actively enforced till it was officially announced.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Some ppl are wanting us to be able to vote yes or no on it but as of now<br/>
&gt; &gt;Brad isn&#39;t letting us vote<br/>
