not qute....lv 30, 35, 40, and 45 are barrier levels....which means it takes<br/>
way<br/>
longer to get exp in those lv....going from 30 to 31 took almost twice as<br/>
long<br/>
as opposed to going from 31 to 32.....even though it will say you gain party<br/>
exp<br/>
or whatever, it doesn&#39;t show much because it is a barrier lv<br/>

&gt; I think what she was saying is it depends on what Lvl the person you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; casting it on is on.  Like since I&#39;m still lvl 15 (should hit Lvl 16<br/>
&gt; sometime today), if casted it on me I would not get much exp back but if<br/>
