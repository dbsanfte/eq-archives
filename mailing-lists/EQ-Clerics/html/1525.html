I must admit that feel bad because I had to kill one slave. I was fighting<br/>
the slaver only to see him being continuously healed. One of the high elf<br/>
slaves was healing him. With the battle going against us I had to Smite my<br/>
brethren much to the damnation of my soul.<br/>

The keys are to unlock the slaves in CrushBone.  The key should have a<br/>
number on it and if you give the slaves a copper piece they&#39;ll tell you<br/>
their number.  So once you find the slave with the number of that key you<br/>
can set him/her free.<br/>
