<div id="ygrps-yiv-1098793848">There is a paladin (I can&#39;t remember his name, I&#39;m sure someone else has it)<br/>
in the paladin guild which is behind the clerics guild in north Kaladim.<br/>
Give him four bone chips for money, exp and an item. I used this to level my<br/>
cleric from 10th to 13th. Its a great quest when combined with the camping<br/>
of the dwarf skeletons around the skeleton tower and the druid ruins in<br/>
Butcher Block. You can give him bone chips in stacks of 20 but in<br/>
desperation to make money I always just gave him 4 at a time.<br/>

I will check out the Ruins for sure now.  What is this about the Paladin<br/>
Guild and skeleton bones?<br/>
