<div id="ygrps-yiv-613000071">I fully agree with you!<br/>
<br/>
The cleric quests wouldnt be so bad if they weren&#39;t so<br/>
unbelievably boring.  I sat in a burned out cabin for<br/>
hours! (before kithicor turned into a madhouse)  I<br/>
went afk for 2 minutes.  I ended up getting a tell<br/>
from another player saying how he &quot;accidentally&quot;<br/>
picked up the groundspawn.  *sigh*  Accidentally...<br/>
Acidentally!  After this, I totally gave up.<br/>
<br/>
The stats on the cleric armor arent all that<br/>
impressive.  I wanted to do these quests just for that<br/>
feeling of accomplishment. (plus the armor is kind of<br/>
pretty)  BAH, I give up!<br/>
