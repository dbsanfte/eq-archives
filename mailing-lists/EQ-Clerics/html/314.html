<div id="ygrps-yiv-183026875">Well congrats on Lvl 39, as for Rez I have no idea cause I&#39;m only on Lvl 15<br/>
almost 16.  But maybe cause you just got it and it doesn&#39;t do as good when<br/>
you first get it?  That might be it or just a  bug or it did give those few<br/>
ppl exp back, I don&#39;t think it gives ya a good bit back just a little bit<br/>
and maybe they just couldn&#39;t tell.<br/>

&gt; ok...upon making 39 &lt;yay (:&gt; i rezzed a couple ppl with<br/>
&gt; resusitate....but they say that exp didn&#39;t move...i rezzed one person<br/>
&gt; once, and another twice, one for each corpse.....the 2nd person said he<br/>
&gt; seen exp regained from the 2nd one, but not from the 1st, even tho he<br/>
&gt; got the mssg &quot;you have gained some exp back from the<br/>
&gt; ressurection..&quot;...just wondering, is it a bug or does it always do that?<br/>
