&gt; There is no bug. The paladin guild and cleric guilds are together, same<br/>
&gt; guild.that is how you were adle to train because it was a cleric<br/>
&gt; trainer.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Last time I leveled I went back to Freeport to train. Not knowing the area<br/>
&gt; &gt; very well I managed to go to the Paladin&#39;s guild instead of the cleric&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; guild without realizing it (yes, I know, not very clever but it was very<br/>
&gt; &gt; late). I located a trainer there and the system allowed her to train me.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Just curious if any one else has done this and if this might allow a player<br/>
&gt; &gt; to literally use any guild to train in. This has ,embarrassingly enough,<br/>
&gt; &gt; worked twice for me.<br/>
