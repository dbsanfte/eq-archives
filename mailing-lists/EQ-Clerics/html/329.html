<div id="ygrps-yiv-1096807436">I think what she was saying is it depends on what Lvl the person you&#39;re<br/>
casting it on is on.  Like since I&#39;m still lvl 15 (should hit Lvl 16<br/>
sometime today), if casted it on me I would not get much exp back but if you<br/>
casted it on a played say that was Lvl 45 they&#39;d get a good bit back.<br/>
So I take it you finally got you one of those Staff of the Observer you&#39;ve<br/>
been wanting forever.  Hope you like it and congrats on Lvl 40.  Why is Lvl<br/>
40 gonna suck by the way?  Is it like Lvl 20 when ya die you lose close to a<br/>
bubble of exp?  If thats why then I guess on Lvl 40 you what lose close to<br/>
two bubbles of exp?<br/>
