As a higher level character, I have been known to turn around, from<br/>
a begger, and give to EVERYONE else except the one asking. I will<br/>
voluntarily give things away.<br/>

If you ask your chances of getting ANYTHING just went down to nil.<br/>

Sorry. If you ask me for money I&#39;m going to tell you to go kill<br/>
fire beetles, etc. And keep EVERYTHING to sell for loot.<br/>
<br/>
If you ask me for a handout and you&#39;re wearing better than I am, I may<br/>
not even be that kind as to answer.</div>
