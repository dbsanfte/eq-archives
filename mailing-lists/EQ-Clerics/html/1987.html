<div id="ygrps-yiv-887554004">I think Complete heal is only usefull when you are grouped with a <br/>
     warrior.  Pally&#39;s and Sk&#39;s don&#39;t seem to have enough hp to make it <br/>
     mana efficent to use without letting them get down to low in health <br/>
     which is very risky (one inturrept and they are done).  The main tank <br/>
     that I group with is a L50 SK and superior heal can heal just over 2 <br/>
     bubs on her.  I agree that CH is extreamly mana efficent when used <br/>
     properly but I still think it should have a shorter casting time.<br/>
     <br/>
     Last night our SK was buffed with resolution, symbol of pinzam and an <br/>
     enchanters runeIII spell.  By the time she got back from pulling the <br/>
     king she was down to 2 bubs of health and I started a superior heal as <br/>
     soon as she was in range yet he still killed her before the spell went <br/>
     off &lt;Drogo mourns over the loss of Sinlar&gt;.<br/>
     <br/>
     All in all it wasn&#39;t a bad night though, we did get two mirthil 2 <br/>
     handers.<br/>

Sorry, Drogo, but I have to disagree here with you on complete heal.  I am <br/>
level 50 cleric and have found CH (complete heal) to be the most mana <br/>
efficient and useful heal spell I have when it comes to healing my level 50 <br/>
tanks, such as my husband Donzi, who is a level 50 warrior with almost 3400 <br/>
hps fully buffed.<br/>
     <br/>
The whole key to CH is understanding the length of casting time and timing <br/>
when to cast it.  When Donzi, or one of my other high level tanks with tons <br/>
of hps, is taking the primary beating for the group, I begin to cast it when <br/>
they are down to about 2 and a half bubbs of health.  It generally goes off <br/>
when they hit about one or one and a half bubbs of health, so I restore <br/>
close to 2700 hps or more of health for only 250 more mana pts than it cost <br/>
me to restore only 600 hps with superior heal.  And yes, I do this in combat <br/>
as well as afterwards.  Once again, the whole key to CH is your timing.<br/>
     <br/>
Obviously you aren&#39;t going to use CH on casters or other group members who <br/>
don&#39;t have such high amts of hps.  I use superior heal for them.  But for <br/>
saving mana and getting your big tanks with over 3000 hps back to full <br/>
health, nothing beats CH IMHO.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;      Does anyone else think Complete Heal is an almost useless spell in <br/>
&gt;      combat situations?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      This spell has one of the longest delays for a cleric so it is very<br/>
&gt;      dangerous to use in combat situations.  I think the only cleric spell <br/>
&gt;      that takes longer to cast is shield of words.  The only time I found <br/>
&gt;      this spell usefull was when I was grouped with a L50 warrior since he <br/>
&gt;      had so many hp superior heal was only healing one bub of his health. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      Last night I was in LGuk and our group was camping the froglik King.<br/>
     <br/>
&gt;      Now this guy hits hard and fast (140 double attacks) and I was <br/>
casting<br/>
&gt;      superior heals one after another just to keep our tank (L50 sk) <br/>
alive.<br/>
&gt;       There is no way I could have gotten off a complete heal during these <br/>
&gt;      fights.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      It also doesn&#39;t make much sence to me that it takes longer to <br/>
&gt;      completely heal someone than it does to ressurect them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      I think all of our healing spells need reduced casting times,  It&#39;s <br/>
&gt;      very frustrating when your tank looses their last 2 bubs of health <br/>
&gt;      when your trying to get a heal off just to see thoes blue sparkles <br/>
&gt;      around their corpse.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      Just something to think about. <br/>
