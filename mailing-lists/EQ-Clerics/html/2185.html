<div id="ygrps-yiv-1495295309">it is +10 wisdom, +10 mana.  I got mine last week.   Unfortunately, I believe that the spawn is longer than 7 hours.   This might be wrong , but I was told that it used to be every 7 hours but now they have changed it to 2 spawns per day.   I waited a FULL 7 hours when I camped him, so if it is in fact 7 hours then I must have got there RIGHT after he died, and the place was empty when I got there so I believe it is longer than 7 hours.   I hate the camping quests... I guess that is Verant&#39;s idea of a good time.     I literally sat at his spawn site for 7 hours.   He is level 15 or so... green to me at 27.    It is a nice item though...<br/>

&gt; I am level 20 and am doing the Testament of Vinear Quest. It starts in <br/>
&gt; Qeynos and ends in Highpass. You get a really cool looking &quot;bible&quot; wich is <br/>
&gt; +9wis +10??mana which you hold in your off hand. The guy you need to kill is <br/>
&gt; low blue to me at 20, the problem is he only spawns once every 7 &quot;real&quot; <br/>
&gt; hours.<br/>

&gt; &gt;     What would you say is the best quest for the ease of doing?  I mean<br/>
&gt; &gt;obviously I won&#39;t be doing and high level quests if I am lvl 15-20 or so,<br/>
&gt; &gt;but what would you recommend for that lvl?  I am just getting tired of the<br/>
&gt; &gt;boredom of blood and guts for a bit, and wanting to try something else - <br/>
&gt; &gt;any<br/>
&gt; &gt;input on the matter is welcome.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Thank You!<br/>
