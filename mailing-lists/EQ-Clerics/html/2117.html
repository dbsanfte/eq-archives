<div id="ygrps-yiv-1380473444">I spent some time soloing there, but I still prefer grouping. I was using a <br/>
tactic I called &quot;The Cleric assassin&quot;. Basically sneak in invis, pick one <br/>
target, kill it fast and get out ASAP to rest. I liked better killing them <br/>
on site, but it&#39;s not possible when they&#39;re not alone, you then have to be <br/>
very careful pulling, using calm, etc. Don&#39;t pull anywhere close to the <br/>
trains path.<br/>
At 21 stay on the first floor, look for mummies and dries mainly, but dark <br/>
boned are still good. Ghouls are not that good but you might have to clear <br/>
them. Keep up all your buffs up (daring, armor, symbol, endure fire and <br/>
magic). If a druid or shaman is around try to get a SOW.<br/>
That&#39;s pretty much it. Don&#39;t be too greedy. Exp is good for each kill, so <br/>
get out each time it doesn&#39;t look good.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Does anyone have any tips for solo-ing in Unrest?  I was there last<br/>
&gt;night on the test server.  I&#39;m a bar away from 21.  I start out in a<br/>
&gt;small group.  On the test server, there are around 15 people max in<br/>
&gt;Unrest at any given time.  So most people either skirt the outside,<br/>
&gt;or camp the front yard, and have someone pull from the house.  We<br/>
&gt;were pulling from the house, and the place was like grand central<br/>
&gt;station.<br/>
&gt;  The best time I&#39;d ever had in Unrest was when we had a 30+ level<br/>
&gt;druid in wolf form pulling for us.  We took out the entire second<br/>
&gt;floor without any problems.  But if the person pulling is low enough<br/>
&gt;level, they get way more than they bargained for.<br/>
&gt;  Well, I had to leave for a bit, and when I came back, the group was<br/>
&gt;full, so I decided to solo.  I cast invis to undead on myself, and I<br/>
&gt;would pull a ghoul, or a DB from the first floor.  The ghouls were<br/>
&gt;usually blue, sometimes green, but I always got xp for them.  The<br/>
&gt;Lurking mummys were tough, but I could solo those, but usually if I<br/>
&gt;/yelled for help.  But I tried to stick with ghouls and DBs.<br/>
&gt;  I figured that I could mem calm and calm extras, and would just be<br/>
&gt;able to pull one mob at a time.  I got nearly half a bar solo-ing, and<br/>
&gt;it worked pretty well. I ended up dying 3 times last night though,<br/>
&gt;from other peoples trains, and I ended up with slightly less xp than<br/>
&gt;when I started.  Anyone have any good advice for solo-ing this place?<br/>
