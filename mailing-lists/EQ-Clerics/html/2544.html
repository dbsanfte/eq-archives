<div id="ygrps-yiv-282625601">Agreed. My bard was given a Ringmail Chest and headpiece last night when she<br/>
ran back from West Karana to Freeport to give someone fastfeets to their<br/>
corpse (in West Karana) The Paladin had grown into bronze instead.<br/>
(I discovered I like the chain look on Wood elves instead... So this<br/>
Ringmail MAY be traded out for a small size. But it isn&#39;t going away unless<br/>
I find something with AWESOME stats -- anyone know if any of the magical<br/>
armor has a chain look?)<br/>
<br/>
Anytime I&#39;ve been given stuff, it is after I did something for someone.<br/>
I had a ranger use bind wounds on a high level wizard sitting medding and he<br/>
was given a fine steel rapier on IC Christmas day (Plus cash. I was just<br/>
practicing Bind Wound!)<br/>

I agree with other posters - don&#39;t beg.  I&#39;ve received gifts from other<br/>
players in two circumstances.  The first, I randomly grouped with an<br/>
enchanter who&#39;s player also had a high level druid.  After talking a while,<br/>
then enchanter said he had absolutely no shortage of pp.  To prove his<br/>
point, he gave everyone in the group like 10pp.  We all said thanks.  After<br/>
thanking him, he then gave each of us 50pp.  The second time I received a<br/>
gift was after helping someone recover a corpse.  I died in the attempt, but<br/>
they got their corpse back.  When I recovered my corpse, she asked if there<br/>
was anything she could give me in payment.  I said don&#39;t worry about it.<br/>
She insisted and gave me a pair of +3 dex bracelets.<br/>
<br/>
Do good deeds or others, and they will often return the favor.<br/>
