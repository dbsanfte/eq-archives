<div id="ygrps-yiv-716382340">The enchanted weapons came from the various high level<br/>
good races. Specifically, then enchanted battleworn<br/>
morningstar came from a high priestess of Brell that<br/>
were in East Karana. So, you will find 1 maybe two on<br/>
the whole server as they were event items.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; &lt;SNIP&gt;&lt;&lt;During the actual dark elf invasion,<br/>
&gt; Enchanted weapons were dropped,<br/>
&gt; as<br/>
&gt; well as a few really nice artifacts.  Then, after<br/>
&gt; Innorukk cast the<br/>
&gt; zonewide spell of instant death, the first wave of<br/>
&gt; undead spawned and<br/>
&gt; killed those who were returning to their corpses. <br/>
&gt; For the first 2 real<br/>
&gt; life days, these undead dropped Tainted weapons. <br/>
&gt; The tainted were just<br/>
&gt; as good as teh Enchanted in most cases except they<br/>
&gt; were no drop and had<br/>
&gt; -5 sv disease.  Then the GMs announced that the<br/>
&gt; undead would not spawn<br/>
&gt; in kithicor, at least for a while.  This was<br/>
&gt; probably due to the fact<br/>
&gt; that the weapons were way too nice.  After another<br/>
&gt; couple days the<br/>
&gt; undead came back but only dropped Ruined weapons,<br/>
&gt; and much more rarely.<br/>
&gt; The Ruined weapons have the same stat bonuses but<br/>
&gt; much worse attack and<br/>
&gt; delays.  Im not sure if the undead have been changed<br/>
&gt; again tho, as i<br/>
&gt; havent hunted there for a while.<br/>
