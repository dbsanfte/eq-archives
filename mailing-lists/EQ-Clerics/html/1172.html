&gt; The dress idea is interesting. There is an item indexed on EQ&#39;izer called a<br/>
&gt; &#39;black silk evening tunic&#39;. It increases your charisma, but isn&#39;t very good<br/>
&gt; armor. ^_^ Forget where it comes from. Anyone seen anyone wearing one? What<br/>
&gt; does it look like? Is it strapless?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For that matter, it might be interesting to go bar-hopping in a tux, my<br/>
&gt; being a male, and all.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But wait. We&#39;re clerics. Shouldn&#39;t we be able to wear vestments on special<br/>
&gt; occasions? Now that would be cool.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I agree with Twylork and Heather about the stun issue, there is nothing so<br/>
&gt; &gt;frustrating as trying to flee a train, having divine aura on and then being<br/>
&gt; &gt;all twisted around in the opposite direction of where you were going<br/>
&gt; because<br/>
&gt; &gt;the enemy stunned you. What makes it worse is the spell has a small<br/>
&gt; duration<br/>
&gt; &gt;and it takes valuable seconds to get yourself pointed back in the right<br/>
&gt; &gt;direction. Oh well, one can only hope that if enough p<br/>
&gt; &gt;eople complain EQ designers will adjust it.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Also I would like to get your opinions on the fashion issue. What do you<br/>
&gt; &gt;think of the women of Norrath being able to attend an event, such as a<br/>
&gt; &gt;wedding in a dress. There also should a gathering place in Qeynos where an<br/>
&gt; &gt;event could take place without being attacked by beasts, or the guys could<br/>
&gt; &gt;really become Knights in Shining Armor by protecting all the fair damsels<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt;Norrath. Again an item for my wish list as I sometimes get tired of wearing<br/>
&gt; &gt;my full battle dress all the time. Healingsun, Solusek Ro. Level 15 cleric<br/>
