<div id="ygrps-yiv-854339089">Just a note i completely agree with Allsar about the spells he is advising<br/>
you to get, however you may want to pick up Endure cold at t later time, it<br/>
can be helpful when fighting in unrest as well, there are many spells that i<br/>
did not buy at the level in which they were available to me, every now and<br/>
then i go back and pick certain ones up that i want to give a try later on.<br/>
The Symbol line of spells are good to put on IMO your tank transal give 80<br/>
or so HP, but it does require a reagant, which can be costly at you level,<br/>
it is not a buff you want to just dole out to all you see....<br/>
Hope that Helps.<br/>

&gt;Hello all,<br/>
&gt;I just made 14 recently and wonder if you can help me out with spells.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Any recommendations for 14 lvl spells beside heal and bind?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve been thinking about Halo of Light because I hate the dark but<br/>
&gt;I dont want to spend 7pp on something that a lantern does. Does it really<br/>
&gt;help to see around you when your in the dark or is just in the immediate<br/>
 </span></blockquote>radius?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;Can you explain how cancel magic works? Does it remove the negative effects<br/>
&gt;of spells on people?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;How much HP does Symbol of Transal add and what item do you need for it?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The Endure Cold and Endure Disease spells seem pretty useless to me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks for help,<br/>
