&quot;Speaking of connection problems.<br/>
EVERYTIME I log into EQ for the first time of a gaming session, I lose<br/>
connection after about 5 minutes of play.    I have to log off my ISP<br/>
reconnect and load back up EQ then I&#39;m fine for the rest of the time.<br/>
<br/>
ANYONE have any idea why this may be happening?  It seems to me like<br/>
more<br/>
of an ISP problem since I have to log off of my isp to reconnect to EQ<br/>
but<br/>
who knows...&quot;<br/>

Wow, the exact same thing happens to me. In fact, last night, I was<br/>
swimming to Halas, but before I got there, I was disconnected from my<br/>
ISP. THIS HAPPENS EVERY DAMN NIGHT, WITHOUT FAIL. Luckily, i was able to<br/>
log back on in time not to drown. <br/>
<br/>
I usually just connect to my isp and surf for 5 to 10 minutes before<br/>
logging onto EQ. But I shouldn&#39;t frikken have to do that, right?<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s most frustrating is the message I see when I&#39;ve been<br/>
disconnected: &quot;Your connection has been terminated. Do you wish to<br/>
reconnect?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well, NO SHIT Sherlock!<br/>
<br/>
Grrrr.<br/>
