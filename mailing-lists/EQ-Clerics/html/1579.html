<div id="ygrps-yiv-782146173"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; thought Aviaks only attacked when attacked or when they saw you attacking<br/>
&gt; another one?  If so how come they came up and attacked us when all we were<br/>
&gt; doing was sitting and medding?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If someone had previously attacked them, then zoned or died, they were<br/>
probably still aggro. Seems you and your friend were the first people they<br/>
saw, and they vented their anger upon you.<br/>
