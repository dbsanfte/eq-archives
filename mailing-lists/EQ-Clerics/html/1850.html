&gt; So the Testament of Vanear can only be held in the hand where you have to<br/>
&gt; carry your shield? If that is true, then I will stick with my Charred<br/>
&gt; Guardian Shield which not only gives me +9 wisdom but AC as well.  The extra<br/>
&gt; AC is worth losing one point in wisdom if that is the only hand you can hold<br/>
&gt; the Testament in.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Can the Paw be held in either hand?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes it can.. when I swap to using a weapon I swap paw into off hand<br/>
since it has AC 9.  Saves me having to carry a shield about which is<br/>
much heavier.  Being a Dark Elf I have low strength and I still wear<br/>
quite a bit of Bronze (not managed to get the +wis armour for those bits<br/>
yet) so weight is a bigger problem for me than AC.  I try not to get<br/>
attacked in the first place if I can and if I do I have high agi which<br/>
helps a lot.<br/>
