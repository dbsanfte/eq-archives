&gt;I disagree on the moving anyone on lvl 10 and below to another server.  How<br/>
&gt;would you feel if you were Lvl 10 or below and you had friends say on 12<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;up, next thing you know you&#39;re on another server and they are still on that<br/>
&gt;one and you can&#39;t group or talk to them anymore?  I think only 500<br/>
&gt;per-server is too little, I&#39;d say 1,000 to 1,500 is cool I&#39;d take 1,950 to<br/>
&gt;2,000 if they&#39;d put in more places for us to go and hunt and give us more<br/>
&gt;cool items to loot.  I heard the Glowing Crook you get off Lock Jaw can be<br/>

&gt;else they need to fix, I mean how is it right for me as a Cleric to be<br/>
&gt;beating the crap outta something and a powerful Wizard comes along and with<br/>
&gt;one blast kills it and gets the exp and the loot?  Are Wizards too<br/>
 </span></blockquote>powerful,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;seems like it too me, I know a Wizard that on Lvl 12 was doing over 100 dmg<br/>
&gt;to things with one cast of a magic spell.  I on Lvl 16 get&#39;s lucky to do 76<br/>
&gt;dmg to somethings with one cast of a spell.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That bit about the 100 pt damage spell is not quite correct. I have played a<br/>
Wizard, and at level 12 you get Shock of Lightning, which does damage in the<br/>
low 80&#39;s. You don&#39;t get a 100 pt damage spell until level 16. At levels 14<br/>
and 15, clerics can actually do more damage to the undead (although not to<br/>
other mobs) than a wizard.<br/>
<br/>
People hate wizards because they can killsteal, but you know, it&#39;s like that<br/>
old joke: Why do dogs lick their b***s? Answer: because they can.<br/>
<br/>
In Unrest, and other undead dungeons, clerics can killsteal, and a couple,<br/>
including the notorious Soulbasher (may Brell curse his name and fizzle his<br/>
spells!) do so regularly. We curse wizards because they commit sins...that<br/>
we are usually not capable of. But when we are capable, a few clerics will<br/>
be succumb to temptation and be killstealers as well.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s funny. I didn&#39;t killsteal as a wizard, but switched characters because<br/>
of an impression that no one really wanted a wizard. As a cleric, I have a<br/>
new appreciation of wizards. My thing is healing, and having a wizard in my<br/>
party can vastly reduce the damage I have to heal, because the mobs get<br/>
taken down more quickly. Less downtime, less mana expenditure, safer fights<br/>
against tougher mobs -- a better time is had by all. I really appreciate<br/>
having a wizard in the party.<br/>
<br/>
The whole killstealing thing is due to a very, very bad design decision by<br/>
Verant. I.e., that a group&#39;s total damage is ignored in assigning credit for<br/>
kills, and if an outside player has done more damage than any *single* group<br/>
member, then he gets credit for the kill. Brad posted a note about this<br/>
design decision to the Vault message boards, that was reprinted widely on<br/>
the news pages. Verant seemed to feel that if a group&#39;s total damage was<br/>
counted, then groups would steal from individuals.<br/>
<br/>
Duh! Now we have exactly the opposite problem. And why, in a group-oriented<br/>
game, are we catering to the least ethical, most unsocial, nastiest solo<br/>
players?<br/>
<br/>
I ran into a guy -- yes, a wizard -- named Odisius, in Unrest on Fennin Ro<br/>
the other night, who was soloing and killstealing from groups. He said he<br/>
had no real interest in playing the game, but was only trying to level to 20<br/>
so he could sell the character/account on eBay.<br/>
<br/>
This is the kind of person the current damage-assignment algorithm benfits.<br/>
Aaaccckkk! This is dumb, and make the game frustrating for those who really<br/>
want to play and enjoy it.<br/>
<br/>
I am going to send Verant some screenshots of Odisius sceaming obscenities,<br/>
and describe his behavior, along with a plea to rethink the kill-assignment<br/>
algorithm. Everyone should email Verant with the same request, talk it up on<br/>
the message boards and newsgroups, and maybe Verant change the code and end<br/>
this whole killstealing debacle.<br/>
