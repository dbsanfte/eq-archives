<div id="ygrps-yiv-836856689">So far everyone has said that sticking to casting is the way to go. I must<br/>
say, that is the way I&#39;m going to go. I would willingly give up my weapon<br/>
for a +9 wis (or so) item. I don&#39;t mind being in a melee, but with a decent<br/>
sized group, I will stay well away from the mobs so I can stick to what I do<br/>
best (and enjoy most).<br/>
<br/>
Having said that, I must point out that it is my choice to do that. I&#39;m not<br/>
doing it because anyone told me to, I do it because it&#39;s how I like to play.<br/>
Part of the reason I enjoy it so much is because I am able to make that<br/>
decision. If I had to do it because I wasn&#39;t allowed any choice, it wouldn&#39;t<br/>
be so appealing.<br/>
<br/>
From what you said, it sounds like you really want to go for the melee stats<br/>
over wisdom. I encourage you to do so, for no other reason than because you<br/>
want to. This is *your* character, you should play him the way *you* want.<br/>
Make your decision based on what will get you more enjoyment from the game.<br/>
