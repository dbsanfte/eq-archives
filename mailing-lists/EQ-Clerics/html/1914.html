Stun also helps in getting spells off.<br/>

&gt; your group.  No, you will not do good with melee.  And<br/>
&gt; no, you are not a nuker!  (even though our spells seem<br/>
&gt; nice and powerful when we first get them, they are<br/>
&gt; just not mana efficient and they take forever to<br/>
&gt; recover)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t try to be the tank, but don&#39;t be afraid to hit it a few times if<br/>
your full of mana (if the beasty falls quicker it will do less damage).<br/>
Don&#39;t be affraid to stun or bomb espicially if you got a runner (trains<br/>
suck, do anything and everything to avoid them). Maybe when I get to 32<br/>
and SolB my experience and ideas will change from 28 and solA.</div>
