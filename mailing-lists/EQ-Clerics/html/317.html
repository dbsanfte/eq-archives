<div id="ygrps-yiv-780553916">I don&#39;t get it.  I am reading about mid teen lvl clerics that have not hunted more thatn a zone or two away from their original starting point.  They are complaining about lack of money, weapons, and armor.  I let Felwithe at lvl 3 and haven&#39;t been back except to visit since.  Money is easy to get.  Group and kill stuff you can&#39;t kill by yourself.  Weapons can be bought and traded.  Go and see the world folks.</div>
