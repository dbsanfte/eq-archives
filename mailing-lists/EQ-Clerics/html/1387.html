<div id="ygrps-yiv-115156861">I, personally, am getting extremely disgusted with Verant.  I think they<br/>
should be focusing on some very serious problems, such as the Plane of Fear<br/>
which they ruined and so many high levels leaving the game because of<br/>
boredom, nothing to do and now this unfair &quot;yield&quot; policy.<br/>
<br/>
 At the auction on Saturday, I saw two people buy Boxes of Abu-Kar, one for<br/>
1550 plat the other for 1700 plat.  Two days later guess what...they are<br/>
worth about 5 plat.  Sure Verant....it was another &quot;code error&quot; or typo that<br/>
you simply had to fix.  Don&#39;t insult my intelligence!!<br/>
<br/>
I am about at the point where I am ready to leave EQ for another game or<br/>
something where everytime you turn around the developers aren&#39;t shafting<br/>
you.  So many in my guild and on my server are simply leaving or selling<br/>
their characters.  And they aren&#39;t all level 50s either.  I say shame on<br/>
Verant for what they have done and are doing to the players.<br/>
<br/>
Just my opinion, as always.....flame away, because I really don&#39;t care<br/>
anymore<br/>
