<div id="ygrps-yiv-562108782">I can see a great reason to do it.  You have a guild that is all high level<br/>
characters.  You&#39;ve played a character to level 50 and want to try a<br/>
different class but want to play with your guild.  Makes sense to me.<br/>

I don&#39;t really see why anyone would want to do this stuff.  I mean I like to<br/>
earn my Lvls not have them handed to me.  I either solo stuff I can kill<br/>
thats blue or black to me or I get in a group, which lately I&#39;ve been<br/>
grouping, daytime I&#39;m soloing then around 6pm or 7 I&#39;m in a group till about<br/>
12a to 1 or later.  I can understand having a friend help you out with money<br/>
and a better weapon or armor but thats about as far as I&#39;d go.  I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
want to be Lvl 4 with a full suit of Ruby, maybe banded and thats it.  I&#39;m<br/>
now Lvl 18 and I wear Banded, Chain and Mesh armor, some of it I bought and<br/>
other parts friends gave to me to help me out.<br/>
