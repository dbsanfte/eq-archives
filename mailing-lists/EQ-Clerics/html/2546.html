<div id="ygrps-yiv-1975821299">Might I suggest you try this in Cazic?  =)  <br/>
Just the other night I heard somebody shouting asking somebody to buy all their FS from them<br/>
at 2pp each.  Since you can sell them at 5pp each, it&#39;s a good deal.   There is a lot more FS in Cazic than there is in unrest and it&#39;s a lot further from good selling grounds.  This is especially a good spot if you play an Ogre or a Troll and can sell in Ogguk... since most of the people in Cazic have to go much further to sell.    I know that I usually end up leaving FS lyin on the ground in Cazic because it weighs me down to the point where i can&#39;t even move.   It works out to be a good deal for the people in Cazic because they can sell all their FS with a 2pp/per profit and not have to run back to sell their stuff, and a good deal for you as well because you make 3pp per piece.    I don&#39;t think this would work as well in Unrest since there isn&#39;t nearly as much FS available.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ve been doing a similiar thing in Unrest lately.  Suprisingly, it isn&#39;t as<br/>
&gt; profitable as you might imagine.  At some points, it gets down right<br/>
&gt; annoying to do. I have made about 30pp doing it in one nite, but it does<br/>
&gt; become tiresome.  If you have the patience to do it, you can spend hours<br/>
&gt; trying to buy and sell.  But in my opinion, it just ends up being a waste of<br/>
&gt; time.<br/>

&gt; There was a great little business on Fennin Ro called, Rokk and Rhunes <br/>
&gt; Emporium, hehe.  These 2 Ogres had this business going in Cazic doing the <br/>
&gt; very same thing.  At least one of them was there everyday. They had to have <br/>
&gt; made tremendous amounts of cash there.  It is very time consuming and takes <br/>
&gt; aways from the hunt quite a bit, but it is an easy way to make cash.<br/>
&gt; I also just recently noticed that there is a travelling person in South <br/>
&gt; Karana now, he starts out at the Bridge, announcing to the zone he is there <br/>
&gt; to change their money for them from Copper to silver, gold, etc...  He then <br/>
&gt; travels to different set locations, Centaurs, aviaks, etc... advertising as <br/>
&gt; he goes.  I&#39;m not sure how successful he is but seems like it would be <br/>
&gt; profittable.<br/>
