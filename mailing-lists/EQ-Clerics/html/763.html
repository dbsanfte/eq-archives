&gt; I completely agree with you. Verant needs to fix the coding on this, to make <br/>
&gt; sure that the group gets the kill...or...whoever attacks the MOB first gets <br/>
&gt; the kill. Its very very disheartening to camp something for hours and hours <br/>
&gt; with your group, just to have a wizard or other high level spell casting <br/>
&gt; class come along and take it with one shot.<br/>

&gt; Please forgive, for I am new to this list, but here is my problem and<br/>
&gt; suggestion for Verant:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My number one problem with the game is kill stealing. This frustrates me to<br/>
&gt; no end.  I can&#39;t begin to tell you how long I have been trying for a Shiny<br/>
&gt; Brass Shield in Crushbone and how many kills have been stolen from me from<br/>
&gt; some mage hiding in a tree.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think the problem is how Verant determines who gets the kill. As I<br/>
&gt; understand it, the single person that inflicts the most damage is awarded<br/>
&gt; the kill.  This means that it does not matter if you are grouped and your<br/>
&gt; group does more damage than the spell caster.  Does this seem crazy to<br/>
&gt; anyone else.  It should work that the groups damage counts as one. I believe<br/>
&gt; that this would cut down on the amount of kills that are stolen.  It seems<br/>
&gt; like an easy fix and it makes logical sense.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What is everyone else&#39;s opinion, and has anybody heard of Verant commenting<br/>
&gt; on this issue?<br/>
