<div id="ygrps-yiv-199981371">Ok from what I understand about kiting (of course I thinking they could&#39;ve<br/>
came up with a better name then kiting), is that it&#39;s when you cast SoW or<br/>
use something like JBoots to speed you up and you cast a slow spell on a<br/>
monster thats yellow to you.  Since it&#39;s moving slow and you&#39;re moving fast<br/>
you can beat it easy.  This is for soloers only, it&#39;s so you can get good<br/>
exp without a group.<br/>
<br/>
As for the twinking you asked about it&#39;s when you&#39;re on a low lvl and a<br/>
friend thats on a higher lvl gives you money, weapons and armor that a low<br/>
lvl player shouldn&#39;t really have.  Also can be done by you having a high lvl<br/>
and a low lvl characters and giving a friend the items to hand to you&#39;re low<br/>
lvl character.<br/>

&gt; &gt;I found it quite amusing last night while i was in Rathe Mts. we were<br/>
&gt; &gt;hunting Hill giants and there was a Druid who was a blue con to me, so he<br/>
&gt; &gt;was under lvl 35 and he was kiting hill giants that were yellow to me so<br/>
&gt; &gt;chances are it was red to him. amazing what kiting can do<br/>
