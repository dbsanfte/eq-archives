<b>Subject:</b> new 24th level spell? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1563511248">Just an interesting observation.  I wrote down all the 24th level<br/>
spells that EQ&#39;lizer listed, and I headed out to buy them.  I had a<br/>
high level necromancer cast some kind of charisma buff on me, so I<br/>
ended up saving about 8 plat.  :)<br/>
<br/>
I came across a spell that EQ&#39;lizer did not list - Counteract Poison.<br/>
It was in the Freeport temple. I didn&#39;t buy it since I ran out of coin<br/>
buying other things, and I&#39;m only 21st level anyway, so I&#39;m a bit<br/>
premature on buying them anyway, but I wanted to get them out of the<br/>
way.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d never heard of that spell, so I don&#39;t know if it was new, or just<br/>
overlooked.  I can only assume that it is an upgrade to the<br/>
pathetically weak, cure poison, and will cure rattlesnake poison, etc,<br/>
with one cast and not 3.<br/>
<br/>
FYI.<br/>
<br/>
Also, for anyone curious, I bought all but that 1 spell for roughly<br/>
75 platinum.  Well, I also ended up buying extinguish fatigue and<br/>
halo of light as well.  So the total price was probably around 60.<br/>
