<div id="ygrps-yiv-2039986756">hehehehe this is true...i find it quite funny to watch the stuff go running by,<br/>
then watch as it comes back and see what was taken out and what wasn&#39;t....also,<br/>
if you&#39;re in the cy, and someone shouts train and you&#39;re in the middle of a<br/>
fight, try to finish it off as quick as possible because that train will be on<br/>
you if it sees you attacking something...even if it&#39;s a death beetle......was<br/>
funny tho, i was told that one time i pulled one of the biggest trains in<br/>
there.....was rezzing a friend, he died right outside barkeep room.....i went up<br/>
there, invis to undead, casted, and everythng from 4th on down followed me to<br/>
the zone.....wasn&#39;t fun, but now that i think back on it, it was really funny<br/>

&gt; Whoa! You must have had a really bad group. I lived in Unrest from level 16<br/>
&gt; until level 20, made lots of loot, didn&#39;t die any more than I did elsewhere,<br/>
&gt; and came out with a full set of bronze armor. I moved on only because I<br/>
&gt; thought I was getting a little stale, and I knew I was going to have to be<br/>
&gt; level 24 or 25 before I could safely fight in the barroom or the tower, or<br/>
&gt; level 30 before I could go to the basement. And when I hit those levels, I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; a&#39;comin&#39; back!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Unfortunately, a lot of other people like Unrest, too, which is why it isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; unusual to see 100 people in that zone on Fennin Ro, evenings =(.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s true, the trains can be amazing. But one nice thing about Unrest is<br/>
&gt; that the lawn is so wide open, you can often get out of the way of the<br/>
&gt; train, which you can&#39;t do in Befallen or Guk, or even Crushbone often. It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; awe inspiring to watch two festering hags, a werebat, a greater darkbone or<br/>
&gt; two, a couple of mortuary fungi, a tentacle terror, the dwarven spirit and a<br/>
&gt; gaggle of tormented dead, darkbones, lurking mummies and death beetles<br/>
&gt; thunder past you, headed for the exit!<br/>
