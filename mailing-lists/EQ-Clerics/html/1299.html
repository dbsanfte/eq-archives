<div id="ygrps-yiv-1010868361">As have I, I know my SSoL has &quot;cleansed&quot; me many times, well over 30.  As<br/>
for the price issue, I had a guildmate trade one straight up for a Cold Iron<br/>
Morning Star, and have seen them go sometimes for around 100pp.  Getting the<br/>
SSoL was not nearly something easy for me, as I play a dwarven cleric and<br/>
had to work for about 6 played hours on getting my faction to an acceptable<br/>
point to where I could even get the quest.  That&#39;s why in some areas, you<br/>
could get quite a high price for it.  I&#39;ve also noticed that the SSoL will<br/>
either speed up or remove root-type effects, as I&#39;ve gotten lucky a few<br/>
times in Unrest and the cleanse has gone off after beeing rooted by a ghoul<br/>
or carrion ghoul, and allowed me to move again.  Maybe it was just<br/>
incredible timing.  *shrug*<br/>

&gt; I have never had to have my SSoL &quot;recharged&quot; and I have had it for some<br/>
&gt; time. The cleanse effect goes off based upon a check to your dexterity<br/>
&gt; during combat.<br/>

&gt; Clerics have a hard time doing the quest?  LOL i am a human cleric and had<br/>
&gt; no troule doing said quest, in fact it was one of the easier ones i have<br/>
&gt; done.  Now for my question, what exactly does clense do?  I was under the<br/>
&gt; impression that it took of negitive effects on the player, tho it always<br/>
&gt; seems to clense me when i dont need it, and there are only 30 charges on<br/>
it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I have no clue how to get it recharged.  I am a lvl 24 cleric on Xegony,<br/>
&gt; and am now using a screaming mace which i perfer, the SSoL was nice, fast,<br/>
&gt; and consistant in the amount of damg it did, but the effect was wasted on<br/>
my<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; toon as i never seem to get many neg effects on me.  Suffice it to say I<br/>
&gt; gave my SSoL to a noobie that was begging, LOL he loved it and i was happy<br/>
&gt; to help, as far as what it is worth, i have no clue as i would pay nothing<br/>
&gt; over 20p for it and thats going above the value to me.  It&#39;s prob worth<br/>
alot<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; to ppl who want them badly and less to others that don&#39;t.   just INHO,<br/>
stay<br/>
&gt; safe and have fun<br/>

&gt; &gt;The SSoL is a funny thing. It is probably worth more than it seems.<br/>
Similar<br/>
&gt; &gt;weapons for pure casters (e.g. Water Crystal staff) I&#39;ve seen selling for<br/>
&gt; &gt;100pp+. The SSoL is basically a mediocre weapon, but with a pretty useful<br/>
&gt; &gt;effect. Many clerics cannot do the quest (or don&#39;t want to spend time<br/>
&gt; &gt;building faction). To them, it may be fairly desirable.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I traded my first one to a lvl 30 Teir&#39;dal cleric in return for a pair of<br/>
&gt; &gt;crested spaulders (AC11, +6sta), and I think I got the better deal. So I<br/>
&gt; &gt;would say: make your way over to East Commons or Nektulos and you may get<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; &gt;good price.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Second: I know that prices very greatly from server to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; server, but what<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; sort of price range am I looking at if I want to sell my<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; shinig star of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; light mace? around 20pp, around 100pp?? I really have no idea, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; since I am a broke cleric(is there another kind) I would like to get a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; proper amount of money for it.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; All thoughts would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks!<br/>
