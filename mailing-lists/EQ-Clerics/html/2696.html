<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1413445979">1. Are high elf clerics the lowest leveling race/class in the game?<br/>
I&#39;d heard that at least high elves leveled about the slowest, and my<br/>
observations seem to lend itself to that assumption.<br/>
<br/>
2. I&#39;ve got all the pieces for my caduceus of the sacrement.  The<br/>
thing from Mistmoore, the piece from the darkbone giant skel, and two<br/>
plat bars.  When I go to Ro temple, and I give the bars to the person<br/>
to magnetize them, do I give them 1 bar at a time?  Also, do I give<br/>
all 4 things to the person (is it Gavel?) at the same time, with the<br/>
2 bars in each box, filling up the 4 total slots (bar, bar, ingot,<br/>
icon)?  I don&#39;t want to screw it up!<br/>
<br/>
3. Is Aviak Isle a good place to solo at 26th level?  I just made 26th<br/>
and while I don&#39;t know if I can take gull or not, I&#39;d like to give it<br/>
the ol&#39; college try (if I see him).  But I&#39;m curious if I could solo<br/>
here with relative safety.  I&#39;d hate to pull one blue and have 14<br/>
birds jump me, with nowhere to run to. How does one leave this island?<br/>
Gate away?  Is this the island right near the Butcherblock pier?  Any<br/>
solo&#39;ing tips here are appreciated.<br/>
