<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;it IS the point....you look at it as discrimination....ok....what about<br/>
&gt;those who can NOT spend hours like some people who do not work....dont go to<br/>
&gt;school etc?  so its fair these people, who should be able to get the same<br/>
&gt;items too cannot because people who could have had these things at lvl 25,<br/>
&gt;decide at lvl 50 they want them?  I play in SOL A all the time....you know<br/>
&gt;what I see? lvl 30+  killing creatures they could do EASILY solo, that have<br/>
&gt;been green for over 8-10 lvls, just to get ONE RARE SPAWN...meanwhile the<br/>
&gt;lower lvls cant get crap....exp OR items.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>People who CHOOSE not to spend hours playing this game, do just that, CHOOSE<br/>
not to spend hours playing.  Hence, no one is discriminating against them on<br/>
issues of camping, they are simply takign themself out of the picture.  You<br/>
seem to making sweeping generalizations again, not all high level players<br/>
&quot;do not work....dont go to school etc&quot;.  A large number of us hold full time<br/>
jobs, and simply choose to spend our free time playing this game.<br/>
<br/>
From personal experience, even a level 50 character would have some<br/>
difficulties dealing with all the aggressive mobs in SolA, especially<br/>
clerics.  Everything, and I do mean EVERYTHING in SolA will aggro any<br/>
player.  Sure a Young goblin and even Cinder goblins aren&#39;t too hard to deal<br/>
with.  However, when you walk into a room with a flame goblin, inferno<br/>
goblin, and cinder goblin wizards, it&#39;s goign to take you quite some time to<br/>
clear it.  Hence, a group, no matter what level will be necessary to go<br/>
anywhere do just about anything in SolA.  SolA is a very large zone, if you<br/>
are having a hard time finding a place to garner experience, perhaps you<br/>
aren&#39;t looking in the right place.  Even at level 30 to level 34, there are<br/>
quite a number of places you can garner decent xp in the place.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;You talk about fairness, yet yo dont look at the WHOLE picture....people<br/>
&gt;cant be in the game 24/7....and if you are...I&#39;m sorry...you&#39;ve got bigger<br/>
&gt;problems then whining about this game.  People complain about the economy,<br/>
&gt;yet when things are done to fix it...you dont like it either.  I truly hope<br/>
&gt;that Verant goes and codes in &quot;green cons give SQUAT&quot; so you all can shut up<br/>
&gt;and leave, or stay and play and stop whining.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sorry to say that we are lookign at the big picture, just as you are,<br/>
but we don&#39;t have any bias when we do.  It seems like ye have some<br/>
resentment against higher level players, for whatever reason, and that&#39;s<br/>
bleeding into your point of view.  I&#39;m not in the game 24/7, not even close<br/>
to it (excpet perhaps on the weekends, where I tend to play at between 12 to<br/>
14 hours, weeknights are about 4-7 hours a night).  I don&#39;t profess to<br/>
understand what you are speakign of when &quot;people complain about the<br/>
econonmy&quot;, but if two peeps are willing to come to an agreement to the<br/>
relative worth of an item...  then I&#39;d say the economy is workign just fine.<br/>
If you want to see a healthy economy in EQ in action, just attend the<br/>
bazaars that are held every saturday in the East Commonlands.<br/>
<br/>
Further, if all you can manage to do in further posts is present yourself in<br/>
a resentful and accusatory way, I think this discussion with you is pretty<br/>
much done.  If ye can&#39;t present your ideas without flaming anyone about<br/>
&quot;whining&quot; and telling us the solution is simply for us to stop playing,<br/>
perhaps it&#39;s best if this we all let this matter be.<br/>
