<div id="ygrps-yiv-1454894495"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Ok who is the brains behind this item??<br/>
&gt;I was looking through EQitems webpage and happened upon this item.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Aye, there are many items that happen along like the Polished Mithril<br/>
Torque.  I was hoping to obtain some Mithril arms while fighting Fire<br/>
Giants in SolB.  We bring down the proper mob that carries it, and I pray<br/>
that it has the arms.  It does, and I&#39;m given an option to loot it, and to<br/>
my horror clerics can&#39;t use it..  but Rogues can?!?<br/>
<br/>
Sheesh, needless to say i was disappointed, and confused.  If a cleric can<br/>
wear a Mithril Breastplate, why not let her wear the arms too?<br/>
