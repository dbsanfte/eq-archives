<div id="ygrps-yiv-1181868784">I would agree with this list for healing and Bind being #1 and 2, but after that I really don&#39;t agree...<br/>
I would take Smite as #3 becasue it can be used on any enemy, not just undead.  If you aren&#39;t soloing this isn&#39;t critical, but even when you aren&#39;t soloing it comes in very handy when something attacks you and you are alone, or when your group needs that last little bit of fire power to get them over the edge.    As clerics, we have a very long time in between DD spells.  The result of this is that they are very powerful for our level when we get them, but they suck bad by the time we get to have a new one.   When you first get Smite, it is really awsome agaisnt most monsters you are fighting, by the time you get to level 27, 28.. it&#39;s useless.  Then you get to level 29 and you et wrath.. it does 200 damage and again it&#39;s awsome... heh .  Until you get to level 43 that is...   So.. i&#39;d get smite as #3.  After that I&#39;d get expulse undead and invis-vs-undead... both really handy if you go someplace like befallen or unrest.  If money is your main concern, I would put symobol of Transal last.   The reason I say this is that the cats eye agates cost around 2gp each and thus it gets expensive to cast... and while it is nice, it&#39;s not the most important buff in the world.    I find the endure line mostly useless, though they have certain times they are nice and the same for Cancel Magic.. .only used it a few times in my life as a cleric so far (level 30).   <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s my 2 copper worth... Take it for what it&#39;s worth...  All this is IMHO of course =)<br/>

&gt; Bind Affinity<br/>
&gt; Expulse Undead<br/>

&gt; Endure line upgrades<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have found that the endure line are spells I rarely use.  As well, smite<br/>
&gt; is ok for solo&#39;ing, so if you solo, definite must have.  Cancel magic is<br/>
&gt; good in Beholder, for when those muddites blind you or a member.  Bind is a<br/>
&gt; must have, as now you don&#39;t have to trek across norrath to get your corpse<br/>
&gt; if you remember to use bind.  As well, people will pay about 1-2pp for a<br/>
&gt; bind.  I know, clerics shouldn&#39;t charge for services, blah blah blah.  But<br/>
&gt; it is a mana costly spell, so I will rarely give it out for free.<br/>

&gt; I too should be making 14 some time soon, and was wondering how much it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; going to cost to buy all the needed spells.  I&#39;ve got about 40 pp in the<br/>
&gt; bank, and am wearing all leather.  Will this be enough cash and what spells<br/>
&gt; should be purchased first?<br/>

&gt; I should be making 14 later this week and would like to know what spells are<br/>
&gt; best to get first.   As you all are aware money is a definite problem at<br/>
&gt; this level.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I had a wonderful week as far as donations to my equipment goes.  I was<br/>
&gt; given a banded tunic and a blackened neck guard plus getting rawhide gloves<br/>
&gt; from a zombie really helped.  A few lootings of ghouls has also helped my<br/>
&gt; bank account a lot.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am still having trouble finding groups at times but so far with only one<br/>
&gt; exception I have not lost a party member yet.  The only exception was an<br/>
&gt; ill-fated venture into Oasis when I was still 11th.  I really think that<br/>
&gt; upon making 14 I will head back to GFay.  I have nothing against Freeport<br/>
&gt; and EC but I think the humans are all jealous of us elves. (grins)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
