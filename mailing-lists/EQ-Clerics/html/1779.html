<div id="ygrps-yiv-2110832153">Hey Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I really would like to complete my Paw of Opalla, i TOTALLY lucked in to the first 3 rings, i camped Mitty for about an hour and she droped the gold and copper.  Picked the silver up in Blackburrow, and now all i need is the Platinum.  Therein lies the problem.<br/>
<br/>
I have heard many differing accounts of where to find Gynok Molter.  So, if you have SEEN him, not heard about him being somewhere, but ACTUALLY SEEN HIM with YOUR character, please let me know where.  Yes, i know Befallen, but where?  First floor in entrance area? Third floor near Elf Skeletons??  Please let me know any visual sightings. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
