<div id="ygrps-yiv-317434491">Personally if you are playing a caster just get a mixture. A bronze chest is<br/>
nice protection and no real +wis there early on, then get a few of the lower<br/>
+ wis items and have bronze whereever you can fill in but beware it is very<br/>
very heavy. At the end of the day as a caster you are trying to stay out of<br/>
combat I presume and med heal and then finish off. As long as you back off<br/>
enough you wont get hit too often and if the group you are with is any good<br/>
when they do get thrpough on you they get pulled off or else it might be<br/>
time for divine get the heck out after a quick heal or 2. I would mix both<br/>
if that is the case you will be wastin weight and possible mana + just to<br/>
have the full bronze. Besides which the other items will give you balance in<br/>
other areas. Just a thought and i am sure there are many others that will<br/>
differ.<br/>

&gt; Hail all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This question most likely has been asked already and I apologize if I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; repeating but I am new to the list and rather new to casting class in<br/>
&gt; general.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My question is, which is better, pure AC or stat enchancing armor?  I was<br/>
&gt; thinking of covering myself fully in bronze plate but there are things<br/>
 </span></blockquote>like<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; BS tunic, barb arms, silver plated bracers that I will be putting aside.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; am playing mostly a casting cleric...and I figured AC would save my life<br/>
&gt; more then any stat enhancing armor.  Any thoughts?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
