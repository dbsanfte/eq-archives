<div id="ygrps-yiv-1158781087">Hi,<br/>
 <br/>
I have never publically complained about EQ, but lately, the lag has<br/>
literally been killing me!<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve noticed, that the past week has been extraordinarily bad for lag. Sure,<br/>
I get lag now in then in the past, but the past week, the lag has been<br/>
unbearable.  Though the strange thing  is, my lag metre doesn&#39;t show any<br/>
lag.  I have experience the following problems:<br/>
 <br/>
1) Travelling:  When travelling, I get these pauses, where the whole screen<br/>
sort of &#39;stops&#39; every 10 - 15 seconds.  This makes long trips over zones<br/>
very annoying.<br/>
 <br/>
2) Fighting:  Two nites in a row now, I have been in Befallen, and had mobs<br/>
trained on me.  NOrmally, I can outrun them to safety.  But the past while,<br/>
the lag seems to prevent me from casting spells and hitting back.  However,<br/>
the mobs seem to do the same amount of dmg no matter what the lag situation<br/>
is.  I know you may think that I am just expressing sour grapes for dying,<br/>
but it isn&#39; t the case.  I have bee killed many times before, and rightly<br/>
so.  But the deaths lately, when related to lag, seem to give the mobs an<br/>
unfair advantage.<br/>
 <br/>
3)Item usage: Lag has prevented my door keys from working right away in<br/>
Befallen. I find I have to click things two or three times to get them to<br/>
work.  This applies to looting, selling, trading, and using items such as<br/>
keys.<br/>
 <br/>
Any ways, I just want to know if any of you have had any of these problems<br/>
of late.  I am really trying to figure out if this is a link related<br/>
problem, or if a recent patch affected playablility in this manner.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Chris.</div>
