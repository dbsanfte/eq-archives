    <br/>
    ok,  this may seem kinda moot to bring up....but has anyone found (next to in Plane of Fear) any CLERIC only items? <br/>
<br/>
    i bring this up because after going through EQlizer again...i find the: <br/>
<br/>
    Polished Mithril Torque <br/>
<br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    its got +13 int AND wis....and War, Pal, Rog, Brd, Shd, Rng and MNK can wear it.  That&#39;s it.  A Cleric cant wear a piece of armor a Ranger even could, and that a MONK can, which would give him his prime requiste, yet classes which shouldnt be touching this are. (Monk, how many wear anything with 4 weight?  not .4, but 4, when they cant really go above 14!!!)<br/>
<br/>
    Its lil things like this that really get to me about how Verant works.  Was just wondering how all you other clerics felt...and if you knew who we could posibly contact in Verant to maybe fix some of the lil oversites!!!!<br/>
<br/>
    Bann Sidhe <br/>

    lvl 24 cleric Fennin Ro</div>
