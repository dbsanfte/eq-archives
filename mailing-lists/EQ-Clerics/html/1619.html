<div id="ygrps-yiv-287893031">I have a level 14 druid and she hunted from 9 to just under 13 in <br/>
Steamfront.  Its not overly crowded and plenty of mobs to choose from.  If <br/>
you can get a group the Mino Cave is good as well. There is also a small <br/>
spawn point where some undead spawn, just be careful as the Mino Hero spawns <br/>
near there as well.<br/>
