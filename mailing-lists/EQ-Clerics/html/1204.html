<div id="ygrps-yiv-1387380634">I agree beggars spoil my enjoyment of the game. When you work hard for<br/>
something be it fighting or developing trades its annoying (to me) to have<br/>
someone bother me for free stuff. However I give lots of stuff away and<br/>
really enjoy buffing/healing characters lower than me that do not ask for<br/>
aid. Except when they are dying, I find that kind of asking for help very<br/>
sensible strategy.<br/>
<br/>
I once blinded a character (wiz) who was level 8 and begging me and<br/>
incessantly others. I was 11 at the time. I did it in character of course<br/>
which made me feel better about it.....<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Begone you worthless serpent until you see the light of<br/>
Tunare&quot;....BLIND....<br/>
<br/>
Wiz runs of screaming....&quot;I&#39;m being K&#39;d ....I&#39;m being PK&#39;d.....&quot;<br/>

Ahhh not sure how yall are going to react with this one, but I have some <br/>
very strong feelings on this issue. I believe they stem from me having <br/>
started playing way back when the game was first released.<br/>
<br/>
I despise Beggars....I have always been a helpful person, but the biggest <br/>
mistake you can make with me is to beg.<br/>
<br/>
I started out in this game with nothing just like the rest of you, Some <br/>
people call me bitter, which is not the case, i am a very happy player, i <br/>
enjoy this game quite a bit, but I have a sense of value for items, I <br/>
EARN(not by Buying or begging) ALL of my equipment, I have never asked <br/>
anyone for anything and never will. I wore Patchwork, yes patchwork leather <br/>
until I was lvl 20, yes 20, I remember having only 6gp and I bought a PW <br/>
tunic for 4, dropped the tunic and was SOL.  I was never able to buy all my <br/>
spells at early levels right when I was able to use them, i had to buy a few<br/>
<br/>
at a time, I used a hammer of wrath until I was lvl 20 and my husband had <br/>
given me a screaming Mace which I used up til I was high enough level to <br/>
kill the savant and get a black enamelled one.  I Appreciate all the items <br/>
that I have, I don&#39;t get items that I cannot use, I don&#39;t overcamp places to<br/>
<br/>
get mega quantities of items.  I don&#39;t buy items, money means nothing in <br/>
this game. There is nothing I hate more than to have a group with one caster<br/>
<br/>
who already has a SMR camping the Arch Magi.<br/>
I am begged on a daily basis and when Someone begs from me, they are damn <br/>
well not gonna get a copper from me. I am a generous person, I buff people <br/>
all the time and have given away many items that I have gotten replacements <br/>
for. i.e. I gave a black iron medallion to a low lvl druid I met in <br/>
Rivervale one day, we just chatted and he never asked for anything, I gave <br/>
it to him out of the kindness of my heart.  I guess basically i feel I <br/>
worked my butt off to get what I have and if you are begging from people you<br/>
<br/>
are not even trying to get things for yourself, makes me very ill.<br/>
Enough of my rant.<br/>
Can&#39;t wait to hear feedbacks on this one.<br/>

&gt;Hi all.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I gave seen this debate before in other places.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What do you all think of begging as a method of acquiring<br/>
&gt;cash/armour/weapons?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t mean the skill of begging, but I mean approaching other PC&#39;s and<br/>
&gt;asking them to spare a bit?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Now, I am for it.  I beleive that RP&#39;ing worlds parallel the real world, <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;inthe real world, there are those who are poor, and need to beg for thier<br/>
&gt;sustenance.  At the lower levels, I gained most of my armour and my money<br/>
&gt;from begging.  Now I do it in a RP&#39;ing context, and not as &#39;Hey, got any<br/>
&gt;free armour I can have?&#39;.  I think that this is a valid strategy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As well, now that I am entering the teens, I don&#39;t need to beg as often.<br/>
&gt;But I do barter with players, and when doing so, I subtly make them beleive<br/>
&gt;that I am a poor cleric (which I really am). In doing so, I have made some<br/>
&gt;great deals, and am able to get some good bargains on armour.  Last nite,<br/>
&gt;for instance, I bought a bloodforge hammer for 15 pp, and a FS staff.  From<br/>
&gt;what I could see, they usually went for around 30 pp.  In my opionion, its<br/>
&gt;no different than trading in ussed car and dressing down and making the<br/>
&gt;saleperson beleive you are poorer than you really are.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Any other thoughts?<br/>
