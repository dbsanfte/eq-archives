<b>Subject:</b> off-hand items for 1hblunt weapons <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1720181293">I use either the bloodforge hammer, or my SSOL and a Shiny Brass<br/>
Shield (you can get the SBS off the trainer in Crushbone).  It&#39;s<br/>
fairly difficult to get (mine was given to me), but you could probably<br/>
buy one.  It does weigh a fair bit, but gives +10 vs. magic.  Other<br/>
than a shield, I&#39;m not sure what you can hold in an off-hand.  Besides<br/>
a light source such as a lantern.  :)<br/>

&gt;Quick question...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am going away from the Bloodforge to the SSOL, so what is a good item<br/>
&gt;to hold along with the one handed weapon? I play a casting cleric so I<br/>
&gt;am almost maxed out on weight and thus I don&#39;t want a shield. I do not<br/>
&gt;want to hold the skull, or any other such evil item, since I am of<br/>
&gt;purely good alignment. I can&#39;t really think of anything else that a<br/>
&gt;level 16 can have. I have about a 100pp to buy the item if i can&#39;t go<br/>
&gt;get it myself, or with one of my groups. Any suggestions would be most<br/>
&gt;appreciated.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thank you!<br/>

&gt; &gt; Giving bone chips to Lushun Novashine works, but the<br/>
&gt; &gt; faction gained<br/>
&gt; &gt; is very slight.  The blessed oil quest, while slow<br/>
&gt; &gt; and tedious, is<br/>
&gt; &gt; free and does seem to raise it much more.<br/>
&gt; &gt;   There is also another quest, where you can kill<br/>
&gt; &gt; the monk standing<br/>
&gt; &gt; by the tree.  Occasionally, you&#39;ll see Estle<br/>
&gt; &gt; attacking him.  Forget<br/>
&gt; &gt; his name.  I never did kill him, but he is a traitor<br/>
&gt; &gt; to Rodcet and<br/>
&gt; &gt; converted to Bertoxxulous.  I suspect killing him<br/>
&gt; &gt; will raise faction<br/>
&gt; &gt; with priestoflife, too.<br/>
&gt; &gt;   Say to the priest (Aeston Wemore) &quot;I will be<br/>
&gt; &gt; traveling afar&quot; if he<br/>
&gt; &gt; says he can not trust you, or whatever, you can&#39;t do<br/>
&gt; &gt; it.  And you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; &gt; right, amiable is not good enough.  After I made<br/>
&gt; &gt; amiable I had to do<br/>
&gt; &gt; the blessed oil quest about 3 more times.  So,<br/>
&gt; &gt; somewhere between<br/>
&gt; &gt; amiable and warmly (or is it kindly?)<br/>
&gt; &gt;   The halflings name in Rivervale is Kizzie Montopp<br/>
&gt; &gt; and she is just<br/>
&gt; &gt; to the left, coming out of Fool&#39;s guild in an herb<br/>
&gt; &gt; shop.  I was<br/>
&gt; &gt; actually &#39;dubious&#39; to her, and despite her threats<br/>
&gt; &gt; of calling the<br/>
&gt; &gt; guards on me, she still gave me the honeyjum.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   Also, a quick note on the bloodforge hammer, you<br/>
&gt; &gt; do not have to<br/>
&gt; &gt; have done ANY quests for Byzar (is that his name?)<br/>
&gt; &gt; Bloodforge in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; warrior&#39;s guild in Kaladim.  I had never met the<br/>
&gt; &gt; guy, was amiable<br/>
&gt; &gt; anyway (because of killing so many Crushbone orcs)<br/>
&gt; &gt; and gave him<br/>
&gt; &gt; Trumpy&#39;s head, and he gave me the hammer.  It&#39;s a<br/>
&gt; &gt; dirt simple quest,<br/>
&gt; &gt; just kill one guy, give him the head.  It&#39;s just<br/>
&gt; &gt; that it&#39;s on the<br/>
&gt; &gt; other side of the world.  And the head is nodrop, I<br/>
&gt; &gt; believe, so you<br/>
&gt; &gt; have to do it yourself.<br/>
