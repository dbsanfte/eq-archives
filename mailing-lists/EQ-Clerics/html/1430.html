Bur for good ness sake just a nice weapon that is 1H would be nice with a +wis too, not that 2H are great beacuse i just wont relinquish m left hand for such a masive drop in wis I can do the estra damage with DD and 1 or 2 spells that the wepon does and save this to drop something at the death so to speak - all this having been said i do have a respectable 2H bash just in case, and from the Midnight mallet days when it just was a nice weapon to wield..<br/>

  thanx....I dont know....it sounds kinda of weak then....kind of like the 2h-blunt to me.  Not only are you giving up a ton of possible wis, but your getting a VERY slow attack method.  I&#39;m sorry....maybe a 1h warhammer, or something like a throwing hammer which returns....that&#39;d be nice.  Give clerics a chance to throw a DISTANCE weapon.  It wouldnt be hard to do, normal 3d rpgs do it all the time.  *sigh* </span></blockquote></div>
