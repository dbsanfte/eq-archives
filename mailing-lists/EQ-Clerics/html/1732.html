<div id="ygrps-yiv-721927346">It will be entered from Lavastorm, and is now on the test server.  This is<br/>
confirmed.  There was a previous message that all the new zones were to be<br/>
entered from Tox Forrest (I think Brad posted this).  Makes sense to have the<br/>
Temple of Solusek close to Solusek Eye, doesn&#39;t it?  hehe<br/>
<br/>
I hear that there will be a TON of class specific quests generated here (that&#39;s<br/>
posted on EQLizer now and some of the other news sites).  Hopefull a piece of<br/>
cleric only equipment is close at hand, then again- maybe not.<br/>
<br/>
**Rumor**<br/>
Also, the quest that starts in Kith Forrest is rumored to continue here.  In<br/>
this quest you can kill a ghoul messanger or trade an Ebony Blade for another<br/>
(somewhat less effective than the Ebony Blade) Ranger only sword.  It is rumored<br/>
that the continuation of this quest (of course it&#39;s ranger only- that&#39;s MY twink<br/>
- wink-) will give one nice sword and is advanced in this zone.</div>
