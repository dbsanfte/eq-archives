<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-732397739">I gave it a try (the begging taunt) when fighting seafury clopses in<br/>
OOT. Didnt work at all as far as taunting them off anyone. Heh, I even<br/>
walked around to other groups fighting and tried to beg their mobs too.<br/>
Got me a little cash but thats it... Was worth a shot though. <br/>
