<b>Subject:</b> Re: EQ - worse rpg ever? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-728027188">I agree with a lot that you said, I don&#39;t really RP tho.  I play just to<br/>
have fun, as I&#39;ve said a few times I do play to lvl but it&#39;s no big deal to<br/>
me when I get that next lvl.  It&#39;s taken me days to get a lvl and I didn&#39;t<br/>
throw a fit about it or anything.  Yes it is nice to see &quot;Welcome to Level<br/>
whatever&quot; but I do agree to many ppl are racing to get to that next lvl.<br/>
I&#39;ve told ppl that I know they should get away from EQ for a while, and this<br/>
is what I got &quot;But if I do all my friends will pass me up in lvls and I<br/>
won&#39;t be able to group with them anymore&quot;.  I understand how fun it can be<br/>
to have a friend and group with them all the time, but if they start to pass<br/>
you up in lvls then o well.  Just so I don&#39;t pass my friend up in lvls when<br/>
shes not on I mess with a new skill, one day I took swimming from 7 to 85,<br/>
another day I took Sense Heading from 4 to 95 yes I fought a little to, but<br/>
as you can see leveling isn&#39;t that big of a deal to me.  As I said before<br/>
once you hit lvl 50 then what?  Might as well take your time on your<br/>
character(s) and just have fun cause just playing to get that next lvl can<br/>
get old and boring fast.<br/>
I don&#39;t like camping that much but I understand tho that at times you have<br/>
to do it.  But of course some ppl camp way to much, they don&#39;t camp for a<br/>
little while they do it for most of the day.  As about kiting, last night in<br/>
South Karana that was the big talk.  Some ppl were saying kiting is<br/>
cheating, others said kiting is part of the game.  As to where I stand on<br/>
kiting is can hard to say, it might be part of the game, but as you are<br/>
casting SoW or using JBoots and casting a DoT on a monster that can&#39;t really<br/>
do much about it cause he can&#39;t keep up with you.  I don&#39;t really think it&#39;s<br/>
cheating, I guess kiting and camping are about the same for me, I&#39;d do it<br/>
once in a while if I could but I wouldn&#39;t do it all the time.<br/>
