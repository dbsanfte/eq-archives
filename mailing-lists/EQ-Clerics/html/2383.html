<div id="ygrps-yiv-2121234927">In order of importance, get these spells: (according to me, anyways)<br/>
<br/>
Healing<br/>
Bind Affinity<br/>
Expulse Undead<br/>
Symbol of Transal (need Cats Eye Agate as the reagant)<br/>
Smite<br/>
Cancel Magic<br/>
Invis to Undead<br/>
Endure line upgrades<br/>
<br/>
I have found that the endure line are spells I rarely use.  As well, smite<br/>
is ok for solo&#39;ing, so if you solo, definite must have.  Cancel magic is<br/>
good in Beholder, for when those muddites blind you or a member.  Bind is a<br/>
must have, as now you don&#39;t have to trek across norrath to get your corpse<br/>
if you remember to use bind.  As well, people will pay about 1-2pp for a<br/>
bind.  I know, clerics shouldn&#39;t charge for services, blah blah blah.  But<br/>
it is a mana costly spell, so I will rarely give it out for free.<br/>

I too should be making 14 some time soon, and was wondering how much it&#39;s<br/>
going to cost to buy all the needed spells.  I&#39;ve got about 40 pp in the<br/>
bank, and am wearing all leather.  Will this be enough cash and what spells<br/>
should be purchased first?<br/>

I should be making 14 later this week and would like to know what spells are<br/>
best to get first.   As you all are aware money is a definite problem at<br/>
this level.<br/>
<br/>
I had a wonderful week as far as donations to my equipment goes.  I was<br/>
given a banded tunic and a blackened neck guard plus getting rawhide gloves<br/>
from a zombie really helped.  A few lootings of ghouls has also helped my<br/>
bank account a lot.<br/>
<br/>
I am still having trouble finding groups at times but so far with only one<br/>
exception I have not lost a party member yet.  The only exception was an<br/>
ill-fated venture into Oasis when I was still 11th.  I really think that<br/>
upon making 14 I will head back to GFay.  I have nothing against Freeport<br/>
and EC but I think the humans are all jealous of us elves. (grins)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again all,<br/>
