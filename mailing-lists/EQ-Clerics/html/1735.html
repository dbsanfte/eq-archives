<b>Subject:</b> Re: Paw of Opalla and Desperate request for aid. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1038946504">My friend (level 50 druid)  who just got his Paw literally camped Mitty for<br/>
over 25 straight hours.  He said it took him 98 kills to get the gold ring.<br/>
He started camping her at 5am in the morning and got the gold ring about<br/>
6ish the following morning.<br/>
<br/>
And how can Verant think that by reducing the spawn drop they will help<br/>
solve camping problems.....&lt;sighs&gt;<br/>
