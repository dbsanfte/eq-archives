 <br/>
He was in Befallen, on the first level.  Just as you enter Befallen. I saw<br/>
him inthe open area just before the stairs going down to the 4 doors.  I<br/>
don&#39;t think he was trained up too far, as I can&#39;t imagine anyone being able<br/>
to run fromthe third level, thru two locked doors, with him on your tail. So<br/>
I would imagine that he spawned relatively close to the point where I saw<br/>
him.  BUt that is just conjecture, and you wanted facts. So the fact is, I<br/>
saw him on the first level, at the top of the very first set of stairs.<br/>

<br/>
Hey Everyone,<br/>
 <br/>
I really would like to complete my Paw of Opalla, i TOTALLY lucked in to the<br/>
first 3 rings, i camped Mitty for about an hour and she droped the gold and<br/>
copper.  Picked the silver up in Blackburrow, and now all i need is the<br/>
Platinum.  Therein lies the problem.<br/>
 <br/>
I have heard many differing accounts of where to find Gynok Molter.  So, if<br/>
you have SEEN him, not heard about him being somewhere, but ACTUALLY SEEN<br/>
HIM with YOUR character, please let me know where.  Yes, i know Befallen,<br/>
but where?  First floor in entrance area? Third floor near Elf Skeletons??<br/>
Please let me know any visual sightings. <br/>
 <br/>
Thanks,<br/>
