<b>Subject:</b> New Cleric Armor- SPOILERS <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-373437409">Greetings!<br/>
<br/>
Since being a cleric for a LONG time, and having seen the new quests go in,<br/>
I thought I would say a few things.<br/>
<br/>
The new cleric armor is for 25-35 lvl clerics to go do something and expand<br/>
the breadth of quests for these levels.<br/>
<br/>
Since these quests are turning into more complex series of events (and if<br/>
they were easy we would still complain), please try to give locations of<br/>
said monsters and as much detail as you can. Thanks<br/>
<br/>
So lets get to it:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
SPOILER<br/>
<br/>

Turgan the Reliant is in Lake Rathetear, from gnoll camp go east, first<br/>
house on the left.<br/>
PROBLEM: You need whatever it is from the hut in Kithicor before he will<br/>
talk to you.<br/>
you can ask him &quot;What is...(Turgan the Reliant, icon of the reliant, ingot<br/>
of the reliant)&quot;<br/>
and he comes back with, &quot; How do you know about.....I don&#39;t know what you<br/>
are talking about. Go back to Kithicor!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My thinking is that the Shadowed men in Kithicor has it (a 25th +- monster),<br/>
and we will find &quot;something.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Lianna Ferasa (the gypsy woman of Rathe Mtns, she is in gypsy camp by the<br/>
lake entrance) sends you to North Karana to kill Zahal the Vile, and return<br/>
her flute to her. Zahal is in the &quot;tree line in the east part of north<br/>
karana&quot;<br/>
<br/>
All creatures seem to have a common drop item (albeit pretty cool ala the<br/>
reed belt, Zahal dropa a SK belt), AND then a not so common Icon or Ingot<br/>
drop.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
hope this helps,<br/>
<br/>
