<div id="ygrps-yiv-838854170">I&#39;ve got a level 49 bard friend who gets so sick of being begged for things<br/>
that when someone runs by. Says hi, and then continues, she&#39;s been known to<br/>
unload fine steel loot, and all her gold, silver and copper on the person<br/>
(platinum if she&#39;s on the way out) Just to say THANK YOU for not asking for<br/>
anything.<br/>
<br/>
If someone asks her for help finding a corpse, she&#39;ll do that.<br/>
Just about anything else will get you a cold shoulder. ESP asking for things<br/>
that you should be out killing bats and decaying skeletons to work your way<br/>
up to.<br/>
<br/>
For myself, when I have things to get rid of, I go out into a newbie area<br/>
and find someone actually killing monsters. Faerain helps those who help<br/>
themself.<br/>

&gt;I don&#39;t have the rest of the messages for this thread, but if you are<br/>
&gt;referring to asking people for items, cash, etc.... Rule number<br/>
&gt;one is don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;do it.  I never ever respond to someone who asks me for things, I dislike<br/>
&gt;beggars.  I will gladly help another who merely just chats with<br/>
&gt;me, if I get<br/>
&gt;to talking with someone.  I will offer all kinds of information<br/>
&gt;and advise,<br/>
&gt;as well as giving items and cash.  But never never if they ask for it. </span></blockquote></div>
