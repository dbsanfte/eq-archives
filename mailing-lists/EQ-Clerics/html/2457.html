If I were you, I wouldn&#39;t limit my character choices<br/>
to those that can start in Freeport.  I find it much<br/>
more important to find a char that I would like to<br/>
play than worry about starting area!<br/>
<br/>
Its actually not too bad to make the &quot;Naked run&quot; when<br/>
you&#39;re low level.  No exp loss if you die, you just<br/>
have to start over again.  My friend&#39;s done it<br/>
numerous times at level 3 (as he *tried* to figure out<br/>
what he wanted to be...sigh) and as far as I know,<br/>
he&#39;s never even died.<br/>
<br/>
Just put all stuff in the bank and stick to zone edges<br/>
and watch where you run.  If you can get SoW or invis,<br/>
that&#39;s great, but you don&#39;t want to become too<br/>
dependant on it.  Some of the casters get Invis at<br/>
shockingly low levels, so that might be a &quot;travel<br/>
point,&quot; too.<br/>
<br/>
The only super tough parts from Qeynos/Erudin/Halas<br/>
are either RunnyEye or Highpass (and BB if you chose a<br/>
Barbarian).  I would go RunnyEye over Highpass unless<br/>
you know that the Gnolls and Orcs are camped (which<br/>
they probably arent&#39; on test).  For Feydarkians, its<br/>
really no problem at all to get to Freeport.<br/>
<br/>
Its not easy, but its doable and personally, it would<br/>
be more important to me to play what I want then start<br/>
with everyone...<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 cents...<br/>

&gt; Bree, I would LOVE to join you guys on test.  What<br/>
&gt; are your names? I need to<br/>
&gt; decide what kind of character to make.  That is a<br/>
&gt; good combo, BTW...a bard,<br/>
&gt; cleric and monk.  Gotta figure out what class/race<br/>
&gt; combo that is good can<br/>
&gt; start in Freeport, since I know I&#39;d never get a<br/>
&gt; teleport or bind if I was<br/>
&gt; born in like Erudin or Kelethin.<br/>
