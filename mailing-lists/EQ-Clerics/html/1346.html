<div id="ygrps-yiv-929381270">Its possible that SoW changed as part of the kiting changes.  The reasoning<br/>
may be that extremely high red mobs need to be kited for a longer time<br/>
(wouldn&#39;t know, not played a druid).  Hence, the duration of SoW was<br/>
lowered. Kiting is still possible, but now the druid or shaman will need to<br/>
cast it more often. This may discourage them or make them think twice about<br/>
kiting a mob that is way out of their league.<br/>

Thanks for sending it, as I said I did not see it yet, I agree it doesn&#39;t <br/>
appear to say anything about the buffs being changed, but I spoke to another<br/>
<br/>
cleric and a ranger who are high level and the rangers SoW which used to <br/>
last 25 minutes  was only lasting for 10 minutes now and the cleric stated <br/>
&quot;he was wondering why everyone kept asking for resolution so often&quot;<br/>
So, i haven&#39;t seen this first hand just going on what I was told.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I may be wrong, but I don&#39;t see any mention of any cleric spell or buff<br/>
&gt;change. Nor do I see any SoW change.<br/>
