<div id="ygrps-yiv-1354954506">You can fish while you meditate?  Really?  I&#39;ll have to try that.  I<br/>
had been fishing while at the same time trying to raise my divination<br/>
skill, since I finally get a useful div spell - invis to undead, next<br/>
level.<br/>
<br/>
While I&#39;m at it, here&#39;s a good newbie tip :<br/>
the skill of divination, for all clerics levels 13 and below have no<br/>
really useful spells that use this skill.  The only two are flash of<br/>
light and sense magic.  When you get to 14th level and finally get<br/>
invisibility to undead - a useful divination spell, your divination<br/>
skill is liable to be in the single-digits.  Can you say &quot;fizzle,<br/>
fizzle, fizzle&quot;?  So, do what I just did, and put an item on your<br/>
cursor, and cast sense magic, over and over and over again.  It will<br/>
go up.  Before that, I tried casting flash of light on myself and then<br/>
cure blindness, but that took forever!  You can also cast flash of<br/>
light on another player, and it won&#39;t affect them.  Either of these<br/>
tricks will work, but the sense magic thing is much easier and<br/>
quicker.  I finally maxed mine at 70, so I&#39;m ready to go for my next<br/>
level!<br/>

&gt;Actually i fish while i train my spellcasting skills. And my fishing<br/>
&gt;skill is 184 ;) It takes a heck of a long time to build up the skills<br/>
&gt;at higher levels. And i only build up the skills that are not used<br/>
&gt;as much. And besides, you can fish while you meditate ;).<br/>
