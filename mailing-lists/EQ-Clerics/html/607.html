<div id="ygrps-yiv-2110414294">Hail Fellow Everquesters,<br/>
I am looking into creating a Dark Elf Cleric. Besides the obvious problems,<br/>
lack of merchants, KOS, etc., are there any other pros or cons that I need<br/>
to know about? Statistically, the Dark Elf looks good to me, except CHA.<br/>
What I like the most is the RP&#39;ing side of it. A Priest of Darkness, Hate<br/>
and Despair just sounds too cool. Any tips for a beginning Cleric would also<br/>
be appreciated.</div>
