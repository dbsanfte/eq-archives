<div id="ygrps-yiv-534303056">personally....i would say they should get credit for the exp they&#39;ve gained<br/>
after.  if it changes color it sounds like its going through making it<br/>
harder each time for the exp to gain....which is exactly what happens to us<br/>
in lvls....so its fair if they jumped to 53 or 60 etc.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
And just for your knowledge....i used to play a few muds....on one...called<br/>
MajorMud, when this same problem came up.....people didnt shoot up ten<br/>
lvls....they shot up about 2 maybe 3....and this was after MONTHS of work.<br/>
They made sure it didnt happen, because an extreme unbalance can happen.<br/>

To answer at least one of those yes they keep gaining exp after the hit Lvl<br/>
50.  Thats what got ppl wondering on what will happen once the pak is<br/>
released, cause they keep getting exp and they wonder whats gonna happen<br/>
with that exp.  As for what happens to the bar onces its filled, ask a Lvl<br/>
50 we have at least two on this list.  I think I heard once it&#39;s filled it<br/>
changes colors or something.<br/>

isnt this a bit....ridiculous?  First off....are they EVEN GAINING EXP after<br/>
50?  and if so....its damn hard enough....killing drags etc.  Not to<br/>
mention....whathappens when the bar fills completely?  does it restart?<br/>
Unless you can answer me.....please....dont write this kinda philisophical<br/>
crap.<br/>
