<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-560125040">I couldn&#39;t agree more on the money issue, I mean, how many of these so-called &#39;merchants&#39; on Norrath wouldn&#39;t go out of business in about a week? The only products generally bought are trade components and food. The ONLY person I have EVER seen in full steel plate was lvl 2 and doing it for a laugh! Plus, no-one sells to them because they pay you pittance (3plat for a Deepwater Harpoon? LOL). This is why the economy is screwed, if the merchants paid a decent amount for stuff and sold it at affordable (don&#39;t read CHEAP) prices, we wouldn&#39;t see so many people running around in full bronze because its cheaper than chain, because the price of bronze player sold would rise in proportion to the merchants buying price see? Hmm, should I sell to player for 10plat or merchant for 20? Gee let me think! This wouldn&#39;t solve the economy problem, but it might help some.<br/>
Just my 2cp, skint after looking at a steel bp :)<br/>

&gt;Money could be made valuable again. The merchant in solA that sells<br/>
&gt;tinkerers bags for 5kilo plat needs to do a couple things.<br/>
&gt;1. reduce the cost of the bag 3kilo plat seems more reasonable. (see<br/>
&gt;below why you would want to reduce the cost)<br/>
&gt;2. start selling Rubicite, make it fairly expensive I guess around<br/>
&gt;150-200pp per ac would be fair.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Verdant armour should be for sale in erudin (at the moment the merchant<br/>
&gt;will only sell to GM&#39;s as I understand it).<br/>
&gt;Black iron for sale in kaladim.<br/>
&gt;Add some more store bought armour types.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Add some more smithed & taylored armours (ie. add a vial of some sought<br/>
&gt;of mana from an enchanter, and some component and get some magic/bonus)<br/>
&gt;eg. imagine a ruby encrusted silvered/cromed/guilded/shiny breastplate<br/>
&gt;AC17 +?str/wis   (sure it would probably cost alot in components and<br/>
&gt;would very hard to smith, ie failures so even more expensive) ie. U<br/>
&gt;might combine a ruby, the vial, 2 sheets of steel, a mold, a flask of<br/>
&gt;water, a bar of enchanted silver/gold/electrum/platnium and a file.<br/>
&gt;Maybe introduce a spell &quot;Bless water&quot; make it so you need to get a flask<br/>
&gt;of &quot;holy water&quot; (that way no single class can singly corner the market<br/>
&gt;eg. enchanters).<br/>
&gt;Or maybe make it a 2 step process make first step might be to make gem<br/>
&gt;encrusted sheets<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Now as far as magic weapons go.<br/>
&gt;Add some pirate merchants in OOT, or the dwarven merchant in OOT or DE<br/>
&gt;in Neriak or a few all over the place. Lets add some more store bought<br/>
&gt;Magic weapons at the mo there is Combine and well balanced. Now if there<br/>
&gt;was more variety in store bought magic weapons, people wouldn&#39;t feel the<br/>
&gt;need to camp for a magic item. Item drops might become more the by<br/>
&gt;product of going into a dungeon, not the reason for going there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also the price of steel plate needs to be reduced.<br/>
&gt;Basically if something is too expensive people will not buy it, think<br/>
&gt;about it if a twinker can spend a few hours and get a really decent<br/>
&gt;item, or spend a few hours to get enuf cash to buy an inferior item<br/>
&gt;which will they do. Chain is also too expensive. (imo chain should be<br/>
&gt;twice to 3 times the price of leather, and plate 2 to 4 times the price<br/>
&gt;of chain).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;ouch, I ranted ... sorry<br/>
