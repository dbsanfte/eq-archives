<br/>
After camping that island for about 20 hours over two days an no sign of<br/>
Gull....success!  Well, kinda......<br/>
<br/>
I had given up and my ogre shaman buddy and I had left the island empty<br/>
handed after killing at least 300 aviaks over two days.  We hit Dagnor&#39;s to<br/>
get a cauldron shell from a goblin tidal lord which took only 30 minutes (at<br/>
least shaman get XP while questing, feh).  My ogre friend caught the boat<br/>
bought back to Freeport to get his second totemic bracer and I hit Kaladim<br/>
to get some Tumpy Tonics in preparation for SOME DAY finishing the arms<br/>
quest.  I got on the boat to head back to Freeport but decided to hop off<br/>
and swim back to aviak island by myself for one last look.<br/>
<br/>
I found several folks there (druid and ranger) merrily killing aviaks for XP<br/>
and no faction hit.  I buffed them and we chatted for a bit, they told me<br/>
that Gull must be a myth.  They had been there off and on for two weeks and<br/>
not seen him, and knew several high level clerics that had camped the island<br/>
for 3-4 days with no sign of Gull.  I got rather discouraged at that point<br/>
and decided that the Gull spawn must be broken and hoped it would be fixed<br/>
in the patch on Wednesday.<br/>
<br/>
I was bound on Errolisi island, so I gated and took the LONG round trip back<br/>
to Freeport.  As I was running from Freeport to HH Pass to find Jovan with<br/>
my Tumpy Tonics to do the other part of the arms quest, the druid on aviak<br/>
island sent me a tell and said that Gull had just spawned.  I begged him to<br/>
leave the ingot if it dropped, and gated back to Errolisi island (luckily I<br/>
forgot to bind myself when I got back to Freeport).  After paying a troll<br/>
shaman (who was killing NPCs on Errolisi island) for SOW and a levitate I<br/>
ran over to aviak island.  The druid and ranger had to kill Gull because he<br/>
attacked them while they were fighting a quetzel, but Gull dropped the ingot<br/>
and they left it for me.  Gull apparently is around 25th level.<br/>
<br/>
So Gull is not a myth, but a VERY RARE spawn.  Hope this help you folks out,<br/>
I consider myself EXTREMELY lucky to get that ingot.  It was very late at<br/>
this point and after ANOTHER long round trip boat ride I could not find<br/>
Jovan in HH keep so I camped, hopefully I get my arms tonight.<br/>
<br/>
Now where is that gnome necro Babbin-whatever.......<br/>

&gt; The birds con low green to me (starlings/turacos/tanagers) with the<br/>
&gt; occasional blue quetzel.  I only get XP for about 1 in 40 birds I kill, I<br/>
am<br/>
&gt; 30th level.  I&#39;m guessing Gull is a rare spawn because a friend and I<br/>
killed<br/>
&gt; every d#$% bird on the island and Gull did not show up.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Oh well, I&#39;ll try just killing the roamers and leave the birds in the<br/>
&gt; towers, camps, and diving boards alone.  I&#39;ve been having to destroy<br/>
copper<br/>
&gt; and silver to keep from getting encumbered, what a pain.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I hear that his placeholder is one of the ones that roams the island. So<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; &gt; guess kill all the roamers. BTW, what do all the birds /con to you, I am<br/>
&gt; &gt; probably going there this week.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hey folks,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; After getting my Boots of the Reliant (boy does my butt hurt from<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; StumpWatch&#39;99 and CabinWatch&#39;99) I&#39;m going for the arms now.  I&#39;m on<br/>
&gt; aviak<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; island looking for the named aviak Gull, but haven&#39;t found him after<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; killing<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; MANY starlings, turacos, quetzels, and tanagers (sp?).<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Any clues on how often he spawns or trick to get him to spawn?<br/>
