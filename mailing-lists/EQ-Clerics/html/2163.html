<div id="ygrps-yiv-593742830">At level 10, I was soloing at the Undead Ruins in BB.  If the zone is as empty as you say,<br/>
you can level rather quickly by beating up on the dwarf skeletons there, collecting <br/>
their bones and taking them to the Paladin guild for more xp and loot.  This is better <br/>
than the tower because none of the mobs are linked.  Also, if you <br/>
are able to find a tank to group with, the Goblin Warrior camp is good xp at your level<br/>
if the chessboard is camped.<br/>

I also seem to have this trouble finding a group even though I will heal<br/>
anyone that I see hurt whether in combat or just resting.    I think it is<br/>
mainly my level though on my part.  It seems to me that most people wish to<br/>
solo yet at 10th - 12th level.   I am really getting very discouraged as I<br/>
have been level 10 for weeks now.  It seems that every time I get a bar of<br/>
exp I die a couple of times and lose it.<br/>
<br/>
I hunt normally either in ButcherBlock or around the entrance to CrushBone.<br/>
It seems that BB is mostly deserted when I am around and there is nothing<br/>
for me to hunt there.  I have hunted the Chess Board a couple of times when<br/>
I was able to find a group.   The orcs around the CB entrance are either low<br/>
green (no exp) or else there are 3 or more at once on me and that is death<br/>
for sure.<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions would be appreciated.<br/>
