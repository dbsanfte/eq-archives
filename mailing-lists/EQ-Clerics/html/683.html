&gt; Realm.  The Realm at first was a big game, but over time ppl got tired of<br/>
 </span></blockquote>it<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and they quit playing where is the Realm now?  It might still be there but<br/>
&gt; how often is it updated, how many ppl are on there now to play with or<br/>
&gt; against?  I like EQ about as much as the next person, but I have a feeling<br/>
&gt; we won&#39;t see it around or as big as it is now for I&#39;d say 2-3 more years,<br/>
&gt; with games such as Middle-Earth, Asherions Call and I&#39;ve heard of one more<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If you played Realm then you would know better then to even think for one<br/>
minute that with Stephen involved in Middle Earth - it&#39;s not going to be<br/>
anything but a mess.  I don&#39;t think he could program his way out of a paper<br/>
bag! And I for one will NEVER buy a game that he is involved in.<br/>
Been there, done that! lol<br/>
<br/>
People left Realm to come here for the most part, Sierra is in trouble -<br/>
Middle Earth is not being worked on at this time and it will be years before<br/>
it comes out if ever. It would not surprise me to see somewhere down the<br/>
road that Sierra sells the rights to it.<br/>
<br/>
Its the same with everything in life, things change and in the computer<br/>
industry they improve at an alarming rate. On a Monday you can buy a state<br/>
of the art CD Rom and by Friday something better has come out.<br/>
<br/>
I mean 2-3 years for a game is a very long time. I love EQ just as much as<br/>
the next person (for now-hehe) but that won&#39;t stop me from looking around<br/>
when something better comes out :)</div>
