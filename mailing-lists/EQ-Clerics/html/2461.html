<div id="ygrps-yiv-1752368623">My Name is Laurelei ( Bree wasn&#39;t available)<br/>
Our Monk is Beph and our Bard is Ashwind<br/>
Ya know I was contemplating myself about making a character outside of <br/>
freeport but I too was worried about making it to my friends, I already have <br/>
a lvl 2 druid on test(in GFay) and I thought her abilities would be more <br/>
beneficial at higher level and I am still debating on whether perhaps I <br/>
should just play her or not, but my first love has always been my cleric.<br/>
I have also recently taken a liking to Magicians, I have a lvl 7 on fennin. <br/>
I have tried many classes and races out and I always come back to my cleric, <br/>
2nd my druid(lvl 20 on Fennin) and I think Mages come in 3rd for me.<br/>
I have tried out Wizards, Necros, Monks, Warriors, Rogues, Shamans.  It is <br/>
really hard for me to play a class that can&#39;t heal themselves, to have to <br/>
depend on others all the time would really bother me.<br/>
<br/>
On the other Remarks on Test....I understand it is more &quot;buggy&quot; so to speak <br/>
than the regular server and there is really no support(not that GMs have <br/>
done much to support me ever anyway).  Last night we were disconned 3 times <br/>
without warning and it was a pain, we did not lose any items, we really <br/>
don&#39;t have anything yet anyway.  but I know it must be frustrating having <br/>
that happen when you have items of worth that you have worked hard for.<br/>
We had a server crash on Fennin when I was like lvl 24 or so a friend of our <br/>
was a lvl 24 monk ( Valgamon) he died in the Ogre Shaman camp in West <br/>
Karana, when we came back everyone got their bodies and his was no where to <br/>
be found.  GMs would not replace his items, they were gonna give him a <br/>
reimbursement pack(leather armor for a monk??) and none of his magical <br/>
items. Hence he quit EQ never to return.  So, my point being i never count <br/>
on anything from the GMs, so test won&#39;t be much different than the way I <br/>
would regularly play on Fennin.<br/>
