&gt; Hi all.  I decided this would be a good place to put this, since everyone has<br/>
&gt; good input on our class, while others refuse to help one another, I dunno.<br/>
&gt; Basically I currently play on veeshan server, and for months have been fed up<br/>
&gt; with it.  Now I&#39;ve heard other ppl say (and could be rumors) that there is less<br/>
&gt; ks&#39;ing on other servers, as well as not a dominate god guild like foh on the<br/>
&gt; server.  (to Those of you possibly in FOH on this list, no offense, the group of<br/>
&gt; friends I play with (UWS) as well as I have had bad run ins with your guild.<br/>
&gt; Basically FoH and UWS has gone there...let&#39;s not do it again in here)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So basically my question to you is the server you play on how do you like it?<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m seriously considereing abandoning all my characters on Veeshan to play on a<br/>
&gt; better server.  This game is all about the playability in the environment, which<br/>
&gt; veeshan seriously limits those not powerhungry play the game.<br/>
