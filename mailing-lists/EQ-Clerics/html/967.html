<div id="ygrps-yiv-4957908">uhm, well, considering that minor healing only heals 10hp at a time, and<br/>
you WERE on level 2, &lt;what level warrior were you trying to heal? and<br/>
remember warriors have a good bit of hp&gt; did you have any mana adding<br/>
items? there&#39;s always things to get you more mana...mana adding items<br/>
till around 20 or so, and then wis adding items.....<br/>
