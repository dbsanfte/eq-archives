<div id="ygrps-yiv-261027274">I recently started a Clerical character after having played the warrior class for some time and have enjoyed it.  I&#39;ve been noticing web pages dedicated specifically to other classes, i.e. shamans, enchanters, druids, but have not found any for Clerics.  Anyone know of any good websites out there dedicated specifically to the Clerical class?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks if advance.<br/>
