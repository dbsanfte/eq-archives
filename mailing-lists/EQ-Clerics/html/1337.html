&gt; &gt; Well.. i know with today&#39;s patch this is now an<br/>
&gt; item that you can put in your <br/>
&gt; &gt; left hand slot, and yeilds +10 mana and +10<br/>
&gt; wisdom.. a necessity for any <br/>
&gt; &gt; cleric... but its also lore and no drop... and I<br/>
&gt; am a DE cleric... I know the <br/>
&gt; &gt; quest starts in Erudin and also takes place in i<br/>
&gt; think qeynos and HH, but <br/>
&gt; &gt; does anyone know a way in which i might be able to<br/>
&gt; obtain this valuable item? <br/>
&gt; &gt;  Especially since DE clerics get zero quests...<br/>
&gt; and casters get that stein <br/>
&gt; &gt; thing that isn&#39;t no drop... i guess i&#39;ll have to<br/>
&gt; yell at some GMs for that <br/>
&gt; &gt; one.... anyone who can give a more detailed<br/>
&gt; spoiler or a way to increase <br/>
&gt; &gt; faction with only the npcs who are abosolutly<br/>
&gt; necessary for the quest would <br/>
&gt; &gt; be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance for the<br/>
&gt; info.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Actually, don&#39;t worry too much; they&#39;ve taken out<br/>
&gt; the corrupt Qeynos<br/>
&gt; Guard you need to kill, and Moodoro Finharn doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; give the Jester card<br/>
&gt; anymore ... he gives the faction, he talks as if<br/>
&gt; he&#39;s given you a card,<br/>
&gt; but there&#39;s no card given.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Dammit.  ANd I HAD a testament, but destroyed it<br/>
&gt; since they made it<br/>
&gt; NoDrop while it was in the bank and once I took it<br/>
&gt; back into my<br/>
&gt; possession, I couldn&#39;t put it back.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>As for being a DE, you will have to get your faction with the priests<br/>
of life in Queynos up to strong amiable. This is difficult since gnolls<br/>
do not change this faction. It would be a lot easier just buy the<br/>
weapon. <br/>
<br/>
I was so happy to see the testament working last night. I now run<br/>
around with ssol and the testament. If they actually took out the guard<br/>
and the cards, then I have a fairly unique item. :)<br/>
