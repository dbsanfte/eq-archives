<div id="ygrps-yiv-1593720364">It&#39;s actually an exact 7 hour spawn.  I spent the 7 hours there from the<br/>
previous time he was killed (I managed to get there right when it happened).<br/>
I teamed up with a lv 30 shadowknight who wanted the other piece of paper<br/>
(not the page, some note) from Dyllin Starshine.  He managed to hit<br/>
Starshine with one spell and was instantly down for the count.  At very<br/>
least I&#39;d have somebody with you who can cast see invis, so you can tell if<br/>
some wizard or druid is going to come in & KS, you can at least let &#39;em know<br/>
that you know they&#39;re there (cast cancel magic on &#39;em repeatedly, see how<br/>
aggravated they get with ya  ^_^ ).<br/>

&gt; I have heard that he is a 6-hour spawn.  He spawns in the open area<br/>
&gt; near the smugglers, in a little tent-thingy against the wall.<br/>
