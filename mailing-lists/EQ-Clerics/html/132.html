<div id="ygrps-yiv-1831392222">I have a 5th level HIE cleric and I recently purchased divine aura<br/>
(the requirements being 5th level) and I scribed it ok, but when I <br/>
memorize it, it never fully shows up in the slot.  It just remains<br/>
kinda gray, and if I click on it it says I haven&#39;t recovered yet.<br/>
What does that mean?  And why can&#39;t I memorize it?<br/>

&gt;As coot pointed out, you will constantly need to mem new spells<br/>
&gt;depending on what you are fighting.  However, I always keep my best<br/>
&gt;hp/ac buff in (center right now seeing as i&#39;m only lvl 17), root, divine<br/>
&gt;aura, and a heal spell.  The others vary on what i&#39;m fighting and<br/>
&gt;whether or not i&#39;m grouped or solo. </span></blockquote></div>
