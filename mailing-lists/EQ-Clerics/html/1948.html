Well I&#39;m a level 26 Dwarven Cleric on Quellious.<br/>
<br/>
Currently I run a couple of regular groups in the Unrest area (these are the <br/>
levels that will tell who to group with regularly in higher levels...if they <br/>
stay with the character)...<br/>
<br/>
I had an incident last night where our 25th level monk got beaten into the <br/>
ground.  I was medding nearby and someone trained a skeletal monk onto him.  <br/>
Unfortunately I was completely OOM, and he was at 2 bubbles of health when <br/>
the Skel attacked....<br/>
<br/>
Well he died, I did not...He was sorta pissed off and demanded to know why I <br/>
didn&#39;t help...I told him that I was completely OOM and did not have enough <br/>
to help...He replied &#39;Well you have a mace in your hand&#39;..<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the clincher....I said &quot;Would you rather I heal 100-150 points of <br/>
your health by quickly meditating...or inflict 30 points of damage on the <br/>
skeletal monk?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say he apologized...he realizes that I am a good cleric..I like <br/>
what I do...I&#39;m proud to say that I almost NEVER get the HEAL scream from <br/>
tanks that are fighting...because they trust me (unless its a new addition <br/>
to the party, and they quickly learn)..I have my tanks down to a single <br/>
bubble, and the cry never comes out...I do my job well, and usually have a <br/>
waiting list of people to get into the party.<br/>
<br/>
If you are concerned about being able to fight and not meditating so <br/>
often..I reccomend a shadowKnight or Paladin...Sub classes of necro and <br/>
Cleric...you&#39;ll fight more often...have less mana to recover and inflict <br/>
damage with wards and such...<br/>
<br/>
I still do engage in combat...genearlly not by swinging a weapon though..if <br/>
someone pulls heavily, I&#39;m cancelling the damage shields on the drybones <br/>
(they fry my monks), and dismissing as I can..I almost never use DD <br/>
spells....As in the current zone (90% of the creatures being undead), its <br/>
kinda useless...<br/>
<br/>
Its the wizards job to fry them. Its the tanks job to carve and bash them.<br/>
<br/>
Its my job to keep them doing their job.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;      I totally agree that melee at high levels is useless. You may be able<br/>
&gt;      to get a decent weapon but when you only hit once every 10 swings the<br/>
&gt;      damage doesn&#39;t add up very fast.  When I&#39;m in a group it&#39;s strictly<br/>
&gt;      med and heal with maybe the odd stun thrown in.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      As far as soloing goes, It can be done by a cleric fairly easily once<br/>
&gt;      you hit L44 (power level for clerics imo).  I pretty much soloed from<br/>
&gt;      47 to 50 by fighting spectres in oasis and oot as well as a few other<br/>
&gt;      npc&#39;s.  I personally have no trouble pulling spectres single, have<br/>
&gt;      never fought them in feerott though.  Experience had really started <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;      slow down from the dungeons and soloing was a nice change from the<br/>
&gt;      med/heal routine.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      As far as mana goes, my base wisdom is 105 and I am currently at 170<br/>
&gt;      and should be able to get it to 190 before to long (still need a <br/>
&gt;paw).<br/>
&gt;       I can take out 2 spectres solo before I need to med and haven&#39;t had<br/>
&gt;      much problems with mana when grouped.<br/>

&gt;Hate to discourage you, but at higher levels, you will melee VERY little.<br/>
&gt;Your value is healing and buffing.  And the damage you will be able to do<br/>
&gt;against high level mobs is very minimal.  You will be fighting mobs with<br/>
&gt;1000s of hps at high levels, and a lot of them have very high magic<br/>
&gt;resistance, so your spells are useless cause they are resisted most always.<br/>
&gt;And these mobs hit HARD...some for over 100 hps damage a pop.  You can&#39;t<br/>
&gt;survive at melee with these mobs, only the big tanks can.  You serve one<br/>
&gt;purpose mainly, and that is healing to keep everyone alive. Regarding <br/>
&gt;undead,<br/>
&gt;  clerics used to be able to solo specs quite easily with undead spells, <br/>
&gt;but<br/>
&gt;they changed the pathing of them at the spec cave in Feerott and now it&#39;s<br/>
&gt;dangerous cause you can&#39;t really pull them solo anymore.  You pull one and<br/>
&gt;two or three come, and that&#39;s BAD news.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Regarding the mana issue....you will need to get your hands on as many<br/>
&gt;wisdom enhancing items as you can, because you will need all the mana you<br/>
&gt;can get to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of your healing <br/>
&gt;powers.<br/>
&gt;The more mana you have the longer you can keep your group alive and the <br/>
&gt;less<br/>
&gt;med time you have.  So start amassing those wisdom items and try to get <br/>
&gt;your<br/>
&gt;wisdom at least up into the 170s minimum.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sorry to disillusion you, but high levels clerics are relegated mostly to<br/>
&gt;healing and buffing and medding.  That&#39;s what your specialty is and at <br/>
&gt;those<br/>
&gt;levels, the other healing classes can&#39;t come close to our healing powers<br/>
&gt;with our superior and complete heal.  The good news is that no high level<br/>
&gt;group ventures anywhere without at least one good cleric.  YOu are a MUST<br/>
&gt;have.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt; Okay, I am now lvl 10 and really concerned about this.  From what <br/>
&gt;EVERYONE<br/>
&gt; &gt; tells me (which I totally disagree with and the whole subject matter <br/>
&gt;makes<br/>
&gt; &gt; me sick) is that when older (25+) all we do is heal...no melee, no DD,<br/>
&gt;just<br/>
&gt; &gt; heal and med.  First...is that true or can we still melee..I know we <br/>
&gt;won&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; exactly be able to solo melee...but as in a group or possibly as the <br/>
&gt;only<br/>
&gt; &gt; tank?..and while on that subject, can we solo undead up into all our<br/>
&gt;higher<br/>
&gt; &gt; lvls or do we still need help then too?  And finally the mana issue.  I <br/>
&gt;am<br/>
&gt; &gt; dwarven cleric and have a 100 in strength and 103 in wisdom...will that <br/>
&gt;be<br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt; &gt; high enough wisdom to have proper mana to heal my group and such?  Any<br/>
&gt;other<br/>
&gt; &gt; tips would be most helpful.<br/>

&gt; &gt; P.S.  Any good cleric websites with detailed spell descriptions (like <br/>
&gt;how<br/>
&gt; &gt; much damage our spells deal, how much HPs our healing spells heal, and <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt; exact numbers on our buffs, etc)<br/>
