<div id="ygrps-yiv-1580064693">I&#39;m a lvl 15 Cleric and I&#39;m lucky to have around 14pp right now, so I have<br/>
to REALLY save up to get my lvl 19 spells.  I got an ok weapon a FS War<br/>
Hammer, so I&#39;m not really looking into getting a new weapon for sometime<br/>
unless someone I know gives me one or sells me one REALLY cheap.<br/>

&gt; I too am a 7th lvl cleric (high elf, on test server).  I&#39;m 1 bar from<br/>
&gt; 8th but I have a complete set of leather armor and all my spells for<br/>
&gt; my level (including summon food in the bank which I bought too early).<br/>
&gt; I think the trick for the cleric is to spend a great deal of time just<br/>
&gt; doing what I call having fun.  I haven&#39;t been overlly aggressive in<br/>
&gt; trying to go up in levels.  The test server only has about max 200<br/>
&gt; people on, so it&#39;s sometimes hard to get in a group.  And of course<br/>
&gt; at this level, I can&#39;t exactly sit at an orc camp and take on 3 or 4<br/>
&gt; orc centurions myself.  Because of this I tend to just wander around<br/>
&gt; a lot and fight stray orc pawns and skeletons that have weapons.  Even<br/>
&gt; though I don&#39;t get any experience for killing the creature, I can make<br/>
&gt; some money.  I also was working on a lot of the newbie quests for<br/>
&gt; the bards and paladins, etc.  In greater faydark you can deliver mail<br/>
&gt; from Felwithe to Kelethin for the Bards and get a gold coin every<br/>
&gt; time.  It even went up to 2 gp after the third time that I did it.  I<br/>
&gt; will probably go back and continue to do that.  And when some of my<br/>
&gt; travelling buds are on, I&#39;ll group and we&#39;ll go kill some orcs for<br/>
&gt; some xp.  But in the interrum, I just kill stuff for fun and profit,<br/>
&gt; literally, and not just for the XP.  All through 8th I&#39;m going to need<br/>
&gt; some money, of course, for my 9th level spells, but that shouldn&#39;t be<br/>
&gt; a problem.  Next I&#39;ll probably save up for a better weapon.<br/>
