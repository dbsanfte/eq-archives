<div id="ygrps-yiv-315314771">Huh? I seriously doubt this, unless a level 30 wizard is stealing from a<br/>
level 15 group. That doesn&#39;t happen much, because high level people aren&#39;t<br/>
interested in low level loot. You don&#39;t see level 30&#39;s, or even level 20&#39;s,<br/>
camping for mino axes or bronze weapons, for example, even though they could<br/>
easily steal them from the level 8&#39;s to 15&#39;s who want them. The problem lies<br/>
with with wizards, and sometimes mages and clerics, stealing from groups of<br/>
about their own level. A simple code change could fix this problem.<br/>
<br/>
Heck, even if you have a wizard of the same level in your group, your kill<br/>
will be stolen if he gets in one fewer shots, or if his spells get resisted<br/>
for a point or two more than the killstealer&#39;s, no matter HOW much damage<br/>
everyone else in the group combined does. That is really bad design.<br/>
<br/>
Another change that could help is to let everyone know how much damage is<br/>
being done by spellcasters. I don&#39;t understand why everyone can see the<br/>
damage done by every blow by the tanks, but only the spellcaster himself can<br/>
see his own damage report. If I could see the damage being inflicted by a<br/>
killstealer, I might throw in a few offensive spells to try to stop it --<br/>
which I usually don&#39;t, saving most of my mana for healing -- but as of now,<br/>
I have no idea how much damage is being done, and can&#39;t intervene<br/>
effectively. &#39;So-and-so begins to cast a spell&#39; just gets lost in all the<br/>
battle clutter.<br/>
<br/>
Heck, even if you have wizard in your group, he can&#39;t know how much damage<br/>
is being done by the killstealer and adjust his casts to try to counter it.<br/>
<br/>
This is a very dumb situation, and I don&#39;t understand why Verant has let it<br/>
continue.<br/>

&gt;Even if they made it so a groups combined damage was taken into<br/>
&gt;consideration solo wizards would still get the kill credit.  They can do<br/>
&gt;so much damage per spell that there really isn&#39;t enough HP left on a mob<br/>
&gt;for  a group total to be more.<br/>
&gt; Verants choice of whoever does the most damage vs. group damage, makes<br/>
&gt;no difference.<br/>
