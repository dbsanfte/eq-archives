<div id="ygrps-yiv-1469620372">i agree on some points mik..i do really get bothered by ppl asking me for a rez<br/>
once i enter the game or the zone......i don&#39;t mind doing it if i&#39;m in the<br/>
vicinity and have the time/mana, but to be asked to go to god knows where and<br/>
rez, that&#39;s quite ok...i&#39;m there to play the game, and have fun myself....i do<br/>
wish they&#39;d fix fear as well....seems a little insane to make the aggro range<br/>
that high...it was hard enough last time, but at least it was playable....every<br/>
time i&#39;ve been on a fear trip since then, not one good thing has<br/>
happened....even if we go in camo&#39;ed, things that couldn&#39;t see invis before now<br/>
can<br/>

&gt; I couldn&#39;t agree more,  Azor.  Verant seems totally preoccupied with<br/>
&gt; discovering and fixing ways players have found to make the game more<br/>
&gt; playable, rather than looking for positive changes that should be made to<br/>
&gt; improve both the classes and the game, itself.  It seems all they focus on<br/>
&gt; is how to make things harder on the players.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Why DON&#39;T they fix Fear Plane, or do something to improve the gosh awful<br/>
&gt; camping that is going on every single place where a decent item is found.<br/>
&gt; Last weekend, we (our level 50s) went to like 7 different places to try and<br/>
&gt; obtain items for some of us that didn&#39;t have them.  This was at 10am EDT on<br/>
&gt; a Sunday morning.  Every single last place was camped and the lower level<br/>
&gt; groups that were there told us they would be there all day and nite.  Since<br/>
&gt; there was really nothing else for us to do, (can&#39;t go to Fear and noone<br/>
&gt; needs exp anymore)  we all simply logged and went about doing  RL things<br/>
&gt; outside of EQ.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Verant needs to wake up to the fact that their high level players are<br/>
&gt; getting fed up and bored, and THAT&#39;s why they are leaving and/or selling<br/>
&gt; their characters on ebay and looking for new games.<br/>
