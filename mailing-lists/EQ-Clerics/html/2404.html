<div id="ygrps-yiv-1205991863">Well, I&#39;m taking this sit in from a different perspective.  I only get a few<br/>
hours of play time a week, and I think that I&#39;d rather use it playing the<br/>
game as opposed to sitting around.  I do enough sitting around, what with<br/>
trying to find a group and all to play in.  I sure don&#39;t want to do it on<br/>
purpose.<br/>
<br/>
Just my thought.<br/>
