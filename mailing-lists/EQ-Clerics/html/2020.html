<div id="ygrps-yiv-1371998010">Well, I successfully attained my ToV this weekend, and I am a DE Cleric. So,<br/>
it is possible for us evils to do this quest ;) The hardest part of the<br/>
quest, of course, was waiting on Dynil (sp?) to spawn in Highpass. I was<br/>
hunting in SKarana, so I made frequent trips to and from HKeep, and on one<br/>
such trip lo and behold, he was standing there. After pimp-slapping him and<br/>
taking his page of the book, I met up with a friend in Qeynos who invised me<br/>
and I went to Moordoro&#39;s place. Only took me 7 tries (28gp) to get the<br/>
jester. Needless to say, I was quite thrilled. If you are in your teens, I<br/>
recommend doing this quest because this is a great Cleric item (+10 WIS, +10<br/>
Mana) that is relatively easy to come by.<br/>
