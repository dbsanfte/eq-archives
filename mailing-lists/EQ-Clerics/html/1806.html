&gt; Being a Dark Elf Cleric, and one that has the Testament of Vanear I can<br/>
&gt; tell you you don&#39;t need to do half of what you have written.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; To get the book just give Moodoro Finharn 2gp.  He gives you the book..<br/>
&gt; then do the 4gp gamble thing to get the jester card.  Then give jester<br/>
&gt; card to Moodoro to get page.  Then go to HP and kill Dynil and get the<br/>
&gt; other page. Stick both pages in book and hit combine.  No need to go to<br/>
&gt; Erudin at all..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You will need to not be KOS in Qeynos and HP of course but that is<br/>
&gt; reasonably easy to achieve and you should be aiming for it anyway in my<br/>
&gt; opinion since DEs have so much hassle selling/banking as it is.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Talk to Rarnan Lapice on the top floor of the temple of divine light<br/>
&gt; &gt; in Erudin.  This starts the quest.. I haven&#39;t done this part yet, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve read about it.  Apparently you have to talk to several people and<br/>
&gt; &gt; one of them will eventually sell you the book for 2 gold.  The book is<br/>
&gt; &gt; a 2-slot inventory item.  There are two pages missing.  One of them is<br/>
&gt; &gt; on a guy named Dylin Fireshine in HHpass.  He conned low blue to me at<br/>
&gt; &gt; 17th.  I had a friend help me kill him, because the smugglers that are<br/>
&gt; &gt; near him help out when you attack.  You can find him by swimming in<br/>
&gt; &gt; the lake and going into the small hole underwater.  You can find<br/>
&gt; &gt; dylin up there under a little tent.  When you kill him you get 2<br/>
&gt; &gt; things, page 30 to the book, and a letter which is part of another<br/>
&gt; &gt; quest in Freeport.  After you kill him, the best qet-away tactic is<br/>
&gt; &gt; to leap off the edge up the small ramp in front of him, and zone into<br/>
&gt; &gt; the keep.  The second page is in North Qeynos from a guy named<br/>
&gt; &gt; Moodoro Finharn.  He hangs out in Crows bar.  I am KOS to everyone in<br/>
&gt; &gt; Crows bar, save for Moodoro, who is apprehensive, and blue to me at<br/>
&gt; &gt; 18th.  If this is so, you can hail Moodoro and say &quot;I want page 34.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; He will gamble with you to give you the page.  For every 4 gold you<br/>
&gt; &gt; give him, he will give you a random card.  If you get the joker card,<br/>
&gt; &gt; turn around and give him the joker card back, and he will give you the<br/>
&gt; &gt; page.  I have heard that some people spent as much as 20 plat to get<br/>
&gt; &gt; the card.  I just got it last night and it cost me 20 gold (5 tries).<br/>
&gt; &gt; Go to the bank, and withdraw about 20 plat in gold to be safe.  :)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I have the two pages, I just need to get the book now, and will get it<br/>
&gt; &gt; this week.  And I am 18th level, too.  You could effectively do this<br/>
&gt; &gt; quest at around 15th or so level, but you would need a group to help<br/>
&gt; &gt; you kill Dylin, as he is at least around that level.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; As a side note, a dark elf cleric should be able to do this.  You can<br/>
&gt; &gt; exit the sewers and play cards with Moodoro IF he is outside Crows.<br/>
&gt; &gt; For the most part there are no guards around.  Getting the actual book<br/>
&gt; &gt; itself would be tricky without since the Erudites are probably KOS to<br/>
&gt; &gt; you.  Although, if you sneak past and kill tons of Kerrans, you can<br/>
&gt; &gt; probably raise faction enough to pull it off.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;I am looking for some information regarding this +10 wis/mana book<br/>
quest. I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;have heard that you have to start it in Erudin in the library. Does<br/>
anybody<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;know the persons name. Any other tips and tricks would be great. And if<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;anybody knows what kinda level you should be for this quest that would<br/>
be<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;great. I better start practicing my 1hblunt that I havent used since<br/>
8th<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;level.<br/>
