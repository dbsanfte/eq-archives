<b>Subject:</b> Re: The Ancient crok in Upper Guk <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-821411526">Upper Guk is a weird bird.  The base level is around 20th level for<br/>
the vast portions of the dungeon.  The upper floor of upper Guk is<br/>
around levels 18-22.  Probably somewhere around 20-24 for the lower<br/>
level of Upper Guk (down the stairs, or down the slope, depending on<br/>
which way you went).  There are certain level cut-off points which a<br/>
group shouldn&#39;t go beyond.  One of these is the Shin Lord room.  A<br/>
group of mid-20s can own upper guk, but once they get to the Shin Lord<br/>
room, they would get the foo knocked out of them.  The other room is<br/>
the Priest room.  Again, a group of mid 20s could rock, but then get<br/>
slaughtered in this room.  It&#39;s at these points that a group of high<br/>
20s is required.<br/>
  The ancient croc room is about as far into UG as you can possibly<br/>
get.  If you look on a map, there is a small room that leads off a<br/>
large lake.  This little room goes nowhere, and the lake is at the<br/>
northern-most part on the map.  This is the croc room.  From what I<br/>
know,the croc is low 30s in level.  The other saltwater crocs are<br/>
similar level.  Apparently, the crocs do not aggro.  While I suspect<br/>
a full group of mid-high 20s could take the room, getting there is the<br/>
main problem.  There are two ways to get there.  The dungeon makes 2<br/>
big circles, basically.  The way on the left goes through the Priest<br/>
room.  A group of mid 20s could not get through this room alive.  I<br/>
have not been the other way.<br/>
<br/>
  Good luck.<br/>
