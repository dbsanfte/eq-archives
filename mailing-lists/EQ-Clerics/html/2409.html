<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2085584676">Personally, I think there are two types of clerics - those that want<br/>
to play more tank/clerics and those like myself that are striving for<br/>
the pure caster/cleric.  I, personally, would choose a +3 wis AC 0<br/>
piece over an AC6 piece that had no wisdom.  Hell, I&#39;ve already done<br/>
it several times.  :)<br/>
<br/>
But not everyone wants that. I think Verant should recognize that<br/>
people that play clerics may strive for one of the two extremes, and<br/>
let us make the decision for what kind of cleric we want to play.  I<br/>
agree that this armor is worthless, since the +wis is so rare.  Unless<br/>
it changes, I will only get the pieces that are +wis.  For me, the AC<br/>
is a moot point.<br/>

&gt;here here, well said Jeff, i agree i want more wisdom.  i refuse to do the<br/>
&gt;quests, as far as im concerned AAC is useless to me in comparison to the<br/>
&gt;wisdom i need, legs with intel=rediculas!!! plain and simple.....<br/>
