<div id="ygrps-yiv-2062429613">In that case, shouldn&#39;t you resist all buffs, Lay on Hands,<br/>
Ressurections, Divine Aura, Teleports, SoW, shadow step, etc etc?  What<br/>
about resisting the clense effect on a SSOL?  Or resisting Yaulp from a<br/>
screaming mace?<br/>
    It seems to me there should be a distinction between friendly magic and<br/>
foe magic - perhaps you are exerting willpower to resist those nasty roots<br/>
and burns cast by dazed orc shamen, but allowing your friendly cleric to<br/>
heal you...<br/>
