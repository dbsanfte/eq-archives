<b>Subject:</b> Screaming Mace Question <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-224467431">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I am considering buying a Screaming Mace.  Right now I have a BloodForge<br/>
Hammer, whic does great dmg, but is slow and heavy.  I also find I am<br/>
soloing less, so I want a 1H that I can use my SBS with.<br/>
<br/>
My current 1H blunt is a FS Mace, which has 8dmg, and rougly the same dly as<br/>
the Screaming Mace.  Its wt is 10.  <br/>
<br/>
Other than the magical effects, is there any advantage to buying one? Or<br/>
should I save my money?<br/>
