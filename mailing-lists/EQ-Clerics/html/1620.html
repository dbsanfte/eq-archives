<div id="ygrps-yiv-621758361">heheheh Bree, if I worked for Verant...I&#39;d be voting for ALOT of<br/>
changes....more towards DnD style of play.  See, I grew up on DnD,  I was a<br/>
DM for a LONG time.  (Never actually been on the player side of a Paper RPG)<br/>
and I learned the hard way how balance has to be acheived....<br/>
<br/>
One of the biggest problems I see in EQ is the experience<br/>
ratings.....parties....etc.  I dont agree with alot of their designs.  You<br/>
could easily take a game that is a paper RPG, and try to use it as a basis<br/>
for, and lets be honest...an online visual mud.  The classes, as Verant has<br/>
them, do have balance to a degree....but they are tilting and skewing that<br/>
more and more.  Clerics,  we should be prime healers AND somewhat decent<br/>
fighters....I&#39;m sorry...Clerics SHOULD be better fighters than druids.<br/>
SHOULD.  We arent.  Druids beleive in nature....beleive in using spells to<br/>
help defend it....their cousin rangers are the fighters....but that&#39;s not<br/>
the entire case here.  I know druids could mess up clerics badly in a melee<br/>
fight.  I&#39;ve had it done to me.  Entangle, WHAP WHAP WHAP, hey look, I&#39;ll<br/>
put this Damage shield up too....cleric kills self in melee.  <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s one of the examples...I could spew forth a TON.<br/>
<br/>
As for parties....Well...I think you should be able to include one of every<br/>
type IN your party.  I think the party structure SHOULD be bigger.  Maybe 9<br/>
to a party.  Why? Because you can give stratified layers to a group....your<br/>
body/polygons should be able to block that mage behind you casting on the<br/>
goblin.  That warrior should be able to hedge you in a corner and defend you<br/>
while you pray to whatever god you worship for spells....  Most MUDs even<br/>
have a 9 player party for this reason....and you can select how your party<br/>
grouping goes out....diamond formations....columns...lines....it gives a<br/>
chance for melee classes to be out in front...and healers/casters to stay<br/>
back and do what they do....unless that meleer screws up....or is knocked<br/>
down....(aka he falls and the monster jumps over them)<br/>
<br/>
Games like Ballder&#39;s Gate even give methods to control party....it would be<br/>
a blast I think to find the best ways for parties to run in formation to<br/>
tackle the Dragon which is ravaging the country side.  Or the best way to<br/>
invade the city which thy are running into...etc.<br/>
<br/>
There are alot of faults with EQ that they just dont want to deal with<br/>
anymore...or take their sweetass time over.....tailoring JUST got<br/>
fixed....after HOW long?  Even in beta it wasnt touched....and they KNEW<br/>
about it.   They are downing anything which gives more cash than you insert<br/>
into it....they are making it HARDER for soloists to get exp (though, It is<br/>
annoying to see a druid or ANY Dotter just blow past me in lvls as they kill<br/>
steal or kite everything...)<br/>
<br/>
Verant has made ALOT of bad choices.  Their tech support outright BLOWS.  It<br/>
has from DAY ONE.  You call them and they give you the run back to the GMs<br/>
who in turn give you the run back to Tech support line....which is now a<br/>
toll call.  (because they had such a high volume of calls ONLY for EQ I was<br/>
explained by a supervisor)  Verant has seriously gotten me upset with their<br/>
game....and I&#39;ve been playing alot less than I was....though I still do<br/>
play.  I might go back into it hardcore again if they find some way to<br/>
redeem themselves.....but the downgrades we&#39;ve gotten are just annoying.  <br/>
<br/>
Time limits on res?  I could see it rated by LEVEL....like at lvl 29 you<br/>
have 2 days to res the person (like in DND) and each level increase 2 days<br/>
time or something.  (2 days btw would be one hour I beleive real time?)<br/>
That could be a lil more acceptable...but a lvl 29 having the same chance to<br/>
res as a lvl 50 for time duration?  Screw that in my own opinion.  <br/>
<br/>
Oh....clerics have an error in spell database....lets downgrade retribution<br/>
then.  Oh....box of abukar has an error too...lets downgrade....upgrade it<br/>
back....remove it.....put it back....downgrade it AGAIN.....and then finally<br/>
after they keep getting upset lets reintroduce it and not bother to say<br/>
sorry.  But....we did annouce it was an error right?  Meanwhile clerics who<br/>
say:  this has been an error for MONTHS and you JUST notice?  and we lose<br/>
points still to a high lvl spell for dmg....<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry for rambling....its just that verant has made tons of<br/>
mistakes....I&#39;m sorry if I try to take their side sometimes....but alot I&#39;m<br/>
pissed myself.  I just try to look at both sides......and I think clerics<br/>
have gotten the shaft a ton as more patches come....<br/>

Bann, just a curious question here. Do you work for Verant?<br/>
Cause you surely defend every last thing they do.<br/>
<br/>
NO class should ever be made weaker, Verant is digging their own grave by <br/>
nerfing any class, if Verant needs to tweak for balance then they should add<br/>
<br/>
to a classes skills not take away.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Plane of Fear = fixed. (3 seperate lands have been in there since it has<br/>
&gt;been re-tweaked)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Rogues....I think alot of their problems HAVE been fixed....except a few<br/>
&gt;things like failing poison if moving.....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And some classes need to be made weaker to balance the game....then<br/>
&gt;again...some also need to be made stronger to balance as well....<br/>
