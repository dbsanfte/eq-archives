<div id="ygrps-yiv-400892345">well i went to a lone server that i do not use and did the rundown on all <br/>
the clerics, here is what i found;<br/>
Dark elfs-base-118<br/>
Dwarfs-base-118<br/>
Eridites-base-118<br/>
Gnome-base-102<br/>
Halfling-base-115<br/>
Humans-base-110, and the all ellusive, all powerfull<br/>
High Elfs-base-130<br/>
this is with putting all yer points into wisdom, when this is done you are <br/>
left with 5 points, which i put into str, so you see if ya put all points <br/>
into wis then you can perty much start out with fairly high wis.  I did not <br/>
when i first made my human cleric, who btw is now lvl 25-but alas she is not <br/>
very wise as i made her all wrong =0(, therefore i think she will suck at <br/>
higher lvls as far as having enough manna to heal effectively, adira and i <br/>
know eachother and i am always amazed at how many heals and buffs she can <br/>
get off as opposed to how few i can in comparision. oh well hindsight always <br/>
hurts  LOL<br/>
All i am saying is stand tall, be proud, and do your best--Adira was right  <br/>
the cleric is not the way to go for all ppl.  then again there are lots of <br/>
wis items out there and for me  this is what i have to do, so far i am <br/>
wearing a savants cap, a BS tunic, wis rings and earrings, and im just <br/>
barely above 105  lol  but i work my butt off to keep ppl alive  i love my <br/>
cleric best and know there are many items out there to bring my wis up so... <br/>
have fun with the toon  thats what is most important anyway!!  =0)<br/>

&gt;How on earth did you get a wisdom so high at 15th level?  What are you<br/>
&gt;wearing?  I&#39;m 19th level and my wisdom is only 116.  Granted, all I<br/>
&gt;have are 2 +2 wis rings, but still....<br/>

&gt;&gt;  I am a lvl 15 dwarven cleric. I have 147wis, but i still want more. How<br/>
&gt;&gt;much do Gatorscale Leggings go for? Also any +wis items that could be<br/>
&gt;&gt;listed<br/>
&gt;&gt;would be very helpful. Thx<br/>
