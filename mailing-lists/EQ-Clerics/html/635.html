<div id="ygrps-yiv-1178772915">What you have to understand is that by not at least trying to follow general<br/>
grammatical guidelines that your point is frequently ignored or<br/>
misunderstood.  If you are going to spend the time to reply to a message,<br/>
you must feel that your response is of value so make sure it&#39;s understood.<br/>
Take 30 sec cut your message out paste it into a word processor then put it<br/>
back into the mail.  I&#39;m terrible at english but I want my point understood<br/>
so I take the time to check myself.<br/>
