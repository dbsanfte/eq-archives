<div id="ygrps-yiv-710373254">Greetings all.<br/>
    IMHO Unrest is more.. how shall I say, &quot;satisfactory&quot;?  You get more<br/>
magical items and the level of the monsters range higher than at Befallen.<br/>
Befallen&#39;s best loot would be the thaurmagatists robe and bone bladed<br/>
claymore (IMHO).I would chance to say Befallen requires a more learned group<br/>
because of the layout while Unrest can be dealt with a less experienced<br/>
group staying outside the house.<br/>
    However, Befallen is probably better for levels 5-20 while Unrest is<br/>
around 12-mid 30s, so that does pose a difference.<br/>
    Those are the rantings of a dark elf, i bid farewelll of all of thee til<br/>
a later date.<br/>
