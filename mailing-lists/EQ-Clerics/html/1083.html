<div id="ygrps-yiv-706769850">hehehehe yeah it does suck doesn&#39;t it? and i had a trip to fear last<br/>
night.....since the patch, that place is a deathtrap waiting to<br/>
happen.....out of at least 30 ppl starting out, 25 at least died in the 1st<br/>
minute.....the aggro range on the crits now is HUGE.....we had to have a gm<br/>
come in and help us get our corpses.....what kinda crap is that? they<br/>
could&#39;ve put the level limit on it, and then kept the monsters the<br/>
same....it was hard enough before....but anywoo, done with my rantings for<br/>
today (;<br/>

&gt; Yeah, but I&#39;m still astonished that with Invulnerability on, I can fall<br/>
&gt; from a height that would flatten me for more than 1000 damage, can laugh<br/>
&gt; at damage spells that would kill me in an instant, but can be stunned by<br/>
&gt; a freaking low-level skeleton who bashes me for 1 measly point of<br/>
&gt; damage. C&#39;mon Verant, WTF? </span></blockquote></div>
