<div id="ygrps-yiv-1135863405">well, there&#39;s pally trainers at the cleric guild, so why not cleric trainers at<br/>
the pally guild? makes sense to me<br/>

&gt; Last time I leveled I went back to Freeport to train. Not knowing the area<br/>
&gt; very well I managed to go to the Paladin&#39;s guild instead of the cleric&#39;s<br/>
&gt; guild without realizing it (yes, I know, not very clever but it was very<br/>
&gt; late). I located a trainer there and the system allowed her to train me.<br/>
&gt; Just curious if any one else has done this and if this might allow a player<br/>
&gt; to literally use any guild to train in. This has ,embarrassingly enough,<br/>
&gt; worked twice for me.<br/>
