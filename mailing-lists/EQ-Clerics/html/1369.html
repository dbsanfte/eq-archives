And, at least in the game I play in, if a ruling is made that turns<br/>
out to be unbalancing, the gamemaster DOES reserve the right to go<br/>
back and rework the rules so it is no longer unbalancing. Otherwise,<br/>
the game becomes not fun for the rest of the players.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if the Box was unbalancing or not. But Verant is the gamemaster<br/>
here. The gamemaster is always right. If you don&#39;t like the way the gamemaster<br/>
chooses to run the game, you have two choices 1) try to convince the<br/>
GM that they are messing things up instead of helping 2) leave and go<br/>
play under a different Gm.<br/>
<br/>
If enough people do (2) then the GM might get the idea that hey are<br/>
messing up. Or they might decide they don&#39;t want to run that type of<br/>
game that people want to play under and just not run  a game at all.<br/>
