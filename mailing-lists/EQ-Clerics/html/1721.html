<b>Subject:</b> Re: Paw of Opalla and Desperate request for aid. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-292554510">I was under the impression that the paw of opalla was no trade - therefore<br/>
not really &quot;a dime a dozen&quot;  And I would never begrudge another cleric a<br/>
good item.  The rings are NOT no trade - so it IS possible to purchase<br/>
them - though they are excessively costly to get from another player.<br/>
<br/>
And at your level, killing Mitty should give you good experience, so get a<br/>
group and hunt her, you don&#39;t have to rely on smite alone if you have a<br/>
group - everyone in the group could get experience, thus no one would mind<br/>
overly helping you to camp.  (Druids seems to like the paw also - you can<br/>
get a druid to help you camp and help you to kill Mitty - and get both of<br/>
you the rings)<br/>
<br/>
I need to camp that Mitty also ;) so if you need help on Solusek Ro server,<br/>
would be glad to help.<br/>
<br/>
Just some thoughts =)<br/>
