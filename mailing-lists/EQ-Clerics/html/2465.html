<div id="ygrps-yiv-691932649">One of the best places I went for Safe EXP was in the basement, hunting the<br/>
Ghost in unrest. There is no chance of a train unless you make it and the loot<br/>
isn&#39;t too bad with jagged bands and DW boots being dropped occasionally. Being a<br/>
Cleric you are naturally in demand down there. Even at 35 you gain EXP pretty<br/>
fast there ,depending on group make-up of course.<br/>

&gt; I have been stuck on level 35 for years now... (ok a slight exageration..)<br/>
&gt; Someone told me that the specs in Feerrot was a good spot to get out of this<br/>
&gt; level... I just spent 4 hours in Kith with a group and only got 25% of a<br/>
&gt; bbl. We where fighting many different things including reds...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A few ppl in my group told me they ended up having to solo to get out of<br/>
&gt; this level with any type of speed...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Any insight would be appreciated.<br/>
