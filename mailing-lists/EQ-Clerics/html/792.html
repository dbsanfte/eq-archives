Heres something else....<br/>
<br/>
We were in South Karana fighting birdies...my group was fighting, and a<br/>
wizard comes along trying to steal the kill. How to deal with that? We all<br/>
took off auto attack, and let the bird attack her when she tried to kill<br/>
steal. She didn&#39;t last long &lt;snickers&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Another thing I&#39;ve done, playing my Magician, I would click on a spell,<br/>
make<br/>
it look like I&#39;m casting, and the KSer would attack the bird...not knowing<br/>
that we never attacked it. Since birds are only aggressive if attacked, we<br/>
watched this KSer get pummeled to the ground. Needless to say, she left<br/>
after that =)<br/>
<br/>
haha!<br/>

Ok, so then 6, kill-stealing Wizards can group together and do over 1,000<br/>
point of damage in a matter of seconds? It is better the way it is. Just<br/>
remember to train Dvinn to those kill stealers and you&#39;ll be alright ;)<br/>
(always worked for me in CB)<br/>

 &gt; Please forgive, for I am new to this list, but here is my problem and<br/>
 &gt; suggestion for Verant:<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; My number one problem with the game is kill stealing. This frustrates me<br/>
 &gt; to<br/>
 &gt; no end.  I can&#39;t begin to tell you how long I have been trying for a<br/>

 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; I think the problem is how Verant determines who gets the kill. As I<br/>

 &gt; like an easy fix and it makes logical sense.<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; What is everyone else&#39;s opinion, and has anybody heard of Verant<br/>
 &gt; commenting<br/>
 &gt; on this issue?<br/>
