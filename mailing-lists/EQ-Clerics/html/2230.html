<b>Subject:</b> root and taunting <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-164941330">The accepted wisdom:<br/>
1. Taunt doesn&#39;t work very well until at least the 20&#39;s. (Either because of<br/>
lack of skill or lack of mob intelligence).<br/>
2. Snare and root both work as taunts.<br/>
3a. Snare is usually preferred to root, because the mob will still run when<br/>
low on health.<br/>
3b. Root is usually used to park a mob out of the way, or when you want to<br/>
run away.<br/>
<br/>
Root has a specific use which I have found very useful in the teens and I<br/>
suspect for a little longer yet. In my experience, a rooted mob will attack<br/>
the nearest person. Not the person who has done it the most damage, or the<br/>
person who has taunted it a lot, but the very nearest person, even if the<br/>
people who have made it angry are still within melee range.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d be surprised if this is a special effect of root, it probably just drops<br/>
out of the mob anger calculation, part of which is based on distance. But it<br/>
seems to work. Here&#39;s a specific instance:<br/>
<br/>
The other day I was in Crushbone and a couple of people were attacking a<br/>
centurion. They were levels 8-9. When he got to to about 1/2 health I rooted<br/>
him, and stepped in closer than they were. I didn&#39;t attack the centurion,<br/>
but he turned to me and started hitting (OK missing) me. This could be<br/>
attributed to the taunt value of root so far. But when one of the other<br/>
people moved closer, he switched back to them. Then I moved closer still,<br/>
practically on top of him, and he switched back to me and stayed on me for<br/>
the remainder, even though I was never attacking him.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve found this a good technique for damage-spreading. But don&#39;t take my<br/>
word for it - try it out. My experiments haven&#39;t been very scientific up to<br/>
now.<br/>
