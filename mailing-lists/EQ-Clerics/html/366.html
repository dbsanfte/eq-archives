<div id="ygrps-yiv-1204286434">yeah i agree about drel in naj...i camped her with an ench for like 12 hours,<br/>
and we both got 1 pair......but it took about 6 hours for hers, and the other 6<br/>
for mine...and we killed her about 30 times altogether....was pretty messed up<br/>

&gt; I couldnt agree with you more!!!! Last night Fennin Ro had OVER 1950 people<br/>
&gt; on that ONE server!!!!!! They need to lock that server down completely and<br/>
&gt; possibly move any level 10 and below character over to another server.<br/>
&gt; Personally, I don&#39;t think ANY server should have more than 500 people on it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also, they need to have more than one zone carry certain &#39;very saught&#39; after<br/>
&gt; items, such as Rubicite armor. Why does Cazic Thule have to be the only<br/>
&gt; zone? Of COURSE there will be 70-100 people in the zone! Move the Ruby<br/>
&gt; around...put some in Rathe Mountains, make a level 25+ zone on Erudin so<br/>
&gt; Ruby can drop there....but not all in one zone. Look at the Journeyman<br/>
&gt; boots. ONE NPC in the entire game has it, its a no drop item, meaning you<br/>
&gt; have to loot it yourself. Why cant this npc drop it everytime to stop<br/>
&gt; overcamping and people from Kill stealing? No, that would make way too much<br/>
&gt; sense, I guess.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Over camping and lagging CAN end if some of the ideas that so many have sent<br/>
&gt; in are implemented. But of course, that would cause Verant having to<br/>
&gt; actually DO something...can&#39;t have that. (naww...I&#39;m not upset heheh &lt;grin&gt;)<br/>
