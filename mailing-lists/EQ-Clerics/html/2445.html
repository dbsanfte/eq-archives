<div id="ygrps-yiv-702315174">The only difference in it is the magical effects, so other than those... no.   I have been using a screaming mace myself though for a long time and it&#39;s a decent enough weapon... i&#39;m level 30 and still using it (until I can get one of those tarnished morning stars from Kithicore that is).    The screaming maces are really getting cheap these days (compared to when I first started playing and they were selling for around 150-200pp.. now they are more like 85 from what i&#39;ve been seeing).<br/>

Subject: [EQ-Clerics] Screaming Mace Question<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hi,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am considering buying a Screaming Mace.  Right now I have a BloodForge<br/>
&gt; Hammer, whic does great dmg, but is slow and heavy.  I also find I am<br/>
&gt; soloing less, so I want a 1H that I can use my SBS with.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My current 1H blunt is a FS Mace, which has 8dmg, and rougly the same dly as<br/>
&gt; the Screaming Mace.  Its wt is 10.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Other than the magical effects, is there any advantage to buying one? Or<br/>
&gt; should I save my money?<br/>
