<div id="ygrps-yiv-1357401424">When i am running around the Norrath i always look around the people and<br/>
check for their health. If they are fighting i stop and throw a heal on<br/>
them. If they are sitting and very low on health i throw a heal on them.<br/>
However, if i am in group i rarely check the health of others unless it<br/>
looks very obvious that the guy is losing AND all my group members are<br/>
safe. Also, if i am hunting in a guild event i am extra careful about<br/>
my fellow guildmembers health but still might be looking out for others<br/>
who may be in trouble. And for revives i feel sorry for the people<br/>
especially if they are binded far away. I have never charged for a revive<br/>
and never will. Often i even offer a revive for them if i see them slayed<br/>
by Bouncer Hurd or some other foul beast.<br/>
