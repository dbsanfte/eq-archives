<div id="ygrps-yiv-24102842">In my experience drinking alcohol does not add to strength as I had heard it<br/>
would (maybe some warriors, etc - but not clerics that I have seen) - and<br/>
you wouldn&#39;t want to drink while hunting because it makes you interrupt on<br/>
your casting times.  It will not affect your wisdom, but the more you drink<br/>
the more your intelligence will drop.  It is a pretty useless skill for a<br/>
cleric and more for fun and roleplay, in my opinion.<br/>
