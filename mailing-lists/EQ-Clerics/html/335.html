<div id="ygrps-yiv-2026381865">not qute....lv 30, 35, 40, and 45 are barrier levels....which means it takes way<br/>
longer to get exp in those lv....going from 30 to 31 took almost twice as long<br/>
as opposed to going from 31 to 32.....even though it will say you gain party exp<br/>
or whatever, it doesn&#39;t show much because it is a barrier lv<br/>

&gt; I think what she was saying is it depends on what Lvl the person you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; casting it on is on.  Like since I&#39;m still lvl 15 (should hit Lvl 16<br/>
&gt; sometime today), if casted it on me I would not get much exp back but if you<br/>
&gt; casted it on a played say that was Lvl 45 they&#39;d get a good bit back.<br/>
&gt; So I take it you finally got you one of those Staff of the Observer you&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; been wanting forever.  Hope you like it and congrats on Lvl 40.  Why is Lvl<br/>
&gt; 40 gonna suck by the way?  Is it like Lvl 20 when ya die you lose close to a<br/>
&gt; bubble of exp?  If thats why then I guess on Lvl 40 you what lose close to<br/>
&gt; two bubbles of exp?<br/>

&gt; &gt; actually, that does make a lot of sense.....it would seem that hte higher<br/>
&gt; lv you<br/>
&gt; &gt; are, the more exp you can give back.....i just know now that i have to go<br/>
&gt; thru<br/>
&gt; &gt; hell all over again....lv 40&#39;s gonna SUCK majorly......o btw, i have a<br/>
&gt; question<br/>
&gt; &gt; about the staff of the observer while i&#39;m thinking about it....it has one<br/>
&gt; charge<br/>
&gt; &gt; of the sentinel spell....&lt;which is a crock ir should be unlimited like the<br/>
&gt; &gt; jboots&gt; but is there anyway to recharge it or maybe does it recharge on<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s own<br/>
&gt; &gt; &lt;that was suggested to me by a guildmate&gt; or do i just have to get a new<br/>
&gt; staff?<br/>
&gt; &gt; which would suck there too....any info would be greatly appreciated on<br/>
&gt; this...i<br/>
&gt; &gt; love that staff, and the sentinel effect was really kewl and would come in<br/>
&gt; handy<br/>
&gt; &gt; in places like cazic and lower guk....<br/>
