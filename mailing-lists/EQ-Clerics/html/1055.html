<div id="ygrps-yiv-848190525">I have to admit, that I have been bitten by the EQ bug. I play when I can<br/>
at home, and while I am at work I read thses Emais, and search Everquest web<br/>
sites for information. I have complied notebooks full of information,<br/>
gathered from the web sites and printed up on my printer. Hehe. Healingsun,<br/>
