<div id="ygrps-yiv-2084474928">Just wanted to open a discussion on Clerics who love to fight.  I am<br/>
happy being a cleric, but I cannot resist jumping into the heat of a<br/>
battle and kicking some back.  I also like to occassionally tank.  I try<br/>
to save all my mana for healing, but sometimes I just love to blast<br/>
away.  This is probably because I feel useless when grouped as my<br/>
regular attack doesn&#39;t compare to others in the group.  Anyone else feel<br/>
this way?  Any experiences to share?<br/>
