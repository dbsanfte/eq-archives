<b>Subject:</b> Re: Cleric Behaviour <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1834508003">What?! Are there only evil clerics here?  BTW I find that contradicting.<br/>
Evil + Cleric just seems a bit ironic.<br/>
<br/>
For those clerics who are not fill with hate, yes, I do believe since we are<br/>
gifted with the ability to heal we should do all we can to sustain life over<br/>
death.  However, you should manage your manna wisely.<br/>

Another subject:<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone tell me how many manna 1 pt of WIS converts to?<br/>

&gt; Innoruuk&#39;s followers to ensure his greater glory.  All others are merely<br/>
&gt; fuel to feed his fires, like kindling.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m new to this mail list, and thought I would introduce<br/>
&gt; myself with a<br/>
&gt; &gt;topic<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to discuss.  I&#39;ve often wondered what exactly it means to be<br/>
&gt; a cleric in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Norrath.  My personal opinion is that we should always be merciful to<br/>
&gt; &gt;those<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; around us, and help in any way we can.  Even if to heal<br/>
&gt; someone we don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt;even<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; know completely depletes our mana.  What do you think of this?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Perhaps that is what Karana asks of you.<br/>
&gt; &gt;But Innoruk is the God of Hate and Pain. Pain is real. You can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt;avoid it. of all the gods, he is the only one honest with his followers.<br/>
&gt; &gt;He WANTS us killing everything. So why should I use the powers he gives<br/>
&gt; &gt;me on those who do not followhim, and will actively work against him? </span></blockquote></div>
