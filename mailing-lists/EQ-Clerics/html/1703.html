&gt; A friend of mine who just got the Paw told me the secret to getting Gynok<br/>
&gt; Moltar to spawn is that you must kill his placeholder.  That&#39;s the critter<br/>
&gt; that will spawn in his place if he doesn&#39;t. The problem, he told me, is that<br/>
&gt; when it spawns, it wanders around and then down to the 3rd level.  AND it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; not named, he said, so you don&#39;t know what to look for if you weren&#39;t there<br/>
&gt; to see it spawn.   Your timing has to be good.  If the placeholder has<br/>
&gt; spawned and made it down to third floor, and you don&#39;t know it when you show<br/>
&gt; up to camp him,  then he&#39;s not gonna spawn til someone kills it.  He said it<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t take him long to get the ring from Gynok because he kept killing the<br/>
&gt; placeholder when it spawned and pretty quickly Gynok would spawn.<br/>
