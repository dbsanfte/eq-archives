&gt; &gt;I&#39;m trying for the boots, gauntlets, arms bracers, and the caduceus..<br/>
&gt; &gt;For those that have done these quests, are they obtainable by a 24th<br/>
&gt; &gt;level cleric (i.e., me)?  Specifically, the boots (stumpwatch,<br/>
&gt; &gt;cabinwatch shouldn&#39;t be hard), don&#39;t know about the rest. Possible?<br/>
&gt; &gt;What level is Babbinsbort?  What level is Gull?  And how do you get<br/>
&gt; &gt;to him?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t know what level those NPC&#39;s are ... but I do know you won&#39;t be able<br/>
&gt;to do them by yourself.   A friend of mine was 34th when he died several<br/>
&gt;times trying to solo them =).   Certainly though you can take them with a<br/>
&gt;group... I think they are certainly in your reach if you want to go for<br/>
&gt;them,  I wouldn&#39;t mind a Caduceus of the Sacrament myself... that is the <br/>
&gt;one<br/>
&gt;item that is actually pretty good.  I wish it had +wisdom, i&#39;m really<br/>
&gt;looking for a 1HB that has +wisdom, but it is still very good... high <br/>
&gt;damage<br/>
&gt;and fast for a 1HB.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     As for stump watch and cabin watch... of course you can do those, but<br/>
&gt;the problem is that you have to do them in the Kithicore forest... always a<br/>
&gt;dangerous thing.    I actually have the piece from the cabin... it happened<br/>
&gt;to be there as I was running by  from WC to rivervale so I only need the<br/>
&gt;stump piece.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Looks like the bracers require killing some mid 30s ghoul, so I will<br/>
&gt; &gt;wait on these.<br/>
&gt; &gt;What level is the greater darkbone skeleton in Rathe mountains?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Again I&#39;m not sure what level he is, but you would probably want to be with<br/>
&gt;somebody when you tried it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I would love to get the bracers myself, but those things you have to kill<br/>
&gt;are so rare that I don&#39;t really maintain much hope of finding them... and<br/>
&gt;now that I have PBB&#39;s, they aren&#39;t all that important.   I will just wait<br/>
&gt;until i am able to get runed Mithril bracers instead.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;How do I make galvanized, magnetized, and vulcanized platinum bars?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If you ask the person who gives you the quests about galvanized, <br/>
&gt;magnatized,<br/>
&gt;or vulcanized platinum he will tell you which NPC to give your enchanted<br/>
&gt;platinum to.   When you give those NPC&#39;s an ehchanted bar, they give you a<br/>
&gt;bar of galvanized, magnetized, or vulcanized.<br/>
