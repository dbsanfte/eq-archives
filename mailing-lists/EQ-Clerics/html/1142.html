<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1247653596">One other item that hasn&#39;t been mentioned here, and this is for all those higher<br/>
level casters and tanks alike, especially the hybrids (darn pally&#39;s with our<br/>
buffs)- that is Dispell/Nullify Magic.  Here&#39;s a list of spells that I use:<br/>
<br/>
Casters:<br/>
Blind (goes off pretty fast- only if I can start casting first)<br/>
Stun<br/>
Nullify Magic<br/>
Stun<br/>
Run up and start melee<br/>
DD (Wrait for me)<br/>
Root/Enstill (by now they are trying to get away from melee)<br/>
Run back into melee range<br/>
Stun<br/>
Wraith<br/>
Stun<br/>
Wraith<br/>
Should be done by now<br/>
If they root you first and start casting again- Stun! or use Divine line.  I use<br/>
DA in the beginning of a fight to see if I can get them to waste their mana.<br/>
Usually after a few rounds.<br/>
<br/>
Best thing about PvP vs&#39; casters- when you blind them they do NOT KNOW if they<br/>
are doing damage (cant&#39; see the messages) so they can blow all their mana while<br/>
you med :)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Melee:<br/>
Blind<br/>
Stun (may not be necessary here- just use some foot work)<br/>
Root/Enstill<br/>
Dispell Magic<br/>
Stun<br/>
Blast until dead or they break root<br/>
Then re-blind &#39;em<br/>
Re-root<br/>
Blast some more<br/>
You will probably need to med in this process, just make sure that you blind &<br/>
root them first, then just sit down are get some mana back (and hope they don&#39;t<br/>
have a bow- if they do, go DA and let them waste all their arrows).<br/>
