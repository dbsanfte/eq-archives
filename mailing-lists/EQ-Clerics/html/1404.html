<div id="ygrps-yiv-802910120">Aye, tis true you can melee effectively, but, let me say that at lower lvls <br/>
myself and my necro love, were evenly matched, and at lower lvls i could out <br/>
melee him anyday.  Now if we take on 2 critters at the same time , he always <br/>
finishes his first and with less damg. to himself.  I have found that now <br/>
that i am above 20, i am best at healing and killing undead, and what that <br/>
other guy said in the other post is true, if yer a healer and you get into <br/>
the melee you will not be a sought after partner.  I have many ppl always <br/>
/t&#39;ing me to ask me to join-why? because I have finally gotten the art of <br/>
healing down pat.  Art you say? Aye healing is a true art form, if a healer <br/>
is not doing their job the whole group will die, this is a garentee!!!  I <br/>
have lost many a group member in the past  and stil lose a few due to being <br/>
hit on, but I can tell you i love being a cleric and as such, will play the <br/>
role of the healer.  |I do keep up my skills thou, when i am alone i do <br/>
nothing but melee, this all works well for me.  What the other person said <br/>
is true thou, do what makes YOU happy, thou later in lvls you will only be <br/>
best suited for healing.  HEY it&#39;s and ugly job but someone has to do it !! <br/>
LOL<br/>

&gt;I don&#39;t think you have to give up one to the exclusion of the other (melee<br/>
&gt;skills for casting skills).  I think a good cleric will develop both of<br/>
&gt;these skills, which makes them more well-rounded with more options.  As I<br/>
&gt;said in a previous post, I still melee in certain situations, and in <br/>
&gt;others,<br/>
&gt;I do nothing but buff, heal and med and depending on the critters, throw in<br/>
&gt;a dd spell every now and then if appropriate.<br/>
