<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-10588719">I zoned out of north ro into east commons and my machine locked up<br/>
hard last night.  Had to reset.  I removed all my .opt files (there<br/>
were 3 of them [ more if you have more characters]) and one of them<br/>
was for all my configuration.  So when I went into the game, my<br/>
resolution was back at 640x480 and my friends list was gone, and all<br/>
my hot-keys were undefined.<br/>

&gt;For those that didn&#39;t see the banner on EQ today, they said if you keep<br/>
&gt;getting disconnected while zoning or camping to deleted your *.opt files in<br/>
&gt;your EQ dir.<br/>
