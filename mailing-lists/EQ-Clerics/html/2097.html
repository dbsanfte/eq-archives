&gt;  The one recurring thing I see here, is wisdom is everything. Is this true? From what I&#39;ve seen of higher levels, even having near double the wisdom of others, you get like enough mana to cast half a greater heal or whatever the non-full heal one is (I&#39;m only lvl 20). Seems strange that wis is so important if this is the case.<br/>
