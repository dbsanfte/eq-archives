<b>Subject:</b> Paw of Opolla <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1534645023"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;  I have a question for anyone who might know the answer.  Is it possible to<br/>
	&gt;use both the Paw of Opolla and the Testament of Vanear at the same time?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think so, as the Paw is supposed to be equippable in either hand.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m part way through the Paw quest too and I need some help.<br/>
1. Can I actually buy a Rat Meat Pie (or Rat Ear Pie) from Qeynos Hills, or can I only get the recipe from Rephas and still have to find a skilled baker to bake the pie? Rephas views me dubiously and won&#39;t talk to me anyway, but I have the recipe. I looked in the shop at the middle of the Hills zone and they didn&#39;t sell the pie. Tried to right click on Rephas but he&#39;s not a merchant npc.<br/>
2. Is there a proven method of getting Gynok Moltor to spawn? I&#39;ve tried to keep the level 1 entrance area clear and keep the broken stairs room clear, neither got him to spawn after a few hours.<br/>
