<b>Subject:</b> Cleric Only Weapon- why? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-375421667">Even if I was given the opportunity to loot that weapon, I probably wouldn&#39;t.<br/>
The only reason I might loot it is for the novelty or for trade- isn&#39;t it no<br/>
drop?  If so, there goes that thought.  I&#39;ll take my Charred Guardian Shield and<br/>
soon completed Paw anyday over that weapon.  Wow, a whole what- maybe 60 pts of<br/>
damage to something that has 2K-5K hitpoints?  If it had some +wis like the<br/>
shaman or druid only weapons (those in the game and being implemented), then<br/>
maybe.<br/>
<br/>
Oh well, I don&#39;t really need a weapon anyway, but thanks for thinking of us<br/>
Verant.  Oh, wait a minute..... you think clerics are so balanced that you don&#39;t<br/>
want to give us weapon that may help us do our job?  You&#39;re right on class<br/>
balance, but never mind the thanks :)<br/>
