<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Hi, After playing about 3 characters, I decided to make another, and so<br/>
&gt;far I really like my cleric.  One problem I  can&#39;t seem to solve is the<br/>
&gt;money issue.  How did u guys get the spells and armor you  needed?  I<br/>
&gt;figure my lvl 9 spells will cost me near 25pp, and I still have my<br/>
&gt;newbie armor, and a rusty warhammer, nothing else...to get all leather<br/>
&gt;armor would cost me around 25-30pp...I&#39;m currently lvl 7, and I have<br/>
&gt;10pp to my name.  It&#39;s a start, yes, but no where near where it needs to<br/>
&gt;be.<br/>
&gt;Even after this, how did you get money for the more exp spells?<br/>
&gt;This money issue is driving me crazy.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Heh i had the very same money problem at your level and i accepted<br/>
it. I bought the spells first and only then i thought about buying upgrades<br/>
to my armor. At level 14 my warrior friend asked me why am i still wearing<br/>
that leather armor. After that level i started to get some decent loot and<br/>
got banded armor quite fast and kept that until reaching level 20 and then<br/>
i started looking for some bronze... still missing a few pieces. Right now<br/>
i have about 180pp... not much. Runnyeye Citadel was the place i got<br/>
most of my money since people are really after the black iron armor.<br/>
