<div id="ygrps-yiv-2142955690">I agree with other posters - don&#39;t beg.  I&#39;ve received gifts from other<br/>
players in two circumstances.  The first, I randomly grouped with an<br/>
enchanter who&#39;s player also had a high level druid.  After talking a while,<br/>
then enchanter said he had absolutely no shortage of pp.  To prove his<br/>
point, he gave everyone in the group like 10pp.  We all said thanks.  After<br/>
thanking him, he then gave each of us 50pp.  The second time I received a<br/>
gift was after helping someone recover a corpse.  I died in the attempt, but<br/>
they got their corpse back.  When I recovered my corpse, she asked if there<br/>
was anything she could give me in payment.  I said don&#39;t worry about it.<br/>
She insisted and gave me a pair of +3 dex bracelets.<br/>
 <br/>
Do good deeds or others, and they will often return the favor.<br/>

I find that really amazing, I occasionally get a little bit of help when it<br/>
comes to equipment, something like ringmail that someone doesn&#39;t need<br/>
anymore, but never that much equipment or PP. Sometimes I wonder about that,<br/>
my friends get free stuff all the time, is it the way you ask or something?<br/>
