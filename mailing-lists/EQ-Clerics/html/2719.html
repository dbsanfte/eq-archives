<div id="ygrps-yiv-1049447400">YES, the Platinum Bars MUST be Enchanted by a lvl 34+ Enchanter.  I found it<br/>
is best to just buy them for you as they only cost the Enchanter about<br/>
105pp, and a non-guild/friend Enchanter will only charge 10-15pp on top of<br/>
that for enchanting them.  If you /hail Gavel, he will tell you who in the<br/>
Temple to give the enchanted platinum bars to in order to get the<br/>
appropriate piece in return (vulcanized, magnetized, etc).  Although, please<br/>
note that the proper people do not respond to questions about the type of<br/>
platinum they give in return.  You just have to trust (remember) what Gavel<br/>
says.</div>
