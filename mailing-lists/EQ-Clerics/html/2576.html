<div id="ygrps-yiv-783310162">This is really likely a question that you all will think I am wierd in<br/>
asking but it has been gnawing at me for a couple of days now.<br/>
<br/>
What determines the damage that a spell does?<br/>
<br/>
The reason I am asking this is that I remember talking with a 16th level<br/>
cleric a couple of weeks ago who stated that they did 104 pts damage with<br/>
Expulse Undead.   When I first got the spell at 14 I was doing max of 89 and<br/>
now at 15 it is up to 90.  I know that the damage is therefore a little<br/>
dependent on age.   Does wisdom or any other stat have some impact on the<br/>
maximum damage that we can do?  I am really tempted to remove my few wisdom<br/>
enhancing items to see if it drops but then again if it is based on natural<br/>
wisdom then this would not tell me anything at all.<br/>
<br/>
Well I am off to see if I can make it 16th again.   Some advice to all.  Do<br/>
not let an air elemental ambush you as you are running to retrieve your<br/>
body.<br/>
