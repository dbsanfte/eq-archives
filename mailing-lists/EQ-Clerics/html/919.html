<div id="ygrps-yiv-444510672">Er, it is still quite RP to buff and heal an inkie if they don&#39;t want it.<br/>
Isn&#39;t it RP for a follower of Karana (or whatever) to want to go against the<br/>
wishes of a follower of Innoruuk? <br/>

&gt;     No immature is when you give a player all your buffs just <br/>
&gt; becuase they<br/>
&gt; wanted to RP and didn&#39;t want your help and yes it does ruin the Rping<br/>
&gt; enviroment. And we are not going ot turn this into some kind <br/>
&gt; of  blown out<br/>
&gt; argument just becuase you think that my life is this game. </span></blockquote></div>
