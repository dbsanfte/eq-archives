&gt; head :<br/>
&gt; runed circlet AC:4, +4 int, +4 wis<br/>
&gt; crown of leaves AC:1 +5 wisdom<br/>
&gt; Zaharn&#39;s Coronet AC:5 +3 str, +25 mana<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would go with either the runed circlet or the crown of leaves, NOT<br/>
Zaharn&#39;s Coronet... you said that 5 wisdom=25 mana.. this isn&#39;t really true.<br/>
Every level you get each point of wisdom counts for more.<br/>
The formula to calculate our mana is ((wisdom/5)+2) * level.   I would<br/>
probably choose the runed circlet becasue it is only one wisdom less and has<br/>
more AC.   When you get a few more levels and into your 30&#39;s you can camp<br/>
the nightshade wreath if you really want to have +5/+5 instead of +4/+4.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Another question,<br/>
&gt; Do you think gatorscale leggings are better than the cleric legs?<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s a AC 4 reduction, but an increase in +4 wisdom.  Just curious on<br/>
&gt; everyone&#39;s thoughts on this one.  Does gatorscale look like leather?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>there is no doubt in my mind whatsoever that the gator legs are better.<br/>
Some will argue with me on this point i&#39;m about to make, but in my opinion<br/>
AC is not all that important.  At least the way I play I find that I am<br/>
becoming more and more of a caster every level and I hardly melee at all<br/>
now.  When something is on me i&#39;m shouting at my group to get it off so I<br/>
can heal them.  Since (ideally) I&#39;m not getting hit all that much AC is less<br/>
important.  The argument could be made that more AC would help you take hits<br/>
and thus give your group more time to get stuff off of you.  However, the 4<br/>
AC isn&#39;t that huge of a difference... the cleric legs give +intelligence<br/>
which is totally useless to a cleric.   Take the +wisdom... IMHO you should<br/>
always take the Wisdom above just about anything else.   Another good point<br/>
of the gator legs is that they only weigh 0.2 (or was it 0.4?) , and if you<br/>
are anything like me you are always encumbered and it&#39;s nice to have such<br/>
nice gear weigh so little.<br/>
