<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-914063598">I&#39;ve been reading Plane of Fear is so buggy it crashes a lot.  If this is<br/>
true then why doesn&#39;t Verant fix it instade of getting rdy to put up Plane<br/>
of Hate?  Also if this is true then why would anyone want to travel in<br/>
there?  I&#39;d be to afraid that I&#39;d get in there kinda far just to have it<br/>
crash andwhen I got back on to find out that I had been killed and have to<br/>
run the risk of going back in there to get my corpse and have the zone crash<br/>
again.<br/>
Has anyone of you had this problem in Plane of Fear?<br/>
