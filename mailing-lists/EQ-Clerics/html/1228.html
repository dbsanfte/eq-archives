<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-317689820">I wholeheartedly agreee with you Bree.  That is one good thing about this list,<br/>
more than any other.  We seems to take things very much to heart, and give our<br/>
opinions openly, but do not attack people for having opinions that differ from<br/>
our own.  PC begging  just gets to be too much sometimes for me.  That&#39;s just my<br/>
reaction to it.  That doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s not a viable option for others,<br/>
just don&#39;t beg from me without an equal &quot;Roleplaying&quot; reaction to being asked.<br/>
My favorite is this:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Tunare does not bless those that seek the easy path in life.  Idle hands are<br/>
the Innoruuk&#39;s friend, young one.  Since you are not one of those vile dark<br/>
elves, I should think you would not worship the King of Hate.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Go out and make your hands into the instrument of Tunare- slay the evil you<br/>
find!  When the Mother of All deems you worthy, you too can have items like<br/>
mine.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Above all else you will learn in this life, this lesson is very simple- LEAVE<br/>
ME ALONE!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have to use two or three socials buttons for this (depending on my mood), but<br/>
I often take the 30 seconds or so to change some of my group say buttons when I<br/>
know I will be going into town.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mean to disrespect all our Dark Elf brethren, but begging often happens<br/>
in cities (especially around the banks) and since my character has only been to<br/>
the &quot;good&quot; cities, has only been begged by &quot;good&quot; races.  This is purely a<br/>
roleplaying thing I do with newbies that beg, not something I preach when trying<br/>
to convert our Dark Elf Rogue to the ways of the light.  She&#39;s such a pretty<br/>
little thing- I can&#39;t stand to see her praying to the God of Hate-   hehehe<br/>

In reply to:<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
I feel everyone has a right to their own opinions and that everyone<br/>
should have fun in the game no matter what anyone else thinks of them or<br/>
their practices. This is a forum for us to help each other, and for us to<br/>
debate issues.  I like having issues that I want to respond to(gives me<br/>
something to do while downtimes at work), shhhh, don&#39;t tell my boss.  I like<br/>
a good debate, it is healthy.  Enough said and onto another subject :-)<br/>
