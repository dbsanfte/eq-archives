<div id="ygrps-yiv-804961364">I hope that people on that sever who can hunt the<br/>
planes now know not to hunt on that day, because it<br/>
can mean their deaths...continue with the sit-in.<br/>

P.S.  You are asking the majority of clerics (over 3k<br/>
in people, I&#39;m am guessing) to not do this because<br/>
maybe 20 people on the Fenn Ro server want to hunt in<br/>
the planes on that day?...it is not happening.<br/>

&gt; I have a very old friend who contributes to the<br/>
&gt; Guide program. Naturally, I<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t say who, but in the interest of preventing a<br/>
&gt; similar fiasco as with<br/>
&gt; the Monk sit-in, I will confirm that players in<br/>
&gt; Fenin&#39;s Fear Plane were<br/>
&gt; lagged out due to over-loading network resources on<br/>
&gt; the server which houses<br/>
&gt; both Fear and West Freeport.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The server didn&#39;t crash, the network resources were<br/>
&gt; overloaded, and so<br/>
&gt; people lagged out, leaving the Fear Plane with a<br/>
&gt; half-linkdead party, which<br/>
&gt; died, followed by people reconnecting into Fear as a<br/>
&gt; now very lonely, and<br/>
&gt; shortly after very dead, person.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Fear plane did not crash itself - that would have<br/>
&gt; made the players safe -<br/>
&gt; because Fear does not populate for some time after a<br/>
&gt; reboot. Instead, the<br/>
&gt; overload of players on the server caused the tragic<br/>
&gt; and needless deaths of<br/>
&gt; people who just wanted to enjoy the game, and made<br/>
&gt; their corpse recovery<br/>
&gt; even harsher.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Clerics and Necromancers, I urge you - find a better<br/>
&gt; way to protest. You are<br/>
&gt; going down a path which will, again, bring needless<br/>
&gt; suffering on those who<br/>
&gt; are not participating. Non-violent protest is<br/>
&gt; admirable, but if it causes<br/>
&gt; death, its no longer non-violent, is it?<br/>
&gt; -----<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I believe a sit-in, now that it is known that it<br/>
&gt; causes problems to other<br/>
&gt; players, is not a good way to protest. Please invent<br/>
&gt; another form of<br/>
&gt; peaceful protest, for the sake of others!<br/>
