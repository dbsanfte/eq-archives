<b>Subject:</b> Suggestions for high teen levels in unrest? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1792419699">I have heard from many many people that unrest is a great place for a cleric <br/>
to go starting around 14 or so.  I am 17th (almost 18th) and am having <br/>
serious trouble there.  Last night 6 people from my guild were there, all <br/>
15-20 and we had a rough time.<br/>
<br/>
We were at the back wall pulling from the back door.  We had SoW and invis <br/>
to undead on the puller at all times, but there were many times where she <br/>
ended up bringing quite a few too many ghouls.  (tried to pull 1 and <br/>
suddenly there were 7 of them on us!)<br/>
<br/>
Are we hunting at too high a level, or are we pulling from the wrong place?  <br/>
Or do we just suck?  We only had 2 deaths last night, but many many many <br/>
close calls.  Lets just say thank god our druid was also saving 50% mana for <br/>
heals.<br/>
