<div id="ygrps-yiv-1775961285">I moved thru 22-25 pretty quickly solo&#39;n the 3 named bandits in that cave<br/>
across from High Keep in HHP. It&#39;s pretty easy for a cleric to spread out<br/>
the spawn to where you have one about every 5 mins. And if things do get<br/>
ugly, you have a zone and guards right there. There&#39;s also a vendor & bank<br/>
in Keep. The bandits drop some coin, but more importantly the occasional<br/>
bronze weapon and gemstone. Once you get the spawns spread out, you want to<br/>
work inside the cave, since there&#39;s a roaming guard outside that will steal<br/>
your kill.<br/>
Once they don&#39;t give good exp anymore, just move into Keep. Sure it&#39;s<br/>
boring, it&#39;s a great place to level. And loot includes plat coin, fs weapons<br/>
and small bronze armor as you move down into warrior room and then raider<br/>
room. And while you&#39;re waiting in line for a group, there a named prisoner<br/>
you can solo back in the jail area that will give you exp til about lev 32.<br/>

PS: Another nice thing about workin in the HHP/HHK area at these levels is<br/>
you&#39;re close to the spawn for the Testament. Once you get your bandit spawns<br/>
timed out, you can easily run to smuggler room to check for the gaurd<br/>
between spawns.<br/>

Is there a good place to solo for a cleric (myself, namely &lt;g&gt;) at<br/>
level 22?  DW crocs and caimans are still blue, but those are fairly<br/>
camped, and I noticed that one was green to me the other day, so they<br/>
are not ideal.  I can&#39;t think of any place else where I would get xp,<br/>
or that would be solo-able.<br/>
<br/>
thanks</div>
