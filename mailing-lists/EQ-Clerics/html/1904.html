<div id="ygrps-yiv-102221572">At higher level we do become a member of the &quot;back row&quot; along with every other<br/>
pure casting class.  Our specialty is healing, others are DD, shaman and druids<br/>
DOT, enchanters do crowd control, shaman and enchanters debuff.  If you were to<br/>
use a combination casting and tanking on a level 35+ MOB, you&#39;d be beaten down<br/>
pretty quick.  This is not only true for us, but for melee classes too.<br/>
<br/>
Rangers get it a little better off- they can snare and run backwards shooting<br/>
arrows into the thing (Ranger kiting).  Clerics become a &quot;Root N Nuke&quot; caster<br/>
for soloing at the higher levels, much like the wizard.  I can solo a SG or HG<br/>
pretty easily (past level 44) but I won&#39;t melee it (okay, it was almost dead and<br/>
I wanted to raise my 2hb skill a little- lol)  No melee class (unless they have<br/>
PoF weapons and armor) can solo these things- they just hit too hard.   Double<br/>
and triple attacks for 80-90 damage is just too much even for a warrior to stand<br/>
up against.<br/>
<br/>
Now, take a warrior and a cleric- put them together and they can take 3-4 giants<br/>
in the time it takes a cleric to solo one.  Very efficient and good for the exp<br/>
bar :)<br/>
