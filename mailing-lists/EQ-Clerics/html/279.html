    Umm money, heheheh thats something you won&#39;t see much of Bro&#39; until<br/>
about lvl 25 Im lvl 21 and only have like 230pp in my name and I just made<br/>
all of it at lvl 20 selling  Skulls of Jhen&#39;Tra,and runed totem staffs (once<br/>
you hit lvl 20 go to Rake Rathtear fight gnoll Ebalmers (easy) for the<br/>
skulls and high shamans for the staffs)(also easy) then at night when all<br/>
the undead come out fight Dry Bones where you can find small bronze pieces<br/>
which sell for a good penny. Okay but for your lvl have no fear I have a<br/>
great place for you to make money man take the boat from Eruridan&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;wait<br/>
I can explain this easier whereever you are Qeynos or Euridan take the boat<br/>
until you hit thje island withj the cat ppl fight wisp!! great money you get<br/>
lightstones and Greater lightstones sell the light stones to the cat vendor<br/>
for about 7gp then take the G. Lightstones and sell them to the ppl in<br/>
either Euridan or Qeynos try the hills or BB..WARNING: DON&quot;T attack teh<br/>
Kerran Beetles(catsa hate it fopr some reason and will attack you.. Also<br/>
dont mess with teh spiders they are a bitch poison + hiot hard as hell you<br/>
can also fight the zombies on the other side of the dock.....)Umm you may<br/>
want to wait till about lvl 10 for wisp but you can try them just use all<br/>
your mana to ...??? use your Direct Damage spell forgot the name.Watch out<br/>
though wisp will group and that hurts you can fight them all the way to lvl<br/>
14:)Then go to freeport and ask me later where to lvl. Oh to any one out<br/>
there who can give me a pointer on where to fight at lvl 21 I&#39;ve tried<br/>
mistmoore hard to find a group  and tried unrest got tired of the damn<br/>
goblins killing me when I had to walk there and trains there are awful. Any<br/>
tips??<br/>

&gt;Hi, After playing about 3 characters, I decided to make another, and so<br/>
&gt;far I really like my cleric.  One problem I  can&#39;t seem to solve is the<br/>
&gt;money issue.  How did u guys get the spells and armor you  needed?  I<br/>
&gt;figure my lvl 9 spells will cost me near 25pp, and I still have my<br/>
&gt;newbie armor, and a rusty warhammer, nothing else...to get all leather<br/>
&gt;armor would cost me around 25-30pp...I&#39;m currently lvl 7, and I have<br/>
&gt;10pp to my name.  It&#39;s a start, yes, but no where near where it needs to<br/>
&gt;be.<br/>
&gt;Even after this, how did you get money for the more exp spells?<br/>
&gt;This money issue is driving me crazy.<br/>
