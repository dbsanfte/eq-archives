<div id="ygrps-yiv-602147513">I have a friend who is a L50 Pally and he loves his char (he even <br/>
     managed to get the pally legs).  Pallys have the highest hp next to <br/>
     warriors (can buff them over 2000) and can do good damage with the <br/>
     right equip.  My friend has a haste sash and uses the holy water <br/>
     sprinkler mace from the plane of hate (killer 1h blunt weapon that <br/>
     clerics can&#39;t use :( ).  High level tanks aren&#39;t meant to deal out a <br/>
     lot of damage, they are meant to absorb it while magic users decimate <br/>
     the mobs with spells.  In Hate and Fear it&#39;s always the group with the <br/>
     most magic users (necro&#39;s especially) that end up getting the kills.<br/>
     <br/>
     I know when I play with my pally friend he may not deal out the damage <br/>
     as fast as some other classes but he can stand in there and take the <br/>
     hits with the best of them.  With a cleric throwing complete heals a <br/>
     pally can stand in the battle a very long time and deal out or allow <br/>
     others to deal out a lot of damage.<br/>
     <br/>
     Besides, who doesn&#39;t like a little help healing others up after the <br/>
     battle is finished.<br/>
     <br/>
     I also have a friend who is a L50 shadowknight and the same thing goes <br/>
     for them (except the healing).  The other day we were out in ocean of <br/>
     tears killing Seafury Cyclopes by ourselves.  These things have over <br/>
     3k hp and are L39-42 or so.  We could kill one with me only using 1 <br/>
     1/2 bubbles of mana which equates to about 2 complete heals while <br/>
     meding through the battle.  Does this sound like they can&#39;t deal out <br/>
     damage? (was useing a mirthil 2 hander)<br/>
