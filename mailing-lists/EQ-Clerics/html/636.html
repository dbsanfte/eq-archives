<div id="ygrps-yiv-1919441295">Maybe we can just get over this and go on with something that has to do with<br/>
Clerics and not English 101!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the best course of action would have been for those who responded, to<br/>
have done so with private e-mail. You have to know that making this a public<br/>
issue would insight others to follow and for the target of this to become<br/>
defensive.<br/>
<br/>
End it now please!</div>
