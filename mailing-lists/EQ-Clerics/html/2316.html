<div id="ygrps-yiv-733135942">Last time I leveled I went back to Freeport to train. Not knowing the area<br/>
very well I managed to go to the Paladin&#39;s guild instead of the cleric&#39;s<br/>
guild without realizing it (yes, I know, not very clever but it was very<br/>
late). I located a trainer there and the system allowed her to train me.<br/>
Just curious if any one else has done this and if this might allow a player<br/>
to literally use any guild to train in. This has ,embarrassingly enough,<br/>
worked twice for me.<br/>
