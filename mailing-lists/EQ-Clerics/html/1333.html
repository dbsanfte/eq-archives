<div id="ygrps-yiv-1365424828"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; and yes....the SSOL&#39;s cleanse is an EFFECT....an effect is NOT coupled<br/>
 </span></blockquote>with<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; charges.  And dex means SQUAT...its a rumor.  I&#39;ve had the SSOL go off<br/>
&gt; constantly when burdened by Equipment than any other time.  (same goes for<br/>
&gt; the screaming mace)  The mace SHOULD have charges according to the<br/>
&gt; quest.....not my &quot;own&quot; ideas.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Simply because a weapon has an effect does not mean it has no (or doesn&#39;t<br/>
require) charges. I used the Midnight Mallet for a while and it had 5<br/>
charges of the walking sleep effect. I had to right-click on the mallet to<br/>
cause the effect.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of effects, has anyone else noticed that EQ seems to swap &#39;affect&#39;<br/>
with &#39;effect&#39;? Being as pedantic as I am, it annoys me every time I am told,<br/>
&#39;You cannot remove this affect&#39;. I have also noticed in Brad&#39;s posts to<br/>
alt.games.everquest that he uses effect instead of affect.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing is, DEX is not affected by encumbrance at all, AGI is. So if<br/>
a weapon effect is dependant on DEX, being heavy won&#39;t make a blind bit of<br/>
difference.<br/>
