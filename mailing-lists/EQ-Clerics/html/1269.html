<div id="ygrps-yiv-1689896346"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &quot;If a higher level player who would get no exp for the kill is camping a<br/>
&gt; spawn, and a group of players that would get exp (meaning they should be<br/>
&gt; there) wants to fight there, the higher level player must yield. The lower<br/>
&gt; level group has the right of way.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It sounds good in principle, but some things would have to be resolved. For<br/>
instance: my friend and I were camping the evil eyes in the gorge to get me<br/>
some PBBs. He is a level 30 wizard so he got no exp. I&#39;m only level 26 so I<br/>
did, but what if I had been a few levels higher? Does that mean that as soon<br/>
as some lower levels turned up we would have had to leave?<br/>
<br/>
This policy has noble intentions, but unfortunately I believe it would only<br/>
add to the list of things people complain about. Amending the policy so that<br/>
the group that was there first may stay regardless of level would make it<br/>
fairer, but also impossible to police.<br/>
