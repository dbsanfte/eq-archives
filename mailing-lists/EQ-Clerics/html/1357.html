<div id="ygrps-yiv-61732719">You know, just an aside, and not related to clerics in any way, but<br/>
I&#39;ve been a D&D dungeon master for about 10 years, and if I gave a<br/>
bag of holding (similar to a box of abu&#39;kar) in January and then<br/>
around March if I told him, &quot;Oh, I made a mistake on that.  Instead of<br/>
weighing nothing, it nows weighs half of what is inside.&quot; you can bet<br/>
that that player would be pretty pissed. It&#39;s no different here.  It<br/>
only shows lack of organization on Verant&#39;s part and poor testing.<br/>
EQ is a great game, but I&#39;ve never seen a company that is just so bad<br/>
at &quot;getting it&quot;.  Verant just doesn&#39;t &quot;get it&quot;.  They need to focus<br/>
their effort on making new quests and stop screwing with what they<br/>
already have.  The more they change things, the more bugs they are<br/>
going to introduce.  Take the testament of venear for example.  It has<br/>
apparently been changed to be equipable, but the quest appears to be<br/>
broke now.  Slick trick.<br/>
  Stabilize the damn game, and then add stuff to it.  So what if that<br/>
Druid spell was &quot;typo&#39;d&quot; at 39 instead of 49.  Big damn deal.  Just<br/>
leave it alone.  No one cares about their typos.  It&#39;s friggin game<br/>
for christ&#39;s sake.  It&#39;s not like we&#39;re dealing with health care<br/>
reform here.</div>
