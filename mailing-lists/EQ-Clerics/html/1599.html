 </span></blockquote>Seeing as I was level 26 myself for a week (finally got to 27 thank<br/>
goodness) I feel qualified to answer this question. :) I recommend going for<br/>
wisdom increasing armour.<br/>
<br/>
In the last couple of levels I have been replacing various bronze bits with<br/>
the following:<br/>
<br/>
Polished Bone bracelets<br/>
Lizardscale mantle<br/>
Blackened Iron medallion<br/>
Runed Circlet<br/>
<br/>
With the exception of the Runed Circlet, you can hunt for these items<br/>
yourself in a decent party. Luckily enough I have a high level friend who<br/>
gave me the circlet and is currently hunting me some gatorscale leggings.<br/>
<br/>
I also bought a couple of +3 wis earrings for 30pp each, which seems to be<br/>
the going rate on Fennin Ro. I&#39;m waiting around for a guild member to get<br/>
his JC up so I can get a platinum ruby veil at cost. My next investment<br/>
after that will be +6 wis rings.<br/>
<br/>
I would advise against purchasing any armour that has nothing but AC. If you<br/>
haven&#39;t already begun, you will find yourself less and less on the front<br/>
line in battle from now on, especially in the dungeons.<br/>
<br/>
But first get yourself a Testament of Vanear, if you don&#39;t already have one.<br/>
At level 26 you will have no problems at all, and if I&#39;m not mistaken it&#39;s<br/>
the highest +wis item you can hold in your left hand.<br/>
