<div id="ygrps-yiv-1553209676">Just be glad you&#39;re on Lvl 40, I&#39;m Lvl 16 and it seems like it MIGHT be<br/>
another 3-4 or more days to hit the next Lvl.  But I&#39;m not really wanting to<br/>
rush to Lvl 50, I&#39;m just having fun and getting Lvl&#39;s when I get them, if I<br/>
got a Lvl everyday hey that&#39;d be cool with me if it took me many days to hit<br/>
the next Lvl thats cool.  I do wanna get up to Lvl 24 fast tho but not real<br/>
fast, just wanna get it 24 so the look of my spells change.  I did find a<br/>
place that I can get nice exp (gotta be in a group of at least one or two<br/>
more), I like one in this area cause if it&#39;s more then 2 ppl in the group we<br/>
don&#39;t seem to get as much exp and it sux.  With me and my friend we get good<br/>
exp but let one other join and that exp goes bye-bye.<br/>
But I think everyone should just take their time on getting to Lvl 50, cause<br/>
what happens when you hit 50?  Thats it no more, I mean you can still play<br/>
it but I&#39;d say after a while it&#39;s bound to get boring.  Can&#39;t Lvl anymore,<br/>
won&#39;t be getting any exp all you can do is get money and weapons and armor<br/>
and hope Verant up&#39;s the Lvl limit.  But from what I&#39;ve read they don&#39;t even<br/>
know if they will up it at all.  In a way I think they should tho, I&#39;d say<br/>
if they do it should be up to Lvl 75 to a 100 and thats all.  Of course once<br/>
you hit Lvl 50 you can start a new character or just work on one you already<br/>
have and get him/her to 50.<br/>
But I know some likes to play and get Lvl&#39;s fast some of us likes to play<br/>
and get Lvl&#39;s just whenever.  So other words play it however you have the<br/>
most fun!  And enjoy the game!  =)<br/>
