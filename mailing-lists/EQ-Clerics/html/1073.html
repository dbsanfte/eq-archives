<div id="ygrps-yiv-1724039954">I will tell you this if you look up invulnerable in the dictionary it means<br/>
that your can no long take damamge. Verant sees stunning as a non damage<br/>
tactic so therefore don&#39;t waste your time holding your breath cause its<br/>
never gonna be fixed. I&#39;ve been petitioning about it since beta 4 and no<br/>
such luck its not happening. Sorry to burst your bubble.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Well, I know I just got stunned 3 times in the same period of invuln today<br/>
&gt; running from a train in unrest that was all blue, no greens.  So I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; think that has much to do with it.  And I&#39;d say at this point if it&#39;s not<br/>
&gt; been fixed by Verant, I&#39;m personally not holding my breath to see<br/>
&gt; it happen.<br/>
