<div id="ygrps-yiv-1264262480">not to mention no confirmed reports of the fiery avenger have even been<br/>
SHOWN yet....no one has shown brad wielding the fiery avenger....(aka no one<br/>
looked at him and right clicked the damn sword CORRECT?)  not to mention<br/>
brad himself said it is a quest that has been around for a while now and<br/>
they RECENTLY made it possibly easier to find....since no one HAS yet.  This<br/>
is a downgrade from previous statements:  &quot;No one is close to even receiving<br/>
this yet.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
After seeing gods killed, I would think that we should be able to find most<br/>
EQ, and I&#39;m sorry, but the gods themselves seem easier than the creatures<br/>
they CREATE (aka- dragons)<br/>

How do you know that there isn&#39;t a Ranger-ONLY weapon that looks like<br/>
&quot;flaming&quot; two-handed sword?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; shows him wearing the new Ranger armor but in his hand was the SoulFire<br/>
&gt; which is a Pally only weapon.  Can we say cheating?  Now if one of us <br/>
