<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-366064506">Hi, After playing about 3 characters, I decided to make another, and so<br/>
far I really like my cleric.  One problem I  can&#39;t seem to solve is the<br/>
money issue.  How did u guys get the spells and armor you  needed?  I<br/>
figure my lvl 9 spells will cost me near 25pp, and I still have my<br/>
newbie armor, and a rusty warhammer, nothing else...to get all leather<br/>
armor would cost me around 25-30pp...I&#39;m currently lvl 7, and I have<br/>
10pp to my name.  It&#39;s a start, yes, but no where near where it needs to<br/>
be.<br/>
Even after this, how did you get money for the more exp spells?<br/>
This money issue is driving me crazy.<br/>
