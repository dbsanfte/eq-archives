<div id="ygrps-yiv-1907103545">well, i must say it doesn&#39;t get any easier to choose as it goes along....I<br/>
always have gate and divine aura memd....a DD spell,  a healing spell, at<br/>
least one buff, and typically stun.....Alot depends on the group you are<br/>
with and whether you are hunting undead or not....also whenever i get a new<br/>
heal spell keep 2 memorized as the new one usually take s a lot of mana, for<br/>
example when i turned lvl 24 i got greater healing....i am now lvl 31...from<br/>
24 until now i used both healing and greater healing...at this lvl my mana<br/>
is much greater as well as the amount of HP my tanks have, so reg healing<br/>
does not help much except with the pure casters since they don&#39;t have as<br/>
many HP.....<br/>
I often will alternate buffs throughout, cause i can change them quickly<br/>
while medding, i will beef everyone up with bravery sit med and mem gaurd,<br/>
then cast on the party with that, so i have more room for spell that are<br/>
going to be used during the battle.<br/>
Best advice i think it to try different things, see what you&#39;re most<br/>
comfortable with and you will find a balance with your spells and what you<br/>
require to function as an effective cleric.<br/>

&gt;Hi yall, i&#39;ve been playing EQ for sometime now - but never a cleric<br/>
&gt;until one i just started. I noticed we have like 15 spells that are<br/>
&gt;casted often and i can&#39;t decide on what to keep memmed at all times.<br/>
&gt;please let me know what you all have memmed or any suggestions =)<br/>
