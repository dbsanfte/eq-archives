<div id="ygrps-yiv-93850439">Yes I too found that out, had to put back my friends list and reset my gama<br/>
but thats was all really for me I don&#39;t mess with hot keys too much.  So<br/>
bewarned if you delete your *.opt files you&#39;ll have to re-do all that stuff,<br/>
but you don&#39;t have to delete them if you&#39;re not disconnecting all the time<br/>
while zoning or camping.<br/>

&gt; I zoned out of north ro into east commons and my machine locked up<br/>
&gt; hard last night.  Had to reset.  I removed all my .opt files (there<br/>
&gt; were 3 of them [ more if you have more characters]) and one of them<br/>
&gt; was for all my configuration.  So when I went into the game, my<br/>
&gt; resolution was back at 640x480 and my friends list was gone, and all<br/>
&gt; my hot-keys were undefined.<br/>

&gt; &gt;For those that didn&#39;t see the banner on EQ today, they said if you keep<br/>
&gt; &gt;getting disconnected while zoning or camping to deleted your *.opt files<br/>
