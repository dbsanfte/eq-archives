<div id="ygrps-yiv-1371618342">the only way we can fight is HUGE downtimes for mana/health/mana.  (We fight<br/>
using spells, and then have to heal (healing during the battle, though<br/>
needed, doesnt let us do the precious damage we need to win solo...and is a<br/>
NASTY circle...)  And after the fight we need to coupe health ASAP, and our<br/>
mana.....equipment for me is just wis increasing so I have MORE mana to<br/>
fight with as I go on.  I tend to begin to ignore AC like a real caster does<br/>
simply because we try not to get into fights ANYWAY...and if we do....and<br/>
the tanks cant pull em off, we&#39;re kinda screwed.....so divine aura....head<br/>
for zone, or hope a tank can get em off as I try for safe area to recover<br/>
body.<br/>

The equipment is irrelevant since our Weapon skill lags so far behind.<br/>
Regardless of the equipment you use, a high level cleric will miss quite<br/>
often.  It is pretty pointless to try and develop a &quot;fighter/healer&quot; type,<br/>
because around level 25 it stops working and only gets worse with levels.<br/>

&gt; I have the opportunity to buy items off Ebay that would give me<br/>
&gt; outstanding stats as far as strength, agility and dexterity go. I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; talking 115 str, 130 dex and 125 agi (and 85 sta), all wearable at the<br/>
&gt; same time. However, my wisdom would be only 105.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; On the other hand, I also have the opportunity to buy wisdom items that<br/>
&gt; would increase my wisdom by 35 points (to about 136). Which path should<br/>
&gt; I follow? Some people argue that high level clerics CAN melee, while<br/>
&gt; others argue that at high levels, clerics should concentrate on their<br/>
&gt; healing and buffing skills. &quot;After all, if you wanted to be a warrior,<br/>
&gt; you should have been one.&quot; Yeah, yeah, heard that, been there. With the<br/>
&gt; right equipment, though (Jboots, a flowing black sash of haste, an<br/>
&gt; observer&#39;s staff, etc.), a cleric should be able to hold his or her own<br/>
&gt; in combat, even after level 35.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Any suggestions, comments, advice before I commit to one group of items<br/>
&gt; or the other?<br/>
