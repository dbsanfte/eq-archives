<div id="ygrps-yiv-1866928593">For the record, No I was not being sarcastic and again No, I have never <br/>
worked in any aspect on the production or creation of any type of RPG.<br/>
<br/>
I for one would not want the job if all i could create is disatsfied <br/>
customers, True there will always be people who are dissatisfied, cannot <br/>
please everyone, but Verant knows that no matter what they do to the game, <br/>
there will always be new players and people will always continue playing. I <br/>
will tell you right now why I play, it is definitely not because of the <br/>
great gaming experience they provide me that is for sure, I play EQ because <br/>
there are people that play that I care about, who are my friends.  EQ is our <br/>
forum to get together, most of us met through EQ, i did know some others <br/>
beforehand. Being in states that are so far away, we cannot just say &quot;lets <br/>
go out for a movie this friday&quot; so We choose to play EQ to spend time <br/>
together<br/>
.(too bad all my friends didn&#39;t get into phase 2 AC beta, then we could all <br/>
hang out there) I was however a Guide for a period of time, which i enjoyed, <br/>
but had to leave due to getting a FT RL job. But, I was able to see first <br/>
hand the frustration that many players had and I personally could do nothing <br/>
about it.  I wish I could have.<br/>
<br/>
**Addendum to the original note in this thread:<br/>
       I did play last night and I found that the duration of my buffs were <br/>
the same as always, for this I was pleased. I was also happy to see that the <br/>
rares spawns were working again, in various dungeons. I am pleased to see <br/>
that Verant added more emotes and that now people with the forage skill are <br/>
getting new and interesting things. So, yes i get mad when they nerf the <br/>
classes, but they do do somethings to increase the enjoyment of the game. I <br/>
just wish they would stop messing with everyones class.<br/>
<br/>
Just my thoughts,<br/>
