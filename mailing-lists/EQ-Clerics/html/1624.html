&quot;I have a level 14 druid and she hunted from 9 to just under 13 in <br/>
Steamfront.  Its not overly crowded and plenty of mobs to choose from.<br/>
If <br/>
you can get a group the Mino Cave is good as well. There is also a small<br/>
spawn point where some undead spawn, just be careful as the Mino Hero<br/>
spawns <br/>
near there as well.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
That undead spawning point you speak of is an excellent camping spot.<br/>
Just pay close attention to the shouts about the Mino Hero being loose.<br/>
If you hear one of these, please run, cause he will find you even if you<br/>
are hiding behind that big, rusty cog. I should know, he always found me<br/>
