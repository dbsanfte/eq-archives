<div id="ygrps-yiv-1770585378">I would suggest you just buy the medallion, as they are fairly cheap (around<br/>
20p I think), and go camp the EXG and efreet in sol a.  It&#39;s pretty easy to<br/>
camp both at once if you have a group and you just might get a guardian<br/>
shield (9wis) and plat armband (3wis).  You should be able to camp these at<br/>
your level with a decent group.  Just remember that the EXG has a very high<br/>
magic resist so you have to melee it.<br/>

P.S. If you need directions just ask Ilystil.<br/>
