 </span></blockquote>Well, you are in the wrong class if you are big on looks my friend, until<br/>
you can get to PoF and get the Mist Armor.<br/>
You wanna be a good cleric? Mostly likely the answer is yes.<br/>
Then you will look like a newbie.<br/>
Any items with Wis increasing stats are going to look incredibly ridiculous<br/>
Now, i should have gone to fear by now myself, unfortunately my regular<br/>
group is not high enough to go as of yet(our lowest person is lvl45)<br/>
-But i am still wearing Gator legs (wis stat, looks like leather)<br/>
-BS tunic( wis stat ,red chain, should be getting runed Mith tunic soon)<br/>
-Runed mithril bracers(wis stat, lavender plate)<br/>
-Dwarven Wboots(no wis, but can&#39;t get the efreeti boots yet, they are<br/>
silver in color on me as a human)<br/>
-Snakeskin Gloves(adds dex, don&#39;t know of any Wis gloves, they have the look<br/>
of leather)<br/>
<br/>
One good thing is I don&#39;t have Newbies looking at my stuff constantly, but<br/>
that is only because I look like a complete ass in my armor.<br/>
