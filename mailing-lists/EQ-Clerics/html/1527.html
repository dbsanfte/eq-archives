<div id="ygrps-yiv-728240969">Thanks for the tips.<br/>
<br/>
Before I play EQ, I always do a few things:<br/>
<br/>
1) Disable Task Scheduler.<br/>
2) Turn off Wetsocks (my weather program)<br/>
3) Turn off ICQ.<br/>
<br/>
However, I never thought about the virus scanner. I should try that. And<br/>
here I am calling myself a software developer :)<br/>
<br/>
I also try not to do too much before playing.  For instance, if the computer<br/>
has been on for a while, or I have surfed the net, run other software,<br/>
checked e-mail, I usually reboot.  Thats because I don&#39;t trust win 98 to<br/>
clean up its memory on its own.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the tips, I&#39;ll try turning off te virus checker.<br/>

If your lag meter is fine, but you&#39;re getting pauses like this, it points to<br/>
your PC config.<br/>
A few things to try:<br/>
 <br/>
1. Do you have a resident virus checker and what are its settings? Or do you<br/>
have some other kind of scheduled CPU/disk/memory hog?<br/>
2. Do you have IPX drivers installed? I used to get a bad pausing problem in<br/>
all games. It went away when I uninstalled the IPX drivers (I didn&#39;t really<br/>
need them and you probably don&#39;t unless you run on an old Netware network).<br/>
3. Before you run EQ, reboot and clear your taskbar of resident stuff.</div>
