<div id="ygrps-yiv-95168538">I agree completely, but with my experience as a warrior, I will take it even<br/>
further.  Though in real life, I am unsure how Divine Aura would manifest<br/>
itself, I know that in EQ, you CANNOT stun an opponent in melee without<br/>
causing damage, EXCEPT in the case of a Cleric with DA on.<br/>
<br/>
This eliminates all arguments to me, except for the one that Geoffrey<br/>
gave......One of the creators of the game didnt want the spell to have that<br/>
ability.  Simple as that.  Believe me, I want it changed as much or more as<br/>
the next guy (I sincerely think it makes NO sense), but the creators have<br/>
made an arbitration here, and that is that, as they say.<br/>

&gt; Sorry, can&#39;t agree with you on the stun issue either.  Doesn&#39;t make ANY<br/>
&gt; sense to me, much less total as it does to you. If you have been given the<br/>
&gt; ability by the gods to put a &quot;divine&quot; shield around yourself and make<br/>
&gt; yourself invulnerable from being hit, then you shouldn&#39;t be able to be<br/>
&gt; stunned because the critter MUST hit you to stun you.  Quite simply, you<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t get stunned if you can&#39;t get hit.  Now, if they would&#39;ve said Divine<br/>
&gt; Aura is strictly a spell to prevent you from taking any DAMAGE from a hit<br/>
&gt; but not to prevent you from BEING hit, then that is different.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  But in my opinion, if we have the ability to cloak ourselves from damage,<br/>
&gt; it should include ALL damage, including stuns.  Because stun to me IS a<br/>
form<br/>
&gt; of damage even though it does not reduce your hps.  It renders you<br/>
incapable<br/>
&gt; of moving, which to me, is STILL a type of damage. Just like the blinding<br/>
&gt; light spell.....its effects, aka damage, aren&#39;t reflected in loss of hps<br/>
but<br/>
&gt; it DOES damage to you by rendering you incapable of seeing.<br/>
