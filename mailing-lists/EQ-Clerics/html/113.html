<div id="ygrps-yiv-888821974">The peacekeeper staff is a paladin/cleric quest in Erudin, in the temple of<br/>
light.  From there you take a letter to a merchant in Tox forest.  He gives<br/>
you the first piece, and tells you need to make it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;<br/>
I was also wondering how to make the Peace Keeper Staff. I know that it is<br/>
better than a Glowing Crook Staff and I was wondering if anyone knew how to<br/>
build it. Can u give me location of parts and how to assemble. Thanks a<br/>
bunch !<br/>
