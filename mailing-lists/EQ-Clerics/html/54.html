<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-79407922">First Off i like to say High to all fellow Clerics. Im a 29th Cleric on Mith <br/>
Marr server. SO far there are only 2 magical 1 handed weapons in the game we <br/>
can use besides all the normal ones and are spells. We all know about the <br/>
screaming mace, but i would like to Add about the Enamaled Black Mace which <br/>
i currently have, does 8 damage, 28 speed and magical. Now i can rip some <br/>
ass with this weapon. Not to mention im doing 198 damage with my new Wrath <br/>
spell which is a upgrade from Smite. Now i need to stress that you toss the <br/>
2H weapons and start working on 1H. At high levels you are going to need <br/>
shields for sure, the more magic resistance you have the safer you will be. <br/>
Right now i have a mistmoor shield which gives +10 Ac +10 resistance to <br/>
Magic, Disease & poison. Believe me anyone that has been to Mistmoor knows <br/>
that you need all the magic Resistance you can get. Not to mention we get <br/>
buff spells, so currently when im fighting i have 60 resistance and seeing <br/>
you resist 3 Shock Of Force spells in a row makes you breath a little bit <br/>
better :)<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has any questions about spells or anything give me a shout<br/>
