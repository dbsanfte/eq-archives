 </span></blockquote>Man, I can&#39;t believe your luck at getting Gull so easily and then getting<br/>
the bracers both in 4 hours... Zahal never spawns... but i haven&#39;t spent<br/>
much time working on that one yet.   Gull though is just impossible.  I<br/>
check several times a night (i have a level 1 ranger parked there to check<br/>
out the island whenever I feel the urge) and I have yet to see him.   I&#39;ve<br/>
spent as long as 14 hours there in one sitting with my cleric and have sat<br/>
there at least 5-6 hours several times.    AS for seeing the Babbinsbort PH<br/>
3 times... that&#39;s nothing.   I&#39;ve got a good 15 or more place holders so far<br/>
and I have hardly missed a spawn.   I did miss the spawn this morning... 10<br/>
bucks says he spawned =(.<br/>
<br/>
I keep hearing rumors that they are going to fix the cleric quests, but I&#39;m<br/>
not holding my breath.   I think that the whole cleric armor quest is just a<br/>
big joke and somebody at Verant is getting a real kick out of seeing how<br/>
many people they can make sit around doing nothing for hours on end =(<br/>
