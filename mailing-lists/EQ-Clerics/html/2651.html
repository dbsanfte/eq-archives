<div id="ygrps-yiv-800282738">Ok red skelly is 29th normally but have seen it 32.<br/>
<br/>
There are GSkeles too 23-26<br/>
<br/>
Monks and dark bones 23-25 ish &lt;might be innacurate this though will be<br/>
close the top 2 are definitely right&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Trash zombies and skeles<br/>
<br/>
Calm should be fine. I used druid harmony here easily. Get a sow before you<br/>
try. Use multi calms 2-4 if alot in spawn.<br/>
<br/>
I say sow for 2 reasons. 1 you can semi kite it at 28th solo as long as the<br/>
res on your undead spells is not too bad. Also you can step back aways and<br/>
heal. Also if the calms go wrong and you get 2 just leg it outta there and<br/>
zone to feeroot and come back and try again.</div>
