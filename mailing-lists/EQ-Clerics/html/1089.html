<div id="ygrps-yiv-304287250">the increase in div for us clerics means how many times we fizzle invis to<br/>
undead and i believe might have something to do with how long the spell stays<br/>
up....and have you noticed that on the recent patch that it&#39;ll warn you before<br/>
invis wears? haven&#39;t tried this with invis to undead yet tho, but i did get a<br/>
warning when on with my druid earlier that said i felt like i was about to<br/>
return to view in bright red text....then a few seconds later, invis<br/>
faded....nice addition imho<br/>

&gt; My question is how does the increase help in spell casting, or how well it<br/>
&gt; is resisted etc?<br/>
