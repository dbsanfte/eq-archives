<div id="ygrps-yiv-1693362754">Greetings fellow Clerics<br/>
<br/>
I was curious as to the types of plate armor available to us... like what <br/>
kinds there are and how hard they are to obtain.. i refuse to wear anything <br/>
other than plate... (i&#39;m a big looks are important person =)) and the bronze <br/>
is just to heavy for my DE cleric.... i know rubi is an option and even <br/>
though i could camp it.. i really don&#39;t want to spend that much time to get a <br/>
good set... i also have about 1900pp in the bank so i could buy some of the <br/>
platemail from merchants.. but with all that i could only get like 4 of the <br/>
lesser pieces.... I have heard about silver plated pieces (mainly leggings... <br/>
are there any others?) and mithril... does anyone know of any others? or have <br/>
info on what might be a good way to obtain some sort of armor to replace my <br/>
bronze? either more pp for platemail or maybe a spoiler on mithril, like <br/>
where and what level... any help is greatly appreciated =)<br/>
