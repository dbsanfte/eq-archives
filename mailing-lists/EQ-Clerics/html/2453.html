<div id="ygrps-yiv-1032283806">Bree, I think that is wonderful.  I tried creating new characters on other<br/>
servers but what I found was that while I didn&#39;t miss the &quot;twinking&quot; I did<br/>
with my other babies on The Rathe, what I DID miss were my friends and my<br/>
guild and all the things we did together.  (Can&#39;t live without green spam!!)<br/>
So for me, going to another server isn&#39;t really an option right now.  It&#39;s<br/>
really the people that keep me coming back to EQ, not just the game.  If I<br/>
could bundle them all up and take them to Test, I would, but unfortunately,<br/>
it isn&#39;t gonna happen.<br/>

&gt; My Friends and I are burned out quite a bit on Fennin Ro, way too crowded,<br/>
&gt; and the Planes are near to impossible half the time.  Well, we decided to<br/>
&gt; take a break and I am having a blast.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We created characters on the test server. No Spam, No crowding, and no<br/>
&gt; problems so far about finding stuff to hunt. We are still very young yet<br/>
&gt; though and it is fun having to work for all our stuff again.  On Fennin We<br/>
&gt; could create newbie and give them things, but on test we can&#39;t &quot;twink&quot; so<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; feels just like it did when I started out on March 18th.<br/>
&gt; I made a cleric again, while my friends made classes that are different<br/>
form<br/>
&gt; what their high levels on Fennin are.  My thought are I have always liked<br/>
&gt; playign the cleric and well if we are gonna go anywhere on Test, you have<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; have a cleric so I am happy to repeat.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just thought I would share that with everyone, I am having a blast once<br/>
&gt; again =)<br/>
