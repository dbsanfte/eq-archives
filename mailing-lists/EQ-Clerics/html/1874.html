<div id="ygrps-yiv-1749193045">I found as my level in creased so inversely did my faction gain with these<br/>
guys. There is another way that worked look up the place on a quest info<br/>
site and that is to give in bandages (summoned used to work) 1 at a time<br/>
(100 in toatal) to get a faction upgrade - I think wasa the guy at the end<br/>
of the left fork in misty before the wall. Expensive if summoned no longer<br/>
work is months since I did it when they did - if not 100 summoned bandages<br/>
can come as cheap as 2 PP.<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise kill goblins in abundance and hand in the necklaces...just a point<br/>
dont kill the guy gunrich is it he is very bad faction for you; in case you<br/>
didnt know.<br/>

&gt; Hi all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am a halfling cleric of Rivervale, and have lost faction in my town with<br/>
&gt; the merchants.  This was caused by fighting with Mangler.  I killed him 3<br/>
or<br/>
&gt; 4 times as a young halfling, because he atacked me.  The 5th time I did<br/>
it,<br/>
&gt; I lost enough faction to con dubious, and hence, lose buying and selling<br/>
&gt; privileges.  I was able to regain my faction by handing in 24 RE warbeads<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; the sheriff. That was level 9.  However, at level 11, I was again attacked<br/>
&gt; by him, but he was killed by someone else. No matter, my faction bit the<br/>
&gt; dust again.  Now, at level 13, almost 14, I have handed in 96 warbeads,<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; still con dubious to the merchants, and still can&#39;t buy nor sell (other<br/>
than<br/>
&gt; to the druids).  My questions are this:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1) How many RE warbeads do I need to hand in?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2) As I get higher in level, is it more required of me to regain faction?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The only reason this really matters is because I can&#39;t buy my spells from<br/>
&gt; the cleric guild any more.  Otherwise, I wouldn&#39;t give a hoot.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks.<br/>

&gt; It&#39;s actually an exact 7 hour spawn.  I spent the 7 hours there from the<br/>
&gt; previous time he was killed (I managed to get there right when it<br/>
happened).<br/>
&gt; I teamed up with a lv 30 shadowknight who wanted the other piece of paper<br/>
&gt; (not the page, some note) from Dyllin Starshine.  He managed to hit<br/>
&gt; Starshine with one spell and was instantly down for the count.  At very<br/>
&gt; least I&#39;d have somebody with you who can cast see invis, so you can tell<br/>
if<br/>
&gt; some wizard or druid is going to come in & KS, you can at least let &#39;em<br/>
know<br/>
&gt; that you know they&#39;re there (cast cancel magic on &#39;em repeatedly, see how<br/>
&gt; aggravated they get with ya  ^_^ ).<br/>

&gt; &gt; I have heard that he is a 6-hour spawn.  He spawns in the open area<br/>
&gt; &gt; near the smugglers, in a little tent-thingy against the wall.<br/>
