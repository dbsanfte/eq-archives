<div id="ygrps-yiv-1639998193"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I&#39;m trying for the boots, gauntlets, arms bracers, and the caduceus..<br/>
&gt;For those that have done these quests, are they obtainable by a 24th<br/>
&gt;level cleric (i.e., me)?  Specifically, the boots (stumpwatch,<br/>
&gt;cabinwatch shouldn&#39;t be hard), don&#39;t know about the rest. Possible?<br/>
&gt;What level is Babbinsbort?  What level is Gull?  And how do you get<br/>
&gt;to him?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know what level those NPC&#39;s are ... but I do know you won&#39;t be able<br/>
to do them by yourself.   A friend of mine was 34th when he died several<br/>
times trying to solo them =).   Certainly though you can take them with a<br/>
group... I think they are certainly in your reach if you want to go for<br/>
them,  I wouldn&#39;t mind a Caduceus of the Sacrament myself... that is the one<br/>
item that is actually pretty good.  I wish it had +wisdom, i&#39;m really<br/>
looking for a 1HB that has +wisdom, but it is still very good... high damage<br/>
and fast for a 1HB.<br/>
<br/>
    As for stump watch and cabin watch... of course you can do those, but<br/>
the problem is that you have to do them in the Kithicore forest... always a<br/>
dangerous thing.    I actually have the piece from the cabin... it happened<br/>
to be there as I was running by  from WC to rivervale so I only need the<br/>
stump piece.<br/>

&gt;wait on these.<br/>
&gt;What level is the greater darkbone skeleton in Rathe mountains?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again I&#39;m not sure what level he is, but you would probably want to be with<br/>
somebody when you tried it.<br/>
<br/>
I would love to get the bracers myself, but those things you have to kill<br/>
are so rare that I don&#39;t really maintain much hope of finding them... and<br/>
now that I have PBB&#39;s, they aren&#39;t all that important.   I will just wait<br/>
until i am able to get runed Mithril bracers instead.<br/>

&gt;How do I make galvanized, magnetized, and vulcanized platinum bars?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you ask the person who gives you the quests about galvanized, magnatized,<br/>
or vulcanized platinum he will tell you which NPC to give your enchanted<br/>
platinum to.   When you give those NPC&#39;s an ehchanted bar, they give you a<br/>
bar of galvanized, magnetized, or vulcanized.<br/>
