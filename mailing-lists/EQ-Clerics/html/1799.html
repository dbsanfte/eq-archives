<div id="ygrps-yiv-882609957">I am looking for some information regarding this +10 wis/mana book quest. I <br/>
have heard that you have to start it in Erudin in the library. Does anybody <br/>
know the persons name. Any other tips and tricks would be great. And if <br/>
anybody knows what kinda level you should be for this quest that would be <br/>
great. I better start practicing my 1hblunt that I havent used since 8th <br/>
level.<br/>
