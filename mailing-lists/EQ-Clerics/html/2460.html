&gt;&gt; Bree, I would LOVE to join you guys on test.  What<br/>
&gt;&gt; are your names? I need to<br/>
&gt;&gt; decide what kind of character to make.  That is a<br/>
&gt;&gt; good combo, BTW...a bard,<br/>
&gt;&gt; cleric and monk.  Gotta figure out what class/race<br/>
&gt;&gt; combo that is good can<br/>
&gt;&gt; start in Freeport, since I know I&#39;d never get a<br/>
&gt;&gt; teleport or bind if I was<br/>
&gt;&gt; born in like Erudin or Kelethin.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Freeport is actually the EASIEST city you can get a bind<br/>
in on Test. However, it also helps that everyone is really<br/>
friendly. I&#39;ve had people go out of their way to bind me, knowing<br/>
there isn&#39;t anyone else you can turn to to bind you. I asked a cleric<br/>
if he could bind me in Greater Faydark the other day. (We got off the boat<br/>
in together in Butcherblock and he was going to Mistmoore) And he said to<br/>
meet<br/>
him at the zone to lesser Faydark. If I could not find a bind by the time I<br/>
got<br/>
there, he&#39;d do it (I was going to help him with bard-feet. But he wanted to<br/>
go in<br/>
Kaladim for a while first) And he did!<br/>
<br/>
Teleports may be more difficult. I dunno since I rarely got one on a<br/>
production server. (Never asked for one. Was occasionally volunteered<br/>
one. For a Guild outing, or whatnot)<br/>
<br/>
Getting a bind in Erudin on a production server, though, is similarly<br/>
impossible.<br/>
<br/>
And I DID eventually get a bind in Qeynos the one time I needed to.<br/>
So its not impossible. Just takes a bit of luck.<br/>
<br/>
Binds are not as impossible on Test server that people make them out<br/>
to be (I&#39;ve got friends that are level 13 and haven&#39;t even looked for<br/>
a new bind in other than their starting point, because they assume it<br/>
is impossible. I started in Kelethin with my bard. I went to Freeport, then<br/>
to Rivervale, then to Fawdyer. Then back to Rivervale. Then to Qeynos.<br/>
Then back to Rivervale. Then back to Greater Faydark. Then to Freeport.<br/>
And I am currently bound in Rivervale as a level 12 bard.<br/>
<br/>
I have been in nearly every outside zone on the server. And several inside,<br/>
fighting. It would be easier to list the outside zones I have not been to.<br/>
Innothule Swamp, Feerot, Rathe Mountains, Lake Ratheteer, Toxullia Forest,<br/>
Dagnor&#39;s Cauldron.<br/>
<br/>
So traveling just is not that big a problem. :)<br/>
