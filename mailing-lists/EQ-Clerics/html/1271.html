<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1371918551">Its funny to see this on a CLERICAL  HELP list first off....secondly....why<br/>
cant you go and BUY the item from the lower levels then?  Granted, you cant<br/>
do this with all of the lower levels....but do you know how often I&#39;ve had<br/>
higher levels come in without as many principles as most of you?  Why dont<br/>
you start bitching at those who HAVE gone and made this a problem?<br/>
<br/>
Example:  I&#39;m in Blackburrow one day.  The onyx earrings have to be one of<br/>
the SIMPLEST things to get ahold of.  A Magician, lvl 27 walks in, says he&#39;s<br/>
here to get the earring, and he&#39;ll take everything until he does....if we<br/>
dont like it....LEAVE.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, this is a great attitude people. We had 2 of the damn things to sell,<br/>
and offered them and his answer:  &quot;WHy should I buy from a lower level when<br/>
I can get them myself.&quot;  Or then we have the fact that I can pick these<br/>
suckers up at HOW MANY merchants?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For the paw of opalla quest you could EASILY purchase the damn rings from<br/>
lower levels who got them....not only does it get rid of some of that cash<br/>
you had sitting around doing NOTHING, but it keeps everyone happy.<br/>

mik, i agree wholeheartedly....there are items i&#39;d like to get as well,<br/>
because<br/>
i wason&#39;t able or didn&#39;t know about them till the mobs wouldn&#39;t give me<br/>
exp....seems the fair thing to do is what you said...&lt;paraphrased&gt; first<br/>
come,<br/>

&gt; &gt;What does everyone think of this Yield Policy?  In case you never<br/>
