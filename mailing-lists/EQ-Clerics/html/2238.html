<b>Subject:</b> Best looking clerics?.... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-882300255">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
This might be a silly plead for advice but here it is...I am restarting my<br/>
cleric on a new server.  My old cleric is a high elf female.  I am torn<br/>
between restarting as a dark elf or stick with the high elf.  Which in<br/>
y&#39;all&#39;s opinion...looks better?  I have never seen a dark elf in the purple<br/>
armor...do they look silly?  Does the purple make em look like a blueberry<br/>
and grape mix?  I have never seen a dark elf in the yellow quest armor as<br/>
well.  I do like the way the dark elf females look but given the color<br/>
scheme I might not be able to live with myself if the color is too much of<br/>
an offense to my fashion sense =).  The only thing I do not like about the<br/>
high elf females is the face...they look too haughty. Although I have to<br/>
admit that plate armor looks really good on the females.  However, another<br/>
reluctance is the fact that there just seems to be more high elves cleric<br/>
then dark elves...yeah I know the stat is better...but I want to look my<br/>
best as well and be unique ;)  Anyway advise is appreciated...thanks.<br/>
<br/>
These are female characters I am talking about.<br/>
