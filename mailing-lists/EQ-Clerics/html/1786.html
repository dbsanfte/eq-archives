The key thing to know about his place holders is they talk.   You will see somthing like &quot;a rat shouts arrrrg who has disturbed my sleep&quot;.  This can be any creature.  I have seen rat, putrid, and a ghoul.   Gynok says this when he spawns as well.<br/>
<br/>
Gynok and his place holders spawn on the top floor by the zone line.   Then they walk down to the 3rd floor.<br/>
So the first thing you need to do is go down to the 3rd floor and kill everything.   Then head back up to the 1st floor and kill each place holder.  Whatch for that key phrase.   <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
  Hey Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
  I really would like to complete my Paw of Opalla, i TOTALLY lucked in to the first 3 rings, i camped Mitty for about an hour and she droped the gold and copper.  Picked the silver up in Blackburrow, and now all i need is the Platinum.  Therein lies the problem.<br/>
<br/>
  I have heard many differing accounts of where to find Gynok Molter.  So, if you have SEEN him, not heard about him being somewhere, but ACTUALLY SEEN HIM with YOUR character, please let me know where.  Yes, i know Befallen, but where?  First floor in entrance area? Third floor near Elf Skeletons??  Please let me know any visual sightings. <br/>
<br/>
  Thanks,<br/>
