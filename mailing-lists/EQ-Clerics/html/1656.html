<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1263923298">This is the single reason why I quit Baldur&#39;s Gate. As soon as I installed<br/>
TSC, I went directly from 7th to 8th (cap in BG:TSC) because I had gotten so<br/>
many xp. What fun is it if you have no goals for your character? The thing<br/>
that keeps me playing EQ is the fact that I have so many goals to attain.<br/>
The abilities and spells are spaced out to where you are dying to get to<br/>
that next level. If it wasn&#39;t for this, what reason would we all play?<br/>

&gt; from 50 to what ever Lvl just cause they have enough exp too.  Think about<br/>
&gt; it, would you wanna install the expansion pak just to see &quot;You moved up a<br/>
&gt; level(s), Welcome to level 60!&quot; or higher?  What fun would that be?<br/>
