Typical Verant.  They put the cleric only weapon on a DRAGON  that it takes<br/>
like 5 or 6 full high level groups to take down.  Not to mention that any<br/>
such party who DOES manage to kill one of the dragons will more than likely<br/>
have at least 4 or 5 clerics in it, only one of which gets to loot the<br/>
weapon.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m certainly not holding my breath for getting this weapon any time soon.<br/>
