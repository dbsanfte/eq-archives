<div id="ygrps-yiv-379806965"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;friends all want to do Cazic Thule, but I find it so incredibly<br/>
&gt;boring.  I was thinking Unrest, but I have so many bad memories of<br/>
&gt;such bad trains there.  Seems like Runnyeye might be good, but not too<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I found that unrest was very good for me up until about 26... at which point<br/>
I went to Cazic until I was around 32 or so...  If Cazic is boring then you<br/>
are doing somethin wrong because there is usually a LOT of action there...<br/>
sometimes too much =)   I certainly don&#39;t think it&#39;s any more boring than<br/>
any other zone.   Unrest trains can be bad, but<br/>
the best way to level there is to join a group in a room in a house and once<br/>
you are settled in a room (I leveled up to 26 fairly quickly in the hand<br/>
room) there are usually no trains.  Every zone is bad with trains if you try<br/>
to fight in the first open area you come to near the zone.  Also, when you<br/>
get in high 20&#39;s, low 30&#39;s I know a GREAT place to level.  I almost hate to<br/>
say anything for fear of a terrific (if a little boring) spot geting over<br/>
crowded... but the icy orc camp in everfrost is a very safe place to group<br/>
with excellent xp.  I didn&#39;t find this place until level 33 and leveld to 35<br/>
in 2 days there.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  Paw and Mistmoore are still too high/tough.  I heard Sol A might be<br/>
&gt;good, but I&#39;ve never been to Lavastorm, and worry about falling into<br/>
&gt;lava as I&#39;ve heard you&#39;re oft to do when zoning into the place.  Maybe<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Paw and MM are too tough as you said... Sol A is ok if you get a good group,<br/>
but I&#39;d get a couple more levels first.  As for zoning into lava, i&#39;ve never<br/>
heard that nor have I ever seen that... the lava is no where near the zone<br/>
of nektulos/lavastorm... (though there is a huge pit right out side the zone<br/>
to Sol A and Sol B)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;the giant skels in Rathe mountains?  Maybe pickclaws in highkeep?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>pickclaws are very good at your level, but that area tends to be HORRIBLY<br/>
crowded (at least on my server) and you are very lucky if you can even get<br/>
in a group there.<br/>
