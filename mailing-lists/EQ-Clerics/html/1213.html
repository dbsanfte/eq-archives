<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1291696645">Yes the screaming Mace was a gift from someone who cares about me, the same <br/>
as I would give him a gift or I would give items to a person I felt deserved <br/>
them.  It is a matter of principle in my opinion and what kind of standards <br/>
you have. I would not refuse a gift, but I am not twinked either, I don&#39;t <br/>
get items that I couldn&#39;t myself get...I gave up my manastone once so My <br/>
husband could trade for a E blade, they are things that you do for those you <br/>
care about.   SO don&#39;t use gifts  in this discussion, would you in RL call a <br/>
person who recieved a christmas present  a beggar or someone who didn&#39;t work <br/>
for a living, no I don&#39;t think so.<br/>
I buff people out of the kindness of my heart, I don&#39;t get many beggars for <br/>
buffs cause half of them have no clue what level I am and what buffs I have. <br/>
And if for some reason I needed a SoW, then I would pay for it, unless the <br/>
kind soul refused the money I was offering. Many times someone will ask me <br/>
for a res and that they will pay me, I res them then refuse the payment, <br/>
just how I am. I expect to be asked for resurrections, I am a cleric, thats <br/>
my job, and if it is within my reach to do it at the time they are asking me <br/>
I usually will. Its those people who say &quot; Can a lvl 49+ cleric res me <br/>
please&quot; that irritate me, you want help but only if it is a certain lvl of <br/>
help,  and to coin a phrase &quot;beggars can&#39;t be choosers&quot; no pun intended of <br/>
course, but if you want a res that bad, you should take what you can get and <br/>
not be so picky.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;I suppose that is your opinion.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;However, you did say you received a screaming mace from your husband.  That<br/>
&gt;doesn&#39;t sound like something you earned or bought.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m with you on the camping issue.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Despising a beggar is certainly a fair reaction. In fact, the trade skill<br/>
&gt;&#39;begging&#39; rarely results in success.  I agree that beggars can be annoying.<br/>
&gt;But aren&#39;t they in real life?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And, how do you classify someone who asks for a buff?  As a beggar?  <br/>
&gt;Sheesh.<br/>
&gt;May as well not ask for anything in the game.  I constantly ask for SOW.<br/>
&gt;And do so in an RP&#39;ing context.  I&#39;m not one of those types who shouts &#39;Who<br/>
&gt;can give me SOW&#39;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Yes, I have begged.  And in all my travels, I have never asked out right <br/>
&gt;for<br/>
&gt;anything.  I have roleplayed a down on his luck cleric.  I have also worked<br/>
&gt;very hard to get the 52pp I have in the bank.  That was earned 10% begging,<br/>
&gt;60% trading up armour and selling to players, and 30% loot selling.  If,<br/>
&gt;after hearing my story, people are inclined to donate, so be it.  I <br/>
&gt;consider<br/>
&gt;that begging.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Now, for those who feel it is laziness, well, thats your opinion as well.  <br/>
&gt;I<br/>
&gt;for one don&#39;t think RP&#39;ing for 3 hours straight, just to earn a few plat is<br/>
&gt;lazy.  Its pretty bloody time intensive and not very rewarding.  Its the<br/>
&gt;RP&#39;ing interaction, and the bit of realism I add to the world that I enjoy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And, I also give to beggars.  Having received from others, I feel I should<br/>
&gt;give as well.<br/>

&gt;Ahhh not sure how yall are going to react with this one, but I have some<br/>
&gt;very strong feelings on this issue. I believe they stem from me having<br/>
&gt;started playing way back when the game was first released.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I despise Beggars....I have always been a helpful person, but the biggest<br/>
&gt;mistake you can make with me is to beg.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I started out in this game with nothing just like the rest of you, Some<br/>
&gt;people call me bitter, which is not the case, i am a very happy player, i<br/>
&gt;enjoy this game quite a bit, but I have a sense of value for items, I<br/>
&gt;EARN(not by Buying or begging) ALL of my equipment, I have never asked<br/>
&gt;anyone for anything and never will. I wore Patchwork, yes patchwork leather<br/>
&gt;until I was lvl 20, yes 20, I remember having only 6gp and I bought a PW<br/>
&gt;tunic for 4, dropped the tunic and was SOL.  I was never able to buy all my<br/>
&gt;spells at early levels right when I was able to use them, i had to buy a <br/>
&gt;few<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;at a time, I used a hammer of wrath until I was lvl 20 and my husband had<br/>
&gt;given me a screaming Mace which I used up til I was high enough level to<br/>
&gt;kill the savant and get a black enamelled one.  I Appreciate all the items<br/>
&gt;that I have, I don&#39;t get items that I cannot use, I don&#39;t overcamp places <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;get mega quantities of items.  I don&#39;t buy items, money means nothing in<br/>
&gt;this game. There is nothing I hate more than to have a group with one <br/>
&gt;caster<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;who already has a SMR camping the Arch Magi.<br/>
&gt;I am begged on a daily basis and when Someone begs from me, they are damn<br/>
&gt;well not gonna get a copper from me. I am a generous person, I buff people<br/>
&gt;all the time and have given away many items that I have gotten replacements<br/>
&gt;for. i.e. I gave a black iron medallion to a low lvl druid I met in<br/>
&gt;Rivervale one day, we just chatted and he never asked for anything, I gave<br/>
&gt;it to him out of the kindness of my heart.  I guess basically i feel I<br/>
&gt;worked my butt off to get what I have and if you are begging from people <br/>
&gt;you<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;are not even trying to get things for yourself, makes me very ill.<br/>
&gt;Enough of my rant.<br/>
&gt;Can&#39;t wait to hear feedbacks on this one.<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Hi all.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I gave seen this debate before in other places.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;What do you all think of begging as a method of acquiring<br/>
&gt; &gt;cash/armour/weapons?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I don&#39;t mean the skill of begging, but I mean approaching other PC&#39;s and<br/>
&gt; &gt;asking them to spare a bit?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Now, I am for it.  I beleive that RP&#39;ing worlds parallel the real world,<br/>
&gt; &gt;and<br/>
&gt; &gt;inthe real world, there are those who are poor, and need to beg for thier<br/>
&gt; &gt;sustenance.  At the lower levels, I gained most of my armour and my money<br/>
&gt; &gt;from begging.  Now I do it in a RP&#39;ing context, and not as &#39;Hey, got any<br/>
&gt; &gt;free armour I can have?&#39;.  I think that this is a valid strategy.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;As well, now that I am entering the teens, I don&#39;t need to beg as often.<br/>
&gt; &gt;But I do barter with players, and when doing so, I subtly make them <br/>
&gt;beleive<br/>
&gt; &gt;that I am a poor cleric (which I really am). In doing so, I have made <br/>
&gt;some<br/>
&gt; &gt;great deals, and am able to get some good bargains on armour.  Last nite,<br/>
&gt; &gt;for instance, I bought a bloodforge hammer for 15 pp, and a FS staff.  <br/>
&gt;From<br/>
&gt; &gt;what I could see, they usually went for around 30 pp.  In my opionion, <br/>
&gt;its<br/>
&gt; &gt;no different than trading in ussed car and dressing down and making the<br/>
&gt; &gt;saleperson beleive you are poorer than you really are.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Any other thoughts?<br/>
