<div id="ygrps-yiv-1090895522">Well, my reply is better late than ever, i have just looked at my mail for <br/>
the first time all weekend. But, I did want to add my opinion/comments on <br/>
this issue.<br/>
From the volumes I have read so far I think there is a bit of confusion. <br/>
Camping for items that you don&#39;t have and Kill stealing are 2 completely <br/>
differen things.  I do not think this rule should have been put into effect, <br/>
In my groups personal experience, there are items that we need that we did <br/>
not get at lower levels.<br/>
<br/>
1)I do not agree with item hording, once you get the item you need leave and <br/>
let the next group take over.<br/>
<br/>
2)I do not feel if a higher level group is camping an item and a lower lvl <br/>
group walks in that they should have to leave, what does it matter the level <br/>
of the people if they are in need of the item to be attained.(i.e. my group <br/>
consists of people all 44+ and 2 of the 6 of us still do not have Jboots, so <br/>
why should they not be able to get them?)<br/>
3) I believe that everyone has the right to attain these items and now that <br/>
us&quot; higher levels&quot; have little to no place to hunt, it is a good time for us <br/>
to get those things we can use to our benefit, that we never got a chance to <br/>
get in the beginning for whatever reason(i.e paw, Jboots, whatever, etc...)<br/>
4) i play on Fennin Ro and the reason I believe they changed PoF is directly <br/>
related to a few things I have seen happen on our server.<br/>
   a) Guilds(who will remain Nameless)were taking their lowbies and camping <br/>
them in fear. when the High lvl group slayed a beast, they would bring the <br/>
lowbie in to loot the item from the corpse, sad in my opinion.<br/>
   b) Also many people made lowbie characters to just go and explore there <br/>
without fear of losing their regular character stuff and experience.<br/>
So, i agree with the level cap for those reasons, I have seen PoF myself, <br/>
but I have never hunted there in a group, I am lvl 46 and still will not be <br/>
going there anytime soon(until they tone it down) Because of the Nameless <br/>
Guilds on Fennin Ro, that ruined it for everyone else. Its A lot of fun <br/>
seeing a lvl 6 paladin walking around in full fear armor.<br/>
<br/>
Just my thoughts,<br/>
