&gt;Best thing that i did to a kill stealer was to an enchanter in HighHold ..<br/>
&gt;he was charming the high level orcs and after my group had beaten about 1/3<br/>
&gt;its health from it and taking them to a quiet spot to finish em ... so i<br/>
&gt;followed him and cast cancel magic =).. . Next second it was beating the<br/>
&gt;cr*p outta this poor guy but after the 3rd time he got the message!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>     Be careful. I thought that one approach to KS&#39;ing was canceling the<br/>
KS&#39;s buffs, and canceling the root on his prey. I was told by a teammate<br/>
that this was considered a bannable offense by Verant. No, I have no ex<br/>
cathedra verification of this.<br/>
<br/>
    For the life of me, I don&#39;t understand why Verant tolerates -- and even<br/>
encourages, though the current kill-allocation algorithm -- the most<br/>
antisocial and parasitic of players, and frustrates the 95% who want to play<br/>
fair. And it seems to be adding insult to injury that they would ban players<br/>
for trying to protect themselves against the KS&#39;ers! Aaaarrrggghhh!<br/>
