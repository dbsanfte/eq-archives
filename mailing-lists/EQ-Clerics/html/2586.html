<div id="ygrps-yiv-1879937280">As I previously said, my stun spells capped out a LONG time ago, not just at<br/>
reaching level 50, tho they and my dd spells did notch up a bit as I gained<br/>
levels after first acquiring them.  But again, it has nothing to do with how<br/>
much wisdom you have.  To my knowledge, the only thing determined by wisdom<br/>
is the amount of mana you have to cast.  Would be interested to know if<br/>
anyone knows of any other attibute wisdom has?<br/>

&gt; Drizben hit it right on the head, even if he is a dark elf :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Most of our HP/AC buffs and DD spells go do up a couple points each level<br/>
until<br/>
&gt; a certain level, after which they remain at the same point level.  Words<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; Force (220 dam) and Banish Undead (585 dam) being the only two spells that<br/>
I can<br/>
&gt; think of that remain the same once you get them, level 49 and level 44<br/>
&gt; respectively (possible Shield of Words- 31 AC, level 49).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Of course, all spells eventually stop increasing at level 50.........<br/>

&gt; Example: Wrath does 198 points at 29th, 200 at 30, 202 at 31 and 204 at<br/>
32.<br/>
&gt; I just made 33 last night and haven&#39;t cast it yet so I am assuming it will<br/>
&gt; either go to 206 or stay at 204.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also, it&#39;s not only our DD spells, if you check your buffs they go up by a<br/>
&gt; point or 2 per level as well. Bravery gave me 122hp last level, now it<br/>
gives<br/>
&gt; 123.<br/>
