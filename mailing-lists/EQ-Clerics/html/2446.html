<b>Subject:</b> Re: Screaming Mace Question <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2069758281">Screaming Maces are good.  I used a BF hammer from around 14th to<br/>
around 19th.  I really liked it.  When I hit 19th I bought a screaming<br/>
mace.  The quest for the mace is really annoying.  I tried to get one<br/>
myself, and found one to buy.  Oddly enough, 2 weeks later, someone<br/>
gives me an Enamelled Black Mace. :)<br/>
  Personally, at your leve, I would suggest the Shining Star of Light.<br/>
An old friend sold me my screaming mace for 50pp, but I suspect they<br/>
are still close to 100pp on most servers.  You can have the SSOL for<br/>
30 gold, and a bit of work.  Stats are not quite as good 6/28, I<br/>
think, but the cleanse effect is nice.  I would suggest to get this<br/>
and to save your money.  If you are not solo-ing as much, your weapon<br/>
matters less and less.<br/>
  Also, you&#39;ll want to start looking at getting a Testament of Vanear,<br/>
instead of the SBS.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hi,<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I am considering buying a Screaming Mace.  Right now I have a BloodForge<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hammer, whic does great dmg, but is slow and heavy.  I also find I am<br/>
&gt; &gt; soloing less, so I want a 1H that I can use my SBS with.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; My current 1H blunt is a FS Mace, which has 8dmg, and rougly the same <br/>
&gt;dly as<br/>
&gt; &gt; the Screaming Mace.  Its wt is 10.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Other than the magical effects, is there any advantage to buying one? Or<br/>
&gt; &gt; should I save my money?<br/>
