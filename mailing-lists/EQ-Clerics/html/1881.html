<div id="ygrps-yiv-932559755">Sorry, I don&#39;t think this can be done.  I asked a similiar thing a few weeks<br/>
back, and have tried it, and to no avail.  Too bad, because this could be an<br/>
indirect form of PvP.<br/>
<br/>
The one thing I do on occasion, if a player is peeving me really bad ( and<br/>
yes I am a mature player, just get angry and frustrated with some people<br/>
sometimes) is to cast fear on a MOB or NPC while someone is fighting it.<br/>
That way, the player is encumbered witht he nuisance of chasing the kill<br/>
around the block.<br/>

I have often wondered if casting buffs on NPCs is<br/>
actually beneficial to them, but I have never taken<br/>
the time to experiment. It does seem to me that most<br/>
spells do not affect NPCs.<br/>
<br/>
I tried healing a guard that was fighting a dark elf<br/>
in freeport, and the guards life did not move. I tried<br/>
healing him like four times without any sucess. This<br/>
would also go along with my experience killing dark<br/>
elf guards. Seems for some reason, people take offense<br/>
to me killing their guards. :) The solution is that I<br/>
occasionally have a dragoon trained on me. Since I am<br/>
only level 20, it would be easier for a dark elf<br/>
cleric to just heal the corporal until I died. <br/>
<br/>
The other side is I have heard of people casting see<br/>
invisible on NPC guards and having them attack invis<br/>
players. Also seems that other people have had success<br/>
healing NPCs as they are fighting kill stealers. <br/>
<br/>
so, the question I guess I have is what buff spells<br/>
work on NPCs and what spells do not? <br/>
