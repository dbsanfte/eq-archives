&gt; &gt; a lvl 26, i use an  RTS as a weapon, i am looking for an observer<br/>
&gt;staff...,<br/>
&gt; &gt; but my question is what armor should i be trying to acquire at this <br/>
&gt;point?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Seeing as I was level 26 myself for a week (finally got to 27 thank<br/>
&gt;goodness) I feel qualified to answer this question. :) I recommend going <br/>
&gt;for<br/>
&gt;wisdom increasing armour.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In the last couple of levels I have been replacing various bronze bits with<br/>
&gt;the following:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Polished Bone bracelets<br/>
&gt;Lizardscale mantle<br/>
&gt;Blackened Iron medallion<br/>
&gt;Runed Circlet<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;With the exception of the Runed Circlet, you can hunt for these items<br/>
&gt;yourself in a decent party. Luckily enough I have a high level friend who<br/>
&gt;gave me the circlet and is currently hunting me some gatorscale leggings.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I also bought a couple of +3 wis earrings for 30pp each, which seems to be<br/>
&gt;the going rate on Fennin Ro. I&#39;m waiting around for a guild member to get<br/>
&gt;his JC up so I can get a platinum ruby veil at cost. My next investment<br/>
&gt;after that will be +6 wis rings.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I would advise against purchasing any armour that has nothing but AC. If <br/>
&gt;you<br/>
&gt;haven&#39;t already begun, you will find yourself less and less on the front<br/>
&gt;line in battle from now on, especially in the dungeons.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But first get yourself a Testament of Vanear, if you don&#39;t already have <br/>
&gt;one.<br/>
&gt;At level 26 you will have no problems at all, and if I&#39;m not mistaken it&#39;s<br/>
&gt;the highest +wis item you can hold in your left hand.<br/>
