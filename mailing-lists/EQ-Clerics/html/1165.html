<b>Subject:</b> alcohol tolerance <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-453862244">At a wedding I attended recently, there was much celebration. To put it<br/>
bluntly, I got hammered. :) I managed to get my alcohol tolerance from 0 to<br/>
60. I noticed that my STR and STA went up a little bit. I had previously<br/>
heard that this was a warrior only effect, but now I know otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
In the last couple of days I worked on tolerance a bit more and maxed it for<br/>
my level (130 at 25). I am still unable to get the STR and STA boost without<br/>
getting too drunk to be useful. I am imagining a point at which I can slam<br/>
down a few meads before a battle and not fall over myself when I need to<br/>
cast.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, I am beginning to find that when I&#39;m in a decent sized<br/>
party and we&#39;re hunting tough mobs, I stay out of danger so I can stick to<br/>
healing. I had always assumed that this would be the case, especially at<br/>
higher levels.<br/>
<br/>
So is it worth continuing to work on alcohol tolerance? It certainly doesn&#39;t<br/>
cost much (its actually a good way to get rid of some silver and copper :)<br/>
and I&#39;m enjoying annoying my wizard friend with it. But is it going to be of<br/>
any use to me?<br/>
