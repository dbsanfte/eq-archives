<div id="ygrps-yiv-1455364751">I am not gonna argue with anyone, cause everyone has their own style of<br/>
hunting, last night was a prime example of how gate stinks in most<br/>
situations, I am lvl 32, hunting in Cazic Thule some Higher lvl  people who<br/>
could not control their pull brought hells wrath down on my group in the<br/>
form of a train.....now i was near a temple a decent distance from zone(you<br/>
need to walk through a maze to get to it, I&#39;m not the greatest with mazes)<br/>
knowing this, i knew that if I went Divine, my 30 seconds would be up before<br/>
i could navigate out of the maze ( i always prefer to use Divine). However<br/>
in this situation gate would have been better for me, but while standing<br/>
still and being pounded by about 10 lizards ( can&#39;t root them all) i was<br/>
pounding on my gate icon and to no avail was killed, gate really stinks in<br/>
these situations, and had i known my way through the maze, i would have<br/>
lived cause Divine would have saved my ass.<br/>

&gt;&gt; This has got to be the most idiotic statement I have ever heard.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &quot;Divine ain&#39;t that good&quot;  pff..  I&#39;d like to see you root 3 festering<br/>
&gt;&gt; hangs and gate out alive.  You&#39;ll NEVER do it.  However.. one divine<br/>
&gt;&gt; aura and you&#39;ve escaped all of them without the least bit of<br/>
&gt;&gt; difficulty.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    Is attacking the guy for stating his opinion really necessary?  I mean<br/>
&gt;lighten up.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Perhaps the situations he gets involoved in, are mainly single oponents,<br/>
&gt;with slower attacks, and hence gate is a better option.  If those 3<br/>
&gt;festering hags you were talking about were away from a zone border, you<br/>
&gt;probably still wouldnt make it out alive. Even with Divine.<br/>
