<div id="ygrps-yiv-977095770">I&#39;m a level 29 Dwarf Cleric. I have no problem training in the Freeport<br/>
Temple of Marr and can&#39;t remember ever having a problem. There are a couple<br/>
vendors / NPC&#39;s in the temple that will have nothing to do with me, but<br/>
since I worship Brell (as I assume most Dwarfs do...), I would say that<br/>
training with them has little to do with who you worship. More than likely<br/>
you have taken a faction hit that you don&#39;t remember and are slightly over<br/>
the tolerable limit =)<br/>
<br/>
And as far as armor and strength go (I have a base strength of 90 or 95 I<br/>
believe), I found early on that I didn&#39;t like having full Bronze plate...<br/>
must be horrible have a 60-65 strength....yikes. I like to be able to loot a<br/>
little and not have to run back to town every 10 minutes. I have since<br/>
rectified the situation though and have a Darkwood shield (+9 strength),<br/>
bloodstained mantle (+3 strength) and something else that has put me at<br/>
about 112 strength... no problems anymore...<br/>
