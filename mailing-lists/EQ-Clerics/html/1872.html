<b>Subject:</b> Faction in Rivervale <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1740162243">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I am a halfling cleric of Rivervale, and have lost faction in my town with<br/>
the merchants.  This was caused by fighting with Mangler.  I killed him 3 or<br/>
4 times as a young halfling, because he atacked me.  The 5th time I did it,<br/>
I lost enough faction to con dubious, and hence, lose buying and selling<br/>
privileges.  I was able to regain my faction by handing in 24 RE warbeads to<br/>
the sheriff. That was level 9.  However, at level 11, I was again attacked<br/>
by him, but he was killed by someone else. No matter, my faction bit the<br/>
dust again.  Now, at level 13, almost 14, I have handed in 96 warbeads, and<br/>
still con dubious to the merchants, and still can&#39;t buy nor sell (other than<br/>
to the druids).  My questions are this:<br/>
<br/>
1) How many RE warbeads do I need to hand in?<br/>
<br/>
2) As I get higher in level, is it more required of me to regain faction?<br/>
<br/>
The only reason this really matters is because I can&#39;t buy my spells from<br/>
the cleric guild any more.  Otherwise, I wouldn&#39;t give a hoot.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
<br/>

It&#39;s actually an exact 7 hour spawn.  I spent the 7 hours there from the<br/>
previous time he was killed (I managed to get there right when it happened).<br/>
I teamed up with a lv 30 shadowknight who wanted the other piece of paper<br/>
(not the page, some note) from Dyllin Starshine.  He managed to hit<br/>
Starshine with one spell and was instantly down for the count.  At very<br/>
least I&#39;d have somebody with you who can cast see invis, so you can tell if<br/>
some wizard or druid is going to come in & KS, you can at least let &#39;em know<br/>
that you know they&#39;re there (cast cancel magic on &#39;em repeatedly, see how<br/>
aggravated they get with ya  ^_^ ).<br/>

&gt; I have heard that he is a 6-hour spawn.  He spawns in the open area<br/>
&gt; near the smugglers, in a little tent-thingy against the wall.<br/>
