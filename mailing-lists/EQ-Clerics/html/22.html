<b>Subject:</b> Re: Why do YOU want to be a cleric? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1201729121">Right now i&#39;ve a recently level 20 dark elf cleric.  Clerics are, and i must<br/>
stress this, NOT soloers!  Even against undead, lets say you fight an even<br/>
level dry bone, needless to say he has a 3/4 chance of kicking your ass :)<br/>
My role in a group consists of healing and expulsing/smiting, my melee is<br/>
just in there for fun.  Also, my two hand blunt skill is at 3 i believe, but<br/>
since in a group youre a healer and not a tank, it is fully easy for you to<br/>
raise your skill while not taking damage.<br/>
Theres my 10 coppers.<br/>

&gt;Interesting point you bring up about your Elven Cleric.  I played an Elven<br/>
&gt;Cleric up to level 11.  I stopped because I was having problems raising my<br/>
&gt;two-handed blunt up from 0.  I started a Dwarven Cleric and have seen the<br/>
&gt;difference.  I can solo pretty good and I can definitely back a fighter if<br/>
&gt;needed.  The problem with my first character was that I didn&#39;t have the<br/>
&gt;strength to do the damage and carry the gear that my Dwarf can.  So I guess<br/>
&gt;you kind of have to make the choice to be a back up fighter in the<br/>
&gt;beginning.  Interesting points though.<br/>

&gt;I dont think clerics can hold their own at all.  (besides undead) IMHO I am<br/>

&gt;Let&#39;s get some content flowing on this list shall we?  Let&#39;s start with why<br/>
&gt;you want to be a cleric.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;With me it was a simple choice.  I like to be able to help people.  There<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;I also like the fighting abilities of the Cleric.  Although not as good as<br/>
&gt;the Warrior or the Paladin, Clerics can definitely hold their own.<br/>
