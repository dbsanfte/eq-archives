<div id="ygrps-yiv-547055103">I want to thank everyone for taking the time to reply to my post.  Our guild<br/>
is doing another dragon run again tonight or planes =( (at least that&#39;s the<br/>
rumor) I am more nervous then I can say.  Thanks for all the advise...I&#39;ve<br/>
printed out all of y&#39;all&#39;s replies so I can read it while I play...EGAD<br/>
that&#39;s a confidence builder there isn&#39;t it?!  Good thing the tanks in my<br/>
group won&#39;t know ;P<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll try not to die as much tonight...dont want my friend to come back to<br/>
find she now has a lvl 48 character or something =P<br/>
<br/>
Last night, after dying so much, I started to make sure I kept a really<br/>
really really good distance from the battle.  Hope that&#39;s the way to do<br/>
it...I was so good at keeping the distance that I couldn&#39;t cast at the tanks<br/>
cause they were &quot;out of range&quot; =/ So I wasted a few precious second trying<br/>
to get closer to the battle to heal while the health bar was going down<br/>
steadily...was too stressful.  Then I got close enough, maybe too close, to<br/>
heal and die...again...*sigh*  On the bright side...I was the only one in my<br/>
group that die majority of the time...all the tanks were kept alive pretty<br/>
well most of the time...can&#39;t say the same for the enchanter and the shammie<br/>
in my group though =/  They went down too fast for me to heal.  I&#39;m pretty<br/>
sure I&#39;ll get the exact science of this sooner or later =/<br/>
<br/>
I have no idea being a cleric can be this stressful.</div>
