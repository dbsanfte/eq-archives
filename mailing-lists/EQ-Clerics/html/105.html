but there is no best race OVERALL for clerics.  It all depends on your<br/>
playing style. &lt;<br/>

I agree with that. I currently play a female dwarf cleric with 100 str and 105 wis base. I am wearing three items that add my wis to total 112. I find playing this character quite enjoyable since i can both do good spellcasting and good melee (and wear good armor hehe). For a cleric, that is. IMHO playing a cleric that is concentrated on spellcasting will be something completely different. I haven&#39;t played any other races for that class but i plan to do it someday. Also some of the special skills of other races (like hide with halflings) add some extra variation.<br/>
<br/>
My current character that i am concentrated on:<br/>
Iyenya Goldenheart<br/>
Dwarf cleric<br/>
Sons of Serilis Officer<br/>
Innoruuk server</div>
