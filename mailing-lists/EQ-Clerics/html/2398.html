<div id="ygrps-yiv-801343923">Do you think that Verant would notice 10 people sitting in on each server, or 150 people sitting in on one server?   I&#39;m not arguing your point, just askin the question.   I think that you may very well get more notice by doing it all on one server, if in fact you could get a huge turn out.  If you did it on all servers you would just spread it out more and get smaller turnouts on all servers instead of a huge showing on one.  <br/>
<br/>
On a side note,  I think the point is moot... I think the powers that be have determined that that armor is all good and I don&#39;t believe they will be changing anything, even if we get 2000 clerics to sit in at freeport.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose you could start refusing heals and ressurections to make your point, but then you only hurt the other players and the GM&#39;s really don&#39;t give a giant rat&#39;s whiskers... so... oh well...<br/>
Life goes on, and nobody bothers getting the cleric armor =)<br/>

&gt; I suggest we do this on every server.Why not? We need all the servers to<br/>
&gt; get together on this one! Same spot on all servers. The more servers we<br/>
&gt; do this on the more verant should take notice! Come on guys, I may not<br/>
&gt; be a web master but lets all make a diffrence instead of those of you on<br/>
&gt; the Fennin Ro server.Hope to see E&#39;ci players there. Remember December<br/>
&gt; 3, 1999 6 PM PST (9 PM EST) on all servers in west Freeport.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I am proud to announce that the Cleric Sit-In will take place on<br/>
&gt; &gt; December 3, 1999 at 6PM PST (9PM EST) on Fennin Ro in the city of<br/>
&gt; &gt; Freeport. Our purpose is to show Verant that a great number of Clerics<br/>
&gt; &gt; and their friends are dissatisfied with the current state of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Cleric-only armor quests that were meant to replace Rubicite. The<br/>
&gt; &gt; Cleric-only armor presently has two flaws that we would like to see<br/>
&gt; &gt; corrected. One, the quests themselves take a ridiculously long amount<br/>
&gt; &gt; of time to complete (days or weeks for just one piece), and two, the<br/>
&gt; &gt; armor class (AC) of the Cleric-only armor is not on par with classes<br/>
&gt; &gt; of its type (The new Cleric-only armor&#39;s AC is actually *lower* than<br/>
&gt; &gt; the original Rubicite). To receive more information about these<br/>
&gt; &gt; concerns and to find out how you can show your support, please visit<br/>

&gt; &gt; already plan on participating in this event please check the<br/>
&gt; &gt; information page, as several updates have been made. I look forward to<br/>
&gt; &gt; seeing everyone there, and in all hopes we can get Verant to listen to<br/>
&gt; &gt; our suggestions. Thank you all for your support.<br/>
