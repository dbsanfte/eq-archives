<div id="ygrps-yiv-1289863903">One thing the high Lvl Clerics aren&#39;t thinking about is that fact once they<br/>
add this what do you think the ppl that dies are gonna do?  Since ppl will<br/>
only have two hours to get their corpses rez&#39;d they are gonna be begging ten<br/>
times as much as before.  Before they had at least 24 hours to get it rez&#39;d<br/>
now they have only 2 hours.  When I get up high enough to rez I&#39;m gonna rez<br/>
almost everyone that ask me for it, as long as I&#39;m not logging, in the<br/>
middle of a fight or they don&#39;t TELL me to do it as in &quot;Hey Azor come here<br/>
now and rez my corpse!!&quot;.  Ask me nicely and I&#39;ll come running as long as<br/>
I&#39;m not say in Nro and they are in Unrest, unless they get my teleported<br/>
there and back.<br/>
But I really hope the fix Plane of Fear by the time I&#39;m high enough to go<br/>
there cause I wanna check that place out.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I couldn&#39;t agree more,  Azor.  Verant seems totally preoccupied with<br/>
&gt; &gt; discovering and fixing ways players have found to make the game more<br/>

&gt; &gt;  Verant needs to wake up to the fact that their high level players are<br/>
&gt; &gt; getting fed up and bored, and THAT&#39;s why they are leaving and/or selling<br/>
