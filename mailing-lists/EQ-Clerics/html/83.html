<div id="ygrps-yiv-7305347">Yes, I am sorry to say that I switched to a High Elf Cleric. I have I think <br/>
85 str or something like that. I will hopefully do a lot better, and trust <br/>
me, CLERICS rule. hehe. Just thought I would say that. I love them. After <br/>
making 12 different characters, clerics have got to be the best. Everyone <br/>
have fun being a cleric!!<br/>

P.S. if you need banded and you are on my server, please give me a tell. I <br/>
have a master smith that is in the Freeport area and will gladly make yuo <br/>
banded armor. Medium right now, if I get molds I will reduce the price, and <br/>
make yuo whatever mold size you gave me.</div>
