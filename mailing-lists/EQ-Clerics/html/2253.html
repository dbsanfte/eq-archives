<div id="ygrps-yiv-1555081010">The MOB&#39;s that have the good cleric items in KK are pretty deep inside the<br/>
zone and on rare and named mobs.  The named shark is level 49.  Some of the<br/>
mobs inside KK can see invisible, so invising in to the good stuff is not<br/>
always possible.  Some of the mermaids (forget which ones) can complete heal<br/>
themselves and each other.<br/>
<br/>
The named sharks and rares are on a pretty low spawn rate - and in certain<br/>
areas with pillars underwater they have been seen to suicide themselves so<br/>
keep them ROOTED and take them down as quickly as possible.<br/>
<br/>
A group of high 40&#39;s can do ok, but the fight with the level 49 is still<br/>
gonna be rough, especially since it will have friends. =)<br/>
