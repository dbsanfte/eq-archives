<div id="ygrps-yiv-1991596326">Aye, but looking at it from your perspective you could consider that if the sit-in is successful, it&#39;s possible that the 8 hour camps could be reduced which would give you LESS time to sit around on purpose (camping for items)...  =)<br/>
<br/>
It all depends on how you look at it...<br/>

&gt; Well, I&#39;m taking this sit in from a different perspective.  I only get a few<br/>
&gt; hours of play time a week, and I think that I&#39;d rather use it playing the<br/>
&gt; game as opposed to sitting around.  I do enough sitting around, what with<br/>
&gt; trying to find a group and all to play in.  I sure don&#39;t want to do it on<br/>
&gt; purpose.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just my thought.<br/>
