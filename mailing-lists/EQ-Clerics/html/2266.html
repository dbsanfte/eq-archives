<div id="ygrps-yiv-848982651">Heh.. if you are playing for Stats, the best race by far is the Dwarf.  Dwarven Clerics are pretty easy to max out, but also a dime a dozen.   I agree that you should play the race you want to play... if you are a power gamer, i guess every cleric you create will be a Dwarf.  I chose a high elf because that was what I wanted to play.  You have to consider the RP that you want to show Norrath, rather than whether your dexterity is 75 or 90... (or whatever number you wanna look at).<br/>

&gt; Hmm...what are the starting stats for halfling clerics? Here is what I chose<br/>
&gt; for my DE:<br/>
&gt; STR 80<br/>
&gt; STA 80<br/>
&gt; AGI 90<br/>
&gt; DEX 75<br/>
&gt; WIS 98<br/>
&gt; INT 99<br/>
&gt; CHA 60<br/>
&gt; I am pretty sure that the only difference is that a halfling&#39;s DEX and INT<br/>
&gt; are opposite ours. But other than that I play my DE strictly for RP value. I<br/>
&gt; understand that I am not as dexterous as the little guys. That&#39;s the way<br/>
&gt; Innoruuk built me. All I can do is find things to help that stat. I think<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s important to play a character that you like, rather than for the stats.<br/>
&gt; Sure, if I wanted to max out WIS I would have chosen a High Elf. But playing<br/>
&gt; a High Elf would not make me happy. My personality fits the role of a DE, so<br/>
&gt; I choose this character, along with his shortcomings.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That&#39;s all I have to say about that...<br/>
