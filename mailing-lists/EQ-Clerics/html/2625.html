<div id="ygrps-yiv-670853387">Tank Buffs: Resolution, Shield of Words, Symbol of Pinzarn (Naltron is not mana <br/>
efficient IMHO for the small yield in HP for tanks at that level), appropriate <br/>
Resist&#39;s for beastie you hunt, and keep Extinguish Fatigue memmed to cast if <br/>
you have mana, long melee really consumes Stamina for tanks especially if they <br/>
have haste items equipped.<br/>
<br/>
Caster Buffs: many Clerics dont buff casters much......I do. Resolution, and <br/>
Pinzarn at least and any resists they require.....these buffs may save their lives <br/>
as their nuking might attract unwanted attention....enabling them to move to <br/>
safety and give tanks time to taunt off the attacker.<br/>
<br/>
Your High Level Buffs stack nicely with almost all the Shaman Stat buffs as well ;)<br/>
<br/>
Have Fun!!<br/>
