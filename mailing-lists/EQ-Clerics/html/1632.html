    this is where you are WRONG.  Lag in the game can be defined by 2 things.....both effecting your speed:  a)  data rate to you for varying objects anf their placement (eg - corpses, monsters etc)  <br/>
<br/>
    The term &#39;lag&#39; is slang jargon used to describe a situation with high network latency. &#39;Lag&#39; comes from either from either delays en-route to and from the server, or from one end of the connection being fed more bandwith than it can handle, causing the network transduction device (ie modem, network card, etc) to fall behind in translation. The measurement of the cumulative effect of the above delays is &#39;ping time&#39; - expressed as the total amount of time (in milliseconds) that it takes a network packet to travel from client to server in back (this is the left number on the &#39;lagometer&#39; in EQ, btw).<br/>
<br/>
    In everquest, lag is often confused with frame rate because increased lag lowers the framerate, in 90% of all other network based games (ie, Unreal Tournament, Quake III, Duke Forever, etc), lag and framerate are decoupled - for you could have a ping time of 10000ms in Quake III and still be getting a full 110fps.<br/>
    b)  Your system&#39;s speed and ability to deal with the &quot;pre-defined&quot; images you have.  Example:  3dfx is fill limited to like 1833 textures (some ODD number like that)  when more than that is there....your system goes NUTS swapping in and out....  as it is....if more than 20 people and monsters are on your screen....fighting....casting spells etc...your system is gonna go nuts trying to keep up.  and it does.  You get sometimes 1-2 fps (frames per second) which appears to be lag.<br/>
<br/>
    Actually fill rate is measured in texels (&#39;textured pixels&#39;), not textures.  For example, I can bog down a voodoo II down to 10fps using only 10 textures if I render them all on full screen alpha blended lit polygons (but the number of texels is in the tens of millions). In any case, the ability for your card to display x number of texels affects your FRAME RATE, not &#39;lag&#39; <br/>
<br/>
Anyways I hope this helps to clear things up a bit, <br/>

    These things don&#39;t increase lag.  Think about it.  The game world is <br/>
    completely pre-defined.  The server doesn&#39;t send you any information <br/>
    about what the trees, buildings or scenery looks like.  All the <br/>
    server sends is information about what the monsters are doing, what <br/>
    the people are doing, any messages, and if there are any corpses or <br/>
    equipment laying on the ground anywhere.  That is, things that are <br/>
    not part of the static world.  You have a CD, that CD stores the <br/>
    pre-defined world. <br/>
      I could see where corpses would increase lag because that <br/>
    information would need to be sent to you.  A lot of people in a zone, <br/>
    and a lot of monsters running aggro.  All these things would do it. <br/>
    Faydark does not take longer to load than North Ro. <br/>

    &gt;Of course they increase lag. <br/>
    &gt;A higher Polygon count and texture count, means slowwer redraw more <br/>
    &gt;texture and memory swapping. Plus more mathematical calculations. <br/>

    &gt; &gt; I have heard that stationary non moving objects do not increase lag, If <br/>
    &gt;that <br/>
    &gt; &gt; were the cas than all the trees , rocks, buildings, and whatever else <br/>
    &gt;that <br/>
    &gt; &gt; may be in zone would increase lag too IMO. <br/>
