<div id="ygrps-yiv-112017593">I would like to know if any DARK ELF clerics have successfully completed the paw of opalla or testament of vanear quests.  With my being KOS everyplace these quests are given, it seems so difficult to complete =)  (and soooo unfair to us evil classes that we cannot get the BEST +wis items)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been trying to find a way to complete them - would help to know if ANY other dark elves have obtained either item =)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!</div>
