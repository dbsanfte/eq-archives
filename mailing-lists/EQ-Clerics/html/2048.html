<div id="ygrps-yiv-1960370902">some things have more faction hits than others...for example, if you kill skels<br/>
in sk, you get faction hits for the qeynos guards....but if you kill grimrot,<br/>
the faction hit is greater, since he&#39;s a more powerful mob...that de could&#39;ve<br/>
had a severe faction hit for you, which means you&#39;d need to turn in a good bit<br/>
of scalps and ears, because those are a small faction hit<br/>

&gt; I was wondering, lately in both HP & HK when I go to a shop owner he/she<br/>
&gt; tells me things like &quot;You make me sick, now leave my shop&quot; and won&#39;t buy<br/>
&gt; from me or sell to me at all.  I use to be able to till about a few weeks<br/>
&gt; back, I&#39;ve been turning in Orc scalps and goblin ears for faction but as of<br/>
&gt; now I still get the &quot;I dislike you&quot; from the shop owners.  Anyone have any<br/>
&gt; ideas?  Only thing I remember killing the said made my faction worse with HP<br/>
&gt; ppl was a DE in Qeynos and I only killed him like 1 - 2 times.<br/>
