<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-363800396">I personally do not have a manastone yet - but I know some clerics that do.<br/>
In a group if you are with a shaman with regen, have them cast it on you -<br/>
before you use manastone - and it is best to use manastone if you are<br/>
already at full health, during downtime when you are medding between fights.<br/>
The clerics I have seen use the only lose about half health - and get so<br/>
much more mana... and remember, you ARE a cleric, if your health goes down<br/>
using a manastone, heal yourself :)  The amount of mana spent casting<br/>
greater/superior heal is nothing compared to what you would have gained<br/>
through the stone.<br/>
