&gt;Today on a newsgroup there was a post and it was some guys ideas on how to<br/>
&gt;make EQ a lot better.  For one he stated we should lose NO exp when we die,<br/>
&gt;said traveling without armor or weapon to get our corpse is bad enough.  I<br/>
&gt;disagree, if we lost no exp then the game would be less hard to do.  Die<br/>
 </span></blockquote>get<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;no punishment for dying would suck, even tho losing exp can suck but it&#39;s<br/>
&gt;fair.<br/>
&gt;Another one was to have it to where magic users could only bind themselves<br/>
&gt;in places that we can bind non-magic users.  We&#39;re the ones doing the<br/>
&gt;binding we have the right to be able to bind out side a city.  Plus we&#39;re<br/>
&gt;the ones NICE enough to bind non-magic users or people that just don&#39;t have<br/>
&gt;bind yet.<br/>
&gt;He also said we shouldn&#39;t be able to have our spell book back after we die<br/>
&gt;till we loot our corpse.  I see really nothing wrong with us having our<br/>
&gt;spell book at all times, considering a warrior or monk can fight well<br/>
 </span></blockquote>enough<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;without a weapon.  We get attacked with no spells or weapon and we stand no<br/>
&gt;chance unless its a very weak monster.<br/>
&gt;So really all his ideas wouldn&#39;t fix EQ it would make it worse.  Sounds<br/>
 </span></blockquote>like<br/>
