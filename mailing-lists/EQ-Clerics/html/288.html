<b>Subject:</b> Re: LVL9 spells and armor <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2131269981">I too am a 7th lvl cleric (high elf, on test server).  I&#39;m 1 bar from<br/>
8th but I have a complete set of leather armor and all my spells for<br/>
my level (including summon food in the bank which I bought too early).<br/>
I think the trick for the cleric is to spend a great deal of time just<br/>
doing what I call having fun.  I haven&#39;t been overlly aggressive in<br/>
trying to go up in levels.  The test server only has about max 200<br/>
people on, so it&#39;s sometimes hard to get in a group.  And of course<br/>
at this level, I can&#39;t exactly sit at an orc camp and take on 3 or 4<br/>
orc centurions myself.  Because of this I tend to just wander around<br/>
a lot and fight stray orc pawns and skeletons that have weapons.  Even<br/>
though I don&#39;t get any experience for killing the creature, I can make<br/>
some money.  I also was working on a lot of the newbie quests for<br/>
the bards and paladins, etc.  In greater faydark you can deliver mail<br/>
from Felwithe to Kelethin for the Bards and get a gold coin every<br/>
time.  It even went up to 2 gp after the third time that I did it.  I<br/>
will probably go back and continue to do that.  And when some of my<br/>
travelling buds are on, I&#39;ll group and we&#39;ll go kill some orcs for<br/>
some xp.  But in the interrum, I just kill stuff for fun and profit,<br/>
literally, and not just for the XP.  All through 8th I&#39;m going to need<br/>
some money, of course, for my 9th level spells, but that shouldn&#39;t be<br/>
a problem.  Next I&#39;ll probably save up for a better weapon.<br/>

&gt;&gt;Hi, After playing about 3 characters, I decided to make another, and so<br/>
&gt;&gt;far I really like my cleric.  One problem I  can&#39;t seem to solve is the<br/>
&gt;&gt;money issue.  How did u guys get the spells and armor you  needed?  I<br/>
&gt;&gt;figure my lvl 9 spells will cost me near 25pp, and I still have my<br/>
&gt;&gt;newbie armor, and a rusty warhammer, nothing else...to get all leather<br/>
&gt;&gt;armor would cost me around 25-30pp...I&#39;m currently lvl 7, and I have<br/>
&gt;&gt;10pp to my name.  It&#39;s a start, yes, but no where near where it needs to<br/>
&gt;&gt;be.<br/>
&gt;&gt;Even after this, how did you get money for the more exp spells?<br/>
&gt;&gt;This money issue is driving me crazy.<br/>
