<div id="ygrps-yiv-1107808685">I have heard that wisdom actually helps with keeping you from being<br/>
interrupted.   I dont know if its true but more than one person has said<br/>
so.    I know once I hit 32 it seemed like my spells go through A LOT<br/>
more, my dex is at 93.  (I even cast RARELY, when I move back and forth to<br/>
stop the accidental casting of a spell)<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; to recover from mobs interrupting our spellcasting better? I have heard some<br/>
&gt; clerics claim this. I have a dex of 98 and i do find it quite often that even if critters<br/>
&gt; hit me HARD i am able to cast a healing spell. I have even gated several times<br/>
&gt; out from a heated battle while being hit for a total of 70 dmg.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just thinking if buying those jewellery craft items that raise dex are worth it :)<br/>
