<div id="ygrps-yiv-1694353280">Hello all.  I am new to this list and I have a question.  What are the caps <br/>
on our skills?  Such as what rank does Dodge stop moving up at?  And do our <br/>
weapons ever peak out?  If this has been asked may times before, you can just <br/>
reply to me and not to the list.  Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
