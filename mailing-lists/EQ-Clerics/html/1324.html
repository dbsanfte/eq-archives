<div id="ygrps-yiv-1028186985">I appreciate the good information I get from this mailing list, and I also appreciate the interesting debates.  One thing I would request of my fellow priests of light and darkness is to *please* cut out all unnecessary parts of previous posts when replying.  I am a digest reader, and today I recieved a 1/4 megabyte digest.  The substance of the digest was about 3-5 new messages, and many many people debating the proposed new camping rules without removing the e-baggage.  This is rude for people that use slower modem connections. :)<br/>

Thanks for your time, this isn&#39;t supposed to be a firestarter. :)<br/>
