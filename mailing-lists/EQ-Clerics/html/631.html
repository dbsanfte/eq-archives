<div id="ygrps-yiv-860042859">This is not an English class, but it is not a message board either. This is <br/>
a mailing list.<br/>
<br/>
A mailing list is used to communicate between people. Every time you<br/>
communicate in writing, you are going to be judged based on the<br/>
quality of your writing, including following proper grammatical,<br/>
punctuation, and spelling rules for the language you are corresponding<br/>
in.<br/>
<br/>
I tend to give people more slack on the Internet, since often these messages<br/>
are written rapidly and sent off without going back to proofread what<br/>
was written. However, there comes a point that your message is obscured <br/>
by the lack of these things. <br/>
<br/>
I believe what this fellow was saying is, because of your lack of punctuation,<br/>
not following basic grammatical rules, and your total disregard for<br/>
spelling, your mail was approaching the point that the message you<br/>
were trying to communicate was obscured by the poor technical execution.<br/>
<br/>
Feel free, of course, to continue to write in run-on sentences, ignore<br/>
spelling, and use improper punctuation. But in the process be aware there<br/>
are those who will not finish reading your message, and thus<br/>
will not receive your communication because they will hit &lt;delete&gt;<br/>
and continue on in the mail spool.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Don&#39;t get me wrong.  I value your input, I really do.  But I&#39;ve got<br/>
&gt; &gt;one word for you - &quot;punctuation&quot;.  Love it, use it.  Thank you.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;And while you&#39;re at it, take a little time and proofread.<br/>
&gt; &gt;It&#39;s &quot;spectres&quot; btw.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;         Okay the sentries is on an Isalnd with gargoyles and specteres on<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt;from<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;the sister dock go straight out to the goblin island you will come to the<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;Oracle if you face his directionj teh follow the shore to your left adn<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt;an eye on your right youll see an island come to view shes on this one<br/>
&gt; swim<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;straight out and when you get on the island she spawns to the right of<br/>
