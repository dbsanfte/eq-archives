<div id="ygrps-yiv-2027030359">I&#39;m partial to the Rathe myself.  I&#39;ve played on Mithaniel Marr as well.<br/>
However, I&#39;d say that the Rathe is pretty decent.  I&#39;ve not noticed any<br/>
KS&#39;ing.  It is one of the more crowded servers, but really, what is the<br/>
difference between 1500 and 1700 players?  Not much.  I also find, in terms<br/>
of start towns, that Rivervale is probably the best one.  Lots of helpful<br/>
people, and because it is a crossroads town, you get many players coming<br/>
thru there.<br/>

I left Fennin Ro for Tunare some months ago now and I like it TREMENDOUSLY <br/>
better. :)<br/>
Less crowded, less kill stealing, nicer people, IMHO, of course.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hi all.  I decided this would be a good place to put this, since everyone <br/>
&gt;has<br/>
&gt;good input on our class, while others refuse to help one another, I dunno.<br/>
&gt;Basically I currently play on veeshan server, and for months have been fed <br/>
&gt;up<br/>
&gt;with it.  Now I&#39;ve heard other ppl say (and could be rumors) that there is <br/>
&gt;less<br/>
&gt;ks&#39;ing on other servers, as well as not a dominate god guild like foh on <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;server.  (to Those of you possibly in FOH on this list, no offense, the <br/>
&gt;group of<br/>
&gt;friends I play with (UWS) as well as I have had bad run ins with your <br/>
&gt;guild.<br/>
&gt;Basically FoH and UWS has gone there...let&#39;s not do it again in here)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So basically my question to you is the server you play on how do you like <br/>
&gt;it?<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m seriously considereing abandoning all my characters on Veeshan to play <br/>
&gt;on a<br/>
&gt;better server.  This game is all about the playability in the environment, <br/>
&gt;which<br/>
&gt;veeshan seriously limits those not powerhungry play the game.<br/>
