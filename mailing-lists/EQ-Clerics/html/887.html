<div id="ygrps-yiv-127221130">I&#39;m new to this mail list, and thought I would introduce myself with a topic <br/>
to discuss.  I&#39;ve often wondered what exactly it means to be a cleric in <br/>
Norrath.  My personal opinion is that we should always be merciful to those <br/>
around us, and help in any way we can.  Even if to heal someone we don&#39;t even <br/>
know completely depletes our mana.  What do you think of this?  <br/>
