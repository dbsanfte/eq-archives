<b>Subject:</b> RE: Verant ruined the revive line of spells <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-256174397">I agree. And do we remember what happened in paper D&D? The recipient of the<br/>
Ressurect lost a point of Constitution (Stamina) permanently. And the caster<br/>
of the spell was on his butt for a lengthy period of time, regaining his/her<br/>
strength. This is an extremely powerful spell, and should come with some<br/>
consequence.<br/>

&gt; Can I be hypothetical here for a second?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Imagine you are walking down the street, a car hits you, you die, and <br/>
&gt; miraculously, a doctor is able to revive you and bring you back to life!<br/>
&gt; Are <br/>
&gt; you going to have full health? No way! Are you going to be extremely weak?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You betcha!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Granted, it was a REALLY nice thing to be able to be resurrected and have <br/>
&gt; your full mana and HP on your character, and being ready to go after you <br/>
&gt; loot, but if EQ is about Roleplaying, and about trying to be<br/>
&gt; semi-realistic <br/>
&gt; in some cases, ressurect was not broken in the last patch, but instead, it<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; was made to be a little more beleiveable/realistic.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Let the flames begin, just be gentle &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&gt; I just did a revive on myself yesterday and was damn surprised to the <br/>
&gt; result. Usually<br/>
&gt; all it does is teleport to corpse and return a little xp. But at that time<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; it did a whole<br/>
&gt; lot more. And all of them were negative side effects. After resurrection i<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; had all my<br/>
&gt; mana drained, had only 50% of HP, had some kind of weakness effect on me<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; all this without any addition to the positive effects (xp gain). I feel<br/>
&gt; this <br/>
&gt; is a terribly<br/>
&gt; wrong move by Verant. And besides they did not mention a thing about it in<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; patch message. Why the heck did they do something like this? Do they want<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; ruin the cleric now that it is perfectly balanced? That would be awfully <br/>
&gt; stupid.<br/>
