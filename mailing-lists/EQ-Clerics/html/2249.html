<b>Subject:</b> Kedge info requested <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-724101660">At lvl 38 the stuff at the entrance to kedge is high blue to red.  Does<br/>
anyone know how far in you have to go to start getting some items?  I<br/>
mean killing the fish at the entrance is good exp but really crap for<br/>
loot.  Unfortunately, right at the entrance there are casting messages<br/>
from the mermaids and a couple of others, so if the entrance is lvl 35<br/>
to 42, what lvl is the stuff just in the zone?<br/>
<br/>
Any info would be appreciated as I&#39;d like to know what I&#39;m facing before<br/>
venturing too far into the dungeon.  Getting ressed underwater can be<br/>
problematic ... drowning after a res would suck.  I&#39;ve bound myself in<br/>
front of the Kelethin bank and I have bottles of enduring breath in the<br/>
bank for a quick grab before a res. (My main tanks are in the same<br/>
situation).<br/>
<br/>
ps the Pirahna around entrance hit harder than SG&#39;s.<br/>
