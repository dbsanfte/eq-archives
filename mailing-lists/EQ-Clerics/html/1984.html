<div id="ygrps-yiv-1682270629">Does anyone else think Complete Heal is an almost useless spell in <br/>
     combat situations?  <br/>
     <br/>
     This spell has one of the longest delays for a cleric so it is very <br/>
     dangerous to use in combat situations.  I think the only cleric spell <br/>
     that takes longer to cast is shield of words.  The only time I found <br/>
     this spell usefull was when I was grouped with a L50 warrior since he <br/>
     had so many hp superior heal was only healing one bub of his health.<br/>
     <br/>
     Last night I was in LGuk and our group was camping the froglik King.  <br/>
     Now this guy hits hard and fast (140 double attacks) and I was casting <br/>
     superior heals one after another just to keep our tank (L50 sk) alive. <br/>
      There is no way I could have gotten off a complete heal during these <br/>
     fights.<br/>
     <br/>
     It also doesn&#39;t make much sence to me that it takes longer to <br/>
     completely heal someone than it does to ressurect them.<br/>
     <br/>
     I think all of our healing spells need reduced casting times,  It&#39;s <br/>
     very frustrating when your tank looses their last 2 bubs of health <br/>
     when your trying to get a heal off just to see thoes blue sparkles <br/>
     around their corpse.<br/>
     <br/>
     Just something to think about.<br/>
