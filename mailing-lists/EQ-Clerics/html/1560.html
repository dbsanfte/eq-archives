<div id="ygrps-yiv-1155840868">No. what has been happening is that high levels loot all but one thing from their<br/>
corpse, then leaving it lying around for someone in their guild to res when<br/>
they get around to it.<br/>
<br/>
It is, IMHO, one reason we were having clerics get so burned out so quickly <br/>
after they got high level.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Actually I am kinda happy about this one.. I know for a fact I am tired of<br/>
&gt; &gt; seeing all the bodies in some zones... this will help out a lot in that.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Either you or I have read it wrong. By my way of looking at it, this will<br/>
&gt; leave more corpses lying around. When someone is ressurected, they loot<br/>
&gt; their corpse and it disappears. If they aren&#39;t ressurected, they take longer<br/>
&gt; to get to their corpse (presumably, unless they are standing next to it and<br/>
&gt; only doing to regain exp) and so the corpse stays around longer, continuing<br/>
&gt; to clutter your view.<br/>
