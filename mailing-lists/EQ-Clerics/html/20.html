<div id="ygrps-yiv-1555026124">Interesting point you bring up about your Elven Cleric.  I played an Elven<br/>
Cleric up to level 11.  I stopped because I was having problems raising my<br/>
two-handed blunt up from 0.  I started a Dwarven Cleric and have seen the<br/>
difference.  I can solo pretty good and I can definitely back a fighter if<br/>
needed.  The problem with my first character was that I didn&#39;t have the<br/>
strength to do the damage and carry the gear that my Dwarf can.  So I guess<br/>
you kind of have to make the choice to be a back up fighter in the<br/>
beginning.  Interesting points though.<br/>

I dont think clerics can hold their own at all.  (besides undead) IMHO I am<br/>
a level 13 High Elf cleric. Our offensive spells dont do that much damage at<br/>
all.  I have read about the higher level offensive spells, and they dont<br/>
really impress me.  I love being a cleric saving lives and getting the<br/>
thanks from everyone.  Pretty much we cant solo.  (which I dont mind at all)<br/>
I want to be in a group.  When I play I must get a couple /tells an hour<br/>
asking me if I am in a group.  Or some high level asking me to heal 500+<br/>
HP&#39;s.  All I really want is appreciation.  Depending on their level I do<br/>
charge a small fee for a cure or a heal.  Usually what I do if they do give<br/>
me something depending how much, I will cure/heal the rest of the period I<br/>
am playing.  I think everyone will agree with me that being a cleric you are<br/>
going to be poor! Like I said,  I am level 13 and have about 2/5 of banded<br/>
armor.  When I see other classes have full banded and a fine steel weapon.<br/>
I was forced to move locations from Oasis which doesn&#39;t give much loot at my<br/>
level to Black Burrow.  I didn&#39;t mind the move at all.  I plan to stay in BB<br/>
until I get full banded armor all of my level 14 spells and maybe a fine<br/>
steel hammer.  I have to look up the stats for that.  Then I will probably<br/>
move back to the Oasis.  Well I am rambling right now plus there is work to<br/>
do.  Safe Journeys!<br/>

Let&#39;s get some content flowing on this list shall we?  Let&#39;s start with why<br/>
you want to be a cleric.<br/>
<br/>
With me it was a simple choice.  I like to be able to help people.  There is<br/>
nothing like coming upon someone locked in a life or death battle and<br/>
swaying the tide to their side.  I don&#39;t do it for any reward other than the<br/>
thank you I receive.  It is good to know that you helped.<br/>
<br/>
I also like the fighting abilities of the Cleric.  Although not as good as<br/>
the Warrior or the Paladin, Clerics can definitely hold their own.<br/>
