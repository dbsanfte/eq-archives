<div id="ygrps-yiv-1875928478">The dress idea is interesting. There is an item indexed on EQ&#39;izer called a<br/>
&#39;black silk evening tunic&#39;. It increases your charisma, but isn&#39;t very good<br/>
armor. ^_^ Forget where it comes from. Anyone seen anyone wearing one? What<br/>
does it look like? Is it strapless?<br/>
<br/>
For that matter, it might be interesting to go bar-hopping in a tux, my<br/>
being a male, and all.<br/>
<br/>
But wait. We&#39;re clerics. Shouldn&#39;t we be able to wear vestments on special<br/>
occasions? Now that would be cool.<br/>

&gt; I agree with Twylork and Heather about the stun issue, there is nothing so<br/>
&gt;frustrating as trying to flee a train, having divine aura on and then being<br/>
&gt;all twisted around in the opposite direction of where you were going<br/>

 </span></blockquote>duration<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;and it takes valuable seconds to get yourself pointed back in the right<br/>
&gt;direction. Oh well, one can only hope that if enough p<br/>
&gt;eople complain EQ designers will adjust it.<br/>
&gt;Also I would like to get your opinions on the fashion issue. What do you<br/>
&gt;think of the women of Norrath being able to attend an event, such as a<br/>
&gt;wedding in a dress. There also should a gathering place in Qeynos where an<br/>
&gt;event could take place without being attacked by beasts, or the guys could<br/>
&gt;really become Knights in Shining Armor by protecting all the fair damsels<br/>
