<div id="ygrps-yiv-822085395">I generally agree with this however Casters can cast while blind. Hot keys<br/>
do work.<br/>
Flash of light can be resisted, sometimes several times. If successful the<br/>
time is extremely variable 1 sec to 18 seconds.<br/>
That said it is my spell of choice.<br/>
<br/>
I love fear for two main reasons. <br/>
1) If you are trying to run away it can give you time if it works.<br/>
2) Sometimes the opponent runs into MOB&#39;s which is highly amusing.<br/>
<br/>
My favorite is to use it at the wood elf city. A PK&#39;ing druid once ran away<br/>
from me and a couple of friends, when he tried to attack one of our party<br/>
(guess he does n&#39;t know people group) He thought he was safe next to the<br/>
guards. I waited till he went up the lift then feared him. Its a long drop<br/>
from that city *grin*<br/>

Mr. J Daniels said:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What i typically do is stun the chaster, then run behind them quickly<br/>
at<br/>
an angle, then start nuking them.   When they unstun they take some time<br/>
to turn around to look for you, when you notice this, stun them again.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I reply:<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m don&#39;t know if this is good advice. For one thing, the lower level<br/>
stun lasts only two seconds. By the time you&#39;ve run around the caster,<br/>
he&#39;s not stunned anymore. For another thing, the recast time for stun is<br/>
very long. And, if the caster is smart, he won&#39;t turn around to find<br/>
you. He should already have you targeted, and he&#39;ll just hit his cast<br/>
button. He doesn&#39;t have to see you to cast a spell. And, if you&#39;re<br/>
dueling, he should realize that you won&#39;t be outside his casting range.<br/>
I think Flash of Light would yield better results. It lasts much longer<br/>
(12-18 seconds, I think), and he cannot cast while blinded. If you want<br/>
to confuse your opponent even more, cast Fear on him after you&#39;ve<br/>
blinded him. He&#39;ll never know what hit him.<br/>
<br/>
This from having dueled nasty necros in Lake Rathe. They really hated it<br/>
when I Feared them, heh heh.<br/>
