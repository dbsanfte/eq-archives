<div id="ygrps-yiv-2030870210">I use this one at work as well...I am also subscribed from my home.<br/>
I believe there were some people discussing the Shining star of light Quest <br/>
over the past few days, seems as though that topic is about done.  We were <br/>
also discussing the fact of the various typos Verant has on items in the <br/>
game I.E. Ethereal Mist greaves not stating that DE and Halflings can wear <br/>
them. I think that was pretty much it (correct me guys if I am wrong). Feel <br/>
free to start a new discussion if you would like, I&#39;m sure someone will be <br/>
posting something soon.<br/>
