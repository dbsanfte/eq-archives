&gt;&gt; I thought most clerics were good natured hehe.  I did not realize that<br/>

&gt;Alas, the vile gods of darkness have their mendicants; as a follower of<br/>
&gt;Tunare, I use my powers to heal and protect Tunare&#39;s most beloved<br/>
&gt;children, the elves.  However, I feel no compunction to show mercy to<br/>
&gt;the bastard child of the Marr twins, nor to help the stunted followers<br/>
&gt;of the gods of mayhem and dirt-delving.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>    You will not help clerics of Marr, even though you are welcome in their<br/>
temple, when you visit Freeport? Tsk, tsk. As a dwarf, I am sniffed at when<br/>
I try to buy semi-precious stones as spell components in the spellcasters<br/>
guild there, but I am welcomed in the Temple of Marr, and certainly feel<br/>
obliged to return help the Marr siblings&#39; followers in return.<br/>
<br/>
     I have even healed Children of the Dark, on the assumption that at the<br/>
End of All Things, there is hope, even for them, to turn aside from their<br/>
evil ways and follow a better diety, and perhaps if I return good for evil,<br/>
they will learn the ways of mercy and kindness.<br/>
