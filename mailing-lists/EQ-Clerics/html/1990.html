<div id="ygrps-yiv-1340756902"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;     I think Complete heal is only usefull when you are grouped with a <br/>
&gt;     warrior.  Pally&#39;s and Sk&#39;s don&#39;t seem to have enough hp to make it <br/>
&gt;     mana efficent to use without letting them get down to low in health <br/>
&gt;     which is very risky (one inturrept and they are done).  The main tank <br/>
&gt;     that I group with is a L50 SK and superior heal can heal just over 2 <br/>
&gt;     bubs on her.  I agree that CH is extreamly mana efficent when used <br/>
&gt;     properly but I still think it should have a shorter casting time.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d have to disagree with this.  I&#39;ve seen 2 pallies that when buffed up,<br/>
are very hp heavy as well.  Sharak is the first one that comes to mind.  I<br/>
haven&#39;t grouped with SK&#39;s too much, so I can&#39;t really comment on that side<br/>
of the cheal.  ;)  As it stands, I&#39;m happy with the casting duration of<br/>
cheal, it&#39;s not too long or too short IMHO.  If you know how many hps yer<br/>
tank has to start with, and you have a general idea how fast their hps are<br/>
going down, it will take a lil work, but you can learn the timing without<br/>
putting yer tank in danger.<br/>
     <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;     Last night our SK was buffed with resolution, symbol of pinzam and an <br/>
&gt;     enchanters runeIII spell.  By the time she got back from pulling the <br/>
&gt;     king she was down to 2 bubs of health and I started a superior heal as <br/>
&gt;     soon as she was in range yet he still killed her before the spell went <br/>
&gt;     off &lt;Drogo mourns over the loss of Sinlar&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Personally, if i can help it, I will start to sheal someone when they are<br/>
down a bub and a half (I&#39;m speaking of tanks in the 40+ region).  Since a<br/>
bub and a half is at least 600 hps for meleers of this level.  There&#39;s<br/>
really no difference if you heal them for 600 hps when they are down 700<br/>
hps or if they are down 1200hps, yer mana will still be used efficiently.<br/>
In the scenario you mentioned, there was absolutely nothing you could do.<br/>
If you couldn&#39;t even get a sheal off, then it really doesn&#39;t have much to<br/>
do with the casting time of cheal.  ;)  Cheal is a weapon, but it&#39;s a<br/>
double edged one (aren&#39;t they all?).  Cast it before it&#39;s going to be more<br/>
mana efficent that casting 2 sheals, and yer throwing mana out the window.<br/>
Cast it to late... well.. NEVER cast it to late.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
When dealing with behemoth tanks, on the level of Snaggle Tooth (one of my<br/>
favorite tanks to take care of), who has over 3500 hps or something really<br/>
disgusting high (=P), a cheal will save you TONS of mana.  A cleric is much<br/>
better prepared and will have much more mana to spare, with a huge tank<br/>
tanking all the damage.  (Mind you, I said tank, as in singular.  Having<br/>
damage spread out on 4 different meleers at the same time is a nightmare).<br/>
