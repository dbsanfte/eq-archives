<b>Subject:</b> RE: but can they be looted???? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1044334912">Thanks for that, but now I&#39;m really confused. I must of misunderstood LORE<br/>
items. I know you can have only one but I thought that made them no drop no<br/>
trade. Can anyone please explain why an item, other than the newbie stuff<br/>
and our summoned hammers might be No Drop. Or if they know of one.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Lore items aren&#39;t necessarily no drop/no trade.  My Mistmoore shield is<br/>
a Lore item that I routinely bank, loan to my bard friend, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
As for when loot can be taken.  Yes, lore items can be taken; no, nodrop<br/>
items cannot be taken.  And items can only be taken in a PvP venue; in a<br/>
duel, there&#39;s no looting.</div>
