<div id="ygrps-yiv-1923828732">I have heard that he spawns by the big rock in the very back of the third<br/>
level. Is that the same place you are talking about? I scoped it out this<br/>
weekend while I was getting a Thex Mallet. There were 3 skels there, so I am<br/>
gonna go back this weekend and camp it. I have heard that his placeholder is<br/>
the one on the left of the three spawns. We&#39;ll see....<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Has anyone else had much luck with Babbinsbort the gnome necro in<br/>
&gt; Befallen.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have been killing his placeholder ever 6-9 hours semi regulary (I<br/>
&gt; reckon I get 2 out of the 3 spawns a day) for over a week and a bit<br/>
&gt; now.. but all I&#39;ve been getting are plague rats, large skeletons and<br/>
&gt; giant rats.  I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m hunting in the right place.  It&#39;s in<br/>
&gt; the room next to the DE SK  (the left DE SK if you are facing as if you<br/>
&gt; have just come through the wooden door opposite the hidden wall in the<br/>
&gt; corridor) This spawn only spawns 3 times a day or so anyway so it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; sommat special.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Is there anything else I should be doing to trigger his spawn or am I<br/>
&gt; just being very unlucky and who ever gets the other spawn each day is<br/>
&gt; getting Babbinsbort?  Did people clear out the level just before he  was<br/>
&gt; supposed to spawn? clear out the room? kill Gynok? kill Cmdr<br/>
&gt; Windstream?  any ideas on triggers people cos this is driving me mad. :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And why are all our quests in zones where there is nothing else close to<br/>
&gt; our level to hunt.. I wouldn&#39;t mind camping stuff if we could at least<br/>
&gt; get xp while we were doing it.. oh well.. this is turning out to be more<br/>
&gt; of a pain than the paw of opella was..<br/>
