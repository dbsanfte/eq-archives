<div id="ygrps-yiv-1548772692">ok...i dont know whether dex helps in casting...but i do know that DEX does<br/>
NOT affect your ability to<br/>
avoid a hit...that is AGILITY.....dexterity helps in hitting your target.<br/>
IMO clerics should get there wisdom up...<br/>
at higher levels, we rarely melee and AC, at least in my experiences,<br/>
becomes less important...Bronze armor sucks anyway....i would much rather<br/>
have the extra mana to cast a few heals then the extra AC a higher wt<br/>
allowance will give me...and in the group environment, which is the norm at<br/>
higher levels (especially for clerics), if you have good tanks, you<br/>
shouldnt be taking hits for very long anyway....just my opinion :0<br/>

&gt;            Okay I see what your saying since DEX does effect how often your<br/>
&gt;opponent misses and you hit of course it will increase you chances of not<br/>
&gt;being intterupted because the opponent will miss more often but to say it<br/>
&gt;effects you recovery directly is not true indirectly yes but directly no<br/>
&gt;thats what the skill Channaling is for to help you recover when hit while<br/>
&gt;casting a spell&gt;&gt;Also you cannot compare a wizard to a cleric there casting<br/>
&gt;time is half ours which leaves little room for the opponent to hit them<br/>
&gt;while casting plus they are pure mage users yeas we can also be considered a<br/>
&gt;pure mage user but think about it we are better fighters than other mage<br/>
&gt;users but not as good as warriors but we are not comparible to wizards in<br/>
&gt;spellcasting in any way..<br/>
&gt;Personally I think clerics shopuld not worry abnout mana as much as getting<br/>
&gt;there STR up cus face it all of you right now probaly cannot wear full<br/>
&gt;bronze even (and this is a big probaly)unless of course you already have STr<br/>
&gt;increasing items.<br/>

&gt;&gt;2 Extra bars of Mana????? I find that impossible, I have tested the Wisdom<br/>
&gt;&gt;item theory.  Let me say this my base Wisdom was 89, with all the items I<br/>
&gt;&gt;had that added wisdom, i was at 124.<br/>
&gt;&gt;I conducted a test...I removed all of my Wisdom granting items so my wis<br/>
&gt;was<br/>
&gt;&gt;89. I began to cast Greater healing ( I did not fizzle) I was able to cast<br/>
&gt;&gt;it 5 times( 150 per cast).....I then tried to cast Holy Might ( 35 per<br/>
&gt;&gt;cast ) and was unbable to.....<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;I then put all of my WIS items back on so my wis was 124 i once again cast<br/>
&gt;&gt;greater healing 5 times ( no fizzle 150 per cast)....with the BS MANA I had<br/>
&gt;&gt;left over i was able to cast ONE holy might (35 MANA) and one flash of<br/>
&gt;light<br/>
&gt;&gt;(12 MANA). SO, with this test i have decided that instead of using ALL my<br/>
&gt;&gt;item slots to try to bring up wisdom, which is a complete waste of time, I<br/>
&gt;&gt;would get some really good wis Items( like plus 6 wis ring, Adementite<br/>
&gt;&gt;epolets, ETC) and i would replace some items with DEX, yes DEX increasings<br/>
&gt;&gt;items.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;DEX does directly affect your ability to cast while being hit, not to<br/>
&gt;&gt;mention if you have a weapon that randomly casts an effect, DEX plays a<br/>
&gt;&gt;great part in how Often it works.  I have seen it make a difference with<br/>
&gt;our<br/>
&gt;&gt;regular gnome wizard, who naturally has a high DEX( she is over 115)She can<br/>
&gt;&gt;literally cast almost any spell while being hit,I will estimate that she is<br/>
&gt;&gt;interrupted only 10% of the time, I have seen her Gate from terrible<br/>
&gt;&gt;situations while being completely pounded and my in-game husband, has found<br/>
&gt;&gt;great success with his DEX over 105 now, Our Paladins DEX is 117, and even<br/>
&gt;&gt;though he has no DD spells, his Ghoulbane is much much more effective<br/>
&gt;&gt;against the undead, My DEX is now 100 and I have seen a difference in my<br/>
&gt;&gt;casting, then gnome and I were medding in Soluseks eye ons day when someoen<br/>
&gt;&gt;trained a boat load of nasties by us, they took an extreme liking to me, I<br/>
&gt;&gt;was able to cast greater heal on myself 5 successive times without being<br/>
&gt;&gt;interrupted.<br/>
&gt;&gt;So, that is my rant, i feel very strongly about it, WIS is good don&#39;t get<br/>
&gt;me<br/>
&gt;&gt;wrong, but there will NEVER be a way to add enough wisdom to make a really<br/>
&gt;&gt;big difference in the Mana that I have. SO i sacfrifice a small amount of<br/>
&gt;&gt;mana, while gaining a better ability to help people while in battle, I<br/>
&gt;think<br/>
&gt;&gt;the trade off is fair. By the way,  Yes channeling is a great factor in<br/>
&gt;&gt;recovering as well.<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt;well, me personally, i think it&#39;s channelling that helps you recover from<br/>
&gt;&gt;being hit and still<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;casting.....i could be wrong, but i believe that&#39;s what it is....also,<br/>
&gt;&gt;later on, it&#39;s<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;important to have as much mana as you can, so i&#39;d invest in wis adding<br/>
&gt;&gt;items......believe me,<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;that can go along way....for example, i died today &lt;yeah i know i&#39;m not<br/>
&gt;&gt;supposed to do that,<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;but it happens&gt;....well, when i got back and looted my corpse, from all<br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;&gt;wis adding items<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;i have, it gave me 2 extra bars of mana....base wis 95 and with items,<br/>
&gt;&gt;138....this was on lv<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;40, so it does make a difference<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have question to you fellow clerics that would like to have a clear<br/>
&gt;&gt;answer to. The<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; question is that does dexterity effect in spellcasting any way? Does it<br/>
&gt;&gt;make us<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to recover from mobs interrupting our spellcasting better? I have heard<br/>
&gt;&gt;some<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; clerics claim this. I have a dex of 98 and i do find it quite often that<br/>
&gt;&gt;even if critters<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hit me HARD i am able to cast a healing spell. I have even gated several<br/>
&gt;&gt;times<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; out from a heated battle while being hit for a total of 70 dmg.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Just thinking if buying those jewellery craft items that raise dex are<br/>
&gt;&gt;worth it :)<br/>
