<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Well.. i know with today&#39;s patch this is now an item that you can put in your <br/>
&gt; left hand slot, and yeilds +10 mana and +10 wisdom.. a necessity for any <br/>
&gt; cleric... but its also lore and no drop... and I am a DE cleric... I know the <br/>
&gt; quest starts in Erudin and also takes place in i think qeynos and HH, but <br/>
&gt; does anyone know a way in which i might be able to obtain this valuable item? <br/>
&gt;  Especially since DE clerics get zero quests... and casters get that stein <br/>
&gt; thing that isn&#39;t no drop... i guess i&#39;ll have to yell at some GMs for that <br/>
&gt; one.... anyone who can give a more detailed spoiler or a way to increase <br/>
&gt; faction with only the npcs who are abosolutly necessary for the quest would <br/>
&gt; be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance for the info.<br/>

Guard you need to kill, and Moodoro Finharn doesn&#39;t give the Jester card<br/>
anymore ... he gives the faction, he talks as if he&#39;s given you a card,<br/>
but there&#39;s no card given.<br/>

Dammit.  ANd I HAD a testament, but destroyed it since they made it<br/>
NoDrop while it was in the bank and once I took it back into my<br/>
possession, I couldn&#39;t put it back.<br/>
