<div id="ygrps-yiv-100412241">The maximum amount of dmg done by a spell is pre-determined by Verant, and<br/>
has nothing at all to do with the individual player&#39;s level or stats, such<br/>
as wisdom.   I&#39;m at level 50, and Holy Might still hits for 60 pts max and<br/>
Force for 90 and Sound of Force for 220.  Now, some spells and bard songs<br/>
are designed to go up one- two pts of dmg as you level after getting the<br/>
original spell/song, but they do not go up ad infinitum.  For instance, a<br/>
bard&#39;s song Brusco&#39;s Boastful Bellow does 1 - 2 pts more damage each time<br/>
you level after initially getting it. Same with some of the druids dd spells<br/>
as well.  But none of these spells damage done is dependent on what your<br/>
wisdom is, although your chance for success or failure  in casting does<br/>
depend on your skill in channeling and some say dexterity as well.<br/>
<br/>
Also, the critter you are casting on has a lot to do with how much damage<br/>
you will inflict.  A high red will resist most all the time.  The closer to<br/>
your level the critter cons the better your chance for hitting him and doing<br/>
max damage.  In addition to the level of the critter, some critters have<br/>
very high magic resistance, such as the ogre guards at Ogukk in Feerott and<br/>
the Fire Imps in SolB.  Which means they are gonna resist your spells a<br/>
higher percentage of the time.  Another determinative is that some of the<br/>
critters are casters with the ability to buff themselves with the same<br/>
spells we have, so you have to &quot;debuff&quot; them first before your casters will<br/>
have any real chance of success at hitting them with their dd spells.<br/>
<br/>
I realize this is a very long winded answer, and the bottom line I guess is<br/>
that there is a max amt of dmg set by Verant on each spell/song that is not<br/>
dependent on your stats, such as wisdom, or your level.<br/>

&gt; Expulse undead does 94 damage for me and I am lvl 24.  I think he got the<br/>
&gt; numbers mixed up.<br/>
