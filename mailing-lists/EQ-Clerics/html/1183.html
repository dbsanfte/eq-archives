<div id="ygrps-yiv-1652197021">Er, you&#39;re kidding, right? I agree on the patchwork, but smithing isn&#39;t<br/>
cheap. On established servers it&#39;s usually cheaper to buy banded or skip<br/>
straight to bronze, given that the smithing market is becoming so depressed,<br/>
and places like Unrest get more low-level players in them by the day...<br/>

&gt; For a cleric looking to save some money in the<br/>
&gt; beginning, i would strongly suggest tailoring as a starting <br/>
&gt; skill.  You can<br/>
&gt; armor yeself for relatively little money, and can save the <br/>
&gt; rest of the cash<br/>
&gt; for spells.  As you go up in levels, you should definitely work on<br/>
&gt; smithing, since it&#39;s relatively cheap to increase the skill <br/>
&gt; to the point<br/>
&gt; where you can make banded armor with relative reliability.  <br/>
&gt; Besides, it&#39;s a<br/>
&gt; helluva lot cheaper than purchasing chain from the store! </span></blockquote></div>
