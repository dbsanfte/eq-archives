<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1039697428">I agree with Twylork and Heather about the stun issue, there is nothing so<br/>
frustrating as trying to flee a train, having divine aura on and then being<br/>
all twisted around in the opposite direction of where you were going because<br/>
the enemy stunned you. What makes it worse is the spell has a small duration<br/>
and it takes valuable seconds to get yourself pointed back in the right<br/>
direction. Oh well, one can only hope that if enough p<br/>
eople complain EQ designers will adjust it.<br/>
Also I would like to get your opinions on the fashion issue. What do you<br/>
think of the women of Norrath being able to attend an event, such as a<br/>
wedding in a dress. There also should a gathering place in Qeynos where an<br/>
event could take place without being attacked by beasts, or the guys could<br/>
really become Knights in Shining Armor by protecting all the fair damsels of<br/>
Norrath. Again an item for my wish list as I sometimes get tired of wearing<br/>
my full battle dress all the time. Healingsun, Solusek Ro. Level 15 cleric</div>
