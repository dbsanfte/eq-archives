<div id="ygrps-yiv-272464487">You can trade it.  I used my friend&#39;s paw for quite some time.  It is only<br/>
LORE, not NO DROP.<br/>

&gt; I was under the impression that the paw of opalla was no trade - therefore<br/>
&gt; not really &quot;a dime a dozen&quot;  And I would never begrudge another cleric a<br/>
&gt; good item.  The rings are NOT no trade - so it IS possible to purchase<br/>
&gt; them - though they are excessively costly to get from another player.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And at your level, killing Mitty should give you good experience, so get a<br/>
&gt; group and hunt her, you don&#39;t have to rely on smite alone if you have a<br/>
&gt; group - everyone in the group could get experience, thus no one would mind<br/>
&gt; overly helping you to camp.  (Druids seems to like the paw also - you can<br/>
&gt; get a druid to help you camp and help you to kill Mitty - and get both of<br/>
&gt; you the rings)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I need to camp that Mitty also ;) so if you need help on Solusek<br/>
&gt; Ro server,<br/>
&gt; would be glad to help.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just some thoughts =)<br/>
