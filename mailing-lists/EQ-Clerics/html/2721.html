<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1056958314">I think you are forgetting that we clerics have the best taunt of all in our<br/>
spellbooks.   It is called heal.   I have even noticed that a bard singing<br/>
the healing song will pull more critters to them someone doing more damage.<br/>
Am I mistaken in this or is it really true?<br/>

&gt; Heh.. it won&#39;t work.   I mean there may be a slight taunting factor<br/>

&gt; one whack with your mace would do more to taunt a monster than begging<br/>
&gt; would, and you know that our mace doesn&#39;t do much to taunt.   At any rate,<br/>
&gt; as clerics we don&#39;t really want to taunt.   Especially at higher levels,<br/>
