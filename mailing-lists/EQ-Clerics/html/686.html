<b>Subject:</b> Make unique Items part of a quest <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-85909079">Sure jboots should be rare, but I<br/>
agree, to make them only appear on 1 person is just insane.  If they<br/>
are that rare, then they are unique, and then as soon as that person<br/>
got killed the owner would become the only person in the whole world<br/>
to have them.  These are called artifacts and are unique.  But this<br/>
kind of game has no room for artifacts.  <br/>
<br/>
HEY! You&#39;re absolutely right. And I have an idea. First, improve EQ&#39;s<br/>
quest elements,  then make unique items like journeyman boots quest<br/>
items. VERY DIFFICULT items could be part of a VERY DIFFICULT quest, but<br/>
that&#39;s ok, cause there would be no camping, no kill stealing, and you<br/>
would be doing a lot more exploring and getting experience while doing<br/>
it. And, I think, you&#39;d be having a lot more fun using your brain than<br/>
using the /gesture command (after that 35th level wizard just stole your<br/>
kill for the 3rd time in the same day). What do you think? I mean, isn&#39;t<br/>
that why they call it EVERquest?<br/>
