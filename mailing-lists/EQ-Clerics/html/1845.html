<div id="ygrps-yiv-89224993">Between levels 20 and 24 I soloed aviak guards in Lake Rathe. There is one<br/>
spot just outside the Arena zone (after turning right from SK zone) with two<br/>
spawns far enough away from each other that you can drag one without the<br/>
other noticing. Further down there are two spawns right next to each other,<br/>
so you need someone else to take the other one.<br/>
<br/>
Lake Rathe seems to be a soloists zone, with people rotating the spawns<br/>
rather than grouping. I have no idea why, but it suits your purpose. The<br/>
loot is reasonable, pretty good cash and the odd bronze weapon. For me, a<br/>
simple melee/smite routine worked fine.<br/>
<br/>
If you get one spawn to yourself, you should have enough time to be able to<br/>
hop around from foot to foot with full HP and mana for just a little while<br/>
before the next spawn.<br/>
