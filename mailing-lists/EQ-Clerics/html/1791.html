<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1211075288">Hey guys, after 17 straight hours of camping that stupid placeholder for<br/>
Gynok Moltar and STILL no Gynok Moltar, here is what I saw:<br/>
<br/>
1.  The placeholder spawn consisted of putrid rats, IBSs, regular skels,<br/>
ghouls.<br/>
<br/>
2. NOT every placeholder that spawns talks.  Some of them do and some of<br/>
them don&#39;t, and I mean some of the SAME type.  Not all putrid rats that<br/>
spawn talk, or IBSs or ghouls.  I&#39;ve had some of the rats talk and some not,<br/>
some of the IBSs talk and some not.  When they talk they say something<br/>
like...&quot;Aiewwwwwww, you have disturbed my sleep and now you won&#39;t rest&quot; or<br/>
something or other like that about disturbing their sleep or rest.<br/>
<br/>
3.  The placeholder spawned right at the zone entrance inside Befallen every<br/>
18 minutes or so.<br/>
<br/>
4.  WATCH OUT  FOR TRAINS.  Stupid trains seemed to always happen when it<br/>
was time for the placeholder to spawn, and several times, I almost LOST the<br/>
stupid placeholder (especially if it didn&#39;t talk) and had to chase it down<br/>
and kill every single dang thing in the train to be sure I got it.<br/>
<br/>
5.  If a ghoul spawns, which it frequently does, ROOT it and kill it fast,<br/>
cause it runs FAST downstairs.  I had to chase a couple of em down to 3rd<br/>
level cause they were so fast and almost got away from me.  Before my DD<br/>
undead spell could cast it was out of range.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.  Any other questions, just ask.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; Gynok&#39;s place holder spawns at the zone and does a shout to the whole<br/>
&gt; zone, you will see a giant rat shouts &quot;some garbage about waking me or<br/>
&gt; something&quot; it then wanders thru 1st level, then 2nd level then 3rd<br/>
&gt; level. So unless the spot is camped the only way be sure is to go thru<br/>
&gt; and kill anything that seems to be moving, and since the place holder<br/>
&gt; may have made it to his final resting place, everything on the third<br/>
&gt; floor, then go back up and camp the zone killing everything that spawns<br/>
&gt; and does a shout.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The place holder can be anything that spawns in Befallen, but I have<br/>
&gt; seen/heard Giant rats, putrid skeles, a skeleton and ghouls.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Does anyone know for certain what or where Gynok&#39;s placeholder is on<br/>
&gt; &gt; 3rd floor?  I sat inside zone entrance to Befallen killing everything<br/>
&gt; &gt; that spawned where Gynok is supposed to spawn for 4 hours one night<br/>
&gt; &gt; and he never spawned in all that time.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; All I can say is UGH I hate camping =)<br/>
