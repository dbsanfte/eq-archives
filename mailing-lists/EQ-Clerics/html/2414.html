<b>Subject:</b> camping.. was Re: Cleric Sit-In <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1394072122">I didn&#39;t really camp until the last 5 levels or so when I started wanting some of the items that I was finally getting high enough level to get.   After a while you find that the higher level you get the less value platinum has and everything that you want to have is either A) No-Drop, B) costs just an outrageous amount of platinum (because plat is so easy to come by at high levels) or C) the person who has the item wants to trade it instead of selling it (again because plat isn&#39;t worth that much compared to the time spent getting items).   In the case of C, you need to camp to get the items that the person is willing to trade the item you want for... so you either camp for that or you camp for the item you actually want.. either way you are going to camp.   In the case of A, you have no choice because it&#39;s No-Drop so nobody else can get it for you, and in the case of B.. well you will be saving your pennies a long long time.    So, I think that you will find yourself camping in levels to come and you will realize pretty quickly why people are complaining about it =)<br/>

&gt; I hope you are all successful.  Personally, I am too impatient to camp for<br/>
&gt; items, even if it it only takes an hour.  So if your protest helps in that<br/>
&gt; regard, I am sure it will benfit me as well.  My approach is to just play<br/>
&gt; the game, amass experience and wealth, and hope that I can buy what I need.<br/>
&gt; Mind you , I&#39;m only 16th level now, so in the future, I may need to camp for<br/>
&gt; stuff.  But so far, I have not camped for a single thing, I am happy with<br/>
&gt; what my character can and can&#39;t do, and have no complaints about world<br/>
&gt; called Norrath. The only complaints I have I can live with, and they mostly<br/>
&gt; have to do with the UI of the game and with GM conduct.<br/>

&gt; Aye, but looking at it from your perspective you could consider that if the<br/>
&gt; sit-in is successful, it&#39;s possible that the 8 hour camps could be reduced<br/>
&gt; which would give you LESS time to sit around on purpose (camping for<br/>
&gt; items)...  =)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It all depends on how you look at it...<br/>

&gt; &gt; Well, I&#39;m taking this sit in from a different perspective.  I only get a<br/>
&gt; few<br/>
&gt; &gt; hours of play time a week, and I think that I&#39;d rather use it playing the<br/>
&gt; &gt; game as opposed to sitting around.  I do enough sitting around, what with<br/>
&gt; &gt; trying to find a group and all to play in.  I sure don&#39;t want to do it on<br/>
&gt; &gt; purpose.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Just my thought.<br/>
