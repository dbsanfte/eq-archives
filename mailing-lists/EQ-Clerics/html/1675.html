<div id="ygrps-yiv-1691548397">Personally, I prefer using a 1h blunt weapon, for the simple fact that it<br/>
gives me the option to carry something in my offhand that will allow me to<br/>
do some decent damage if need be.  I&#39;ve been extremely pleased with my<br/>
enamelled black mace and testament of vanear combination that I&#39;ve started<br/>
using recently.  Enough so that I got rid of my staff of observers just last<br/>
night.  But weapon choice is really just a matter of what you feel like<br/>
doing personally.  If you&#39;re already sufficiently advanced in one area (much<br/>
better in 2h blunt than 1h blunt, for instance), then you&#39;re going to hate<br/>
trying to train up the other skill, as it&#39;s going to probably take quite a<br/>
while to do to match your other weapon skill.  There are great weapons for<br/>
both 1h & 2h blunt, so go with whatever you find suits your playing style.<br/>
  I have a question for anyone who might know the answer.  Is it possible to<br/>
use both the Paw of Opolla and the Testament of Vanear at the same time?<br/>
I&#39;m part of the way through the Paw quest now that I got the ToV quest<br/>
finished, and just curious to know whether or not when I get the Paw I can<br/>
hold both at the same time.  (Hey, who would turn down +19 wis total?<br/>
 ^_^  ).<br/>
