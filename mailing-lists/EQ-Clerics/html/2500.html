&gt; I&#39;m positive that&#39;s what it was referring to, I posted the original<br/>
message! :) Here&#39;s what I wrote:<br/>
&gt; -----------------------------------<br/>
&gt; Gordon,<br/>
&gt; Congrats on your new position. I am glad to see Verant has put a person in<br/>
&gt; charge of bringing user issues before the dev team / management team, etc.<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; hope this will go far to improve communication with Verant and the<br/>
players.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There are a lot of issues that need to be addressed, but the one I&#39;d like<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; bring to your attention in this thread is the new class quest armor. For<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; record, I play a Dark Elf Cleric, and I was thrilled to see that new<br/>
quests<br/>
&gt; would be available to me (DE Clerics don&#39;t have a lot of quests - actually<br/>
&gt; zero for them specifically). I&#39;m sure a lot of other classes have the<br/>
similar<br/>
&gt; complaints, so I&#39;m not just talking about the Cleric armor (and Caduceus)<br/>
&gt; quests, but it is the only class armor I can comment on in specifics.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When Brad talked about removing Rubicite from the game, one of the reasons<br/>
&gt; entioned was to reduce camping. Herein is the problem I&#39;d like to address.<br/>
&gt; The Cleric armor (and others) requires a lot of camping! Two items in<br/>
Kithicor<br/>
&gt; spawn once every 7-8 hours and require you to sit and watch one spot for<br/>
it to<br/>
&gt; appear. I have to admit a bit of luck in that I logged out near the item<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; logged in right after the servers came back up from a patch to get these<br/>
items.<br/>
&gt; This isn&#39;t really questing, it&#39;s more finding the loophole in the system!<br/>
&gt; Also, many of the other items require camping a rare spawn in order to get<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; item. These creatures (Babinsport, Bilge, Gull for some) spawn once every<br/>
7-8<br/>
&gt; hours, and also have placeholders! So what happens is that you end up<br/>
sitting<br/>
&gt; in an area camping, waiting for the rare spawn to appear. To make matters<br/>
&gt; worse, some quest NPCs are also dropping good non-quest items, or quest<br/>
items<br/>
&gt; for other classes, making them very heavily camped. Also, they tend to<br/>
appear<br/>
&gt; in areas where there isn&#39;t a whole lot else to do. Babinsport for one,<br/>
spawns<br/>
&gt; in Befallen, and there&#39;s not a lot to do for a 35th level character in<br/>
&gt; efallen.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So, My point is that camping hasn&#39;t really been reduced, just spread out.<br/>
What<br/>
&gt; would I like to see? I would like to see someone address and comment on<br/>
this<br/>
&gt; issue. If the intent was to spread out the camps so that everyone isn&#39;t<br/>
sitting<br/>
&gt; in Cazic Thule, that&#39;s one thing. But a lot of people (myself included)<br/>
were<br/>
&gt; under the impression that the quests were suppose to reduce camping<br/>
entirely.<br/>
&gt; Could you or someone else comment on the rare spawns in the class armor<br/>
quests?<br/>
&gt; Were they intentional? Were they supposed to reduce camping times or just<br/>
&gt; spread it out? Will they be changed? Are we just being stupid and doing<br/>
&gt; something wrong?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; All the classes have issues with the stats for the armor, and I personally<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t want to go there. I just want to know what is the theory behind the<br/>
&gt; camping for these items. I sat and camped the Troll SK in befallen to get<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; BC and I really hated camping! I would love to get my class armor, but I<br/>
know<br/>
&gt; I won&#39;t, because of the camping involved. Thank you for your time and<br/>
attention.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;My Question is when did you see this posted and are you sure they are<br/>
&gt; &gt;referring to Quest armor?  With this last patch they made the drop rate<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; &gt;class specific armor in the Planes more frequent.  Just don&#39;t want anyone<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; &gt;get hopes up if they are not talking about quest armor<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
