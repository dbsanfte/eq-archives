<div id="ygrps-yiv-1888925567">Your mana is based on how much wisdom you have.. did you put any points into <br/>
wisdom? Plus at level 1-2 you shouldn&#39;t have a whole lot of mana anyways. <br/>
And if Minor Healing healed more it wouldn&#39;t be minor would it? =)<br/>

&gt;Subject: [EQ-Clerics] My Experience With a Level 2 Cleric<br/>
&gt;Date: Sun, 22 Aug 1999 18:45:24 -0400<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     I just created a Cleric today and got him up to level 2.  At the guild <br/>
&gt;shop I noticed so many classes of spells...attack spells, healings spells, <br/>
&gt;and other spells were all handled by different NPC&#39;s.  I&#39;ll be spending A <br/>
&gt;LOT of money on spells.  I do have a minor gripe with clerics, though.  <br/>
&gt;They just don&#39;t have enough total mana, and the Minor Healing spell isn&#39;t <br/>
&gt;strong enough.  I was grouped up with a Warrior and after wasting all of my <br/>
&gt;mana healing him four times, only half of his health had grown back.  <br/>
&gt;Clerics need more mana!  What do you think?<br/>
