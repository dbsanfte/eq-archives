<div id="ygrps-yiv-659856353">I bet to differ about it being better than a Glowing Crook.  The peacekeeper staff is damage 4 delay 30 if i know my stuff, and compared to the damage 11 and delay 35 of the crook, that is no contest.<br/>

Also i use a crook so its a biased opinion, but make your own opinion ;)<br/>

    I was also wondering how to make the Peace Keeper Staff. I know that it is better than a Glowing Crook Staff and I was wondering if anyone knew how to build it. Can u give me location of parts and how to assemble. Thanks a bunch ! <br/>

         The pieces of mallet head and handle are part of the Thex Mallet quest.  It is basically an evil quest because the NPCs you need to talk to are dark elves.  There is a third piece on the zombie Commander Windstream in Befallen (level 20+ zombie), but to assemble the pieces you have to go to Neriak.  I dont have the stats on hand, but you can find it in EQ`Lizer (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.gamez.net/eq)">http://www.gamez.net/eq)</a> and people I know who have it say its more useful in the throwing slot because it gives +sv magic I believe.Allsar Olath`Vlos - Rathe <br/>
