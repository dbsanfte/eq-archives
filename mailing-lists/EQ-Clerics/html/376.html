<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-989060634">I agree with you about the lagginess of unrest.  I think it&#39;s mainly<br/>
due to the fact that its such a small zone.  Theres always lots of<br/>
movement there, especially during a fresh spawn.  And, as far as I&#39;m<br/>
concerned, 55 is too many for a zone of that size.  One thing that has<br/>
helped me with my lag is turning off any video effects.  I believe it&#39;s<br/>
particle effects but I&#39;m not sure (at work).  It helps with video lag<br/>
tremendously.  The only downside (if you consider it a downside) is<br/>
that you cant see the &quot;fireworks&quot; that come with the spells and you<br/>
cant see rain or snow.  It doesnt affect the game play and I really<br/>
dont miss out on it =)<br/>
<br/>
Another thing that tends to slow me down is my sound card.  It&#39;s an<br/>
onboard and it sucks.  I keep my 3d sound off and go about my business.<br/>
 It&#39;s not bad, just not as many sound effects.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helped some!<br/>

&gt; Last night (or this morning, depends on how you look<br/>
&gt; at 12am), I was in<br/>
&gt; Unrest was a group of 5 for a while.  I did a /<br/>
&gt; which will tell ya who&#39;s in<br/>
&gt; the zone and it said there were only 55 people in<br/>
&gt; Unrest.  Yes 55 people but<br/>
&gt; still laggy as crap in there.  I got attacked by a<br/>
&gt; Werebat and some kinda<br/>
&gt; skel maybe a monk can&#39;t remember but I could not see<br/>
&gt; them at all, thats<br/>
&gt; happened to me in Steamfont with Minos.  It&#39;ll say<br/>
&gt; you are hit by a Mino for<br/>
&gt; whatever but you can&#39;t see them.  But anyways I take<br/>
&gt; off from the Werebat<br/>
&gt; and Skel just to be killed by a Hag.  But running<br/>
&gt; even with SoW on ya in<br/>
&gt; Unrest can be a pain cause of the lag.  At times it<br/>
&gt; wasn&#39;t bad at all but<br/>
&gt; other times WOW lag slowed ya down a lot.<br/>
&gt; Also looted a corpse someone left in Unrest to find<br/>
&gt; a Small Bronze Collar.<br/>
&gt; Heard it was worth maybe 10-12pp but sell it to a<br/>
&gt; store and they only wanna<br/>
&gt; give ya 8gp, yeah right like I&#39;d take 8gp for a<br/>
&gt; Bronze Collar.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I know, I know, Rodcet Nife isn&#39;t as crowded as<br/>
&gt; &gt; many of the other servers, but it can still be<br/>
&gt; &gt; crowded.  I suggest searching for new areas.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; have found a zone that has never had more than 25<br/>
&gt; &gt; people in it since I have been there.  Exp. is<br/>
&gt; &gt; great and I am making about 60pp a day in loot.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Did I mention that I now have full bronze from<br/>
&gt; &gt; this same zone?  I am not a level 49 player<br/>
&gt; &gt; either.  I made 18 last night and I already have<br/>
&gt; &gt; two bubbles of exp. toward 19.  I have all the lvl<br/>
&gt; &gt; 19 spells bought, an incredible amount of jewelry,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and over 500pp in the bank.  Once again I implore<br/>
&gt; &gt; you to travel and to form 6 member groups.  If you<br/>
&gt; &gt; hear about a great place then every one else has<br/>
&gt; &gt; also.  Find your own area.  There are many that<br/>
&gt; &gt; are hardly ever visited and you&#39;ll have your<br/>
&gt; &gt; cloice on what, when, and where to kill.<br/>
