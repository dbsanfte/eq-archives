I loved Daggerfall. I saved often because the bugs were predictable and I&#39;d<br/>
just realize that it was part of the game.<br/>
<br/>
But everytime you played, everything worked the same.<br/>
<br/>
The fact it had bugs does not invalidate what I said.<br/>
<br/>
I wish it ran on my current computer. It would do well for those times<br/>
when I could not play Everquest still :)<br/>

&gt; Heheh, what a perfect example of a game that ships bug free.   LOL.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; If you want a game that never changes, do not play an online game. Buy one<br/>
&gt; &gt; of the off the shelf games. Daggerfall. Or something like taht. Online games<br/>
&gt; &gt; will change on you.<br/>
