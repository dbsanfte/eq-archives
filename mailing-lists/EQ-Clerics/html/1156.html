<div id="ygrps-yiv-923883661">Well my idea agrees with Mik, forget dictionary definitions a gods divine<br/>
aura is there to get you out of the preverbial but not get stunned to death<br/>
till his mighty shield crumbles and so the last 2 bubbles if you were lucky<br/>
vanish.<br/>
<br/>
But then I accept their explanation at least we have one as it is their<br/>
world that they didnt want this to be too powerful; it is their world and<br/>
they are the gods.<br/>
<br/>
Shame i think we should be able to cast spells while totally<br/>
invulnerable...j/k no flames please....<br/>

&gt; Sorry, can&#39;t agree with you on the stun issue either.  Doesn&#39;t make ANY<br/>
&gt; sense to me, much less total as it does to you. If you have been given the<br/>
&gt; ability by the gods to put a &quot;divine&quot; shield around yourself and make<br/>
&gt; yourself invulnerable from being hit, then you shouldn&#39;t be able to be<br/>
&gt; stunned because the critter MUST hit you to stun you.  Quite simply, you<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t get stunned if you can&#39;t get hit.  Now, if they would&#39;ve said Divine<br/>
&gt; Aura is strictly a spell to prevent you from taking any DAMAGE from a hit<br/>
&gt; but not to prevent you from BEING hit, then that is different.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  But in my opinion, if we have the ability to cloak ourselves from damage,<br/>
&gt; it should include ALL damage, including stuns.  Because stun to me IS a<br/>
form<br/>
&gt; of damage even though it does not reduce your hps.  It renders you<br/>
incapable<br/>
&gt; of moving, which to me, is STILL a type of damage. Just like the blinding<br/>
&gt; light spell.....its effects, aka damage, aren&#39;t reflected in loss of hps<br/>
but<br/>
&gt; it DOES damage to you by rendering you incapable of seeing.<br/>
