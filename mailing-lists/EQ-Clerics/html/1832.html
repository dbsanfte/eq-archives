<div id="ygrps-yiv-1690261586">Hi all.  I&#39;d like to give props out to you all, and everyone on the<br/>
eq-cleric forum at stratic. (if any of you do both of these)<br/>
So far that forum and this list is easily, from what i&#39;ve seen, most of<br/>
the maturist ppl in this game..mind you, there are always exceptions.<br/>
Well anyways, I&#39;ve run into real life head on, and basically my playing<br/>
time has become very short, to almost non existant.. :(<br/>
I&#39;m currently lvl 20, and am finding myself getting somewhat<br/>
frustrated.  I have a few wizards in the group of ppl that I play with<br/>
(all higher lvl though) and I am able to occasinoally go to multiple<br/>
zones.  I&#39;m having an extremely tough time finding a group.  Now, I know<br/>
my name has not been tarnished, unless it&#39;s been by an adolescent, so I<br/>
rule that case out.  My friends say this is a tough time for a cleric to<br/>
find groups because our heal spell isn&#39;t that effective (which I<br/>
agree).  But, being the poor melee&#39;ers we are, I can&#39;t solo (one<br/>
exception..If I can do 2 things..1) find undead available to kill 2)<br/>
root holds).<br/>
I&#39;ve been to unrest, lake rathe, oasis, bird citie (south karana? or<br/>
north..can&#39;t remember), perma, and basically I never get tells back from<br/>
anyone.  Now one thing I&#39;ve noticed is that the number of clerics has<br/>
risen, and groups will often tell me, &#39;sorry, we already have a<br/>
cleric&#39;.  And I&#39;m not sure why they wouldn&#39;t want another one! Oh well,<br/>
I throw that away assuming they are playing their first character.<br/>
Anyways, I was basically just looking for a place to hunt and that I can<br/>
easily get a group.  It sucks when you might have 2 hours to play a<br/>
week, and you spend 1 hour advertising for a group...<br/>
Or is it possibly I&#39;m going to have to do my best to find a place to<br/>
solo undead for 4 levels?<br/>
<br/>
Any and all help would be appreciated.<br/>
TIA<br/>
