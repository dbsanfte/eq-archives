<div id="ygrps-yiv-1073115212">Just be careful with it because the scarecrows seem to have very good magic<br/>
resistance... I never had very good luck soloing them until they got to be<br/>
blue.  I was able to solo white ones some times but I had some &quot;even&quot; fights<br/>
go horribly wrong.    You might want to consider binding yourself right on<br/>
the edge of the zone, instead of near the field... that way you can try to<br/>
go after blacks and yellows and if it does go badly you can spook and gate.<br/>
<br/>
The scarecrows were very good xp for me, when I had the field to myself...<br/>
but a lot of times I&#39;d find myself competing with a couple of other<br/>
rangers.. and unfortunately tracking is a lot more effective than sense the<br/>
dead... if there are 2 or 3 other people there, you may as well go hunt<br/>
someplace else becasue there aren&#39;t enough scarecrows for everybody.<br/>

&gt;&gt;If you feel lucky you can solo selected scarecrows when you get up a level<br/>
&gt;&gt;or two.<br/>

&gt;I&#39;ve seen this strategy before. You need three spells. (I used this with<br/>
&gt;Mummies in LFay) Root, spook undead, and ward/expulse undead.. Stand back,<br/>
&gt;root it. If it runs at you, or when it breaks free, spook it, then root<br/>
&gt;again. Use your nuke to take it down. You can usually take down yellow MOBs<br/>
&gt;without taking more than 1-2 bubbles of damage. (You&#39;ll probabily have to<br/>
&gt;tank the last little bit when you run out of mana)<br/>
