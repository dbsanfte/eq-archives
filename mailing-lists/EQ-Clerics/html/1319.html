<div id="ygrps-yiv-362850196">Hello, I am a fist time poster.  I just recently got to level 14.  There are<br/>
lot of nice spells for me to get.  Of course i want them all, but being able<br/>
to afford them is different story.  I was able to buy: Bind Affinity,<br/>
healing, Smite, and Expulse Dead, which others should i really try to get?<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
