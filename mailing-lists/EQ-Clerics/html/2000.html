<div id="ygrps-yiv-731697179">Drink 5 decent brews, now ure strength and sta will be higher. I think<br/>
it starts increasing them at around 3 or 4 brews. Drink them in a row.<br/>
<br/>
Personally I don&#39;t care if you don&#39;t believe me but its easy to test,<br/>
drink as many brews as possible to the point that u are smashed beyond<br/>
belief (180 vision swaying and the message &quot;You can not possibly get any<br/>
more intoxicated) now when I did it my str and stamina rose a few points<br/>
and my int and agi/dex went through the floor. In theory once you have<br/>
high tolerance the good effects happen before or out weigh the bad<br/>
effects. Note 1 drink won&#39;t do it. I have also heard the quality of the<br/>
alcohol effects the overall happenings (don&#39;t know if thats true).<br/>

&gt; Hmmm... my alcohol tolerance is up to 140 and I still do not get an increase<br/>
&gt; in strength.<br/>
