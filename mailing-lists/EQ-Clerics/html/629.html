<div id="ygrps-yiv-1194676296">Don&#39;t get me wrong.  I value your input, I really do.  But I&#39;ve got<br/>
one word for you - &quot;punctuation&quot;.  Love it, use it.  Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
And while you&#39;re at it, take a little time and proofread.<br/>
It&#39;s &quot;spectres&quot; btw.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;         Okay the sentries is on an Isalnd with gargoyles and specteres on <br/>
&gt;it<br/>
&gt;dont worry spectetres ar3 part of her duty (ill explain it in a minute) <br/>
&gt;from<br/>
&gt;the sister dock go straight out to the goblin island you will come to the<br/>
&gt;Oracle if you face his directionj teh follow the shore to your left adn <br/>
&gt;keep<br/>
&gt;an eye on your right youll see an island come to view shes on this one swim<br/>
&gt;straight out and when you get on the island she spawns to the right of <br/>
&gt;where<br/>
&gt;you first hit shore. What happens when she spawns go     shell sit there <br/>
&gt;for<br/>
&gt;about a minute andf then go and confront the 4 specteres in the middle of<br/>
&gt;the island and of course she dies now whether or not the potion will keep<br/>
&gt;her alive im not sure on Povar she has not spawned since i have been there<br/>
&gt;but about 2 times and i have been on that island for about 3 weeks i think<br/>
