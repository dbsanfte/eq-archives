&quot;Go to Befallen.  It&#39;s a great place for a cleric your level [level 9].<br/>
I spent levels<br/>
9 - 16 in Befallen in beta and had a blast.&quot;<br/>

Go to Befallen as a level 9 cleric? HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!<br/>
<br/>
Oh my, that was a good one Mikaela. *shakes head in friendly disbelief*<br/>
:)<br/>

Wixn, PLEASE don&#39;t go to Befallen until you are at least level 15, and<br/>
have an experienced group with you. Even then, you will most likely find<br/>
yourself spending many happy hours trying to recover your corpse. The<br/>
problem is that you will quickly get bored with the first level, and<br/>
will convince yourself that the lower levels can&#39;t be all that bad.<br/>
Well, they are. And the loot isn&#39;t all that great, either.<br/>
<br/>
Trust me, I have many friends who swear they will never return to that<br/>
place. And these people are good players.<br/>

P.S. I know there are probably some of you out there who actually love<br/>
Befallen, but PLEASE, can we at least agree that Wixl shouldn&#39;t go to<br/>
Befallen until at least level 15?<br/>
<br/>
P.P.S No hard feelings, Mikaela :)</div>
