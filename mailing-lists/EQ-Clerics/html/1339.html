Ok, well i didn&#39;t play EQ last night so I din&#39;t actually read the new patch<br/>
for myself, but I was on Battlecom with a friend who read it to me. Am I<br/>
under the correct assumption that they nerfed our buffs??  I am told that<br/>
they do not last nearly as long as they used to. This Whole new patch from<br/>
my understanding is the icing on the cake for Verant, they really get first<br/>
prize for F@#$ing the game up.<br/>
<br/>
All of the High level clerics who have ever hunted in Sol B or L Guk, or<br/>
have helped a Paladin friend kill Sir Lucan, knows what its like buffing to<br/>
prepare for these events.  ok so now our buffs don&#39;t last half as long as<br/>
they did and if you don&#39;t have a manastone or an enchanter, that leaves us<br/>
pretty much screwed. the time it takes to regain mana after buffing, you<br/>
will have to start buffing over again. Verant does everything they possibly<br/>
can to screw with each class and the success people have in the game.<br/>
<br/>
I feel extremely sorry for the druids and the necromancers of the game, i<br/>
know everyone has their own opinions about kiting, but lets face it, this is<br/>
what these classes do, now they have screwed up DOTs, they have made SoW<br/>
only last like 10 minutes instead of about 25,I bet they f$%^ed up snare as<br/>
well, and they nerfed all the pets.<br/>
<br/>
Ok and the KING of all Verants high and mighty decisions. LETS NOT FIX A<br/>
PROBLEM LETS JUST MAKE SOMETHING ELSE WORSE. Point in case, The Box of<br/>
Abu&#39;kar 100% weight reduction, Verants code F&#39;d up and lvl 6 mobs were<br/>
dropping them in Butcherblock or something similiar, SO the almighty Verant<br/>
instead of Fixing the damn goblins went and Changed the Box. Beware if you<br/>
are a meleeist with a variety of weapons when you log into the Game you will<br/>
be encumbered.   I think it was quite nice of them to change the box from<br/>
100% to a measly 10%. SO hence don&#39;t fix the problem just screw everyone<br/>
over.<br/>
