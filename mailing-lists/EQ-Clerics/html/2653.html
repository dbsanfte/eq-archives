While I already have a complete set of the quest armor, I wanted two things changed: the quests made easier and the stats improved.  I got shot down on two counts :(<br/>
<br/>
The paladin armor is now actually at least AS easy as the cleric quests, the blacksmithing skill requirement was removed some time ago; now you can make the armor with a VERY low (non-existent?) skill.  I know a friend who is getting the armor now and he only has a smithing skill of 26 and has made 3 pieces so far.  Yes, some of the paladin armor molds require components from rare MOBs (plague sharks, undead cyclops) but no worse than camping Bilge/Gull, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Plus, the patch message is (intentionally?) vague on how it is easier to get the Ro armor.  For all we know, Verant simply makes 2 undead cyclops spawn in all of Norrath in a 24 hour period instead of 1...........<br/>

  Warning... a serious rant follows:<br/>
   <br/>
  [Rant begins]<br/>
   <br/>
  I just read the patch notes for the new patch and I must say I am EXTREMELY displeased.   I&#39;ve been hearing rumors for a couple of weeks from many different sources that this new patch was going to improve the situations clerics have with the HORRIBLE camps the have to do to get their armor.   Well, this patch seems to have enhancements for just about everyone except clerics.  Not one single thing in it to effect clerics.  Even the armor of Ro, they say they are chaning it to increase the drops.  That is just BS.  I will be the first to admit that the paladin armor quests are hard.  They are very very hard.  But they aren&#39;t hard becasue of the rarity of drops!!!!  Most of their stuff drops relatively often... though it is hard to get (i.e. the caudrons in mistmoore).    How many days now have I been camping that freaking Aviak in the OOT???  Just about every cleric i&#39;ve talked to who is trying to get that, has been camping it for like 2 months and not gotten it.  Those who have gotten it say it took them about 2 months.  What&#39;s worse is that I still have 3 or 4 camps to do that are as bad or worse.  This is absolutely absurd.  People like me with jobs and lives outside of EQ cannot possibly do these quests and it just pisses me off to no end.    I had thought that there was going to be some relief with his patch... maybe there will be and it just wasn&#39;t documented... but seeing as how they documented enhancements for just about every single other person in norrath  I really doubt it.   I guess all the feedbacks from every cleric in Norrath just doesn&#39;t matter to Verant.   <br/>
   <br/>
  [rant done]<br/>
   <br/>
  Heh.. well i won&#39;t stop trying for the armor.. i&#39;m determined to get it which makes me wonder about my own sanity since i probably won&#39;t even wear it in most situations.  I just want it for pride.. and it will make something very nice to wear to events like weddings and stuff.    Though it&#39;ll be months and months before i have it anyway...<br/>
