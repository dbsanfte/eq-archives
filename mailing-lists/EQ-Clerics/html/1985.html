<div id="ygrps-yiv-293273807">Sorry, Drogo, but I have to disagree here with you on complete heal.  I am<br/>
level 50 cleric and have found CH (complete heal) to be the most mana<br/>
efficient and useful heal spell I have when it comes to healing my level 50<br/>
tanks, such as my husband Donzi, who is a level 50 warrior with almost 3400<br/>
hps fully buffed.<br/>
<br/>
The whole key to CH is understanding the length of casting time and timing<br/>
when to cast it.  When Donzi, or one of my other high level tanks with tons<br/>
of hps, is taking the primary beating for the group, I begin to cast it when<br/>
they are down to about 2 and a half bubbs of health.  It generally goes off<br/>
when they hit about one or one and a half bubbs of health, so I restore<br/>
close to 2700 hps or more of health for only 250 more mana pts than it cost<br/>
me to restore only 600 hps with superior heal.  And yes, I do this in combat<br/>
as well as afterwards.  Once again, the whole key to CH is your timing.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously you aren&#39;t going to use CH on casters or other group members who<br/>
don&#39;t have such high amts of hps.  I use superior heal for them.  But for<br/>
saving mana and getting your big tanks with over 3000 hps back to full<br/>
health, nothing beats CH IMHO.<br/>

&gt;      Does anyone else think Complete Heal is an almost useless spell in<br/>
&gt;      combat situations?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      This spell has one of the longest delays for a cleric so it is very<br/>
&gt;      dangerous to use in combat situations.  I think the only cleric spell<br/>
&gt;      that takes longer to cast is shield of words.  The only time I found<br/>
&gt;      this spell usefull was when I was grouped with a L50 warrior since he<br/>
&gt;      had so many hp superior heal was only healing one bub of his health.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      Last night I was in LGuk and our group was camping the froglik King.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;      Now this guy hits hard and fast (140 double attacks) and I was<br/>
casting<br/>
&gt;      superior heals one after another just to keep our tank (L50 sk)<br/>
alive.<br/>
&gt;       There is no way I could have gotten off a complete heal during these<br/>
&gt;      fights.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      It also doesn&#39;t make much sence to me that it takes longer to<br/>
&gt;      completely heal someone than it does to ressurect them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      I think all of our healing spells need reduced casting times,  It&#39;s<br/>
&gt;      very frustrating when your tank looses their last 2 bubs of health<br/>
&gt;      when your trying to get a heal off just to see thoes blue sparkles<br/>
&gt;      around their corpse.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      Just something to think about.<br/>
