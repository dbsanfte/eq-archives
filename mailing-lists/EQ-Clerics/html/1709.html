<div id="ygrps-yiv-476002388">One of the new zones, the Temple of Solusek Ro, is currently us on the test<br/>
server.  As far as I&#39;ve heard, primarily a quest zone with few or no agro mobs<br/>
at this point.  I think it&#39;s likely that there will be some before they patch it<br/>
too us, but now it&#39;s just the quest NPCs.  I also hear that there IS a quest for<br/>
the Shadow Weapons in this zone.  The zone will be reached in lavastorm in the<br/>
tunnel that teleports you accross lavastorm (near Sol A & B entrance).  Kind of<br/>
strange, but supposedly you don&#39;t run into the zone entrance, you click on a<br/>
container laying on the groud (a bag).  This information was posted on another<br/>
list, so take it for what you will, but the guy who posted does play on the test<br/>
server (I haven&#39;t been on test in awhile myself).<br/>
<br/>
Something to look forward to<br/>
