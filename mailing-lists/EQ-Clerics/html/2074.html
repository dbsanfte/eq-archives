&gt; Hey! I never thought of that.  So where/when did you eventually end<br/>
&gt; up finding him?  And did you slaughter every shriveled mummy/ghoul/<br/>
&gt; skeleton in the entire zone to find him?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for the tip.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Not if you are a cleric,  you can use sense undead to track him.   It can<br/>
&gt; &gt;be hard if other undead are nearby but I did use it to track rhaotep<br/>
&gt; &gt;months ago.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;(Just happened to be lucky and find him, didn&#39;t use any method for when he<br/>
&gt; &gt;would spawn)<br/>
