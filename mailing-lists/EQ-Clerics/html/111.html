<div id="ygrps-yiv-1751907088">The pieces of mallet head and handle are part of the Thex Mallet quest.  It is basically an evil quest because the NPCs you need to talk to are dark elves.  There is a third piece on the zombie Commander Windstream in Befallen (level 20+ zombie), but to assemble the pieces you have to go to Neriak.  I dont have the stats on hand, but you can find it in EQ`Lizer (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.gamez.net/eq)">http://www.gamez.net/eq)</a> and people I know who have it say its more useful in the throwing slot because it gives +sv magic I believe.<br/>
