<div id="ygrps-yiv-97980780">Ran into this last night when a buddy of mine and me were killing Goonda.  One<br/>
of the Shaman&#39;s dropepd a fine steel warhammer that I had to drop so I could<br/>
re-arrange my inventory.  Tried to pick it up for the last hour we were there<br/>
with not luck.<br/>
<br/>
Killing Goonda and his cronies was a blast!  We had tried to get our Pally a GB<br/>
that day, and nothing in Upper Guk gives me any exp anymore, so we had bad<br/>
loot/no exp.  This was on top of the fact that we were supposed to go to<br/>
Mistmoore to get some items for me, another cleric, a monk, and our warrior.<br/>
Man, that is one of the most frustrating camps- even worse than Mitty (probably<br/>
because: 1. item wasn&#39;t for me, and 2. the shin lord 3 popped times in 9 hours).<br/>
Anyway- from Goonda we ended up with 1 chipped bone coller, 1 chipped bone<br/>
bracelet, 2 turtle shell helms, 1 batfang headband, and about 3 pieces of bone<br/>
armor.  Not a bad night after all!  It was a level 38 monk and a level 43 cleric<br/>
(me), we had no problems kicking that Ogre&#39;s butt outta West Karana.  I don&#39;t<br/>
think he&#39;s coming back, but I&#39;m checking tonight to make sure :)<br/>
