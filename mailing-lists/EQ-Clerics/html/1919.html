There is no way to take skills above your max.  You can&#39;t do it in &quot;the field&quot;<br/>
so to speak, or at the guild trainer.  A skill cap or maximum is the highest it<br/>
will ever go.  Our dodge will never go above 75 (maybe in the expansion, but I<br/>
doubt this).<br/>

&gt; mean, my dodge is maxed at 75.  Can I increase it to say 80 by<br/>
&gt; spending 5 points on it?  Granted it would be expensive, but I was<br/>
&gt; just curious. </span></blockquote></div>
