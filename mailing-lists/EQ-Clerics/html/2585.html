Most of our HP/AC buffs and DD spells go do up a couple points each level until<br/>
a certain level, after which they remain at the same point level.  Words of<br/>
Force (220 dam) and Banish Undead (585 dam) being the only two spells that I can<br/>
think of that remain the same once you get them, level 49 and level 44<br/>
respectively (possible Shield of Words- 31 AC, level 49).<br/>
<br/>
Of course, all spells eventually stop increasing at level 50.........<br/>

Example: Wrath does 198 points at 29th, 200 at 30, 202 at 31 and 204 at 32.<br/>
I just made 33 last night and haven&#39;t cast it yet so I am assuming it will<br/>
either go to 206 or stay at 204.<br/>
<br/>
Also, it&#39;s not only our DD spells, if you check your buffs they go up by a<br/>
point or 2 per level as well. Bravery gave me 122hp last level, now it gives<br/>
123.</div>
