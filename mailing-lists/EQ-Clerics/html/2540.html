<div id="ygrps-yiv-2020988800">There was a great little business on Fennin Ro called, Rokk and Rhunes <br/>
Emporium, hehe.  These 2 Ogres had this business going in Cazic doing the <br/>
very same thing.  At least one of them was there everyday. They had to have <br/>
made tremendous amounts of cash there.  It is very time consuming and takes <br/>
aways from the hunt quite a bit, but it is an easy way to make cash.<br/>
I also just recently noticed that there is a travelling person in South <br/>
Karana now, he starts out at the Bridge, announcing to the zone he is there <br/>
to change their money for them from Copper to silver, gold, etc...  He then <br/>
travels to different set locations, Centaurs, aviaks, etc... advertising as <br/>
he goes.  I&#39;m not sure how successful he is but seems like it would be <br/>
profittable.<br/>
