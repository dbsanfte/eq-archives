<div id="ygrps-yiv-1144202173">You need to speak up as your group is forming if you are going to be<br/>
specifically camping for an item that a cleric can use in addition to<br/>
casters and/or tanks.  Your group may not realize that is something that you<br/>
need.  Tell them you want in on a chance for the item.  If they say NO -<br/>
find another group to camp with.<br/>
