<div id="ygrps-yiv-1199475907">Okay *************** SPOILER ******************<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This info is from the bards list about the plane of fear, you have been<br/>
warned that it contains spoilers.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
******<br/>
THIS IS GONNA BE JUST CHOK FULL OF SPOILERS. DO NOT READ IF THIS SORT OF<br/>
THING RUINS YOUR FUN.<br/>
******<br/>
<br/>
Alright, i fancy myself some sort of veteran on the fear plane after quite<br/>
a few expeditions. Its hard. I die frequently being a bard of the 48th lvl.<br/>
Most are stupid deaths like the expedition splits up and i get ganked. A<br/>
few are just bad luck where 3 things show up and you get nailed too fast<br/>
for even a loh. When you zone in you will be on a hill top. 90% of the time<br/>
nothing will be near you and you can safely sit there for an hour. ONE time<br/>
i zoned in and got backstabbed for 400 by a scareling who then teleported<br/>
me away from the hill (never that far, but if you havent been there you can<br/>
run the wrong way and get into a lot of trouble). I died shortly after when<br/>
i got back to the hill and he ganked me from behind again with another<br/>
incredible backstab. My team zoned in right as a died. Ah well, after at<br/>
least 30 zone ins, thats only happened once.<br/>
<br/>
Right after you get into the fear plane and everybody is there, i recommend<br/>
heading south ( i think south) to the corner of the zone. Its just down the<br/>
hill and instead of running the risk of being hit from all 4 directions,<br/>
you only have to worry about one and a half. Then have some adventurous<br/>
soul pull to there. Haromony or the bard lull or a high lvl enchanter can<br/>
really help with pulling, otherwise you might get more than one which is<br/>
bad. Two sucks. Three you better have three full groups. 4, start thinking<br/>
evac. All of my fear plane expeditions have involved three full groups,<br/>
with everybody 40+. This makes it fairly safe, though at least one person<br/>
dies every hour. personal gates and evac all have the same chances of<br/>
succeding as everywhere else. I have witnessed no wierd behavior from<br/>
spells or songs, everything works as before. I especially loved it when i<br/>
used appaling screech on Cazic Thules fright henchman and he ran.<br/>
Delightfully ironic.<br/>
<br/>
A quick mob run down and some tactics :<br/>
Spiders drop cryosilk which is for the magi classes. The robe is incredible<br/>
and like nothing you have ever seen. Plus they drop a mage shield thats<br/>
like the shimmering orb.<br/>
Scarelings teleport you randomly around and like to backstab for outrageous<br/>
amounts of damage. The teleport is never that far, but if you get<br/>
disorientated and run the wrong way.... They drop nothing special that we<br/>
have found(besides high lvl words and runes, which are super common in the<br/>
fear plane, our lvl 50 necro just got her 49th lvl pet spell, and all the<br/>
wizs have their ice come runes).<br/>
Phantasms fear you which can cause all kinds of problems. They drop nothing<br/>
special<br/>
The little toads drop grey shaman armour and fear you also.<br/>
The worry wraiths drop the purple cleric armour and do something called<br/>
gravity flux. If you have levitate then you get thrown up like 10 feet and<br/>
you float down. If you DONT have levitate then look forward to upwards of<br/>
600 pts of damage from the fall. Bards are AWESOME for these because we<br/>
just turn on the group levitate song and nobody gets hurt and you dont ahve<br/>
to worry about the visible levitate bug.<br/>
Glare lords. Avoid these at all costs, they have a rain spell that can wipe<br/>
out an entire party in no time. if you are getting rained on by a glare<br/>
lord MOVE. Otherwise you will die, and die fast. They drop nothing special<br/>
that we have found<br/>
Boogeymen. My personal favorite :), they drop the gold bard only armour.<br/>
Boogeymen will fear you, but other than that they are a pushover. So far we<br/>
have found arms, gloves, and boots (boots i got myself).<br/>
Shiverback gorillas. my second favorite cause they just hit hard and dont<br/>
do any crazy stuff like all the other mobs. They drop monk only armour like<br/>
gloves that give serpentsight and a very visually unigue set of greeves. We<br/>
got 1 monk in our group that has almost the entire set and it looks great.<br/>
Amgdylan warrios drop the russet armour which is usuable by all plate<br/>
wearing classes including rogues and rangers. It looks like a sort of<br/>
copper or bronze sheen.  Great stuff.<br/>
Amgdylan knights drop the black shadow knight armour. They ht so watch it<br/>
Gorgons drop the green chain armour for druids. Got almost an entire set<br/>
already for one druid and it looks great. These guys stun for a long time<br/>
so carefull pulling them.<br/>
Tentacle Tormentors. Drop the green plate for rangers. These guys are just<br/>
like the ones found in najena, have your back to a wall when fighting them<br/>
Dracolich. So far he has dropped the bone razor (awesome rogue only dirk),<br/>
staff of undead legions (necro only staff), and some other staff that i<br/>
forget which only ogre and troll shamans can use.<br/>
Cazic Thule. Havent killed him yet cause the zone keeps crashing for us<br/>
everytime we almost have it cleared. Mass deaths always cause everytbody<br/>
logs in one at a time and gets slaughterd.<br/>
<br/>
So is it worth it? Definatly, the items are just incredible there. If its<br/>
armour, its no drop though. Thats all i can think of right now :)<br/>
