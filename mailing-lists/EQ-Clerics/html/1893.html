<div id="ygrps-yiv-1106479423">I&#39;m level 19, and I started noticing my melee skills start to go<br/>
downhill around level 14 or so.  When I get into a group, the idea is<br/>
that we are going to fight large quantities of stuff (like orcs in<br/>
Highhold, or King Crush and his cronies in CB), and I&#39;m needed for<br/>
healing and buffing.  As a Dwarf, you are probably better at melee<br/>
than a high elf (which I am), as my strength is only 75.<br/>
  Like someone else mentioned, if you are in a group with other<br/>
healers, you can slack off on the healing duties.  I LOVE grouping<br/>
with bards because their heal song usually keeps everyone topped off<br/>
on their hit points.  Druids are nice too, because they get healing<br/>
at 19 (the same spell we get at 14).  So at my level, a Druid is as<br/>
good a healer as I am.  Both of these can make a clerics life easier.<br/>
  I find that most people expect you to heal, since that is what we<br/>
are best at.  I mean, that&#39;s why you played the class, isn&#39;t it?  If<br/>
not, I suggest you switch to becoming a wizard.<br/>
  On the point that people say that all we do is heal/med/buff etc, I<br/>
think that is true to a degree, but the game is the game you make it.<br/>
I think it would be stingy of a cleric to get into a group and try to<br/>
melee and DD.  I mean it would be futile.  You&#39;d never hit with your<br/>
weapon.  Last night my group was fighting Dvinn and I never could hit<br/>
him.  There wasn&#39;t any casters in the group so my smite spell was a<br/>
nice way to bring his hit points down, but I used it sparingly to save<br/>
mana for heals.  If there had been a wizard in the group, casting<br/>
smite (78 damage at my level) is just a waste of time, since their<br/>
spells are already doing over 100.<br/>
  When it comes down to it, if you save a groups ass with a lot of<br/>
healing spells, they are going to love you for it, and ask you back<br/>
again and again.  But the game is what you make of it.  It is possible<br/>
to solo at all levels.  I can still solo scarecrows in West Karana.<br/>
They are blue to me.  I get more xp in a group though, and I have more<br/>
fun that way.<br/>
  And I&#39;d say that 103 wisdom is fine.  My High Elf has 112 base<br/>
wisdom.  Later on you will want to get more and more +wis items.<br/>

&gt;Okay, I am now lvl 10 and really concerned about this.  From what EVERYONE<br/>
&gt;tells me (which I totally disagree with and the whole subject matter makes<br/>
&gt;me sick) is that when older (25+) all we do is heal...no melee, no DD, just<br/>
&gt;heal and med.  First...is that true or can we still melee..I know we won&#39;t<br/>
&gt;exactly be able to solo melee...but as in a group or possibly as the only<br/>
&gt;tank?..and while on that subject, can we solo undead up into all our higher<br/>
&gt;lvls or do we still need help then too?  And finally the mana issue.  I am<br/>
&gt;dwarven cleric and have a 100 in strength and 103 in wisdom...will that be <br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt;high enough wisdom to have proper mana to heal my group and such?  Any <br/>
&gt;other<br/>
&gt;tips would be most helpful.<br/>

&gt;P.S.  Any good cleric websites with detailed spell descriptions (like how<br/>
&gt;much damage our spells deal, how much HPs our healing spells heal, and the<br/>
&gt;exact numbers on our buffs, etc)<br/>
