<div id="ygrps-yiv-458281200">Well I *love*my splintering club!<br/>
<br/>
Just kidding!<br/>
<br/>
Right now I use a 2H Bloodforge hammer. Though I am thinking of finding<br/>
something else, as it is rather heavy and has a high dly.  The damage is not<br/>
to bad though, 25 dmg quite consistently. But, as a halfling, I&#39;ll admit<br/>
that it is hard to swing, as my str is low.<br/>
<br/>
I did use a 1H FS morning star for a bit, and a 2H FS staff.  I think I&#39;d<br/>
like to get a good 1H weapon again, and some sort of magical thing for my<br/>
other hand.  I did use a shield in the past, but it has very little affect<br/>
on my AC.<br/>
<br/>
So my favourite?  I&#39;d say the hammer.  But I wouldn&#39;t mind getting rid of it<br/>
soon.<br/>

aye yes sianne *hugs* the BI medalion has wis and i beleive the hat does <br/>
too, got the med, working on the hat, and i use both 1h and 2h, they are <br/>
both at max for my lvl, when i am straight tanking i use the RTS, keeps me <br/>
maxed in 1h, and when i am the healer, i am useing the screaming mace with <br/>
the orb of slime.  as soon as i can i will have an observers staff for my <br/>
2h, and something equally as good for my 1h, just not sure on that one yet.<br/>
<br/>
anyway i try to keep them both maxed, and the only real reason to use a 1h <br/>
is so yer other hand can be free for a manna enhancer.  hope that helped<br/>

&gt;weapons...i am a little confused as to what i want to do....and one more<br/>
&gt;question...is there any blackened armor that has any +wis?<br/>
