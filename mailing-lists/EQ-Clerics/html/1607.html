&quot;If train is the cause to make to hate Befallen, pls<br/>
dont go there until lvl 30. I&#39;ve hunt there when I am<br/>
lvl 6, and I leave there at lvl 16 then go to unrest.<br/>
My other Paladin char is lvl 22 and will still die in<br/>
lvl 3 if play in solo. Also, I&#39;ve seem a lvl 22 char<br/>
die twice a night by elf skel, ghoul, necro train. So<br/>
if u dont want see any train, just dont go befallen<br/>
and unrest.<br/>

Bah. Trains are a part of life in every dungeon. You just have to be<br/>
smart enough to know your level&#39;s limits, and lucky enough to live a day<br/>
longer than the next guy. The point is simple: If you want to level<br/>
quickly, don&#39;t even think about befallen until you&#39;re level is<br/>
sufficient to survive a train or two.<br/>

P.S. Frankly, I&#39;ve never seen a level 6 person in Befallen. If you were<br/>
there at level six and had fun, then my hat goes off to you. Me, I&#39;d<br/>
rather hunt in Butcherblock at that level.</div>
