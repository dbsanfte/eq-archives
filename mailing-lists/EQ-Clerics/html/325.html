<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;RunnyEye SUCKS!!! Avoid it at all costs! Seriously, RunnyEye can be fun, but<br/>
&gt;I have died WAY too many times from Borxx (Evil Eye) so I avoid that place<br/>
&gt;like the plague. To me, I can do without any of the blackened items.<br/>
&gt;RunnyEye is good for level 7 and up, although it is really better suited for<br/>
&gt;levels 15 to 20 or so.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well at least you made it very clear what you think about that place... but<br/>
I personally liked that place since you had the constant fear for Borxx all the<br/>
time and we had some very close runs away from her. Once i had only 1 HP<br/>
left after zoning from Runnyeye... that inspired me to write a story to EQVault<br/>
titled &#39;Borxx got me... NOT!&#39; and had some great responses to that story. I<br/>
will certainly go back to Runnyeye just to finally see her slayed down when<br/>
I am done with Mistmoore... though it will probably take a few levels before<br/>
I will leave Faydwer again. I myself didn&#39;t die too many times there, and at <br/>
that time i didn&#39;t really care about it. I got past level 20 in there and i think i<br/>
leveled 4 or 5 times fighting in there. At 22 i went back to Faydwer.<br/>
