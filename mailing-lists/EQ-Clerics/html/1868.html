<div id="ygrps-yiv-1810789602">After having recently done that quest, I believe he spawns every 7-8 hours.<br/>
I had to camp him around 7 hours before he spawned.  A druid showed up after<br/>
I started camping him and when he did spawn it was a free-for-all.  Luckily<br/>
my Wrath did more damage than whatever DD the druid threw, so I got the<br/>
loot.  The druid was 2 levels higher, too.....<br/>
<br/>
Be patient, bring some friends if you are worried about getting KS by a<br/>
higher level player, and good luck.  Killing him is the hardest part of the<br/>
quest, the rest is very easy.<br/>
