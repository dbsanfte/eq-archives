<div id="ygrps-yiv-420414391">Well, finally got off me dwarf-butt and hit the trails to the area known as<br/>
west commons. Strolled on in to befallen, after running from a hill giant<br/>
and some dark-elf that wanted me blood, and what a fine place it is. Plenty<br/>
of undead to dispatch, although i will say that elf-skeleton beats the tar<br/>
out of me and have only killed it once in three tries, nasty ole elf. Is<br/>
there some rhyme or reason to this place, have collected 2 keys so far and<br/>
had a third, greenish one but it disappeared after i logged. What should i<br/>
be looking for and is there any neat items in this place? Have gotten an<br/>
occasional bronze wpn off greater skeletons , but for the most part its<br/>
bones and silver.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance<br/>
