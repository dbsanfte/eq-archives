Sometimes yes, sometimes no. The Ghost isnt what I&#39;d call a safe camp if<br/>
there are people that don&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing down there. I was<br/>
playing my newbie up in Unrest, and after 4 basement trains getting dropped<br/>
on my head within an hour, I decided it was time to take Ily down to have a<br/>
talk with them. A cleric friend accompanied me, and taught them the proper<br/>
way to camp the ghost (I just did alot of yelling :))<br/>
<br/>
Oddly, no more trains came out of the basement that night.<br/>
