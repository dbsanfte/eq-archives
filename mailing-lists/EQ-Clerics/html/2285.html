<div id="ygrps-yiv-1596228881">It is not that easy, now, to go around without being twinked. My experience<br/>
has been, without even asking, I have people I do not know giving me stuff.<br/>
<br/>
And how can I say No? I, myself, tend to pass on raw-hide etc sometimes<br/>
instead of selling it just because it makes me feel good. (I&#39;ve never gotten<br/>
to the point where I can get bronze myself.)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;     The game has changed a lot since I started (first week of release) so<br/>
&gt;     the items I had at various levels are a lot different that<br/>
&gt;what people<br/>
&gt;     have today.  I didn&#39;t know anyone that was high level that could help<br/>
&gt;     me out as there were very few high level chars and places like lower<br/>
&gt;     guk were largely unexplored.  Not to mention that permafrost wasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;     even itemized.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     When I was L10 I hadn&#39;t ventured out of misty thicket and was wearing<br/>
&gt;     patchwork/cloth with no magic items at all (except my hammer of<br/>
&gt;     wrath).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     By L20 I was fighting in oasis and was wearing mostly banded armor<br/>
&gt;     with a few patchwork pieces.  Still no jewelry beyond dervish rings.<br/>
&gt;     The one good item I did have was the crook from lockjaw when we were<br/>
&gt;     actually able to get the kill.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     By L30 I think I had mostly bronze plate from fighting in unrest and<br/>
&gt;     lake rathe and possibly some +4wis +2st rings, BI medallion and<br/>
&gt;     polished bone bracers (can&#39;t exactly remember).  Also might have had<br/>
&gt;     an enameled mace and mistmoor shield by this time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     In the low 30&#39;s is when I started to make some money from<br/>
&gt;mistmoor and<br/>
&gt;     when I moved to sol b at L34.  Then the good stuff started coming in<br/>
&gt;     :).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     Now compare this to what people have out there today and you can tell<br/>
&gt;     it&#39;s a lot different and I&#39;m not one to judge yourself on.  I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;     always felt that it&#39;s not the items that make you a good cleric.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     I sometimes feel sorry for new players out there now.  There are so<br/>
&gt;     many twinks running around in awesome equipment it must be<br/>
&gt;hard seeing<br/>
&gt;     someone that con&#39;s green wearing way better equipment than you are.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     Just remember, A naked L30 cleric could beat the crap out of a L20<br/>
&gt;     cleric with awesome equipment :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     Drogo DarkBane<br/>
&gt;     L50 Halfling Cleric<br/>
&gt;     The Rathe<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     P.S.  Were the other high level clerics on this list like this as<br/>
&gt;     well?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Well, I consider myself to be under equipped for my level<br/>
&gt;(getting harder to<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;say that now that I have some purple stuff) as I have had a few<br/>
&gt;items for<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;almost 30 levels now.  Anyway I&#39;ll give you a run down on the<br/>
&gt;items I wear.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;How about posting a list of what you were wearing at the milestones (lvl<br/>
&gt;&gt;10, lvl 20, etc) That way we could see what we should be looking for when<br/>
&gt;&gt;we reach those levels.<br/>
