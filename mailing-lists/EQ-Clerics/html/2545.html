<div id="ygrps-yiv-651782442">I&#39;ve been doing a similiar thing in Unrest lately.  Suprisingly, it isn&#39;t as<br/>
profitable as you might imagine.  At some points, it gets down right<br/>
annoying to do. I have made about 30pp doing it in one nite, but it does<br/>
become tiresome.  If you have the patience to do it, you can spend hours<br/>
trying to buy and sell.  But in my opinion, it just ends up being a waste of<br/>
time.<br/>

There was a great little business on Fennin Ro called, Rokk and Rhunes <br/>
Emporium, hehe.  These 2 Ogres had this business going in Cazic doing the <br/>
very same thing.  At least one of them was there everyday. They had to have <br/>
made tremendous amounts of cash there.  It is very time consuming and takes <br/>
aways from the hunt quite a bit, but it is an easy way to make cash.<br/>
I also just recently noticed that there is a travelling person in South <br/>
Karana now, he starts out at the Bridge, announcing to the zone he is there <br/>
to change their money for them from Copper to silver, gold, etc...  He then <br/>
travels to different set locations, Centaurs, aviaks, etc... advertising as <br/>
he goes.  I&#39;m not sure how successful he is but seems like it would be <br/>
profittable.<br/>
