<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Well, personally When I am playing I am hunting.  I work FT and by the time<br/>
&gt;I get on at night, we have to try and get together and do something before<br/>
&gt;someone has to go to bed, the weekends are a different story. I do spend<br/>
&gt;time helping others out and going into town and such.   I don&#39;t get much<br/>
&gt;time for &quot;travel&quot; and nice as it may seem to have a different outfit, My<br/>
&gt;group does not get items we do not need. There is enough camping for items<br/>
&gt;in the game now as it stands and for my group to camp a Mithril BP for me<br/>
&gt;&quot;for looks&quot; is not what we practice. I had a pair of ruby pants in the bank<br/>
&gt;but honestly i can&#39;t be bothered with carrying all that stuff around all the<br/>
&gt;time, just to impress people.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I too dislike the notion of item hoarding, and would not take a piece of<br/>
loot that someone else needed.  Up until about level 39 I was still wearing<br/>
a Lockjaw Vest, and although a sturdy piece of dress, was extremely lacking<br/>
in terms of appearance.  Fortunately, on the same day nonetheless, my group<br/>
I hunt with regularly looted a Mithril BP, and not half an hour I was able<br/>
to finally trade for a Bloodstained tunic, after looking for one for over 25<br/>
levels.  Bascially in travel mode I wear a Mithril BP and Mithril wrists,<br/>
and the rest is Rubicite (except for the helm those are icky).  During<br/>
battle I will take off my Mith bp for my BS Tunic, Rubi Legs for my Gator<br/>
legs, and Rubi Arms for my plat armband.  It&#39;s a horrid look but I&#39;ve found<br/>
that in delf form it&#39;s not so bad.  There&#39;s really no bothere in carrying<br/>
those 3 pieces of equipment, even the weight isn&#39;t so bad in all honesty.<br/>
<br/>
I fear you may confuse personal vanity with wanting to impress people.  I<br/>
don&#39;t wear my travel clothes because I want to impress people, I don that<br/>
garb, simply because it&#39;s aethestically pleasing to mine eyes.  Pure and<br/>
simple, I just want to look as best as I can, for my own tastes.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;My point being, that if they we going to make items for us to increase our<br/>
&gt;wisdom stats I think the designers could have done a better job of trying to<br/>
&gt;make them match for our class specifically.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d agree with this.. much the way fear armor is geared to each class<br/>
statwise in most cases.  It&#39;s unfornate that the rest of the time you&#39;ll be<br/>
a walking hodgepodge, until you can attain a full suit of fear armor,<br/>
especially since fear is close to impossilbe to breach.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Also, just my opinion Human females look like ass in Steel plate and/or<br/>
&gt;bronze armor. Full ruby and Mithril and the mist armor I like, but the<br/>
&gt;others don&#39;t appeal to me what so ever.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I personally don&#39;t like bronze meself, I can&#39;t stand the way any of the<br/>
plated helms look either.  But a full suit of Steel, Rubi, Mith, or Mist is<br/>
eye pleasing to me, sans the helms.  ;)<br/>
