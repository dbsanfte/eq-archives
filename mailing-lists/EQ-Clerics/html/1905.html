<div id="ygrps-yiv-1113294628">Can&#39;t Heal or Buff them, don&#39;t think any spells work on them except offensive<br/>
spells (DD, DOT, Debuff, etc).  Kill guards can be fun (glad I don&#39;t have a<br/>
quest that requires me to go inside of Neriak as that&#39;s one of my favorite<br/>
hunting grounds for pp and exp).  Training of guards on other players is a<br/>
bannable offense on several servers (on other servers you must explain that you<br/>
are training guards to protect your home- in essence &quot;role playing&quot; your race).<br/>
If someone trains, tell them to stop- if they continue, /petition or /report.  I<br/>
made a really good friend after a training incident- DE enchanter who trained us<br/>
turned out to be a really nice (although ignorant at the time) person.<br/>
