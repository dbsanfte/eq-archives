<div id="ygrps-yiv-1149594456">This has been my experience as well.  When fighting really high level<br/>
creatures (planes, dragons, etc), the time it takes to cast atone, you could<br/>
probably already be dead or well on your way.  I use seldomly have it<br/>
memorized during these times, however, I have tried this: When fighting one<br/>
creature, you could potentially cast a heal, atone the creature, cast a<br/>
heal, atone the creature therefore wiping it&#39;s memory, any ever tried this?<br/>

Regarding Atone:<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t bother using it in between heals for a number of reasons:<br/>
1)  You will aggro again as soon as you heal<br/>
2)  If you tanks know their job they will taunt mobs off you if you are<br/>
attacked<br/>
3)  Recharge time on atone is pretty long<br/>
4)  Mana is better saved for heals<br/>
<br/>
If your tanks are NOT doing the job of taunting off of you, it may be<br/>
because they are not watching group health bars.  Try making a hot key that<br/>
says something in groupsay to notify them you are being attacked.  Also, you<br/>
can cast Divine Aura on yourself (briefly making you invulnerable).  This<br/>
works effectively as an anti-taunt ;)<br/>
<br/>
Regarding Naltron:<br/>
<br/>
Get PP or gems from your tanks if you are running out of Peridots.  Or don&#39;t<br/>
cast it on them :)<br/>
