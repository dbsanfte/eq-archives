<div id="ygrps-yiv-1774040616">Has anyone else had much luck with Babbinsbort the gnome necro in<br/>
Befallen.<br/>
<br/>
I have been killing his placeholder ever 6-9 hours semi regulary (I<br/>
reckon I get 2 out of the 3 spawns a day) for over a week and a bit<br/>
now.. but all I&#39;ve been getting are plague rats, large skeletons and<br/>
giant rats.  I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m hunting in the right place.  It&#39;s in<br/>
the room next to the DE SK  (the left DE SK if you are facing as if you<br/>
have just come through the wooden door opposite the hidden wall in the<br/>
corridor) This spawn only spawns 3 times a day or so anyway so it&#39;s<br/>
sommat special.<br/>
<br/>
Is there anything else I should be doing to trigger his spawn or am I<br/>
just being very unlucky and who ever gets the other spawn each day is<br/>
getting Babbinsbort?  Did people clear out the level just before he  was<br/>
supposed to spawn? clear out the room? kill Gynok? kill Cmdr<br/>
Windstream?  any ideas on triggers people cos this is driving me mad. :)<br/>
<br/>
And why are all our quests in zones where there is nothing else close to<br/>
our level to hunt.. I wouldn&#39;t mind camping stuff if we could at least<br/>
get xp while we were doing it.. oh well.. this is turning out to be more<br/>
of a pain than the paw of opella was..<br/>
