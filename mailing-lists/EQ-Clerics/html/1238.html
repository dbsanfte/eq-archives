<br/>
I&#39;ve tried Unrest, Cazic Thulle, The Aviak Village, Lake Rathetier and a few other places and life seems to always come down to camping individual spawnpoints so badly that groups end up stealing pulls from one another - seems like at these places there are no living monsters save for the ones that spawn and are killed 30 seconds later...   <br/>

    my suggestion to you would be to meet ppl in guilds.....try grouping with them and such, and if they feel you&#39;re worthy, they will invite you in the guild....<br/>
    try unrest &lt;if the lag doesn&#39;t kill ya, the hag will <br/>
    LOL!  That sums it up perfectly! :^)<br/>
    (;  &gt; or maybe najena &lt;not sure of the level range there but it&#39;s worth a try&gt; <br/>
    Hmm... It seems a bit high, but I&#39;ll check it out nontheless.  <br/>
    Again, thanks for the informative response.<br/>

         A bit off topic, but does anyone know of any guilds on the Rathe that would suit a 21st level cleric?As the Rathe has aged and gotten a bit overcrowded, I find it harder and harder to find good people to group with as well as very difficult to find places to hunt that aren&#39;t crammed to 200% capacity. I was thinking perhaps that a guild might be able to help me here, by providing information and good groupmates...     Any ideas/comments?
