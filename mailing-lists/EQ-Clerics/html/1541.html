<div id="ygrps-yiv-1359502433">well unrest is just what it claims to be, UNRESTFULL, LOL, heh bad pun?  i <br/>
think not, i have many friends that have been there since 14, doing the yard <br/>
trash,(beetles and tormented dead) i on the other hand have been there <br/>
twice, had to leave cuz my BF wasnt happy after dying like 12 times in one <br/>
night(cant imagine why)*grins evilly* this happened on both occations that <br/>
we were there.  personally i find it exhilerating, it is how we learn.  the <br/>
ppl there that are successfull are mosty in good groups, against the wall(at <br/>
that lvl), and have a good puller.  My love says we can go back as soon as <br/>
we find a good group, i have been waiting for a long time, we group with a <br/>
few ppl that makes our lil group ROKK. only problem is we can&#39;t all seem to <br/>
get together at the same time and convince everyone to make the trip.  To be <br/>
successfull in unrest you first must be willing to die, unrest=train city, <br/>
but it rokks for exp and loot, try to find a group that you feel comfortible <br/>
with and hang in there or leave there for a time and go back around lvl 29. <br/>
may not have been a great help here but i tried.  ummm sianne, i am waiting <br/>
to go back hon!!! =0)<br/>

&gt;I was at Unrest at lvl 23 with a full group including a 2nd cleric.  The<br/>
&gt;place was horrible.  Death after death after death.  Between deaths and<br/>
&gt;running to the zone there were no points made.  The only time we were there<br/>
&gt;successfully was in a room (hand room) i think.  Then shortly a high lvl<br/>
&gt;cleric came in and ran us out....i am now almost lvl 27 and haven&#39;t been<br/>
&gt;back yet.  I may try to go back soon though...<br/>

&gt;&gt;I have heard from many many people that unrest is a great place for a<br/>
&gt;&gt;cleric<br/>
&gt;&gt;to go starting around 14 or so.  I am 17th (almost 18th) and am having<br/>
&gt;&gt;serious trouble there.  Last night 6 people from my guild were there, all<br/>
&gt;&gt;15-20 and we had a rough time.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;We were at the back wall pulling from the back door.  We had SoW and invis<br/>
&gt;&gt;to undead on the puller at all times, but there were many times where she<br/>
&gt;&gt;ended up bringing quite a few too many ghouls.  (tried to pull 1 and<br/>
&gt;&gt;suddenly there were 7 of them on us!)<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Are we hunting at too high a level, or are we pulling from the wrong <br/>
&gt;&gt;place?<br/>
&gt;&gt;Or do we just suck?  We only had 2 deaths last night, but many many many<br/>
&gt;&gt;close calls.  Lets just say thank god our druid was also saving 50% mana<br/>
&gt;&gt;for<br/>
&gt;&gt;heals.<br/>
