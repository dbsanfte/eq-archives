&gt; Thanks for that, but now I&#39;m really confused. I must of misunderstood LORE<br/>
&gt; items. I know you can have only one but I thought that made them no drop no<br/>
&gt; trade. Can anyone please explain why an item, other than the newbie stuff<br/>
&gt; and our summoned hammers might be No Drop. Or if they know of one.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks<br/>
