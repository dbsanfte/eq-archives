<div id="ygrps-yiv-1175302047">I am not flaming you, Azor. I know that you are just the deliverer of the<br/>
information that was posted. <br/>
But we are talking about another plane of existence. There should be some<br/>
serious side-effects for trying to enter a place of this magnitude. From<br/>
what I hear, this place has some of the rarest items in the game, and<br/>
god-like creatures roam the land freely. Setting foot in this place should<br/>
come with some consequence, much less getting close to it. I agree with the<br/>
gate idea. Also, I thought the passageway to the gate was guarded by 2 35+<br/>
level spectres? (could be wrong on that)<br/>
I&#39;ve never been near this place, but I don&#39;t think it would be too fun if I<br/>
could just stroll right in a grab that Cleric-only armor I&#39;ve been hearing<br/>
about.<br/>

&gt; Brad also talked about Plane of Fear and he&#39;s idea on how to keep low lvl<br/>
&gt; ppl out of it.  Heres what the post on EQVault said<br/>
&gt; &quot;Brad also stated that he was looking into a way to keep the low levels<br/>
&gt; out<br/>
&gt; of the Plane of Fear. Perhaps something like the gate leading to the plane<br/>
&gt; doing damage to those who walk through it. Thus killing any low level<br/>
&gt; player<br/>
&gt; before he even gets a glimpse of the plane.&quot;<br/>
&gt; Gee thats real fair, &quot;Hhhhmmm, I wonder what this gate is?&quot;  *ZAP kill!!!*<br/>
&gt; I say let them in but make it harder for low lvls, just like a low lvl<br/>
&gt; player wouldn&#39;t want to go to Unrest and if they did it&#39;s their fault when<br/>
&gt; they die.  Maybe put up a gate but around the gate have monster that would<br/>
&gt; jump low lvl players.  But for the gate to hurt EVERYONE and kill the low<br/>
&gt; lvls to me is very unfair.<br/>
