<div id="ygrps-yiv-704816029">The SSOL doesn&#39;t need to be charged unless you actually click on the weapon<br/>
to cleanse yourself.  It will cast Cleanse on you occasionally during<br/>
battle.  This is unlimited.<br/>

Well, it took me 2 trys, but i finally got the SSOL.  The first time the guy<br/>
tried to attack me, even though i ran there with SoW.  I think however that<br/>
somone started the quest, but never finished it.  So the guy took it out on<br/>
me. :)  When i got the SSoL the guy told me to talk to Whysia  in the Temple<br/>
Store House about recharging it.   Where is this Temple Store House?  Anyway<br/>
I just wanted to say thanks for all the previous help.</div>
