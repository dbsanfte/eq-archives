<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-316761581">Does anyone have any tips for solo-ing in Unrest?  I was there last<br/>
night on the test server.  I&#39;m a bar away from 21.  I start out in a<br/>
small group.  On the test server, there are around 15 people max in<br/>
Unrest at any given time.  So most people either skirt the outside,<br/>
or camp the front yard, and have someone pull from the house.  We<br/>
were pulling from the house, and the place was like grand central<br/>
station.<br/>
  The best time I&#39;d ever had in Unrest was when we had a 30+ level<br/>
druid in wolf form pulling for us.  We took out the entire second<br/>
floor without any problems.  But if the person pulling is low enough<br/>
level, they get way more than they bargained for.<br/>
  Well, I had to leave for a bit, and when I came back, the group was<br/>
full, so I decided to solo.  I cast invis to undead on myself, and I<br/>
would pull a ghoul, or a DB from the first floor.  The ghouls were<br/>
usually blue, sometimes green, but I always got xp for them.  The<br/>
Lurking mummys were tough, but I could solo those, but usually if I<br/>
/yelled for help.  But I tried to stick with ghouls and DBs.<br/>
  I figured that I could mem calm and calm extras, and would just be<br/>
able to pull one mob at a time.  I got nearly half a bar solo-ing, and<br/>
it worked pretty well. I ended up dying 3 times last night though,<br/>
from other peoples trains, and I ended up with slightly less xp than<br/>
when I started.  Anyone have any good advice for solo-ing this place?<br/>
