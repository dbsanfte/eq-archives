<div id="ygrps-yiv-2030611671">Someone made this comment:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I had been fishing while at the same time trying to raise my divination<br/>
skill, since I finally get a useful div spell - invis to undead, next<br/>
level.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And I reply:<br/>
<br/>
WHAT?? Come on, my friend! Flash of Light is a VERY useful spell. I use<br/>
it all the time when I&#39;m fighting blues. It works especially well on<br/>
Jonah Brucker, that Lake Rathe resident who kills unsuspecting players<br/>
who think that just because he&#39;s blue to them that he&#39;s a wussy. Believe<br/>
me, he hits fast and hard. And I mean HARD. (Once he hit me three times<br/>
in a row for 35 EACH time. And I hadn&#39;t even hit HIM yet!)<br/>
<br/>
WARNING!!WARNING!! If you&#39;re soloing, don&#39;t use flash of light on ANYONE<br/>
until you&#39;ve raised the skill to a point where it won&#39;t be resisted.<br/>
Common sense rules here, my friend. :) <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s my strategy for soloing him: Hit him with Smite (be forwarned,<br/>
sometimes he RESISTS smite), then as he&#39;s running toward you, blind the<br/>
bastard and run right through him. Then cast smite again, and watch him<br/>
run! While he&#39;s off running blind, meditate for a few seconds. Then,<br/>
when he runs back to you, melee him for a bit. (Better have a nice two<br/>
handed blund weapon, cause he&#39;s got great agility and will make your one<br/>
handed blunt weapon practically useless. I&#39;m talking 1 to 5 points of<br/>
damage, IF you manage to even hit him! Unless you have a very nice 1HB<br/>
weapon.)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, blind him again (you won&#39;t be able to cast smite while meleeing<br/>
him--he hits too damn fast), and run through him. Smite again, and watch<br/>
him run! Depending on your Wisdom level, you might be able to Smite once<br/>
or twice more. Do this, then melee him again. Hopefully, if you have<br/>
been lucky and have gotten some good hits, you&#39;ll kill him. If you have<br/>
to heal while fighting Jonah, you will probably die.<br/>
<br/>
WARNING!!WARNING!! Do NOT Fear Jonah. When Feared, Jonah might run to<br/>
the lake and get healed by the aquagoblin shaman who swims around in the<br/>
bay near Jonah&#39;s hut. If this happens, Jonah will come back at full<br/>
health AND in beserk mode, and YOU WILL DIE. I and two others who were<br/>
grouped found this out the hard way (yeah, my fault.) He killed us ALL,<br/>
and we were level 15, 17, and 19 at the time!<br/>
<br/>
Clerics shouldn&#39;t even consider soloing Jonah until at LEAST level 17 or<br/>
18. Probably higher, depending on your stats. Jonah is a necromancer&#39;s<br/>
dream come true, NOT a cleric&#39;s :) If you have a necro friend, I&#39;d<br/>
suggest taking them along and using their pet to help you kill that mad<br/>
monk. Jonah is great for xp until about level 18 or 19. Then it&#39;s off to<br/>
the Aviaks, eh?<br/>
<br/>
The point is: Flash of Light is a great spell for getting SOME mobs off<br/>
you. I say some, because some don&#39;t seem to be affected by it at all,<br/>
even when they don&#39;t resist it. I was never able to make an Aviak lose<br/>
sight of me (much to my horror), which got me killed once, when my Necro<br/>
friend went link dead and I had to finish off a RED Aviak who had taken<br/>
a keen interest in my blood :(<br/>
