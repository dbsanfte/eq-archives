Imagine you are walking down the street, a car hits you, you die, and <br/>
miraculously, a doctor is able to revive you and bring you back to life! Are <br/>
you going to have full health? No way! Are you going to be extremely weak? <br/>
You betcha!<br/>
<br/>
Granted, it was a REALLY nice thing to be able to be resurrected and have <br/>
your full mana and HP on your character, and being ready to go after you <br/>
loot, but if EQ is about Roleplaying, and about trying to be semi-realistic <br/>
in some cases, ressurect was not broken in the last patch, but instead, it <br/>
was made to be a little more beleiveable/realistic.<br/>

I just did a revive on myself yesterday and was damn surprised to the <br/>
result. Usually<br/>
all it does is teleport to corpse and return a little xp. But at that time <br/>
it did a whole<br/>
lot more. And all of them were negative side effects. After resurrection i <br/>
had all my<br/>
mana drained, had only 50% of HP, had some kind of weakness effect on me and<br/>
all this without any addition to the positive effects (xp gain). I feel this <br/>
is a terribly<br/>
wrong move by Verant. And besides they did not mention a thing about it in <br/>
the<br/>
patch message. Why the heck did they do something like this? Do they want to<br/>
ruin the cleric now that it is perfectly balanced? That would be awfully <br/>
stupid.<br/>
