<div id="ygrps-yiv-239268159">Let&#39;s do the sit-in on the test server.  Only about 400 people on<br/>
there at peak times.  Of course, it&#39;s questionable as to whether we<br/>
could get any GMs or guides there.  Since there are usually none.<br/>
Unless we made them aware of it somehow.<br/>

&gt;Read this and reconsider the sit-in!<br/>

&gt;I have a very old friend who contributes to the Guide program. Naturally, I<br/>
&gt;can&#39;t say who, but in the interest of preventing a similar fiasco as with<br/>
&gt;the Monk sit-in, I will confirm that players in Fenin&#39;s Fear Plane were<br/>
&gt;lagged out due to over-loading network resources on the server which houses<br/>
&gt;both Fear and West Freeport.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The server didn&#39;t crash, the network resources were overloaded, and so<br/>
&gt;people lagged out, leaving the Fear Plane with a half-linkdead party, which<br/>
&gt;died, followed by people reconnecting into Fear as a now very lonely, and<br/>
&gt;shortly after very dead, person.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Fear plane did not crash itself - that would have made the players safe -<br/>
&gt;because Fear does not populate for some time after a reboot. Instead, the<br/>
&gt;overload of players on the server caused the tragic and needless deaths of<br/>
&gt;people who just wanted to enjoy the game, and made their corpse recovery<br/>
&gt;even harsher.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Clerics and Necromancers, I urge you - find a better way to protest. You <br/>
&gt;are<br/>
&gt;going down a path which will, again, bring needless suffering on those who<br/>
&gt;are not participating. Non-violent protest is admirable, but if it causes<br/>
&gt;death, its no longer non-violent, is it?<br/>
&gt;-----<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I believe a sit-in, now that it is known that it causes problems to other<br/>
&gt;players, is not a good way to protest. Please invent another form of<br/>
&gt;peaceful protest, for the sake of others!<br/>
