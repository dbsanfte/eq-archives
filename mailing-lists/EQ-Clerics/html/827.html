<div id="ygrps-yiv-184685534">I think what would be better if it could be done is have the gate setup to<br/>
where you HAVE to be a certin Lvl to get in, say you should be lvl 35 to get<br/>
in if you&#39;re not at least Lvl 35 the gate kicks you back out.  Plus if this<br/>
Plane of Fear is suppose to be so hard then why not have the zone before it<br/>
harder so these low lvl players can&#39;t even get close to it?<br/>

&gt; And if the gate damage had been in the game from day one, would there be<br/>
&gt; complaints?  I say far less...<br/>
&gt; Should all of Norrath be available to every player from the get go?  I say<br/>
&gt; no...<br/>

&gt; Brad stated the Plane of Fear was supposed to be hard, in the context of<br/>
&gt; hard for very high level characters.<br/>
