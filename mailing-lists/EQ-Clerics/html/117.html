<br/>
I hate to admit this but im having trouble finding groups to play with... It<br/>
seems that everyone wants a lvl 14 or so cleric cos they can heal more, and<br/>
admittedly i have problems keeping up with the damage that creatures a few<br/>
lvls higher than me can dish out (being only able to heal 30 a pop).  so i<br/>
was wondering if anyone knows of a good hunting place i could check out at<br/>
lvl 12 and 13 (one bar left till 13 woo).<br/>
<br/>
thanks<br/>
