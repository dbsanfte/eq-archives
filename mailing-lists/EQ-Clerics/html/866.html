<div id="ygrps-yiv-1760590287">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m in a guild that encourages weekly fights in pvp areas in order to<br/>
increase prestige and guild rank. I&#39;m currently a level 15 cleric, and<br/>
have been challenged by a level 14 troll shaman (yipes). Any hints,<br/>
tips, or fighting strategies would be most helpful. I am skilled in both<br/>
one handed and two handed blunt, and have a runed totem staff, a fine<br/>
steel morning star, and a Qeynos shield (ac 10). My dark elf cleric also<br/>
has 90 str, 73 sta, 99 agi, 88 dex, and 98 wis. If I can get to level 19<br/>
before sunday night (gonna have to camp Jonah Brucker all weekend with<br/>
my necro friend!), I can buy Extinguish fatigue, endure magic, daring,<br/>
holy might (not sure what the stats are on it, but it sounds promising),<br/>
extinguish fatigue, and spirit armor.<br/>
<br/>
This is my second character, and I made sure (this time!) to get skill<br/>
in Divinate...so I can possibly blind the shaman at the start. I could<br/>
try fearing him, too, but don&#39;t know if that will work in the small pvp<br/>
area in neriak. Hmm. I also have cancel magic, but you know how those<br/>
shamans can cast and cast and cast....and i&#39;d hate to waste my mana. If<br/>
i buff with all the endure spells before hand, will I be all right<br/>
against his debuffing spells? I will also be wearing Crush&#39;s tunic,<br/>
which gives +8 resistance to heat, poison, magic, and cold. And I will<br/>
have some bronze, too, so my ac shouldn&#39;t be too low. However, i know<br/>
that the shaman will be in full banded. And he will be wielding a<br/>
bloodforge hammer, which he says hits for 25-26 consistently. With my<br/>
runed totem staff, i hit for 19. With the morning star, i hit for 16.<br/>
However, with his buffs, he will be extremely difficult to hit! And my<br/>
stamina will not last long at all, especially after he hits me with his<br/>
level 14 spell that sucks str, sta, and ac. Sighhhh....What&#39;s a poor<br/>
cleric to do?<br/>
<br/>
Please help!<br/>
