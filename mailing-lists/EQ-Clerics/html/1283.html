<div id="ygrps-yiv-1198529435">&lt;Ok,  Mika, you bring this up.....then we have another case to bring up:<br/>
Remember when Plane of Fear opened?  All the higher lvls complained because<br/>
lower levels in guilds were being brought in to get items they could NEVER<br/>
touch on their own.  So what does Verant do to combat this?  (Next to<br/>
tweaking it into the nastiest of places.....)  they put a LEVEL CAP on it.<br/>
Have I yet heard a higher lvl complain an area has a lvl cap?<br/>
Nope....because they can go into it.  That&#39;s discriminating against us<br/>
lowers who may just wanna try to enter into the zone. (See: Ogre warriors<br/>
rushing into PoF at lvl 1)&gt;<br/>
<br/>
First off, I think you have your facts a bit wrong. The main complaint from<br/>
the higher levels in Fear Plane (at least on The Rathe where I play) was<br/>
that players were creating newbie characters simply to come in to either a)<br/>
just check out the new zone and see what it was all about or b) to<br/>
intentionally create trains on the players who were in there.  In the case<br/>
of a), even if they were coming in to just check it out, they inevitably<br/>
wound up with a ton of critters on them that they trained on the groups that<br/>
were hunting there, getting everyone killed. Whenever we and other groups<br/>
would see a newbie player in Fear, we immediately all petitioned the GMs and<br/>
they came and threw them out.  Why? Because they had no business in an area<br/>
that was 45+ levels above their head when their presence was doing nothing<br/>
but causing the deaths of lots of other players.  Had they been able to come<br/>
into Fear and look around and cause only THEIR deaths, that would have been<br/>
different.  But the way Fear is set up, that simply was not possible.  I<br/>
don&#39;t consider banning these peeps from Fear discrimination, when these<br/>
players can&#39;t hunt there, can&#39;t get exp or items, and all their presence<br/>
does is cause the deaths of many other players who CAN hunt there and have a<br/>
lot to lose from death.<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, as far as lower level players in guilds getting the high level<br/>
items, almost every piece of armor and all the weapons in Fear were NO DROP<br/>
and CLASS specific.  Which meant if there were no druids (I&quot;m using druids<br/>
as only one example) in the groups, and one of the critters dropped a druid<br/>
only item, it simply had to go &quot;poof&quot; and disappear.  I hunted in Fear<br/>
almost every single day since it opened until they tweaked it and made it<br/>
impossible to go there anymore.  There was no way you could go in there<br/>
without a minimum of 3 full higher level groups in your party.  There were<br/>
three primary guilds on my server (the larger ones with higest level<br/>
players) that went into Fear, each with full groups of 6 high level players<br/>
(almost always +40).  Each of the guilds established a camp spot and we all<br/>
knew where the other guilds were hunting in case we got in trouble.  If one<br/>
of these items dropped, and we didn&#39;t have one of those classes with us, or<br/>
we did and that person already had the item, we would shout for one of the<br/>
other guilds to come over and loot so that item wasn&#39;t lost.  And from<br/>
actual experience (NOT hearsay or rumor), I never saw any lower levels<br/>
hunting in Fear when I was there  (by lower levels, I mean any under like<br/>
level 35 when considering the level of the mobs in there).  They simply did<br/>
not have the skills or abilities the groups needed to survive and would only<br/>
cause the death of the entire party.  My guild is possibly the largest on<br/>
the Rathe, and we didn&#39;t bring any of our lower level players into Fear.<br/>
What we did was to hand down our existing things to the lower levels once we<br/>
got a piece of better Fear equipment.<br/>
<br/>
Thirdly, you are totally wrong about the higher levels NOT complaining when<br/>
they put a level cap on Fear.  On the cleric list I moderate, we kicked this<br/>
around a lot, and all the higher levels agreed that IF they were to put a<br/>
level cap on Fear, it should not be set at 46, as Verant did.  We agreed<br/>
possibly that level 40 would be more appropriate IF Verant insisted on a<br/>
level cap, which the majority of us higher levels did NOT agree with nor<br/>
want.  We even discussed putting together another petition to Verant<br/>
concerning the changes they made to Fear, including the level cap.  Over a<br/>
month ago, when Fear opened, there were hardly enough level 46+ players to<br/>
put together a full party of three or four full groups to go into Fear and<br/>
hunt, much less multiple parties.  And even one full party of say 3 or 4<br/>
groups in the zone still wasn&#39;t safe.  You needed two or three full parties<br/>
in different areas of the zone just to be relatively safe.  So you are dead<br/>
wrong about the high level players not complaining about the 46+ level cap<br/>
on Fear.  We did NOT like it and many many of us, including myself, sent<br/>
feedback to Verant concerning this requesting that they remove the cap, or<br/>
in the alternative, lower it.<br/>
<br/>
And once again, I&quot;m sure we ALL could relate many personal situations when<br/>
higher level jerks have come into a camped area and stolen every kill.  I<br/>
think this is dead wrong, but again, I still do not feel Brad&#39;s way of<br/>
addressing this problem is correct or fair.  Come up with a different<br/>
solution that is more fair to all who play, regardless of level.  Don&#39;t<br/>
throw the baby out with the dirty bath water.<br/>
