<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1176439485">I know, I know, Rodcet Nife isn&#39;t as crowded as<br/>
many of the other servers, but it can still be<br/>
crowded.  I suggest searching for new areas.  I<br/>
have found a zone that has never had more than 25<br/>
people in it since I have been there.  Exp. is<br/>
great and I am making about 60pp a day in loot.<br/>
Did I mention that I now have full bronze from<br/>
this same zone?  I am not a level 49 player<br/>
either.  I made 18 last night and I already have<br/>
two bubbles of exp. toward 19.  I have all the lvl<br/>
19 spells bought, an incredible amount of jewelry,<br/>
and over 500pp in the bank.  Once again I implore<br/>
you to travel and to form 6 member groups.  If you<br/>
hear about a great place then every one else has<br/>
also.  Find your own area.  There are many that<br/>
are hardly ever visited and you&#39;ll have your<br/>
cloice on what, when, and where to kill.<br/>
