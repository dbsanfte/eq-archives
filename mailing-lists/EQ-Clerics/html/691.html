<b>Subject:</b> Verant ruined the revive line of spells <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-321451289">I just did a revive on myself yesterday and was damn surprised to the result. Usually<br/>
all it does is teleport to corpse and return a little xp. But at that time it did a whole<br/>
lot more. And all of them were negative side effects. After resurrection i had all my<br/>
mana drained, had only 50% of HP, had some kind of weakness effect on me and<br/>
all this without any addition to the positive effects (xp gain). I feel this is a terribly<br/>
wrong move by Verant. And besides they did not mention a thing about it in the<br/>
patch message. Why the heck did they do something like this? Do they want to<br/>
ruin the cleric now that it is perfectly balanced? That would be awfully stupid.<br/>
