<div id="ygrps-yiv-2006825603">Thanks for the pics.  I happened to be hunting myself last night in Nagafens<br/>
lair, near one of the exits to Sol Eye, killing greater and solusek<br/>
kobolds....there was about 30 players there ranging from lvl 40 to 50 who<br/>
were attempting to take Nagafen, but in the end to no avail. they had all<br/>
about died once to the fire giants, all were resed and made an attempt at<br/>
Nagafen, they got the dragon to about 1/4 health.  they were all speaking in<br/>
/auction mode due to their numbers, so even though i wasn&#39;t there to see it<br/>
all, it was quite interesting to listen as their battles ensued.<br/>
** Note to self: Make sure you have more magic resist than god when going to<br/>
attempt to take Nagafen.<br/>
that was one mistake they had made, they all had really high heat resists,<br/>
which was good, but they didn&#39;t have any magic resist so the AE fear spell<br/>
got the best of most of them.<br/>
