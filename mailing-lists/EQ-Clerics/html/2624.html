<div id="ygrps-yiv-1594507729">Regarding playing a level 50 cleric:<br/>
<br/>
Symbol buffs:<br/>
Pinzam gem is a jasper (cost about 8gp or so depending on faction)<br/>
Naltron gem is a peridot (cost about 11pp or so depending on faction)<br/>
<br/>
Tanks NEED the extra HP&#39;s that Naltron brings for dragon runs, etc.  If you<br/>
cannot afford the gems, have them give you pp for them or bring some in<br/>
advance.  (I Naltron everyone for dragons, but that is just me)<br/>
<br/>
Regarding Reso and AOF:<br/>
In extreme combat situation I will Shield of Words all the tanks<br/>
(+AC/+defense) and AOF the casters.  If a 49+ druid is around and they don&#39;t<br/>
mind, they can cast Skin Like Nature (SLN) on tanks (does not stack with<br/>
reso and reso and SLN will not over-write each other)  You will still need<br/>
to cast your AC buff (SoW or AOF).  Druids can also help to cast the Endure<br/>
cold/fire buffs.<br/>
<br/>
Regarding Complete Heal:<br/>
I don&#39;t use in dragon situations.  Occasionally I use on the planes, dungeon<br/>
hunts and fire giant type runs, but ONLY on tanks with HP&#39;s over 2500 or so.<br/>
Mana cost for C-Heal is 400 (versus 250 for Superior heal) and can save you<br/>
a bit of mana on high health point tank types.  If you do use it, it is best<br/>
if you start to cast when HP&#39;s drop to 2 bubbles.  You will get a feel for<br/>
when you will have time to do this and when a superior heal is needed for<br/>
the lower casting time.<br/>
