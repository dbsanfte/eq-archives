Oil, the prayer beads and turning in skele bone chips does work.  The one<br/>
where you get a moonstone works.....<br/>
<br/>
PELTS....doesnt.  It (unless they changed it last patch) was &quot;fixed&quot;  Not<br/>
even the fleshy orb gave anything.....I tried this for over 10 hours....and<br/>
learned the factions for temple of life ;)  the prayer beads quest is a VERy<br/>
nice faction upper btw.  but long.<br/>

Our guildmaster, who is a paladin, just recently needed to raise his faction<br/>
<br/>
with the priests of Life, in order to obtain his soulfire sword.<br/>
Basically what we did to help raise his faction was:<br/>
1) killing putrid skellies in South Karana(at Grimrots Camp)<br/>
2) Turning in diseased animal pelts to the Temple of Life<br/>
3) Doing the Blessed oil Quest til he turned green<br/>
<br/>
These will all raise your faction there. Even I, a person who originally <br/>
came from the temple of Life, needed to raise my faction in order to do the <br/>
quest. But to be quite honest, I did the quest simply cause I had never done<br/>
<br/>
a quest before, I tried the weapon out like once to see what the effect was <br/>
and it has sat in the bank ever since.<br/>

&gt;I keep reading that everyone on here loves to use there SSOL.  I would like<br/>
<br/>
&gt;to get this weapon as well.  I am a human cleric from the Temple of Marr in<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Freeport.  Will i have problems trying to do the quest, or will i be ok?  <br/>
&gt;Just want to make sure, before I make that loooong journy from freeport to <br/>
&gt;qeynos.  Thanks<br/>
