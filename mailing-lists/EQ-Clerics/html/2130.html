<div id="ygrps-yiv-247217714">Oassis can provide GREAT xp at your level...it sometimes gets crowded and you need a group (you don&#39;t want to solo the gators at 14), but it is very good xp.   As you get up towards levels 18, 19, 20... another great place to go get in a group is the Aviak city in South Karana.   Talk about crowded... it makes Oasis look empty, but it is really good xp... I got about 5 or 6 levels in a row there.. by the time i got to level 22 or 23 I was so sick of the crowds I couldn&#39;t stay any longer.<br/>
If you can get in a good group though, the xp can be very good in both places.  <br/>

&gt; other than in Nro where i am now?<br/>
