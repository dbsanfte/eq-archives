<div id="ygrps-yiv-1508449305"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; however, I have tried this: When<br/>
&gt; fighting one<br/>
&gt; creature, you could potentially cast a heal, atone the creature, cast a<br/>
&gt; heal, atone the creature therefore wiping it&#39;s memory, any ever<br/>
&gt; tried this?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, I did this last nite...it seems to work.  I wasn&#39;t sure if I was being<br/>
silly and going overboard, and I wasn&#39;t sure if it was the atone or the<br/>
amnesiac spells the enchanters were casting that was being so effective. =/<br/>
However, I only died once last nite...I thought that was an approvement over<br/>
5 death from the night before.</div>
