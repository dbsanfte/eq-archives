<div id="ygrps-yiv-326476112">Congratulations, Curtis.. Your personal life will start suffering very<br/>
soon from this highly addictive game.<br/>
<br/>
After you play eq a while, you will see that each race has very strong<br/>
points, and all develop very powerful, the key I have found, is pick a<br/>
race you like.. Dont worry about your progression, you will BE powerful<br/>
if you hit higher levels, its all a matter of it fitting your playstyle.<br/>
Wisdom=Life for a cleric, its where we get our mana, at lower levels we<br/>
will be able to stand in the front lines with the warriors and dish it<br/>
out, but later, we just cant take the beating, while we do MUCH better<br/>
than the Fragile mage classes (Wizard, Magician, etc) even WE cant take<br/>
the massive ammounts of damage those monsters dish out. So, our role is<br/>
a medic, to preform, you need high wisdom. I personally chose a Erudite<br/>
because I dont plan to be doing much fighting (low strength/stamina) but<br/>
super high Intel(Rate at which I learn skills) and wisdom... And,<br/>
because I think they look the coolest all decked out. :) (Just me)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Enjoy the game Curtis<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hi, I just bought EQ (my friends talked me into it)<br/>
&gt; and they wanted me to play a Cleric - which fortunately<br/>
&gt; is what I always play anyway because I like them.  I read<br/>
&gt; through some of the archives here, and I have a few <br/>
&gt; questions:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What is the best race for the cleric?  I made a high-elf.<br/>
&gt; Are they good?  It seemed to have the highest wisdom.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It looks like strength is really important?  What is a <br/>
&gt; good minimum strength.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; thanks for the help.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
