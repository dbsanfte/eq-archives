<div id="ygrps-yiv-929608020">Heh. It does force us procrastinators to do the quest. I had been carrying<br/>
around 3 of the 4 Sisters dull pearl necklaces for, oh, the last 15 levels<br/>
or so, and suddenly found that when I took them out of my bank account I<br/>
couldn&#39;t get them back in again... Ack.  So, I got the remaining necklace,<br/>
did the quest -- it doesn&#39;t get any better &lt;groan&gt; -- and that was that.<br/>

&gt;More and more quest items are increasingly becoming NODROP.  I have<br/>
&gt;5 dwarven tongues (the bandit tongues, and Rondo&#39;s tongue from CB) and<br/>
&gt;I had them all in the bank, each taking up 5 slots.  I decided I would<br/>
&gt;buy a box, put them in the box, and then put them back.  Much to my<br/>
&gt;dismay, when I put the box in the bank, it said I couldn&#39;t because<br/>
&gt;every tongue was now NODROP.  I wish they would fix that.  No I am<br/>
&gt;forced to carry around these damned tongues everywhere. </span></blockquote></div>
