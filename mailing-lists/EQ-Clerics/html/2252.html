<div id="ygrps-yiv-1865182030">Someone asked to keep the posts coming, so here goes.  :)  slow day at<br/>
work for me, too.<br/>
<br/>
There are a couple of quests that have always intrigued me that appear<br/>
to be broken.  One is the Jojongua pelt quest in Felwithe.<br/>
Technically, I guess, this is a Paladin quest, but the Paladin that<br/>
initiates it, asks if you will help the &quot;clerics of tunare&quot; so it<br/>
kind of overlaps.<br/>
From what I have heard, Jojongua, the named Kobold in Innothule Swamp,<br/>
is a rare spawn, and those that have killed him, have never ever<br/>
looted a pelt off his cold, dead body.  Also from what I have heard,<br/>
the corpse remains, even though there is no loot, and doesn&#39;t go away<br/>
after looting.  Anyone have any information on this quest?<br/>
<br/>
There other quest is apparently a Surefall Glade quest.  I say<br/>
&#39;apparently&#39;, because I&#39;ve never found any reference to the quest, but<br/>
the result is &#39;bands of tunare&#39;, a +1 wisdom armband that is supposed<br/>
to be given for this quest.  I found that item listed on EQitems, and<br/>
it just says &quot;surefal glade quest&quot; as the source, but nothing else<br/>
even references this quest.  Anyone know how to get those armbands?  I<br/>
don&#39;t need them now, but would liked to have had them back a few<br/>
levels.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
