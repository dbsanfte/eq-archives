<b>Subject:</b> PvP strategies for clerics <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1932933086">I have a few thoughts on PvP and clerics. I play a cleric on Vallon Zek and <br/>
occationally battle other players. In my experience, clerics are not good <br/>
offensively, but rather good defensively, especially grouped.<br/>
Once a necromancer cast dots on me (engulfing darkness and boil blood I <br/>
believe), plus fear. I dropped HPs rapidly, but managed to cast a couple of <br/>
heals on myself, and then the DOTs wore off.<br/>
<br/>
Can clerics generally survive a fight versus casters by healing themselves? <br/>
If I cast 4 greater heals on myself I can heal for 1200+ damage. Although I <br/>
am not sure, I doubt a wizard will have the mana to deliver 2000 damage at <br/>
my level (24), and some of his damage might be resisted. Assuming I have <br/>
full armour, I should be able to root and melee the caster to death.<br/>
<br/>
Other useful spells are blindness and stun. I use the low level variants of <br/>
stun since they take less mana. Divine aura is useful since the attacker <br/>
doesn&#39;t always observe that I am invulnerable, especially casters, since <br/>
they don&#39;t get any damage information (=&quot;blabla hit by non melee for 140 <br/>
damage&quot; etc).<br/>
<br/>
Buying an egg shaped pumice is also a good investment, although it is quite <br/>
expensive. It is a magic item sold by some vendors (in Neriak, the one near <br/>
the bank) and has 5 charges of &quot;pillage enchantment&quot;, that will cancel <br/>
several effects like charm/DOTs (and buffs) at the same time.</div>
