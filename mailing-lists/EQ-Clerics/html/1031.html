<div id="ygrps-yiv-1833448615">Maxes should be:<br/>
<br/>
Casting: (level + 1) * 5<br/>
Offense & defense: level * 5<br/>
1H and 2H blunt: (level + 1) * 4<br/>
Dodge: caps at 75, I believe is level * 5<br/>
Swimming: (level + 1) * 5<br/>
<br/>
Forgot about dodge, mine capped so long ago since I&#39;m level 29 now.<br/>

Subject: [EQ-Clerics] skills and points<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; From: &quot;Curtis Bennett&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:die_kluge@...">die_kluge@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have a 13th level cleric.  I just made 13th Sunday, in fact, and as<br/>
&gt; with last few level increases, it&#39;s become a habit of mine to spend a<br/>
&gt; little time to max all my skills with each level increase.  I&#39;ve been<br/>
&gt; keeping them all written down, and when a skill increases, I write the<br/>
&gt; new number down, marking out the previous one.  I know what each of my<br/>
&gt; skill levels are (except for beg, which I haven&#39;t used since 5th lvl).<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve heard that, for clerics, magic skills raise 5 points per level,<br/>
&gt; and combat skills raise 4.  This seems to be at least somewhat<br/>
&gt; accurate.<br/>
&gt; At 12th, my skills were maxed (for the most part).  I had maxed<br/>
&gt; alteration (heal school) at 65, and defense and offense at 60.  So,<br/>
&gt; when I went to 13th, my skills all started raising.  So I spent some<br/>
&gt; time just casting, swimming, sense-headng, etc, to raise them all to<br/>
&gt; 70.  I assume that defense, and offense will now to go 64.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But I have two question, are there initial points?  Because 70 (my max<br/>
&gt; score for my magic skills) / 13 (my level) is not 5.  5*13 is 65.  So<br/>
&gt; is it that at first level you have 10 points, and then it&#39;s 5 every<br/>
&gt; level after that?  And what about the combat skills?  4*13 is 52.  So<br/>
&gt; could it be that, since the max for these skills, at this level is 64<br/>
&gt; that I start with 12 points in these areas?  Or, at least, a max of 12<br/>
&gt; potential points at level 1?  The numbers aren&#39;t adding up.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also, If my magic skills continue at the same rate, and my assumption<br/>
&gt; is that 200 is the max for a skill, I will max my magic skills at<br/>
&gt; around level 39 or so.  What then?  Is this where the specialization<br/>
&gt; skills come in?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also, one other question while I have your attention, I went to a<br/>
&gt; language fair recently and picked up a few additional languages.  Is<br/>
&gt; there a way to increase those skills without going to another language<br/>
&gt; fair and without pumping training points into them?<br/>
