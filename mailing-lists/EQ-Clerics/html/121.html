I play a high elf Cleric lvl 15 now  on The Rathe and have a few <br/>
suggestions for you. First in Butcherblock there is the chessboard <br/>
with 5 spawns of undead pawns, bishops, rooks and the king. Spawns <br/>
above pawns are random and some have spells and pets so be careful <br/>
until you learn what is there. Second also in Butcherblock is the Orc <br/>
Oracles. Orc centurions and oracles spawn here. There are 3 spawn <br/>
points here. Third is the bandit camps in Lesser Faydark. I don&#39;t <br/>
like the one with the Nybright sisters because everyone goes there. <br/>
There is a lesser known camp with 3 bandit spawn points. These <br/>
bandits spawn bronze weapons sometimes so you can make some money <br/>
here. The orcs have rawhide leather and some run of the mill weapons <br/>
and armor. The chessboard is mostly bone chips but sometimes rusty <br/>
weapons. At your lvl I would suggest bringing a friend along till you <br/>
get used to these places or offer your services there. Hope this <br/>
helps. <br/>
