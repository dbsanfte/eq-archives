<div id="ygrps-yiv-1799664987">Well what you heard was actually half right the effects of getting<br/>
drunk are warrior benificial only since they do not need Intelligence or<br/>
wisdom they drink as much as they want and can even get drunk and go out and<br/>
fight even better than when sober becuase it raises their str and stamina<br/>
which are pretty important to a warrior so warriors are actually the only<br/>
ppl that will benifit from drinking in this gamwe:)<br/>

&gt;At a wedding I attended recently, there was much celebration. To put it<br/>
&gt;bluntly, I got hammered. :) I managed to get my alcohol tolerance from 0 to<br/>
&gt;60. I noticed that my STR and STA went up a little bit. I had previously<br/>
&gt;heard that this was a warrior only effect, but now I know otherwise.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In the last couple of days I worked on tolerance a bit more and maxed it<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;On the other hand, I am beginning to find that when I&#39;m in a decent sized<br/>
&gt;party and we&#39;re hunting tough mobs, I stay out of danger so I can stick to<br/>
&gt;healing. I had always assumed that this would be the case, especially at<br/>
&gt;higher levels.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
