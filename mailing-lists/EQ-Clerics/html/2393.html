&gt; I find the endure line mostly useless, though they have certain times they are nice and the same for Cancel Magic.. .only used it a few times in my life as a cleric so far (level 30).<br/>

very useful.. I rarely go anywhere without at least endure magic up..<br/>
endure Fire is very useful in Lavastorm.. endure cold in permafrost.. <br/>
and poison/disease in befallen/unrest.. they each have their uses and it<br/>
cuts down on your healing quite a bit..  <br/>
<br/>
As for cancel magic.. try using it as a debuff.. drop a MOB&#39;s fire<br/>
shield, brambles, cleric/shaman buffs..  I actually find that some mobs<br/>
will immediately try to rebuff when you debuff them instead of<br/>
attacking.. this can be a useful tactic..<br/>
