<div id="ygrps-yiv-704852689">I never thought to use divine first in a duel, i think i may have to give<br/>
that a shot when dueling some time....I have also used Fear on my opponent,<br/>
it sends them off flying and gives a bit of time for you to heal if<br/>
necessary before they come running back to you....But flash of light and<br/>
root are a necessity in dueling<br/>

&gt;I have had a few experiences dueling, due mainly to the fact that I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;abide with kill thieves.  All three times I came out on top because I was<br/>
&gt;prepared.  I sat down and memorized flash of light and root along with my<br/>
&gt;regular arsenal of spells.  Those two spells can turn the tide on any fight<br/>
&gt;up to 3 levels above you.  First you blind them, that way they have no Idea<br/>
&gt;where you are.  Then you root them, walk around behind them and beat on<br/>

&gt;simple.  I challenged him and as soon as he accepted I cast divine aura on<br/>
&gt;myself.  He mana hosed himself in the first 25 second and I had free reign<br/>
&gt;to beat him soundly about the head and shoulders.  Just my experiences in<br/>
&gt;dueling.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Well personally, I have been in one duel myself (against a fellow guild<br/>
&gt;&gt; member), and I actually won (WOO HOO).  Anyways, he was about 2 or 3<br/>
&gt;&gt; levels ahead of me, and a magician.  My advice against spell casters<br/>
&gt;&gt; would be just to fight as normal against them, and try to disrupt their<br/>
&gt;&gt; spelling, and after they bombard you with their spells and drain their<br/>
&gt;&gt; mana, heal yourself.  This would make their magic casting in vain, and<br/>
&gt;&gt; give you the advantage.  If you have plenty of magic left, smite them,<br/>
&gt;&gt; or use any other powerful magic against them to drop their health down,<br/>
&gt;&gt; and simply melee them until their dead or unconscious (anyway you<br/>
&gt;&gt; prefer).<br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt; Hail fellow Clerics,<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;   I have witnessed and read about many adventurers dueling to<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; test their skills or to settle a dispute.  However, I have<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; never seen a Cleric duel nor have heard of one.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;   Since we are in charge of Saving lives, how do we tune<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; ourselves to Take a life? Clerics are far from being cowards,<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; but to decline a duel or be somewhat at a loss durring a<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; potential guild war, can bring shame upon the class.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;   So I ask, are there any dueling clerics out there that can<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; lend their experiences to a beginning duelest?  I am a level<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; 19 cleric but I wish to open the discussion to all levels.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Tips for fighting hybrids, magic using classes, and especially<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; adventureres that are of lvls higher than yourself.<br/>
