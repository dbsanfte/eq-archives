<div id="ygrps-yiv-986482198">Sorry, can&#39;t agree with you on the stun issue either.  Doesn&#39;t make ANY<br/>
sense to me, much less total as it does to you. If you have been given the<br/>
ability by the gods to put a &quot;divine&quot; shield around yourself and make<br/>
yourself invulnerable from being hit, then you shouldn&#39;t be able to be<br/>
stunned because the critter MUST hit you to stun you.  Quite simply, you<br/>
can&#39;t get stunned if you can&#39;t get hit.  Now, if they would&#39;ve said Divine<br/>
Aura is strictly a spell to prevent you from taking any DAMAGE from a hit<br/>
but not to prevent you from BEING hit, then that is different.<br/>
<br/>
 But in my opinion, if we have the ability to cloak ourselves from damage,<br/>
it should include ALL damage, including stuns.  Because stun to me IS a form<br/>
of damage even though it does not reduce your hps.  It renders you incapable<br/>
of moving, which to me, is STILL a type of damage. Just like the blinding<br/>
light spell.....its effects, aka damage, aren&#39;t reflected in loss of hps but<br/>
it DOES damage to you by rendering you incapable of seeing.<br/>
