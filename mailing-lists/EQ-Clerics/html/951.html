&gt; Has anyone tried healing or buffing a NPC or a MOB. I play a Cleric on<br/>
&gt; Rallos Zek (PvP) and my main rationale is I like to heal. I play a &quot;good&quot;<br/>
&gt; cleric and have healed bad/good races. My main irritation is when I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; suddenly PK&#39;d by a member of my own race. (High Elf. I hang my head in shame<br/>
&gt; at my fallen brothers and sisters)<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Anyway normally there is a +/- 4 range for PvP correct? It seems to me that<br/>
&gt; the Cleric is uniquely positioned so that we can severely inconvenience<br/>
&gt; other players far below our level. If they are fighting a MOB can we heal<br/>
&gt; the MOB? Can we buff it? I must admit I have never tried it, I just thought<br/>
&gt; of it. Has anyone any experience of this??<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
