<b>Subject:</b> Re: Make unique Items part of a quest <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-185479055">Yea, it is a weird element to the game.  Another truly bizzarre thing<br/>
is how the economy makes no sense at all.  You&#39;ve got merchants who<br/>
willingly buy things that have no market value, ie, fish scales.  And<br/>
will gladly give you money for them.  I mean, let&#39;s say I&#39;ve got 100<br/>
fish scales in my inventory and walk up to a merchant, he&#39;ll buy them<br/>
off me with a smile.  What&#39;s he gonna do with all those fish scales?<br/>
Is there some sort of underground trade in fish scales that I&#39;m not<br/>
aware of?  I don&#39;t know how these merchants are making any money.<br/>
  And those guards.  I tell you where they need to be - out patrolling<br/>
roads killing hill giants so that people can travel between Qeynos and<br/>
Freeport, for example.  Travel is just downright treacherous and seems<br/>
to discourage adventuring.  crazy.<br/>
  I love the game, don&#39;t get me wrong, but it&#39;s just plain kooky.<br/>
They need to hire me is what they need to do. :)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;HEY! You&#39;re absolutely right. And I have an idea. First, improve EQ&#39;s<br/>
&gt;quest elements,  then make unique items like journeyman boots quest<br/>
&gt;items. VERY DIFFICULT items could be part of a VERY DIFFICULT quest, but<br/>
&gt;that&#39;s ok, cause there would be no camping, no kill stealing, and you<br/>
&gt;would be doing a lot more exploring and getting experience while doing<br/>
&gt;it. And, I think, you&#39;d be having a lot more fun using your brain than<br/>
&gt;using the /gesture command (after that 35th level wizard just stole your<br/>
&gt;kill for the 3rd time in the same day). What do you think? I mean, isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;that why they call it EVERquest?<br/>
