&gt; Can I be hypothetical here for a second?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Imagine you are walking down the street, a car hits you, you die, and <br/>
&gt; miraculously, a doctor is able to revive you and bring you back to life!<br/>
Are <br/>
&gt; you going to have full health? No way! Are you going to be extremely weak?<br/>
<br/>
&gt; You betcha!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Granted, it was a REALLY nice thing to be able to be resurrected and have <br/>
&gt; your full mana and HP on your character, and being ready to go after you <br/>
&gt; loot, but if EQ is about Roleplaying, and about trying to be<br/>
semi-realistic <br/>
&gt; in some cases, ressurect was not broken in the last patch, but instead, it<br/>
