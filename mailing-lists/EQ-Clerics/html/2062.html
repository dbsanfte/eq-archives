&gt;Subject: High Keep & High Pass<br/>
<br/>
&gt;I was wondering, lately in both HP & HK when I go to a shop owner he/she<br/>
&gt;tells me things like &quot;You make me sick, now leave my shop&quot; and won&#39;t buy<br/>
&gt;from me or sell to me at all.  I use to be able to till about a few weeks<br/>
&gt;back, I&#39;ve been turning in Orc scalps and goblin ears for faction but as of<br/>
&gt;now I still get the &quot;I dislike you&quot; from the shop owners.  Anyone have any<br/>
&gt;ideas?  Only thing I remember killing the said made my faction worse with<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Within the meeting room, Carson McCabe was addressing a panel of men<br/>
&gt;assembled around a massive central table. Noting a number of adventurers<br/>
&gt;occupying the rooms public viewing area (including a rather ungainly Ogre!)<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ealan &gt;quietly entered and found a seat. As it turned out, McCabe had<br/>
received word of the &gt;horrible deeds afoot both in the Commonlands and the<br/>
Karanas and had posted a &gt;bounty for information leading to the death or<br/>
apprehension of those responsible. &gt;Ealan had been correct in assuming that<br/>
McCabe could not afford to ignore the &gt;wanton slaughter of those who<br/>
traveled the pass he was charged with defending. &gt;Unfortunately, though, it<br/>
seemed that information had surfaced which had shown the &gt;problem to be far<br/>
greater than overzealous bandits or isolated raiding parties of &gt;Trolls and<br/>
Teir`Dal; the Keep, it seemed, was preparing for war. All of the pieces<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;were coming together now, and it did not bode well. The rumors of the one,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Lanys, &gt;who claimed to be the Daughter of Innorruuk himself, the tales of<br/>
the Two Hearts and &gt;their removal from Castle Neriak, the disturbing vision<br/>
that he had experienced, the &gt;increasingly bold actions of the Teir`Dal<br/>
throughout Antonica and even Faydwer; all &gt;of these signs hinted at the<br/>
coming of a time of great strife. As Ealan listened intently, &gt;the picture<br/>
grew grimmer. McCabe had been denied assistance by both Antonius &gt;Bayle and<br/>
the Lords of Freeport. The Dwarves of Kaladim, predictably, had taken &gt;the<br/>
news as a sign to bolster their own defenses and official action from Erudin<br/>
was &gt;locked in deliberation with the High Council. The only allies Highkeep<br/>
could count &gt;on were the Elves.<br/>
<br/>
I remember hearing the DE cry something about Carson McCabe when I dropped<br/>
him.   I can still sell there, but I only took the faction hit once.<br/>
