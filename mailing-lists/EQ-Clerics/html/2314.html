<div id="ygrps-yiv-217629952">They are on the ancient Croc in upper guk.  His replacement spawn is<br/>
from one to 5 gators.  The necessary lvl escapes me but I&#39;d say its 34<br/>
solo (although a pure caster can probably do them at 30) to be safe.<br/>
The gators won&#39;t agro so you can kill one at a time.  You have to clear<br/>
them all out before the next spawn cycle will start.<br/>
<br/>
They weight only .4 so they do drop your overall weight significantly.<br/>
