<div id="ygrps-yiv-647182449">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
My RL friend who has a lvl 50 cleric is going to go on a 1 month vacation.<br/>
She has asked me to play her cleric for our guild when it&#39;s needed.  The<br/>
highest I&#39;ve ever gotten a cleric to is lvl 28.  Last night was the first<br/>
time I ever played a lvl 50 cleric and I have to admit it was like being<br/>
toss into the water without knowing how to swim.  We were doing a dragon run<br/>
of all things.  Anyway, the healing part I think I gotten down...I mainly<br/>
just cast superior heals...the time needed to cast a CH was just too nerve<br/>
racking for me.  I was told to cast panzia (sp?) symbol on caster and nalton<br/>
(sp?) on tanks (why that is so...I didn&#39;t bothered to ask...was a bit too<br/>
busy trying to figured out other stuff).  If there is a druid around then do<br/>
most clerics not cast Reso and AoF?  Most tanks were asking for SLN...were<br/>
they trying to split buff duty between druid/shaman/clerics?  Anyway, can<br/>
any lvl 49+ clerics out there give out advise on what you normally do in<br/>
highly stressful combat situation with multi groups going on.  Thanks a<br/>
bunch.<br/>
<br/>
I died like 5 times last nite...hope that wasn&#39;t too unusual.</div>
