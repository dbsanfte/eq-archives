<div id="ygrps-yiv-10207182">It&#39;s not the doing of the quest that&#39;s difficult, it&#39;s getting the faction.<br/>
And since probably 75% of clerics in Norrath are dwarves or high elves, they<br/>
have to work hard on that. I&#39;m a human cleric of Karana, started in Qeynos,<br/>
and even I was only indifferent to the Rodcet Nife followers to start with.<br/>
<br/>
AFAIK charges are not really used on anything apart from one-use items (e.g.<br/>
giant fire beetle eye)?<br/>
Clense seems to cure disease, it also cures poison (but only equivalent to<br/>
one shot of the cure poison spell, so usually will not cure you totally),<br/>
and I think, although I cannot confirm this, that it will cancel harmful<br/>
DoTs (e.g. engulfing darkness).<br/>

&gt; cleric and had <br/>
&gt; no troule doing said quest, in fact it was one of the easier <br/>
&gt; ones i have <br/>
&gt; done. </span></blockquote></div>
