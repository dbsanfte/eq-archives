I bet to differ about it being better than a Glowing Crook.  The peacekeeper<br/>
staff is damage 4 delay 30 if i know my stuff, and compared to the damage 11<br/>
and delay 35 of the crook, that is no contest.<br/>

Also i use a crook so its a biased opinion, but make your own opinion ;)<br/>

Apparently the second time you complete the quest, you get a better staff<br/>
than the first time. This is a rumor I heard off of a high level Erudite<br/>
Paladin. </span></blockquote></div>
