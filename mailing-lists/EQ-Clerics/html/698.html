<div id="ygrps-yiv-2087706607">Acutally from what I heard is that due to the clerics res&#39;s the folks that <br/>
killed both of the dragons.  This is what I HEARD as the story.<br/>
<br/>
Wiz A dies. Cleric B casts Res on Wiz A.  Wiz A sits down med 1 spell.<br/>
<br/>
Case 1 spell over and over again... Dies... Cleric B cast Res on Wiz A.  Wiz <br/>
A sits down and meds 1 spell.  repeat until dead.<br/>
<br/>
again that is what I hear.<br/>
<br/>
So yet again not only do the cleric&#39;s not get an update that helps us but <br/>
one that hurts us... why is it that the other classes can have updates that <br/>
a)make a spell less likly to be resisted b)speeds up casting time, c) lowers <br/>
mana cost d)raises damage or length of duration, and e)replaces or fixed bad <br/>
spells while we get a REDUCTION in damage and our spell that defines our <br/>
class gets Fubared?????<br/>
<br/>
ahhh well.<br/>

&gt;Can I be hypothetical here for a second?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Imagine you are walking down the street, a car hits you, you die, and<br/>
&gt;miraculously, a doctor is able to revive you and bring you back to life! <br/>
&gt;Are<br/>
&gt;you going to have full health? No way! Are you going to be extremely weak?<br/>
&gt;You betcha!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Granted, it was a REALLY nice thing to be able to be resurrected and have<br/>
&gt;your full mana and HP on your character, and being ready to go after you<br/>
&gt;loot, but if EQ is about Roleplaying, and about trying to be semi-realistic<br/>
&gt;in some cases, ressurect was not broken in the last patch, but instead, it<br/>
&gt;was made to be a little more beleiveable/realistic.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Let the flames begin, just be gentle &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&gt;I just did a revive on myself yesterday and was damn surprised to the<br/>
&gt;result. Usually<br/>
&gt;all it does is teleport to corpse and return a little xp. But at that time<br/>
&gt;it did a whole<br/>
&gt;lot more. And all of them were negative side effects. After resurrection i<br/>
&gt;had all my<br/>
&gt;mana drained, had only 50% of HP, had some kind of weakness effect on me <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;all this without any addition to the positive effects (xp gain). I feel <br/>
&gt;this<br/>
&gt;is a terribly<br/>
&gt;wrong move by Verant. And besides they did not mention a thing about it in<br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;patch message. Why the heck did they do something like this? Do they want <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;ruin the cleric now that it is perfectly balanced? That would be awfully<br/>
&gt;stupid.<br/>
