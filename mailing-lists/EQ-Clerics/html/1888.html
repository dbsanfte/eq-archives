<div id="ygrps-yiv-243630500">Well it might get worse at higher levels (I am only 28) but I only do<br/>
MED/HEAL when we have way too much action or a bad number of healers to<br/>
burners/bashers. As a general rule I melee at the start of a fight (as<br/>
long as I have lotsa mana) unless its a caster, then I am stun stun look<br/>
for heals stun stun. I also throw a nuke in if the burner is low and a<br/>
runner is taking off or stun and let the meleers do their business. BTW<br/>
stuns are very useful they halt a MOB that is running, doesn&#39;t cancel<br/>
chains or snares, interupts a caster and stops it damaging for a round<br/>
and with some of the things we have been fighting they can hit for 60 or<br/>
more a time and several attacks a round.<br/>
<br/>
It also helps to get in a group with an enchanter above 29 and a bard<br/>
above 32 ;p<br/>

&gt; Okay, I am now lvl 10 and really concerned about this.  From what EVERYONE<br/>
&gt; tells me (which I totally disagree with and the whole subject matter makes<br/>
&gt; me sick) is that when older (25+) all we do is heal...no melee, no DD, just<br/>
&gt; heal and med.  First...is that true or can we still melee..I know we won&#39;t<br/>
&gt; exactly be able to solo melee...but as in a group or possibly as the only<br/>
&gt; tank?..and while on that subject, can we solo undead up into all our higher<br/>
&gt; lvls or do we still need help then too?  And finally the mana issue.  I am<br/>
&gt; dwarven cleric and have a 100 in strength and 103 in wisdom...will that be a<br/>
&gt; high enough wisdom to have proper mana to heal my group and such?  Any other<br/>
&gt; tips would be most helpful.<br/>

&gt; P.S.  Any good cleric websites with detailed spell descriptions (like how<br/>
&gt; much damage our spells deal, how much HPs our healing spells heal, and the<br/>
&gt; exact numbers on our buffs, etc)<br/>
