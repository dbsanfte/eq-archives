<br/>
Anyhow, to get back on topic... I totally agree with hunting scarecrows at<br/>
14-17. They give great exp. They do hit hard and fast though... team up with<br/>
an Enchanter and they&#39;re easy pickings (Tashan&#39;s and Languid Pace work<br/>
wonders). I hunted them with an Enc friend and we never died once. We<br/>
started at 14(me) and 12(him) and left at 16(me) and 15(him). That area of<br/>
the W Karanas is pretty safe to med, and the odd wandering critter got<br/>
killed by his pet.<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly I teamed with a L15 monk one day when the Enchanter wasn&#39;t<br/>
around... found it _much_ harder. Not nearly as efficient, and the monk was<br/>
getting down there in HP.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing about hunting scarecrows... it&#39;s a refreshing change - it<br/>
makes you feel like a wizard with melee ability! (root, nuke, nuke, nuke,<br/>
tank the last 1/3) :-)<br/>

&gt; Even if games run on a <br/>
&gt; LAN and not over<br/>
&gt; the internet, odds are they should support IP as well, either <br/>
&gt; because it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; not much extra code (if they&#39;re using Winsock) or because <br/>
&gt; they roll their<br/>
&gt; own BSD sockets code, equally fairly easy.<br/>
