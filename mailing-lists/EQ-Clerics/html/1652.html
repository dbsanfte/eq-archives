Ok some ppl are wondering what will happen to ppl thats already on Lvl 50<br/>
and are still playing it.  What will become of all the exp they gained after<br/>
they got Lvl 50?  I think it would be dumb of Verant to allow them to go<br/>
from 50 to what ever Lvl just cause they have enough exp too.  Think about<br/>
it, would you wanna install the expansion pak just to see &quot;You moved up a<br/>
level(s), Welcome to level 60!&quot; or higher?  What fun would that be?<br/>
Like one said what if the lvl cap will be say 60 and when you install the<br/>
pak you find out you had enough exp to hit Lvl 60?  Wouldn&#39;t we all want to<br/>
earn those new lvls with the pak and not now and just have it stored away<br/>
till it comes out?<br/>
I go with what some say, have it to where when the pak comes out you need<br/>
one more kill or a few kills that give you exp to hit Lvl 51.  I doubt I&#39;ll<br/>
be on Lvl 50 by then anyways cause I&#39;m just taken my sweet time and getting<br/>
lvls when I get them and not rushing it.  But if I do make it to 50 by then<br/>
and I have enough exp to go up a few lvls I wouldn&#39;t wanna see welcome to<br/>
Lvl 53 or higher before I get to play the new pak.<br/>
Ok thats all.<br/>
