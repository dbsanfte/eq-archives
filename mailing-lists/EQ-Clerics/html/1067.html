<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1262100994">LOL That was my list awhile ago, but taken off that list the explaination why I<br/>
only included the one item from fear- not many people can get that stuff now,<br/>
even if they are level 50!  Anyway, Dark Mail Guanthlets cant be worn by<br/>
clerics- only other modification to that list.<br/>
<br/>
Ailamil<br/>
<br/>
PS- after dying 4 times last night and still having no body- all that stuff is<br/>
again on my wish list :(<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;Someone posted the following list of the &#39;best&#39; wisdom/mana<br/>
&gt;increasing items for a cleric (by inventory slot) on the internet.  I<br/>
&gt;forwarded it to my guild and titled it my wish list  ;)<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Sorry I dont have the persons name to give full credit to.  I&#39;ve tried<br/>
&gt;to notate where things come from. </span></blockquote></div>
