<div id="ygrps-yiv-1983686481">Mik i agree 100% with you, i was not debateing what you said, i was simply <br/>
stateing how i do it.  Furthermore, i melee alot but i choose to do it when <br/>
i am Oom, i have died on many occations, when i was oom and ordered my group <br/>
to flee, as i was full HP i stayed to get the critters of the rest of my <br/>
group.  IMHO i beleive that any cleric worth their salt will give up their <br/>
life to save the group as a whole, LOL don&#39;t get me wrong tho, i don&#39;t like- <br/>
try to die, heh, and i am not saying this is the right way to go for all <br/>
clerics, it is just the way i play the role, most often i do not die tho and <br/>
lvl right along with the rest of my group.  i have been blessed with a great <br/>
group when we have more than one on us, and i am being hit, i usually just <br/>
have to say &quot;rook on me&quot; and they are by my side, taunting or whatever, and <br/>
the only reason i ever lose anyone is if i am being hit and interuppted, <br/>
that part od it sucks, but alas we do have another cleric in group who <br/>
mainly does melee, so if i fail on a heal she can usually get my back,,,,, <br/>
thats all :)<br/>

&gt;Yes, Anne, I agree that first and foremost we are and should be healers.<br/>
&gt;THAT is our primary role in EQ.  But as I said in my previous post,  there<br/>
&gt;are opportunities for you to get to melee even in a group, you just have to<br/>
&gt;know when NOT to melee but sit and med.  If I&quot;m FM and they just pulled a<br/>
&gt;critter, and I know they have to get down to 2 bubbs of health before I <br/>
&gt;heal<br/>
&gt;with complete healing, I&#39;m not gonna just sit or stand there and watch the<br/>
&gt;battle.  The key is knowing WHEN you get to and stay at melee, WHEN you use<br/>
&gt;your DD spells, and WHEN you sit down and do your heal and med routine.  <br/>
&gt;Not<br/>
&gt;a single one of my group has EVER questioned me when I get to melee or cast<br/>
&gt;a dd spell.  They trust me and know that I will not let them die because I<br/>
&gt;am not watching their hps or don&#39;t have mana to heal them or don&#39;t know <br/>
&gt;WHEN<br/>
&gt;to heal them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  I know one cleric whose tank died in the Avatar Room in Cazic because he<br/>
&gt;(the cleric)  didn&#39;t want to &quot;waste&quot; any mana on a complete heal and waited<br/>
&gt;til the tank was at 1 bubble before he began to cast, and then his spell<br/>
&gt;fizzled.  The tank was NOT happy and would not group with him anymore.  I<br/>
&gt;also &quot;grew up&quot; so to speak with a cleric/wizard wannabe, who didn&#39;t want to<br/>
&gt;do anything but nuke with his dd spells.  In fact, he even specialized in<br/>
&gt;Evocation instead of Alteration so he could save mana on his dd spells.  I<br/>
&gt;got tired of grouping with him because I couldn&#39;t depend on him as a <br/>
&gt;back-up<br/>
&gt;cleric for healing cause he never had any mana cause he was always nuking.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;A cleric who doesn&#39;t learn these &quot;Whens&quot; early on will not be effective.<br/>
&gt;It&#39;s called Learning How To Be A Cleric 101, with advanced courses as you<br/>
&gt;get older.  If a group member dies because you didn&#39;t heal him/her on time,<br/>
&gt;or didn&#39;t have mana to heal cause you were meleeing or throwing <br/>
&gt;Retributions<br/>
&gt;around like they were a 50 mana cost spell, then shame on ya and you should<br/>
&gt;go play another class cause you simply don&#39;t understand what clerics are <br/>
&gt;all<br/>
&gt;about and how to play them.<br/>
