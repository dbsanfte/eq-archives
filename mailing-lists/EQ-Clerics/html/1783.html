<div id="ygrps-yiv-1448586860">I know this from MANY hours in Befallen waiting on him.  He or his<br/>
placeholder spawn right at the entrance.  Not a little way down or anything<br/>
else, immediately inside the zone.  He then immediately shouts and walks to<br/>
the 3rd floor.  There are several random spots he can go to on the 3rd<br/>
floor.  To get him to spawn again (he seems to be between a 20 and 30 min<br/>
spawn) you have to find and kill the placeholder on the 3rd floor.  You will<br/>
know when you have the right one, because they *usually* do the shout again<br/>
when you attack them.<br/>

    Subject: [EQ-Clerics] Paw of Opalla<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
    Hey Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
    I really would like to complete my Paw of Opalla, i TOTALLY lucked in to<br/>
the first 3 rings, i camped Mitty for about an hour and she droped the gold<br/>
and copper.  Picked the silver up in Blackburrow, and now all i need is the<br/>
Platinum.  Therein lies the problem.<br/>
<br/>
    I have heard many differing accounts of where to find Gynok Molter.  So,<br/>
if you have SEEN him, not heard about him being somewhere, but ACTUALLY SEEN<br/>
HIM with YOUR character, please let me know where.  Yes, i know Befallen,<br/>
but where?  First floor in entrance area? Third floor near Elf Skeletons??<br/>
Please let me know any visual sightings.<br/>
<br/>
    Thanks,<br/>
