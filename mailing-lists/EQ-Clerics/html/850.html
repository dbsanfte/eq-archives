<div id="ygrps-yiv-2135073319">imo, i believe that verant had changed the star, but not the quest....i used<br/>
mine quite a bit when i got it, the proc went off about 5 times each fight<br/>
seems like, and it never seemed to run out.......another good way to raise<br/>
faction, (and it&#39;s alot simpler) is kill rabid wolves and bears in qeynos<br/>
hills, save the putrid pelts, and take them back to Priestess Caulria in the<br/>
ufo thingie...i took about 17 to her, and raised my faction enough to get<br/>
the quest...might be less tho.....i just wanted to make sure i had plenty<br/>

&gt; I picked up a Shining Star of Light the other day.  Just some words of<br/>
&gt; advice for anyone trying this quest.  It starts in Qeynos, true, but<br/>
&gt; the first thing you need is from Rivervale.  My faction was &#39;dubious&#39;<br/>
&gt; and I still got it, but the npc still gave me crap.  I went ahead and<br/>
&gt; spent a couple of days there just raising faction with them.  By the<br/>
&gt; time I got to Qeynos, I was indifferent with the priests there, and<br/>
&gt; they wouldn&#39;t give me the quest.  There is a quest to deliver blessed<br/>
&gt; oil flasks to west karana.  Best thing to do is bind yourself near the<br/>
&gt; temple and deliver the flask to west karana and then gate back;<br/>
&gt; repeat.  You need to improve the priestsoflife faction.  Killing<br/>
&gt; gnolls won&#39;t do that.<br/>
&gt;   My friend actually got me the mace.  I gave him my item, and before<br/>
&gt; he got the mace, he gave me his.  Saved me a heck of a lot of time.<br/>
&gt; He had been working on his faction for a while before I arrived.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Once you get it, the guy says, if you want to [recharge the shining<br/>
&gt; star of life] talk to soandso in the storeroom.  He called it the<br/>
&gt; shining star of LIFE.  Interesting.  Does anyone know how many charges<br/>
&gt; this thing has, or how long it&#39;s gonna last me before I have to make<br/>
&gt; another trip back to Qeynos?<br/>
