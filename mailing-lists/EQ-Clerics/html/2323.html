<b>Subject:</b> One more problem with the not-so-new-anymore armor quests <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1712575802">Besides all the camp problems, if our suit of armor was easier to obtain the first problem I would have is that PALADINS GET MORE WISDOM THAN WE DO with the new armor!!! <br/>
We get a pair of bracers +5 each (10 total, plz correct me if I am wrong (; ).... <br/>
<br/>
and paladins.... <br/>
<br/>
get a Helm that&#39;s +8 and vambraces that are +6 for a TOTAL OF 14!!! <br/>
<br/>
I though Palys were only about 25% cleric....so then why do they get 40% more wisdom than us.... <br/>
<br/>
=( <br/>
<br/>
(no meaning to disrespect palys but, plz verant make some sense) <br/>
