<div id="ygrps-yiv-801009845">ahem...verant HAS said they could make that much....hence trade skills<br/>
also....you forget that some are creative in their endeavours and you can<br/>
sell armor/weapons for a nice amount if you can make/get ahold of them :)<br/>

Look, all I&#39;m saying is that there are thousands of people, myself<br/>
included, that scrimp and save and sell every rusty mace, bat wing<br/>
and spider leg we have just to get by.  I have just about crawled out<br/>
of places like Befallen to sell every piece of junk I looted.  Even<br/>
asking my team-members, &quot;if you don&#39;t want that trash, give it to me&quot;.<br/>
  If you are 15th level, and are making 250 plat an hour, then Verant<br/>
is obviously not aware of it, because that goes against the whole<br/>
philosophy of the game.  It simply was not designed so that 15th level<br/>
characters have that much money.  So you&#39;re not cheating, fine.<br/>
  Could you at least share with us the means by which you are getting<br/>
this money?  Is it a quest, or specific mob, are you auctioning stuff<br/>
off, what?<br/>
  Of course we&#39;re all accusatory, because we&#39;re all skeptical!<br/>

&gt;its lovely to see faith in mankind....i swear.....if someone learns how to <br/>
&gt;do something that another doesnt know...and IS NOT exploting crap....its <br/>
&gt;cheating right off the bat.  How about you try hunting things that drop <br/>
&gt;items that if your quick enough...or bind at the right spot you can make <br/>
&gt;some nice cash....and notice...i didnt say I was alone did I?<br/>
<br/>
&gt;hey look...i finished this quest....or I did this and got an item NO ONE <br/>
&gt;has seen. (aka- i&#39;ve just gotten a fiery avenger or something)  I&#39;d love to<br/>
<br/>
&gt;have people telling me i&#39;m exploiting something because I just got an item <br/>
&gt;no one has....and I&#39;m sure you&#39;d be right there to line up with them.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;i DO NOT cheat at online games...or any type of roleplay....thanks for <br/>
&gt;thinking that though.<br/>
