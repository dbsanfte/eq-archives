<div id="ygrps-yiv-588637852">Sorta hard to describe where he is...basically, he is near the zone to the<br/>
live side of LG.  Best way to show you where he is is have someone lead you<br/>
there or look at a map of UG.<br/>
<br/>
Dunno how exciting it would be for your guild to hunt there though.  Maybe<br/>
if they kill all the frogs while getting there.  His placeholder and his<br/>
spawn time is 15 min.  I truely believe he only spawns twice in 24 hours<br/>
though...if even that...sometimes I think he only spawns once in 24 hrs.  I<br/>
camped that spot for 48 hrs straight practically and finally just traded<br/>
some stuff for the leggings.  I heard some people who were after the leggins<br/>
have to camp over a week to get em.  BTW the legs are the rare drops.  I<br/>
collected up to 3 arms while camping him in 48 hours.<br/>
<br/>
The reason why I say that this spot might be boring for a guild raid is due<br/>
to the fact that it is usually camped...by ppl who usually can camp<br/>
solo...(i.e. druids, wizzie, necro, shamans, etc) The arms are sought after<br/>
by the int casters and the leggins are sought after by all the wis casters.<br/>
On top of that...it&#39;s a pretty boring camp.<br/>
To camp it solo...you must be at least 36.  A small group (let say less then<br/>
5 ppl) of 25+ can handle that spot easily.<br/>
<br/>
Might be best to have your guild do the entire UG to liven things a bit.<br/>
Making a round of all the name spawn area might be fun.</div>
