<b>Subject:</b> RE: Where can I find Greater Heal?!-Resolved <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1954891174">Thank you all for responding to my plead for help.  I found the greater heal<br/>
spell, of all places, in the druid guild in Rivervale. *grumbles*<br/>
<br/>
I have another question though.  Specialization.  Alternation seems the<br/>
logical skill to specialized in but I have noticed that abjuration seems to<br/>
take HUGE amount of manna.  Everytime when I&#39;m done buffing the tanks I am<br/>
OOM.  Any advise on which is better to specialize in?<br/>
