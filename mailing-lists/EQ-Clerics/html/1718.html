<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1396315683">So basically those of us who still have to rely on Smiting are screwed....<br/>
bloody HELL...  Was hoping that this might be an item I could possibly<br/>
get...  <br/>
<br/>
Add in the fact that now everyone knows about the quest ....<br/>
<br/>
by the time i manage to get the Paw they&#39;ll be a dime a dozen like<br/>
bloodforge hammers....  so much for having a semi rare item...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve already wasted 10PP trying to get p34 for the Testament as well...<br/>
but I&#39;m dubious to him so I doubt I&#39;m gonna get anything...<br/>
<br/>
ok, new topic....<br/>
<br/>
Where can a 21st level Cleric(human) possibly go to get some XP...   I&#39;m<br/>
sooo tired of pull and kill in Permafrost and Unrest... with the all the<br/>
deaths I&#39;m barely gaining XP....  I lose like 3/4 to a full bub of XP<br/>
everytime I die... I&#39;ve been a half a bub from 22 three times now and RIGHT<br/>
now I&#39;m at less than a bub into 21...  for level 20 I could hunt scarecrows<br/>
to make up for the XP I lost in Perma... but now I get jack from em...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve tried the undead at lake rathe, but it&#39;s usually camped like high holy<br/>
hell and everyone is so freakin obsessive there...  I accidently Expulse a<br/>
db some guy is walking towards and he chews my head off for 20 minutes on<br/>
shout... telling everyone I&#39;m a KSer...  right, sure, a freakin CLERIC<br/>
KSing... HAHAHAHAHA<br/>
<br/>
Help Please!   getting SO frustrated....</div>
