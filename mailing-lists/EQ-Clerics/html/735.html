<div id="ygrps-yiv-1045460698">Azor, as a regular on test, I can tell you that everyone that showed<br/>
up just to test the racewar were what we on test refer to as &quot;kewl<br/>
doodz&quot;.  Your average 15 year-old asshole that wants nothing more than<br/>
to make a gnome enchanter so he can go invis and DOT your character<br/>
while you&#39;re picking up loot off a dead creature you just killed for<br/>
some quick cash.  (Do I sound like I&#39;m talking from experience?  I am)<br/>
These are the some ones that will spam the chat room when test server<br/>
goes down just because they think it&#39;s funny.  They&#39;re real dorks, and<br/>
everyone on test is just counting the days when they will all leave to<br/>
join their other obnoxious friends on the race war.<br/>
  And from what I heard, there were over 5000 people on Tallon Zek.<br/>
They are adding another server, and they will both be up Wednesday,<br/>
according to the banner.  Some estimates put the number as high as<br/>
7000.  (2000 in the queue)<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly enough, on test right now, looting is enabled; meaning<br/>
that if I die, someone from another team can loot me for my cash and<br/>
1 item.  Oddly enough, from what I&#39;ve seen, this has really curbed<br/>
the violence on test.  I think it put a little fear in them.  I died<br/>
last night in Misty from a Kodiak and a friendly gnome looted me so<br/>
&quot;no one else could get it&quot; and was kind enough to give it back to me,<br/>
to the last copper.  I think it&#39;s absurd to think, that a death from<br/>
a kodiak would enable someone else to loot me.  that doesn&#39;t seem to<br/>
make any sense.<br/>

&gt;I can&#39;t believe how that Team Server went, even tho the had a banner up<br/>
&gt;about all day saying &quot;PLEASE don&#39;t hang out on the chat server waiting for<br/>
&gt;Tallon Zek, it will be up much,, much later tonight&quot; ppl still lived in the<br/>
&gt;chat rooms making it VERY hard to log into the game.  Heard there was over<br/>
&gt;4,000 ppl in Tallon Zek when it went live, not too long after it went up<br/>
&gt;they took it down saying they wasn&#39;t gonna put it back up till they had <br/>
&gt;more<br/>
&gt;Team Servers up and that would be at least a week.<br/>
&gt;From what I read while ppl waited for it to get up that there were TONS of<br/>
&gt;ppl in the chat room, many cussing and screaming about it.  I&#39;ve also<br/>
&gt;noticed this when a few or all servers go down, ppl act like that can&#39;t <br/>
&gt;wait<br/>
&gt;for a few hours to get back on.  Theres some much to real life and tons of<br/>
&gt;things to do outside but yet ppl would rather sit in the house all day<br/>
&gt;playing EQ instade of spending time with friends and loved ones but of<br/>
&gt;course they just sit there and whin every 5 seconds about &quot;When&#39;s it gonna<br/>
&gt;be back up?&quot; throw in a few cuss words and whin some more.  I may be flamed<br/>
&gt;for this letter, but I just can&#39;t see why ppl acted that way.  Yes I play <br/>
&gt;EQ<br/>
&gt;like crazy, but I try to hang around friends and family as much as I can.<br/>
&gt;Guess like that post on a web site said &quot;I refuse to call EQ a real game,<br/>
&gt;it&#39;s video game crack&quot;.  If ya feel the need to flame me, go a head, but I<br/>
&gt;bet many of you agree with what I&#39;m saying here.  It&#39;s just my 2 cents (or<br/>
&gt;2cp).<br/>
