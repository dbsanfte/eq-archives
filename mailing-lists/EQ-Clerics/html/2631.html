&gt; <br/>
&gt; Regarding playing a level 50 cleric:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Symbol buffs:<br/>
&gt; Pinzam gem is a jasper (cost about 8gp or so depending on faction)<br/>
&gt; Naltron gem is a peridot (cost about 11pp or so depending on faction)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Tanks NEED the extra HP&#39;s that Naltron brings for dragon runs, etc.  If you<br/>
&gt; cannot afford the gems, have them give you pp for them or bring some in<br/>
&gt; advance.  (I Naltron everyone for dragons, but that is just me)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I gives Pins, if they want Naltron they pay 12pp (it costs me 12pp 5gp)<br/>
or provide the stones. Most people when I tell the cost just go, &quot;hmm,<br/>
give me pins then&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Regarding Complete Heal:<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t use in dragon situations.  Occasionally I use on the planes, dungeon<br/>
&gt; hunts and fire giant type runs, but ONLY on tanks with HP&#39;s over 2500 or so.<br/>
&gt; Mana cost for C-Heal is 400 (versus 250 for Superior heal) and can save you<br/>
&gt; a bit of mana on high health point tank types.  If you do use it, it is best<br/>
&gt; if you start to cast when HP&#39;s drop to 2 bubbles.  You will get a feel for<br/>
&gt; when you will have time to do this and when a superior heal is needed for<br/>
&gt; the lower casting time.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Another good use is when you have 2 healers. One does completes, the<br/>
other makes sure no one dies while the completes are coming.</div>
