You use fish scales as an element in the Enduring Breath spell!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen druids auctioning for fish scales. (What&#39;s more, as your fishing skill<br/>
goes up, it becomes harder and harder to fish them up for yourself)<br/>
<br/>
Same for fire beetle eyes, bat wings, and snake skins.<br/>
(Flame Lick, Levitate, a shaman spell)<br/>
<br/>
Of course, necros need LOTS of bone ships<br/>

&gt; Yea, it is a weird element to the game.  Another truly bizzarre thing<br/>
&gt; is how the economy makes no sense at all.  You&#39;ve got merchants who<br/>
&gt; willingly buy things that have no market value, ie, fish scales.  And<br/>
&gt; will gladly give you money for them.  I mean, let&#39;s say I&#39;ve got 100<br/>
&gt; fish scales in my inventory and walk up to a merchant, he&#39;ll buy them<br/>
&gt; off me with a smile.  What&#39;s he gonna do with all those fish scales?<br/>
&gt; Is there some sort of underground trade in fish scales that I&#39;m not<br/>
&gt; aware of?  I don&#39;t know how these merchants are making any money.<br/>
