&gt; &quot;Divine ain&#39;t that good&quot;  pff..  I&#39;d like to see you root 3 festering<br/>
&gt; hangs and gate out alive.  You&#39;ll NEVER do it.  However.. one divine<br/>
&gt; aura and you&#39;ve escaped all of them without the least bit of<br/>

 </span></blockquote>    Is attacking the guy for stating his opinion really necessary?  I mean<br/>
lighten up.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps the situations he gets involoved in, are mainly single oponents,<br/>
with slower attacks, and hence gate is a better option.  If those 3<br/>
festering hags you were talking about were away from a zone border, you<br/>
probably still wouldnt make it out alive. Even with Divine.</div>
