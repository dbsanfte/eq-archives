<div id="ygrps-yiv-1813925415">Does Alcohol Tolerance count as a trade skill?    :)    I make a good drunk,<br/>
high elf cleric.  Probably not, as you don&#39;t actually earn anything, oh well.<br/>
Tailoring and Jewelcrafting would be my favorite two, followed by baking, then<br/>
brewing.  Fletching was a pet project of my ranger awhile ago, I&#39;ll never go<br/>
through that again.  The costs of getting a 75 int ranger to skill 200 took<br/>
about 1/2 of what it cost to get to 200 in jewel crafting (I don&#39;t have any<br/>
characters that JC, but a friend and I compared costs involved), which is about<br/>
200 times as much as getting to 150 in brewing and baking combined!<br/>
