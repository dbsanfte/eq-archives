<div id="ygrps-yiv-1196930481">Our guildmaster, who is a paladin, just recently needed to raise his faction <br/>
with the priests of Life, in order to obtain his soulfire sword.<br/>
Basically what we did to help raise his faction was:<br/>
1) killing putrid skellies in South Karana(at Grimrots Camp)<br/>
2) Turning in diseased animal pelts to the Temple of Life<br/>
3) Doing the Blessed oil Quest til he turned green<br/>
<br/>
These will all raise your faction there. Even I, a person who originally <br/>
came from the temple of Life, needed to raise my faction in order to do the <br/>
quest. But to be quite honest, I did the quest simply cause I had never done <br/>
a quest before, I tried the weapon out like once to see what the effect was <br/>
and it has sat in the bank ever since.<br/>
