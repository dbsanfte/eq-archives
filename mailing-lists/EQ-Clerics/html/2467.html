<div id="ygrps-yiv-1689404860">One of the problems with Pick-up groups. I have to use pickup groups <br/>
occasionally, but I dread it.  I have only died 1 time in the past month <br/>
when grouping with guild members.  I die about 1/3 of the time with pickup <br/>
groups.<br/>
<br/>
Unrest is a great place, but not a good place to learn how someone else <br/>
reacts under pressure.<br/>
