&gt; I&#39;m part way through the Paw quest too and I need some help.<br/>
&gt; 1. Can I actually buy a Rat Meat Pie (or Rat Ear Pie) from Qeynos Hills, or can I only get the recipe from Rephas and still have to find a skilled baker to bake the pie? Rephas views me dubiously and won&#39;t talk to me anyway, but I have the recipe. I looked in the shop at the middle of the Hills zone and they didn&#39;t sell the pie. Tried to right click on Rephas but he&#39;s not a merchant npc.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You do need to keep clearing the top area near the zone.. I have had him<br/>
spawn 3 times in 1 1/2 hours (only carried the ring third time - the one<br/>
time I was hurt and out of mana and had to zone to stop him killing me..<br/>
) and other times I&#39;ve camped him for a week and only seen him once (and<br/>
I had been asking friends who were camping while I was offline and he<br/>
hadn&#39;t spawned).  In the end I bought the damn ring off a Wiz (who was 7<br/>
levels below me) who KS him from me AGAIN.. damn they are far too<br/>
powerful.. Aren&#39;t we supposed to be the masters of undead destruction...<br/>
