&gt; I use either the bloodforge hammer, or my SSOL and a Shiny Brass<br/>
&gt; Shield (you can get the SBS off the trainer in Crushbone).  It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; fairly difficult to get (mine was given to me), but you could probably<br/>
&gt; buy one.  It does weigh a fair bit, but gives +10 vs. magic.  Other<br/>
&gt; than a shield, I&#39;m not sure what you can hold in an off-hand.  Besides<br/>
&gt; a light source such as a lantern.  :) </span></blockquote></div>
