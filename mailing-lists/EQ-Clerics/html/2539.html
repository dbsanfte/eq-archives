<div id="ygrps-yiv-1522126370">I don&#39;t have the rest of the messages for this thread, but if you are <br/>
referring to asking people for items, cash, etc.... Rule number one is don&#39;t <br/>
do it.  I never ever respond to someone who asks me for things, I dislike <br/>
beggars.  I will gladly help another who merely just chats with me, if I get <br/>
to talking with someone.  I will offer all kinds of information and advise, <br/>
as well as giving items and cash.  But never never if they ask for it.<br/>
<br/>
let me give an example.....I was on another server with a lvl 5 cleric I <br/>
made, she was still roaming around west freeport and she saw a dwarf enter <br/>
where she was resting.  She merely said &quot;Greetings&quot;, asked how he was, <br/>
talked with him for a bit, I never once asked for a thing.  He was a level <br/>
47 cleric.  He buffed me very well, and asked if I would like a weapon. I <br/>
thanked him over and over, because its people like that who make the game <br/>
worth playing.  He was a generous man.  I was happy to chat with him and <br/>
that he would sit and chat with me.  He ended up giving me a Combine Morning <br/>
Star, Black Iron medallion and 200 plat, I was shocked to say the least. I <br/>
will never forget his generousity and hope I can repay him sometime.   My <br/>
level 50 cleric has done this very same thing for lower level characters, <br/>
just because they sat and chatted, and Didn&#39;t beg.<br/>
<br/>
If I am completely off what the topic of this thread is I apologize, just <br/>
responding to what I saw in this last posting.<br/>

&gt;I find that really amazing, I occasionally get a little bit of help when it <br/>
&gt;comes to equipment, something like ringmail that someone doesn&#39;t need <br/>
&gt;anymore, but never that much equipment or PP. Sometimes I wonder about <br/>
&gt;that, my friends get free stuff all the time, is it the way you ask or <br/>
&gt;something?<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;At the entrance he again asked me if I would not accept a tip.   I told <br/>
&gt;him<br/>
&gt; &gt;that yes I would accept a small one expecting a pp or two maybe.  Well he<br/>
&gt; &gt;tipped me 50pp.   Needless to say I was stunned but accepted.   50pp to a<br/>
&gt; &gt;5th level is a fortune for sure.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t quite go to that extreme, but I do something similar on a regular<br/>
&gt;basis. When I run out of cats eye, and I&#39;m in a town I have bad faction, I<br/>
&gt;always give a 1st lvl character 15 PP to pick me up 40 of them. At 2 and a<br/>
&gt;half gold each, he gets 5 PP to keep. A nice bonus for a first lvl. </span></blockquote></div>
