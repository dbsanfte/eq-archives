<div id="ygrps-yiv-933729552">I&#39;m level 28, only a handfull of spells shy of level 29 and I have all my spells in my backpack so that as soon as I level I can learn them.  I was just wondering if anybody can tell me anything about the Divine Barrier spell?  I know that it is an upgrade to Divine Aura, but what does it improve on?  Does it last longer?  It can&#39;t possibly cast any quicker or cost less mana =).   I already bought the spell so if it&#39;s a waste, then so be it... just wondering what advantages this spell has over its predecessor.<br/>
