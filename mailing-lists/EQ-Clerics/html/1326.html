&gt;&lt;snip much info about first to camp has right of way&gt;<br/>

&gt; The only fair way IMO is first there stays there, regardless of level, then<br/>
&gt; whomever was next gets it next, and so on and so on.  Get in line and take a<br/>
&gt; number.  No one group of players should be favored over another.<br/>

I completely agree. Unfortunately, your way favors the first group over<br/>
all others. The only BALANCED way to work a camped area is to rotate.<br/>
Sure, rare drops on rare spawns means that one group may get lucky and<br/>
get that prized Rubicite Breastplate before the group that has been<br/>
there the longest, but then, they may not. That&#39;s called randomness. To<br/>
prevent favoritism, rotating the kills is, imho, the only balanced<br/>
method. Your path gives everything to the first group to get there.<br/>
Hardly fair. Especially if there is more than one mob spawning at a<br/>
site.<br/>

&gt; To do it Brad&#39;s way, would mean that any player that didn&#39;t get an item<br/>
&gt; while he/she was<br/>
&gt; able to get exp from that particular mob could basically never get that item<br/>
&gt; cause they could be<br/>
&gt; thrown out of the camp spot everytime lower levels came along.  This is<br/>
&gt; totally not fair.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I also agree with this. I don&#39;t think it is fair to kick higher levels<br/>
out just because they are higher level. However, if they are preventing<br/>
the fair distribution of action at a site, then I believe they should<br/>
voluntarily offer to share the site, not leave it. If they continue to<br/>
monopolize the site, then I think that a request to leave is not<br/>
unwarranted, even if it means they will have to come back to try for<br/>
that prized item. They&#39;d have precious little to complain about if they<br/>
shared, rather than monopolized, the camped site.<br/>
