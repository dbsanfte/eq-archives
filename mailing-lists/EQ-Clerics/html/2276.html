 </span></blockquote>The Silver Ruby veil usually sells for around 250pp... but actually you are within the level range where you can  start going to unrest... If you get another couple of levels you will be able to camp a room in unrest with ease (with a group of course) and once you do that the money pours in... most of the undead in the house carry FS weapons.   When I was around level 24-26 I was camping the hand room with a group and literally making about 100pp per night  (I work all day so one knight is like 4 hours or so for me...)   At that point, it doesn&#39;t take all that long to save up for a Plat ruby veil and it is well worth the money (IMHO).   I payed 650pp for my Plat Ruby veil and it was worht every copper.<br/>

You can also save up to buy plat jasper rings and upgrade your rings.   They usually cost around 200pp each.  If you look really hard you might be able to get them for 150-160pp...   This gives you a total of +15 wisdom (+7 for the veil and +6 for each ring, -4 wis for the 2 rings you will be getting rid of) and costs a total of 1000pp or so.   It sounds like a lot, but that wisdom amounts to a pretty good chunk of mana and each wisdom point counts for more mana every level... so it definately pays off.<br/>
