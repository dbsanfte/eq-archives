<div id="ygrps-yiv-1435492605">Kill Dylin Fireshine in Highpass Hold.  Get page 30 from him.<br/>
<br/>
Go to Qeynos and find Moodoro Finharn in North Qeynos either in or<br/>
near Crows Pub.  Say &quot;I want page 34&quot;.  He will make you play a card<br/>
game. for 4gp he will give you a card.  If the card is the jester,<br/>
give it back to him.  He will give you page 34.  Give him 2gp and he<br/>
will give you a 2-slot book.  Put both pages in the book, and hit<br/>
combine.  That&#39;s it.<br/>
  The quest actually originates in Erudia, but someone on here tipped<br/>
us off that you didn&#39;t actually have to go to Erudia to get the book.<br/>
That, by giving Moodoro the 2gp, he would give it to you.  With that<br/>
little tip, it&#39;s incredibly easy to get, and well worth it.<br/>

question to ask...I&#39;ve heard it touched on and not seen any answers as<br/>
to how to complete it!<br/>
