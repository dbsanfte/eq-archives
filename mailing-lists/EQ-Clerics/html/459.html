&gt; I play on the test server, but I did see a lvl 2 wood elf in a full<br/>
&gt; compliment of leather, which I thought was pretty odd.  So this<br/>

spend the time getting it.  When I hit level 5, my character sat and<br/>
fished (and fished, and fished, and fished, and ...) until he had enough<br/>
to, yes, buy a full leather outfit.  Not twinking - just a lot of<br/>
industriousness.<br/>
