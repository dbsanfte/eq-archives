<div id="ygrps-yiv-253463802">Res not only depends on which form you use but also the level of the person<br/>
you use it on, i am lvl 34 now and of course mine gives back no XP at all, i<br/>
have been resed by a 39 cleric and have noticed a slight change in my XP<br/>
nothing really noteable, however just last night 2 party members died just<br/>
before I arrived in Solusek&#39;s Eye. there was a lvl 49 cleric there , of<br/>
course with the best res spell, my wizard friend who is also lvl 34 got half<br/>
a bubble of XP back, however, my paladin friend who is in Hell lvl 30, those<br/>
of you who have reached 30 know about this, he did not notice any movement<br/>
in his XP bar after res.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps<br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt; almost 16.  But maybe cause you just got it and it doesn&#39;t do as good<br/>
&gt;when<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; you first get it?  That might be it or just a  bug or it did give those<br/>
&gt;few<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; ppl exp back, I don&#39;t think it gives ya a good bit back just a little<br/>
&gt;bit<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; and maybe they just couldn&#39;t tell.<br/>
