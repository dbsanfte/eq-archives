<div id="ygrps-yiv-2089162112">Drinking alcohol most definately increases Str and Sta, but if your<br/>
tolerance is low you will most likely not get to see that affect. At low<br/>
levels of tolerance the int and agi loss are more then the Str and sta<br/>
gain.<br/>

&gt; In my experience drinking alcohol does not add to strength as I had heard it<br/>
&gt; would (maybe some warriors, etc - but not clerics that I have seen) - and<br/>
&gt; you wouldn&#39;t want to drink while hunting because it makes you interrupt on<br/>
&gt; your casting times.  It will not affect your wisdom, but the more you drink<br/>
&gt; the more your intelligence will drop.  It is a pretty useless skill for a<br/>
&gt; cleric and more for fun and roleplay, in my opinion.<br/>
