<div id="ygrps-yiv-247818472">&lt;then the next time a<br/>
level 50 wizard shows up and nukes a mob  my  group has been  camping for<br/>
hours , should I tell them  &quot;Mik says its first com first served&quot;  and to go<br/>
away. Think about it.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I HAVE thought about it.  And if THAT is Verant&#39;s policy, then YES, that is<br/>
what you tell them and they must yield or face adverse action from Verant.<br/>
Under Brad&#39;s proposed policy, if I&#39;ve been camping an item for hours where<br/>
the mob is green, and YOU, a lower level comes along and tells me to go<br/>
away, then I have to yield.  Is THAT fair?  Think about it.<br/>
<br/>
Neither Mystix nor myself  have ever said it was fair for a higher level to<br/>
take a spawn from a lower level that was already there.  I do NOT support<br/>
that, and I think Verant needs to do SOMETHING to fix the problem.  I just<br/>
don&#39;t think what Brad is proposing is the solution.  They need to find a<br/>
solution that doesn&#39;t penalize one group over another, that&#39;s all I am<br/>
saying.  Why does everyone think I am supporting high level jerks who muscle<br/>
their way in and steal spawns? I&#39;m NOT.  I abhor such people and think<br/>
something DOES need to be done about them.  I just don&#39;t agree with Brad&#39;s<br/>
solution.  Sheesh, peeps, read our posts more carefully.<br/>
