<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1983773944">What gave you the idea that i was using your post as a springboard,<br/>
Rose? Our posts are relatively unrelated. And I already said in my post<br/>
that the clerics whom I&#39;ve given advice to didn&#39;t bother to take me<br/>
seriously.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reading, though. And just so everyone on this listserve knows<br/>
my feelings, I believe you all are good clerics (at least the ones whom<br/>
I&#39;ve seen post somewhat regularly). Otherwise, you wouldn&#39;t be here<br/>
reading this stuff while letting your RL work slide :)<br/>
<br/>

Hmm well since you are using my post as a stepping ladder to your<br/>
rant...lemme just first clarify to you that I know what a cleric&#39;s main<br/>
function in the group is.  Trust me.  Everyone loves me as a cleric.  My<br/>
first char on this game is a ranger, and I got her up to lvl 40....so I<br/>
know<br/>
what battles are like in tight situation.  I KNOW what it is like when a<br/>
cleric/healer does not heal...and one that runs around screaming and<br/>
wont<br/>
stand still for u to taunt the mob off...or one that runs to zone as<br/>
soon as<br/>
he/she starts to get hit...or one who thinks that nuking is better then<br/>
healing.  I know these thing.  I am not one of those clerics.  The best<br/>
way<br/>
to know how to play a cleric is to first play the opposite...a tank that<br/>
can<br/>
not heal or heal well...you would know what is expected in a cleric...or<br/>
what you think would make the best cleric.<br/>
<br/>
As to my question about cleric soloing...it isnt because I think Im a<br/>
wizard.  Hell, I know I am not even close in nuking power compare to all<br/>
other nukers.  The reason why I asked was due to the fact that I just<br/>
changed server and I would like to restart a cleric character...but I<br/>
want<br/>
to catch up to my friends.  It is as simple as that...just to let you<br/>
know<br/>
that my post was not the best springboard that leads to yours.  Since I<br/>
was<br/>
really referring to a &quot;solo&quot; situation and you are really talking about<br/>
a<br/>
&quot;group&quot; situation.  I mean, who cares if the cleric nukes if he/she is<br/>
soloing?  No one is going to get hurt except for the cleric.<br/>
<br/>
All protestation aside.  I have group with other clerics before who do<br/>
exactly what you said you hate about them.  Yes, it is a low lvl<br/>
thing...and<br/>
I tend to tell them that they need to sit their butt down, med, and<br/>
watch<br/>
the health bars, and for god sake dont let that health drops below<br/>
50%...esp<br/>
for casters.  So I think if you want to help the general well being of<br/>
your<br/>
server...you should take the time and just tell these inexperience<br/>
clerics<br/>
what their main duty is in the group...you never know, they might become<br/>
your regular cleric...and won&#39;t you rather have one who you know you can<br/>
trust?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Hi all :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve played clerics in the past, and when I was grouped, I knew my job,<br/>
&gt; and did it very well. I buffed the tanks before battle, watched their<br/>
&gt; health bars carefully during battle, and (at levels before 25) engaged<br/>
&gt; in a bit of melee if things were going well. No one had to ask me for a<br/>
&gt; heal. I mean, come on. When you go to the doctor, should it be necesary<br/>
&gt; for you to ask him to heal you? Hell, no. That&#39;s his job, for pete&#39;s<br/>
&gt; sake.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway, I have recently been playing a barbarian warrior, because I knew<br/>
&gt; that I wanted to continue to melee, which would be a no-no for my cleric<br/>
&gt; at higher levels. Now, however, I&#39;m finding it very difficult to find<br/>
&gt; good clerics to group with. My warrior is level 19 now, and I can<br/>
&gt; honestly say that I&#39;ve yet to find a cleric who knows what the hell he&#39;s<br/>
&gt; supposed to do in a group. Is this just a problem with lower level<br/>
&gt; clerics? I certainly hope so, because if I EVER see a cleric not buffing<br/>
&gt; or healing in my groups at higher levels, I&#39;ll kick that person out of<br/>
&gt; my group faster than you can say &quot;Bob&#39;s your uncle!&quot; I won&#39;t even bother<br/>
&gt; to try explaining to them what they&#39;re supposed to do, because by that<br/>
&gt; time, they will have already perfected their bad habits. And I have made<br/>
&gt; it my solemn duty to NOT get myself or my group killed because of<br/>
&gt; someone else&#39;s arrogant stupidity/ignorance.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That being said, I want to ask a question. Why are there (seemingly) so<br/>
&gt; many clerics out there who nuke? For pete&#39;s sake! There&#39;s a pefectly<br/>
&gt; good nuking class--wizard! Why didn&#39;t they choose that class?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I remember when I first got smite, I wanted to show everyone how<br/>
&gt; powerful I was. But I quickly got over it, because people much preferred<br/>
&gt; my healing and buffing capabilities over a smite or two during battle.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It just irritates the hell out of me when I have to fight side by side<br/>
&gt; with a cleric who&#39;s at full health and who won&#39;t get beat on because he<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t melee worth a damn AND he won&#39;t heal me, even when I&#39;m down to my<br/>
&gt; last bubble of health. GRRR!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway, thanks for reading my--somewhat--rant on clerics. If you have<br/>
&gt; any advice for me to give these people, I&#39;d be happy to hear it. Any<br/>
&gt; time I&#39;ve tried to offer them advice, they&#39;ve either ignored me, or gave<br/>
&gt; me some lame reason why they do what they do. Sigh.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Maybe I should resurrect my clerics....<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just curious...any clerics here solo (or come close to it) to lvl 50?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Is there a good website that tells you how to do the cleric armor quest?<br/>
&gt; Like the loc of the items.  On a scale of 1-10 (1 being easy and 10<br/>
&gt; being<br/>
&gt; hard.)  What do you rank the cleric quest to be? </span></blockquote></div>
