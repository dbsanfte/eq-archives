&gt; Ok, let me rephrase what I am saying.  It wasnt 5 hours it was 10 real<br/>
&gt; hour days.  But not back to back.  If you type /played at the screen it<br/>
&gt; gives you the total time you have spent with that character in the game.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 5 real life hours would be  insane to make it that high. :)<br/>
