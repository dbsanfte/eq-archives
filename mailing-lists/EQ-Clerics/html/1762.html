<div id="ygrps-yiv-683045527">Doesn&#39;t matter what slot you have something memorized in - charm will use any spell you have out - particularly if it is offensive =)<br/>
<br/>
I got swarmed by a group of 3 charmed ones once - I do have to say it was most humorous (course I was old enough to stay alive)  <br/>
<br/>
If a party member of yours does get charmed - I recommend root and run if they could kill you otherwise =)  It is best NOT to kill your own party members - tempting as it may be if they are obnoxious *winks*<br/>
