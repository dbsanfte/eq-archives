&gt;Sorry, can&#39;t agree with you on the stun issue either.  Doesn&#39;t make ANY<br/>
&gt;sense to me, much less total as it does to you. If you have been given the<br/>
&gt;ability by the gods to put a &quot;divine&quot; shield around yourself and make<br/>
&gt;yourself invulnerable from being hit, then you shouldn&#39;t be able to be<br/>
&gt;stunned because the critter MUST hit you to stun you.  Quite simply, you<br/>
&gt;can&#39;t get stunned if you can&#39;t get hit.  Now, if they would&#39;ve said Divine<br/>
&gt;Aura is strictly a spell to prevent you from taking any DAMAGE from a hit<br/>
&gt;but not to prevent you from BEING hit, then that is different.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But in my opinion, if we have the ability to cloak ourselves from damage,<br/>
&gt;it should include ALL damage, including stuns.  Because stun to me IS a<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;of moving, which to me, is STILL a type of damage. Just like the blinding<br/>
&gt;light spell.....its effects, aka damage, aren&#39;t reflected in loss of hps<br/>
