<div id="ygrps-yiv-1578740750">I just made 24, and just bought my spells<br/>
greater healing<br/>
bravery<br/>
wave of fear<br/>
counteract poison<br/>
symbol of Ryltan (and 20 bloodstones)<br/>
dismiss undead<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t buy hammer of striking (what a joke), and I didn&#39;t buy<br/>
instill fear.  Reason being I never used fear.  But my question is:<br/>
Is instill fear worth buying?  Is there some marvelous tactic using<br/>
the fear spells that I&#39;m not familiar with?  I figured wave of fear<br/>
would be really, really handy, but instill fear was kind of worthless<br/>
compared to it, if I understand them correctly.  Can someone shed<br/>
some light?<br/>
