<div id="ygrps-yiv-800568431">For high level mobs, such as the dragons themselves, cast Naltron on your<br/>
tanks just before the assault as it gives them much more hps than Pinzarn.<br/>
Also cast SoW,  and either your Resist Fire or Resist Cold spell, depending<br/>
on which dragon you are doing.  Keep Pinzarn, SoW, RM and your other resist<br/>
lines up at all times on all your party (assuming you are in a high level<br/>
area, such as the FGs, Planes, or Kedge.)  Your casters, especially<br/>
Enchanters, will need those extra HPs and other buffs because when mobs get<br/>
unmessed, they are really pissed at the chanters and attack em with a<br/>
vengeance.  One little tip.....if you get multiple critters and a chanter<br/>
has messed, do NOT let anyone attack one of the messed ones until a tank has<br/>
FIRST taunted it, to keep it off your chanter once you are ready to break<br/>
its mess.<br/>
<br/>
I used to ignore our group heal (GH) spells cause the ratio of hps restored<br/>
to mana cost was absurd.  Then they fixed Word of Health, to where it is a<br/>
very decent spell that restores a good amount of hps to all your party.<br/>
When we do dragons, we have two clerics in each of our assault groups.  The<br/>
clerics split up all the buffs along the way, and then when it&#39;s actually<br/>
time to assault the dragons, one of us will be responsible for GHs and the<br/>
other for SH and CH.  I can get off 4 GHs before I am OOM.  This has saved<br/>
our party more times than I can count at the dragons.  I have begun to keep<br/>
GH and SH memmed at all times when there are two clerics in our group, and<br/>
let the other cleric handle SH and CHs.  We always call out what we are<br/>
going to cast and on whom so we don&#39;t cross heal and waste mana, i.e. CH<br/>
Donzi (which stands for Complete Heal Donzi), or GH (group heal), and we<br/>
always say what our mana level is at constantly.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Regarding playing a level 50 cleric:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Symbol buffs:<br/>
&gt; Pinzam gem is a jasper (cost about 8gp or so depending on faction)<br/>
&gt; Naltron gem is a peridot (cost about 11pp or so depending on faction)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Tanks NEED the extra HP&#39;s that Naltron brings for dragon runs, etc.  If<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; cannot afford the gems, have them give you pp for them or bring some in<br/>
&gt; advance.  (I Naltron everyone for dragons, but that is just me)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Regarding Reso and AOF:<br/>
&gt; In extreme combat situation I will Shield of Words all the tanks<br/>
&gt; (+AC/+defense) and AOF the casters.  If a 49+ druid is around and they<br/>
don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; mind, they can cast Skin Like Nature (SLN) on tanks (does not stack with<br/>
&gt; reso and reso and SLN will not over-write each other)  You will still need<br/>
&gt; to cast your AC buff (SoW or AOF).  Druids can also help to cast the<br/>
Endure<br/>
&gt; cold/fire buffs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Regarding Complete Heal:<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t use in dragon situations.  Occasionally I use on the planes,<br/>
dungeon<br/>
&gt; hunts and fire giant type runs, but ONLY on tanks with HP&#39;s over 2500 or<br/>
so.<br/>
&gt; Mana cost for C-Heal is 400 (versus 250 for Superior heal) and can save<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; a bit of mana on high health point tank types.  If you do use it, it is<br/>
best<br/>
&gt; if you start to cast when HP&#39;s drop to 2 bubbles.  You will get a feel for<br/>
&gt; when you will have time to do this and when a superior heal is needed for<br/>
&gt; the lower casting time.<br/>
