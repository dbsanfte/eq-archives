<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-404145500">I can not speak for all young clerics only for my own.  When I am in a group<br/>
I will watch the health bars of all the others and break off from melee to<br/>
heal.  Most of the time when I am in a group and heal, the mob will start in<br/>
on me though.  I of course have taken off my auto-attack and changed target.<br/>
Most of the time I have even backed off away from the critter.   I take my<br/>
role as the medic in my group very seriously.  My buffs are not that great<br/>
yet at 10 as I only have center and the first level spell to use.   I do not<br/>
think that holy armor and center can be stacked.  As I have stated many<br/>
times here before though my problem is finding a group to start with.<br/>
<br/>
I also will not use smite that often in melee unless I am alone since I do<br/>
prefer to save my mana for healing and buffing.  Those two buffs alone take<br/>
me about two bars of mana.   I have around a 105 or 110 wisdom and two<br/>
wisdom rings of +2.   I know I need more items but they are expensive for<br/>
sure and I, like most my age, am pretty broke.<br/>
<br/>
I really do not see why the others fail to do their duty.  I often play<br/>
melee classes and have clerics and druids heal me when I am resting all the<br/>
time.<br/>

&gt; Hi all :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve played clerics in the past, and when I was grouped, I knew my job,<br/>
&gt; and did it very well. I buffed the tanks before battle, watched their<br/>
&gt; health bars carefully during battle, and (at levels before 25) engaged<br/>
&gt; in a bit of melee if things were going well. No one had to ask me for a<br/>
&gt; heal. I mean, come on. When you go to the doctor, should it be necesary<br/>
&gt; for you to ask him to heal you? Hell, no. That&#39;s his job, for pete&#39;s<br/>
&gt; sake.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway, I have recently been playing a barbarian warrior, because I knew<br/>
&gt; that I wanted to continue to melee, which would be a no-no for my cleric<br/>
&gt; at higher levels. Now, however, I&#39;m finding it very difficult to find<br/>
&gt; good clerics to group with. My warrior is level 19 now, and I can<br/>
&gt; honestly say that I&#39;ve yet to find a cleric who knows what the hell he&#39;s<br/>
&gt; supposed to do in a group. Is this just a problem with lower level<br/>
&gt; clerics? I certainly hope so, because if I EVER see a cleric not buffing<br/>
&gt; or healing in my groups at higher levels, I&#39;ll kick that person out of<br/>
&gt; my group faster than you can say &quot;Bob&#39;s your uncle!&quot; I won&#39;t even bother<br/>
&gt; to try explaining to them what they&#39;re supposed to do, because by that<br/>
&gt; time, they will have already perfected their bad habits. And I have made<br/>
&gt; it my solemn duty to NOT get myself or my group killed because of<br/>
&gt; someone else&#39;s arrogant stupidity/ignorance.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That being said, I want to ask a question. Why are there (seemingly) so<br/>
&gt; many clerics out there who nuke? For pete&#39;s sake! There&#39;s a pefectly<br/>
&gt; good nuking class--wizard! Why didn&#39;t they choose that class?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I remember when I first got smite, I wanted to show everyone how<br/>
&gt; powerful I was. But I quickly got over it, because people much preferred<br/>
&gt; my healing and buffing capabilities over a smite or two during battle.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It just irritates the hell out of me when I have to fight side by side<br/>
&gt; with a cleric who&#39;s at full health and who won&#39;t get beat on because he<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t melee worth a damn AND he won&#39;t heal me, even when I&#39;m down to my<br/>
&gt; last bubble of health. GRRR!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway, thanks for reading my--somewhat--rant on clerics. If you have<br/>
&gt; any advice for me to give these people, I&#39;d be happy to hear it. Any<br/>
&gt; time I&#39;ve tried to offer them advice, they&#39;ve either ignored me, or gave<br/>
&gt; me some lame reason why they do what they do. Sigh.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Maybe I should resurrect my clerics....<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just curious...any clerics here solo (or come close to it) to lvl 50?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Is there a good website that tells you how to do the cleric armor quest?<br/>
&gt; Like the loc of the items.  On a scale of 1-10 (1 being easy and 10<br/>
&gt; being<br/>
&gt; hard.)  What do you rank the cleric quest to be?<br/>
