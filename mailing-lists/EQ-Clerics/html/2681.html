<div id="ygrps-yiv-885226754">Another question,<br/>
Do you think gatorscale leggings are better than the cleric legs?<br/>
It&#39;s a AC 4 reduction, but an increase in +4 wisdom.  Just curious on<br/>
everyone&#39;s thoughts on this one.  Does gatorscale look like leather?<br/>
<br/>
That all depends on your style of healing. If you play a cleric like a<br/>
Paladin who has better heals, then go with the AC. But if you hang back and<br/>
focus on keeping everyone alive, then the bonus mana is always best.</div>
