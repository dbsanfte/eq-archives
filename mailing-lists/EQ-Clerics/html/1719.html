&gt;So basically those of us who still have to rely on Smiting are screwed....<br/>
&gt;bloody HELL...  Was hoping that this might be an item I could possibly<br/>
&gt;get...  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Add in the fact that now everyone knows about the quest ....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;by the time i manage to get the Paw they&#39;ll be a dime a dozen like<br/>
&gt;bloodforge hammers....  so much for having a semi rare item...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve already wasted 10PP trying to get p34 for the Testament as well...<br/>
&gt;but I&#39;m dubious to him so I doubt I&#39;m gonna get anything...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;ok, new topic....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Where can a 21st level Cleric(human) possibly go to get some XP...   I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;sooo tired of pull and kill in Permafrost and Unrest... with the all the<br/>
&gt;deaths I&#39;m barely gaining XP....  I lose like 3/4 to a full bub of XP<br/>
&gt;everytime I die... I&#39;ve been a half a bub from 22 three times now and RIGHT<br/>
&gt;now I&#39;m at less than a bub into 21...  for level 20 I could hunt scarecrows<br/>
&gt;to make up for the XP I lost in Perma... but now I get jack from em...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve tried the undead at lake rathe, but it&#39;s usually camped like high holy<br/>
&gt;hell and everyone is so freakin obsessive there...  I accidently Expulse a<br/>
&gt;db some guy is walking towards and he chews my head off for 20 minutes on<br/>
&gt;shout... telling everyone I&#39;m a KSer...  right, sure, a freakin CLERIC<br/>
&gt;KSing... HAHAHAHAHA<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Help Please!   getting SO frustrated....<br/>
