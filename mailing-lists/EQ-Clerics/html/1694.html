<div id="ygrps-yiv-1868261897">As I am currently level 28, my thoughts have turned towards the spells I<br/>
will get at level 29. Spells such as wrath, divine barrier and so forth<br/>
speak for themselves as to their use. I do however have a query regrading<br/>
revive.<br/>
<br/>
From the evidence of everything I have seen and heard, revive, resuscitate<br/>
and ressurection can only be cast on a corpse. This is fine and dandy, a<br/>
design decision I can live with. But, if I am not mistaken (please correct<br/>
me if I am), revive does not restore any lost experience. This leads me to<br/>
the hesitant conclusion that revive is only useful to others.<br/>
<br/>
For example: My party and I are hunting something really tough that will<br/>
slaughter us all if the slightest thing goes wrong. The slightest thing goes<br/>
wrong and we are all slaughtered. For some reason none of us were bound near<br/>
where we were hunting. Does this mean that I&#39;m the only one who has to<br/>
travel all the way back, while everyone else simply waits for me to teleport<br/>
them?<br/>
<br/>
So am I right in thinking this spell only has benefits for those other than<br/>
the cleric casting it? I&#39;m not complaining, since I (hopefully) don&#39;t know<br/>
all the facts. I may sound selfish and bitter, but I really just want to<br/>
know the whole story.<br/>
<br/>
Please don&#39;t take this the wrong way; I&#39;m very much looking forward to<br/>
having revive. There have been many times recently when I&#39;ve wished I had<br/>
it, as it would have saved a lot of time and effort.<br/>
