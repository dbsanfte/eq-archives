I think that the points that you brought up are very vaild.  I do not think <br/>
that anyone should be &#39;ignoring&#39; them.  Or maybe I am just blowing some <br/>
smoke out my ass I dont know... I just think that to a point you are <br/>
correct... We all are striving for a better place to &#39;live&#39; (even if it is <br/>
excapisim).  What servers do ya play on?  I know me and my group would love <br/>
to have an extra cleric along that would rp with us... as long as ya dont <br/>
mind the times we slip OOC. but as I have found out... the more some folks <br/>
are IC the more myself and others in the group will stay IC....<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 pp worth..<br/>

&gt;  Yes- I do agree with a lot of the messages. Nothing is ever perfect, and <br/>
&gt;I<br/>
&gt;chose to gripe about what was not perfect. Everquest is a great game <br/>
&gt;besides<br/>
&gt;the events I had to endure.<br/>
&gt;Perhaps I did venture with some bad people- I have learned from the earlier<br/>
&gt;posts that there are some great people out there in EQ. Perhaps I just have<br/>
&gt;the worse luck in the world when I am grouping.<br/>
&gt;  I am sorry to place my anger on EQ on this mailing list. I just wish <br/>
&gt;people<br/>
&gt;wouldnt think about reaching that next level so much- but I have learned <br/>
&gt;from<br/>
&gt;the earlier posts that it is not true.<br/>
&gt;  I must have the worse luck on meeting people on the two servers I mainly<br/>
&gt;play!! Sorry everyone :) igore my earlier posts :)<br/>
