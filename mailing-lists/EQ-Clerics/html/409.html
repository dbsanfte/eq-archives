<b>Subject:</b> OK- perhaps a lead on a weapon <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-730409750">I was in Rathe Mountains last night hunting and someone who i did not know<br/>
asked me if I knew anything about the shining star of light quest.<br/>
<br/>
I had never heard of it before, so i continued to ask this person what in<br/>
the world they were talking about. He said that is ia a cleric and paladin<br/>
only weapon and he said it is obtained through a quest of some sort.<br/>
<br/>
I have no info othewr than this, this person claims he has seen one and only<br/>
one of them and that is why he was asking me if i knew the quest( apparently<br/>
he wants to get one)<br/>
<br/>
I would like to find out about this, i don&#39;t even know if it really exists<br/>
and if it does what the stats of this weapon are.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps we can all keep an ear out about this item. Any info would be<br/>
appreciated<br/>
