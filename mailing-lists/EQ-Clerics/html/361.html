&gt;I couldnt agree with you more!!!! Last night Fennin Ro had OVER 1950 people<br/>
&gt;on that ONE server!!!!!! They need to lock that server down completely and<br/>
&gt;possibly move any level 10 and below character over to another server.<br/>
&gt;Personally, I don&#39;t think ANY server should ave more than 500 people on it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    I agree with others that Verant should not forcibly move people off a<br/>
server. I made good friends at level 5 and 6, fighting in the Orc camps<br/>
outside Kelethin, and they are friends to this day. Would have hated to be<br/>
moved away from them. Closing down the server to newbies is also<br/>
problematic. I think the world works best when there are players of all<br/>
levels in it. Heck, if there are no younger players, whom am I supposed to<br/>
sell all this ring I am getting in Unrest to? ;-) That would benefit the<br/>
power-levelers, who would always have people below them to sell loot to, and<br/>
hurt everyone else, who would not. Besides, having people of widely<br/>
different experience levels just makes for a more interesting world.<br/>

&gt;around...put some in Rathe Mountains, make a level 25+ zone on Erudin so<br/>
&gt;Ruby can drop there....but not all in one zone. Look at the Journeyman<br/>
&gt;boots. ONE NPC in the entire game has it, its a no drop item, meaning you<br/>
&gt;have to loot it yourself. Why cant this npc drop it everytime to stop<br/>
&gt;overcamping and people from Kill stealing? No, that would make way too much<br/>
&gt;sense, I guess.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>     I agree with this. Every 10th level wants bronze, every 20th level<br/>
wants rubicite. Therefore Unrest is jammed with the small races after small<br/>
bronze, and Cazic is jammed with people after rubicite. We need these items<br/>
more widely distributed.<br/>
