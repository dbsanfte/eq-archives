<div id="ygrps-yiv-2100320714">that was just my opinion....to me, i think it&#39;s like to get that stuff, you have to<br/>
work your way up to (now 46) and get a group of ppl together to earn that armor and<br/>
weapons....just my 2cp worth<br/>

&gt; If people are worried about twinking why dont they just put a level limit<br/>
&gt; on who can use it.  That, to me, seems like it would help.<br/>

&gt; &gt; well, most of the armor/weapons from fear plane are no drop (there are some<br/>
&gt; &gt; exceptions)....this keeps twinking down....won&#39;t see a lv 1 newbie running<br/>
&gt; &gt; around in full ethereal mist....or carrying a bladestorm </span></blockquote></div>
