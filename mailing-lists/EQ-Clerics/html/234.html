<br/>
I made this mistake in mistmoore last night (i was pulling) , ok this is a <br/>
bad idea. I cast root on a glyphed guard in the graveyard, but failed to see <br/>
the two casters behind it (my group handled it but i died almost as soon as i <br/>
got back to the group , pretty much jipping me of exp and losing some hard <br/>
earned exp in process..) Take my advice stick to healing buffing, besides you <br/>
get mobs on you enough just for the healing part ;)<br/>
