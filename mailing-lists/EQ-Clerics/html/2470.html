<div id="ygrps-yiv-1718550957">Ya, you&#39;re right.  Just something in me felt guilty about leaving.  After<br/>
all, I was the group leader, and I had invited people in to the group.  But<br/>
next time, I will definately know better... famous last words...<br/>

Personally, I would have left that group...and fast. It was established in<br/>
the beginning that you had problems with teamwork (the loot thing). If I see<br/>
that the group is not cooperating from the very start, I leave as quickly as<br/>
I can. It&#39;s not worth dying over when a better group is probably 10 ft.<br/>
away. Granted, it&#39;s not always easy to find another group, I will take<br/>
soloing over dying because of somebody else&#39;s stupidity. At least if I die<br/>
solo, I know it was MY fault.<br/>

&gt; Hi all,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The following is just a rant. Nothing of substance, just me venting about<br/>
&gt; last nites gameplay.  If you don&#39;t want to read it, feel free to skip.<br/>
