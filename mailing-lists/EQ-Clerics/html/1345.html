<div id="ygrps-yiv-1646970292">Thanks for sending it, as I said I did not see it yet, I agree it doesn&#39;t <br/>
appear to say anything about the buffs being changed, but I spoke to another <br/>
cleric and a ranger who are high level and the rangers SoW which used to <br/>
last 25 minutes  was only lasting for 10 minutes now and the cleric stated <br/>
&quot;he was wondering why everyone kept asking for resolution so often&quot;<br/>
So, i haven&#39;t seen this first hand just going on what I was told.<br/>

&gt;change. Nor do I see any SoW change. </span></blockquote></div>
