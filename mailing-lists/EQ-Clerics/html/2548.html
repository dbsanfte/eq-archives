<div id="ygrps-yiv-1906692368">Higher level fear spells, such as instill and invoke fear has lower saving<br/>
throw on the mobs.  Also keeps the mob feared longer.  Wave of fear is only<br/>
AE normal fear.  It works fine when you are in a bind, but they get<br/>
resisted a lot.  Also, use panick or spook the dead on undead stuff,<br/>
because they seemed to work a lot better on those.<br/>

&gt;I just made 24, and just bought my spells<br/>
&gt;greater healing<br/>
&gt;bravery<br/>
&gt;wave of fear<br/>
&gt;counteract poison<br/>

&gt;dismiss undead<br/>

&gt;I didn&#39;t buy hammer of striking (what a joke), and I didn&#39;t buy<br/>
&gt;instill fear.  Reason being I never used fear.  But my question is:<br/>
&gt;Is instill fear worth buying?  Is there some marvelous tactic using<br/>
&gt;the fear spells that I&#39;m not familiar with?  I figured wave of fear<br/>
&gt;would be really, really handy, but instill fear was kind of worthless<br/>
&gt;compared to it, if I understand them correctly.  Can someone shed<br/>
&gt;some light?<br/>
