<b>Subject:</b> Re: EQ Slowly Dying? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-737261718">I think I have to agree with you here.   I have played Gemstone III online<br/>
since October of &#39;92 and still love the game but find EQ mostly boring after<br/>
only a couple of months.<br/>
<br/>
My background is table top RPGs so I guess I really miss the roleplaying in<br/>
EQ.  It seems to be a fine game for the Doom/Heretic type of person who<br/>
loves to just go kill things and gain material wealth.  To me a longterm<br/>
game is much more than that.   It is the relationships you build up among<br/>
your friends and the other things that make a game more like a real world<br/>
than an arcade.<br/>
<br/>
I am really waiting for Hero&#39;s Journey myself to see what Simu can do with a<br/>
graphical game rather than just a text-based one like GSIII.  They are<br/>
already addressing the problems that EQ has an seem to have them solved.  I<br/>
do know that twinking will not be allowed to the degree that EQ has it.<br/>
Nothing really erks me more than seeing someone in full bronze or better in<br/>
a newbie area running around killing everything in sight and leaving it lay.<br/>
I have had kills stolen from young ones and when I say something to them it<br/>
is always so-and-so challenges you to a duel.  Some fair fight that would be<br/>
for sure.   My character in no armor with a rusty weapon against someone in<br/>
bronze armor with a combine or better weapon.  Yeah right!!<br/>
<br/>
Oh well, just my view point on EQ and why I do not spend much time there at<br/>
all.<br/>

&gt; since theres like 3-4 other RPGs coming out by the year 2000 I say one of<br/>
