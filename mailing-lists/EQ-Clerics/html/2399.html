<div id="ygrps-yiv-1226414149"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Hmm.. I have found the endure (and resist line at higher levels) to be<br/>
&gt; very useful.. I rarely go anywhere without at least endure magic up..<br/>
&gt; endure Fire is very useful in Lavastorm.. endure cold in permafrost.. <br/>
&gt; and poison/disease in befallen/unrest.. they each have their uses and it<br/>
&gt; cuts down on your healing quite a bit..  <br/>
<br/>
&gt; As for cancel magic.. try using it as a debuff.. drop a MOB&#39;s fire<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree... these spells do have their uses, though I haven&#39;t noticed a real large decrease in damage from the endure spells....  However, while they do have their moments I still rank their importance far beneath the heal, bind, smite, and dismiss undead spells...   If you have the money, by all means buy them all.. i bought them all and I&#39;m not trying to discourage anybody from buying the spells.  However, if you are short cash... I would put those spells last on the priority list.<br/>
