<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1633867703">Not that any discussion about Surefall Glade is really relavent to<br/>
this list, but does anyone know of any quests that are good to raise<br/>
faction with Surefall Glade? I killed Gnasher Furgutt in the hopes of<br/>
getting the medal of merit (+5 charisma), which I can use to make more<br/>
money when I trade with merchants, but I just got the head.  Well, the<br/>
guy in SG didn&#39;t want it from me.  I have to be better than indif to<br/>
do that quest.  So, I was going to try to raise it to get them to<br/>
amiably, or something.  Any suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
  I got the bottle of nitrates to deliver to the lady in WK but I<br/>
don&#39;t know where she lives.  He just said, &quot;in a hut by the road on<br/>
the way to highhold pass&quot;.  feh.</div>
