<b>Subject:</b> Mid-range hunting grounds... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-428854959">Hello fellow clerics:<br/>
<br/>
I have a lvl 12 dwarven cleric on Tarrew Mar and am wondering where some<br/>
good hunting grounds are for the mid-levels.  I&#39;ve been trying to hunt down<br/>
wisps, but I can&#39;t find a reasonable concentration of them.  Is there a<br/>
place that&#39;s particularly good for wisp hunting?  Any other tips for<br/>
advancing through these rather laborious levels?  I&#39;ve tried soloing (which<br/>
is about suicide) and grouping, but it&#39;s just slow.  Lemme know what you<br/>
think and how you made it to lvl 14.  Also, any money-making tips for this<br/>
strength would be MUCH appreciated =)  We all know a cleric&#39;s life is one of<br/>
perpetual poverty.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
