<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1325511168">Not once did I &quot;Whine&quot; about the game, just made a statement that ppl are<br/>
saying on the newsgroup.  Everyone whines when they do this and not, yet<br/>
they do nothing about it.  How many people whined about when they changed a<br/>
few cleric spell or the DoT they are talking about changing, as I recall a<br/>
lot.  They all should write Verant and tell them how they feel about how the<br/>
game is going, but instade the go &quot;O man I can&#39;t believe they are making our<br/>
class weaker!!!&quot;<br/>
And sometimes if you don&#39;t doing a little whining concerning EQ or any other<br/>
game things don&#39;t get fixed how you think they should.  So if theres<br/>
something about EQ you dislike, whats wrong with doing a little whining.<br/>
Sad I write one post about how things are going on in EQ and I&#39;m called a<br/>
whiner yet everyone else on here as whined more then once and everyone<br/>
agrees with them.<br/>

&gt; Thank you Chas for making your comment.  I&#39;ve grown tired of seeing the<br/>
&gt; sniveling and whining going on concerning this game. </span></blockquote></div>
