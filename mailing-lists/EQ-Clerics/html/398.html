<b>Subject:</b> Brad on EQ <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1405306462">Today on EQVault they posted a message from a guy named Billy and Brad<br/>
himself.  It goes like this<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Billy: A friend and I were talking about this, and it _seemed_ like a good<br/>
idea: have you guys ever considered letting players build their own house in<br/>
Everquest, similar to UO? The only limiting factor to me seems like the<br/>
actual size of the world, might be a tad cramped...<br/>
Brad&#39;s response: Our plans, which are long term mind you, involve<br/>
&#39;rentables&#39; first, and then perhaps housing later. But I&#39;m definitely not at<br/>
a point where I&#39;ll commit to either doing it, nor to a time frame :)<br/>
<br/>
Billy: Also, with Everquest(1), do you plan on making any improvements to<br/>
the graphics engine at all, or is basically what we currently see, all that<br/>
there is going to be (I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s a bad thing, the visuals in<br/>
Everquest look great...just wondering as time goes on).<br/>
<br/>
Brad: Absolutely -- EverQuest does not fully tap the potential of its<br/>
engine, and I think people will be pleasantly surprised as to how many<br/>
improvements visually we will make with upcoming zones and the Expansion<br/>
next year. You&#39;ll see more polygons, larger textures, more distant clipping<br/>
planes, more animation, and more things animated. And we&#39;re excited about<br/>
this, because a lot of the technology we put into the engine as finished<br/>
towards the end of the EverQuest development cycle and I don&#39;t think we were<br/>
able to totally exploit their potential -- now we can :)&quot;<br/>
