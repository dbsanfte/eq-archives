<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2065823892">I would definitely go with the stat increasing items.  In my experiences <br/>
with the game, this is what I have found.  A cleric will never be a tank and <br/>
yes you will get hit, Mobs tend to dislike clerics when they heal, do DD or <br/>
Stun, so AC is a good thing to have but Mana is king for a cleric, In my <br/>
opinion.  AC will in no way, shape or form save your life.<br/>
<br/>
It is an absolute necessity to have good tanks and for you to trust your <br/>
tanks, granted this takes time to get really comfortable with a good group <br/>
of people.<br/>
<br/>
Basically what i&#39;m saying is while AC is good, you should not be getting <br/>
hit.  When you do get hit, your tanks are obligated to taunt the beast off <br/>
of you, no matter how many mobs you are fighting.  This is the way it works <br/>
in the group I hunt with. My group is always the same with minor alterations <br/>
to one position, it is an advantage having a group that is with each other <br/>
all the time, you come to learn how each one will react in certain <br/>
situations.<br/>
<br/>
we have in our standard group:<br/>
Paladin, Ranger, Warrior, Wizard, Enchanter, and me the Cleric.<br/>
the Tanks( pal, rng, war)are very attentive to when a mob starts to hit a <br/>
caster or me, so the more wisdom I have the more I can effectively do my job <br/>
as it was intended which is healing.<br/>
<br/>
I even gave up my Azure sleeves ( 12ac) for Platinum armbands ( no AC, but 3 <br/>
wis) lol, never can have to much wisdom.<br/>
<br/>
Just my opinion,<br/>

&gt;Hail all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This question most likely has been asked already and I apologize if I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;repeating but I am new to the list and rather new to casting class in<br/>
&gt;general.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My question is, which is better, pure AC or stat enchancing armor?  I was<br/>
&gt;thinking of covering myself fully in bronze plate but there are things like<br/>
&gt;BS tunic, barb arms, silver plated bracers that I will be putting aside.  I<br/>
&gt;am playing mostly a casting cleric...and I figured AC would save my life<br/>
&gt;more then any stat enhancing armor.  Any thoughts?<br/>
