&gt;     Okay this is going to sound harsh man but heres the thing......Why did<br/>
&gt; you specialize in Evoke??&gt;&gt;One your not a wizard Two your a class that was<br/>
&gt; born to save lives and healing is the only way your going to succeed in<br/>
&gt; this. You should have specialized in alteration(hopefully guys thats the<br/>
&gt; right one for healing:)P) I know a lvl 43 cleric who has specialized in this<br/>
&gt; and the difference is amazing your heals heal more hpts, faster casting very<br/>
&gt; rarely does he not recover if hit when healing and it takes only close to<br/>
&gt; half the mana that a cleric who doesn&#39;t specialize uses. The results are<br/>
&gt; amazing at higfher lvls. However man dont think im gripping at you because i<br/>
&gt; have read your other mails and you know what your talking about. Its just i<br/>
&gt; would have picked the healing specialization....but now that I think about<br/>
&gt; it man your undead spells will be much much more efficient so maybe it was a<br/>
&gt; good choice. Now if you would have oicked something like divination or<br/>
&gt; conjuring we would have a really  really big problem on our hands. Well<br/>
&gt; thanks for hearing me out man...Later and goodluck.<br/>

&gt; P.S. The way it goes is when you specialize you can specialize in all your<br/>
&gt; fields but the first one to go over 50 is the one you will be the best at<br/>
&gt; and amy keep going up in all the others can not go past 50.. </span></blockquote></div>
