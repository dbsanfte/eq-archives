<b>Subject:</b> Re: how-to hotkey spells <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1747546493">My ghod man, you&#39;ve made it to lvl 15 without hotkeying spells? Now<br/>
that&#39;s amazing! =)  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, you had it right.  On the mem&#39;d spells on the top left side<br/>
of the screen, click and hold down the left mouse button until it<br/>
becomes a button itself.  Then drag it to a hotkey slot and place<br/>
it just one pixel to the right and one pixel or so down, then lft click.<br/>
For some reason (at least on my screen) it never catches if i place<br/>
the icon right over the hotkey square.  I have to place it just to the<br/>
right and down for it to latch on.  <br/>
<br/>
I never tried this, but if you have no spells memm&#39;d on those spell<br/>
slots, you can also try lft clicking on the empty spell slot until<br/>
it becomes a button.  Then just mem the spells in the slots that have<br/>
associated hotkeys.  <br/>
<br/>
Note: on my slower computer (amd 200), when i try to mem spells,<br/>
the response is so slow it sometimes clicks on the spell instead<br/>
of creating a button.  Just do the trial and error trick.  Also,<br/>
be sure you&#39;re in windowed mode (not full screen or transparent<br/>
screen).  <br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps,<br/>

&gt; I have a silly question. Been trying to figure out how <br/>
&gt; people are putting spells in there lower left hand hot key <br/>
&gt; slots. I&#39;ve tried doing it the way you put other things <br/>
&gt; there, i.e. left click and holding, but that just casts the <br/>
&gt; spell. I have also tried memming that spell to the hot keys <br/>
&gt; but that doesnt work either. I know there is something <br/>
&gt; simple I&#39;m missing so PLEASE let me know <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks <br/>
