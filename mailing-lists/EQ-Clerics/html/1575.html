<div id="ygrps-yiv-1352523413">Befallen is good but it kind of has that dead zone at 9-12 where the first<br/>
level is not giving you much exp and the 2nd floor will get you killed<br/>
pretty quickly.<br/>
<br/>
IIRC, what I did at levels 9-10 was find a warrior my level (what warrior in<br/>
their right mind wouldn&#39;t want to group with a cleric?) and hunt North Ro.<br/>
Scarabs, dune tarantulas, madmen, zombies and mummies abound. The exp bar<br/>
rockets up, and the loot&#39;s not bad either.<br/>
<br/>
Once you get to 12 or so, there&#39;s quite a choice of hunting around the<br/>
Freeport area. Although Freeport itself isn&#39;t a very nice town IMHO. I ended<br/>
up coming back west.<br/>
