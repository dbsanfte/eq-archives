<div id="ygrps-yiv-1739146021">While, for the most part, it is your decision, your *group* has a big say in<br/>
the matter.  I can guarantee you that if you try to be a &quot;melee&quot; cleric at<br/>
high levels (except in easy fights, that is) you will develop a reputation<br/>
and have a *VERY* hard time getting into a good group.  Good groups in EQ<br/>
are the difference between life and death, and are the ability to do things<br/>
far beyond your &quot;normal&quot; level.  If you develop a reputation of not<br/>
utilizing your healing skills to their fullest, you will never been invited<br/>
to a group for the difficult adventures such as fighting Nagafen, or going<br/>
into the Plane of Fear (or any plane, for that matter).  As GZ posted on<br/>
EQVault the other day, groups *expect* the healers to actually HEAL.  We are<br/>
not there to add a measily amount of damage, we are there to<br/>
heal/med/heal/med/heal/med/buff.  Unfortunately, there are far too many<br/>
clerics in the land of Norrath that still believe they can be a tank-healer.<br/>
<br/>
This is not to say, however, that we cannot melee or use our damage spells.<br/>
You just have to learn judicious use of them and balance that with mana<br/>
usage, downtime, group dynamic and difficulty of the fight.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; So far everyone has said that sticking to casting is the way to go. I must<br/>
&gt; say, that is the way I&#39;m going to go. I would willingly give up my weapon<br/>
&gt; for a +9 wis (or so) item. I don&#39;t mind being in a melee, but<br/>
&gt; with a decent<br/>
&gt; sized group, I will stay well away from the mobs so I can stick<br/>
&gt; to what I do<br/>
&gt; best (and enjoy most).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Having said that, I must point out that it is my choice to do<br/>
&gt; that. I&#39;m not<br/>
&gt; doing it because anyone told me to, I do it because it&#39;s how I<br/>
&gt; like to play.<br/>
&gt; Part of the reason I enjoy it so much is because I am able to make that<br/>
&gt; decision. If I had to do it because I wasn&#39;t allowed any choice,<br/>
&gt; it wouldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; be so appealing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; From what you said, it sounds like you really want to go for the<br/>
&gt; melee stats<br/>
&gt; over wisdom. I encourage you to do so, for no other reason than<br/>
&gt; because you<br/>
&gt; want to. This is *your* character, you should play him the way *you* want.<br/>
&gt; Make your decision based on what will get you more enjoyment from<br/>
&gt; the game.<br/>
