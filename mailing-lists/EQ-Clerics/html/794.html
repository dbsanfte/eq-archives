<div id="ygrps-yiv-1320569161">One day i was in Mistmoore fighting a Vampiric Ancille near the zone border.<br/>
Someone was chased to zone by it. So i started casting Wrath on it. I was in<br/>
full group that time. There were some of my group meleeing the critter. And<br/>
some other people too. Then after i had two wraths on it a wizzie came in and<br/>
started blasting it. Needless to say who got the kill... eventhough i did 4<br/>
wraths on it with a total of 800 damage... the wizzie took it. In that case<br/>
the group damage thing would have helped us to get the kill... but well it<br/>
was just one little ancille. These thing don&#39;t happen very often in Mistmoore.<br/>
At least not to me and my group. But i was really puzzled after the fight...<br/>
what the heck... who took my groups kill... i did 800 damage to it... oh a<br/>
wizzie was casting on it... how many hp&#39;s do these critters have?<br/>
