<b>Subject:</b> Re: EQ - worse rpg ever? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-141064240">Oh my oh my oh my!  I have found many many wonderful roleplayers in my<br/>
travels through Norrath!  The funny thing is, I never actually<br/>
roleplayed a day in my life before EQ!  It&#39;s a shame to see you so<br/>
disappointed!  I have learned much and traveled plenty.  I have met<br/>
kewl dudes as well as serious roleplayers.  Where do I stand in all<br/>
this?  Probably right in the middle.  I&#39;m not a &quot;kewl dudette&quot;, yet I<br/>
am not a serious roleplayer (give me a break, i&#39;m just learning the<br/>
ropes).  I enjoy speaking and acting in character as well as out of<br/>
character.  It just depends who I&quot;m grouped with.  I think this game<br/>
(aye, it is a game, draw the line!) is tailored to suit everyone&#39;s<br/>
needs, depending on what those needs are.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt;  Count me out of Everquest. I have played this RPG<br/>
&gt; since it first hit the <br/>
&gt; shelves of my local game store- and I must say; I am<br/>
&gt; quite disappointed to <br/>
&gt; where it has ended up as. <br/>
&gt;  It had great promise, but frankly-  it&#39;s the worse<br/>
&gt; fantasy game i have ever <br/>
&gt; played. As a matter of fact;  THERE IS NO &#39;FANTASY&#39;<br/>
&gt; about it!!!! I had a <br/>
&gt; number of fantastic dreams when I first heard of<br/>
&gt; Everquest- a land where one <br/>
&gt; can travel across lands and dimensions, a true world<br/>
&gt; where you can follow a <br/>
&gt; trail through a path of forest for hours to reach<br/>
&gt; the fabled land of elves- <br/>
&gt; or journey through a dark dungeon where rumors of a<br/>
&gt; powerful sorceror made <br/>
&gt; his home there-, creating monstrosities and twisting<br/>
&gt; creatures and beings to <br/>
&gt; its desire, with people cowering in fear to its<br/>
&gt; name- or journey to an inn <br/>
&gt; within a city, where you meat cut-throats, warriors,<br/>
&gt; magicians of promised <br/>
&gt; power to journey with you to a quest assigned to<br/>
&gt; you- but these dreams have <br/>
&gt; been shattered! Never has any of this happened in<br/>
&gt; the world of Norrath to me. <br/>
&gt;  Playing as a priestess of Tunare, I had great<br/>
&gt; ambitions of journeying and <br/>
&gt; making a mark upon my name as an adventurerer and<br/>
&gt; holy advisor. But I am lost <br/>
&gt; in a world of technicality- noone cares about<br/>
&gt; adventuring or imagination in <br/>
&gt; the world of Norrath. I am lost in a world of<br/>
&gt; levels, fancy weapons, and <br/>
&gt; items. Noone in the world of EQ cares about being in<br/>
&gt; a diffrent world- its <br/>
&gt; only a contest on who can reach the highest level,<br/>
&gt; get the most fanciful <br/>
&gt; weapon, or the the most striking robe. <br/>
&gt;  Try to prove me wrong- I doubt it! Through my<br/>
&gt; months of journeying in the <br/>
&gt; world of Norrath, I HAVE ONLY MET ONE PERSON  that<br/>
&gt; truly tried to roleplay <br/>
&gt; (and i have met many people through different<br/>
&gt; servers) - and even he turned <br/>
&gt; into the &#39;world of mundane unimagination&#39; after a<br/>
&gt; month. Am I wrong? Read <br/>
&gt; this mailing list- what do people talk about on this<br/>
&gt; list? This is what they <br/>
&gt; talk about- <br/>
&gt;    &quot; How can I find the (some generic magic item<br/>
&gt; that everyone else talks <br/>
&gt; about) &quot; <br/>
&gt;    What level is --- (some monster that someone<br/>
&gt; wants to kill to get an item, <br/>
&gt; and camp out til he/she gets it)<br/>
&gt;     Where can I hunt to get to level (a number) -<br/>
&gt;      Etc.... etc....&quot;<br/>
&gt;  Not that any of this is wrong, people are asking<br/>
&gt; for help- but this is all <br/>
&gt; anyone talks about in EQ! ! ! I once belonged to an<br/>
&gt; RPG community and game  <br/>
&gt; where mailing lists were designed to be &#39;in<br/>
&gt; character&#39; , where Mordok the <br/>
&gt; warrior may  share his thoughts about the Golden<br/>
&gt; Dragons Inn, or the Dark <br/>
&gt; Elves gathering a war party to rid the land of<br/>
&gt; people who oppose them, or <br/>
&gt; magicians giving hints to the knowledge of their<br/>
&gt; power through a quest for <br/>
&gt; them (And i thought this was one of the most<br/>
&gt; exciting RPGs until they started <br/>
&gt; charging money per hour to play) - does any of this<br/>
&gt; happen EQ, wheteher <br/>
&gt; through mailing lists or in the game itself?  To<br/>
&gt; believe that EQ made a <br/>
&gt; measly attempt to have people roleplay by coloring<br/>
&gt; their names a different <br/>
&gt; color!? All i get from those people  are male<br/>
&gt; characters asking for my phone <br/>
&gt; number or address (considering I play a female<br/>
&gt; character), or  --- <br/>
&gt;   &quot;How much damage does that spell do?<br/>
&gt;    When will  (the monster) spawn again? <br/>
&gt;     WHat number is your (skill) at? <br/>
&gt;    Whats the stats of your (item) ? <br/>
&gt;   I can&#39;t wait til reach level (#) etc...etc...&quot; <br/>
&gt;     I am not making bones about it- yes, it is great<br/>
&gt; to reach the next level <br/>
&gt; so you can cast a different spell, etc.. to enliven<br/>
&gt; your adventure-  but what <br/>
&gt; does everyone else look for after that? THIS is what<br/>
&gt; - <br/>
&gt;     &quot; I can&#39;t wait to reach the next level!!! &quot; <br/>
&gt;   So what happens when you reach level 100? What are<br/>
&gt; you going to do then, <br/>
&gt; keep fighting monsters til you reach level 101?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;   There is no fiction about EQ. Its not a RPG, its a<br/>
&gt; video game with no <br/>
&gt; imagination. Its a game with promised excitement,<br/>
&gt; yet it will rot (and it is <br/>
&gt; already starting to) from the inside, and will not<br/>
&gt; last long at all. I am <br/>
&gt; quitting my characters, and looking forward to this<br/>
&gt; other game that i saw on <br/>
&gt; the web ( a complicated multi-player text RPG, but<br/>
&gt; not a traditional MUD). I <br/>
&gt; am sure mostl of the people reading this doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; give a damn about anything <br/>
&gt; of what I said -  trash me all you want- I dont<br/>
&gt; care. <br/>
