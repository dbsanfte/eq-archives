<div id="ygrps-yiv-139438998">You don&#39;t even have to hit Mooto, just heal the person that is killing<br/>
him.  They should definitely not have a problem with that!  I think a<br/>
buff works as well.<br/>

&gt;ok i was there a long time  heres what i know-- killing mooto gives ya 20<br/>
&gt;points (something like that) handing in DFB and war beads gives ya a point<br/>
&gt;or two apeice  so from lvl 10 to 14 i killed mootoo and the 2 gobs that<br/>
&gt;spawn with him if i am alone there, also if there are others there who are<br/>
&gt;killing mooto-ask them if ya can hit him once--you also get the faction if<br/>
&gt;ya do that   good luck </span></blockquote></div>
