<div id="ygrps-yiv-1081062963">Ok who is the brains behind this item??<br/>
I was looking through EQitems webpage and happened upon this item.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Polished Mithril Torque AC 7 Int +13, Wis +13 4.0WT  <br/>
Class:Wr,Pl,Rn,Sk,Mn,Bd,Rg   Race:All<br/>
<br/>
Ok let me get this straight Pally,Rangers and SK use wis/int for mana ok i <br/>
think they may be interested in it(honestly all of them are more interested <br/>
in Dex and agi items), It is too damn heavy for a monk to even consider <br/>
wearing and what on gods green earth do Warriors, Bards and Rogues need it <br/>
for. This just boggles my mind.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;bonks herself on the head&gt;<br/>
Does anyone else think this is a good Clr Dru Sha Nec Wiz Enc Mag item? <br/>
Seems Verant does that quite often, giving items to all the classes but the <br/>
one who could benefit from it the most.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;looks around in a confused manner&gt;<br/>
