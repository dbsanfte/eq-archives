<div id="ygrps-yiv-201457941">Hi again,<br/>
<br/>
As this Emameled Black Mace is new to me can you tell me if this is a quest<br/>
item or if it is an item dropped by a certain beast?  I do not know anyone<br/>
with it so I am a bit curious on how to aquire it.<br/>

&gt;First Off i like to say High to all fellow Clerics. Im a 29th Cleric on<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;can use besides all the normal ones and are spells. We all know about the<br/>
&gt;screaming mace, but i would like to Add about the Enamaled Black Mace which<br/>
&gt;i currently have, does 8 damage, 28 speed and magical. Now i can rip some<br/>
&gt;ass with this weapon. Not to mention im doing 198 damage with my new Wrath<br/>
&gt;spell which is a upgrade from Smite. Now i need to stress that you toss the<br/>
&gt;2H weapons and start working on 1H. At high levels you are going to need<br/>
&gt;shields for sure, the more magic resistance you have the safer you will be.<br/>
&gt;Right now i have a mistmoor shield which gives +10 Ac +10 resistance to<br/>
&gt;Magic, Disease & poison. Believe me anyone that has been to Mistmoor knows<br/>
&gt;that you need all the magic Resistance you can get. Not to mention we get<br/>
&gt;buff spells, so currently when im fighting i have 60 resistance and seeing<br/>
&gt;you resist 3 Shock Of Force spells in a row makes you breath a little bit<br/>
&gt;better :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If anyone has any questions about spells or anything give me a shout<br/>
