I think the important thing to remember about the SSOL is that it&#39;s<br/>
a fairly low-level item.  Most clerics will toss it once they get a<br/>
screaming mace, or a BEM, or gem-encrusted scepter.  Because the quest<br/>
doesn&#39;t involves only killing bixies in Rivervale you can do this<br/>
quest at an extremely low level.  I did the blessed oil quest over<br/>
and over again.  It took me about 15 times or more of doing this.  I<br/>
am a high elf, and I think I was apprehensive when I started.  Maybe<br/>
dubious, I don&#39;t remember.  You have to get well into amiably to get<br/>
the quest.<br/>
  Another really good quest that I&#39;m doing now in my spare time is the<br/>
diseased wolf quest.  You can kill rabid wolves and rabid grizzlies<br/>
in Qeynos hills and give the pelts to Priestess Caulria in the UFO.<br/>
I turned in 4 wolf pelts and 1 grizzly pelt, got a plat for the<br/>
grizzly pelt, and &#39;endure disease&#39; a 14th level spell (which you can<br/>
buy for 4 plat, or sell for 6-7 gold).  I turned in these pelts, and<br/>
at 15th level, I got nearly a half a bar of experience.  Not bad<br/>
considering 90% of rabid wolves die with one smite spell.<br/>

&gt;Our guildmaster, who is a paladin, just recently needed to raise his <br/>
&gt;faction<br/>
&gt;with the priests of Life, in order to obtain his soulfire sword.<br/>
&gt;Basically what we did to help raise his faction was:<br/>
&gt;1) killing putrid skellies in South Karana(at Grimrots Camp)<br/>
&gt;2) Turning in diseased animal pelts to the Temple of Life<br/>
&gt;3) Doing the Blessed oil Quest til he turned green<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;These will all raise your faction there. Even I, a person who originally<br/>
&gt;came from the temple of Life, needed to raise my faction in order to do the<br/>
&gt;quest. But to be quite honest, I did the quest simply cause I had never <br/>
&gt;done<br/>
&gt;a quest before, I tried the weapon out like once to see what the effect was<br/>
&gt;and it has sat in the bank ever since.<br/>

&gt;&gt;I keep reading that everyone on here loves to use there SSOL.  I would <br/>
&gt;&gt;like<br/>
&gt;&gt;to get this weapon as well.  I am a human cleric from the Temple of Marr <br/>
&gt;&gt;in<br/>
&gt;&gt;Freeport.  Will i have problems trying to do the quest, or will i be ok?<br/>
&gt;&gt;Just want to make sure, before I make that loooong journy from freeport to<br/>
&gt;&gt;qeynos.  Thanks </span></blockquote></div>
