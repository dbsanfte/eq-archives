<b>Subject:</b> help with cleric armor quests <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-878206050">As you all saw from my rant the other day, I&#39;m one of those insane clerics who realizes that the armor isn&#39;t that great, but still wants to do these awful quests to get it &lt;grins&gt;.    I think I have at least one piece of just about every armor quest now except for the bracers, which ironically is the piece that I want the most.  I have a few questions about the quests that I thought maybe some of you who have done the quests could help me with.<br/>
<br/>
Bracers:  Does anybody know exactly where Zahal and Regis spawn?  I know that Zahal spawns somewhere in NK and Regis in WK... I heard that Zahal spawns somewhere in the NE corner of NK.. but that is as much as I know about either one of them.   How long do I have after killing Zahal to get to where Regis spawns?  Will he have been spawned and killed by another player already by the time i run from Zahal to Regis?<br/>
<br/>
Chestplate:  Does Bilge have a single spawn point, or can he spawn anywhere?  I&#39;ve asked around about this but nobody seems to know where Bilge spawns or who his placeholders are.<br/>
<br/>
Gloves:  Where in befallen does Babbinsbort spawn?  I know somewhere on the 3rd level... but i&#39;m really not very familiar with befallen... not nearly as familiar as I should be as a cleric =)<br/>
<br/>
 Also... about this icon under the water... I tried to get that last night, but unfortunately it wasn&#39;t there when I got to it.   Is there an easy way to get to this spot?  The way I did it was to have somebody cast enduring breath on me and then ran to the first hole in the ice i could find... alas, that hole is quite a ways away and I don&#39;t think I&#39;d have made it without EB.  Is there a closer hole that I was missing?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As for all of the other quests, are there any tricks for making the Galacial Bear, Gull Skytallon, or any of the other rare spawns come out?   Or is it just sit there for days on end praying that the next 8 hour cycle will be the one when they spawn?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for any answers you guys can give me =)<br/>
