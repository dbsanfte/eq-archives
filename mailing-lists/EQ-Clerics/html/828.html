<div id="ygrps-yiv-1416348058">It&#39;s guarded by a lot more than just 2 spectres and I believe that spectres<br/>
are closer to level 40.  It also has a necro or something standing at the<br/>
gate protecting it.  I think that there are already PLENTY of precautions to<br/>
keep low level players out. I don&#39;t know how in the hell that the level 1<br/>
ogres got in there. I tried it just so I could see the planes, and I had SOW<br/>
on a level one Ogre and got toasted by the spectres when I was barely inside<br/>
the cave.<br/>

&gt; I am not flaming you, Azor. I know that you are just the deliverer of the<br/>
&gt; information that was posted.<br/>
&gt; But we are talking about another plane of existence. There should be some<br/>
&gt; serious side-effects for trying to enter a place of this magnitude. From<br/>
&gt; what I hear, this place has some of the rarest items in the game, and<br/>
&gt; god-like creatures roam the land freely. Setting foot in this place should<br/>
&gt; come with some consequence, much less getting close to it. I<br/>
&gt; agree with the<br/>
&gt; gate idea. Also, I thought the passageway to the gate was guarded by 2 35+<br/>
&gt; level spectres? (could be wrong on that)<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve never been near this place, but I don&#39;t think it would be<br/>
&gt; too fun if I<br/>
&gt; could just stroll right in a grab that Cleric-only armor I&#39;ve been hearing<br/>
&gt; about.<br/>
