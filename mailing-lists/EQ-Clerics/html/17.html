<b>Subject:</b> Why do YOU want to be a cleric? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-267111067">Let&#39;s get some content flowing on this list shall we?  Let&#39;s start with why<br/>
you want to be a cleric.<br/>
<br/>
With me it was a simple choice.  I like to be able to help people.  There is<br/>
nothing like coming upon someone locked in a life or death battle and<br/>
swaying the tide to their side.  I don&#39;t do it for any reward other than the<br/>
thank you I receive.  It is good to know that you helped.<br/>
<br/>
I also like the fighting abilities of the Cleric.  Although not as good as<br/>
the Warrior or the Paladin, Clerics can definitely hold their own.<br/>
