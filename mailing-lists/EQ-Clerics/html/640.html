<b>Subject:</b> Re: Meditation change? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-382502739">I know exactly what you mean about the 7th level wait.  I didn&#39;t<br/>
notice the wait so much at 6th, but 7th was really annoying.  I could<br/>
see an argument for moving meditate to 7th, definitely.  I think maybe<br/>
the point is to make you really appreciate the med more by the time<br/>
you get to 8th.  If you got med at 7th you might not really notice<br/>
it&#39;s affects all that much, and would take it for granted.<br/>
  Oh well, 7th is not a particularly long level, and you&#39;ll get med<br/>
soon enough.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had at least a couple of gate experiences... one time I was<br/>
trying to gate to my home point in Felwithe and it said, &quot;The<br/>
destination is currently unstable.&quot;  Still not exactly sure what that<br/>
meant.  Unless someone was standing there at the time or something.<br/>
<br/>
Another time I was being attacked by orc cents and was nearly dead and<br/>
kept trying to gate and it finally worked, and when I showed up at the<br/>
bind point, I was unconcious.  Talk about your close calls.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;I was wondering what the proper procedure was to petition for a change.   I<br/>
&gt;do not know about the rest of you but I feel that clerics should get<br/>
&gt;meditate at six and not have to wait until eight for it.  My seventh level<br/>
&gt;cleric spends a lot of time just sitting waiting for mana for restore.   It<br/>
&gt;is really glaring when you are grouped with spell casters and after the<br/>
&gt;battle you heal them up and then have to sit for five or ten minutes to get<br/>
&gt;your mana back when they are ready to go again in just two or three <br/>
&gt;minutes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Let me know your feelings on this and I will try to get it started if there<br/>
&gt;is enough support and if not then I will just live with it the way it is.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;On a side note a very strange thing happened to me this morning.   I was<br/>
&gt;hunting in Butcherblock and ran out of food.   Rather than making the long<br/>
&gt;run back to Felwithe for more food I decided to gate.   I got a message<br/>
&gt;about that zone being down and that they would put me in a safe place <br/>
&gt;within<br/>
&gt;my zone.   The safe place ended up just outside the dwarf city and I was<br/>
&gt;near the GF zone point, but that is not the problem.   Everything except<br/>
&gt;keyboard locked up tight.   I could not use my mouse to do anything at all.<br/>
&gt;No casting, no sitting, no selling or buying and worst of all no camping to<br/>
&gt;escape that mess and of course no GM&#39;s or Guides around.   I could not even<br/>
&gt;do a soft boot to escape and ended up doing a hard re-boot.     I suppose<br/>
&gt;that maybe I could have tried to get back to the GF zone point and try to<br/>
&gt;zone out to see if that cleared it up but my defensive spells were about to<br/>
&gt;wear off and I could not refresh them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks all for listening to my rantings,<br/>
