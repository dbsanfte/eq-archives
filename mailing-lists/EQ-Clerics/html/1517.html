<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-863912098">I read on another e-mail list that on the test server they have done it once<br/>
again and they are now changing rez spells.  This is what I&#39;ve read.<br/>
<br/>
Corpses that are older than 2 hours cannot be resurrected.<br/>
Corpses that are produced from a duel cannot be resurrected after 10<br/>
minutes.<br/>
<br/>
I wish Verant would just leave things alone and fix the things that need<br/>
fixed like Plan of Fear, Rogues and things like that and stop making classes<br/>
weaker.<br/>
