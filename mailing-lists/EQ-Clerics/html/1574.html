<div id="ygrps-yiv-2138712719">I really believe Verant is making things harder for the players cause a lot<br/>
of ppl hit Lvl 50 to fast and were killing things they shouldn&#39;t be killing<br/>
this soon in the game (Lady Vox).  I remember reading once on EQVault that<br/>
Brad didn&#39;t seem to happy with the power gamers.  Can&#39;t remember all he said<br/>
but I know he didn&#39;t see why anyone would want to play EQ like that, said<br/>
how if he did he&#39;d get bored of it fast, also talked about ppl hitting Lvl<br/>
50 in just a few months when it should&#39;ve taken them at least a year.  Cause<br/>
if you notice what are they changing all the time?  High lvl spells, high<br/>
lvl zones and it&#39;s not for the better but to make it harder on the players<br/>
so they can&#39;t get lvls as fast as they once did.<br/>
Just like that rumor that they might be making it to where if you heal<br/>
someone it might not even work.  If they do that then whats the point in<br/>
being a Cleric if we can&#39;t heal a party member thats in trouble?<br/>
If Verant thinks the game is so unbalanced now, then why did they release it<br/>
this way?  Why not have waited a few extra months and fix the classes?  I<br/>
think they did believe it was well balanced but when players start whinning<br/>
that their class isn&#39;t as good as the next then instade of making them a bit<br/>
better, that other class gets punished for it and get their spells weakened,<br/>
or where they may or may not work on another player.<br/>
Well thats enough outta me for now.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I couldn&#39;t agree more,  Azor.  Verant seems totally preoccupied with<br/>
&gt; discovering and fixing ways players have found to make the game more<br/>
&gt; playable, rather than looking for positive changes that should be made to<br/>
&gt; improve both the classes and the game, itself.  It seems all they focus on<br/>
&gt; is how to make things harder on the players.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Why DON&#39;T they fix Fear Plane, or do something to improve the gosh awful<br/>
&gt; camping that is going on every single place where a decent item is found.<br/>
&gt; Last weekend, we (our level 50s) went to like 7 different places to try<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; obtain items for some of us that didn&#39;t have them.  This was at 10am EDT<br/>
 </span></blockquote>on<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; a Sunday morning.  Every single last place was camped and the lower level<br/>
&gt; groups that were there told us they would be there all day and nite.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Since<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; there was really nothing else for us to do, (can&#39;t go to Fear and noone<br/>
&gt; needs exp anymore)  we all simply logged and went about doing  RL things<br/>
&gt; outside of EQ.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Verant needs to wake up to the fact that their high level players are<br/>
&gt; getting fed up and bored, and THAT&#39;s why they are leaving and/or selling<br/>
&gt; their characters on ebay and looking for new games.<br/>
