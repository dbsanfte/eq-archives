&gt; it IS the point....you look at it as discrimination.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hi, Ralph.  I *do* agree with you, that this is a step to make the game<br/>
more fair for those who don&#39;t powerlevel and run up their characters.<br/>
And I do think Mikaela (Hi, Mik!) is, for lack of a better term,<br/>
misrepresenting the case of the higher-levels.  There is no easy<br/>
solution to the case of higher-levels bullying their way into an area,<br/>
and Verant is simply trying to come up with a solution that, if unfair,<br/>
is at least the least unfair of solutions.<br/>

&gt; that Verant goes and codes in &quot;green cons give SQUAT&quot; so you all can shut up<br/>
&gt; and leave, or stay and play and stop whining.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ralph, we&#39;re all on this list because we in theory enjoy the game, and<br/>
enjoy playing clerics; I understand that you might be frustrated that<br/>
someone disagrees with you - it&#39;s always a shock to have someone just<br/>
come out and say &quot;you&#39;re wrong in my lights &#39;cause of ...&quot;.  But that&#39;s<br/>
no reason to be petulant.  Take a deep breath and remember that we are<br/>
basically here to have fun; snapping at people who have no real impact<br/>
on the code of the game only serves to heighten tensions.<br/>
<br/>
Smile.  Have fun.  Go heal a newbie with Greater Heal and watch their<br/>
eyes light up. =) <br/>
