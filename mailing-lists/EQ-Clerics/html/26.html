<b>Subject:</b> 14 lvl spells <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-950076477">Hello all, <br/>
I just made 14 recently and wonder if you can help me out with spells.<br/>
<br/>
Any recommendations for 14 lvl spells beside heal and bind?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been thinking about Halo of Light because I hate the dark but<br/>
I dont want to spend 7pp on something that a lantern does. Does it really<br/>
help to see around you when your in the dark or is just in the immediate radius?<br/>
<br/>
Can you explain how cancel magic works? Does it remove the negative effects <br/>
of spells on people?<br/>
<br/>
How much HP does Symbol of Transal add and what item do you need for it?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Endure Cold and Endure Disease spells seem pretty useless to me.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for help,<br/>
David Willis</div>
