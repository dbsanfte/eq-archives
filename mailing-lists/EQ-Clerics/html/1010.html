&gt; I would definitely go with the stat increasing items.  In my experiences<br/>
&gt; with the game, this is what I have found.  A cleric will never be a tank and<br/>
&gt; yes you will get hit, Mobs tend to dislike clerics when they heal, do DD or<br/>
&gt; Stun, so AC is a good thing to have but Mana is king for a cleric, In my<br/>
&gt; opinion.  AC will in no way, shape or form save your life. </span></blockquote></div>
