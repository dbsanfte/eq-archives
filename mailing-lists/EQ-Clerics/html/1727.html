<div id="ygrps-yiv-1683857221">The temple of Sol Ro is the tunnel that is on the opposite side of the lava<br/>
pit from the entrances to Sol A and Nagafen&#39;s Lair.  It is indeed in<br/>
Lavastorm.  I think you are thinking of Paineel which is a city of necros<br/>
that will be in off of the Tox Forrest.  The Hole is another zone that is<br/>
coming and will be located off of Paineel.<br/>

&gt; Hmmm... I heard Temple of Solusek Ro was going to be adjacent to Tox zone,<br/>
&gt; on Odus... can anyone confirm which is correct?<br/>
