&gt; Divine ain&#39;t that good guys. It might save you once or twice, but It lasts for<br/>
&gt; about 5 seconds and runs off. I think Gate would be better. Just root the thing<br/>
&gt; and Gate out of there. I would do that. But if u are good in the first place u<br/>
&gt; won&#39;t need any of em. hehe :)<br/>

&quot;Divine ain&#39;t that good&quot;  pff..  I&#39;d like to see you root 3 festering<br/>
hangs and gate out alive.  You&#39;ll NEVER do it.  However.. one divine<br/>
aura and you&#39;ve escaped all of them without the least bit of<br/>
difficulty.</div>
