<div id="ygrps-yiv-1769137540">I would like to say that you were no where off topic, that is exactly what I was talking about. I was confused because a lot of my friends beg and ask while I myself at lower levels give away extra weapons and PW I earn during the bone chip quest. It&#39;s not much but to me it is since that is all I can do. I don&#39;t normally give stuff to people who are asking, usually to others what feel like talking.</div>
