<div id="ygrps-yiv-653568313"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Does anyone have any tips for solo-ing in Unrest?  I was there last<br/>
&gt;night on the test server.  I&#39;m a bar away from 21.  I start out in a<br/>
&gt;small group.  On the test server, there are around 15 people max in<br/>
&gt;Unrest at any given time.  So most people either skirt the outside,<br/>
&gt;or camp the front yard, and have someone pull from the house.  We<br/>
&gt;were pulling from the house, and the place was like grand central<br/>
&gt;station.<br/>
&gt;  The best time I&#39;d ever had in Unrest was when we had a 30+ level<br/>
&gt;druid in wolf form pulling for us.  We took out the entire second<br/>
&gt;floor without any problems.  But if the person pulling is low enough<br/>
&gt;level, they get way more than they bargained for.<br/>
&gt;  Well, I had to leave for a bit, and when I came back, the group was<br/>
&gt;full, so I decided to solo.  I cast invis to undead on myself, and I<br/>
&gt;would pull a ghoul, or a DB from the first floor.  The ghouls were<br/>
&gt;usually blue, sometimes green, but I always got xp for them.  The<br/>
&gt;Lurking mummys were tough, but I could solo those, but usually if I<br/>
&gt;/yelled for help.  But I tried to stick with ghouls and DBs.<br/>
&gt;  I figured that I could mem calm and calm extras, and would just be<br/>
&gt;able to pull one mob at a time.  I got nearly half a bar solo-ing, and<br/>
&gt;it worked pretty well. I ended up dying 3 times last night though,<br/>
&gt;from other peoples trains, and I ended up with slightly less xp than<br/>
&gt;when I started.  Anyone have any good advice for solo-ing this place?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Unrest is VERY easy to solo if you&#39;re a cleric and can provide some great<br/>
experience.  My lvl 22 halfling cleric has been soloing there since lvl 14<br/>
and the experience is great.  I would honestly tell you to start killing dry<br/>
bones on the 2nd floor or stick to lurking mummies.  Dark bones and ghouls<br/>
don&#39;t give near the experience they used to for someone of your lvl.<br/>
Lurking mummies sometimes con even to a lvl 21 if i remember correctly which<br/>
is always good experience, and the dry bones will almost always be yellow or<br/>
the occasional white.  Either way they both give great experience, and if<br/>
you have a decent character you will be able to solo each of them without<br/>
any trouble.  You can also solo carr ghouls now, but there is about a 30%<br/>
chance of ya having to make a run for the zone if things go bad with these<br/>
guys.  No.. I&#39;m not lieing to ya as many people on this list will say.  A<br/>
cleric of your lvl CAN solo yellow and *low* red undead.  Yellow are very<br/>
easy though and the exp bar will shoot up.<br/>
