<div id="ygrps-yiv-601419497">As a &quot;test veteran&quot;, I can account for *some* of this.  I do not know<br/>
about the incident last night (wasn&#39;t online, myself), but this<br/>
happened once before, and I had friends that were wiped clean.  A<br/>
friend of mine had two characters impacted.  One was restored, and<br/>
another (a 16th level ranger) lost all his items, which he had to<br/>
rebuild.  I met a guy on there one day that got restored, and lost<br/>
8 levels (powergamed his way to 12th, and started back at 4th).  I<br/>
know a high level Erudite cleric that had his character competely<br/>
removed, but he did finally get it restored.<br/>
  I have played on test since June, and haven&#39;t had any problems.<br/>
I&#39;ve never lost anything.<br/>
<br/>
  And I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d call 450 people during peak time &quot;overcrowded&quot;.<br/>
:)  Certainly, when I started, the population was not quite over 200,<br/>
so it has grown quite a bit.  I suspect the newbie areas are more<br/>
populated than higher-level hunting grounds.  I&#39;ve been the only guy<br/>
in Cazic Thule and Unrest before, at certain times.  I could go into<br/>
upper guk on any evening, however, and be the only one there.  And<br/>
there are some advantages to the test server - the people are by far<br/>
friendlier than on any server (imho), and we also get to test out new<br/>
things before anyone else.  Race war; Hate plane (I&#39;m too low for that<br/>
of course); the new SplitPaw; Solusek Ro, etc, etc.<br/>
<br/>
  In fact, when I logged onto Fennin Ro Friday night to participate in<br/>
the sit-in, I had to download 25 minutes worth of old patches.  :(<br/>
And, of course, when I went back to Test, I had to download 25 minutes<br/>
worth of the new stuff.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Just so that everyone knows, playing on the Test Server does has its<br/>
&gt;pitfall.  For instance, just last night, everyone came back after a server<br/>
&gt;dump and everyone lost one item or another.  A lvl 38 druid friend of mine<br/>
&gt;lost everything she was wearing.  Most ppl either lost stuff in their<br/>
&gt;inventory, person, bank account, or ALL.  From what I understand from<br/>
&gt;talking to Test Server veterans who has been there over 4 months, this<br/>
&gt;occurs quit often and from the last time, they either didnt get their items<br/>
&gt;replace or didnt get all of them replace.  Basically, he says that he had <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;restart with the items twice.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Other things that can go wrong on Test is that some skills can get screw up<br/>
&gt;and not fix for quit awhile....for instance, druid&#39;s tracking.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also, it seems that more and more ppl are now coming over to Test...its<br/>
&gt;beginning to become just as crowded as a production server...so I don&#39;t <br/>
&gt;know<br/>
&gt;if there will be as much advantages over the regular server.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Just thought to let u guys know.<br/>
