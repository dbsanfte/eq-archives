<div id="ygrps-yiv-1220104738">What I&#39;ve found to be the (unfortunate, imho) case of late in Unrest, is<br/>
that it&#39;s safest to kill inside the house.  The major downside to this, at<br/>
least in my case, is the major lag I pick up just by stepping inside the<br/>
house.  It&#39;s pretty much gotten to the point that when I&#39;ve seen it the<br/>
safest in Unrest is when there are groups camping the tower, the barroom,<br/>
the reclusive ghoul magi room, and some lower level groups in the room at<br/>
the side door and the back door room.  The pathing in Unrest is so buggy<br/>
that if you try to pull something to the outside, chances are that the rest<br/>
of the house is going to come with it.  That&#39;s half the reason I moved over<br/>
to Mistmoore once I hit lv 21.<br/>

&gt; I was at Unrest at lvl 23 with a full group including a 2nd cleric.  The<br/>
&gt; place was horrible.  Death after death after death.  Between deaths and<br/>
&gt; running to the zone there were no points made.  The only time we were<br/>
there<br/>
&gt; successfully was in a room (hand room) i think.  Then shortly a high lvl<br/>
&gt; cleric came in and ran us out....i am now almost lvl 27 and haven&#39;t been<br/>
&gt; back yet.  I may try to go back soon though...<br/>

&gt; &gt;I have heard from many many people that unrest is a great place for a<br/>
&gt; &gt;cleric<br/>
&gt; &gt;to go starting around 14 or so.  I am 17th (almost 18th) and am having<br/>
&gt; &gt;serious trouble there.  Last night 6 people from my guild were there, all<br/>
&gt; &gt;15-20 and we had a rough time.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;We were at the back wall pulling from the back door.  We had SoW and<br/>
invis<br/>
&gt; &gt;to undead on the puller at all times, but there were many times where she<br/>
&gt; &gt;ended up bringing quite a few too many ghouls.  (tried to pull 1 and<br/>
&gt; &gt;suddenly there were 7 of them on us!)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Are we hunting at too high a level, or are we pulling from the wrong<br/>
place?<br/>
&gt; &gt;Or do we just suck?  We only had 2 deaths last night, but many many many<br/>
&gt; &gt;close calls.  Lets just say thank god our druid was also saving 50% mana<br/>
&gt; &gt;for<br/>
&gt; &gt;heals.<br/>
