<b>Subject:</b> Can clerics really use the Brutechopper? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-223734040">There is a 2H slashing weapon called the Brutechopper. Stats 16 damage, 50<br/>
delay, and hits with magical damage. It&#39;s the fruit of a Troll quest (I<br/>
don&#39;t know the details), but if you are not a troll, it can be sometimes be<br/>
purchased from other players for around 200 pp. It can be used by large<br/>
races. I have played with an ogre who used one with great effectiveness.<br/>
<br/>
Now here&#39;s the odd thing: the weapon info on www.gameznet.com/eq states that<br/>
it can be used by &#39;priest&#39; classes, including dwarves. I assume that by<br/>
&#39;priest&#39; they mean clerics, as there are no druids among the dwarves. Unless<br/>
they are thinking of paladins?<br/>
<br/>
Can this be true? This is a two-handed axe thingie, 2H slashing. There is no<br/>
other slashing weapon I know of that clerics can use. Plus, how do you train<br/>
in 2H slashing skill? As far as I know, no cleric guildmaster is able to<br/>
train that! Don&#39;t you have to put a skill point into it before your skill<br/>
will rise?<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have any information on this weapon? Has anyone used it, as a<br/>
cleric?<br/>
<br/>
Not sure I would want to use it, it&#39;s only minimally better than a glowing<br/>
wooden crook staff, which can be had for substantially less money, but<br/>
still, I&#39;m curious as to whether it is actually usable by clerics.<br/>

mace, and looking desperately for a Bracer of Battle. Heeeeer, Warlord, come<br/>
here, little guy, the kindly old dwarf won&#39;t hurt you!</div>
