<div id="ygrps-yiv-1186584238"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;always the last one to zone and usually do the most<br/>
&gt;dying.  But, that&#39;s my job.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I must disagree here. Even though we are healers our play time is as much <br/>
worth as any other player&#39;s playtime. Personally I won&#39;t throw myself in <br/>
front of a running giant to save someone else (literally). If I were a <br/>
paladin or good cleric maybe I could do that but only from a roleplaying <br/>
point of view. A cleric of Innoruuk should probably conclude that whoever <br/>
dies was not fit to serve Innoruuk anyway. And it can be tactically <br/>
motivated to stay alive so that you can ressurrect the others.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunetaly there are instances when we have to choose between saving the <br/>
tank and ourselves. One example is when the tank is being beaten down by a <br/>
train. As you all know healing that tank will result in an instant <br/>
train-takeover that results in our death. On one single occation this has <br/>
happened to me, and I chose not to heal the tank since I knew I would die. <br/>
We evaced instead and everyone made it out. I&#39;m interested in other views <br/>
on this matter.<br/>
