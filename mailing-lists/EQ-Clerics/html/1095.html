All you have  to do is cast stun/ and the best offensive spell at your<br/>
level.<br/>
<br/>
What i typically do is stun the chaster, then run behind them quickly at<br/>
an angle, then start nuking them.   When they unstun they take some time<br/>
to turn around to look for you, when you notice this, stun them again.<br/>
<br/>
It really works well.  I havent dueled too much but i&#39;m 9 and 1 vs casters<br/>
in duels.<br/>

&gt; I have a few thoughts on PvP and clerics. I play a cleric on Vallon Zek and <br/>
&gt; occationally battle other players. In my experience, clerics are not good <br/>
&gt; offensively, but rather good defensively, especially grouped.<br/>
&gt; Once a necromancer cast dots on me (engulfing darkness and boil blood I <br/>
&gt; believe), plus fear. I dropped HPs rapidly, but managed to cast a couple of <br/>
&gt; heals on myself, and then the DOTs wore off.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Can clerics generally survive a fight versus casters by healing themselves? <br/>
&gt; If I cast 4 greater heals on myself I can heal for 1200+ damage. Although I <br/>
&gt; am not sure, I doubt a wizard will have the mana to deliver 2000 damage at <br/>
&gt; my level (24), and some of his damage might be resisted. Assuming I have <br/>
&gt; full armour, I should be able to root and melee the caster to death.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Other useful spells are blindness and stun. I use the low level variants of <br/>
&gt; stun since they take less mana. Divine aura is useful since the attacker <br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t always observe that I am invulnerable, especially casters, since <br/>
&gt; they don&#39;t get any damage information (=&quot;blabla hit by non melee for 140 <br/>
&gt; damage&quot; etc).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Buying an egg shaped pumice is also a good investment, although it is quite <br/>
&gt; expensive. It is a magic item sold by some vendors (in Neriak, the one near <br/>
&gt; the bank) and has 5 charges of &quot;pillage enchantment&quot;, that will cancel <br/>
&gt; several effects like charm/DOTs (and buffs) at the same time.<br/>
