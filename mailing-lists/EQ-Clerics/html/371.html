&gt; <br/>
&gt; Huh? I seriously doubt this, unless a level 30 wizard is stealing from<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; level 15 group. That doesn&#39;t happen much, because high level people<br/>
&gt; aren&#39;t<br/>
&gt; interested in low level loot. You don&#39;t see level 30&#39;s, or even level<br/>
&gt; 20&#39;s,<br/>
&gt; camping for mino axes or bronze weapons, for example, even though they<br/>
&gt; could<br/>
&gt; easily steal them from the level 8&#39;s to 15&#39;s who want them. The<br/>
&gt; problem lies<br/>
&gt; with with wizards, and sometimes mages and clerics, stealing from<br/>
&gt; groups of<br/>
&gt; about their own level. A simple code change could fix this problem.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Heck, even if you have a wizard of the same level in your group, your<br/>
&gt; kill<br/>
&gt; will be stolen if he gets in one fewer shots, or if his spells get<br/>
&gt; resisted<br/>
&gt; for a point or two more than the killstealer&#39;s, no matter HOW much<br/>
&gt; damage<br/>
&gt; everyone else in the group combined does. That is really bad design.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Another change that could help is to let everyone know how much damage<br/>
&gt; is<br/>
&gt; being done by spellcasters. I don&#39;t understand why everyone can see<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; damage done by every blow by the tanks, but only the spellcaster<br/>
&gt; himself can<br/>
&gt; see his own damage report. If I could see the damage being inflicted<br/>
&gt; by a<br/>
&gt; killstealer, I might throw in a few offensive spells to try to stop it<br/>
&gt; --<br/>
&gt; which I usually don&#39;t, saving most of my mana for healing -- but as of<br/>
&gt; now,<br/>
&gt; I have no idea how much damage is being done, and can&#39;t intervene<br/>
&gt; effectively. &#39;So-and-so begins to cast a spell&#39; just gets lost in all<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; battle clutter.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Heck, even if you have wizard in your group, he can&#39;t know how much<br/>
&gt; damage<br/>
&gt; is being done by the killstealer and adjust his casts to try to<br/>
&gt; counter it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is a very dumb situation, and I don&#39;t understand why Verant has<br/>
&gt; let it<br/>
&gt; continue.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Even if they made it so a groups combined damage was taken into<br/>
&gt; &gt;consideration solo wizards would still get the kill credit.  They can<br/>
&gt; do<br/>
&gt; &gt;so much damage per spell that there really isn&#39;t enough HP left on a<br/>
&gt; mob<br/>
&gt; &gt;for  a group total to be more.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Verants choice of whoever does the most damage vs. group damage,<br/>
&gt; makes<br/>
&gt; &gt;no difference.<br/>
