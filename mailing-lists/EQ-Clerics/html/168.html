<div id="ygrps-yiv-280588881">Hey people... Can we have a civil discussion here?  I dont want to see<br/>
everyone get slammed here.  We all play the same class and some people fight<br/>
different then other people.  Depending on what server/race/friends you are<br/>
with.  Lets keep it clean :P<br/>

lighten up.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps the situations he gets involoved in, are mainly single oponents,<br/>
with slower attacks, and hence gate is a better option.  If those 3<br/>
festering hags you were talking about were away from a zone border, you<br/>
probably still wouldnt make it out alive. Even with Divine.<br/>
