<div id="ygrps-yiv-510991270">Aradune doesn&#39;t wield a Soul Fire...he has the Fiery<br/>
Avenger, which, althought the stats have never really<br/>
bee seen, can apparently be used by a ranger.<br/>

&gt; www.eqvault.com it was a pic of<br/>
&gt; Brad&#39;s character dead.  It wasn&#39;t the being dead<br/>
&gt; part I couldn&#39;t believe but<br/>
&gt; what it was he had in his hand.  Now remember his<br/>
&gt; character is a Ranger, pic<br/>
&gt; shows him wearing the new Ranger armor but in his<br/>
&gt; hand was the SoulFire<br/>
&gt; which is a Pally only weapon.  Can we say cheating? <br/>
&gt; Now if one of us tried<br/>
&gt; that crap we&#39;d get banned from the game but he can<br/>
&gt; wield a Pally only weapon<br/>
&gt; when he&#39;s a Ranger?<br/>
&gt; That shows me the ppl like Brad and GM can get away<br/>
&gt; with anything in the<br/>
&gt; game.  I also read on the EQ newsgroup that last<br/>
&gt; Sunday the night of the<br/>
&gt; events that the GM&#39;s were doing things that they&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; told players not to do<br/>
&gt; and if they did they&#39;d get banned for it.  Heard<br/>
&gt; they were camping at zone<br/>
&gt; points waiting for a player to zone over and kill<br/>
&gt; them and also camping<br/>
&gt; binding points and killing someone over and over<br/>
&gt; everytime he/she died and<br/>
&gt; came back at their bind point till they got ticked<br/>
&gt; and pulled the plug on<br/>
&gt; their modems.  If we would do that junk we&#39;d get<br/>
&gt; banned for it.<br/>
&gt; Can&#39;t wait to hear what Brad has to say about him<br/>
&gt; wielding a SoulFire.<br/>
