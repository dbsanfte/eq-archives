<div id="ygrps-yiv-1023949720">this is where you are WRONG.  Lag in the game can be defined by 2<br/>
things.....both effecting your speed:  a)  data rate to you for varying<br/>
objects anf their placement (eg - corpses, monsters etc)  <br/>
b)  Your system&#39;s speed and ability to deal with the &quot;pre-defined&quot; images<br/>
you have.  Example:  3dfx is fill limited to like 1833 textures (some ODD<br/>
number like that)  when more than that is there....your system goes NUTS<br/>
swapping in and out....  as it is....if more than 20 people and monsters are<br/>
on your screen....fighting....casting spells etc...your system is gonna go<br/>
nuts trying to keep up.  and it does.  You get sometimes 1-2 fps (frames per<br/>
second) which appears to be lag.<br/>

These things don&#39;t increase lag.  Think about it.  The game world is<br/>
completely pre-defined.  The server doesn&#39;t send you any information<br/>
about what the trees, buildings or scenery looks like.  All the<br/>
server sends is information about what the monsters are doing, what<br/>
the people are doing, any messages, and if there are any corpses or<br/>
equipment laying on the ground anywhere.  That is, things that are<br/>
not part of the static world.  You have a CD, that CD stores the<br/>
pre-defined world.<br/>
  I could see where corpses would increase lag because that<br/>
information would need to be sent to you.  A lot of people in a zone,<br/>
and a lot of monsters running aggro.  All these things would do it.<br/>
Faydark does not take longer to load than North Ro.<br/>

&gt;Of course they increase lag.<br/>
&gt;A higher Polygon count and texture count, means slowwer redraw more<br/>
&gt;texture and memory swapping. Plus more mathematical calculations.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I have heard that stationary non moving objects do not increase lag, If <br/>
&gt;that<br/>
&gt; &gt; were the cas than all the trees , rocks, buildings, and whatever else <br/>
&gt;that<br/>
&gt; &gt; may be in zone would increase lag too IMO.<br/>
