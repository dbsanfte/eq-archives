<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1689302145">I have heard several descriptions for it but the most common is when <br/>
you give your low lvl Char equip or money from your higher lvl char.  Like a <br/>
lvl 2 Cleric with full chainmail you know has been twinked.<br/>
<br/>
	Kiting is when that Druid (or other caster with a DOT spell) casts it <br/>
on a monster and then runs, casts, runs,ect .. till the monster is dead.</div>
