Subject: [EQ-Clerics] Make unique Items part of a quest<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; HEY! You&#39;re absolutely right. And I have an idea. First, improve EQ&#39;s<br/>
&gt; quest elements,  then make unique items like journeyman boots quest<br/>
&gt; items. VERY DIFFICULT items could be part of a VERY DIFFICULT quest, but<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s ok, cause there would be no camping, no kill stealing, and you<br/>
&gt; would be doing a lot more exploring and getting experience while doing<br/>
&gt; it. And, I think, you&#39;d be having a lot more fun using your brain than<br/>
&gt; using the /gesture command (after that 35th level wizard just stole your<br/>
&gt; kill for the 3rd time in the same day). What do you think? I mean, isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; that why they call it EVERquest?<br/>
<br/>
To add to that have the person that you get the quest from have like 5<br/>
different ways to complete the quest then it would defiantly help reduce the<br/>
camping for sparse items.<br/>
What I mean by 5 different ways is for example: You must go out and find me<br/>
a bat head, a ruby, a dog leg, a lion hide, or a bear claw! Then when you<br/>
bring him one of those things it leads you to the next step of the quest. Ok<br/>
now go bring me some milk, water, or alcohol! And so on and so on. You get<br/>
my point! I think that would help to keep people from going searching the<br/>
same thing it would spread out what people were looking for to complete the<br/>
quest.<br/>
<br/>
All components in this test quest are made up and not real in anyway. The<br/>
names have been change to protect the innocent. Thanks!<br/>
