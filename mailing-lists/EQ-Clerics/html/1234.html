<div id="ygrps-yiv-1212360259">My lord, I heard about this game and how good it was (something about use to<br/>
be a test RPG on AOL) but now that they are making it with graphics and<br/>
gonna have it on a CD it might be nice to have.  But anyways I went to<br/>
www.neverwinternights.net and read about it and it sounds like it might be<br/>
the RPG of all RPG&#39;s, you can be a GM type guy and control monsters,<br/>
wildlife and even NPC&#39;s.  The only thing that might suck is only 20 lvls but<br/>
as they said in AD&D lvl 20 is a force to be reckoned with and reaching such<br/>
a level is quite the achievement.  You can import characters from the BIG<br/>
hit Baldur&#39;s Gate.<br/>
And yes no monthly fee&#39;s and you can even play NWN in a single game.  Hope<br/>
the servers will be good and not all messed up like most free online games.<br/>
But anyways this will be a game I try!!<br/>

&gt; Come winter of 2000 I will be playing Never Winter Nights.<br/>
&gt; www.neverwinternight.net (or .com)<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s a DM-able Baldur&#39;s Gate style game that is fully customizable by<br/>
&gt; the host DM.  It&#39;s gonna blow EQ away in terms of flexibility and<br/>
&gt; playability.  Once this game comes out, I will never play EQ again. </span></blockquote></div>
