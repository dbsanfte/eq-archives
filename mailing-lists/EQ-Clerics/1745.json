I think the general<br/>\nconsensus is that it&#39;s whatever you want.  There are some very good<br/>\n2hb weapons, but you sacrifice not having a shield.  I think a lot of<br/>\nhigh level clerics really like having a mace in 1 hand, and either<br/>\na paw of opallo or testament in the other, or maybe a nice shield,<br/>\ncharred guardian, or shiny brass, or whathaveyou.  Personally, I used<br/>\n1 handed blunt all the way to around 12-13th level when I switched to<br/>\na bloodforge hammer, which I still use at 17th.  In fact just last<br/>\nnight my 2hb skill surpassed my 1hb skill at 54 vs. 53 (max is 72) so<br/>\nboth of them are suffering a bit due to my switching.  I figure at<br/>\nsome point I will dump some skill points into these to raise them a<br/>\nbit, since they increase so slowly.<br/>\n  I figure that around 20th I will go get a screaming mace, and I will<br/>\ndo the testament of venear quest, which I will hold in my off hand.<br/>\n<br/>\nTunare be with you<br/>\nErgo, 17th level high elf cleric - test<br/>\nGuildmaster - Hand of Tunare<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Patrick Trant &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lordniomar@...\">lordniomar@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hail my friends.  I am new to the clerical ranks and<br/>\n&gt;had a question about weapons.  I&#39;ve read a few guides<br/>\n&gt;though there seems to be some conflict on weapons.<br/>\n&gt;Some guides say one-handed blunt, another say<br/>\n&gt;two-handed blunt, and lastly, some say both.  I would<br/>\n&gt;just like to know what everyone else thinks on the<br/>\n&gt;subject.  Any other tips (as in armor, spells,<br/>\n&gt;hunting, etc) for a young dwarven clerics (lvl4) would<br/>\n&gt;be great too.  Thanks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Niomar, Dwarven Cleric of Xegony<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;P.S.  There be any good cleric websites with like<br/>\n&gt;clerial weapons and stragies and very descriptive<br/>\n&gt;spell definitions (like eq.castersrealm.com but for<br/>\n&gt;clerics? ::duck::).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;=====<br/>\n&gt;&lt;&lt; text3.html &gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
