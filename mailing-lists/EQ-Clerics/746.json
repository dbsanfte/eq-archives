Someone<br/>\n&gt; mentioned that it could be done in 10 game days.  Others believed<br/>\n&gt; that that would be nearly impossible.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  Hmmh well, I am a powergamer (I like it to optimize things to their full<br/>\nextent). I have a character on a mud with which I made top player in 1week<br/>\n1day, while the others below me were over 3weeks of age. Mind you,<br/>\nmost players in that mud were powerplayers, it was no chat/roleplay<br/>\nmud. After initial adjustation to the graphical setting, navigating,<br/>\ngeneral usage of everything etc., one 14th char on Erollisi Marr<br/>\n(under 5days), general fooling around with a few classes that<br/>\nsounded interesting I finally started on the fresh Quellious with my main<br/>\nchar of now. At the moment, I am 22nd level with under 5days<br/>\nof age. And this also includes probably at least closer to day of<br/>\nexploring and general fooling around with new places. Also,<br/>\nI am quite sure I could shave quite a bit of time from the progress<br/>\nif I started again. Exp gathered in groups instead of soloing<br/>\nis probably under 10%. And no twinking (how could I? =)),<br/>\nno guild help (haven&#39;t got any) and solo most of the time.<br/>\nBeen to Cazic, Unrest, Perma, visited Mistmoore, CBone<br/>\nBBurrow. Been in all 3 continents, but mostly on Antonica.<br/>\nI just hate Faydwer =) And class was bard, not necro or<br/>\nmagician or druid, the so-called powergamer classes.<br/>\nHaven&#39;t tried any of those btw, so don&#39;t know for sure if I<br/>\ncould optimize them to go any faster. I seriously doubt<br/>\nthat any class can level 14-20 faster than a bard though.<br/>\n<br/>\n  After the rambling if you are still reading, I can just say that<br/>\nif you are _twinking_ a character, I would guess the time it<br/>\ntakes to go to 20th level is (take calculator) ... I would<br/>\nguestimate under 2days of played time. Calculating in also<br/>\nguild help power-leveling. Probably closer to 1d than 2d.<br/>\nDon&#39;t like the figures, blame someone else than me =)<br/>\nAnd if some guild has actually powerleveled a guy to 20th<br/>\nand resulted with longer time than 2days, that guild needs<br/>\nsomeone able to powerplay ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n    - Ilkka Salmenkaita, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:isalmen@...\">isalmen@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving difficulty getting &quot;in synch&quot; with list members? <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nTry ONElist&#39;s Shared Calendar to organize events, meetings and more!<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
