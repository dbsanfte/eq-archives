You turn the rabid pelts<br/>\n&gt;into the Temple of  Life for fraction and experience. I always tried for <br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;bears as you get good experience and a spell that if you can not use you <br/>\n&gt;can<br/>\n&gt;sell it. Just be careful you do not run into Holly or the Ranger who will <br/>\n&gt;kill<br/>\n&gt;you, even though  you are getting rid of the diseased population.<br/>\n&gt;My fraction problem was the opposite in Rivervale and I had to spend a lot <br/>\n&gt;of<br/>\n&gt;time building up my fraction there by doing quests.

I am a 16th level Hafling cleric of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Bristlebane.  The problem, I think lies with my faction in the Temple of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Life. Aeston Wemur cons apprehensive, and when I ask him for the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; instructions, he gives them to me, until I ask him about travelling <br/>\n&gt;afar,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; after which he says that the word is out not to trust me.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; THis particualarily sucks because I gave him the honeyjum, and instead <br/>\n&gt;of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; giving me the potion, he said my name was bad, not to trust me, etc. And <br/>\n&gt;he<br/>\n&gt; &gt; took my honeyjum!!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; So, my question is, how do I raise my faction with the Temple of Life?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&lt;&lt; text3.html &gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
