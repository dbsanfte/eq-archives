Is charm an area affect? Does the<br/>\nevil eye, or whatever cast it on all the party members at once or one at a<br/>\ntime? If one at a time, is it possible to remove some of the spells in your<br/>\nslot before the charm effect hits you?<br/>\nAlso, as I am advancing toward level 20, I will only be able to take the<br/>\ncrows for two more levels and will have to move on. I have read many<br/>\nmessages of places to go, many do not like Befallen or Unrest, so are there<br/>\nany suggestions of other possible places? Many times I find I am solo,<br/>\nespecially during the week.Has anyone done the skeletons etc, at the ruins<br/>\nin West Karana and could I possibly solo there?Healingsun, Solusek Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
