With normal healing, at lvl 23, using on a tank within my lvl<br/>\nrange...I&#39;d always heal 1 bub of health.  Greater i can usually do 1/3 AT<br/>\nLEAST of his health.  That&#39;s a pretty decent amount...especially if the tank<br/>\nis a bard.

At the guild<br/>\nshop I noticed so many classes of spells...attack spells, healings spells,<br/>\nand other spells were all handled by different NPC&#39;s.  I&#39;ll be spending A<br/>\nLOT of money on spells.  I do have a minor gripe with clerics, though.  They<br/>\njust don&#39;t have enough total mana, and the Minor Healing spell isn&#39;t strong<br/>\nenough.  I was grouped up with a Warrior and after wasting all of my mana<br/>\nhealing him four times, only half of his health had grown back.  Clerics<br/>\nneed more mana!  What do you think?<br/>\n <br/>\nAlbus the Cleric, on The Tribunal Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
