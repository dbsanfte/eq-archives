First off....are they EVEN GAINING EXP after 50?  and if so....its damn hard enough....killing drags etc.  Not to mention....whathappens when the bar fills completely?  does it restart?

What will become of all the exp they gained after <br/>\n  they got Lvl 50?  I think it would be dumb of Verant to allow them to go <br/>\n  from 50 to what ever Lvl just cause they have enough exp too.  Think about <br/>\n  it, would you wanna install the expansion pak just to see &quot;You moved up a <br/>\n  level(s), Welcome to level 60!&quot; or higher?  What fun would that be? <br/>\n  Like one said what if the lvl cap will be say 60 and when you install the <br/>\n  pak you find out you had enough exp to hit Lvl 60?  Wouldn&#39;t we all want to <br/>\n  earn those new lvls with the pak and not now and just have it stored away <br/>\n  till it comes out? <br/>\n  I go with what some say, have it to where when the pak comes out you need <br/>\n  one more kill or a few kills that give you exp to hit Lvl 51.  I doubt I&#39;ll <br/>\n  be on Lvl 50 by then anyways cause I&#39;m just taken my sweet time and getting <br/>\n  lvls when I get them and not rushing it.  But if I do make it to 50 by then <br/>\n  and I have enough exp to go up a few lvls I wouldn&#39;t wanna see welcome to <br/>\n  Lvl 53 or higher before I get to play the new pak. <br/>\n  Ok thats all. <br/>\n<br/>\n  *************************** <br/>\n  Azor Spellbound <br/>\n  Lvl 21 Human Cleric of The Rathe <br/>\n  *************************** <br/>\n<br/>\n  --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ---------------------------- <br/>\n<br/>\n       GET 2 FREE MUSIC CDS AND LOWER YOUR PHONE BILL!
