I, personally, would choose a +3 wis AC 0<br/>\npiece over an AC6 piece that had no wisdom.  Hell, I&#39;ve already done<br/>\nit several times.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut not everyone wants that. I think Verant should recognize that<br/>\npeople that play clerics may strive for one of the two extremes, and<br/>\nlet us make the decision for what kind of cleric we want to play.  I<br/>\nagree that this armor is worthless, since the +wis is so rare.  Unless<br/>\nit changes, I will only get the pieces that are +wis.  For me, the AC<br/>\nis a moot point.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Anne O&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:topaaz1@...\">topaaz1@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] Cleric Sit-in<br/>\n&gt;Date: Tue, 30 Nov 1999 11:37:17 EST<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;here here, well said Jeff, i agree i want more wisdom.  i refuse to do the<br/>\n&gt;quests, as far as im concerned AAC is useless to me in comparison to the<br/>\n&gt;wisdom i need, legs with intel=rediculas!!! plain and simple.....<br/>\n&gt;topaaz<br/>\n&gt;xegony </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
