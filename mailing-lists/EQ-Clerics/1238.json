That sums it up perfectly! :^)<br/>\n    (;  &gt; or maybe najena &lt;not sure of the level range there but it&#39;s worth a try&gt; <br/>\n    Hmm... It seems a bit high, but I&#39;ll check it out nontheless.  <br/>\n    Again, thanks for the informative response.<br/>\n    (&#92;/)ystix Spellchaser <br/>\n    lv 50 human cleric of The Rathe <br/>\n<br/>\n    Nick Shaffner wrote: <br/>\n<br/>\n         A bit off topic, but does anyone know of any guilds on the Rathe that would suit a 21st level cleric?As the Rathe has aged and gotten a bit overcrowded, I find it harder and harder to find good people to group with as well as very difficult to find places to hunt that aren&#39;t crammed to 200% capacity. I was thinking perhaps that a guild might be able to help me here, by providing information and good groupmates...     Any ideas/comments?
