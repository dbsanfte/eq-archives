This especially works with LockJaw,<br/>\nsince he&#39;ll consistently hit for 30s-50s all the times I&#39;ve seen him, and a<br/>\nwizard won&#39;t live long through that sort of barrage.  The other benefit<br/>\nbeing that if they die, all that damage they did was all for naught, so<br/>\nsimply finish off the beast, get the xp and the loot, and laugh at them once<br/>\nthey come back in.  =)  It doesn&#39;t always work, sometimes the wizard is<br/>\npowerful enough to withstand it, or has leatherskin, or something like that<br/>\nand still gets the kill, but at least they&#39;re hurting from it and might<br/>\nthink a little the next time.
