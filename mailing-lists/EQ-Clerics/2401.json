I&#39;m not arguing your point, just<br/>\naskin the question.   I think that you may very well get more notice by<br/>\ndoing it all on one server, if in fact you could get a huge turn out.  If<br/>\nyou did it on all servers you would just spread it out more and get smaller<br/>\nturnouts on all servers instead of a huge showing on one.<br/>\n    -The event is on just one server: Fennin Ro.
