There are many high-level undead<br/>\ncreatures (30+ skels) roaming there at night now from what I hear. Also,<br/>\nthey seem to be dropping some pretty decent items for Clerics. Here are 2<br/>\nthat a friend of mine has found already:<br/>\n<br/>\nTainted Teir&#39;Dal Great Staff<br/>\nMAGIC NODROP<br/>\nDamage 16, Delay 42, Weight 7.5<br/>\n+3 WIS, +3 INT, -5 Disease<br/>\nWAR, CLR, SHD, DRU, MNK, SHM, NEC, WIZ, MAG, ENC<br/>\nALL<br/>\n<br/>\nTainted Battleworn Morning Star<br/>\nMAGIC NODROP<br/>\nDamage 7, Delay 30, Weight 9.0<br/>\n+6 WIS, -5 Disease<br/>\nWAR, CLR, PAL, RNG, SHD, DRU, MNK, BRD, ROG, SHM<br/>\nALL<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t been to Kithicor since PoH opened, but I am excited to see some<br/>\nmore action in an otherwise dead zone. Good thing I got Turgan&#39;s Note and<br/>\nthe Ingot before they added all the baddies ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nDrizben D&#39;Vorn<br/>\nDefiled High Priest of Innoruuk<br/>\nOblivion Knight of the 26th Circle</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
