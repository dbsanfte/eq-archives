I just recently got to level 14.  There<br/>\n&gt; are<br/>\n&gt; lot of nice spells for me to get.  Of course i want them all, but being<br/>\n&gt; able<br/>\n&gt; to afford them is different story.  I was able to buy: Bind Affinity,<br/>\n&gt; healing, Smite, and Expulse Dead, which others should i really try to get?<br/>\n&gt; Thank you.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --Dandili<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
