We agree the low levels should be curbed from getting there,<br/>\n&gt; the how is left for some debate.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;You feel a sense of foreboding as you approach the gate.  You feel you can<br/>\n&gt; go no further.&quot;   Good enough...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Still, I think something should occur if you move into another dimension.<br/>\n&gt; Its not like passing from North to South Karana after all...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And more along the topic of clerics, the gate damage would mean more groups<br/>\n&gt; would need us clerics to go with them, right?<br/>\n&gt; Sounds to me like job security!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kepik DeepWarden of Mithaniel Marr<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;         -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;         From:   Azor [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jmaynus@...\">jmaynus@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;         Sent:   Friday, August 06, 1999 1:21 PM<br/>\n&gt;         To:     <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;         Subject:        Re: [EQ-Clerics] More on the Plane of Fear<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;         From: &quot;Azor&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jmaynus@...\">jmaynus@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;         I think what would be better if it could be done is have the gate<br/>\n&gt; setup to<br/>\n&gt;         where you HAVE to be a certin Lvl to get in, say you should be lvl<br/>\n&gt; 35 to get<br/>\n&gt;         in if you&#39;re not at least Lvl 35 the gate kicks you back out.  Plus<br/>\n&gt; if this<br/>\n&gt;         Plane of Fear is suppose to be so hard then why not have the zone<br/>\n&gt; before it<br/>\n&gt;         harder so these low lvl players can&#39;t even get close to it?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;         **************************<br/>\n&gt;         Azor<br/>\n&gt;         Lvl 18 Human Cleric of the Rathe<br/>\n&gt;         **************************<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;         &gt; From: Jeff Meakins &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Jeff_Meakins@...\">Jeff_Meakins@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;         &gt;<br/>\n&gt;         &gt; And if the gate damage had been in the game from day one, would<br/>\n&gt; there be<br/>\n&gt;         &gt; complaints?  I say far less...<br/>\n&gt;         &gt; Should all of Norrath be available to every player from the get<br/>\n&gt; go?

If the damage gate had been there from day one,<br/>\n&gt; it<br/>\n&gt;         would<br/>\n&gt;         &gt; have been more along the lines of &quot;Cool!

And how does that sound?  &quot;I just wandered in<br/>\n&gt; to the<br/>\n&gt;         &gt; Plane of Fear...ho hum.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;         &gt;<br/>\n&gt;         &gt; And it also proves to be an achievement of sorts, being able to<br/>\n&gt; warp into<br/>\n&gt;         &gt; the Plane of Fear and survive the shock that would kill the<br/>\n&gt; average<br/>\n&gt;         person.<br/>\n&gt;         &gt; I am all for a Plane that causes damage when you enter it...makes<br/>\n&gt; it more<br/>\n&gt;         &gt; ominous and harsh!
