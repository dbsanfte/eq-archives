I start out in a<br/>\nsmall group.  On the test server, there are around 15 people max in<br/>\nUnrest at any given time.  So most people either skirt the outside,<br/>\nor camp the front yard, and have someone pull from the house.  We<br/>\nwere pulling from the house, and the place was like grand central<br/>\nstation.<br/>\n  The best time I&#39;d ever had in Unrest was when we had a 30+ level<br/>\ndruid in wolf form pulling for us.  We took out the entire second<br/>\nfloor without any problems.  But if the person pulling is low enough<br/>\nlevel, they get way more than they bargained for.<br/>\n  Well, I had to leave for a bit, and when I came back, the group was<br/>\nfull, so I decided to solo.  I cast invis to undead on myself, and I<br/>\nwould pull a ghoul, or a DB from the first floor.  The ghouls were<br/>\nusually blue, sometimes green, but I always got xp for them.  The<br/>\nLurking mummys were tough, but I could solo those, but usually if I<br/>\n/yelled for help.  But I tried to stick with ghouls and DBs.<br/>\n  I figured that I could mem calm and calm extras, and would just be<br/>\nable to pull one mob at a time.  I got nearly half a bar solo-ing, and<br/>\nit worked pretty well. I ended up dying 3 times last night though,<br/>\nfrom other peoples trains, and I ended up with slightly less xp than<br/>\nwhen I started.  Anyone have any good advice for solo-ing this place?<br/>\n<br/>\nErgo Soulhealer<br/>\n20th level cleric of Tunare<br/>\ntest server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
