Dodge is one of our warrior-inherited traits. We are not<br/>\nsupposed to be as good as Warriors in this area, thus the cap. For dark elf<br/>\nclerics, our &quot;Hide&quot; skill never goes up past &quot;Below Average&quot;, it is a<br/>\nrace-inherited skill.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if you try it please post your results.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDrizben D&#39;Vorn<br/>\nDefiled Priest of Innoruuk<br/>\nPropagator of Hate<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Curtis Bennett&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:die_kluge@...\">die_kluge@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Even if I spend points into it?  Has anyone tried that?  I think I<br/>\n&gt; might do it.  I&#39;m pretty sure it still shows up on my training screen<br/>\n&gt; when I go to the guildmaster.  Seems like I could spend the plat and<br/>\n&gt; raise it.  It will certainly let me.
