I seriously doubt this, unless a level 30 wizard is stealing from a<br/>\nlevel 15 group. That doesn&#39;t happen much, because high level people aren&#39;t<br/>\ninterested in low level loot. You don&#39;t see level 30&#39;s, or even level 20&#39;s,<br/>\ncamping for mino axes or bronze weapons, for example, even though they could<br/>\neasily steal them from the level 8&#39;s to 15&#39;s who want them. The problem lies<br/>\nwith with wizards, and sometimes mages and clerics, stealing from groups of<br/>\nabout their own level. A simple code change could fix this problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeck, even if you have a wizard of the same level in your group, your kill<br/>\nwill be stolen if he gets in one fewer shots, or if his spells get resisted<br/>\nfor a point or two more than the killstealer&#39;s, no matter HOW much damage<br/>\neveryone else in the group combined does. That is really bad design.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother change that could help is to let everyone know how much damage is<br/>\nbeing done by spellcasters. I don&#39;t understand why everyone can see the<br/>\ndamage done by every blow by the tanks, but only the spellcaster himself can<br/>\nsee his own damage report. If I could see the damage being inflicted by a<br/>\nkillstealer, I might throw in a few offensive spells to try to stop it --<br/>\nwhich I usually don&#39;t, saving most of my mana for healing -- but as of now,<br/>\nI have no idea how much damage is being done, and can&#39;t intervene<br/>\neffectively. &#39;So-and-so begins to cast a spell&#39; just gets lost in all the<br/>\nbattle clutter.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeck, even if you have wizard in your group, he can&#39;t know how much damage<br/>\nis being done by the killstealer and adjust his casts to try to counter it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a very dumb situation, and I don&#39;t understand why Verant has let it<br/>\ncontinue.<br/>\n<br/>\n== Gilead, 19th level dwarven cleric of Fennin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Mr. J Daniels &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warpig@...\">warpig@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Wednesday, July 07, 1999 4:16 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] rez question<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Mr. J Daniels&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warpig@...\">warpig@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Even if they made it so a groups combined damage was taken into<br/>\n&gt;consideration solo wizards would still get the kill credit.
