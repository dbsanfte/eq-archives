There is one<br/>\nspot just outside the Arena zone (after turning right from SK zone) with two<br/>\nspawns far enough away from each other that you can drag one without the<br/>\nother noticing. Further down there are two spawns right next to each other,<br/>\nso you need someone else to take the other one.<br/>\n<br/>\nLake Rathe seems to be a soloists zone, with people rotating the spawns<br/>\nrather than grouping. I have no idea why, but it suits your purpose. The<br/>\nloot is reasonable, pretty good cash and the odd bronze weapon. For me, a<br/>\nsimple melee/smite routine worked fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you get one spawn to yourself, you should have enough time to be able to<br/>\nhop around from foot to foot with full HP and mana for just a little while<br/>\nbefore the next spawn.<br/>\n<br/>\nSalt</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
