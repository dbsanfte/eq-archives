I am also level 20.  Let&#39;s go through the<br/>\nnumbers.  I am a high elf and my base wisdom is 112.  I have the<br/>\nfollowing +wis items: testament of vanear, 2 +2 wis rings, lizardscale<br/>\nmantle, and black iron medallion. for a total of +20 wisdom.  This<br/>\nleaves me with 132 wisdom.  I&#39;m trying to find someone to make me two<br/>\n+3 wisdom earrings, which will give me 138 wisdom.<br/>\nAt 112 wisdom, my mana is 487.  I think healing takes 70 mana so<br/>\nthat&#39;s 6 healing spells, with 50+ mana left over.<br/>\nAt 138 wisdom, my mana will be 592, which is 8 healing spells with 40+<br/>\nmana left over.  So, it should be apparent that it makes a big<br/>\ndifference.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I am shooting for the &#39;pure caster&#39; cleric.  There seems to be two<br/>\ndifferent types of clerics.  (maybe 3), those that seem to really<br/>\nwant to play fighters (they usually play dwarven clerics), and those<br/>\nthat understand what a cleric is really for, and play the pure<br/>\ncaster cleric.  An optional third type is those that play pure caster<br/>\nfor the sake of trying to be a wizard and throwing around smite spells<br/>\nall over the place.<br/>\n  When it comes down to it, a fighter-cleric is just a waste, imho.<br/>\nYou can layer on all kinds of +str, +agi and +dex items, the best<br/>\narmor you can find, and the best weapons, and you will never ever<br/>\ncome close to a fighter or paladin of your level.  A clerics combat<br/>\nskills just don&#39;t compare to those of a fighter.  When I close in on<br/>\ncombat and try to hit with my screaming mace, I miss most of the time.<br/>\n  I think the bottom line is, while you don&#39;t *have* to layer on +wis<br/>\nitems, I think you are truly ignoring what your class is all about.<br/>\nThe more mana you have, the more effective you become.  And the cleric<br/>\nthat can get out 2 more healing spells is a much more handy cleric to<br/>\nhave around.  None of this makes up for how well you play, of course,<br/>\nbut it certainly does help.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a side note, there are several +wis items that can be had by a 20th<br/>\nlevel cleric.<br/>\nTestament of Vanear +10 wisdom (Qeynos quest)<br/>\n+2 wisdom rings (4 plat each from an enchanter)<br/>\n+3 wisdom earrings (around 30 plat each from an enchanter)<br/>\nblack iron medallion +3 wisdom (found on goblin warlord in runnyeye)<br/>\nlizardscale mantle +3 wisdom (cazic-thule) I bought mine.<br/>\nprayer cloth of Tunare +3(crushbone) part of the screaming mace quest<br/>\nlabyrinth talisman +3 wisdom (found on Brahmm in beholder)<br/>\npolished bone bracelets +3 wisdom (evil eyes in beholder)<br/>\n<br/>\nThings to shoot for in the mid-20s:<br/>\nbloodstained tunic +4 wisdom (undead knight in unrest)<br/>\nPaw of Opolla +9 wisdom (quest)<br/>\nSavant&#39;s cap +3 wisdom (reclusive ghoul magi in unrest)<br/>\ncrown of leaves +5 wisdom (Narra Tanith, rare spawn in South Karana)<br/>\nbloodstone eyepatch +3 wisdom (imp familiar in mistmoore)<br/>\nmammoth hide cloak +4 wisdom (goblin alchemist in permafrost)<br/>\ngatorscale leggings +4 wisdom (ancient croc in upper guk)<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps,<br/>\nErgo Soulhealer, high elf cleric of Tunare<br/>\nguildmaster, Hand of Tunare<br/>\nTest Server<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Shin Zed&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:atmai@...\">atmai@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq-clerics@onelist.com\">eq-clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: [EQ-Clerics] Mana Madness<br/>\n&gt;Date: Mon, 8 Nov 1999 14:11:25 -0500<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  The one recurring thing I see here, is wisdom is everything. Is this <br/>\n&gt;true? From what I&#39;ve seen of higher levels, even having near double the <br/>\n&gt;wisdom of others, you get like enough mana to cast half a greater heal or <br/>\n&gt;whatever the non-full heal one is (I&#39;m only lvl 20). Seems strange that wis <br/>\n&gt;is so important if this is the case.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Obarmon, 20th Lvl Cleric<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Get Free Email, Anime News, and The Best Prices at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://AnimeNation.com\">http://AnimeNation.com</a><br/>\n&gt;&lt;&lt; text3.html &gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
