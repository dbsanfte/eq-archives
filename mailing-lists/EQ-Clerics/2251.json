How much did it end up selling for?   The runed<br/>\ncirclet is definately a better value.. and actually you can get that very<br/>\neasily (even at my level) if you are willing to wait for that slow spawning<br/>\ngoblin preacher...<br/>\n<br/>\nI wasn&#39;t planning on going for the cleric armor... but then I looked closer<br/>\nand realized it actually is a little better than rubicite (except for the<br/>\nobvious Rubi breastplate which had that nice healing aura on it)... and I<br/>\nsaw a cleric wearing most of the cleric armor the other day and it looked<br/>\nreally nice on him.
