But, once one reaches 51 the rest<br/>\n&gt; &gt; will cap at 50, and the skill that reached 51 first will keep increasing.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I am level 30 I trained as much as I could in alteration and I havent<br/>\n&gt; &gt; touched the other specialization skills, I want to make sure my specialize<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in alt. is the first to hit 51<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ONElist members are using Shared Files in great ways!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Are you?
