As you go up in Specialization, your mana (cost <br/>\n&gt;per<br/>\n&gt;spell in time/mana/recovery) goes even further until you reach 50.  At 51,<br/>\n&gt;your main Specialization continues its mana-costsavings while your other 4<br/>\n&gt;Specializations - while not getting worse - languish behind your main<br/>\n&gt;Specialization.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Does that make sense, and am I close to understanding?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt;From: Lanadina the Magician &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lanadina@...\">lanadina@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sent: Wednesday, June 30, 1999 3:04 PM<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] ARGH<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Lanadina the Magician &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lanadina@...\">lanadina@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Dan,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Ok...let me try to explain very very simply =)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; When you specialize in a skill, that is completely seperate from your<br/>\n&gt;normal<br/>\n&gt; &gt; skill, (EX. Alteration). My cleric isnt high enough to specialize, but I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have a level 25 magician who has specialized in both Conjuration and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Evocation. I use Conjuration alot more, so I will let that one go past <br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 50 mark. Once the SPECIALIZATION skill goes over 50, that ONE will be <br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; skill you master at...the other skills that you specialize will be <br/>\n&gt;capped<br/>\n&gt;at<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 50. That does not mean that your actual skill in Conjuration or any <br/>\n&gt;other<br/>\n&gt; &gt; skill will stop moving up. Look at Specialization as another skill<br/>\n&gt;entirely.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Once you are able to specialize (I beleive you have to be level 30 to do<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that as a Cleric) you will need to go to your guild trainer, and put ONE<br/>\n&gt; &gt; point in whatever skill you want to specialize in. As a cleric, I will<br/>\n&gt;want<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to do Alteration, so I use less mana when I heal, cast faster, and with<br/>\n&gt;less<br/>\n&gt; &gt; interruptions.  Once you have ONE POINT in there, it will go up as you<br/>\n&gt;play<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in EQ. You will see when it goes up with a message like, Your<br/>\n&gt;specialization<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (Conjuration) has increased! (25) or whatever you have in that skill. By<br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; time you are level 30, your skill in Alteration is already going to <br/>\n&gt;rock,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (about 150 or so).  So, whatever skills you have, they will keep rising,<br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; only thing that will stop rising, is if you specialize in more than one<br/>\n&gt; &gt; skill, and one of them has gone over 50 skill. Everything will keep <br/>\n&gt;going<br/>\n&gt; &gt; up, until you hit 50 in specialize, and the one that went over 50 first,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; will keep rising. (Phew, I hope I didnt confuzzle you more)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Specialization Alteration and Alteration are TWO different skills. Both<br/>\n&gt;will<br/>\n&gt; &gt; keep going up =)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hope this clarifies it!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Lanadina<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;From: &quot;Dan Harmon&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:deharmon@...\">deharmon@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;I must be missing a very basic piece of information or just suffering<br/>\n&gt;from<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;brain fart.  Assume that I don&#39;t have a clue and am probably talking<br/>\n&gt;about<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;something different than what YOU mean.  :)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;I&#39;m a lvl 13 cleric.  Abjuration, alteration, evocation are AT LEAST at<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;skill lvl 60, and probably divination and conjuration are pretty high <br/>\n&gt;as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;well.  How can that be explained?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;I haven&#39;t noticed any better casting ability in any of my spells.  How<br/>\n&gt;can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;that be explained?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;If I HAVE specialized, how can I tell which one it is?(they went over <br/>\n&gt;50<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;about 3 weeks ago...I don&#39;t have a clue which was first).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;If I HAVEN&#39;T specialized, how do I do it?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;If I HAVEN&#39;T specialized, what happens to the other 2-4 spell classes<br/>\n&gt;that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;have already gone over 50?

But, once one reaches 51 the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;rest<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will cap at 50, and the skill that reached 51 first will keep<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;increasing.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am level 30 I trained as much as I could in alteration and I <br/>\n&gt;havent<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; touched the other specialization skills, I want to make sure my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;specialize<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in alt. is the first to hit 51<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor <br/>\n&gt;----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;ONElist members are using Shared Files in great ways!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Are you?
