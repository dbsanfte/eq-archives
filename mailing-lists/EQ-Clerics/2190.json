It is just stupid.  Look at what they did to the cleric armor quest... everything on it takes 7 hours or more to spawn.   And making us camp Bilge just adds insult to injury.. .i mean that goblin is HEAVILY camped already because it holds teh Kedge Totem and some kind of belt.  It rarely spawns and has people lined up for a chance at him, and now they gave it the cleric armor icon as well so we not only have to compete for this rare spawn with other clerics, but also with every other class who wants his items...<br/>\n*sigh*  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhy can&#39;t they make the quests like the Warriors aviak charm quest... where we could kill just normal MOBs and they would rarely drop the icon?   This would make it still difficult to get the piece, since it would be a rare (very rare??) drop... but we could just hunt and try to find it instead of having to camp one rare spawn.    Or maybe they could make it not a hunt at all, but rather a spawn that can come up in random locations, random zones, and you need to follow clues or solve a puzzle in order to know where and when it will spawn?  Something like that... these camping quests just (for lack of a better term) suck.    They said they wanted to put the &quot;Quest&quot; back in EverQuest, but all they have done is put more emphasis than ever on CAMP.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOh well, who am I to say... just another player... one of many...<br/>\n<br/>\n-Eachann Bronzeleaf,<br/>\n-Cleric of Tunare, Tarew Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; In part of their quest against camping, EQ set things up with a spawn<br/>\n&gt; range. Not a specific time. the 7 hour spawn will have a time of, say, 5 to<br/>\n&gt; 7 hours in which it will respawn. As far as I know, the longest spawn in<br/>\n&gt; the game is something on the Shaman armour quest, with a maximum of 48<br/>\n&gt; hours between death and respawn.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Lareneg.
