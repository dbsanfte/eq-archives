Doesn&#39;t make ANY<br/>\n&gt;sense to me, much less total as it does to you. If you have been given the<br/>\n&gt;ability by the gods to put a &quot;divine&quot; shield around yourself and make<br/>\n&gt;yourself invulnerable from being hit, then you shouldn&#39;t be able to be<br/>\n&gt;stunned because the critter MUST hit you to stun you.  Quite simply, you<br/>\n&gt;can&#39;t get stunned if you can&#39;t get hit.  Now, if they would&#39;ve said Divine<br/>\n&gt;Aura is strictly a spell to prevent you from taking any DAMAGE from a hit<br/>\n&gt;but not to prevent you from BEING hit, then that is different.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But in my opinion, if we have the ability to cloak ourselves from damage,<br/>\n&gt;it should include ALL damage, including stuns.  Because stun to me IS a<br/>\n </span></blockquote>form<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;of damage even though it does not reduce your hps.  It renders you<br/>\n </span></blockquote>incapable<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;of moving, which to me, is STILL a type of damage. Just like the blinding<br/>\n&gt;light spell.....its effects, aka damage, aren&#39;t reflected in loss of hps<br/>\n </span></blockquote>but<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;it DOES damage to you by rendering you incapable of seeing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Mik<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;             Free Games & Cash Prizes!<br/>\n&gt;Gamesville - The World&#39;s Biggest & Best Game Show Site!<br/>\n&gt;        <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/ad/gamesville0\">http://www.onelist.com/ad/gamesville0</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
