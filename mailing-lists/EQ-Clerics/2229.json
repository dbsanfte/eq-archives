I mean 2 of your buffs stack, but not all<br/>\n&gt; of them.  Holy Armor stacks with Courage, but it doesn&#39;t stack with<br/>\n&gt; Spirit Armor, just as courage won&#39;t stack with center.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There are 2 lines of buffs... one is AC and the other is HP/AC.   You<br/>\n&gt; can have one spell from each line casted effectively.   If somebody has<br/>\n&gt; center on and you try to cast Courage, it will say &quot;your spell did not<br/>\n&gt; take hold&quot;.  If they have Courage and you cast Center it will cancel<br/>\n&gt; courage and give them center.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -Eachann Bronzeleaf<br/>\n&gt; -Cleric of Tunare, Tarew Marr<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: Kevin Dailey &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Kevin_Dailey@...\">Kevin_Dailey@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, November 16, 1999 2:25 PM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [EQ-Clerics] To Walt<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Kevin Dailey &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Kevin_Dailey@...\">Kevin_Dailey@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Walt said:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;My buffs are not that great yet at 10 as I only have center and the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; first level spell to use.   I do not think that holy armor and center<br/>\n&gt; &gt; can be stacked.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; OMG, Walt, are you being serious? Have you tried stacking Holy Armor and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Center? Haven&#39;t you been buffing yourself or others? Of course they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; stack, my friend. All your buffs stack, one right on top of the other.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Eventually, you&#39;ll have a stack of four beautiful yellow shields that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; will make you a power to be dealt with. Last night a cleric gave me<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Bravery, Guard, Rune 1, and the level 2 Symbol. At level 19, I had 974<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hp. And my AC was 473. Unfortunately, he was too high level (33) to be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in our group.

When I am in a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; group<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I will watch the health bars of all the others and break off from melee<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; heal.  Most of the time when I am in a group and heal, the mob will<br/>\n&gt; &gt; start in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; on me though.  I of course have taken off my auto-attack and changed<br/>\n&gt; &gt; target.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Most of the time I have even backed off away from the critter.   I take<br/>\n&gt; &gt; my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; role as the medic in my group very seriously.  My buffs are not that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; great<br/>\n&gt; &gt; yet at 10 as I only have center and the first level spell to use.   I do<br/>\n&gt; &gt; not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; think that holy armor and center can be stacked.  As I have stated many<br/>\n&gt; &gt; times here before though my problem is finding a group to start with.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I also will not use smite that often in melee unless I am alone since I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; do<br/>\n&gt; &gt; prefer to save my mana for healing and buffing.  Those two buffs alone<br/>\n&gt; &gt; take<br/>\n&gt; &gt; me about two bars of mana.   I have around a 105 or 110 wisdom and two<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wisdom rings of +2.   I know I need more items but they are expensive<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sure and I, like most my age, am pretty broke.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I really do not see why the others fail to do their duty.  I often play<br/>\n&gt; &gt; melee classes and have clerics and druids heal me when I am resting all<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; time.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Yilari, Cleric of Tunare, Erollsi Marr<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
