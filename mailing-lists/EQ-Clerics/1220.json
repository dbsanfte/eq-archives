Is it due to the fact that we med so much that we forget to<br/>\n&gt;loot?  I have been hunting with the same group of ppl since lvl 15 and we<br/>\n&gt;are all pretty fair about loot.  However, the other day we took in a dwarf<br/>\n&gt;paladin, and my gosh, he was a greedy little bastard.  Looted everything in<br/>\n&gt;sight.  However, when hunting with my group, I usually get a good<br/>\n&gt;split...it&#39;s the monk who I feel sorry for...he can never carry anything so<br/>\n&gt;he doesnt loot...but he is the richest one amongst us...=/<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The reasons I&#39;m so poor are:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) I usually med immediately after combat ceases in preparation for the<br/>\ntrain the ALWAYS comes when you&#39;re down on mana and HPs....
