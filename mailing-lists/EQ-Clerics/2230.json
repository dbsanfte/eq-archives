(Either because of<br/>\nlack of skill or lack of mob intelligence).<br/>\n2. Snare and root both work as taunts.<br/>\n3a. Snare is usually preferred to root, because the mob will still run when<br/>\nlow on health.<br/>\n3b. Root is usually used to park a mob out of the way, or when you want to<br/>\nrun away.<br/>\n<br/>\nRoot has a specific use which I have found very useful in the teens and I<br/>\nsuspect for a little longer yet. In my experience, a rooted mob will attack<br/>\nthe nearest person. Not the person who has done it the most damage, or the<br/>\nperson who has taunted it a lot, but the very nearest person, even if the<br/>\npeople who have made it angry are still within melee range.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d be surprised if this is a special effect of root, it probably just drops<br/>\nout of the mob anger calculation, part of which is based on distance. But it<br/>\nseems to work. Here&#39;s a specific instance:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other day I was in Crushbone and a couple of people were attacking a<br/>\ncenturion. They were levels 8-9. When he got to to about 1/2 health I rooted<br/>\nhim, and stepped in closer than they were. I didn&#39;t attack the centurion,<br/>\nbut he turned to me and started hitting (OK missing) me. This could be<br/>\nattributed to the taunt value of root so far. But when one of the other<br/>\npeople moved closer, he switched back to them. Then I moved closer still,<br/>\npractically on top of him, and he switched back to me and stayed on me for<br/>\nthe remainder, even though I was never attacking him.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve found this a good technique for damage-spreading. But don&#39;t take my<br/>\nword for it - try it out. My experiments haven&#39;t been very scientific up to<br/>\nnow.<br/>\n<br/>\nElbeno, 19 times blessed by Karana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
