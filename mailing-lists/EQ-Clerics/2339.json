Is there anyone on Erollisi Marr?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Again I wish to thank all for the help I have gotten from this list.<br/>\nAfter<br/>\n&gt; weeks of frustration in trying to make 11 in and around CB Yilari moved to<br/>\n&gt; Freeport temporarily.    Well today she made 12 and has a lot of fun<br/>\nkilling<br/>\n&gt; orcs in EC and dervs in N. Ro.  She has also had fun with the zombies and<br/>\n&gt; mummies at the ruins in EC and the occasional wisp that comes along.  No<br/>\n&gt; luck finding a GSL though yet.  Her only bad experience came when she was<br/>\n&gt; talked into venturing down into Oasis.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I also understand what you all have been saying about being helpful and<br/>\n&gt; people will notice.  Yilari has ran all over EC healing and curing disease<br/>\n&gt; etc when people call out for aid.  Today someone came up to her and gave<br/>\nher<br/>\n&gt; a chain tunic.   Now she is looking to either give away or sell her<br/>\nleather<br/>\n&gt; one.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am wondering about weapons now.   She currently uses either cracked<br/>\nstaff<br/>\n&gt; or summoned hammer.  She cannot afford one of the really nice weapons yet<br/>\n&gt; but what should she be looking for?   Remember that she barely has 11pp in<br/>\n&gt; the bank and has to be able to afford 14th level spells soon also.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks all,<br/>\n&gt; Yilari, High Elven Cleric of Tunare, Erollsi Marr<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Sianne .&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:maggee1@...\">maggee1@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; How many ppl do we have out there on the Xegony Server??...would be nice<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; get together and kinda help each other out...occasionally...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sianne  28th<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Xegony<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
