What manner is that?  I<br/>\nam 19th, and before I bought my banded armor, I had 98 plat in the<br/>\nbank and some change.  I have 8 greater lightstones in a backpack that<br/>\nI can sell to the gypsies for around 72 plat.  That put me at around<br/>\n170 plat.<br/>\n  The most profitable thing at 15th level is either bronze weapons or<br/>\ngreater lighstones.  Both of which are semi-rare.  These are the only<br/>\nthings that I can think of.  You can kill the occasional gem dropping mob in <br/>\nFaydwar, Pixies, or Drakes, or those winged-women things in<br/>\nSteamfont, but even those aren&#39;t that valuable or very common.<br/>\n  The only other thing I can think of is that you are doing quests and<br/>\nthen auctioning the items.  Like doing the Shining Star of Light quest<br/>\nover and over again and then selling it for 50 pp a pop or something.<br/>\nI suppose it might fetch that much on a production server, certainly<br/>\nnot on Test.  Seems like the demand would run low, and most newbies<br/>\nsimply can&#39;t afford that much.<br/>\nBeyond that, I can not thing of any normal means to acquire 4000 plat<br/>\nby the time you reach 15th level.  It is inconceivable.<br/>\n  You talk like it is common knowledge that everyone should have 4000<br/>\nplat by the time they are 15th level.  That&#39;s just absurd.<br/>\n<br/>\n  A friend of mine stayed up all night once and killed wisps on wisp<br/>\nisle.  He sold all the greater lightstones to the gypsy camp and ended<br/>\nup making around 800 plat.  It took him nearly a day to do that.  He<br/>\nwas 20th level.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: AoS/Aosinator &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:darshan@...\">darshan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Very profitable way to hunt?  Sounds like you&#39;re exploiting to me.  I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;don&#39;t know any 15th level anythings that can shell out the 1000+ pp<br/>\n&gt; &gt;for an observer staff.  That&#39;s a lot of greater lightstones and bronze<br/>\n&gt; &gt;spears.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Can be done and has been done in the past, without use of exploits.<br/>\n&gt;Aosinator had amassed almost 4000pp by the time she was level 15, and it<br/>\n&gt;was by using her proceeds in an intelligent manner.
