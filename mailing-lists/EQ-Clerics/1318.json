I<br/>\nthink<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; first group there stays there, regardless of their level.  And noone is<br/>\nable<br/>\n&gt; to throw<br/>\n&gt; another group out if that group was there first.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have wanted a nightshade wreath and gem sceptre for ages.  So today,<br/>\n&gt; myself and 5 other level 50s went to camp MM castle.  Everything there was<br/>\n&gt; green to us, but myself and a level 50 shaman friend wanted wreaths and<br/>\n&gt; sceptres, which we didn&#39;t have.  Under Brad&#39;s rule, if a group of<br/>\n&gt; level 35+ comes, and they can get exp for that area, then we have to yield<br/>\n&gt; and give up a spot we have been at for hours. Tell me where the fairness<br/>\nin<br/>\n&gt; THAT<br/>\n&gt; rule is.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Since there are very few places I can get exp anymore and have maxxed<br/>\n&gt; out level 50, I am going around and getting items I don&#39;t have because I<br/>\nwas<br/>\n&gt; focusing on exp and helping others level as well.  I plan to do the Paw of<br/>\n&gt; Opallo quest next.  Mitty is green to me, as is Gynok Moltar.  Should I<br/>\nhave<br/>\n&gt; to leave camping them just because lower levels come to camp for the same<br/>\n&gt; items I<br/>\n&gt; want?  I think that is totally unfair. Just because I am level 50 doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; mean I&quot;m not<br/>\n&gt; entitled to get items I don&#39;t have just because the mobs don&#39;t give me exp<br/>\n&gt; anymore.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Again, my opinion is....first there stays there.  Then when they leave,<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; next group in line gets the camp spot.  I don&#39;t think levels should have<br/>\n&gt; anything to do with who gets the camp spot.  I don&#39;t think high levels<br/>\n&gt; should force lower levels away from a camp spot, and I don&#39;t think lower<br/>\n&gt; levels should be able to force higher levels away if they were there<br/>\nfirst.<br/>\n&gt; To do it any other way discriminates against one group over another<br/>\n(higher<br/>\n&gt; vs. lower).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And I&#39;ll tell you this....if a GM tells me to leave a camp spot I have<br/>\nbeen<br/>\n&gt; at<br/>\n&gt; for hours for an item I don&#39;t have that I want just because some lower<br/>\n&gt; levels  arrived and want my spot, then I won&#39;t be playing EQ for very<br/>\n&gt; much longer.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The only fair way IMO is first there stays there, regardless of level,<br/>\nthen<br/>\n&gt; whomever was next gets it next, and so on and so on.  Get in line and take<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; number.  No one group of players should be favored over another.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To do it Brad&#39;s way, would mean that any player that didn&#39;t get an item<br/>\n&gt; while he/she was<br/>\n&gt; able to get exp from that particular mob could basically never get that<br/>\nitem<br/>\n&gt; cause they could be<br/>\n&gt; thrown out of the camp spot everytime lower levels came along.  This is<br/>\n&gt; totally not fair.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Mik (who abhors discrimination or favoritism in any way, shape or form)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: John Erik Maynus &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jmaynus@...\">jmaynus@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Date: Saturday, September 11, 1999 11:41 PM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [EQ-Clerics] Yield Policy<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;John Erik Maynus&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jmaynus@...\">jmaynus@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;What does everyone think of this Yield Policy?
