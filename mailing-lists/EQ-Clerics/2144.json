I am currently on that server <br/>\n(from Prexus) playing my first cleric and I must say it is fun. Starting out <br/>\non a new server with a class that groups love is the best grouping exp i&#39;ve <br/>\never had. I am currently lv 23 with the av newbie lvl being around 14 to 20. <br/>\nThere are a lot of 14 to 20&#39;s, but all the major dungeons lv 20 and up are <br/>\nempty enuf to have HARDLY any trains and some VERY nice exp (excluding <br/>\nunrest.. ppl like to solo the house there at lv 13.. where&#39;d they get that <br/>\nidea?) Places like Guk, Cazic Thule, Mistmoore, etc all have less then 10 <br/>\nppl in them at a time.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to start a new server i would highly suggest the Nameless. Even <br/>\nhas several gms on... tho not as many as other servers =&#92;<br/>\n<br/>\nDemius: Lv 23 Dwarf Cleric<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;Latest server is The Nameless if I remember correctly.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Vinamin<br/>\n&gt;Son of Innoruuk<br/>\n&gt;Priest of The Lady<br/>\n&gt;Erollisi Marr<br/>\n&gt;&lt;&lt; text3.html &gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
