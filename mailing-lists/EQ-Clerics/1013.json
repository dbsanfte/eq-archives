Being a cleric in Prexus, I find more delight in healing folk wherever I go than to rise in level. That is who I am, and that is what ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1067072225\">I too am new in this ML. Being a cleric in Prexus, I<br/>\nfind more delight in healing folk wherever I go than<br/>\nto rise in level. That is who I am, and that is what<br/>\nI do.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe satisfaction derived later on, makes up the<br/>\ninconveniences we face. To illustrate this:<br/>\n<br/>\nRight now, I am a level 12 cleric (been offline a<br/>\nmonth). I used to heal folk in Felwithe, Greater<br/>\nFaydark, Butcherblock, Crushbone, Kelethin, Kaladim,<br/>\nUnrest, and Befallen.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I used to be at Greater Faydark, I used to fight<br/>\nwith orcs. And at that time, in the world of Prexus,<br/>\nwe were not very strong (just launched in June).<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes I despair over the STUPIDITY of folk around<br/>\nme who just receive healing and get themselves<br/>\nkilled. And that is the main trouble. I heal stupid<br/>\nfolk as well. (Actually, I heal almost everybody I<br/>\nsee).<br/>\n<br/>\nSome names have been forgotten, but one comes to<br/>\nmind. Peorith. A lady paladin. Once, she used to get<br/>\ntrashed up and I had to heal her, among others. Now,<br/>\nshe is far stronger than me, but she remembers me<br/>\nfondly (even as I am level 12, and she is probably<br/>\nlevel 20 something.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point I am saying is that each of us have reasons<br/>\nbeing clerics. It could be to &quot;serve&quot; our deity, or<br/>\nto take a back seat in combat, and so on, so forth. I<br/>\nknow some clerics of Tunare like me, who hail me for<br/>\nwhat I do. My behaviour and other clerics are very<br/>\nlikely to be different.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow are we clerics supposed to behave is up to us. If<br/>\nI want to heal EVERYBODY, even dark elves, I will<br/>\nheal them. Some of my kind hate dark elves. Well, I<br/>\ndon&#39;t really care! I only care about this: That as<br/>\nlong as we are comrade at arms, that you are not rude<br/>\nand impolite, that you need help, I am at your<br/>\nservice (which, incidentally brought the attention of<br/>\nsome powerful priestesses like Starr and Sadana).<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause of this, it has made my life quite colourful.<br/>\nI have had marriage proposals, offers to join a few<br/>\nguilds, had my share of upsetting the orcs at<br/>\nCrushbone (I was the reason why the death toll at<br/>\nCrushbone dropped, I think). (Incidentally, I am<br/>\nlooking for the opportunity to build a relationship<br/>\nwith other guilds in Prexus. Hope clerical folks<br/>\ncould send me a private email).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I can&#39;t really see what is so significant about<br/>\ncleric behaviour. We have reasons to be clerics. We<br/>\ncan be tanks, or can&#39;t be tanks (occasionally, I act<br/>\nas a tank). We can be healers in a party or a guild<br/>\nor for ourselves. For me, I don&#39;t care. I heal anyone<br/>\nI see and refuse to aid anyone who is rude to me (and<br/>\nlet them just sit down, waiting for their health to<br/>\nrecover at a very slow pace). That is my &quot;behaviour&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, another thing for clerics. We all know that to<br/>\ngate, it takes time. That is why clerics don&#39;t bother<br/>\ngating when they are being attacked. Today, I was in<br/>\nBefallen, and my health was down to a minimum. I was<br/>\ndying and trapped in level 3 and alone. Thus, I was<br/>\nforced to cast my gate spell, even as I thought it<br/>\nwas hopeless.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd you know what? I GATED! I did receive 1 point of<br/>\ndamage while casting, but I was able to hold my<br/>\nconcentration. The moral of the story is: Sure, we<br/>\nare going to get hit when casting the slow gate<br/>\nspell. But when your life depends on it, try it. You<br/>\nmight be amazed that the spell will go through.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, when a cleric disappears in a party, a lot<br/>\nof party members are going to die (but then, the<br/>\nparty members were busy attacking undead even when<br/>\nwarned by a low on mana cleric not to do so). Which<br/>\nis why I said, I really have to tolerate STUPID folk.<br/>\nAnd that, is my behaviour.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:---AsmodeusDP@...\">---AsmodeusDP@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AsmodeusDP@...\">AsmodeusDP@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m new to this mail list, and thought I would<br/>\n </span></blockquote>introduce myself with a topic <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; to discuss.
