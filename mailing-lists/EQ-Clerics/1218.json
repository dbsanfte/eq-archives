Anyone? My favourite is baking<br/>\n&gt; because you can cook on the move.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Elbeno<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have a question of my own, why is the cleric traditionally a poor class<br/>\n(fund wise)?  Is it due to the fact that we med so much that we forget to<br/>\nloot?  I have been hunting with the same group of ppl since lvl 15 and we<br/>\nare all pretty fair about loot.  However, the other day we took in a dwarf<br/>\npaladin, and my gosh, he was a greedy little bastard.  Looted everything in<br/>\nsight.  However, when hunting with my group, I usually get a good<br/>\nsplit...it&#39;s the monk who I feel sorry for...he can never carry anything so<br/>\nhe doesnt loot...but he is the richest one amongst us...=/<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I was thinking of starting pottery or maybe brewing.  Brewing would<br/>\nguarantee me an in on any party and pottery, will, just seems unusual enough<br/>\nto do.  Too bad we can&#39;t have alchemy or that would have been my first<br/>\nchoice.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Imogen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nONElist:  your connection to online communities.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
