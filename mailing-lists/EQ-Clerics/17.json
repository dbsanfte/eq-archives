Let&#39;s start with why<br/>\nyou want to be a cleric.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith me it was a simple choice.  I like to be able to help people.  There is<br/>\nnothing like coming upon someone locked in a life or death battle and<br/>\nswaying the tide to their side.  I don&#39;t do it for any reward other than the<br/>\nthank you I receive.  It is good to know that you helped.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also like the fighting abilities of the Cleric.  Although not as good as<br/>\nthe Warrior or the Paladin, Clerics can definitely hold their own.<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid<br/>\n<br/>\na.k.a.  Doro on FenninRo</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
