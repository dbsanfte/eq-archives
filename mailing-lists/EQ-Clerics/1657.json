As in almost exponentially harder to gain.<br/>\nI&#39;d have to go back thru EQVault&#39;s back issues and look, but they were<br/>\ntalking as though to go from 51 to 52 was going to be a very arduous process<br/>\nto go through, let alone getting to 60.  Not to say that people won&#39;t reach<br/>\nthat quickly, still, but they&#39;ve already said they&#39;re going to make it much<br/>\nmore difficult to do.  And as far as gaining xp past filling the bubble for<br/>\n50, I would guess that Verant thought of that a long time ago, even if some<br/>\nof their other decisions seem a little short-sighted at times.  For now,<br/>\nthough, what&#39;s the point in speculating on something you have absolutely no<br/>\nidea about, Azor?  If you&#39;re that concerned about it, post the question to<br/>\none of the EQ newsgroups that Smedley seems to read religiously.
