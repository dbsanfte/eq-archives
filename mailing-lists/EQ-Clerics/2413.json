Although some of the<br/>\n&gt;cleric items seem decent enough, the simple fact that<br/>\n&gt;we are expected to watch for ground spawns disgust me!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The first time I waited for a ground spawn, I was in<br/>\n&gt;Kithicor (this was before all the undead was<br/>\n&gt;introduced there).  I had been sitting all by my<br/>\n&gt;lonely for 3 hours (at least) and nothing happened.<br/>\n&gt;Unfortunately, I had to run afk.  By the time I got<br/>\n&gt;back there was a /tell from someone saying that they<br/>\n&gt;picked up the item while passing through.  BAH.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Last night we were hunting undead in Kithicor.  It was<br/>\n&gt;morning in the game and I decided to check that spot<br/>\n&gt;since our &quot;puller&quot; said it looked like a bag was<br/>\n&gt;sitting on the ground.  Well, I got excited and ran<br/>\n&gt;over there.  Heh, not a good idea, i tell ya... Even<br/>\n&gt;tho most of the mobs in kith con blue to me, they are<br/>\n&gt;horrible to even attempt to solo.  Needless to say I<br/>\n&gt;got splattered to the ground and lost my level.<br/>\n&gt;Happened the second time too!  (no laughing at me<br/>\n&gt;Topaaz, your day will come as mine did!)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I have also died in MistMoore while waiting for the<br/>\n&gt;ground spawn in there and I cant even attempt to find<br/>\n&gt;the named gobbo in the Cauldron without a druid with<br/>\n&gt;me.  To this day I haven&#39;t any of my ingots or icons.<br/>\n&gt;I dont feel like dedicating weeks of time just for<br/>\n&gt;ground staring.  Although I would love the added AC, I<br/>\n&gt;feel that my wisdom enhancing clothing will have to do<br/>\n&gt;for now.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Adira SoulSaver<br/>\n&gt;Bandaid of Tunare (blessed 37 times)<br/>\n&gt;Rodcet NIfe<br/>\n&gt;--- Anne O &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:topaaz1@...\">topaaz1@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; here here, well said Jeff, i agree i want more<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wisdom.  i refuse to do the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; quests, as far as im concerned AAC is useless to me<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in comparison to the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wisdom i need, legs with intel=rediculas!!! plain<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and simple.....<br/>\n&gt; &gt; topaaz<br/>\n&gt; &gt; xegony<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;From: &quot;Jeff Portwine&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jdport@...\">jdport@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Subject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] Cleric Sit-in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Date: Tue, 30 Nov 1999 09:34:17 -0500<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;&lt; text2.html &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;&lt; text3.html &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&lt;HR&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&lt;html&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;=====<br/>\n&gt;Get paid for reading E-Mail!<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sendmoreinfo.com/id/63758\">http://www.sendmoreinfo.com/id/63758</a><br/>\n&gt;__________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt;Thousands of Stores.
