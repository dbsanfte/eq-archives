The reasoning<br/>\nmay be that extremely high red mobs need to be kited for a longer time<br/>\n(wouldn&#39;t know, not played a druid).  Hence, the duration of SoW was<br/>\nlowered. Kiting is still possible, but now the druid or shaman will need to<br/>\ncast it more often. This may discourage them or make them think twice about<br/>\nkiting a mob that is way out of their league.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Heather Daley [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:blushn@...\">blushn@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: 1999/09/14 11:19 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [EQ-Clerics] New Patch<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Heather Daley&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:blushn@...\">blushn@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for sending it, as I said I did not see it yet, I agree it doesn&#39;t <br/>\nappear to say anything about the buffs being changed, but I spoke to another<br/>\n<br/>\ncleric and a ranger who are high level and the rangers SoW which used to <br/>\nlast 25 minutes  was only lasting for 10 minutes now and the cleric stated <br/>\n&quot;he was wondering why everyone kept asking for resolution so often&quot;<br/>\nSo, i haven&#39;t seen this first hand just going on what I was told.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I may be wrong, but I don&#39;t see any mention of any cleric spell or buff<br/>\n&gt;change.
