Especiallyl when<br/>\nrunning.  I start to stutter and stagger and slow down<br/>\nto almost a crawl.  This has been affecting not only<br/>\nmyself, but my party members also.  It&#39;s lead to more<br/>\ndeaths than I can imagine.

And my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; meter is not showing any lag at all. I find it<br/>\n&gt; disconcerting, to say the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; least. Rest assured, I have a very fast<br/>\n&gt; computer/graphics setup, and a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; fast modem. I recently downloaded a big 28 meg<br/>\n&gt; SBLive! upgrade...I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wonder if that crap has affected my gameplay<br/>\n&gt; somehow...I hate some of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; those SBLive! components.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Saidinn<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I used to zone fast -- very fast, and then over time<br/>\n&gt; it dropped down to where<br/>\n&gt; I seem to zone slowly...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; About 2 weeks ago, I started getting disconnected<br/>\n&gt; when I zone.  Not just once,<br/>\n&gt; but nearly everytime.  I wrote EQ tech support, but<br/>\n&gt; solved the problem on my<br/>\n&gt; own without them.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; With all of the screenshots I had taken and never<br/>\n&gt; cleaned up, as well as the<br/>\n&gt; email that had been piling up and never read (all<br/>\n&gt; those distribution lists I<br/>\n&gt; used to pay attention to before I became an EQ<br/>\n&gt; Addict), my harddrive partition<br/>\n&gt; was getting full, and was extremely fragmented.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I cleaned up the email, removed 90% of the<br/>\n&gt; screenshots, defraged, and my<br/>\n&gt; problems went away.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yes, I still get disconnected sometimes due to<br/>\n&gt; network problems (lag, etc.)<br/>\n&gt; but tracert will tell me if it&#39;s local, in-route, or<br/>\n&gt; on the EQ end, so I know<br/>\n&gt; when to panic or not.  And the client problems are<br/>\n&gt; gone after a small amount<br/>\n&gt; of sys maintenance.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;Shanna on Rallos<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>____________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Get your own FREE, personal Netscape WebMail account<br/>\n&gt; today at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://webmail.netscape.com\">http://webmail.netscape.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Share your special moments with family and friends-<br/>\n&gt; send PHOTO Greetings<br/>\n&gt; at Zing.com!
