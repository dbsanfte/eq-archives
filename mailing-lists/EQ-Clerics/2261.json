But other than that I play my DE strictly for RP value. I<br/>\nunderstand that I am not as dexterous as the little guys. That&#39;s the way<br/>\nInnoruuk built me. All I can do is find things to help that stat. I think<br/>\nit&#39;s important to play a character that you like, rather than for the stats.<br/>\nSure, if I wanted to max out WIS I would have chosen a High Elf. But playing<br/>\na High Elf would not make me happy. My personality fits the role of a DE, so<br/>\nI choose this character, along with his shortcomings.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s all I have to say about that...<br/>\n<br/>\nDrizben D&#39;Vorn<br/>\nDefiled High Priest of Innoruuk<br/>\nOblivion Knight of the 29th Circle<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From:\t&quot;Mr. J Daniels&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warpig@...\">warpig@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Make a halfing halfings rock,  de&#39;s suck as clerics, horrible starting<br/>\n&gt; stats.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
