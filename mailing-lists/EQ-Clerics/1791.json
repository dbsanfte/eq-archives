The placeholder spawn","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1211075288\">Hey guys, after 17 straight hours of camping that stupid placeholder for<br/>\nGynok Moltar and STILL no Gynok Moltar, here is what I saw:<br/>\n<br/>\n1.  The placeholder spawn consisted of putrid rats, IBSs, regular skels,<br/>\nghouls.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. NOT every placeholder that spawns talks.  Some of them do and some of<br/>\nthem don&#39;t, and I mean some of the SAME type.  Not all putrid rats that<br/>\nspawn talk, or IBSs or ghouls.  I&#39;ve had some of the rats talk and some not,<br/>\nsome of the IBSs talk and some not.  When they talk they say something<br/>\nlike...&quot;Aiewwwwwww, you have disturbed my sleep and now you won&#39;t rest&quot; or<br/>\nsomething or other like that about disturbing their sleep or rest.<br/>\n<br/>\n3.  The placeholder spawned right at the zone entrance inside Befallen every<br/>\n18 minutes or so.<br/>\n<br/>\n4.  WATCH OUT  FOR TRAINS.  Stupid trains seemed to always happen when it<br/>\nwas time for the placeholder to spawn, and several times, I almost LOST the<br/>\nstupid placeholder (especially if it didn&#39;t talk) and had to chase it down<br/>\nand kill every single dang thing in the train to be sure I got it.<br/>\n<br/>\n5.  If a ghoul spawns, which it frequently does, ROOT it and kill it fast,<br/>\ncause it runs FAST downstairs.  I had to chase a couple of em down to 3rd<br/>\nlevel cause they were so fast and almost got away from me.  Before my DD<br/>\nundead spell could cast it was out of range.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps.  Any other questions, just ask.<br/>\n<br/>\nMik<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Sean O&#39;Brien &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sobrien@...\">sobrien@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Sunday, October 10, 1999 9:01 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] Gynok&#39;s Placeholders<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Sean O&#39;Brien&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sobrien@...\">sobrien@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Gynok&#39;s place holder spawns at the zone and does a shout to the whole<br/>\n&gt; zone, you will see a giant rat shouts &quot;some garbage about waking me or<br/>\n&gt; something&quot; it then wanders thru 1st level, then 2nd level then 3rd<br/>\n&gt; level. So unless the spot is camped the only way be sure is to go thru<br/>\n&gt; and kill anything that seems to be moving, and since the place holder<br/>\n&gt; may have made it to his final resting place, everything on the third<br/>\n&gt; floor, then go back up and camp the zone killing everything that spawns<br/>\n&gt; and does a shout.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The place holder can be anything that spawns in Befallen, but I have<br/>\n&gt; seen/heard Giant rats, putrid skeles, a skeleton and ghouls.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sirensa Qi&#39;Seraph wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Does anyone know for certain what or where Gynok&#39;s placeholder is on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 3rd floor?
