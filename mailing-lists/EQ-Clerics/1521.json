Sure,<br/>\nI get lag now in then in the past, but the past week, the lag has been<br/>\nunbearable.  Though the strange thing  is, my lag metre doesn&#39;t show any<br/>\nlag.  I have experience the following problems:<br/>\n <br/>\n1) Travelling:  When travelling, I get these pauses, where the whole screen<br/>\nsort of &#39;stops&#39; every 10 - 15 seconds.  This makes long trips over zones<br/>\nvery annoying.<br/>\n <br/>\n2) Fighting:  Two nites in a row now, I have been in Befallen, and had mobs<br/>\ntrained on me.  NOrmally, I can outrun them to safety.  But the past while,<br/>\nthe lag seems to prevent me from casting spells and hitting back.  However,<br/>\nthe mobs seem to do the same amount of dmg no matter what the lag situation<br/>\nis.  I know you may think that I am just expressing sour grapes for dying,<br/>\nbut it isn&#39; t the case.  I have bee killed many times before, and rightly<br/>\nso.  But the deaths lately, when related to lag, seem to give the mobs an<br/>\nunfair advantage.<br/>\n <br/>\n3)Item usage: Lag has prevented my door keys from working right away in<br/>\nBefallen. I find I have to click things two or three times to get them to<br/>\nwork.  This applies to looting, selling, trading, and using items such as<br/>\nkeys.<br/>\n <br/>\nAny ways, I just want to know if any of you have had any of these problems<br/>\nof late.  I am really trying to figure out if this is a link related<br/>\nproblem, or if a recent patch affected playablility in this manner.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nChris.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
