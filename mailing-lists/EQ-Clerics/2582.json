Ward <br/>\nUndead can only do 35 dmg at lvl 5 but at lvl 10 it can do 40 dmg.<br/>\n<br/>\n----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nexpulse undead doesn&#39;t do 104 dmg. mine is like 92 or something, but i am<br/>\nlvl 30.  my Dismiss undead does 152 and my wrath around 200 -204.<br/>\n<br/>\nSianne<br/>\n30th Cleric<br/>\nXegony<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;This is really likely a question that you all will think I am wierd in<br/>\n&gt;asking but it has been gnawing at me for a couple of days now.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;What determines the damage that a spell does?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The reason I am asking this is that I remember talking with a 16th level<br/>\n&gt;cleric a couple of weeks ago who stated that they did 104 pts damage with<br/>\n&gt;Expulse Undead.   When I first got the spell at 14 I was doing max of 89<br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;now at 15 it is up to 90.  I know that the damage is therefore a little<br/>\n&gt;dependent on age.   Does wisdom or any other stat have some impact on the<br/>\n&gt;maximum damage that we can do?  I am really tempted to remove my few wisdom<br/>\n&gt;enhancing items to see if it drops but then again if it is based on natural<br/>\n&gt;wisdom then this would not tell me anything at all.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Well I am off to see if I can make it 16th again.   Some advice to all.  Do<br/>\n&gt;not let an air elemental ambush you as you are running to retrieve your<br/>\n&gt;body.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Yilari<br/>\n&gt;Erollisi Marr </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
