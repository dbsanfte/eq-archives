Unfortunately, your way favors the first group over<br/>\nall others. The only BALANCED way to work a camped area is to rotate.<br/>\nSure, rare drops on rare spawns means that one group may get lucky and<br/>\nget that prized Rubicite Breastplate before the group that has been<br/>\nthere the longest, but then, they may not. That&#39;s called randomness. To<br/>\nprevent favoritism, rotating the kills is, imho, the only balanced<br/>\nmethod. Your path gives everything to the first group to get there.<br/>\nHardly fair. Especially if there is more than one mob spawning at a<br/>\nsite.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; To do it Brad&#39;s way, would mean that any player that didn&#39;t get an item<br/>\n&gt; while he/she was<br/>\n&gt; able to get exp from that particular mob could basically never get that item<br/>\n&gt; cause they could be<br/>\n&gt; thrown out of the camp spot everytime lower levels came along.  This is<br/>\n&gt; totally not fair.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I also agree with this. I don&#39;t think it is fair to kick higher levels<br/>\nout just because they are higher level. However, if they are preventing<br/>\nthe fair distribution of action at a site, then I believe they should<br/>\nvoluntarily offer to share the site, not leave it. If they continue to<br/>\nmonopolize the site, then I think that a request to leave is not<br/>\nunwarranted, even if it means they will have to come back to try for<br/>\nthat prized item. They&#39;d have precious little to complain about if they<br/>\nshared, rather than monopolized, the camped site.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Mik (who abhors discrimination or favoritism in any way, shape or form)<br/>\n </span></blockquote>(but who then advocates a method that is just as favoring and<br/>\ndiscriminating as Brad&#39;s)<br/>\n <br/>\n&lt;snipped orig message about higher levels yielding to lower levels just<br/>\nso lower levels can get xp&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nQanadar, Cleric of Tunare on Karana Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
