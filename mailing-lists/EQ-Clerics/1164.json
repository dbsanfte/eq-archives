However, what I would like to see<br/>\nadded to the Divine Aura line is maybe a running acceleration for 5<br/>\nor 10 seconds during the first part of DA.  <br/>\n  How many of you have casted DA only to crawl about 2 steps and<br/>\ndie, leaving your corpse in a worse situation than when you started?<br/>\nMost clerics usually have about a bub or less by the time they DA,<br/>\nand with that much health left, you basically walk when trying<br/>\nto run.  An extra burst of speed just for a few seconds would give<br/>\nus just a tad more chance of escaping or at least dying in a more<br/>\ncorpse &quot;friendly&quot; area. =)  <br/>\n<br/>\nJust a thought,<br/>\n //Aldaren<br/>\n   Follower of Rodcet Nife<br/>\n   Lvl35 on Tunare</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
