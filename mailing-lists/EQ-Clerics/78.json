At first i<br/>\n&gt; started thinking how can<br/>\n&gt; i do that. Then someone said that only halflings can<br/>\n&gt; charge them. So i never<br/>\n&gt; had the chance of trying it. The person who asked me<br/>\n&gt; to charge the ring<br/>\n&gt; thought i was a halfling :(. So can&#39;t clerics of any<br/>\n&gt; other race than<br/>\n&gt; halfling charge these rings?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;And eh, why the heck the cleric guild at Rivervale<br/>\n&gt; won&#39;t let me train my<br/>\n&gt; skills? I think i never did anything that could<br/>\n&gt; worsen my faction standing<br/>\n&gt; with them. So do i need to raise my faction standing<br/>\n&gt; with them before they<br/>\n&gt; will talk to me? Or is this similar case as when any<br/>\n&gt; Elf tries to trade with<br/>\n&gt; the Innkeeper at Kaladim (I think Irontoe something<br/>\n&gt; was his name) and he<br/>\n&gt; always turns them down. I&#39;m also having the same<br/>\n&gt; problem with the human<br/>\n&gt; clerics in Freeport. Do i really have to go all the<br/>\n&gt; way to Kaladim to be<br/>\n&gt; able to use my training points?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;With all the best to fellow Norrathian clerics,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Iyenya - Lvl 19 Dwarf cleric - Sons of Serilis<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Innoruuk server<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Got an opinion?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;Make it count!
