But I&#39;m not really wanting to<br/>\nrush to Lvl 50, I&#39;m just having fun and getting Lvl&#39;s when I get them, if I<br/>\ngot a Lvl everyday hey that&#39;d be cool with me if it took me many days to hit<br/>\nthe next Lvl thats cool.  I do wanna get up to Lvl 24 fast tho but not real<br/>\nfast, just wanna get it 24 so the look of my spells change.  I did find a<br/>\nplace that I can get nice exp (gotta be in a group of at least one or two<br/>\nmore), I like one in this area cause if it&#39;s more then 2 ppl in the group we<br/>\ndon&#39;t seem to get as much exp and it sux.  With me and my friend we get good<br/>\nexp but let one other join and that exp goes bye-bye.<br/>\nBut I think everyone should just take their time on getting to Lvl 50, cause<br/>\nwhat happens when you hit 50?  Thats it no more, I mean you can still play<br/>\nit but I&#39;d say after a while it&#39;s bound to get boring.  Can&#39;t Lvl anymore,<br/>\nwon&#39;t be getting any exp all you can do is get money and weapons and armor<br/>\nand hope Verant up&#39;s the Lvl limit.  But from what I&#39;ve read they don&#39;t even<br/>\nknow if they will up it at all.  In a way I think they should tho, I&#39;d say<br/>\nif they do it should be up to Lvl 75 to a 100 and thats all.  Of course once<br/>\nyou hit Lvl 50 you can start a new character or just work on one you already<br/>\nhave and get him/her to 50.<br/>\nBut I know some likes to play and get Lvl&#39;s fast some of us likes to play<br/>\nand get Lvl&#39;s just whenever.  So other words play it however you have the<br/>\nmost fun!  And enjoy the game!  =)<br/>\n<br/>\n**************************<br/>\nAzor<br/>\nLvl 16 Human Cleric of the Rathe<br/>\n**************************<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Mystik &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mystik@...\">mystik@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ok note to self.....17 lv 40-50&#39;s can&#39;t take on Lord Negafen without<br/>\n&gt; losing 2/3 of the ppl.....BUT we do plan on trying it again in a few<br/>\n&gt; weeks when more of us are lv 50....now my problem, how the heck to i get<br/>\n&gt; out of lv 40?? i&#39;m now a bar and a half into it, and i&#39;ve been on it for<br/>\n&gt; about 4 days now...THAT&#39;S how hard that lv is...and i&#39;ve been playing<br/>\n&gt; for about 8 hours + each time ):.....just to let you all know how hard<br/>\n&gt; those barrier lvs are (;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; (&#92;/)ystix Spellchaser<br/>\n&gt; lv 40 &lt;got hit 5 times by negafen and died inside his lair&gt;<br/>\n&gt; human cleric of The Rathe<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Attention ONElist list owners!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/info/news.html\">http://www.onelist.com/info/news.html</a><br/>\n&gt; Check out the new &quot;DEFAULT MODERATED STATUS&quot; option.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
