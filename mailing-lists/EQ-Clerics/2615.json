I really like<br/>\nUpper Guk, but there is kind of a hole at 24th level in Upper Guk.  My<br/>\nfriends all want to do Cazic Thule, but I find it so incredibly<br/>\nboring.  I was thinking Unrest, but I have so many bad memories of<br/>\nsuch bad trains there.  Seems like Runnyeye might be good, but not too<br/>\nfamiliar with it.  Not sure what levels of creatures are there.  Then<br/>\nthere is Borxx who could probably kick our ass.<br/>\n  Friend of mine suggested East Karana might be a good place to solo.<br/>\nSaid I could solo evil eyes there.  And as risky/exciting as that<br/>\nsounds, I don&#39;t think I could continue to get xp there until 29th.<br/>\n  Paw and Mistmoore are still too high/tough.  I heard Sol A might be<br/>\ngood, but I&#39;ve never been to Lavastorm, and worry about falling into<br/>\nlava as I&#39;ve heard you&#39;re oft to do when zoning into the place.  Maybe<br/>\ndark elf guards in Nektulos?  What level are griffons?  What level are<br/>\nthe giant skels in Rathe mountains?  Maybe pickclaws in highkeep?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone have any recommendations for either a group of low 20s, or for<br/>\nme to solo at 24?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance,<br/>\nErgo Soulhealer<br/>\ntest server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
