Everyone keep in mind that tactics vary depending on what level you are. ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-913331887\">That was a very good story and really good tactics for any clerics <br/>\n     around your level.<br/>\n     <br/>\n     Everyone keep in mind that tactics vary depending on what level you <br/>\n     are.<br/>\n     <br/>\n     If your below L20 it won&#39;t hurt to mele during battle since your mele <br/>\n     skills are still fairly adaquet (just as long as you don&#39;t forget you <br/>\n     are the healer of the group).<br/>\n     <br/>\n     Once you get to higher levels mele is effectively useless for a cleric <br/>\n     and is only something you do if you have full mana and no one needs a <br/>\n     heal.  Also taunting mobs on you is the last thing you want to do.  <br/>\n     I&#39;ve recently been doing a lot of fear/hate fighting and if you get <br/>\n     one of thoes mobs on you, unless your lucky enough to get a da/db off, <br/>\n     you can be dead in 3 seconds (130+ quad attacks hurt bad even with my <br/>\n     750+ ac and 1200+ hp).<br/>\n     <br/>\n     In Hate there is no running to the zone for safety and the strategy <br/>\n     used when a train is pulled is for the cleric to camp out asap (no <br/>\n     being the hero and staying to heal because it won&#39;t make a difference) <br/>\n     and live to be able to log back on in 5 min to rez everyone (it would <br/>\n     get very expensive if everyone had to be gated in after every train, <br/>\n     200+ plat a trip for the reagent).<br/>\n     <br/>\n     In Fear it&#39;s a little different.  Assuming you are able to run in to <br/>\n     the designated camp spot without dieing (2 for 3 on initial run in&#39;s) <br/>\n     clerics bind themselves there (can&#39;t bind in hate).  Corpse recovery <br/>\n     is a lot harder in fear due to mobs that teleport and fear you away <br/>\n     from the camp site (this also pulls trains).  We usually have monks <br/>\n     that pull the corpses back to the camp site for the clerics to rez.  I <br/>\n     have to admit it was kinda scay being bound in Fear the first time.  <br/>\n     If you are about to die you /q or hit the reset button on your comp <br/>\n     because you don&#39;t want to pop right back up in the middle of the <br/>\n     battle naked.<br/>\n     <br/>\n     Sorry, guess I kinda got off topic.  Anyway good post Daku.<br/>\n     <br/>\n     Drogo DarkBane<br/>\n     L50 Halfling Cleric<br/>\n     The Rathe</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
