Thanks<br/>\n<br/>\nSo lets get to it:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSPOILER<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTurgan the Reliant is in Lake Rathetear, from gnoll camp go east, first<br/>\nhouse on the left.<br/>\nPROBLEM: You need whatever it is from the hut in Kithicor before he will<br/>\ntalk to you.<br/>\nyou can ask him &quot;What is...(Turgan the Reliant, icon of the reliant, ingot<br/>\nof the reliant)&quot;<br/>\nand he comes back with, &quot; How do you know about.....I don&#39;t know what you<br/>\nare talking about. Go back to Kithicor!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy thinking is that the Shadowed men in Kithicor has it (a 25th +- monster),<br/>\nand we will find &quot;something.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nLianna Ferasa (the gypsy woman of Rathe Mtns, she is in gypsy camp by the<br/>\nlake entrance) sends you to North Karana to kill Zahal the Vile, and return<br/>\nher flute to her. Zahal is in the &quot;tree line in the east part of north<br/>\nkarana&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAll creatures seem to have a common drop item (albeit pretty cool ala the<br/>\nreed belt, Zahal dropa a SK belt), AND then a not so common Icon or Ingot<br/>\ndrop.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nhope this helps,<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJeff<br/>\nCadfael, Erollisi Marr & Xegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
