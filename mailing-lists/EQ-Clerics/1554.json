Our group<br/>\nalways seems to come back there for some reason. <br/>\nAlthough, we have had tons of close calls, I have<br/>\nfound this my very very very favorite place for<br/>\ngaining ooooooodles of experience.  I think the main<br/>\nthing is to have a very well balanced group.  At level<br/>\n17-19 we did mainly yard trash.  Death beetles,<br/>\nghouls, greater skeletons.  From 19-20, we did alot of<br/>\ndark bones and dry bones.  From 20 up (with a full<br/>\ngroup of course) we tackled hags and the occasional<br/>\nbarbed boned skeleton (they hit like a semi and if you<br/>\npull more than one, you might think about making a run<br/>\nfor zone).  Now, at nearly 28, there isnt much that we<br/>\ncant take.  Our group ranges from level 23 to 27 and<br/>\nwe can take on sizable trains.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs Anne Falbo-Ortiz (Topaaz) can tell you, she has had<br/>\nmany mis adventures in this zone.  But, for me, it is<br/>\nfun and I dont plan on leaving till level 29.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe main thing is, learn the ropes of the place.  Try<br/>\nto keep the same group and when looking for tanks,<br/>\nadvertise for one that is experienced in pulling. <br/>\nHopefully you&#39;ll get one.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTo this day, we still stand along the back wall while<br/>\nthe younger groups look up at us with awe in their<br/>\neyes. (I got a big head, so sue me).  They have become<br/>\nfamiliar with our group and know that if they end up<br/>\nin trouble they can ask us for help.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far every one of my &quot;gals&quot; (characters) have gone<br/>\nto unrest as soon as they earned the right of binding.<br/>\n<br/>\nSOrry for ramblin =)<br/>\n<br/>\nAdira Soulsaver<br/>\nBandaid of Tunare<br/>\n<br/>\n(hehe, watch.... i&#39;ll go to unrest tonight and die 30<br/>\ntimes just cuz of a swollen head)<br/>\n<br/>\n--- &quot;Sianne .&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:maggee1@...\">maggee1@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Sianne .&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:maggee1@...\">maggee1@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I was at Unrest at lvl 23 with a full group<br/>\n&gt; including a 2nd cleric.  The <br/>\n&gt; place was horrible.  Death after death after death. <br/>\n&gt; Between deaths and <br/>\n&gt; running to the zone there were no points made.  The<br/>\n&gt; only time we were there <br/>\n&gt; successfully was in a room (hand room) i think. <br/>\n&gt; Then shortly a high lvl <br/>\n&gt; cleric came in and ran us out....i am now almost lvl<br/>\n&gt; 27 and haven&#39;t been <br/>\n&gt; back yet.  I may try to go back soon though...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;William Hooker&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wahooker@...\">wahooker@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_CLERIC@...\">EQ_CLERIC@...</a>, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;Subject: [EQ-Clerics] Suggestions for high teen<br/>\n&gt; levels in unrest?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Date: Fri, 24 Sep 1999 07:52:25 EDT<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;William Hooker&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wahooker@...\">wahooker@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I have heard from many many people that unrest is a<br/>\n&gt; great place for a <br/>\n&gt; &gt;cleric<br/>\n&gt; &gt;to go starting around 14 or so.  I am 17th (almost<br/>\n&gt; 18th) and am having<br/>\n&gt; &gt;serious trouble there.  Last night 6 people from my<br/>\n&gt; guild were there, all<br/>\n&gt; &gt;15-20 and we had a rough time.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;We were at the back wall pulling from the back<br/>\n&gt; door.  We had SoW and invis<br/>\n&gt; &gt;to undead on the puller at all times, but there<br/>\n&gt; were many times where she<br/>\n&gt; &gt;ended up bringing quite a few too many ghouls. <br/>\n&gt; (tried to pull 1 and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;suddenly there were 7 of them on us!)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Are we hunting at too high a level, or are we<br/>\n&gt; pulling from the wrong place?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Or do we just suck?  We only had 2 deaths last<br/>\n&gt; night, but many many many<br/>\n&gt; &gt;close calls.  Lets just say thank god our druid was<br/>\n&gt; also saving 50% mana <br/>\n&gt; &gt;for<br/>\n&gt; &gt;heals.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Meddik<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Jaegergruppe<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Bristlebane<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Share your special moments with family and friends-<br/>\n&gt; send PHOTO Greetings<br/>\n&gt; at Zing.com!
