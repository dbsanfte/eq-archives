Last night Fennin Ro had OVER 1950 people<br/>\n&gt;on that ONE server!!!!!! They need to lock that server down completely and<br/>\n&gt;possibly move any level 10 and below character over to another server.<br/>\n&gt;Personally, I don&#39;t think ANY server should ave more than 500 people on it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>    I agree with others that Verant should not forcibly move people off a<br/>\nserver. I made good friends at level 5 and 6, fighting in the Orc camps<br/>\noutside Kelethin, and they are friends to this day. Would have hated to be<br/>\nmoved away from them. Closing down the server to newbies is also<br/>\nproblematic. I think the world works best when there are players of all<br/>\nlevels in it. Heck, if there are no younger players, whom am I supposed to<br/>\nsell all this ring I am getting in Unrest to? ;-) That would benefit the<br/>\npower-levelers, who would always have people below them to sell loot to, and<br/>\nhurt everyone else, who would not. Besides, having people of widely<br/>\ndifferent experience levels just makes for a more interesting world.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Also, they need to have more than one zone carry certain &#39;very saught&#39;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>after<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;items, such as Rubicite armor. Why does Cazic Thule have to be the only<br/>\n&gt;zone? Of COURSE there will be 70-100 people in the zone! Move the Ruby<br/>\n&gt;around...put some in Rathe Mountains, make a level 25+ zone on Erudin so<br/>\n&gt;Ruby can drop there....but not all in one zone. Look at the Journeyman<br/>\n&gt;boots. ONE NPC in the entire game has it, its a no drop item, meaning you<br/>\n&gt;have to loot it yourself. Why cant this npc drop it everytime to stop<br/>\n&gt;overcamping and people from Kill stealing? No, that would make way too much<br/>\n&gt;sense, I guess.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>     I agree with this. Every 10th level wants bronze, every 20th level<br/>\nwants rubicite. Therefore Unrest is jammed with the small races after small<br/>\nbronze, and Cazic is jammed with people after rubicite. We need these items<br/>\nmore widely distributed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Over camping and lagging CAN end if some of the ideas that so many have<br/>\n </span></blockquote>sent<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;in are implemented. But of course, that would cause Verant having to<br/>\n&gt;actually DO something...can&#39;t have that.
