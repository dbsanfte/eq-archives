I have just about crawled out<br/>\nof places like Befallen to sell every piece of junk I looted.  Even<br/>\nasking my team-members, &quot;if you don&#39;t want that trash, give it to me&quot;.<br/>\n  If you are 15th level, and are making 250 plat an hour, then Verant<br/>\nis obviously not aware of it, because that goes against the whole<br/>\nphilosophy of the game.  It simply was not designed so that 15th level<br/>\ncharacters have that much money.  So you&#39;re not cheating, fine.<br/>\n  Could you at least share with us the means by which you are getting<br/>\nthis money?  Is it a quest, or specific mob, are you auctioning stuff<br/>\noff, what?<br/>\n  Of course we&#39;re all accusatory, because we&#39;re all skeptical!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Ralph Carothers &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:CarothersR@...\">CarothersR@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;its lovely to see faith in mankind....i swear.....if someone learns how to <br/>\n&gt;do something that another doesnt know...and IS NOT exploting crap....its <br/>\n&gt;cheating right off the bat.  How about you try hunting things that drop <br/>\n&gt;items that if your quick enough...or bind at the right spot you can make <br/>\n&gt;some nice cash....and notice...i didnt say I was alone did I?<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;hey look...i finished this quest....or I did this and got an item NO ONE <br/>\n&gt;has seen. (aka- i&#39;ve just gotten a fiery avenger or something)  I&#39;d love to <br/>\n&gt;have people telling me i&#39;m exploiting something because I just got an item <br/>\n&gt;no one has....and I&#39;m sure you&#39;d be right there to line up with them.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;i DO NOT cheat at online games...or any type of roleplay....thanks for <br/>\n&gt;thinking that though.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Bann </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
