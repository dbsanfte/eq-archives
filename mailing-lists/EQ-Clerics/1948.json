You may be able<br/>\n&gt;      to get a decent weapon but when you only hit once every 10 swings the<br/>\n&gt;      damage doesn&#39;t add up very fast.  When I&#39;m in a group it&#39;s strictly<br/>\n&gt;      med and heal with maybe the odd stun thrown in.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;      As far as soloing goes, It can be done by a cleric fairly easily once<br/>\n&gt;      you hit L44 (power level for clerics imo).  I pretty much soloed from<br/>\n&gt;      47 to 50 by fighting spectres in oasis and oot as well as a few other<br/>\n&gt;      npc&#39;s.  I personally have no trouble pulling spectres single, have<br/>\n&gt;      never fought them in feerott though.  Experience had really started <br/>\n&gt;to<br/>\n&gt;      slow down from the dungeons and soloing was a nice change from the<br/>\n&gt;      med/heal routine.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;      As far as mana goes, my base wisdom is 105 and I am currently at 170<br/>\n&gt;      and should be able to get it to 190 before to long (still need a <br/>\n&gt;paw).<br/>\n&gt;       I can take out 2 spectres solo before I need to med and haven&#39;t had<br/>\n&gt;      much problems with mana when grouped.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;      Drogo Darkbane<br/>\n&gt;      The Rathe<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;______________________________ Reply Separator <br/>\n&gt;_________________________________<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] Mana<br/>\n&gt;Author:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] Mana at internet<br/>\n&gt;Date:    1999-09-19 8:00 AM<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: &quot;Mikaela&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mikaela@...\">mikaela@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hate to discourage you, but at higher levels, you will melee VERY little.<br/>\n&gt;Your value is healing and buffing.  And the damage you will be able to do<br/>\n&gt;against high level mobs is very minimal.  You will be fighting mobs with<br/>\n&gt;1000s of hps at high levels, and a lot of them have very high magic<br/>\n&gt;resistance, so your spells are useless cause they are resisted most always.<br/>\n&gt;And these mobs hit HARD...some for over 100 hps damage a pop.  You can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;survive at melee with these mobs, only the big tanks can.  You serve one<br/>\n&gt;purpose mainly, and that is healing to keep everyone alive. Regarding <br/>\n&gt;undead,<br/>\n&gt;  clerics used to be able to solo specs quite easily with undead spells, <br/>\n&gt;but<br/>\n&gt;they changed the pathing of them at the spec cave in Feerott and now it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;dangerous cause you can&#39;t really pull them solo anymore.  You pull one and<br/>\n&gt;two or three come, and that&#39;s BAD news.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Regarding the mana issue....you will need to get your hands on as many<br/>\n&gt;wisdom enhancing items as you can, because you will need all the mana you<br/>\n&gt;can get to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of your healing <br/>\n&gt;powers.<br/>\n&gt;The more mana you have the longer you can keep your group alive and the <br/>\n&gt;less<br/>\n&gt;med time you have.  So start amassing those wisdom items and try to get <br/>\n&gt;your<br/>\n&gt;wisdom at least up into the 170s minimum.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sorry to disillusion you, but high levels clerics are relegated mostly to<br/>\n&gt;healing and buffing and medding.  That&#39;s what your specialty is and at <br/>\n&gt;those<br/>\n&gt;levels, the other healing classes can&#39;t come close to our healing powers<br/>\n&gt;with our superior and complete heal.  The good news is that no high level<br/>\n&gt;group ventures anywhere without at least one good cleric.  YOu are a MUST<br/>\n&gt;have.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Mik<br/>\n&gt;----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt;From: Niomar &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Niomar@...\">Niomar@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sent: Tuesday, October 19, 1999 12:11 AM<br/>\n&gt;Subject: [EQ-Clerics] Mana<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Niomar&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Niomar@...\">Niomar@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Okay, I am now lvl 10 and really concerned about this.  From what <br/>\n&gt;EVERYONE<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tells me (which I totally disagree with and the whole subject matter <br/>\n&gt;makes<br/>\n&gt; &gt; me sick) is that when older (25+) all we do is heal...no melee, no DD,<br/>\n&gt;just<br/>\n&gt; &gt; heal and med.  First...is that true or can we still melee..I know we <br/>\n&gt;won&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; exactly be able to solo melee...but as in a group or possibly as the <br/>\n&gt;only<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tank?..and while on that subject, can we solo undead up into all our<br/>\n&gt;higher<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lvls or do we still need help then too?  And finally the mana issue.  I <br/>\n&gt;am<br/>\n&gt; &gt; dwarven cleric and have a 100 in strength and 103 in wisdom...will that <br/>\n&gt;be<br/>\n&gt;a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; high enough wisdom to have proper mana to heal my group and such?
