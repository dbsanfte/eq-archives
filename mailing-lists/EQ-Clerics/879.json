Its<br/>\n&gt;fast and uses little mana. He also has cure blindness and he would be<br/>\n&gt;stupid<br/>\n&gt;to not have it memorized. If he is a lower level it can last a<br/>\n&gt;reasonable<br/>\n&gt;time.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I was told by a friend who hunted in Runnyeye that Verant issued a patch<br/>\n&gt;that caused your ENTIRE screen to go black when you get blinded. I will<br/>\n&gt;have to try this on myself. Because if this is the case, then even<br/>\n&gt;though the troll shaman has me targeted, he will be unable to use his<br/>\n&gt;mouse to click his memorized spells. He WILL be able to cast spells IF<br/>\n&gt;he has hotkeyed them AND remembers which keyboard number goes to which<br/>\n&gt;spell....but I know for a fact that this shaman hasn&#39;t done that.<br/>\n&gt;So......It looks like I&#39;m going to be a Flash of Light caster on Sunday<br/>\n&gt;night at the PVP grounds in Neriak. Hmm....maybe I should first cast<br/>\n&gt;Invulnerability on myself to get him to waste his mana, then blast him<br/>\n&gt;with Flash of Light, and keep blasting him with it while I melee the<br/>\n&gt;crap out of him.....means that I&#39;m going to have to memorize extinguish<br/>\n&gt;fatigue as well, cause it&#39;s gonna take me FOREVER to melee him to death.<br/>\n&gt;And I should probably memorize Cancel magic in case he decides to root<br/>\n&gt;me....But someone said earlier that Cancel magic starts at the top of<br/>\n&gt;the stack. Why? That&#39;s where all MY buffs are! If I remember correctly<br/>\n&gt;(from Highpass and the gnoll shamans who cast root), I think Cancel<br/>\n&gt;magic starts at the bottom of the stack. Otherwise, it would be a<br/>\n&gt;worthless friggin spell, eh?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks for the suggestions so far...keep them coming...and let me know<br/>\n&gt;what you think of the Flash of Light strategy :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Saidinn<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;ONElist announces &quot;FRIENDS & FAMILY!&quot;<br/>\n&gt;For details, including our weekly drawing, go to<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html\">http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
