And<br/>\nso a group forms, and there is a spell-caster, and you and some tanks<br/>\nor a bard or rogue, or whatever.  And a PBB is found, and the whole<br/>\ngroup immediately says, &quot;Give it to the wizard.&quot;  Even though it is a<br/>\n+3 wis +3 int item that can benefit both of you equally.  And unless<br/>\nyou actually speak up and say something, they would just give it to<br/>\nthe wizard without a second thought on the matter.<br/>\n  Or you&#39;re a weakling high elf cleric and something like a purity<br/>\nbelt or studded leather collar comes up, and the fighter gets it, even<br/>\nthough it&#39;s everything you can do to keep from being encumbered and<br/>\nthat +1 strength would mean the difference between being encumbered or<br/>\nnot, and the fighter has a 120 strength already, and is never<br/>\nencumbered.  Why is that?<br/>\n  I find that a lot of my RL friends seem to be willing to go and get<br/>\nitems for each other, the poor cleric is always left in the dirt.  It<br/>\nseems like all my friends have something that was given to them by<br/>\nsomeone else, but all my stuff I had to earn.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not bitching per se, I was just wondering if anyone else had<br/>\nnoticed this phenomenon.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
