When they unstun they take some time<br/>\n&gt; to turn around to look for you, when you notice this, stun them again.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I reply:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m don&#39;t know if this is good advice. For one thing, the lower level<br/>\n&gt; stun lasts only two seconds. By the time you&#39;ve run around the caster,<br/>\n&gt; he&#39;s not stunned anymore. For another thing, the recast time for stun is<br/>\n&gt; very long. And, if the caster is smart, he won&#39;t turn around to find<br/>\n&gt; you. He should already have you targeted, and he&#39;ll just hit his cast<br/>\n&gt; button. He doesn&#39;t have to see you to cast a spell. And, if you&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; dueling, he should realize that you won&#39;t be outside his casting range.<br/>\n&gt; I think Flash of Light would yield better results. It lasts much longer<br/>\n&gt; (12-18 seconds, I think), and he cannot cast while blinded. If you want<br/>\n&gt; to confuse your opponent even more, cast Fear on him after you&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; blinded him. He&#39;ll never know what hit him.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This from having dueled nasty necros in Lake Rathe. They really hated it<br/>\n&gt; when I Feared them, heh heh.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Saidinn Witchwood<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;              Free Games & Cash Prizes!<br/>\n&gt; Gamesville - The World&#39;s Biggest & Best Game Show Site!<br/>\n&gt;         <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/ad/gamesville0\">http://www.onelist.com/ad/gamesville0</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
