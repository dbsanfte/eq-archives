Sorry if &gt;I&#39;m ignorant <br/>\n&gt;here, but those numbers just seem out of place of &gt;everthing I&#39;ve seen<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I would like to hear what your findings in this area are, What is so <br/>\nunbalanced as you see it.  I only have me and my tanks to compare to.  I <br/>\nhave 100 points worth of wisdom items that I wear regularly or thereabouts.  <br/>\nwhen I wear the Quest BP and Legs and buff myself I have had my AC up to <br/>\n741( I think I also had feet like cat)  The ranger is wearing Ranger quest <br/>\narmor, exehood, thorny vine boots, hero bracer, not sure what else.  The <br/>\npaladin is wearing azure sleeves, silver-plated legs, hero bracer, serp <br/>\nbracer ( i think) umm some black chestpiece not sure which one it is.  <br/>\nPallys AC is higher than the rangers typically.  My Buff gives an added 31 <br/>\nAC(sheild of words)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me also clarify that I feel for the paladins not because of their quest <br/>\narmor, but the general problems that the class has.  My friend is a level 47 <br/>\npally, I have grouped with him everyday since level 7.  He has gone from a <br/>\nviable tank to a standby meleeist.  His lay hands doesn&#39;t work half the time <br/>\nwhen you need it to and in a big fight he is lucky if he does 300 total <br/>\ndamage to one mob, whereas our ranger(who I have also grouped with since lvl <br/>\n7) does in excess of 700 to 800 points of damage per mob.  He feels, as well <br/>\nas, many other paladins of his level, that he is less than effective to <br/>\ngroup with. ( I personally wouldn&#39;t trade him for the world).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThey have even taken many many hours to compare damage and rates of contact <br/>\nas opposed to misses and such, still the paladin Always falls short, always, <br/>\nthey have tried raising AC, then raising Dex, agi, etccc. str, whatever, <br/>\nalso different combos of higher stats, the paladins can never measure up in <br/>\ncombat, no matter what they have tried.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t find your response to me a flame, i value hearing other peoples <br/>\nopinions, I just look at the classes as whole varied spectrum and feel that <br/>\nthe clerics are the last ones who should be complaining at this point.  <br/>\nPaladins and shadowknights are starving for help, they are not as formidable <br/>\nat the higher level ranks.  Paladins have to do these extensive quests which <br/>\nrequire hours of research to get a less than par weapon ( i.e. Soulfire - <br/>\nPeople this weapon sucks compared to a mithril 2hander......Ghoulbane is <br/>\ngood in certain situations i will agree on that) all of that hard work, <br/>\ndedication, patience, just so they can feel even worse about themselves when <br/>\nthey finally achieve it.  Suffice to say, our pally has started a monk now, <br/>\nwhich our group does really need, to work the planes and pull big mobs, so <br/>\nas I am sad that our fearless leader pally will be gone, I am happy he is <br/>\nnot going to give up completely and try to continue on with a new character.<br/>\n<br/>\nBree Wyndsdale</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
