Like since I&#39;m still lvl 15 (should hit Lvl 16<br/>\nsometime today), if casted it on me I would not get much exp back but if you<br/>\ncasted it on a played say that was Lvl 45 they&#39;d get a good bit back.<br/>\nSo I take it you finally got you one of those Staff of the Observer you&#39;ve<br/>\nbeen wanting forever.  Hope you like it and congrats on Lvl 40.  Why is Lvl<br/>\n40 gonna suck by the way?  Is it like Lvl 20 when ya die you lose close to a<br/>\nbubble of exp?  If thats why then I guess on Lvl 40 you what lose close to<br/>\ntwo bubbles of exp?<br/>\n<br/>\n**************************<br/>\nAzor<br/>\nLvl 15 Human Cleric of the Rathe<br/>\n**************************<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: Mystik &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mystik@...\">mystik@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; actually, that does make a lot of sense.....it would seem that hte higher<br/>\n </span></blockquote>lv you<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; are, the more exp you can give back.....i just know now that i have to go<br/>\n </span></blockquote>thru<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; hell all over again....lv 40&#39;s gonna SUCK majorly......o btw, i have a<br/>\n </span></blockquote>question<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; about the staff of the observer while i&#39;m thinking about it....it has one<br/>\n </span></blockquote>charge<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; of the sentinel spell....&lt;which is a crock ir should be unlimited like the<br/>\n&gt; jboots&gt; but is there anyway to recharge it or maybe does it recharge on<br/>\n </span></blockquote>it&#39;s own<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &lt;that was suggested to me by a guildmate&gt; or do i just have to get a new<br/>\n </span></blockquote>staff?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; which would suck there too....any info would be greatly appreciated on<br/>\n </span></blockquote>this...i<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; love that staff, and the sentinel effect was really kewl and would come in<br/>\n </span></blockquote>handy<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; in places like cazic and lower guk....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; (&#92;/)ystix Spellchaser<br/>\n&gt; lv 40 cleric of The Rathe </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
