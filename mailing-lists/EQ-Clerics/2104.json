All good<br/>\nclerics should try to get their dex up to 85, if not 100.<br/>\n<br/>\nReasoning, after you cast your first &quot;real&quot; heal (greater heal for 280+ hp)<br/>\nmost monsters will attack you. DEX will allow you to cast while being hit<br/>\n(it helps your channeling).<br/>\n<br/>\nJeff<br/>\nCadfael, EM</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
