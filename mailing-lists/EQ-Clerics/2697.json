Are high elf clerics the lowest leveling race/class in the game?<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d heard that at least high elves leveled about the slowest, and my<br/>\n&gt; observations seem to lend itself to that assumption.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDunno, sorry<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; 2. I&#39;ve got all the pieces for my caduceus of the sacrement.  The<br/>\n&gt; thing from Mistmoore, the piece from the darkbone giant skel, and two<br/>\n&gt; plat bars.  When I go to Ro temple, and I give the bars to the person<br/>\n&gt; to magnetize them, do I give them 1 bar at a time?  Also, do I give<br/>\n&gt; all 4 things to the person (is it Gavel?) at the same time, with the<br/>\n&gt; 2 bars in each box, filling up the 4 total slots (bar, bar, ingot,<br/>\n&gt; icon)?  I don&#39;t want to screw it up!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nTo magnetize/vulcanize/galvanize the bars, you find the correct NPC and hand<br/>\nthe bars over ONE AT A TIME.  You can find out who you need to see by asking<br/>\n&quot;What about Galvanized?&quot;, etc. to the original quest giver.  When turning in<br/>\nall the pieces to the quest giver, make sure the bars are NOT stacked, and<br/>\neach of the 4 boxes has an item.  Also make sure you have an open inventory<br/>\nslot.....you&#39;ll really like that mace, it is great for a one handed weapon.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; 3. Is Aviak Isle a good place to solo at 26th level?  I just made 26th<br/>\n&gt; and while I don&#39;t know if I can take gull or not, I&#39;d like to give it<br/>\n&gt; the ol&#39; college try (if I see him).  But I&#39;m curious if I could solo<br/>\n&gt; here with relative safety.  I&#39;d hate to pull one blue and have 14<br/>\n&gt; birds jump me, with nowhere to run to. How does one leave this island?<br/>\n&gt; Gate away?  Is this the island right near the Butcherblock pier?  Any<br/>\n&gt; solo&#39;ing tips here are appreciated.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou should be able to pull to the very shore of the island with little<br/>\nchance of a wanderer diving in, that is what I did.  To get off the island,<br/>\nyou can gate or swim to one of the two islands that the boats stop at and<br/>\nthen re-board the boat to either BB or FP.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ergo Soulhealer<br/>\n&gt; 26th level high elf cleric<br/>\n&gt; test server<br/>\n&gt; guildmaster, Hand of Tunare<br/>\n&gt; ______________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ATTENTION ONElist MEMBERS: Get your ONElist news!<br/>\n&gt; Join our MEMBER NEWSLETTER here:<br/>\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/Teaser128\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/Teaser128</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
