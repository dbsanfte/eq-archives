Well, kinda......<br/>\n<br/>\nI had given up and my ogre shaman buddy and I had left the island empty<br/>\nhanded after killing at least 300 aviaks over two days.  We hit Dagnor&#39;s to<br/>\nget a cauldron shell from a goblin tidal lord which took only 30 minutes (at<br/>\nleast shaman get XP while questing, feh).  My ogre friend caught the boat<br/>\nbought back to Freeport to get his second totemic bracer and I hit Kaladim<br/>\nto get some Tumpy Tonics in preparation for SOME DAY finishing the arms<br/>\nquest.  I got on the boat to head back to Freeport but decided to hop off<br/>\nand swim back to aviak island by myself for one last look.<br/>\n<br/>\nI found several folks there (druid and ranger) merrily killing aviaks for XP<br/>\nand no faction hit.  I buffed them and we chatted for a bit, they told me<br/>\nthat Gull must be a myth.  They had been there off and on for two weeks and<br/>\nnot seen him, and knew several high level clerics that had camped the island<br/>\nfor 3-4 days with no sign of Gull.  I got rather discouraged at that point<br/>\nand decided that the Gull spawn must be broken and hoped it would be fixed<br/>\nin the patch on Wednesday.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was bound on Errolisi island, so I gated and took the LONG round trip back<br/>\nto Freeport.  As I was running from Freeport to HH Pass to find Jovan with<br/>\nmy Tumpy Tonics to do the other part of the arms quest, the druid on aviak<br/>\nisland sent me a tell and said that Gull had just spawned.  I begged him to<br/>\nleave the ingot if it dropped, and gated back to Errolisi island (luckily I<br/>\nforgot to bind myself when I got back to Freeport).  After paying a troll<br/>\nshaman (who was killing NPCs on Errolisi island) for SOW and a levitate I<br/>\nran over to aviak island.  The druid and ranger had to kill Gull because he<br/>\nattacked them while they were fighting a quetzel, but Gull dropped the ingot<br/>\nand they left it for me.  Gull apparently is around 25th level.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo Gull is not a myth, but a VERY RARE spawn.  Hope this help you folks out,<br/>\nI consider myself EXTREMELY lucky to get that ingot.  It was very late at<br/>\nthis point and after ANOTHER long round trip boat ride I could not find<br/>\nJovan in HH keep so I camped, hopefully I get my arms tonight.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow where is that gnome necro Babbin-whatever.......<br/>\n<br/>\nDweezeman Dourbough<br/>\n30th human cleric, E&#39;Ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Clay Armstrong &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:claya@...\">claya@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, November 01, 1999 11:20 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] Gull Skytalon<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Clay Armstrong&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:claya@...\">claya@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The birds con low green to me (starlings/turacos/tanagers) with the<br/>\n&gt; occasional blue quetzel.
