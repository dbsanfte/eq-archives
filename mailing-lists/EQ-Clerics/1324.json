One thing I would request of my fellow priests of light and darkness is to *please* cut out all unnecessary parts of previous posts when replying.  I am a digest reader, and today I recieved a 1/4 megabyte digest.  The substance of the digest was about 3-5 new messages, and many many people debating the proposed new camping rules without removing the e-baggage.  This is rude for people that use slower modem connections. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your time, this isn&#39;t supposed to be a firestarter. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nDevotion<br/>\nBishop of Rodcet Nife<br/>\nPovar</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
