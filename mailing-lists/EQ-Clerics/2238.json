My old cleric is a high elf female.  I am torn<br/>\nbetween restarting as a dark elf or stick with the high elf.  Which in<br/>\ny&#39;all&#39;s opinion...looks better?  I have never seen a dark elf in the purple<br/>\narmor...do they look silly?  Does the purple make em look like a blueberry<br/>\nand grape mix?  I have never seen a dark elf in the yellow quest armor as<br/>\nwell.  I do like the way the dark elf females look but given the color<br/>\nscheme I might not be able to live with myself if the color is too much of<br/>\nan offense to my fashion sense =).  The only thing I do not like about the<br/>\nhigh elf females is the face...they look too haughty. Although I have to<br/>\nadmit that plate armor looks really good on the females.  However, another<br/>\nreluctance is the fact that there just seems to be more high elves cleric<br/>\nthen dark elves...yeah I know the stat is better...but I want to look my<br/>\nbest as well and be unique ;)  Anyway advise is appreciated...thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are female characters I am talking about.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Imogen</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
