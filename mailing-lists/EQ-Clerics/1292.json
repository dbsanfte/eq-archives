It is probably worth more than it seems. Similar<br/>\nweapons for pure casters (e.g. Water Crystal staff) I&#39;ve seen selling for<br/>\n100pp+. The SSoL is basically a mediocre weapon, but with a pretty useful<br/>\neffect. Many clerics cannot do the quest (or don&#39;t want to spend time<br/>\nbuilding faction). To them, it may be fairly desirable.<br/>\n<br/>\nI traded my first one to a lvl 30 Teir&#39;dal cleric in return for a pair of<br/>\ncrested spaulders (AC11, +6sta), and I think I got the better deal.
