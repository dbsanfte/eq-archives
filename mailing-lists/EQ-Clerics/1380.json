It is pretty pointless to try and develop a &quot;fighter/healer&quot; type,<br/>\nbecause around level 25 it stops working and only gets worse with levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nAstur il&#39;Ayan, Cleric of Brell<br/>\nSolusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Kevin Dailey &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Kevin_Dailey@...\">Kevin_Dailey@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have the opportunity to buy items off Ebay that would give me<br/>\n&gt; outstanding stats as far as strength, agility and dexterity go. I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; talking 115 str, 130 dex and 125 agi (and 85 sta), all wearable at the<br/>\n&gt; same time. However, my wisdom would be only 105.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On the other hand, I also have the opportunity to buy wisdom items that<br/>\n&gt; would increase my wisdom by 35 points (to about 136). Which path should<br/>\n&gt; I follow? Some people argue that high level clerics CAN melee, while<br/>\n&gt; others argue that at high levels, clerics should concentrate on their<br/>\n&gt; healing and buffing skills. &quot;After all, if you wanted to be a warrior,<br/>\n&gt; you should have been one.&quot; Yeah, yeah, heard that, been there. With the<br/>\n&gt; right equipment, though (Jboots, a flowing black sash of haste, an<br/>\n&gt; observer&#39;s staff, etc.), a cleric should be able to hold his or her own<br/>\n&gt; in combat, even after level 35.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Any suggestions, comments, advice before I commit to one group of items<br/>\n&gt; or the other?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Saidinn Witchwood<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
