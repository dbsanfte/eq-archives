In playing this<br/>\ngame for like forever it seems, I have learned through experience, such as<br/>\nthe ones you have learned the other night, on how to tell which group would<br/>\ndo ok and which would not. Learn to read the sign, and if any alarm bells<br/>\ngoes off....take my advise, ditch the group or you would end up loosing exp,<br/>\nand gained a huge headache...without fail.  Let me point out all the things<br/>\nthat have set off my alarm bells as I read your post.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Anyways, we have 2 bards, an enchanter, a pally, and 2 clerics.  So we<br/>\n&gt; start.  I am nominated as the puller, which i don&#39;t like, but<br/>\n&gt; what the heck.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Casters and healers should never pull (not if there is a tank in the group).<br/>\nThey are not meant to take alot of damage.  They do not have as much hit<br/>\npoints as tanks.  This was not a good choice.  The pally should have pulled.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So i pull the first few mobs.  Each time, we kill something, I immediately<br/>\n&gt; here the &#39;ching-ching&#39; sound (looting) and see i receive a split of the<br/>\n&gt; money.  Of course, this is happening during the fighting,<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>A big no no in group etiquette.  Anyone who loots before the mob even hits<br/>\nthe group is begging to become groupless in high lvl.  My opinion on people<br/>\nwho jump loots or is a loot hogger is this, they are out for<br/>\nthemselves...don&#39;t trust them at your back.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So we pull more, and of course, more looting during fighting occurs.  This<br/>\n&gt; time I am more adament about the looting.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I would have just gotten down right rude on the offender(s) by this time.  I<br/>\nwould also have said that if this keeps up then I would kick them out.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But the healing is about to end (oom) and we (the<br/>\n&gt; clerics) yell RUN-ZONE.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Of course no one listens, they keep fighting, the clerics make it out, two<br/>\n&gt; of the group die, and the others limp out with a bubble each.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We get blasted by the group... Why didn&#39;t you heal, you should<br/>\n&gt; have had your<br/>\n&gt; act together...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You know, if I was you, I would have gotten that headache by now.  For<br/>\nanyone to yell at the clerics when they have already said OOM, ZONE,<br/>\nRUN...well, the whole thing is idiotic.  This basically say that these<br/>\npeople have NO grouping exp what-so-ever.  I never like to play teacher (at<br/>\nleast not to loot hoggers)...would have dump the group right there and then.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So we regroup, and go back in.  Another train, this time the enchanter<br/>\n&gt; decides he&#39;ll play tank when he goes OOM. We tell him to back off, but no,<br/>\n&gt; he stays and fights, causing the clerics to wast mana on him for<br/>\n&gt; heals.  He<br/>\n&gt; died, and of course, blames us.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>He&#39;ll learned.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nReally, the basic problem here is that not everyone in this group knows<br/>\ntheir role.  People really need to learn their role.  Especially at high<br/>\nlvl.  A nuking healer, a meleeing casters, a  tank who does not<br/>\npull/taunt...would all put a group in serious jeopardy at higher lvl....and<br/>\nit&#39;s a good way to make some bad reputation for yourself.  Learn to be a<br/>\ngood team player...ppl would invite you more often into groups.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll tell you this, I now know who<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; not to group<br/>\n&gt; with in Unrest, or anywhere else for that matter.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote> Yeah, smart of you.  See what I mean about reputation?<br/>\n<br/>\n-Imogen</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
