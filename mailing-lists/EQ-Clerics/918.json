At the guild <br/>\n&gt;shop I noticed so many classes of spells...attack spells, healings spells, <br/>\n&gt;and other spells were all handled by different NPC&#39;s.  I&#39;ll be spending A <br/>\n&gt;LOT of money on spells.  I do have a minor gripe with clerics, though.  <br/>\n&gt;They just don&#39;t have enough total mana, and the Minor Healing spell isn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt;strong enough.  I was grouped up with a Warrior and after wasting all of my <br/>\n&gt;mana healing him four times, only half of his health had grown back.  <br/>\n&gt;Clerics need more mana!  What do you think?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Albus the Cleric, on The Tribunal Server </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
