When fighting really high level<br/>\ncreatures (planes, dragons, etc), the time it takes to cast atone, you could<br/>\nprobably already be dead or well on your way.  I use seldomly have it<br/>\nmemorized during these times, however, I have tried this: When fighting one<br/>\ncreature, you could potentially cast a heal, atone the creature, cast a<br/>\nheal, atone the creature therefore wiping it&#39;s memory, any ever tried this?<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Sirensa Qi&#39;Seraph [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sirensa@...\">Sirensa@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, January 14, 2000 8:42 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] Seeking advice...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Sirensa Qi&#39;Seraph&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sirensa@...\">Sirensa@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding Atone:<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t bother using it in between heals for a number of reasons:<br/>\n1)  You will aggro again as soon as you heal<br/>\n2)  If you tanks know their job they will taunt mobs off you if you are<br/>\nattacked<br/>\n3)  Recharge time on atone is pretty long<br/>\n4)  Mana is better saved for heals<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your tanks are NOT doing the job of taunting off of you, it may be<br/>\nbecause they are not watching group health bars.  Try making a hot key that<br/>\nsays something in groupsay to notify them you are being attacked.  Also, you<br/>\ncan cast Divine Aura on yourself (briefly making you invulnerable).  This<br/>\nworks effectively as an anti-taunt ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding Naltron:<br/>\n<br/>\nGet PP or gems from your tanks if you are running out of Peridots.  Or don&#39;t<br/>\ncast it on them :)<br/>\n<br/>\n~Sirensa<br/>\nSolusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nGet great offers on top-notch products that match your interests!<br/>\nSign up for eLerts at:<br/>\n&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/elerts1\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/elerts1</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
