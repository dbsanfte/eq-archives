So I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; think that has much to do with it.  And I&#39;d say at this point if it&#39;s not<br/>\n&gt; been fixed by Verant, I&#39;m personally not holding my breath to see<br/>\n&gt; it happen.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lohre Soulsaver<br/>\n&gt; Bristlebane<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
