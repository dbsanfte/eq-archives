I&#39;ve often wondered what exactly it means to be a cleric in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Norrath.  My personal opinion is that we should always be merciful to <br/>\n&gt;those<br/>\n&gt; &gt; around us, and help in any way we can.  Even if to heal someone we don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt;even<br/>\n&gt; &gt; know completely depletes our mana.  What do you think of this?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Perhaps that is what Karana asks of you.<br/>\n&gt;But Innoruk is the God of Hate and Pain. Pain is real. You can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;avoid it. of all the gods, he is the only one honest with his followers.<br/>\n&gt;He WANTS us killing everything. So why should I use the powers he gives<br/>\n&gt;me on those who do not followhim, and will actively work against him?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Create a list for FRIENDS & FAMILY...<br/>\n&gt;...and YOU can WIN $100 to Amazon.com.
