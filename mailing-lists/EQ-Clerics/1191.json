Tailoring seems too boring.  Though I am only at lvl 11, so I am<br/>\nstill scrimping and saving for those spells/armour combos.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOne way I have been able to come by money really has to do with &#39;geography&#39;.<br/>\nBeing a halfling in Rivervale, I have met many higher level characters.<br/>\nRivervale seems to be a crossroads.  So there are always many people there<br/>\nto sell loot to, to beg from, and to generally get good buffs from.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn contrary, I played a DE cleric in neriak, and barely ever had enough<br/>\nmoney to buy food.  As well, I&#39;ve played a human cleric in Qeynos, with much<br/>\nthe same results.<br/>\n<br/>\nL8R<br/>\nBrytewing, 3rd Circle cleric of Bristlebane<br/>\nThe Rathe Server.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Deane, Ben [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:BDeane@...\">BDeane@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: 1999/09/09 12:16 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [EQ-Clerics] Trade skills (was: Smithing (was: Dress Up<br/>\nWear) )<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Deane, Ben&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:BDeane@...\">BDeane@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNoted, good idea. But it&#39;s still the case that on the older servers, people<br/>\nare skipping straight to bronze, or receiving very underpriced banded from<br/>\nhigher-level friends who don&#39;t need it, or whatever. The market for banded<br/>\nis getting younger and younger, and hence people expect banded for cheaper<br/>\nand cheaper just because they don&#39;t have that kind of money to spend.<br/>\nAlso, of the friends that I group with regularly, only 1 can wear banded who<br/>\nhasn&#39;t already got it :-(<br/>\n<br/>\nBut let&#39;s not go too far into a smithing discussion...<br/>\n<br/>\nA question:<br/>\nDespite clerics traditionally being a poor class, I suspect that many<br/>\nclerics do one or more trade skills... Anyone? My favourite is baking<br/>\nbecause you can cook on the move.<br/>\n<br/>\nElbeno<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: AoS/Aosinator &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:darshan@...\">darshan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Actually I&#39;m quite serious.  If ye need to armor 3 or 4 <br/>\n&gt; players, and they<br/>\n&gt; are willing to pay for the base costs of the materials, you <br/>\n&gt; could easily<br/>\n&gt; gain enough skill to make banded reliably.  I estimate it would take<br/>\n&gt; roughly 250 to 300 platinum pieces to bring smithing up to the level<br/>\n&gt; necessary to create Banded.  With 3 or 4 people, that comes <br/>\n&gt; out to 75 to<br/>\n&gt; 100pp each for banded.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nWIN a trip to Hawaii!<br/>\nEnter ONElist&#39;s Hawaiian Sweepstakes.
