Pallys have the highest hp next to <br/>\n     warriors (can buff them over 2000) and can do good damage with the <br/>\n     right equip.  My friend has a haste sash and uses the holy water <br/>\n     sprinkler mace from the plane of hate (killer 1h blunt weapon that <br/>\n     clerics can&#39;t use :( ).  High level tanks aren&#39;t meant to deal out a <br/>\n     lot of damage, they are meant to absorb it while magic users decimate <br/>\n     the mobs with spells.  In Hate and Fear it&#39;s always the group with the <br/>\n     most magic users (necro&#39;s especially) that end up getting the kills.<br/>\n     <br/>\n     I know when I play with my pally friend he may not deal out the damage <br/>\n     as fast as some other classes but he can stand in there and take the <br/>\n     hits with the best of them.  With a cleric throwing complete heals a <br/>\n     pally can stand in the battle a very long time and deal out or allow <br/>\n     others to deal out a lot of damage.<br/>\n     <br/>\n     Besides, who doesn&#39;t like a little help healing others up after the <br/>\n     battle is finished.<br/>\n     <br/>\n     I also have a friend who is a L50 shadowknight and the same thing goes <br/>\n     for them (except the healing).  The other day we were out in ocean of <br/>\n     tears killing Seafury Cyclopes by ourselves.  These things have over <br/>\n     3k hp and are L39-42 or so.  We could kill one with me only using 1 <br/>\n     1/2 bubbles of mana which equates to about 2 complete heals while <br/>\n     meding through the battle.  Does this sound like they can&#39;t deal out <br/>\n     damage? (was useing a mirthil 2 hander)<br/>\n     <br/>\n     <br/>\n     Drogo Darkbane<br/>\n     L50 Halfling Cleric<br/>\n     The Rathe</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
