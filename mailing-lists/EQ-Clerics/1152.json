Doesn&#39;t make ANY<br/>\nsense to me, much less total as it does to you. If you have been given the<br/>\nability by the gods to put a &quot;divine&quot; shield around yourself and make<br/>\nyourself invulnerable from being hit, then you shouldn&#39;t be able to be<br/>\nstunned because the critter MUST hit you to stun you.  Quite simply, you<br/>\ncan&#39;t get stunned if you can&#39;t get hit.  Now, if they would&#39;ve said Divine<br/>\nAura is strictly a spell to prevent you from taking any DAMAGE from a hit<br/>\nbut not to prevent you from BEING hit, then that is different.<br/>\n<br/>\n But in my opinion, if we have the ability to cloak ourselves from damage,<br/>\nit should include ALL damage, including stuns.  Because stun to me IS a form<br/>\nof damage even though it does not reduce your hps.  It renders you incapable<br/>\nof moving, which to me, is STILL a type of damage. Just like the blinding<br/>\nlight spell.....its effects, aka damage, aren&#39;t reflected in loss of hps but<br/>\nit DOES damage to you by rendering you incapable of seeing.<br/>\n<br/>\nMik</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
