Ro and have had DE&#39;s in my party and we have treated each other as<br/>\nequals.   I also had a Troll stop and bind the wounds on my monk once.  I<br/>\nguess it is really all in the way you treat this game.  I know that I play<br/>\nmy paladin a lot different than I do my cleric and ranger.  My paladin has<br/>\nleft groups when a necro or SK joined.   Kinda snobbish if you ask me but<br/>\nthat is the way this paladin is.<br/>\n<br/>\nEach member of the party needs to do what they can do best to ensure the<br/>\nsurvival and growth of all.  Tanks should fight, nukers should nuke and<br/>\nclerics can fight and heal when needed.  I know that I save my mana for a<br/>\nfew buffs but mostly for healing.  It really is nice to get in a group that<br/>\nunderstands that our need to med to regain our mana.  I just love to have a<br/>\nbard in the party to aid in the healing process also.  If a tank is hurt bad<br/>\nI can get them back to 90% and med back up and let the bard&#39;s song do the<br/>\nrest.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 12 I am just now starting to see people begin to work together more as a<br/>\nteam and not as a bunch of individuals.  If someone does something that<br/>\nhurts the team then they are told very politely what they did wrong and how<br/>\nto avoid that in the future.  Then of course I am seeing a lot more of what<br/>\nI consider kill stealing also now.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really got ticked off today.   I was on the flats in N. Ro soloing and was<br/>\njumped by a madman.   It was a very close fight but he killed me and I had<br/>\nhim down to about a half bubble.   What frosted me though was that another<br/>\ncharacter just stood there and watched even though I asked a couple of times<br/>\nfor help.   When I went down unconcious he started to attack to get the easy<br/>\nexperience.    To me this is the worst kind of behavior possible but I guess<br/>\nI will have to learn to live with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again all for all your help and advice,<br/>\nWalt for Yilari<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Martyn Adams &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:martyn-adams@...\">martyn-adams@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As a lvl 35 DE cleric on Erollisi Marr I don&#39;t agree.. we heal the<br/>\n&gt; warriors of Innoruuk so they may harm our enemies... it&#39;s a basic cleric<br/>\n&gt; principle.. heal the tanks because they can do more damage than we can..<br/>\n&gt; even &#39;good race&#39; clerics know that.. (well those not trying to be a<br/>\n&gt; wizard do).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; All races need their medics and we are our races healers.. we promote<br/>\n&gt; pain through extending the life of those more suited to causing pain..<br/>\n&gt; our heals cause our enemies to hate us.. kinda apt really..<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Dark Elf Clerics do make sense.. you just have to look at it the right<br/>\n&gt; way..
