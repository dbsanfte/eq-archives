When you work hard for<br/>\nsomething be it fighting or developing trades its annoying (to me) to have<br/>\nsomeone bother me for free stuff. However I give lots of stuff away and<br/>\nreally enjoy buffing/healing characters lower than me that do not ask for<br/>\naid. Except when they are dying, I find that kind of asking for help very<br/>\nsensible strategy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI once blinded a character (wiz) who was level 8 and begging me and<br/>\nincessantly others. I was 11 at the time. I did it in character of course<br/>\nwhich made me feel better about it.....<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Begone you worthless serpent until you see the light of<br/>\nTunare&quot;....BLIND....<br/>\n<br/>\nWiz runs of screaming....&quot;I&#39;m being K&#39;d ....I&#39;m being PK&#39;d.....&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNynenom of Rallos Zek<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Heather Daley [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:blushn@...\">blushn@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, September 09, 1999 10:01 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] What do you think of begging (not the skill)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Heather Daley&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:blushn@...\">blushn@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAhhh not sure how yall are going to react with this one, but I have some <br/>\nvery strong feelings on this issue. I believe they stem from me having <br/>\nstarted playing way back when the game was first released.<br/>\n<br/>\nI despise Beggars....I have always been a helpful person, but the biggest <br/>\nmistake you can make with me is to beg.<br/>\n<br/>\nI started out in this game with nothing just like the rest of you, Some <br/>\npeople call me bitter, which is not the case, i am a very happy player, i <br/>\nenjoy this game quite a bit, but I have a sense of value for items, I <br/>\nEARN(not by Buying or begging) ALL of my equipment, I have never asked <br/>\nanyone for anything and never will. I wore Patchwork, yes patchwork leather <br/>\nuntil I was lvl 20, yes 20, I remember having only 6gp and I bought a PW <br/>\ntunic for 4, dropped the tunic and was SOL.  I was never able to buy all my <br/>\nspells at early levels right when I was able to use them, i had to buy a few<br/>\n<br/>\nat a time, I used a hammer of wrath until I was lvl 20 and my husband had <br/>\ngiven me a screaming Mace which I used up til I was high enough level to <br/>\nkill the savant and get a black enamelled one.  I Appreciate all the items <br/>\nthat I have, I don&#39;t get items that I cannot use, I don&#39;t overcamp places to<br/>\n<br/>\nget mega quantities of items.  I don&#39;t buy items, money means nothing in <br/>\nthis game. There is nothing I hate more than to have a group with one caster<br/>\n<br/>\nwho already has a SMR camping the Arch Magi.<br/>\nI am begged on a daily basis and when Someone begs from me, they are damn <br/>\nwell not gonna get a copper from me. I am a generous person, I buff people <br/>\nall the time and have given away many items that I have gotten replacements <br/>\nfor. i.e. I gave a black iron medallion to a low lvl druid I met in <br/>\nRivervale one day, we just chatted and he never asked for anything, I gave <br/>\nit to him out of the kindness of my heart.  I guess basically i feel I <br/>\nworked my butt off to get what I have and if you are begging from people you<br/>\n<br/>\nare not even trying to get things for yourself, makes me very ill.<br/>\nEnough of my rant.<br/>\nCan&#39;t wait to hear feedbacks on this one.<br/>\nBree Wyndsdale<br/>\n46th Cleric of Fennin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Chris Wheeler &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wheelech@...\">wheelech@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: &quot;&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&#39;&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: [EQ-Clerics] What do you think of begging (not the skill)<br/>\n&gt;Date: Thu, 9 Sep 1999 12:24:38 -0400<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: Chris Wheeler &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wheelech@...\">wheelech@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hi all.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I gave seen this debate before in other places.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;What do you all think of begging as a method of acquiring<br/>\n&gt;cash/armour/weapons?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I don&#39;t mean the skill of begging, but I mean approaching other PC&#39;s and<br/>\n&gt;asking them to spare a bit?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Now, I am for it.  I beleive that RP&#39;ing worlds parallel the real world, <br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;inthe real world, there are those who are poor, and need to beg for thier<br/>\n&gt;sustenance.  At the lower levels, I gained most of my armour and my money<br/>\n&gt;from begging.  Now I do it in a RP&#39;ing context, and not as &#39;Hey, got any<br/>\n&gt;free armour I can have?&#39;.  I think that this is a valid strategy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;As well, now that I am entering the teens, I don&#39;t need to beg as often.<br/>\n&gt;But I do barter with players, and when doing so, I subtly make them beleive<br/>\n&gt;that I am a poor cleric (which I really am). In doing so, I have made some<br/>\n&gt;great deals, and am able to get some good bargains on armour.  Last nite,<br/>\n&gt;for instance, I bought a bloodforge hammer for 15 pp, and a FS staff.  From<br/>\n&gt;what I could see, they usually went for around 30 pp.  In my opionion, its<br/>\n&gt;no different than trading in ussed car and dressing down and making the<br/>\n&gt;saleperson beleive you are poorer than you really are.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Any other thoughts?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Show your ONElist SPIRIT!<br/>\n&gt;&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/tshirt2\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/tshirt2</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt;With a new ONElist SHIRT available through our website.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nCongratulations to MSers_Online.
