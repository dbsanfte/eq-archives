At the guild shop I noticed so many classes of spells...attack spells, healings spells, and other spells were all handled by different NPC&#39;s.  I&#39;ll be spending A LOT of money on spells.  I do have a minor gripe with clerics, though.  They just don&#39;t have enough total mana, and the Minor Healing spell isn&#39;t strong enough.  I was grouped up with a Warrior and after wasting all of my mana healing him four times, only half of his health had grown back.  Clerics need more mana!  What do you think?<br/>\n    <br/>\n    Albus the Cleric, on The Tribunal Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
