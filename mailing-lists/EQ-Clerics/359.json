If the server has<br/>\n1500 when you log on, then it sucks to be you.  Make another character<br/>\non another server.  Serves you right for loggin off!  he he he  (what do<br/>\nyou mean, you have a life outside of EQ?).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt would benefit those currently playing on the server.. but I guess<br/>\nthere is no solution to help the number of people currently existing on<br/>\na server right now.

I think only 500<br/>\n&gt; per-server is too little, I&#39;d say 1,000 to 1,500 is cool I&#39;d take<br/>\n&gt; 1,950 to<br/>\n&gt; 2,000 if they&#39;d put in more places for us to go and hunt and give us<br/>\n&gt; more<br/>\n&gt; cool items to loot.  I heard the Glowing Crook you get off Lock Jaw<br/>\n&gt; can be a<br/>\n&gt; pain cause 20+ Wizards kill the steal and get the Crook.  Thats<br/>\n&gt; something<br/>\n&gt; else they need to fix, I mean how is it right for me as a Cleric to be<br/>\n&gt; beating the crap outta something and a powerful Wizard comes along and<br/>\n&gt; with<br/>\n&gt; one blast kills it and gets the exp and the loot?  Are Wizards too<br/>\n&gt; powerful,<br/>\n&gt; seems like it too me, I know a Wizard that on Lvl 12 was doing over<br/>\n&gt; 100 dmg<br/>\n&gt; to things with one cast of a magic spell.  I on Lvl 16 get&#39;s lucky to<br/>\n&gt; do 76<br/>\n&gt; dmg to somethings with one cast of a spell.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; **************************<br/>\n&gt; Azor<br/>\n&gt; Lvl 16 Human Cleric of the Rathe<br/>\n&gt; **************************<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Lanadina the Magician &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lanadina@...\">lanadina@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I couldnt agree with you more!!!! Last night Fennin Ro had OVER 1950<br/>\n&gt; people<br/>\n&gt; &gt; on that ONE server!!!!!! They need to lock that server down<br/>\n&gt; completely and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; possibly move any level 10 and below character over to another<br/>\n&gt; server.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Personally, I don&#39;t think ANY server should have more than 500<br/>\n&gt; people on<br/>\n&gt; it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Also, they need to have more than one zone carry certain &#39;very<br/>\n&gt; saught&#39;<br/>\n&gt; after<br/>\n&gt; &gt; items, such as Rubicite armor. Why does Cazic Thule have to be the<br/>\n&gt; only<br/>\n&gt; &gt; zone? Of COURSE there will be 70-100 people in the zone! Move the<br/>\n&gt; Ruby<br/>\n&gt; &gt; around...put some in Rathe Mountains, make a level 25+ zone on<br/>\n&gt; Erudin so<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Ruby can drop there....but not all in one zone. Look at the<br/>\n&gt; Journeyman<br/>\n&gt; &gt; boots. ONE NPC in the entire game has it, its a no drop item,<br/>\n&gt; meaning you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have to loot it yourself. Why cant this npc drop it everytime to<br/>\n&gt; stop<br/>\n&gt; &gt; overcamping and people from Kill stealing? No, that would make way<br/>\n&gt; too<br/>\n&gt; much<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sense, I guess.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Over camping and lagging CAN end if some of the ideas that so many<br/>\n&gt; have<br/>\n&gt; sent<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in are implemented. But of course, that would cause Verant having to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; actually DO something...can&#39;t have that.
