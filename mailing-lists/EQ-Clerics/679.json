If that starts to happen<br/>\nwe<br/>\n&gt; might see a lot of ppl quiting the game, ya I know less ppl playing means<br/>\n&gt; more places to hunt without fighting over who gets what kill and less lag.<br/>\n&gt; But thing about that less ppl playing (less money for Verant) less money<br/>\nfor<br/>\n&gt; them could mean the end of EverQuest, I mean look at other games such as<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; Realm.  The Realm at first was a big game, but over time ppl got tired of<br/>\nit<br/>\n&gt; and they quit playing where is the Realm now?  It might still be there but<br/>\n&gt; how often is it updated, how many ppl are on there now to play with or<br/>\n&gt; against?  I like EQ about as much as the next person, but I have a feeling<br/>\n&gt; we won&#39;t see it around or as big as it is now for I&#39;d say 2-3 more years,<br/>\n&gt; with games such as Middle-Earth, Asherions Call and I&#39;ve heard of one more<br/>\n&gt; coming out.  If these 3 games hit it big a lot of ppl with switch from EQ<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; them, if they switch these 3 games to put an end to EQ.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; **************************<br/>\n&gt; Azor<br/>\n&gt; Lvl 18 Human Cleric of The Rathe<br/>\n&gt; **************************<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Lanadina the Magician&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lanadina@...\">lanadina@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I agree that the servers need to capped.
