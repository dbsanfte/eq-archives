Well they are chicken feed.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs of patch we now have deepwater goblins. Shamans over 35+ with the wolf<br/>\npets running around the beach of Oasis. Are they aggressive? YES Are they<br/>\nstrong? HELL YES<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night I witnessed one clean the beach between 2nd and 1st rock, then<br/>\nkill a SAND GIANT and go back to the water for a swim. Apparently the Gods<br/>\nhave decided they did not appreciate our camping along the beach. Party time<br/>\nis over.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey also added cistern asps. No biggie probably 14th level or so.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if this is 100% true and you&#39;re around Lvl 35 or lower you might wanna be<br/>\nextra careful there.<br/>\n<br/>\n**************************<br/>\nAzor<br/>\nLvl 18 Human Cleric of The Rathe<br/>\n**************************</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
