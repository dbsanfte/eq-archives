I don t know what level those NPC s are ... but I do know you won t be able to do them by yourself.

Specifically, the boots (stumpwatch,<br/>\n&gt;cabinwatch shouldn&#39;t be hard), don&#39;t know about the rest. Possible?<br/>\n&gt;What level is Babbinsbort?  What level is Gull?  And how do you get<br/>\n&gt;to him?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know what level those NPC&#39;s are ... but I do know you won&#39;t be able<br/>\nto do them by yourself.   A friend of mine was 34th when he died several<br/>\ntimes trying to solo them =).   Certainly though you can take them with a<br/>\ngroup... I think they are certainly in your reach if you want to go for<br/>\nthem,  I wouldn&#39;t mind a Caduceus of the Sacrament myself... that is the one<br/>\nitem that is actually pretty good.  I wish it had +wisdom, i&#39;m really<br/>\nlooking for a 1HB that has +wisdom, but it is still very good... high damage<br/>\nand fast for a 1HB.<br/>\n<br/>\n    As for stump watch and cabin watch... of course you can do those, but<br/>\nthe problem is that you have to do them in the Kithicore forest... always a<br/>\ndangerous thing.    I actually have the piece from the cabin... it happened<br/>\nto be there as I was running by  from WC to rivervale so I only need the<br/>\nstump piece.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Looks like the bracers require killing some mid 30s ghoul, so I will<br/>\n&gt;wait on these.<br/>\n&gt;What level is the greater darkbone skeleton in Rathe mountains?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again I&#39;m not sure what level he is, but you would probably want to be with<br/>\nsomebody when you tried it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would love to get the bracers myself, but those things you have to kill<br/>\nare so rare that I don&#39;t really maintain much hope of finding them... and<br/>\nnow that I have PBB&#39;s, they aren&#39;t all that important.   I will just wait<br/>\nuntil i am able to get runed Mithril bracers instead.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;How do I make galvanized, magnetized, and vulcanized platinum bars?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you ask the person who gives you the quests about galvanized, magnatized,<br/>\nor vulcanized platinum he will tell you which NPC to give your enchanted<br/>\nplatinum to.   When you give those NPC&#39;s an ehchanted bar, they give you a<br/>\nbar of galvanized, magnetized, or vulcanized.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Eachann Bronzeleaf,<br/>\n-Cleric of Tunare, Tarew Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
