My bard was given a Ringmail Chest and headpiece last night when she<br/>\nran back from West Karana to Freeport to give someone fastfeets to their<br/>\ncorpse (in West Karana) The Paladin had grown into bronze instead.<br/>\n(I discovered I like the chain look on Wood elves instead... So this<br/>\nRingmail MAY be traded out for a small size. But it isn&#39;t going away unless<br/>\nI find something with AWESOME stats -- anyone know if any of the magical<br/>\narmor has a chain look?)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnytime I&#39;ve been given stuff, it is after I did something for someone.<br/>\nI had a ranger use bind wounds on a high level wizard sitting medding and he<br/>\nwas given a fine steel rapier on IC Christmas day (Plus cash. I was just<br/>\npracticing Bind Wound!)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Charles Lembke [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:c-lembke@...\">c-lembke@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, December 14, 1999 9:18 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [EQ-Clerics] Norrath Economy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with other posters - don&#39;t beg.  I&#39;ve received gifts from other<br/>\nplayers in two circumstances.  The first, I randomly grouped with an<br/>\nenchanter who&#39;s player also had a high level druid.  After talking a while,<br/>\nthen enchanter said he had absolutely no shortage of pp.  To prove his<br/>\npoint, he gave everyone in the group like 10pp.  We all said thanks.  After<br/>\nthanking him, he then gave each of us 50pp.  The second time I received a<br/>\ngift was after helping someone recover a corpse.  I died in the attempt, but<br/>\nthey got their corpse back.  When I recovered my corpse, she asked if there<br/>\nwas anything she could give me in payment.  I said don&#39;t worry about it.<br/>\nShe insisted and gave me a pair of +3 dex bracelets.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo good deeds or others, and they will often return the favor.<br/>\n<br/>\nCharles Lembke<br/>\naka, Vulfgange, Matar, Raelph, Smity, et al.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
