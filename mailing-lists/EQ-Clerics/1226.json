I think it also matters on your <br/>\nrace..<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a Noble High elf I find if beneath such a noble calling<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI do not give free stuff to beggers.  I have never done so and I will not.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNow as a player... I find it somewhat sick that folks feel the need to go <br/>\nand beg for free stuff instead of tring to go out there and earn it.<br/>\n<br/>\nwell that is just my PoV of the matter<br/>\n<br/>\nJaxim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Chris Wheeler &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wheelech@...\">wheelech@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: &quot;&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&#39;&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: [EQ-Clerics] What do you think of begging (not the skill)<br/>\n&gt;Date: Thu, 9 Sep 1999 12:24:38 -0400<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: Chris Wheeler &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wheelech@...\">wheelech@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hi all.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I gave seen this debate before in other places.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;What do you all think of begging as a method of acquiring<br/>\n&gt;cash/armour/weapons?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I don&#39;t mean the skill of begging, but I mean approaching other PC&#39;s and<br/>\n&gt;asking them to spare a bit?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Now, I am for it.  I beleive that RP&#39;ing worlds parallel the real world, <br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;inthe real world, there are those who are poor, and need to beg for thier<br/>\n&gt;sustenance.  At the lower levels, I gained most of my armour and my money<br/>\n&gt;from begging.  Now I do it in a RP&#39;ing context, and not as &#39;Hey, got any<br/>\n&gt;free armour I can have?&#39;.  I think that this is a valid strategy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;As well, now that I am entering the teens, I don&#39;t need to beg as often.<br/>\n&gt;But I do barter with players, and when doing so, I subtly make them beleive<br/>\n&gt;that I am a poor cleric (which I really am). In doing so, I have made some<br/>\n&gt;great deals, and am able to get some good bargains on armour.  Last nite,<br/>\n&gt;for instance, I bought a bloodforge hammer for 15 pp, and a FS staff.  From<br/>\n&gt;what I could see, they usually went for around 30 pp.  In my opionion, its<br/>\n&gt;no different than trading in ussed car and dressing down and making the<br/>\n&gt;saleperson beleive you are poorer than you really are.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Any other thoughts?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Show your ONElist SPIRIT!<br/>\n&gt;&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/tshirt2\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/tshirt2</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt;With a new ONElist SHIRT available through our website.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
