I&#39;ve read a few guides<br/>\nthough there seems to be some conflict on weapons. <br/>\nSome guides say one-handed blunt, another say<br/>\ntwo-handed blunt, and lastly, some say both.  I would<br/>\njust like to know what everyone else thinks on the<br/>\nsubject.  Any other tips (as in armor, spells,<br/>\nhunting, etc) for a young dwarven clerics (lvl4) would<br/>\nbe great too.
