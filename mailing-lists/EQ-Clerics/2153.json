Still trying to<br/>\nget the Paw Of Opella and a Tained Morning Star (5 wis).  Any 2 HB weapon that I<br/>\nwould use would have to have enough wis to offset me loosing the AC from the<br/>\nshield.  If a 2HB weapon had 15-18 wis I could change out the plat armband and<br/>\nthe gatorscale legs that I&#39;m using for Steel arms (or Asure Sleeves) and<br/>\nsilver-plated leggings (total of 7 wis, plus the 9 from the shield = 16 wis).<br/>\nOther option is getting the Kedge Totem (18wis!  -9 str).  Still no melee<br/>\ninvolved with the Totem or the Paw.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only 2 HB weapons that I know of (save Dragon drops) have really low wis.  I<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t give up the shield for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAilamil Faithbringer<br/>\nSpanking new level 48<br/>\n&quot;OMG, no PCs are red to me anymore!&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
