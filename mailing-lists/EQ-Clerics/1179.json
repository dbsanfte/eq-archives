I owe all my early patchwork and later banded<br/>\n&gt;to her wonderful sewing and smithing skills.  With all the money she made,<br/>\n&gt;she was also able to buy me all my spells up to level 24.  She was without a<br/>\n&gt;doubt the richest level 15 cleric you ever saw.  Had over 2000 plat in the<br/>\n&gt;bank which she spent on all 6 of our group for armor and spells.  I&#39;d of<br/>\n&gt;still been in patchwork at level 24 with about 4 spells if it weren&#39;t for<br/>\n&gt;Aos.  &lt;hugs Aos tight tight&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Erm... ye afford me to much gratitude Mik.  Ye would have done just fine<br/>\nwithout me I&#39;m sure hon.  Besides, it was fun making patchwork and banded<br/>\nfor everyone.  ;)  For a cleric looking to save some money in the<br/>\nbeginning, i would strongly suggest tailoring as a starting skill.  You can<br/>\narmor yeself for relatively little money, and can save the rest of the cash<br/>\nfor spells.  As you go up in levels, you should definitely work on<br/>\nsmithing, since it&#39;s relatively cheap to increase the skill to the point<br/>\nwhere you can make banded armor with relative reliability.  Besides, it&#39;s a<br/>\nhelluva lot cheaper than purchasing chain from the store!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Mik (who thinks she has to behave now that she knows Aos is watching her!!<br/>\n&gt;LOL)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;covers her virgin eyes&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-Aosinator Lightbringer<br/>\n-Devout follower of Mithanial Marr on The Rathe<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n                               |&#92;      _,,,---,,_      <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:darshan@...\">darshan@...</a>   ZZZzz /,`.-&#39;`&#39;    -.  ;-;;,_   <br/>\n                              |,4-  ) )-,_. ,&#92; (  `&#39;-&#39;  <br/>\n                             &#39;---&#39;&#39;(_/--&#39;  `-&#39;&#92;_)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
