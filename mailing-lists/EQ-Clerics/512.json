I have played this RPG since it first hit the<br/>\n&gt;shelves of my local game store- and I must say; I am quite disappointed to<br/>\n&gt;where it has ended up as.<br/>\n&gt; It had great promise, but frankly-  it&#39;s the worse fantasy game i have<br/>\n </span></blockquote>ever<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;played. As a matter of fact;  THERE IS NO &#39;FANTASY&#39; about it!!!! I had a<br/>\n&gt;number of fantastic dreams when I first heard of Everquest- a land where<br/>\n </span></blockquote>one<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;can travel across lands and dimensions, a true world where you can follow a<br/>\n&gt;trail through a path of forest for hours to reach the fabled land of elves-<br/>\n&gt;or journey through a dark dungeon where rumors of a powerful sorceror made<br/>\n&gt;his home there-, creating monstrosities and twisting creatures and beings<br/>\n </span></blockquote>to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;its desire, with people cowering in fear to its name- or journey to an inn<br/>\n&gt;within a city, where you meat cut-throats, warriors, magicians of promised<br/>\n&gt;power to journey with you to a quest assigned to you- but these dreams have<br/>\n&gt;been shattered! Never has any of this happened in the world of Norrath to<br/>\n </span></blockquote>me.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Playing as a priestess of Tunare, I had great ambitions of journeying and<br/>\n&gt;making a mark upon my name as an adventurerer and holy advisor. But I am<br/>\n </span></blockquote>lost<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;in a world of technicality- noone cares about adventuring or imagination in<br/>\n&gt;the world of Norrath. I am lost in a world of levels, fancy weapons, and<br/>\n&gt;items. Noone in the world of EQ cares about being in a diffrent world- its<br/>\n&gt;only a contest on who can reach the highest level, get the most fanciful<br/>\n&gt;weapon, or the the most striking robe.<br/>\n&gt; Try to prove me wrong- I doubt it! Through my months of journeying in the<br/>\n&gt;world of Norrath, I HAVE ONLY MET ONE PERSON  that truly tried to roleplay<br/>\n&gt;(and i have met many people through different servers) - and even he turned<br/>\n&gt;into the &#39;world of mundane unimagination&#39; after a month. Am I wrong? Read<br/>\n&gt;this mailing list- what do people talk about on this list? This is what<br/>\n </span></blockquote>they<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;talk about-<br/>\n&gt;   &quot; How can I find the (some generic magic item that everyone else talks<br/>\n&gt;about) &quot;<br/>\n&gt;   What level is --- (some monster that someone wants to kill to get an<br/>\n </span></blockquote>item,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;and camp out til he/she gets it)<br/>\n&gt;    Where can I hunt to get to level (a number) -<br/>\n&gt;     Etc.... etc....&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Not that any of this is wrong, people are asking for help- but this is all<br/>\n&gt;anyone talks about in EQ! ! ! I once belonged to an RPG community and game<br/>\n&gt;where mailing lists were designed to be &#39;in character&#39; , where Mordok the<br/>\n&gt;warrior may  share his thoughts about the Golden Dragons Inn, or the Dark<br/>\n&gt;Elves gathering a war party to rid the land of people who oppose them, or<br/>\n&gt;magicians giving hints to the knowledge of their power through a quest for<br/>\n&gt;them (And i thought this was one of the most exciting RPGs until they<br/>\n </span></blockquote>started<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;charging money per hour to play) - does any of this happen EQ, wheteher<br/>\n&gt;through mailing lists or in the game itself?  To believe that EQ made a<br/>\n&gt;measly attempt to have people roleplay by coloring their names a different<br/>\n&gt;color!? All i get from those people  are male characters asking for my<br/>\n </span></blockquote>phone<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;number or address (considering I play a female character), or  ---<br/>\n&gt;  &quot;How much damage does that spell do?<br/>\n&gt;   When will  (the monster) spawn again?<br/>\n&gt;    WHat number is your (skill) at?<br/>\n&gt;   Whats the stats of your (item) ?<br/>\n&gt;  I can&#39;t wait til reach level (#) etc...etc...&quot;<br/>\n&gt;    I am not making bones about it- yes, it is great to reach the next<br/>\n </span></blockquote>level<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;so you can cast a different spell, etc.. to enliven your adventure-  but<br/>\n </span></blockquote>what<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;does everyone else look for after that? THIS is what -<br/>\n&gt;    &quot; I can&#39;t wait to reach the next level!!! &quot;<br/>\n&gt;  So what happens when you reach level 100? What are you going to do then,<br/>\n&gt;keep fighting monsters til you reach level 101?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  There is no fiction about EQ. Its not a RPG, its a video game with no<br/>\n&gt;imagination.
