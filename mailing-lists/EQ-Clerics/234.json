I cast root on a glyphed guard in the graveyard, but failed to see <br/>\nthe two casters behind it (my group handled it but i died almost as soon as i <br/>\ngot back to the group , pretty much jipping me of exp and losing some hard <br/>\nearned exp in process..) Take my advice stick to healing buffing, besides you <br/>\nget mobs on you enough just for the healing part ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nDungin <br/>\nLevel 24th (would be 25 if not for that lil mistake) cleric rathe</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
