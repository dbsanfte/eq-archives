I thought the balance was kept by this spell in that it <br/>\ncould only be used once every 15 minutes.  Even if you die and have to <br/>\nrememorize it, you still have to wait the 15 minutes to use it again.  If <br/>\nthis stun thing isn&#39;t a bug, then I probably won&#39;t use this spell more.  I <br/>\nhardly use it now as it is since the only time I really need it is if I&#39;m <br/>\ngoing to die and I have no hope of running since I&#39;m so low on life anyways.  <br/>\nAlthough it is fun to cast this spell then jump off of things such as the <br/>\nwizard teleport stones.  Always fun to scare people. Hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Rydel on Bristlebane</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
