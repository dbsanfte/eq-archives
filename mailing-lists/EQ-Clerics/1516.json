The major downside to this, at<br/>\nleast in my case, is the major lag I pick up just by stepping inside the<br/>\nhouse.  It&#39;s pretty much gotten to the point that when I&#39;ve seen it the<br/>\nsafest in Unrest is when there are groups camping the tower, the barroom,<br/>\nthe reclusive ghoul magi room, and some lower level groups in the room at<br/>\nthe side door and the back door room.  The pathing in Unrest is so buggy<br/>\nthat if you try to pull something to the outside, chances are that the rest<br/>\nof the house is going to come with it.  That&#39;s half the reason I moved over<br/>\nto Mistmoore once I hit lv 21.<br/>\n<br/>\nLohre Soulsaver<br/>\nBristlebane Server<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Sianne . &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:maggee1@...\">maggee1@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, September 24, 1999 9:29 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] Suggestions for high teen levels in unrest?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Sianne .&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:maggee1@...\">maggee1@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I was at Unrest at lvl 23 with a full group including a 2nd cleric.  The<br/>\n&gt; place was horrible.  Death after death after death.  Between deaths and<br/>\n&gt; running to the zone there were no points made.  The only time we were<br/>\nthere<br/>\n&gt; successfully was in a room (hand room) i think.  Then shortly a high lvl<br/>\n&gt; cleric came in and ran us out....i am now almost lvl 27 and haven&#39;t been<br/>\n&gt; back yet.  I may try to go back soon though...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;William Hooker&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wahooker@...\">wahooker@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_CLERIC@...\">EQ_CLERIC@...</a>, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;Subject: [EQ-Clerics] Suggestions for high teen levels in unrest?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Date: Fri, 24 Sep 1999 07:52:25 EDT<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;William Hooker&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wahooker@...\">wahooker@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I have heard from many many people that unrest is a great place for a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;cleric<br/>\n&gt; &gt;to go starting around 14 or so.  I am 17th (almost 18th) and am having<br/>\n&gt; &gt;serious trouble there.  Last night 6 people from my guild were there, all<br/>\n&gt; &gt;15-20 and we had a rough time.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;We were at the back wall pulling from the back door.  We had SoW and<br/>\ninvis<br/>\n&gt; &gt;to undead on the puller at all times, but there were many times where she<br/>\n&gt; &gt;ended up bringing quite a few too many ghouls.  (tried to pull 1 and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;suddenly there were 7 of them on us!)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Are we hunting at too high a level, or are we pulling from the wrong<br/>\nplace?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Or do we just suck?  We only had 2 deaths last night, but many many many<br/>\n&gt; &gt;close calls.  Lets just say thank god our druid was also saving 50% mana<br/>\n&gt; &gt;for<br/>\n&gt; &gt;heals.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Meddik<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Jaegergruppe<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Bristlebane<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
