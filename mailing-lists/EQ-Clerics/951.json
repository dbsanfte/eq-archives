I play a Cleric on<br/>\n&gt; Rallos Zek (PvP) and my main rationale is I like to heal. I play a &quot;good&quot;<br/>\n&gt; cleric and have healed bad/good races. My main irritation is when I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; suddenly PK&#39;d by a member of my own race. (High Elf. I hang my head in shame<br/>\n&gt; at my fallen brothers and sisters)<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Anyway normally there is a +/- 4 range for PvP correct? It seems to me that<br/>\n&gt; the Cleric is uniquely positioned so that we can severely inconvenience<br/>\n&gt; other players far below our level. If they are fighting a MOB can we heal<br/>\n&gt; the MOB? Can we buff it? I must admit I have never tried it, I just thought<br/>\n&gt; of it. Has anyone any experience of this??<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Regards<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Nynenom of Rallos Zek<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  the best place to EXPLORE topics, SHARE ideas, and <br/>\n&gt; CONNECT to people with the same interests.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n===================================================<br/>\nSarah\t\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sarah@...\">sarah@...</a><br/>\n===================================================<br/>\nMy picture of the world is of masses of people extending gifts to other <br/>\npeople, doing favors -- but nobody keeping score. -- Dr. Whitsett<br/>\n=================================================== </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
