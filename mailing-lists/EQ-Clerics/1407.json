Furthermore, i melee alot but i choose to do it<br/>\nwhen<br/>\n&gt; i am Oom, i have died on many occations, when i was oom and ordered my<br/>\ngroup<br/>\n&gt; to flee, as i was full HP i stayed to get the critters of the rest of my<br/>\n&gt; group.  IMHO i beleive that any cleric worth their salt will give up their<br/>\n&gt; life to save the group as a whole, LOL don&#39;t get me wrong tho, i don&#39;t<br/>\nlike-<br/>\n&gt; try to die, heh, and i am not saying this is the right way to go for all<br/>\n&gt; clerics, it is just the way i play the role, most often i do not die tho<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; lvl right along with the rest of my group.  i have been blessed with a<br/>\ngreat<br/>\n&gt; group when we have more than one on us, and i am being hit, i usually just<br/>\n&gt; have to say &quot;rook on me&quot; and they are by my side, taunting or whatever,<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; the only reason i ever lose anyone is if i am being hit and interuppted,<br/>\n&gt; that part od it sucks, but alas we do have another cleric in group who<br/>\n&gt; mainly does melee, so if i fail on a heal she can usually get my back,,,,,<br/>\n&gt; thats all :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
