Get page 30 from him.<br/>\n<br/>\nGo to Qeynos and find Moodoro Finharn in North Qeynos either in or<br/>\nnear Crows Pub.  Say &quot;I want page 34&quot;.  He will make you play a card<br/>\ngame. for 4gp he will give you a card.  If the card is the jester,<br/>\ngive it back to him.  He will give you page 34.  Give him 2gp and he<br/>\nwill give you a 2-slot book.  Put both pages in the book, and hit<br/>\ncombine.  That&#39;s it.<br/>\n  The quest actually originates in Erudia, but someone on here tipped<br/>\nus off that you didn&#39;t actually have to go to Erudia to get the book.<br/>\nThat, by giving Moodoro the 2gp, he would give it to you.  With that<br/>\nlittle tip, it&#39;s incredibly easy to get, and well worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nErgo, 19th level high elf cleric of Tunare<br/>\nTest Server<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Ralph Carothers &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:CarothersR@...\">CarothersR@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>ok,  how does one do the quest then? :)  that would be my best<br/>\nquestion to ask...I&#39;ve heard it touched on and not seen any answers as<br/>\nto how to complete it!<br/>\n<br/>\nBann</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
