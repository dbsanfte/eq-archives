It would prevent the vultures from staying on the edge<br/>\nof combats just in case you died to a too hard monster !<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Curtis Bennett [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:die_kluge@...\">die_kluge@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: 2 ao∩┐╜t, 1999 09:44<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] Team Server<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Curtis Bennett&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:die_kluge@...\">die_kluge@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAzor, as a regular on test, I can tell you that everyone that showed<br/>\nup just to test the racewar were what we on test refer to as &quot;kewl<br/>\ndoodz&quot;.  Your average 15 year-old asshole that wants nothing more than<br/>\nto make a gnome enchanter so he can go invis and DOT your character<br/>\nwhile you&#39;re picking up loot off a dead creature you just killed for<br/>\nsome quick cash.  (Do I sound like I&#39;m talking from experience?  I am)<br/>\nThese are the some ones that will spam the chat room when test server<br/>\ngoes down just because they think it&#39;s funny.  They&#39;re real dorks, and<br/>\neveryone on test is just counting the days when they will all leave to<br/>\njoin their other obnoxious friends on the race war.<br/>\n  And from what I heard, there were over 5000 people on Tallon Zek.<br/>\nThey are adding another server, and they will both be up Wednesday,<br/>\naccording to the banner.  Some estimates put the number as high as<br/>\n7000.  (2000 in the queue)<br/>\n<br/>\nInterestingly enough, on test right now, looting is enabled; meaning<br/>\nthat if I die, someone from another team can loot me for my cash and<br/>\n1 item.  Oddly enough, from what I&#39;ve seen, this has really curbed<br/>\nthe violence on test.  I think it put a little fear in them.  I died<br/>\nlast night in Misty from a Kodiak and a friendly gnome looted me so<br/>\n&quot;no one else could get it&quot; and was kind enough to give it back to me,<br/>\nto the last copper.  I think it&#39;s absurd to think, that a death from<br/>\na kodiak would enable someone else to loot me.  that doesn&#39;t seem to<br/>\nmake any sense.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Azor&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jmaynus@...\">jmaynus@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I can&#39;t believe how that Team Server went, even tho the had a banner up<br/>\n&gt;about all day saying &quot;PLEASE don&#39;t hang out on the chat server waiting for<br/>\n&gt;Tallon Zek, it will be up much,, much later tonight&quot; ppl still lived in the<br/>\n&gt;chat rooms making it VERY hard to log into the game.  Heard there was over<br/>\n&gt;4,000 ppl in Tallon Zek when it went live, not too long after it went up<br/>\n&gt;they took it down saying they wasn&#39;t gonna put it back up till they had<br/>\n&gt;more<br/>\n&gt;Team Servers up and that would be at least a week.<br/>\n&gt;From what I read while ppl waited for it to get up that there were TONS of<br/>\n&gt;ppl in the chat room, many cussing and screaming about it.  I&#39;ve also<br/>\n&gt;noticed this when a few or all servers go down, ppl act like that can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;wait<br/>\n&gt;for a few hours to get back on.  Theres some much to real life and tons of<br/>\n&gt;things to do outside but yet ppl would rather sit in the house all day<br/>\n&gt;playing EQ instade of spending time with friends and loved ones but of<br/>\n&gt;course they just sit there and whin every 5 seconds about &quot;When&#39;s it gonna<br/>\n&gt;be back up?&quot; throw in a few cuss words and whin some more.  I may be flamed<br/>\n&gt;for this letter, but I just can&#39;t see why ppl acted that way.  Yes I play<br/>\n&gt;EQ<br/>\n&gt;like crazy, but I try to hang around friends and family as much as I can.<br/>\n&gt;Guess like that post on a web site said &quot;I refuse to call EQ a real game,<br/>\n&gt;it&#39;s video game crack&quot;.  If ya feel the need to flame me, go a head, but I<br/>\n&gt;bet many of you agree with what I&#39;m saying here.  It&#39;s just my 2 cents (or<br/>\n&gt;2cp).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;**************************<br/>\n&gt;Azor<br/>\n&gt;Lvl 18 Human Cleric of the Rathe<br/>\n&gt;**************************<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nStart a new ONElist list & you can WIN great prizes!<br/>\nFor details on ONElist∩┐╜s NEW FRIENDS & FAMILY program, go to<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html\">http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
