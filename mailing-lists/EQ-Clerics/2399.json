However, while they do have their moments I still rank their importance far beneath the heal, bind, smite, and dismiss undead spells...   If you have the money, by all means buy them all.. i bought them all and I&#39;m not trying to discourage anybody from buying the spells.  However, if you are short cash... I would put those spells last on the priority list.<br/>\n<br/>\nEachann Bronzeleaf,<br/>\nCleric of Tunare, Tarew Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
