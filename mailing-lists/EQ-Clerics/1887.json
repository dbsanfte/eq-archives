And the damage you will be able to do against","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2106323378\">Hate to discourage you, but at higher levels, you will melee VERY little.<br/>\nYour value is healing and buffing.  And the damage you will be able to do<br/>\nagainst high level mobs is very minimal.  You will be fighting mobs with<br/>\n1000s of hps at high levels, and a lot of them have very high magic<br/>\nresistance, so your spells are useless cause they are resisted most always.<br/>\nAnd these mobs hit HARD...some for over 100 hps damage a pop.  You can&#39;t<br/>\nsurvive at melee with these mobs, only the big tanks can.  You serve one<br/>\npurpose mainly, and that is healing to keep everyone alive. Regarding<br/>\nundead,  clerics used to be able to solo specs quite easily with undead<br/>\nspells, but they changed the pathing of them at the spec cave in Feerott and<br/>\nnow it&#39;s dangerous cause you can&#39;t really pull them solo anymore.  You pull<br/>\none and two or three come, and that&#39;s BAD news.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding the mana issue....you will need to get your hands on as many<br/>\nwisdom enhancing items as you can, because you will need all the mana you<br/>\ncan get to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of your healing powers.<br/>\nThe more mana you have the longer you can keep your group alive and the less<br/>\nmed time you have.  So start amassing those wisdom items and try to get your<br/>\nwisdom at least up into the 170s minimum.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry to disillusion you, but high levels clerics are relegated mostly to<br/>\nhealing and buffing and medding.  That&#39;s what your specialty is and at those<br/>\nlevels, the other healing classes can&#39;t come close to our healing powers<br/>\nwith our superior and complete heal.  The good news is that no high level<br/>\ngroup ventures anywhere without at least one good cleric.  YOu are a MUST<br/>\nhave.<br/>\n<br/>\n Mik<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Niomar &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Niomar@...\">Niomar@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, October 19, 1999 12:11 AM<br/>\nSubject: [EQ-Clerics] Mana<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Niomar&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Niomar@...\">Niomar@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Okay, I am now lvl 10 and really concerned about this.  From what EVERYONE<br/>\n&gt; tells me (which I totally disagree with and the whole subject matter makes<br/>\n&gt; me sick) is that when older (25+) all we do is heal...no melee, no DD,<br/>\njust<br/>\n&gt; heal and med.  First...is that true or can we still melee..I know we won&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; exactly be able to solo melee...but as in a group or possibly as the only<br/>\n&gt; tank?..and while on that subject, can we solo undead up into all our<br/>\nhigher<br/>\n&gt; lvls or do we still need help then too?  And finally the mana issue.  I am<br/>\n&gt; dwarven cleric and have a 100 in strength and 103 in wisdom...will that be<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; high enough wisdom to have proper mana to heal my group and such?  Any<br/>\nother<br/>\n&gt; tips would be most helpful.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Niomar, Dwarven Cleric of 10 trainings.  Xegony Server.<br/>\n&gt; Telikas, Dark Elven Mage of 14 trainings.

Any good cleric websites with detailed spell descriptions (like how<br/>\n&gt; much damage our spells deal, how much HPs our healing spells heal, and the<br/>\n&gt; exact numbers on our buffs, etc)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
