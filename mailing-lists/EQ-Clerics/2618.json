Has places for you to get great exp from 24 to<br/>\n35... and that&#39;s not the best part. The best thing about Keep is Keep<br/>\nitself. Guards handy if things get bad... zone handy if they get worse...<br/>\nvendor handy so you don&#39;t hafta waste a scrap of loot if you don&#39;t want...<br/>\nbank handy so you don&#39;t hafta throw out coppers to stay unencumbered... and<br/>\nfood and water sold there if you don&#39;t feel like conjuring some (like who<br/>\ndoes anymore anyway?&lt;G&gt;). The only other thing you could ask from a zone<br/>\nwould be that you were the only one that knew about it! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\nAnd while you&#39;re waiting for that group... you might be able to solo the<br/>\nnamed prisoner in the jail area or the named bandits outside in High Pass.<br/>\n<br/>\nPantheus<br/>\nPhoenix Crusaders<br/>\nEM<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Curtis Bennett [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:die_kluge@...\">die_kluge@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, January 04, 2000 5:28 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [EQ-Clerics] xp at 24?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Curtis Bennett&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:die_kluge@...\">die_kluge@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m trying to figure out where to get xp at 24th level.  I really like<br/>\nUpper Guk, but there is kind of a hole at 24th level in Upper Guk.  My<br/>\nfriends all want to do Cazic Thule, but I find it so incredibly<br/>\nboring.  I was thinking Unrest, but I have so many bad memories of<br/>\nsuch bad trains there.  Seems like Runnyeye might be good, but not too<br/>\nfamiliar with it.  Not sure what levels of creatures are there.  Then<br/>\nthere is Borxx who could probably kick our ass.<br/>\n  Friend of mine suggested East Karana might be a good place to solo.<br/>\nSaid I could solo evil eyes there.  And as risky/exciting as that<br/>\nsounds, I don&#39;t think I could continue to get xp there until 29th.<br/>\n  Paw and Mistmoore are still too high/tough.  I heard Sol A might be<br/>\ngood, but I&#39;ve never been to Lavastorm, and worry about falling into<br/>\nlava as I&#39;ve heard you&#39;re oft to do when zoning into the place.  Maybe<br/>\ndark elf guards in Nektulos?  What level are griffons?  What level are<br/>\nthe giant skels in Rathe mountains?  Maybe pickclaws in highkeep?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone have any recommendations for either a group of low 20s, or for<br/>\nme to solo at 24?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance,<br/>\nErgo Soulhealer<br/>\ntest server<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n    GRAB THE GATOR!
