Luckily enough I have a high level friend who<br/>\ngave me the circlet and is currently hunting me some gatorscale leggings.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also bought a couple of +3 wis earrings for 30pp each, which seems to be<br/>\nthe going rate on Fennin Ro. I&#39;m waiting around for a guild member to get<br/>\nhis JC up so I can get a platinum ruby veil at cost. My next investment<br/>\nafter that will be +6 wis rings.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would advise against purchasing any armour that has nothing but AC. If you<br/>\nhaven&#39;t already begun, you will find yourself less and less on the front<br/>\nline in battle from now on, especially in the dungeons.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut first get yourself a Testament of Vanear, if you don&#39;t already have one.<br/>\nAt level 26 you will have no problems at all, and if I&#39;m not mistaken it&#39;s<br/>\nthe highest +wis item you can hold in your left hand.<br/>\n<br/>\nSalt</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
