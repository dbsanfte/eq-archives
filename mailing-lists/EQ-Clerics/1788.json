The spawn spot is right at zone entrance.  It can be<br/>\nanything from a rat to an IBS to a ghoul.  The putrid skel and ghoul<br/>\nplaceholders TALK when they spawn.  First thing you have to do is go to<br/>\nlevel 3 and kill everything down there.  That&#39;s only way you can be sure to<br/>\nget the placeholder.  It can be an IBS or anything.  So after you kill<br/>\neverything down there, youwill hve killed the placeholder and then you just<br/>\nhave to camp that zone spot and kill everything that spawns.  Not every<br/>\nplaceholder will talk.  The IBSs and rats don&#39;t talk.  The placeholder will<br/>\nROAM after it spawns and make its way to level 3.  That&#39;s why you have to<br/>\nclear everything down there first to be sure you get it.  Otherwise it will<br/>\nnever spawn.<br/>\n<br/>\nMik<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Kalvin Lau &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kalvin_lau@...\">kalvin_lau@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Saturday, October 09, 1999 2:37 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] Gynok&#39;s Placeholders<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Kalvin Lau &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kalvin_lau@...\">kalvin_lau@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I was hunting there from lvl 7 to lvl 18, but only saw<br/>\n&gt; Gynok twice, it spawn at lvl 1 near zone entrance.
