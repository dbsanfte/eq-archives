I totally agree with hunting scarecrows at<br/>\n&gt; 14-17. They give great exp. They do hit hard and fast though... team up with<br/>\n&gt; an Enchanter and they&#39;re easy pickings (Tashan&#39;s and Languid Pace work<br/>\n&gt; wonders). I hunted them with an Enc friend and we never died once. We<br/>\n&gt; started at 14(me) and 12(him) and left at 16(me) and 15(him). That area of<br/>\n&gt; the W Karanas is pretty safe to med, and the odd wandering critter got<br/>\n&gt; killed by his pet.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Interestingly I teamed with a L15 monk one day when the Enchanter wasn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; around... found it _much_ harder. Not nearly as efficient, and the monk was<br/>\n&gt; getting down there in HP.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The other thing about hunting scarecrows... it&#39;s a refreshing change - it<br/>\n&gt; makes you feel like a wizard with melee ability!
