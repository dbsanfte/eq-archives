Stop killing Mangler..  the only way he attacks you is if you go in the<br/>\nback room of Kevlin Diggs shop (which you don&#39;t need to unless you&#39;re a<br/>\nrogue trying to complete a quest).  If Mangler does attack you zone out so<br/>\nyou don&#39;t take the faction hit.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  Not sure what lvl you are, but kill Mooto if you can.  He gives great<br/>\nfaction.<br/>\n<br/>\n3.  Continue to hand in RE warbeads and orc centurion belts.<br/>\n<br/>\n4.  After Misty thicket stops giving you exp, head over to Beholder&#39;s Maze.<br/>\nIt gives good exp and it still raises the same factions as Misty.   Same<br/>\ngoes with Runnyeye once Beholder gets too easy for ya.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW..  you don&#39;t have to buy your spells from Rivervale..  go somewhere else<br/>\nif it&#39;s a must.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
