If that starts to happen we<br/>\nmight see a lot of ppl quiting the game, ya I know less ppl playing means<br/>\nmore places to hunt without fighting over who gets what kill and less lag.<br/>\nBut thing about that less ppl playing (less money for Verant) less money for<br/>\nthem could mean the end of EverQuest, I mean look at other games such as the<br/>\nRealm.  The Realm at first was a big game, but over time ppl got tired of it<br/>\nand they quit playing where is the Realm now?  It might still be there but<br/>\nhow often is it updated, how many ppl are on there now to play with or<br/>\nagainst?  I like EQ about as much as the next person, but I have a feeling<br/>\nwe won&#39;t see it around or as big as it is now for I&#39;d say 2-3 more years,<br/>\nwith games such as Middle-Earth, Asherions Call and I&#39;ve heard of one more<br/>\ncoming out.  If these 3 games hit it big a lot of ppl with switch from EQ to<br/>\nthem, if they switch these 3 games to put an end to EQ.<br/>\n<br/>\n**************************<br/>\nAzor<br/>\nLvl 18 Human Cleric of The Rathe<br/>\n**************************<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Lanadina the Magician&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lanadina@...\">lanadina@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I agree that the servers need to capped.
