The<br/>\nother thing about them is they are a handy point on the Qeynos-Splitpaw<br/>\nroute which (as all Qeynos clerics know) is the level 19 spell quest route.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; if there are 2 or 3 other people there, you may as <br/>\n&gt; well go hunt<br/>\n&gt; someplace else becasue there aren&#39;t enough scarecrows for everybody.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is where I am glad that I play mornings and lunchtimes GMT...<br/>\n<br/>\nElbeno</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
