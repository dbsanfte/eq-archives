I&#39;ll<br/>\ngrant for the weight that the person that posted that may not have known<br/>\nwhat it was and just put that down, but +20 vs all saving throws is a little<br/>\nbit on the high side for any piece of equipment that I&#39;ve heard of or seen.<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen pieces that&#39;ll do +10 or even +15 to a single save, but +20 I<br/>\nwould think is a little extreme.  Really would like to see the weapon exist,<br/>\ndon&#39;t get me wrong, but until I see a screenshot of it, I&#39;ll have to remain<br/>\na skeptic.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nMike Schlagenhauf<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:trelane@...\">trelane@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: kurt walther &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:itzkurt@...\">itzkurt@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Sunday, February 21, 1999 10:49 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] Nelferous&#39;s Mallet<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: kurt walther &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:itzkurt@...\">itzkurt@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t know why yall thin it&#39;s too good to be true.  Compare it to the<br/>\n&gt; fiery avenger.  The stats on the avenger are like.. 35 damage.. 45<br/>\n&gt; delay.  That still blows away tihs weapon.  Compare this weapon to the<br/>\n&gt; executioners axe..  it gets blown away again.  This weapon may or may<br/>\n&gt; not exist.  I don&#39;t konw.  If it does.. good...  if it doesn&#39;t.. there<br/>\n&gt; is still a cleric only weapon out there that is very powerful.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Create a list for FRIENDS & FAMILY...<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; ...and you can WIN $100 to Amazon.com.
