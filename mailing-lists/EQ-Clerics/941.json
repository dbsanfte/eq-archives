Same goes for buffs.  That is, if you<br/>\nmean to buff them while they are fighting other players.  If they are<br/>\nfighting you, I think you can heal them, as I have done this accidentally in<br/>\nthe past.  I haven&#39;t done it recently, so I can&#39;t be 100% certain.  Though I<br/>\ndo seem to recall seeing the MOB&#39;s life bar inch back up after an accidental<br/>\nheal on my behalf.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Chas Watkins [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cwatkins@...\">cwatkins@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: 1999/08/23 2:41 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: [EQ-Clerics] Cleric&#39;s and PvP<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Chas Watkins &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cwatkins@...\">cwatkins@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone tried healing or buffing a NPC or a MOB. I play a Cleric on<br/>\nRallos Zek (PvP) and my main rationale is I like to heal. I play a &quot;good&quot;<br/>\ncleric and have healed bad/good races. My main irritation is when I&#39;m<br/>\nsuddenly PK&#39;d by a member of my own race. (High Elf. I hang my head in shame<br/>\nat my fallen brothers and sisters)<br/>\n <br/>\nAnyway normally there is a +/- 4 range for PvP correct? It seems to me that<br/>\nthe Cleric is uniquely positioned so that we can severely inconvenience<br/>\nother players far below our level. If they are fighting a MOB can we heal<br/>\nthe MOB? Can we buff it? I must admit I have never tried it, I just thought<br/>\nof it. Has anyone any experience of this??<br/>\n <br/>\nRegards<br/>\n <br/>\nNynenom of Rallos Zek<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nONElist:  the best place to EXPLORE topics, SHARE ideas, and <br/>\nCONNECT to people with the same interests.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
