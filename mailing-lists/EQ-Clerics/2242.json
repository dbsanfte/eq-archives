I just restarted my DE cleric - and I personally think they <br/>\nlook good in anything but brass &lt;shudder&gt;. DE&#39;s are limited in the <br/>\nareas that they can go though (or so it seems to me). Seems like the <br/>\nvast majority of areas I&#39;m KOS. I have to be invised by friends to <br/>\ntravel the majority of the realms. When you first create the char you <br/>\nare warned that it&#39;s a high difficultly combination. If you want to <br/>\ntravel freely you spend a lot of time killing things to raise your <br/>\nfaction. I sometimes wish I could move about as freely as a goodie - <br/>\nbut oh well - I love my DE.<br/>\n<br/>\nPyuna<br/>\n~7th Level DE Cleric<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Rose&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rliu@...\">rliu@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hello,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;This might be a silly plead for advice but here it is...I am restarting my<br/>\n&gt;cleric on a new server.  My old cleric is a high elf female.  I am torn<br/>\n&gt;between restarting as a dark elf or stick with the high elf.  Which in<br/>\n&gt;y&#39;all&#39;s opinion...looks better?  I have never seen a dark elf in the purple<br/>\n&gt;armor...do they look silly?  Does the purple make em look like a blueberry<br/>\n&gt;and grape mix?  I have never seen a dark elf in the yellow quest armor as<br/>\n&gt;well.  I do like the way the dark elf females look but given the color<br/>\n&gt;scheme I might not be able to live with myself if the color is too much of<br/>\n&gt;an offense to my fashion sense =).  The only thing I do not like about the<br/>\n&gt;high elf females is the face...they look too haughty. Although I have to<br/>\n&gt;admit that plate armor looks really good on the females.  However, another<br/>\n&gt;reluctance is the fact that there just seems to be more high elves cleric<br/>\n&gt;then dark elves...yeah I know the stat is better...but I want to look my<br/>\n&gt;best as well and be unique ;)  Anyway advise is appreciated...thanks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;These are female characters I am talking about.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-Imogen<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\nPamela Bendel - Billing and Records<br/>\nmailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pam@...\">pam@...</a><br/>\nPhone (847)963-0116 / Fax (847)963-1302<br/>\nToll Free: 1-888-212-0099 / Tech 1-888-338-3775<br/>\nWWW Site - <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.starnetusa.net/\">http://www.starnetusa.net/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nWholesale Internet Services, visit <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.megapop.net/\">http://www.megapop.net/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
