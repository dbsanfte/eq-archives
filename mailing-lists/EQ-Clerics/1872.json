This was caused by fighting with Mangler.  I killed him 3 or<br/>\n4 times as a young halfling, because he atacked me.  The 5th time I did it,<br/>\nI lost enough faction to con dubious, and hence, lose buying and selling<br/>\nprivileges.  I was able to regain my faction by handing in 24 RE warbeads to<br/>\nthe sheriff. That was level 9.  However, at level 11, I was again attacked<br/>\nby him, but he was killed by someone else. No matter, my faction bit the<br/>\ndust again.  Now, at level 13, almost 14, I have handed in 96 warbeads, and<br/>\nstill con dubious to the merchants, and still can&#39;t buy nor sell (other than<br/>\nto the druids).  My questions are this:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) How many RE warbeads do I need to hand in?<br/>\n<br/>\n2) As I get higher in level, is it more required of me to regain faction?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only reason this really matters is because I can&#39;t buy my spells from<br/>\nthe cleric guild any more.  Otherwise, I wouldn&#39;t give a hoot.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Mike Schlagenhauf [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:trelane@...\">trelane@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: 1999/10/18 12:58 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] Testament of Vanear - SPOILER!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Mike Schlagenhauf&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:trelane@...\">trelane@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s actually an exact 7 hour spawn.
