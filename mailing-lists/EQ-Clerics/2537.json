If you&#39;re adventurous, make your way into any high level<br/>\ndungeon, Unrest or Cazic Thule would work well.  At 8th you could get<br/>\ninto Unrest somewhat easily, but Cazic would be difficult.  you&#39;d have<br/>\nto run from the guards outside, then you&#39;d have to gate out, but you&#39;d<br/>\nwant to gate out anyway with my money-making idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, walk into a dungeon and advertise that you are going to buy<br/>\nFS weapons.  You&#39;ll pay 3 plat for maces and hammers, and 2 plat for<br/>\nswords and daggers.  These are relatively cheap prices, and people may<br/>\nbe willing to sell to you so they don&#39;t have to go to a merchant. This<br/>\nrequires an initial investment on your part of 20-30 plat.  Maybe you<br/>\ncould get an interest free loan from a high level friend. :)  As soon<br/>\nas you are loaded down, you gate back to the bank (get a bind there,<br/>\nfirst), and you make a tidy profit.  Wash/rinse/repeat.  Another way<br/>\nis to offer to exchange copper/silver for 15 copper to 1 silver.  In<br/>\nother words, they give you 15 copper, you give them 1 silver back.<br/>\nA lot of people will probably go for this.  I had 500 copper in Cazic<br/>\none time, and the penny-pincher that I am, went all the way to bank to<br/>\nclaim my 5 gold!  Most people destroy copper after a certain level.<br/>\n300 copper weighs about 10 pounds, and is just not worth carrying<br/>\naround.  If they can exchange it, they probably will.  Using the math<br/>\n(300/15)=20 silver that&#39;s 2 gold. you could *buy* 300 copper for 2 gp.<br/>\nThe profit here won&#39;t be great, but if you do it enough it will be.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother way to make money, is collect bone chips, and walk into<br/>\nNektulos forest (you&#39;re safe right near the zone), and sell 10 bone<br/>\nchips for a plat.  Clerics can get bone chips easy enough.  Any place<br/>\nwhere there are high level necros hanging out, they will want to buy<br/>\nthese.  The more the better.  Also, kill the pirahna fish in Rivervale<br/>\nenough and you&#39;ll get lots of fish scales.  (I had 100 once), and sell<br/>\nthose to Druids for a tidy profit.  Spider silk is sought out by<br/>\nwizards, too, and you can sell bat wings as well.  These are all some<br/>\nideas.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Levi Kemp&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:levikemp@...\">levikemp@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] wis items<br/>\n&gt;Date: Mon, 13 Dec 1999 10:39:30 -0600<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&lt;&lt; text2.html &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&lt;&lt; text3.html &gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
