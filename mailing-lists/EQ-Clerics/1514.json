I&#39;m currently <br/>\n17th, and was hunting with a group my level and our pulls seemed to be <br/>\ngrabbing way to much.  And there were about 60 people in the zone at the time <br/>\nso it wasn&#39;t like the house was exactly empty.  I was talking to one of my <br/>\nfriend about this and he said they increased the agro radius of undead <br/>\ncreatures.  This seems to be what has been happening.  As a novice of mine, I <br/>\nwas training alot of decaying skeletons across Everfrost because if you <br/>\nattack one, it seems like everyone around for a *huge* radius would come and <br/>\njoin the fight.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Rydel of Bristlebane</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
