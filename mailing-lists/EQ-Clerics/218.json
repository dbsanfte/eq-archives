My friend (lvl 48 cleric) says he is very offense<br/>\noriented.  It all depends on what his group is fighting.  If it&#39;s a<br/>\ntough solo mob, he burns about half his mana on casting (he does 565 dam<br/>\na pop) and the other half on healing.  Medding whenever possible. <br/>\nClerics don&#39;t have to save all their mana for healing.  Most fights I<br/>\ncome out with 80% mana.  Soo..  I now dedicate more of my mana to<br/>\noffense too.  Find a happy place.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
