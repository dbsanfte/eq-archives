My bard COVETS silk because<br/>\nshe is a tailor and it is a BIG pain to get it yourself. Everytime I find it<br/>\nin the merchants, I buy it. Those are my best tailoring pieces. If someone<br/>\nwas auctioning selling spider silk, I&#39;d snap it up. (I don&#39;t auction buyig<br/>\nbecause I&#39;ve found people don&#39;t respond to that very well)<br/>\n<br/>\nI find bone chips and bat wings are the easiest things to sell. The only<br/>\nplace fish scales are really desired enough to pay premium prices is up near<br/>\nKedge Keep. My druid carries a stack of 20 around and has never used any in<br/>\n5 levels.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
