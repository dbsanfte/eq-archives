Bug Fixes: - Players","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-77368647\">This is the patch list as I got it yesterday......Havent played yet myself,<br/>\nbeen sick....but this is it:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSeptember 13th, 9:00am<br/>\n----------------------<br/>\nBug Fixes:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Players levitating should be easier for other PCs to see.<br/>\n<br/>\n- When charmed/feared and killed players should not be returned to the<br/>\ncharacter selection screen.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Lore items in containers that are dropped should not be destroyed.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Charged items, such as the Staff of the Observers, should correctly report<br/>\nthe number of charges remaining after zoning.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Corpses should remain lootable even if a player goes linkdead while<br/>\nlooting<br/>\n<br/>\n- A player under the effect of charm or fear can no longer open their<br/>\nspellbook or sit in order to escape the effects of these spells.<br/>\n<br/>\n- A player using online help should no longer be locked into the help screen<br/>\nif another party initiates a trade.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Non-melee items equipped in weapon slots should no longer mutate if the pc<br/>\nis charmed.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Extremely large NPCs, ie Vox, should not suicide when stuck. <br/>\n<br/>\nNew emotes:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Here is a list of new emotes that have been added to the game: agree,<br/>\namaze, apologize, applaud, plead, bite, bleed, blink, blush, boggle, bonk,<br/>\nbored, brb, burp, bye, cackle, calm, clap, comfort, congratulate, cough,<br/>\ncringe, curious, dance, drool , duck, eye, gasp, giggle, glare, grin ,<br/>\ngroan, grovel, happy, hungry, introduce, jk (just kidding) , kneel, lost,<br/>\nmassage, moan, mourn , peer, point, ponder, puzzle, raise, ready, roar,<br/>\nsalute, shiver, shrug, sigh, smirk, snarl, snicker, stare, tap, tease,<br/>\nthank, thirsty, veto, welcome, whine, whistle, yawn PVP Changes:<br/>\n<br/>\n- In order to make PVP combat between spellcasters and melee types more<br/>\nviable some changes to PVP spell effects have been made. All damage spells<br/>\ncast in PVP combat will do less damage to the PC than the same spell would<br/>\ndo to an NPC. When a PC is under the effect of a root-type spell there is a<br/>\n20% chance that they will break free when a direct damage spell is cast upon<br/>\nthem. <br/>\n<br/>\nSpell Changes:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Levitate: All players may now cancel this effect.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Paralyzing Earth now Wizard and Necromancer useable.<br/>\n<br/>\n- The Mana cost on some Magician damage shields has been slightly reduced<br/>\n<br/>\n- Alter Plane: Hate and Alter Plane: Sky have been changed into higher level<br/>\nspells.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Succor: Ro (Druid) is now a level 39 spell (previously a typo as a level<br/>\n49 spell)<br/>\n<br/>\n- Curse of the Simple Mind (Enchanter) now lowers both Int AND Wis.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Selo`s Consonant Chain (Bard) should now work better.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Shadow Vortex (Necro) is more effective.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Screaming Terror is now an all or nothing save - this should stop the<br/>\n&#39;train&#39; problems that it was causing.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Gravity Flux will now research correctly for Wizards.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Lich and Bond of Death are now researchable for Necromancers - check your<br/>\ntomes.<br/>\n<br/>\n- The different types of Words of Collection and Words of Acquisition are<br/>\nnow more easily identifiable.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Dead Man Walking (Necromancer) has been renamed Dead Man Floating<br/>\n<br/>\n- Ignite Bones (Necromancer) has had the movement component removed. This<br/>\nmeans that it will no longer break root and snare spells, and that it will<br/>\nnow stack with the darkness line.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Syvelian`s Anti-Magic Aria (Bard) has been fixed.<br/>\n<br/>\n- A bug in some of the AoE code has been fixed - AoE spells will now effect<br/>\nmore monsters.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Some Magician Summoned items are now lore items. Items that have turned<br/>\nlore have had other small benefits added to them.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Dance of the Fireflies (Druid) has been changed from Divination to<br/>\nConjuration.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Rangers have gained the spell Dance of the Fireflies (level 15)<br/>\n<br/>\n- High Level Enchanter Illusion spells have had the remainder of their<br/>\neffects implemented.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Magi research components have been added to more monsters throughout the<br/>\nworld.<br/>\n<br/>\n- There is a new pet command: /pet taunt and /pet notaunt. Pets default to<br/>\n/pet taunt<br/>\n<br/>\n- The Rods for the Ice Comet quests will now pop much more often.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Envenomed Breath (Shaman) has had its damage raised slightly.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Scourge (Necromancer and Shaman) has had its damage raised slightly.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Enchantment of Light and Enchantment of Brilliance (Enchanter) have been<br/>\nreplaced by new enchantment spells. These spells have been added to a hidden<br/>\nvendor somewhere in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\n- New quests for Necromancers to research their pets have been added <br/>\n<br/>\nPets:<br/>\n<br/>\n- High level pets (44th and 49th lvl spells) do less damage<br/>\n<br/>\n- Pets will now navigate some outdoor and dungeon areas better <br/>\n<br/>\nDoT Changes:<br/>\n<br/>\n- If the monster is in melee with you, there is no change to how a DoT spell<br/>\nworks.<br/>\n<br/>\n- If the monster is running away from you (fear, wounded, etc.), there is no<br/>\nchange to how a DoT spell works.<br/>\n<br/>\n- If the monster is moving when the damage from the DoT is applied (happens<br/>\nevery few seconds), it will take 66% of the damage that it would have taken.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n- DoT spells have all had their duration slightly increased. If the monster<br/>\nmoves for 18 seconds during a fight, it will take as much damage from the<br/>\nDoT as it would before the patch. If the monster moves for less then 18<br/>\nseconds during a fight, your DoT will do more damage then it would have done<br/>\nbefore the patch. If the monster moves more then 18 seconds during the<br/>\nfight, it will take less damage then it would have before the patch.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
