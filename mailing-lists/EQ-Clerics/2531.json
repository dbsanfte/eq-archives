I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1512337487\">I keep an ongoing wishlist, and I revise it occasionally if I get an<br/>\nitem, or if I get high enough level to obtain something that I<br/>\npreviously couldn&#39;t.  I just made 24, and I thought I would add a few<br/>\nof the cleric quest armor pieces to the list.  I didn&#39;t add all of<br/>\nthem, but I added a few that are better than what I currently have.  I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t add the chestplate since I don&#39;t want to camp Bilge, and I want<br/>\na BS tunic, anyway.  I didn&#39;t add the legs since I would rather have<br/>\ngatorscale legs, and I didn&#39;t add the shield (who would?).  The rest<br/>\nseemed decent enough.  Now then, I have a few questions,<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m trying for the boots, gauntlets, arms bracers, and the caduceus..<br/>\nFor those that have done these quests, are they obtainable by a 24th<br/>\nlevel cleric (i.e., me)?  Specifically, the boots (stumpwatch,<br/>\ncabinwatch shouldn&#39;t be hard), don&#39;t know about the rest. Possible?<br/>\nWhat level is Babbinsbort?  What level is Gull?  And how do you get<br/>\nto him?<br/>\nLooks like the bracers require killing some mid 30s ghoul, so I will<br/>\nwait on these.<br/>\nWhat level is the greater darkbone skeleton in Rathe mountains?<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do I make galvanized, magnetized, and vulcanized platinum bars?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for any info,<br/>\nErgo Soulhealer<br/>\ntest server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
