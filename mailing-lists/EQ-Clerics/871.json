Its<br/>\nfast and uses little mana. He also has cure blindness and he would be<br/>\nstupid<br/>\nto not have it memorized. If he is a lower level it can last a<br/>\nreasonable<br/>\ntime.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI was told by a friend who hunted in Runnyeye that Verant issued a patch<br/>\nthat caused your ENTIRE screen to go black when you get blinded. I will<br/>\nhave to try this on myself. Because if this is the case, then even<br/>\nthough the troll shaman has me targeted, he will be unable to use his<br/>\nmouse to click his memorized spells. He WILL be able to cast spells IF<br/>\nhe has hotkeyed them AND remembers which keyboard number goes to which<br/>\nspell....but I know for a fact that this shaman hasn&#39;t done that.<br/>\nSo......It looks like I&#39;m going to be a Flash of Light caster on Sunday<br/>\nnight at the PVP grounds in Neriak. Hmm....maybe I should first cast<br/>\nInvulnerability on myself to get him to waste his mana, then blast him<br/>\nwith Flash of Light, and keep blasting him with it while I melee the<br/>\ncrap out of him.....means that I&#39;m going to have to memorize extinguish<br/>\nfatigue as well, cause it&#39;s gonna take me FOREVER to melee him to death.<br/>\nAnd I should probably memorize Cancel magic in case he decides to root<br/>\nme....But someone said earlier that Cancel magic starts at the top of<br/>\nthe stack. Why? That&#39;s where all MY buffs are! If I remember correctly<br/>\n(from Highpass and the gnoll shamans who cast root), I think Cancel<br/>\nmagic starts at the bottom of the stack. Otherwise, it would be a<br/>\nworthless friggin spell, eh?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the suggestions so far...keep them coming...and let me know<br/>\nwhat you think of the Flash of Light strategy :)<br/>\n<br/>\nSaidinn</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
