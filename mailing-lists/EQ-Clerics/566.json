You must have had a really bad group. I lived in Unrest from level 16<br/>\n&gt; until level 20, made lots of loot, didn&#39;t die any more than I did elsewhere,<br/>\n&gt; and came out with a full set of bronze armor. I moved on only because I<br/>\n&gt; thought I was getting a little stale, and I knew I was going to have to be<br/>\n&gt; level 24 or 25 before I could safely fight in the barroom or the tower, or<br/>\n&gt; level 30 before I could go to the basement. And when I hit those levels, I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; a&#39;comin&#39; back!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Unfortunately, a lot of other people like Unrest, too, which is why it isn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; unusual to see 100 people in that zone on Fennin Ro, evenings =(.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s true, the trains can be amazing. But one nice thing about Unrest is<br/>\n&gt; that the lawn is so wide open, you can often get out of the way of the<br/>\n&gt; train, which you can&#39;t do in Befallen or Guk, or even Crushbone often. It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; awe inspiring to watch two festering hags, a werebat, a greater darkbone or<br/>\n&gt; two, a couple of mortuary fungi, a tentacle terror, the dwarven spirit and a<br/>\n&gt; gaggle of tormented dead, darkbones, lurking mummies and death beetles<br/>\n&gt; thunder past you, headed for the exit!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; == Gilead, dwarven cleric of Fennin Ro </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
