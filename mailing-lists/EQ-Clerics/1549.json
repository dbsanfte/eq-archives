Though the strange thing  is, my lag metre doesn&#39;t show any<br/>\nlag.  I have experience the following problems:<br/>\n<br/>\n    1) Travelling:  When travelling, I get these pauses, where the whole<br/>\nscreen sort of &#39;stops&#39; every 10 - 15 seconds.  This makes long trips over<br/>\nzones very annoying.<br/>\n<br/>\n    2) Fighting:  Two nites in a row now, I have been in Befallen, and had<br/>\nmobs trained on me.  NOrmally, I can outrun them to safety.  But the past<br/>\nwhile, the lag seems to prevent me from casting spells and hitting back.<br/>\nHowever, the mobs seem to do the same amount of dmg no matter what the lag<br/>\nsituation is.  I know you may think that I am just expressing sour grapes<br/>\nfor dying, but it isn&#39; t the case.  I have bee killed many times before, and<br/>\nrightly so.  But the deaths lately, when related to lag, seem to give the<br/>\nmobs an unfair advantage.<br/>\n<br/>\n    3)Item usage: Lag has prevented my door keys from working right away in<br/>\nBefallen. I find I have to click things two or three times to get them to<br/>\nwork.  This applies to looting, selling, trading, and using items such as<br/>\nkeys.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Any ways, I just want to know if any of you have had any of these<br/>\nproblems of late.  I am really trying to figure out if this is a link<br/>\nrelated problem, or if a recent patch affected playablility in this manner.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    Chris.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
