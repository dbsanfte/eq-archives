I&#39;ve played<br/>\nseveral characters on the Rathe that were self made meaning they were<br/>\nrunning around in cloth and scrounging money for spells for lvl&#39;s they<br/>\nhad passed.  Camping is boring and i&#39;d rather play the game than camp an<br/>\nitem.  I will however check such a location as Trainer Hill for an<br/>\nopportunity on that Shiney Brass Shield which is a highly coveted item.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHaving a wizard pop out of the shadows to steal your kill so you can see<br/>\na SBS auctioned at a price way beyond your means might be part of the<br/>\ngame or a reflection on real life.  Typically those wizards are high lvl<br/>\nand are there to steal Crush and possibly Dvinn from groups that are<br/>\ntanking. When unsuccessful they go to Trainer Hill to steal.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne time i was in a party of 6 lvl 9 and 10 lvl characters.  A nice<br/>\ngroup for the trainer.  A lvl 34 druid shows up and initiates talk while<br/>\nwe are in group chat.  The trainer pops up and he instantly decides that<br/>\nhe wants it and steals it from my group.  Turns out he was stealing from<br/>\nthe poor to give to the poor.  A regular Robin Hood I called him.  He<br/>\nwas just there to play God cause he was bored.  Experiences like that<br/>\nreally taint my enjoyment of the game.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf that is going to be an ongoing occurance from the SBS to J boots or<br/>\nwhatever, THEN I WELCOME VERANT CHAMPIONING THE CAUSE OF THE LOW LVL<br/>\nPLAYER!<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is however the incidence of twinked low lvl players being<br/>\nmanufactured into 25th lvl characters in 24 hours with the massive<br/>\nassistance of high lvl characters who erase damage inventories caused by<br/>\nhigh lvl characters.  The low lvl character steps in when the creature<br/>\nhas a thread of life and scores the kill on a few points damage.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy 17 Cleric in Befallen scored three kills with three blasts while<br/>\nhelping with what he thought was a third lvl train that was brought to<br/>\nthe atrium at the entrance to lvl 2.  Turns out the second and part of<br/>\nthe third lvl&#39;s were being drained for the benefit of characters that<br/>\nwere lvl 10 to 12 at the time i checked the list of Befallen players.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy Cleric, with nothing to do, and not interested in interfering with<br/>\nthe organized crime on The Rathe, decided to log off and come back<br/>\nanother day.  Some day he might decide not to come back if things don&#39;t<br/>\nchange.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding trainer hill, I have since learned that when the Hill is empty<br/>\nto ask if there are any invisible or hiding characters in line, or<br/>\npossibly someone up in that tree on the left.  Believe me, scum wizards<br/>\nhave no courtesy and my list of non-eligable resurrections is dominated<br/>\nby wizards.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCharacter name anonymous<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn Erik Maynus wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;John Erik Maynus&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jmaynus@...\">jmaynus@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What I think should be forced is not the fact if you are camping for an item<br/>\n&gt; and you get no exp for the kill and me and my group comes along I shouldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; have the right to say &quot;OK buddy move along&quot; but it should be forced that you<br/>\n&gt; have to share, you get your turn then me and my group, then you and then me<br/>\n&gt; and my group, etc.....<br/>\n&gt; I have camped in Crush Bone for the Shiny Brass Shield before and watched a<br/>\n&gt; lvl 20 wizard EVERYTIME the Trainer spawned he&#39;d jump up and blast him.  The<br/>\n&gt; wizard gave no one a chance to kill the trainer.  Even when someone came up<br/>\n&gt; and said &quot;I got the next Trainer!&quot; the wizard would laugh and go &quot;If you<br/>\n&gt; think you can&quot; or something like that.<br/>\n&gt; So instade of getting banned for not yielding it should be banned after 3<br/>\n&gt; warnings of not sharing the spawn.  I know thats what Mik and Mystix are<br/>\n&gt; saying that we should be able to share the spawn but how many ppl do you<br/>\n&gt; know that truely shares them?  I&#39;ve seen and heard about many players that<br/>\n&gt; would not share.  But in away it should be &quot;first come first served&quot; but not<br/>\n&gt; to the point of &quot;We were here first, it&#39;s our camp now go away&quot; it should be<br/>\n&gt; they were there first they get the first shot at the spawn but once they had<br/>\n&gt; their kill and no loot then it&#39;s back to the end of the line to let the next<br/>\n&gt; person have a chance.<br/>\n&gt; But to me Brad needs to changing it from Yield Policy to Sharing Policy.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; **************************<br/>\n&gt; Azor<br/>\n&gt; Lvl 18 Human Cleric of the Rathe<br/>\n&gt; **************************<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Mystik &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mystik@...\">mystik@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; i didn&#39;t say that was right now did i? there are jerks everywhere you go,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; unavoidable....all you can do is report em....that they&#39;re disrupting<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you....that isn&#39;t right for them to do that, but i do think if you&#39;re at a<br/>\n&gt; place<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for an item and you get no exp, you shouldn&#39;t have to leave like<br/>\n&gt; that..that&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; not fair<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; FlashD wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: &quot;FlashD&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:DunleyG@...\">DunleyG@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; First come First Served<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  YA RIGHT !!!!!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  So Mik and  Mystic  If that&#39;s your idea of fairness  then the next time<br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; level 50 wizard shows up and nukes a mob  my  group has been  camping<br/>\n&gt; for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hours , should I tell them  &quot;Mik says its first com first served&quot;  and<br/>\n&gt; to go<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; away.
