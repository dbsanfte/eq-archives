Cazic Thule is good.   You need groups in both places, no chance to solo... but if you can find yourself a good group those are both great places for xp.   Also, Unrest really is good... I know it sucks when you an&#39;t find a group, but I got levels 24 and 25 camping the Hand room in unrest.   <br/>\n<br/>\nEachann Bronzeleaf<br/>\n27th level cleric of Tunare, Tarew marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: Alvarez, Ruben (consultant) &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ruben.alvarez@...\">ruben.alvarez@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, November 11, 1999 4:02 PM<br/>\nSubject: [EQ-Clerics] Hey all<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Alvarez, Ruben (consultant)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ruben.alvarez@...\">ruben.alvarez@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well I am back :P  Took a nice 3 month break from my cleric and EQ.  WOW<br/>\n&gt; have things changed.  I was in High Hold going to East Co and had to go<br/>\n&gt; through Kichlor Forest.  I almost died trying to get through.  I didnt know<br/>\n&gt; they changed that area.  DAMN!!!!!!  Anyway....  The reason I decided to<br/>\n&gt; leave because I couldnt find a group in any of the places.  I still couldnt<br/>\n&gt; believe noone wanted a cleric in their group.  Well I am level 25 and just<br/>\n&gt; wondering where can I hunt?  The best places that a cleric will feel<br/>\n&gt; welcomed,  and if you say unrest no way!!!!
