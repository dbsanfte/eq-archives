I play a Cleric on<br/>\nRallos Zek (PvP) and my main rationale is I like to heal. I play a &quot;good&quot;<br/>\ncleric and have healed bad/good races. My main irritation is when I&#39;m<br/>\nsuddenly PK&#39;d by a member of my own race. (High Elf. I hang my head in shame<br/>\nat my fallen brothers and sisters)<br/>\n <br/>\nAnyway normally there is a +/- 4 range for PvP correct? It seems to me that<br/>\nthe Cleric is uniquely positioned so that we can severely inconvenience<br/>\nother players far below our level. If they are fighting a MOB can we heal<br/>\nthe MOB? Can we buff it? I must admit I have never tried it, I just thought<br/>\nof it. Has anyone any experience of this??<br/>\n <br/>\nRegards<br/>\n <br/>\nNynenom of Rallos Zek</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
