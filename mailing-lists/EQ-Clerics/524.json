Nothing is ever perfect, and I <br/>\nchose to gripe about what was not perfect. Everquest is a great game besides <br/>\nthe events I had to endure.  <br/>\nPerhaps I did venture with some bad people- I have learned from the earlier <br/>\nposts that there are some great people out there in EQ. Perhaps I just have <br/>\nthe worse luck in the world when I am grouping. <br/>\n I am sorry to place my anger on EQ on this mailing list. I just wish people <br/>\nwouldnt think about reaching that next level so much- but I have learned from <br/>\nthe earlier posts that it is not true. <br/>\n I must have the worse luck on meeting people on the two servers I mainly <br/>\nplay!! Sorry everyone :) igore my earlier posts :)<br/>\n  T Alexander</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
