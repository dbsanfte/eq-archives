It uses small amount<br/>\nof manna and is relatively quick to cast. Generally I cast it and if not<br/>\nrooted I ran round the back of them and start hitting them. From the back no<br/>\nmelee weapon effects you.  I always use a 1 handed weapon (fast=28) on the<br/>\nprincipal that I have more chance to interrupt other players casts. I seldom<br/>\nuse stun though after that post I will reevaluate it. ( I just hate to waste<br/>\nmanna for no damage!) On the stun part. An experienced PvP Caster need not<br/>\nlook for you all he has to do is cast, unless of course he is being pounding<br/>\nfrom behind which puts them off.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would also suggest not to be hesitant to use divine aura quickly.<br/>\nEspecially if rooted. One hope is that you can be aided by other players.<br/>\nOtherwise the general wiz technique is root and nuke. If they don&#39;t notice<br/>\n(or do not understand) they may waste a lot of manna.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever I have in general lost to casters, mainly because the Pk&#39;s on Rallos<br/>\ntend to wait till your health is at the last bubble while fighting a MOB<br/>\nthen kill you with one/two unexpected blasts. Which Sucks.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat happened to me at the chessboard once. I had a good laugh though<br/>\nbecause I managed to cast flash of light on an undead bishop just before I<br/>\ndied. The PK&#39;r must have had a little shock to see the undead bishop and his<br/>\nsummoned pet bearing down on him. At least I would think so since his body<br/>\nwas next to mine when I came to claim my stuff. *grin*<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Mr. J Daniels [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warpig@...\">warpig@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, September 03, 1999 6:27 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] PvP strategies for clerics<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom:\t&quot;Mr. J Daniels&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warpig@...\">warpig@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nClerics can easily beat any pure type caster class of their same level.<br/>\nAll you have  to do is cast stun/ and the best offensive spell at your<br/>\nlevel.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat i typically do is stun the chaster, then run behind them quickly at<br/>\nan angle, then start nuking them.   When they unstun they take some time<br/>\nto turn around to look for you, when you notice this, stun them again.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt really works well.

I play a cleric on Vallon Zek<br/>\nand <br/>\n&gt; occationally battle other players. In my experience, clerics are not good <br/>\n&gt; offensively, but rather good defensively, especially grouped.<br/>\n&gt; Once a necromancer cast dots on me (engulfing darkness and boil blood I <br/>\n&gt; believe), plus fear. I dropped HPs rapidly, but managed to cast a couple<br/>\nof <br/>\n&gt; heals on myself, and then the DOTs wore off.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Can clerics generally survive a fight versus casters by healing<br/>\nthemselves? <br/>\n&gt; If I cast 4 greater heals on myself I can heal for 1200+ damage. Although<br/>\nI <br/>\n&gt; am not sure, I doubt a wizard will have the mana to deliver 2000 damage at<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; my level (24), and some of his damage might be resisted. Assuming I have <br/>\n&gt; full armour, I should be able to root and melee the caster to death.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Other useful spells are blindness and stun. I use the low level variants<br/>\nof <br/>\n&gt; stun since they take less mana. Divine aura is useful since the attacker <br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t always observe that I am invulnerable, especially casters, since <br/>\n&gt; they don&#39;t get any damage information (=&quot;blabla hit by non melee for 140 <br/>\n&gt; damage&quot; etc).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Buying an egg shaped pumice is also a good investment, although it is<br/>\nquite <br/>\n&gt; expensive. It is a magic item sold by some vendors (in Neriak, the one<br/>\nnear <br/>\n&gt; the bank) and has 5 charges of &quot;pillage enchantment&quot;, that will cancel <br/>\n&gt; several effects like charm/DOTs (and buffs) at the same time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;              Free Games & Cash Prizes!<br/>\n&gt; Gamesville - The World&#39;s Biggest & Best Game Show Site!<br/>\n&gt;         <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/ad/gamesville0\">http://www.onelist.com/ad/gamesville0</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n             Free Games & Cash Prizes!<br/>\nGamesville - The World&#39;s Biggest & Best Game Show Site!<br/>\n        <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/ad/gamesville0\">http://www.onelist.com/ad/gamesville0</a><br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
