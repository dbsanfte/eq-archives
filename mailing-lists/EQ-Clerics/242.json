You should have specialized in alteration(hopefully guys thats the<br/>\n&gt; right one for healing:)P) I know a lvl 43 cleric who has specialized in this<br/>\n&gt; and the difference is amazing your heals heal more hpts, faster casting very<br/>\n&gt; rarely does he not recover if hit when healing and it takes only close to<br/>\n&gt; half the mana that a cleric who doesn&#39;t specialize uses. The results are<br/>\n&gt; amazing at higfher lvls. However man dont think im gripping at you because i<br/>\n&gt; have read your other mails and you know what your talking about. Its just i<br/>\n&gt; would have picked the healing specialization....but now that I think about<br/>\n&gt; it man your undead spells will be much much more efficient so maybe it was a<br/>\n&gt; good choice. Now if you would have oicked something like divination or<br/>\n&gt; conjuring we would have a really  really big problem on our hands. Well<br/>\n&gt; thanks for hearing me out man...Later and goodluck.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Krix Mathar<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Guardians of Lore<br/>\n&gt; P.S. The way it goes is when you specialize you can specialize in all your<br/>\n&gt; fields but the first one to go over 50 is the one you will be the best at<br/>\n&gt; and amy keep going up in all the others can not go past 50.. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
