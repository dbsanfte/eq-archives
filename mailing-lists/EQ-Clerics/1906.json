You may be able <br/>\n     to get a decent weapon but when you only hit once every 10 swings the <br/>\n     damage doesn&#39;t add up very fast.  When I&#39;m in a group it&#39;s strictly <br/>\n     med and heal with maybe the odd stun thrown in.<br/>\n     <br/>\n     As far as soloing goes, It can be done by a cleric fairly easily once <br/>\n     you hit L44 (power level for clerics imo).  I pretty much soloed from <br/>\n     47 to 50 by fighting spectres in oasis and oot as well as a few other <br/>\n     npc&#39;s.  I personally have no trouble pulling spectres single, have <br/>\n     never fought them in feerott though.  Experience had really started to <br/>\n     slow down from the dungeons and soloing was a nice change from the <br/>\n     med/heal routine.<br/>\n     <br/>\n     As far as mana goes, my base wisdom is 105 and I am currently at 170 <br/>\n     and should be able to get it to 190 before to long (still need a paw). <br/>\n      I can take out 2 spectres solo before I need to med and haven&#39;t had <br/>\n     much problems with mana when grouped.<br/>\n     <br/>\n     Drogo Darkbane<br/>\n     The Rathe<br/>\n     <br/>\n     <br/>\n______________________________ Reply Separator _________________________________<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] Mana<br/>\nAuthor:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] Mana at internet <br/>\nDate:    1999-09-19 8:00 AM<br/>\n     <br/>\n     <br/>\nFrom: &quot;Mikaela&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mikaela@...\">mikaela@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n     <br/>\nHate to discourage you, but at higher levels, you will melee VERY little. <br/>\nYour value is healing and buffing.  And the damage you will be able to do <br/>\nagainst high level mobs is very minimal.  You will be fighting mobs with <br/>\n1000s of hps at high levels, and a lot of them have very high magic <br/>\nresistance, so your spells are useless cause they are resisted most always. <br/>\nAnd these mobs hit HARD...some for over 100 hps damage a pop.  You can&#39;t <br/>\nsurvive at melee with these mobs, only the big tanks can.  You serve one <br/>\npurpose mainly, and that is healing to keep everyone alive. Regarding undead, <br/>\n clerics used to be able to solo specs quite easily with undead spells, but <br/>\nthey changed the pathing of them at the spec cave in Feerott and now it&#39;s <br/>\ndangerous cause you can&#39;t really pull them solo anymore.  You pull one and <br/>\ntwo or three come, and that&#39;s BAD news.<br/>\n     <br/>\nRegarding the mana issue....you will need to get your hands on as many <br/>\nwisdom enhancing items as you can, because you will need all the mana you <br/>\ncan get to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of your healing powers. <br/>\nThe more mana you have the longer you can keep your group alive and the less <br/>\nmed time you have.  So start amassing those wisdom items and try to get your <br/>\nwisdom at least up into the 170s minimum.<br/>\n     <br/>\nSorry to disillusion you, but high levels clerics are relegated mostly to <br/>\nhealing and buffing and medding.  That&#39;s what your specialty is and at those <br/>\nlevels, the other healing classes can&#39;t come close to our healing powers <br/>\nwith our superior and complete heal.  The good news is that no high level <br/>\ngroup ventures anywhere without at least one good cleric.  YOu are a MUST <br/>\nhave.<br/>\n     <br/>\n Mik<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Niomar &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Niomar@...\">Niomar@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, October 19, 1999 12:11 AM <br/>\nSubject: [EQ-Clerics] Mana<br/>\n     <br/>\n     <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Niomar&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Niomar@...\">Niomar@...</a>&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Okay, I am now lvl 10 and really concerned about this.  From what EVERYONE <br/>\n&gt; tells me (which I totally disagree with and the whole subject matter makes <br/>\n&gt; me sick) is that when older (25+) all we do is heal...no melee, no DD, <br/>\njust<br/>\n&gt; heal and med.  First...is that true or can we still melee..I know we won&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; exactly be able to solo melee...but as in a group or possibly as the only <br/>\n&gt; tank?..and while on that subject, can we solo undead up into all our <br/>\nhigher<br/>\n&gt; lvls or do we still need help then too?  And finally the mana issue.  I am <br/>\n&gt; dwarven cleric and have a 100 in strength and 103 in wisdom...will that be <br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; high enough wisdom to have proper mana to heal my group and such?  Any <br/>\nother<br/>\n&gt; tips would be most helpful.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Niomar, Dwarven Cleric of 10 trainings.  Xegony Server.<br/>\n&gt; Telikas, Dark Elven Mage of 14 trainings.

Any good cleric websites with detailed spell descriptions (like how <br/>\n&gt; much damage our spells deal, how much HPs our healing spells heal, and the <br/>\n&gt; exact numbers on our buffs, etc)<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
