It also has a necro or something standing at the<br/>\ngate protecting it.  I think that there are already PLENTY of precautions to<br/>\nkeep low level players out. I don&#39;t know how in the hell that the level 1<br/>\nogres got in there. I tried it just so I could see the planes, and I had SOW<br/>\non a level one Ogre and got toasted by the spectres when I was barely inside<br/>\nthe cave.<br/>\n<br/>\nAstur il&#39;Ayan, Cleric of Brell<br/>\nSolusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Paul Heenan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pheenan@...\">pheenan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am not flaming you, Azor.

There should be some<br/>\n&gt; serious side-effects for trying to enter a place of this magnitude. From<br/>\n&gt; what I hear, this place has some of the rarest items in the game, and<br/>\n&gt; god-like creatures roam the land freely. Setting foot in this place should<br/>\n&gt; come with some consequence, much less getting close to it. I<br/>\n&gt; agree with the<br/>\n&gt; gate idea. Also, I thought the passageway to the gate was guarded by 2 35+<br/>\n&gt; level spectres? (could be wrong on that)<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve never been near this place, but I don&#39;t think it would be<br/>\n&gt; too fun if I<br/>\n&gt; could just stroll right in a grab that Cleric-only armor I&#39;ve been hearing<br/>\n&gt; about.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Drizben D&#39;vorn<br/>\n&gt; High Priest of Innoruuk </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
