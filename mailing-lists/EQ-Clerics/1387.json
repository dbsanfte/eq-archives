I think they<br/>\nshould be focusing on some very serious problems, such as the Plane of Fear<br/>\nwhich they ruined and so many high levels leaving the game because of<br/>\nboredom, nothing to do and now this unfair &quot;yield&quot; policy.<br/>\n<br/>\n At the auction on Saturday, I saw two people buy Boxes of Abu-Kar, one for<br/>\n1550 plat the other for 1700 plat.  Two days later guess what...they are<br/>\nworth about 5 plat.  Sure Verant....it was another &quot;code error&quot; or typo that<br/>\nyou simply had to fix.  Don&#39;t insult my intelligence!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI am about at the point where I am ready to leave EQ for another game or<br/>\nsomething where everytime you turn around the developers aren&#39;t shafting<br/>\nyou.  So many in my guild and on my server are simply leaving or selling<br/>\ntheir characters.  And they aren&#39;t all level 50s either.  I say shame on<br/>\nVerant for what they have done and are doing to the players.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my opinion, as always.....flame away, because I really don&#39;t care<br/>\nanymore<br/>\n<br/>\nMik</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
