The named shark is level 49.  Some of the<br/>\nmobs inside KK can see invisible, so invising in to the good stuff is not<br/>\nalways possible.  Some of the mermaids (forget which ones) can complete heal<br/>\nthemselves and each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe named sharks and rares are on a pretty low spawn rate - and in certain<br/>\nareas with pillars underwater they have been seen to suicide themselves so<br/>\nkeep them ROOTED and take them down as quickly as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nA group of high 40&#39;s can do ok, but the fight with the level 49 is still<br/>\ngonna be rough, especially since it will have friends. =)<br/>\n<br/>\n~Sirensa<br/>\nPriestess of Innoruuk<br/>\nSolusek Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
