The<br/>\n&gt; question is that does dexterity effect in spellcasting any way? Does it make us<br/>\n&gt; to recover from mobs interrupting our spellcasting better? I have heard some<br/>\n&gt; clerics claim this. I have a dex of 98 and i do find it quite often that even if critters<br/>\n&gt; hit me HARD i am able to cast a healing spell. I have even gated several times<br/>\n&gt; out from a heated battle while being hit for a total of 70 dmg.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Just thinking if buying those jewellery craft items that raise dex are worth it :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Iyenya Goldenheart<br/>\n&gt; Lvl 27 dwarf cleric<br/>\n&gt; Innoruuk server<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; How has ONElist changed your life?<br/>\n&gt; Share your story with us at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
