I beleive that RP&#39;ing worlds parallel the real world,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;inthe real world, there are those who are poor, and need to beg for thier<br/>\n&gt;sustenance.  At the lower levels, I gained most of my armour and my money<br/>\n&gt;from begging.  Now I do it in a RP&#39;ing context, and not as &#39;Hey, got any<br/>\n&gt;free armour I can have?&#39;.  I think that this is a valid strategy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;As well, now that I am entering the teens, I don&#39;t need to beg as often.<br/>\n&gt;But I do barter with players, and when doing so, I subtly make them beleive<br/>\n&gt;that I am a poor cleric (which I really am). In doing so, I have made some<br/>\n&gt;great deals, and am able to get some good bargains on armour.  Last nite,<br/>\n&gt;for instance, I bought a bloodforge hammer for 15 pp, and a FS staff.  From<br/>\n&gt;what I could see, they usually went for around 30 pp.  In my opionion, its<br/>\n&gt;no different than trading in ussed car and dressing down and making the<br/>\n&gt;saleperson beleive you are poorer than you really are.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Any other thoughts?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Show your ONElist SPIRIT!<br/>\n&gt;&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/tshirt2\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/tshirt2</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt;With a new ONElist SHIRT available through our website.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
