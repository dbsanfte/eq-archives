We all know about the<br/>\n&gt;screaming mace, but i would like to Add about the Enamaled Black Mace which<br/>\n&gt;i currently have, does 8 damage, 28 speed and magical. Now i can rip some<br/>\n&gt;ass with this weapon. Not to mention im doing 198 damage with my new Wrath<br/>\n&gt;spell which is a upgrade from Smite. Now i need to stress that you toss the<br/>\n&gt;2H weapons and start working on 1H. At high levels you are going to need<br/>\n&gt;shields for sure, the more magic resistance you have the safer you will be.<br/>\n&gt;Right now i have a mistmoor shield which gives +10 Ac +10 resistance to<br/>\n&gt;Magic, Disease & poison. Believe me anyone that has been to Mistmoor knows<br/>\n&gt;that you need all the magic Resistance you can get. Not to mention we get<br/>\n&gt;buff spells, so currently when im fighting i have 60 resistance and seeing<br/>\n&gt;you resist 3 Shock Of Force spells in a row makes you breath a little bit<br/>\n&gt;better :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If anyone has any questions about spells or anything give me a shout<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Enursin, High Cleric &quot;Black Tower Guild&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Give back to your community through &quot;Grow to Give.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Deadline is June 19.
