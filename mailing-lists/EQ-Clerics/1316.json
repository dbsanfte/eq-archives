As I have previously said they<br/>\nthough have messed about too much in game with things suggested in the Beta<br/>\nphase which had they been done then wouldnt be winged about on a daily basis<br/>\nas they are now. That is my gripe about Beta not the fact it was released<br/>\ntoo early. As with the many i see posting in these newsgroups many have been<br/>\nplaying for like 1-2 months. What game have you ever played some of you for<br/>\nthat length of time be honest if you are a n RPG fan online seriously.<br/>\nInterplay could not even devise a stable engine for BG for most people even<br/>\nwhen played through Heat or Gamespy and that is with possibly a 2 Gig<br/>\ninstall. Here we are talking about a 500 MB install with the movie and<br/>\nweekly patching. At least it is playable.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot flaming you and have run slightly off topic here but just saw the<br/>\nreference to they should have kept it in the bag a bit more before spilling<br/>\nit out and wanted to say i am glad they did...<br/>\n<br/>\nRe AC have the beta and havnt got round to the down load yet as have heard<br/>\nsome bad reports plus didnt like there xp amway pyramid thing. Will have to<br/>\ndo it and form my own opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\nFair thee well<br/>\n<br/>\ntwylork<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Mike Schlagenhauf &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:trelane@...\">trelane@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, September 10, 1999 9:10 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] another topic<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Mike Schlagenhauf&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:trelane@...\">trelane@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Actually, there&#39;s not much else they&#39;re working on, other than<br/>\n&gt; stress-testing and zone population, that was in the letter I got when I<br/>\nwas<br/>\n&gt; accepted into the 2nd phase of the beta.  They&#39;re just doing minor<br/>\ntweaking<br/>\n&gt; here and there to fix bugs and make sure balance is right (something EQ<br/>\n&gt; should have paid more attention to in beta perhaps?), but they&#39;ve said<br/>\nthey<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t have very much left to do.  I will for one say that when I tried it,<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; played for maybe about 3 hours total before I got totally disgusted with<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; clunky interface, not to mention I&#39;m not a great fan of that style of<br/>\n&gt; gameplay.  *shrug*  Just figured I&#39;d throw out what MS/Turbine has said<br/>\n(and<br/>\n&gt; some of my opinions ^_^ ).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Mike<br/>\n&gt; Lohre Soulsaver<br/>\n&gt; Bristlebane Server<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: John Erik Maynus &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jmaynus@...\">jmaynus@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Friday, September 10, 1999 3:10 PM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] another topic<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;John Erik Maynus&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jmaynus@...\">jmaynus@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Asheron&#39;s Call isn&#39;t really Microsoft, it&#39;s Turbine&#39;s.
