","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-651142658\">At your level, the best 2 choices are the Shining Star of Light<br/>\nor the Bloodforge hammer.  Of course, you could just continue to use<br/>\nthe hammer of wrath, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo get the shining star of light requires real good Qeynos Priest of<br/>\nLife faction (and of course for you to journey to Qeynos).  Be sure<br/>\nto read this quest first (it is a qeynos-based quest).  The SSOL is<br/>\na decent 1h weapon that is 6/28, weighs 5 pounds, I think, and casts<br/>\n&#39;cleanse&#39;, which removes negative effects.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Bloodforge hammer is also a Qeynos quest (kind of).  This is what<br/>\nI did, while I was in Qeynos increased my PriestsofLife faction by<br/>\ndoing the blessed oil quest, I found Trumpy Irontoe near the docks<br/>\nand killed him (green to me at 12th), and got his head. Be warned, as<br/>\nthis will seriously lower your faction with some groups in Qeynos.<br/>\nThe BF hammer is 13/50 2h and adds +10 to saves vs. magic.  It weighs<br/>\n10 pounds.  This quest is a Kaladim quest, and you need to be amiable<br/>\nwith the stormguard(I think) in Kaladim - the dwarven fighter guild.<br/>\nI think killing Crushbone orcs raises that faction, so I didn&#39;t even<br/>\nhave to work on it, it was already amiable when I got there (Kaladim).<br/>\n<br/>\nI have both of these weapons.  I&#39;m trying to increase my 2h skill, but<br/>\nI switch to the SSOL when the going gets tough!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nErgo 13th level high elf cleric on test server<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Jason.Kazmaier@...\">Jason.Kazmaier@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m a level 10 cleric and have enjoyed the journey.  I wanted to be a <br/>\n&gt;purely caster cleric so I put 130 points into Wisdom. My strength however <br/>\n&gt;is only 60 which means that I can&#39;t equip the stronger heavier armor. <br/>\n&gt;That&#39;s okay, I fully expected this, however does anyone know of a good 2 <br/>\n&gt;handed or 1 handed weapon that is not very heavy.  I prefer it not to be <br/>\n&gt;over 10 pounds, lighter if possible.  Any suggestions would be helpful. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
