Two friends of mine","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1096830654\">I don&#39;t know about all scores, but I do know that the benefits of a<br/>\nhigh charisma seem to peg around 100 when trading with merchants.  Two<br/>\nfriends of mine tested a charisma of 95 versus a charisma of 110+ and<br/>\nthe price of items was the same.  So there is a cap on that one.<br/>\n(unless you&#39;re an enchanter, and the higher the charisma the better)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy theory on combat stats is that it matches your stat versus some<br/>\ncombat number of the creature.  My 2hblunt was like 20 points off max<br/>\nand I was fighting orcs in highhold, and it shot through the roof, and<br/>\nnow it is 1 point off max.  I noticed an incredible increase in the<br/>\namount of damage that I did, and the amount of times I was hitting.<br/>\nWhen I walk through newbie zones I always kill faction things like<br/>\norcs and gnolls, and it seems like I always hit them for 25 (with my<br/>\nBF hammer).  So to make a long story short, I think the skill itself<br/>\nhas a lot to do with the skill of the enemy.  It matches your number<br/>\nagainst theirs, and the difference is apparently how well you do when<br/>\nyou hit it.  Or something like that.  That&#39;s my theory anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n  So, bottomline, I think the higher the score, the better, but only<br/>\nagainst more and more powerful creatures.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Kevin Dailey &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Kevin_Dailey@...\">Kevin_Dailey@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: &quot;&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&#39;&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: [EQ-Clerics] A Question on Stats...<br/>\n&gt;Date: Tue, 12 Oct 1999 09:58:20 -0500<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;A question about stats...Does the law of diminishing returns come into<br/>\n&gt;play with our stats? Specifically, do we get less of a return on stats<br/>\n&gt;the higher they go? My agility is currently 141, and my dexterity is<br/>\n&gt;129...should I continue to try to find stat increasing items, or will it<br/>\n&gt;matter at all if I have 5 or 6 more agi than I do now? In fact, does it<br/>\n&gt;matter very much after 100?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Just curious, that&#39;s all :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Saidinn Witchwood<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&lt;&lt; text3.html &gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
