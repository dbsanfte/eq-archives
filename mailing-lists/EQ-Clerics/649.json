I<br/>\n&gt; do not know about the rest of you but I feel that clerics should get<br/>\n&gt; meditate at six and not have to wait until eight for it.  My seventh level<br/>\n&gt; cleric spends a lot of time just sitting waiting for mana for restore.   It<br/>\n&gt; is really glaring when you are grouped with spell casters and after the<br/>\n&gt; battle you heal them up and then have to sit for five or ten minutes to get<br/>\n&gt; your mana back when they are ready to go again in just two or three minutes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Let me know your feelings on this and I will try to get it started if there<br/>\n&gt; is enough support and if not then I will just live with it the way it is.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On a side note a very strange thing happened to me this morning.   I was<br/>\n&gt; hunting in Butcherblock and ran out of food.   Rather than making the long<br/>\n&gt; run back to Felwithe for more food I decided to gate.   I got a message<br/>\n&gt; about that zone being down and that they would put me in a safe place within<br/>\n&gt; my zone.   The safe place ended up just outside the dwarf city and I was<br/>\n&gt; near the GF zone point, but that is not the problem.   Everything except<br/>\n&gt; keyboard locked up tight.   I could not use my mouse to do anything at all.<br/>\n&gt; No casting, no sitting, no selling or buying and worst of all no camping to<br/>\n&gt; escape that mess and of course no GM&#39;s or Guides around.   I could not even<br/>\n&gt; do a soft boot to escape and ended up doing a hard re-boot.     I suppose<br/>\n&gt; that maybe I could have tried to get back to the GF zone point and try to<br/>\n&gt; zone out to see if that cleared it up but my defensive spells were about to<br/>\n&gt; wear off and I could not refresh them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks all for listening to my rantings,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Congratulations SAYNO2DRUGS.
