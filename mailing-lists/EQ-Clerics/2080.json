It wasn&#39;t the being dead part I couldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;believe but<br/>\n&gt;what it was he had in his hand.  Now remember his character is a<br/>\n&gt;Ranger, pic<br/>\n&gt;shows him wearing the new Ranger armor but in his hand was the SoulFire<br/>\n&gt;which is a Pally only weapon.  Can we say cheating?  Now if one of us tried<br/>\n&gt;that crap we&#39;d get banned from the game but he can wield a Pally<br/>\n&gt;only weapon<br/>\n&gt;when he&#39;s a Ranger?<br/>\n&gt;That shows me the ppl like Brad and GM can get away with anything in the<br/>\n&gt;game.  I also read on the EQ newsgroup that last Sunday the night of the<br/>\n&gt;events that the GM&#39;s were doing things that they&#39;ve told players not to do<br/>\n&gt;and if they did they&#39;d get banned for it.  Heard they were camping at zone<br/>\n&gt;points waiting for a player to zone over and kill them and also camping<br/>\n&gt;binding points and killing someone over and over everytime he/she died and<br/>\n&gt;came back at their bind point till they got ticked and pulled the plug on<br/>\n&gt;their modems.  If we would do that junk we&#39;d get banned for it.<br/>\n&gt;Can&#39;t wait to hear what Brad has to say about him wielding a SoulFire.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;**************************<br/>\n&gt;Azor Spellbound<br/>\n&gt;Lvl 24 Human Cleric of the Rathe<br/>\n&gt;**************************<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
