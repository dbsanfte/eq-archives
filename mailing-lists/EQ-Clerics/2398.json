I&#39;m not arguing your point, just askin the question.   I think that you may very well get more notice by doing it all on one server, if in fact you could get a huge turn out.  If you did it on all servers you would just spread it out more and get smaller turnouts on all servers instead of a huge showing on one.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOn a side note,  I think the point is moot... I think the powers that be have determined that that armor is all good and I don&#39;t believe they will be changing anything, even if we get 2000 clerics to sit in at freeport.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose you could start refusing heals and ressurections to make your point, but then you only hurt the other players and the GM&#39;s really don&#39;t give a giant rat&#39;s whiskers... so... oh well...<br/>\nLife goes on, and nobody bothers getting the cleric armor =)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Eachann Bronzeleaf,<br/>\n-Cleric of Tunare, Tarew Marr  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: Shannon Corley &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scorley1@...\">scorley1@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, November 29, 1999 9:17 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] Cleric Sit-in<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Shannon Corley &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scorley1@...\">scorley1@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I suggest we do this on every server.Why not? We need all the servers to<br/>\n&gt; get together on this one! Same spot on all servers. The more servers we<br/>\n&gt; do this on the more verant should take notice! Come on guys, I may not<br/>\n&gt; be a web master but lets all make a diffrence instead of those of you on<br/>\n&gt; the Fennin Ro server.Hope to see E&#39;ci players there.

Our purpose is to show Verant that a great number of Clerics<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and their friends are dissatisfied with the current state of the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Cleric-only armor quests that were meant to replace Rubicite. The<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Cleric-only armor presently has two flaws that we would like to see<br/>\n&gt; &gt; corrected. One, the quests themselves take a ridiculously long amount<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of time to complete (days or weeks for just one piece), and two, the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; armor class (AC) of the Cleric-only armor is not on par with classes<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of its type (The new Cleric-only armor&#39;s AC is actually *lower* than<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the original Rubicite).

I look forward to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; seeing everyone there, and in all hopes we can get Verant to listen to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; our suggestions.
