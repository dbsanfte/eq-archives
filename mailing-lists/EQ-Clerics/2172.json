I am real familiar with West<br/>\nCommons as I also play other classes and races.  There really is not a lot<br/>\nin W. Commons except for the orc camps if I remember correctly.   I do not<br/>\nthink Yilari is ready to solo wisps or asps yet.   Giant spiders and<br/>\ngrizzlies are also a problem.  There is the one undead ruin but it is<br/>\nheavily camped if I recall correctly.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can see N. Ro if a group is available though.  What is all in N. Ro?  I<br/>\nknow there are a lot of tarantulas and scarabs and some undead as well as<br/>\nthe dervish camps and madmen.  A few orc camps as well if I recall<br/>\ncorrectly.<br/>\n<br/>\nA lot to think about for sure.  Steamfront is off of L.
