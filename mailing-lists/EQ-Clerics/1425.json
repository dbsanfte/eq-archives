If you are the healer then you <br/>\nhave to tell yer party that the fighting and downtime go accourding to yer <br/>\nmanna, plain and simple!!  if they want you to heal then they have to wait <br/>\nfor yer manna to be at full unless its a lil thing that they can do without <br/>\nyou, in that case you med while they fight.  you will find that you are in <br/>\nhigher demand when you get to higher lvls.  just be patient and let them <br/>\nknow right from the start that you may not be the leader of the group but <br/>\nthe fighting does run on yer time, not theirs, as you are the one healing, <br/>\nand if they want you to melee then they should not expect heals at critical <br/>\nmoments<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Walt Zimbeck&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wzimbeck@...\">wzimbeck@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] the road less traveled...<br/>\n&gt;Date: Sun, 19 Sep 1999 18:18:39 -0500<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: &quot;Walt Zimbeck&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wzimbeck@...\">wzimbeck@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I have been following this thread with considerable interest.  I am running<br/>\n&gt;a high elf cleric on Erollisi Marr who is currently nine.  My problem is<br/>\n&gt;that is hard to get into a group since a lot still want to solo at this age<br/>\n&gt;level and the groups that do offer want to either go to Crushbone or like<br/>\n&gt;today to the Chessboard.   When I have grouped I try to aid in melee and<br/>\n&gt;still watch the health of the party members.  I do not use Furor at all in<br/>\n&gt;combat saving my mana for healing and buffing only.  I have also had a <br/>\n&gt;group<br/>\n&gt;not give me a chance to med back to even 50% before starting to fight <br/>\n&gt;again.<br/>\n&gt;Another problem of course is that once I begin to heal the mob starts<br/>\n&gt;beating on me and they cannot pull it off.  I try not to fight back when<br/>\n&gt;this happens to give them a chance to get it off me though.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I did manage to purchase a couple of 2 wisdom rings today for a total of<br/>\n&gt;2pp.  These are the first stat enhancing items I have gotten.  As usual I <br/>\n&gt;am<br/>\n&gt;almost completely broke now after buying my ninth level spells and the<br/>\n&gt;rings.   I am still wearing a mixture of leather, PW and cloth armor and<br/>\n&gt;using a cracked staff in combat.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I am open to any and all suggestions that you elders my wish to impart upon<br/>\n&gt;me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thank you,<br/>\n&gt;Yilari<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Topaaz / LadyJay - *Power Corrupts and absolute Power corrupts absolutly* <br/>\n*hugs*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
