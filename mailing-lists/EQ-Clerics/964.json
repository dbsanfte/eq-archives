I was coming back from South Karana to Qeynos and agreed to bind 2 people on the docks, and just as I was about to do it, Trumpy and a city guard (friend of his) turned up and whacked me upside down from behind. I was *not* impressed, as I intended to bind myself at the bank after binding the adventurers. I had to run back again from South Karana. Argh.<br/>\nI&#39;d only killed him once before and cast root on him another time for a friend to kill him. Both times we bought him drinks till he opened up the conversation.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were murmurs that if you get him absolutely drunk first then you get a good faction hit, which cancels out the bad faction hit from killing him afterwards. I haven&#39;t verified that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From: \tCurtis Bennett[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:die_kluge@...\">die_kluge@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: \tTuesday, 24 August 1999 6:02<br/>\n&gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: \tRe: [EQ-Clerics] Greetings to all<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; At your level, the best 2 choices are the Shining Star of Light<br/>\n&gt; or the Bloodforge hammer.  Of course, you could just continue to use<br/>\n&gt; the hammer of wrath, too.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; To get the shining star of light requires real good Qeynos Priest of<br/>\n&gt; Life faction (and of course for you to journey to Qeynos).  Be sure<br/>\n&gt; to read this quest first (it is a qeynos-based quest).  The SSOL is<br/>\n&gt; a decent 1h weapon that is 6/28, weighs 5 pounds, I think, and casts<br/>\n&gt; &#39;cleanse&#39;, which removes negative effects.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The Bloodforge hammer is also a Qeynos quest (kind of).  This is what<br/>\n&gt; I did, while I was in Qeynos increased my PriestsofLife faction by<br/>\n&gt; doing the blessed oil quest, I found Trumpy Irontoe near the docks<br/>\n&gt; and killed him (green to me at 12th), and got his head. Be warned, as<br/>\n&gt; this will seriously lower your faction with some groups in Qeynos.<br/>\n&gt; The BF hammer is 13/50 2h and adds +10 to saves vs. magic.  It weighs<br/>\n&gt; 10 pounds.  This quest is a Kaladim quest, and you need to be amiable<br/>\n&gt; with the stormguard(I think) in Kaladim - the dwarven fighter guild.<br/>\n&gt; I think killing Crushbone orcs raises that faction, so I didn&#39;t even<br/>\n&gt; have to work on it, it was already amiable when I got there (Kaladim).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have both of these weapons.  I&#39;m trying to increase my 2h skill, but<br/>\n&gt; I switch to the SSOL when the going gets tough!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ergo 13th level high elf cleric on test server<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>EOM <br/>\n<br/>\nNOTICE - This message contains information intended only for the use of the addressee named above.
