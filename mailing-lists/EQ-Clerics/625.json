With the given stats and what it does it would make it almost the <br/>\nmost powerful weapon in the game. 14 damage at 28 speed and cast spells that <br/>\ndo 200 damage. I am almost 40th cleric and asked my other cleric buds all 50 <br/>\nand they have never heard of it and even inqured it to Gm Teur and he said <br/>\nhe has no clue. BUT I HOPE IT DOES, one think id for sure clerics have the <br/>\nweakest weapons in the game. I know bla bla clerics are not fighters bla bla <br/>\nbut how come a wizard does more damage in melee then i do. i use a Sceptor <br/>\nof Flame since that is the best 1 handed blunt i have seen and heard of so <br/>\nfar, and have black Enamaled Mace for back up. Soon they will add new <br/>\nweapons for us when they see we lack in that department so all we can do is <br/>\ncomplain and wait. Well must get back to EQ see if i can get back into hell <br/>\nfor the 3rd time and count the hours it will take me to get out.<br/>\n<br/>\nLater</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
