The group was consisting<br/>\n&gt; of 3 tanks and 2 clerics.  We had some good fighting/pulling and basically<br/>\n&gt; it was a good raid.  I was unsure, and still is, on what my role as the<br/>\n&gt; &quot;other&quot; cleric is.  The more experienced cleric in the group was rather<br/>\n&gt; uncommunicative.  I basically buffed and kept the buffing on all the tanks,<br/>\n&gt; and the clerics.  I cast out SH when I saw health going down drastically and<br/>\n&gt; GH once in awhile. I did cast Naltron on all the tanks though...wasted alot<br/>\n&gt; of money =/  I had like 20 peridot now Im down to 5<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Can anyone tell me if u use atone on any of these raids?  If so, just how do<br/>\n&gt; u go about using it?  I mean do you heal, atone, heal, atone...just so that<br/>\n&gt; the thing won&#39;t frenzy on you?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks again for all the helpful tips and advice =)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Get great offers on top-notch products that match your interests!<br/>\n&gt; Sign up for eLerts at:<br/>\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/elerts1\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/elerts1</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
