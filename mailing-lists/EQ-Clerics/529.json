But the RP games that started in 1986 wre<br/>\nnothing but words actually they were like that for a long time those kind of<br/>\nRPing games  never attracted  the kind of assholes that a game with pics and<br/>\nactuall visual movement thru a world would. Im tellign you as long as there<br/>\nare RPing games   like EQ theres going to be ppl who just wont RP.
