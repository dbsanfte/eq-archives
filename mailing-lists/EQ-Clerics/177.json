Hags *spells* are the thing that will kill you.  Seeing as they<br/>\nstop to cast on you very frequently during chase you can put enough<br/>\ndistance between you and them while divine is on before you get to the<br/>\nzone.  So by the time ya make it to the zone they are out of range for<br/>\nspells and divine has saved you again.  All you need is about 10 secs to<br/>\nmake it away from a hag.  They will just stand there are try to cast on<br/>\nyou.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
