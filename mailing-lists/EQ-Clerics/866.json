I&#39;m currently a level 15 cleric, and<br/>\nhave been challenged by a level 14 troll shaman (yipes). Any hints,<br/>\ntips, or fighting strategies would be most helpful. I am skilled in both<br/>\none handed and two handed blunt, and have a runed totem staff, a fine<br/>\nsteel morning star, and a Qeynos shield (ac 10). My dark elf cleric also<br/>\nhas 90 str, 73 sta, 99 agi, 88 dex, and 98 wis. If I can get to level 19<br/>\nbefore sunday night (gonna have to camp Jonah Brucker all weekend with<br/>\nmy necro friend!), I can buy Extinguish fatigue, endure magic, daring,<br/>\nholy might (not sure what the stats are on it, but it sounds promising),<br/>\nextinguish fatigue, and spirit armor.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is my second character, and I made sure (this time!) to get skill<br/>\nin Divinate...so I can possibly blind the shaman at the start. I could<br/>\ntry fearing him, too, but don&#39;t know if that will work in the small pvp<br/>\narea in neriak. Hmm. I also have cancel magic, but you know how those<br/>\nshamans can cast and cast and cast....and i&#39;d hate to waste my mana. If<br/>\ni buff with all the endure spells before hand, will I be all right<br/>\nagainst his debuffing spells? I will also be wearing Crush&#39;s tunic,<br/>\nwhich gives +8 resistance to heat, poison, magic, and cold. And I will<br/>\nhave some bronze, too, so my ac shouldn&#39;t be too low. However, i know<br/>\nthat the shaman will be in full banded. And he will be wielding a<br/>\nbloodforge hammer, which he says hits for 25-26 consistently. With my<br/>\nruned totem staff, i hit for 19. With the morning star, i hit for 16.<br/>\nHowever, with his buffs, he will be extremely difficult to hit! And my<br/>\nstamina will not last long at all, especially after he hits me with his<br/>\nlevel 14 spell that sucks str, sta, and ac. Sighhhh....What&#39;s a poor<br/>\ncleric to do?<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease help!<br/>\n<br/>\nSaidinn Ba&#39;alRafar<br/>\nKarana Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
