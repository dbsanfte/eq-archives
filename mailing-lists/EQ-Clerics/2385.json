I have been hanging out in the East<br/>\nKarana&#39;s and North Karana&#39;s lately.  I used to hunt Befallen, but find that<br/>\nI am probably too strong for the 2nd level and too weak for the 3rd.  West<br/>\ncommons doesn&#39;t have much, and Beholder is now a limbo zone (lots of low<br/>\nblues, and hi reds).<br/>\n<br/>\nI am interested in xp, but am concerned I am not making enough money, so<br/>\nsome good xp/loot combo areas would be good.  I must admit, i haven&#39;t<br/>\nexplored much beyond the West commons or the Karanas.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrytewing, 16th level, the rathe.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
