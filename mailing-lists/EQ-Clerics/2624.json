(I Naltron everyone for dragons, but that is just me)<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding Reso and AOF:<br/>\nIn extreme combat situation I will Shield of Words all the tanks<br/>\n(+AC/+defense) and AOF the casters.  If a 49+ druid is around and they don&#39;t<br/>\nmind, they can cast Skin Like Nature (SLN) on tanks (does not stack with<br/>\nreso and reso and SLN will not over-write each other)  You will still need<br/>\nto cast your AC buff (SoW or AOF).  Druids can also help to cast the Endure<br/>\ncold/fire buffs.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding Complete Heal:<br/>\nI don&#39;t use in dragon situations.  Occasionally I use on the planes, dungeon<br/>\nhunts and fire giant type runs, but ONLY on tanks with HP&#39;s over 2500 or so.<br/>\nMana cost for C-Heal is 400 (versus 250 for Superior heal) and can save you<br/>\na bit of mana on high health point tank types.  If you do use it, it is best<br/>\nif you start to cast when HP&#39;s drop to 2 bubbles.  You will get a feel for<br/>\nwhen you will have time to do this and when a superior heal is needed for<br/>\nthe lower casting time.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Sirensa<br/>\nSolusek Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
