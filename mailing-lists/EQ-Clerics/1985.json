I am<br/>\nlevel 50 cleric and have found CH (complete heal) to be the most mana<br/>\nefficient and useful heal spell I have when it comes to healing my level 50<br/>\ntanks, such as my husband Donzi, who is a level 50 warrior with almost 3400<br/>\nhps fully buffed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe whole key to CH is understanding the length of casting time and timing<br/>\nwhen to cast it.  When Donzi, or one of my other high level tanks with tons<br/>\nof hps, is taking the primary beating for the group, I begin to cast it when<br/>\nthey are down to about 2 and a half bubbs of health.  It generally goes off<br/>\nwhen they hit about one or one and a half bubbs of health, so I restore<br/>\nclose to 2700 hps or more of health for only 250 more mana pts than it cost<br/>\nme to restore only 600 hps with superior heal.  And yes, I do this in combat<br/>\nas well as afterwards.  Once again, the whole key to CH is your timing.<br/>\n<br/>\nObviously you aren&#39;t going to use CH on casters or other group members who<br/>\ndon&#39;t have such high amts of hps.  I use superior heal for them.  But for<br/>\nsaving mana and getting your big tanks with over 3000 hps back to full<br/>\nhealth, nothing beats CH IMHO.<br/>\n<br/>\nMikaela Valorblade<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Cliff, Monty &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mcliff@...\">mcliff@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, September 21, 1999 5:00 AM<br/>\nSubject: [EQ-Clerics] Complete Heal<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Cliff, Monty&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mcliff@...\">mcliff@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;      Does anyone else think Complete Heal is an almost useless spell in<br/>\n&gt;      combat situations?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;      This spell has one of the longest delays for a cleric so it is very<br/>\n&gt;      dangerous to use in combat situations.  I think the only cleric spell<br/>\n&gt;      that takes longer to cast is shield of words.  The only time I found<br/>\n&gt;      this spell usefull was when I was grouped with a L50 warrior since he<br/>\n&gt;      had so many hp superior heal was only healing one bub of his health.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;      Last night I was in LGuk and our group was camping the froglik King.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;      Now this guy hits hard and fast (140 double attacks) and I was<br/>\ncasting<br/>\n&gt;      superior heals one after another just to keep our tank (L50 sk)<br/>\nalive.<br/>\n&gt;       There is no way I could have gotten off a complete heal during these<br/>\n&gt;      fights.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;      It also doesn&#39;t make much sence to me that it takes longer to<br/>\n&gt;      completely heal someone than it does to ressurect them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;      I think all of our healing spells need reduced casting times,  It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;      very frustrating when your tank looses their last 2 bubs of health<br/>\n&gt;      when your trying to get a heal off just to see thoes blue sparkles<br/>\n&gt;      around their corpse.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;      Just something to think about.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;      Drogo DarkBane<br/>\n&gt;      The Rathe<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
