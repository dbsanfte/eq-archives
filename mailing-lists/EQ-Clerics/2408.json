","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1869897588\">Count me in on the sit in!  Although some of the<br/>\ncleric items seem decent enough, the simple fact that<br/>\nwe are expected to watch for ground spawns disgust me!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first time I waited for a ground spawn, I was in<br/>\nKithicor (this was before all the undead was<br/>\nintroduced there).  I had been sitting all by my<br/>\nlonely for 3 hours (at least) and nothing happened. <br/>\nUnfortunately, I had to run afk.  By the time I got<br/>\nback there was a /tell from someone saying that they<br/>\npicked up the item while passing through.  BAH.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLast night we were hunting undead in Kithicor.  It was<br/>\nmorning in the game and I decided to check that spot<br/>\nsince our &quot;puller&quot; said it looked like a bag was<br/>\nsitting on the ground.  Well, I got excited and ran<br/>\nover there.  Heh, not a good idea, i tell ya... Even<br/>\ntho most of the mobs in kith con blue to me, they are<br/>\nhorrible to even attempt to solo.  Needless to say I<br/>\ngot splattered to the ground and lost my level. <br/>\nHappened the second time too!  (no laughing at me<br/>\nTopaaz, your day will come as mine did!)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have also died in MistMoore while waiting for the<br/>\nground spawn in there and I cant even attempt to find<br/>\nthe named gobbo in the Cauldron without a druid with<br/>\nme.  To this day I haven&#39;t any of my ingots or icons. <br/>\nI dont feel like dedicating weeks of time just for<br/>\nground staring.  Although I would love the added AC, I<br/>\nfeel that my wisdom enhancing clothing will have to do<br/>\nfor now.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdira SoulSaver<br/>\nBandaid of Tunare (blessed 37 times)<br/>\nRodcet NIfe<br/>\n--- Anne O &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:topaaz1@...\">topaaz1@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; here here, well said Jeff, i agree i want more<br/>\n&gt; wisdom.  i refuse to do the <br/>\n&gt; quests, as far as im concerned AAC is useless to me<br/>\n&gt; in comparison to the <br/>\n&gt; wisdom i need, legs with intel=rediculas!!! plain<br/>\n&gt; and simple.....<br/>\n&gt; topaaz<br/>\n&gt; xegony<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Jeff Portwine&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jdport@...\">jdport@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Subject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] Cleric Sit-in<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Date: Tue, 30 Nov 1999 09:34:17 -0500<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&lt;&lt; text2.html &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&lt;&lt; text3.html &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;HR&gt;<br/>\n&lt;html&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>=====<br/>\nGet paid for reading E-Mail!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sendmoreinfo.com/id/63758\">http://www.sendmoreinfo.com/id/63758</a><br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nThousands of Stores.
