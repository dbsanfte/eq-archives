I am 18th level, and while I can afford all of my 19th<br/>\nlevel spells, if I can get a lot of them for free, it will certainly<br/>\nbe worth it.  Can anyone give me approximate directions on how to get<br/>\nto the Paladin in the cell?<br/>\n  I&#39;m thinking I can bind myself at the Bridge, and deliver the thing<br/>\nto the Pally, gate back, use the WK shortcut to get back to Qeynos<br/>\nget another one, and then gate back, and avoid crossing WK altogether,<br/>\nand do this several times.  It should be an amazing time saver, and I<br/>\ncan get a lot of the spells I need.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
