I mean I like to<br/>\nearn my Lvls not have them handed to me.  I either solo stuff I can kill<br/>\nthats blue or black to me or I get in a group, which lately I&#39;ve been<br/>\ngrouping, daytime I&#39;m soloing then around 6pm or 7 I&#39;m in a group till about<br/>\n12a to 1 or later.  I can understand having a friend help you out with money<br/>\nand a better weapon or armor but thats about as far as I&#39;d go.  I wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nwant to be Lvl 4 with a full suit of Ruby, maybe banded and thats it.  I&#39;m<br/>\nnow Lvl 18 and I wear Banded, Chain and Mesh armor, some of it I bought and<br/>\nother parts friends gave to me to help me out.<br/>\n<br/>\n**************************<br/>\nAzor<br/>\nLvl 18 Human Cleric of the Rathe<br/>\n**************************<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Mr. J Daniels&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warpig@...\">warpig@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Its not impossible,  I&#39;ll see about getting the screnshot, the guy is<br/>\n&gt; level 33 now tho and hasnt played as much, he may be up to around 15 days.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; (It can be done)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Mr. J Daniels<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nONElist members are using Shared Files in great ways!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nAre you?
