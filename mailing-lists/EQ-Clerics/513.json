I have played RPGs since the age of 8 (I am 26 <br/>\nnow), and I have played many multi-player RPGs (when they were first invented <br/>\naround 1986 or so)  where roleplaying was great, and one of them was very <br/>\nrecent- a year ago to be exact. Of course there were questions where someone <br/>\nwill ask what level you are or the monsters hit points, but there was also a <br/>\ngreat deal of roleplaying, so it didnt matter -  I have even  been OOC on <br/>\n*more* then one occasionof times myself. But people were there because it was <br/>\na different world to escape to. Norrath to me is an empty world.<br/>\n  I have never been in a game where so many people ripped me off so they can <br/>\nget more money to buy that next cool item.  I can understand if your <br/>\ncharacter is a thief or some other mischievous being that follows a deity of <br/>\nthat sort- but  how many times has this happened to you - <br/>\n  1)  A  paladin left you for death while you were fighting off monsters- and <br/>\nhe/she ran without thought of honor or disgrace - as what he would say to <br/>\nexplain the situation - &quot; I didnt want to  lose &quot; a half bar of experience&#39;&#39; <br/>\n  2) A  holy cleric  said to you &quot;It&#39;s a nosave lightstone&quot; in Kerra isle <br/>\n(Before nosave lightstones were implemented in Kerra isle)<br/>\n 3) A person following a deity of &#39;goodness&#39; loot every corpse in sight even <br/>\nthough it wasnt his/her turn. <br/>\n 4) A person diband your group to join another group for more &quot; experience&#39;&quot; <br/>\nrather then enjoying the moment of adventurers  for the cause of good <br/>\nadventure.<br/>\n 5)  A ranger or druid killing a bear, lion, elephant, etc - for &quot;exp or to <br/>\nincrease my &#39;tailoring skill&#39; &quot; <br/>\n Etc, etc..the list goes on. I expected these things to happen, but I have <br/>\nnever met a single perons in EQ that actually tried  to adhere to their <br/>\ncharacter.  The world of EQ is full of greed and who can be the next &#39; <br/>\ncoolest high level character&#39;. <br/>\n<br/>\n T Alexander</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
