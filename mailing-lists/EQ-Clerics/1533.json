Even if games run on a LAN and not over<br/>\nthe internet, odds are they should support IP as well, either because it&#39;s<br/>\nnot much extra code (if they&#39;re using Winsock) or because they roll their<br/>\nown BSD sockets code, equally fairly easy.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn modern games with decent latency handling, a 50ms ping can easily be<br/>\nhandled. 5ms is nice, but 50ms isn&#39;t going to break the bank.<br/>\n<br/>\nI found that getting rid of IPX was a small price to pay for stopping my<br/>\ncomputer hitting 1/5 FPS for 30 seconds every 10 minutes or so.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
