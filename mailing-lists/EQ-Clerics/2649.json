If you<br/>\n </span></blockquote>would<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;like to know all the details, read on.

If you<br/>\n&gt;&gt;hail him and say &quot;What of Sacrament&quot;, he says that the Ingot and Icon are<br/>\n&gt;&gt;merely legend! He also says that if you could bring him both Ingot, Icon<br/>\n&gt;&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;&gt;2 magnetized platinum bars, that he could forge something very special:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Ingot of the Sacrament:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Go to the Rathe Mountains and find the Undead Ruins. To get there, as you<br/>\n&gt;&gt;zone in from the Feerrott, take a left at the first 4-way intersection you<br/>\n&gt;&gt;come to. Keep the mountain wall on your left and you will eventually come<br/>\n&gt;&gt;upon a gold tower with undead, this is NOT the spawn. Keep going until you<br/>\n&gt;&gt;see what looks like a druid teleport spot (ruins) with undead; this is it.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Here spawn the giant undead skeletons. You are looking for the rare spawn<br/>\n&gt;&gt;that looks like a giant dread bone skel (dark brownish-red in color). He<br/>\n </span></blockquote>is<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;a low 30th lvl mob and will be quite tough to solo. I, a 34th Cleric, and<br/>\n </span></blockquote>a<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;27th Rogue took him easily. We even had another normal giant skel wacking<br/>\n&gt;&gt;on<br/>\n&gt;&gt;us, so a group of 3 or so at 30 should do. Also, these guys drop &quot;A<br/>\n&gt;&gt;skeletal<br/>\n&gt;&gt;finger&quot;, which is a Necro quest for Shadowbound armor. You could use this<br/>\n&gt;&gt;to<br/>\n&gt;&gt;attract the company of a necromancer to aid you in destroying the spawn.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Icon of the Sacrament:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;To get the Icon you must travel to Mistmoore. At the back of the Graveyard<br/>\n&gt;&gt;there is a secret wall (back left, facing the graveyard). Pass through and<br/>\n&gt;&gt;you will be in a small, square room. There is yet another secret wall<br/>\n&gt;&gt;immediately to your right as you enter. Go through and you will find<br/>\n&gt;&gt;yourself in a room with 4 doors. The only door that can be opened is the<br/>\n&gt;&gt;one<br/>\n&gt;&gt;you are facing as you enter. But be warned, opening the door causes the<br/>\n&gt;&gt;other 3 to open. And unless there is a party camping there, there will be<br/>\n </span></blockquote>a<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;nasty creature behind each. There is only 1 wall with 2 doors.

Also, this is a 6-hour spawn. I like to call this one my<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&quot;12pp solution&quot;. Why? Because that&#39;s how much a potion of invisibility<br/>\n&gt;&gt;costs<br/>\n&gt;&gt;=) I traveled to Mistmoore and asked if there was a party in the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>graveyard,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;and there was. I asked if they had been killing the things in the secret<br/>\n&gt;&gt;room, they had been. I asked if they had picked up the doll behind the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>door<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;and they told me they had done so about 2 hours before. So....I just<br/>\n </span></blockquote>logged<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;&gt;and came back 4 hours later, which happened to be around 6:00AM. This<br/>\n&gt;&gt;worked<br/>\n&gt;&gt;out great because nobody was in-zone at that time. Drank my invisibility<br/>\n&gt;&gt;potion, strolled in, opened the door, picked it up and got the heck out.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Magnetized Platinum Bars:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Purchase 2 regular Platinum Bars from a Jewelry shop or from an Enchanter<br/>\n&gt;&gt;(hint: create an Enchanter and dump all points into CHA and check the<br/>\n&gt;&gt;prices). Take these to Ostorm in the Temple of Solusek Ro (he will be<br/>\n&gt;&gt;upstairs through several doors on the right side of the Temple). Give<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Ostorm<br/>\n&gt;&gt;1 bar at a time and he will return it to your inventory as a Magnetized<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Platinum Bar.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Give Gavel the Ingot, Icon and both Magnetized bars (I separated the bars)<br/>\n&gt;&gt;and he will give you your reward:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Caduceus of the Sacrament<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Magic Lore No Drop<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Weight: 8.0<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Type: 1HB Dmg: 12 Del: 32<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Cleric only<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;I constantly hit for 28&#39;s with this thing (89 STR). When I cast Frenzied<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Strength and Yaulp II, I get some in the low 30&#39;s.
