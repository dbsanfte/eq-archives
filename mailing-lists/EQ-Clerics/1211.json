Its a game, a fashion if you like, it will flourish for<br/>\nwhile. It may be 6 months, it may be years. Other games will come and go,<br/>\nthey will have success and failures too. Some people will move on straight<br/>\naway, others will wait till they close the servers down and ball their eyes<br/>\nout. WHO CARES.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnjoy the game, enjoy your character, enjoy this sense of community. Enjoy<br/>\nit now. You might be dead in real life in 6 months. So stop worrying, stop<br/>\nwhining...just hang out here with us Clerics. Discuss evening wear, PvP<br/>\nplay, begging if you like... but most of all enjoy life and EQ.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: John Erik Maynus [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jmaynus@...\">jmaynus@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, September 09, 1999 10:11 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [EQ-Clerics] EQ Slowly Dying?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;John Erik Maynus&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jmaynus@...\">jmaynus@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been reading on the EQ newsgroup that a good bit of ppl think EQ is<br/>\nalready starting to die.  Many are just bored of the game and are quiting or<br/>\ngetting ready to, others are getting tired of Verant changing everything and<br/>\nsome of it is for the worse.  I&#39;ve read where they are saying it&#39;s too late<br/>\nto save EQ, some even say even the new addon will not save it cause it&#39;ll<br/>\nstill be the same game with just some new things.  And yeah it might spice<br/>\nit up a bit, but for how long, I give it 3-4 months tops.  After 3-4 months<br/>\nthe power gamers will already have the extra lvls, everyone should have been<br/>\nin all the new zones, had a chance to play the new lizardman race.  So once<br/>\nthat happens it&#39;s gonna be right back to where it is now.<br/>\nSome are waiting for Asheron&#39;s Call and others are waiting for Middle-Earth<br/>\nto be released.  Will AC or ME finish off EQ?  I guess time will tell but<br/>\nsince theres like 3-4 other RPGs coming out by the year 2000 I say one of<br/>\nthem will put an end to EQ.  And if EQ does die to fast it&#39;s no ones fault<br/>\nbut Verants for not listening to the paying customers, they listen to a few<br/>\nbut not the whole.<br/>\nEven tho EQ is a very good game it can&#39;t or won&#39;t be around forever.<br/>\n<br/>\n**************************<br/>\nAzor<br/>\nLvl 18 Human Cleric of the Rathe<br/>\n**************************<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nONElist:  your connection to online communities.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nONElist:  your connection to people who share your interests.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
