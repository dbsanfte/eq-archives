He said that is ia a cleric and paladin<br/>\nonly weapon and he said it is obtained through a quest of some sort.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have no info othewr than this, this person claims he has seen one and only<br/>\none of them and that is why he was asking me if i knew the quest( apparently<br/>\nhe wants to get one)<br/>\n<br/>\nI would like to find out about this, i don&#39;t even know if it really exists<br/>\nand if it does what the stats of this weapon are.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps we can all keep an ear out about this item. Any info would be<br/>\nappreciated<br/>\n<br/>\nBree Wyndsdale<br/>\n35th Cleric of Fennin Ro<br/>\n(hell level)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
