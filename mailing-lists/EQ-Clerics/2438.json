I told him I was<br/>\nrather young to wandering LFay yet and he said he would protect me okay so I<br/>\nagreed.  He was a named Druid and we took off with me invisible and SOW&#39;d.<br/>\nI found his corpse for him and he asked me whether I wanted cash or equip.<br/>\nWell this bardling has been very lucky in that they were given full bronze<br/>\narmor and 5 instruments plus about 30 plat by someone leaving the game when<br/>\nthey were level 2.   The armor is still in the bank and the bard wears PW<br/>\nand cloth because that is the way I am.  I did buy a mino axe though.   Well<br/>\nanyway, I told the druid that if he would just get me back to GFay that<br/>\nwould be enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the entrance he again asked me if I would not accept a tip.   I told him<br/>\nthat yes I would accept a small one expecting a pp or two maybe.  Well he<br/>\ntipped me 50pp.   Needless to say I was stunned but accepted.   50pp to a<br/>\n5th level is a fortune for sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat a crazy world for sure we all adventure in.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, Yilari was given two +2 earrings today so she is in hog-heaven<br/>\nalso.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks to all who gave advice on 14th level spells.  She really appreciated<br/>\nit a lot.  And thanks again for your advice in the past.  It has helped to<br/>\nmake her a good cleric I feel.  Today she had to leave her group at Derv<br/>\ncamp 2 in N. Ro.   As she was about to zone out she heard shout asking for a<br/>\ncleric to join their group.   The party already had a shaman who was also<br/>\n14.  She took this as a high complement to how she had helped the party that<br/>\nday and what her loss meant to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood hunting all,<br/>\nYilari, 14th Cleric of Tunare<br/>\nBlades of Honor<br/>\nErollisi Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
