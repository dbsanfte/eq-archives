What<br/>\n&gt;&gt; are your names? I need to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; decide what kind of character to make.  That is a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; good combo, BTW...a bard,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; cleric and monk.  Gotta figure out what class/race<br/>\n&gt;&gt; combo that is good can<br/>\n&gt;&gt; start in Freeport, since I know I&#39;d never get a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; teleport or bind if I was<br/>\n&gt;&gt; born in like Erudin or Kelethin.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Freeport is actually the EASIEST city you can get a bind<br/>\nin on Test. However, it also helps that everyone is really<br/>\nfriendly. I&#39;ve had people go out of their way to bind me, knowing<br/>\nthere isn&#39;t anyone else you can turn to to bind you. I asked a cleric<br/>\nif he could bind me in Greater Faydark the other day. (We got off the boat<br/>\nin together in Butcherblock and he was going to Mistmoore) And he said to<br/>\nmeet<br/>\nhim at the zone to lesser Faydark. If I could not find a bind by the time I<br/>\ngot<br/>\nthere, he&#39;d do it (I was going to help him with bard-feet. But he wanted to<br/>\ngo in<br/>\nKaladim for a while first) And he did!<br/>\n<br/>\nTeleports may be more difficult. I dunno since I rarely got one on a<br/>\nproduction server. (Never asked for one. Was occasionally volunteered<br/>\none. For a Guild outing, or whatnot)<br/>\n<br/>\nGetting a bind in Erudin on a production server, though, is similarly<br/>\nimpossible.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I DID eventually get a bind in Qeynos the one time I needed to.<br/>\nSo its not impossible. Just takes a bit of luck.<br/>\n<br/>\nBinds are not as impossible on Test server that people make them out<br/>\nto be (I&#39;ve got friends that are level 13 and haven&#39;t even looked for<br/>\na new bind in other than their starting point, because they assume it<br/>\nis impossible. I started in Kelethin with my bard. I went to Freeport, then<br/>\nto Rivervale, then to Fawdyer. Then back to Rivervale. Then to Qeynos.<br/>\nThen back to Rivervale. Then back to Greater Faydark. Then to Freeport.<br/>\nAnd I am currently bound in Rivervale as a level 12 bard.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been in nearly every outside zone on the server. And several inside,<br/>\nfighting. It would be easier to list the outside zones I have not been to.<br/>\nInnothule Swamp, Feerot, Rathe Mountains, Lake Ratheteer, Toxullia Forest,<br/>\nDagnor&#39;s Cauldron.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo traveling just is not that big a problem. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nFaesong, level 12 Songweaver of Solusek Ro, Test Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
