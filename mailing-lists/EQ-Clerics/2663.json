Wow, I mean they really give Everquest a great name!  I<br/>\n&gt;get to sit in Befallen for hours, and hours killing waiting for a lucky <br/>\n&gt;roll<br/>\n&gt;of the dice.  After I&#39;m done, I get to go over to Dagnors Cauldron, and<br/>\n&gt;compete with every druid on the server for Bilge, this is a great set of<br/>\n&gt;quests!  I can&#39;t believe with all the changes, that once again the cleric<br/>\n&gt;was over looked.  For christs sake the druid got his tracking raised!  Oh<br/>\n&gt;sorry, those poor druids help em out some more, they aren&#39;t getting enough!<br/>\n&gt;&lt;end rant&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Justin<br/>\n&gt;   -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;   From: Jeff Portwine [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jdport@...\">jdport@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;   Sent: Thursday, January 20, 2000 10:47 AM<br/>\n&gt;   To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq-clerics@onelist.com\">eq-clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;   Subject: [EQ-Clerics] Fw: Argh!

I&#39;ve been hearing rumors for a couple of weeks from<br/>\n&gt;many different sources that this new patch was going to improve the<br/>\n&gt;situations clerics have with the HORRIBLE camps the have to do to get their<br/>\n&gt;armor.   Well, this patch seems to have enhancements for just about <br/>\n&gt;everyone<br/>\n&gt;except clerics.  Not one single thing in it to effect clerics.  Even the<br/>\n&gt;armor of Ro, they say they are chaning it to increase the drops.  That is<br/>\n&gt;just BS.  I will be the first to admit that the paladin armor quests are<br/>\n&gt;hard.  They are very very hard.  But they aren&#39;t hard becasue of the rarity<br/>\n&gt;of drops!!!!  Most of their stuff drops relatively often... though it is<br/>\n&gt;hard to get (i.e. the caudrons in mistmoore).    How many days now have I<br/>\n&gt;been camping that freaking Aviak in the OOT???  Just about every cleric <br/>\n&gt;i&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt;talked to who is trying to get that, has been camping it for like 2 months<br/>\n&gt;and not gotten it.  Those who have gotten it say it took them about 2<br/>\n&gt;months.  What&#39;s worse is that I still have 3 or 4 camps to do that are as<br/>\n&gt;bad or worse.  This is absolutely absurd.  People like me with jobs and<br/>\n&gt;lives outside of EQ cannot possibly do these quests and it just pisses me<br/>\n&gt;off to no end.    I had thought that there was going to be some relief with<br/>\n&gt;his patch... maybe there will be and it just wasn&#39;t documented... but <br/>\n&gt;seeing<br/>\n&gt;as how they documented enhancements for just about every single other <br/>\n&gt;person<br/>\n&gt;in norrath  I really doubt it.   I guess all the feedbacks from every <br/>\n&gt;cleric<br/>\n&gt;in Norrath just doesn&#39;t matter to Verant.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   [rant done]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Heh.. well i won&#39;t stop trying for the armor.. i&#39;m determined to get it<br/>\n&gt;which makes me wonder about my own sanity since i probably won&#39;t even wear<br/>\n&gt;it in most situations.  I just want it for pride.. and it will make<br/>\n&gt;something very nice to wear to events like weddings and stuff.    Though<br/>\n&gt;it&#39;ll be months and months before i have it anyway...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   -Eachann<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Please click above to support our sponsor<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
