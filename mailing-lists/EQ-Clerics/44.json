Why does everyone have low 2h blunt !? I know that<br/>\nwith e cleric the maximum 2h blunt goes up only 4 per level not 5 like most<br/>\nabilities. But at level 19 I have maxed 2h blunt at about 75 i believe. Clerics<br/>\nare the BEST soloers but they can do it easily if u know how to play. Either you<br/>\ncan get very strong armour and melee the enemies. Or root em and blast em away.<br/>\nI just thought that at level 20 u should have a pretty high 2h blunt .<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAllsar wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Allsar&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bogey@...\">bogey@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Right now i&#39;ve a recently level 20 dark elf cleric.

I played an Elven<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Cleric up to level 11.  I stopped because I was having problems raising my<br/>\n&gt; &gt;two-handed blunt up from 0.  I started a Dwarven Cleric and have seen the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;difference.  I can solo pretty good and I can definitely back a fighter if<br/>\n&gt; &gt;needed.  The problem with my first character was that I didn&#39;t have the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;strength to do the damage and carry the gear that my Dwarf can.  So I guess<br/>\n&gt; &gt;you kind of have to make the choice to be a back up fighter in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;beginning.  Interesting points though.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;David<br/>\n&gt; &gt;a.k.a Doro on FenninRo<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: Alvarez, Ruben (consultant) [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ruben.alvarez@...\">ruben.alvarez@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Sent: Tuesday, June 01, 1999 2:01 PM<br/>\n&gt; &gt;To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Subject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] Why do YOU want to be a cleric?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Alvarez, Ruben (consultant)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ruben.alvarez@...\">ruben.alvarez@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I dont think clerics can hold their own at all.  (besides undead) IMHO I am<br/>\n&gt; &gt;a level 13 High Elf cleric. Our offensive spells dont do that much damage<br/>\n&gt; at<br/>\n&gt; &gt;all.  I have read about the higher level offensive spells, and they dont<br/>\n&gt; &gt;really impress me.  I love being a cleric saving lives and getting the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;thanks from everyone.  Pretty much we cant solo.  (which I dont mind at<br/>\n&gt; all)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I want to be in a group.  When I play I must get a couple /tells an hour<br/>\n&gt; &gt;asking me if I am in a group.  Or some high level asking me to heal 500+<br/>\n&gt; &gt;HP&#39;s.  All I really want is appreciation.  Depending on their level I do<br/>\n&gt; &gt;charge a small fee for a cure or a heal.  Usually what I do if they do give<br/>\n&gt; &gt;me something depending how much, I will cure/heal the rest of the period I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;am playing.  I think everyone will agree with me that being a cleric you<br/>\n&gt; are<br/>\n&gt; &gt;going to be poor! Like I said,  I am level 13 and have about 2/5 of banded<br/>\n&gt; &gt;armor.  When I see other classes have full banded and a fine steel weapon.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I was forced to move locations from Oasis which doesn&#39;t give much loot at<br/>\n&gt; my<br/>\n&gt; &gt;level to Black Burrow.  I didn&#39;t mind the move at all.  I plan to stay in<br/>\n&gt; BB<br/>\n&gt; &gt;until I get full banded armor all of my level 14 spells and maybe a fine<br/>\n&gt; &gt;steel hammer.  I have to look up the stats for that.  Then I will probably<br/>\n&gt; &gt;move back to the Oasis.  Well I am rambling right now plus there is work to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;do.

Let&#39;s start with why<br/>\n&gt; &gt;you want to be a cleric.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;With me it was a simple choice.  I like to be able to help people.  There<br/>\n&gt; is<br/>\n&gt; &gt;nothing like coming upon someone locked in a life or death battle and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;swaying the tide to their side.

It is good to know that you helped.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I also like the fighting abilities of the Cleric.
