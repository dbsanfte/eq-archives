Now my faction is good in<br/>\nHighpass/Highkeep since I levelled from 18-29 almost constantly in those<br/>\ntwo zones..   My faction in Qeynos isn&#39;t brilliant..  I&#39;m not attacked<br/>\nbut I can only sell to Tubal Weaver (who I guess has Highpass Faction<br/>\nnot Qeynos)  Everyone else refuses to sell to me.  I guess I need to<br/>\nkill more gnolls (yawn).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway I have just completed the Testament of Vanear quest yesterday and<br/>\nonly need the gold ring for the paw quest.  So it is definately possible<br/>\nfor us to do it.  Though I have been of the habit of trying to up my<br/>\nfactions in all cities I can since I know how much of a pain it would be<br/>\nhaving to go back to Neriak to sell each time.<br/>\n<br/>\nOut of the two cities I would probably work on your faction in<br/>\nHighpass/HighKeep first.. since by doing so you are also upping your<br/>\nfaction with Corrupt Qeynos Guards (and possibly the normal Qeynos<br/>\nguards but I can&#39;t be sure on that)<br/>\n<br/>\nJust kill orcs/gnolls until the guards let you in.. took me a few days<br/>\nto get enough faction to be able to sell there..<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the paw quest you don&#39;t really need good faction at all.. it is all<br/>\ncompletable without having to go into any big city that you would get<br/>\nkilled in.. You have to go under one.. but as long as you manage to<br/>\nsneak into the Qeynos aquaducts via the hidden entrance you don&#39;t need<br/>\nto enter the city..  Also get a teleport to Tox forest when it comes to<br/>\ncamping Mitty it would be worth the cost.. fast and no sneaking through<br/>\nErudin/Qeynos..<br/>\n<br/>\nVinamin<br/>\nSon of Innoruuk<br/>\nPriest of The Lady<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Sirensa Qi&#39;Seraph<br/>\n&gt; Daughter of Inoruuk </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
