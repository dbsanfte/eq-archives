Anyone<br/>\nout there know?  We would pull the first 3, kill them, then do any ressing<br/>\nnecessary and rebuff only to find that they have respawned.  We did this in way<br/>\nless than the 20 minutes the respawn used to be.  I figure we&#39;ll be okay once we<br/>\nget a couple of level 50 enchanters with the groups we had down there, even the<br/>\n48 enchanter that was there was able to mess the Guardians (wasn&#39;t too sure if<br/>\nhe would be able to).  I thought we could do it last night, but when we pulled<br/>\nhim someone just got a little jumpy on the evac call because of poor<br/>\ncommunication.  By the time everyone got back it was already 2am :(<br/>\n<br/>\nWe still need to get a body from down there soon, so any help ya could provide<br/>\nwould be appriciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nAilamil Faithbringer<br/>\nTarew Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
