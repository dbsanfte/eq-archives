You&#39;ll find a pretty damn good use for<br/>\n&gt;cure blindness real quick.  Not to mention any other time one of your<br/>\n&gt;party members gets blinded.  Or..  If you yourself get blinded while<br/>\n&gt;soloing it kinda puts a kink in your gameplan.  Not being able to see<br/>\n&gt;what&#39;s going on can cost you your life.  As with a few other cure<br/>\n&gt;spells, it sometimes has to be cast more than once to be effective. &lt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I have been using Cancel Magic effectively against the blindness that the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Muddites cause. I have one question: Is it significantly faster to cast a<br/>\nCure Blindness than Cancel Magic? I know cancel magic uses 50% more mana but<br/>\nit is so little anyway (20 -&gt; 30) that there is no point in purchasing the<br/>\nspell just for that. Besides the cancel magic works for a wider variety of<br/>\nthings. Very useful when you are rooted, isn&#39;t it? Is there anything that<br/>\ncould cause blindness and that cancel magic could not cure?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Where do some of the Internet&#39;s largest email lists reside?<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;At ONElist - the most scalable and reliable service on the Internet.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
