While I agree that there are a lot of people in the game that ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1626558566\">All,<br/>\n<br/>\nThere has been a large discussion going on about the validity of roleplaying <br/>\nin Everquest.  While I agree that there are a lot of people in the game that <br/>\ndon&#39;t really &#39;roleplay&#39; much, consider this.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe that &#39;roleplaying&#39; has started to gain a definition that is not <br/>\ndue.  When I play Devotion on the Povar server, I am ALWAYS in character.  I <br/>\nsee through his eyes, I want what he wants, I fight what he fights.  That <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean that Devotion is likely to say &quot;Have at thee, knave!&quot;  <br/>\nInterestingly, saying &#39;thee&#39; and &#39;thou&#39; exclusively really doesn&#39;t have <br/>\nanything to do with roleplaying, even in a fantasy setting.  One thing to <br/>\nremember about EQ is that the game DOES NOT OCCUR on Earth, or in any <br/>\nspecific time frame that we have a point of reference for.  There is no <br/>\nreason why a person in the world of Everquest could not say the word &#39;Cool&#39; <br/>\nto mean that he likes something, or &#39;That sucks!&#39; to mean that he doesn&#39;t <br/>\nlike something.  Roleplaying is all about the individual choices the <br/>\ncharacter makes about his ethics and morals.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance:  when I play Devotion, I speak normally.  I don&#39;t say &#39;thee&#39; <br/>\nor &#39;thou&#39;.  Some people do, and when they do, I continue to talk normally to <br/>\nthem.  That is THEIR role, not mine.  Devotion is not the kind of guy who <br/>\nwould try to speak formally all the time, nor is the DEFINITION of roleplay <br/>\nformal speaking.  Now Devotion WOULD go out of his way to root a monster who <br/>\nis chasing a player who is in danger of death.  He also WOULD offer <br/>\nassistance to newbies for a period of 5-10 minutes each time he passes under <br/>\na city gate. (Those from the Freeport area of the Povar server should be <br/>\nused to hearing Devotion yelling &quot;Free healing, buffs, food, and water for <br/>\nnewbies&quot;.  See, it&#39;s ok for me to say newbies, and buffs.  I&#39;m still <br/>\nroleplaying.  The words &#39;newbies&#39; and &#39;buffs&#39; exist in the reality of <br/>\nNorrath.  I still feel that I&#39;m roleplaying.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to the complaint that a paladin leaves someone to die, etc. etc.  <br/>\nHonestly, in a world full of 1000 paladins (being conservative), I think it <br/>\nis expecting too much that each of them be honorable, and follow the exact <br/>\nsame code.  That may make them a bad paladin within the game&#39;s reality, but <br/>\nthat doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that they aren&#39;t roleplaying.  I feel the same <br/>\nway about druids and rangers killing forest animals.  I have met many that <br/>\ndon&#39;t, and many that do.  It doesn&#39;t mean they aren&#39;t roleplaying if they <br/>\nkill a few bears, it just means their faith isn&#39;t as strong as it could be.  <br/>\nThey will pay the price with decreased faction in their guild.  Now if a <br/>\npaladin is being dishonourable in my presence, I may choose to let him know <br/>\nthat as a priest of Rodcet Nife, he is out of line.  If he continues to be <br/>\ndishonorable, so be it.  Rodcet Nife will deal with him when the time comes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess the point I&#39;m trying to make is this.  Everquest is a reality unto <br/>\nitself.  It is not feudal Camelot, nor is it AD&D.  That may make it less <br/>\nfun for people who want it to be one of those two things, but it just isn&#39;t <br/>\ngoing to be that.  It&#39;s a real world where people live and die every day <br/>\nfighting monsters.  It&#39;s a world where quests are available, taverns exist <br/>\nand sell brews, tailors make patchwork armor, and Dorn eats newbies for <br/>\nbreakfast.  Norrath has it&#39;s own lore, it&#39;s own stories to tell, and it&#39;s <br/>\nown language.  That language contains words like OOM, NP, buffs, SBH, and so <br/>\non.  It also contains language that can help another, like &quot;Go to Unrest at <br/>\nabout lvl 16 to get good exp as a cleric&quot;.  There is no difference between <br/>\nasking where a good sword comes from or where to go to get exp and asking a <br/>\nfriend in RL if they know of a company that is hiring.  That person is just <br/>\nasking you where they can go to make progress in the life they have created <br/>\nin Norrath.  Tell them, help them out.  Make friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been lurking on this list for quite a while, and I have seen many <br/>\narguments about roleplaying.  Roleplaying is what you make it.  It&#39;s playing <br/>\nYOUR role, not rules that are enforced for everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s my 2 cents.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Devotion<br/>\nGuildmaster - Clerics of Norrath Povar<br/>\n_____________________________________________________________________<br/>\nNow recruiting!
