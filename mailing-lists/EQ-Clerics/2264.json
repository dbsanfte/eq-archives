Or we  were trying Vox on Bertox... yeah.. try those tactics there too :) soo many ppl around you there the lag gets unbearble.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would agree that those tacicts will work almost all the time in mid 20s-30s since you don&#39;t really need 4 groups ( the #1 reason of lag )  to hunt in a dungeon :)..<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my 2 cents..<br/>\n<br/>\nLevo Nife of Bertox<br/>\nLvL 50 human cleric.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Cliff, Monty <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Wednesday, November 17, 1999 3:20 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] Cleric Tactics Pre/During/Post Battle<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n       That was a very good story and really good tactics for any clerics<br/>\n       around your level.<br/>\n<br/>\n       Everyone keep in mind that tactics vary depending on what level you<br/>\n       are.<br/>\n<br/>\n       If your below L20 it won&#39;t hurt to mele during battle since your mele<br/>\n       skills are still fairly adaquet (just as long as you don&#39;t forget you<br/>\n       are the healer of the group).<br/>\n<br/>\n       Once you get to higher levels mele is effectively useless for a cleric<br/>\n       and is only something you do if you have full mana and no one needs a<br/>\n       heal.  Also taunting mobs on you is the last thing you want to do.<br/>\n       I&#39;ve recently been doing a lot of fear/hate fighting and if you get<br/>\n       one of thoes mobs on you, unless your lucky enough to get a da/db off,<br/>\n       you can be dead in 3 seconds (130+ quad attacks hurt bad even with my<br/>\n       750+ ac and 1200+ hp).<br/>\n<br/>\n       In Hate there is no running to the zone for safety and the strategy<br/>\n       used when a train is pulled is for the cleric to camp out asap (no<br/>\n       being the hero and staying to heal because it won&#39;t make a difference)<br/>\n       and live to be able to log back on in 5 min to rez everyone (it would<br/>\n       get very expensive if everyone had to be gated in after every train,<br/>\n       200+ plat a trip for the reagent).<br/>\n<br/>\n       In Fear it&#39;s a little different.  Assuming you are able to run in to<br/>\n       the designated camp spot without dieing (2 for 3 on initial run in&#39;s)<br/>\n       clerics bind themselves there (can&#39;t bind in hate).  Corpse recovery<br/>\n       is a lot harder in fear due to mobs that teleport and fear you away<br/>\n       from the camp site (this also pulls trains).  We usually have monks<br/>\n       that pull the corpses back to the camp site for the clerics to rez.  I<br/>\n       have to admit it was kinda scay being bound in Fear the first time.<br/>\n       If you are about to die you /q or hit the reset button on your comp<br/>\n       because you don&#39;t want to pop right back up in the middle of the<br/>\n       battle naked.<br/>\n<br/>\n       Sorry, guess I kinda got off topic.
