Naturally, I<br/>\n&gt;can&#39;t say who, but in the interest of preventing a similar fiasco as with<br/>\n&gt;the Monk sit-in, I will confirm that players in Fenin&#39;s Fear Plane were<br/>\n&gt;lagged out due to over-loading network resources on the server which houses<br/>\n&gt;both Fear and West Freeport.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The server didn&#39;t crash, the network resources were overloaded, and so<br/>\n&gt;people lagged out, leaving the Fear Plane with a half-linkdead party, which<br/>\n&gt;died, followed by people reconnecting into Fear as a now very lonely, and<br/>\n&gt;shortly after very dead, person.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Fear plane did not crash itself - that would have made the players safe -<br/>\n&gt;because Fear does not populate for some time after a reboot. Instead, the<br/>\n&gt;overload of players on the server caused the tragic and needless deaths of<br/>\n&gt;people who just wanted to enjoy the game, and made their corpse recovery<br/>\n&gt;even harsher.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Clerics and Necromancers, I urge you - find a better way to protest. You <br/>\n&gt;are<br/>\n&gt;going down a path which will, again, bring needless suffering on those who<br/>\n&gt;are not participating. Non-violent protest is admirable, but if it causes<br/>\n&gt;death, its no longer non-violent, is it?<br/>\n&gt;-----<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I believe a sit-in, now that it is known that it causes problems to other<br/>\n&gt;players, is not a good way to protest. Please invent another form of<br/>\n&gt;peaceful protest, for the sake of others!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;~ Briza X`Ris ~<br/>\n&gt;~ Mistress of Innoruuk ~<br/>\n&gt;~ Fennin RO ~<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&lt;&lt; text3.html &gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
