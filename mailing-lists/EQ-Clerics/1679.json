Everytime I level, I summon it, max my skill, and then<br/>\ndestroy it and go back to 2HB. I got lucky enough for a friend to hook me up<br/>\nwith an Observers Staff and I tend to stick with that in heavy combat (you<br/>\ncan&#39;t turn down +5 Wis, +30 mana and 25 consistent dmg). Hopefully one day<br/>\nI&#39;ll be able to attain an Enamelled Black Mace or Gem-Encrusted Scepter ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nDrizben D&#39;Vorn<br/>\nDefiled High Priest of Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Sianne .&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:maggee1@...\">maggee1@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Just a question....what weapon do you guyz prefer..i have been striving<br/>\n&gt; for <br/>\n&gt; an observer staff..however i see most of my fellow clerics using one<br/>\n&gt; handed <br/>\n&gt; weapons...i am a little confused as to what i want to do....and one more <br/>\n&gt; question...is there any blackened armor that has any +wis?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sianne - Xegony<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
