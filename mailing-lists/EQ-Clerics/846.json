Also i was adding color to the message as i<br/>\n&gt; thought it looked better and was told not to do that as well!!  oh well i<br/>\n&gt; was just wondering why i was told to do so and since then i have seen many<br/>\n&gt; long messages by others.  err ppl i am not slamming anyone i am just<br/>\n </span></blockquote>asking<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; a general question -- thanx for yer time -- anne *hugs*<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Not sure what oyu mean by deleting the thread. If you were told to delete<br/>\neverything in a reply message - this is simply wrong IMO! If you do not<br/>\nquote the message or parts of the message that you are replying to we have<br/>\nno way of knowing who and what you are talking about then. What you don&#39;t<br/>\nwant to do (according to some who can get extremely picky and shallow) is<br/>\nquote the whole thread that has 10 others responses added to yours.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just deleted the garbage that gets added to your post and replied. But I<br/>\nleft what you said here so others could see what I was responding to.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really don&#39;t mind how you do it :)  I read everything and it really isn&#39;t<br/>\nall that bad. Some complain because they pay for this - I say to them,  go<br/>\nto a forum and read where it wont cost you then. Some say they dont have the<br/>\ntime to wade thru all the garbage to get to the reply - then dont! But they<br/>\nsure have the time to carry on a thread of the do&#39;s and don&#39;ts of an e-mail<br/>\nlist and complain every chance they get :)  Don&#39;t sweat the small stuff -<br/>\nyou&#39;ll live longer :)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
