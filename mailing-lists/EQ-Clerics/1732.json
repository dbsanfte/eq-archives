This is<br/>\nconfirmed.  There was a previous message that all the new zones were to be<br/>\nentered from Tox Forrest (I think Brad posted this).  Makes sense to have the<br/>\nTemple of Solusek close to Solusek Eye, doesn&#39;t it?  hehe<br/>\n<br/>\nI hear that there will be a TON of class specific quests generated here (that&#39;s<br/>\nposted on EQLizer now and some of the other news sites).  Hopefull a piece of<br/>\ncleric only equipment is close at hand, then again- maybe not.<br/>\n<br/>\n**Rumor**<br/>\nAlso, the quest that starts in Kith Forrest is rumored to continue here.  In<br/>\nthis quest you can kill a ghoul messanger or trade an Ebony Blade for another<br/>\n(somewhat less effective than the Ebony Blade) Ranger only sword.  It is rumored<br/>\nthat the continuation of this quest (of course it&#39;s ranger only- that&#39;s MY twink<br/>\n- wink-) will give one nice sword and is advanced in this zone.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
