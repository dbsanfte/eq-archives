It wasn&#39;t the being dead<br/>\n&gt; part I couldn&#39;t believe but<br/>\n&gt; what it was he had in his hand.  Now remember his<br/>\n&gt; character is a Ranger, pic<br/>\n&gt; shows him wearing the new Ranger armor but in his<br/>\n&gt; hand was the SoulFire<br/>\n&gt; which is a Pally only weapon.  Can we say cheating? <br/>\n&gt; Now if one of us tried<br/>\n&gt; that crap we&#39;d get banned from the game but he can<br/>\n&gt; wield a Pally only weapon<br/>\n&gt; when he&#39;s a Ranger?<br/>\n&gt; That shows me the ppl like Brad and GM can get away<br/>\n&gt; with anything in the<br/>\n&gt; game.  I also read on the EQ newsgroup that last<br/>\n&gt; Sunday the night of the<br/>\n&gt; events that the GM&#39;s were doing things that they&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; told players not to do<br/>\n&gt; and if they did they&#39;d get banned for it.  Heard<br/>\n&gt; they were camping at zone<br/>\n&gt; points waiting for a player to zone over and kill<br/>\n&gt; them and also camping<br/>\n&gt; binding points and killing someone over and over<br/>\n&gt; everytime he/she died and<br/>\n&gt; came back at their bind point till they got ticked<br/>\n&gt; and pulled the plug on<br/>\n&gt; their modems.  If we would do that junk we&#39;d get<br/>\n&gt; banned for it.<br/>\n&gt; Can&#39;t wait to hear what Brad has to say about him<br/>\n&gt; wielding a SoulFire.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; **************************<br/>\n&gt; Azor Spellbound<br/>\n&gt; Lvl 24 Human Cleric of the Rathe<br/>\n&gt; **************************<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;HR&gt;<br/>\n&lt;html&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>=====<br/>\n=OrBS=Seriphos<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sykopath69@...\">sykopath69@...</a><br/>\n&quot;Everyday, someone&#39;s gotta pay&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
