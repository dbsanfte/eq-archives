They&#39;d be red,<br/>\nbut with a full group, and especially with an enchanter it would be<br/>\nmanagable. I&#39;m not sure if it would work without an enchanter at that level,<br/>\nbecause you&#39;d want to deal with one at a time. I&#39;d also do it down next to<br/>\nthe zone to Sol B. That is from lavastorm entrance, down the windy stairs,<br/>\neither through the hole in the wall or around by the pendulum axe, coming<br/>\nout above the big doors turn right and straight down the hallway, which goes<br/>\ndown a ramp turning right to a small room at the bottom.<br/>\n    There&#39;s no spawn anywhere past the hall at the top of that ramp, and the<br/>\nzone to Sol B is right next to it. If you get more than you can manage zone<br/>\nout. You can try and root one on your way out and if you&#39;re lucky and come<br/>\nback right away you may be able to catch that single one either still rooted<br/>\nor behind the crowd going back. That shouldn&#39;t be the case all the time, but<br/>\nit helps reduce the down time if there is a bad pull.<br/>\n    With an enchanter to mesmerize extras, and a group that will /assist the<br/>\ntank you should be okay. If you don&#39;t have an enchanter you can try and<br/>\nbreak the spawn with your lull/soothe/calm/pacify line. If you have a shaman<br/>\nin the group get him to buff your charisma before using lull. The shaman can<br/>\nalso do some of the enchanter stuff by using malise to reduce magic<br/>\nresistance for your casters, and speeding your tank and slowing the mob.<br/>\nThese things help effectively reduce the mob to your level. Of course the<br/>\nshaman can&#39;t mesmerize though.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
