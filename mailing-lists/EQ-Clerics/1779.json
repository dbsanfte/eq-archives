Picked the silver up in Blackburrow, and now all i need is the Platinum.  Therein lies the problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have heard many differing accounts of where to find Gynok Molter.  So, if you have SEEN him, not heard about him being somewhere, but ACTUALLY SEEN HIM with YOUR character, please let me know where.  Yes, i know Befallen, but where?  First floor in entrance area? Third floor near Elf Skeletons??  Please let me know any visual sightings. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nSmeal Stonehammer<br/>\n22nd Sphere of Life,<br/>\nDeciple of Rodcet Nife,<br/>\nVeeshan Existance<br/>\n<br/>\nplayed by <br/>\n<br/>\nJerry Hawkins<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Jhawkins@...\">Jhawkins@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
