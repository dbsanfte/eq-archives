Then, after<br/>\n&gt; Innorukk cast the<br/>\n&gt; zonewide spell of instant death, the first wave of<br/>\n&gt; undead spawned and<br/>\n&gt; killed those who were returning to their corpses. <br/>\n&gt; For the first 2 real<br/>\n&gt; life days, these undead dropped Tainted weapons. <br/>\n&gt; The tainted were just<br/>\n&gt; as good as teh Enchanted in most cases except they<br/>\n&gt; were no drop and had<br/>\n&gt; -5 sv disease.  Then the GMs announced that the<br/>\n&gt; undead would not spawn<br/>\n&gt; in kithicor, at least for a while.  This was<br/>\n&gt; probably due to the fact<br/>\n&gt; that the weapons were way too nice.  After another<br/>\n&gt; couple days the<br/>\n&gt; undead came back but only dropped Ruined weapons,<br/>\n&gt; and much more rarely.<br/>\n&gt; The Ruined weapons have the same stat bonuses but<br/>\n&gt; much worse attack and<br/>\n&gt; delays.  Im not sure if the undead have been changed<br/>\n&gt; again tho, as i<br/>\n&gt; havent hunted there for a while.<br/>\n&gt; Snos&gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
