I was coming back from South<br/>\nKarana to Qeynos and agreed to bind 2 people on the docks, and just as I was<br/>\nabout to do it, Trumpy and a city guard (friend of his) turned up and<br/>\nwhacked me upside down from behind. I was *not* impressed, as I intended to<br/>\nbind myself at the bank after binding the adventurers. I had to run back<br/>\nagain from South Karana. Argh.<br/>\nI&#39;d only killed him once before and cast root on him another time for a<br/>\nfriend to kill him. Both times we bought him drinks till he opened up the<br/>\nconversation.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were murmurs that if you get him absolutely drunk first then you get a<br/>\ngood faction hit, which cancels out the bad faction hit from killing him<br/>\nafterwards.

Of course, you could just continue to use<br/>\n&gt; the hammer of wrath, too.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; To get the shining star of light requires real good Qeynos Priest of<br/>\n&gt; Life faction (and of course for you to journey to Qeynos).  Be sure<br/>\n&gt; to read this quest first (it is a qeynos-based quest).  The SSOL is<br/>\n&gt; a decent 1h weapon that is 6/28, weighs 5 pounds, I think, and casts<br/>\n&gt; &#39;cleanse&#39;, which removes negative effects.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The Bloodforge hammer is also a Qeynos quest (kind of).  This is what<br/>\n&gt; I did, while I was in Qeynos increased my PriestsofLife faction by<br/>\n&gt; doing the blessed oil quest, I found Trumpy Irontoe near the docks<br/>\n&gt; and killed him (green to me at 12th), and got his head. Be warned, as<br/>\n&gt; this will seriously lower your faction with some groups in Qeynos.<br/>\n&gt; The BF hammer is 13/50 2h and adds +10 to saves vs. magic.  It weighs<br/>\n&gt; 10 pounds.  This quest is a Kaladim quest, and you need to be amiable<br/>\n&gt; with the stormguard(I think) in Kaladim - the dwarven fighter guild.<br/>\n&gt; I think killing Crushbone orcs raises that faction, so I didn&#39;t even<br/>\n&gt; have to work on it, it was already amiable when I got there (Kaladim).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have both of these weapons.  I&#39;m trying to increase my 2h skill, but<br/>\n&gt; I switch to the SSOL when the going gets tough!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ergo 13th level high elf cleric on test server<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>EOM <br/>\n<br/>\nNOTICE - This message contains information intended only for the use of the<br/>\naddressee named above.
