This is my first post to this forum.  I have been reading emails<br/>\non this list for some time now, and I have found much valuable information<br/>\nhere.  My thanks to all for my increased knowledge.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am trying to complete the cleric armor quest for the greaves.  I already<br/>\nhave the ingot, but I need to find the icon.  The quest info I have<br/>\nindicates that I must kill the erudite Maugrim who spawns in Kerra Ridge on<br/>\nthe necro isle.  I have been there and I have not found Maugrim.  Does<br/>\nanyone have more details as to where Maugrim spawns, or how to get it to<br/>\nspawn?  I would greatly appreciate any information you may have.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you!<br/>\n<br/>\nMariola on Povar</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
