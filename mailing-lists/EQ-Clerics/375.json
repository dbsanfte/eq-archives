I did a / which will tell ya who&#39;s in<br/>\nthe zone and it said there were only 55 people in Unrest.  Yes 55 people but<br/>\nstill laggy as crap in there.  I got attacked by a Werebat and some kinda<br/>\nskel maybe a monk can&#39;t remember but I could not see them at all, thats<br/>\nhappened to me in Steamfont with Minos.  It&#39;ll say you are hit by a Mino for<br/>\nwhatever but you can&#39;t see them.  But anyways I take off from the Werebat<br/>\nand Skel just to be killed by a Hag.  But running even with SoW on ya in<br/>\nUnrest can be a pain cause of the lag.  At times it wasn&#39;t bad at all but<br/>\nother times WOW lag slowed ya down a lot.<br/>\nAlso looted a corpse someone left in Unrest to find a Small Bronze Collar.<br/>\nHeard it was worth maybe 10-12pp but sell it to a store and they only wanna<br/>\ngive ya 8gp, yeah right like I&#39;d take 8gp for a Bronze Collar.<br/>\n<br/>\n**************************<br/>\nAzor<br/>\nLvl 16 Human Cleric of the Rathe<br/>\n**************************<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jdean2@...\">jdean2@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I know, I know, Rodcet Nife isn&#39;t as crowded as<br/>\n&gt; many of the other servers, but it can still be<br/>\n&gt; crowded.  I suggest searching for new areas.  I<br/>\n&gt; have found a zone that has never had more than 25<br/>\n&gt; people in it since I have been there.  Exp. is<br/>\n&gt; great and I am making about 60pp a day in loot.<br/>\n&gt; Did I mention that I now have full bronze from<br/>\n&gt; this same zone?  I am not a level 49 player<br/>\n&gt; either.  I made 18 last night and I already have<br/>\n&gt; two bubbles of exp. toward 19.  I have all the lvl<br/>\n&gt; 19 spells bought, an incredible amount of jewelry,<br/>\n&gt; and over 500pp in the bank.  Once again I implore<br/>\n&gt; you to travel and to form 6 member groups.  If you<br/>\n&gt; hear about a great place then every one else has<br/>\n&gt; also.  Find your own area.  There are many that<br/>\n&gt; are hardly ever visited and you&#39;ll have your<br/>\n&gt; cloice on what, when, and where to kill.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Blessed<br/>\n&gt; Level 18 Cleric<br/>\n&gt; Rodcet Nife<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ONElist members are using Shared Files in great ways!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Are you?
