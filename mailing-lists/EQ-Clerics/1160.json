It would be good for the economy, maybe something that people could learn how to sew. : )  I, for one, would LOVE to be able to change my clothes for certain occassions. A good place to have weddings or other events would be wonderful.  I attended a wonderful wedding one night, but at times MOBs would wander through the crowd, and also the wedding was somewhat large, caused alot of lag for the hunters in the area, and caused general disruption - although completely unintentionally.  I vote yes on this!<br/>\n<br/>\nKrystl<br/>\nCleric of Bristlebane</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
