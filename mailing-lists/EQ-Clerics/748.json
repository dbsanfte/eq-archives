That, indeed, is<br/>\nimpossible.  10 Real Days to 30 *is* entirely possible, however.  I reached<br/>\nlevel 21 in 6 days played and I did it with only 60pp given to me and no<br/>\nother help.  I was purposely power-leveling because my regular group needed<br/>\nme to catch them since we are unable to find a cleric that actually knows<br/>\nhow to play a cleric.  They seem to all want to be battle mages!  We even<br/>\ngrouped with two clerics that did not even have ANY heal spells memorized!<br/>\n<br/>\nAstur il&#39;Ayan, Cleric of Brell<br/>\nSolusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Curtis Bennett&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:die_kluge@...\">die_kluge@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Talking about days played, this reminds me of the discussion we had<br/>\n&gt; on here a while back about twinking a character to level 20.  Someone<br/>\n&gt; mentioned that it could be done in 10 game days.  Others believed<br/>\n&gt; that that would be nearly impossible.<br/>\n&gt;   I have a 12th level cleric (just made 12th last night) and I have<br/>\n&gt; been playing for 5 game days.  Now I spend a great deal of time doing<br/>\n&gt; &quot;crap&quot; in terms of experience - raising skills, swimming, raising<br/>\n&gt; sense-heading, fishing, exploring, doing quests, etc.  Basically just<br/>\n&gt; having fun with the game.  I came across a Druid that was around 9th<br/>\n&gt; or 10th when I first grouped with her.  I think at the time I was<br/>\n&gt; probably 10th level.  I added her to my friends list.  When I saw her<br/>\n&gt; again, she was 16th - I removed her from my friends list knowing I<br/>\n&gt; would probably never get to group with her again as she had outleveled<br/>\n&gt; me.  Last time I saw her was week before last and she was 19th.<br/>\n&gt;   So, I guess my point is, if you&#39;re very aggressive and fight a lot<br/>\n&gt; of monsters steadily, you can really level rapidly.  This would<br/>\n&gt; obviously have to be someone that&#39;s a very experienced player cause<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s hard to otherwise know where to go and what to do.  Relative<br/>\n&gt; newcomers, like myself, are more intrigued just by exploring and<br/>\n&gt; doing quests than by just hardcore leveling.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
