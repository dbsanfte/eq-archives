Mine is set to<br/>\nexpire October 1st (I started a six-month account on April 1st), and I<br/>\nhaven&#39;t heard anything from our kind and intelligent friends at Verant.<br/>\nIf I decide not to play EQ any more, or just quit for a while, will my<br/>\ncharacter be deleted/wiped? If so, then I&#39;d better get on the ball and<br/>\nstart giving my stuff away. It seems like a waste, though. Cause I&#39;ll<br/>\nprobably come back in a couple months to play again, and I don&#39;t want to<br/>\nhave to start over. But I also don&#39;t want to keep paying the monthly fee<br/>\nif I&#39;m not gonna be online.<br/>\n<br/>\nSaidinn Witchwood<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Jeff Habermann [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jrhabermann@...\">jrhabermann@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, September 21, 1999 3:04 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] Shining Star of Light<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Jeff Habermann &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jrhabermann@...\">jrhabermann@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for all the help.

Most clerics will toss it once they get a<br/>\n&gt; screaming mace, or a BEM, or gem-encrusted scepter.  Because the quest<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t involves only killing bixies in Rivervale you can do this<br/>\n&gt; quest at an extremely low level.  I did the blessed oil quest over<br/>\n&gt; and over again.  It took me about 15 times or more of doing this.  I<br/>\n&gt; am a high elf, and I think I was apprehensive when I started.  Maybe<br/>\n&gt; dubious, I don&#39;t remember.  You have to get well into amiably to get<br/>\n&gt; the quest.<br/>\n&gt;   Another really good quest that I&#39;m doing now in my spare time is the<br/>\n&gt; diseased wolf quest.  You can kill rabid wolves and rabid grizzlies<br/>\n&gt; in Qeynos hills and give the pelts to Priestess Caulria in the UFO.<br/>\n&gt; I turned in 4 wolf pelts and 1 grizzly pelt, got a plat for the<br/>\n&gt; grizzly pelt, and &#39;endure disease&#39; a 14th level spell (which you can<br/>\n&gt; buy for 4 plat, or sell for 6-7 gold).  I turned in these pelts, and<br/>\n&gt; at 15th level, I got nearly a half a bar of experience.  Not bad<br/>\n&gt; considering 90% of rabid wolves die with one smite spell.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Heather Daley&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:blushn@...\">blushn@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Our guildmaster, who is a paladin, just recently needed to raise his<br/>\n&gt; &gt;faction<br/>\n&gt; &gt;with the priests of Life, in order to obtain his soulfire sword.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Basically what we did to help raise his faction was:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;1) killing putrid skellies in South Karana(at Grimrots Camp)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;2) Turning in diseased animal pelts to the Temple of Life<br/>\n&gt; &gt;3) Doing the Blessed oil Quest til he turned green<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;These will all raise your faction there. Even I, a person who originally<br/>\n&gt; &gt;came from the temple of Life, needed to raise my faction in order to do<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; &gt;quest. But to be quite honest, I did the quest simply cause I had never<br/>\n&gt; &gt;done<br/>\n&gt; &gt;a quest before, I tried the weapon out like once to see what the effect<br/>\nwas<br/>\n&gt; &gt;and it has sat in the bank ever since.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Bree Wyndsdale<br/>\n&gt; &gt;47th Cleric of Fennin Ro<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;From: Jeff Habermann &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jrhabermann@...\">jrhabermann@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;I keep reading that everyone on here loves to use there SSOL.  I would<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;like<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;to get this weapon as well.  I am a human cleric from the Temple of Marr<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;in<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Freeport.  Will i have problems trying to do the quest, or will i be ok?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Just want to make sure, before I make that loooong journy from freeport<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;qeynos.
