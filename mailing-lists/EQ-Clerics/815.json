I&#39;ve made a few hundred plat there and that is just by<br/>\nselling my junk to NPC Merchants.  The only thing that you need to deal<br/>\nwith when you are there is the lag.  My lag in there is usually close<br/>\nto 3000.  If I have to run to the zone, I feel like I&#39;m chugging away. <br/>\nOnce I zone into dagnors, my lag is only around 300 - 400.  I had<br/>\nalways blamed the problem on MY computer, but then I realized the<br/>\ndifference between zones.<br/>\n<br/>\n**waves to Dank** (you are the one on Rodcet, eh?)<br/>\n<br/>\nAdira<br/>\nBandaid of Tunare<br/>\nRodcet Nife<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Harry Katz &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hkatz@...\">hkatz@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: Harry Katz &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hkatz@...\">hkatz@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; if its not too crowded...unrest isnt bad<br/>\n&gt; either...lots of sm. bronze and<br/>\n&gt; fs, with the chance of getting some decent equip.<br/>\n&gt; Dank<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_____________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nFree instant messaging and more at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://messenger.yahoo.com\">http://messenger.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
