But this guy was saying a Lvl 1 Orge could go in<br/>\nthere and get by all these tough baddies and cause some major trains.  For<br/>\none I&#39;d like to know how a low lvl anything can get even close to this<br/>\nplace, luck?  But someone replied to the post and said it was true a low lvl<br/>\nplayer could do that.<br/>\nI&#39;d love to see this place at least once, seen screen shots but pics are<br/>\nnothing I want to see the real deal.<br/>\nAlso heard the lag for this place (I take it is bad) was as bad as<br/>\nLavastorm.
