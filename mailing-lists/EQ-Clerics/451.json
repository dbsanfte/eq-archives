So<br/>\n&gt; Mr. J Daniels account would fit into what I heard about getting someone to<br/>\n&gt; level 20 in 5 hours.  This is all hear-say but I believe it.  Here is how<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; heard they did it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; First new character is outfitted in high level equipment and kick a??<br/>\n&gt; weapon.<br/>\n&gt; Then a group of 40+ characters buff the newbie; spells like Resolution,<br/>\n&gt; Symbol of Naltron, Armor of Faith from a cleric.  Talisman of Altune,<br/>\n&gt; Stamina, Guardian, Alacrity, Agility from a shaman.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Next Tanks go in on a level 20+ creature and taunt, clerics cast<br/>\nimmobilize<br/>\n&gt; and the newbie starts hitting on it.  If need be the cleric heals.  Once<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; creature is under half health the high level group takes it out and the<br/>\n&gt; newbie gets lots and lots of exp.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Of course, if the RL person behind this character hadn&#39;t played before<br/>\nthey<br/>\n&gt; have completely ruined the game for them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It will be fun to test this idea out one day, but for now I need to work<br/>\nmy<br/>\n&gt; way up high.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Fidan<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Mr. J Daniels [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warpig@...\">warpig@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, July 12, 1999 2:27 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] Twinking & Kiting<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thats 10 GAME days, not 10 REAL days non-stop.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Mr. J Daniels<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Mon, 12 Jul 1999, David Bradshaw wrote:<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;David Bradshaw&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Logain@...\">Logain@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  What did they tag team playing the character?
