This is also the reason why I encourage people to spread out throughout all three zones of Freeport.  It would be hard to get all three zones full enough to begin lagging out, and if they did I would encourage people to move even out to North Ro and ECommons.  I have posted these instructions on the web page for this reason only.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn another note, Verant is quite aware of the event at this time, and they plan to do their best in keeping lag down.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you all and I hope this is of some comfort to those concerned.<br/>\n<br/>\nSincerely,<br/>\nNorin Grimsbane</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
