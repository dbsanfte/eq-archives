A troll warrior<br/>\nfriend was pulling a few of them for us, and we stayed at the bridge.<br/>\nHe came back once with a griffawn, a gorge hound, a reaver, and a crag<br/>\nspider!  Needless to say the wizard died..., but it was fun.<br/>\n  Any site that has a decent EK map should show the location of the<br/>\nundead reavers.  I think there is a camp of them somewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: EvertorN &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:evertorn@...\">evertorn@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hail Curtis.<br/>\n&gt;Ok, do you play on veeshan?  If not lemme give you a quick history of <br/>\n&gt;unrest<br/>\n&gt;:)<br/>\n&gt;I first started playing this game in may, I didn&#39;t find a character I liked<br/>\n&gt;until around amonth later.  I settled on a Gnome Warrior and played him <br/>\n&gt;till<br/>\n&gt;lvl 24.  Now, during my stint in unrest (lvl 16-23) It was a VERY popular<br/>\n&gt;place.  There could be upwards of 115 ppl in there at the same time.<br/>\n&gt;Basically, &#39;safety in numbers&#39;.  Now that I&#39;m high enough lvl to actually <br/>\n&gt;go<br/>\n&gt;there with my cleric, there&#39;s avg. about 30 ppl there.  Take 15 or so off<br/>\n&gt;becaus they are lvl 30+, and your left with around  15 ppl for a group.. <br/>\n&gt;Now,<br/>\n&gt;14 of these are first time players, and there&#39;s me left.  Now I have found <br/>\n&gt;a<br/>\n&gt;group before, but left immediatly because I couldn&#39;t talk any sense into<br/>\n&gt;them.  They insisted on pulling from certain places in the first floor, and<br/>\n&gt;pulling from the second floor.  BIG MISTAKE<br/>\n&gt;Pulling from the second floor (when no one is camping it) usually brings <br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;ENTIRE second floor to you.  (then what do they do? run right towards the<br/>\n&gt;group, instant death almost) Pulling from certain areas in the first floor,<br/>\n&gt;pulls the ENTIRE floor.<br/>\n&gt;So I left because I didn&#39;t want to continuasly die.<br/>\n&gt;Oh and I try to stay away from soloing non dead because the delay on smite <br/>\n&gt;is<br/>\n&gt;so long.<br/>\n&gt;Where are these Undead Reavers you speak of in East Karana?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Evertorn<br/>\n&gt;Server: Veeshan<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Curtis Bennett wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Curtis Bennett&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:die_kluge@...\">die_kluge@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m 18th level, but I certainly hope I don&#39;t have this problem when I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; get to level 20!  I would think that groups would still want 20th<br/>\n&gt; &gt; level clerics if for no other reason than for Daring and Spirit Armor!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Admittedly, I&#39;m a little jealous that Druids at 19th get the same heal<br/>\n&gt; &gt; spell I do, so why get a cleric, when the Druid serves the same<br/>\n&gt; &gt; purpose at this level.  I kinda bothered me.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   I suspect you can solo with some success (or get some cleric friends<br/>\n&gt; &gt; together) the undead reavers in East Karana, or you might still can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; get xp (albeit probably not much) from scarecrows in WK.  I would<br/>\n&gt; &gt; still think Unrest would want clerics, or start your own group!  You<br/>\n&gt; &gt; might try Mistmoore, although 20 may be too low for that place, I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t know.  You could probably solo crag spiders and gorge hounds<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in EK, too.  You might try to get a group at the pickclaws in HH, too.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hmm, beyond that, I don&#39;t know.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Good luck! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
