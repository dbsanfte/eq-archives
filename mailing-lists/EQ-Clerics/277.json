One problem I  can&#39;t seem to solve is the<br/>\nmoney issue.  How did u guys get the spells and armor you  needed?  I<br/>\nfigure my lvl 9 spells will cost me near 25pp, and I still have my<br/>\nnewbie armor, and a rusty warhammer, nothing else...to get all leather<br/>\narmor would cost me around 25-30pp...I&#39;m currently lvl 7, and I have<br/>\n10pp to my name.  It&#39;s a start, yes, but no where near where it needs to<br/>\nbe.<br/>\nEven after this, how did you get money for the more exp spells?<br/>\nThis money issue is driving me crazy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEvertorN<br/>\nLevel 7 Erudite Cleric<br/>\nProud member of United We Stand/ Honorable Players</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
