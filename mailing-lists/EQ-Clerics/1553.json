Do you have a resident virus checker and what are its<br/>\n&gt; settings? Or do you<br/>\n&gt; have some other kind of scheduled CPU/disk/memory hog?<br/>\n&gt; 2. Do you have IPX drivers installed? I used to get a bad pausing<br/>\n&gt; problem in<br/>\n&gt; all games. It went away when I uninstalled the IPX drivers (I<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t really<br/>\n&gt; need them and you probably don&#39;t unless you run on an old Netware<br/>\n&gt; network).<br/>\n&gt; 3. Before you run EQ, reboot and clear your taskbar of resident stuff.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
