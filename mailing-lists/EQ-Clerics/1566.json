In fact, I used it today in the Qeynos<br/>\nsewers and killed 4 rats with one spell.  Pretty neat.  With tough<br/>\nmobs it&#39;s basically like shouting, &quot;hey, everyone, attack me!&quot;<br/>\nSummon food is handy.<br/>\nRoot is handy.<br/>\nI think fear is over-rated, but I have used it a few times.<br/>\nI don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever used endure fire, endure poison is only<br/>\nslightly more useful.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot that these spells aren&#39;t useful, but I suspect you could be just<br/>\nas useful of a cleric by just buying root, summon food, center, sense<br/>\nthe dead is sometimes handy (and it&#39;s cheap), and sometimes you might<br/>\nbe asked to &#39;soothe&#39; something, so get that one too.  And, like I<br/>\nsaid, depending on your weapon, hammer of wrath - which I used till<br/>\naround 12th.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t quite remember where I went at 9th.  I seem to recall it being<br/>\na rather difficult level, though.  10th was hard, too.  You might try<br/>\nSteamfont, the skeletons there are pretty tough.  If you get in a<br/>\ngroup try the chessboard.  At your level it is still too risky to<br/>\nsolo pawns.  But you can root/ward undead skeletons.  Ooh, I know, the<br/>\npirahna in the Rivervale river.  Perfect place.  Not only would the<br/>\npirahna give you xp, but it&#39;s a great quest (give the teeth to Fiddy<br/>\nBobeck), and gives you good loot.  Also, beyond the wall in Misty<br/>\nThicket.  Try goblin warriors, and giant scarabs.  With center/holy<br/>\narmor, you could probably solo a yellow giant scarab.  They really are<br/>\na pretty pathetic creature.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Yea, now that I think about it, Misty Thicket is where you want to<br/>\nbe.  This place can take you all the way (technically) to 14th, maybe<br/>\neven 15th (but it would be real slow at that point).<br/>\n  Another good place might be the Qeynos hills fighting gnolls, or the<br/>\nQeynos sewers fighting gelatinous cubes and frogloks.  Sounds like you<br/>\nare in Faydwar though by the Orc comment.<br/>\n<br/>\nhope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Garza, Russell&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:r.garza@...\">r.garza@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hello all,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I barely got lvl 9 last night (Woo Hoo!), and can&#39;t figure out any good<br/>\n&gt;spots to hunt.  It seems that everywhere I&#39;ve been has a lot of greens and<br/>\n&gt;yellows, or some blues hanging around with a bunch of yellows/reds.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Any advice on where a young cleric can get some experience.  I&#39;m tired of<br/>\n&gt;running for the zone when those Legionnaires come to the aide of their cent<br/>\n&gt;counterparts.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m sure you all remember getting 9th, but I don&#39;t know if you felt the<br/>\n&gt;disappointment, that I did, in the spells that we got.  I was all psyched <br/>\n&gt;to<br/>\n&gt;get root and maybe soothe, but what else is there that works well?  I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt;still using furor as my DD spell.  Seems pretty weak compared to a 9th <br/>\n&gt;level<br/>\n&gt;Druid&#39;s &quot;ignite&quot; spell that took a cent out in 2 casts.  I can hit em 4 or <br/>\n&gt;5<br/>\n&gt;times with furor and still have to duke it out for a while.  Any<br/>\n&gt;encouragement out there?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Wixl<br/>\n&gt;9th level Cleric<br/>\n&gt;Bertoxxulous Server </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
