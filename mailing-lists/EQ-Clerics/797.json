Next second it was beating the<br/>\n&gt;cr*p outta this poor guy but after the 3rd time he got the message!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>     Be careful. I thought that one approach to KS&#39;ing was canceling the<br/>\nKS&#39;s buffs, and canceling the root on his prey. I was told by a teammate<br/>\nthat this was considered a bannable offense by Verant. No, I have no ex<br/>\ncathedra verification of this.<br/>\n<br/>\n    For the life of me, I don&#39;t understand why Verant tolerates -- and even<br/>\nencourages, though the current kill-allocation algorithm -- the most<br/>\nantisocial and parasitic of players, and frustrates the 95% who want to play<br/>\nfair. And it seems to be adding insult to injury that they would ban players<br/>\nfor trying to protect themselves against the KS&#39;ers!
