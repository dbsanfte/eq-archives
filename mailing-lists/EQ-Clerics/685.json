Now a lot of<br/>\npeople compare the game to AD&D, so I&#39;ll do the same.  It seems<br/>\nabsurd to me to think that if the party kills a red dragon in AD&D,<br/>\nfor example, that they should expect the same kind of loot over and<br/>\nover again.  Seems to me the game should have been more random in<br/>\nterms of where items were found.  Sure jboots should be rare, but I<br/>\nagree, to make them only appear on 1 person is just insane.  If they<br/>\nare that rare, then they are unique, and then as soon as that person<br/>\ngot killed the owner would become the only person in the whole world<br/>\nto have them.  These are called artifacts and are unique.  But this<br/>\nkind of game has no room for artifacts.  In order to fully remove<br/>\ncamping, they need to stop making the items appear to just one<br/>\ncreature.  At the very least it seems that they could post something<br/>\nsaying that &quot;the jboot location has changed. so-and-so no longer has<br/>\nthem.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;I am certain that<br/>\n&gt;unless I buy a pair off EBay or in-game, I will never own them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;they are no drop, so there is no way you can buy them from someone you have<br/>\n&gt;to loot the corpse yourself for the boots.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;And for those of you who have the boots and will<br/>\n&gt;swear to me that it took you only a day to get them, I congratulate you on<br/>\n&gt;your accomplishment.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;It took my group 29 hours to get 4 pair of boots. I looted the first pair,<br/>\n&gt;and had it within an hour. But the rest came with 6 hour differences or so.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I do beleive that items such as JBoots should be put on more than one NPC.<br/>\n&gt;To have them only on Drezlna, is absolutely ridiculous. We had two kills of<br/>\n&gt;ours stolen when we camped that 29 hours. Verant should put items such as<br/>\n&gt;JBoots and Rubicite Armor on SEVERAL NPCs throughout Norrath. That way, <br/>\n&gt;more<br/>\n&gt;people will have a chance to own such items.....but I suppose that would<br/>\n&gt;make too many people happy and Verant doesn&#39;t appear to have the happiness<br/>\n&gt;of the customer in mind.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I agree that the servers need to capped. I even think 1000 on a server is<br/>\n&gt;alot...I would love to see servers capped at 500. Wow,<br/>\n&gt;would THAT be something =)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Lanadina<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Congratulations to MICHELLE UNSER<br/>\n&gt;This week∩┐╜s FRIENDS&FAMILY WINNER!<br/>\n&gt;To enter go to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html\">http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
