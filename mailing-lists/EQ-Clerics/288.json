I&#39;m 1 bar from<br/>\n8th but I have a complete set of leather armor and all my spells for<br/>\nmy level (including summon food in the bank which I bought too early).<br/>\nI think the trick for the cleric is to spend a great deal of time just<br/>\ndoing what I call having fun.  I haven&#39;t been overlly aggressive in<br/>\ntrying to go up in levels.  The test server only has about max 200<br/>\npeople on, so it&#39;s sometimes hard to get in a group.  And of course<br/>\nat this level, I can&#39;t exactly sit at an orc camp and take on 3 or 4<br/>\norc centurions myself.  Because of this I tend to just wander around<br/>\na lot and fight stray orc pawns and skeletons that have weapons.  Even<br/>\nthough I don&#39;t get any experience for killing the creature, I can make<br/>\nsome money.  I also was working on a lot of the newbie quests for<br/>\nthe bards and paladins, etc.  In greater faydark you can deliver mail<br/>\nfrom Felwithe to Kelethin for the Bards and get a gold coin every<br/>\ntime.  It even went up to 2 gp after the third time that I did it.  I<br/>\nwill probably go back and continue to do that.  And when some of my<br/>\ntravelling buds are on, I&#39;ll group and we&#39;ll go kill some orcs for<br/>\nsome xp.  But in the interrum, I just kill stuff for fun and profit,<br/>\nliterally, and not just for the XP.  All through 8th I&#39;m going to need<br/>\nsome money, of course, for my 9th level spells, but that shouldn&#39;t be<br/>\na problem.  Next I&#39;ll probably save up for a better weapon.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;&gt;From: EvertorN &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:evertorn@...\">evertorn@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Hi, After playing about 3 characters, I decided to make another, and so<br/>\n&gt;&gt;far I really like my cleric.  One problem I  can&#39;t seem to solve is the<br/>\n&gt;&gt;money issue.  How did u guys get the spells and armor you  needed?  I<br/>\n&gt;&gt;figure my lvl 9 spells will cost me near 25pp, and I still have my<br/>\n&gt;&gt;newbie armor, and a rusty warhammer, nothing else...to get all leather<br/>\n&gt;&gt;armor would cost me around 25-30pp...I&#39;m currently lvl 7, and I have<br/>\n&gt;&gt;10pp to my name.  It&#39;s a start, yes, but no where near where it needs to<br/>\n&gt;&gt;be.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Even after this, how did you get money for the more exp spells?<br/>\n&gt;&gt;This money issue is driving me crazy.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;EvertorN<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Level 7 Erudite Cleric<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Proud member of United We Stand/ Honorable Players </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
