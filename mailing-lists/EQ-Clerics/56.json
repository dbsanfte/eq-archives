My <br/>\nrecommendations for a weapon would be to try to find a mob that <br/>\ncarries a staff. Great worn staff is an excellent 2h blunt weapon, <br/>\nbut do not neglect your 1h blunt skill as you will be in dire need of <br/>\nit at higher lvls. I usually switch between my 1h and 2h to keep both <br/>\nat an equal lvl. <br/>\nAs far as spells goes I recommend getting as many of them as <br/>\npossible. With the possible exception of Cure Blindness which I have <br/>\nyet to find a use for. <br/>\nChuck G - Searching for the light</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
