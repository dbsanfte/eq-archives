Verant seems totally preoccupied with<br/>\ndiscovering and fixing ways players have found to make the game more<br/>\nplayable, rather than looking for positive changes that should be made to<br/>\nimprove both the classes and the game, itself.  It seems all they focus on<br/>\nis how to make things harder on the players.<br/>\n<br/>\n Why DON&#39;T they fix Fear Plane, or do something to improve the gosh awful<br/>\ncamping that is going on every single place where a decent item is found.<br/>\nLast weekend, we (our level 50s) went to like 7 different places to try and<br/>\nobtain items for some of us that didn&#39;t have them.  This was at 10am EDT on<br/>\na Sunday morning.  Every single last place was camped and the lower level<br/>\ngroups that were there told us they would be there all day and nite.  Since<br/>\nthere was really nothing else for us to do, (can&#39;t go to Fear and noone<br/>\nneeds exp anymore)  we all simply logged and went about doing  RL things<br/>\noutside of EQ.<br/>\n<br/>\n Verant needs to wake up to the fact that their high level players are<br/>\ngetting fed up and bored, and THAT&#39;s why they are leaving and/or selling<br/>\ntheir characters on ebay and looking for new games.<br/>\n<br/>\nMik</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
