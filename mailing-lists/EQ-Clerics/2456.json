For instance, just last night, everyone came back after a server<br/>\ndump and everyone lost one item or another.  A lvl 38 druid friend of mine<br/>\nlost everything she was wearing.  Most ppl either lost stuff in their<br/>\ninventory, person, bank account, or ALL.  From what I understand from<br/>\ntalking to Test Server veterans who has been there over 4 months, this<br/>\noccurs quit often and from the last time, they either didnt get their items<br/>\nreplace or didnt get all of them replace.  Basically, he says that he had to<br/>\nrestart with the items twice.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther things that can go wrong on Test is that some skills can get screw up<br/>\nand not fix for quit awhile....for instance, druid&#39;s tracking.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, it seems that more and more ppl are now coming over to Test...its<br/>\nbeginning to become just as crowded as a production server...so I don&#39;t know<br/>\nif there will be as much advantages over the regular server.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust thought to let u guys know.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Imogen</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
