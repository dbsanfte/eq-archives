Haven&#39;t you been buffing yourself or others? Of course they<br/>\nstack, my friend. All your buffs stack, one right on top of the other.<br/>\nEventually, you&#39;ll have a stack of four beautiful yellow shields that<br/>\nwill make you a power to be dealt with. Last night a cleric gave me<br/>\nBravery, Guard, Rune 1, and the level 2 Symbol. At level 19, I had 974<br/>\nhp. And my AC was 473. Unfortunately, he was too high level (33) to be<br/>\nin our group.

When I am in a<br/>\ngroup<br/>\nI will watch the health bars of all the others and break off from melee<br/>\nto<br/>\nheal.  Most of the time when I am in a group and heal, the mob will<br/>\nstart in<br/>\non me though.  I of course have taken off my auto-attack and changed<br/>\ntarget.<br/>\nMost of the time I have even backed off away from the critter.   I take<br/>\nmy<br/>\nrole as the medic in my group very seriously.  My buffs are not that<br/>\ngreat<br/>\nyet at 10 as I only have center and the first level spell to use.   I do<br/>\nnot<br/>\nthink that holy armor and center can be stacked.  As I have stated many<br/>\ntimes here before though my problem is finding a group to start with.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also will not use smite that often in melee unless I am alone since I<br/>\ndo<br/>\nprefer to save my mana for healing and buffing.  Those two buffs alone<br/>\ntake<br/>\nme about two bars of mana.   I have around a 105 or 110 wisdom and two<br/>\nwisdom rings of +2.   I know I need more items but they are expensive<br/>\nfor<br/>\nsure and I, like most my age, am pretty broke.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really do not see why the others fail to do their duty.  I often play<br/>\nmelee classes and have clerics and druids heal me when I am resting all<br/>\nthe<br/>\ntime.<br/>\n<br/>\nYilari, Cleric of Tunare, Erollsi Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
