A spell you cast say before<br/>\nyou fight and it works like the Bards heal song and heals you a little over<br/>\ntime.  Have a icon the shows up like any buffs you have on a stay for 5-10<br/>\nmins.  Maybe later do a group heal spell like this one.  I&#39;m not saying to<br/>\nhave to heal us or someone says a lot but just a little over time, maybe<br/>\nhave a few, (depends on how many lvls they give us), and say the first one<br/>\ndoes 5 heal points so many secs, the next one does 20 every so many secs.<br/>\nJust an idea.  What do you all think on that idea?<br/>\n<br/>\n***************************<br/>\nAzor Spellbound<br/>\nLvl 20 Human Cleric of The Rathe<br/>\n***************************</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
