Personally, I have a base str of 70, but with different pieces like rings, purity belt, bs mantle, I&#39;m up to 77.  Also, i use bronze, but a cleric shouldnt have to worry that much about AC.  use a bs tunic or dwarven ringmail tunic instead of a platemail breastplate, those things are heavy.  Plus in an earlier mail someone said that once you start getting  + wisdom items, the worries about str disappear.<br/>\nAllsar Olath`Vlos` - Rathe<br/>\n    -----Original Message-----<br/>\n    From: Greggory Peck &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:greggorypeck@...\">greggorypeck@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n    To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n    Date: Sunday, June 13, 1999 6:21 PM<br/>\n    Subject: [EQ-Clerics] Clerics, weight, and strength<br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n    I&#39;ve been reading all the posts about clerics strength and the ability to wear plate armor.  As far as I can tell Dwarf&#39;s make the &quot;best&quot; clerics, with the one drawback that later they can&#39;t wear green splintered mail.  However, we can wear almost all other magical armors.  I have a base str of 103 and w/ my shield, weapon, full set of bronze except the mantle which is BloodStained my base weight w/ food and water is I too face weight issues even w/ 103 str.  For instance while hunting in permafrost I find it necessary to have a shaman summon me a spirit pack (all items inside the pack weigh 0).  This is necessary becuase after picking up 2 FS weapons I&#39;m encumbered.  The closes place to permafrost to sell is a LONG ways away.  You can&#39;t be leaving allt he time to sell and bank items.  I recommend having a shaman summon you some of these spirit packs.  Also make sure you get STR buffs from somebody... you will need them.  One warning about the spirit pack though.  It disapears when you logout, any items still in the pack when you logout also disapear.  So always move them to another regular backpack before you logout.<br/>\n    <br/>\n    Duhas Alegulper<br/>\n    Tarrew Marr<br/>\n    Cleric of 20th circle</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
