Didn&#39;t you give it to them for something and then sell that item<br/>\n&gt;&gt;back? I was told by several people that they had put a stop to that, before<br/>\n&gt;&gt;I ever got a chance to try it out...<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Also, has the wisp spawn on the island in Erud&#39;s Crossing changed again?<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Back in May I fought there with a Ranger for a day or so before a patch and<br/>\n&gt;&gt;made like 100pp selling the stones for 4 gp and change, but after the patch<br/>\n&gt;&gt;the spawn was cut by two thirds and I would get a stone of any sort like<br/>\n&gt;&gt;once every ten kills....   and then they added in the burned outs....   so<br/>\n&gt;&gt;frustrating to loot, see a stone and get all excited to find out it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;&gt;burned out??  of course everyone is used to that now....<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Cal<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;At 03:36 PM 10/20/99 +0000, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Curtis Bennett&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:die_kluge@...\">die_kluge@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;What do you mean, in an intelligent manner?  What manner is that?  I<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;am 19th, and before I bought my banded armor, I had 98 plat in the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;bank and some change.  I have 8 greater lightstones in a backpack that<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;I can sell to the gypsies for around 72 plat.  That put me at around<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;170 plat.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;  The most profitable thing at 15th level is either bronze weapons or<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;greater lighstones.  Both of which are semi-rare.  These are the only<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;things that I can think of.  You can kill the occasional gem dropping mob <br/>\n&gt;&gt;in<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Faydwar, Pixies, or Drakes, or those winged-women things in<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Steamfont, but even those aren&#39;t that valuable or very common.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;  The only other thing I can think of is that you are doing quests and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;then auctioning the items.  Like doing the Shining Star of Light quest<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;over and over again and then selling it for 50 pp a pop or something.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;I suppose it might fetch that much on a production server, certainly<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;not on Test.  Seems like the demand would run low, and most newbies<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;simply can&#39;t afford that much.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Beyond that, I can not thing of any normal means to acquire 4000 plat<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;by the time you reach 15th level.  It is inconceivable.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;  You talk like it is common knowledge that everyone should have 4000<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;plat by the time they are 15th level.  That&#39;s just absurd.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;  A friend of mine stayed up all night once and killed wisps on wisp<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;isle.  He sold all the greater lightstones to the gypsy camp and ended<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;up making around 800 plat.  It took him nearly a day to do that.  He<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;was 20th level.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;From: AoS/Aosinator &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:darshan@...\">darshan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Very profitable way to hunt?  Sounds like you&#39;re exploiting to me.  I<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;don&#39;t know any 15th level anythings that can shell out the 1000+ pp<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;for an observer staff.  That&#39;s a lot of greater lightstones and bronze<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;spears.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Can be done and has been done in the past, without use of exploits.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Aosinator had amassed almost 4000pp by the time she was level 15, and it<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;was by using her proceeds in an intelligent manner.
