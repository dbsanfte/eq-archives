To put it<br/>\n&gt;&gt;bluntly, I got hammered. :) I managed to get my alcohol tolerance from 0<br/>\n </span></blockquote>to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;&gt;60. I noticed that my STR and STA went up a little bit. I had previously<br/>\n&gt;&gt;heard that this was a warrior only effect, but now I know otherwise.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;In the last couple of days I worked on tolerance a bit more and maxed it<br/>\n&gt;for<br/>\n&gt;&gt;my level (130 at 25). I am still unable to get the STR and STA boost<br/>\n&gt;without<br/>\n&gt;&gt;getting too drunk to be useful. I am imagining a point at which I can slam<br/>\n&gt;&gt;down a few meads before a battle and not fall over myself when I need to<br/>\n&gt;&gt;cast.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;On the other hand, I am beginning to find that when I&#39;m in a decent sized<br/>\n&gt;&gt;party and we&#39;re hunting tough mobs, I stay out of danger so I can stick to<br/>\n&gt;&gt;healing. I had always assumed that this would be the case, especially at<br/>\n&gt;&gt;higher levels.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;So is it worth continuing to work on alcohol tolerance? It certainly<br/>\n&gt;doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;&gt;cost much (its actually a good way to get rid of some silver and copper :)<br/>\n&gt;&gt;and I&#39;m enjoying annoying my wizard friend with it. But is it going to be<br/>\n&gt;of<br/>\n&gt;&gt;any use to me?<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Salter<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Fennin Ro<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Enter ONElist&#39;s Friends & Family Program<br/>\n&gt;&gt;WIN $100 to Amazon.com!
