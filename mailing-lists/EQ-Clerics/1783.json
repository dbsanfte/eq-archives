He or his<br/>\nplaceholder spawn right at the entrance.  Not a little way down or anything<br/>\nelse, immediately inside the zone.  He then immediately shouts and walks to<br/>\nthe 3rd floor.  There are several random spots he can go to on the 3rd<br/>\nfloor.  To get him to spawn again (he seems to be between a 20 and 30 min<br/>\nspawn) you have to find and kill the placeholder on the 3rd floor.  You will<br/>\nknow when you have the right one, because they *usually* do the shout again<br/>\nwhen you attack them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAstur il&#39;Ayan, Cleric of Brell<br/>\nSolusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    -----Original Message-----<br/>\n    From: Jerry Hawkins [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhawkins@...\">jhawkins@...</a>]<br/>\n    Sent: Friday, October 08, 1999 3:45 PM<br/>\n    To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n    Subject: [EQ-Clerics] Paw of Opalla<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    Hey Everyone,<br/>\n<br/>\n    I really would like to complete my Paw of Opalla, i TOTALLY lucked in to<br/>\nthe first 3 rings, i camped Mitty for about an hour and she droped the gold<br/>\nand copper.  Picked the silver up in Blackburrow, and now all i need is the<br/>\nPlatinum.  Therein lies the problem.<br/>\n<br/>\n    I have heard many differing accounts of where to find Gynok Molter.  So,<br/>\nif you have SEEN him, not heard about him being somewhere, but ACTUALLY SEEN<br/>\nHIM with YOUR character, please let me know where.  Yes, i know Befallen,<br/>\nbut where?  First floor in entrance area? Third floor near Elf Skeletons??<br/>\nPlease let me know any visual sightings.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Thanks,<br/>\n<br/>\n    Smeal Stonehammer<br/>\n    22nd Sphere of Life,<br/>\n    Deciple of Rodcet Nife,<br/>\n    Veeshan Existance<br/>\n<br/>\n    played by<br/>\n<br/>\n    Jerry Hawkins<br/>\n    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Jhawkins@...\">Jhawkins@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
