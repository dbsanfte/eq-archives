I almost<br/>\nhave 170 wis (that darn gold ring wont pop on Mitty).  Anyway, Level 39<br/>\nResuscitate takes 500 mana to cast and drops my mana by under 2 bubbs.  I can<br/>\ncast 3 Resuscitate in a row, then be so close OOM it hurts (I usuallu throw in a<br/>\nsup heal too, so 2 is my normal max).  There is a little blue in the bar still,<br/>\ncould probably summon four food if I hadn&#39;t neglected my conjuration skill so<br/>\nbadly, but not much else).  I usually sit and med between recycle times for the<br/>\nspell, but I don&#39;t think its enough to regain the mana I have when done.<br/>\n<br/>\nUsing the formula given ([(wis/5)+2]*level) = [(161/5)+2*43]  = 1470.6<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter casting 3, I&#39;d say I have around 1600 mana, but it&#39;s awfully close.  This<br/>\nis what the mana calculator on EQCasters uses (http://eq.castersrealm.com) and<br/>\nit&#39;s the closest I&#39;ve seen.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill not a bad approximation.  I also heard that (Wis)*(Level)/4  is the<br/>\nfomula, which give me 161*43/4 = 1730.75, which is probably too high.<br/>\n<br/>\nAilamil Faithbringer</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
