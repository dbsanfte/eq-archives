I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-968359736\">The game has changed a lot since I started (first week of release) so <br/>\n     the items I had at various levels are a lot different that what people <br/>\n     have today.  I didn&#39;t know anyone that was high level that could help <br/>\n     me out as there were very few high level chars and places like lower <br/>\n     guk were largely unexplored.  Not to mention that permafrost wasn&#39;t <br/>\n     even itemized.<br/>\n     <br/>\n     When I was L10 I hadn&#39;t ventured out of misty thicket and was wearing <br/>\n     patchwork/cloth with no magic items at all (except my hammer of <br/>\n     wrath).<br/>\n     <br/>\n     By L20 I was fighting in oasis and was wearing mostly banded armor <br/>\n     with a few patchwork pieces.  Still no jewelry beyond dervish rings.  <br/>\n     The one good item I did have was the crook from lockjaw when we were <br/>\n     actually able to get the kill.<br/>\n     <br/>\n     By L30 I think I had mostly bronze plate from fighting in unrest and <br/>\n     lake rathe and possibly some +4wis +2st rings, BI medallion and <br/>\n     polished bone bracers (can&#39;t exactly remember).  Also might have had <br/>\n     an enameled mace and mistmoor shield by this time.<br/>\n     <br/>\n     In the low 30&#39;s is when I started to make some money from mistmoor and <br/>\n     when I moved to sol b at L34.  Then the good stuff started coming in <br/>\n     :).<br/>\n     <br/>\n     Now compare this to what people have out there today and you can tell <br/>\n     it&#39;s a lot different and I&#39;m not one to judge yourself on.  I&#39;ve <br/>\n     always felt that it&#39;s not the items that make you a good cleric.<br/>\n     <br/>\n     I sometimes feel sorry for new players out there now.  There are so <br/>\n     many twinks running around in awesome equipment it must be hard seeing <br/>\n     someone that con&#39;s green wearing way better equipment than you are.<br/>\n     <br/>\n     Just remember, A naked L30 cleric could beat the crap out of a L20 <br/>\n     cleric with awesome equipment :)<br/>\n     <br/>\n     Drogo DarkBane<br/>\n     L50 Halfling Cleric<br/>\n     The Rathe<br/>\n     <br/>\n     P.S.  Were the other high level clerics on this list like this as <br/>\n     well?<br/>\n     <br/>\n<br/>\n     <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;&gt;Well, I consider myself to be under equipped for my level (getting harder to <br/>\n&gt;&gt;say that now that I have some purple stuff) as I have had a few items for <br/>\n&gt;&gt;almost 30 levels now.  Anyway I&#39;ll give you a run down on the items I wear.<br/>\n     <br/>\n     <br/>\n&gt;How about posting a list of what you were wearing at the milestones (lvl <br/>\n&gt;10, lvl 20, etc) That way we could see what we should be looking for when <br/>\n&gt;we reach those levels. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
