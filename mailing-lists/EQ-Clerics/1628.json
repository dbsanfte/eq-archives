The game world is<br/>\ncompletely pre-defined.  The server doesn&#39;t send you any information<br/>\nabout what the trees, buildings or scenery looks like.  All the<br/>\nserver sends is information about what the monsters are doing, what<br/>\nthe people are doing, any messages, and if there are any corpses or<br/>\nequipment laying on the ground anywhere.  That is, things that are<br/>\nnot part of the static world.  You have a CD, that CD stores the<br/>\npre-defined world.<br/>\n  I could see where corpses would increase lag because that<br/>\ninformation would need to be sent to you.  A lot of people in a zone,<br/>\nand a lot of monsters running aggro.  All these things would do it.<br/>\nFaydark does not take longer to load than North Ro.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Sean O&#39;Brien&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sobrien@...\">sobrien@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: &quot;Sean O&#39;Brien&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sobrien@...\">sobrien@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Of course they increase lag.<br/>\n&gt;A higher Polygon count and texture count, means slowwer redraw more<br/>\n&gt;texture and memory swapping.
