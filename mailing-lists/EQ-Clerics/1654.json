Thats what got ppl wondering on what will happen once the pak is<br/>\nreleased, cause they keep getting exp and they wonder whats gonna happen<br/>\nwith that exp.  As for what happens to the bar onces its filled, ask a Lvl<br/>\n50 we have at least two on this list.  I think I heard once it&#39;s filled it<br/>\nchanges colors or something.<br/>\n <br/>\n***************************************<br/>\nAzor Spellbound<br/>\nLvl 21 Human Cleric of The Rathe<br/>\n***************************************<br/>\n<br/>\nisnt this a bit....ridiculous?  First off....are they EVEN GAINING EXP after<br/>\n50?  and if so....its damn hard enough....killing drags etc.  Not to<br/>\nmention....whathappens when the bar fills completely?  does it restart?<br/>\nUnless you can answer me.....please....dont write this kinda philisophical<br/>\ncrap.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBann</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
