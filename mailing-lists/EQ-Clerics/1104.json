When they unstun they take some time<br/>\nto turn around to look for you, when you notice this, stun them again.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI reply:<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m don&#39;t know if this is good advice. For one thing, the lower level<br/>\nstun lasts only two seconds. By the time you&#39;ve run around the caster,<br/>\nhe&#39;s not stunned anymore. For another thing, the recast time for stun is<br/>\nvery long. And, if the caster is smart, he won&#39;t turn around to find<br/>\nyou. He should already have you targeted, and he&#39;ll just hit his cast<br/>\nbutton. He doesn&#39;t have to see you to cast a spell. And, if you&#39;re<br/>\ndueling, he should realize that you won&#39;t be outside his casting range.<br/>\nI think Flash of Light would yield better results. It lasts much longer<br/>\n(12-18 seconds, I think), and he cannot cast while blinded. If you want<br/>\nto confuse your opponent even more, cast Fear on him after you&#39;ve<br/>\nblinded him. He&#39;ll never know what hit him.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis from having dueled nasty necros in Lake Rathe. They really hated it<br/>\nwhen I Feared them, heh heh.<br/>\n<br/>\nSaidinn Witchwood</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
