WOW<br/>\n&gt; have things changed.  I was in High Hold going to East Co and had to go<br/>\n&gt; through Kichlor Forest.  I almost died trying to get through.  I didnt know<br/>\n&gt; they changed that area.  DAMN!!!!!!  Anyway....  The reason I decided to<br/>\n&gt; leave because I couldnt find a group in any of the places.  I still couldnt<br/>\n&gt; believe noone wanted a cleric in their group.  Well I am level 25 and just<br/>\n&gt; wondering where can I hunt?  The best places that a cleric will feel<br/>\n&gt; welcomed,  and if you say unrest no way!!!!  Thanks guys :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Qanin Skywanderer<br/>\n&gt; The Rathe 25th Circle<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
