I&#39;ve been trying to hunt down<br/>\nwisps, but I can&#39;t find a reasonable concentration of them.  Is there a<br/>\nplace that&#39;s particularly good for wisp hunting?  Any other tips for<br/>\nadvancing through these rather laborious levels?  I&#39;ve tried soloing (which<br/>\nis about suicide) and grouping, but it&#39;s just slow.  Lemme know what you<br/>\nthink and how you made it to lvl 14.  Also, any money-making tips for this<br/>\nstrength would be MUCH appreciated =)  We all know a cleric&#39;s life is one of<br/>\nperpetual poverty.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nAran&#39;gar<br/>\nRight Hand of the Dark<br/>\nTarrew Mar</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
