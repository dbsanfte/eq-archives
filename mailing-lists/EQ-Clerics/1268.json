I think the first group there stays there, regardless of their level.  And noone is able ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-699714705\">I&#39;ll tell you what my whole opinion is on this camping/yield issue.  I think<br/>\nthe<br/>\nfirst group there stays there, regardless of their level.  And noone is able<br/>\nto throw<br/>\nanother group out if that group was there first.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have wanted a nightshade wreath and gem sceptre for ages.  So today,<br/>\nmyself and 5 other level 50s went to camp MM castle.  Everything there was<br/>\ngreen to us, but myself and a level 50 shaman friend wanted wreaths and<br/>\nsceptres, which we didn&#39;t have.  Under Brad&#39;s rule, if a group of<br/>\nlevel 35+ comes, and they can get exp for that area, then we have to yield<br/>\nand give up a spot we have been at for hours. Tell me where the fairness in<br/>\nTHAT<br/>\nrule is.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince there are very few places I can get exp anymore and have maxxed<br/>\nout level 50, I am going around and getting items I don&#39;t have because I was<br/>\nfocusing on exp and helping others level as well.  I plan to do the Paw of<br/>\nOpallo quest next.  Mitty is green to me, as is Gynok Moltar.  Should I have<br/>\nto leave camping them just because lower levels come to camp for the same<br/>\nitems I<br/>\nwant?  I think that is totally unfair. Just because I am level 50 doesn&#39;t<br/>\nmean I&quot;m not<br/>\nentitled to get items I don&#39;t have just because the mobs don&#39;t give me exp<br/>\nanymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, my opinion is....first there stays there.  Then when they leave, the<br/>\nnext group in line gets the camp spot.  I don&#39;t think levels should have<br/>\nanything to do with who gets the camp spot.  I don&#39;t think high levels<br/>\nshould force lower levels away from a camp spot, and I don&#39;t think lower<br/>\nlevels should be able to force higher levels away if they were there first.<br/>\nTo do it any other way discriminates against one group over another (higher<br/>\nvs. lower).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I&#39;ll tell you this....if a GM tells me to leave a camp spot I have been<br/>\nat<br/>\nfor hours for an item I don&#39;t have that I want just because some lower<br/>\nlevels  arrived and want my spot, then I won&#39;t be playing EQ for very<br/>\nmuch longer.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only fair way IMO is first there stays there, regardless of level, then<br/>\nwhomever was next gets it next, and so on and so on.  Get in line and take a<br/>\nnumber.  No one group of players should be favored over another.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo do it Brad&#39;s way, would mean that any player that didn&#39;t get an item<br/>\nwhile he/she was<br/>\nable to get exp from that particular mob could basically never get that item<br/>\ncause they could be<br/>\nthrown out of the camp spot everytime lower levels came along.  This is<br/>\ntotally not fair.<br/>\n<br/>\nMik (who abhors discrimination or favoritism in any way, shape or form)<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: John Erik Maynus &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jmaynus@...\">jmaynus@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Saturday, September 11, 1999 11:41 PM<br/>\nSubject: [EQ-Clerics] Yield Policy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;John Erik Maynus&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jmaynus@...\">jmaynus@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;What does everyone think of this Yield Policy?
