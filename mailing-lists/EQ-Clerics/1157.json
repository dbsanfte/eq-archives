What makes it worse is the spell has a small duration<br/>\nand it takes valuable seconds to get yourself pointed back in the right<br/>\ndirection. Oh well, one can only hope that if enough p<br/>\neople complain EQ designers will adjust it.<br/>\nAlso I would like to get your opinions on the fashion issue. What do you<br/>\nthink of the women of Norrath being able to attend an event, such as a<br/>\nwedding in a dress. There also should a gathering place in Qeynos where an<br/>\nevent could take place without being attacked by beasts, or the guys could<br/>\nreally become Knights in Shining Armor by protecting all the fair damsels of<br/>\nNorrath. Again an item for my wish list as I sometimes get tired of wearing<br/>\nmy full battle dress all the time. Healingsun, Solusek Ro. Level 15 cleric</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
