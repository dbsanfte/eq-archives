Does my mana get recalculated as if I had a character with<br/>\nthe new wisdom value through all levels?  If so, this seems to be a<br/>\nfantastic way to jack up your mana.  I see items all around that raise your<br/>\nmana directly by 20 or so, but it would seem that a minor adjustment in<br/>\nwisdom (if the above were true) would make a better improvement.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically my question is what happens when you raise your wisdom?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nTrew of Bristlebane</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
