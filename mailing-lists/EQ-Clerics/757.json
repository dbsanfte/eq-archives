This frustrates me<br/>\n&gt; to <br/>\n&gt; no end.  I can&#39;t begin to tell you how long I have been trying for a Shiny<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Brass Shield in Crushbone and how many kills have been stolen from me from<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; some mage hiding in a tree.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think the problem is how Verant determines who gets the kill. As I <br/>\n&gt; understand it, the single person that inflicts the most damage is awarded <br/>\n&gt; the kill.  This means that it does not matter if you are grouped and your <br/>\n&gt; group does more damage than the spell caster.  Does this seem crazy to <br/>\n&gt; anyone else.  It should work that the groups damage counts as one. I<br/>\n&gt; believe <br/>\n&gt; that this would cut down on the amount of kills that are stolen.  It seems<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; like an easy fix and it makes logical sense.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What is everyone else&#39;s opinion, and has anybody heard of Verant<br/>\n&gt; commenting <br/>\n&gt; on this issue?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Chrisstauf..of the Lightbringers guild<br/>\n&gt; Cleric of the 14th circle<br/>\n&gt; Karana server<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  your connection to online communities.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
