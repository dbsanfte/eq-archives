If you yourself get blinded while<br/>\nsoloing it kinda puts a kink in your gameplan.  Not being able to see<br/>\nwhat&#39;s going on can cost you your life.  As with a few other cure<br/>\nspells, it sometimes has to be cast more than once to be effective. &lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been using Cancel Magic effectively against the blindness that the Muddites cause. I have one question: Is it significantly faster to cast a Cure Blindness than Cancel Magic? I know cancel magic uses 50% more mana but it is so little anyway (20 -&gt; 30) that there is no point in purchasing the spell just for that. Besides the cancel magic works for a wider variety of things. Very useful when you are rooted, isn&#39;t it? Is there anything that could cause blindness and that cancel magic could not cure?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
