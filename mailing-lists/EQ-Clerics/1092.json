I play a cleric on Vallon Zek and <br/>\noccationally battle other players. In my experience, clerics are not good <br/>\noffensively, but rather good defensively, especially grouped.<br/>\nOnce a necromancer cast dots on me (engulfing darkness and boil blood I <br/>\nbelieve), plus fear. I dropped HPs rapidly, but managed to cast a couple of <br/>\nheals on myself, and then the DOTs wore off.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan clerics generally survive a fight versus casters by healing themselves? <br/>\nIf I cast 4 greater heals on myself I can heal for 1200+ damage. Although I <br/>\nam not sure, I doubt a wizard will have the mana to deliver 2000 damage at <br/>\nmy level (24), and some of his damage might be resisted. Assuming I have <br/>\nfull armour, I should be able to root and melee the caster to death.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther useful spells are blindness and stun. I use the low level variants of <br/>\nstun since they take less mana. Divine aura is useful since the attacker <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t always observe that I am invulnerable, especially casters, since <br/>\nthey don&#39;t get any damage information (=&quot;blabla hit by non melee for 140 <br/>\ndamage&quot; etc).<br/>\n<br/>\nBuying an egg shaped pumice is also a good investment, although it is quite <br/>\nexpensive. It is a magic item sold by some vendors (in Neriak, the one near <br/>\nthe bank) and has 5 charges of &quot;pillage enchantment&quot;, that will cancel <br/>\nseveral effects like charm/DOTs (and buffs) at the same time.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
