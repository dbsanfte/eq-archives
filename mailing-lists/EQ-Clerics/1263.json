No, in it you can not<br/>\nget all the super gear at level 1. Thank the gods for that.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I give the game 3-4 years(at least). Ohh, I dont expect to see<br/>\nthe same number of people next year and the one after. Most likely there<br/>\nwill be a syphoning from other games but I dont see it as dying anytime<br/>\nsoon.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for another comment somewhere else about Fennin being overcrowded. I play<br/>\non Cazic Thule and find it is fairly decent most places. There are a few<br/>\nzones where all the jerks go to and I keep away from those. But there are<br/>\nalso some where people are extremely decent and helpful. What I have noticed<br/>\nis that power gamers seem to generally belong to the first category.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, that was my 2cp worth.

Many are just bored of the game and are quiting<br/>\n&gt;or<br/>\n&gt;getting ready to, others are getting tired of Verant changing everything<br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;some of it is for the worse.  I&#39;ve read where they are saying it&#39;s too late<br/>\n&gt;to save EQ, some even say even the new addon will not save it cause it&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt;still be the same game with just some new things.  And yeah it might spice<br/>\n&gt;it up a bit, but for how long, I give it 3-4 months tops.  After 3-4 months<br/>\n&gt;the power gamers will already have the extra lvls, everyone should have<br/>\n&gt;been<br/>\n&gt;in all the new zones, had a chance to play the new lizardman race.  So once<br/>\n&gt;that happens it&#39;s gonna be right back to where it is now.<br/>\n&gt;Some are waiting for Asheron&#39;s Call and others are waiting for Middle-Earth<br/>\n&gt;to be released.  Will AC or ME finish off EQ?  I guess time will tell but<br/>\n&gt;since theres like 3-4 other RPGs coming out by the year 2000 I say one of<br/>\n&gt;them will put an end to EQ.  And if EQ does die to fast it&#39;s no ones fault<br/>\n&gt;but Verants for not listening to the paying customers, they listen to a few<br/>\n&gt;but not the whole.<br/>\n&gt;Even tho EQ is a very good game it can&#39;t or won&#39;t be around forever.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;**************************<br/>\n&gt;Azor<br/>\n&gt;Lvl 18 Human Cleric of the Rathe<br/>\n&gt;**************************<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;ONElist:  your connection to online communities.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nHow would you like to have a voice in the marketplace and be<br/>\nrewarded for it?
