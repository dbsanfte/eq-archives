One<br/>\nnotable exception, however, is that as a cleric you will be _very_ hard<br/>\npressed to solo here effectively.  To judge how well you would do with the<br/>\nweakest mobs, go into Crushbone and try to solo D&#39;Vinn without his dagger.<br/>\nIf you can kill him easily, then you&#39;ll have no problem there with a single<br/>\nInitiate Familiar.  Problem is, most of the spawns come in at least twos,<br/>\nsome come in threes.<br/>\n    And anything under 10 people killing things around the base of the tower<br/>\nwill result in trains at least as ugly as those in Unrest.  At level 20, you<br/>\nmay want to stick to Unrest for a level or two.  Mistmoore has an ugly<br/>\ntendency to turn on a healer the moment they finish their first heal spell<br/>\nin a battle.  And when a blue initiate familiar is beating on me double<br/>\nrounds, sometimes hitting for 31-40, it makes my job at healing a little<br/>\ntougher.  With a proper group, though, you can gain xp super-quick.  I made<br/>\n24 from 23 in at most 6 played hours, at least an hour of which was sitting<br/>\nin Lesser Fay waiting for the Ancillae train on the other side to clear out.<br/>\nKeep in mind that some things there can see invis, too.  Hope that helps ya.<br/>\n:)<br/>\n<br/>\nLohre Soulsaver<br/>\nBristlebane Server<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: John Erik Maynus &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jmaynus@...\">jmaynus@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, September 24, 1999 3:59 PM<br/>\nSubject: [EQ-Clerics] Where for a Lvl 20?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;John Erik Maynus&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jmaynus@...\">jmaynus@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now that I&#39;m Lvl 20 I&#39;ve been wanting to go else where to get some nice<br/>\nexp<br/>\n&gt; instade of Highpass.
