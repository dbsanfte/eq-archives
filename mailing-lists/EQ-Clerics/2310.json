Last night a cleric gave me<br/>\n&gt;Bravery, Guard, Rune 1, and the level 2 Symbol. At level 19, I had 974<br/>\n&gt;hp. And my AC was 473. Unfortunately, he was too high level (33) to be<br/>\n&gt;in our group.

When I am in a<br/>\n&gt;group<br/>\n&gt;I will watch the health bars of all the others and break off from melee<br/>\n&gt;to<br/>\n&gt;heal.  Most of the time when I am in a group and heal, the mob will<br/>\n&gt;start in<br/>\n&gt;on me though.  I of course have taken off my auto-attack and changed<br/>\n&gt;target.<br/>\n&gt;Most of the time I have even backed off away from the critter.   I take<br/>\n&gt;my<br/>\n&gt;role as the medic in my group very seriously.  My buffs are not that<br/>\n&gt;great<br/>\n&gt;yet at 10 as I only have center and the first level spell to use.   I do<br/>\n&gt;not<br/>\n&gt;think that holy armor and center can be stacked.  As I have stated many<br/>\n&gt;times here before though my problem is finding a group to start with.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I also will not use smite that often in melee unless I am alone since I<br/>\n&gt;do<br/>\n&gt;prefer to save my mana for healing and buffing.  Those two buffs alone<br/>\n&gt;take<br/>\n&gt;me about two bars of mana.   I have around a 105 or 110 wisdom and two<br/>\n&gt;wisdom rings of +2.   I know I need more items but they are expensive<br/>\n&gt;for<br/>\n&gt;sure and I, like most my age, am pretty broke.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I really do not see why the others fail to do their duty.  I often play<br/>\n&gt;melee classes and have clerics and druids heal me when I am resting all<br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Yilari, Cleric of Tunare, Erollsi Marr<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&lt;&lt; text3.html &gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
