If ya feel like making a character there you are<br/>\nwelcome<br/>\n&gt; to hunt along with us, we all started out in freeport.  they are lvl 5 and<br/>\n&gt; i&#39;m lvl  4, we are hunting right near the zone point in befallen and we<br/>\nwere<br/>\n&gt; the only people there last night, the XP was great )<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I was so happy I made patchwork pants for myself )))<br/>\n&gt; Funny the things you get enjoyment out of again<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Bree/Laurelei<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: Mikaela Valorblade &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mikaela@...\">mikaela@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, December 07, 1999 8:07 AM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] Playing on Test server<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Mikaela Valorblade&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mikaela@...\">mikaela@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Bree, I think that is wonderful.  I tried creating new characters on<br/>\nother<br/>\n&gt; &gt; servers but what I found was that while I didn&#39;t miss the &quot;twinking&quot; I<br/>\ndid<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with my other babies on The Rathe, what I DID miss were my friends and<br/>\nmy<br/>\n&gt; &gt; guild and all the things we did together.  (Can&#39;t live without green<br/>\n&gt; spam!!)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; So for me, going to another server isn&#39;t really an option right now.<br/>\nIt&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; really the people that keep me coming back to EQ, not just the game.  If<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; &gt; could bundle them all up and take them to Test, I would, but<br/>\n&gt; unfortunately,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it isn&#39;t gonna happen.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Mik<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Heather M.

No Spam, No crowding, and no<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; problems so far about finding stuff to hunt. We are still very young<br/>\nyet<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; though and it is fun having to work for all our stuff again.  On<br/>\nFennin<br/>\n&gt; We<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; could create newbie and give them things, but on test we can&#39;t &quot;twink&quot;<br/>\n&gt; so<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; feels just like it did when I started out on March 18th.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I made a cleric again, while my friends made classes that are<br/>\ndifferent<br/>\n&gt; &gt; form<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; what their high levels on Fennin are.  My thought are I have always<br/>\n&gt; liked<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; playign the cleric and well if we are gonna go anywhere on Test, you<br/>\n&gt; have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have a cleric so I am happy to repeat.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Just thought I would share that with everyone, I am having a blast<br/>\nonce<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; again =)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bree, 50th cleric of Fennin Ro<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Laurelei, 4th cleric of Test<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
