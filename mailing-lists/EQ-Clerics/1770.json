I am a bit<br/>\n&gt; disappointed.<br/>\n&gt; I noticed that divine barrier lasts for around 22 secs while divine aura<br/>\n&gt; lasts for some 20 secs. Divine barrier also restores some HPs, I was<br/>\n&gt; standing and noticed around 50 hit points regenerated.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But 100 mana!?! That is a lot of mana in an emergency. Can the<br/>\n&gt; rest of you<br/>\n&gt; clerics please give me advice. What do you prefer to use after level 29?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; // JS </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
