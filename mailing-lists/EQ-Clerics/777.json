A 12th level Wiz may be able<br/>\nto steal kill from a 15 level Magician  ALONE - BUT he cannot get off enough<br/>\nspells to make up for a group total nor would he have the mana to do such a<br/>\nthing blasting his high mana spells off.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur 4 person group on one round can do about 500 damage with spells not<br/>\ncounting pets and melee. No lone Wiz can compete with that unless he is<br/>\n*very* high level above us and that is usually not the case.  Usually the<br/>\nkill stealer wants to get off that one shot of a large damage spell  so they<br/>\nget the kill but take no risk.
