My","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-687168214\">Dan,<br/>\n<br/>\nOk...let me try to explain very very simply =)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you specialize in a skill, that is completely seperate from your normal <br/>\nskill, (EX. Alteration). My cleric isnt high enough to specialize, but I <br/>\nhave a level 25 magician who has specialized in both Conjuration and <br/>\nEvocation. I use Conjuration alot more, so I will let that one go past the <br/>\n50 mark. Once the SPECIALIZATION skill goes over 50, that ONE will be the <br/>\nskill you master at...the other skills that you specialize will be capped at <br/>\n50. That does not mean that your actual skill in Conjuration or any other <br/>\nskill will stop moving up. Look at Specialization as another skill entirely.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce you are able to specialize (I beleive you have to be level 30 to do <br/>\nthat as a Cleric) you will need to go to your guild trainer, and put ONE <br/>\npoint in whatever skill you want to specialize in. As a cleric, I will want <br/>\nto do Alteration, so I use less mana when I heal, cast faster, and with less <br/>\ninterruptions.  Once you have ONE POINT in there, it will go up as you play <br/>\nin EQ. You will see when it goes up with a message like, Your specialization <br/>\n(Conjuration) has increased! (25) or whatever you have in that skill. By the <br/>\ntime you are level 30, your skill in Alteration is already going to rock, <br/>\n(about 150 or so).  So, whatever skills you have, they will keep rising, the <br/>\nonly thing that will stop rising, is if you specialize in more than one <br/>\nskill, and one of them has gone over 50 skill. Everything will keep going <br/>\nup, until you hit 50 in specialize, and the one that went over 50 first, <br/>\nwill keep rising. (Phew, I hope I didnt confuzzle you more)<br/>\n<br/>\nSpecialization Alteration and Alteration are TWO different skills. Both will <br/>\nkeep going up =)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this clarifies it!<br/>\n<br/>\nLanadina<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: &quot;Dan Harmon&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:deharmon@...\">deharmon@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I must be missing a very basic piece of information or just suffering from<br/>\n&gt;brain fart.

Abjuration, alteration, evocation are AT LEAST at<br/>\n&gt;skill lvl 60, and probably divination and conjuration are pretty high as<br/>\n&gt;well.  How can that be explained?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I haven&#39;t noticed any better casting ability in any of my spells.  How can<br/>\n&gt;that be explained?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If I HAVE specialized, how can I tell which one it is?(they went over 50<br/>\n&gt;about 3 weeks ago...I don&#39;t have a clue which was first).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If I HAVEN&#39;T specialized, how do I do it?<br/>\n&gt;If I HAVEN&#39;T specialized, what happens to the other 2-4 spell classes that<br/>\n&gt;have already gone over 50?
