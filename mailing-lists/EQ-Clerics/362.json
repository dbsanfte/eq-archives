I on Lvl 16 get&#39;s lucky to do 76<br/>\n&gt;dmg to somethings with one cast of a spell.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That bit about the 100 pt damage spell is not quite correct. I have played a<br/>\nWizard, and at level 12 you get Shock of Lightning, which does damage in the<br/>\nlow 80&#39;s. You don&#39;t get a 100 pt damage spell until level 16. At levels 14<br/>\nand 15, clerics can actually do more damage to the undead (although not to<br/>\nother mobs) than a wizard.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople hate wizards because they can killsteal, but you know, it&#39;s like that<br/>\nold joke: Why do dogs lick their b***s? Answer: because they can.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Unrest, and other undead dungeons, clerics can killsteal, and a couple,<br/>\nincluding the notorious Soulbasher (may Brell curse his name and fizzle his<br/>\nspells!) do so regularly. We curse wizards because they commit sins...that<br/>\nwe are usually not capable of. But when we are capable, a few clerics will<br/>\nbe succumb to temptation and be killstealers as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s funny. I didn&#39;t killsteal as a wizard, but switched characters because<br/>\nof an impression that no one really wanted a wizard. As a cleric, I have a<br/>\nnew appreciation of wizards. My thing is healing, and having a wizard in my<br/>\nparty can vastly reduce the damage I have to heal, because the mobs get<br/>\ntaken down more quickly. Less downtime, less mana expenditure, safer fights<br/>\nagainst tougher mobs -- a better time is had by all. I really appreciate<br/>\nhaving a wizard in the party.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe whole killstealing thing is due to a very, very bad design decision by<br/>\nVerant. I.e., that a group&#39;s total damage is ignored in assigning credit for<br/>\nkills, and if an outside player has done more damage than any *single* group<br/>\nmember, then he gets credit for the kill. Brad posted a note about this<br/>\ndesign decision to the Vault message boards, that was reprinted widely on<br/>\nthe news pages. Verant seemed to feel that if a group&#39;s total damage was<br/>\ncounted, then groups would steal from individuals.<br/>\n<br/>\nDuh! Now we have exactly the opposite problem. And why, in a group-oriented<br/>\ngame, are we catering to the least ethical, most unsocial, nastiest solo<br/>\nplayers?<br/>\n<br/>\nI ran into a guy -- yes, a wizard -- named Odisius, in Unrest on Fennin Ro<br/>\nthe other night, who was soloing and killstealing from groups. He said he<br/>\nhad no real interest in playing the game, but was only trying to level to 20<br/>\nso he could sell the character/account on eBay.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the kind of person the current damage-assignment algorithm benfits.<br/>\nAaaccckkk! This is dumb, and make the game frustrating for those who really<br/>\nwant to play and enjoy it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am going to send Verant some screenshots of Odisius sceaming obscenities,<br/>\nand describe his behavior, along with a plea to rethink the kill-assignment<br/>\nalgorithm. Everyone should email Verant with the same request, talk it up on<br/>\nthe message boards and newsgroups, and maybe Verant change the code and end<br/>\nthis whole killstealing debacle.<br/>\n<br/>\n== Gilead, 19th level dwarven cleric on Fennin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
