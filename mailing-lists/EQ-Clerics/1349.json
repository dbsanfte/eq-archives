You will need friends to help you though.<br/>\n <br/>\nWhen the quest starts in Erudin, you (or a friend of yours if you have<br/>\nsomeone) will be given a book, with slots and a combine button.  You search<br/>\nfor the missing pages (or get a nice friend to help you) and put the pages<br/>\nin the book.   So, it appears that the Testament of Vanear is NOT formed<br/>\nuntil you combine the items in the book.  If you have a friend willing to<br/>\nget the items for you - a dark elf should in theory be able to get this no<br/>\ndrop quest item - just don&#39;t let your friend *combine* them.  You must do<br/>\nthat. (*note - the information I had did not say if the book or pages used<br/>\nto combine were no drop - if anyone knows that they are, please let me know)<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nI have not tried this myself - but I think I will :)  Hopefully it will<br/>\nwork!! <br/>\n <br/>\nSirensa Qi&#39;Seraph<br/>\nCleric of the 8th Circle<br/>\nSolusek Ro Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
