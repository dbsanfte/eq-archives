I personally like the random loot on the random spawn Idea, but<br/>\nthe  loot/poses an item once, and the min/max level cap on a  magic item are<br/>\nalso  possible ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason I feel &quot;First Come First Served&quot; isn&#39;t fair is  an experience I<br/>\nhad in Crush. I went to get the Crush Tunic. When I got to the tower 2  solo<br/>\nmages were camping.  I asked to join but they said they would rather solo,<br/>\nbut one offered to sell me the Tunic.  Soon after Emperor Crush spawned.<br/>\nThough  I tried to kill him, but the mages just blew him away. I then<br/>\nrealized I had no chance to get the item so I paid  the PP. Under the first<br/>\ncome first served rule I would have had to wait  hours till both left,<br/>\nformed a group capable of Killing Crush, then split the loot with my group.<br/>\nIn the mean Time hope the mage does not come back and KS<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Mystik &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mystik@...\">mystik@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, September 13, 1999 7:03 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] Yield Policy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Mystik &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mystik@...\">mystik@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; i didn&#39;t say that was right now did i? there are jerks everywhere you go, </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
