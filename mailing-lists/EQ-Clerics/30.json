Does it really<br/>\n&gt;help to see around you when your in the dark or is just in the immediate radius?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There is absolutely no use for such a spell as Halo of light IMHO. When you complete the Screaming Mace quest (Crushbone zone) you will probably have two items which both work as a halo of light. Both Screaming Mace and Shiny Brass Shield provide light to times when i travel in the dark. Don&#39;t spend any money on such a useless spell as Halo of light. But if you are not anywhere near Faydwer then if you absolutely must have some light for the dark times go for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor other lvl 14 spells i have Healing, Expulse Undead/Smite all the time memmed and Bind Affinity, Cancel Magic and Invis vs Undead are often memmed.<br/>\n<br/>\nIyenya - Lvl 17 Dwarf - Sons of Serilis<br/>\nInnoruuk server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
