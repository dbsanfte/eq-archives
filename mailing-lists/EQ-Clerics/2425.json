As you progress you<br/>\nare going on small quests and getting abundunce of<br/>\ncoin to gain levels, and few items.  As you progress<br/>\nto higher level the magic items are whats the most<br/>\nwanted.  Your sword can only be so good unless its<br/>\nmagical, the shield and armor is the same unless its<br/>\nmagical.  Everyone wants magic items, and cause you<br/>\nhave been adventuring so long, and are killing larger<br/>\ncreatures now you have an abundance of coin.<br/>\nItems can only be traded for itmes, cause coin is a<br/>\ncommon thing.  The way this can only be solved is that<br/>\nthe coin is used for something, to gain levels, its<br/>\nturned in for exp.  In EQ the coin is worthless in<br/>\nonly regards to buying items.  Maybe if it was used to<br/>\nbuy entertainment, or to buy house, estates, etc..<br/>\nthan it would be needed.  They must make coin valuable<br/>\nat all stages in level progression.<br/>\n<br/>\nLater<br/>\nChris<br/>\n<br/>\nDharkness<br/>\nCleric of Innouurk<br/>\nVallon Zek<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Jeff Portwine &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jdport@...\">jdport@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I didn&#39;t really camp until the last 5 levels or so<br/>\n&gt; when I started wanting some of the items that I was<br/>\n&gt; finally getting high enough level to get.   After a<br/>\n&gt; while you find that the higher level you get the<br/>\n&gt; less value platinum has and everything that you want<br/>\n&gt; to have is either A) No-Drop, B) costs just an<br/>\n&gt; outrageous amount of platinum (because plat is so<br/>\n&gt; easy to come by at high levels) or C) the person who<br/>\n&gt; has the item wants to trade it instead of selling it<br/>\n&gt; (again because plat isn&#39;t worth that much compared<br/>\n&gt; to the time spent getting items).   In the case of<br/>\n&gt; C, you need to camp to get the items that the person<br/>\n&gt; is willing to trade the item you want for... so you<br/>\n&gt; either camp for that or you camp for the item you<br/>\n&gt; actually want.. either way you are going to camp.  <br/>\n&gt; In the case of A, you have no choice because it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; No-Drop so nobody else can get it for you, and in<br/>\n&gt; the case of B.. well you will be saving your pennies<br/>\n&gt; a long long time.    So, I think that you will find<br/>\n&gt; yourself camping in levels to come and you will<br/>\n&gt; realize pretty quickly why people are complaining<br/>\n&gt; about it =)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -Eachann Bronzeleaf<br/>\n&gt; -Cleric of Tunare, Tarew Marr<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n&gt; From: Chris Wheeler &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wheelech@...\">wheelech@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, November 30, 1999 1:21 PM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [EQ-Clerics] Cleric Sit-in<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Chris Wheeler &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wheelech@...\">wheelech@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I hope you are all successful.  Personally, I am<br/>\n&gt; too impatient to camp for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; items, even if it it only takes an hour.  So if<br/>\n&gt; your protest helps in that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; regard, I am sure it will benfit me as well.  My<br/>\n&gt; approach is to just play<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the game, amass experience and wealth, and hope<br/>\n&gt; that I can buy what I need.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Mind you , I&#39;m only 16th level now, so in the<br/>\n&gt; future, I may need to camp for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; stuff.  But so far, I have not camped for a single<br/>\n&gt; thing, I am happy with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; what my character can and can&#39;t do, and have no<br/>\n&gt; complaints about world<br/>\n&gt; &gt; called Norrath. The only complaints I have I can<br/>\n&gt; live with, and they mostly<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have to do with the UI of the game and with GM<br/>\n&gt; conduct.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Jeff Portwine [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jdport@...\">jdport@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sent: 1999/11/30 11:43 AM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] Cleric Sit-in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Jeff Portwine&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jdport@...\">jdport@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Aye, but looking at it from your perspective you<br/>\n&gt; could consider that if the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sit-in is successful, it&#39;s possible that the 8<br/>\n&gt; hour camps could be reduced<br/>\n&gt; &gt; which would give you LESS time to sit around on<br/>\n&gt; purpose (camping for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; items)...  =)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; It all depends on how you look at it...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Eachann Bronzeleaf<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Cleric of Tunare, Tarew Marr<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Chris Wheeler &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wheelech@...\">wheelech@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Tuesday, November 30, 1999 11:39 AM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: RE: [EQ-Clerics] Cleric Sit-in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: Chris Wheeler &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wheelech@...\">wheelech@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, I&#39;m taking this sit in from a different<br/>\n&gt; perspective.

I do enough<br/>\n&gt; sitting around, what with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; trying to find a group and all to play in.
