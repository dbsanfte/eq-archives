This was caused by fighting with Mangler.  I killed him 3<br/>\nor<br/>\n&gt; 4 times as a young halfling, because he atacked me.  The 5th time I did<br/>\nit,<br/>\n&gt; I lost enough faction to con dubious, and hence, lose buying and selling<br/>\n&gt; privileges.  I was able to regain my faction by handing in 24 RE warbeads<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; the sheriff. That was level 9.  However, at level 11, I was again attacked<br/>\n&gt; by him, but he was killed by someone else. No matter, my faction bit the<br/>\n&gt; dust again.  Now, at level 13, almost 14, I have handed in 96 warbeads,<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; still con dubious to the merchants, and still can&#39;t buy nor sell (other<br/>\nthan<br/>\n&gt; to the druids).  My questions are this:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1) How many RE warbeads do I need to hand in?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 2) As I get higher in level, is it more required of me to regain faction?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The only reason this really matters is because I can&#39;t buy my spells from<br/>\n&gt; the cleric guild any more.  Otherwise, I wouldn&#39;t give a hoot.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Mike Schlagenhauf [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:trelane@...\">trelane@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: 1999/10/18 12:58 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] Testament of Vanear - SPOILER!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Mike Schlagenhauf&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:trelane@...\">trelane@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s actually an exact 7 hour spawn.
