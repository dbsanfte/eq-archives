First, we are","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1932201527\">I rarely cast offensive spells. Yes, it&#39;s fun. Yes, I am tempted to. Resist<br/>\nthat temptation!<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are many reasons not to cast offensive spells. First, we are only<br/>\nmediocre at them, except against the dead. If your group needs offensive<br/>\nspells, go to the source: get a wizard.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, they drain our mana for healing and buffing, which we are the very<br/>\nbest of any class at. Why hurt your most valuable ability? It&#39;s like a<br/>\nfighter discarding his sword. (If you really enjoy healing and buffing less<br/>\nthan fighting, or offense spell casting, then you don&#39;t want to be a cleric.<br/>\nDelete the character, and start a tank or a wizard.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThird, you DON&#39;T want to be the member of your group who does the most<br/>\ndamage. That just focuses the mob&#39;s attack onto you, and then you&#39;re really<br/>\nin trouble: all your spells, healing included, get disrupted, and you&#39;re<br/>\nprobably getting hurt worse than the tanks, who get better Defense and Dodge<br/>\nskills, have higher AC because of their higher Defense, and may even have<br/>\nbetter armor because they have not had to spend half their income on spells,<br/>\nas you have :-(. Now the tanks have to drag the mob off you, and they&#39;re not<br/>\ngetting healed. They won&#39;t appreciate you very much, and with good reason!<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, I do cast offensive spells occasionally. When I am soloing, which is<br/>\nmaybe 15 to 20 percent of the time. And when a critter is fleeing, the tanks<br/>\ncan&#39;t keep up with it, and it looks like it might be running into an area<br/>\nwhere it will bring other mobs into the battle. For example, an injured<br/>\nghoul running back into the house in Unrest, or a froglok running back into<br/>\nthe mazes of Guk. Uh-oh! Expulse Undead on that ghoul *now*, and Smite the<br/>\nfroglok, or you will have a mess of higher level mobs in your face. But<br/>\nthose are about the only times.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy play style: when the puller brings the mob, I jump in with the tanks and<br/>\nstart hitting. I do NOT cast. If the tanks are getting hurt, I pull back and<br/>\nheal. If *I* am getting hurt, I pull back and heal. I can do a lot more<br/>\ndamage to the mob by healing my tanks, than by any offensive spell I can<br/>\ncast. If no one is getting hurt, I keep on whacking at the mob.<br/>\n<br/>\nThink about it this way: If you spend the mana to heal a tank from, say half<br/>\nhealth to full, how much damage can he do in the time it takes the mob to<br/>\nknock him back to half health again? It&#39;s a LOT more than a cleric could<br/>\nhave done, if he had used the same amount of mana to cast an offensive<br/>\nspell. Although that damage was done by the tank, part of it belongs to you,<br/>\nbecause it would not have happened without you. That tank would have been<br/>\ndead or running. In my experience, virtually all tanks realize this, and are<br/>\ngrateful to their clerics. So what if your staff or your mace is doing a lot<br/>\nless damage than the tanks&#39; weapons, and connecting less often?<br/>\n<br/>\nEQ works best, and is the most fun, when every class does what it is best<br/>\nat. For us, that is healing and buffing. If you really want to cast<br/>\noffensive spells, be a wizard. If you want to bash, be a tank. Yes, I enjoy<br/>\nwhacking away with my runed totem staff, but that&#39;s not my real job. My real<br/>\njob is that of a healer and protector, and that&#39;s what I save my mana for. I<br/>\nget tremendous satisfaction out of knowing that at the end of the evening,<br/>\nwe were able to kill mobs a level or two higher than we would have if I had<br/>\nnot been present, and get better loot and better xp, and that no one died.<br/>\nThat&#39;s enough for me.<br/>\n<br/>\n== Gilead, 16th level Dwarven cleric on Fennin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Dawn Lamb &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dawn@...\">dawn@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Monday, June 28, 1999 11:38 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] Cleric Brawlers<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Dawn Lamb&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dawn@...\">dawn@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hi. I&#39;m new to this mail group but thought I would put in my 2cents here. I<br/>\n&gt;am a level 10 High Elf Cleric on the Rodcet Nife server. I regularly group<br/>\n&gt;with a Paladin and a Wizard. They know better than to tell me that my only<br/>\n&gt;job is to sit back and heal. I jump right in with them and watch their<br/>\n&gt;health rather intently. If I see that they need my services, I back out,<br/>\n&gt;heal them and then get right back in. I don&#39;t tank as the Paladin enjoys<br/>\n&gt;doing that herself. I will often times use that little strike spell to get<br/>\n&gt;the targets attention. My attack isn&#39;t all that great but at least I feel I<br/>\n&gt;contribute more than just an occasional healing spell or buff to the group.<br/>\n&gt;No one has complained yet.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Zoya<br/>\n&gt;10th level<br/>\n&gt; HE Cleric<br/>\n&gt; Rodcet Nife<br/>\n&gt;----------<br/>\n&gt;&gt;From: &quot;Squires, Dean&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:DeanSquires@...\">DeanSquires@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;To: &quot;&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&#39;&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Subject: [EQ-Clerics] Cleric Brawlers<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Date: Mon, Jun 28, 1999, 10:21 AM<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;From: &quot;Squires, Dean&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:DeanSquires@...\">DeanSquires@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Just wanted to open a discussion on Clerics who love to fight.  I am<br/>\n&gt;&gt;happy being a cleric, but I cannot resist jumping into the heat of a<br/>\n&gt;&gt;battle and kicking some back.  I also like to occassionally tank.  I try<br/>\n&gt;&gt;to save all my mana for healing, but sometimes I just love to blast<br/>\n&gt;&gt;away.  This is probably because I feel useless when grouped as my<br/>\n&gt;&gt;regular attack doesn&#39;t compare to others in the group.  Anyone else feel<br/>\n&gt;&gt;this way?
