I don&#39;t want to be spoiled, just nudged =)  The very first cleric <br/>\nquest where it is my duty to refresh the sentries of the Temple of Marr <br/>\nstill haunts me.  I went to the ocean of tears to search for the remaining <br/>\nsentry and retreated as I saw the island FULL of goblins.  I am not a bit <br/>\nhigher in level and decided to complete this quest.  Is she out there? or is <br/>\nthe quest broken?<br/>\n<br/>\nbtw: Sailing in the OOT, I went West (as I recall) and seemed to be headed <br/>\ntoward Kaladim, am I recalling wrong, or is something messed up besides me? <br/>\n=)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
