Arguing back and forth only<br/>\n&gt; clutters everyone&#39;s mailbox.  And because this mailing list does not<br/>\n&gt; exist in the land of Norrath, RP-ing here is merely a waste of time -<br/>\n&gt; when it is knowledge that should be shared here.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Second - I am level 34.  Anyone level 39 or higher have information on<br/>\n&gt; any additional DD spells that cleric will receive above wrath in damage<br/>\n&gt; amount that are NOT only for use on undead??  Specifically the amount<br/>\n&gt; of damage that any future spells will do. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks!! :) <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sirensa<br/>\n&gt; Cleric questing for knowledge... <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Bid and sell for free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://auctions.yahoo.com\">http://auctions.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ATTN ONELIST USERS: stay current on the latest activities,<br/>\n&gt; programs, & features at ONElist by joining our member newsletter at<br/>\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/newsletter4\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/newsletter4</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n===================================================<br/>\nSarah\t\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sarah@...\">sarah@...</a><br/>\n===================================================<br/>\nMy picture of the world is of masses of people extending gifts to other <br/>\npeople, doing favors -- but nobody keeping score. -- Dr. Whitsett<br/>\n=================================================== </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
