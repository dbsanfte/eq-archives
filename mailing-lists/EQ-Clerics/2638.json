Works best if it is still pissed<br/>\nat the rest of your group members.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother fun trick with atone is if you happen to fight a froglok shaman or<br/>\nother pet casting mob.  Once the master is dead, if everyone in the group is<br/>\nignoring the pet (ie - not attacking)  You can atone the pet and it will<br/>\nsuicide (usually).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only time I play with atone is when my group is not getting beat up<br/>\nhard.  More to &quot;play&quot; not to be more effective in combat. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n~Sirensa<br/>\nSolusek Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
