Just be sure you get one by<br/>\nitself, because others will come help.  And the loot is way better<br/>\nthan chessboard, anyway.

I&#39;m sure they would like having a cleric in their group.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, there are other suggestions, such as qeynos hills, or<br/>\nthe sewers, or blackburrow, or north ro, or west commons, or misty<br/>\nthicket... but since you are on Faydwar, try Steamfont.<br/>\n<br/>\nErgo Soulhealer<br/>\n20th level high elf cleric<br/>\ntest server<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Walt Zimbeck&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wzimbeck@...\">wzimbeck@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] Hey all<br/>\n&gt;Date: Fri, 12 Nov 1999 09:02:35 -0600<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I also seem to have this trouble finding a group even though I will heal<br/>\n&gt;anyone that I see hurt whether in combat or just resting.    I think it is<br/>\n&gt;mainly my level though on my part.  It seems to me that most people wish to<br/>\n&gt;solo yet at 10th - 12th level.   I am really getting very discouraged as I<br/>\n&gt;have been level 10 for weeks now.  It seems that every time I get a bar of<br/>\n&gt;exp I die a couple of times and lose it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I hunt normally either in ButcherBlock or around the entrance to CrushBone.<br/>\n&gt;It seems that BB is mostly deserted when I am around and there is nothing<br/>\n&gt;for me to hunt there.  I have hunted the Chess Board a couple of times when<br/>\n&gt;I was able to find a group.   The orcs around the CB entrance are either <br/>\n&gt;low<br/>\n&gt;green (no exp) or else there are 3 or more at once on me and that is death<br/>\n&gt;for sure.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Any suggestions would be appreciated.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;A very frustrated Cleric of Tunare<br/>\n&gt;Yilari<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Chrisstauf k&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chrisstauf@...\">chrisstauf@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; You know..I see these messages every no and then about cant find a group<br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; just cannot understand it. No matter where I have been I have always <br/>\n&gt;been<br/>\n&gt; &gt; welcomed into a group within a matter of minutes. Sometimes It would <br/>\n&gt;take<br/>\n&gt;a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; little work on my part. Such as casting buffs and heals on passer bys or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; what not. Here is the line that I use. &quot;Cleric of the X circle seeks <br/>\n&gt;group<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to heal in battle&quot;. seems to work great for me.

I was in High Hold going to East Co and had to go<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;through Kichlor Forest.  I almost died trying to get through.  I didnt<br/>\n&gt;know<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;they changed that area.  DAMN!!!!!!  Anyway....  The reason I decided <br/>\n&gt;to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;leave because I couldnt find a group in any of the places.  I still<br/>\n&gt;couldnt<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;believe noone wanted a cleric in their group.  Well I am level 25 and<br/>\n&gt;just<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;wondering where can I hunt?  The best places that a cleric will feel<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;welcomed,  and if you say unrest no way!!!!
