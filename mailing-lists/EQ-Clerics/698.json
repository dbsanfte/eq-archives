No way! Are you going to be extremely weak?<br/>\n&gt;You betcha!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Granted, it was a REALLY nice thing to be able to be resurrected and have<br/>\n&gt;your full mana and HP on your character, and being ready to go after you<br/>\n&gt;loot, but if EQ is about Roleplaying, and about trying to be semi-realistic<br/>\n&gt;in some cases, ressurect was not broken in the last patch, but instead, it<br/>\n&gt;was made to be a little more beleiveable/realistic.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Let the flames begin, just be gentle &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Lanadina<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;======<br/>\n&gt;From: Olli Haapam∩┐╜ki &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:olli.haapamaki@...\">olli.haapamaki@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I just did a revive on myself yesterday and was damn surprised to the<br/>\n&gt;result. Usually<br/>\n&gt;all it does is teleport to corpse and return a little xp. But at that time<br/>\n&gt;it did a whole<br/>\n&gt;lot more. And all of them were negative side effects. After resurrection i<br/>\n&gt;had all my<br/>\n&gt;mana drained, had only 50% of HP, had some kind of weakness effect on me <br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;all this without any addition to the positive effects (xp gain). I feel <br/>\n&gt;this<br/>\n&gt;is a terribly<br/>\n&gt;wrong move by Verant. And besides they did not mention a thing about it in<br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;patch message. Why the heck did they do something like this? Do they want <br/>\n&gt;to<br/>\n&gt;ruin the cleric now that it is perfectly balanced? That would be awfully<br/>\n&gt;stupid.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Iyenya Goldenheart<br/>\n&gt;Lvl 30 dwarf cleric<br/>\n&gt;Innoruuk server<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;You can WIN $100 to Amazon.com by starting a new list at ONElist.<br/>\n&gt;Drawing is held each week through August 20.
