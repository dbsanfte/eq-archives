Second off paladins and SK&#39;s have a<br/>\nmuch better selection of equipment. Third, smithing is not that difficult<br/>\nand I am GLAD that they are trying something different for a class that was<br/>\nalways wrought with powergamers looking for the next big ass sword of death.<br/>\nPaladins werre supposed to be good, well liked, and a reason why they got<br/>\nall those benefits. Not so they can kill gnomes or dwarves with impunity and<br/>\nnot worry about their &quot;goodness.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWithout a protest, there armors were changed, fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nLets review some other quests.<br/>\n<br/>\nA shaman comes over to Unrest, gets all three pieces he needs for these<br/>\nareas (2 unrest, 1 Dragnor&#39;s Cauldron) in one night. ALSO, these monsters<br/>\nand fighting groups are mostly of parity level so you can (GET THIS!!!)<br/>\nGroup AND get EXP!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nA Ranger&#39;s griffawn feather drops as easily as rain on the Karanas.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou look around and See Paladin, ShodowKnight, Bard, Ranger, Shamen, Mages,<br/>\nall with new gear. But you barely see ANY Cleric armor. (I finally saw one<br/>\nperson with cleric armor yesterday).<br/>\n<br/>\nNow lets look at a Cleric scenario...<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore Kith became a death zone (RULE #1: careful what you wish for, you<br/>\njust might get it) we all sat in the woods screaming for something to do.<br/>\nNow we got it. but you would have to be a psycopath to sit in the kith now<br/>\nfor 8+ hours EACH PIECE.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore no one would sit around with a cleric for 16 hours plus with no EXP<br/>\nand no money. So it is a solo sit match. I brought a book and read<br/>\n&quot;Stalingrad&quot; for a weekend. ANY game where you have to sit online just to<br/>\nburn time to &quot;hold&quot; a spot, is at the very least flawed.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow in Kith, you need a group 35-50 if you expect to live for the time<br/>\nneeded to do the quest.<br/>\n<br/>\nBILGE: Ah what a wonderful time for this MOB. No one will tell you where he<br/>\nis or help you, due to the fact that all druids (with tracking) and Shamen<br/>\nare also trying to kill him instantly for a shot at the belt or totem. AND<br/>\nhe spawns once a week. People usually get this item on a fluke, I know I<br/>\ndid.<br/>\n<br/>\nSludge: Easy enough but no one wants to take a cleric down to a green<br/>\nmonster to let you kill it.<br/>\n<br/>\nGULL: Ah, I love this lil guy. A 17 hour spawn that takes you an hour to get<br/>\nto where he is to find out, HE isn&#39;t there! JOY. &quot;Hey anyone want to travel<br/>\nwith me for an hour with no exp and barely any money just to see if Gull is<br/>\nthere?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nGuk: Sit in a room for seven hours, good thing you didn&#39;t attack any<br/>\nfroggies. What? You did? better come back after 30th....to sit. No exp and<br/>\nno coin.<br/>\n<br/>\nBabbinsbort: Pin the tail on the gnome! He is a rare 7 hour spawn which may<br/>\nor may not show up in the seven hours. FEAR not! just sit and wait for a few<br/>\ndays until he does, no exp and no coin, and good luck trying to find someone<br/>\nto sit around with you for no exp and no coin.<br/>\n<br/>\nSame goes for the Glacier Bear, Zahal, and Maugrim.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Cleric armor has the following flaws:<br/>\n<br/>\nTime consumption (Stump sit, MObs spawn very rare while in other zones other<br/>\nclasses mosters show every 5 minutes) with little or no reward, and no<br/>\nsocial interaction.<br/>\n<br/>\nWeak AC for a class that gets whalloped after the second heal.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeavy Weight for a weight conscious class.<br/>\n<br/>\nStat Add which add very little to our premium stat.<br/>\n(it is my belief that stats adds give the best boneses to 85 or 100, and<br/>\ntherefore having pieces which help all stats will actualy help MORE than<br/>\nhaving all have wis)<br/>\n<br/>\nI would be happy if any ONE of these things changes.<br/>\n<br/>\nJeff<br/>\nCadfael, EM</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
