I decided this would be a good place to put this, since everyone <br/>\n&gt;has<br/>\n&gt;good input on our class, while others refuse to help one another, I dunno.<br/>\n&gt;Basically I currently play on veeshan server, and for months have been fed <br/>\n&gt;up<br/>\n&gt;with it.  Now I&#39;ve heard other ppl say (and could be rumors) that there is <br/>\n&gt;less<br/>\n&gt;ks&#39;ing on other servers, as well as not a dominate god guild like foh on <br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;server.  (to Those of you possibly in FOH on this list, no offense, the <br/>\n&gt;group of<br/>\n&gt;friends I play with (UWS) as well as I have had bad run ins with your <br/>\n&gt;guild.<br/>\n&gt;Basically FoH and UWS has gone there...let&#39;s not do it again in here)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So basically my question to you is the server you play on how do you like <br/>\n&gt;it?<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m seriously considereing abandoning all my characters on Veeshan to play <br/>\n&gt;on a<br/>\n&gt;better server.  This game is all about the playability in the environment, <br/>\n&gt;which<br/>\n&gt;veeshan seriously limits those not powerhungry play the game.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Evertorn Soul<br/>\n&gt;Level 20 Erudite Cleric on Veeshan </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
