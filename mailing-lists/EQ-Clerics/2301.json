The following is a snip from the<br/>\nranger list.  I got an answer from that list as well, and this is what they<br/>\nhave to say about it =/<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;SNIP&gt;&lt;&lt;During the actual dark elf invasion, Enchanted weapons were dropped,<br/>\nas<br/>\nwell as a few really nice artifacts.  Then, after Innorukk cast the<br/>\nzonewide spell of instant death, the first wave of undead spawned and<br/>\nkilled those who were returning to their corpses.  For the first 2 real<br/>\nlife days, these undead dropped Tainted weapons.  The tainted were just<br/>\nas good as teh Enchanted in most cases except they were no drop and had<br/>\n-5 sv disease.  Then the GMs announced that the undead would not spawn<br/>\nin kithicor, at least for a while.  This was probably due to the fact<br/>\nthat the weapons were way too nice.  After another couple days the<br/>\nundead came back but only dropped Ruined weapons, and much more rarely.<br/>\nThe Ruined weapons have the same stat bonuses but much worse attack and<br/>\ndelays.  Im not sure if the undead have been changed again tho, as i<br/>\nhavent hunted there for a while.<br/>\nSnos&gt;&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
