I&#39;m<br/>\ntalking 115 str, 130 dex and 125 agi (and 85 sta), all wearable at the<br/>\nsame time. However, my wisdom would be only 105. <br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, I also have the opportunity to buy wisdom items that<br/>\nwould increase my wisdom by 35 points (to about 136). Which path should<br/>\nI follow? Some people argue that high level clerics CAN melee, while<br/>\nothers argue that at high levels, clerics should concentrate on their<br/>\nhealing and buffing skills. &quot;After all, if you wanted to be a warrior,<br/>\nyou should have been one.&quot; Yeah, yeah, heard that, been there. With the<br/>\nright equipment, though (Jboots, a flowing black sash of haste, an<br/>\nobserver&#39;s staff, etc.), a cleric should be able to hold his or her own<br/>\nin combat, even after level 35. <br/>\n<br/>\nAny suggestions, comments, advice before I commit to one group of items<br/>\nor the other?<br/>\n<br/>\nSaidinn Witchwood</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
