You<br/>\ncould do NOTHING or at least I could not. <br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe new patch I think just causes the &quot;visible&quot; area to go black. Not<br/>\nthe rest of the stuff... <br/>\n<br/>\n\tAs for the buff problem for cancel magic. If it really does cancel<br/>\nfrom the top down, then simply pad it. Cast a &quot;fake&quot; buff (something you don&#39;t<br/>\nwant or need to keep on like say fireshield or something) and then put all<br/>\nyour other buffs below that. Then when the fireshield wears off keep your<br/>\nother buffs refreshed. They will stay where they are and the new &quot;bad&quot; spell<br/>\nwill go in the top spot.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\tRichard<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\tRichard<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Kevin Dailey &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kevin_dailey@...\">kevin_dailey@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Flash of light is an awesome little tool, if it works. Its<br/>\n&gt; fast and uses little mana. He also has cure blindness and he would be<br/>\n&gt; stupid<br/>\n&gt; to not have it memorized. If he is a lower level it can last a<br/>\n&gt; reasonable<br/>\n&gt; time.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I was told by a friend who hunted in Runnyeye that Verant issued a patch<br/>\n&gt; that caused your ENTIRE screen to go black when you get blinded. I will<br/>\n&gt; have to try this on myself. Because if this is the case, then even<br/>\n&gt; though the troll shaman has me targeted, he will be unable to use his<br/>\n&gt; mouse to click his memorized spells. He WILL be able to cast spells IF<br/>\n&gt; he has hotkeyed them AND remembers which keyboard number goes to which<br/>\n&gt; spell....but I know for a fact that this shaman hasn&#39;t done that.<br/>\n&gt; So......It looks like I&#39;m going to be a Flash of Light caster on Sunday<br/>\n&gt; night at the PVP grounds in Neriak. Hmm....maybe I should first cast<br/>\n&gt; Invulnerability on myself to get him to waste his mana, then blast him<br/>\n&gt; with Flash of Light, and keep blasting him with it while I melee the<br/>\n&gt; crap out of him.....means that I&#39;m going to have to memorize extinguish<br/>\n&gt; fatigue as well, cause it&#39;s gonna take me FOREVER to melee him to death.<br/>\n&gt; And I should probably memorize Cancel magic in case he decides to root<br/>\n&gt; me....But someone said earlier that Cancel magic starts at the top of<br/>\n&gt; the stack. Why? That&#39;s where all MY buffs are! If I remember correctly<br/>\n&gt; (from Highpass and the gnoll shamans who cast root), I think Cancel<br/>\n&gt; magic starts at the bottom of the stack. Otherwise, it would be a<br/>\n&gt; worthless friggin spell, eh?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks for the suggestions so far...keep them coming...and let me know<br/>\n&gt; what you think of the Flash of Light strategy :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Saidinn<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ONElist announces &quot;FRIENDS & FAMILY!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; For details, including our weekly drawing, go to<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html\">http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
