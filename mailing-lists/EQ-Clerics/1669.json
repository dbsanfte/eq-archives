And there is no change of color, all the bars look like they<br/>\ndo at any other level.  Although I haven&#39;t died since I totally filled<br/>\nall my bars at level 50, I know others who have and if they continued to<br/>\ngain experience after filling them, they said they did not notice any<br/>\nloss of exp until they died several times.  So don&#39;t ask me WHERE the<br/>\nexp is going, but apparently it is increasing past that 5th bar since<br/>\nyou can die and not see any exp loss.<br/>\n<br/>\nMik</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
