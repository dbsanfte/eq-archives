The Ruins are pretty neat.  They had a 50th<br/>\nlevel GM Human Paladin with a fire sword of some type that did 35 dmg<br/>\nthat you could play with to walk around.  The new race is called the<br/>\nIksar, and they are lizard men.  The story behind the land is that<br/>\nthe dragons found out about it, or something, and there was a great<br/>\nwar, and now it&#39;s kind of a wasteland.  They&#39;ve done some nice things<br/>\ngraphically with it.  The trees sway in the breeze, and the are using<br/>\nmore polygons on the monsters.  This Hill Giant they had in it looked<br/>\nreally cool.  The guy showed how the shirt on the giant was a separate<br/>\npolygon and move separately from the body.  Kinda neat.  They had a<br/>\nrhino that looked really good (he said it was around 30th level) and<br/>\nan enourmous scorpion that was just huge.<br/>\n  I ended up taking over the controls after this kid left, and was<br/>\nwandering down a beach next to some cliff facings, and I found a<br/>\ncolumn just off the beach, in the water.  I swam out to it and found<br/>\na tunnel that led back to the shore underwater.  I swam into it and<br/>\nit was dark, and I couldn&#39;t see (human at night) and I thought, &quot;let&#39;s<br/>\njust see how invincible this character really is&quot;.  The guy was busy<br/>\ntalking, and needless to say, I drowned his 50th level character by<br/>\ntaking 1843 points of damage per gulp.  Funny.<br/>\n  The actual zone looks like a cross between Innothile Swamp and<br/>\nEast commons or something.  Kinda flat, kind green and dreary.  He<br/>\nmentioned that you could get to the land via Freeport.  Not sure<br/>\nexactly where the island is located.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Azor&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jmaynus@...\">jmaynus@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;For those dying for the upcoming expansion pak the bad news is, it won&#39;t be<br/>\n&gt;out before Christmas BUT March 16th, 2000.  On EQVault today they had a <br/>\n&gt;post<br/>\n&gt;from a guy that went to Gen-Con and he said it wouldn&#39;t be out till<br/>\n&gt;3-16-2000.<br/>\n&gt;Speaking of the pak many ppl keep saying they are adding more lvls for us,<br/>\n&gt;Brad himself has stated before they didn&#39;t know if we would be getting more<br/>\n&gt;lvls.  He said they saw no real reason to give us more lvls.  A bit later <br/>\n&gt;he<br/>\n&gt;said something about if they did it might be from Lvl 50-60.  I think 50 is<br/>\n&gt;cool for now but if they do give us more I think it should be at least 75.<br/>\n&gt;As I was writing this I read more on EQVault they guy said Verant is<br/>\n&gt;thinking of raising the lvl cap to 55 or so.  Gee a whole 5 lvls!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;**************************<br/>\n&gt;Azor<br/>\n&gt;Lvl 18 Human Cleric of the Rathe<br/>\n&gt;**************************<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;You can WIN $100 to Amazon.com!<br/>\n&gt;If you join ONElist∩┐╜s FRIENDS & FAMILY program.
