Lag in the game can be defined by 2<br/>\nthings.....both effecting your speed:  a)  data rate to you for varying<br/>\nobjects anf their placement (eg - corpses, monsters etc)  <br/>\nb)  Your system&#39;s speed and ability to deal with the &quot;pre-defined&quot; images<br/>\nyou have.  Example:  3dfx is fill limited to like 1833 textures (some ODD<br/>\nnumber like that)  when more than that is there....your system goes NUTS<br/>\nswapping in and out....  as it is....if more than 20 people and monsters are<br/>\non your screen....fighting....casting spells etc...your system is gonna go<br/>\nnuts trying to keep up.  and it does.  You get sometimes 1-2 fps (frames per<br/>\nsecond) which appears to be lag.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBann<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Curtis Bennett [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:die_kluge@...\">die_kluge@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, September 28, 1999 4:35 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [EQ-Clerics] lag (was: rez changed)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Curtis Bennett&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:die_kluge@...\">die_kluge@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThese things don&#39;t increase lag.  Think about it.  The game world is<br/>\ncompletely pre-defined.  The server doesn&#39;t send you any information<br/>\nabout what the trees, buildings or scenery looks like.  All the<br/>\nserver sends is information about what the monsters are doing, what<br/>\nthe people are doing, any messages, and if there are any corpses or<br/>\nequipment laying on the ground anywhere.  That is, things that are<br/>\nnot part of the static world.  You have a CD, that CD stores the<br/>\npre-defined world.<br/>\n  I could see where corpses would increase lag because that<br/>\ninformation would need to be sent to you.  A lot of people in a zone,<br/>\nand a lot of monsters running aggro.  All these things would do it.<br/>\nFaydark does not take longer to load than North Ro.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Sean O&#39;Brien&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sobrien@...\">sobrien@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: &quot;Sean O&#39;Brien&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sobrien@...\">sobrien@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Of course they increase lag.<br/>\n&gt;A higher Polygon count and texture count, means slowwer redraw more<br/>\n&gt;texture and memory swapping.
