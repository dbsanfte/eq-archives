I even got boots out of the deal.(granted <br/>\nefreeti boots are better, but I was wearing charred, so they are better than <br/>\nwhat I had)  The game has gotten kind of boring as of late and the plane of <br/>\nfear adds a new and exciting twist to my playtime, I can&#39;t wait to go back <br/>\nthis weekend again.(no wonder I am still level 47, hehe)<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess from my standpoint I can either, try and complete these quests which <br/>\ngets me no experience at all, with no idea of what I will recieve OR I can <br/>\nget XP in Lguk or SolB all week long, so I have a nice buffer for going to <br/>\nfear on the weekends and potential for getting armor that I already know is <br/>\nWhoop daddy.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my thoughts once again,<br/>\n<br/>\nBree Wyndsdale</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
