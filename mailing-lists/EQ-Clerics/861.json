One in particular was extremely well done. The GM<br/>\nspawned a powerful giant rat in a newbie zone. The fun started once the<br/>\nplayers realized what was going on. There were enough experienced<br/>\nplayers starting new characters that a plan was formed rather quickly.<br/>\nSeveral groups formed under these players and then a simulaneous attack<br/>\noccured. It was a tremendous amount of fun for the &quot;new&quot; players as<br/>\nwell as the more experienced players. There weren&#39;t any characters<br/>\ninvloved that were higher then 8 I believe. The GM actually broadcast a<br/>\nmessage congratulating all and naming several that went above and<br/>\nbeyond in their attempt to role play. He even rewarded me(level 5) with<br/>\na nice bracer for the way I circled the fight and healed key members of<br/>\nthe three groups. He said something like &quot;for showing others by example<br/>\nwhat a cleric is supposed to be.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, the point of all that rambling was how much I think this adds to<br/>\nthe game. <br/>\n<br/>\n1. You have an intelligent opponent without having to be PvP.<br/>\n2. Tremendous opportunity for role-play.<br/>\n3. Fun for game-knowledgable as well as newbies.<br/>\n4. I would much rather obtain items in this way, then pitching a tent<br/>\nin Najena for 17 hours straight.<br/>\n5. No EXP is lost by a death from a NPC controlled by a GM.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know this is not exactly cleric specific, but since the last episode<br/>\nhappened to a cleric and I like this list...<br/>\n<br/>\nAny thoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\nTrizzen 5th circle priestess of light<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nBid and sell for free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://auctions.yahoo.com\">http://auctions.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
