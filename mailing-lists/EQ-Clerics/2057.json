I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m hunting in the right place.  It&#39;s in<br/>\nthe room next to the DE SK  (the left DE SK if you are facing as if you<br/>\nhave just come through the wooden door opposite the hidden wall in the<br/>\ncorridor) This spawn only spawns 3 times a day or so anyway so it&#39;s<br/>\nsommat special.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there anything else I should be doing to trigger his spawn or am I<br/>\njust being very unlucky and who ever gets the other spawn each day is<br/>\ngetting Babbinsbort?  Did people clear out the level just before he  was<br/>\nsupposed to spawn? clear out the room? kill Gynok? kill Cmdr<br/>\nWindstream?  any ideas on triggers people cos this is driving me mad. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd why are all our quests in zones where there is nothing else close to<br/>\nour level to hunt.. I wouldn&#39;t mind camping stuff if we could at least<br/>\nget xp while we were doing it.. oh well.. this is turning out to be more<br/>\nof a pain than the paw of opella was..<br/>\n<br/>\nVinamin<br/>\nSon of Innoruuk<br/>\nPriest of The Lady<br/>\nErollisi Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
