Anyways, my point is for the most part EQ runs fine with just about any<br/>\ncard, it&#39;s just when you enter a highly packed framerate death zone like<br/>\ncazic or unrest (on the rathe at least), your choice of video card means<br/>\nvery little - as most of the time it&#39;s your CPU that&#39;s struggling to keep<br/>\nup.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Hey, now, I use two Voodoo2 cards in SLI mode, and I am a<br/>\n&gt;smoothly-running happy camper at 1024x768. My AGP card is a measly<br/>\n&gt;Matrox G200 (just for fun, I tried running EQ using only THAT card at<br/>\n&gt;1024x768. While the color was astonishingly improved, I could barely<br/>\n&gt;move. :))<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;Anyway, just for the record, i&#39;m running a 450Mhz K6-III, 256Mb of<br/>\n&gt;SDRAM, have a very fast UltraDMA Fujitsu HD, and a nice fat 21&quot;<br/>\n&gt;Viewsonic P815 monitor to watch all the action :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>    Hehe, because of a non disclosure agreement with Intel and NVidia, I<br/>\ncan&#39;t disclose any information about the machine sitting on my desk in front<br/>\nof me now :^)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nNick Shaffner<br/>\nProgrammer: Duke Nukem Forever<br/>\n3D Realms</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
