Enchanters can make these<br/>\nwhen their jewelry skill is still fairly low.  I had a 13th level<br/>\nenchanter friend make me some.  They will cost you 4 platinum apiece.<br/>\nIf you want +2 wisdom earrings, those will run you 25 plat apiece and<br/>\nwill require a much more skilled enchanter.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Chris Wheeler &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wheelech@...\">wheelech@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hi all,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I am a level 10 halfling cleric of Bristlebane, Brytewing on the Rathe<br/>\n&gt;server.  I have spent my life in Rivervale, Misty Thicket, and am now<br/>\n&gt;venturing into RunneyEye with small groups.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My question is this:  I have heard alot of talk about wisdom increaing<br/>\n&gt;items.  However, I have yet to see any in my gameplaying experiences.  <br/>\n&gt;Could<br/>\n&gt;some of you more experienced players give me a hint as to what items<br/>\n&gt;increase wisdom, and perhaps where I could best find them?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Many thanks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;ATTENTION ONElist MEMBERS!
