At 255 you should be able to heal 63 or 64<br/>\npoints with one bandage. How does that compare with meditation and healing<br/>\nspells? Maybe not for combat but for post combat recovery?<br/>\n-aj<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: FlashD &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:DunleyG@...\">DunleyG@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, September 03, 1999 11:28 AM<br/>\nSubject: [EQ-Clerics] Interview with Geoffrey Zatkin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;FlashD&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:DunleyG@...\">DunleyG@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well Looks Like The Cleric Petition was answered, with a big &quot;NO&quot;.
