Dwarves probably have the best stats for a cleric, but being a<br/>\ndwarf on the racewar server will be a hard road, because you are teamed<br/>\nwith the gnomes and halflings.  Poor bastards.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for what humanoid race to pick, it TOTALLY depends on your<br/>\npersonality.  Are you happy with sitting back and healing (Erudite) like<br/>\na pure cleric, or would you rather tank a bit and smash some face<br/>\n(human), a fighting cleric.  Your choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nBaelstorm<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\tI Don&#39;t Need a Shrink to Tell Me What to Think<br/>\n&gt; [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:douglas@...\">douglas@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tWednesday, July 14, 1999 4:03 PM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject:\tRe: [EQ-Clerics] Starting a New Cleric Suggestions<br/>\n&gt; Please <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;I Don&#39;t Need a Shrink to Tell Me What to Think&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:douglas@...\">douglas@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Wed, 14 Jul 1999, Chas Watkins wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; The Erudite has more Wisdom <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Str  Sta  Ag   Dx   W    Int  Ch             <br/>\n&gt; &gt; 65   75   70   70   93   105  70  +30<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Bah!
