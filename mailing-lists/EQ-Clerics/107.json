I found one Pearl of Odus, and gave that to the cobbler in qeynos in return for the treant shards.  Now what I can&#39;t find, is another Pearl of Odus. I&#39;ve been swimming in the harbour looking for another for about a week now, getting killed by all the sharks, and I have yet to find another Pearl.  Does anyone know where the main spawn points for these pearls are?  Im getting sick of swimming underwater for this.  Is it even worth it?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
