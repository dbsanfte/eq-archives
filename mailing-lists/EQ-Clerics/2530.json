While Inspire Fear can be cast at a much greater<br/>\ndistance on a single target. Just depends on what you want to do. Other than<br/>\nthat the only difference is 10 mana points.

I figured wave of fear<br/>\n&gt; would be really, really handy, but instill fear was kind of worthless<br/>\n&gt; compared to it, if I understand them correctly.
