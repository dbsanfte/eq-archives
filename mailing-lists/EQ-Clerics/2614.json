If you would<br/>\nlike to know all the details, read on. Warning: it&#39;s kinda long...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n***Spoiler***<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a hidden quest given by Gavel in the Temple of Solusek Ro. If you<br/>\nhail him and say &quot;What of Sacrament&quot;, he says that the Ingot and Icon are<br/>\nmerely legend! He also says that if you could bring him both Ingot, Icon and<br/>\n2 magnetized platinum bars, that he could forge something very special:<br/>\n<br/>\nIngot of the Sacrament:<br/>\nGo to the Rathe Mountains and find the Undead Ruins. To get there, as you<br/>\nzone in from the Feerrott, take a left at the first 4-way intersection you<br/>\ncome to. Keep the mountain wall on your left and you will eventually come<br/>\nupon a gold tower with undead, this is NOT the spawn. Keep going until you<br/>\nsee what looks like a druid teleport spot (ruins) with undead; this is it.<br/>\nHere spawn the giant undead skeletons. You are looking for the rare spawn<br/>\nthat looks like a giant dread bone skel (dark brownish-red in color). He is<br/>\na low 30th lvl mob and will be quite tough to solo. I, a 34th Cleric, and a<br/>\n27th Rogue took him easily. We even had another normal giant skel wacking on<br/>\nus, so a group of 3 or so at 30 should do. Also, these guys drop &quot;A skeletal<br/>\nfinger&quot;, which is a Necro quest for Shadowbound armor. You could use this to<br/>\nattract the company of a necromancer to aid you in destroying the spawn.<br/>\n<br/>\nIcon of the Sacrament:<br/>\nTo get the Icon you must travel to Mistmoore. At the back of the Graveyard<br/>\nthere is a secret wall (back left, facing the graveyard). Pass through and<br/>\nyou will be in a small, square room. There is yet another secret wall<br/>\nimmediately to your right as you enter. Go through and you will find<br/>\nyourself in a room with 4 doors. The only door that can be opened is the one<br/>\nyou are facing as you enter. But be warned, opening the door causes the<br/>\nother 3 to open. And unless there is a party camping there, there will be a<br/>\nnasty creature behind each. There is only 1 wall with 2 doors. The Icon is<br/>\nbehind the left door of this wall. It is lying on the ground and looks like<br/>\na voodoo doll. Also, this is a 6-hour spawn. I like to call this one my<br/>\n&quot;12pp solution&quot;. Why? Because that&#39;s how much a potion of invisibility costs<br/>\n=) I traveled to Mistmoore and asked if there was a party in the graveyard,<br/>\nand there was. I asked if they had been killing the things in the secret<br/>\nroom, they had been. I asked if they had picked up the doll behind the door<br/>\nand they told me they had done so about 2 hours before. So....I just logged<br/>\nand came back 4 hours later, which happened to be around 6:00AM. This worked<br/>\nout great because nobody was in-zone at that time. Drank my invisibility<br/>\npotion, strolled in, opened the door, picked it up and got the heck out.<br/>\n<br/>\nMagnetized Platinum Bars:<br/>\nPurchase 2 regular Platinum Bars from a Jewelry shop or from an Enchanter<br/>\n(hint: create an Enchanter and dump all points into CHA and check the<br/>\nprices). Take these to Ostorm in the Temple of Solusek Ro (he will be<br/>\nupstairs through several doors on the right side of the Temple). Give Ostorm<br/>\n1 bar at a time and he will return it to your inventory as a Magnetized<br/>\nPlatinum Bar.<br/>\n<br/>\nGive Gavel the Ingot, Icon and both Magnetized bars (I separated the bars)<br/>\nand he will give you your reward:<br/>\n<br/>\nCaduceus of the Sacrament<br/>\nMagic Lore No Drop<br/>\nWeight: 8.0<br/>\nType: 1HB Dmg: 12 Del: 32<br/>\nCleric only<br/>\n<br/>\nI constantly hit for 28&#39;s with this thing (89 STR). When I cast Frenzied<br/>\nStrength and Yaulp II, I get some in the low 30&#39;s. Truly awesome weapon that<br/>\nis relatively easy to get.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood Luck!<br/>\n<br/>\nDrizben D&#39;Vorn<br/>\nDefiled High Priest of Innoruuk<br/>\nOblivion Knight of the 34th Circle</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
