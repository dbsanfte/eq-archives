Usually<br/>\nall it does is teleport to corpse and return a little xp. But at that time it did a whole<br/>\nlot more. And all of them were negative side effects. After resurrection i had all my<br/>\nmana drained, had only 50% of HP, had some kind of weakness effect on me and<br/>\nall this without any addition to the positive effects (xp gain). I feel this is a terribly<br/>\nwrong move by Verant. And besides they did not mention a thing about it in the<br/>\npatch message. Why the heck did they do something like this? Do they want to<br/>\nruin the cleric now that it is perfectly balanced? That would be awfully stupid.<br/>\n<br/>\nIyenya Goldenheart<br/>\nLvl 30 dwarf cleric<br/>\nInnoruuk server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
