I just made 13th Sunday, in fact, and as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with last few level increases, it&#39;s become a habit of mine to spend a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; little time to max all my skills with each level increase.  I&#39;ve been<br/>\n&gt; &gt; keeping them all written down, and when a skill increases, I write the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; new number down, marking out the previous one.  I know what each of my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; skill levels are (except for beg, which I haven&#39;t used since 5th lvl).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve heard that, for clerics, magic skills raise 5 points per level,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and combat skills raise 4.  This seems to be at least somewhat<br/>\n&gt; &gt; accurate.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; At 12th, my skills were maxed (for the most part).  I had maxed<br/>\n&gt; &gt; alteration (heal school) at 65, and defense and offense at 60.  So,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; when I went to 13th, my skills all started raising.  So I spent some<br/>\n&gt; &gt; time just casting, swimming, sense-headng, etc, to raise them all to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 70.  I assume that defense, and offense will now to go 64.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; But I have two question, are there initial points?  Because 70 (my max<br/>\n&gt; &gt; score for my magic skills) / 13 (my level) is not 5.  5*13 is 65.  So<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is it that at first level you have 10 points, and then it&#39;s 5 every<br/>\n&gt; &gt; level after that?  And what about the combat skills?  4*13 is 52.  So<br/>\n&gt; &gt; could it be that, since the max for these skills, at this level is 64<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that I start with 12 points in these areas?  Or, at least, a max of 12<br/>\n&gt; &gt; potential points at level 1?  The numbers aren&#39;t adding up.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Also, If my magic skills continue at the same rate, and my assumption<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is that 200 is the max for a skill, I will max my magic skills at<br/>\n&gt; &gt; around level 39 or so.  What then?  Is this where the specialization<br/>\n&gt; &gt; skills come in?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Also, one other question while I have your attention, I went to a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; language fair recently and picked up a few additional languages.  Is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; there a way to increase those skills without going to another language<br/>\n&gt; &gt; fair and without pumping training points into them?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ATTENTION ONElist MEMBERS:  Get your ONElist news!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Join our MEMBER NEWSLETTER here:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/newsletter3\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/newsletter3</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Congratulations GENEVINCENT.
