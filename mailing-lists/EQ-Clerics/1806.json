He gives you the book..<br/>\n&gt; then do the 4gp gamble thing to get the jester card.  Then give jester<br/>\n&gt; card to Moodoro to get page.  Then go to HP and kill Dynil and get the<br/>\n&gt; other page. Stick both pages in book and hit combine.  No need to go to<br/>\n&gt; Erudin at all..<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You will need to not be KOS in Qeynos and HP of course but that is<br/>\n&gt; reasonably easy to achieve and you should be aiming for it anyway in my<br/>\n&gt; opinion since DEs have so much hassle selling/banking as it is.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Vinamin<br/>\n&gt; Son of Innoruuk<br/>\n&gt; Priest of The Lady<br/>\n&gt; Erollisi Marr<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Curtis Bennett wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Curtis Bennett&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:die_kluge@...\">die_kluge@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Talk to Rarnan Lapice on the top floor of the temple of divine light<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in Erudin.  This starts the quest.. I haven&#39;t done this part yet, but<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve read about it.  Apparently you have to talk to several people and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; one of them will eventually sell you the book for 2 gold.  The book is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a 2-slot inventory item.  There are two pages missing.  One of them is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; on a guy named Dylin Fireshine in HHpass.  He conned low blue to me at<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 17th.  I had a friend help me kill him, because the smugglers that are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; near him help out when you attack.  You can find him by swimming in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the lake and going into the small hole underwater.  You can find<br/>\n&gt; &gt; dylin up there under a little tent.  When you kill him you get 2<br/>\n&gt; &gt; things, page 30 to the book, and a letter which is part of another<br/>\n&gt; &gt; quest in Freeport.  After you kill him, the best qet-away tactic is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to leap off the edge up the small ramp in front of him, and zone into<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the keep.  The second page is in North Qeynos from a guy named<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Moodoro Finharn.  He hangs out in Crows bar.  I am KOS to everyone in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Crows bar, save for Moodoro, who is apprehensive, and blue to me at<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 18th.  If this is so, you can hail Moodoro and say &quot;I want page 34.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; He will gamble with you to give you the page.  For every 4 gold you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; give him, he will give you a random card.  If you get the joker card,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; turn around and give him the joker card back, and he will give you the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; page.  I have heard that some people spent as much as 20 plat to get<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the card.  I just got it last night and it cost me 20 gold (5 tries).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Go to the bank, and withdraw about 20 plat in gold to be safe.  :)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I have the two pages, I just need to get the book now, and will get it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; this week.  And I am 18th level, too.  You could effectively do this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; quest at around 15th or so level, but you would need a group to help<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you kill Dylin, as he is at least around that level.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; As a side note, a dark elf cleric should be able to do this.  You can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; exit the sewers and play cards with Moodoro IF he is outside Crows.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; For the most part there are no guards around.  Getting the actual book<br/>\n&gt; &gt; itself would be tricky without since the Erudites are probably KOS to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you.  Although, if you sneak past and kill tons of Kerrans, you can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; probably raise faction enough to pull it off.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;From: &quot;Chrisstauf k&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chrisstauf@...\">chrisstauf@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Subject: [EQ-Clerics] Testament of Vinear<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Date: Wed, 13 Oct 1999 09:58:41 MST<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;I am looking for some information regarding this +10 wis/mana book<br/>\nquest.
