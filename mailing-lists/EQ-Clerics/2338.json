Is there anyone on Erollisi Marr?<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain I wish to thank all for the help I have gotten from this list.   After<br/>\nweeks of frustration in trying to make 11 in and around CB Yilari moved to<br/>\nFreeport temporarily.    Well today she made 12 and has a lot of fun killing<br/>\norcs in EC and dervs in N. Ro.  She has also had fun with the zombies and<br/>\nmummies at the ruins in EC and the occasional wisp that comes along.  No<br/>\nluck finding a GSL though yet.  Her only bad experience came when she was<br/>\ntalked into venturing down into Oasis.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also understand what you all have been saying about being helpful and<br/>\npeople will notice.  Yilari has ran all over EC healing and curing disease<br/>\netc when people call out for aid.  Today someone came up to her and gave her<br/>\na chain tunic.   Now she is looking to either give away or sell her leather<br/>\none.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am wondering about weapons now.   She currently uses either cracked staff<br/>\nor summoned hammer.  She cannot afford one of the really nice weapons yet<br/>\nbut what should she be looking for?   Remember that she barely has 11pp in<br/>\nthe bank and has to be able to afford 14th level spells soon also.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks all,<br/>\nYilari, High Elven Cleric of Tunare, Erollsi Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Sianne .&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:maggee1@...\">maggee1@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; How many ppl do we have out there on the Xegony Server??...would be nice<br/>\n </span></blockquote>to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; get together and kinda help each other out...occasionally...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sianne  28th<br/>\n&gt; Xegony<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
