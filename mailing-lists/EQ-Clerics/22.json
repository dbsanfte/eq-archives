I played an Elven<br/>\n&gt;Cleric up to level 11.  I stopped because I was having problems raising my<br/>\n&gt;two-handed blunt up from 0.  I started a Dwarven Cleric and have seen the<br/>\n&gt;difference.  I can solo pretty good and I can definitely back a fighter if<br/>\n&gt;needed.  The problem with my first character was that I didn&#39;t have the<br/>\n&gt;strength to do the damage and carry the gear that my Dwarf can.  So I guess<br/>\n&gt;you kind of have to make the choice to be a back up fighter in the<br/>\n&gt;beginning.
