I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-236890173\">It&#39;s been my experience that the majority of all mob attacks on a<br/>\ncleric (due to them healing) can be avoided.  Just dont be too quick with<br/>\nthrowing a heal.  I never heal anyone in my party if they  have taken<br/>\nlessthan 2 bubs of damage. Depending on what is attacking them I typically<br/>\nwait till they have taken 3 bubs of damage.        This doesn&#39;t apply to<br/>\nwizards,  I always heal them almost as soon as they start to drop.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the puller is running back to the group and will need a heal as soon as<br/>\nthey are in range, I always tell my party to get ready to clear me,<br/>\nhealing someone right as the party starts to engage a mob is almost always<br/>\nguaranteed to get you attacked.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI always said clerics had the best taunt in the game....:)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">  On Tue, 16 Nov 1999, Rose wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Rose&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rliu@...\">rliu@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; can&#39;t or doesn&#39;t do it in time.  I play with a good friend so<br/>\n&gt; &gt; when I asked him about this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; he says that he is taunting the mob constantly, but it won&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; leave me.  So, don&#39;t just assume<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the warrior isn&#39;t doing HIS job.  It seems the Mobs will stick<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with a healer until he&#39;s dead<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sometimes.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Aye.  For those of you who has never play a tank, FYI taunt isn&#39;t worth a<br/>\n&gt; crap around low 20s and below.  What I am telling you guys is to always have<br/>\n&gt; another escape/survival plan if the tanks are unable to pull the mobs off.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you play with a ranger, ask the ranger to snare or root (snare is better<br/>\n&gt; though) the mob.  Those spells works as good as taunt...if not better.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; BTW once u are at 2 bubbles of health...it is close to impossible for anyone<br/>\n&gt; to pull those mobs off.  If you ever get that low on health, and the mob is<br/>\n&gt; still at full health or there are still more then one mob standing...just<br/>\n&gt; cast divine aura and run towards the zone.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -Imogen<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
