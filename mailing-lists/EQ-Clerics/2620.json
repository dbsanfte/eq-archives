I was thinking Unrest, but I have so many bad memories of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;such bad trains there.  Seems like Runnyeye might be good, but not too<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I found that unrest was very good for me up until about 26... at which <br/>\n&gt;point<br/>\n&gt;I went to Cazic until I was around 32 or so...  If Cazic is boring then you<br/>\n&gt;are doing somethin wrong because there is usually a LOT of action there...<br/>\n&gt;sometimes too much =)   I certainly don&#39;t think it&#39;s any more boring than<br/>\n&gt;any other zone.   Unrest trains can be bad, but<br/>\n&gt;the best way to level there is to join a group in a room in a house and <br/>\n&gt;once<br/>\n&gt;you are settled in a room (I leveled up to 26 fairly quickly in the hand<br/>\n&gt;room) there are usually no trains.  Every zone is bad with trains if you <br/>\n&gt;try<br/>\n&gt;to fight in the first open area you come to near the zone.  Also, when you<br/>\n&gt;get in high 20&#39;s, low 30&#39;s I know a GREAT place to level.  I almost hate to<br/>\n&gt;say anything for fear of a terrific (if a little boring) spot geting over<br/>\n&gt;crowded... but the icy orc camp in everfrost is a very safe place to group<br/>\n&gt;with excellent xp.  I didn&#39;t find this place until level 33 and leveld to <br/>\n&gt;35<br/>\n&gt;in 2 days there.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  Paw and Mistmoore are still too high/tough.  I heard Sol A might be<br/>\n&gt; &gt;good, but I&#39;ve never been to Lavastorm, and worry about falling into<br/>\n&gt; &gt;lava as I&#39;ve heard you&#39;re oft to do when zoning into the place.  Maybe<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Paw and MM are too tough as you said... Sol A is ok if you get a good <br/>\n&gt;group,<br/>\n&gt;but I&#39;d get a couple more levels first.  As for zoning into lava, i&#39;ve <br/>\n&gt;never<br/>\n&gt;heard that nor have I ever seen that... the lava is no where near the zone<br/>\n&gt;of nektulos/lavastorm... (though there is a huge pit right out side the <br/>\n&gt;zone<br/>\n&gt;to Sol A and Sol B)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the giant skels in Rathe mountains?  Maybe pickclaws in highkeep?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;pickclaws are very good at your level, but that area tends to be HORRIBLY<br/>\n&gt;crowded (at least on my server) and you are very lucky if you can even get<br/>\n&gt;in a group there.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-Eachann Bronzeleaf<br/>\n&gt;-35th cleric of Tunare, Tarew Marr<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&lt;&lt; text3.html &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
