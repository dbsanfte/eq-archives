You are asking the majority of clerics (over 3k<br/>\nin people, I&#39;m am guessing) to not do this because<br/>\nmaybe 20 people on the Fenn Ro server want to hunt in<br/>\nthe planes on that day?...it is not happening.<br/>\n<br/>\n--- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:BROWNCA9@...\">BROWNCA9@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:BROWNCA9@...\">BROWNCA9@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Read this and reconsider the sit-in! <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Greebo (Stratics Moderator) said:<br/>\n&gt; -----<br/>\n&gt; I have a very old friend who contributes to the<br/>\n&gt; Guide program. Naturally, I<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t say who, but in the interest of preventing a<br/>\n&gt; similar fiasco as with<br/>\n&gt; the Monk sit-in, I will confirm that players in<br/>\n&gt; Fenin&#39;s Fear Plane were<br/>\n&gt; lagged out due to over-loading network resources on<br/>\n&gt; the server which houses<br/>\n&gt; both Fear and West Freeport.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The server didn&#39;t crash, the network resources were<br/>\n&gt; overloaded, and so<br/>\n&gt; people lagged out, leaving the Fear Plane with a<br/>\n&gt; half-linkdead party, which<br/>\n&gt; died, followed by people reconnecting into Fear as a<br/>\n&gt; now very lonely, and<br/>\n&gt; shortly after very dead, person.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Fear plane did not crash itself - that would have<br/>\n&gt; made the players safe -<br/>\n&gt; because Fear does not populate for some time after a<br/>\n&gt; reboot. Instead, the<br/>\n&gt; overload of players on the server caused the tragic<br/>\n&gt; and needless deaths of<br/>\n&gt; people who just wanted to enjoy the game, and made<br/>\n&gt; their corpse recovery<br/>\n&gt; even harsher.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Clerics and Necromancers, I urge you - find a better<br/>\n&gt; way to protest. You are<br/>\n&gt; going down a path which will, again, bring needless<br/>\n&gt; suffering on those who<br/>\n&gt; are not participating. Non-violent protest is<br/>\n&gt; admirable, but if it causes<br/>\n&gt; death, its no longer non-violent, is it?<br/>\n&gt; -----<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I believe a sit-in, now that it is known that it<br/>\n&gt; causes problems to other<br/>\n&gt; players, is not a good way to protest. Please invent<br/>\n&gt; another form of<br/>\n&gt; peaceful protest, for the sake of others!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ~ Briza X`Ris ~<br/>\n&gt; ~ Mistress of Innoruuk ~<br/>\n&gt; ~ Fennin RO ~<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;     GRAB THE GATOR!
