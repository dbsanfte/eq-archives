Alas, I chose a Dark Elf, so I had to spend several points<br/>\ngetting my STR and STA up to a comfortable level. You should be fine though,<br/>\n103 WIS is a good base.

Ack...that has to be a joke for me. <br/>\n&gt; With my base wisdom of 103 and me being fairly new,<br/>\n&gt; the only way I will be able to get wisdom items is<br/>\n&gt; from killing the mobs myself (which means I will have<br/>\n&gt; to be fairly high to even get any good items)...Being<br/>\n&gt; new I can&#39;t afford them items as of now; plus I hear<br/>\n&gt; we clerics are very poor for a LONG while cause we<br/>\n&gt; have to buy armor and spells...which so far seems to<br/>\n&gt; be true.  In all honestly did I do the right thing by<br/>\n&gt; putting my strength up to 100 (I read a guide that<br/>\n&gt; said I should so I could wear full plate) or should I<br/>\n&gt; have just pilled all my points in wisdom?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Niomar, Dwarven Cleric of the 10th Training.
