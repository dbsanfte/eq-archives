It is basically an evil quest because the NPCs you need to talk to are dark elves.  There is a third piece on the zombie Commander Windstream in Befallen (level 20+ zombie), but to assemble the pieces you have to go to Neriak.  I dont have the stats on hand, but you can find it in EQ`Lizer (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.gamez.net/eq)\">http://www.gamez.net/eq)</a> and people I know who have it say its more useful in the throwing slot because it gives +sv magic I believe.Allsar Olath`Vlos - Rathe <br/>\n            -----Original Message----- <br/>\n            From: The Scotts &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jtscott@...\">jtscott@...</a>&gt; <br/>\n            To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq-clerics@onelist.com\">eq-clerics@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq-clerics@onelist.com\">eq-clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt; <br/>\n            Date: Tuesday, June 15, 1999 3:37 PM <br/>\n            Subject: [EQ-Clerics] Okay I have a few questions <br/>\n             First I was in the lower lvl of befallen and in about 1hr i got two pieces of some kind of mallet the head and the handle what other pieces do i need,what where do i take it to be built,and what are its stats?(compared to the screaming mace) also what is this peace keeper staff about can i have info on hopw to start the quest and who to talk ot and where the stuff can be found.
