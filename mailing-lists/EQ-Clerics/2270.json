First<br/>\n&gt;of all, 2h blunt will cause your stamina to drain<br/>\n&gt;FAST!  Also, there are many cleric only one hand blunt<br/>\n&gt;weapons floating around.  Althout the damage is not<br/>\n&gt;great, it all adds up.  It also gives you the<br/>\n&gt;opportunity to hold some great wisdom item in your<br/>\n&gt;other hand.  SOme prefer the testament or paw, but I<br/>\n&gt;prefer a charred guardian shield.  +9 wisdom plus AC,<br/>\n&gt;it&#39;s perfect ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t forget.
