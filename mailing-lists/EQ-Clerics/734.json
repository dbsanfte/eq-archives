Heard there was over<br/>\n&gt;4,000 ppl in Tallon Zek when it went live, not too long after it went up<br/>\n&gt;they took it down saying they wasn&#39;t gonna put it back up till they had <br/>\n&gt;more<br/>\n&gt;Team Servers up and that would be at least a week.<br/>\n&gt;From what I read while ppl waited for it to get up that there were TONS of<br/>\n&gt;ppl in the chat room, many cussing and screaming about it.  I&#39;ve also<br/>\n&gt;noticed this when a few or all servers go down, ppl act like that can&#39;t <br/>\n&gt;wait<br/>\n&gt;for a few hours to get back on.  Theres some much to real life and tons of<br/>\n&gt;things to do outside but yet ppl would rather sit in the house all day<br/>\n&gt;playing EQ instade of spending time with friends and loved ones but of<br/>\n&gt;course they just sit there and whin every 5 seconds about &quot;When&#39;s it gonna<br/>\n&gt;be back up?&quot; throw in a few cuss words and whin some more.  I may be flamed<br/>\n&gt;for this letter, but I just can&#39;t see why ppl acted that way.  Yes I play <br/>\n&gt;EQ<br/>\n&gt;like crazy, but I try to hang around friends and family as much as I can.<br/>\n&gt;Guess like that post on a web site said &quot;I refuse to call EQ a real game,<br/>\n&gt;it&#39;s video game crack&quot;.  If ya feel the need to flame me, go a head, but I<br/>\n&gt;bet many of you agree with what I&#39;m saying here.  It&#39;s just my 2 cents (or<br/>\n&gt;2cp).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;**************************<br/>\n&gt;Azor<br/>\n&gt;Lvl 18 Human Cleric of the Rathe<br/>\n&gt;**************************<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;You can WIN $100 to Amazon.com by starting a new list at ONElist.<br/>\n&gt;Drawing is held each week through August 20.
