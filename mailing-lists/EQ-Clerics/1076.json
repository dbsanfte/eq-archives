I&#39;ll have to try that.  I<br/>\nhad been fishing while at the same time trying to raise my divination<br/>\nskill, since I finally get a useful div spell - invis to undead, next<br/>\nlevel.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I&#39;m at it, here&#39;s a good newbie tip :<br/>\nthe skill of divination, for all clerics levels 13 and below have no<br/>\nreally useful spells that use this skill.  The only two are flash of<br/>\nlight and sense magic.  When you get to 14th level and finally get<br/>\ninvisibility to undead - a useful divination spell, your divination<br/>\nskill is liable to be in the single-digits.  Can you say &quot;fizzle,<br/>\nfizzle, fizzle&quot;?  So, do what I just did, and put an item on your<br/>\ncursor, and cast sense magic, over and over and over again.  It will<br/>\ngo up.  Before that, I tried casting flash of light on myself and then<br/>\ncure blindness, but that took forever!  You can also cast flash of<br/>\nlight on another player, and it won&#39;t affect them.  Either of these<br/>\ntricks will work, but the sense magic thing is much easier and<br/>\nquicker.  I finally maxed mine at 70, so I&#39;m ready to go for my next<br/>\nlevel!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;Actually i fish while i train my spellcasting skills. And my fishing<br/>\n&gt;skill is 184 ;) It takes a heck of a long time to build up the skills<br/>\n&gt;at higher levels. And i only build up the skills that are not used<br/>\n&gt;as much. And besides, you can fish while you meditate ;).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Iyenya Goldenheart<br/>\n&gt;Lvl 36 dwarf cleric<br/>\n&gt;Innoruuk server </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
