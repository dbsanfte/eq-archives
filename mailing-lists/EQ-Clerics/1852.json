I&#39;d like to give props out to you all, and everyone on the<br/>\n&gt; eq-cleric forum at stratic. (if any of you do both of these)<br/>\n&gt; So far that forum and this list is easily, from what i&#39;ve seen, most of<br/>\n&gt; the maturist ppl in this game..mind you, there are always exceptions.<br/>\n&gt; Well anyways, I&#39;ve run into real life head on, and basically my playing<br/>\n&gt; time has become very short, to almost non existant.. :(<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m currently lvl 20, and am finding myself getting somewhat<br/>\n&gt; frustrated.  I have a few wizards in the group of ppl that I play with<br/>\n&gt; (all higher lvl though) and I am able to occasinoally go to multiple<br/>\n&gt; zones.  I&#39;m having an extremely tough time finding a group.  Now, I know<br/>\n&gt; my name has not been tarnished, unless it&#39;s been by an adolescent, so I<br/>\n&gt; rule that case out.  My friends say this is a tough time for a cleric to<br/>\n&gt; find groups because our heal spell isn&#39;t that effective (which I<br/>\n&gt; agree).  But, being the poor melee&#39;ers we are, I can&#39;t solo (one<br/>\n&gt; exception..If I can do 2 things..1) find undead available to kill 2)<br/>\n&gt; root holds).<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve been to unrest, lake rathe, oasis, bird citie (south karana? or<br/>\n&gt; north..can&#39;t remember), perma, and basically I never get tells back from<br/>\n&gt; anyone.  Now one thing I&#39;ve noticed is that the number of clerics has<br/>\n&gt; risen, and groups will often tell me, &#39;sorry, we already have a<br/>\n&gt; cleric&#39;.  And I&#39;m not sure why they wouldn&#39;t want another one! Oh well,<br/>\n&gt; I throw that away assuming they are playing their first character.<br/>\n&gt; Anyways, I was basically just looking for a place to hunt and that I can<br/>\n&gt; easily get a group.  It sucks when you might have 2 hours to play a<br/>\n&gt; week, and you spend 1 hour advertising for a group...<br/>\n&gt; Or is it possibly I&#39;m going to have to do my best to find a place to<br/>\n&gt; solo undead for 4 levels?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Any and all help would be appreciated.<br/>\n&gt; TIA<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Evertorn<br/>\n&gt; 20th lvl erudite cleric<br/>\n&gt; Veeshan </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
