It<br/>\nseems that everyone wants a lvl 14 or so cleric cos they can heal more, and<br/>\nadmittedly i have problems keeping up with the damage that creatures a few<br/>\nlvls higher than me can dish out (being only able to heal 30 a pop).  so i<br/>\nwas wondering if anyone knows of a good hunting place i could check out at<br/>\nlvl 12 and 13 (one bar left till 13 woo).<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks<br/>\nGwaihir<br/>\nCazic-Thule</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
