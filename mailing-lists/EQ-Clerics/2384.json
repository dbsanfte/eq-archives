They are<br/>\n2gp apiece.  So, pick up a few of those as well.

I&#39;ve got about 40 pp in the <br/>\n&gt;bank, and am wearing all leather.  Will this be enough cash and what spells <br/>\n&gt;should be purchased first?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Walt Zimbeck&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wzimbeck@...\">wzimbeck@...</a>&gt; 11/29/99 02:29PM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: &quot;Walt Zimbeck&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wzimbeck@...\">wzimbeck@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I should be making 14 later this week and would like to know what spells <br/>\n&gt;are<br/>\n&gt;best to get first.   As you all are aware money is a definite problem at<br/>\n&gt;this level.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I had a wonderful week as far as donations to my equipment goes.  I was<br/>\n&gt;given a banded tunic and a blackened neck guard plus getting rawhide gloves<br/>\n&gt;from a zombie really helped.  A few lootings of ghouls has also helped my<br/>\n&gt;bank account a lot.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I am still having trouble finding groups at times but so far with only one<br/>\n&gt;exception I have not lost a party member yet.  The only exception was an<br/>\n&gt;ill-fated venture into Oasis when I was still 11th.  I really think that<br/>\n&gt;upon making 14 I will head back to GFay.  I have nothing against Freeport<br/>\n&gt;and EC but I think the humans are all jealous of us elves.
