That no one group of people should be discriminated against or","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1694525582\">Bann,<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are missing the entire point of my post.  I am talking about the<br/>\nprinciple itself.  That no one group of people should be discriminated<br/>\nagainst or treated differently or penalized because they happen to be of a<br/>\nhigher OR lower level.  THAT is the point.  And it doesn&#39;t matter whether or<br/>\nnot you can buy the item from someone else....and believe me, I have tried<br/>\nto buy the rings and they are getting more costly than the Box of Abu-Kar IF<br/>\nyou can even find them.  But again, that is NOT the point.  It is the<br/>\nPRINCIPLE behind Brad&#39;s yield policy that I am saying I feel is just flat<br/>\nwrong because it treats groups differently, which I do not believe is fair.<br/>\nA broad sweeping policy change such as this is going to create significant<br/>\nproblems from my viewpoint, especially among higher levels such as myself<br/>\nwho are now attempting to acquire certain items I haven&#39;t gotten in the<br/>\npast, for whatever reason.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yes, I do know there are higher level jerks out there who feel they can<br/>\npush their way into any area and take what they want just because they are<br/>\nhigher level and have more fire/melee power.  But I am not responsible for<br/>\nthe actions of these people, who will exist in any online game you play, and<br/>\nI certainly don&#39;t believe responsible, mature players like myself should be<br/>\npenalized because of them.  And in my experience, bitching at these types of<br/>\npeople, as you suggest, is a waste of time and effort...you can&#39;t change<br/>\npeople, and they will continue to play as they will, good or bad.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, I feel the policy should be...first there stays there, and then the<br/>\nnext in line gets the spot, regardless of level.  This is the fair way to do<br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nMikaela R&#39;achai, aka Mik<br/>\nLevel 50 cleric and servant of Mithaniel Marr on The Rathe<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Ralph &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:carothersr@...\">carothersr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Sunday, September 12, 1999 10:07 AM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [EQ-Clerics] Yield Policy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Ralph&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:carothersr@...\">carothersr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Its funny to see this on a CLERICAL  HELP list first off....secondly....why<br/>\n&gt;cant you go and BUY the item from the lower levels then?

I<br/>\n&gt;think<br/>\n&gt;&gt; the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; first group there stays there, regardless of their level.  And noone<br/>\n&gt;is able<br/>\n&gt;&gt; to throw<br/>\n&gt;&gt; another group out if that group was there first.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I have wanted a nightshade wreath and gem sceptre for ages.  So today,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; myself and 5 other level 50s went to camp MM castle.  Everything there<br/>\n&gt;was<br/>\n&gt;&gt; green to us, but myself and a level 50 shaman friend wanted wreaths<br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; sceptres, which we didn&#39;t have.  Under Brad&#39;s rule, if a group of<br/>\n&gt;&gt; level 35+ comes, and they can get exp for that area, then we have to<br/>\n&gt;yield<br/>\n&gt;&gt; and give up a spot we have been at for hours. Tell me where the<br/>\n&gt;fairness in<br/>\n&gt;&gt; THAT<br/>\n&gt;&gt; rule is.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Since there are very few places I can get exp anymore and have maxxed<br/>\n&gt;&gt; out level 50, I am going around and getting items I don&#39;t have because<br/>\n&gt;I was<br/>\n&gt;&gt; focusing on exp and helping others level as well.  I plan to do the<br/>\n&gt;Paw of<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Opallo quest next.  Mitty is green to me, as is Gynok Moltar.  Should<br/>\n&gt;I have<br/>\n&gt;&gt; to leave camping them just because lower levels come to camp for the<br/>\n&gt;same<br/>\n&gt;&gt; items I<br/>\n&gt;&gt; want?  I think that is totally unfair. Just because I am level 50<br/>\n&gt;doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;&gt; mean I&quot;m not<br/>\n&gt;&gt; entitled to get items I don&#39;t have just because the mobs don&#39;t give me<br/>\n&gt;exp<br/>\n&gt;&gt; anymore.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Again, my opinion is....first there stays there.  Then when they<br/>\n&gt;leave, the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; next group in line gets the camp spot.  I don&#39;t think levels should<br/>\n&gt;have<br/>\n&gt;&gt; anything to do with who gets the camp spot.  I don&#39;t think high levels<br/>\n&gt;&gt; should force lower levels away from a camp spot, and I don&#39;t think<br/>\n&gt;lower<br/>\n&gt;&gt; levels should be able to force higher levels away if they were there<br/>\n&gt;first.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; To do it any other way discriminates against one group over another<br/>\n&gt;(higher<br/>\n&gt;&gt; vs. lower).<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; And I&#39;ll tell you this....if a GM tells me to leave a camp spot I have<br/>\n&gt;been<br/>\n&gt;&gt; at<br/>\n&gt;&gt; for hours for an item I don&#39;t have that I want just because some lower<br/>\n&gt;&gt; levels  arrived and want my spot, then I won&#39;t be playing EQ for very<br/>\n&gt;&gt; much longer.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; The only fair way IMO is first there stays there, regardless of level,<br/>\n&gt;then<br/>\n&gt;&gt; whomever was next gets it next, and so on and so on.  Get in line and<br/>\n&gt;take a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; number.  No one group of players should be favored over another.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; To do it Brad&#39;s way, would mean that any player that didn&#39;t get an<br/>\n&gt;item<br/>\n&gt;&gt; while he/she was<br/>\n&gt;&gt; able to get exp from that particular mob could basically never get<br/>\n&gt;that item<br/>\n&gt;&gt; cause they could be<br/>\n&gt;&gt; thrown out of the camp spot everytime lower levels came along.  This<br/>\n&gt;is<br/>\n&gt;&gt; totally not fair.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Mik (who abhors discrimination or favoritism in any way, shape or<br/>\n&gt;form)<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;&gt; From: John Erik Maynus &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jmaynus@...\">jmaynus@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Date: Saturday, September 11, 1999 11:41 PM<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Subject: [EQ-Clerics] Yield Policy<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;From: &quot;John Erik Maynus&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jmaynus@...\">jmaynus@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;What does everyone think of this Yield Policy?
