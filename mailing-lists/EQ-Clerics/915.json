If they are fighting i stop and throw a heal on<br/>\nthem. If they are sitting and very low on health i throw a heal on them.<br/>\nHowever, if i am in group i rarely check the health of others unless it<br/>\nlooks very obvious that the guy is losing AND all my group members are<br/>\nsafe. Also, if i am hunting in a guild event i am extra careful about<br/>\nmy fellow guildmembers health but still might be looking out for others<br/>\nwho may be in trouble. And for revives i feel sorry for the people<br/>\nespecially if they are binded far away. I have never charged for a revive<br/>\nand never will. Often i even offer a revive for them if i see them slayed<br/>\nby Bouncer Hurd or some other foul beast.<br/>\n<br/>\nIyenya Goldenheart<br/>\nLvl 36 dwarf cleric<br/>\nInnoruuk server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
