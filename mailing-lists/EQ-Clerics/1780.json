Just as you enter Befallen. I saw<br/>\nhim inthe open area just before the stairs going down to the 4 doors.  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think he was trained up too far, as I can&#39;t imagine anyone being able<br/>\nto run fromthe third level, thru two locked doors, with him on your tail. So<br/>\nI would imagine that he spawned relatively close to the point where I saw<br/>\nhim.  BUt that is just conjecture, and you wanted facts. So the fact is, I<br/>\nsaw him on the first level, at the top of the very first set of stairs.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Jerry Hawkins [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhawkins@...\">jhawkins@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: 1999/10/08 4:45 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [EQ-Clerics] Paw of Opalla<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHey Everyone,<br/>\n <br/>\nI really would like to complete my Paw of Opalla, i TOTALLY lucked in to the<br/>\nfirst 3 rings, i camped Mitty for about an hour and she droped the gold and<br/>\ncopper.

So, if<br/>\nyou have SEEN him, not heard about him being somewhere, but ACTUALLY SEEN<br/>\nHIM with YOUR character, please let me know where.  Yes, i know Befallen,<br/>\nbut where?  First floor in entrance area? Third floor near Elf Skeletons??<br/>\nPlease let me know any visual sightings. <br/>\n <br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n <br/>\nSmeal Stonehammer<br/>\n22nd Sphere of Life,<br/>\nDeciple of Rodcet Nife,<br/>\nVeeshan Existance<br/>\n <br/>\nplayed by <br/>\n <br/>\nJerry Hawkins<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Jhawkins@...\">Jhawkins@...</a> &lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Jhawkins@...\">Jhawkins@...</a>&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
