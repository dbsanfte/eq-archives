Of course, nothing like that would ever happen on<br/>\nTest, but it did sound like fun, nonetheless.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Trizzen Do&#39;Trevan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:trizzen@...\">trizzen@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I don&#39;t know if I have just been lucky last week or so, or if they have<br/>\n&gt;a new directive for GMs to do this, but I have participated in three<br/>\n&gt;separate battles against NPCs controlled by GMs on two different<br/>\n&gt;servers.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I LOVED it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The complete randomness that this brought to the zone was such a<br/>\n&gt;welcome addition. One in particular was extremely well done. The GM<br/>\n&gt;spawned a powerful giant rat in a newbie zone. The fun started once the<br/>\n&gt;players realized what was going on. There were enough experienced<br/>\n&gt;players starting new characters that a plan was formed rather quickly.<br/>\n&gt;Several groups formed under these players and then a simulaneous attack<br/>\n&gt;occured. It was a tremendous amount of fun for the &quot;new&quot; players as<br/>\n&gt;well as the more experienced players. There weren&#39;t any characters<br/>\n&gt;invloved that were higher then 8 I believe. The GM actually broadcast a<br/>\n&gt;message congratulating all and naming several that went above and<br/>\n&gt;beyond in their attempt to role play. He even rewarded me(level 5) with<br/>\n&gt;a nice bracer for the way I circled the fight and healed key members of<br/>\n&gt;the three groups. He said something like &quot;for showing others by example<br/>\n&gt;what a cleric is supposed to be.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Now, the point of all that rambling was how much I think this adds to<br/>\n&gt;the game.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;1. You have an intelligent opponent without having to be PvP.<br/>\n&gt;2. Tremendous opportunity for role-play.<br/>\n&gt;3. Fun for game-knowledgable as well as newbies.<br/>\n&gt;4. I would much rather obtain items in this way, then pitching a tent<br/>\n&gt;in Najena for 17 hours straight.<br/>\n&gt;5. No EXP is lost by a death from a NPC controlled by a GM.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I know this is not exactly cleric specific, but since the last episode<br/>\n&gt;happened to a cleric and I like this list...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Any thoughts?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Trizzen 5th circle priestess of light<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;_________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt;Bid and sell for free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://auctions.yahoo.com\">http://auctions.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;ATTN ONELIST USERS: stay current on the latest activities,<br/>\n&gt;programs, & features at ONElist by joining our member newsletter at<br/>\n&gt;&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/onelist_announce\">http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/onelist_announce</a> &quot;&gt;Click&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
