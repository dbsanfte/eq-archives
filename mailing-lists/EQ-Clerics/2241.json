I have half the set of our quest armor and I think it looks really<br/>\ncool, on the males anyway. I have a friend that is a Female DE Cleric and<br/>\nshe is in Full store-bought plate and looks really nice (gotta love our helm<br/>\ngraphic). And the high elves are supposed to look haughty...that&#39;s their Ego<br/>\nkicking in. Pathetic light races, heh.<br/>\n<br/>\nDrizben D&#39;Vorn<br/>\nDefiled High Priest of Innoruuk<br/>\nOblivion Knight of the 29th Circle<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Rose&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rliu@...\">rliu@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hello,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This might be a silly plead for advice but here it is...I am restarting my<br/>\n&gt; cleric on a new server.  My old cleric is a high elf female.  I am torn<br/>\n&gt; between restarting as a dark elf or stick with the high elf.  Which in<br/>\n&gt; y&#39;all&#39;s opinion...looks better?  I have never seen a dark elf in the<br/>\n&gt; purple<br/>\n&gt; armor...do they look silly?  Does the purple make em look like a blueberry<br/>\n&gt; and grape mix?  I have never seen a dark elf in the yellow quest armor as<br/>\n&gt; well.  I do like the way the dark elf females look but given the color<br/>\n&gt; scheme I might not be able to live with myself if the color is too much of<br/>\n&gt; an offense to my fashion sense =).  The only thing I do not like about the<br/>\n&gt; high elf females is the face...they look too haughty. Although I have to<br/>\n&gt; admit that plate armor looks really good on the females.  However, another<br/>\n&gt; reluctance is the fact that there just seems to be more high elves cleric<br/>\n&gt; then dark elves...yeah I know the stat is better...but I want to look my<br/>\n&gt; best as well and be unique ;)  Anyway advise is appreciated...thanks.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; These are female characters I am talking about.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -Imogen<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
