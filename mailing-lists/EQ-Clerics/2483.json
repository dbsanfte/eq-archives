Originally, Vox has been<br/>\nthe only dragon that drops a White Dragon Tooth, which had the effect of<br/>\nsummoning a level 49 necromancer pet.  She dropped this item pretty often<br/>\nit seemed, at least 1 tooth every two kills, sometimes 2 teeth on one body.<br/>\n However, after slaying Lord Nagafen roughly 10 times, Lord Nagafen now<br/>\ndrops a Red Dragon tooth as well (Many peeps, including me, believe this is<br/>\na new item drop for Nagafen, that was recently introduced).  Many of us are<br/>\nholding onto these items for now, in case they are needed for some sort of<br/>\n&quot;super&quot; quest (Hmmm...  could these be needed for the fabled Fiery Avenger<br/>\nquest they are revamping?).<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not much of a trader, so I couldn&#39;t comment on what a reasonable trade<br/>\nfor the Reed Belt would be.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-Aosinator Lightbringer<br/>\n-Devout follower of Mithaniel Marr on The Rathe<br/>\n<br/>\n                               |&#92;      _,,,---,,_      <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:darshan@...\">darshan@...</a>   ZZZzz /,`.-&#39;`&#39;    -.  ;-;;,_   <br/>\n                              |,4-  ) )-,_. ,&#92; (  `&#39;-&#39;  <br/>\n                             &#39;---&#39;&#39;(_/--&#39;  `-&#39;&#92;_)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
