I know this <br/>\n&gt;is ranting but hear me out. I know we aren&#39;t fighters but we are defensive <br/>\n&gt;players in the game. Why not give us a few defensive weapons. Weapons with <br/>\n&gt;random charges of some type of defensive spell. I know ya&#39;ll will all say <br/>\n&gt;well what about the screaming mace? Blah it does a whole lot of good for <br/>\n&gt;you when your not even supposed to be tanking right? Anyway, why not have <br/>\n&gt;that cast as an area affect yaulp? That would be much kewler and much more <br/>\n&gt;beneficial to the group. What do all of ya&#39;ll think about something like <br/>\n&gt;that? I&#39;m not saying that the clerics in general are unbalanced in the game <br/>\n&gt;but what I&#39;m saying is there are weapons that are class specific to most <br/>\n&gt;other classes but the clerics. Please give me your feedback. Please feel <br/>\n&gt;free to rant right back at me to... just don&#39;t be too harsh! :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;**********************<br/>\n&gt;Human Cleric<br/>\n&gt;Ramsess De&#39;Vizier<br/>\n&gt;Rallos Zek<br/>\n&gt;********************** </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
