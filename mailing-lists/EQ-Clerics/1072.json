Interesting.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Is this MAYBE because the mobs who can stun are usually green? Most of<br/>\n&gt; the skellys in the early stages of Najena are green, though I&#39;m not high<br/>\n&gt; enough level for them to ignore (lvl 17). But I believe that I&#39;ve been<br/>\n&gt; stunned while DA has not been acitve....hmm....i&#39;ll have to do some more<br/>\n&gt; training (heh heh) and see what the deal is. Maybe Verant secretly<br/>\n&gt; patched that little bug. Errr...chuckle....guffaw.....HAHAHAHAHA!!!!<br/>\n&gt; Yeah, right.
