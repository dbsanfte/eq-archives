But this guy was saying a Lvl 1 Orge could go in<br/>\n&gt; there and get by all these tough baddies and cause some major trains.  For<br/>\n&gt; one I&#39;d like to know how a low lvl anything can get even close to this<br/>\n&gt; place, luck?  But someone replied to the post and said it was true a low lvl<br/>\n&gt; player could do that.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d love to see this place at least once, seen screen shots but pics are<br/>\n&gt; nothing I want to see the real deal.<br/>\n&gt; Also heard the lag for this place (I take it is bad) was as bad as<br/>\n&gt; Lavastorm.  Since I haven&#39;t been to Lavastorm yet I wouldn&#39;t know, but if<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s as bad as Unrest the lag will have to suck.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; **************************<br/>\n&gt; Azor<br/>\n&gt; Lvl 18 Human Cleric of the Rathe<br/>\n&gt; **************************<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Mystik &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mystik@...\">mystik@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; i wouldn&#39;t consider going there till at least 40+...preferably 45+...and<br/>\n&gt; in at<br/>\n&gt; &gt; least 2-3 full, well-rounded groups.....nasty place, but it&#39;s loads of fun<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (&#92;/)ystix Spellchaser<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lv 46 and 1/2 human cleric of The Rathe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (it&#39;s amazing how good specs are for exp that level...some green, but<br/>\n&gt; sitll give<br/>\n&gt; &gt; exp..go fig)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Azor wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: &quot;Azor&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jmaynus@...\">jmaynus@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yeah common for now, knowing Verant they&#39;ll change this one day.
