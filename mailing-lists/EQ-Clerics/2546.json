Since you","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1975821299\">Might I suggest you try this in Cazic?  =)  <br/>\nJust the other night I heard somebody shouting asking somebody to buy all their FS from them<br/>\nat 2pp each.  Since you can sell them at 5pp each, it&#39;s a good deal.   There is a lot more FS in Cazic than there is in unrest and it&#39;s a lot further from good selling grounds.  This is especially a good spot if you play an Ogre or a Troll and can sell in Ogguk... since most of the people in Cazic have to go much further to sell.    I know that I usually end up leaving FS lyin on the ground in Cazic because it weighs me down to the point where i can&#39;t even move.   It works out to be a good deal for the people in Cazic because they can sell all their FS with a 2pp/per profit and not have to run back to sell their stuff, and a good deal for you as well because you make 3pp per piece.    I don&#39;t think this would work as well in Unrest since there isn&#39;t nearly as much FS available.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Eachann Bronzeleaf,<br/>\n-Cleric of Tunare, Tarew Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: Chris Wheeler &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wheelech@...\">wheelech@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, December 14, 1999 12:58 PM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [EQ-Clerics] making money (was: wis items)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Chris Wheeler &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wheelech@...\">wheelech@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve been doing a similiar thing in Unrest lately.  Suprisingly, it isn&#39;t as<br/>\n&gt; profitable as you might imagine.  At some points, it gets down right<br/>\n&gt; annoying to do. I have made about 30pp doing it in one nite, but it does<br/>\n&gt; become tiresome.  If you have the patience to do it, you can spend hours<br/>\n&gt; trying to buy and sell.  But in my opinion, it just ends up being a waste of<br/>\n&gt; time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Brytewing.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Heather Daley [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:blushn@...\">blushn@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: 1999/12/14 11:43 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] making money (was: wis items)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Heather Daley&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:blushn@...\">blushn@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There was a great little business on Fennin Ro called, Rokk and Rhunes <br/>\n&gt; Emporium, hehe.  These 2 Ogres had this business going in Cazic doing the <br/>\n&gt; very same thing.  At least one of them was there everyday. They had to have <br/>\n&gt; made tremendous amounts of cash there.  It is very time consuming and takes <br/>\n&gt; aways from the hunt quite a bit, but it is an easy way to make cash.<br/>\n&gt; I also just recently noticed that there is a travelling person in South <br/>\n&gt; Karana now, he starts out at the Bridge, announcing to the zone he is there <br/>\n&gt; to change their money for them from Copper to silver, gold, etc...  He then <br/>\n&gt; travels to different set locations, Centaurs, aviaks, etc... advertising as <br/>\n&gt; he goes.  I&#39;m not sure how successful he is but seems like it would be <br/>\n&gt; profittable.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Bree<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
