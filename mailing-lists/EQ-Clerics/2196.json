I could be wrong, but it is much easier to group.  The power of a cleric is shown in groups, not in soloing.   I find that I cannot solo most blue things now that I&#39;m in my high 20&#39;s and the things that are blue that I can solo take up so much of my mana that I am medding for a very long time after every fight so it isn&#39;t worth it at all to try to solo as a cleric.   That&#39;s IMHO of course =)<br/>\n<br/>\nBesides, everything is more fun with friends =)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Eachann Bronzeleaf<br/>\n-Cleric of Tunare, Tarew Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: Rose &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rliu@...\">rliu@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, November 16, 1999 12:14 PM<br/>\nSubject: [EQ-Clerics] Can a cleric solo to 50?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Rose&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rliu@...\">rliu@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Just curious...any clerics here solo (or come close to it) to lvl 50?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Is there a good website that tells you how to do the cleric armor quest?<br/>\n&gt; Like the loc of the items.
