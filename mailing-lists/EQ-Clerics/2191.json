I dont care what I am wielding what I am wearing.  Hey I am level<br/>\n27 and I still wear some banded pieces and my good old spiked collar, but I<br/>\njust got my Lizzy Cloak which wasnt to hard to get :)Going off the topic a<br/>\nbit yeah the extra +5 dex I noticed did help my channeling A LOT!!!!  Anyway<br/>\nback to the topic.   Why because I dont want to camp a site for 2 weeks that<br/>\nwhen it is my turn to get that item only to get it kill stolen or someone<br/>\nelse in the group got greedy and took it.  Quests in EQ are about camping<br/>\ntill you get the item.  Its that easy.  I agree with Eachann about making<br/>\nrare items spawn random.  Seems like Verant doesnt have the know how to<br/>\nprogram that into the system.  It will reduce the camping a lot and IMHO I<br/>\nthink it will make the game much more fun instead of people staying weeks<br/>\neven months in 1 zone.  If our characters ever got fat from camping 1 site<br/>\nover and over and not exercising,  most of us would start looking like a<br/>\nOrge.  <br/>\n<br/>\nQanin Skywanderer<br/>\n27th Circle The Rathe<br/>\n<br/>\np.s Oh about my previous post about not finding a group...  Looks like in 3<br/>\nmonths when I was gone things have changed.

It is<br/>\njust stupid.  Look at what they did to the cleric armor quest... everything<br/>\non it takes 7 hours or more to spawn.   And making us camp Bilge just adds<br/>\ninsult to injury.. .i mean that goblin is HEAVILY camped already because it<br/>\nholds teh Kedge Totem and some kind of belt.  It rarely spawns and has<br/>\npeople lined up for a chance at him, and now they gave it the cleric armor<br/>\nicon as well so we not only have to compete for this rare spawn with other<br/>\nclerics, but also with every other class who wants his items...<br/>\n*sigh*  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhy can&#39;t they make the quests like the Warriors aviak charm quest... where<br/>\nwe could kill just normal MOBs and they would rarely drop the icon?   This<br/>\nwould make it still difficult to get the piece, since it would be a rare<br/>\n(very rare??) drop... but we could just hunt and try to find it instead of<br/>\nhaving to camp one rare spawn.    Or maybe they could make it not a hunt at<br/>\nall, but rather a spawn that can come up in random locations, random zones,<br/>\nand you need to follow clues or solve a puzzle in order to know where and<br/>\nwhen it will spawn?  Something like that... these camping quests just (for<br/>\nlack of a better term) suck.    They said they wanted to put the &quot;Quest&quot;<br/>\nback in EverQuest, but all they have done is put more emphasis than ever on<br/>\nCAMP.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOh well, who am I to say... just another player... one of many...<br/>\n<br/>\n-Eachann Bronzeleaf,<br/>\n-Cleric of Tunare, Tarew Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In part of their quest against camping, EQ set things up with a spawn<br/>\n&gt; range.
