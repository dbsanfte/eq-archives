Furthermore, i melee alot but i choose to do it when <br/>\ni am Oom, i have died on many occations, when i was oom and ordered my group <br/>\nto flee, as i was full HP i stayed to get the critters of the rest of my <br/>\ngroup.  IMHO i beleive that any cleric worth their salt will give up their <br/>\nlife to save the group as a whole, LOL don&#39;t get me wrong tho, i don&#39;t like- <br/>\ntry to die, heh, and i am not saying this is the right way to go for all <br/>\nclerics, it is just the way i play the role, most often i do not die tho and <br/>\nlvl right along with the rest of my group.  i have been blessed with a great <br/>\ngroup when we have more than one on us, and i am being hit, i usually just <br/>\nhave to say &quot;rook on me&quot; and they are by my side, taunting or whatever, and <br/>\nthe only reason i ever lose anyone is if i am being hit and interuppted, <br/>\nthat part od it sucks, but alas we do have another cleric in group who <br/>\nmainly does melee, so if i fail on a heal she can usually get my back,,,,, <br/>\nthats all :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Mikaela&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mikaela1@...\">mikaela1@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [EQ-Clerics] the road less traveled...<br/>\n&gt;Date: Sun, 19 Sep 1999 12:30:34 -0400<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: &quot;Mikaela&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mikaela1@...\">mikaela1@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Yes, Anne, I agree that first and foremost we are and should be healers.<br/>\n&gt;THAT is our primary role in EQ.  But as I said in my previous post,  there<br/>\n&gt;are opportunities for you to get to melee even in a group, you just have to<br/>\n&gt;know when NOT to melee but sit and med.  If I&quot;m FM and they just pulled a<br/>\n&gt;critter, and I know they have to get down to 2 bubbs of health before I <br/>\n&gt;heal<br/>\n&gt;with complete healing, I&#39;m not gonna just sit or stand there and watch the<br/>\n&gt;battle.  The key is knowing WHEN you get to and stay at melee, WHEN you use<br/>\n&gt;your DD spells, and WHEN you sit down and do your heal and med routine.  <br/>\n&gt;Not<br/>\n&gt;a single one of my group has EVER questioned me when I get to melee or cast<br/>\n&gt;a dd spell.  They trust me and know that I will not let them die because I<br/>\n&gt;am not watching their hps or don&#39;t have mana to heal them or don&#39;t know <br/>\n&gt;WHEN<br/>\n&gt;to heal them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  I know one cleric whose tank died in the Avatar Room in Cazic because he<br/>\n&gt;(the cleric)  didn&#39;t want to &quot;waste&quot; any mana on a complete heal and waited<br/>\n&gt;til the tank was at 1 bubble before he began to cast, and then his spell<br/>\n&gt;fizzled.  The tank was NOT happy and would not group with him anymore.  I<br/>\n&gt;also &quot;grew up&quot; so to speak with a cleric/wizard wannabe, who didn&#39;t want to<br/>\n&gt;do anything but nuke with his dd spells.  In fact, he even specialized in<br/>\n&gt;Evocation instead of Alteration so he could save mana on his dd spells.  I<br/>\n&gt;got tired of grouping with him because I couldn&#39;t depend on him as a <br/>\n&gt;back-up<br/>\n&gt;cleric for healing cause he never had any mana cause he was always nuking.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;A cleric who doesn&#39;t learn these &quot;Whens&quot; early on will not be effective.<br/>\n&gt;It&#39;s called Learning How To Be A Cleric 101, with advanced courses as you<br/>\n&gt;get older.  If a group member dies because you didn&#39;t heal him/her on time,<br/>\n&gt;or didn&#39;t have mana to heal cause you were meleeing or throwing <br/>\n&gt;Retributions<br/>\n&gt;around like they were a 50 mana cost spell, then shame on ya and you should<br/>\n&gt;go play another class cause you simply don&#39;t understand what clerics are <br/>\n&gt;all<br/>\n&gt;about and how to play them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Mik<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Topaaz / LadyJay - *Power Corrupts and absolute Power corrupts absolutly* <br/>\n*hugs*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
