I have played RPGs since the age of 8 (I am <br/>\n&gt;26<br/>\n&gt;now), and I have played many multi-player RPGs (when they were first <br/>\n&gt;invented<br/>\n&gt;around 1986 or so)  where roleplaying was great, and one of them was very<br/>\n&gt;recent- a year ago to be exact. Of course there were questions where <br/>\n&gt;someone<br/>\n&gt;will ask what level you are or the monsters hit points, but there was also <br/>\n&gt;a<br/>\n&gt;great deal of roleplaying, so it didnt matter -  I have even  been OOC on<br/>\n&gt;*more* then one occasionof times myself. But people were there because it <br/>\n&gt;was<br/>\n&gt;a different world to escape to. Norrath to me is an empty world.<br/>\n&gt;   I have never been in a game where so many people ripped me off so they <br/>\n&gt;can<br/>\n&gt;get more money to buy that next cool item.  I can understand if your<br/>\n&gt;character is a thief or some other mischievous being that follows a deity <br/>\n&gt;of<br/>\n&gt;that sort- but  how many times has this happened to you -<br/>\n&gt;   1)  A  paladin left you for death while you were fighting off monsters- <br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;he/she ran without thought of honor or disgrace - as what he would say to<br/>\n&gt;explain the situation - &quot; I didnt want to  lose &quot; a half bar of <br/>\n&gt;experience&#39;&#39;<br/>\n&gt;   2) A  holy cleric  said to you &quot;It&#39;s a nosave lightstone&quot; in Kerra isle<br/>\n&gt;(Before nosave lightstones were implemented in Kerra isle)<br/>\n&gt;  3) A person following a deity of &#39;goodness&#39; loot every corpse in sight <br/>\n&gt;even<br/>\n&gt;though it wasnt his/her turn.<br/>\n&gt;  4) A person diband your group to join another group for more &quot; <br/>\n&gt;experience&#39;&quot;<br/>\n&gt;rather then enjoying the moment of adventurers  for the cause of good<br/>\n&gt;adventure.<br/>\n&gt;  5)  A ranger or druid killing a bear, lion, elephant, etc - for &quot;exp or <br/>\n&gt;to<br/>\n&gt;increase my &#39;tailoring skill&#39; &quot;<br/>\n&gt;  Etc, etc..the list goes on. I expected these things to happen, but I have<br/>\n&gt;never met a single perons in EQ that actually tried  to adhere to their<br/>\n&gt;character.  The world of EQ is full of greed and who can be the next &#39;<br/>\n&gt;coolest high level character&#39;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  T Alexander<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Have pet food delivered right to your door, from Petstore.com!<br/>\n&gt;&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/petstore1\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/petstore1</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt;A new breed of petstore - Petstore.com<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
