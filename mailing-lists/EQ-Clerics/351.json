I<br/>\nthink it&#39;d cause to many problems, just my luck they&#39;d be some bug caused by<br/>\nmoving like that and my character would get deleted for good or messed up<br/>\nbad.  But I take it back about hurrying up and giving us that new land mass,<br/>\nI don&#39;t want them to rush it and have tons of bugs in it.  But the idea<br/>\nabout locking out the newbies to certin servers that is a good idea.  I&#39;d<br/>\nsay Rathe and Xeynos and Finnin Ro should be the main three that they get<br/>\nlocked out of for a while.  Not trying to be mean to new players but those<br/>\nservers are getting too many players on them and at times you have TONS of<br/>\ntrouble finding a place to hunt and it can also cause TONS of lag in that<br/>\narea if there too many players camped there.<br/>\n<br/>\n**************************<br/>\nAzor<br/>\nLvl 16 Human Cleric of the Rathe<br/>\n**************************<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Alvarez, Ruben (consultant)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ruben.alvarez@...\">ruben.alvarez@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thats true until it settles down.
