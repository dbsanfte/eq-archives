We&#39;ve traveled together since sometime<br/>\nbetween L4-L6.  We would often fight stuff and he&#39;d get experience and I<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t... even stuff that was blue to both of us.  We&#39;d also fight stuff<br/>\nthat was green to both of us, and he&#39;d get the experience.  He&#39;d also<br/>\ngenerally get levels just a little ahead of me.  We were pretty much the<br/>\nsame level until recently.  I&#39;ve just come to accept this. =(<br/>\n<br/>\nHe is a Half-Elf Ranger and I am a High Elf Cleric.  I guess I always just<br/>\nblew it off to some race/class issues.  I assumed because he was a fighting<br/>\nclass, exp came easier (like in D&D).  Also, Half Elves didn&#39;t receive as<br/>\nquite of a dramatic attribute adjustment.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the long run, it&#39;s not a major issue.  But I know how it can be a concern<br/>\na lower levels.<br/>\n<br/>\n~ren<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Chas Watkins &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cwatkins@...\">cwatkins@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, September 30, 1999 2:10 PM<br/>\nSubject: [EQ-Clerics] Uneven experience<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Chas Watkins &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cwatkins@...\">cwatkins@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sorry about the previous posting on the &quot;Paws of Opalla&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I, a level 14 Cleric, and I was grouped with a level 14 Ranger last night.<br/>\n&gt; We were wondering around CB last night killing legionnaires.
