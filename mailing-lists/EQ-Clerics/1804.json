He gives you the book..<br/>\n&gt;then do the 4gp gamble thing to get the jester card.  Then give jester<br/>\n&gt;card to Moodoro to get page.  Then go to HP and kill Dynil and get the<br/>\n&gt;other page. Stick both pages in book and hit combine.  No need to go to<br/>\n&gt;Erudin at all..<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;You will need to not be KOS in Qeynos and HP of course but that is<br/>\n&gt;reasonably easy to achieve and you should be aiming for it anyway in my<br/>\n&gt;opinion since DEs have so much hassle selling/banking as it is.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Vinamin<br/>\n&gt;Son of Innoruuk<br/>\n&gt;Priest of The Lady<br/>\n&gt;Erollisi Marr </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
