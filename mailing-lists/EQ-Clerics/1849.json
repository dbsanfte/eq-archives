I run around Unrest for the most <br/>\npart, and advertise every once in awhile that I am looking to group.  If I <br/>\ndon&#39;t have any contacts on, I usually spend about 5-10 minutes doing this <br/>\nbefore I get a tell.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing that I do when it is really slow (I did this last night).  I <br/>\nsat out on the lawn of unrest invised...and assisted a party when they got <br/>\nmobbed.  Lo and behold...I heal their tanks a few times, this pulls a dusty <br/>\nwerebat and a few carrion ghouls onto me..and I zip to zone.  When I zone <br/>\nback later on...I get a tell asking me to join their party.  Not too shabby.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can solo in unrest...not that hard, and at 20..their is still stuff that <br/>\ngives you experience that is on floor one.

I&#39;d like to give props out to you all, and everyone on the<br/>\n&gt;eq-cleric forum at stratic. (if any of you do both of these)<br/>\n&gt;So far that forum and this list is easily, from what i&#39;ve seen, most of<br/>\n&gt;the maturist ppl in this game..mind you, there are always exceptions.<br/>\n&gt;Well anyways, I&#39;ve run into real life head on, and basically my playing<br/>\n&gt;time has become very short, to almost non existant.. :(<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m currently lvl 20, and am finding myself getting somewhat<br/>\n&gt;frustrated.  I have a few wizards in the group of ppl that I play with<br/>\n&gt;(all higher lvl though) and I am able to occasinoally go to multiple<br/>\n&gt;zones.  I&#39;m having an extremely tough time finding a group.  Now, I know<br/>\n&gt;my name has not been tarnished, unless it&#39;s been by an adolescent, so I<br/>\n&gt;rule that case out.  My friends say this is a tough time for a cleric to<br/>\n&gt;find groups because our heal spell isn&#39;t that effective (which I<br/>\n&gt;agree).  But, being the poor melee&#39;ers we are, I can&#39;t solo (one<br/>\n&gt;exception..If I can do 2 things..1) find undead available to kill 2)<br/>\n&gt;root holds).<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;ve been to unrest, lake rathe, oasis, bird citie (south karana? or<br/>\n&gt;north..can&#39;t remember), perma, and basically I never get tells back from<br/>\n&gt;anyone.  Now one thing I&#39;ve noticed is that the number of clerics has<br/>\n&gt;risen, and groups will often tell me, &#39;sorry, we already have a<br/>\n&gt;cleric&#39;.  And I&#39;m not sure why they wouldn&#39;t want another one! Oh well,<br/>\n&gt;I throw that away assuming they are playing their first character.<br/>\n&gt;Anyways, I was basically just looking for a place to hunt and that I can<br/>\n&gt;easily get a group.  It sucks when you might have 2 hours to play a<br/>\n&gt;week, and you spend 1 hour advertising for a group...<br/>\n&gt;Or is it possibly I&#39;m going to have to do my best to find a place to<br/>\n&gt;solo undead for 4 levels?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Any and all help would be appreciated.<br/>\n&gt;TIA<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Evertorn<br/>\n&gt;20th lvl erudite cleric<br/>\n&gt;Veeshan<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&lt;&lt; text3.html &gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
