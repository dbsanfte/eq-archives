Probably not, as you don&#39;t actually earn anything, oh well.<br/>\nTailoring and Jewelcrafting would be my favorite two, followed by baking, then<br/>\nbrewing.  Fletching was a pet project of my ranger awhile ago, I&#39;ll never go<br/>\nthrough that again.  The costs of getting a 75 int ranger to skill 200 took<br/>\nabout 1/2 of what it cost to get to 200 in jewel crafting (I don&#39;t have any<br/>\ncharacters that JC, but a friend and I compared costs involved), which is about<br/>\n200 times as much as getting to 150 in brewing and baking combined!<br/>\n<br/>\nAilamil Faithbringer<br/>\nTarew Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
