It does seem to me that most<br/>\n&gt; spells do not affect NPCs.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I tried healing a guard that was fighting a dark elf<br/>\n&gt; in freeport, and the guards life did not move. I tried<br/>\n&gt; healing him like four times without any sucess. This<br/>\n&gt; would also go along with my experience killing dark<br/>\n&gt; elf guards. Seems for some reason, people take offense<br/>\n&gt; to me killing their guards. :) The solution is that I<br/>\n&gt; occasionally have a dragoon trained on me. Since I am<br/>\n&gt; only level 20, it would be easier for a dark elf<br/>\n&gt; cleric to just heal the corporal until I died.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The other side is I have heard of people casting see<br/>\n&gt; invisible on NPC guards and having them attack invis<br/>\n&gt; players. Also seems that other people have had success<br/>\n&gt; healing NPCs as they are fighting kill stealers.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; so, the question I guess I have is what buff spells<br/>\n&gt; work on NPCs and what spells do not?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Eylena 20th circle no last name priestess of Tunare.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; =====<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
