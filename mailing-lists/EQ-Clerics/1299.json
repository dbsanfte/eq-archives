As<br/>\nfor the price issue, I had a guildmate trade one straight up for a Cold Iron<br/>\nMorning Star, and have seen them go sometimes for around 100pp.  Getting the<br/>\nSSoL was not nearly something easy for me, as I play a dwarven cleric and<br/>\nhad to work for about 6 played hours on getting my faction to an acceptable<br/>\npoint to where I could even get the quest.  That&#39;s why in some areas, you<br/>\ncould get quite a high price for it.  I&#39;ve also noticed that the SSoL will<br/>\neither speed up or remove root-type effects, as I&#39;ve gotten lucky a few<br/>\ntimes in Unrest and the cleanse has gone off after beeing rooted by a ghoul<br/>\nor carrion ghoul, and allowed me to move again.  Maybe it was just<br/>\nincredible timing.  *shrug*<br/>\n<br/>\nLohre Soulsaver<br/>\nBristlebane<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Marquardt, Kris L. &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Kris_Marquardt@...\">Kris_Marquardt@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, September 13, 1999 10:18 AM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [EQ-Clerics] Hmm..trying to get back to cleric questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Marquardt, Kris L.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Kris_Marquardt@...\">Kris_Marquardt@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have never had to have my SSoL &quot;recharged&quot; and I have had it for some<br/>\n&gt; time.

LOL i am a human cleric and had<br/>\n&gt; no troule doing said quest, in fact it was one of the easier ones i have<br/>\n&gt; done.  Now for my question, what exactly does clense do?  I was under the<br/>\n&gt; impression that it took of negitive effects on the player, tho it always<br/>\n&gt; seems to clense me when i dont need it, and there are only 30 charges on<br/>\nit.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   I have no clue how to get it recharged.  I am a lvl 24 cleric on Xegony,<br/>\n&gt; and am now using a screaming mace which i perfer, the SSoL was nice, fast,<br/>\n&gt; and consistant in the amount of damg it did, but the effect was wasted on<br/>\nmy<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; toon as i never seem to get many neg effects on me.  Suffice it to say I<br/>\n&gt; gave my SSoL to a noobie that was begging, LOL he loved it and i was happy<br/>\n&gt; to help, as far as what it is worth, i have no clue as i would pay nothing<br/>\n&gt; over 20p for it and thats going above the value to me.  It&#39;s prob worth<br/>\nalot<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; to ppl who want them badly and less to others that don&#39;t.   just INHO,<br/>\nstay<br/>\n&gt; safe and have fun<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Deane, Ben&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:BDeane@...\">BDeane@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Clerics@onelist.com\">EQ-Clerics@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;Subject: RE: [EQ-Clerics] Hmm..trying to get back to cleric questions.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Date: Mon, 13 Sep 1999 08:06:18 -0700<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Deane, Ben&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:BDeane@...\">BDeane@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;The SSoL is a funny thing. It is probably worth more than it seems.<br/>\nSimilar<br/>\n&gt; &gt;weapons for pure casters (e.g. Water Crystal staff) I&#39;ve seen selling for<br/>\n&gt; &gt;100pp+. The SSoL is basically a mediocre weapon, but with a pretty useful<br/>\n&gt; &gt;effect. Many clerics cannot do the quest (or don&#39;t want to spend time<br/>\n&gt; &gt;building faction). To them, it may be fairly desirable.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I traded my first one to a lvl 30 Teir&#39;dal cleric in return for a pair of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;crested spaulders (AC11, +6sta), and I think I got the better deal. So I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;would say: make your way over to East Commons or Nektulos and you may get<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; &gt;good price.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Elbeno<br/>\n&gt; &gt;16 times blessed by Karana<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Bristlebane<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: Trizzen Do&#39;Trevan [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:trizzen@...\">trizzen@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [EQ-Clerics] Hmm..trying to get back to cleric questions.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Second: I know that prices very greatly from server to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; server, but what<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sort of price range am I looking at if I want to sell my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; shinig star of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; light mace? around 20pp, around 100pp??
