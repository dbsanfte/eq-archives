Our specialty is healing, others are DD, shaman and druids<br/>\nDOT, enchanters do crowd control, shaman and enchanters debuff.  If you were to<br/>\nuse a combination casting and tanking on a level 35+ MOB, you&#39;d be beaten down<br/>\npretty quick.  This is not only true for us, but for melee classes too.<br/>\n<br/>\nRangers get it a little better off- they can snare and run backwards shooting<br/>\narrows into the thing (Ranger kiting).  Clerics become a &quot;Root N Nuke&quot; caster<br/>\nfor soloing at the higher levels, much like the wizard.  I can solo a SG or HG<br/>\npretty easily (past level 44) but I won&#39;t melee it (okay, it was almost dead and<br/>\nI wanted to raise my 2hb skill a little- lol)  No melee class (unless they have<br/>\nPoF weapons and armor) can solo these things- they just hit too hard.   Double<br/>\nand triple attacks for 80-90 damage is just too much even for a warrior to stand<br/>\nup against.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, take a warrior and a cleric- put them together and they can take 3-4 giants<br/>\nin the time it takes a cleric to solo one.  Very efficient and good for the exp<br/>\nbar :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAilamil Faithbringer<br/>\nTarew Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
