When I first got the spell at 14 I was doing max of 89 <br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;now at 15 it is up to 90.  I know that the damage is therefore a little<br/>\n&gt;dependent on age.   Does wisdom or any other stat have some impact on the<br/>\n&gt;maximum damage that we can do?  I am really tempted to remove my few wisdom<br/>\n&gt;enhancing items to see if it drops but then again if it is based on natural<br/>\n&gt;wisdom then this would not tell me anything at all.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Well I am off to see if I can make it 16th again.   Some advice to all.  Do<br/>\n&gt;not let an air elemental ambush you as you are running to retrieve your<br/>\n&gt;body.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Yilari<br/>\n&gt;Erollisi Marr<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&lt;&lt; text3.html &gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
