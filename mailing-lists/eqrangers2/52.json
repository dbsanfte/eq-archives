It doesn&#39;t hit for<br/>\nas much as the axe, but is magical and so makes<br/>\nshort work of Willowisps. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I really like the axe<br/>\nbecause its delay is short but long enough that I can<br/>\ncast the fire spell or snare usually without<br/>\ninteruption.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
