I<br/>\nstarted there as a young level 8 Ranger and stayed until<br/>\nI made level 17. Take the time to get to know the<br/>\nlay of the land and you will see that actually it is<br/>\na very easy area to get around in, track comes in<br/>\nreal handy to stay out of trouble. If you are in the<br/>\nGFay area now then Butcher Block or Steamfont<br/>\nMountains will be a great place to hunt. Both places are<br/>\nsimilar to Everfrost. Lots of canyons and<br/>\nmountains.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keban Arrowsmith&lt;Royal Fletchers&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ranger of<br/>\nSurefall Glade (Brell)&lt;br&gt;Ranger of 22 Seasons&lt;br&gt;Master<br/>\nFletcher&lt;br&gt;Ranger of Surefall Glade</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
