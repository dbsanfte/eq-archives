The exp and loot is great.<br/>\nMake sure you are invis for the run from FV to LOIO<br/>\nbecause the spiders are red and mean even to a lvl 31.<br/>\nGet some maps so you can have an idea how to get to<br/>\nLOIO and also where to hunt. South side of the lake is<br/>\nusually not crowded, also near the FM zone is good<br/>\nbecause if you get into trouble someone is usually there<br/>\nto help or you can just zone. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keban<br/>\nArrowsmith&lt;br&gt;31 Ranger &lt;br&gt;Grand Master Fletcher (202)&lt;br&gt;Brell<br/>\nSerilis</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
