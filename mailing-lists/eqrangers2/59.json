I too<br/>\npursue my adventure in Norrath on Torv!.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I<br/>\nstarted on the fletching trade, but have found archery to<br/>\nbe cumbersome and frustrating in general (too much<br/>\nstuff to cart around) and had a great time with a stack<br/>\nof Shuriken I bought in Western Karana.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a<br/>\nhuman Ranger, I cut my teeth in the hills outside<br/>\nQeynos, then expended some rage on those pesky gnolls in<br/>\nthe Burrow. Visited the big folks to the North, but<br/>\ntheir land is too dark and the ways too twisting at<br/>\nnight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since the plague took hold of the central plains, I<br/>\nhave hunted in the Karanas. This proved to be an<br/>\nexcellent locale to hunt and contemplate, as there were<br/>\nrarely others around to disturb my enjoyment of the<br/>\ngreat expanses. There are also many friendly wolves and<br/>\nbears to see.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After an inept group of fellow<br/>\nhunters cost be life and limb taking on a horde of<br/>\nbandits, I decided to venture East and see other lands.<br/>\nAfter a dangerous crossing of Highpass in great haste<br/>\nof foot, I eventually reached Freeport and boarded a<br/>\nvessel for a day&#39;s sail to Faydwer. I am looking for a<br/>\ncache of weapons I heard rumor of (OOC: I died a<br/>\nhorrible death in Steamfont; must get back that Velium<br/>\nSword!), and then will collect Orc Belts for the friendly<br/>\nWarriors in Kelethin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stormhugh, Ranger of the 11th<br/>\nMonsoon, worshipper of Karana&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(also steward of 5th<br/>\nlevel gnome wiz Yenumstorm)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
