<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-220454393">for all you newbies that are looking for a good<br/>
weapon under lvl 30 that is basically FREE. Get some<br/>
help hunting the ghoul messenger in WK to get the<br/>
letter off of him. turn the letter into Morin(can&#39;t<br/>
remember his full name)in Kithkor forest and get the sword<br/>
in return. It&#39;s ranger only, lore and no drop, so<br/>
there really isn&#39;t any price on it. it&#39;s 6 atk, 22<br/>
delay, +3 str , and I think the last one is +3 wis or<br/>
agi. I was lucky enough to get mine at lvl 12(a kind<br/>
ranger already had his and I was at the right place at<br/>
the right time) and I still use it at lvl 41. I&#39;ve<br/>
had it for 2 years now, i&#39;ve grown pretty attached to<br/>
it. I&#39;m currently looking to finally replace it with<br/>
something better, but I like to work for my stuff, not buy<br/>
it (unless it&#39;s player crafted). &lt;br&gt;so for all you<br/>
newbies, get the SSOM. if they were actually able to be<br/>
sold, they would probably run at least 1kpp. So get<br/>
one, it&#39;s free.</div>
