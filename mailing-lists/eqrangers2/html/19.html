<div id="ygrps-yiv-210816624">Hi Gaeleyen,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I try to carry both if i can,<br/>
depending on weather I&#39;m looting or not. I find that I just<br/>
never know what the situation is going to be as I&#39;m on<br/>
at different hours each time I play.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Actually<br/>
as a ranger I sort of feel like i should be prepared<br/>
for almost anything. If I&#39;m just going out for exp. I<br/>
carry a twohanded, a onehanded and shield, big bow,<br/>
small bow, lots of arrows, and food/water. This keeps<br/>
me just below full weight, and I usually try to get<br/>
some big oaf to carry my food and water for<br/>
me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s incredible isn&#39;t it how much setting up one has<br/>
to do in order to prepare, and all you really want<br/>
to do is slay, slay, slay.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can anyone tell me<br/>
of a good area to get from 15-20 without too much<br/>
difficulty? And please don&#39;t suggest Black Burrough, that<br/>
place is murder/suicide!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Happy hunting )&#39;&lt;br&gt;Rik<br/>
