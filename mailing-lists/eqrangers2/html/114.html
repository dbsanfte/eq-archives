<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1625894102">At 34 I was killing chickens in Overthere... It&#39;s<br/>
not the most fun, but you can rack up the Exp pretty<br/>
quick. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It seems like OOT was really when groups<br/>
started to take on the advanced level<br/>
characteristics...People were figuring out how to chain pull with a<br/>
chanter mezzing, cleric healing and the all too popular<br/>
shout &quot;Donating for Exp Rez&quot; is heard occasionally<br/>
throughout the zone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for me, I would<br/>
concentrate on finding a good place to fear kite. I recently<br/>
re-discovered this little trick and leveled from 46 to 49 in<br/>
Emerald Jungle in about a week (playing about 5 hours a<br/>
night).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cya&lt;br&gt;Tetzu</div>
