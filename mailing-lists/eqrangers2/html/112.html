<div id="ygrps-yiv-1916341215">I made my first Trueshot last night. I scraped<br/>
together enough materials to make 10. Was I shocked when I<br/>
did it on the first try with a fletching of 148. I<br/>
sold that one to a guildmate of mine and made another<br/>
one on my next try. Hardest part of making this<br/>
sucker is getting the microservos from the clockworks in<br/>
Steamfont. I ran around there for 2 hours and only 4<br/>
dropped. Just enough to make 2. Great bow by the way.<br/>
First shot with it I criticalled for<br/>
