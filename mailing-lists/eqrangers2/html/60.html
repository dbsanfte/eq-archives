<div id="ygrps-yiv-500834997">BrewMAJ number one I see you are from Phoenix, I<br/>
live in Prescott Valley. To answer a couple of your<br/>
questions. The fletching skill does not have a level cap so<br/>
someone that is lvl 1 with enough pp can level to 200+.<br/>
My fletching skill is now 183. It takes time and<br/>
hundreds and hundreds of arrows to level. I have made a<br/>
few bows but these were for fellow rangers that I<br/>
wanted to help out. I made my Trueshot after 3 weeks of<br/>
work gathering the materials and 25 tries with my<br/>
fletching around 155. My next bow will be a darkwood of<br/>
some kind. Having the book open may or may not help<br/>
but if it might help it doesn&#39;t hurt to have it open.<br/>
My WIS is higher than my INT but they are both above<br/>
100 with buffs so I am pretty successfull when I make<br/>
the 150 range 6 damage arrows I use in Lake Of Ill<br/>
Omen. Remember being a Ranger is being an archer. To be<br/>
an archer you need bows and arrows. I am on the<br/>
Brell server and I am Keban Arrowsmith if you play that<br/>
server send me a tell sometime. Ive been a Ranger for<br/>
about 8 Months now and am only lvl 22 (Just got it last<br/>
nite) mainly because leveling is not the important<br/>
thing for me in the game. I like to travel and I<br/>
practice my trades, Brewing (Master Drunk, Average<br/>
Brewer), Fletching (183), starting baking and tailoring.<br/>
Its a big world out there so no mater what you style<br/>
of play just have a great time. Sorry for the long<br/>
winded ramble just my 2cps.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keban Arrowsmith<br/>
