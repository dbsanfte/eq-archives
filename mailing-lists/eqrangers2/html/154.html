<b>Subject:</b> RANGERS SUCK!! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-643844980">Hello Fellow Rangers,&lt;br&gt; Hahaha, I knew I&#39;d get<br/>
somebody&#39;s attention! Anybody ever hear this while on. Cause<br/>
I do..:P I play on the Rallos Zek server..anyone<br/>
else? Or at least on another PvP server? Boy it sucks.<br/>
A lot of ppl tend to say that rangers can&#39;t PvP,<br/>
but of course, I think they don&#39;t know anything. I<br/>
actually belong to an Anti-pk guild. So I get attacked<br/>
quite often. Well recently I haven&#39;t, cause around the<br/>
30&#39;s..it just doesn&#39;t seem to happen. *shrugs*, I really<br/>
don&#39;t know why it doesn&#39;t. And about the rangers suck,<br/>
I definetely know if your twinked, (and I&#39;m sure<br/>
TWINK is not an unfamiliar word for those of you that<br/>
don&#39;t play on a PvP server), you can really kick some<br/>
butt. But even if you&#39;re not twinked, you can. As long<br/>
as you attack 1st. I just found it interesting how<br/>
people just LUV to hate rangers. I think it&#39;s cause<br/>
they&#39;re jealous. Or maybe the fact that they don&#39;t have<br/>
the ability to play one. hehe. I&#39;m just writing this,<br/>
to get something posted, cause I&#39;m bored. And to get<br/>
some conversation going. And maybe to meet a fellow<br/>
ranger. Hopefully not a Pking ranger tho. I&#39;m not fond of<br/>
those. I guess I&#39;m a pker anyhow. Cause I attack back at<br/>
the pkers who attack me. FOr my subject line..just<br/>
for the record..in case you didn&#39;t get in the rest of<br/>
the msg, I don&#39;t think rangers suck. I also dont&#39;<br/>
think any class sucks at all. I get fairly annoyed when<br/>
ppl shout that a class sucks. But what can ya do<br/>
right? just ignore and go on with your activities. Well<br/>
thanks for listening to my ramble. And all take<br/>
care!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Allyssea Wolfeshadow&lt;br&gt;37th season, Rallos Zek server.</div>
