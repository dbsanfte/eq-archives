<div id="ygrps-yiv-1682700221">Let&#39;s get this club rolling! I&#39;ll try to help<br/>
with my view on fletching.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I just passed<br/>
fletching 70 with my Level 10 Ranger. Fletching is one of<br/>
those trade skills where all you need is money to get<br/>
your level to rise. I have alternate characters with<br/>
various trade skills over 100. None over 200<br/>
yet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I find what really helps getting skill levels to<br/>
rise is persistence and intelligence. You should only<br/>
try various skills that are trivial at about 5-10<br/>
over your current level. Any higher than that, and you<br/>
will be wasting $$.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I fletch while medding. I<br/>
haven&#39;t made any bows yet. I primarily fletch for the<br/>
arrows. I also made a 6-slot quiver with 22% weight<br/>
reduction using tailoring skill. Quivers are handy. They<br/>
give you autoloading.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One problem I&#39;ve had with<br/>
fletching (archery in general) is finding supplies when<br/>
traveling. You need to do your home work before you<br/>
travel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I would like to hear (on this club) about what<br/>
others are up to in Ranger hood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brewcamper -<br/>
