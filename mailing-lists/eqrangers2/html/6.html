<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-657698119">You know, I had so much fun when I went as a<br/>
newbie to Mathin&#39;s wedding that I was thinking that if a<br/>
new server opens up shortly, wouldn&#39;t it be fun to<br/>
create characters on that server and play there at least<br/>
once a week, on a schedule, simply to be in touch<br/>
within Norrath itself? I am not suggesting anything as<br/>
outrageous as dedicating ourselves to these new characters,<br/>
just that it would be fun to actually be in the same<br/>
world with all the people we have contributing at the<br/>
posts...</div>
