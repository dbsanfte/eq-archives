<div id="ygrps-yiv-685703063">Hiya Davey,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Best advice is to get to 47<br/>
before ya hit the planes. Like I said before, dont hunt<br/>
PoG, there are some very nice ranger quests to be done<br/>
there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for Velious, faction there is very important. I<br/>
would stick with dwarf and dragon faction. The best<br/>
quests in the game are probably coming out of Temple of<br/>
Veeshan. So, dont hunt Velious dragons. The Kael quest<br/>
armor is the best but ally faction with the giants is<br/>
tough to get.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When ya hit the planes goto fear,<br/>
hate, and air. get as much experience as ya can. Also<br/>
some nice ranger goodies on all those planes<br/>
now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good luck.</div>
