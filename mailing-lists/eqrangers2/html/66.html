<div id="ygrps-yiv-1437090375">Thanks a bunch for the advice. I had been<br/>
wondering which factions to align with in Velious. Thusfar,<br/>
I&#39;ve been camping in FM & OOT trying to build up the<br/>
bank account & get quick exp. I&#39;m 38 now (just dinged<br/>
last night) and am wondering where I should hunt after<br/>
I hit 39 (new spellz - Woot!) I&#39;m pretty balanced<br/>
with all of my weapon skills at least 180, casting<br/>
skills are all pretty close to maxed as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Any<br/>
suggestions on where to hunt & what quests I should be<br/>
working on?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks,&lt;br&gt;Tetzu &lt;br&gt;Morell-Thule</div>
