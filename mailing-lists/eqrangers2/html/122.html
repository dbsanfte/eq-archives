<div id="ygrps-yiv-35632521">Welcome to Norrath! I hope you have alot of fun.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;Quick problem that just came up today- the new<br/>
expansion that everyone has been waiting for has major high<br/>
requirements so if you have an older computer or a lousy<br/>
accelerator than don&#39;t bother buying that one yet- suggest<br/>
checking out the official Luclin site for info on that--<br/>
&lt;a href=<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/luclin/sysreq.jsp">http://everquest.station.sony.com/luclin/sysreq.jsp</a> target=new&gt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/luclin/sysreq.jsp&lt;/a">http://everquest.station.sony.com/luclin/sysreq.jsp&lt;/a</a>&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On to why I responded to you:&lt;br&gt;What server are you<br/>
gonna use? That makes a difference. If you want to play<br/>
PvP there are servers set up for it. If you are<br/>
strictly roleplayer there is one for that but I don&#39;t<br/>
recommend that one for a raw newbie. Actually I don&#39;t think<br/>
a newbie should try the Pvp ones either- takes some<br/>
time to figure out how to play well. If you want some<br/>
help from me I&#39;m on Bristlebane server, look me<br/>
up.&lt;br&gt;As to what race to choose? I&#39;m a wood elf so I&#39;m a<br/>
little biased about that one. Wood elfs get night vision<br/>
and 50 lvl forage and hide at lvl 1. (forage rocks -<br/>
free food and items) just make sure you use some of<br/>
the creation points in strength you&#39;ll be sorry if<br/>
you don&#39;t.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Best Wishes&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bebinn &lt;br&gt;18<br/>
