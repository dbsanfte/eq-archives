<div id="ygrps-yiv-1953438950">You can start you trueshot quest anytime, getting<br/>
all the necessary stuff together. Try to start with a<br/>
stack of all components (20). Some have said that they<br/>
succeded on the first try at with a fletch of less than<br/>
100 but from my own experience it took me 3 weeks of<br/>
time, and 30 tries before I got mine. It is very long<br/>
and sometimes discouraging but when you finally make<br/>
it WOW it felt great. The most time consuming part<br/>
is the number of clockworks you need to<br/>
kill.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keban Arrowsmith&lt;br&gt;Grand Master Fletcher (202)</div>
