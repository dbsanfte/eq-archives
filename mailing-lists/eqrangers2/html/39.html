<div id="ygrps-yiv-601236362">Hail all my fellow Rangers. I am a level 15 HEF<br/>
on the Brell server. I have spent my last 5 lvls in<br/>
Everfrost and am now ready to get out into the world for<br/>
some new adventures. I know the area from W Karans and<br/>
all of Qeynos to Everfrost but want to see the world.<br/>
Any suggestions on a good area would be appreciated.<br/>
Everfrost provided lots of ops for money making if you have<br/>
not been there its worth the trip and has great<br/>
hunting. If you are on Brell send me a tell and we can<br/>
swap war stories.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keban&lt;br&gt;Ranger of Surefall<br/>
