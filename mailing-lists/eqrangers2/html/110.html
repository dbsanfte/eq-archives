<div id="ygrps-yiv-1846926524">OK, Here&#39;s my take on this..&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When in a<br/>
full group with a legitimate tank, a Ranger is<br/>
supposed to be dealing out damage without drawing hate so<br/>
you don&#39;t turn into a mana sponge for the healer. For<br/>
this, I switch to a 2 hander (currently I&#39;m using a<br/>
Nature&#39;s Fury). I know this isn&#39;t as sexy as sporting 2<br/>
lammy&#39;s but it keeps my health in the red and my healer<br/>
happy. I guess one exception to this would be a<br/>
Wurmslayer cause it has such a high delay that it&#39;s like<br/>
carrying a 2hander.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When you are acting as a tank,<br/>
the 1 handers are the way to go. As a general rule,<br/>
the faster the better, the lowest delay in the off<br/>
hand. Lammy and Lupine Dagger are UUber until you get a<br/>
swiftwind. Anything that procs will only help in keeping the<br/>
hate. Admittedly, I don&#39;t have the greatest 1 handers<br/>
yet (Wurm Tendon whip 12/26 I think and a Yak Club<br/>
9/24) but I&#39;m camping the Lupine until I get one).<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another circumstance is when you are fighting a caster<br/>
mob. I have found that the lowest delay weapons<br/>
possible are the best, just to interrupt more. This is<br/>
really evident when you are fighting a cleric mob with<br/>
Complete Heal. Nothing is more frustrating than almost<br/>
killing the stupid thing and Bam! back to full health.<br/>
When you have call of sky cast on yourself and a DEX<br/>
buff from a shammy, watch out! Proc and interrupt<br/>
