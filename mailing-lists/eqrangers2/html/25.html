<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1747978813">I was gifted with a Hunting Bow and some arrows,<br/>
then taught how to use them. I then read about<br/>
fletching kits and such, and finally found one. I&#39;ve<br/>
started making my own arrows, and successfully made a<br/>
rough oak bow with a hemp string the first try. You can<br/>
buy bows and arrows at fletchers shops in Kelethin (2<br/>
shops, and one outside merchant). Buy a fletching kit,<br/>
then make your own stuff, it s cheaper. Check out the<br/>
files on the Allakazam site for some REAL good<br/>
info.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alfric&lt;br&gt;4th Lvl Ranger&lt;br&gt;Kelethin&lt;br&gt;The Nameless</div>
