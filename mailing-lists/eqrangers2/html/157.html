<div id="ygrps-yiv-1877435310">Do you use our little nuke with the arrows? I<br/>
tried a tundra mam for the first time and boy do they<br/>
have a lot of HP. Had to zone into IC before I died<br/>
was down to 1 1/2 bub and the mam only was down about<br/>
1/3. The **** thing resisted 4 of my panics in a row<br/>
before I got one to stick then I ran for the zone. I try<br/>
to stick to woolies, cougars, wolfs and such which<br/>
are still blue to me at lvl 43. I usually stick to<br/>
the south side of the bridge when I am solo. I have<br/>
not tried a hill giant yet but I think I will head to<br/>
NK or WK and see what I can do with my shadewood.<br/>
And as far as a snow griff goes I&#39;ll wait a couple of<br/>
lvls before I try one of them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keban Arrowsmith<br/>
