<div id="ygrps-yiv-1581896193">What do you all prefer in the way of bows. I<br/>
prefer the short delay and lower damage opposed to high<br/>
damage long delays. I feel this way because I group with<br/>
a druid and as he casts enveloping roots I pelt the<br/>
target with arrows. If I were in a larger group I would<br/>
think that the higher damage would be preferable for<br/>
pulling but this is just my<br/>
opinion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gaeleyen&lt;br&gt;2nd season Wood Elf Ranger</div>
