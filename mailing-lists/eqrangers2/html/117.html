<div id="ygrps-yiv-1606882213">Try going to everquestraids.com and joining that.<br/>
You don&#39;t have to pay for membership, tho it would<br/>
help keep the site going.&lt;br&gt;It is used by my guild on<br/>
the server I use(Bristlebane). But I have noticed<br/>
that not all servers get as much use out of it. The<br/>
concept is the guild or the player lists when and where<br/>
they want to raid and other players sign up and join<br/>
them. Each raid gets a log page for messages relating<br/>
to that raid.&lt;br&gt;I can&#39;t wait till I&#39;m high enough<br/>
to actually get some benefit from the<br/>
site.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Babinn&lt;br&gt;16 Ranger&lt;br&gt;Bristlebane</div>
