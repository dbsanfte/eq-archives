<div id="ygrps-yiv-809616326">Stormhugh, I too spent many a day and night in<br/>
the dark and twisting valleys of the ever cold land<br/>
to the north of Qeynos Hills known as Everfrost. I<br/>
started there as a young level 8 Ranger and stayed until<br/>
I made level 17. Take the time to get to know the<br/>
lay of the land and you will see that actually it is<br/>
a very easy area to get around in, track comes in<br/>
real handy to stay out of trouble. If you are in the<br/>
GFay area now then Butcher Block or Steamfont<br/>
Mountains will be a great place to hunt. Both places are<br/>
similar to Everfrost. Lots of canyons and<br/>
mountains.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keban Arrowsmith&lt;Royal Fletchers&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ranger of<br/>
