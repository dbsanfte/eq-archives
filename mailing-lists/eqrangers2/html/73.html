<div id="ygrps-yiv-884403123">Greetings everyone...&lt;br&gt;I&#39;m a 18 Ranger on<br/>
Bertoxx who recently acquired Dual Wield (Woo Hoo) and<br/>
planned for it. My two weaps are a Frozen LongSword and<br/>
Ebony Bladed LongSword and so far love them both. My<br/>
questions are:&lt;br&gt;1.) How do I increase the damage output<br/>
on these? Or it strength related only? Currently I<br/>
do 8-24 damage per hit with most in the 14-18<br/>
range.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2.) What is the best way to increase my chances of<br/>
critical hits? I only crit&#39;d twice with the blades (1 hs =<br/>
95) and I crit 1 out of 5 arrow shots (archery = 71).<br/>
Obviously Rangers are the ruling class when it comes to<br/>
bows, but in group play...I am in melee much<br/>
more...would love to be pulling more of my own weight rather<br/>
than depending on the Dwarven Warrior to bring em<br/>
down.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Does anyone have any<br/>
ideas?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanx!&lt;br&gt;Quynnelleon&lt;br&gt;Ranger (18)&lt;br&gt;Master Fletcher &lt;br&gt;Favored Target of<br/>
Festering Hags&lt;br&gt;Bertoxx</div>
