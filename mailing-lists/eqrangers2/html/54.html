<div id="ygrps-yiv-1050376237">Xanthar, Im not sure where you are but it sounds<br/>
like you are in QH. Try and find someone that is<br/>
selling a velium long sword or other magical wep similar<br/>
to this. /auction WTB 1hs magical not alot of pp<br/>
please help or something like this might get a response<br/>
from a friendly higher lvl. Don&#39;t beg but try to buy<br/>
from a player. If you can try to go to East Commons<br/>
outside of Freeport. They sell everything and anything<br/>
there and you can usually get a pretty good<br/>
deal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keban Arrowsmith &lt;Royal Fletchers&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ranger of<br/>
