<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-692234899">Well, I don&#39;t want to be contradictive, but the<br/>
Tolans Bracer drops in Sebilis a Kunark zone just off of<br/>
Trakanon&#39;s Teeth. If you thought Dreadlands was a nasty<br/>
zone... Seb&#39;s got it beat by a mile. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Luckily if<br/>
you are high enough level to get a Seb key and get<br/>
in, the camp that drops the bracer is considered one<br/>
of the easier spots in the zone. Required is a group<br/>
of 50+ at a minimum, with a good balance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;m<br/>
seriously eyeing one of these bad boyz for myself over the<br/>
next couple of weeks. Free, Unlimited arrows makes you<br/>
a kiting machine. Combine that with a Bow of the<br/>
Huntsman that procs 81dd and you are dealing some serious<br/>
range damage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tetzu&lt;br&gt;Pathfinder<br/>
