<div id="ygrps-yiv-266003647">There are a few good spots for Loot and leveling.<br/>
One of my favorites has been the Estate of Unrest.<br/>
This place is located off of Dagnor&#39;s Cauldron which<br/>
can be reached via Butcherblock Mountains Zone.<br/>
Dagnor&#39;s itself is very dangerous to be in at less than<br/>
lvl 20...as Aqua Gobbies are highly aggressive and<br/>
ruthless. Best path in I have found (until you get Camo) is<br/>
to enter Dagnor&#39;s and run to waters edge and run<br/>
along it until you get to far side (south end I<br/>
believe). Zone for Unrest is a large rectangluar opening in<br/>
the mountain wall.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unrest is basically a 3<br/>
story house with basement and a large yard that is host<br/>
to MANY undead. Trains are frequent and deadly here.<br/>
Get in a group...kill yard trash (Death beetles, Jack<br/>
o Lanterns, tormented Dead, and greater Skellies)<br/>
until you get to high teens. If you play wisely and<br/>
stay alert...you will level quickly here. Loot gets<br/>
better as you take on harder mobs and includes armor<br/>
pieces, much coin, gems, bronze weapons and misc stuff<br/>
like zombie skin and fungi that sells for a couple<br/>
gold to a plat each.&lt;br&gt;Everything aggros here so<br/>
don&#39;t move around much and stay close to walls.<br/>
Oh...you will die here...more than once...but the exp is<br/>
worth it IMHO.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Other places good for your level<br/>
is Lavastorm, Blackburrow, and<br/>
Befallen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trueshot quest can be done anytime...collect your items<br/>
now...and plenty of them. I would reccommend that you do<br/>
not try to mfg the bow until you get to skill of 140.<br/>
You can do at anytime, and I know those that have<br/>
succeeded with low fletching skills...just you failure rate<br/>
will be high.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good luck...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Quynnelleon<br/>
