<div id="ygrps-yiv-1865447544">Tolan&#39;s Bracer drops in Karnor&#39;s Castle in the<br/>
Dreadlands. Not a good place for a ranger if you are under<br/>
lvl 45. Mobs hit hard and are relentless...especially<br/>
if you use snare. It is doable if you get into a<br/>
&quot;good&quot; group and get a chance to loot it. The bracer<br/>
goes for 8-10k on Bertoxx server. Personally I prefer<br/>
to make my arrows for the situation...hi damage vs.<br/>
range (pulling).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For my level (51 ranger) my bow<br/>
skills are sub par (143). With a Runed Oak bow I<br/>
commonly hit for 50-110 damage with crits up to almost<br/>
200!&lt;br&gt;Needless to say, this renewed my enthusiasm for Archery.<br/>
The archery based spells help immensely too...see to<br/>
drastically increase my double damage hits. Also with the new<br/>
alt exp, rangers get huge boosts to bows. With<br/>
abilities that increase hits and damage to ablilities that<br/>
give you endless supplies of arrows. If you are a<br/>
ranger...work on Archery...period. It is one of our most<br/>
redeeming qualities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Quynnelleon&lt;br&gt;51st Ranger<br/>
