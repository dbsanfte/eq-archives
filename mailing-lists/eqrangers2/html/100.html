<div id="ygrps-yiv-470603847">Snare will consistently be your most valuable<br/>
spell in EQ as a ranger. It won&#39;t stop a creature in<br/>
it&#39;s tracks (unless it&#39;s almost dead), but will<br/>
significantly slow the mob down.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In groups, a ranger<br/>
should be snaring every mob. This not only helps when<br/>
retreating, but makes it harder for a mob to aggro on your<br/>
caster when he casts that big nuke and jumps to the top<br/>
of the hate list...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Later on you will get<br/>
root, which is good for different situations. It will<br/>
plant the mob in place, with a 10dd effect. Great for<br/>
chain pulling, bow kiting (used with snare too) and a<br/>
bunch of other stuff that you will figure out with<br/>
time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for sticking close to Faydwer, I would go out<br/>
adventuring, checking out new zones. You don&#39;t relly find out<br/>
the magnitude of EQ until you start travelling. Many<br/>
places you might want to visit are: Freeport-Eastern<br/>
Commons-South Ro combo (all close together), Qeynos<br/>
hills/Blacburrow/Everfrost (also close together) Toxx/Befallen etc...bunches<br/>
of places to see.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Have<br/>
fun&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tetzu&lt;br&gt;Morell-Thule</div>
