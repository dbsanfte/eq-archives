<div id="ygrps-yiv-38154428">Aye, and I have yet to see an older ranger refuse<br/>
to help a young ranger.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I got mine that way.<br/>
Nylan a damn fine lvl 55 ranger on The Tribunal helped<br/>
me out. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But you have to bring the map<br/>
yourself to Morin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Get a bind in Rivervale put all<br/>
your stuff in the bank (except from the map:-)) and go<br/>
to Morin naked. In daytime. A Tier&#39;dal Reaver is<br/>
close by and smokes you with two strikes. I not sure if<br/>
delivering the map to Morin makes the Reaver spawn. I got<br/>
killed. But it was a fair prize to pay for this excelent<br/>
sword:-))</div>
