<div id="ygrps-yiv-2043893062">Heyas, &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The stones are really easy to<br/>
spot. They show up on the white snow as bright (almost<br/>
neon) red. They are No drop, so you can&#39;t give them<br/>
away, but they are found lying on the ground to the<br/>
west & south of the Ry&#39;Gorr fort. BTW I&#39;m still using<br/>
the cloak at L39.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for stats, AC is king.<br/>
Ry&#39;Gorr seems to be the default favorite for pre Tolans,<br/>
but Ivy Etched is great for us too. Then you can<br/>
choose to work on STR, DEX or WIS. STR will help with<br/>
mele max damage & wieght issues, DEX will help with<br/>
archery, trade skills & hit accuracy in mele & Wis helps<br/>
with casting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here&#39;s a breakdown of my armor<br/>
today&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Head: Kylong War Helm&lt;br&gt;Shouder: Crested<br/>
Spaulders&lt;br&gt;Bracers: Hero & Scavengin&lt;br&gt;Arms: Ivy Etched&lt;br&gt;Legs:<br/>
Ry&#39;Gorr&lt;br&gt;Neck: Ry&#39;Gorr&lt;br&gt;Face: Platinum Silvered Ruby<br/>
Veil&lt;br&gt;Feet: Dwarven Work Boots&lt;br&gt;Ears: Forest<br/>
Loops&lt;br&gt;Rings: Jagged Bands&lt;br&gt;Chest: Ivy Etched Tunic&lt;br&gt;Waist:<br/>
Thick Banded Belt (Strawspun until yesterday<br/>
Woot!)&lt;br&gt;Cloak: Dire Wolf Fur Cloak&lt;br&gt;Gloves Iskar<br/>
Scaled&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some other good items that I&#39;ve worn in the past are:<br/>
Sarnak Emblazened Tabbard (chest), Golden Black Pearl<br/>
Choker, Cougar Claw & Orc Fang Earrings, Barbed Arm &<br/>
legplates, Sebilite Scale Boots, Thick Leather<br/>
Apron....blah, blah, blah&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There should be tons of<br/>
different stuff out there that you can use and afford. I<br/>
personally have the most fun questing to see if I can<br/>
constantly improve my weapons and armor. That&#39;s just what<br/>
floats my boat.....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Have fun!&lt;br&gt;Tetzu&lt;br&gt;39<br/>
Ranger &lt;br&gt;Master of Wandering<br/>
Around&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;P.S.&lt;br&gt;CHA & INT are almost completely unused by Rangers in<br/>
combat use. CHA helps when buying stuff from vendors<br/>
(not that much though) and INT helps you learn things<br/>
like languages (we are WIS based casters so it&#39;s not<br/>
important)</div>
