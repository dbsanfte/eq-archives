<div id="ygrps-yiv-1016334808">Hey all...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lately I have been looking to<br/>
upgrade weapons to something that damages a bit more and<br/>
am looking for suggestions from those of you who<br/>
have field tested a few different things. To give an<br/>
idea what I need, me explain my playing arena... Most<br/>
of the time I am in a small group that includes me<br/>
(ranger), a cleric, and a wizard all of the same level (37<br/>
ATM). When in this group I am tank and taunter...I need<br/>
weapons that hit hard and fast and get the mobs attention<br/>
away from my healer and nuker. The other times...I<br/>
play as a &quot;floater&quot; of sorts...keeping an eye on<br/>
everyone and peeling mobs off of casters when<br/>
needed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My current array of weapons that I carry with me<br/>
are: Velium Short Blade 10/24, Electrum Bladed<br/>
Wakizashi 7/21, Icetooth Claws 11/29, and a Wraith Bone<br/>
Hammer 8/26 I have been looking at getting an SSOY<br/>
(short sword of Ykesha) but have gotten conflicting<br/>
reports on it. Seems that some poo-poo it as just okay<br/>
and others swear by it. What I want to know is if any<br/>
of you have one of these and what you think about<br/>
it...and if you reccommend anything better. Currently my<br/>
budget is 1200pp&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Any help or suggestions would be<br/>
appreciated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Quynnelleon &lt;SWORN&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ranger of 37 Seasons&lt;br&gt;Bertoxx</div>
