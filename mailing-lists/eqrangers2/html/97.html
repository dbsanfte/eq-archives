<div id="ygrps-yiv-2029135721">I&#39;ve found that on some creatures snare has to be<br/>
cast at least twice to stop them in thier tracks.<br/>
Makes it hard on me since i&#39;m still low lvl but I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t go after something like a msstadon. &lt;br&gt;I&#39;m a<br/>
woodelf so I stick close to Faydwer still. I have yet to<br/>
see Qeynos on my own but other characters that my<br/>
family have are up in the icy parts of Antonica so I<br/>
know what it looks like at least.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bebinn &lt;br&gt;10<br/>
