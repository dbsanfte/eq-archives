<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1876090478">Funny you should mention this quest...I had just<br/>
found out about it yesterday whilst cruizing thru<br/>
Allakhazam. The MQ Dire Wolf Fur seems easy enough to come<br/>
by, but the skinning stones seem to be the trick. Are<br/>
these stones No Drop? And are they easy enought to<br/>
spot? This cloak seems like it would really fit nicely<br/>
in my ensemble of equipment. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After your<br/>
response to my last post, I decided to try and get equip<br/>
that boosts STR and DEX to assist in melee and kiting.<br/>
Other than this cloak, what other items would you<br/>
suggest for leggings, waist, and arms that a 22 Ranger<br/>
can hope to successfully quest? I have the bone plate<br/>
arms now that add +5 STR, but they also have -4<br/>
DEX...a hindrance, so would like to replace them. Was<br/>
having a blast collecting Faydark Armor in Firiona Vie,<br/>
alas, it only enhances CHA...a stat that means little<br/>
to me. While I like the rich green color, I more<br/>
thoroughly enjoy gifting it to bards...if only to add chaos<br/>
to the color scheme of their wardrobe<br/>
