<b>Subject:</b> Hi from a newbie <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1934339925">Hi all! I&#39;m new to RPGs in general but I&#39;m having<br/>
lots of fun playing Everquest. I&#39;m a 9th lvl female<br/>
woodelf on the Bristlebane server named Bebinn. How many<br/>
female rangers are there? &lt;br&gt;I was doing good, just got<br/>
my spells, had much armor and a good amount of money<br/>
(not a whole lot, i don&#39;t go around begging) when I<br/>
died AGAIN!!!!!. Gawd, this game is frustrating. I<br/>
love it tho, my whole family is addicted.&lt;br&gt;Anybody<br/>
have any good advice? Where to go, where not to go? I<br/>
don&#39;t group up much so I need some advice about things<br/>
I can do by myself. Any info on quests would be<br/>
greatly appreciated. &lt;br&gt;Look me up on Bristlebane<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bebinn</div>
