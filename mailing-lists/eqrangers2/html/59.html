<div id="ygrps-yiv-2019008154">Stormhugh, Ranger of the 11th Monsoon here. I too<br/>
pursue my adventure in Norrath on Torv!.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I<br/>
started on the fletching trade, but have found archery to<br/>
be cumbersome and frustrating in general (too much<br/>
stuff to cart around) and had a great time with a stack<br/>
of Shuriken I bought in Western Karana.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a<br/>
human Ranger, I cut my teeth in the hills outside<br/>
Qeynos, then expended some rage on those pesky gnolls in<br/>
the Burrow. Visited the big folks to the North, but<br/>
their land is too dark and the ways too twisting at<br/>
night.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since the plague took hold of the central plains, I<br/>
have hunted in the Karanas. This proved to be an<br/>
excellent locale to hunt and contemplate, as there were<br/>
rarely others around to disturb my enjoyment of the<br/>
great expanses. There are also many friendly wolves and<br/>
bears to see.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After an inept group of fellow<br/>
hunters cost be life and limb taking on a horde of<br/>
bandits, I decided to venture East and see other lands.<br/>
After a dangerous crossing of Highpass in great haste<br/>
of foot, I eventually reached Freeport and boarded a<br/>
vessel for a day&#39;s sail to Faydwer. I am looking for a<br/>
cache of weapons I heard rumor of (OOC: I died a<br/>
horrible death in Steamfont; must get back that Velium<br/>
Sword!), and then will collect Orc Belts for the friendly<br/>
Warriors in Kelethin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stormhugh, Ranger of the 11th<br/>
Monsoon, worshipper of Karana&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(also steward of 5th<br/>
level gnome wiz Yenumstorm)</div>
