<b>Subject:</b> Re: RANGERS SUCK!! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1624133878">I&#39;m a Ranger on Fennin Ro and I suffer the same<br/>
Ranger-bashing. Recently on a Vox raid I heard one of the worst<br/>
anti-Ranger jokes ever: How do we know Jesus was a Ranger? It<br/>
only took 2 nails to kill him. Almost walked out of<br/>
the raid (also due to the offensive religious<br/>
connotations). But in the end, the raid failed and who was the<br/>
last melee to fall? ME!!! The only Rangers that suck<br/>
are the ones that don&#39;t know how to play them. I<br/>
sucked at first, but now I think I&#39;m pretty good. Solo,<br/>
we&#39;re limited to fighting animals or weaker mobs that<br/>
can be kited with the good ol&#39; bow and arrow (like<br/>
Hill Giants, hehe). We&#39;re not made to take a hit so<br/>
the target is best kept at a distance where they<br/>
can&#39;t hurt you. Past level 22, when we get Panic<br/>
Animal, we can go it alone.&lt;br&gt;Ever wondered what it&#39;s<br/>
like to fight a Ranger? Fear/kite a snow griffin in<br/>
Eastern Wastes. Damage shields, low-level druid nukes,<br/>
and they&#39;re FAST.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Linolwen Spiritchaser<br/>
