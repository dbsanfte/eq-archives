<div id="ygrps-yiv-236356008">Hee hee. Welcome to the game. Ranger is a good<br/>
choice of character, altho you&#39;ll find yourself spoiled<br/>
if you start up a new character. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn to<br/>
use the consider function (&quot;C&quot; key or right click<br/>
after left clicking a potential enemy), and learn to do<br/>
it from a safe distance. Things which are &quot;ready to<br/>
attack&quot; are best steered clear from at low levels, even<br/>
if they appear even to you, because they often have<br/>
friends which are also ready to attack you when your back<br/>
is turned and you are busy whipping the first one.<br/>
Also learn how to /loc yourself when you are getting<br/>
beat on so you can easily retrieve your stuff and loot<br/>
if you do die.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Practice TRACK and SENSE<br/>
HEADING as much as you can, TRACK especially is a<br/>
valuable tool later and makes your ranger very welcome in<br/>
groups as you level up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can&#39;t say much about the<br/>
hunting where wood elves grow up, I am a human ranger and<br/>
so have hunted the Qeynos and Western Karana area<br/>
during my adolescence. Good luck to ya, if you ever<br/>
start a new character check out Torvonilous, its a<br/>
great server.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stormhugh&lt;br&gt;Ranger of the 11th<br/>
