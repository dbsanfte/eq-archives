<div id="ygrps-yiv-1029938658">I think you hit the point about rangers, those<br/>
that dont like rangers dont know how to play them.<br/>
Even on a non PVP server, Cazic-Thule, knowing what to<br/>
do in a group and solo makes a ranger a very good<br/>
class to play. I was solo until about lvl 35 then<br/>
joined a guild and have had some great times in some<br/>
places that I would never had been able to handle solo.<br/>
Velious is where I spend all my time now. I travel to<br/>
Surefall now and again to keep in touch with my roots but<br/>
the frozen waste is where I like to<br/>
hunt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keban Arrowsmith&lt;br&gt;Ranger of 43 Seasons&lt;br&gt;Grand<br/>
