<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1239368674">Hello brothers and sisters. My name is Asieth,<br/>
and I am a 9th level ranger on Tarew Marr. I figured<br/>
that I would connect with the ranger community on EQ.<br/>
As being one of the most bashed on classes, I feel<br/>
that it takes more than one man to break a stereotype,<br/>
hence, I joined this group. I look forward to gaming<br/>
with/getting to know all of you. &lt;br&gt;					Warmly,<br/>
&lt;br&gt;						-Aseith</div>
