<div id="ygrps-yiv-280989689">Most all merchants that sell the things to make<br/>
arrows sell the fletching book and most that sell<br/>
supplies for bows sell the bowery book. For fletching the<br/>
guy you bought the supplies from in Surefall should<br/>
have the book and the woman merchant in the ranger<br/>
guild house in Surefall that sells bow stuff has the<br/>
book for bows and yes having the book is essential and<br/>
have it open when you do you<br/>
