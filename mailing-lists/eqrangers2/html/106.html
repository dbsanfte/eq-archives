<div id="ygrps-yiv-267624082">It depends on your price range. If you want high<br/>
damage get your hands on a wurmmy. I got my hands on 2<br/>
yaks, one is the ranger only. With the yaks was out<br/>
taunting a warrior with two lammys and another one that<br/>
had a wurmy and something else. That is, when it<br/>
procs. I have a facination with everything that procs,<br/>
procing = warm fuzzies. If you are like me and love to<br/>
proc get the yaks. If your a numbers man and like to<br/>
see high damage output ever hit there are weapons as<br/>
good for less money.</div>
