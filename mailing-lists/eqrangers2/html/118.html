<div id="ygrps-yiv-1967235036">You shouldnt have toi deal with an anti ranger<br/>
bias. Ranger with the right&lt;br&gt;equipement are some of<br/>
the best Damage dealers in the game as far as<br/>
melees&lt;br&gt;go. Just make sure to have a dealer handy. On each<br/>
server, there are raid&lt;br&gt;groups. Usually comprised of<br/>
medium and small guilds who cannot raid alone&lt;br&gt;with<br/>
their guilds. Talk to some of the large guilds || or<br/>
High levels in&lt;br&gt;smaller guilds and get the name and<br/>
website of the raid group. There should&lt;br&gt;be<br/>
applications on the website and dates when all the raids are..<br/>
Good luck&lt;br&gt;to you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slyde Windsaber - Norrath<br/>
