<div id="ygrps-yiv-326718134">Buying spells early for level 15 is excellent<br/>
advice. Chances are you wont be hunting near a vendor<br/>
where you can buy them when you do ding. I have all of<br/>
interest stashed in a backpack; one orange bub away from<br/>
15!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As to an earlier post regarding where a ranger can<br/>
solo from 9+, I&#39;ve enjoyed the following:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;at 9,<br/>
you can still get good experience in Blackburrow, if<br/>
you are careful. If you dont mind a couple of corpse<br/>
runs while figuring out the good spots out of the way<br/>
of trains in there, you can do well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From 9<br/>
at least until 14, you can get decent experience and<br/>
make a LOT of money from cash and items in the<br/>
warrens. This zone is now pretty busy as people pass<br/>
through on their way to the new Stonebrunt Mountains.<br/>
This is a mixed blessing...help on hand if you get in<br/>
trouble, but the zone used to be empty and basically<br/>
trainless.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since the outdoors is more suited to the Rangers&#39;<br/>
talents, good outdoor hunting can be found in the Northern<br/>
Desert of Ro from 9 to 15; if it starts getting boring<br/>
around 13 just run due south until you zone into Oasis<br/>
of Marr, boredom over.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Karanas can also<br/>
be fun; Western Karana boasts decent hunting since<br/>
we have track, but avoid the various highly<br/>
dangerous camps of red conning baddies, I forget if they<br/>
are Ogres or what...from around 10 or 11, you can get<br/>
in a &quot;bandit group&quot; and get a good taste of pickup<br/>
grouping. Bandits pop fast and can be done on a limited<br/>
time budget, if that is why you dont group much (I<br/>
only play about an hour an evening myself, which is<br/>
why I personally dont group often). From 11 up, North<br/>
Karana provides good hunting from the wizard spires,<br/>
again taking advantage of our Track skill to know what<br/>
to grab and what to steer clear of.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Happy<br/>
hunting. The ranger&#39;s life is a good one. By far my<br/>
favorite class of any I have raised into the teens.</div>
