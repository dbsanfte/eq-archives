<div id="ygrps-yiv-796493853">I made my Trueshot after 3 weeks of work<br/>
gathering the materials and 25 tries with my fletching<br/>
around 155. The key is have plenty of parts before you<br/>
start. Having only 2 or 3 each of the components,<br/>
failing, then having to make that trip again is very<br/>
frustrating. When you finally make it you will feel real good.<br/>
It is better to have leftovers when you are<br/>
done.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keban Arrowsmith&lt;br&gt;Ranger of 32 Seasons&lt;br&gt;Grand<br/>
