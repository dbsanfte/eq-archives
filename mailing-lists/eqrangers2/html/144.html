<div id="ygrps-yiv-1916667573">Okay this really makes me drool. Where can I find<br/>
a Tolan&#39;s Darkwood Bracer???? Thanks for the info<br/>
on bows. I love my ranger and am having great fun<br/>
playing him, and just want him to be awesome. &lt;br&gt;I also<br/>
found that if you put a lot of starting pts into<br/>
Agility your ranger will get hit way less. I put all my<br/>
points into Agility, and with feet like cat and a couple<br/>
of Agility rings i paid to have made, I have an<br/>
Agility of 160. (I also had a necklace made +7 agility) I<br/>
can solo 3 dk blues and only loose two bubs of<br/>
health. The mob hits a lot less and on average for only<br/>
1-5 pts of dam. (of course you still get hit hard<br/>
once in a while)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;just my two<br/>
