<div id="ygrps-yiv-163774112">Only guide I can give is the one that I did on my own.  27 is a good <br/>
level to go to Everfrost and learn how to fear-kite on the mammoths <br/>
there.  Only really good til about 30.  From there you can go to <br/>
Iceclad and kill snow cougars the same way, be very careful at first, <br/>
they&#39;ll resist a lot.  I killed them all the way up to 39!!  40 was a <br/>
rough one for me, I went to DL and grouped.  Since then I&#39;ve been in <br/>
Eastern Wastes killing every animal I see: Dire wolves, Woolly <br/>
mammoths, Tundra Mammoths, Woolly Rhinos, Tundra Kodiaks, Snow <br/>
Cougars, Snow Griffins, Elder Snow Griffins and Walruses.  The <br/>
smaller mobs like the wolves and cougars are only really worth XP up <br/>
until 46 or so, the southern edge of the zone has blue mobs up til 49 <br/>
and 50 though they&#39;re fewer and farer between the higher you go.  Now <br/>
at 49 I&#39;m going up to Luclin to kill rockhoppers in Dawnshroud, I <br/>
hear they&#39;re good up until about 56, maybe even higher.  Good luck <br/>
and happy hunting, hope I helped out some.<br/>
