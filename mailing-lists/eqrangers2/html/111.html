<div id="ygrps-yiv-2065207848">And here&#39;s another 2cp worth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because we<br/>
have extremely low AC and defensive skills compared to<br/>
a similarly equipt warrior, a ranger should NEVER,<br/>
EVER, EVER try and out-taunt a Warrior. In high level<br/>
groups, this is bad technique and will make your group<br/>
less effective. Let the Warrior take all the damage<br/>
while you stealthily dish out TONS of mele<br/>
damage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your cleric will like you much better for it (and you<br/>
will usually have extra health if your group needs to<br/>
TRAIN. That will keep you alive longer and you&#39;ll die<br/>
less and level more because of it.....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tetzu</div>
