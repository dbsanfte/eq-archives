<div id="ygrps-yiv-1705483460">I all, this is Slyde Windsaber Captain of Arms in<br/>
the True Alliance Guild. I have reached level 36<br/>
after a gruelling hell level. I am kind of at a loss<br/>
for places to hunt now. Where is the best place for<br/>
me to level given the fact that us poor rangers cant<br/>
bind anywhere close to our hunting grounds. If you<br/>
have any suggestions, please let me know. Also if you<br/>
are on the Rallos Zek (PvP) server, give me a tell or<br/>
just say hi..</div>
