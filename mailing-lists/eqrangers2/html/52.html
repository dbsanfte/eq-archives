<div id="ygrps-yiv-1320914544">I just made lvl 12 myself and have been carrying<br/>
a Minotaur Axe since around lvl 7, got it for a<br/>
mere 7 plat but it routinely hits for 17+, with<br/>
minimal delay (dly is only 35). I also have a Velium<br/>
Longsword that a high level strager twinked me with, I was<br/>
prepared to pay around 30 plat for it. It doesn&#39;t hit for<br/>
as much as the axe, but is magical and so makes<br/>
short work of Willowisps. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I really like the axe<br/>
because its delay is short but long enough that I can<br/>
cast the fire spell or snare usually without<br/>
interuption.</div>
