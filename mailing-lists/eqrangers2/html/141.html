<div id="ygrps-yiv-1129810823">For me as a Ranger I use my bow for pulling mobs.<br/>
At lvl 40 I crit for 61 and regular damage is 25 to<br/>
30. Now you can bow kite using snare and shooting<br/>
until the mob dies but this takes a lot of arrows and<br/>
time. I use a dmg4 range 150 arrow most of the time but<br/>
have a fletching skill of 202 so all old world arrows<br/>
are trivial to me at this time so I rarely have any<br/>
failures when making even the dmg8 arrows but they are<br/>
very expensive to make, about 80pp per 100. My archery<br/>
skill is at 180 right now. To get there all I had to do<br/>
was shoot arrows, lots of arrows. When pulling I have<br/>
a shadewood bow and the dmg4 arrows that have a<br/>
range of about 300. My guild leader is a lvl 52 ranger<br/>
and crits in the 300&#39;s. So the hits come with time<br/>
but the bow is mainly, at least for me a tool used<br/>
with tracking to pull mobs for myself or the group I<br/>
am in.</div>
