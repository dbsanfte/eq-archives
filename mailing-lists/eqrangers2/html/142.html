<div id="ygrps-yiv-143489654">Like the previous reply, I too use archery for<br/>
pulling primarily. At level 44 I critical for 68 using<br/>
the good ol&#39; Trueshot longbow and 6 dam rng 50 arrows<br/>
(Class 3 Steel hooked). I also have a higher level<br/>
friend, a 54 Ranger that I watch crit for upwards of<br/>
3-400 damage. The new Luclin archery spells help out a<br/>
great deal too (Hawk Eye, Eagle Eye, Falcon Eye). With<br/>
Hawk Eye up I miss on average of 1 shot in 10, doing<br/>
between 1 and 68 damage. Archery is definitely a skill<br/>
you want to work on. Warriors, Paladins and Shadow<br/>
Knights have their critical on melee, ours is Ranged, a<br/>
definite plus. If you are fortunate enough to get a<br/>
Tolan&#39;s Darkwood Bracer that right-click summons arrows,<br/>
bow kiting is the way to go on tougher mobs. Any<br/>
Rangers on Fenin Ro that want/need some advice, feel free<br/>
to get a hold of me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Linolwen Spiritchaser<br/>
