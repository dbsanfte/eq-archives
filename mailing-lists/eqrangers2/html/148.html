<b>Subject:</b> Agility bracers <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-937905758">I just got two bracers AC 1 and AGility +9 DEX +3<br/>
or 2 can&#39;t remember. Any way the bracers I have on<br/>
now have 6 ac, I loose ac, but gain agility. Which is<br/>
better. I know Ag effects how hard and often you get hit,<br/>
but so does ac. What is your oppinion on the matter.<br/>
