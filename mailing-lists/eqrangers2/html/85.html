<div id="ygrps-yiv-153981850">Greetings Zensidhe&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The spells that you now<br/>
have are all that are currently available for a Ranger<br/>
of your level. Make sure to practice each spell area<br/>
up ( Evocation, Alteration, Abjuration, etc) as they<br/>
will serve you well later. Take special note of your<br/>
spells Flame Lick and Snare...these are wonderful for a<br/>
Ranger learning to Kite or act as group puller. A<br/>
flame-licked and snared MOB is an angry MOB that you can drag<br/>
back to your camp to give it a beating. Very reliable<br/>
for that level range. Snare is one that I use<br/>
religiously.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lull Animal reduces the agro range of the animal you<br/>
cast it on. This helps if you are in an area that is<br/>
highly populated with animals that aggro easily. You<br/>
won&#39;t see the effects unless you are really<br/>
close...just note if you get a message saying that you were<br/>
interupted or such...else it should work fine.<br/>
Personally...I found very little use for it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for your<br/>
new spells...start buying them early...like around<br/>
level 13 or 14...specially if money is tight. Its<br/>
always nice to have those new spells with you when you<br/>
DING rather than having to leave and fetch them after<br/>
the fact.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good Luck...the better spells are<br/>
yet to come.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Quynnelleon&lt;br&gt;Ranger of the 24th<br/>
