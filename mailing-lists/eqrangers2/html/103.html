<b>Subject:</b> FYI: DAOC <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1616176951">If any of you are thinking of trying DAOC and<br/>
wondering what its like, I would suggest trying it if you<br/>
are getting the &quot;stale&quot; feel for EQ. If EQ is still<br/>
fun for you, it would be pointless to try DAOC. They<br/>
are in truth really quite similar. I like it because<br/>
EQ was starting to get same old same old for me, and<br/>
I didnt think I would ever have time for the<br/>
so-called high end game.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;DAOC is much more geared<br/>
toward an hour or two of play at all levels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One<br/>
downside, they are still working on the Rogue/stealth type<br/>
character classes, and rangers fall in this group. If you<br/>
REALLY like playing rangers, wait a bit. Other classes<br/>
seem well balanced, all are soloable to sone extent,<br/>
and grouping gives a big bonus for loot and XP, so<br/>
its easier to get groups anywhere when you do want<br/>
one (also a nice LFG interface)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you have<br/>
read that there is no death penalty, its untrue. Death<br/>
HURTS, it costs money to get back to full constitution<br/>
(affects HP) and so makes the game have a challenge. You<br/>
cant just engage things with impunity, you have to<br/>
think. However, its not so crushingly painful that<br/>
groups only try low mobs, you can do some trial and<br/>
error. Starting with your gear and backpack is really<br/>
nice, if you dont care too much about the xp you dont<br/>
have to go to your deathsite and pray if you dont want<br/>
to. Just pay a healer for the lost const (HP).</div>
