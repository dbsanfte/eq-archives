<div id="ygrps-yiv-766748313">Heyas,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well, this seems to be a pretty<br/>
good topic of converstation. As far as I know, STR is<br/>
the only way to increase the damage done per hit..But<br/>
more importantly is the way that you play during mele.<br/>
With Dual wield & double attack & Kick, you can deal<br/>
out just as much damage as a warrior (minus Bash).<br/>
Keep this in mind, because the biggest thing you<br/>
should be thinking about during Mele is the Hate<br/>
list.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because Rangers have weak AC, we get hit much more often<br/>
than Warriors with plate. If we are constantly dishing<br/>
out TONS of damage & drawing the attention of the<br/>
mobs (hate), Healers have to spend lots of mana<br/>
keeping us alive. If we are not playing primary Tank<br/>
(hopefully you aren&#39;t)It should be your job to do as much<br/>
damage as possible WITHOUT drawing the hate of of the<br/>
mob. That way a healer can keep the main meat shield<br/>
targeted & concentrate on healing him. One way I do this<br/>
is to actually stop attacking for a few seconds so<br/>
that the Warrior can taunt the mob off of me, then<br/>
start hacking once he turns. If you are fighting<br/>
multiple mobs, it&#39;s the Rangers job to &quot;peel&quot; mobs off of<br/>
chanters, clerics & casters when they aggro on your wimpy<br/>
little buddies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The next most important thing to<br/>
do is SNARE. You should snare every Mob in sight.<br/>
That makes a huge difference in the long run. Mobs<br/>
have a harder time aggroing on your casters, & if you<br/>
need to retreat, snared mobs will never catch you.<br/>
(then there&#39;s the fact that they stop fighting and<br/>
stand there getting beat up when they try to<br/>
retreat).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I read once that playing a ranger is like dancing a<br/>
dance. It&#39;s our job to stay alert & be aware of<br/>
everything going on around us, filling in where needed. Let<br/>
the meat shields get beat up. Act like a bodyguard to<br/>
your caster buddies. You&#39;ll make a lot more friends<br/>
than if you hit occasionally for 30 with a<br/>
1hs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just my 2cp&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tetzu 39 Ranger<br/>
Morell-Thule&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;P.S. DEX is most important for getting crits in<br/>
archery. Plus, when you get a weapon that Procs, it will<br/>
proc more with high DEX</div>
