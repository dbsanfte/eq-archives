<div id="ygrps-yiv-1222562170">Head to Lake of Ill Omen if you have Kunark. You<br/>
can solo there or group till about level 30 then head<br/>
over to Frontier Mountains. The exp and loot is great.<br/>
Make sure you are invis for the run from FV to LOIO<br/>
because the spiders are red and mean even to a lvl 31.<br/>
Get some maps so you can have an idea how to get to<br/>
LOIO and also where to hunt. South side of the lake is<br/>
usually not crowded, also near the FM zone is good<br/>
because if you get into trouble someone is usually there<br/>
to help or you can just zone. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keban<br/>
