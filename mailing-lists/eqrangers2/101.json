Best path in I have found (until you get Camo) is<br/>\nto enter Dagnor&#39;s and run to waters edge and run<br/>\nalong it until you get to far side (south end I<br/>\nbelieve). Zone for Unrest is a large rectangluar opening in<br/>\nthe mountain wall.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unrest is basically a 3<br/>\nstory house with basement and a large yard that is host<br/>\nto MANY undead. Trains are frequent and deadly here.<br/>\nGet in a group...kill yard trash (Death beetles, Jack<br/>\no Lanterns, tormented Dead, and greater Skellies)<br/>\nuntil you get to high teens. If you play wisely and<br/>\nstay alert...you will level quickly here. Loot gets<br/>\nbetter as you take on harder mobs and includes armor<br/>\npieces, much coin, gems, bronze weapons and misc stuff<br/>\nlike zombie skin and fungi that sells for a couple<br/>\ngold to a plat each.&lt;br&gt;Everything aggros here so<br/>\ndon&#39;t move around much and stay close to walls.<br/>\nOh...you will die here...more than once...but the exp is<br/>\nworth it IMHO.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Other places good for your level<br/>\nis Lavastorm, Blackburrow, and<br/>\nBefallen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trueshot quest can be done anytime...collect your items<br/>\nnow...and plenty of them. I would reccommend that you do<br/>\nnot try to mfg the bow until you get to skill of 140.<br/>\nYou can do at anytime, and I know those that have<br/>\nsucceeded with low fletching skills...just you failure rate<br/>\nwill be high.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good luck...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Quynnelleon<br/>\n&lt;SWORN&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ranger of 31st season&lt;br&gt;Bertoxx</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
