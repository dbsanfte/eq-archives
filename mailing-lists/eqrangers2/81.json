They show up on the white snow as bright (almost<br/>\nneon) red. They are No drop, so you can&#39;t give them<br/>\naway, but they are found lying on the ground to the<br/>\nwest & south of the Ry&#39;Gorr fort. BTW I&#39;m still using<br/>\nthe cloak at L39.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for stats, AC is king.<br/>\nRy&#39;Gorr seems to be the default favorite for pre Tolans,<br/>\nbut Ivy Etched is great for us too. Then you can<br/>\nchoose to work on STR, DEX or WIS. STR will help with<br/>\nmele max damage & wieght issues, DEX will help with<br/>\narchery, trade skills & hit accuracy in mele & Wis helps<br/>\nwith casting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here&#39;s a breakdown of my armor<br/>\ntoday&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Head: Kylong War Helm&lt;br&gt;Shouder: Crested<br/>\nSpaulders&lt;br&gt;Bracers: Hero & Scavengin&lt;br&gt;Arms: Ivy Etched&lt;br&gt;Legs:<br/>\nRy&#39;Gorr&lt;br&gt;Neck: Ry&#39;Gorr&lt;br&gt;Face: Platinum Silvered Ruby<br/>\nVeil&lt;br&gt;Feet: Dwarven Work Boots&lt;br&gt;Ears: Forest<br/>\nLoops&lt;br&gt;Rings: Jagged Bands&lt;br&gt;Chest: Ivy Etched Tunic&lt;br&gt;Waist:<br/>\nThick Banded Belt (Strawspun until yesterday<br/>\nWoot!)&lt;br&gt;Cloak: Dire Wolf Fur Cloak&lt;br&gt;Gloves Iskar<br/>\nScaled&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some other good items that I&#39;ve worn in the past are:<br/>\nSarnak Emblazened Tabbard (chest), Golden Black Pearl<br/>\nChoker, Cougar Claw & Orc Fang Earrings, Barbed Arm &<br/>\nlegplates, Sebilite Scale Boots, Thick Leather<br/>\nApron....blah, blah, blah&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There should be tons of<br/>\ndifferent stuff out there that you can use and afford. I<br/>\npersonally have the most fun questing to see if I can<br/>\nconstantly improve my weapons and armor.

CHA helps when buying stuff from vendors<br/>\n(not that much though) and INT helps you learn things<br/>\nlike languages (we are WIS based casters so it&#39;s not<br/>\nimportant)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
