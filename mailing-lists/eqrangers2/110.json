For<br/>\nthis, I switch to a 2 hander (currently I&#39;m using a<br/>\nNature&#39;s Fury). I know this isn&#39;t as sexy as sporting 2<br/>\nlammy&#39;s but it keeps my health in the red and my healer<br/>\nhappy. I guess one exception to this would be a<br/>\nWurmslayer cause it has such a high delay that it&#39;s like<br/>\ncarrying a 2hander.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When you are acting as a tank,<br/>\nthe 1 handers are the way to go. As a general rule,<br/>\nthe faster the better, the lowest delay in the off<br/>\nhand. Lammy and Lupine Dagger are UUber until you get a<br/>\nswiftwind. Anything that procs will only help in keeping the<br/>\nhate. Admittedly, I don&#39;t have the greatest 1 handers<br/>\nyet (Wurm Tendon whip 12/26 I think and a Yak Club<br/>\n9/24) but I&#39;m camping the Lupine until I get one).<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another circumstance is when you are fighting a caster<br/>\nmob. I have found that the lowest delay weapons<br/>\npossible are the best, just to interrupt more. This is<br/>\nreally evident when you are fighting a cleric mob with<br/>\nComplete Heal. Nothing is more frustrating than almost<br/>\nkilling the stupid thing and Bam! back to full health.<br/>\nWhen you have call of sky cast on yourself and a DEX<br/>\nbuff from a shammy, watch out! Proc and interrupt<br/>\nCITY!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There&#39;s my 2cp worth ;-)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tetzu&lt;br&gt;48 Ranger<br/>\nMorell-Thule</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
