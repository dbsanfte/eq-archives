Welcome to the game. Ranger is a good<br/>\nchoice of character, altho you&#39;ll find yourself spoiled<br/>\nif you start up a new character. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn to<br/>\nuse the consider function (&quot;C&quot; key or right click<br/>\nafter left clicking a potential enemy), and learn to do<br/>\nit from a safe distance. Things which are &quot;ready to<br/>\nattack&quot; are best steered clear from at low levels, even<br/>\nif they appear even to you, because they often have<br/>\nfriends which are also ready to attack you when your back<br/>\nis turned and you are busy whipping the first one.<br/>\nAlso learn how to /loc yourself when you are getting<br/>\nbeat on so you can easily retrieve your stuff and loot<br/>\nif you do die.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Practice TRACK and SENSE<br/>\nHEADING as much as you can, TRACK especially is a<br/>\nvaluable tool later and makes your ranger very welcome in<br/>\ngroups as you level up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can&#39;t say much about the<br/>\nhunting where wood elves grow up, I am a human ranger and<br/>\nso have hunted the Qeynos and Western Karana area<br/>\nduring my adolescence. Good luck to ya, if you ever<br/>\nstart a new character check out Torvonilous, its a<br/>\ngreat server.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stormhugh&lt;br&gt;Ranger of the 11th<br/>\nMonsoon</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
