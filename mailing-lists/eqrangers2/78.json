The MQ Dire Wolf Fur seems easy enough to come<br/>\nby, but the skinning stones seem to be the trick. Are<br/>\nthese stones No Drop? And are they easy enought to<br/>\nspot? This cloak seems like it would really fit nicely<br/>\nin my ensemble of equipment. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After your<br/>\nresponse to my last post, I decided to try and get equip<br/>\nthat boosts STR and DEX to assist in melee and kiting.<br/>\nOther than this cloak, what other items would you<br/>\nsuggest for leggings, waist, and arms that a 22 Ranger<br/>\ncan hope to successfully quest? I have the bone plate<br/>\narms now that add +5 STR, but they also have -4<br/>\nDEX...a hindrance, so would like to replace them. Was<br/>\nhaving a blast collecting Faydark Armor in Firiona Vie,<br/>\nalas, it only enhances CHA...a stat that means little<br/>\nto me. While I like the rich green color, I more<br/>\nthoroughly enjoy gifting it to bards...if only to add chaos<br/>\nto the color scheme of their wardrobe<br/>\n;-)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanx again!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Quynnelleon&lt;br&gt;Ranger of 22<br/>\nSeasons&lt;br&gt;Bane of Goblin Battlemasters&lt;br&gt;Favored customer of<br/>\nFreelancing Clerics&lt;br&gt;Certified SoW addict</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
