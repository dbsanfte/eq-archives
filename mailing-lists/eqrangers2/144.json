Thanks for the info<br/>\non bows. I love my ranger and am having great fun<br/>\nplaying him, and just want him to be awesome. &lt;br&gt;I also<br/>\nfound that if you put a lot of starting pts into<br/>\nAgility your ranger will get hit way less. I put all my<br/>\npoints into Agility, and with feet like cat and a couple<br/>\nof Agility rings i paid to have made, I have an<br/>\nAgility of 160. (I also had a necklace made +7 agility) I<br/>\ncan solo 3 dk blues and only loose two bubs of<br/>\nhealth. The mob hits a lot less and on average for only<br/>\n1-5 pts of dam. (of course you still get hit hard<br/>\nonce in a while)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;just my two<br/>\ncopper&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mykeal &lt;br&gt;15 Season Ranger&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Murt Morikk&lt;br&gt;21<br/>\nSeason Ranger</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
