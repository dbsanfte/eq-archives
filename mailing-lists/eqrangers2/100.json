It won&#39;t stop a creature in<br/>\nit&#39;s tracks (unless it&#39;s almost dead), but will<br/>\nsignificantly slow the mob down.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In groups, a ranger<br/>\nshould be snaring every mob. This not only helps when<br/>\nretreating, but makes it harder for a mob to aggro on your<br/>\ncaster when he casts that big nuke and jumps to the top<br/>\nof the hate list...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Later on you will get<br/>\nroot, which is good for different situations. It will<br/>\nplant the mob in place, with a 10dd effect. Great for<br/>\nchain pulling, bow kiting (used with snare too) and a<br/>\nbunch of other stuff that you will figure out with<br/>\ntime.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for sticking close to Faydwer, I would go out<br/>\nadventuring, checking out new zones. You don&#39;t relly find out<br/>\nthe magnitude of EQ until you start travelling. Many<br/>\nplaces you might want to visit are: Freeport-Eastern<br/>\nCommons-South Ro combo (all close together), Qeynos<br/>\nhills/Blacburrow/Everfrost (also close together) Toxx/Befallen etc...bunches<br/>\nof places to see.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Have<br/>\nfun&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tetzu&lt;br&gt;Morell-Thule</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
