I then read about<br/>\nfletching kits and such, and finally found one. I&#39;ve<br/>\nstarted making my own arrows, and successfully made a<br/>\nrough oak bow with a hemp string the first try. You can<br/>\nbuy bows and arrows at fletchers shops in Kelethin (2<br/>\nshops, and one outside merchant). Buy a fletching kit,<br/>\nthen make your own stuff, it s cheaper. Check out the<br/>\nfiles on the Allakazam site for some REAL good<br/>\ninfo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alfric&lt;br&gt;4th Lvl Ranger&lt;br&gt;Kelethin&lt;br&gt;The Nameless</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
