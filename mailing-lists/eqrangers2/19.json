I find that I just<br/>\nnever know what the situation is going to be as I&#39;m on<br/>\nat different hours each time I play.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Actually<br/>\nas a ranger I sort of feel like i should be prepared<br/>\nfor almost anything. If I&#39;m just going out for exp. I<br/>\ncarry a twohanded, a onehanded and shield, big bow,<br/>\nsmall bow, lots of arrows, and food/water. This keeps<br/>\nme just below full weight, and I usually try to get<br/>\nsome big oaf to carry my food and water for<br/>\nme.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s incredible isn&#39;t it how much setting up one has<br/>\nto do in order to prepare, and all you really want<br/>\nto do is slay, slay, slay.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can anyone tell me<br/>\nof a good area to get from 15-20 without too much<br/>\ndifficulty? And please don&#39;t suggest Black Burrough, that<br/>\nplace is murder/suicide!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Happy hunting )&#39;&lt;br&gt;Rik<br/>\n(a.k.a.
