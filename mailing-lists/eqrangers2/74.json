As far as I know, STR is<br/>\nthe only way to increase the damage done per hit..But<br/>\nmore importantly is the way that you play during mele.<br/>\nWith Dual wield & double attack & Kick, you can deal<br/>\nout just as much damage as a warrior (minus Bash).<br/>\nKeep this in mind, because the biggest thing you<br/>\nshould be thinking about during Mele is the Hate<br/>\nlist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because Rangers have weak AC, we get hit much more often<br/>\nthan Warriors with plate. If we are constantly dishing<br/>\nout TONS of damage & drawing the attention of the<br/>\nmobs (hate), Healers have to spend lots of mana<br/>\nkeeping us alive. If we are not playing primary Tank<br/>\n(hopefully you aren&#39;t)It should be your job to do as much<br/>\ndamage as possible WITHOUT drawing the hate of of the<br/>\nmob. That way a healer can keep the main meat shield<br/>\ntargeted & concentrate on healing him. One way I do this<br/>\nis to actually stop attacking for a few seconds so<br/>\nthat the Warrior can taunt the mob off of me, then<br/>\nstart hacking once he turns. If you are fighting<br/>\nmultiple mobs, it&#39;s the Rangers job to &quot;peel&quot; mobs off of<br/>\nchanters, clerics & casters when they aggro on your wimpy<br/>\nlittle buddies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The next most important thing to<br/>\ndo is SNARE. You should snare every Mob in sight.<br/>\nThat makes a huge difference in the long run. Mobs<br/>\nhave a harder time aggroing on your casters, & if you<br/>\nneed to retreat, snared mobs will never catch you.<br/>\n(then there&#39;s the fact that they stop fighting and<br/>\nstand there getting beat up when they try to<br/>\nretreat).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I read once that playing a ranger is like dancing a<br/>\ndance. It&#39;s our job to stay alert & be aware of<br/>\neverything going on around us, filling in where needed. Let<br/>\nthe meat shields get beat up. Act like a bodyguard to<br/>\nyour caster buddies. You&#39;ll make a lot more friends<br/>\nthan if you hit occasionally for 30 with a<br/>\n1hs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just my 2cp&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tetzu 39 Ranger<br/>\nMorell-Thule&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;P.S. DEX is most important for getting crits in<br/>\narchery. Plus, when you get a weapon that Procs, it will<br/>\nproc more with high DEX</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
