I&#39;ll try to help<br/>\nwith my view on fletching.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I just passed<br/>\nfletching 70 with my Level 10 Ranger. Fletching is one of<br/>\nthose trade skills where all you need is money to get<br/>\nyour level to rise. I have alternate characters with<br/>\nvarious trade skills over 100. None over 200<br/>\nyet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I find what really helps getting skill levels to<br/>\nrise is persistence and intelligence. You should only<br/>\ntry various skills that are trivial at about 5-10<br/>\nover your current level. Any higher than that, and you<br/>\nwill be wasting $$.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I fletch while medding. I<br/>\nhaven&#39;t made any bows yet. I primarily fletch for the<br/>\narrows. I also made a 6-slot quiver with 22% weight<br/>\nreduction using tailoring skill. Quivers are handy. They<br/>\ngive you autoloading.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One problem I&#39;ve had with<br/>\nfletching (archery in general) is finding supplies when<br/>\ntraveling. You need to do your home work before you<br/>\ntravel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I would like to hear (on this club) about what<br/>\nothers are up to in Ranger hood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brewcamper -<br/>\nTorvonnilous&lt;br&gt;Ranger 11</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
