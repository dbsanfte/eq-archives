Only really good til about 30.  From there you can go to <br/>\nIceclad and kill snow cougars the same way, be very careful at first, <br/>\nthey&#39;ll resist a lot.  I killed them all the way up to 39!!  40 was a <br/>\nrough one for me, I went to DL and grouped.  Since then I&#39;ve been in <br/>\nEastern Wastes killing every animal I see: Dire wolves, Woolly <br/>\nmammoths, Tundra Mammoths, Woolly Rhinos, Tundra Kodiaks, Snow <br/>\nCougars, Snow Griffins, Elder Snow Griffins and Walruses.  The <br/>\nsmaller mobs like the wolves and cougars are only really worth XP up <br/>\nuntil 46 or so, the southern edge of the zone has blue mobs up til 49 <br/>\nand 50 though they&#39;re fewer and farer between the higher you go.  Now <br/>\nat 49 I&#39;m going up to Luclin to kill rockhoppers in Dawnshroud, I <br/>\nhear they&#39;re good up until about 56, maybe even higher.  Good luck <br/>\nand happy hunting, hope I helped out some.<br/>\n<br/>\nLinolwen Spiritchaser &lt;Keeper of Eternal Shadows&gt;<br/>\n49 Ranger of Tunare<br/>\nFennin Ro server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
