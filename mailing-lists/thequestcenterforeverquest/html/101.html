In a couple of months there is a game coming out<br/>
called ShadowBane and i will not be playing EQ any more.<br/>
A couple of my friends and I are looking to start a<br/>
guild in shadowbane. And what is cool about shadowbane<br/>
is that is the only game you can own, control, and<br/>
build a city it is gonna be amazing if you are<br/>
interested in joing me and my friends send me an e-mail at<br/>
