<div id="ygrps-yiv-1473993859">You usually hail the NPC that gives you the<br/>
quest. There they will answer you with something in<br/>
[brackets] just talk back to them and include what they say<br/>
in the brackets in your reply. Then they will give<br/>
you more information. You can also look on various EQ<br/>
websites and get quest info. Any particular one you are<br/>
looking for?</div>
