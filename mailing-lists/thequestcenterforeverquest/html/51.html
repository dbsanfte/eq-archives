<div id="ygrps-yiv-928436200">I am a level 11 Barbarian warrior thats living<br/>
out of Blackburrow right now(killing the giant snakes<br/>
mostly.) I was wondering if there are any quests that are<br/>
easy but give good exp, gold or anything useful. I<br/>
also go to Queynos frequently. Would appreciate any<br/>
helpful suggestions =)</div>
