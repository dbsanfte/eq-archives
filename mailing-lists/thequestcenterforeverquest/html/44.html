<div id="ygrps-yiv-1947583125">Ohhhh, thats a problem! Once you turn in that<br/>
paper and become PvP, there is no return. There is only<br/>
one way i have ever heard of to do this. And i&#39;m not<br/>
sure. I remember hearing once that the only way to get<br/>
back from PvP to regular play is to talk to a GM and<br/>
they MIGHT give you a very hard quest to change you<br/>
back. I hope this helps you. Good Luck!</div>
