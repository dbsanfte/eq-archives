<b>Subject:</b> Gnoll Paw? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1433950357">Hi, Ive got a lvl 19 tank on the nameless server.<br/>
Everytime I kill a gnoll shaman he drops a gnoll paw. I<br/>
must have 7 or 8 of these. Noone seems to know its use<br/>
or what quest its for and likewise noone wants to<br/>
buy them from me without knowing something about<br/>
them. Does anyone here know what the paw is for?<br/>
Thanks! Zlirg</div>
