<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-377831794">In Felwithe, in the Enchanter&#39;s guild you will<br/>
find the headman Kinool Goldsinger. He asks you if<br/>
you&#39;ll do him a favor. But when you ask him about the<br/>
favor, he says, &quot;Nevermind, I should really do it<br/>
myself.&quot; What gives Mikee? Can you find out what is going<br/>
on with that? I&#39;d really appreciate it. Thanks!!</div>
