<div id="ygrps-yiv-1298801022">Well stopped playing EQ for a while. Started playing around on yahoo <br/>
forgot I was a member of this. Acctually signed on EQ for the first <br/>
time in a month and had a lot of patch&#39;s and such to download. <br/>
Wanted to go xp but the desire was not there. So any way. You all <br/>
enjoy the game I will make my return soon..<br/>
