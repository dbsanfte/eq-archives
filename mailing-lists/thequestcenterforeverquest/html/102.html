<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-957502714">A little lost on something involving two seperate<br/>
quests in Shar Vahl and Shadow Weavers Thicket. Question<br/>
is at the end of the quest for the frost weavers<br/>
shield,Spiritist Ragnar mentions that the whisperling inhabiting<br/>
the sheild tells him of another wisperling named<br/>
Scorpialis. Scorpialis is the name of the weapon from the<br/>
TailFang quest which I also completed. Any one know if<br/>
Ragnar is just giving information on the TailFang quest<br/>
itself or if their is more involved in that quest if you<br/>
give him Scorpialis?</div>
