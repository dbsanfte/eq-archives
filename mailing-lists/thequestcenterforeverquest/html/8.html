<b>Subject:</b> Mistmoore <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1679535071">Haha, hello all. I was wondering if anyone knows<br/>
anything about mistmoore, this zone i would think is the<br/>
best built zone in the game. Still there is much<br/>
mystery about Lord Mistmoore. I have become aware of only<br/>
one quest here, besides the Darkforge armor quests<br/>
for Shadowknigs. That is the Electrum Bladed<br/>
Wakizashi quest. Every 4 hours about the Avenging Caitiff<br/>
(guessed spelling, i cant remember) will spawn when you<br/>
talk to him he will tell you about how his mother and<br/>
father were killed and he was exiled from the castle<br/>
after turned into a vampire. If you bring him the fangs<br/>
from both Butler Syncale and Maid Isis he will give<br/>
you the sword (looks like a katana 7/21 1h slashing)<br/>
I managed to finish this quest last night. I dont<br/>
&quot;think&quot; Lord Mistmoore has spawned on any of the servers<br/>
so far, there may be some way to trigger him to<br/>
spawn. Lately I found a dark elf called the<br/>
&quot;hemo.....somthing or other&quot; in the garden, our group killed it kind<br/>
of quick and i didnt think it was anything special<br/>
till later. On the corpse were 3 lore no drop bottles,<br/>
blood spirit. I&#39;m way off most likely but i think it<br/>
has to do with getting Lord Mistmoore to spawn. If<br/>
anyone has any ideas or knows anything. please post a<br/>
message.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kaylin Danmor, 49th Bard on the Mithaniel Marr Server</div>
