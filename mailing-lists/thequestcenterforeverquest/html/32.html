<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1199752393">I got it in Qeynos. I was fishing(as usual), on<br/>
the dock near the Mermaid&#39;s Lure. I overheard a<br/>
conversation telling someone to dive into the water and<br/>
retrieve this guy&#39;s tackle box. So I dove in and found the<br/>
tackle box. I came up and gave it to the fisherman. He<br/>
gave me experience and the tunic. I tried to equip it.<br/>
I tried to sell it. Nothing works for me. I would<br/>
like to find someone who needs it, and trade off for<br/>
it.</div>
