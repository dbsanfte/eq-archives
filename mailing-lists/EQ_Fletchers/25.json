I started with a skill of 69 (not in the mid-70&#39;s I though it was).  The bone shaft, parabolic fletch, small nock, field point was trivial and the next step up was to switch to the claw (?) point (at 76 each), round fletch, large nock and wooden shaft.  I made fifty arrows, spending just short of 4p for material.\r<br/>\nMy yield was about 55% and I sold all the arrows back to a vendor in Faydark Champions.  The cost, after selling the arrows back, was 2409, and  I raised my skill level to 74, so that&#39;s about 5g/skill point.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nMy marketing efforts went nowhere last night.  I didn&#39;t sell any bows.  I did make 100 of the cheapest arrows for a guy for 1p.  The cost of the material for those was 4g and the yield is virtually 100%, so you could say my marginal\r<br/>\nprofit was 6g, but I doubt if I&#39;ll do that again.  It was really tedious!\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nRamalama - 11th Level Ranger Wood-Elf on Mithanial Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
