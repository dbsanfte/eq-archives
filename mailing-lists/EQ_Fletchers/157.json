I&#39;ve been working the Fletching skill pretty hard (to quote one of<br/>\nthe guides on fletchin, making arrows until my eyes bleed) and my skill is<br/>\nnow 170.  I&#39;m currently making arrows with Large Nocks, Wood Shafts, Field<br/>\nPoints and ceramic vanes.  Unfortunately, it is now becoming teminally<br/>\nexpensive to level the skill up (at least with the ceramic vanes).  They are<br/>\nnot trivial but are no longer driving my skill up at an acceptable rate.<br/>\nBefore I flush more pp away, could someone with level 200 skill tell me if I<br/>\nshould stick with ceramic vanes (if so, until when) or move on to cheap<br/>\ncomponents with steel shafts (until when) and then cheap components with<br/>\nblade points.  Also, I&#39;d like some info on making the high end bows.  For<br/>\nexample, is it safe to start working with Oak yet and at what point am I<br/>\nlikely not to cry from a failure with Darkwood? I read somewhere that<br/>\nplaning tools and knives add 20 to the skill needed to make a bow and that<br/>\ncams are for Oak and Darkwood only.  Do they add to the difficulty of making<br/>\na bow?  I notice that, since the patch our fletching kit has more spots.  I<br/>\ntake it that we can now make 2 cam bows and plane them etc.  Does this<br/>\nactually work (rather not discover a bug by investing good pp, hehe)  What<br/>\nis a good price to charge for the Oak and Ashwood bows or even the trueshot<br/>\nif I get my lazy butt up to do the quest.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
