The page is still under work as I am learning more and more each day.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; For statistics: I put 1 point into fletching initially (yes, you read that right, 1 point) and am now at 70.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; By now I have almost regular customers and word of mouth is getting me some sales (sold 16 bows so far, 12 hickory and 4 elm). Yet I dont thing I will find many customers for bows above Elm (people REALLY freak over 30pp bows), so smithing may be the financially more effective trade (banded anyone? yawn). And making a living from Hickory and Elm is illusional for higher levels. The few gp or pp you will get are not worth it as a real &#39;trade&#39; skill. It is more or less just for yourself.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Oh well, still I like fletching. I raised my archery skill to 52 using the Tiny Dagger and really like the &#39;xxx got hit by 14 non-melee damage&#39; message. Equals almost two free kicks and is almost as good as a free swing with a mino axe.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Dragan<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Xegony<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Did you know that we add over 1,000 new e-mail communities every day?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Explore a new hobby, discover a new friend, laugh at a new joke!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>-- <br/>\nKyndra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n* Always remember you&#39;re unique, just like everyone else *</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
