I&#39;ve been working the Fletching skill pretty hard (to quote one of<br/>\nthe guides on fletchin, making arrows until my eyes bleed) and my skill is<br/>\nnow 170.<br/>\n<br/>\nGreat to hear!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; I&#39;m currently making arrows with Large Nocks, Wood Shafts, Field Points<br/>\n </span></blockquote>and ceramic vanes.  Unfortunately, it is now becoming teminally expensive to<br/>\nlevel the skill up (at least with the ceramic vanes).  They are not trivial<br/>\nbut are no longer driving my skill up at an acceptable rate.  Before I flush<br/>\nmore pp away, could someone with level 200 skill tell me if I should stick<br/>\nwith ceramic vanes (if so, until when) or move on to cheap components with<br/>\nsteel shafts (until when) and then cheap components with blade points.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeep plugging away, it doesn&#39;t get any cheaper......<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; Also, I&#39;d like some info on making the high end bows.  For example, is it<br/>\n </span></blockquote>safe to start working with Oak yet and at what point am I likely not to cry<br/>\nfrom a failure with Darkwood?<br/>\n<br/>\nYes it is safe to work with Oak.  You are not likely to cry from a failure<br/>\non Darkwood, when you can easily pick up 350pp from your bank account and<br/>\nclick destroy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; I read somewhere that planing tools and knives add 20 to the skill needed<br/>\n </span></blockquote>to make a bow and that cams are for Oak and Darkwood only.  Do they add to<br/>\nthe difficulty of making a bow?  I notice that, since the patch our<br/>\nfletching kit has more spots.  I take it that we can now make 2 cam bows and<br/>\nplane them etc.  Does this actually work (rather not discover a bug by<br/>\ninvesting good pp, hehe)<br/>\n<br/>\nProbably....  I have no real data on this one...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; What is a good price to charge for the Oak and Ashwood bows or even the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>trueshot if I get my lazy butt up to do the quest.<br/>\n<br/>\nAsh I sell for 25pp (No tool versions)<br/>\n<br/>\nOak I sell for 150 to 175 depending on the tools, and I don&#39;t sell Cammed<br/>\nOak bows (if I did they would be 250).  Trueshot I sell for 300pp, I will<br/>\nsell it for 200pp if they give me a staff and I don&#39;t fail it.  I only sell<br/>\n2 Darkwoods, both with Planing Tool and Silk, the 1-Cam for 600pp and the<br/>\n2-Cam for 750pp..  I have heard, but not tested, that you cannot double cam<br/>\nOak.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nVapn, Master Fletcher, Povar</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
