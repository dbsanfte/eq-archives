I was merely offering some advice that might help<br/>\nyou<br/>\n&gt; see something from a different angle.  I had a &quot;Wis&quot; suit and was able to<br/>\n&gt; get my Wisdom up to 98 with it, and had about a 50 percent failure rate on<br/>\n&gt; Darkwoods (this is all at my current skill level of 196 since it has not<br/>\n&gt; gone up in 4 months).  I ditched my Wis gear to make room for Warrior gear<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; was starting to acquire.  At that point my failure rated started to<br/>\ndrop....<br/>\n&gt; Now another thing that has gone up, other than my dexterity is my level,<br/>\nit<br/>\n&gt; might even be possible that has something to do with it as well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Vapn, Master Fletcher, Povar<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Cooper, Mark [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:blackhawk@...\">blackhawk@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, October 12, 1999 2:27 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Fletchers@onelist.com\">EQ_Fletchers@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EQ_Fletchers] RE: Finally 200<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:blackhawk@...\">blackhawk@...</a> (Cooper, Mark)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; HEHE.. ok i don&#39;t mind ifyou want to dissagree... but wis is direclty tied<br/>\n&gt; to rate of success... and 33% fail of darkwood sends a cool shiver down my<br/>\n&gt; spine... i hope i get that rich that 33% fail on dark wood is no big<br/>\ndeal..<br/>\n&gt; and there is no ned to argue about wis it is a fact.. but if you liketo go<br/>\n&gt; with out .. no problem... i do not fight with my wis stuff on but i do<br/>\n&gt; fletch with it.. i want my failures to be no more that 5% at max 10%.. so<br/>\ni<br/>\n&gt; go looking for more wis items )<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; good fletching to you<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; karvar blackhawk<br/>\n&gt; grand master fletcher lvl 200<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: Murr Rockstroh &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mrockstr@...\">mrockstr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Fletchers@onelist.com\">EQ_Fletchers@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, October 12, 1999 3:05 PM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [EQ_Fletchers] RE: Finally 200<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Murr Rockstroh&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mrockstr@...\">mrockstr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I am going to have to disagree here about the Wisdom thing and<br/>\n&gt; failures.....<br/>\n&gt; &gt; This is something that I first heard in Beta....
