To stick with your analogy, would I hit<br/>\ncombine for some newbie that walked up to me and asked if I would please<br/>\ncombine the parts he just worked getting for his new Hickory or maybe even<br/>\nthe Elm bow?  Sure I would say and not even charge him...  But when you need<br/>\nto have almost 200 in the skill to do what these people are saying, then I<br/>\nhave to say &quot;Nope, it&#39;s gonna cost you.&quot;  I am willing to work deals though,<br/>\nI have done them in exchange for 20 microservos and 10 dwarven wires for<br/>\ninstance (for one bow) and so on,  but for FREE, no I don&#39;t think so,<br/>\nespecially after you call me a name *grins*<br/>\n<br/>\nVpan, Master Fletcher, POVAR<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:vagabond@...\">vagabond@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:vagabond@...\">vagabond@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, July 19, 1999 2:47 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Fletchers@onelist.com\">EQ_Fletchers@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: RE: [EQ_Fletchers] Anyone on this list?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:vagabond@...\">vagabond@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI disagree with one of your statements: there will be no market.  Rangers<br/>\nare<br/>\nnot the only ones that use bows.  I know many rogues and warriors that use<br/>\nthem<br/>\nalso.  I am in-fact one of those rogues.  For us, while we drool over the<br/>\nTrueshot Bow, we can&#39;t use it.  And that leaves plenty of room for profit.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, I also think that your solution for your friends (where they give<br/>\nyou<br/>\n<br/>\nextra sets of the items) is the one I will be using for everyone when/if I<br/>\nget<br/>\nto that lvl of ability on fleching....<br/>\n<br/>\nIt all comes down to personal preference. (on my tailor character, I made<br/>\npatchwork at cost, they give me a pelt and a pattern, I make an item.
