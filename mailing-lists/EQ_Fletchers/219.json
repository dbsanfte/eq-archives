Here s ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1385634173\">Hi everyone:<br/>\n<br/>\n   I&#39;ve been battin&#39; this idea around for a few months now, trying to get <br/>\nVerant to like it, and thought maybe posting it here would help. Here&#39;s <br/>\nwhat I would like to see:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe ability for fletchers to make specialized magical arrows. By adding a <br/>\nsimple level 1 or 4 spell, you could make &#39;fire&#39; arrows (with burst of <br/>\nflame spell added to the mix), &#39;cold&#39; arrows (shock of frost added), <br/>\n&#39;poison arrows&#39; (poison bolt added), &#39;disease&#39; arrows (disease cloud <br/>\nadded), and pure &#39;magic&#39; arrows, (dunno what to add here, but you get the <br/>\npoint). Maybe to get the enchantments to hold,. you would HAVE to make <br/>\nthese arrows magical in the first place (ie make them with the new silver <br/>\ntipped arrowheads).  The magical arrows Verant introduced were a good first <br/>\nstep, but I think more needs to be done to fletching, in general and <br/>\narchery in particular. I&#39;ve got a whole bucket full of ideas for Verant on <br/>\nthat, but that&#39;s another Email</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
