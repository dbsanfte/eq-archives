Use a hickory bow, so there&#39;s no risk of stealing their kill or anything, and so the mob won&#39;t attack you.  If their mobs are red, you&#39;ll increase in skill really fast.  Just be sure to get permission first, or you may piss them off.  I got my skill up quite a bit following a group of sand giant hunters in Oasis, it was really fun to shoot at the bastards, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nSlig of Povar<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;kale usi&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kaleusi@...\">kaleusi@...</a>&gt; 07/19 1:56 PM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>From: &quot;kale usi&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kaleusi@...\">kaleusi@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWas wondering if anyone knows of an archery range (in game) or such where <br/>\none can go and work up your archery skills.
