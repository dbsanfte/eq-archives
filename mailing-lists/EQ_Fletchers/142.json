Vapn, you are not <br/>\nthe only one who is giving up on TS bows cuz of the overwhelming amount of <br/>\nidiots on the servers.  Povar is not alone, Sol-Ro is equally plagued with <br/>\nimbeciles and sophomores who are truly ruining the trade market.  Had I the <br/>\npower, I would take each of them to the town square to be flogged ... tarred <br/>\n... and feathered!<br/>\n<br/>\nFed up as well, Jarron of Sol-Ro.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: &quot;Murr Rockstroh&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mrockstr@...\">mrockstr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Well hello fellow fletchers.  This is a semi-rant, so please pardon it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I have, I think, decided that I am not making anymore Trueshot Bows for<br/>\n&gt;anyone.  I am getting tired of the endless parade of idiots in Norrath that<br/>\n&gt;think my price of 300pp (gone up since I have to now actually gather the<br/>\n&gt;parts, or argue with some newbie in Greater Faydark over the value of the<br/>\n&gt;staff, which I would gladly pay 50pp for - more than fair in my opinion for<br/>\n&gt;a 5th level character).  The typical conversation goes like this.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Me: /auction Trueshot Bow 20 Dam 100 Rng 45 Del 300pp (Ranger Only)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Idiot: /ooc or /auction or /shout Why are you charging so much for a bow<br/>\n&gt;that costs 1pp to make?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Me: /ooc Well first of all it costs around 15pp per attempt, not to make <br/>\n&gt;it,<br/>\n&gt;so on average I would say it&#39;s closer to 20pp per bow.  Second, would you<br/>\n&gt;mind telling me where you get Planing tools for 1pp?  This would save me a<br/>\n&gt;great deal of money in the long run.  And thirdly, why do you want to know<br/>\n&gt;you are a rogue/warrior/paladin/..... (anything but a ranger normally), and<br/>\n&gt;this is a ranger only bow.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Idiot: /auction So why are you charging so much for it?  You suk, you are a<br/>\n&gt;greedy bastard, (I have forgotten the list, but you get the idea), it only<br/>\n&gt;takes master fletcher to make it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Me: /ooc And I assume that you think I was simply created with this skill <br/>\n&gt;at<br/>\n&gt;the master level? If not, then you must assume that it cost me nothing to<br/>\n&gt;get to this level of fletching?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Idiot: /auction Well it&#39;s pretty cheap to raise the skill, cost a friend of<br/>\n&gt;mine only 50pp to get to master.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Me: /ooc Hmmm interesting, cost me a lot more than that to do it.  I am<br/>\n&gt;nearing 200 skill and still fail the bow around 40% of time when I try to<br/>\n&gt;make it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Idiot: /auction Well I think you suk and are just gouging people for money<br/>\n&gt;that you don&#39;t deserve.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Me: /ooc Oh and how exactly is it that the Polished Granite Tommy can sell<br/>\n&gt;for 300pp when it cost the person selling it 0pp to make it?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Idiot: /auction Yeah well that&#39;s different cause they are so hard to get <br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;you have to camp the place for hours<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Me: /ooc And how exactly is this different from me having to gather the<br/>\n&gt;parts, and camp the Arrow Vendor for hours to get my skills up?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;/who idiot<br/>\n&gt;No characters match the dsecription in this zone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Other conversations involve people telling me that my 250pp to 200pp price<br/>\n&gt;is high just to hit the combine button, I am sure you have all heard them<br/>\n&gt;before.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sorry Povar, get someone else to make your trueshots for now, I have had <br/>\n&gt;it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;\tVapn Maistre, Master of all weapons, Master Fletcher, Povar<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
