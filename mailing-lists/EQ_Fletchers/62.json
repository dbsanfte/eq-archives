I m probably wrong - but I thought you got the Trueshot Longbow from a quest?

The <br/>\n&gt;arrow is the thing that actually hits the monster. Now if the bow was a <br/>\n&gt;magic bow and it did something such as make it so you never missed your <br/>\n&gt;target then that would be a very usful magic bow but other than that I dont <br/>\n&gt;beleive that just a plain magic bow has any use, the arrow is the thing <br/>\n&gt;that needs to be magic.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     And to answer your second question no I cant make a Trueshot &gt;Longbow, <br/>\n&gt;but I have seen one person selling them on my server. He &gt;said you do have <br/>\n&gt;to be a very high level fletcher to make one though. &gt;I will see if I can <br/>\n&gt;find him again.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Another thought I had was what if we could have our arrows do &gt;something <br/>\n&gt;useful other than just pull monsters. What if we could make &gt;an arrow that <br/>\n&gt;also poisoned the monster, diseased it, or something to &gt;that effect. I <br/>\n&gt;think thats something we should all look into.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Amrosse<br/>\n&gt;Rallos Zek<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m probably wrong - but I thought you got the Trueshot Longbow from a <br/>\nquest?
