<div id="ygrps-yiv-1499631337">Alright, I found components to make arrows at the hidden inn between the<br/>
two Orc camps in East Commons.<br/>
<br/>
Now can anyone tell me where to find components to make bows close East<br/>
Commons or Freeport?<br/>
<br/>
So far the only place I have found is in Surefall Glad and I hate to make<br/>
that long trip every time. I know there must be someplace close to Freeport.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for any help you can give a beginner (lvl 74) Fletcher.<br/>
