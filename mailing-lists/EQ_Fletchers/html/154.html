<div id="ygrps-yiv-985593585">The skill is capped at 200 if i remember correctly. Personally with the cost<br/>
involved i&#39;d go for the cheaper combo of arrows. Also try to find an<br/>
enchanter/wiz buddy who could let you borrow some of that cool int gear so you<br/>
get skill checks better. that +10 int you may gain from their rings and such<br/>
would surely help you out a great deal.<br/>
