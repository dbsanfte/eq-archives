<div id="ygrps-yiv-1054634745">Ok, you all may think I&#39;m lying, and this is going to cause some controversy <br/>
...<br/>
<br/>
... but with a mere skill of 114 ...<br/>
... on my first attempt at a Trueshot Bow ...<br/>
... when everyone of skill 180 was telling me they succeed only 50% of the <br/>
time ...<br/>
...<br/>
...<br/>
   ... I ... made ... a Trueshot Bow.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*I haven&#39;t gone for a second attempt yet, cuz i know this was the FLUKE of <br/>
the GODS !  But i believe once your skill hits that 101 mark, you become <br/>
capable of making the TS bow.<br/>

&gt;I have a guild member with a skill in Fletching of 162.  Out of 9 attempts, <br/>
&gt;he<br/>
&gt;has made 2 bows.  They are tough!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;snip<br/>
&gt;&lt;&lt;Another thing, has anyone here successfully made a trueshot longbow yet?  <br/>
&gt;I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;trying to get a good idea of the relative difficulty of this bow, and, if <br/>
&gt;you&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;been able to make it, please post your skill level and the nuber of <br/>
&gt;attempts it<br/>
&gt;took (or even if you&#39;ve tried, but not made it, post how many times you&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;failed).  I&#39;ll start.  I am skill 140, and I&#39;ve failed 10 times, no <br/>
&gt;success.&gt;&gt;<br/>
