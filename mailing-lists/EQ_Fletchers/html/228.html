&gt;I noticed the same thing when I was getting my fletching up.  However, I <br/>
&gt;did eventually get my fletching to 200 on Ceramic vane arrows.  After I <br/>
&gt;hit 187 (seems its a random spot for each person), it took 5 backpacks <br/>
&gt;full before I saw a skill increase.  The going was definantly slow, but it <br/>
&gt;did eventually go up.  The only consolance I can offer is that the ceramic <br/>
&gt;vane arrows actually sell back to the vendor for more than the cost of the <br/>
&gt;parts.  I ended up making a 250plat profit from working to get my <br/>
&gt;fletching up.<br/>

&gt;I was fletching today ::the crowd gasps:: :).  I was at 185 working<br/>
&gt;on ceramic vane arrows and everything was going fine ... until I hit<br/>
&gt;189.  Then my skill increases just STOPPED.  I fletched 3 whole<br/>
&gt;backpacks of components without a single increase, and the arrows<br/>
&gt;weren&#39;t trivial yet.  So I decided to try the next component up,<br/>
&gt;which is steel shafts.  Fletched 2 backpacks of those and still<br/>
&gt;nothing.  I then asked another fletcher what I should do and they<br/>
&gt;said try using small nocks, steel shafts, silver tipped points, and<br/>
&gt;ceramic vanes.  I did ... bought 2 backpacks worth (ouch), and STILL<br/>
&gt;no increase.  So my question is ... what do I do now?  I&#39;ve now used<br/>
&gt;up 7 backpacks of components without 1 increase ... does it just take<br/>
&gt;this long to increase your skill at this point ::prays to every god<br/>
&gt;in Norrath that isn&#39;t so::?  Is there something else I should be<br/>
&gt;doing?  Or am I just having a bad EQ day (very possible there)?  Any<br/>
&gt;suggestions that would ease the fears of this poor, frustrated wood<br/>
&gt;elf would be greatly appreciated :).<br/>
