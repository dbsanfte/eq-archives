list and you don&#39;t get any more chances for your<br/>
money. <br/>
<br/>
You only get a skill check per bunch of 5 arrows. if I<br/>
recall the prices for the items went up. The most<br/>
basic tip was 1 copper and went to 6 copper for the<br/>
ability to make 5. A raw deal for sure as some people<br/>
went to near 200 with a much lower cost.<br/>

Subject: I&#39;m at skill 160 and wasting Plat like crazy<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Before the patch my skill was 159. At this skill lvl I<br/>
was using a (field, <br/>
wooden, ceramic, large) bundle/combination to raise my<br/>
skill.  After the <br/>
patch I decided to try to raise my skill some more. I<br/>
wasted close to 40 <br/>
plat after selling the made arrows back to the NPC to<br/>
raise my lvl to 160. I <br/>
had to buy 30 bundles (costing about 3.5 plat a<br/>
bundle) to raise my skill <br/>
one point.  Therefore, I am wondering, since<br/>
everything now costs 5 times as <br/>
much, do we get 5 times the chance to raise our skill<br/>
with each try?  I <br/>
don&#39;t believe so, since that would have given me 150<br/>
tries to raise my lvl 1 <br/>
point.  Am I right? or am I doing something wrong?<br/>
