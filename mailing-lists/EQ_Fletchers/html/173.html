<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1667182877">Today I discovered that working with the Bladed tips, got my skill to start going up again from 170.  This worked until I hit 175 and then stopped.  I added small nocks and squeezed another 2 point raise in skill.  Anyone have any ideas on what the optimum way to raise your skill is from 180 onward?  I figure I need to start combining more expensive components at this point to still get a decent raise in skill.  On a related note, anyone have any experience with working with darkwood at this level?  Everything Oak is trivial to me (haven&#39;t felt like throwing away the pp to test if 2 cam Oak bows are possible or not).  If anyone knows, I&#39;d be much obliged.  Is 180 an acceptable level to make darkwood bows, especially with plane and cams?  What is the failure rate like?  Do they also become trivial as you climb to 200?  Anyone know?</div>
