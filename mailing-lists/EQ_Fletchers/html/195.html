&gt; I witnessed a triple shot on my person.  My suspicion is that it is not<br/>
&gt; fake.  I will meet him again and try to take screenshots this time.  Might<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; suggest we comb the LFAy zone (he was armed with a lark twitter bow ... is<br/>
&gt; it the bow that allows split shots?) ... possible the ranger station might<br/>
&gt; have quests?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;no first is right... but found out .. it will be in next patch.. so not<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; &gt;game yet... will be after the 12 th of oct.. in new sol temple zone<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;later karver<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;ps that split shot skill ... soo far as i acn tell and have tallked to<br/>
&gt; &gt;eqanswer web site it is a fake.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
