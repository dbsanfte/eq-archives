<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1284678064">I have made several Trueshot Bows, you need to be to the point where you are<br/>
able to make the Darkwood Bow (which makes sense since they are essentially<br/>
the same bow, although the Trueshot has less range).  I am not quite to 200<br/>
skill now and fail about half time (which is the same failure rate I am<br/>
having making Darkwoods).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I want to know this though, has anyone actually found the Steel or Ceramic<br/>
Bow Staves listed in the Bowyer Book?  I have looked in the Centaur Village,<br/>
Aviak Village, all over Kelethin and Surefall Glades, checked the Gypsy<br/>
Camps, etc...  Still no staves.  Someone told me that they actually saw<br/>
someone weilding a Ceramic Bow, but didn&#39;t ask the guy where he got it.  Any<br/>
information on this would be extremely helpful.<br/>
<br/>
Last question, has anyone out there gotten over 200 skill yet?<br/>
