<div id="ygrps-yiv-1516769016">I find the best tactic is to not mention your price. Just auction that you&#39;re<br/>
selling a trueshot. If someone is interested, ask. Send them a tell, NEVER<br/>
answer publicly. If they have a problem, they simply /tell you to jump off a<br/>
cliff and go about their business. The best part is, they&#39;re not ruining your<br/>
sales by spreading their ideas of proper pricing to the zone.Unfortunately, bows<br/>
don&#39;t sell well period. I&#39;ve never sold one trueshot at 200pp. I sold ONE Shaped<br/>
Darkwood 1-Cam Bow for 300pp plus a cracked darkwood shield, and I had to give<br/>
away 20 class 6 steel bladed arrows to help him make up his mind. Well, if I<br/>
sell that shield for 300pp (giving me the 600pp for the bow I normally charge)<br/>
I&#39;m still making 240pp... (200 skill, haven&#39;t failed a bow yet). Perhaps the<br/>
real market is selling Shaped Darkwood 1-Cams (second best for damage to delay.<br/>
Best is trueshot, and that&#39;s 50 less range) to level 30+ warriors :) Sold mine<br/>
to a guy who looked REALLY decked out in armor.<br/>

&gt; well I feel for you .. I&#39;m on bristlebane server and the market has been<br/>
&gt; destroyed ... TS bow goes for 100pp .. in kelethin area.. and god help you<br/>
&gt; if you ask for more... you get flamed like you would not believe.. but I<br/>
&gt; just tell them thank you for your help in selling my items.. and I will do<br/>
&gt; the same for them when they are trying to sell there items... that usually<br/>
&gt; shuts them up fast .... they don&#39;t mind destroying your sales ... but never<br/>
&gt; take the time to realize that you can destroy there to.. thus it is an<br/>
&gt; effective tactic.  and please realize .. it is low level newbies that are<br/>
&gt; the problem .. always take your bows to sell in a plus 20 level zone to sell<br/>
&gt; ... unrest is good ... but you still get jerks there.. I like to sell in<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Well hello fellow fletchers.  This is a semi-rant, so please pardon it.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I have, I think, decided that I am not making anymore Trueshot Bows for<br/>
&gt; &gt; anyone.  I am getting tired of the endless parade of idiots in Norrath<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; think my price of 300pp (gone up since I have to now actually gather the<br/>
&gt; &gt; parts, or argue with some newbie in Greater Faydark over the value of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; staff, which I would gladly pay 50pp for - more than fair in my opinion<br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; &gt; a 5th level character).  The typical conversation goes like this.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Me: /auction Trueshot Bow 20 Dam 100 Rng 45 Del 300pp (Ranger Only)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Idiot: /ooc or /auction or /shout Why are you charging so much for a bow<br/>
&gt; &gt; that costs 1pp to make?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Me: /ooc Well first of all it costs around 15pp per attempt, not to make<br/>
&gt; it,<br/>
&gt; &gt; so on average I would say it&#39;s closer to 20pp per bow.  Second, would you<br/>
&gt; &gt; mind telling me where you get Planing tools for 1pp?  This would save me a<br/>
&gt; &gt; great deal of money in the long run.  And thirdly, why do you want to know<br/>
&gt; &gt; you are a rogue/warrior/paladin/..... (anything but a ranger normally),<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; this is a ranger only bow.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Idiot: /auction So why are you charging so much for it?  You suk, you are<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; greedy bastard, (I have forgotten the list, but you get the idea), it only<br/>
&gt; &gt; takes master fletcher to make it.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Me: /ooc And I assume that you think I was simply created with this skill<br/>
&gt; at<br/>
&gt; &gt; the master level? If not, then you must assume that it cost me nothing to<br/>
&gt; &gt; get to this level of fletching?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Idiot: /auction Well it&#39;s pretty cheap to raise the skill, cost a friend<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; mine only 50pp to get to master.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Me: /ooc Hmmm interesting, cost me a lot more than that to do it.  I am<br/>
&gt; &gt; nearing 200 skill and still fail the bow around 40% of time when I try to<br/>
&gt; &gt; make it.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Idiot: /auction Well I think you suk and are just gouging people for money<br/>
&gt; &gt; that you don&#39;t deserve.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Me: /ooc Oh and how exactly is it that the Polished Granite Tommy can sell<br/>
&gt; &gt; for 300pp when it cost the person selling it 0pp to make it?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Idiot: /auction Yeah well that&#39;s different cause they are so hard to get<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; you have to camp the place for hours<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Me: /ooc And how exactly is this different from me having to gather the<br/>
&gt; &gt; parts, and camp the Arrow Vendor for hours to get my skills up?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; /who idiot<br/>
&gt; &gt; No characters match the dsecription in this zone.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Other conversations involve people telling me that my 250pp to 200pp price<br/>
&gt; &gt; is high just to hit the combine button, I am sure you have all heard them<br/>
&gt; &gt; before.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Sorry Povar, get someone else to make your trueshots for now, I have had<br/>
&gt; it.<br/>
