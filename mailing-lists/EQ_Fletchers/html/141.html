<div id="ygrps-yiv-1629875666">well I feel for you .. I&#39;m on bristlebane server and the market has been<br/>
destroyed ... TS bow goes for 100pp .. in kelethin area.. and god help you<br/>
if you ask for more... you get flamed like you would not believe.. but I<br/>
just tell them thank you for your help in selling my items.. and I will do<br/>
the same for them when they are trying to sell there items... that usually<br/>
shuts them up fast .... they don&#39;t mind destroying your sales ... but never<br/>
take the time to realize that you can destroy there to.. thus it is an<br/>
effective tactic.  and please realize .. it is low level newbies that are<br/>
the problem .. always take your bows to sell in a plus 20 level zone to sell<br/>
... unrest is good ... but you still get jerks there.. I like to sell in<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well hello fellow fletchers.  This is a semi-rant, so please pardon it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have, I think, decided that I am not making anymore Trueshot Bows for<br/>
&gt; anyone.  I am getting tired of the endless parade of idiots in Norrath<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; think my price of 300pp (gone up since I have to now actually gather the<br/>
&gt; parts, or argue with some newbie in Greater Faydark over the value of the<br/>
&gt; staff, which I would gladly pay 50pp for - more than fair in my opinion<br/>
for<br/>
&gt; a 5th level character).  The typical conversation goes like this.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Me: /auction Trueshot Bow 20 Dam 100 Rng 45 Del 300pp (Ranger Only)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Idiot: /ooc or /auction or /shout Why are you charging so much for a bow<br/>
&gt; that costs 1pp to make?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Me: /ooc Well first of all it costs around 15pp per attempt, not to make<br/>
it,<br/>
&gt; so on average I would say it&#39;s closer to 20pp per bow.  Second, would you<br/>
&gt; mind telling me where you get Planing tools for 1pp?  This would save me a<br/>
&gt; great deal of money in the long run.  And thirdly, why do you want to know<br/>
&gt; you are a rogue/warrior/paladin/..... (anything but a ranger normally),<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; this is a ranger only bow.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Idiot: /auction So why are you charging so much for it?  You suk, you are<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; greedy bastard, (I have forgotten the list, but you get the idea), it only<br/>
&gt; takes master fletcher to make it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Me: /ooc And I assume that you think I was simply created with this skill<br/>
at<br/>
&gt; the master level? If not, then you must assume that it cost me nothing to<br/>
&gt; get to this level of fletching?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Idiot: /auction Well it&#39;s pretty cheap to raise the skill, cost a friend<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; mine only 50pp to get to master.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Me: /ooc Hmmm interesting, cost me a lot more than that to do it.  I am<br/>
&gt; nearing 200 skill and still fail the bow around 40% of time when I try to<br/>
&gt; make it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Idiot: /auction Well I think you suk and are just gouging people for money<br/>
&gt; that you don&#39;t deserve.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Me: /ooc Oh and how exactly is it that the Polished Granite Tommy can sell<br/>
&gt; for 300pp when it cost the person selling it 0pp to make it?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Idiot: /auction Yeah well that&#39;s different cause they are so hard to get<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; you have to camp the place for hours<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Me: /ooc And how exactly is this different from me having to gather the<br/>
&gt; parts, and camp the Arrow Vendor for hours to get my skills up?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; /who idiot<br/>
&gt; No characters match the dsecription in this zone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Other conversations involve people telling me that my 250pp to 200pp price<br/>
&gt; is high just to hit the combine button, I am sure you have all heard them<br/>
&gt; before.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sorry Povar, get someone else to make your trueshots for now, I have had<br/>
it.<br/>
