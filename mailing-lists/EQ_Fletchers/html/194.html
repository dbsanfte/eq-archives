<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-812048417">I witnessed a triple shot on my person.  My suspicion is that it is not <br/>
fake.  I will meet him again and try to take screenshots this time.  Might I <br/>
suggest we comb the LFAy zone (he was armed with a lark twitter bow ... is <br/>
it the bow that allows split shots?) ... possible the ranger station might <br/>
have quests?<br/>
<br/>
