<b>Subject:</b> Re: Red Alert, Double Attack with Bows <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-592987232">I recently encountered a player, who was even level with me, and 10pts <br/>
better in archery.  So out of boredom, I challenged him to an archery only <br/>
duel.  We wailed on each other for a while, each of us getting the nice <br/>
critical hits ... but my bow was better, so I was hitting for more average <br/>
damage.  However, after several rounds of arrow zinging, we were fairly <br/>
even.  Want to know why?  Cuz this individual had discovered (so he claimed) <br/>
the master archer (NPC of some sort) who taught him a researchable skill (so <br/>
he claimed) in &quot;split arrow shots&quot;.  What is that?   HE WAS HITTING ME WITH <br/>
2 ARROWS IN ONE ROUND !!!  He even managed to execute a TRIPLE shot!  <br/>
Apparently, rangers can now double attack with bows !<br/>
     After much coaxing and pleading, I was not able to get ANY info out of <br/>
him; as he claimed to be sworn to secrecy.  Needless to say, I was vastly <br/>
disappointed that another player would not share a secret of archery with <br/>
his fellow ranger.<br/>
     So all I can do is put out this All Points Bulletin.<br/>
     I don&#39;t know if he is playing a trick on me.  But he seemed genuine <br/>
enough.  Fellow rangers, we MUST all get this ability.  Can you imagine the <br/>
satisfaction of firing a TS or Darkwood bow, hitting critical for <br/>
(57)damage, then nailing the Mob with a second arrow for an additional 29 <br/>
dmg ... in the same round?<br/>
     Let us all unite and find the master... if he exists.  I know we are <br/>
working on enchanting the TS bow right now.  But I&#39;m sure one of us will <br/>
come across some clue for the &quot;Split Shot&quot; ability in that whole process.<br/>
