<div id="ygrps-yiv-99958909">hey now, I resent that level 11 comment. I&#39;m level 11 and I MAKE trueshot bows<br/>
=P<br/>
<br/>
lol, just kidding. I&#39;m an exception to the rule, I&#39;ve spent LOTS of time on<br/>
this. Been playing since release, still level 11. Got money to show for it<br/>
though :)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, to the point, I agree. Hear hear, may the price go up!! Let the newbies<br/>
whine, they have no idea how much it costs to get a skill to mastery, let alone<br/>
after these recent patches. Not to mention how many THOUSANDS of arrows you had<br/>
to click combine for. Let &#39;em whine, it won&#39;t change the facts or the price :)<br/>

&gt; Well, the fit has hit the shan, if you&#39;ll pardon the expression.<br/>
&gt; With the latest patch, making the Trueshot Bow has become a pain ... and I<br/>
&gt; believe it will double or triple the price of the bow:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Micro Servos and Dwarven Wire is now a NO DROP item.  So people can&#39;t come<br/>
&gt; to you asking you to make them the bow with their components!  You&#39;ll need<br/>
&gt; to have plenty of servos and wire of your own!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think this is pretty good ... considering the morons on my server are<br/>
&gt; selling the TS bow for as little as 50p !  But I&#39;m the clever one ... as i<br/>
&gt; think I was one of the first to discover the new NO DROP tags, consequently<br/>
&gt; I buy out as many of them as possible (I know it&#39;s a lore item, but I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; spread the bows out over 3 characters).  Sooo ... I hope the price for this<br/>
&gt; fine piece of craftsmanship finally goes up to it&#39;s just price of 300p +.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just wrote to warn you all of the new NO DROP status.  The treant staff is<br/>
&gt; still the same ... LORE, but not NO DROP.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Why is it level 11 jerks have the audacity to bitch about the price of the<br/>
&gt; TS bow?  You tell them they can&#39;t afford it cuz it&#39;s for high levs ... sigh<br/>
&gt; ... some people will never grow up.  I can&#39;t wait to see how much more<br/>
&gt; bitching is gonna happen whence everyone realizes they can&#39;t have their<br/>
&gt; favorite Master Fletcher make em a TS bow for free :)<br/>
