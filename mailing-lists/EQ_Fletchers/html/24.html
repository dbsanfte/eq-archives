<b>Subject:</b> Long Description of Introduction to Fletching <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-761000037">This mailing list is just too quiet, so I&#39;ll  post this long, boring description of my introduction to fletching.  That should help!  (hehe)<br/>
<br/>
I just finished a four day weekend in which I began fletching. Of course, when I began I planned meticulus record keeping - of course, I kept none, so most of this is from the dimming recollection of an aging ranger.<br/>
<br/>
I bought the books (fletching and bowery) and a fletching kit on Thursday night and began by making a few arrows.  I&#39;m a wood-elf ranger on Mithanial Marr, and fletching supplies are readily available in my home, Kelethin.  I was delighted when I actually succeeded in making maybe 50% of the most basic ones from my first batch of 20 components.  My yield improved fast as I continued making arrows.  <br/>
<br/>
I followed a combination of fletching guides I got off the net.  They all instructed me to make the most basic arrows possible (wooden shaft, field tip, round fletch, and large nock (or is it noch?)).  These things only cost 4c total for each arrow at the most basic level.  My fletching skill went up fast, and as I got the messages that the just-made arrow was trivial, I switched components to raise the cost to the next level.  Note this sometimes meant going down in price for some components, just so the total was higher.  I sold the completed arrows to a merchant in my guild (Faydark Champions) and, exclusive of failures, they cost very little to make.  <br/>
<br/>
When my level was in the thirties (I think) I checked the guides and they said I should be able to make hickory bows.  I found the lady that sells the components, put a hickory staff and some string in the fletching kit, and hit combine.  I was successful, and I got the message it was trivial!  I made a gazillion more arrows.  The change implemented last week to allow picking up of one component from a stack by holding down the Ctrl key made making the arrows possible.  I can&#39;t imagine doing it the old way.  Then tried an elm bow.  I&#39;m a poor lvl 11 wood elf, and had to pay about 2p8g for the elm staff, so I gulped hard when I hit combine.  It worked, too!  <br/>
<br/>
Then there was the problem of selling the things.  I tried to sell the hickory at one plat without much success.  In real life I have an MBA and I&#39;ve always been fascinated at how pricing works.  I know most consumers understand the value of what they&#39;re buying only from the price.  In a desperate attempt, I added 20 basic arrows (the 4c ones) and raised the price to 2 plat.  This worked and I sold several &quot;basic sets.&quot;  I tried the same with the elm, a bow and 20 bone shaft arrows, for 7 plat.  I think I sold two or three in G. Faydark.  <br/>
<br/>
With the proceeds I stocked up, making 5 hickory and 3 elm bows and the associated arrows.  I had heard that paladins had just gotten the ability to use bows, so in a dramatic marketing move, I boarded the boat to Freeport!  What a bust!  I sold one of each set there.  Freeport is broken into three zones and, while I was there, there were only about 20 players in each zone, not much of a market on the /auction channel.  Anyway, I got back home to G. Faydark last night and plan to sell the remainder on my home continent.<br/>
<br/>
One of the problems I ran into was the lack of space to store things.  I now have three large boxes in the bank, one for bows, one for arrows, and one for other stuff.  I would like to try smithing also, but I think two trades is prohibitive unless they begin allowing a second bank account.  Also, with a couple of full boxes I&#39;m &quot;encumbered&quot;, but I just move among the bank, bowyer and fletcher suppliers, so I&#39;m relatively safe.    <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I began the weekend with about 5 plat.  I now have 13 (I think) and about 20 plat in inventory (priced conservatively).  I plan to continue improving my skill with arrows before moving on to ash bows.  The staves for ash cost 25-30 plat each!  I can&#39;t afford too many mistakes there.  I talked to several other fletchers.  They were all very friendly and offered good advise.  I also gave another wood elf some instruction on how to get started.    <br/>
<br/>
Fletching was fun - allowing me a break from hunting, which was becoming tedious.  BTW, if you&#39;re on Mithanial Marr and need a good bow, give me a tell.  &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
