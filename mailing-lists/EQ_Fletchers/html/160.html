<div id="ygrps-yiv-1166611225">Karvar has a very excellent suggestion about having a &quot;Trade skill&quot; suit.<br/>
For those who don&#39;t know, there are two (and only two... not DEX, or AGI) <br/>
stat&#39;s that affect your trade skills.  (Wis)dom and (Int)elligence.<br/>
<br/>
Intelligence increases your chances of getting better at any skill (gaining <br/>
a level) for each attempt.<br/>
Wisdom increases your chance of being successful at an attempt for any <br/>
level.<br/>
<br/>
Bob has 95 INT and 85 WIS<br/>
<br/>
George has 85 INT and 95 WIS<br/>
<br/>
Bob is successful at making [whatever-arrow] with a fletcing skill of 120 <br/>
about 2 out of 5 times<br/>
<br/>
George is successful at making [same-whatever-arrow] with a fletching skill <br/>
of 120 about 3 out of 5 times.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Where it took George to get his skill to 120 in about 3000 tries (about a <br/>
week and a half), it only took Bob to get his skill up to 120 in about 2500 <br/>
tries (only a week).<br/>
<br/>
BOTH Failures and Successes count towards your level.<br/>
<br/>
...These numbers are just hypothetical, but you can see how they affect your <br/>
skills (all skills, not just trade skills)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
[Cha]risma also plays an important role, mostly to your trade skills though.<br/>
The more charisma you have, the higher merchants will pay for YOUR stuff <br/>
(items and loot) and the less you will have to pay to buy from the merchant.<br/>
This combined with your faction standing can really make a difference in how <br/>
much PP you spend on that next batch of arrows.  The likliest place to have <br/>
the highest faction is in your home guild, but try around and get the prices <br/>
from other cities and merchants.<br/>
Me, I&#39;m in Surefall Glade, not far from Queynos and I&#39;ve been noticing that <br/>
prices for me in Queynos are starting to catch up to those in Surefall, but <br/>
I always get a good price check first before I sell.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helped ANYONE out there at all...<br/>
