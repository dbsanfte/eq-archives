<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-742880132">Yeah, it does blow, but if you think about it, fletching was highly imbalanced before the patch.  I&#39;ve only ever done tailoring and a little blacksmithing, but I&#39;ve found fletching drastically easier than either.  For tailoring, you need to spend so much time hunting for pelts, then shell out 6 silver for a pattern, just to get one chance.  I tailored on and off for about a week, and only got my skill up to 16, then I took up fletching, and, after 2 nights, i had it up to 65.  It&#39;s clearly more balanced now, but I&#39;m a little pissed that they waited this long to fix it.  They should have recognized it in beta, so there wouldn&#39;t be the aforementioned 200 skill fletchers running around who those of us whom are not yet masters can pretty much never hope to reach.<br/>

We have been talking about this in the Ranger mailing<br/>
list and you don&#39;t get any more chances for your<br/>
money. <br/>
<br/>
You only get a skill check per bunch of 5 arrows. if I<br/>
recall the prices for the items went up. The most<br/>
basic tip was 1 copper and went to 6 copper for the<br/>
ability to make 5. A raw deal for sure as some people<br/>
went to near 200 with a much lower cost.<br/>

Subject: I&#39;m at skill 160 and wasting Plat like crazy<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Before the patch my skill was 159. At this skill lvl I<br/>
was using a (field, <br/>
wooden, ceramic, large) bundle/combination to raise my<br/>
skill.  After the <br/>
patch I decided to try to raise my skill some more. I<br/>
wasted close to 40 <br/>
plat after selling the made arrows back to the NPC to<br/>
raise my lvl to 160. I <br/>
had to buy 30 bundles (costing about 3.5 plat a<br/>
bundle) to raise my skill <br/>
one point.  Therefore, I am wondering, since<br/>
everything now costs 5 times as <br/>
much, do we get 5 times the chance to raise our skill<br/>
with each try?  I <br/>
don&#39;t believe so, since that would have given me 150<br/>
tries to raise my lvl 1 <br/>
point.  Am I right? or am I doing something wrong?<br/>
