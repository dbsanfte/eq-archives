<div id="ygrps-yiv-1141942133">I travel a lot, actually.  I am not terribly high lvl (140).  I mostly center around Kelethin, even though the prices are much worse, it&#39;s just a lot more convenient for me, as you can never find a teleport when you need one, and I hate marching across Antonica.  Most of my protest for the cost of the bow are actually from the perspective of one who is trying to sell off his ash and occasional oak, not from one who is trying to maximize profit of the Trueshot.  It&#39;s good to know that you are selling for 250, at least.  I&#39;ve seen a lot of people sell for less.  I don&#39;t want the market ruined for the bows I depend upon selling to raise my skill (it&#39;s hard enough to sell them as it is).<br/>
