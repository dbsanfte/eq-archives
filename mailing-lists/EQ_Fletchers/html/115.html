<div id="ygrps-yiv-783927435">i agree fair price for TS should be 200pp to 250pp but ... alam on<br/>
bristlebane sever is undercuting use by selling for 100pp ... and his skill<br/>
is 190 so it is had to compete .... bu i raise my skill from 105 to 134 in 2<br/>
days ... so if i can find a couple more good items to sell i sould be able<br/>
to catch him... a good place to sell stuff that is rare is in unrest in<br/>
auction format i got 160pp for blackin crown last night .<br/>

&gt; Okay, this is probably going to get me a flame or twenty for this, but<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m at the point where I really won&#39;t care.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; IMHO, the programming team screwed up ROYALLY when they failed to make<br/>
&gt; the Trueshot Bow NO DROP.  Think about it... most (or all) of the newly<br/>
&gt; found flaming Paladin swords are LORE and NO DROP.  The one who finds<br/>
&gt; (or quests for) it is the one who keeps it, or must destroy it.  Why?<br/>
&gt; Because otherwise, sooner or later, every guild-twinked lvl 10 Paladin<br/>
&gt; would be running around with one.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been rather bitter since they upped the prices of fletching<br/>
&gt; components by 5x, to &quot;compensate&quot; for allowing us to make arrows in<br/>
&gt; groups of 5, thus effectively creating a &quot;Grandfather Clause&quot; for all<br/>
&gt; those who were able to get to 200+ fletching before the patch... those<br/>
&gt; chars now have an effective monopoly on the creation and sale of<br/>
&gt; darkwoods for quite a while -- at least on the Rathe, from what I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; seen.  What they should have done, was just allow us to place even<br/>
&gt; stacks of components into the damn fletching kit, so that WE could<br/>
&gt; choose whether or not we want to fletch for experience or in bulk...<br/>
&gt; but I digress.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; **************************<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My point here is that by not making this a NO DROP, the programmers<br/>
&gt; have given us the tool to destroy our own fletching economy. I&#39;ve seen<br/>
&gt; people asking &quot;what&#39;s the right price to sell it at?&quot;  Well, this is<br/>
&gt; how I would answer:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you feel you want to make a business out of it, then what would you<br/>
&gt; sell a darkwood 1-cam compound bow for?  Take that price, and make it<br/>
&gt; about 1.5x as much.  Why?  So that Darkwood -- let alone Oak, Ash and<br/>
&gt; Elm and Hickory don&#39;t become obsolete!  If Trueshots sell for 100pp,<br/>
&gt; why bother buying a player-made Elm or Ash bow when you can just save<br/>
&gt; up another 75 or 80pp for a Trueshot?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For reference, my Lvl. 16 ranger has about 110 or so in fletching, and<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve earned almost everything that I own (except for a combine LS that<br/>
&gt; technically is on loan from a friend *g*), and I have yet to make a<br/>
&gt; Trueshot for myself out of 9 attempts.  Maybe it&#39;s my pride that&#39;s<br/>
&gt; making me write this... perhaps.  But I can and will not allow myself<br/>
&gt; to stand idly by while other fletchers destroy OUR OWN economy.  I have<br/>
&gt; to say SOMETHING.  The jewelers are rallying to unite together to raise<br/>
&gt; their prices back up a bit, to save their economy from a plague of low<br/>
&gt; prices.  I see it working.  We, as fletchers, have to wake up a bit --<br/>
&gt; before we sink ourselves with Trueshots.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; More than $0.02, I realize... and my aplogies to all who disagree and<br/>
&gt; read it all the way through, anyway.  :)<br/>
