<div id="ygrps-yiv-496804404">From: &quot;Bonecrkr&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:bonecrkr@...">bonecrkr@...</a>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
snip---&gt;  I was discussing making various bows with a skill of 170<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; Yes it is safe to work with Oak.  You are not likely to cry from a<br/>
 </span></blockquote>failure<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; on Darkwood, when you can easily pick up 350pp from your bank account and<br/>
&gt;&gt; click destroy.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Could you expound on this a little?  I have discovered that all Oak bows<br/>
 </span></blockquote>are<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;trivial to me (although I haven&#39;t made the 2 cam variety yet).  Is a skill<br/>
&gt;of 170 sufficient to start making Darkwood bows?  At what point do<br/>
 </span></blockquote>darkwoods<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;become trivial if at ever?  What&#39;s the failure rate at 170 vs close to 200.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What I meant was, if you cannot afford to lose the plat to make it, you will<br/>
most likely cry from a failure.  I have a few thousand plat in the bank, so<br/>
failing one is not that big a financial setback.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt; What is a good price to charge for the Oak and Ashwood bows or even the<br/>
&gt;&gt; trueshot if I get my lazy butt up to do the quest.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Ash I sell for 25pp (No tool versions)<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Oak I sell for 150 to 175 depending on the tools, and I don&#39;t sell Cammed<br/>
&gt;&gt; Oak bows (if I did they would be 250).  Trueshot I sell for 300pp, I will<br/>
&gt;&gt; sell it for 200pp if they give me a staff and I don&#39;t fail it.  I<br/>
&gt;&gt; only sell<br/>
&gt;&gt; 2 Darkwoods, both with Planing Tool and Silk, the 1-Cam for 600pp and the<br/>
&gt;&gt; 2-Cam for 750pp..  I have heard, but not tested, that you cannot<br/>
&gt;&gt; double cam<br/>
&gt;&gt; Oak.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve been thinking along the same way.  I have sold 4 basic Oak bows<br/>
 </span></blockquote>(hemp),<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;each for 150pp and one 1 cam made with planing tool and silk for 200pp<br/>
&gt;(should I charge more do you think)?  Is double cam broken for some reason?<br/>
&gt;What have you heard?  How much would you sell a basic Darkwood bow for (no<br/>
&gt;planing or cams)?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think that the Oak 2-Cam is &quot;broken&quot; at all.  I just don&#39;t think<br/>
that you can make a Compound (2 Cam) Oak bow.<br/>
<br/>
Here are the bows I sell<br/>
<br/>
Ash, Hemp, 16/100/58 for 25pp<br/>
Ash, Linen,  15/100/54 for 25pp<br/>
Ash, Silk,  14/100/50 for 25pp<br/>
Oak, Silk, Planing Tool,  17/125/48  for 150pp to 175pp depending on my mood<br/>
(I have never sold any other oak)<br/>
Darkwood, 1-Cam, Planing Tool, Silk, 20/150/46  for 600pp<br/>
Darkwood, 2-Cam, Planing Tool, Silk, 19/150/41  for 700 to 750pp</div>
