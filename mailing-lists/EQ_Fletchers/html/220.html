<div id="ygrps-yiv-1269187532">Sounds like a very cool idea, but I doubt that Verant will add anything like<br/>
this to the current game.  They seem to wrapped up about balance and adding<br/>
something new would compromise all of their careful &quot;tuning&quot;.  I would love<br/>
to see magic arrows that stun, then you could kite with arrows.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hi everyone:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    I&#39;ve been battin&#39; this idea around for a few months now, trying to get<br/>
&gt; Verant to like it, and thought maybe posting it here would help. Here&#39;s<br/>
&gt; what I would like to see:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The ability for fletchers to make specialized magical arrows. By adding a<br/>
&gt; simple level 1 or 4 spell, you could make &#39;fire&#39; arrows (with burst of<br/>
&gt; flame spell added to the mix), &#39;cold&#39; arrows (shock of frost added),<br/>
&gt; &#39;poison arrows&#39; (poison bolt added), &#39;disease&#39; arrows (disease cloud<br/>
&gt; added), and pure &#39;magic&#39; arrows, (dunno what to add here, but you get the<br/>
&gt; point). Maybe to get the enchantments to hold,. you would HAVE to make<br/>
&gt; these arrows magical in the first place (ie make them with the new silver<br/>
&gt; tipped arrowheads).  The magical arrows Verant introduced were a<br/>
&gt; good first<br/>
&gt; step, but I think more needs to be done to fletching, in general and<br/>
&gt; archery in particular. I&#39;ve got a whole bucket full of ideas for<br/>
&gt; Verant on<br/>
&gt; that, but that&#39;s another Email<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
