<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Why did this list just go completely dead? i<br/>
&gt; haven&#39;t had an e-mail in something like 4 days!<br/>
&gt; I want to revive this list by asking the master <br/>
&gt; fletchers out there if they could compile a list<br/>
&gt; for the skill level when certain items become <br/>
&gt; trivial. Also could someone give me a good price<br/>
&gt; list for arrows and bows. I just want to be fair<br/>
&gt; to my customers and to the rest of you if I&#39;m not<br/>
&gt; charging enough. Please let&#39;s jumpstart this worn<br/>
&gt; out mailing list and turn it into the powerful<br/>
&gt; think tank it once was.<br/>
