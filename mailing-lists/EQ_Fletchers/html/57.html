<div id="ygrps-yiv-1179228202">I would imagine the point would be to hit magic only mobs.  I&#39;ve never heard a good answer to this, but I&#39;ve heard controversy as to whether this actually works.  I know using a magic only bow with regular arrows will not hit a magic only mob (so what the heck is the point of a magic bow?), but I have never heard a good answer as to a non-magic bow with magic arrows, or a magic bow with magic arrows.  Has anyone ever tried this, and, if not, could you try it and post the results?<br/>
<br/>
     Another thing, has anyone here successfully made a trueshot longbow yet?  I&#39;m trying to get a good idea of the relative difficulty of this bow, and, if you&#39;ve been able to make it, please post your skill level and the nuber of attempts it took (or even if you&#39;ve tried, but not made it, post how many times you&#39;ve failed).  I&#39;ll start.  I am skill 140, and I&#39;ve failed 10 times, no success.<br/>
