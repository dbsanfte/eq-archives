Well, just started a Wood Elf Ranger on Tarew Marr (level 3 already :) and<br/>
saw that the TS Bow start price was 200pp, in an auction, or should I say<br/>
SHOUT.  With 100+ people in the zone sure gets noisy, not to mention the<br/>
lag...  use to Neriak where the zones keep the population down.<br/>

Well at lvl 105 i made TS bow.. on third attempt ... but have tried 3 more<br/>
times and falled. so i stand at one out of 6 at lvl 105 ... but i have a big<br/>
bone to pick..i want to know what is fair price to sell bow at.... i sell to<br/>
my guild members at 100pp and 10 servos and 10 kolka nuts... but to non<br/>
guild members i sell at 250pp ... but now i have anouther fletcher on<br/>
bristlebane sever selling the bows to public for 100pp .. and harassing me<br/>
in a very polite way ( he was not rude) to lower my price.. he says this<br/>
will stop more peole form becoming fletchers... i fail to see his<br/>
logic...but his lvl is 190 and mine is 105 so he can pump them out farter<br/>
that i can... but i have 80 pices of each item. so i can compete and my<br/>
skill is gettting better .. but my charizma is 85 with buffs and his starts<br/>
at 90 with out ... so this will be a challange.. my question is after all<br/>
our blood sweat and tears to work our way to master fletchers and haveing no<br/>
market to speak or to sell our wears ...what is a fair price for a bow that<br/>
is cheap to make for us but has a very limited market ... at 100 pp each i<br/>
see this markert being staturated very very quick.. i can see 100p and a<br/>
good item in trade or a item worth 200pp in trade ... i&#39;m all for barter ...<br/>
but at 100pp per bow in gerneral auction ...seem to me to undermine all of<br/>
our hard work.  please help what is a fair price for bow in open market<br/>
<br/>
 thanks<br/>
