<b>Subject:</b> Re: Trivial Bow Levels? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2088413997">Hey All,<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know suppose anyone out here has a list (or knows where to get one) <br/>
of the levels at which different bows become trivial?<br/>
If you know any levels for certain, send them to me via E-Mail and I wiil <br/>
start to compile them as a refernce for others to use.<br/>
<br/>
Second question:<br/>
At only 5.5pp a pop, I&#39;m not worried about the money... What is a good skill <br/>
level to try the Carved Elm Bow? - Can you put cams on them or make &#39;smooth <br/>
elm&#39;?  I need to upgrarde my rough, hemp-stringed, elm bow and don&#39;t have <br/>
much skill and I don&#39;t want to buy... because of that whole &#39;ranger pride&#39; <br/>
thing  :)</div>
