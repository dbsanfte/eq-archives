<div id="ygrps-yiv-2110027306">Well folks at a skill of around 60 you should be able to make Rough Elm/Silk <br/>
bows...<br/>
At a skill of 80 you should be able to make Rough Ashwood/Silk bows<br/>
I have yet to make a Carved Elm/Silk bow<br/>
<br/>
Each time you increase the type of string (hemp to linen, linen to silk) you <br/>
decrease Damage by 1 and Delay by 4<br/>
<br/>
each time you improve the bow staff type (hickory to elm, elm to ashwood) it <br/>
seems that you increase damage by 3, range by 25, and delay by variable amount<br/>
<br/>
Carving appears to decrease delay by 5 when using a whittling knife according <br/>
to stats given to me by a very highly skilled fletcher (mid 90&#39;s)</div>
