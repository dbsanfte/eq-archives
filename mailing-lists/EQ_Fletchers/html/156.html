<div id="ygrps-yiv-1029921820">Hey there,<br/>
<br/>
Sorry I can&#39;t answer any of your questions, but your questions have been<br/>
rolling around in my head for some time.  Specifically, when should you move<br/>
to higher components and when is it OK to move to bows?<br/>
<br/>
I have a fletching skill of 50 currently.  I am now using wood shafts,<br/>
medium nocks, parablolic flights and field points I believe.  When this<br/>
becomes trivial, which item should I increase?  When should I start making<br/>
bows and when should I advance the wood?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any help.<br/>

I could use a little advice from any of the GrandMaster Fletchers out there.<br/>
I&#39;ve been working the Fletching skill pretty hard (to quote one of the<br/>
guides on fletchin, making arrows until my eyes bleed) and my skill is now<br/>
170.  I&#39;m currently making arrows with Large Nocks, Wood Shafts, Field<br/>
Points and ceramic vanes.  Unfortunately, it is now becoming teminally<br/>
expensive to level the skill up (at least with the ceramic vanes).  They are<br/>
not trivial but are no longer driving my skill up at an acceptable rate.<br/>
Before I flush more pp away, could someone with level 200 skill tell me if I<br/>
should stick with ceramic vanes (if so, until when) or move on to cheap<br/>
components with steel shafts (until when) and then cheap components with<br/>
blade points.  Also, I&#39;d like some info on making the high end bows.  For<br/>
example, is it safe to start working with Oak yet and at what point am I<br/>
likely not to cry from a failure with Darkwood? I read somewhere that<br/>
planing tools and knives add 20 to t!<br/>
!<br/>
!<br/>
he skill needed to make a bow and that cams are for Oak and Darkwood only.<br/>
Do they add to the difficulty of making a bow?  I notice that, since the<br/>
patch our fletching kit has more spots.  I take it that we can now make 2<br/>
cam bows and plane them etc.  Does this actually work (rather not discover a<br/>
bug by investing good pp, hehe)  What is a good price to charge for the Oak<br/>
and Ashwood bows or even the trueshot if I get my lazy butt up to do the<br/>
quest.</div>
