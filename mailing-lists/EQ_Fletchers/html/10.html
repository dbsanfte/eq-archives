&gt; I put up a compiled fletching guide on a prelimenary page at<br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; I tried to compile everything I could find about fletching and added all the experiences I had while persuing this trade. The page is still under work as I am learning more and more each day.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For statistics: I put 1 point into fletching initially (yes, you read that right, 1 point) and am now at 70.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; By now I have almost regular customers and word of mouth is getting me some sales (sold 16 bows so far, 12 hickory and 4 elm). Yet I dont thing I will find many customers for bows above Elm (people REALLY freak over 30pp bows), so smithing may be the financially more effective trade (banded anyone? yawn). And making a living from Hickory and Elm is illusional for higher levels. The few gp or pp you will get are not worth it as a real &#39;trade&#39; skill. It is more or less just for yourself.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Oh well, still I like fletching. I raised my archery skill to 52 using the Tiny Dagger and really like the &#39;xxx got hit by 14 non-melee damage&#39; message. Equals almost two free kicks and is almost as good as a free swing with a mino axe.<br/>
