<div id="ygrps-yiv-1700433342">Two questions:<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve all signed the petition at empty.com/rangers ... any word or idea if <br/>
changes are going to be made?  I&#39;d like to restart fletching soon.<br/>
<br/>
Second, do arrows make a difference in accuracy?  Or is it just skill.  Cuz <br/>
as a master archer with a TS bow, I feel disappointed with my accuracy <br/>
sometimes.  So if anyone knows the most accurate arrow ... or just the <br/>
component that makes arrows hit more often (bone shaft or small nock I <br/>
figure) please let me know.<br/>
<br/>
