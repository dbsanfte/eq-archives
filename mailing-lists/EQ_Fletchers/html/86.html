<div id="ygrps-yiv-1783229541">Hmm interesting, and I see your point, but at the same time, a person<br/>
doesn&#39;t spend 1000&#39;s of plat and literally &quot;days&quot; of online time working up<br/>
to the point of sewing patchwork.. To stick with your analogy, would I hit<br/>
combine for some newbie that walked up to me and asked if I would please<br/>
combine the parts he just worked getting for his new Hickory or maybe even<br/>
the Elm bow?  Sure I would say and not even charge him...  But when you need<br/>
to have almost 200 in the skill to do what these people are saying, then I<br/>
have to say &quot;Nope, it&#39;s gonna cost you.&quot;  I am willing to work deals though,<br/>
I have done them in exchange for 20 microservos and 10 dwarven wires for<br/>
instance (for one bow) and so on,  but for FREE, no I don&#39;t think so,<br/>
especially after you call me a name *grins*<br/>

I disagree with one of your statements: there will be no market.  Rangers<br/>
are<br/>
not the only ones that use bows.  I know many rogues and warriors that use<br/>
them<br/>
also.  I am in-fact one of those rogues.  For us, while we drool over the<br/>
Trueshot Bow, we can&#39;t use it.  And that leaves plenty of room for profit.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I also think that your solution for your friends (where they give<br/>
you<br/>
<br/>
extra sets of the items) is the one I will be using for everyone when/if I<br/>
get<br/>
to that lvl of ability on fleching....<br/>
<br/>
It all comes down to personal preference. (on my tailor character, I made<br/>
patchwork at cost, they give me a pelt and a pattern, I make an item.  All<br/>
because I was below the break even point on PW at that<br/>
time)<br/>
