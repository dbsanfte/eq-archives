&gt; &gt;trivial to me (although I haven&#39;t made the 2 cam variety yet).  Is a skill<br/>
&gt; &gt;of 170 sufficient to start making Darkwood bows?  At what point do<br/>
&gt; darkwoods<br/>
&gt; &gt;become trivial if at ever?  What&#39;s the failure rate at 170 vs close to 200.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>        High-end darkwoods are not trivial at 200. However, success rates<br/>
are high enough that it&#39;s not a huge problem. I can make a tidy profit while<br/>
charging 520-550pp for a shaped darkwood compound w/silk (costs me<br/>
320pp to make).<br/>

&gt; PS. BLADED NOW TRIVIAL TO ME .. WHAT SHOULDI USE TO IMPROVE MY SKILL NOW? IT<br/>
&gt; IS<br/>
&gt; THE MOST EXPENSIVE ARROW ITEM AND IT IS TRIVIAL. THE STEEL SHAFT DOES NOT<br/>
&gt; SAY<br/>
&gt; TRIVIAL BUST 80 TRYS HAS RESULTED IN NO SKILL POINTS. SO I CONFUSED NOW<br/>
&gt; PLEASE HELP.<br/>

progression for skill gain. The last type you&#39;ll be making are ceramic vane,<br/>
large nock, field point, wood shaft arrows...those will take you to from 162<br/>
to 200 (max skill). At 200 skill, you can (though they are still not trivial and<br/>
there are a few failures) make a profit selling them back to the vendor, if<br/>
you&#39;ve scraped together some stat increasing equipment for your charisma.<br/>
Carrying 120 cha, I can make 8-12pp on a bundle of 40 of each part in<br/>
SF, where I am popular with the locals due to my many BB gnoll hunts.<br/>
This can be somewhat tedious. It was, however, a great help in building<br/>
those last skill points, as the hemmoraging platinum ended...smile.<br/>

&gt;don&#39;t get your hopes up.)<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Still think those expensive arrow are just &quot;skill fodder&quot;?<br/>

not much sense in making (in my opinion) anything beyond a damage 1 arrow<br/>
unless someone specifically asks for you better and is willing to pay for it<br/>
(which happens very rarely).<br/>
<br/>
        Now, the sensible thing, it would seem...is to make arrow damage a<br/>
multiplier of bow damage...given that arrow cost basically doubles for each<br/>
additional damage point. Otherwise, it&#39;s simply not cost efficient to use them<br/>
.<br/>
        With the present system, bow damage + arrow damage = total damage.<br/>
A damage 1 arrow costs, say 1sp, and adds 1 damage to your 19 damage bow<br/>
for a total of 20 damage max.<br/>
A damage 2 arrow costs 2sp and adds 2 damage to your 19 damage bow for<br/>
a total of 21 damage max.<br/>
        For the 2sp I spent on a 2 damage arrow doing 21 max damage, I could<br/>
have made two 1 damage arrows with a total damage potential of 40.<br/>
<br/>
        And of course, it gets worse the higher you go...spend 8sp on one 4 damage<br/>
arrow with a total potential damage of 23, or 8sp on eight 1 damage arrows with<br/>
a total potential damage of 160?<br/>
<br/>
        This of course, discounts crits, but those are not significantly higher to<br/>
the<br/>
point of justifying the ridiculous cost.<br/>
<br/>
        The other sensible change would be to simply adjust the cost of making the<br/>
arrows more in line with their actual value.<br/>
<br/>
        If Verant is really interested in making fletching a viable trade,<br/>
(bowyering is)<br/>
they need to make one of these adjustments, and I heartily encourage my fellows<br/>
to join me in suggesting a change.<br/>
