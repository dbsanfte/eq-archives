<div id="ygrps-yiv-1539906645">The different factors that I have seen affect skills are INT, Class level,<br/>
Skill level and item produced.<br/>
	I have an INT of 187 and I get amazing level increases in every skill I<br/>
try.  My wife also plays and I have given her the benefit of my knowledge,<br/>
but she has an INT in the 70&#39;s.  She takes forever to gain skill levels.  We<br/>
have both started a skill together (Brewing) and we only Brew together yet I<br/>
am now in my 30&#39;s while she is still around 12.  	I have also noticed that<br/>
the closer an item is to trivial, the faster you gain skill levels.<br/>
	I have also noticed that your class level matters a lot.  If you start a<br/>
skill when your class level is in its 20&#39;s, then you will gain slower in the<br/>
lower levels of the skill.  What I mean by this is that a Ranger level 20<br/>
and a Ranger level 5 that are identical in every other way will gain levels<br/>
in Fletching at different rates.  The level 20 will gain slower at first<br/>
than the level 5.  I assume, but have not had a chance to test this theory,<br/>
that it works the other way around for higher level skills.  By that I mean,<br/>
I think that the level 20 Ranger will gain faster when his skill gets up<br/>
toward master than the level 5 would.  I think it was designed for you to<br/>
skill level slowly with your class level.<br/>
	I haven&#39;t had much chance to see what affect WIS has on item failure<br/>
because I have only been interested in gaining skill level and not my<br/>
failure rates.  But because INT seems to work as advertised, I will assume<br/>
WIS does too!<br/>

hehe ok, was just postulating another theory, but simply because someone<br/>
&quot;thinks&quot; that it is true, does not make it so.  And like I said, this<br/>
&quot;theory&quot; of wisdom started way back in Beta, and you should know that if<br/>
enough people say it, then eventually everybody believes it....  All I know<br/>
is that I too am doing jewelry, along with Fletching, and I have a 74<br/>
Wisdom.  I have roughly the same failure rate (I was keeping track) as<br/>
another jeweler with  wisdom over 100....  So does anyone really know for<br/>
sure???  I say no, no one other than an employee looking at the code can say<br/>
&quot;Yes, wisdom does raise the chances of success&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So to say it is FACT is a misstatement, because you can&#39;t know that.  I was<br/>
merely posting some curious results I got from a low wisdom, high dexterity<br/>
character, stating that it seemed odd that I had a pretty good success rate<br/>
with a low wisdom and a high strength.  If this helps, I minored in Math in<br/>
College and do understand statistics, so I do know that the 25 to 50 data<br/>
points that I have are not that good an idicator, but it was curious is all.<br/>

One major case in fact- EVERY jeweler (master and above) out there has a set<br/>
of<br/>
equipment for jeweling- wisdom being the main factor after skill to<br/>
determine<br/>
failures, then intelligence to raise skills.<br/>
<br/>
I tried this with my cleric- started by brewing, but also on some low level<br/>
jewelry, baking and tailoring stuff.  I was able to reliably make items that<br/>
other characters could not make reliably, even though these other characters<br/>
had<br/>
much more dex (145 vs 110), agi (138 vs 85), and between 10-20 skill points<br/>
more<br/>
than I did.  My wisdom is 178, thiers 70.<br/>

If you don&#39;t believe that, ask a jeweler or go check out the enchanters<br/>
