<div id="ygrps-yiv-2052651021">There&#39;s lots of great charts for this type of info at the ragers&#39; glade website.  The url is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://empty.com/rangers">http://empty.com/rangers</a> .  So what does everyone think about the latest patch making micro servos and dwarven wire no drop?  I think it was the wrong approach.  They should have just made the bow no drop, and left the component gathering open in case some newbies wanted to make a bit of cash killing rogue clockworks.  I also heard a rumor that the lantern Jyle no longer gives the treant wood, and instead has been giving fire beetle eyes.  Can anyone confirm this?<br/>

Why did this list just go completely dead? i<br/>
haven&#39;t had an e-mail in something like 4 days!<br/>
I want to revive this list by asking the master <br/>
fletchers out there if they could compile a list<br/>
for the skill level when certain items become <br/>
trivial. Also could someone give me a good price<br/>
list for arrows and bows. I just want to be fair<br/>
to my customers and to the rest of you if I&#39;m not<br/>
charging enough. Please let&#39;s jumpstart this worn<br/>
out mailing list and turn it into the powerful<br/>
think tank it once was.<br/>
