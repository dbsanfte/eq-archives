<div id="ygrps-yiv-785681773"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I noticed the same thing when I was getting my fletching up.  However, I<br/>
&gt;did eventually get my fletching to 200 on Ceramic vane arrows.  After I<br/>
&gt;hit 187 (seems its a random spot for each person), it took 5 backpacks<br/>
&gt;full before I saw a skill increase.  The going was definantly slow, but it <br/>
&gt;did eventually go up.  The only consolance I can offer is that the<br/>
&gt;ceramic vane arrows actually sell back to the vendor for more than the<br/>
&gt;cost of the parts.  I ended up making a 250plat profit from working to<br/>
&gt;get my fletching up.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>     Yes, I noticed that too.  When I sold back the ceramic vane arrows I <br/>
got a profit (sold for like 6gp + per arrow).  However, when I moved to the <br/>
next component up, which is steel shafts, the arrows actually sold for less <br/>
(like 5gp + per arrow) =/.  But you say you did get to 200 with ceramic vane <br/>
only?  Well then I&#39;ll switch back to that ... because buying all of the most <br/>
expensive components is just soooo expensive to do.  Did it take you 5 <br/>
backpacks or so of components to get each level increase from then on?  Or <br/>
was it just when you hit 187, and then got easier from then on?  Because I <br/>
am NOT looking forward to fletching all those arrows =P.  But oh well, gotta <br/>
keep reminding myself ... want to make darkwood ... WANT to make darkwood!  <br/>
=)  But thank you all ever so much for the input ... guess I&#39;ll go back to <br/>
fletching those arrows now *wimpers*<br/>
