<b>Subject:</b> How to develop skill at high levels? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2107638404">I could use a little advice from any of the GrandMaster Fletchers out there. I&#39;ve been working the Fletching skill pretty hard (to quote one of the guides on fletchin, making arrows until my eyes bleed) and my skill is now 170.  I&#39;m currently making arrows with Large Nocks, Wood Shafts, Field Points and ceramic vanes.  Unfortunately, it is now becoming teminally expensive to level the skill up (at least with the ceramic vanes).  They are not trivial but are no longer driving my skill up at an acceptable rate.  Before I flush more pp away, could someone with level 200 skill tell me if I should stick with ceramic vanes (if so, until when) or move on to cheap components with steel shafts (until when) and then cheap components with blade points.  Also, I&#39;d like some info on making the high end bows.  For example, is it safe to start working with Oak yet and at what point am I likely not to cry from a failure with Darkwood? I read somewhere that planing tools and knives add 20 to the skill needed to make a bow and that cams are for Oak and Darkwood only.  Do they add to the difficulty of making a bow?  I notice that, since the patch our fletching kit has more spots.  I take it that we can now make 2 cam bows and plane them etc.  Does this actually work (rather not discover a bug by investing good pp, hehe)  What is a good price to charge for the Oak and Ashwood bows or even the trueshot if I get my lazy butt up to do the quest.</div>
