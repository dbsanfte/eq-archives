 </span></blockquote>Do not forget dueling and PVP combat.  The bow is a warrior types ultimate<br/>
defense.  When you are rooted, switch to your bow.  You can still do damage at<br/>
range and if you time your shots you can disrupt a spell.  They are also useful<br/>
for pulling enemies to you and for killing those that are running away.  Also, a<br/>
group with one caster who can root and 5 archers can take  a small breather from<br/>
normal combat by switching weapons.  Also good in normal combat where one of your<br/>
members is hurt.  If he backs off, he can use the bow and usually not build up<br/>
too much aggression.<br/>

Question:  I am interesting in learning more about fletching.  Can some one point<br/>
me to a webpage or FAQ so I do not waste everyone&#39;s time by repeating questions,<br/>
especially of a newbie nature.  Thank you all.<br/>
