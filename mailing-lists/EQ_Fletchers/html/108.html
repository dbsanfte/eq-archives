Well that is  a good idea.. but TS is a lore item and you can only have<br/>
one<br/>
at a time or you lose it ..thus ... i can&#39;t stockpile the Ts bows. or i<br/>
would ... i don&#39;t like to be out marketed ...but i need to raise my<br/>
skill<br/>
lvl fast and thanks to the new tricks i have learn which you all probly<br/>
already know... i will be able to to that rather fast ... god i shudder<br/>
to<br/>
think of how much more pp i have spent that i did not need to ... well<br/>
live<br/>
and learn.<br/>
<br/>
 good huting<br/>

&gt; I would say buy his bows at 100pp until he&#39;s out of materials. Then<br/>
sell<br/>
yours<br/>
&gt; for 250pp :) 150pp for just holding an item for awhile. If you keep<br/>
buying<br/>
him<br/>
&gt; out, he&#39;ll have to constantly travel for materials and he&#39;ll never be<br/>
able<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; compete with you. Unfortunately, this&#39;ll only work if you have one<br/>
hell of<br/>
a lot<br/>
&gt; of plat saved up =P<br/>

&gt; &gt; Well at lvl 105 i made TS bow.. on third attempt ... but have tried<br/>
3<br/>
more<br/>
&gt; &gt; times and falled. so i stand at one out of 6 at lvl 105 ... but i<br/>
have a<br/>
big<br/>
&gt; &gt; bone to pick..i want to know what is fair price to sell bow at.... i<br/>
sell to<br/>
&gt; &gt; my guild members at 100pp and 10 servos and 10 kolka nuts... but to<br/>
non<br/>
&gt; &gt; guild members i sell at 250pp ... but now i have anouther fletcher<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; &gt; bristlebane sever selling the bows to public for 100pp .. and<br/>
harassing<br/>
me<br/>
&gt; &gt; in a very polite way ( he was not rude) to lower my price.. he says<br/>
this<br/>
&gt; &gt; will stop more peole form becoming fletchers... i fail to see his<br/>
&gt; &gt; logic...but his lvl is 190 and mine is 105 so he can pump them out<br/>
farter<br/>
&gt; &gt; that i can... but i have 80 pices of each item. so i can compete and<br/>
my<br/>
&gt; &gt; skill is gettting better .. but my charizma is 85 with buffs and his<br/>
starts<br/>
&gt; &gt; at 90 with out ... so this will be a challange.. my question is<br/>
after<br/>
all<br/>
&gt; &gt; our blood sweat and tears to work our way to master fletchers and<br/>
haveing no<br/>
&gt; &gt; market to speak or to sell our wears ...what is a fair price for a<br/>
bow<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; &gt; is cheap to make for us but has a very limited market ... at 100 pp<br/>
each<br/>
i<br/>
&gt; &gt; see this markert being staturated very very quick.. i can see 100p<br/>
and a<br/>
&gt; &gt; good item in trade or a item worth 200pp in trade ... i&#39;m all for<br/>
barter<br/>
...<br/>
&gt; &gt; but at 100pp per bow in gerneral auction ...seem to me to undermine<br/>
all<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; &gt; our hard work.  please help what is a fair price for bow in open<br/>
market<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;  thanks<br/>
