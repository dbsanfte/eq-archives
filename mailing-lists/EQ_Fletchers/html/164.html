<b>Subject:</b> Charisma Effects... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1855575650">Yes, there is a cap on the effects of Charisma on NPC<br/>
merchants, but it is based on your faction with said<br/>
merchants.<br/>
<br/>
If they &quot;look warmly upon you&quot; then you&#39;ll need a<br/>
minimal charisma to get the best sell and purchase<br/>
prices (say, 85)... if they are amiable, a little more<br/>
(say, 90)... for kindly consider you it&#39;d be about 100<br/>
or so... for Indifferent, likely about 110, and for<br/>
apprehensive it&#39;s about 120 or so... that&#39;s what I&#39;ve<br/>
seen from direct observation of my girlfriend&#39;s human<br/>
bard character.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s hilarious that she gets better prices<br/>
selling with 126 charisma (with CHA items on) to an<br/>
NPC that almost hates her (apprehensive), than I can<br/>
get selling to my dwarven warrior guild (with faction<br/>
indicating that they would enjoy giving me an erotic<br/>
spongebath) but only 68 charisma, with my CHA items<br/>
on. <br/>
<br/>
Again, my observations.  Anyone care to confirm this?<br/>
