<div id="ygrps-yiv-1960764317">Help!<br/>
I need the wisdom of high skill fletchers.<br/>
I am trapped at skill 180 ... and cannot increase!  I have made 1000 arrows <br/>
(200*5) and cannot get to 181!<br/>
I am making ceramic vane arrows --- alternating with steel shafts arrows cuz <br/>
i heard steel shaft increases skill faster (but is more expensive).  I get <br/>
NO &quot;item too trivial&quot; message.  So I assume I&#39;m still gaining skill.<br/>
Is this normal?  wtf ... do we cap at 180?  Is it a level thing?  I am level <br/>
23.  My wis is 92 and int is 91 ... in fact all my stats are over 90... <br/>
except stam (84).<br/>
<br/>
Any input, no matter how remotely trivial, would be appreciated.</div>
