<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-248713015">Hail fellow fletchers,<br/>
<br/>
I have spent most of my 11 seasons in the Qeynos/Surefall Glade/Karanas.  I <br/>
have recently moved to the Freeport area to hunt with friends.  Can anyone <br/>
tell me the best place to buy npc arrows near or in Freeport?<br/>
<br/>
My understanding is that to buy arrow making components I must travel to <br/>
Kelethin, or back to my home in Surefall Glade.  Am I wrong, are there any <br/>
other sources of arrow components near Freeport?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
<br/>
