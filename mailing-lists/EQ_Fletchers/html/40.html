<b>Subject:</b> Master Fletcher Here <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-913640035">I am a Master Fletcher with a skill of 149. Oak bows are not trivial to me.<br/>
<br/>
As of the new patch, I spent 8 plat per point of skill gained. We all need<br/>
to /feedback that each of these &quot;bundles&quot; should be giving us 5x the skill<br/>
checks of the before the patch. Or there aren&#39;t going to be a lot of<br/>
Fletchers left. What this patch did was give people who already have a huge<br/>
lead an unfair advantage.<br/>
<br/>
The only reason I got into Fletching was because it was so cheap. I figured<br/>
eventually I would sell a couple of nice Oaks and that would completely pay<br/>
for the entire skill. (And upto the patch it had). <br/>
<br/>
Now I not only have to deal with the fact that people don&#39;t seem to<br/>
understand the bow. (And there is no /auction in the world that can do that<br/>
in a couple of lines) Let along understand the almost exponential increase<br/>
in cost for a small gain. But now the cost of increasing my skill has<br/>
become absurd.<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to get that rant out in the open. I implore everyone to<br/>
/feedback that the skill checks for Fletching need to be improved.<br/>
<br/>
By the way Vytautas thanks for mentioning my site in your last post!<br/>
