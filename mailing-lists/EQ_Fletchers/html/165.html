<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; I could use a little advice from any of the GrandMaster Fletchers out<br/>
 </span></blockquote>there. I&#39;ve been working the Fletching skill pretty hard (to quote one of<br/>
the guides on fletchin, making arrows until my eyes bleed) and my skill is<br/>
now 170.<br/>
<br/>
Great to hear!!!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; I&#39;m currently making arrows with Large Nocks, Wood Shafts, Field Points<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and ceramic vanes.  Unfortunately, it is now becoming teminally expensive to<br/>
level the skill up (at least with the ceramic vanes).  They are not trivial<br/>
but are no longer driving my skill up at an acceptable rate.  Before I flush<br/>
more pp away, could someone with level 200 skill tell me if I should stick<br/>
with ceramic vanes (if so, until when) or move on to cheap components with<br/>
steel shafts (until when) and then cheap components with blade points.<br/>
<br/>
Keep plugging away, it doesn&#39;t get any cheaper......<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; Also, I&#39;d like some info on making the high end bows.  For example, is it<br/>
 </span></blockquote>safe to start working with Oak yet and at what point am I likely not to cry<br/>
from a failure with Darkwood?<br/>
<br/>
Yes it is safe to work with Oak.  You are not likely to cry from a failure<br/>
on Darkwood, when you can easily pick up 350pp from your bank account and<br/>
click destroy.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; I read somewhere that planing tools and knives add 20 to the skill needed<br/>
 </span></blockquote>to make a bow and that cams are for Oak and Darkwood only.  Do they add to<br/>
the difficulty of making a bow?  I notice that, since the patch our<br/>
fletching kit has more spots.  I take it that we can now make 2 cam bows and<br/>
plane them etc.  Does this actually work (rather not discover a bug by<br/>
investing good pp, hehe)<br/>
<br/>
Probably....  I have no real data on this one...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; What is a good price to charge for the Oak and Ashwood bows or even the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>trueshot if I get my lazy butt up to do the quest.<br/>
<br/>
Ash I sell for 25pp (No tool versions)<br/>
<br/>
Oak I sell for 150 to 175 depending on the tools, and I don&#39;t sell Cammed<br/>
Oak bows (if I did they would be 250).  Trueshot I sell for 300pp, I will<br/>
sell it for 200pp if they give me a staff and I don&#39;t fail it.  I only sell<br/>
2 Darkwoods, both with Planing Tool and Silk, the 1-Cam for 600pp and the<br/>
2-Cam for 750pp..  I have heard, but not tested, that you cannot double cam<br/>
Oak.<br/>
