<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-413525071">II am a Troll Warrior and would really like to start fletching. Question is, <br/>
where I get the parts for arrows? Since I am evil, can not go in most towns. <br/>
Is it impossibly for me to do it? Or is there some merchant somewhere that I <br/>
can buy the stuff from? Thanks.<br/>
