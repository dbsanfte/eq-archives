<div id="ygrps-yiv-535623747">Well, here&#39;s a tidbit about making bows that I discovered the hard way (by<br/>
trying it out).  At skill 170, bows made with Oak, a plane, silk, and 1 cam,<br/>
are trivial.  I suspect that the 2 cam is also but I haven&#39;t tried it (had a<br/>
customer ask for the 1 cam).  Anyone have any idea when (or IF) darkwood<br/>
becomes trivial?  Man, would I laugh hard if I threw a darkwood in with 2<br/>
cams, some silk and a planing tool and get the trivial message (yeah, I<br/>
know, I&#39;m dreaming).  Anyone have any experience with this?  Anyone had any<br/>
spectacular failures working with Darkwood?  Anyone know how (or if) cams<br/>
and planing tools increase the level needed to make a bow (or at which it is<br/>
trivial)?  How about pricing?  I&#39;ve been selling the basic Rough Oak recurve<br/>
bow (hemp string) for 150pp and have sold quite a few.  I sold one 1-cam Oak<br/>
recurve for 200pp.  Am I charging too little?  Too much?  What would you<br/>
sell a darkwood for?</div>
