<div id="ygrps-yiv-726129323">ooh, what is this trick? I haven&#39;t heard of it, I&#39;m still making arrows =P<br/>
Unless the trick is that only the most expensive item counts :) That&#39;s a plat<br/>
saver :)<br/>

&gt; Well that is  a good idea.. but TS is a lore item and you can only have one<br/>
&gt; at a time or you lose it ..thus ... i can&#39;t stockpile the Ts bows. or i<br/>
&gt; would ... i don&#39;t like to be out marketed ...but i need to raise my skill<br/>
&gt; lvl fast and thanks to the new tricks i have learn which you all probly<br/>
&gt; already know... i will be able to to that rather fast ... god i shudder to<br/>
&gt; think of how much more pp i have spent that i did not need to ... well live<br/>
&gt; and learn.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  good huting<br/>

&gt; &gt; I would say buy his bows at 100pp until he&#39;s out of materials. Then sell<br/>
&gt; yours<br/>
&gt; &gt; for 250pp :) 150pp for just holding an item for awhile. If you keep buying<br/>
&gt; him<br/>
&gt; &gt; out, he&#39;ll have to constantly travel for materials and he&#39;ll never be able<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; compete with you. Unfortunately, this&#39;ll only work if you have one hell of<br/>
&gt; a lot<br/>
&gt; &gt; of plat saved up =P<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Well at lvl 105 i made TS bow.. on third attempt ... but have tried 3<br/>
&gt; more<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; times and falled. so i stand at one out of 6 at lvl 105 ... but i have a<br/>
&gt; big<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; bone to pick..i want to know what is fair price to sell bow at.... i<br/>
&gt; sell to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; my guild members at 100pp and 10 servos and 10 kolka nuts... but to non<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; guild members i sell at 250pp ... but now i have anouther fletcher on<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; bristlebane sever selling the bows to public for 100pp .. and harassing<br/>
&gt; me<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; in a very polite way ( he was not rude) to lower my price.. he says this<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; will stop more peole form becoming fletchers... i fail to see his<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; logic...but his lvl is 190 and mine is 105 so he can pump them out<br/>
&gt; farter<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that i can... but i have 80 pices of each item. so i can compete and my<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; skill is gettting better .. but my charizma is 85 with buffs and his<br/>
&gt; starts<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; at 90 with out ... so this will be a challange.. my question is after<br/>
&gt; all<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; our blood sweat and tears to work our way to master fletchers and<br/>
&gt; haveing no<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; market to speak or to sell our wears ...what is a fair price for a bow<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; is cheap to make for us but has a very limited market ... at 100 pp each<br/>
&gt; i<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; see this markert being staturated very very quick.. i can see 100p and a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; good item in trade or a item worth 200pp in trade ... i&#39;m all for barter<br/>
&gt; ...<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; but at 100pp per bow in gerneral auction ...seem to me to undermine all<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; our hard work.  please help what is a fair price for bow in open market<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  thanks<br/>
