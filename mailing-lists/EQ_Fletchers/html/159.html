&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m currently making arrows with Large Nocks, Wood Shafts, Field<br/>
&gt;Points and ceramic vanes.  Unfortunately, it is now becoming<br/>
&gt;teminally expensive to level the skill up (at least with the ceramic<br/>
&gt;vanes).  They are not trivial but are no longer driving my skill up<br/>
&gt;at an acceptable rate.  Before I flush more pp away, could someone<br/>
&gt;with level 200 skill tell me if I should stick with ceramic vanes<br/>
&gt;(if so, until when) or move on to cheap components with steel shafts (until <br/>
&gt;when) and then cheap components with blade points.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Someboady correct me if Ah&#39;m wrong, but Ah seem ta recall readin&#39; somewhere <br/>
that ceramic vanes were bugged an&#39; did not give tha trivial message.  It <br/>
might be another part but Ah&#39;m purty shur that it be tha ceramic vanes.  Ah <br/>
would try makin&#39; tha next hardest arrow in yer progression chart (as long as <br/>
it don&#39; call fur ceramic vanes that is).<br/>
