<div id="ygrps-yiv-1742796695">Seems our precious highway of information has died again.<br/>
I&#39;d like to resuscitate (can&#39;t spell) it again ...at least for a while.  The <br/>
onelist-paladins are having a field-day -- i&#39;ve never seen a list so <br/>
chatterish.<br/>
En tout cas, let&#39;s discuss some high level fletching, shall we?  I think it <br/>
would be great if we all shared what we know of Oak and Darkwood bows to <br/>
help each other.<br/>
For instance, at what level do oak bows become trivial (hemp, silk, shaped, <br/>
cam).<br/>
What about Darkwood?<br/>
Most especially, what is a safe skill to attempt to make a Darkwood (hemp, <br/>
shaped, etc.)<br/>
At skill 132 i made my first oak-hemp.  I have successfully made 3 for 3 up <br/>
to my present skill of 171.  It also takes me about 20plat of investment to <br/>
go up one skill point.<br/>
<br/>
More topics of discussion:  What is the point of class 4-5-6 arrows? You can <br/>
create same dmg arrows in class 1-2-3; using cheaper components!  They&#39;re <br/>
more expensive and aren&#39;t any more accurate.<br/>
<br/>
Well, that&#39;s my two cents.<br/>
