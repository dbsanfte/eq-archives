<div id="ygrps-yiv-1766828704">3 cheap one expensive.. all the way .. when expensive item is trivial go to<br/>
the next expensive on.<br/>
remember 3 cheap on expensive.<br/>
also make a fletchin out fit that you wear jsut to fletch<br/>
as much int wis and cha items as your can get. it helps<br/>
and sell all your training arrows back to merchant and buy more supplies<br/>
then do it over and over and over and over and over again.<br/>

&gt; Hey there,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sorry I can&#39;t answer any of your questions, but your questions have been<br/>
&gt; rolling around in my head for some time.  Specifically, when should you<br/>
move<br/>
&gt; to higher components and when is it OK to move to bows?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have a fletching skill of 50 currently.  I am now using wood shafts,<br/>
&gt; medium nocks, parablolic flights and field points I believe.  When this<br/>
&gt; becomes trivial, which item should I increase?  When should I start making<br/>
&gt; bows and when should I advance the wood?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks for any help.<br/>

&gt; I could use a little advice from any of the GrandMaster Fletchers out<br/>
there.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been working the Fletching skill pretty hard (to quote one of the<br/>
&gt; guides on fletchin, making arrows until my eyes bleed) and my skill is now<br/>
&gt; 170.  I&#39;m currently making arrows with Large Nocks, Wood Shafts, Field<br/>
&gt; Points and ceramic vanes.  Unfortunately, it is now becoming teminally<br/>
&gt; expensive to level the skill up (at least with the ceramic vanes).  They a<br/>
re<br/>
&gt; not trivial but are no longer driving my skill up at an acceptable rate.<br/>
&gt; Before I flush more pp away, could someone with level 200 skill tell me if<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; should stick with ceramic vanes (if so, until when) or move on to cheap<br/>
&gt; components with steel shafts (until when) and then cheap components with<br/>
&gt; blade points.  Also, I&#39;d like some info on making the high end bows.  For<br/>
&gt; example, is it safe to start working with Oak yet and at what point am I<br/>
&gt; likely not to cry from a failure with Darkwood? I read somewhere that<br/>
&gt; planing tools and knives add 20 to t!<br/>
&gt; !<br/>
&gt; !<br/>
&gt; he skill needed to make a bow and that cams are for Oak and Darkwood only.<br/>
&gt; Do they add to the difficulty of making a bow?  I notice that, since the<br/>
&gt; patch our fletching kit has more spots.  I take it that we can now make 2<br/>
&gt; cam bows and plane them etc.  Does this actually work (rather not discover<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; bug by investing good pp, hehe)  What is a good price to charge for the<br/>
Oak<br/>
&gt; and Ashwood bows or even the trueshot if I get my lazy butt up to do the<br/>
&gt; quest.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
