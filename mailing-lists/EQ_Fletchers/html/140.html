<div id="ygrps-yiv-1685582061">Well hello fellow fletchers.  This is a semi-rant, so please pardon it.<br/>
<br/>
I have, I think, decided that I am not making anymore Trueshot Bows for<br/>
anyone.  I am getting tired of the endless parade of idiots in Norrath that<br/>
think my price of 300pp (gone up since I have to now actually gather the<br/>
parts, or argue with some newbie in Greater Faydark over the value of the<br/>
staff, which I would gladly pay 50pp for - more than fair in my opinion for<br/>
a 5th level character).  The typical conversation goes like this.<br/>
<br/>
Me: /auction Trueshot Bow 20 Dam 100 Rng 45 Del 300pp (Ranger Only)<br/>
<br/>
Idiot: /ooc or /auction or /shout Why are you charging so much for a bow<br/>
that costs 1pp to make?<br/>
<br/>
Me: /ooc Well first of all it costs around 15pp per attempt, not to make it,<br/>
so on average I would say it&#39;s closer to 20pp per bow.  Second, would you<br/>
mind telling me where you get Planing tools for 1pp?  This would save me a<br/>
great deal of money in the long run.  And thirdly, why do you want to know<br/>
you are a rogue/warrior/paladin/..... (anything but a ranger normally), and<br/>
this is a ranger only bow.<br/>
<br/>
Idiot: /auction So why are you charging so much for it?  You suk, you are a<br/>
greedy bastard, (I have forgotten the list, but you get the idea), it only<br/>
takes master fletcher to make it.<br/>
<br/>
Me: /ooc And I assume that you think I was simply created with this skill at<br/>
the master level? If not, then you must assume that it cost me nothing to<br/>
get to this level of fletching?<br/>
<br/>
Idiot: /auction Well it&#39;s pretty cheap to raise the skill, cost a friend of<br/>
mine only 50pp to get to master.<br/>
<br/>
Me: /ooc Hmmm interesting, cost me a lot more than that to do it.  I am<br/>
nearing 200 skill and still fail the bow around 40% of time when I try to<br/>
make it.<br/>
<br/>
Idiot: /auction Well I think you suk and are just gouging people for money<br/>
that you don&#39;t deserve.<br/>
<br/>
Me: /ooc Oh and how exactly is it that the Polished Granite Tommy can sell<br/>
for 300pp when it cost the person selling it 0pp to make it?<br/>
<br/>
Idiot: /auction Yeah well that&#39;s different cause they are so hard to get and<br/>
you have to camp the place for hours<br/>
<br/>
Me: /ooc And how exactly is this different from me having to gather the<br/>
parts, and camp the Arrow Vendor for hours to get my skills up?<br/>
<br/>
/who idiot<br/>
No characters match the dsecription in this zone.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Other conversations involve people telling me that my 250pp to 200pp price<br/>
is high just to hit the combine button, I am sure you have all heard them<br/>
before.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry Povar, get someone else to make your trueshots for now, I have had it.<br/>
