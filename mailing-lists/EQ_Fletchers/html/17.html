<div id="ygrps-yiv-1656455759">i recently spent some time building fletching again...<br/>
<br/>
at skill 82 the combo Field, Bone, Shield, Small becomes trivial<br/>
at skill 102 the combo Hooked, Wood, Round, Large becomes trivial<br/>
the cheapest combo i could find that gave skill at 102 was Field, Wood, Wood <br/>
Vane, Large  (approx 1g7s)<br/>
then at 122 (when above becomes trivial) i moved to Field, Wood, Bone Vane, <br/>
Large and it still cheapest... (approx 3g2s)<br/>
<br/>
unfortunately the arrows made are rather less than usable so sell them <br/>
back... you lose about 25 to 33 % but keeps ya going a bit longer...</div>
