<div id="ygrps-yiv-1802065810">The guy I bought my Shaped Oak single cam bow from, offered to try to make me a darkwood single cam, said he succeeded about 1 in 5, failed twice, and was un-willing to try a 3rd time due to money.  Stats were something along the lines of 20 damage, 150 range, 35 delay (best I remember)<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I&#39;m still looking for a double cam bow, and high damage long range arrows, will pay very well.<br/>

     Okay, I just signed up for this list a few hours ago, and I haven&#39;t seen one mail yet, so I&#39;ll see if I can start something up (and check if it is actually working).  I&#39;m Slig (level 8 wood elf ranger) on povar.  I was talking with a friend, and we were wondering if anyone has ever made a darkwood bow, and, if so, what are the stats?<br/>
