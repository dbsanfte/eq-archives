&gt; Hehe funny, you say &quot;It is a fact&quot; - ok, whatever, I am not going to get<br/>
&gt; into a flame war about this, but would be interested to know where you get<br/>
&gt; this &quot;Fact&quot; from.....  I was merely offering some advice that might help<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; see something from a different angle.  I had a &quot;Wis&quot; suit and was able to<br/>
&gt; get my Wisdom up to 98 with it, and had about a 50 percent failure rate on<br/>
&gt; Darkwoods (this is all at my current skill level of 196 since it has not<br/>
&gt; gone up in 4 months).  I ditched my Wis gear to make room for Warrior gear<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; was starting to acquire.  At that point my failure rated started to<br/>
drop....<br/>
&gt; Now another thing that has gone up, other than my dexterity is my level,<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; might even be possible that has something to do with it as well.<br/>

&gt; HEHE.. ok i don&#39;t mind ifyou want to dissagree... but wis is direclty tied<br/>
&gt; to rate of success... and 33% fail of darkwood sends a cool shiver down my<br/>
&gt; spine... i hope i get that rich that 33% fail on dark wood is no big<br/>
deal..<br/>
&gt; and there is no ned to argue about wis it is a fact.. but if you liketo go<br/>
&gt; with out .. no problem... i do not fight with my wis stuff on but i do<br/>
&gt; fletch with it.. i want my failures to be no more that 5% at max 10%.. so<br/>
i<br/>
&gt; go looking for more wis items )<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; good fletching to you<br/>

&gt; &gt; I am going to have to disagree here about the Wisdom thing and<br/>
&gt; failures.....<br/>
&gt; &gt; This is something that I first heard in Beta....   My wisdom is 74, and<br/>
my<br/>
&gt; &gt; Dex is 117, and I don&#39;t fail much on Darkwoods (about 33 percent).  I<br/>
&gt; think<br/>
&gt; &gt; that different skills might take different attributes for success.... My<br/>
&gt; Int<br/>
&gt; &gt; is 102 anyways (no suit needed, I am a gnome)<br/>
