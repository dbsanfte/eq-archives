<br/>
In my last post, I used an Oak bow in my example...<br/>
<br/>
I meant to use an Elm (oak has a lot higher critical hit base value)... <br/>
sorry about that :(<br/>
<br/>
Also, your skill in archery and your strength (mostly archery) play an <br/>
important role in your critical hits.  I&#39;ve been told (not proven) that for <br/>
every five skill levels of archery increase you CH base by 1pt.  Thus, <br/>
having a higher skill and better bow with those class 8 arrows can yield <br/>
critical hits as high as 130 PTS (I&#39;ve actually seen these hits from other <br/>
characters) or more!<br/>
<br/>
So fletch away!...<br/>
