<div id="ygrps-yiv-1106628933">The best way to raise your archery skill is find a group of high level playerfs who dont mind you hanging around them ungrouped, and shoot arrows at their kills.  Use a hickory bow, so there&#39;s no risk of stealing their kill or anything, and so the mob won&#39;t attack you.  If their mobs are red, you&#39;ll increase in skill really fast.  Just be sure to get permission first, or you may piss them off.  I got my skill up quite a bit following a group of sand giant hunters in Oasis, it was really fun to shoot at the bastards, too.<br/>

Was wondering if anyone knows of an archery range (in game) or such where <br/>
one can go and work up your archery skills. I&#39;ve currently used over 200 <br/>
arrows, and have barely made a 5 skill level in archery. Also, does anyone <br/>
know where to find/buy steel and/or ceramic items for fletching/bowyering?<br/>
