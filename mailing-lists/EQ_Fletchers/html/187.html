<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1761322870">Give it a try and learn. The whittling blade and the planing tool do not <br/>
disappear after a failed attempt anymore. As for cams, I believe they do <br/>
disappear on failures. Best rule of thumb I know of is &quot;If the component <br/>
costs more than the wood of the bow, DON&#39;T DO IT!&quot;.</div>
