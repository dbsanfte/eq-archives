&gt;I had heard one say on a board that there was a maximum Charisma which would<br/>
&gt;alter prices at vendor, being 120... I&#39;ve currently sought quite a few Chr<br/>
&gt;items (Stien, Silk Eve. Tunic, Order of Thunder, Leatherfoot Cap, and still<br/>
&gt;need two Oppalines) which would be enough to boost the an average Charisma<br/>
&gt;(75!) to this number... but, it is true?ï¿½ I&#39;m waiting to have a &#39;suit&#39;<br/>
&gt;available so that I may fletch in a few sessions (At 92 skill, need to bug<br/>
&gt;Druid and Necro I know for some Wis and Int items ^-^; ), so probably<br/>
&gt;shouldn&#39;t devote everything to Chr...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not true. I have the same base cha, and got most of the same item.<br/>
when I aquired a Crude Stien, my Cha (with kit) went from 120 to 135.<br/>
Somewhere in that 15point jump is annother price step, as I get<br/>
slightly cheaper prices now from then.  (its only noticable on the big<br/>
items.  Go price out some plate armor).  When I get a Plat Star ruby<br/>
veil (+9/+9 Cha/Dex) I don&#39;t know if I will see another price<br/>
lowering....<br/>
<br/>
BTW my current kit is:  2 oppalinnes, 2 gold cats eye bracers, silk<br/>
shirt, thunder medal, leatherfoot cap, stien, brass ring.  Ive got a<br/>
10slot backpack so they all fit in it.  I vowed that I wouldn&#39;t go<br/>
over 10 items.  This also includes all the easy to get items, the next<br/>
ones are ones like siren hair hood, and other items that I have never<br/>
seen at auc, or only for trade in the 1000+p range.  And thats just to<br/>
steep for my lvl 25 self.</div>
