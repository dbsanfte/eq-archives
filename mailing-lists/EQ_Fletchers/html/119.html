<div id="ygrps-yiv-1263958298">Surefall is much cheaper :) I didn&#39;t pay too much attention, but all the basic<br/>
supplies cost me 6cp in Kelethin and 5cp in Surefall. For a price that low to be<br/>
given a discount means the prices are a LOT lower in general :) My cha is<br/>
naturally 75, magically 98 *grin* :)<br/>

&gt; No trick really just sound stratagey...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1) use 3 cheap items and one expensive item untill that arrow is trivial<br/>
&gt; 2)buy as much Charisima raising stuff as your can find. even if you just<br/>
&gt; ware it while fletching.. get that charisima up up up ... so you can buy<br/>
&gt; cheaper and sell higher.<br/>
&gt; 3) don&#39;t waste time selling arrows to public... make them and sell them back<br/>
&gt; to merchant.... and so on and so on ... yes it will cost lots of money ...<br/>
&gt; but at high master lvl you can finaly make cash at making darkwood bows and<br/>
&gt; TS bows.. but no one want to fail at darkwood belive me.<br/>
&gt; 4) i have found a chart that tells the right combonation of stuff to walk<br/>
&gt; you all the way up to lvl158 or so by the cheapest route... man i wish i had<br/>
&gt; found it at  the start .. and not a lvl 105 ... i would be a rich man if i<br/>
&gt; had.... Oh well.<br/>
&gt; 5) i was told that surrfall prices are 20% cheaper than kelethin for<br/>
&gt; supplies...<br/>
&gt; then i was told it was a myth ... i don&#39;t know the source wants to<br/>
&gt; discourage people from fletching so i don&#39;t know how good his infomation is. </span></blockquote></div>
