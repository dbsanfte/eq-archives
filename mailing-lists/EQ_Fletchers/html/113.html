<b>Subject:</b> The Trueshot Fallacy <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-914227201">Okay, this is probably going to get me a flame or twenty for this, but<br/>
I&#39;m at the point where I really won&#39;t care.<br/>
<br/>
IMHO, the programming team screwed up ROYALLY when they failed to make<br/>
the Trueshot Bow NO DROP.  Think about it... most (or all) of the newly<br/>
found flaming Paladin swords are LORE and NO DROP.  The one who finds<br/>
(or quests for) it is the one who keeps it, or must destroy it.  Why? <br/>
Because otherwise, sooner or later, every guild-twinked lvl 10 Paladin<br/>
would be running around with one.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been rather bitter since they upped the prices of fletching<br/>
components by 5x, to &quot;compensate&quot; for allowing us to make arrows in<br/>
groups of 5, thus effectively creating a &quot;Grandfather Clause&quot; for all<br/>
those who were able to get to 200+ fletching before the patch... those<br/>
chars now have an effective monopoly on the creation and sale of<br/>
darkwoods for quite a while -- at least on the Rathe, from what I&#39;ve<br/>
seen.  What they should have done, was just allow us to place even<br/>
stacks of components into the damn fletching kit, so that WE could<br/>
choose whether or not we want to fletch for experience or in bulk...<br/>
but I digress.<br/>
<br/>
**************************<br/>
<br/>
My point here is that by not making this a NO DROP, the programmers<br/>
have given us the tool to destroy our own fletching economy. I&#39;ve seen<br/>
people asking &quot;what&#39;s the right price to sell it at?&quot;  Well, this is<br/>
how I would answer: <br/>
<br/>
If you feel you want to make a business out of it, then what would you<br/>
sell a darkwood 1-cam compound bow for?  Take that price, and make it<br/>
about 1.5x as much.  Why?  So that Darkwood -- let alone Oak, Ash and<br/>
Elm and Hickory don&#39;t become obsolete!  If Trueshots sell for 100pp,<br/>
why bother buying a player-made Elm or Ash bow when you can just save<br/>
up another 75 or 80pp for a Trueshot?  <br/>
<br/>
For reference, my Lvl. 16 ranger has about 110 or so in fletching, and<br/>
I&#39;ve earned almost everything that I own (except for a combine LS that<br/>
technically is on loan from a friend *g*), and I have yet to make a<br/>
Trueshot for myself out of 9 attempts.  Maybe it&#39;s my pride that&#39;s<br/>
making me write this... perhaps.  But I can and will not allow myself<br/>
to stand idly by while other fletchers destroy OUR OWN economy.  I have<br/>
to say SOMETHING.  The jewelers are rallying to unite together to raise<br/>
their prices back up a bit, to save their economy from a plague of low<br/>
prices.  I see it working.  We, as fletchers, have to wake up a bit --<br/>
before we sink ourselves with Trueshots.<br/>
<br/>
More than $0.02, I realize... and my aplogies to all who disagree and<br/>
read it all the way through, anyway.  :)<br/>
