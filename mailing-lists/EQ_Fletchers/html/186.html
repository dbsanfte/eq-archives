Hello, just completed the trueshot longbow quest a few days ago. When you complete the first part of this quest, Maesyn says &#39;it is unfortunate we will not be able to take the bow to its [second incarnation] for you&#39; and that the bows were one enchanted by the Koada&#39;Dal. He then says if you were to ask the Koada&#39;Dal [where the enchanted bows] were, that you would get an answer. I believe the Koada&#39;Dal are the high elves, however I am not sure where to go next with this quest. Tried talking to some people in felwithe but received no response. Anyone have any information on this? its possible the quest is not finished yet, because from what I understand it is very new. possibly only on the test server thus far ? Anyone who has anything to add about this please do so =P<br/>
<br/>
I spoke to a GM regarding this quest and she informed me that it is indeed complete and functioning. My thought is that they placed a new NPC high elf somewhere that is the next step of this quest. He&#39;s most likely a roamer, as this is a ranger oriented quest, so I guess he would have to be tracked across a few zones. The only thing is... how to find out his name?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I read some other quest notes, and I noticed a couple of things. First, the High Elves used to live in the Desert of Marr, and remember he said they used to make enchanted bows, so that probably is a good place to look.<br/>
My second point relates to High Hold - the only place I&#39;ve seen other than Faydwer that has High Elves. Someone mentioned that one of the princess was a Teir&#39;Dal enchanter in disguise - the person we need to talk to might be in disguise, considering they are an enchanter.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This might be a long shot but there is also a High Elf in Dagnor&#39;s Cauldron at the encampment right out of the pass from the zone to Butcherblock. <br/>
<br/>
Moving away from that, a Half-Elf mentioned that he/she was called a Koada&#39;Dal when questioning in Felwithe. So a Koada&#39;Dal might be a Half-Elf, not a High Elf. Personally, I would love to find this information about the histories, cultures, and legends about the different races of Norrath. Could someone point me to where I can find this stuff? <br/>
   <br/>
<br/>
longshot dont know why any one has not thaught of this but there is a high elf in Crushbone who happens to enchant an weapon the Screaming Mace why not enchant a bow but just a longshot i dont know <br/>
   <br/>
<br/>
Is this a test server quest i&#39;ve tried the keyword you gave and got no responce on Fennin Ro, and in fact the Koada&#39;dal are what high elves call themselves the wood elves are Feir&#39;dal and dark elves are Teir&#39;dal. Did you type the keyword wrong it is not giving any responce from Maesyn<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The keywords are correct... It is likely that this quest has not gone to the live servers yet, nor does it appear to be complete on test as of yet<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Apparantly you should ask them [where the enchanted bows] are. Time to ask every high elf in every nook and cranny the question... :) <br/>
   <br/>
<br/>
Well I tried talking to Princess Lenya in High Hold and no reply. I dunno if there might be other enchanters in HH but I will have to look around...This may be a newly inserted character (Koada&#39;Dal) but I have no idea where to go... Maybe the other guildmasters will give out more info concerning this quest... I am determined to utilize my fletching of 200 for this quest... Wonder what stats will be increased for this new enchanted bow ?? :)<br/>

<br/>
It seems that yes, Koada&#39;Dal are high elf enchanters. The only place in the game I have heard the name Koada&#39;Dal is in highkeep when you do the princess Lenya quest. Princess Lenya is an enchanter, could this have something to do with it?? Oh well.. <br/>
<br/>
--Deriel... desperately wanting an enchanted trueshot.<br/>
<br/>
I do not have a Trueshot bow to experiment with yet but when i spoke with the High Elf Paladin he said he did not want to deal with a Koada&#39;dal like me, Im Half Elf so it may be a Druid you need to &#39;enchant&#39; the bow? Once i have one i will look into it.</div>
