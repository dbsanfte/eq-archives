<div id="ygrps-yiv-2022094862">I would say buy his bows at 100pp until he&#39;s out of materials. Then sell yours<br/>
for 250pp :) 150pp for just holding an item for awhile. If you keep buying him<br/>
out, he&#39;ll have to constantly travel for materials and he&#39;ll never be able to<br/>
compete with you. Unfortunately, this&#39;ll only work if you have one hell of a lot<br/>
of plat saved up =P<br/>

&gt; Well at lvl 105 i made TS bow.. on third attempt ... but have tried 3 more<br/>
&gt; times and falled. so i stand at one out of 6 at lvl 105 ... but i have a big<br/>
&gt; bone to pick..i want to know what is fair price to sell bow at.... i sell to<br/>
&gt; my guild members at 100pp and 10 servos and 10 kolka nuts... but to non<br/>
&gt; guild members i sell at 250pp ... but now i have anouther fletcher on<br/>
&gt; bristlebane sever selling the bows to public for 100pp .. and harassing me<br/>
&gt; in a very polite way ( he was not rude) to lower my price.. he says this<br/>
&gt; will stop more peole form becoming fletchers... i fail to see his<br/>
&gt; logic...but his lvl is 190 and mine is 105 so he can pump them out farter<br/>
&gt; that i can... but i have 80 pices of each item. so i can compete and my<br/>
&gt; skill is gettting better .. but my charizma is 85 with buffs and his starts<br/>
&gt; at 90 with out ... so this will be a challange.. my question is after all<br/>
&gt; our blood sweat and tears to work our way to master fletchers and haveing no<br/>
&gt; market to speak or to sell our wears ...what is a fair price for a bow that<br/>
&gt; is cheap to make for us but has a very limited market ... at 100 pp each i<br/>
&gt; see this markert being staturated very very quick.. i can see 100p and a<br/>
&gt; good item in trade or a item worth 200pp in trade ... i&#39;m all for barter ...<br/>
&gt; but at 100pp per bow in gerneral auction ...seem to me to undermine all of<br/>
&gt; our hard work.  please help what is a fair price for bow in open market<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  thanks<br/>
