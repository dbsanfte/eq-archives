&gt;<br/>
&gt; I WANT TO CRY.. I LVL 182 AND HAVE FAILED 2 TIMES ON<br/>
&gt; DARWOOD AND 2 CAM AND SILK AND PLAINING TOOL.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; BE WARNED.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; BROKE AND BEWILDERED<br/>
&gt; KARVAR BLACKHAWK<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; PS. BLADED NOW TRIVIAL TO ME .. WHAT SHOULDI USE TO IMPROVE MY<br/>
&gt; SKILL NOW? IT IS<br/>
&gt; THE MOST EXPENSIVE ARROW ITEM AND IT IS TRIVIAL. THE STEEL SHAFT<br/>
&gt; DOES NOT SAY<br/>
&gt; TRIVIAL BUST 80 TRYS HAS RESULTED IN NO SKILL POINTS. SO I CONFUSED NOW<br/>
&gt; PLEASE HELP.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Now this is exactly what I have been worried about (I am very very sorry for<br/>
your loss).  Thank God I didn&#39;t try to do this with only a skill of 178,<br/>
now.  Bladed tips stopped pushing my skill up at an acceptable rate at level<br/>
175 so I added in small nocks and it took me to 178 fairly quickly and then<br/>
stopped.  My guess is that I&#39;ll get a few more points if I add in expensive<br/>
fletching or vanes.  So here is the caveat.  Will anyone actually pay for<br/>
the ferrari of bows (2cam + plane+ silk darkwood bow).  I do a small but<br/>
profitable business in Oak.  Is there and actual demand for Darkwood among<br/>
the high level players?</div>
