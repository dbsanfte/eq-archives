<b>Subject:</b> More info on working with Darkwood <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-413975614">snip---&gt;  I was discussing making various bows with a skill of 170<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Yes it is safe to work with Oak.  You are not likely to cry from a failure<br/>
&gt; on Darkwood, when you can easily pick up 350pp from your bank account and<br/>
&gt; click destroy.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Could you expound on this a little?  I have discovered that all Oak bows are<br/>
trivial to me (although I haven&#39;t made the 2 cam variety yet).  Is a skill<br/>
of 170 sufficient to start making Darkwood bows?  At what point do darkwoods<br/>
become trivial if at ever?  What&#39;s the failure rate at 170 vs close to 200.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt; What is a good price to charge for the Oak and Ashwood bows or even the<br/>
&gt; trueshot if I get my lazy butt up to do the quest.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ash I sell for 25pp (No tool versions)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Oak I sell for 150 to 175 depending on the tools, and I don&#39;t sell Cammed<br/>
&gt; Oak bows (if I did they would be 250).  Trueshot I sell for 300pp, I will<br/>
&gt; sell it for 200pp if they give me a staff and I don&#39;t fail it.  I<br/>
&gt; only sell<br/>
&gt; 2 Darkwoods, both with Planing Tool and Silk, the 1-Cam for 600pp and the<br/>
&gt; 2-Cam for 750pp..  I have heard, but not tested, that you cannot<br/>
&gt; double cam<br/>
&gt; Oak.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been thinking along the same way.  I have sold 4 basic Oak bows (hemp),<br/>
each for 150pp and one 1 cam made with planing tool and silk for 200pp<br/>
(should I charge more do you think)?  Is double cam broken for some reason?<br/>
What have you heard?  How much would you sell a basic Darkwood bow for (no<br/>
planing or cams)?</div>
