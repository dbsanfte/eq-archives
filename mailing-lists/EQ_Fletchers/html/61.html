<div id="ygrps-yiv-494012887">I think it&#39;s pretty much confirmed that ceramic and steel staves are not yet implemented.  I am really hoping that the outcome of implementation would be that potters and blacksmiths would make the appropriate staves.  This would be the ultimate in the interweaving of trade skills.  Just think, a potter makes a ceramic staff, a tinkerer makes the cams, an enchanter enchants ore and gives it to a blacksmith who makes arrowheads.  Maybe a tailor could even make the string.  This kind of interrelation is evidenced in other areas, like studded leather.  I think this kind of thing would greatly increase the number of people active in trade skills, and bring us closer to the goal of the player-based economy that verant is always preaching about.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have made several Trueshot Bows, you need to be to the point where you are<br/>
able to make the Darkwood Bow (which makes sense since they are essentially<br/>
the same bow, although the Trueshot has less range).  I am not quite to 200<br/>
skill now and fail about half time (which is the same failure rate I am<br/>
having making Darkwoods).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I want to know this though, has anyone actually found the Steel or Ceramic<br/>
Bow Staves listed in the Bowyer Book?  I have looked in the Centaur Village,<br/>
Aviak Village, all over Kelethin and Surefall Glades, checked the Gypsy<br/>
Camps, etc...  Still no staves.  Someone told me that they actually saw<br/>
someone weilding a Ceramic Bow, but didn&#39;t ask the guy where he got it.  Any<br/>
information on this would be extremely helpful.<br/>
<br/>
Last question, has anyone out there gotten over 200 skill yet?<br/>
