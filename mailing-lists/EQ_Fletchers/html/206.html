<b>Subject:</b> Wisdom Does Effect Trade Skills <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-168985618">One major case in fact- EVERY jeweler (master and above) out there has a set of<br/>
equipment for jeweling- wisdom being the main factor after skill to determine<br/>
failures, then intelligence to raise skills.<br/>
<br/>
I tried this with my cleric- started by brewing, but also on some low level<br/>
jewelry, baking and tailoring stuff.  I was able to reliably make items that<br/>
other characters could not make reliably, even though these other characters had<br/>
much more dex (145 vs 110), agi (138 vs 85), and between 10-20 skill points more<br/>
than I did.  My wisdom is 178, thiers 70.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t believe that, ask a jeweler or go check out the enchanters board<br/>
