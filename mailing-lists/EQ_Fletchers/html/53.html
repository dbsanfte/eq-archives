 What is wrong with this list? I think fletching (now that one success at<br/>
 making arrows equals 5 arrows instead of one) is Da Bomb! I just wanted<br/>
 to know if anyone out there knew if there are better quality components<br/>
 out there than you can readily buy from NPC&#39;s. Any one have some ideas?	<br/>

The major problem with this is that it now takes 5 times as much money to <br/>
raise<br/>
skill as it did before. It&#39;s nice to be able to fletch faster, but it&#39;s not <br/>
worth the 400<br/>
percent increase in training costs. Past skill 122 it takes around 50 <br/>
platinum per<br/>
point of skill, which is insane. We&#39;re talking about arrows, things made out <br/>
of<br/>
wood. We should be melting our platinum down and making arrow shafts out of<br/>
that :) it&#39;d be cheaper!</div>
