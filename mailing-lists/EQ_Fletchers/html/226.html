<div id="ygrps-yiv-123277433">Geez, I hate to sound so desperate ... but I kind of am.  Okay, <br/>
I was fletching today ::the crowd gasps:: :).  I was at 185 working <br/>
on ceramic vane arrows and everything was going fine ... until I hit <br/>
189.  Then my skill increases just STOPPED.  I fletched 3 whole <br/>
backpacks of components without a single increase, and the arrows <br/>
weren&#39;t trivial yet.  So I decided to try the next component up, <br/>
which is steel shafts.  Fletched 2 backpacks of those and still <br/>
nothing.  I then asked another fletcher what I should do and they <br/>
said try using small nocks, steel shafts, silver tipped points, and <br/>
ceramic vanes.  I did ... bought 2 backpacks worth (ouch), and STILL <br/>
no increase.  So my question is ... what do I do now?  I&#39;ve now used <br/>
up 7 backpacks of components without 1 increase ... does it just take <br/>
this long to increase your skill at this point ::prays to every god <br/>
in Norrath that isn&#39;t so::?  Is there something else I should be <br/>
doing?  Or am I just having a bad EQ day (very possible there)?  Any <br/>
suggestions that would ease the fears of this poor, frustrated wood <br/>
elf would be greatly appreciated :).<br/>
