<div id="ygrps-yiv-705516121">I have not had a problem selling Darkwood Bows, and I sell them for 600pp<br/>
(Sold about 7 or 8 now).  Granted it&#39;s a limited market, but I can sell<br/>
them.  Oaks I use mostly for trading, I will not trade a Darkwood for<br/>
anything.  And I like the idea of no pricing on the Trueshot Bow, I will try<br/>
that.<br/>

I find the best tactic is to not mention your price. Just auction that<br/>
you&#39;re<br/>
selling a trueshot. If someone is interested, ask. Send them a tell, NEVER<br/>
answer publicly. If they have a problem, they simply /tell you to jump off a<br/>
cliff and go about their business. The best part is, they&#39;re not ruining<br/>
your<br/>
sales by spreading their ideas of proper pricing to the zone.Unfortunately,<br/>
bows<br/>
don&#39;t sell well period. I&#39;ve never sold one trueshot at 200pp. I sold ONE<br/>
Shaped<br/>
Darkwood 1-Cam Bow for 300pp plus a cracked darkwood shield, and I had to<br/>
give<br/>
away 20 class 6 steel bladed arrows to help him make up his mind. Well, if I<br/>
sell that shield for 300pp (giving me the 600pp for the bow I normally<br/>
charge)<br/>
I&#39;m still making 240pp... (200 skill, haven&#39;t failed a bow yet). Perhaps the<br/>
real market is selling Shaped Darkwood 1-Cams (second best for damage to<br/>
delay.<br/>
Best is trueshot, and that&#39;s 50 less range) to level 30+ warriors :) Sold<br/>
mine<br/>
to a guy who looked REALLY decked out in armor.<br/>
