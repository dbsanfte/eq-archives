<div id="ygrps-yiv-2059136877">The increases were slow for the first 5 points (took at least two backpacks <br/>
full per point), but they &quot;seemed&quot; to pick up after that.  From 193 to 197 <br/>
actually took only 2 backpacks total to get.  The last few points, however, <br/>
again took 3+ backpacks each point to gain.  I did notice major <br/>
success/failure differences when I upped my Wisdom some.  I also put on <br/>
some Int gear to help with the learning of the skill.  Best advise I can <br/>
give is to get as much Wis and Int gear as you can when you work on your <br/>
fletching.  The increased Wis will allow you to succeed more (thus costing <br/>
less in failures), and the increased Int will save your wrists some pain <br/>
since your skill will increase (slightly) faster.<br/>
<br/>
As far as what to make, stick with Ceramic vane arrows.  They do not go <br/>
trivial and they are the only arrow I know of that makes a profit.  If you <br/>
can get your skill up and make a profit at the same time, I say go for it. :)<br/>
<br/>
Good luck on the Darkwood Bow.  After I reached a fletching skill of 200, I <br/>
immediately attempted to make a Compound Darkwood Bow.  I failed the first <br/>
two tries.  On the third try I was successful (thank goodness).  This just <br/>
goes to show that even though the skill is maxed out, it is not guaranteed <br/>
that you will succeed every time.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;I noticed the same thing when I was getting my fletching up.  However, I<br/>
&gt; &gt;did eventually get my fletching to 200 on Ceramic vane arrows.  After I<br/>
&gt; &gt;hit 187 (seems its a random spot for each person), it took 5 backpacks<br/>
&gt; &gt;full before I saw a skill increase.  The going was definantly slow, but it<br/>
&gt; &gt;did eventually go up.  The only consolance I can offer is that the<br/>
&gt; &gt;ceramic vane arrows actually sell back to the vendor for more than the<br/>
&gt; &gt;cost of the parts.  I ended up making a 250plat profit from working to<br/>
&gt; &gt;get my fletching up.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Just my 2copper.<br/>

&gt;      Yes, I noticed that too.  When I sold back the ceramic vane arrows I<br/>
&gt;got a profit (sold for like 6gp + per arrow).  However, when I moved to the<br/>
&gt;next component up, which is steel shafts, the arrows actually sold for less<br/>
&gt;(like 5gp + per arrow) =/.  But you say you did get to 200 with ceramic vane<br/>
&gt;only?  Well then I&#39;ll switch back to that ... because buying all of the most<br/>
&gt;expensive components is just soooo expensive to do.  Did it take you 5<br/>
&gt;backpacks or so of components to get each level increase from then on?  Or<br/>
&gt;was it just when you hit 187, and then got easier from then on?  Because I<br/>
&gt;am NOT looking forward to fletching all those arrows =P.  But oh well, gotta<br/>
&gt;keep reminding myself ... want to make darkwood ... WANT to make darkwood!<br/>
&gt;=)  But thank you all ever so much for the input ... guess I&#39;ll go back to<br/>
&gt;fletching those arrows now *wimpers*<br/>
