<div id="ygrps-yiv-1428637777">hehe ok, was just postulating another theory, but simply because someone<br/>
&quot;thinks&quot; that it is true, does not make it so.  And like I said, this<br/>
&quot;theory&quot; of wisdom started way back in Beta, and you should know that if<br/>
enough people say it, then eventually everybody believes it....  All I know<br/>
is that I too am doing jewelry, along with Fletching, and I have a 74<br/>
Wisdom.  I have roughly the same failure rate (I was keeping track) as<br/>
another jeweler with  wisdom over 100....  So does anyone really know for<br/>
sure???  I say no, no one other than an employee looking at the code can say<br/>
&quot;Yes, wisdom does raise the chances of success&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So to say it is FACT is a misstatement, because you can&#39;t know that.  I was<br/>
merely posting some curious results I got from a low wisdom, high dexterity<br/>
character, stating that it seemed odd that I had a pretty good success rate<br/>
with a low wisdom and a high strength.  If this helps, I minored in Math in<br/>
College and do understand statistics, so I do know that the 25 to 50 data<br/>
points that I have are not that good an idicator, but it was curious is all.<br/>

One major case in fact- EVERY jeweler (master and above) out there has a set<br/>
of<br/>
equipment for jeweling- wisdom being the main factor after skill to<br/>
determine<br/>
failures, then intelligence to raise skills.<br/>
<br/>
I tried this with my cleric- started by brewing, but also on some low level<br/>
jewelry, baking and tailoring stuff.  I was able to reliably make items that<br/>
other characters could not make reliably, even though these other characters<br/>
had<br/>
much more dex (145 vs 110), agi (138 vs 85), and between 10-20 skill points<br/>
more<br/>
than I did.  My wisdom is 178, thiers 70.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t believe that, ask a jeweler or go check out the enchanters<br/>
board<br/>
