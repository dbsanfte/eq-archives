<div id="ygrps-yiv-1053481294">Well at lvl 105 i made TS bow.. on third attempt ... but have tried 3 more<br/>
times and falled. so i stand at one out of 6 at lvl 105 ... but i have a big<br/>
bone to pick..i want to know what is fair price to sell bow at.... i sell to<br/>
my guild members at 100pp and 10 servos and 10 kolka nuts... but to non<br/>
guild members i sell at 250pp ... but now i have anouther fletcher on<br/>
bristlebane sever selling the bows to public for 100pp .. and harassing me<br/>
in a very polite way ( he was not rude) to lower my price.. he says this<br/>
will stop more peole form becoming fletchers... i fail to see his<br/>
logic...but his lvl is 190 and mine is 105 so he can pump them out farter<br/>
that i can... but i have 80 pices of each item. so i can compete and my<br/>
skill is gettting better .. but my charizma is 85 with buffs and his starts<br/>
at 90 with out ... so this will be a challange.. my question is after all<br/>
our blood sweat and tears to work our way to master fletchers and haveing no<br/>
market to speak or to sell our wears ...what is a fair price for a bow that<br/>
is cheap to make for us but has a very limited market ... at 100 pp each i<br/>
see this markert being staturated very very quick.. i can see 100p and a<br/>
good item in trade or a item worth 200pp in trade ... i&#39;m all for barter ...<br/>
but at 100pp per bow in gerneral auction ...seem to me to undermine all of<br/>
our hard work.  please help what is a fair price for bow in open market<br/>
<br/>
 thanks<br/>

&gt; Ok, you all may think I&#39;m lying, and this is going to cause some<br/>
controversy<br/>
&gt; ...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ... but with a mere skill of 114 ...<br/>
&gt; ... on my first attempt at a Trueshot Bow ...<br/>
&gt; ... when everyone of skill 180 was telling me they succeed only 50% of the<br/>
&gt; time ...<br/>
&gt; ...<br/>
&gt; ...<br/>
&gt;    ... I ... made ... a Trueshot Bow.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; *I haven&#39;t gone for a second attempt yet, cuz i know this was the FLUKE of<br/>
&gt; the GODS !  But i believe once your skill hits that 101 mark, you become<br/>
&gt; capable of making the TS bow.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I have a guild member with a skill in Fletching of 162.  Out of 9<br/>
attempts,<br/>
&gt; &gt;he<br/>
&gt; &gt;has made 2 bows.  They are tough!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;snip<br/>
&gt; &gt;&lt;&lt;Another thing, has anyone here successfully made a trueshot longbow<br/>
yet?<br/>
&gt; &gt;I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; &gt;trying to get a good idea of the relative difficulty of this bow, and, if<br/>
&gt; &gt;you&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; &gt;been able to make it, please post your skill level and the nuber of<br/>
&gt; &gt;attempts it<br/>
&gt; &gt;took (or even if you&#39;ve tried, but not made it, post how many times<br/>
you&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; &gt;failed).  I&#39;ll start.  I am skill 140, and I&#39;ve failed 10 times, no<br/>
&gt; &gt;success.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
