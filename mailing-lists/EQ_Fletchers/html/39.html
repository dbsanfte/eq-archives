<b>Subject:</b> Re: are there any master fletcher&#39;s on this board <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-382447506">I am a Master but just barely.  I thankfully got my skill to 102 JUST<br/>
before the patch that made it prohibative to keep raising my skill.  I<br/>
pretty much only make bows now, on demand - money up front as being a<br/>
Bard I can&#39;t even use the practice arrows I make, but either have to<br/>
sell them for a lose to vendors or give them to friends to use when we<br/>
fight.<br/>

&gt; I also belong to an EQ brewing and Tailoring board,<br/>
&gt; however, those boards <br/>
&gt; are actually active.  I get at least 10 msgs a day<br/>
&gt; on each of the other <br/>
&gt; boards from people answering questions and sharing<br/>
&gt; expertise.  I have been <br/>
&gt; on this board for a week and have only received 2<br/>
&gt; msgs (which it seems I am <br/>
&gt; the only one who answered them) and have received no<br/>
&gt; replies regarding my <br/>
&gt; own post a few days ago about fletching past 160. <br/>
&gt; Are there any Master <br/>
&gt; fletcher on this board and why is everyone so quiet?<br/>
