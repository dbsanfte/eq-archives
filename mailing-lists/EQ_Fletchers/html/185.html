<div id="ygrps-yiv-1244550693">I am seeing different results from arrows...  This might or might not help.<br/>
I need to do more testing with some of the 2 through 8 Damage arrows though.<br/>
I primarily use the 1 Dam 150 Range arrows, and am a L33 Warrior using the<br/>
Compound Darkwood - 19 Damage one.  I see a maximum currently of 26 points<br/>
of damage from my arrows, and hit quite often for 23, 24 and 25.  This is<br/>
the most that I have ever seen, and while I see it more often the lower the<br/>
&quot;Con&quot; of the MOB, I do occaisionally see it versus RED&#39;s and YELLOW&#39;s.  I do<br/>
plan on making up a few hundred 2 Damage Arrows and firing them for an<br/>
extended period of time to get a maximum on them too..<br/>
<br/>
I do agree with you though on the arrow cost far out weighing the damage<br/>
that they give.  But at the same time I plan on testing more with higher<br/>
damage arrows to see how much more damage they actually do yeild.<br/>
<br/>
I will keep you posted on my results.<br/>
<br/>
A tip here for you fletcher / archers....  Carry the components to make<br/>
arrows with you to fletch as you go on the road.  The components to make 100<br/>
arrows only take up 4 slots unfletched, and 5 slots fletched.  I normally<br/>
fill up (2) 8 Slot containers for a good hunt and supply arrows to the<br/>
others in my party that use them...  Of course I use my bow as a weapon too<br/>
so I go through a lot of arrows on a hunt.  When pulling, I normally back up<br/>
to the ambush sight pumping arrows into it as I go, and can have a couple of<br/>
hundred points in it as it arrives.  Also if I am not pulling, tell the<br/>
puller to hit auto-attack as they say &quot;INC&quot; and you can use the /assist<br/>
command to get a target on the MOB, then flip off your auto-attack as it<br/>
turns on and shoot it as the puller brings it in.  Takes some coordination,<br/>
but works pretty well.  Lastly, if you have to back out of combat because<br/>
you are hurt, flip off the auto-attack, back off a few feet, and fire into<br/>
the melee with arrows.  This works great for any warriors and rogues, and<br/>
the hybirds that are low on mana or want to save their mana for later.<br/>
<br/>
As you can see, I am not one of those types that would say &quot;I only use it to<br/>
pull&quot; when talking about my bow.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;        Unless Verant does something a bit different about arrows, there&#39;s<br/>
 </span></blockquote>not much sense in making (in my opinion) anything beyond a damage 1 arrow<br/>
unless someone specifically asks for you better and is willing to pay for it<br/>
(which happens very rarely).<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;        Now, the sensible thing, it would seem...is to make arrow damage a<br/>
 </span></blockquote>multiplier of bow damage...given that arrow cost basically doubles for each<br/>
additional damage point. Otherwise, it&#39;s simply not cost efficient to use<br/>
them.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;        With the present system, bow damage + arrow damage = total damage.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A damage 1 arrow costs, say 1sp, and adds 1 damage to your 19 damage bow for<br/>
a total of 20 damage max.  A damage 2 arrow costs 2sp and adds 2 damage to<br/>
your 19 damage bow for a total of 21 damage max.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;        For the 2sp I spent on a 2 damage arrow doing 21 max damage, I<br/>
 </span></blockquote>could have made two 1 damage arrows with a total damage potential of 40.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;        And of course, it gets worse the higher you go...spend 8sp on one<br/>
 </span></blockquote>4 damage arrow with a total potential damage of 23, or 8sp on eight 1 damage<br/>
arrows with a total potential damage of 160?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;        This of course, discounts crits, but those are not significantly<br/>
 </span></blockquote>higher to the point of justifying the ridiculous cost.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;        The other sensible change would be to simply adjust the cost of<br/>
 </span></blockquote>making the arrows more in line with their actual value.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;        If Verant is really interested in making fletching a viable trade,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>(bowyering is) they need to make one of these adjustments, and I heartily<br/>
encourage my fellows to join me in suggesting a change.<br/>
