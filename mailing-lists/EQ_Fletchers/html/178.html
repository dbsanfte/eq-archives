&gt;How about pricing?  I&#39;ve been selling the basic Rough Oak recurve<br/>
&gt;bow (hemp string) for 150pp and have sold quite a few.  I sold one<br/>
&gt;1-cam Oak recurve for 200pp.  Am I charging too little?  Too much?<br/>
&gt;What would you sell a darkwood for?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, I havn&#39;t been making bows to sell lately but I always used a rule of <br/>
thumb of pricing the bows to double your cost of materials.  Because there <br/>
is always a chance of failure, this will cover your expenses incase you <br/>
screw up.  Now, if your making trivial bows to sell, you might want to lower <br/>
your price.  The only problem that I have with doing that is that you might <br/>
undercut someone else, that has a lower skill than you, that is using the <br/>
same rule of thumb.<br/>
<br/>
I also recomend that rule of thumb to people when buying.  If they know the <br/>
approximate cost on the materials (keeping in mind that people have <br/>
different charisma), don&#39;t pay more than double the cost of materials.<br/>
<br/>
Well.. that&#39;s my 2cp worth...<br/>
Heh.. can&#39;t even remember my skill lvl &#39;cause I&#39;ve been buying armor, <br/>
weapons, and jewelery and don&#39;t have the funds at the moment to further my <br/>
training.<br/>
