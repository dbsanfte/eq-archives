<br/>
I have a friend who is a jeweler.  He has experienced the same symptoms.  <br/>
Around 185 or so he suddenly stopped going up in skill.  In the past 6 <br/>
months he has gone up something like 3 points, and he makes lots of jewelry <br/>
(he enjoys being a merchant).  Not sure if this is applicable to fletching <br/>
but interesting none the less.<br/>

      Geez, I hate to sound so desperate ... but I kind of am.  Okay,<br/>
I was fletching today ::the crowd gasps:: :).  I was at 185 working<br/>
on ceramic vane arrows and everything was going fine ... until I hit<br/>
189.  Then my skill increases just STOPPED.  I fletched 3 whole<br/>
backpacks of components without a single increase, and the arrows<br/>
weren&#39;t trivial yet.  So I decided to try the next component up,<br/>
which is steel shafts.  Fletched 2 backpacks of those and still<br/>
nothing.  I then asked another fletcher what I should do and they<br/>
said try using small nocks, steel shafts, silver tipped points, and<br/>
ceramic vanes.  I did ... bought 2 backpacks worth (ouch), and STILL<br/>
no increase.  So my question is ... what do I do now?  I&#39;ve now used<br/>
up 7 backpacks of components without 1 increase ... does it just take<br/>
this long to increase your skill at this point ::prays to every god<br/>
in Norrath that isn&#39;t so::?  Is there something else I should be<br/>
doing?  Or am I just having a bad EQ day (very possible there)?  Any<br/>
suggestions that would ease the fears of this poor, frustrated wood<br/>
elf would be greatly appreciated :).<br/>
