I know you are all probably sick to death of answering stupid newbie<br/>
questions about fletching but I need to ask as I don&#39;t want to throw what<br/>
little money I have into nothingness :)<br/>
<br/>
I am just setting out on my fletching career .. I am not doing this to make<br/>
lots of cash but to save a little by making my own arrows and enhancing my<br/>
char a little for roleplay .. I have spent 5 pracs in fletching so far and<br/>
intend to spend more when I level .. possibly another 10/15 .. is this a<br/>
good idea? What should I be making to improve me skills?<br/>
<br/>
Any advice in my eyes is good advice and I really need some .. those damned<br/>
books I bought are no good at all .. I would have been better off buying<br/>
components :)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance<br/>
