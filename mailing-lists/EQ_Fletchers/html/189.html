<b>Subject:</b> The second incarnation of the Trueshot bow <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1273651852">Well here is a update... I have tried all of Felewthe with no luck and the High elf in OOT ..I have been looking many places for this elf that will respond to the phrase {where the enchanted bows}...<br/>
I have had no luck so I have put forward a prize / quest for this information... I will give a 100pp or a TS bow to the person that gives me the name and location of the high elf that responds to the statement above. I&#39;m on bristlebane server only so this prizes is limited to this server.. but I will share any info I get with you my fellow master fletchers..<br/>
Take care <br/>
