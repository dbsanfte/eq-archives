<div id="ygrps-yiv-2135128033">Who all still keeps their book? hehe i really think it does bring you luck <br/>
as my skill hasn&#39;t increased much lately. I&#39;m at an average skill since i <br/>
stopped at the patch 105 i think. And wanted to tell you slig that your in <br/>
the right area. Kelethin and Surefall are the best places to sell for a few <br/>
reasons, one is they are highly traveled, and also that barbarian warriors <br/>
can use bows near surefall. as well as of course the rangers, and also in <br/>
kelethin you have all the different races comming in to crushbone all the <br/>
time hearing tells. both help. Just thought i&#39;d say hello since it&#39;s been <br/>
forever since i posted last and good to see some other fletchers on povar :)<br/>
