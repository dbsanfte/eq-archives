&gt;     If you thought about it there really is no point to a magical bow. The <br/>
&gt;arrow is the thing that actually hits the monster. Now if the bow was a <br/>
&gt;magic bow and it did something such as make it so you never missed your <br/>
&gt;target then that would be a very usful magic bow but other than that I dont <br/>
&gt;beleive that just a plain magic bow has any use, the arrow is the thing <br/>
&gt;that needs to be magic.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     And to answer your second question no I cant make a Trueshot &gt;Longbow, <br/>
&gt;but I have seen one person selling them on my server. He &gt;said you do have <br/>
&gt;to be a very high level fletcher to make one though. &gt;I will see if I can <br/>
&gt;find him again.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Another thought I had was what if we could have our arrows do &gt;something <br/>
&gt;useful other than just pull monsters. What if we could make &gt;an arrow that <br/>
&gt;also poisoned the monster, diseased it, or something to &gt;that effect. I <br/>
&gt;think thats something we should all look into.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m probably wrong - but I thought you got the Trueshot Longbow from a <br/>
quest? Or do you just get the components to make one from the quest?</div>
