<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-447854481">Power to ya, man!  I agree totally, although I think the trueshot should sell for less than a Drakwood, actually, as a darkwood is a better bow, IMHO, since it has 1.5x the range.  I agree with your comment as well about how Verant screwed us over with the 5x arrow patch.  I was at 50 or so skill when it happened, and I have painstakingly raise my skill up to 140, and now I&#39;m considering giving up fletching altogether, as the economy just seems all screwed up, and I&#39;m having quite a bit of trouble selling any bows.  I do agree that fletching was a bit imbalanced previously as being one of the cheapest and easiest trade skills to bring to mastery, and it is much more balanced now, but if they were going to do this, they should have done it from the start.  If there are people who already brought their skill up to 200 at 1/5th of the cost, it&#39;s not fair to those of us who werent that high yet at the time of the patch.  I really feel that something has to be done about fletching soon, or all of its practitioners will get fed up and discouraged and give it up.<br/>
<br/>
     And, yes, it would have simplified matter greatly if this bow had been made no-drop, but then it would become pretty useless, as if you have a high enough skill to make it, you could probably make a drakwood for yourself.  If they made it no-drop, they&#39;d have to make it a better bow.<br/>

Okay, this is probably going to get me a flame or twenty for this, but<br/>
I&#39;m at the point where I really won&#39;t care.<br/>
<br/>
IMHO, the programming team screwed up ROYALLY when they failed to make<br/>
the Trueshot Bow NO DROP.  Think about it... most (or all) of the newly<br/>
found flaming Paladin swords are LORE and NO DROP.  The one who finds<br/>
(or quests for) it is the one who keeps it, or must destroy it.  Why? <br/>
Because otherwise, sooner or later, every guild-twinked lvl 10 Paladin<br/>
would be running around with one.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been rather bitter since they upped the prices of fletching<br/>
components by 5x, to &quot;compensate&quot; for allowing us to make arrows in<br/>
groups of 5, thus effectively creating a &quot;Grandfather Clause&quot; for all<br/>
those who were able to get to 200+ fletching before the patch... those<br/>
chars now have an effective monopoly on the creation and sale of<br/>
darkwoods for quite a while -- at least on the Rathe, from what I&#39;ve<br/>
seen.  What they should have done, was just allow us to place even<br/>
stacks of components into the damn fletching kit, so that WE could<br/>
choose whether or not we want to fletch for experience or in bulk...<br/>
but I digress.<br/>
<br/>
**************************<br/>
<br/>
My point here is that by not making this a NO DROP, the programmers<br/>
have given us the tool to destroy our own fletching economy. I&#39;ve seen<br/>
people asking &quot;what&#39;s the right price to sell it at?&quot;  Well, this is<br/>
how I would answer: <br/>
<br/>
If you feel you want to make a business out of it, then what would you<br/>
sell a darkwood 1-cam compound bow for?  Take that price, and make it<br/>
about 1.5x as much.  Why?  So that Darkwood -- let alone Oak, Ash and<br/>
Elm and Hickory don&#39;t become obsolete!  If Trueshots sell for 100pp,<br/>
why bother buying a player-made Elm or Ash bow when you can just save<br/>
up another 75 or 80pp for a Trueshot?  <br/>
<br/>
For reference, my Lvl. 16 ranger has about 110 or so in fletching, and<br/>
I&#39;ve earned almost everything that I own (except for a combine LS that<br/>
technically is on loan from a friend *g*), and I have yet to make a<br/>
Trueshot for myself out of 9 attempts.  Maybe it&#39;s my pride that&#39;s<br/>
making me write this... perhaps.  But I can and will not allow myself<br/>
to stand idly by while other fletchers destroy OUR OWN economy.  I have<br/>
to say SOMETHING.  The jewelers are rallying to unite together to raise<br/>
their prices back up a bit, to save their economy from a plague of low<br/>
prices.  I see it working.  We, as fletchers, have to wake up a bit --<br/>
before we sink ourselves with Trueshots.<br/>
<br/>
More than $0.02, I realize... and my aplogies to all who disagree and<br/>
read it all the way through, anyway.  :)<br/>
