&gt;Could you expound on this a little?  I have discovered that all Oak bows <br/>
&gt;are<br/>
&gt;trivial to me (although I haven&#39;t made the 2 cam variety yet).  Is a skill<br/>
&gt;of 170 sufficient to start making Darkwood bows?  At what point do <br/>
&gt;darkwoods<br/>
&gt;become trivial if at ever?  What&#39;s the failure rate at 170 vs close to 200.<br/>
