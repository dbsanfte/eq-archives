<div id="ygrps-yiv-833293332"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Another thought I had was what if we could have our arrows do<br/>
&gt; something useful other than just pull monsters. What if we could make<br/>
&gt; an arrow that also poisoned the monster, diseased it, or something to<br/>
&gt; that effect. I think thats something we should all look into.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not gonna say where i&#39;ve been getting them, but I am stockpiling the<br/>
arrows of poison i&#39;ve been getting as loot off a certain mob.  They are<br/>
quite a nice arrow.. I have 74 as of today.  Too bad i&#39;m a cleric. <br/>
Whenever i get 100 they&#39;re going to a guild buddy.</div>
