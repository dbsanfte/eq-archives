<div id="ygrps-yiv-339968753">Hehe funny, you say &quot;It is a fact&quot; - ok, whatever, I am not going to get<br/>
into a flame war about this, but would be interested to know where you get<br/>
this &quot;Fact&quot; from.....  I was merely offering some advice that might help you<br/>
see something from a different angle.  I had a &quot;Wis&quot; suit and was able to<br/>
get my Wisdom up to 98 with it, and had about a 50 percent failure rate on<br/>
Darkwoods (this is all at my current skill level of 196 since it has not<br/>
gone up in 4 months).  I ditched my Wis gear to make room for Warrior gear I<br/>
was starting to acquire.  At that point my failure rated started to drop....<br/>
Now another thing that has gone up, other than my dexterity is my level, it<br/>
might even be possible that has something to do with it as well.<br/>

HEHE.. ok i don&#39;t mind ifyou want to dissagree... but wis is direclty tied<br/>
to rate of success... and 33% fail of darkwood sends a cool shiver down my<br/>
spine... i hope i get that rich that 33% fail on dark wood is no big deal..<br/>
and there is no ned to argue about wis it is a fact.. but if you liketo go<br/>
with out .. no problem... i do not fight with my wis stuff on but i do<br/>
fletch with it.. i want my failures to be no more that 5% at max 10%.. so i<br/>
go looking for more wis items )<br/>
<br/>
good fletching to you<br/>

&gt; I am going to have to disagree here about the Wisdom thing and<br/>
failures.....<br/>
&gt; This is something that I first heard in Beta....   My wisdom is 74, and my<br/>
&gt; Dex is 117, and I don&#39;t fail much on Darkwoods (about 33 percent).  I<br/>
think<br/>
&gt; that different skills might take different attributes for success.... My<br/>
Int<br/>
&gt; is 102 anyways (no suit needed, I am a gnome)<br/>
