<div id="ygrps-yiv-1770108825">I had heard one say on a board that there was a maximum Charisma which would<br/>
alter prices at vendor, being 120... I&#39;ve currently sought quite a few Chr<br/>
items (Stien, Silk Eve. Tunic, Order of Thunder, Leatherfoot Cap, and still<br/>

shouldn&#39;t devote everything to Chr...<br/>
