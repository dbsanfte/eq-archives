<div id="ygrps-yiv-1758573834">Why did this list just go completely dead? i<br/>
haven&#39;t had an e-mail in something like 4 days!<br/>
I want to revive this list by asking the master <br/>
fletchers out there if they could compile a list<br/>
for the skill level when certain items become <br/>
trivial. Also could someone give me a good price<br/>
list for arrows and bows. I just want to be fair<br/>
to my customers and to the rest of you if I&#39;m not<br/>
charging enough. Please let&#39;s jumpstart this worn<br/>
out mailing list and turn it into the powerful<br/>
think tank it once was.<br/>
