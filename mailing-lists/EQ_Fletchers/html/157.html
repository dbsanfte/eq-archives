&gt; I could use a little advice from any of the GrandMaster Fletchers out<br/>
there. I&#39;ve been working the Fletching skill pretty hard (to quote one of<br/>
the guides on fletchin, making arrows until my eyes bleed) and my skill is<br/>
now 170.  I&#39;m currently making arrows with Large Nocks, Wood Shafts, Field<br/>
Points and ceramic vanes.  Unfortunately, it is now becoming teminally<br/>
expensive to level the skill up (at least with the ceramic vanes).  They are<br/>
not trivial but are no longer driving my skill up at an acceptable rate.<br/>
Before I flush more pp away, could someone with level 200 skill tell me if I<br/>
should stick with ceramic vanes (if so, until when) or move on to cheap<br/>
components with steel shafts (until when) and then cheap components with<br/>
blade points.  Also, I&#39;d like some info on making the high end bows.  For<br/>
example, is it safe to start working with Oak yet and at what point am I<br/>
likely not to cry from a failure with Darkwood? I read somewhere that<br/>
planing tools and knives add 20 to the skill needed to make a bow and that<br/>
cams are for Oak and Darkwood only.  Do they add to the difficulty of making<br/>
a bow?  I notice that, since the patch our fletching kit has more spots.  I<br/>
take it that we can now make 2 cam bows and plane them etc.  Does this<br/>
actually work (rather not discover a bug by investing good pp, hehe)  What<br/>
is a good price to charge for the Oak and Ashwood bows or even the trueshot<br/>
if I get my lazy butt up to do the quest.<br/>
