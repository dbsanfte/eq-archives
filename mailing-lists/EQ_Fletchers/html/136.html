     LOL.  I am really starting to get fed up with Verant.  When I first<br/>
started playing EQ, I thought it was the greatest game ever made.  The<br/>
thing that thrilled me the most was that it wasnt a pure hack-and-slash<br/>
game.  It had things in it that were even lacking in most of the old<br/>
pencil and paper games!  It had a wide variety of trade skills that one<br/>
could participate in if they didnt want to spend all their time going<br/>
out and killing stuff.  I immediately got into tailoring.  After a<br/>
while, I got sick of hunting down green wolves for hours, to end up<br/>
making a few gold selling pw to newbies, and decided to go with<br/>
something new.  Being a ranger, I took up fletching.  I had found my<br/>
calling, it seemed.  I clicked until my fingers bled, and finally got my<br/>
skill up enough to make my first hickory.  It sold almost immediately.<br/>
It sent on similar to this for a while.  Making a little cash here and<br/>
there, bringing my skill up, and taking time out to go adventuring every<br/>
now and then.  Suddenly, things began to change.  When my skill was at<br/>
60 or 70 or so, they put a patch on that made it cost 5 times as much to<br/>
up my skill.  So, I took up pottery to make money and give myself the<br/>
edge to try to catch up to the lucky ones who got their skill up around<br/>
200 before the patch.  I was still making money selling elm, and<br/>
eventually ash, as well.  Then the trueshot comes along.  Suddenly, I<br/>
can&#39;t seem to sell ash anymore.  I do the quest myself, hoping to make<br/>
up for it with tremendous profits, and I fail 10 times in a row with<br/>
skill 140.  I think to myself, well, no matter, I&#39;ll do more pottery to<br/>
get my skill up enough to make one.  One day, I go to buy sketches, and<br/>
they&#39;ve gone up in price to where profits are now impossible!<br/>
<br/>
     Sorry about the length of this rant, but I&#39;ve been pissed.  They<br/>
say they want a player based economy, but it semms that with every patch<br/>
comes something to make trade skills harder!  They were hard enough as<br/>
it was before all of these patches.  Now you&#39;d have to be insane to take<br/>
all the time away from adventuring and leveling and making money to sit<br/>
around clicking combine with no hope of ever getting any return on your<br/>
investment.  Of course, they havent done a thing with Jewelcrafting!<br/>
This is what really irks me!  Enchanters are the only ones who can<br/>
really do this successfully, and they&#39;re making thousands of plat off of<br/>
it, while us fletchers are struggling to get back half of what we&#39;ve<br/>
spent!<br/>
<br/>
     I&#39;m seriously thinking about quitting the game, and as soon as<br/>
Asheron&#39;s Call comes out, they&#39;ll have a really hard time keeping me in<br/>

Here is a formula that came to my head as I read this post.<br/>
<br/>
EQ + (poorly thought out patches * many patches) + bad support = UO<br/>
<br/>
Ouch<br/>

     There&#39;s lots of great charts for this type of info at the ragers&#39;<br/>
glade website.  The url is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://empty.com/rangers">http://empty.com/rangers</a> .  So what does<br/>
everyone think about the latest patch making micro servos and dwarven<br/>
wire no drop?  I think it was the wrong approach.  They should have just<br/>
made the bow no drop, and left the component gathering open in case some<br/>
newbies wanted to make a bit of cash killing rogue clockworks.  I also<br/>
heard a rumor that the lantern Jyle no longer gives the treant wood, and<br/>
instead has been giving fire beetle eyes.  Can anyone confirm this?<br/>

Why did this list just go completely dead? i<br/>
haven&#39;t had an e-mail in something like 4 days!<br/>
I want to revive this list by asking the master <br/>
fletchers out there if they could compile a list<br/>
for the skill level when certain items become <br/>
trivial. Also could someone give me a good price<br/>
list for arrows and bows. I just want to be fair<br/>
to my customers and to the rest of you if I&#39;m not<br/>
charging enough. Please let&#39;s jumpstart this worn<br/>
out mailing list and turn it into the powerful<br/>
think tank it once was.<br/>
