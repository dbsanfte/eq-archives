<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1944695381">Well, I subscribe to the list as a voyeur, only because right now I don&#39;t<br/>
seem to be able to find the supplies needed to start up fletching.  Once I<br/>
do find them I will start fletching.  By the way I play a Dark Elf, so I am<br/>
just about KOS in any good town.  Verant has seen to gone out of the way and<br/>
not even given us the supplies needed to start this skill (kind of like the<br/>
enchant series of spells).  Like what kind of Dark Elf even uses a bow?<br/>
(answer: shadow knight).  I would love to hit something like 35pts with an<br/>
arrow.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I do have a question.  I have seen listed a steal bow and a ceramic<br/>
bow... anyone know where to find these or is it a not implemented item(s) so<br/>
far?  or do you have to start blacksmithing and ceramic skills to make the<br/>
items?  Also anyone find any magic arrows, so we can hit wisps, and ghouls,<br/>
etc?<br/>
<br/>
Also, I haven&#39;t checked the entire city (again) lately so they could have<br/>
added the items and I would not know about it.<br/>

I also belong to an EQ brewing and Tailoring board, however, those boards<br/>
are actually active.  I get at least 10 msgs a day on each of the other<br/>
boards from people answering questions and sharing expertise.  I have been<br/>
on this board for a week and have only received 2 msgs (which it seems I am<br/>
the only one who answered them) and have received no replies regarding my<br/>
own post a few days ago about fletching past 160.  Are there any Master<br/>
fletcher on this board and why is everyone so quiet?<br/>
