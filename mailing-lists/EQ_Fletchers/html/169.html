&lt;&lt; How about pricing?  I&#39;ve been selling the basic Rough Oak recurve<br/>
 bow (hemp string) for 150pp and have sold quite a few.  I sold one 1-cam Oak<br/>
 recurve for 200pp.  Am I charging too little?  Too much?  What would you<br/>
 sell a darkwood for? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
okay, according to my cost info sheet, the Rough Oak recurve hemp string <br/>
costs about 85pp 9gp 6sp 6cp give or take a bit, so 150pp is a dandy price to <br/>
get on it.  a 1-cam oak recurve hemp string costs 132pp 8gp 5sp, so again <br/>
200pp is a very good price to get on it.  So if you are actually getting <br/>
people to pay that much for them, more power to you.<br/>
