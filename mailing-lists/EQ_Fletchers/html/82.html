<div id="ygrps-yiv-310237864">I have a guild member with a skill in Fletching of 162.  Out of 9 attempts, he<br/>
has made 2 bows.  They are tough!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
snip<br/>
&lt;&lt;Another thing, has anyone here successfully made a trueshot longbow yet?  I&#39;m<br/>
trying to get a good idea of the relative difficulty of this bow, and, if you&#39;ve<br/>
been able to make it, please post your skill level and the nuber of attempts it<br/>
took (or even if you&#39;ve tried, but not made it, post how many times you&#39;ve<br/>
failed).  I&#39;ll start.  I am skill 140, and I&#39;ve failed 10 times, no success.&gt;&gt;</div>
