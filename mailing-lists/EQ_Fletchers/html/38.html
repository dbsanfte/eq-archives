<b>Subject:</b> are there any master fletcher&#39;s on this board <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1833896247">I also belong to an EQ brewing and Tailoring board, however, those boards <br/>
are actually active.  I get at least 10 msgs a day on each of the other <br/>
boards from people answering questions and sharing expertise.  I have been <br/>
on this board for a week and have only received 2 msgs (which it seems I am <br/>
the only one who answered them) and have received no replies regarding my <br/>
own post a few days ago about fletching past 160.  Are there any Master <br/>
fletcher on this board and why is everyone so quiet?<br/>
