<div id="ygrps-yiv-933480681">A pretty big update this week-end:<br/>
<br/>
Added N. Ro, Made Changes to Lesser Faydark, Re-did Misty Thicket, Added a<br/>
very basic Blackburrow, Under map of part of the area. I don&#39;t know when I<br/>
will get back there, so I posted what I had.<br/>
<br/>
Added an Faction Page with the few factions I know of, and who to kill to<br/>
change those factions.<br/>
<br/>
Added an Equipment Page with Weapon info. This info is stored in a Access<br/>
Database so I can create Class specific or skill specific pages. Please let<br/>
me know how you would want to view this info. <br/>
<br/>
Also, I would be interested in getting some info on weapons that I do not<br/>
have. Please send me a edited screenshot of the weapon info box. Please DO<br/>
NOT send me the entire shot, I don&#39;t have a fast enough connection. Just<br/>
the box please. I will try to give a little credit to people that help out.<br/>
To take a screenshot hit the - key on the numberpad.<br/>
<br/>
Changed both the Fletching and Smithing Guides with more upto date info.<br/>
Also made some editing changes to make them more readable. If anything is<br/>
unclear to anyone please e-mail me so I can clear it up.<br/>
