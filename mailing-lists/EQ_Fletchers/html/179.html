<div id="ygrps-yiv-87763180">Yes, there is a demand for &#39;darkwoods&#39;, especially among higher level <br/>
warriors (most of which don&#39;t invest in fletching at all) and some higher <br/>
level rangers who never bothered to start fletching.  The catch, you most <br/>
likely have to be on an older server (ie. one with more high level players, <br/>
higher economy, etc...) or you won&#39;t be able to find anyone who can actually <br/>
afford a reasonable price.<br/>
<br/>
Also, on another note, you can actually sell your higher damage arrows to <br/>
players (instead of merchants) while still taking a loss, but not as much of <br/>
one.  &quot;Why will someone buy MY expensive arrows&quot; you may ask?  Well, for <br/>
those of us who can hit for critical damage with bows, if you use a higher <br/>
class arrow (classes 1-8), for each class of arrow, you get two extra points <br/>
of dammage when you get a critical hit...<br/>
example:  you get a critical hit for 26 [24pt base with a (2 x class 1) <br/>
bonus] with your oak bow (bow types also play a part in damage, but I don&#39;t <br/>
know what yet...probably your base damage) and your class 1 arrow.<br/>
          If you had been using a class 8 arrow with that same oak bow, your <br/>
hit would&#39;ve been for 40 [22pt base + (2pts x class 8)]<br/>
<br/>
It can&#39;t be proven numericaly, but people seem to notice that their critical <br/>
hits come more often when using better arrows.<br/>
<br/>
Combine the critical hits with the increased maximum normal hit just for <br/>
using the arrows and I think you will begin to see a difference in how <br/>
useful that nice archery skill actually is.  If you have trouble convincing <br/>
a potential customer... challenge him/her to an archery &quot;contest&quot; and show <br/>
them the numbers in action... Let them use their &#39;old&#39; arrows, then give <br/>
them a bundle of your expensive kind... I don&#39;t think you will need to try <br/>
to convince them after such a powerful demonstration.  On a note, don&#39;t try <br/>
to actually make money on the sale of these arrows, just take less of a loss <br/>
than you would from a merchant (you may even be able to break even, but <br/>
don&#39;t get your hopes up.)<br/>
<br/>
Still think those expensive arrow are just &quot;skill fodder&quot;?<br/>

&gt;the ferrari of bows (2cam + plane+ silk darkwood bow).  I do a small but<br/>

&gt;the high level players? </span></blockquote></div>
