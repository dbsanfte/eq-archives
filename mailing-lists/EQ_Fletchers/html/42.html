Also a quote from one of the SK news groups<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Perhaps that will convince you that no one<br/>
&gt;can tank a spectre. To put it simply, one must Ensnare or Darkness the<br/>
&gt;creature and run around until it is as dead as possible, then going oom<br/>
&gt;before you engage. No matter what armor you got and how many HP you have,<br/>
&gt;the spectre is still going to hit for 60, 70, 50, 80 in one round. Now, how<br/>
&gt;many of those rounds can 1000HP take?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wondering how much damage you can inflict with an arrow, right about now,<br/>
although it would probably need to be a magic arrow(or would a magic bow be<br/>
good enough?).<br/>

I am a Master Fletcher with a skill of 149. Oak bows are not trivial to me.<br/>
<br/>
As of the new patch, I spent 8 plat per point of skill gained. We all need<br/>
to /feedback that each of these &quot;bundles&quot; should be giving us 5x the skill<br/>
checks of the before the patch. Or there aren&#39;t going to be a lot of<br/>
Fletchers left. What this patch did was give people who already have a huge<br/>
lead an unfair advantage.<br/>
<br/>
The only reason I got into Fletching was because it was so cheap. I figured<br/>
eventually I would sell a couple of nice Oaks and that would completely pay<br/>
for the entire skill. (And upto the patch it had).<br/>
<br/>
Now I not only have to deal with the fact that people don&#39;t seem to<br/>
understand the bow. (And there is no /auction in the world that can do that<br/>
in a couple of lines) Let along understand the almost exponential increase<br/>
in cost for a small gain. But now the cost of increasing my skill has<br/>
become absurd.<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to get that rant out in the open. I implore everyone to<br/>
/feedback that the skill checks for Fletching need to be improved.<br/>
<br/>
By the way Vytautas thanks for mentioning my site in your last post!<br/>
