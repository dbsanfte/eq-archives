<div id="ygrps-yiv-255425423">Hi fellow fletchers of Norrath,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just starting out fletching and havin spent some practice points in the skill while leveling I started out at 13, as my first increase brang me to 14. I tried the class A arrow, the ones with all the 1cp parts and raised my skill to 16 where they are now trivial for me to make.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m wondering if any of you keeps track of the differents &quot;trivial&quot; caps related to arrows and bows they make, for me to try them in increasing order.<br/>
<br/>
Although I&#39;m wondering if any combination is a valid one or if only some will work. I guess it&#39;s the later so first, what is needed for class B arrows? (or the arrows or bow you&#39;re currently making).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
Thormael</div>
