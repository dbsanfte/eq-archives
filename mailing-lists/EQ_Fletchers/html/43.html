<div id="ygrps-yiv-1485914134">1) I have no knowledge of Steel or Ceramic Bow Staffs being in-game.<br/>
<br/>
2) Individual components of Arrows say Magic Item. Does anyone know if the<br/>
arrows we make hit magical creatures? I am a Mag so I can&#39;t even use any of<br/>
the Bows I make.<br/>
<br/>
3) Anyone on E&#39;Ci want a Carved 1-Cam Oak Bow. Made it to test Cam stats<br/>
and now I am stuck with it. I&#39;ll cut you a nice deal near cost, I just want<br/>
my 140 plat back!<br/>

&gt;I guess I do have a question.  I have seen listed a steal bow and a ceramic<br/>
&gt;bow... anyone know where to find these or is it a not implemented item(s) so<br/>
&gt;far?  or do you have to start blacksmithing and ceramic skills to make the<br/>
&gt;items?  Also anyone find any magic arrows, so we can hit wisps, and ghouls,<br/>
&gt;etc?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also, I haven&#39;t checked the entire city (again) lately so they could have<br/>
&gt;added the items and I would not know about it.<br/>
