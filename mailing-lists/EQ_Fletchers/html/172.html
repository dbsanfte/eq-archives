<b>Subject:</b> Using tools <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1525415746">All right, I am a newbie in fletching. I have been making arrows to level<br/>
74 as they are cheaper than working Bows.<br/>
<br/>
My question for all you who have gone before me is how do you use tools. I<br/>
have seen the whittling blade and planning tool, but do not know when or<br/>
how to combine them with bows. I have wasted quite a few plat making 100%<br/>
mistakes and losing everything.<br/>
<br/>
Do you use the tool with the raw bow, then combine the result with string<br/>
to make the bow or do you make the bow and then combine with the tool to<br/>
make a finished bow instead of a rough wood bow?<br/>
<br/>
Your help will be greatly appreciated.<br/>
<br/>

For those who have been asking about how to level, I started with all basic<br/>
parts, large nook, wood shaft, regular point and round fletch. When this<br/>
became trivial I upgraded one piece to the next expensive type and<br/>
continued till that became trivial then upgraded another piece.<br/>
<br/>
The nook and fletch upgrade increased the distance value of the arrows I<br/>
made. The shaft and tip increased the damage of the arrows.<br/>
<br/>
The basic parts made a class 1 arrow. By using two medium parts I now make<br/>
class 2 arrows. I am currently using a medium nook, parabolic fletch, bone<br/>
shaft and hooked tip to make class two arrows and at level 74 are still not<br/>
trivial.</div>
