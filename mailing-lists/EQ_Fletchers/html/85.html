<div id="ygrps-yiv-774014135">Yes, yes, there still would be rouges, warriors, paladins, and sk&#39;s, but think about it.  Sure, you use a bow, but REALLY how many others of those classes do you know that use a bow enough to pay that much for a bow?  I&#39;ve sold maybe 20 bows throughout my time, and I can only recall 2 occasions I sold to a non-ranger (I&#39;m sure there&#39;s more I&#39;m not thinking of, but I say maybe 5 at the most), and they were all hickorys.  So, yes, rangers are not 100% of our profits, but they&#39;re enough of it that if we lost their business, we&#39;d lose a lot of money.<br/>

&gt;      I am 100% with you on that one.  People complain about us charging to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>hit<br/>
&quot;combine,&quot; but that&#39;s not what we charge for.  We charge for all the time and<br/>
money that was spent to get us to the point where clicking &quot;combine&quot; does<br/>
anything.  There are also some major economical ramifications of giving away a<br/>
trueshot.  If this bow could be attained very easily, there would be no market<br/>
for ash or oak, as they are inferior bows, yet they would cost way more.  200pp<br/>
is a little steep for Povar (they usually go for around 150-175 with no<br/>
materials provided), but your server may have less master fletchers.<br/>
<br/>
I disagree with one of your statements: there will be no market.  Rangers are<br/>
not the only ones that use bows.  I know many rogues and warriors that use them<br/>
also.  I am in-fact one of those rogues.  For us, while we drool over the<br/>
Trueshot Bow, we can&#39;t use it.  And that leaves plenty of room for profit.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I also think that your solution for your friends (where they give you<br/>
<br/>
extra sets of the items) is the one I will be using for everyone when/if I get<br/>
to that lvl of ability on fleching....<br/>
<br/>
It all comes down to personal preference. (on my tailor character, I made<br/>
patchwork at cost, they give me a pelt and a pattern, I make an item.  All<br/>
because I was below the break even point on PW at that<br/>
time)<br/>
