<div id="ygrps-yiv-1511930503">Questions:<br/>
<br/>
1)  I&#39;ve heard that bow damage was calculated in the following mannor<br/>
<br/>
Bow Damage Rating x Arrow Damage Rating + 1<br/>
<br/>
The only arrows I&#39;ve had access to have been the store bought arrows that have a damage rating of 1, so as far as I can tell this calculation is true?<br/>
<br/>
2)  I&#39;ve never messed with fletching, but I&#39;m assuming the higher quality arrows actually have damage ratings higher than 1??<br/>
<br/>
3)  What is the order of arrows, worst to best?  What are they worth?<br/>
<br/>
4)  I&#39;ve just bought myself a nice bow, the single cam one, don&#39;t exactally remember the name, but the damage is 16 range 100, what is a fair price on it?<br/>
<br/>
5)  Anybody on Veeshan server that wants to sell some better than store bought arrows?  As many as you have to sell, I&#39;ll buy, I&#39;m willing to put in an order for 100 and wait, if need be....<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
