<div id="ygrps-yiv-707540182">Well, the fit has hit the shan, if you&#39;ll pardon the expression.<br/>
With the latest patch, making the Trueshot Bow has become a pain ... and I <br/>
believe it will double or triple the price of the bow:<br/>
<br/>
Micro Servos and Dwarven Wire is now a NO DROP item.  So people can&#39;t come <br/>
to you asking you to make them the bow with their components!  You&#39;ll need <br/>
to have plenty of servos and wire of your own!<br/>
<br/>
I think this is pretty good ... considering the morons on my server are <br/>
selling the TS bow for as little as 50p !  But I&#39;m the clever one ... as i <br/>
think I was one of the first to discover the new NO DROP tags, consequently <br/>
I buy out as many of them as possible (I know it&#39;s a lore item, but I&#39;ve <br/>
spread the bows out over 3 characters).  Sooo ... I hope the price for this <br/>
fine piece of craftsmanship finally goes up to it&#39;s just price of 300p +.<br/>
<br/>
Just wrote to warn you all of the new NO DROP status.  The treant staff is <br/>
still the same ... LORE, but not NO DROP.<br/>
<br/>
Why is it level 11 jerks have the audacity to bitch about the price of the <br/>
TS bow?  You tell them they can&#39;t afford it cuz it&#39;s for high levs ... sigh <br/>
... some people will never grow up.  I can&#39;t wait to see how much more <br/>
bitching is gonna happen whence everyone realizes they can&#39;t have their <br/>
favorite Master Fletcher make em a TS bow for free :)<br/>
