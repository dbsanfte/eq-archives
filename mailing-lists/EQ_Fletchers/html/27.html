I was thinking of. It might me time consuming at first, but worth it in the<br/>
long run.<br/>

Yesterday I increased my skill some more and this time I did keep records.<br/>
I started with a skill of 69 (not in the mid-70&#39;s I though it was).  The<br/>
bone shaft, parabolic fletch, small nock, field point was trivial and the<br/>
next step up was to switch to the claw (?) point (at 76 each), round fletch,<br/>
large nock and wooden shaft.  I made fifty arrows, spending just short of 4p<br/>
for material.<br/>
<br/>
My yield was about 55% and I sold all the arrows back to a vendor in Faydark<br/>
Champions.  The cost, after selling the arrows back, was 2409, and  I raised<br/>
my skill level to 74, so that&#39;s about 5g/skill point.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My marketing efforts went nowhere last night.  I didn&#39;t sell any bows.  I<br/>
did make 100 of the cheapest arrows for a guy for 1p.  The cost of the<br/>
material for those was 4g and the yield is virtually 100%, so you could say<br/>
my marginal<br/>
<br/>
profit was 6g, but I doubt if I&#39;ll do that again.  It was really tedious!<br/>
