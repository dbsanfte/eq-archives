<div id="ygrps-yiv-2139778851">I sell mine to people for 250 pp and most are more than happy to purchase<br/>
them at this price.<br/>
<br/>
The people that I get the most arguement from are the under Level 20 crowd<br/>
who completes the quest and gets the staff and then wants the bow for<br/>
nothing (see one of my earlier posts on how I dealt with one young punk).<br/>
<br/>
I am now &quot;cranking out&quot; Darkwood Bows and selling them at a very good price.<br/>
What prices do you charge for other bows?<br/>
<br/>
My pricing is this way<br/>
<br/>
5pp for Elm (13 75 51)<br/>
25pp for Ash (16 100 58 or 15 100 54)<br/>
175pp for Oak (17 125 48)<br/>
600pp for Darkwood (20 150 46)<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t even bother making anyother bows, and I don&#39;t sell arrows at all to<br/>
the public as the &quot;space to profit&quot; ratio is bad.<br/>
