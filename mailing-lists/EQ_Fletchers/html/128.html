&gt;I presume you mean a mantle, not a tunic? 60 pp for a tunic is a joke &gt;on <br/>
&gt;Eci they go for 250, 200 is cheap, some ppl try to get 4/500 for &gt;them..... <br/>
&gt;If they are going for that little your economy is well and &gt;truly <br/>
&gt;borked.... even more so than ours!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>OOPS! You&#39;re right. Meant the mantle, not the tunic. But I have seen the <br/>
tunic sell as low as 100P and as high as 400P.</div>
