<div id="ygrps-yiv-806221035">Okay, I just signed up for this list a few hours ago, and I haven&#39;t seen one mail yet, so I&#39;ll see if I can start something up (and check if it is actually working).  I&#39;m Slig (level 8 wood elf ranger) on povar.  I was talking with a friend, and we were wondering if anyone has ever made a darkwood bow, and, if so, what are the stats?</div>
