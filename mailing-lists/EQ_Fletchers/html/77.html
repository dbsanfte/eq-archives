<div id="ygrps-yiv-2117028068">I am 100% with you on that one.  People complain about us charging to hit &quot;combine,&quot; but that&#39;s not what we charge for.  We charge for all the time and money that was spent to get us to the point where clicking &quot;combine&quot; does anything.  There are also some major economical ramifications of giving away a trueshot.  If this bow could be attained very easily, there would be no market for ash or oak, as they are inferior bows, yet they would cost way more.  200pp is a little steep for Povar (they usually go for around 150-175 with no materials provided), but your server may have less master fletchers.<br/>

LOL, I think most of us were waiting for someone else to start.  We<br/>
fletchers are generally anti-social anyway :)  We just like to be left alone<br/>
to sort out our arrow parts and quitely make our arrows recording each point<br/>
as it clicks up.....<br/>
<br/>
Oh and was I out of line on this one?<br/>
<br/>
I Got into some arugement last night with some guy who was whining to me<br/>
about me wanting to charge him for the bow.  He said &quot;But I spent 6 hours<br/>
yesterday gathering materials to make this bow, doesn&#39;t that mean anything?&quot;<br/>
I said &quot;Yes it means you must really want this bow.&quot;  He said &quot;SO you&#39;ll<br/>
make it for me for free?&quot;  To which I replied &quot;No, it&#39;s still going to cost<br/>
you 200 pp&quot;  And he said again &quot;Damn, I have spent so much time gathering<br/>
materials and now I still have to pay for it? That sucks, you aren&#39;t a nice<br/>
person, blah blah blah&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Then I laid into him.  I told him, Oh you spent time away from your friends,<br/>
away from adventuring for ONE NIGHT!!  And now you want what is the<br/>
equivalent of the best fletched bow in the game handed to you because of<br/>
that???  I then said, how long do you think it took ME to get to the level<br/>
that I could make a Darkwood Bow?  How many times do you think I had to PAY<br/>
400pp to stick in that kit and hit combine in the hopes that I would get<br/>
what is essentially the same bow you now want for nothing?  I told him, I<br/>
have almost 19 Days of played time on this character, that is less than 1<br/>
level per 24 hours of game time.  So quit your whining and earn that damn<br/>
bow you want so desperately, go learn fletching and get to the level I am<br/>
and you can make all you want then.<br/>
<br/>
To which he replied, &quot;So how much cash did you want again?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think that 200 to 250 pp is too much to ask (unless the customer is<br/>
a good friend, that&#39;s when I ask them to get me some parts for several<br/>
attempts instead of cash)<br/>
