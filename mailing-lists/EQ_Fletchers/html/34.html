<b>Subject:</b> I&#39;m at skill 160 and wasting Plat like crazy <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-713488316">Before the patch my skill was 159. At this skill lvl I was using a (field, <br/>
wooden, ceramic, large) bundle/combination to raise my skill.  After the <br/>
patch I decided to try to raise my skill some more. I wasted close to 40 <br/>
plat after selling the made arrows back to the NPC to raise my lvl to 160. I <br/>
had to buy 30 bundles (costing about 3.5 plat a bundle) to raise my skill <br/>
one point.  Therefore, I am wondering, since everything now costs 5 times as <br/>
much, do we get 5 times the chance to raise our skill with each try?  I <br/>
don&#39;t believe so, since that would have given me 150 tries to raise my lvl 1 <br/>
point.  Am I right? or am I doing something wrong?<br/>
