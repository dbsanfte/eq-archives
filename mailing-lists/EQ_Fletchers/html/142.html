<div id="ygrps-yiv-907569194">Well, glad to see someone else on the same track as me.  Vapn, you are not <br/>
the only one who is giving up on TS bows cuz of the overwhelming amount of <br/>
idiots on the servers.  Povar is not alone, Sol-Ro is equally plagued with <br/>
imbeciles and sophomores who are truly ruining the trade market.  Had I the <br/>
power, I would take each of them to the town square to be flogged ... tarred <br/>
... and feathered!<br/>
<br/>
Fed up as well, Jarron of Sol-Ro.<br/>

&gt;Well hello fellow fletchers.  This is a semi-rant, so please pardon it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have, I think, decided that I am not making anymore Trueshot Bows for<br/>
&gt;anyone.  I am getting tired of the endless parade of idiots in Norrath that<br/>
&gt;think my price of 300pp (gone up since I have to now actually gather the<br/>
&gt;parts, or argue with some newbie in Greater Faydark over the value of the<br/>
&gt;staff, which I would gladly pay 50pp for - more than fair in my opinion for<br/>
&gt;a 5th level character).  The typical conversation goes like this.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Me: /auction Trueshot Bow 20 Dam 100 Rng 45 Del 300pp (Ranger Only)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Idiot: /ooc or /auction or /shout Why are you charging so much for a bow<br/>
&gt;that costs 1pp to make?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Me: /ooc Well first of all it costs around 15pp per attempt, not to make <br/>
&gt;it,<br/>
&gt;so on average I would say it&#39;s closer to 20pp per bow.  Second, would you<br/>
&gt;mind telling me where you get Planing tools for 1pp?  This would save me a<br/>
&gt;great deal of money in the long run.  And thirdly, why do you want to know<br/>
&gt;you are a rogue/warrior/paladin/..... (anything but a ranger normally), and<br/>
&gt;this is a ranger only bow.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Idiot: /auction So why are you charging so much for it?  You suk, you are a<br/>
&gt;greedy bastard, (I have forgotten the list, but you get the idea), it only<br/>
&gt;takes master fletcher to make it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Me: /ooc And I assume that you think I was simply created with this skill <br/>
&gt;at<br/>
&gt;the master level? If not, then you must assume that it cost me nothing to<br/>
&gt;get to this level of fletching?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Idiot: /auction Well it&#39;s pretty cheap to raise the skill, cost a friend of<br/>
&gt;mine only 50pp to get to master.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Me: /ooc Hmmm interesting, cost me a lot more than that to do it.  I am<br/>
&gt;nearing 200 skill and still fail the bow around 40% of time when I try to<br/>
&gt;make it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Idiot: /auction Well I think you suk and are just gouging people for money<br/>
&gt;that you don&#39;t deserve.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Me: /ooc Oh and how exactly is it that the Polished Granite Tommy can sell<br/>
&gt;for 300pp when it cost the person selling it 0pp to make it?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Idiot: /auction Yeah well that&#39;s different cause they are so hard to get <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;you have to camp the place for hours<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Me: /ooc And how exactly is this different from me having to gather the<br/>
&gt;parts, and camp the Arrow Vendor for hours to get my skills up?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;/who idiot<br/>
&gt;No characters match the dsecription in this zone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Other conversations involve people telling me that my 250pp to 200pp price<br/>
&gt;is high just to hit the combine button, I am sure you have all heard them<br/>
&gt;before.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sorry Povar, get someone else to make your trueshots for now, I have had <br/>
&gt;it.<br/>
