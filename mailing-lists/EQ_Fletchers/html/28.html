<b>Subject:</b> Any Fletchers on Veeshan want to make some money.... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-901404306">If you are on Veeshan and a fletcher, listen up, I&#39;ve got some money for you :)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m 30th lvl warrior and I&#39;m currently weilding a Shaped Oakwood Single Cam Bow, but I&#39;m needing a couple things<br/>
<br/>
1)  a better bow, prefereably a 2 cam bow<br/>
2)  a good supply of good arrows.  By good arrows I mean at least damage 2, range 50, I&#39;ll pay much better than the vendors do.  I&#39;ll even buy multiple types of arrows as long as they are in quantities of 20.<br/>
<br/>
I tried to take up fletching with another character, but I just don&#39;t have the time, so I&#39;m willing to pay well for your time.  You can reach me on this list, email me directly at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:coanj@...">coanj@...</a>, or in game between about 7pm and 12 midnight CST.<br/>
