<div id="ygrps-yiv-1385634173">Hi everyone:<br/>
<br/>
   I&#39;ve been battin&#39; this idea around for a few months now, trying to get <br/>
Verant to like it, and thought maybe posting it here would help. Here&#39;s <br/>
what I would like to see:<br/>
<br/>
The ability for fletchers to make specialized magical arrows. By adding a <br/>
simple level 1 or 4 spell, you could make &#39;fire&#39; arrows (with burst of <br/>
flame spell added to the mix), &#39;cold&#39; arrows (shock of frost added), <br/>
&#39;poison arrows&#39; (poison bolt added), &#39;disease&#39; arrows (disease cloud <br/>
added), and pure &#39;magic&#39; arrows, (dunno what to add here, but you get the <br/>
point). Maybe to get the enchantments to hold,. you would HAVE to make <br/>
these arrows magical in the first place (ie make them with the new silver <br/>
tipped arrowheads).  The magical arrows Verant introduced were a good first <br/>
step, but I think more needs to be done to fletching, in general and <br/>
archery in particular. I&#39;ve got a whole bucket full of ideas for Verant on <br/>
that, but that&#39;s another Email</div>
