<div id="ygrps-yiv-1695211307">There are 4 places that I know of to get bow parts<br/>
<br/>
Kelethin, there is a vendor outside on the same platform where Trueshot Bows<br/>
is (way out near the Rogues Guild)<br/>
South Karana, At the Centaur Village (the same guy that gives part of the<br/>
crafted armor quest)<br/>
Surefall Glade, not sure exactly who, but I think it&#39;s in the ranger guild<br/>
area<br/>
Oggok, Somewhere in Feerott near the river, between the bridge and the city<br/>
entrance (I think this right, been a long time since I played my Ogre)<br/>
<br/>
The place in Kithicor mentioned earlier near the High Pass entrance only<br/>
sells arrow parts unless it was changed in the last patch, this is where I<br/>
have been buying my arrow parts now for the past 4 weeks while hunting in<br/>
the Karanas.  But there has been a Ranger guild opened up in Kithicor<br/>
somewhere recently, so it could be possible someone is selling bow parts<br/>
there, but it wasn&#39;t Kyle Arrowsmith last week.<br/>

Alright, I found components to make arrows at the hidden inn between the<br/>
two Orc camps in East Commons.<br/>
<br/>
Now can anyone tell me where to find components to make bows close East<br/>
Commons or Freeport?<br/>
<br/>
So far the only place I have found is in Surefall Glad and I hate to make<br/>
that long trip every time. I know there must be someplace close to Freeport.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for any help you can give a beginner (lvl 74) Fletcher.<br/>
