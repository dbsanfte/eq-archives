This is a semi-rant, so please pardon it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have, I think, decided that I am not making anymore Trueshot Bows for<br/>\n&gt; anyone.  I am getting tired of the endless parade of idiots in Norrath<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; think my price of 300pp (gone up since I have to now actually gather the<br/>\n&gt; parts, or argue with some newbie in Greater Faydark over the value of the<br/>\n&gt; staff, which I would gladly pay 50pp for - more than fair in my opinion<br/>\nfor<br/>\n&gt; a 5th level character).  The typical conversation goes like this.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Me: /auction Trueshot Bow 20 Dam 100 Rng 45 Del 300pp (Ranger Only)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Idiot: /ooc or /auction or /shout Why are you charging so much for a bow<br/>\n&gt; that costs 1pp to make?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Me: /ooc Well first of all it costs around 15pp per attempt, not to make<br/>\nit,<br/>\n&gt; so on average I would say it&#39;s closer to 20pp per bow.  Second, would you<br/>\n&gt; mind telling me where you get Planing tools for 1pp?  This would save me a<br/>\n&gt; great deal of money in the long run.  And thirdly, why do you want to know<br/>\n&gt; you are a rogue/warrior/paladin/..... (anything but a ranger normally),<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; this is a ranger only bow.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Idiot: /auction So why are you charging so much for it?  You suk, you are<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; greedy bastard, (I have forgotten the list, but you get the idea), it only<br/>\n&gt; takes master fletcher to make it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Me: /ooc And I assume that you think I was simply created with this skill<br/>\nat<br/>\n&gt; the master level? If not, then you must assume that it cost me nothing to<br/>\n&gt; get to this level of fletching?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Idiot: /auction Well it&#39;s pretty cheap to raise the skill, cost a friend<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; mine only 50pp to get to master.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Me: /ooc Hmmm interesting, cost me a lot more than that to do it.  I am<br/>\n&gt; nearing 200 skill and still fail the bow around 40% of time when I try to<br/>\n&gt; make it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Idiot: /auction Well I think you suk and are just gouging people for money<br/>\n&gt; that you don&#39;t deserve.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Me: /ooc Oh and how exactly is it that the Polished Granite Tommy can sell<br/>\n&gt; for 300pp when it cost the person selling it 0pp to make it?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Idiot: /auction Yeah well that&#39;s different cause they are so hard to get<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; you have to camp the place for hours<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Me: /ooc And how exactly is this different from me having to gather the<br/>\n&gt; parts, and camp the Arrow Vendor for hours to get my skills up?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; /who idiot<br/>\n&gt; No characters match the dsecription in this zone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Other conversations involve people telling me that my 250pp to 200pp price<br/>\n&gt; is high just to hit the combine button, I am sure you have all heard them<br/>\n&gt; before.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sorry Povar, get someone else to make your trueshots for now, I have had<br/>\nit.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Vapn Maistre, Master of all weapons, Master Fletcher, Povar<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ONElist members are using Shared Files in great ways!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Are you?
