The page is still under work as I am learning more and more each day.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nFor statistics: I put 1 point into fletching initially (yes, you read that right, 1 point) and am now at 70.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nBy now I have almost regular customers and word of mouth is getting me some sales (sold 16 bows so far, 12 hickory and 4 elm). Yet I dont thing I will find many customers for bows above Elm (people REALLY freak over 30pp bows), so smithing may be the financially more effective trade (banded anyone? yawn). And making a living from Hickory and Elm is illusional for higher levels. The few gp or pp you will get are not worth it as a real &#39;trade&#39; skill. It is more or less just for yourself. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nOh well, still I like fletching. I raised my archery skill to 52 using the Tiny Dagger and really like the &#39;xxx got hit by 14 non-melee damage&#39; message. Equals almost two free kicks and is almost as good as a free swing with a mino axe.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nDragan\r<br/>\nXegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
