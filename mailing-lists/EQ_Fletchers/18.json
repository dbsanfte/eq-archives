What are they worth?<br/>\n<br/>\n4)  I&#39;ve just bought myself a nice bow, the single cam one, don&#39;t exactally remember the name, but the damage is 16 range 100, what is a fair price on it?<br/>\n<br/>\n5)  Anybody on Veeshan server that wants to sell some better than store bought arrows?  As many as you have to sell, I&#39;ll buy, I&#39;m willing to put in an order for 100 and wait, if need be....<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nSalr D&#39;Taynkk<br/>\nDark Warrior of The Kith<br/>\nVeeshan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
