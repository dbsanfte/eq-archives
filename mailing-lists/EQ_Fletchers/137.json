So people can&#39;t come <br/>\nto you asking you to make them the bow with their components!  You&#39;ll need <br/>\nto have plenty of servos and wire of your own!<br/>\n<br/>\nI think this is pretty good ... considering the morons on my server are <br/>\nselling the TS bow for as little as 50p !  But I&#39;m the clever one ... as i <br/>\nthink I was one of the first to discover the new NO DROP tags, consequently <br/>\nI buy out as many of them as possible (I know it&#39;s a lore item, but I&#39;ve <br/>\nspread the bows out over 3 characters).  Sooo ... I hope the price for this <br/>\nfine piece of craftsmanship finally goes up to it&#39;s just price of 300p +.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust wrote to warn you all of the new NO DROP status.  The treant staff is <br/>\nstill the same ... LORE, but not NO DROP.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy is it level 11 jerks have the audacity to bitch about the price of the <br/>\nTS bow?  You tell them they can&#39;t afford it cuz it&#39;s for high levs ... sigh <br/>\n... some people will never grow up.  I can&#39;t wait to see how much more <br/>\nbitching is gonna happen whence everyone realizes they can&#39;t have their <br/>\nfavorite Master Fletcher make em a TS bow for free :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJarron of Sol Ro.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
