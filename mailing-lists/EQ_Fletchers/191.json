We","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-592987232\">I recently encountered a player, who was even level with me, and 10pts <br/>\nbetter in archery.  So out of boredom, I challenged him to an archery only <br/>\nduel.  We wailed on each other for a while, each of us getting the nice <br/>\ncritical hits ... but my bow was better, so I was hitting for more average <br/>\ndamage.  However, after several rounds of arrow zinging, we were fairly <br/>\neven.  Want to know why?  Cuz this individual had discovered (so he claimed) <br/>\nthe master archer (NPC of some sort) who taught him a researchable skill (so <br/>\nhe claimed) in &quot;split arrow shots&quot;.  What is that?   HE WAS HITTING ME WITH <br/>\n2 ARROWS IN ONE ROUND !!!  He even managed to execute a TRIPLE shot!  <br/>\nApparently, rangers can now double attack with bows !<br/>\n     After much coaxing and pleading, I was not able to get ANY info out of <br/>\nhim; as he claimed to be sworn to secrecy.  Needless to say, I was vastly <br/>\ndisappointed that another player would not share a secret of archery with <br/>\nhis fellow ranger.<br/>\n     So all I can do is put out this All Points Bulletin.<br/>\n     I don&#39;t know if he is playing a trick on me.  But he seemed genuine <br/>\nenough.  Fellow rangers, we MUST all get this ability.  Can you imagine the <br/>\nsatisfaction of firing a TS or Darkwood bow, hitting critical for <br/>\n(57)damage, then nailing the Mob with a second arrow for an additional 29 <br/>\ndmg ... in the same round?<br/>\n     Let us all unite and find the master... if he exists.  I know we are <br/>\nworking on enchanting the TS bow right now.  But I&#39;m sure one of us will <br/>\ncome across some clue for the &quot;Split Shot&quot; ability in that whole process.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJarron of Sol Ro<br/>\n30th Ranger<br/>\nMaster 182 skill.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
