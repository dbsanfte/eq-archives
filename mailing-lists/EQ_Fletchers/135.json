The thing that thrilled","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-926940944\">LOL.  I am really starting to get fed up with Verant.  When I first started playing EQ, I thought it was the greatest game ever made.  The thing that thrilled me the most was that it wasnt a pure hack-and-slash game.  It had things in it that were even lacking in most of the old pencil and paper games!  It had a wide variety of trade skills that one could participate in if they didnt want to spend all their time going out and killing stuff.  I immediately got into tailoring.  After a while, I got sick of hunting down green wolves for hours, to end up making a few gold selling pw to newbies, and decided to go with something new.  Being a ranger, I took up fletching.  I had found my calling, it seemed.  I clicked until my fingers bled, and finally got my skill up enough to make my first hickory.  It sold almost immediately.  It sent on similar to this for a while.  Making a little cash here and there, bringing my skill up, and taking time out to go adventuring every now and then.  Suddenly, things began to change.  When my skill was at 60 or 70 or so, they put a patch on that made it cost 5 times as much to up my skill.  So, I took up pottery to make money and give myself the edge to try to catch up to the lucky ones who got their skill up around 200 before the patch.  I was still making money selling elm, and eventually ash, as well.  Then the trueshot comes along.  Suddenly, I can&#39;t seem to sell ash anymore.  I do the quest myself, hoping to make up for it with tremendous profits, and I fail 10 times in a row with skill 140.  I think to myself, well, no matter, I&#39;ll do more pottery to get my skill up enough to make one.  One day, I go to buy sketches, and they&#39;ve gone up in price to where profits are now impossible!<br/>\n<br/>\n     Sorry about the length of this rant, but I&#39;ve been pissed.  They say they want a player based economy, but it semms that with every patch comes something to make trade skills harder!  They were hard enough as it was before all of these patches.  Now you&#39;d have to be insane to take all the time away from adventuring and leveling and making money to sit around clicking combine with no hope of ever getting any return on your investment.  Of course, they havent done a thing with Jewelcrafting!  This is what really irks me!  Enchanters are the only ones who can really do this successfully, and they&#39;re making thousands of plat off of it, while us fletchers are struggling to get back half of what we&#39;ve spent!<br/>\n<br/>\n     I&#39;m seriously thinking about quitting the game, and as soon as Asheron&#39;s Call comes out, they&#39;ll have a really hard time keeping me in Norrath.<br/>\n<br/>\nSlig, Povar&#39;s disgruntled Fletcher<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; Dominic Franchetti &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:DFranchetti@...\">DFranchetti@...</a>&gt; 07/29 1:00 PM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>From: Dominic Franchetti &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:DFranchetti@...\">DFranchetti@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is a formula that came to my head as I read this post.<br/>\n<br/>\nEQ + (poorly thought out patches * many patches) + bad support = UO<br/>\n<br/>\nOuch<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Ben Sarsgard (3) [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bens@...\">bens@...</a>] <br/>\nSent: Thursday, July 29, 1999 7:02 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Fletchers@onelist.com\">EQ_Fletchers@onelist.com</a> <br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ_Fletchers] Whats UP!!???<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Ben Sarsgard (3)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bens@...\">bens@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n     There&#39;s lots of great charts for this type of info at the ragers&#39;<br/>\nglade website.

So what does<br/>\neveryone think about the latest patch making micro servos and dwarven<br/>\nwire no drop?  I think it was the wrong approach.  They should have just<br/>\nmade the bow no drop, and left the component gathering open in case some<br/>\nnewbies wanted to make a bit of cash killing rogue clockworks.  I also<br/>\nheard a rumor that the lantern Jyle no longer gives the treant wood, and<br/>\ninstead has been giving fire beetle eyes.
