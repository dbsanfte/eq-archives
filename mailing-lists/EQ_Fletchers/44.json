At this skill lvl I<br/>\nwas using a (field, <br/>\nwooden, ceramic, large) bundle/combination to raise my<br/>\nskill.  After the <br/>\npatch I decided to try to raise my skill some more. I<br/>\nwasted close to 40 <br/>\nplat after selling the made arrows back to the NPC to<br/>\nraise my lvl to 160. I <br/>\nhad to buy 30 bundles (costing about 3.5 plat a<br/>\nbundle) to raise my skill <br/>\none point.  Therefore, I am wondering, since<br/>\neverything now costs 5 times as <br/>\nmuch, do we get 5 times the chance to raise our skill<br/>\nwith each try?  I <br/>\ndon&#39;t believe so, since that would have given me 150<br/>\ntries to raise my lvl 1 <br/>\npoint.  Am I right? or am I doing something wrong?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
