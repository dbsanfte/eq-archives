Okay, <br/>\nI was fletching today ::the crowd gasps:: :).  I was at 185 working <br/>\non ceramic vane arrows and everything was going fine ... until I hit <br/>\n189.  Then my skill increases just STOPPED.  I fletched 3 whole <br/>\nbackpacks of components without a single increase, and the arrows <br/>\nweren&#39;t trivial yet.  So I decided to try the next component up, <br/>\nwhich is steel shafts.  Fletched 2 backpacks of those and still <br/>\nnothing.  I then asked another fletcher what I should do and they <br/>\nsaid try using small nocks, steel shafts, silver tipped points, and <br/>\nceramic vanes.  I did ... bought 2 backpacks worth (ouch), and STILL <br/>\nno increase.  So my question is ... what do I do now?  I&#39;ve now used <br/>\nup 7 backpacks of components without 1 increase ... does it just take <br/>\nthis long to increase your skill at this point ::prays to every god <br/>\nin Norrath that isn&#39;t so::?  Is there something else I should be <br/>\ndoing?  Or am I just having a bad EQ day (very possible there)?  Any <br/>\nsuggestions that would ease the fears of this poor, frustrated wood <br/>\nelf would be greatly appreciated :).<br/>\n<br/>\nTira Misu of Lanys T&#39;vyl</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
