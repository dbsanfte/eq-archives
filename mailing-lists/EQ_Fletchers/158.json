Specifically, when should you<br/>\nmove<br/>\n&gt; to higher components and when is it OK to move to bows?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have a fletching skill of 50 currently.  I am now using wood shafts,<br/>\n&gt; medium nocks, parablolic flights and field points I believe.  When this<br/>\n&gt; becomes trivial, which item should I increase?  When should I start making<br/>\n&gt; bows and when should I advance the wood?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks for any help.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lidin - Level 12 Ranger and Apprentice Fletcher<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bonecrkr@...\">bonecrkr@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bonecrkr@...\">bonecrkr@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, September 30, 1999 1:44 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Fletchers@onelist.com\">EQ_Fletchers@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [EQ_Fletchers] How to develop skill at high levels?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bonecrkr@...\">bonecrkr@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I could use a little advice from any of the GrandMaster Fletchers out<br/>\nthere.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve been working the Fletching skill pretty hard (to quote one of the<br/>\n&gt; guides on fletchin, making arrows until my eyes bleed) and my skill is now<br/>\n&gt; 170.  I&#39;m currently making arrows with Large Nocks, Wood Shafts, Field<br/>\n&gt; Points and ceramic vanes.  Unfortunately, it is now becoming teminally<br/>\n&gt; expensive to level the skill up (at least with the ceramic vanes).  They a<br/>\nre<br/>\n&gt; not trivial but are no longer driving my skill up at an acceptable rate.<br/>\n&gt; Before I flush more pp away, could someone with level 200 skill tell me if<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; should stick with ceramic vanes (if so, until when) or move on to cheap<br/>\n&gt; components with steel shafts (until when) and then cheap components with<br/>\n&gt; blade points.  Also, I&#39;d like some info on making the high end bows.  For<br/>\n&gt; example, is it safe to start working with Oak yet and at what point am I<br/>\n&gt; likely not to cry from a failure with Darkwood? I read somewhere that<br/>\n&gt; planing tools and knives add 20 to t!<br/>\n&gt; !<br/>\n&gt; !<br/>\n&gt; he skill needed to make a bow and that cams are for Oak and Darkwood only.<br/>\n&gt; Do they add to the difficulty of making a bow?  I notice that, since the<br/>\n&gt; patch our fletching kit has more spots.  I take it that we can now make 2<br/>\n&gt; cam bows and plane them etc.  Does this actually work (rather not discover<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; bug by investing good pp, hehe)  What is a good price to charge for the<br/>\nOak<br/>\n&gt; and Ashwood bows or even the trueshot if I get my lazy butt up to do the<br/>\n&gt; quest.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
