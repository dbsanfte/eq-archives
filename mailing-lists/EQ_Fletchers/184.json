The last type you&#39;ll be making are ceramic vane,<br/>\nlarge nock, field point, wood shaft arrows...those will take you to from 162<br/>\nto 200 (max skill). At 200 skill, you can (though they are still not trivial and<br/>\nthere are a few failures) make a profit selling them back to the vendor, if<br/>\nyou&#39;ve scraped together some stat increasing equipment for your charisma.<br/>\nCarrying 120 cha, I can make 8-12pp on a bundle of 40 of each part in<br/>\nSF, where I am popular with the locals due to my many BB gnoll hunts.<br/>\nThis can be somewhat tedious.

Otherwise, it&#39;s simply not cost efficient to use them<br/>\n.<br/>\n        With the present system, bow damage + arrow damage = total damage.<br/>\nA damage 1 arrow costs, say 1sp, and adds 1 damage to your 19 damage bow<br/>\nfor a total of 20 damage max.<br/>\nA damage 2 arrow costs 2sp and adds 2 damage to your 19 damage bow for<br/>\na total of 21 damage max.<br/>\n        For the 2sp I spent on a 2 damage arrow doing 21 max damage, I could<br/>\nhave made two 1 damage arrows with a total damage potential of 40.<br/>\n<br/>\n        And of course, it gets worse the higher you go...spend 8sp on one 4 damage<br/>\narrow with a total potential damage of 23, or 8sp on eight 1 damage arrows with<br/>\na total potential damage of 160?<br/>\n<br/>\n        This of course, discounts crits, but those are not significantly higher to<br/>\nthe<br/>\npoint of justifying the ridiculous cost.<br/>\n<br/>\n        The other sensible change would be to simply adjust the cost of making the<br/>\narrows more in line with their actual value.<br/>\n<br/>\n        If Verant is really interested in making fletching a viable trade,<br/>\n(bowyering is)<br/>\nthey need to make one of these adjustments, and I heartily encourage my fellows<br/>\nto join me in suggesting a change.<br/>\n<br/>\n        The Ranger Glade: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.therg.com\">http://www.therg.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n        Snail Trayls<br/>\n        Master Fletcher<br/>\n        Innoruuk Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
