(Wis)dom and (Int)elligence.<br/>\n<br/>\nIntelligence increases your chances of getting better at any skill (gaining <br/>\na level) for each attempt.<br/>\nWisdom increases your chance of being successful at an attempt for any <br/>\nlevel.<br/>\n<br/>\nBob has 95 INT and 85 WIS<br/>\n<br/>\nGeorge has 85 INT and 95 WIS<br/>\n<br/>\nBob is successful at making [whatever-arrow] with a fletcing skill of 120 <br/>\nabout 2 out of 5 times<br/>\n<br/>\nGeorge is successful at making [same-whatever-arrow] with a fletching skill <br/>\nof 120 about 3 out of 5 times.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere it took George to get his skill to 120 in about 3000 tries (about a <br/>\nweek and a half), it only took Bob to get his skill up to 120 in about 2500 <br/>\ntries (only a week).<br/>\n<br/>\nBOTH Failures and Successes count towards your level.<br/>\n<br/>\n...These numbers are just hypothetical, but you can see how they affect your <br/>\nskills (all skills, not just trade skills)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Cha]risma also plays an important role, mostly to your trade skills though.<br/>\nThe more charisma you have, the higher merchants will pay for YOUR stuff <br/>\n(items and loot) and the less you will have to pay to buy from the merchant.<br/>\nThis combined with your faction standing can really make a difference in how <br/>\nmuch PP you spend on that next batch of arrows.  The likliest place to have <br/>\nthe highest faction is in your home guild, but try around and get the prices <br/>\nfrom other cities and merchants.<br/>\nMe, I&#39;m in Surefall Glade, not far from Queynos and I&#39;ve been noticing that <br/>\nprices for me in Queynos are starting to catch up to those in Surefall, but <br/>\nI always get a good price check first before I sell.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helped ANYONE out there at all...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Kyrros&quot; Ranger of the ninth blessing of Tunare; protector of the fauna of <br/>\nQueynos, the Karanas, and Surefall Glade.<br/>\n(Bristlebane)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
