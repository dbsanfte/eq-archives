The going was definantly slow, but it <br/>\n&gt;did eventually go up.  The only consolance I can offer is that the<br/>\n&gt;ceramic vane arrows actually sell back to the vendor for more than the<br/>\n&gt;cost of the parts.

When I sold back the ceramic vane arrows I <br/>\ngot a profit (sold for like 6gp + per arrow).  However, when I moved to the <br/>\nnext component up, which is steel shafts, the arrows actually sold for less <br/>\n(like 5gp + per arrow) =/.  But you say you did get to 200 with ceramic vane <br/>\nonly?  Well then I&#39;ll switch back to that ... because buying all of the most <br/>\nexpensive components is just soooo expensive to do.  Did it take you 5 <br/>\nbackpacks or so of components to get each level increase from then on?  Or <br/>\nwas it just when you hit 187, and then got easier from then on?  Because I <br/>\nam NOT looking forward to fletching all those arrows =P.  But oh well, gotta <br/>\nkeep reminding myself ... want to make darkwood ... WANT to make darkwood!  <br/>\n=)  But thank you all ever so much for the input ... guess I&#39;ll go back to <br/>\nfletching those arrows now *wimpers*<br/>\n<br/>\nTira Misu of Lanys T&#39;vyl<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
