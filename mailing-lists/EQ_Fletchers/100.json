I mean, if you only charge 100pp for the bow, a lvl10 could get it without too much difficulty, where a lvl 10 should really be weilding elm or ash.  Charging too little for this bow is practically twinking.<br/>\n<br/>\nSlig of Povar<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Murr Rockstroh&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mrockstr@...\">mrockstr@...</a>&gt; 07/21 10:08 AM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>From: &quot;Murr Rockstroh&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mrockstr@...\">mrockstr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI sell mine to people for 250 pp and most are more than happy to purchase<br/>\nthem at this price.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe people that I get the most arguement from are the under Level 20 crowd<br/>\nwho completes the quest and gets the staff and then wants the bow for<br/>\nnothing (see one of my earlier posts on how I dealt with one young punk).<br/>\n<br/>\nI am now &quot;cranking out&quot; Darkwood Bows and selling them at a very good price.<br/>\nWhat prices do you charge for other bows?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy pricing is this way<br/>\n<br/>\n5pp for Elm (13 75 51)<br/>\n25pp for Ash (16 100 58 or 15 100 54)<br/>\n175pp for Oak (17 125 48)<br/>\n600pp for Darkwood (20 150 46)<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t even bother making anyother bows, and I don&#39;t sell arrows at all to<br/>\nthe public as the &quot;space to profit&quot; ratio is bad.<br/>\n<br/>\nVpan (so close to 200 I can taste it) Master Fletcher, Povar<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nONElist:  your connection to people who share your interests.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
