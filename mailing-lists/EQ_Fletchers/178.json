I&#39;ve been selling the basic Rough Oak recurve<br/>\n&gt;bow (hemp string) for 150pp and have sold quite a few.  I sold one<br/>\n&gt;1-cam Oak recurve for 200pp.  Am I charging too little?  Too much?<br/>\n&gt;What would you sell a darkwood for?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, I havn&#39;t been making bows to sell lately but I always used a rule of <br/>\nthumb of pricing the bows to double your cost of materials.  Because there <br/>\nis always a chance of failure, this will cover your expenses incase you <br/>\nscrew up.  Now, if your making trivial bows to sell, you might want to lower <br/>\nyour price.  The only problem that I have with doing that is that you might <br/>\nundercut someone else, that has a lower skill than you, that is using the <br/>\nsame rule of thumb.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also recomend that rule of thumb to people when buying.  If they know the <br/>\napproximate cost on the materials (keeping in mind that people have <br/>\ndifferent charisma), don&#39;t pay more than double the cost of materials.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell.. that&#39;s my 2cp worth...<br/>\nHeh.. can&#39;t even remember my skill lvl &#39;cause I&#39;ve been buying armor, <br/>\nweapons, and jewelery and don&#39;t have the funds at the moment to further my <br/>\ntraining.<br/>\n<br/>\nLincus<br/>\nE&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
