I am not doing this to make<br/>\nlots of cash but to save a little by making my own arrows and enhancing my<br/>\nchar a little for roleplay .. I have spent 5 pracs in fletching so far and<br/>\nintend to spend more when I level .. possibly another 10/15 .. is this a<br/>\ngood idea? What should I be making to improve me skills?<br/>\n<br/>\nAny advice in my eyes is good advice and I really need some .. those damned<br/>\nbooks I bought are no good at all .. I would have been better off buying<br/>\ncomponents :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance<br/>\n<br/>\nAshanak<br/>\nLevel 4 Half Elf Ranger<br/>\nSamsar<br/>\nLevel 11 Barbarian Warrior<br/>\nBristlebane</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
