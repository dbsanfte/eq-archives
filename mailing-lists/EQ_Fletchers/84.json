We charge for all the time and<br/>\nmoney that was spent to get us to the point where clicking &quot;combine&quot; does<br/>\nanything.  There are also some major economical ramifications of giving away a<br/>\ntrueshot.  If this bow could be attained very easily, there would be no market<br/>\nfor ash or oak, as they are inferior bows, yet they would cost way more.  200pp<br/>\nis a little steep for Povar (they usually go for around 150-175 with no<br/>\nmaterials provided), but your server may have less master fletchers.<br/>\n<br/>\nI disagree with one of your statements: there will be no market.  Rangers are<br/>\nnot the only ones that use bows.  I know many rogues and warriors that use them<br/>\nalso.  I am in-fact one of those rogues.  For us, while we drool over the<br/>\nTrueshot Bow, we can&#39;t use it.  And that leaves plenty of room for profit.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, I also think that your solution for your friends (where they give you<br/>\n<br/>\nextra sets of the items) is the one I will be using for everyone when/if I get<br/>\nto that lvl of ability on fleching....<br/>\n<br/>\nIt all comes down to personal preference. (on my tailor character, I made<br/>\npatchwork at cost, they give me a pelt and a pattern, I make an item.
