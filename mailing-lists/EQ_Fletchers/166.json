(its only noticable on the big<br/>\nitems.  Go price out some plate armor).  When I get a Plat Star ruby<br/>\nveil (+9/+9 Cha/Dex) I don&#39;t know if I will see another price<br/>\nlowering....<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW my current kit is:  2 oppalinnes, 2 gold cats eye bracers, silk<br/>\nshirt, thunder medal, leatherfoot cap, stien, brass ring.  Ive got a<br/>\n10slot backpack so they all fit in it.  I vowed that I wouldn&#39;t go<br/>\nover 10 items.  This also includes all the easy to get items, the next<br/>\nones are ones like siren hair hood, and other items that I have never<br/>\nseen at auc, or only for trade in the 1000+p range.  And thats just to<br/>\nsteep for my lvl 25 self.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
