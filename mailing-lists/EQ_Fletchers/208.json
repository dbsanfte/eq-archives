I have an INT of 187 and I get amazing level","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1539906645\">The different factors that I have seen affect skills are INT, Class level,<br/>\nSkill level and item produced.<br/>\n\tI have an INT of 187 and I get amazing level increases in every skill I<br/>\ntry.  My wife also plays and I have given her the benefit of my knowledge,<br/>\nbut she has an INT in the 70&#39;s.  She takes forever to gain skill levels.  We<br/>\nhave both started a skill together (Brewing) and we only Brew together yet I<br/>\nam now in my 30&#39;s while she is still around 12.  \tI have also noticed that<br/>\nthe closer an item is to trivial, the faster you gain skill levels.<br/>\n\tI have also noticed that your class level matters a lot.  If you start a<br/>\nskill when your class level is in its 20&#39;s, then you will gain slower in the<br/>\nlower levels of the skill.  What I mean by this is that a Ranger level 20<br/>\nand a Ranger level 5 that are identical in every other way will gain levels<br/>\nin Fletching at different rates.  The level 20 will gain slower at first<br/>\nthan the level 5.  I assume, but have not had a chance to test this theory,<br/>\nthat it works the other way around for higher level skills.  By that I mean,<br/>\nI think that the level 20 Ranger will gain faster when his skill gets up<br/>\ntoward master than the level 5 would.  I think it was designed for you to<br/>\nskill level slowly with your class level.<br/>\n\tI haven&#39;t had much chance to see what affect WIS has on item failure<br/>\nbecause I have only been interested in gaining skill level and not my<br/>\nfailure rates.  But because INT seems to work as advertised, I will assume<br/>\nWIS does too!<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Murr Rockstroh [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mrockstr@...\">mrockstr@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, October 13, 1999 9:57 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Fletchers@onelist.com\">EQ_Fletchers@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [EQ_Fletchers] Wisdom Does Effect Trade Skills<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Murr Rockstroh&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mrockstr@...\">mrockstr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nhehe ok, was just postulating another theory, but simply because someone<br/>\n&quot;thinks&quot; that it is true, does not make it so.  And like I said, this<br/>\n&quot;theory&quot; of wisdom started way back in Beta, and you should know that if<br/>\nenough people say it, then eventually everybody believes it....  All I know<br/>\nis that I too am doing jewelry, along with Fletching, and I have a 74<br/>\nWisdom.  I have roughly the same failure rate (I was keeping track) as<br/>\nanother jeweler with  wisdom over 100....  So does anyone really know for<br/>\nsure???  I say no, no one other than an employee looking at the code can say<br/>\n&quot;Yes, wisdom does raise the chances of success&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo to say it is FACT is a misstatement, because you can&#39;t know that.  I was<br/>\nmerely posting some curious results I got from a low wisdom, high dexterity<br/>\ncharacter, stating that it seemed odd that I had a pretty good success rate<br/>\nwith a low wisdom and a high strength.  If this helps, I minored in Math in<br/>\nCollege and do understand statistics, so I do know that the 25 to 50 data<br/>\npoints that I have are not that good an idicator, but it was curious is all.<br/>\n<br/>\nVapn, Master Fletcher (3 pts shy of that magical 200), Povar<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:srutkowski@...\">srutkowski@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:srutkowski@...\">srutkowski@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, October 13, 1999 2:52 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Fletchers@onelist.com\">EQ_Fletchers@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [EQ_Fletchers] Wisdom Does Effect Trade Skills<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:srutkowski@...\">srutkowski@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOne major case in fact- EVERY jeweler (master and above) out there has a set<br/>\nof<br/>\nequipment for jeweling- wisdom being the main factor after skill to<br/>\ndetermine<br/>\nfailures, then intelligence to raise skills.<br/>\n<br/>\nI tried this with my cleric- started by brewing, but also on some low level<br/>\njewelry, baking and tailoring stuff.
