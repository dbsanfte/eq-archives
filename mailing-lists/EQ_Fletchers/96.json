I was the lead advocate in charge of the opinion that this bow should cost around 200pp.  Other people were saying that you should have someone bring you the materials and charge 10pp for &quot;clicking combine.&quot;  Now that it&#39;s been around a little while now, they sell for 150-175 on Povar.  I&#39;m not too happy about this, as that leaves no reason to buy an oak.  I basically figure that this bow should be sold at a price relative to other bows in its abilities.  It is better than an Oak bow, certainly (sure, the oak is 25 more range, but the better stats more than balance that out).  So, why should it cost the same as an oak bow?  Well, there&#39;s no cost of materials, you say.  There&#39;s no cost of materials for a piece of rubicite.  Would you expect someone to give that to you for 10pp?  It&#39;s all about the time it took you to get the item.  Fletching is very expensive and time consuming, so if you can make this bow, that means you spent a long time getting your fletching up to a point where it is possible.  This time should be considered equivalent to the time spent camping an item.  I think 200pp is a great price, and if you can get 250 for it, by all means charge it!  This is a magnificent bow which is not particularly easy to get right now, so charge what you can (we need some way to make back all that money we lost getting our fletching up).  You can always lower your prices, but you can never raise them!  Keep this in mind, as if you start selling for 100pp, no one will ever be willing to pay more than that on your server.<br/>\n<br/>\nSlig of Povar<br/>\nDefender of the righteousness of Fletching!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; Cooper, Mark &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:blackhawk@...\">blackhawk@...</a>&gt; 07/21 8:19 AM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:blackhawk@...\">blackhawk@...</a> (Cooper, Mark)<br/>\n<br/>\nWell at lvl 105 i made TS bow.. on third attempt ... but have tried 3 more<br/>\ntimes and falled. so i stand at one out of 6 at lvl 105 ... but i have a big<br/>\nbone to pick..i want to know what is fair price to sell bow at.... i sell to<br/>\nmy guild members at 100pp and 10 servos and 10 kolka nuts... but to non<br/>\nguild members i sell at 250pp ... but now i have anouther fletcher on<br/>\nbristlebane sever selling the bows to public for 100pp .. and harassing me<br/>\nin a very polite way ( he was not rude) to lower my price.. he says this<br/>\nwill stop more peole form becoming fletchers... i fail to see his<br/>\nlogic...but his lvl is 190 and mine is 105 so he can pump them out farter<br/>\nthat i can... but i have 80 pices of each item. so i can compete and my<br/>\nskill is gettting better .. but my charizma is 85 with buffs and his starts<br/>\nat 90 with out ... so this will be a challange.. my question is after all<br/>\nour blood sweat and tears to work our way to master fletchers and haveing no<br/>\nmarket to speak or to sell our wears ...what is a fair price for a bow that<br/>\nis cheap to make for us but has a very limited market ... at 100 pp each i<br/>\nsee this markert being staturated very very quick.. i can see 100p and a<br/>\ngood item in trade or a item worth 200pp in trade ... i&#39;m all for barter ...<br/>\nbut at 100pp per bow in gerneral auction ...seem to me to undermine all of<br/>\nour hard work.  please help what is a fair price for bow in open market<br/>\n<br/>\n thanks<br/>\nkarvar<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Montu Dhillon &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:montu_dhillon@...\">montu_dhillon@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Fletchers@onelist.com\">EQ_Fletchers@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, July 21, 1999 3:05 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ_Fletchers] (no subject)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Montu Dhillon&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:montu_dhillon@...\">montu_dhillon@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ok, you all may think I&#39;m lying, and this is going to cause some<br/>\ncontroversy<br/>\n&gt; ...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ... but with a mere skill of 114 ...<br/>\n&gt; ... on my first attempt at a Trueshot Bow ...<br/>\n&gt; ... when everyone of skill 180 was telling me they succeed only 50% of the<br/>\n&gt; time ...<br/>\n&gt; ...<br/>\n&gt; ...<br/>\n&gt;    ...
