We<br/>\nfletchers are generally anti-social anyway :)  We just like to be left alone<br/>\nto sort out our arrow parts and quitely make our arrows recording each point<br/>\nas it clicks up.....<br/>\n<br/>\nOh and was I out of line on this one?<br/>\n<br/>\nI Got into some arugement last night with some guy who was whining to me<br/>\nabout me wanting to charge him for the bow.  He said &quot;But I spent 6 hours<br/>\nyesterday gathering materials to make this bow, doesn&#39;t that mean anything?&quot;<br/>\nI said &quot;Yes it means you must really want this bow.&quot;  He said &quot;SO you&#39;ll<br/>\nmake it for me for free?&quot;  To which I replied &quot;No, it&#39;s still going to cost<br/>\nyou 200 pp&quot;  And he said again &quot;Damn, I have spent so much time gathering<br/>\nmaterials and now I still have to pay for it? That sucks, you aren&#39;t a nice<br/>\nperson, blah blah blah&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I laid into him.  I told him, Oh you spent time away from your friends,<br/>\naway from adventuring for ONE NIGHT!!  And now you want what is the<br/>\nequivalent of the best fletched bow in the game handed to you because of<br/>\nthat???  I then said, how long do you think it took ME to get to the level<br/>\nthat I could make a Darkwood Bow?  How many times do you think I had to PAY<br/>\n400pp to stick in that kit and hit combine in the hopes that I would get<br/>\nwhat is essentially the same bow you now want for nothing?  I told him, I<br/>\nhave almost 19 Days of played time on this character, that is less than 1<br/>\nlevel per 24 hours of game time.  So quit your whining and earn that damn<br/>\nbow you want so desperately, go learn fletching and get to the level I am<br/>\nand you can make all you want then.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo which he replied, &quot;So how much cash did you want again?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think that 200 to 250 pp is too much to ask (unless the customer is<br/>\na good friend, that&#39;s when I ask them to get me some parts for several<br/>\nattempts instead of cash)<br/>\n<br/>\nVapn, Master Fletcher, Povar</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
