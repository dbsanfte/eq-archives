Okay,<br/>\nI was fletching today ::the crowd gasps:: :).  I was at 185 working<br/>\non ceramic vane arrows and everything was going fine ... until I hit<br/>\n189.  Then my skill increases just STOPPED.  I fletched 3 whole<br/>\nbackpacks of components without a single increase, and the arrows<br/>\nweren&#39;t trivial yet.  So I decided to try the next component up,<br/>\nwhich is steel shafts.  Fletched 2 backpacks of those and still<br/>\nnothing.  I then asked another fletcher what I should do and they<br/>\nsaid try using small nocks, steel shafts, silver tipped points, and<br/>\nceramic vanes.  I did ... bought 2 backpacks worth (ouch), and STILL<br/>\nno increase.  So my question is ... what do I do now?  I&#39;ve now used<br/>\nup 7 backpacks of components without 1 increase ... does it just take<br/>\nthis long to increase your skill at this point ::prays to every god<br/>\nin Norrath that isn&#39;t so::?  Is there something else I should be<br/>\ndoing?  Or am I just having a bad EQ day (very possible there)?  Any<br/>\nsuggestions that would ease the fears of this poor, frustrated wood<br/>\nelf would be greatly appreciated :).<br/>\n<br/>\nTira Misu of Lanys T&#39;vyl<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
