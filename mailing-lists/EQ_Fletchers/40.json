We all need to","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-913640035\">I am a Master Fletcher with a skill of 149. Oak bows are not trivial to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs of the new patch, I spent 8 plat per point of skill gained. We all need<br/>\nto /feedback that each of these &quot;bundles&quot; should be giving us 5x the skill<br/>\nchecks of the before the patch. Or there aren&#39;t going to be a lot of<br/>\nFletchers left. What this patch did was give people who already have a huge<br/>\nlead an unfair advantage.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only reason I got into Fletching was because it was so cheap. I figured<br/>\neventually I would sell a couple of nice Oaks and that would completely pay<br/>\nfor the entire skill. (And upto the patch it had). <br/>\n<br/>\nNow I not only have to deal with the fact that people don&#39;t seem to<br/>\nunderstand the bow. (And there is no /auction in the world that can do that<br/>\nin a couple of lines) Let along understand the almost exponential increase<br/>\nin cost for a small gain. But now the cost of increasing my skill has<br/>\nbecome absurd.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust wanted to get that rant out in the open. I implore everyone to<br/>\n/feedback that the skill checks for Fletching need to be improved.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way Vytautas thanks for mentioning my site in your last post!<br/>\n<br/>\nCharles<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nXezol - Lvl 14 Gnome Mag on E&#39;Ci<br/>\n<br/>\nVisit Amazon.Com for all your Book, CD, and Movie Needs!!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect-home/xezolseverquepag\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect-home/xezolseverquepag</a><br/>\n<br/>\nVisit My EverQuest Page; including zone maps, trade skill guides, general<br/>\nweapons info, and more:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.dubuque.net/~sirkal/EverQuest.htm\">http://www.dubuque.net/~sirkal/EverQuest.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSign-up for my onelist to be kept abreast of changes to my site:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/Xezol_Update\">http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/Xezol_Update</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAllAdvantage - Get paid to surf.
