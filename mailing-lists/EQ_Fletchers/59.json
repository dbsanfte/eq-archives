One would hope they might be able to poison our arrows.  That would rock.<br/>\n<br/>\n     As for arrows being useless for anything but pulling, that&#39;s completely untrue.  One of my favorite things to do is cast grasping roots on a mob and wail away at it with arrow until it wears off.  I can usually get a white mob down to 3/4 life before melee using this method.  If he resists, cast snare on him and start running backwards while firing (just be careful in a dangerous area, I&#39;ve backed into hill giants doing this).  Another great thing to do is if you&#39;re in a group, and you&#39;re almost out of hp, back off and start hitting the thing from a safe distance.<br/>\n<br/>\n     BTW, an archery petition was recently sent to verant.  Check it out, it can be viewed at empty.com/rangers<br/>\n<br/>\nSlig of Povar<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Michael Buck&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lugh@...\">lugh@...</a>&gt; 07/19 1:38 PM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>    If you thought about it there really is no point to a magical bow. The arrow is the thing that actually hits the monster. Now if the bow was a magic bow and it did something such as make it so you never missed your target then that would be a very usful magic bow but other than that I dont beleive that just a plain magic bow has any use, the arrow is the thing that needs to be magic. <br/>\n    <br/>\n    And to answer your second question no I cant make a Trueshot Longbow, but I have seen one person selling them on my server. He said you do have to be a very high level fletcher to make one though. I will see if I can find him again.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thought I had was what if we could have our arrows do something useful other than just pull monsters. What if we could make an arrow that also poisoned the monster, diseased it, or something to that effect. I think thats something we should all look into. <br/>\n<br/>\nAmrosse<br/>\nRallos Zek</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
