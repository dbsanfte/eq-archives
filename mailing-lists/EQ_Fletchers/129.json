The url is <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://empty.com/rangers\">http://empty.com/rangers</a> .  So what does everyone think about the latest patch making micro servos and dwarven wire no drop?  I think it was the wrong approach.  They should have just made the bow no drop, and left the component gathering open in case some newbies wanted to make a bit of cash killing rogue clockworks.  I also heard a rumor that the lantern Jyle no longer gives the treant wood, and instead has been giving fire beetle eyes.
