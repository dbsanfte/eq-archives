You are not likely to cry from a failure<br/>\n&gt; on Darkwood, when you can easily pick up 350pp from your bank account and<br/>\n&gt; click destroy.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Could you expound on this a little?  I have discovered that all Oak bows are<br/>\ntrivial to me (although I haven&#39;t made the 2 cam variety yet).  Is a skill<br/>\nof 170 sufficient to start making Darkwood bows?  At what point do darkwoods<br/>\nbecome trivial if at ever?  What&#39;s the failure rate at 170 vs close to 200.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&gt; What is a good price to charge for the Oak and Ashwood bows or even the<br/>\n&gt; trueshot if I get my lazy butt up to do the quest.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ash I sell for 25pp (No tool versions)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Oak I sell for 150 to 175 depending on the tools, and I don&#39;t sell Cammed<br/>\n&gt; Oak bows (if I did they would be 250).  Trueshot I sell for 300pp, I will<br/>\n&gt; sell it for 200pp if they give me a staff and I don&#39;t fail it.  I<br/>\n&gt; only sell<br/>\n&gt; 2 Darkwoods, both with Planing Tool and Silk, the 1-Cam for 600pp and the<br/>\n&gt; 2-Cam for 750pp..  I have heard, but not tested, that you cannot<br/>\n&gt; double cam<br/>\n&gt; Oak.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been thinking along the same way.  I have sold 4 basic Oak bows (hemp),<br/>\neach for 150pp and one 1 cam made with planing tool and silk for 200pp<br/>\n(should I charge more do you think)?  Is double cam broken for some reason?<br/>\nWhat have you heard?  How much would you sell a basic Darkwood bow for (no<br/>\nplaning or cams)?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
