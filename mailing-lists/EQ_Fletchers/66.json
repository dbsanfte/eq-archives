Just dont want to mess it up having gone to all the darn<br/>\ntrouble of getting the stuff together :)))<br/>\n<br/>\nDagorn of Eci.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou take 1 dwarven wire, 1 spiderling silk, 1 micro servo, and 1 wood chip, and place them in the bag.  You hit combine, and you&#39;ll end up with a &quot;Pack of materials&quot; on your cursor.  You give this to Maesyn, and he will give you the Trueshot staff.  You then put 1 trueshot staff, 1dwarven wire, 1 micro servo, and 1 planing tool in the kit and hit combine.  If you succeed, you get a trueshot bow, if you fail, you get your planing tool back.  So, to make the bow, you need the following:  2 dwarven wire, 1 spiderling silk, 2 micro servos, 1 wood chip, and a planing tool.  I would recommend getting multiples of these (except the planing tool) to make the bow.  I have heard of a 110 making it on the 4th try, and a 112 making it on the 6th, bit I (140) failed 10 times, and I even talked to a 196 who didnt get it until the 4th try.  Good luck!<br/>\n<br/>\nSlig of Povar</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
