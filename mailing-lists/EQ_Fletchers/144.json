Just auction that<br/>\nyou&#39;re<br/>\nselling a trueshot. If someone is interested, ask. Send them a tell, NEVER<br/>\nanswer publicly. If they have a problem, they simply /tell you to jump off a<br/>\ncliff and go about their business. The best part is, they&#39;re not ruining<br/>\nyour<br/>\nsales by spreading their ideas of proper pricing to the zone.Unfortunately,<br/>\nbows<br/>\ndon&#39;t sell well period. I&#39;ve never sold one trueshot at 200pp. I sold ONE<br/>\nShaped<br/>\nDarkwood 1-Cam Bow for 300pp plus a cracked darkwood shield, and I had to<br/>\ngive<br/>\naway 20 class 6 steel bladed arrows to help him make up his mind. Well, if I<br/>\nsell that shield for 300pp (giving me the 600pp for the bow I normally<br/>\ncharge)<br/>\nI&#39;m still making 240pp... (200 skill, haven&#39;t failed a bow yet). Perhaps the<br/>\nreal market is selling Shaped Darkwood 1-Cams (second best for damage to<br/>\ndelay.<br/>\nBest is trueshot, and that&#39;s 50 less range) to level 30+ warriors :) Sold<br/>\nmine<br/>\nto a guy who looked REALLY decked out in armor.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Rennin of E&#39;Ci<br/>\n Trade Council GM</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
