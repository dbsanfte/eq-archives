The arrow is the thing that actually hits the monster. Now if the bow was a magic bow and it did something such as make it so you never missed your target then that would be a very usful magic bow but other than that I dont beleive that just a plain magic bow has any use, the arrow is the thing that needs to be magic. <br/>\n    <br/>\n    And to answer your second question no I cant make a Trueshot Longbow, but I have seen one person selling them on my server. He said you do have to be a very high level fletcher to make one though. I will see if I can find him again.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thought I had was what if we could have our arrows do something useful other than just pull monsters. What if we could make an arrow that also poisoned the monster, diseased it, or something to that effect. I think thats something we should all look into. <br/>\n<br/>\nAmrosse<br/>\nRallos Zek</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
