Thank God I didn&#39;t try to do this with only a skill of 178,<br/>\nnow.  Bladed tips stopped pushing my skill up at an acceptable rate at level<br/>\n175 so I added in small nocks and it took me to 178 fairly quickly and then<br/>\nstopped.  My guess is that I&#39;ll get a few more points if I add in expensive<br/>\nfletching or vanes.  So here is the caveat.  Will anyone actually pay for<br/>\nthe ferrari of bows (2cam + plane+ silk darkwood bow).  I do a small but<br/>\nprofitable business in Oak.  Is there and actual demand for Darkwood among<br/>\nthe high level players?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
