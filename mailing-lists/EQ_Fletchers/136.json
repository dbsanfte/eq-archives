I am really starting to get fed up with Verant.  When I first<br/>\nstarted playing EQ, I thought it was the greatest game ever made.  The<br/>\nthing that thrilled me the most was that it wasnt a pure hack-and-slash<br/>\ngame.  It had things in it that were even lacking in most of the old<br/>\npencil and paper games!  It had a wide variety of trade skills that one<br/>\ncould participate in if they didnt want to spend all their time going<br/>\nout and killing stuff.  I immediately got into tailoring.  After a<br/>\nwhile, I got sick of hunting down green wolves for hours, to end up<br/>\nmaking a few gold selling pw to newbies, and decided to go with<br/>\nsomething new.  Being a ranger, I took up fletching.  I had found my<br/>\ncalling, it seemed.  I clicked until my fingers bled, and finally got my<br/>\nskill up enough to make my first hickory.  It sold almost immediately.<br/>\nIt sent on similar to this for a while.  Making a little cash here and<br/>\nthere, bringing my skill up, and taking time out to go adventuring every<br/>\nnow and then.  Suddenly, things began to change.  When my skill was at<br/>\n60 or 70 or so, they put a patch on that made it cost 5 times as much to<br/>\nup my skill.  So, I took up pottery to make money and give myself the<br/>\nedge to try to catch up to the lucky ones who got their skill up around<br/>\n200 before the patch.  I was still making money selling elm, and<br/>\neventually ash, as well.  Then the trueshot comes along.  Suddenly, I<br/>\ncan&#39;t seem to sell ash anymore.  I do the quest myself, hoping to make<br/>\nup for it with tremendous profits, and I fail 10 times in a row with<br/>\nskill 140.  I think to myself, well, no matter, I&#39;ll do more pottery to<br/>\nget my skill up enough to make one.  One day, I go to buy sketches, and<br/>\nthey&#39;ve gone up in price to where profits are now impossible!<br/>\n<br/>\n     Sorry about the length of this rant, but I&#39;ve been pissed.  They<br/>\nsay they want a player based economy, but it semms that with every patch<br/>\ncomes something to make trade skills harder!  They were hard enough as<br/>\nit was before all of these patches.  Now you&#39;d have to be insane to take<br/>\nall the time away from adventuring and leveling and making money to sit<br/>\naround clicking combine with no hope of ever getting any return on your<br/>\ninvestment.  Of course, they havent done a thing with Jewelcrafting!<br/>\nThis is what really irks me!  Enchanters are the only ones who can<br/>\nreally do this successfully, and they&#39;re making thousands of plat off of<br/>\nit, while us fletchers are struggling to get back half of what we&#39;ve<br/>\nspent!<br/>\n<br/>\n     I&#39;m seriously thinking about quitting the game, and as soon as<br/>\nAsheron&#39;s Call comes out, they&#39;ll have a really hard time keeping me in<br/>\nNorrath.<br/>\n<br/>\nSlig, Povar&#39;s disgruntled Fletcher<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; Dominic Franchetti &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:DFranchetti@...\">DFranchetti@...</a>&gt; 07/29 1:00 PM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>From: Dominic Franchetti &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:DFranchetti@...\">DFranchetti@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is a formula that came to my head as I read this post.<br/>\n<br/>\nEQ + (poorly thought out patches * many patches) + bad support = UO<br/>\n<br/>\nOuch<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Ben Sarsgard (3) [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bens@...\">bens@...</a>] <br/>\nSent: Thursday, July 29, 1999 7:02 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Fletchers@onelist.com\">EQ_Fletchers@onelist.com</a> <br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ_Fletchers] Whats UP!!???<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Ben Sarsgard (3)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bens@...\">bens@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n     There&#39;s lots of great charts for this type of info at the ragers&#39;<br/>\nglade website.

So what does<br/>\neveryone think about the latest patch making micro servos and dwarven<br/>\nwire no drop?  I think it was the wrong approach.  They should have just<br/>\nmade the bow no drop, and left the component gathering open in case some<br/>\nnewbies wanted to make a bit of cash killing rogue clockworks.  I also<br/>\nheard a rumor that the lantern Jyle no longer gives the treant wood, and<br/>\ninstead has been giving fire beetle eyes.
