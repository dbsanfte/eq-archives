I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1244550693\">I am seeing different results from arrows...  This might or might not help.<br/>\nI need to do more testing with some of the 2 through 8 Damage arrows though.<br/>\nI primarily use the 1 Dam 150 Range arrows, and am a L33 Warrior using the<br/>\nCompound Darkwood - 19 Damage one.  I see a maximum currently of 26 points<br/>\nof damage from my arrows, and hit quite often for 23, 24 and 25.  This is<br/>\nthe most that I have ever seen, and while I see it more often the lower the<br/>\n&quot;Con&quot; of the MOB, I do occaisionally see it versus RED&#39;s and YELLOW&#39;s.  I do<br/>\nplan on making up a few hundred 2 Damage Arrows and firing them for an<br/>\nextended period of time to get a maximum on them too..<br/>\n<br/>\nI do agree with you though on the arrow cost far out weighing the damage<br/>\nthat they give.  But at the same time I plan on testing more with higher<br/>\ndamage arrows to see how much more damage they actually do yeild.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will keep you posted on my results.<br/>\n<br/>\nA tip here for you fletcher / archers....  Carry the components to make<br/>\narrows with you to fletch as you go on the road.  The components to make 100<br/>\narrows only take up 4 slots unfletched, and 5 slots fletched.  I normally<br/>\nfill up (2) 8 Slot containers for a good hunt and supply arrows to the<br/>\nothers in my party that use them...  Of course I use my bow as a weapon too<br/>\nso I go through a lot of arrows on a hunt.  When pulling, I normally back up<br/>\nto the ambush sight pumping arrows into it as I go, and can have a couple of<br/>\nhundred points in it as it arrives.  Also if I am not pulling, tell the<br/>\npuller to hit auto-attack as they say &quot;INC&quot; and you can use the /assist<br/>\ncommand to get a target on the MOB, then flip off your auto-attack as it<br/>\nturns on and shoot it as the puller brings it in.  Takes some coordination,<br/>\nbut works pretty well.  Lastly, if you have to back out of combat because<br/>\nyou are hurt, flip off the auto-attack, back off a few feet, and fire into<br/>\nthe melee with arrows.  This works great for any warriors and rogues, and<br/>\nthe hybirds that are low on mana or want to save their mana for later.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you can see, I am not one of those types that would say &quot;I only use it to<br/>\npull&quot; when talking about my bow.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Mark Pribe [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mpribe@...\">mpribe@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, October 05, 1999 11:13 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Fletchers@onelist.com\">EQ_Fletchers@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ_Fletchers] Digest Number 34<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;        Unless Verant does something a bit different about arrows, there&#39;s<br/>\n </span></blockquote>not much sense in making (in my opinion) anything beyond a damage 1 arrow<br/>\nunless someone specifically asks for you better and is willing to pay for it<br/>\n(which happens very rarely).<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;        Now, the sensible thing, it would seem...is to make arrow damage a<br/>\n </span></blockquote>multiplier of bow damage...given that arrow cost basically doubles for each<br/>\nadditional damage point.
