I&#39;ve never heard a good answer to this, but I&#39;ve heard controversy as to whether this actually works.  I know using a magic only bow with regular arrows will not hit a magic only mob (so what the heck is the point of a magic bow?), but I have never heard a good answer as to a non-magic bow with magic arrows, or a magic bow with magic arrows.  Has anyone ever tried this, and, if not, could you try it and post the results?<br/>\n<br/>\n     Another thing, has anyone here successfully made a trueshot longbow yet?  I&#39;m trying to get a good idea of the relative difficulty of this bow, and, if you&#39;ve been able to make it, please post your skill level and the nuber of attempts it took (or even if you&#39;ve tried, but not made it, post how many times you&#39;ve failed).  I&#39;ll start.  I am skill 140, and I&#39;ve failed 10 times, no success.<br/>\n<br/>\nSlif of Povar<br/>\nWood elf Ranger<br/>\nMaster Fletcher, Master Potter<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Paratoos@...\">Paratoos@...</a>&gt; 07/18 4:31 PM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Paratoos@...\">Paratoos@...</a> <br/>\n<br/>\nIn a message dated 7/18/99 1:36:33 PM Eastern Daylight Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tony_fullerton@...\">tony_fullerton@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;  got a arrow of fire off of a npc last night. 4 dmg 100 range. anyone have <br/>\nany idea what an arrow of fire is for ?<br/>\n Mylan Swam - Lvl 22 - Halfling Druid<br/>\n Rahig Swarm - Lvl 22 - Halfling Rogue &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNo...where&#39;d you get it?
