If someone is interested, ask. Send them a tell, NEVER<br/>\nanswer publicly. If they have a problem, they simply /tell you to jump off a<br/>\ncliff and go about their business. The best part is, they&#39;re not ruining your<br/>\nsales by spreading their ideas of proper pricing to the zone.Unfortunately, bows<br/>\ndon&#39;t sell well period. I&#39;ve never sold one trueshot at 200pp. I sold ONE Shaped<br/>\nDarkwood 1-Cam Bow for 300pp plus a cracked darkwood shield, and I had to give<br/>\naway 20 class 6 steel bladed arrows to help him make up his mind. Well, if I<br/>\nsell that shield for 300pp (giving me the 600pp for the bow I normally charge)<br/>\nI&#39;m still making 240pp... (200 skill, haven&#39;t failed a bow yet). Perhaps the<br/>\nreal market is selling Shaped Darkwood 1-Cams (second best for damage to delay.<br/>\nBest is trueshot, and that&#39;s 50 less range) to level 30+ warriors :) Sold mine<br/>\nto a guy who looked REALLY decked out in armor.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Rennin of E&#39;Ci<br/>\n Trade Council GM<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Cooper, Mark&quot; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:blackhawk@...\">blackhawk@...</a> (Cooper, Mark)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; well I feel for you ..

This is a semi-rant, so please pardon it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I have, I think, decided that I am not making anymore Trueshot Bows for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; anyone.  I am getting tired of the endless parade of idiots in Norrath<br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; think my price of 300pp (gone up since I have to now actually gather the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; parts, or argue with some newbie in Greater Faydark over the value of the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; staff, which I would gladly pay 50pp for - more than fair in my opinion<br/>\n&gt; for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a 5th level character).  The typical conversation goes like this.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Me: /auction Trueshot Bow 20 Dam 100 Rng 45 Del 300pp (Ranger Only)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Idiot: /ooc or /auction or /shout Why are you charging so much for a bow<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that costs 1pp to make?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Me: /ooc Well first of all it costs around 15pp per attempt, not to make<br/>\n&gt; it,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; so on average I would say it&#39;s closer to 20pp per bow.  Second, would you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; mind telling me where you get Planing tools for 1pp?  This would save me a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; great deal of money in the long run.  And thirdly, why do you want to know<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you are a rogue/warrior/paladin/..... (anything but a ranger normally),<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; this is a ranger only bow.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Idiot: /auction So why are you charging so much for it?  You suk, you are<br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; greedy bastard, (I have forgotten the list, but you get the idea), it only<br/>\n&gt; &gt; takes master fletcher to make it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Me: /ooc And I assume that you think I was simply created with this skill<br/>\n&gt; at<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the master level? If not, then you must assume that it cost me nothing to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; get to this level of fletching?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Idiot: /auction Well it&#39;s pretty cheap to raise the skill, cost a friend<br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; mine only 50pp to get to master.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Me: /ooc Hmmm interesting, cost me a lot more than that to do it.  I am<br/>\n&gt; &gt; nearing 200 skill and still fail the bow around 40% of time when I try to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; make it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Idiot: /auction Well I think you suk and are just gouging people for money<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that you don&#39;t deserve.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Me: /ooc Oh and how exactly is it that the Polished Granite Tommy can sell<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for 300pp when it cost the person selling it 0pp to make it?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Idiot: /auction Yeah well that&#39;s different cause they are so hard to get<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you have to camp the place for hours<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Me: /ooc And how exactly is this different from me having to gather the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; parts, and camp the Arrow Vendor for hours to get my skills up?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; /who idiot<br/>\n&gt; &gt; No characters match the dsecription in this zone.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Other conversations involve people telling me that my 250pp to 200pp price<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is high just to hit the combine button, I am sure you have all heard them<br/>\n&gt; &gt; before.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sorry Povar, get someone else to make your trueshots for now, I have had<br/>\n&gt; it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Vapn Maistre, Master of all weapons, Master Fletcher, Povar<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ONElist members are using Shared Files in great ways!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Are you?
