I think fletching (now that one success at<br/>\n making arrows equals 5 arrows instead of one) is Da Bomb!

It&#39;s nice to be able to fletch faster, but it&#39;s not <br/>\nworth the 400<br/>\npercent increase in training costs. Past skill 122 it takes around 50 <br/>\nplatinum per<br/>\npoint of skill, which is insane. We&#39;re talking about arrows, things made out <br/>\nof<br/>\nwood.
