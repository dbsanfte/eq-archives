My question for all you who have gone","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1525415746\">All right, I am a newbie in fletching. I have been making arrows to level<br/>\n74 as they are cheaper than working Bows.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy question for all you who have gone before me is how do you use tools. I<br/>\nhave seen the whittling blade and planning tool, but do not know when or<br/>\nhow to combine them with bows. I have wasted quite a few plat making 100%<br/>\nmistakes and losing everything.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you use the tool with the raw bow, then combine the result with string<br/>\nto make the bow or do you make the bow and then combine with the tool to<br/>\nmake a finished bow instead of a rough wood bow?<br/>\n<br/>\nYour help will be greatly appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those who have been asking about how to level, I started with all basic<br/>\nparts, large nook, wood shaft, regular point and round fletch. When this<br/>\nbecame trivial I upgraded one piece to the next expensive type and<br/>\ncontinued till that became trivial then upgraded another piece.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe nook and fletch upgrade increased the distance value of the arrows I<br/>\nmade. The shaft and tip increased the damage of the arrows.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe basic parts made a class 1 arrow. By using two medium parts I now make<br/>\nclass 2 arrows. I am currently using a medium nook, parabolic fletch, bone<br/>\nshaft and hooked tip to make class two arrows and at level 74 are still not<br/>\ntrivial.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
