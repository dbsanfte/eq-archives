I&#39;m level 11 and I MAKE trueshot bows<br/>\n=P<br/>\n<br/>\nlol, just kidding. I&#39;m an exception to the rule, I&#39;ve spent LOTS of time on<br/>\nthis. Been playing since release, still level 11. Got money to show for it<br/>\nthough :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, to the point, I agree. Hear hear, may the price go up!! Let the newbies<br/>\nwhine, they have no idea how much it costs to get a skill to mastery, let alone<br/>\nafter these recent patches. Not to mention how many THOUSANDS of arrows you had<br/>\nto click combine for. Let &#39;em whine, it won&#39;t change the facts or the price :)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Rennin of E&#39;Ci<br/>\n Trade Council GM<br/>\n<br/>\nMontu Dhillon wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Montu Dhillon&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:montu_dhillon@...\">montu_dhillon@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well, the fit has hit the shan, if you&#39;ll pardon the expression.<br/>\n&gt; With the latest patch, making the Trueshot Bow has become a pain ... and I<br/>\n&gt; believe it will double or triple the price of the bow:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Micro Servos and Dwarven Wire is now a NO DROP item.  So people can&#39;t come<br/>\n&gt; to you asking you to make them the bow with their components!  You&#39;ll need<br/>\n&gt; to have plenty of servos and wire of your own!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think this is pretty good ... considering the morons on my server are<br/>\n&gt; selling the TS bow for as little as 50p !  But I&#39;m the clever one ... as i<br/>\n&gt; think I was one of the first to discover the new NO DROP tags, consequently<br/>\n&gt; I buy out as many of them as possible (I know it&#39;s a lore item, but I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; spread the bows out over 3 characters).  Sooo ... I hope the price for this<br/>\n&gt; fine piece of craftsmanship finally goes up to it&#39;s just price of 300p +.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Just wrote to warn you all of the new NO DROP status.  The treant staff is<br/>\n&gt; still the same ... LORE, but not NO DROP.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Why is it level 11 jerks have the audacity to bitch about the price of the<br/>\n&gt; TS bow?  You tell them they can&#39;t afford it cuz it&#39;s for high levs ... sigh<br/>\n&gt; ... some people will never grow up.  I can&#39;t wait to see how much more<br/>\n&gt; bitching is gonna happen whence everyone realizes they can&#39;t have their<br/>\n&gt; favorite Master Fletcher make em a TS bow for free :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Jarron of Sol Ro.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ONElist announces &quot;FRIENDS & FAMILY!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; For details, including our weekly drawing, go to<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html\">http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
