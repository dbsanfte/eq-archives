Think about it... most (or all) of the newly<br/>\n&gt; found flaming Paladin swords are LORE and NO DROP.  The one who finds<br/>\n&gt; (or quests for) it is the one who keeps it, or must destroy it.  Why?<br/>\n&gt; Because otherwise, sooner or later, every guild-twinked lvl 10 Paladin<br/>\n&gt; would be running around with one.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve been rather bitter since they upped the prices of fletching<br/>\n&gt; components by 5x, to &quot;compensate&quot; for allowing us to make arrows in<br/>\n&gt; groups of 5, thus effectively creating a &quot;Grandfather Clause&quot; for all<br/>\n&gt; those who were able to get to 200+ fletching before the patch... those<br/>\n&gt; chars now have an effective monopoly on the creation and sale of<br/>\n&gt; darkwoods for quite a while -- at least on the Rathe, from what I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; seen.  What they should have done, was just allow us to place even<br/>\n&gt; stacks of components into the damn fletching kit, so that WE could<br/>\n&gt; choose whether or not we want to fletch for experience or in bulk...<br/>\n&gt; but I digress.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; **************************<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My point here is that by not making this a NO DROP, the programmers<br/>\n&gt; have given us the tool to destroy our own fletching economy. I&#39;ve seen<br/>\n&gt; people asking &quot;what&#39;s the right price to sell it at?&quot;  Well, this is<br/>\n&gt; how I would answer:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you feel you want to make a business out of it, then what would you<br/>\n&gt; sell a darkwood 1-cam compound bow for?  Take that price, and make it<br/>\n&gt; about 1.5x as much.  Why?  So that Darkwood -- let alone Oak, Ash and<br/>\n&gt; Elm and Hickory don&#39;t become obsolete!  If Trueshots sell for 100pp,<br/>\n&gt; why bother buying a player-made Elm or Ash bow when you can just save<br/>\n&gt; up another 75 or 80pp for a Trueshot?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; For reference, my Lvl. 16 ranger has about 110 or so in fletching, and<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve earned almost everything that I own (except for a combine LS that<br/>\n&gt; technically is on loan from a friend *g*), and I have yet to make a<br/>\n&gt; Trueshot for myself out of 9 attempts.  Maybe it&#39;s my pride that&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; making me write this... perhaps.  But I can and will not allow myself<br/>\n&gt; to stand idly by while other fletchers destroy OUR OWN economy.  I have<br/>\n&gt; to say SOMETHING.  The jewelers are rallying to unite together to raise<br/>\n&gt; their prices back up a bit, to save their economy from a plague of low<br/>\n&gt; prices.  I see it working.  We, as fletchers, have to wake up a bit --<br/>\n&gt; before we sink ourselves with Trueshots.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; More than $0.02, I realize... and my aplogies to all who disagree and<br/>\n&gt; read it all the way through, anyway.  :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Aurazure of the Rathe,<br/>\n&gt; Lvl 16 Wood Elf Ranger<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Congrats to GROW TO GIVE winners, ZENtertainment & ROTInews!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Check out ONElistï¿½s new program, FRIENDS & FAMILY.
