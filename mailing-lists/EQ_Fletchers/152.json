The <br/>\nonelist-paladins are having a field-day -- i&#39;ve never seen a list so <br/>\nchatterish.<br/>\nEn tout cas, let&#39;s discuss some high level fletching, shall we?  I think it <br/>\nwould be great if we all shared what we know of Oak and Darkwood bows to <br/>\nhelp each other.<br/>\nFor instance, at what level do oak bows become trivial (hemp, silk, shaped, <br/>\ncam).<br/>\nWhat about Darkwood?<br/>\nMost especially, what is a safe skill to attempt to make a Darkwood (hemp, <br/>\nshaped, etc.)<br/>\nAt skill 132 i made my first oak-hemp.  I have successfully made 3 for 3 up <br/>\nto my present skill of 171.  It also takes me about 20plat of investment to <br/>\ngo up one skill point.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore topics of discussion:  What is the point of class 4-5-6 arrows? You can <br/>\ncreate same dmg arrows in class 1-2-3; using cheaper components!  They&#39;re <br/>\nmore expensive and aren&#39;t any more accurate.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, that&#39;s my two cents.<br/>\nJarron of Sol-Ro (surnameless)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
