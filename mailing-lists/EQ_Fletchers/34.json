At this skill lvl I was using a (field, <br/>\nwooden, ceramic, large) bundle/combination to raise my skill.  After the <br/>\npatch I decided to try to raise my skill some more. I wasted close to 40 <br/>\nplat after selling the made arrows back to the NPC to raise my lvl to 160. I <br/>\nhad to buy 30 bundles (costing about 3.5 plat a bundle) to raise my skill <br/>\none point.  Therefore, I am wondering, since everything now costs 5 times as <br/>\nmuch, do we get 5 times the chance to raise our skill with each try?  I <br/>\ndon&#39;t believe so, since that would have given me 150 tries to raise my lvl 1 <br/>\npoint.  Am I right? or am I doing something wrong?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
