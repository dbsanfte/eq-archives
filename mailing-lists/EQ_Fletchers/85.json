Sure, you use a bow, but REALLY how many others of those classes do you know that use a bow enough to pay that much for a bow?  I&#39;ve sold maybe 20 bows throughout my time, and I can only recall 2 occasions I sold to a non-ranger (I&#39;m sure there&#39;s more I&#39;m not thinking of, but I say maybe 5 at the most), and they were all hickorys.  So, yes, rangers are not 100% of our profits, but they&#39;re enough of it that if we lost their business, we&#39;d lose a lot of money.<br/>\n<br/>\nSlig of Povar<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:vagabond@...\">vagabond@...</a>&gt; 07/19 3:46 PM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:vagabond@...\">vagabond@...</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Ben Sarsgard (3)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bens@...\">bens@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;      I am 100% with you on that one.  People complain about us charging to<br/>\n </span></blockquote>hit<br/>\n&quot;combine,&quot; but that&#39;s not what we charge for.  We charge for all the time and<br/>\nmoney that was spent to get us to the point where clicking &quot;combine&quot; does<br/>\nanything.  There are also some major economical ramifications of giving away a<br/>\ntrueshot.  If this bow could be attained very easily, there would be no market<br/>\nfor ash or oak, as they are inferior bows, yet they would cost way more.  200pp<br/>\nis a little steep for Povar (they usually go for around 150-175 with no<br/>\nmaterials provided), but your server may have less master fletchers.<br/>\n<br/>\nI disagree with one of your statements: there will be no market.  Rangers are<br/>\nnot the only ones that use bows.  I know many rogues and warriors that use them<br/>\nalso.  I am in-fact one of those rogues.  For us, while we drool over the<br/>\nTrueshot Bow, we can&#39;t use it.  And that leaves plenty of room for profit.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, I also think that your solution for your friends (where they give you<br/>\n<br/>\nextra sets of the items) is the one I will be using for everyone when/if I get<br/>\nto that lvl of ability on fleching....<br/>\n<br/>\nIt all comes down to personal preference. (on my tailor character, I made<br/>\npatchwork at cost, they give me a pelt and a pattern, I make an item.  All<br/>\nbecause I was below the break even point on PW at that<br/>\ntime)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nGet free personalized email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://excite.iname.com\">http://excite.iname.com</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nCongrats to GROW TO GIVE winners, ZENtertainment & ROTInews!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a> <br/>\nCheck out ONElistï¿½s new program, FRIENDS & FAMILY.
