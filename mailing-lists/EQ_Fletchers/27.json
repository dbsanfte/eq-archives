The<br/>\nbone shaft, parabolic fletch, small nock, field point was trivial and the<br/>\nnext step up was to switch to the claw (?) point (at 76 each), round fletch,<br/>\nlarge nock and wooden shaft.  I made fifty arrows, spending just short of 4p<br/>\nfor material.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy yield was about 55% and I sold all the arrows back to a vendor in Faydark<br/>\nChampions.  The cost, after selling the arrows back, was 2409, and  I raised<br/>\nmy skill level to 74, so that&#39;s about 5g/skill point.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy marketing efforts went nowhere last night.  I didn&#39;t sell any bows.  I<br/>\ndid make 100 of the cheapest arrows for a guy for 1p.  The cost of the<br/>\nmaterial for those was 4g and the yield is virtually 100%, so you could say<br/>\nmy marginal<br/>\n<br/>\nprofit was 6g, but I doubt if I&#39;ll do that again.  It was really tedious!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRamalama - 11th Level Ranger Wood-Elf on Mithanial Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nHow has ONElist changed your life?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nShare your story with us at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
