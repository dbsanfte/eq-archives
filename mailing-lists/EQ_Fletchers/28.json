By good arrows I mean at least damage 2, range 50, I&#39;ll pay much better than the vendors do.  I&#39;ll even buy multiple types of arrows as long as they are in quantities of 20.<br/>\n<br/>\nI tried to take up fletching with another character, but I just don&#39;t have the time, so I&#39;m willing to pay well for your time.
