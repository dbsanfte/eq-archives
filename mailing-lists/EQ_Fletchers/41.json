Once I<br/>\ndo find them I will start fletching.  By the way I play a Dark Elf, so I am<br/>\njust about KOS in any good town.  Verant has seen to gone out of the way and<br/>\nnot even given us the supplies needed to start this skill (kind of like the<br/>\nenchant series of spells).  Like what kind of Dark Elf even uses a bow?<br/>\n(answer: shadow knight).  I would love to hit something like 35pts with an<br/>\narrow.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I do have a question.  I have seen listed a steal bow and a ceramic<br/>\nbow... anyone know where to find these or is it a not implemented item(s) so<br/>\nfar?  or do you have to start blacksmithing and ceramic skills to make the<br/>\nitems?  Also anyone find any magic arrows, so we can hit wisps, and ghouls,<br/>\netc?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I haven&#39;t checked the entire city (again) lately so they could have<br/>\nadded the items and I would not know about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Vytautas Dwarf/Paladin &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:vytautasthedwarf@...\">vytautasthedwarf@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Fletchers@onelist.com\">EQ_Fletchers@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, June 15, 1999 10:30 AM<br/>\nSubject: [EQ_Fletchers] are there any master fletcher&#39;s on this board<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Vytautas Dwarf/Paladin &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:vytautasthedwarf@...\">vytautasthedwarf@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI also belong to an EQ brewing and Tailoring board, however, those boards<br/>\nare actually active.  I get at least 10 msgs a day on each of the other<br/>\nboards from people answering questions and sharing expertise.  I have been<br/>\non this board for a week and have only received 2 msgs (which it seems I am<br/>\nthe only one who answered them) and have received no replies regarding my<br/>\nown post a few days ago about fletching past 160.  Are there any Master<br/>\nfletcher on this board and why is everyone so quiet?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
