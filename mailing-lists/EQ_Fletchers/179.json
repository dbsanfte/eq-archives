The catch, you most <br/>\nlikely have to be on an older server (ie. one with more high level players, <br/>\nhigher economy, etc...) or you won&#39;t be able to find anyone who can actually <br/>\nafford a reasonable price.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, on another note, you can actually sell your higher damage arrows to <br/>\nplayers (instead of merchants) while still taking a loss, but not as much of <br/>\none.  &quot;Why will someone buy MY expensive arrows&quot; you may ask?  Well, for <br/>\nthose of us who can hit for critical damage with bows, if you use a higher <br/>\nclass arrow (classes 1-8), for each class of arrow, you get two extra points <br/>\nof dammage when you get a critical hit...<br/>\nexample:  you get a critical hit for 26 [24pt base with a (2 x class 1) <br/>\nbonus] with your oak bow (bow types also play a part in damage, but I don&#39;t <br/>\nknow what yet...probably your base damage) and your class 1 arrow.<br/>\n          If you had been using a class 8 arrow with that same oak bow, your <br/>\nhit would&#39;ve been for 40 [22pt base + (2pts x class 8)]<br/>\n<br/>\nIt can&#39;t be proven numericaly, but people seem to notice that their critical <br/>\nhits come more often when using better arrows.<br/>\n<br/>\nCombine the critical hits with the increased maximum normal hit just for <br/>\nusing the arrows and I think you will begin to see a difference in how <br/>\nuseful that nice archery skill actually is.  If you have trouble convincing <br/>\na potential customer... challenge him/her to an archery &quot;contest&quot; and show <br/>\nthem the numbers in action... Let them use their &#39;old&#39; arrows, then give <br/>\nthem a bundle of your expensive kind... I don&#39;t think you will need to try <br/>\nto convince them after such a powerful demonstration.  On a note, don&#39;t try <br/>\nto actually make money on the sale of these arrows, just take less of a loss <br/>\nthan you would from a merchant (you may even be able to break even, but <br/>\ndon&#39;t get your hopes up.)<br/>\n<br/>\nStill think those expensive arrow are just &quot;skill fodder&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Kyrros&quot; Ranger of the ninth blessing of Tunare; protector of the fauna of <br/>\nQueynos, the Karanas, and Surefall Glade.<br/>\n(Bristlebane)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;  So here is the caveat.  Will anyone actually pay for<br/>\n&gt;the ferrari of bows (2cam + plane+ silk darkwood bow).  I do a small but<br/>\n&gt;profitable business in Oak.
