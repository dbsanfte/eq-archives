I have seen listed a steal bow and a ceramic<br/>\n&gt;bow... anyone know where to find these or is it a not implemented item(s) so<br/>\n&gt;far?  or do you have to start blacksmithing and ceramic skills to make the<br/>\n&gt;items?  Also anyone find any magic arrows, so we can hit wisps, and ghouls,<br/>\n&gt;etc?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Also, I haven&#39;t checked the entire city (again) lately so they could have<br/>\n&gt;added the items and I would not know about it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;David<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Xezol - Lvl 14 Gnome Mag on E&#39;Ci<br/>\n<br/>\nVisit Amazon.Com for all your Book, CD, and Movie Needs!!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect-home/xezolseverquepag\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect-home/xezolseverquepag</a><br/>\n<br/>\nVisit My EverQuest Page; including zone maps, trade skill guides, general<br/>\nweapons info, and more:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.dubuque.net/~sirkal/EverQuest.htm\">http://www.dubuque.net/~sirkal/EverQuest.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSign-up for my onelist to be kept abreast of changes to my site:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/Xezol_Update\">http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/Xezol_Update</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAllAdvantage - Get paid to surf.
