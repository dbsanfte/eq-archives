At skill 170, bows made with Oak, a plane, silk, and 1 cam,<br/>\nare trivial.  I suspect that the 2 cam is also but I haven&#39;t tried it (had a<br/>\ncustomer ask for the 1 cam).  Anyone have any idea when (or IF) darkwood<br/>\nbecomes trivial?  Man, would I laugh hard if I threw a darkwood in with 2<br/>\ncams, some silk and a planing tool and get the trivial message (yeah, I<br/>\nknow, I&#39;m dreaming).  Anyone have any experience with this?  Anyone had any<br/>\nspectacular failures working with Darkwood?  Anyone know how (or if) cams<br/>\nand planing tools increase the level needed to make a bow (or at which it is<br/>\ntrivial)?  How about pricing?  I&#39;ve been selling the basic Rough Oak recurve<br/>\nbow (hemp string) for 150pp and have sold quite a few.  I sold one 1-cam Oak<br/>\nrecurve for 200pp.  Am I charging too little?  Too much?  What would you<br/>\nsell a darkwood for?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
