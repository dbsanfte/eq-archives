I finally got my skill up so elm is trivial, and I am seeing more money than I&#39;ve ever seen in my life.  Sure, 7pp may not seem like a lot to most of you, but to a poor little wood elf in Kelethin, it&#39;s a fortune.  And, even if I never get my skill up to 200, or even 100 for that matter, I&#39;ve still got a pretty decent bow and that patch HAS made it a lot more convenient to make trivial arrows for personal use.  Not to mention the bottom line of why trade skill were put in in the first place, to enhance the role playing experience.  The ONE thing that would just about make me cream if they let us do is be able to name our goods.  Either like in UO, where it would just put your name on it, or to actually be able to give it something creative, instead of &quot;Rough hickory recurve,&quot; or what not.  Not only would it enhance roleplaying, but it would improve the market as well.  For instance, if I wanted a darkwood bow, and I knew someone who had one, I could just find out the name on it and track him down.<br/>\n<br/>\nSlig &quot;I-may-only-have-skill-80-but-I&#39;m-having-a-heck-of-a-lot-of-fun&quot; of Povar<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Jason Coan&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:COANJ@...\">COANJ@...</a>&gt; 06/17 11:05 AM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>From: &quot;Jason Coan&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:COANJ@...\">COANJ@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t have any actual chart or anything that says it....but from my experance, Fletching is still much cheaper to raise than Smithing, which is much cheaper than raising jewlcraft, everybody I know is whining because it now cost more to raise your fletching skill.....start up an enchanter and try raising jewlcraft....then complain about the cost of raising a skill :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Ben Sarsgard (1)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bens@...\">bens@...</a>&gt; 6.17.99 9:48:33 AM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>From: &quot;Ben Sarsgard (1)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bens@...\">bens@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n     Yeah, it does blow, but if you think about it, fletching was highly imbalanced before the patch.  I&#39;ve only ever done tailoring and a little blacksmithing, but I&#39;ve found fletching drastically easier than either.  For tailoring, you need to spend so much time hunting for pelts, then shell out 6 silver for a pattern, just to get one chance.  I tailored on and off for about a week, and only got my skill up to 16, then I took up fletching, and, after 2 nights, i had it up to 65.  It&#39;s clearly more balanced now, but I&#39;m a little pissed that they waited this long to fix it.  They should have recognized it in beta, so there wouldn&#39;t be the aforementioned 200 skill fletchers running around who those of us whom are not yet masters can pretty much never hope to reach.<br/>\n<br/>\nSlig of povar<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; Doug Sorensen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:belgarth_of_surefall@...\">belgarth_of_surefall@...</a>&gt; 06/15 2:16 PM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>From: Doug Sorensen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:belgarth_of_surefall@...\">belgarth_of_surefall@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have been talking about this in the Ranger mailing<br/>\nlist and you don&#39;t get any more chances for your<br/>\nmoney. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou only get a skill check per bunch of 5 arrows. if I<br/>\nrecall the prices for the items went up.

At this skill lvl I<br/>\nwas using a (field, <br/>\nwooden, ceramic, large) bundle/combination to raise my<br/>\nskill.  After the <br/>\npatch I decided to try to raise my skill some more. I<br/>\nwasted close to 40 <br/>\nplat after selling the made arrows back to the NPC to<br/>\nraise my lvl to 160. I <br/>\nhad to buy 30 bundles (costing about 3.5 plat a<br/>\nbundle) to raise my skill <br/>\none point.  Therefore, I am wondering, since<br/>\neverything now costs 5 times as <br/>\nmuch, do we get 5 times the chance to raise our skill<br/>\nwith each try?  I <br/>\ndon&#39;t believe so, since that would have given me 150<br/>\ntries to raise my lvl 1 <br/>\npoint.  Am I right? or am I doing something wrong?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nGet involved.
