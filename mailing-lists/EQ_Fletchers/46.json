I&#39;ve only ever done tailoring and a little blacksmithing, but I&#39;ve found fletching drastically easier than either.  For tailoring, you need to spend so much time hunting for pelts, then shell out 6 silver for a pattern, just to get one chance.  I tailored on and off for about a week, and only got my skill up to 16, then I took up fletching, and, after 2 nights, i had it up to 65.  It&#39;s clearly more balanced now, but I&#39;m a little pissed that they waited this long to fix it.  They should have recognized it in beta, so there wouldn&#39;t be the aforementioned 200 skill fletchers running around who those of us whom are not yet masters can pretty much never hope to reach.<br/>\n<br/>\nSlig of povar<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; Doug Sorensen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:belgarth_of_surefall@...\">belgarth_of_surefall@...</a>&gt; 06/15 2:16 PM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>From: Doug Sorensen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:belgarth_of_surefall@...\">belgarth_of_surefall@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have been talking about this in the Ranger mailing<br/>\nlist and you don&#39;t get any more chances for your<br/>\nmoney. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou only get a skill check per bunch of 5 arrows. if I<br/>\nrecall the prices for the items went up.

At this skill lvl I<br/>\nwas using a (field, <br/>\nwooden, ceramic, large) bundle/combination to raise my<br/>\nskill.  After the <br/>\npatch I decided to try to raise my skill some more. I<br/>\nwasted close to 40 <br/>\nplat after selling the made arrows back to the NPC to<br/>\nraise my lvl to 160. I <br/>\nhad to buy 30 bundles (costing about 3.5 plat a<br/>\nbundle) to raise my skill <br/>\none point.  Therefore, I am wondering, since<br/>\neverything now costs 5 times as <br/>\nmuch, do we get 5 times the chance to raise our skill<br/>\nwith each try?  I <br/>\ndon&#39;t believe so, since that would have given me 150<br/>\ntries to raise my lvl 1 <br/>\npoint.  Am I right? or am I doing something wrong?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nGet involved.
