Last night I took my 350plat and<br/>\nwent into qeynos.  Bought my lvl 29 spells and still had 250pp.  Someone was<br/>\nselling +3int earrings so I bought a pair bringing my INT to 171.  I have a<br/>\n&quot;charisma suit&quot; which brings my charisma to 95.  I would put on the suit<br/>\nbuy/sell parts/arrows then change back to mongo int.  I went from skill 60<br/>\nto skill 124 in fletching last night and only spent 100pp.  I followed the<br/>\nfollowing chart for what to make.<br/>\n<br/>\nMin Arrow To Increase Skill Cost (Based on 75 CHA)<br/>\n\t<br/>\nCost in copper\tCost in copper<br/>\nPoint     Shaft     Fletch/Vane\tNock     Before Patch     \tAfter Patch<br/>\nDif %            Trivial<br/>\nField     Wood    Round             Large             4<br/>\n24 \t\t\t\t1.2                 16<br/>\nField     Wood    Round             Medium         7           \t\t37<br/>\n1.06               32<br/>\nField     Wood    Parabolic        Large             9<br/>\n50         \t\t1.1                 46<br/>\nField     Wood    Round             Small             13<br/>\n69\t       \t       1.06               56<br/>\nField     Bone      Round            Large             22<br/>\n113              \t1.03                68<br/>\nField     Wood    Shield              Large             41<br/>\n246       \t      \t1.2                  80<br/>\nHook    Wood    Round              Large             81<br/>\n389\t\t\t\t0.98              102<br/>\nField     Wood    Wooden           Large             172               \t842<br/>\n0.98              122<br/>\nField     Ceramic Round             Large             290             \t1412<br/>\n0.97              135<br/>\nField     Wood    Bone                Large             342<br/>\n1665\t\t\t0.97              162<br/>\nField     Wood    Ceramic           Large             693             \t3376<br/>\n0.97</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
