All I know<br/>\nis that I too am doing jewelry, along with Fletching, and I have a 74<br/>\nWisdom.  I have roughly the same failure rate (I was keeping track) as<br/>\nanother jeweler with  wisdom over 100....  So does anyone really know for<br/>\nsure???  I say no, no one other than an employee looking at the code can say<br/>\n&quot;Yes, wisdom does raise the chances of success&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo to say it is FACT is a misstatement, because you can&#39;t know that.  I was<br/>\nmerely posting some curious results I got from a low wisdom, high dexterity<br/>\ncharacter, stating that it seemed odd that I had a pretty good success rate<br/>\nwith a low wisdom and a high strength.  If this helps, I minored in Math in<br/>\nCollege and do understand statistics, so I do know that the 25 to 50 data<br/>\npoints that I have are not that good an idicator, but it was curious is all.<br/>\n<br/>\nVapn, Master Fletcher (3 pts shy of that magical 200), Povar<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:srutkowski@...\">srutkowski@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:srutkowski@...\">srutkowski@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, October 13, 1999 2:52 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Fletchers@onelist.com\">EQ_Fletchers@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [EQ_Fletchers] Wisdom Does Effect Trade Skills<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:srutkowski@...\">srutkowski@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOne major case in fact- EVERY jeweler (master and above) out there has a set<br/>\nof<br/>\nequipment for jeweling- wisdom being the main factor after skill to<br/>\ndetermine<br/>\nfailures, then intelligence to raise skills.<br/>\n<br/>\nI tried this with my cleric- started by brewing, but also on some low level<br/>\njewelry, baking and tailoring stuff.
