Here&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; what I would like to see:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The ability for fletchers to make specialized magical arrows. By adding a<br/>\n&gt; simple level 1 or 4 spell, you could make &#39;fire&#39; arrows (with burst of<br/>\n&gt; flame spell added to the mix), &#39;cold&#39; arrows (shock of frost added),<br/>\n&gt; &#39;poison arrows&#39; (poison bolt added), &#39;disease&#39; arrows (disease cloud<br/>\n&gt; added), and pure &#39;magic&#39; arrows, (dunno what to add here, but you get the<br/>\n&gt; point). Maybe to get the enchantments to hold,. you would HAVE to make<br/>\n&gt; these arrows magical in the first place (ie make them with the new silver<br/>\n&gt; tipped arrowheads).  The magical arrows Verant introduced were a<br/>\n&gt; good first<br/>\n&gt; step, but I think more needs to be done to fletching, in general and<br/>\n&gt; archery in particular. I&#39;ve got a whole bucket full of ideas for<br/>\n&gt; Verant on<br/>\n&gt; that, but that&#39;s another Email<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
