The bow is a warrior types ultimate<br/>\ndefense.  When you are rooted, switch to your bow.  You can still do damage at<br/>\nrange and if you time your shots you can disrupt a spell.  They are also useful<br/>\nfor pulling enemies to you and for killing those that are running away.  Also, a<br/>\ngroup with one caster who can root and 5 archers can take  a small breather from<br/>\nnormal combat by switching weapons.  Also good in normal combat where one of your<br/>\nmembers is hurt.  If he backs off, he can use the bow and usually not build up<br/>\ntoo much aggression.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuestion:  I am interesting in learning more about fletching.
