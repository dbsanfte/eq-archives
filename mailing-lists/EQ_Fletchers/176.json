You are not likely to cry from a<br/>\n </span></blockquote>failure<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; on Darkwood, when you can easily pick up 350pp from your bank account and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; click destroy.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;Could you expound on this a little?  I have discovered that all Oak bows<br/>\n </span></blockquote>are<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;trivial to me (although I haven&#39;t made the 2 cam variety yet).  Is a skill<br/>\n&gt;of 170 sufficient to start making Darkwood bows?  At what point do<br/>\n </span></blockquote>darkwoods<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;become trivial if at ever?  What&#39;s the failure rate at 170 vs close to 200.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What I meant was, if you cannot afford to lose the plat to make it, you will<br/>\nmost likely cry from a failure.  I have a few thousand plat in the bank, so<br/>\nfailing one is not that big a financial setback.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&gt; What is a good price to charge for the Oak and Ashwood bows or even the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; trueshot if I get my lazy butt up to do the quest.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Ash I sell for 25pp (No tool versions)<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Oak I sell for 150 to 175 depending on the tools, and I don&#39;t sell Cammed<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Oak bows (if I did they would be 250).  Trueshot I sell for 300pp, I will<br/>\n&gt;&gt; sell it for 200pp if they give me a staff and I don&#39;t fail it.  I<br/>\n&gt;&gt; only sell<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 2 Darkwoods, both with Planing Tool and Silk, the 1-Cam for 600pp and the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 2-Cam for 750pp..  I have heard, but not tested, that you cannot<br/>\n&gt;&gt; double cam<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Oak.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;ve been thinking along the same way.  I have sold 4 basic Oak bows<br/>\n </span></blockquote>(hemp),<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;each for 150pp and one 1 cam made with planing tool and silk for 200pp<br/>\n&gt;(should I charge more do you think)?  Is double cam broken for some reason?<br/>\n&gt;What have you heard?  How much would you sell a basic Darkwood bow for (no<br/>\n&gt;planing or cams)?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think that the Oak 2-Cam is &quot;broken&quot; at all.  I just don&#39;t think<br/>\nthat you can make a Compound (2 Cam) Oak bow.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are the bows I sell<br/>\n<br/>\nAsh, Hemp, 16/100/58 for 25pp<br/>\nAsh, Linen,  15/100/54 for 25pp<br/>\nAsh, Silk,  14/100/50 for 25pp<br/>\nOak, Silk, Planing Tool,  17/125/48  for 150pp to 175pp depending on my mood<br/>\n(I have never sold any other oak)<br/>\nDarkwood, 1-Cam, Planing Tool, Silk, 20/150/46  for 600pp<br/>\nDarkwood, 2-Cam, Planing Tool, Silk, 19/150/41  for 700 to 750pp</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
