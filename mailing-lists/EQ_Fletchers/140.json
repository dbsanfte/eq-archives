This is a semi-rant, so please pardon it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have, I think, decided that I am not making anymore Trueshot Bows for<br/>\nanyone.  I am getting tired of the endless parade of idiots in Norrath that<br/>\nthink my price of 300pp (gone up since I have to now actually gather the<br/>\nparts, or argue with some newbie in Greater Faydark over the value of the<br/>\nstaff, which I would gladly pay 50pp for - more than fair in my opinion for<br/>\na 5th level character).  The typical conversation goes like this.<br/>\n<br/>\nMe: /auction Trueshot Bow 20 Dam 100 Rng 45 Del 300pp (Ranger Only)<br/>\n<br/>\nIdiot: /ooc or /auction or /shout Why are you charging so much for a bow<br/>\nthat costs 1pp to make?<br/>\n<br/>\nMe: /ooc Well first of all it costs around 15pp per attempt, not to make it,<br/>\nso on average I would say it&#39;s closer to 20pp per bow.  Second, would you<br/>\nmind telling me where you get Planing tools for 1pp?  This would save me a<br/>\ngreat deal of money in the long run.  And thirdly, why do you want to know<br/>\nyou are a rogue/warrior/paladin/..... (anything but a ranger normally), and<br/>\nthis is a ranger only bow.<br/>\n<br/>\nIdiot: /auction So why are you charging so much for it?  You suk, you are a<br/>\ngreedy bastard, (I have forgotten the list, but you get the idea), it only<br/>\ntakes master fletcher to make it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMe: /ooc And I assume that you think I was simply created with this skill at<br/>\nthe master level? If not, then you must assume that it cost me nothing to<br/>\nget to this level of fletching?<br/>\n<br/>\nIdiot: /auction Well it&#39;s pretty cheap to raise the skill, cost a friend of<br/>\nmine only 50pp to get to master.<br/>\n<br/>\nMe: /ooc Hmmm interesting, cost me a lot more than that to do it.  I am<br/>\nnearing 200 skill and still fail the bow around 40% of time when I try to<br/>\nmake it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIdiot: /auction Well I think you suk and are just gouging people for money<br/>\nthat you don&#39;t deserve.<br/>\n<br/>\nMe: /ooc Oh and how exactly is it that the Polished Granite Tommy can sell<br/>\nfor 300pp when it cost the person selling it 0pp to make it?<br/>\n<br/>\nIdiot: /auction Yeah well that&#39;s different cause they are so hard to get and<br/>\nyou have to camp the place for hours<br/>\n<br/>\nMe: /ooc And how exactly is this different from me having to gather the<br/>\nparts, and camp the Arrow Vendor for hours to get my skills up?<br/>\n<br/>\n/who idiot<br/>\nNo characters match the dsecription in this zone.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOther conversations involve people telling me that my 250pp to 200pp price<br/>\nis high just to hit the combine button, I am sure you have all heard them<br/>\nbefore.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry Povar, get someone else to make your trueshots for now, I have had it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tVapn Maistre, Master of all weapons, Master Fletcher, Povar</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
