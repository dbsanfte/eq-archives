<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1349949999">What do you think the perfect party would<br/>
contain. I&#39;m interested in getting some discussion going.<br/>
If you could have a party of 6 what kind of<br/>
characters would be in it. I can guess a tank Warrior, and<br/>
artillery Wiz, that&#39;s 2. What other skills would you need?<br/>
A ranger to track? A necro/bard to retrieve bodies?<br/>
A cleric/shaman to buff/heal you? Number them from<br/>
1 to 6 and hell, we may even start forming 6 man<br/>
groups to take on the challenges of<br/>
