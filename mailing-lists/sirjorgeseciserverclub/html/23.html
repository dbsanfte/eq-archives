<div id="ygrps-yiv-1873969299">OOPS! Just as I was headin out to do some actual<br/>
work, I realized I&#39;d made an error! The Chessboard is<br/>
in NorthEAST Butcherblock, not Northwest! To get<br/>
there, follow the road til you reach the zone area to<br/>
Greater Feydark, then turn north. Can&#39;t miss it.&lt;br&gt;<br/>
Also, I have a question as yet unanswered. I looted an<br/>
item off the Undead King at Chessboard. It&#39;s a &#39;Rune<br/>
of Nefagen&#39;. If any of you could tell me what is/is<br/>
used for/worth, I&#39;d really appreciate it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br/>
