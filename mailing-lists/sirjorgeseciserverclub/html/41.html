<div id="ygrps-yiv-239646051">Absolutely true! KS and ffa looting. I must say<br/>
it&#39;s gotten a lot worse in the last few days. Maybe<br/>
(hopefully) it&#39;s just a bad spell, and will return to normal<br/>
soon. The last few times I went Orc side were very<br/>
unproductive due to KS competeing groups. The only civil place<br/>
in the zone is the Aggro npc camp just across from<br/>
the Keep. Spawn is slow, but usually no one is there.<br/>
Loot is bronze and coin, and two high teens can hold<br/>
it indefinitely. Watch out for the Dwarf. He<br/>
backstabs for 78 points.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Foleen</div>
