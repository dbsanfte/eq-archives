<div id="ygrps-yiv-286146616">That is what I found last night as I was going to<br/>
meet some friends there (Smooth & Foleen). Even within<br/>
groups it&#39;s a free for all for the loot (main reason I<br/>
went there) so maybe it was just a bad night for me<br/>
who knows. I will give it another try one when I log<br/>
on again, not sure when I&#39;ll be back. Would of been<br/>
Sunday but it&#39;s my wife and I&#39;s 1 year anniversary :-)</div>
