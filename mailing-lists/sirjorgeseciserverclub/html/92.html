<div id="ygrps-yiv-1894382201">Wish I could of been there, whenever I hit a hell<br/>
level (in lvl 35 now) I usually switch to my lower gyus<br/>
for a while since lvling slows down with my wizzie.<br/>
My other chars are all roaming around the 10th lvl<br/>
(War, Pal, Mag, Dru). Once I get my PC set up at my<br/>
friends house (long story short, we are moving and<br/>
staying with some friends) I&#39;ll be on more. He has cable<br/>
so it will be cool for EQ and my other on-line games<br/>
(Mostly RogueSpear) to have the high speed connection.<br/>
Hope to see you all on-line<br/>
soon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jonquil&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS I have been visiting other EQ clubs that I am a<br/>
member of (and joining a few new ones) and threw our<br/>
club name out there, hopefully we will get more<br/>
members to join and the club will be hoppin again!</div>
