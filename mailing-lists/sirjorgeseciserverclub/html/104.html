<div id="ygrps-yiv-695928751">Sorry to hear that Foleen, I have actually been<br/>
playing like crazy lately, love the new BL class. My BL<br/>
name is Caracas, if ye still have the account active<br/>
and need to unload some gear so that it does not go<br/>
to waste please send me an e-mail. BTW What game are<br/>
you thinking about venturing into next? Do you have<br/>
diablo II? I have it but am a noobie, just got past<br/>
chapter one with all my chars (have 1 for each class) so<br/>
shoot me an e-mail if you play that as well. Take care<br/>
and good luck!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jonquil&lt;br&gt;Lvl 45 Wizzy on<br/>
