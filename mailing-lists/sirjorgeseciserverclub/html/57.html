<div id="ygrps-yiv-1600238335">From the looks of things its going to take quite<br/>
a bit to get this going again. This is the only<br/>
E&#39;ci club though so i dont think we should just let it<br/>
slip away. I added pics i found of most of the epic<br/>
weapons for fun and im going to get some more cool pics<br/>
tonight. I as you quit EQ for about 6 months and am now<br/>
just getting started again but unfortunately i let my<br/>
account slip away so i lost my good characters which is<br/>
ok i kind of wanted a fresh start anyway. I was<br/>
thinking of starting a new group and deleting this one and<br/>
just give it a name that was more recognizable as the<br/>
E&#39;ci club but if we want to keep this one thats fine<br/>
to. I just noticed people stopped posting and using<br/>
this board . It would be a wonderful resource for<br/>
everyone if we could get it up again. Any help from anyone<br/>
would be greatly appreciated. It is my first club so im<br/>
sure ill need alot of help :) Anyway i am as you can<br/>
see long winded so ill stop :) thanks for the post<br/>
hope we can make a come back. Remember to tell all<br/>
your in game friends on E&#39;ci about the club and see<br/>
where we can go with it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eric</div>
