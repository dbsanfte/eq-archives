<div id="ygrps-yiv-980599938">I&#39;m currently bound in Halas, have to go back and<br/>
regain some faction. Trying to save Megan (NPC that<br/>
wanders around everfrost) she started hitting me so she<br/>
had to be put down :-) But I took a huge faction hit,<br/>
guards look at me dubiously so I need to perhaps do some<br/>
quests In halas? I heard about returning some gnoll<br/>
teeth to some warrior chick in Halas.<br/>
