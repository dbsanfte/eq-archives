<div id="ygrps-yiv-1710610676">From Smoothie (Lvl 20 Necro)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;...then using<br/>
Sense Heading to make sure you are going in the right<br/>
direction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If each loc has an x and y value, the coordinates<br/>
will look like this x,y.&lt;br&gt;North and West are<br/>
positive&lt;br&gt;South and East are negative&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; X Y&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; N =<br/>
+&lt;br&gt; NE= + -&lt;br&gt; E = -&lt;br&gt; SE= - -&lt;br&gt; S = -&lt;br&gt; SW= -<br/>
+&lt;br&gt; W = +&lt;br&gt; NW= + +&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;x , y&lt;br&gt;2000,-1200<br/>
from&lt;br&gt;1500, 2100 to&lt;br&gt;SW&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For example, if I were in<br/>
Lesser Faydark and I had just entered for Greater<br/>
Faydark, I would&lt;br&gt; press my /loc hotkey and the number<br/>
would say something like 2000,-1200. If I wanted to&lt;br&gt;<br/>
get to a bandit camp from this location, I would find<br/>
the loc of it from someone (maybe from&lt;br&gt; a friend,<br/>
a webpage like this, or by shouting for the<br/>
location). Let&#39;s just say that I know the&lt;br&gt; location of<br/>
the bandit camp is 1500,2100. If I wanted to go from<br/>
the loc 2000,-1200 to the&lt;br&gt; loc 1500,2100... The x<br/>
value would have to decrease and the y value would have<br/>
to&lt;br&gt; increase. In this case I would have to go<br/>
SouthWest. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh, and Qeynos spelled backwards is<br/>
SonyEQ. HEHE.</div>
