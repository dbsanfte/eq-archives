<b>Subject:</b> Great spot for lvl 16-18 chars <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-60169864">I most recently adventured in Oasis, south of<br/>
Desert of Ro and found that a group of 6 lvl 16 chars<br/>
can make great experience. Our particular team had a<br/>
great balance between casters, tanks, and hybrids but<br/>
this balance may not me required in order to benefit<br/>
from this zone. You must be carefull and sat away from<br/>
Sand Giants (killed me in three shots, lvl 16 wiz) and<br/>
most of all deepwater goblins (1 cast and I was<br/>
toast). Things to hunt while in this group are orc<br/>
warriors and priests, dry bones, mummies, and madmen. We<br/>
were able to handle orcs that were red to us. Great<br/>
exp. If you are in the area send me a<br/>
tell.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jonquil&lt;br&gt;16 lvl wiz</div>
