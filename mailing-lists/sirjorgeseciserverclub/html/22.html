<div id="ygrps-yiv-2018970926">I know it&#39;s been a while scince I posted<br/>
anything. Since every spare moment at home goes either to<br/>
keeping the wife happy, or EQ, there&#39;s been no time club<br/>
chat! ( A man&#39;s gotta keep his priorities straight! )<br/>
Anyhow, as I&#39;m at work, on a weekend night shift, I got<br/>
tons of time to read, reply, inquire and answer.&lt;br&gt; I<br/>
took a trip to Crushbone. Lots of fun to be had in<br/>
there for groups of low to mid teens. The Throne room<br/>
is so busy, I actually get physically tired trying<br/>
to keep up. Crushbone belts, and legionaire pads are<br/>
worth big exp, and loot to a certain Dwarf in the<br/>
warrior guild in Kaladim. He&#39;s the one at the end of the<br/>
hallway to the right after you run through the dining<br/>
hall in the guild. Lots of folks know this, and lots<br/>
don&#39;t, so the ones who do are always trying to beg or<br/>
buy belts and lego pads off the ones who don&#39;t.&lt;br&gt;<br/>
Also, if you&#39;re a level 13, the Chessboard in Northwest<br/>
Butcherblock Mountains is UNREAL EXP!! I tell you no lies! I<br/>
solo&#39;d the place for about 5 hours as a L13 paladin, and<br/>
made it all the way to L14 there. If you&#39;re a melee<br/>
type, and have a casting buddy (or vice-versa) GO<br/>
THERE. You can turn the bone chips in to a Dwarf Paladin<br/>
(Male guy to the left in brown mail)in packs of 4 for<br/>
exp and weapons. Another little known good deal<br/>
there.&lt;br&gt; Work intrudes! (dammit!) more later.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br/>
