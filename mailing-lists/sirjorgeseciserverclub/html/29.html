<div id="ygrps-yiv-2082907628">After my first time in oasis I have always been<br/>
able to get into parties of 6 and this is the best way<br/>
I think. I have not died in a few days now and well<br/>
on my way to 18 (made 17 sunday). But I am open to<br/>
ideas and don&#39;t mind traveling every now and then. You<br/>
know of any other good places for our<br/>
level?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jonquil</div>
