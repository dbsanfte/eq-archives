<div id="ygrps-yiv-2010708964">Foleen, your wife was kind enough to SOW me as I<br/>
was on my way to recover my corpse in LGuk :-) Thank<br/>
her for me! I finally obtained the last of the rods<br/>
for the Staff of the Wheel quest (thanks to<br/>
Smoothie!)and completed the quest. I was disappointed it was a<br/>
no exp quest but the staff was prize enough. I still<br/>
need to go to Guk but I don&#39;t have to do to deadside.<br/>
Need to kill the Monk for the glowing mask (to obtain<br/>
my acumen mask) and need to kill Shinta the froglok<br/>
warrior for a barbarians head that is part of Tishans<br/>
Kilt quest. And of course the priest in unrest has not<br/>
been very cooperative in spawning so I can do the<br/>
mystic cloak quest. All in all tis going good, am 35 now<br/>
so my lvling will slow down since am in hell again.<br/>
I am enjoying EQ again this second time around, I<br/>
hope it stays that way!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jonquil</div>
