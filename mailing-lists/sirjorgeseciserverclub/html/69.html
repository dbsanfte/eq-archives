<div id="ygrps-yiv-1568575059">Yup, I got the itch and I logged back on last<br/>
night. It was cool to see my guild buddies again and I<br/>
hope to spend some quality playing time. Does anyone<br/>
have any equip I can use? My lvl 30 wiz only has a<br/>
stein of moggok, a crude stein and a dragoon dirk!!<br/>
THAT&#39;S IT!! I know Smoothie will help out but I could<br/>
use all the help I can get! My guild buddies gave me<br/>
a green silken drape and a +3int earring, that<br/>
should get me started, see yas online!!!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jonquil<br/>
