<div id="ygrps-yiv-168103107">I had a good weekend. We raided City of Mist on<br/>
Sunday. Some deaths but overall not bad. We then got our<br/>
Seb keys. I took a look at that zone. I will probably<br/>
hunt there for a bit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have some pics from<br/>
COM. I have to get them here.</div>
