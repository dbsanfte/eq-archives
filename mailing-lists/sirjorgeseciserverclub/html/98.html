<div id="ygrps-yiv-1250786109">Too bad we did not have enough, the zone has a<br/>
lot to offer our lvls I think. With a full group we<br/>
could of gone deeper. My Paly could use cold iron armor<br/>
pieces to replace the heavy bronze. Also he&#39;s in need of<br/>
some cool paly weapons so maybe big brother Jonquil<br/>
will have to do some shoppin for him (poor Jonquil has<br/>
to support all his little brothers). I am definetly<br/>
up for trying it again, I&#39;ll let my guild know ahead<br/>
of time as well so we could possibly get a group or<br/>
two there.</div>
