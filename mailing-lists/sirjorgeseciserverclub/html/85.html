<div id="ygrps-yiv-1715003318">I thought for a long time that this E-club had<br/>
been disbanded, but I got an e-mail a few weeks back<br/>
that that was not the case at all! Please allow me to<br/>
reintroduce myself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am Foleen Defraidy, L49 Paladin.<br/>
My current list of character names/levels<br/>
is:&lt;br&gt;Foleen&lt;br&gt;Villiage Iddiot (33 enchanter)&lt;br&gt;Khonhaid Stonehead (24<br/>
warrior)&lt;br&gt;Phathung Leow (21 monk)&lt;br&gt;Revrind (15 cleric)&lt;br&gt;Tiajuana<br/>
(8 necro)&lt;br&gt;Spyvs (5 rogue)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Way back when I<br/>
first signed up here, there were very few members. The<br/>
names I remember are Jonquil, Smoothie, and Zalt. I<br/>
still talk to Smoothie on rare occaisions, but it&#39;s<br/>
been quite some time since I saw Jonquil on line at<br/>
all. I continue to be drawn ever deeper into EQ. I<br/>
even managed to get my wife addicted so I can play<br/>
more!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So where have I been?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Back in January, 2000,<br/>
I joined up with Core Alliance. I have been in that<br/>
guild ever since, and have somehow managed to become<br/>
the guild leader, a position I have held since<br/>
November of last year. We were once one of the most<br/>
powerful on the server, but as so often happens, a guild<br/>
grows too fast, and melts down. Wing of the Phoenix,<br/>
and Wayward Kin were both guilds that were formed by<br/>
splits from Core Alliance. Currently, we are about 30<br/>
members strong with half in the 40&#39;s and half in the 20&#39;s<br/>
and a few in between.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have been distant from<br/>
things like this e-club because when I&#39;m at home I wanna<br/>
PLAY!! I usually did all the extra stuff like message<br/>
boards and guild work when I had down time at work. In<br/>
this new world of downsizing, I&#39;ve had very little<br/>
time at work for &#39;discretionary&#39; occupations. Somehow<br/>
I manage every once in a while. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well,<br/>
that&#39;s about all for now. I&#39;m still out there. Send me a<br/>
tell if you happen to see me on!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Foley</div>
