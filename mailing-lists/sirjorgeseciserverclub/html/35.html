<div id="ygrps-yiv-1688634001">Ya ever find yerself in a bind for places to<br/>
stash all yer stuff? Bank vault&#39;s full of backpacks,<br/>
and ya got no free space left when ya stumble across<br/>
a screamin&#39; good deal on a Shiney Brass Halberd?<br/>
Guess what? While that 16/48 implement of destruction<br/>
will NOT fit into a backpack, it WILL fit into a large<br/>
sewing kit! Not only that, but if you&#39;re traveling, that<br/>
little ol&#39; sewing kit only weighs 0.1 vs the wt of 3 for<br/>
a back pack. Also, a large sack will hold anything<br/>
a back pack does, and only weighs in at 1.0 Do the<br/>
math friends! Large sacks and sewing kits make that<br/>
long haul easy to load up for.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Foleen&lt;br&gt; 18th<br/>
