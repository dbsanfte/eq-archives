<div id="ygrps-yiv-984825713">An even BETTER spot for mid to high teens seems<br/>
to be Highpass Hold. I did all of L17 there (made<br/>
L18 yesterday), and the end for this area is still<br/>
out of sight. I&#39;ve earned nearly 100pp in loot since<br/>
I got here. The South end of the zone is orc land,<br/>
and the spawn rate is incredible. I recommend you<br/>
absolutely DO NOT go to the south end without a full party.<br/>
As an example, I was there with 2 rangers and a<br/>
Necro this morning, all near my 18 level. In one spawn,<br/>
we got a Fanatic, and 3 warriors. I was the only<br/>
survivor, and then only because I ran to two guards, then<br/>
dove into the river. ( the rest of my party was dead<br/>
before I split, of I&#39;d have stayed to fight to the<br/>
bitter end). The north end is Gnoll territory, and this<br/>
is where the PGT and Cracked darkwood shield are<br/>
gotten. A group of four can survive here indefinitely due<br/>
to the slower spawn rate. Another fine aspect of<br/>
HighHold is the scalp quests. I can raise my faction with<br/>
the Freeport Militia (very important to us<br/>
Paladins)with NO bad hits that matter. &lt;br&gt; Seems too good to<br/>
be true? What&#39;s the catch? Getting to HighHold is a<br/>
deadly proposition. Since Plane Of Hate poisoned<br/>
Kithikor, traveling in the wood is very risky. I met a<br/>
zombie trooper there that killed me so fast I never had<br/>
a chance to hit the Lay on Hands I had hot keyed.<br/>
If you can invis, go through the Innothule and<br/>
Ferrot. It&#39;s a LONG, LONG run, but at least you&#39;ll get<br/>
there.&lt;br&gt; Hopefully I&#39;ll see ya online tonight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br/>
