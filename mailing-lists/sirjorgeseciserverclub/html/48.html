<div id="ygrps-yiv-1667502485">Hi again all...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; I am presently running<br/>
around in Crushbone, taking on the occasional<br/>
Legionnaire that happens to walk by, and I began wondering<br/>
how I could make more money while still developing my<br/>
skills. The only problem is where you can make money is<br/>
also mostly crowded, so money is still rare.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Does anyone have an idea where a 14th circle Bard can<br/>
find some good money while still getting halfway<br/>
decent experience? I fought in unrest while I was 13,<br/>
and the loot there is ok, but the trip through<br/>
dagnor&#39;s is a bit unsettling, as well zas the deadly part<br/>
of being in unrest as a 14 circle bard..<br/>
(hehe)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Any ideas other than the Desert?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks in<br/>
advance..&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Telryn Firemane&lt;br&gt;14th circle Songweaver of Erollisi<br/>
