<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1217485338">I am Toradin of the 34 season. I enteredHigh Pass<br/>
at lvl 17, and have been either there or High Pass<br/>
Keep since. These 2 places are great for exp and<br/>
money. Once you get into the Warrior room the Gobs start<br/>
to drop small Bronze and lots of Plat.&lt;br&gt; The only<br/>
drawback is trying to get into groups. The Pass and Keep<br/>
are both quite popular and just about always full; so<br/>
you may have to be put on a waiting list.&lt;br&gt; The<br/>
good news is that you can get bound in the Keep and it<br/>
also has bank and merchants, so you never have to<br/>
leave if you don&#39;t want until about lvl 40.</div>
