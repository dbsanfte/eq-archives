<div id="ygrps-yiv-1375906653">I like the much less threat idea. I&#39;d be at L17<br/>
now if not for the continuous occurrance of DEATH!!<br/>
in the Oasis. ThereIwasThereIwas, typing in a<br/>
message to the rest of my group, I look up, and a<br/>
deepwater gob was closing in on me. RUN!! my group shouts.<br/>
I got SoW on me, so I beat feet. Too late! l&#39;il<br/>
Bas___d zapped me dead with two spells, and I was buffed<br/>
to over 560 hit points. OUCHIE! Third time that<br/>
night, so I called it quits for the day. If you&#39;re ever<br/>
running around the Oasis and you don&#39;t see the gob pets<br/>
running, GO HOME &#39;cause the pets masters are out looking<br/>
for &#39;em (and you)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Foleen&lt;br&gt; permanent 16, it<br/>
seems</div>
