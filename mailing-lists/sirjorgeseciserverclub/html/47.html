<div id="ygrps-yiv-1602135647">Yes that helps a little. Everytime I play him I<br/>
get frustrated, hehehe, can&#39;t take a punch the lil<br/>
wiz. I was getting excellent exp killing giant skels<br/>
in Rathe Mountains, of course I was grouped with a<br/>
lvl 29 necro. I made 23 last night and as I was<br/>
campin someone trained a named cyclops and I lost the<br/>
lvl. I think a group of low 20s would gain great exp<br/>
in this zone hunting giant skels.</div>
