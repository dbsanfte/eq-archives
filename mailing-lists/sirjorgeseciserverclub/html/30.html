<div id="ygrps-yiv-1566084112">Some of my higher level friends keep telling me<br/>
that as a mid to high teen character, I sould try out<br/>
the upper levels of unrest, and/or Highpass.<br/>
Personally, I&#39;m going to push for L17 (bub and a half to go)<br/>
then head for Highpass. There&#39;s an orc scalp quest<br/>
there that raises my faction to Freeport Militia<br/>
without damaging my faction with Knights of Truth. I hang<br/>
out in Freeport a lot, so that will be helpful. I&#39;m<br/>
at 82 skill in Blacksmithing, and need a Master<br/>
rating for some Pally quests.&lt;br&gt; Hey! Add me to your<br/>
friends list, and if we&#39;re on at the same time let&#39;s try<br/>
to hook up. We do seem to spend a lot of time in the<br/>
same areas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Foleen</div>
