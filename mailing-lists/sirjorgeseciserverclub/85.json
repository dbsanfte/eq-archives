Please allow me to<br/>\nreintroduce myself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am Foleen Defraidy, L49 Paladin.<br/>\nMy current list of character names/levels<br/>\nis:&lt;br&gt;Foleen&lt;br&gt;Villiage Iddiot (33 enchanter)&lt;br&gt;Khonhaid Stonehead (24<br/>\nwarrior)&lt;br&gt;Phathung Leow (21 monk)&lt;br&gt;Revrind (15 cleric)&lt;br&gt;Tiajuana<br/>\n(8 necro)&lt;br&gt;Spyvs (5 rogue)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Way back when I<br/>\nfirst signed up here, there were very few members. The<br/>\nnames I remember are Jonquil, Smoothie, and Zalt. I<br/>\nstill talk to Smoothie on rare occaisions, but it&#39;s<br/>\nbeen quite some time since I saw Jonquil on line at<br/>\nall. I continue to be drawn ever deeper into EQ. I<br/>\neven managed to get my wife addicted so I can play<br/>\nmore!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So where have I been?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Back in January, 2000,<br/>\nI joined up with Core Alliance. I have been in that<br/>\nguild ever since, and have somehow managed to become<br/>\nthe guild leader, a position I have held since<br/>\nNovember of last year. We were once one of the most<br/>\npowerful on the server, but as so often happens, a guild<br/>\ngrows too fast, and melts down. Wing of the Phoenix,<br/>\nand Wayward Kin were both guilds that were formed by<br/>\nsplits from Core Alliance. Currently, we are about 30<br/>\nmembers strong with half in the 40&#39;s and half in the 20&#39;s<br/>\nand a few in between.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have been distant from<br/>\nthings like this e-club because when I&#39;m at home I wanna<br/>\nPLAY!! I usually did all the extra stuff like message<br/>\nboards and guild work when I had down time at work. In<br/>\nthis new world of downsizing, I&#39;ve had very little<br/>\ntime at work for &#39;discretionary&#39; occupations. Somehow<br/>\nI manage every once in a while. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well,<br/>\nthat&#39;s about all for now. I&#39;m still out there. Send me a<br/>\ntell if you happen to see me on!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Foley</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
