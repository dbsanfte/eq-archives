Since every spare moment at home goes either to<br/>\nkeeping the wife happy, or EQ, there&#39;s been no time club<br/>\nchat! ( A man&#39;s gotta keep his priorities straight! )<br/>\nAnyhow, as I&#39;m at work, on a weekend night shift, I got<br/>\ntons of time to read, reply, inquire and answer.&lt;br&gt; I<br/>\ntook a trip to Crushbone. Lots of fun to be had in<br/>\nthere for groups of low to mid teens. The Throne room<br/>\nis so busy, I actually get physically tired trying<br/>\nto keep up. Crushbone belts, and legionaire pads are<br/>\nworth big exp, and loot to a certain Dwarf in the<br/>\nwarrior guild in Kaladim. He&#39;s the one at the end of the<br/>\nhallway to the right after you run through the dining<br/>\nhall in the guild. Lots of folks know this, and lots<br/>\ndon&#39;t, so the ones who do are always trying to beg or<br/>\nbuy belts and lego pads off the ones who don&#39;t.&lt;br&gt;<br/>\nAlso, if you&#39;re a level 13, the Chessboard in Northwest<br/>\nButcherblock Mountains is UNREAL EXP!! I tell you no lies! I<br/>\nsolo&#39;d the place for about 5 hours as a L13 paladin, and<br/>\nmade it all the way to L14 there. If you&#39;re a melee<br/>\ntype, and have a casting buddy (or vice-versa) GO<br/>\nTHERE. You can turn the bone chips in to a Dwarf Paladin<br/>\n(Male guy to the left in brown mail)in packs of 4 for<br/>\nexp and weapons. Another little known good deal<br/>\nthere.&lt;br&gt; Work intrudes! (dammit!) more later.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br/>\nDudeUg&lt;br&gt; Foleen&lt;br&gt; L14 Paladin&lt;br&gt; Currently in East<br/>\nCommons</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
