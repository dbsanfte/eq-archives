I finally obtained the last of the rods<br/>\nfor the Staff of the Wheel quest (thanks to<br/>\nSmoothie!)and completed the quest. I was disappointed it was a<br/>\nno exp quest but the staff was prize enough. I still<br/>\nneed to go to Guk but I don&#39;t have to do to deadside.<br/>\nNeed to kill the Monk for the glowing mask (to obtain<br/>\nmy acumen mask) and need to kill Shinta the froglok<br/>\nwarrior for a barbarians head that is part of Tishans<br/>\nKilt quest. And of course the priest in unrest has not<br/>\nbeen very cooperative in spawning so I can do the<br/>\nmystic cloak quest. All in all tis going good, am 35 now<br/>\nso my lvling will slow down since am in hell again.<br/>\nI am enjoying EQ again this second time around, I<br/>\nhope it stays that way!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jonquil</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
