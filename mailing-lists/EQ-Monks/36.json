","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1019399769\">I got my netted armor (& gloves) from a nice dark elf enchantress for 2 plat <br/>\nbecause &quot;she had no use for them&quot;.  Ya just gotta shop around!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I have to agree with this .. Monks really do have the p*** taken out of <br/>\n&gt;them<br/>\n&gt;because everyone knows they need netted armour and upwards, but I have to<br/>\n&gt;say that I am yet to meet a fellow monk that shares the same thoughts. I<br/>\n&gt;managed to get myself a full set of netted from a troll for 4pp al that was<br/>\n&gt;missing was the gloves .. which I expected to pay up to 2pp for, even <br/>\n&gt;though<br/>\n&gt;I begrudge paying it .. Imagine my supprise when I auctioned for a pair and<br/>\n&gt;a fellow monk offered me some for &quot;Oh the least I will take is 10pp&quot; .. <br/>\n&gt;this<br/>\n&gt;was on Erollisi Marr server<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Perhaps an all monk guild would address this problem?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Masafumi<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
