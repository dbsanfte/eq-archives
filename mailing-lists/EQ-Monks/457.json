A friend of mine (who has been heavily<br/>\ninto martial arts (karate and aikido) since he was 12 (I thnk) punches damn<br/>\nhard and damn fast.  He was back from Seattle (he&#39;s studying under an aikido<br/>\nmaster (one of the students of the founder of the art) recently and was<br/>\nteaching some classes and giving some demonstrations.  I used to think<br/>\nboxers could throw punches fast.  You couldn&#39;t count the punches, and<br/>\nsometimes the only way you knew he threw one was the &lt;wham&gt; coming from the<br/>\nthe target an assistant was holding.  Speed is vital to getting your punches<br/>\nto connect.  If they&#39;re slow, they are REALLY easy to block or dodge, since<br/>\nit&#39;s easy to figure out the person&#39;s reach.  They also do more damage the<br/>\nfaster the fist is travelling.  Good old momentum and inertia. To be<br/>\nrealistic.. monks would have a LOT quicker punches but still do the same<br/>\ndamage.  I&#39;d guess a delay around 22 or so, comparing it to other weapons<br/>\n(magic mostly) in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, that will never happen as we&#39;d become the ubermelee class.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Well, if you really think about it, it is possiblef or someone to poke a<br/>\n </span></blockquote>lot<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; faster then a person can punch.  If you consider since monks have to put<br/>\n&gt; some strength into the punch, their speed can&#39;t be too fast.  But on the<br/>\n&gt; other hand, warrior types can upgrade their weapons, in both damage and<br/>\n&gt; speed, monks only get upgrades in damage, i&#39;d like to see us get a speed<br/>\n&gt; upgrade too.  Because if a person wields a pain bringer and a ykesha, they<br/>\n&gt; will easily outdamage a monk, because both of the weapons are sub 30<br/>\n </span></blockquote>delay,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; pain bringer is closer to 20.  Nonetheless, monks are supposed to be the<br/>\n&gt; ultimate melee dishers, that makes up for the extreme hp loss. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
