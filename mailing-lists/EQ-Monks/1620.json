I just had to say though that when my STR is buffed up I notice a dramatic increase in the number of times I hit and the amount of damage I do. This is not strict scientific data not checked or anything but I do know that all my highs I have ever jotted down with flying kick and weapons attacks are all from when being buffed. If this is a coincidence then so be it. I do know that the 110 hps more I get from wearing Plat FO rings as opposed to any of the better STR rings does not mean a whole lot to me. If one of the mobs in Seb decides it really wants to rip into me with my HPs I am a lost cause anyways. <br/>\n     <br/>\n     AC is the top dog but beyond that choose what you want. Whatever makes you happiest. I personally like AC/STR/MR. I just feel that even if it boosts my chances to hit by one percent when I am wielding low delay low damage weapons the more often I hit the more often I do my job which is dealing damage. Lord knows Monks do not have the HPs to be a meat wall.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIbnalnoor<br/>\n53rd lvl Monk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
