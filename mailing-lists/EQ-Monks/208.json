I give in.  But for me, it&#39;s a monk thing.<br/>\n\tAnyway, I&#39;ve just visited the monk&#39;s guild in Freeport to <br/>\nfind out how to get the purple sash and found that this quest is not <br/>\nyet implemented.  Unfortunately, I forgot to investigate the blue <br/>\nheadband quest when last I was in Qeynos.  Does this quest exist yet? <br/>\nEither way, is it known when any of these unimplemented quests might <br/>\nbe added to the game?<br/>\n\tAlso, a bit of a question here for ya: After having worn a <br/>\nBlackened Iron Crown for the last few levels, I&#39;ve decided to dump <br/>\nit.  The stat boosters are phenominal, but it was killing me in terms <br/>\nof weight.  I have a rather good collection of extremely low-weight <br/>\nand weight-reducing items and was STILL bordering on 18lbs in &#39;going <br/>\nout to party&#39; configuration.  Obviously, this was not acceptable.  I <br/>\nreplaced the BIC with the aforementioned Purple Headband, which is <br/>\nrather inferior, but moving from a 6Wt item to a 0Wt item has lifted <br/>\na great burden from my shoulders (literally).  I figure it&#39;ll do <br/>\nuntil I can get an executioner&#39;s hood.<br/>\n\tMy question is this: as far as headgear goes, am I missing <br/>\nsomething?  There only seems to be 2 more items that are worth <br/>\nconsidering, those being the Crown of the Froglok Kings and the Crown <br/>\nof King Tranix.  Is there something else out there that would be <br/>\nworth hunting after (besides the shiverback stuff, of course... but <br/>\nthat&#39;s WAY off)?<br/>\n-- <br/>\nAaron Braunstein<br/>\nPacific Data Management, Inc.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aaron_braunstein@...\">aaron_braunstein@...</a>&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
