I&#39;d prefer to go with a small<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; group of a bit higher than me (say a group of 3 35s-40s), or a full group of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; low 30s.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Well you should have the sash and headband already if not get em<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; already.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Any chance in hell I can camp the spawns at that level?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The rock in solB is in the king room. It takes a full group of 6 35&#39;s to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; camp that room (and even then the king will most likely wipe you out).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Or just a few of 45&#39;s. The raster area is much more campable at that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; level but still all the mobs are 35 (cept for the elder not sure on its<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; level).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
