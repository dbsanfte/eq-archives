People WERE exploiting the FD especially<br/>\ninside the planes. One way to fix that WITHOUT screwing a lot of lower level<br/>\npeople was to make it where any creature under level 35, would think you<br/>\nwere dead and forget about you while creatures 35th and up would use the<br/>\ndifferent percentages setup by Verant. I think this fair. I have ONLY used<br/>\nfeign death in serious situations where there was a train on my butt and I<br/>\nwas definitely going to die because I couldn&#39;t make it to a zone. I feel<br/>\nthat&#39;s what it was intended to do and some people figured out a way to<br/>\nexploit it in the planes with the big creatures. So thats that. I&#39;m fine<br/>\nwith it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for other things, I have a 36th level monk on the Tribunal and I WOULDN&#39;T<br/>\nhave made it this far without having a balanced group of guildmembers to go<br/>\naround with. Since monks dont get the huge amounts of HPs we really lose out<br/>\nto the other warrior classes. Saying that I can honestly say that the monks<br/>\nare the best class in the game. I know you&#39;re looking forward to that flying<br/>\nkick skill too and while i&#39;m at 180 skill I still miss about 60% of the time<br/>\n,AGAINST LOW BLUES,even though I have a 131dex and 137agi. Even with these<br/>\nproblems I will continue to play my monk though, UGLY robe and all, because<br/>\nI have to admit I have had fun playing it. Seeing &quot;You kick a greater kobold<br/>\nfor 88 points.&quot; is one hell of a rush. I also have one hell of  bank<br/>\naccount.<br/>\n<br/>\nCarissa (36th level Monk, Tribunal)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
