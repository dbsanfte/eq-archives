Emotions sometimse run high and I wanted to defend my point of<br/>\nview taht Twinking is a personal choice regaurdless of wether you yourself<br/>\nsupport twinking or not.  <br/>\nAnyway,  I agree the twinking debate has gotten old so I will IGNORE any<br/>\nfurther posts on the subject no matter how they irritate me.<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. 500p is a reasonable amount to have SAVED up by level 18, but making<br/>\n500p IN ONE DAY at level 19 is amazing, he may not wnat to give away his<br/>\nsecret, but what ever he is doing to make that kind of money I would like <br/>\nto know... <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mon, 20 Sep 1999, Scott Hueseman wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Scott Hueseman&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shueseman@...\">shueseman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: Dave Kuehn &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dwkuehn@...\">dwkuehn@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I didn&#39;t sign up to hear people bitch and moan about twinking and spell<br/>\n&gt; &gt;nerfing.  While I&#39;m not positive, I would think that most of you didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt;sign up to hear about it either.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Here, here.  If I wanted to hear whining and ranting, I&#39;d go read EQVault <br/>\n&gt; message boards.    I liked the stories, questions and roleplaying stuff I <br/>\n&gt; heard when I first joined the list.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyway, does anyone think the new silk armor is pretty cool for low-mid <br/>\n&gt; level monks?  Sure, it makes woven outdated, but it definitely makes <br/>\n&gt; tailoring a viable trade skill again.    I hope someday it ends up being <br/>\n&gt; like jewelry is now.   Ah, it only took verant six months to add the <br/>\n&gt; remaining tailor patterns.   Maybe smiths will be able to craft other armor <br/>\n&gt; and weapons next!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Oh, and on the subject of what is an appropriate amount of money for a level <br/>\n&gt; 19 monk (someone posted they had 500pp at that level):  I had 200pp saved up <br/>\n&gt; at level 18, and I really didn&#39;t try to make money.   Certain areas <br/>\n&gt; (gargoyle isle, beholder) are very very profitable.   Had I been trying to <br/>\n&gt; amass wealth, I could have easily had 500pp by now.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Dornn, Level 18 Silent Fist, Brell Serilis server<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
