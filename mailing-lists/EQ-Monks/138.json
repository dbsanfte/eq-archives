You cannot <br/>\ndisarm magical weapons from critters.  Even if you do disarm a crittter you <br/>\nwill not notice a difference in the damage it does or in its attack rate. <br/>\n Aside from a few laughs (you can practice it against green critters), it&#39;s <br/>\nreally not all that useful vs. critters.<br/>\n<br/>\nUntil a few days ago I was under the impression that we could not disarm <br/>\nmagical weapons from PCs, but a (still very pissed off) high elf paladin <br/>\ntold me that he had indeed been disarmed in a dual.  Personally, I think <br/>\nthat we should be able to disarm in a dual.  It&#39;s not like the other <br/>\nclasses can&#39;t use disarm, they just don&#39;t get the skill as early as we do. <br/>\n If they&#39;re afraid of being disarmed they can go get magical gloves and <br/>\nthey can practice hand to hand for a couple weeks, or they can just not <br/>\naccept the dual.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a side note, warriors (and probably rouges) can fight just as well hand <br/>\nto hand as a monk until 20th level.  Why?  Monks are the only class that <br/>\ncan MASTER hand to hand, and 100 skill (attainable at 19th level) is still <br/>\nexcellent not master.  In fact, a warrior will probably hit harder due to <br/>\ntheir strength being on the average greater, but they will not swing quite <br/>\nas often as a monk.  (That should also kind of explain why we have to have <br/>\npatience and wait for our characters to become powerful.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI love playing a monk, I&#39;m so glad that I didn&#39;t play a warrior and that I <br/>\nstopped playing my shaman.  I build my character almost totally wrong (10 <br/>\ninto INT of all things, seriously) and I still rage.  As far as I&#39;m <br/>\nconcerned I&#39;m the weakest monk for my level that ever was and will be, but <br/>\nI can still make warriors look silly.  Sure it takes a while to get there, <br/>\nbut it&#39;s sure worth it when you do.<br/>\n<br/>\nDorath Quickfist<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:simpsonsfan84@...\">simpsonsfan84@...</a><br/>\nSent:\tFriday, July 09, 1999 9:10 PM<br/>\nTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject:\t[EQ-Monks] Disarm skill<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:simpsonsfan84@...\">simpsonsfan84@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple of days ago when I logged on the chat server they had that <br/>\nquestion<br/>\n&quot;Should you be able to use the disarm skill in a PvP situatioin?&quot;  Can you<br/>\nuse it now in a PvP situation and they are thinking about changing it or is <br/>\nit the other way around?  I think monks should be able to because it is one <br/>\nof the skills we get, and it makes us who we are.  Why even give us the<br/>\nskill if we can&#39;t use it.  Also to the people that already have it, what<br/>\nhappens when you disarm?  Does the weapon go on the ground or in your<br/>\ninventory?
