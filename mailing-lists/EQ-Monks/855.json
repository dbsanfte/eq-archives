Clerics and Warriors could possibly do it, but that would be <br/>\n&gt; nightmarish. Wizards simply can&#39;t due to the lack of a Pet.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;          Shadow Knights are really the class that was designed with Soloing <br/>\n&gt; in mind. Especially the infamous Troll Shadow Knight. Until Kiting was <br/>\n&gt; restricted though, they were not the best at it. Druids USED to be the best <br/>\n&gt; Solo class in the game. Now, it is a toss-up between Shamans, Druids, <br/>\n&gt; Monks, Necros, and SKs.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;          Personally, I would hate to try and Solo my way to 50 as an <br/>\n&gt; Enchanter. The Pets we get are weak and Charm is &quot;unstable&quot;. Don&#39;t get me <br/>\n&gt; wrong, I love Charm but I like having a nice BIG Warrior right beside me to <br/>\n&gt; Taunt the Mob off when Charm breaks.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
