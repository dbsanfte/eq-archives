The beast therein are enemies to our kind, and swift<br/>\nexecution<br/>\nof such foul creatures will only serve to improve the esteem with which all of<br/>\nthe monks of Qeynos regard you. Take all due precautions, however.  Never turn<br/>\nyour back to a gnoll as they are prone to rally their dispicable brethren in a<br/>\nvulgar call to arms against our kind.  Carry a full supply of straps for<br/>\nbinding; you will suffer injuries both great and mild in the burrow that even<br/>\nyour thoughtful meditations may be unable to heal.  And always head the<br/>\ncall of<br/>\nothers warning of approaching gnoll platoons; make haste for a safe spot but,<br/>\nif you are able, assist those in need on your way.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are other advantages to battling the gnolls of Blackburrow as well. I<br/>\nwould advise you to discuss those very beast with Master Phin at the house of<br/>\nthe Silent Fist. He may have a vital mission requiring your attention.<br/>\n<br/>\nMay Quellious guide you,<br/>\n<br/>\nManjushri<br/>\nMonk of the 10th Order, disciple of Quellious the Tranquil<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 07:26 AM 8/24/99 -0500, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Clarkson, Ron L&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:clarkrl3@...\">clarkrl3@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;OK.  I am a 7th level monk travelling through the Qeynos area on the new<br/>\n&gt;Tribunal server.  I&#39;ve run into a stump, though.  It seems to me that<br/>\n&gt;everything in the area is now either conning green or conning yellow (few<br/>\n&gt;and far between).  However, if I go to different zones, it&#39;s instant red<br/>\n&gt;cons.
