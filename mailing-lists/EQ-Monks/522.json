I&#39;ve read WAY<br/>\ntoo much about which stat should go where, and the only consensus is that<br/>\nno one really knows.<br/>\n<br/>\nmy philosophy is 2 fold.  <br/>\n<br/>\n1) I belive (with no empirical data to back it up) that once a stat gets to<br/>\na certain level, adjusting that stat will have diminishing returns. i.e<br/>\nadd +5 to a stat that is at 90, and thats a big change.  and +5 to a<br/>\nstat that is at 130, and the change is less noticeable.<br/>\n<br/>\nand <br/>\n<br/>\n2) most of the high level shiverback stuff adjusts str, dex, and agil.<br/>\n(also stamina)<br/>\n<br/>\nso, I&#39;m trying to build a well balanced character.  Its quite possible<br/>\nthat for some situations agil is needed, for others str in important.<br/>\ndifferent situations are based on Mob type, group/solo, level...just too<br/>\nmany varieties.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m also trying to get a balance of +resistance (cold, fire, magic..etc).<br/>\nThat seems to be quite a bit more difficult<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not saying that anyone is right, or anyone is wrong.  Just a humble<br/>\nmonk expaining his philosophies.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\non a side note.  I also have a feeling that speading up our attacks would<br/>\nhave the biggest impact.  I&#39;m planning on duel weilding some maces (rate<br/>\nof 28) to compare against my fists.<br/>\n<br/>\n-dj<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Fri, 10 Sep 1999 <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Felizpunk@...\">Felizpunk@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Felizpunk@...\">Felizpunk@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  I would go for improving mainly AGI and DEX...
