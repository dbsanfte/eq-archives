To my <br/>\nunderstanding, they do NOT drop the claw for the Karg quest.  They drop the <br/>\nTalon for the crafted breastplate quest.   I believe you can only get a claw<br/>\n<br/>\nfrom werewolves in outdoor areas.   Someone please, please correct me if I <br/>\nam wrong, but I believe this to be true.<br/>\n<br/>\nFare well<br/>\n<br/>\nLarn, Brell Serilis<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Lombard.Mikhael&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Mikhael_Lombard@...\">Mikhael_Lombard@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: [EQ-Monks] Werewolf Claw<br/>\n&gt;Date: Tue, 7 Dec 1999 15:12:46 -0800<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hi all, I have decided that it is time for me to complete something I have<br/>\n&gt;set out to do for quite some time. And that is to get a freaking Werewolf<br/>\n&gt;claw. Now being one that does not like to run around in the stupid West<br/>\n&gt;Commonlands, or West Karana asking repetitively anyone have a werewolf on<br/>\n&gt;tracking let me know! I got so bored and tired so I have decided to go to<br/>\n&gt;Mistmoore and try to get to the dance floor. Now I have been to MM quite a<br/>\n&gt;few times but I have never been inside the castle barely even down the ramp<br/>\n&gt;towards the castle. mainly the Grave Yard and the zone line. Now I would<br/>\n&gt;like some help on any suggestions or tips as to what to go or how to go<br/>\n&gt;about getting to the Dance Room with the Gypsies/Werewolves....i.e. party<br/>\n&gt;make up and level or a site where there might be a map. Thanks for your<br/>\n&gt;help.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Kaladiel<br/>\n&gt;39th Level Monk<br/>\n&gt;Brell Serilis<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&lt;&lt; text3.html &gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
