You need to be around lvl 40 to get it, as the <br/>\nmobs you need to kill are in lower guk and in the solb king area.  The mobs <br/>\nare VERY rare spawns, you get pattern and needle from them to make a robe.  <br/>\nYou must be a master tailor yourself, as these items are no drop.  You take a <br/>\nswatch of shadow silk, bard song Johnathan&#39;s Whistling Warsong, the needle <br/>\nand the pattern from your quests and combine them to give you a robe (heard <br/>\nit is crimson in color) that&#39;s stats are worse than a foreman&#39;s tunic that <br/>\ncan be obtained around lvl 30 from sola.  So much for the wonderful monk <br/>\nquest items, bleh.<br/>\n<br/>\nKanja<br/>\nRodcet Nife</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
