Even 2 for that much would be bad.<br/>\n The price has dropped recently so about 200-250 is a<br/>\ndecent range.  Many high levels give them away for<br/>\nfree.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  Monk equipment shouldn&#39;t matter that much.  I will<br/>\nadmit that I have recieved some nice items from guild<br/>\nmembers but what I would recomend you do is buy cured<br/>\nsilk armor.  Pretty decent price.<br/>\n<br/>\n3.  You don&#39;t need to loot everything but don&#39;t think<br/>\nits the end of the world if you go over your limit. <br/>\nTry to hunt near a place you can sell.<br/>\n<br/>\n4.  250pp is quite a bit, you must not buy much.  I<br/>\nonly have about 140pp TOTAL at level 20.  Of course I<br/>\nsupport another character and have recently bought<br/>\nsome jewelry but still, don&#39;t consider yourself low on<br/>\ncash. <br/>\n<br/>\nHammeron Stonspirit<br/>\nMonk of Quellious<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nThousands of Stores.
