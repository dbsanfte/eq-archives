I was stuck with Patchwork boots (leather weighed too <br/>\nmuch) until about level 27 when I finally got hold of some Kobold <br/>\nHide Boots.  I&#39;ve gone through the equipment lists, and besides the <br/>\nShiverback stuff, that&#39;s about as good as we&#39;re likely to get. <br/>\n(Possible exception of the JMan boots, but I&#39;m not going for them <br/>\nbecause the AC sucks and they&#39;re one of the most heavily camped items <br/>\nin the game.)<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nAaron Braunstein<br/>\nPacific Data Management, Inc.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aaron_braunstein@...\">aaron_braunstein@...</a>&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
