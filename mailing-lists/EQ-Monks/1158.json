IT has been confirmed by ABASHI:<br/>\nhigh dex will help your skill to increase more (i.e. learn faster) but dex gets<br/>\nnopart in your DA/DW roll.  DEX is only important for proc&#39;ing weapons, archery,<br/>\nand critical hits.  NONE of which are important to monks.  You can argue this<br/>\npoint back and forth if you like.  There have been studies done to PROVE that<br/>\nDEX has no other effects than those I just stated here.  Abashi has CONFIRMED it<br/>\non the www.everquest.com message board.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Basically the change is going in to reduce the delay on the fists as you<br/>\nlevel.  This means that Augmentation, celerity, and the haste shash effect will<br/>\nSTACK (ie combine) with the delay to make you fists go even faster.  I said this<br/>\nin my original post.<br/>\n<br/>\n3)  You are right there is no  taunt built into our fists or kicks, but neither<br/>\nis there a taunt built into rogue stabs or backstabs,  the Monster will simply<br/>\nbe responding to the entity that is hitting it the most frequently and doing the<br/>\nmost damage (hence the quotes around &quot;hella taunt&quot; - it was a figurative<br/>\nreference).  <br/>\n <br/>\n4) As far as agi affecting ac this is true up to a certain point.  Beyond about<br/>\n120, agi is useless.  DO a test, if your agi is above 130,  equip and de-equip<br/>\nthat golden black pearl choker.  How does your ac change?  My agi is 139, and<br/>\nremoving ALL my Black pearl jewelery has little effect on my AC (reduces it by<br/>\n2).  Replacing it with jagged bands and a 7str, 7int necklace DOES increase my<br/>\nac (by about 15) and the damage on fists by a good deal. This, I find usefull.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n____________________Reply Separator____________________<br/>\nSubject:    RE: [EQ-Monks] Issues with the new damage.<br/>\nAuthor: &quot;John Carney&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jcarney@...\">jcarney@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate:       01/10/2000 2:36 PM<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;John Carney&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jcarney@...\">jcarney@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Now I am by no means Crazy enough to complain about the impending<br/>\n </span></blockquote>enhancements. But I just wanted to share with some of you issues that we<br/>\nmonks wil  face once the patch goes in.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere we go. Time to start another incident.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Every monk above level 20 will be doing a good deal more damage - 15% more<br/>\n </span></blockquote>by level 50.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe, how the delay is being changed, I don&#39;t know. If you re-read GA&#39;s<br/>\npost you could take what he said as the delay cap for the fist is being<br/>\nlowered, but the actual delay isn&#39;t. Possible translation: Augmentation,<br/>\nAlacrity, and Haste Items will HELP YOU MORE, but your fist Delay MAY NOT<br/>\nimprove. Not a straight answer either way.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m open to corrections and other thoughts on this, particularly from<br/>\nBrother Choy.<br/>\n<br/>\n(changing the order of the next few statements)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;What this means is that like rogues we will be doing &quot;hella taunts&quot; with<br/>\n </span></blockquote>our whirling fists.  I may also start using easgle strike a bit more (it<br/>\ntaunts alot less than kick and does almost as much damage).<br/>\n<br/>\nNone of your special attacks acts as a taunt, its _strictly_ damage based.<br/>\nMonsters agro you based on the amount of damage you&#39;re doing, not the attack<br/>\ndoing the damage. (Referring to monk attacks only.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I recommend you all dump some of your dex and agi gear (keep agi above 120,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>but drop dex like a rock - detailed log studies show it is useless to us!)<br/>\nand switch it out for AC stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, it should depend somewhat on whom you&#39;re grouping with. I have<br/>\npersonally been trying to up my dex, in an attempt to get my double attack<br/>\nand dual wield to go off more (that&#39;s not so useless in my eyes). As for<br/>\ndropping AGI, that gives you AC (at least it effects the number on the<br/>\nscreen, which isn&#39;t totally indicative of what&#39;s going on). As near as I can<br/>\ntell, having a High AGI helps you when taking a hit, by lessening the amount<br/>\nof damage you take. I get hit a lot less hard then some of the other party<br/>\nmembers with a lower AGI. (Gotta love the Ranger who casts FLAC.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I know I am going to go in all AC gear from now on, concentrating on str as<br/>\n </span></blockquote>secondary.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sold on the STR gear. The ATK number is a hybrid like AC. Adding<br/>\nanother 5 points of str doesn&#39;t seem to help all that much compared to<br/>\nanother 5 pts of dex. Again, it seems that having another +5 str only gives<br/>\nanother five points of damage. I&#39;d rather spend the inventory spot on a dex<br/>\nitem that gives me another attack chance at a 30+ punch. Still, there is<br/>\nmuch guess work here.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Just be prepared for a change in tactics and gear once the patch goes live.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Indeed! Its a good day for monks, and I&#39;m prepared to be healed a lot more.<br/>\nI&#39;ve been playing with the same group of people of the past month or so, and<br/>\nits been very interesting. I very rarely can get a monster&#39;s attention off<br/>\nthe Ranger with his dual SSOYs, but occasionally it does happen (good old<br/>\nFlying Kick). I&#39;m already embarrassing the paladin (3 levels higher) on<br/>\ndamage to the point where she can rarely pull the mob off me (not counting<br/>\nundead). I&#39;m very curious to see how this works out versus the ranger, post<br/>\npatch. I&#39;m prepared to get some love from my clerics. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nStonedorn Windrunner<br/>\nOOK OOK<br/>\nXegony<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nWant to send money instantly to anyone, anywhere, anytime?<br/>\nYou can today at X.com - and we&#39;ll give you $20 to try it!
