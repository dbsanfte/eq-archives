Basically the ranger or druid carpet cast&#39;s<br/>\nharmony till he reach&#39;s the MoB he wants.  He then cast&#39;s at the MoB and<br/>\npulls him from his original spot through the carpet cast harmony zone<br/>\nwithout pulling anything else.  Unrest/Mistmoore/Cazic are very nice<br/>\nplaces for this.  I have yet to go on a serious LGuk trip yet but I assume<br/>\nthey would do just as good there.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMonks I would have to say are tied for number one with druid/ranger if not<br/>\nthe best.  They can pull multiple mobs....FD....loose one or two, pop up<br/>\nand pull the remaining ones.  Rinse Repeat until they get the desired<br/>\neffect or MoB.  They can also just FD long enough to cancel the entire<br/>\npull altogether....<br/>\n<br/>\nSligo<br/>\nCazic Thule<br/>\nSilent Fist</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
