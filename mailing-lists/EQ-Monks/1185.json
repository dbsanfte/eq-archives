It has never failed for me in<br/>\nthe countless times I&#39;ve used it past 19th level but failed a LOT at<br/>\n17th-18th level.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: James W Hooper &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhooper@...\">jhooper@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOf the monks that I know, it seems that I have the worst luck at getting my<br/>\nMend skill to work, especially in high risk combat situations.  I have<br/>\nmaxed out the skill at 17th level.  This is not an exaggeration.  Yesterday<br/>\nI was soloing scarecrows in West Karana.  I was earning a little Xp and<br/>\npracticing my newly aquired FD skill, which did work,  I used mend 4 times<br/>\nin about a 2 hour period of time.  It worked once, failed twice, and<br/>\nworsened my wounds the last time, which killed me when I had a white<br/>\nscarecrow on its last legs.  My character basically committed suicide at<br/>\nthe point where he was going to win.  As I said, it seems I have the worse<br/>\nluck with Mend.  Does any one else have this problem or am I just the<br/>\nvictim of bad numbers?<br/>\n<br/>\nShando, 17th circle, Silent Fist Clan<br/>\nBertoxxulous<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nGet great offers on top-notch products that match your interests!<br/>\nSign up for eLerts at:<br/>\n&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/elerts1\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/elerts1</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
