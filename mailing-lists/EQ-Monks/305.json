First you have to sneak past <br/>\n&gt; the guards to get into the pass! I have had no problems at level 12 sneaking <br/>\n&gt; past them out fo the water up the right side of the mountain, dont go <br/>\n&gt; straight through them. Or just have a magic user cast invisible on you (no <br/>\n&gt; the guards cant see invisible). Once inside the tunnel you have two choices<br/>\n&gt; 1.) Have a troll who can bind you go into grobb nad make sure that basher <br/>\n&gt; the guard isnt there, zone in ,bind, and get the hell out!<br/>\n&gt; 2.) Im not sure if invisible lasts across zones or while binding but head in <br/>\n&gt; and try that!<br/>\n&gt; KEY--- make sure you bind right when you step into grobba nd turn to face <br/>\n&gt; the exit! When you die and basher is there you only have a plsit second, so <br/>\n&gt; if you are even 4 steps from the door and have to make a 180 you are <br/>\n&gt; screwed! You need to be facing the exit and one step away.<br/>\n&gt; I have done this twice and had no problem. ALso when you sneak out I always <br/>\n&gt; go left up the monutain and out into the water giving the left guard a <br/>\n&gt; little berth.  Byt his method I have never had a problem gtetting out of <br/>\n&gt; Grobb. except the one time wehn i would zone into the swamp and it would put <br/>\n&gt; be 10 feet deep into grobb. I would run and jump to zone out and appear 10 <br/>\n&gt; feet deep into grobb, very strange but that happened only once in many <br/>\n&gt; times! Ya i die alot in gukk.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ATTENTION ONElist MEMBERS!
