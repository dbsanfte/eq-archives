If you recieve &quot;SoANDSo <br/>\nhas fallen to the ground&quot; you have failed.  If you get no message, chances <br/>\nare you succeded (this is not always true).  Go up to a creature that <br/>\nnormally doesnt aggro on you, something really green, smack it, then when <br/>\nyou know it is attacking you, FD.  If it &#39;forgets&#39; you, its working.  My <br/>\nskill is over 100, and it works most all the time, I rarely get the message <br/>\nanymore, but I get many times where I am being mobbed, and I will FD and <br/>\nonly SOME of the mobs forget me, and this is only for a second.  I am <br/>\ncurrently in unrest and I can usually FD to most mobs that are up to a low <br/>\nred to me.  Hags on the other hand I have only fooled a couple of times.  <br/>\nMost of the times even when I time it inbetween their spells, they still <br/>\nseem to not be fooled by my feign.<br/>\n<br/>\nSister Shelza<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Juliebu@...\">Juliebu@...</a><br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: [EQ-Monks] Skills questions<br/>\n&gt;Date: Thu, 16 Mar 2000 17:58:46 -0000<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I got feign death last level and have had no luck with it at all.<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;ve been faithfully practicing (my death screams are still ringing<br/>\n&gt;in my ears) and my skill is up to around 70, but it&#39;s only worked one<br/>\n&gt;time.
