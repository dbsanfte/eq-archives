When fighting Vox I noted a bunch of tanks shouting for invigor,<br/>\nbut my stamina bar was still pretty much full.  I also think it is CHA that<br/>\naffects our susceptibility to charm spells.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:imari_dellimore@...\">imari_dellimore@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI thought I would provide a litttle summary on all the stats that are important<br/>\nto monks and why they are important:<br/>\n<br/>\nIn order of importance:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) STR thisaffects damage on both fists and Flying Kick<br/>\n<br/>\n2) AGI this affects our ac and Mitigates (reduces) damage when we are hit<br/>\n<br/>\n3) STA this allows us to keep fighting without getting fatigued  (important at<br/>\nhigh levels when fights last long and DW/DA go off more often) and adds<br/>\nhitpoints.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) Int/Wisdom  these reduce our suceptability to CHARMING and Messmerizing<br/>\nspells that some high level critters cast, and increase our learning rate.  Good<br/>\nto have for trade skills.<br/>\n<br/>\n5) CHA prices you get at vendor.<br/>\n<br/>\nNOTE: DEX this is UNIMPORTANT and does nothing except increase our LEARNING rate<br/>\nof the melee skills.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
