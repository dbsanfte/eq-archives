You attract their attention with an attack<br/>\n(range attacks are ok here).  They all come steaming after you with<br/>\nmurder in their eyes.  You pull them away from their usually spawn<br/>\npoint and Feign Death.  Some of them will turn and leave eventually,<br/>\nuntil the remainder (the ones your group CAN handle) are left.  Stand<br/>\nand attack them, then draw them back to your group.  Means that you<br/>\nshould never have more targets than you can deal with.  Simple really<br/>\nbut takes a lot of experience and patience to get good at.  Upper Guk<br/>\nis THE place to learn this in my humble opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood hunting,<br/>\n<br/>\nBorix, lvl 24, Karana<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Message: 23<br/>\n&gt;   Date: Fri, 8 Oct 1999 15:30:03 -0600 <br/>\n&gt;   From: &quot;Garza, Russell&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:r.garza@...\">r.garza@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: RE: Pulling<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Can someone tell me how a monk pulls things and what makes them better than<br/>\n&gt;other &#39;pullers&#39;?  sort of go through the technique.
