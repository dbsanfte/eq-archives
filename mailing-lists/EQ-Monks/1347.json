It sounds like you have some issues<br/>\nto deal with here and are very hostile about this discussion.  I started<br/>\nthis thread as an intelleuctual discussion, not a flame war.  Twinkers have<br/>\nno more rights than Kill stealers in my estimation.  Do you feel that we<br/>\nwho started after you automatically owe you repsect because you have played<br/>\na GAME longer than we have?  I don&#39;t think so.  I, too, spend my time in<br/>\ndungeons, dying and dying again, in the search for elusive  items and<br/>\nexperience.  Items and experience are becoming harder and harder to find<br/>\ndue to server overcrowding and spawn camping.  To me, you were lucky that<br/>\nyou didn&#39;t have to deal with people camping spawning points early in the<br/>\nlife of the game.  It was probably easier for you to find creatures of the<br/>\nappropriate level.  When I go out looking, I often find that people will<br/>\njump on monsters, yelling &quot;Mine!  Mine&quot;, like some 2 year old, because they<br/>\nneed the XP or the items.  Do not make assupmtions about me.  I do not take<br/>\nfor granted that I can buy serp bracers for 200pp or any of the other<br/>\nthings.  Why?  Because I play this game for adventuring purposes.  At 17th<br/>\nlevel, I figured that the 200 pp I had stashed away would last me quite a<br/>\nwhile.  That is 200pp I earned the hard way.  No one gave it to me.  It is<br/>\ntwinking that is one of the causes of the drop in prices for items.  If<br/>\nevery 6th level character has access ti items intended for a 20th level<br/>\ncharacter, those items will decrease in value.  As for the fact that you<br/>\nshouldn&#39;t have to invest 9 months into a new character:  Why not?  Are you<br/>\nafraid that you will get bored?  You already have intimate knowledge of<br/>\nmost of the areas of the world that you can use to your advantage.  Why<br/>\nshould you add the capability of walking around with items that your<br/>\ncharacter would never have had to chance to obtain?  To be honest, I do not<br/>\nhave a problem with a character getting a sword or a piece of armor from<br/>\nsomeone, even another of the PCs that a player owns..  There are plenty of<br/>\nhistorical and fantasy based accounts of this, but when someone steps onto<br/>\nthe stage, a new character, decked out in itmes that should belong to a<br/>\n10th level or 20th level or 30th level characters, it really cheeses those<br/>\nof us who are trying to earn the items legitimately.  Every item that goes<br/>\ninto a twinkers hands, is one less that I or another honest player can earn.<br/>\n<br/>\nShando</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
