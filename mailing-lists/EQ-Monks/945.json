I succesfully feigned<br/>\nthem at this point. they returned to thier spawn points . I stood up they<br/>\nimmediatly came back.  so I feign again they return to thier points I get up<br/>\nand run all the way to the small bridge type thing near the sol b spawn<br/>\npoint. I fd again.  I was several mins stand up wait a few and here they<br/>\ncome a running at me. I fd again let them walk away. get up and they come<br/>\nback.<br/>\n <br/>\nA fellow monk on my server experimented in Lguk with some Dar Undead frogs<br/>\nand had similar results even after 5 mins of feign time.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nany other people doing experimentation out there?<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nKizmet Bayashi<br/>\nMonk of the 45th .....<br/>\nE-Marr<br/>\nDa`Kor</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
