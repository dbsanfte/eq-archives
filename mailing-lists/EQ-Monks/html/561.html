As I have expressed in my prior missives, it is not wrong for one to take a<br/>
life in defense. We should seek peace and the glory it offers, but be not<br/>
afraid to engage our talents in the act of self-preservation and the<br/>
defense of<br/>
those near to us. Those vilest of beast that would attack unprovoked are<br/>
deserving of a response in kind. One should strive to keep free from murder<br/>
for<br/>
profit as it is common of only the basest of creatures. May Quellious guide<br/>
you<br/>
and keep you safe.<br/>

&gt;hmm may be tough for you to level if you don&#39;t kill any races that are<br/>
&gt;&#39;&#39;civilized&#39;&#39;.  by &#39;&#39;civilized&#39;&#39; i assume you mean they have a society, since<br/>
&gt;bandits who KOS other people, could hardly be considered civilized<br/>
&gt;by the normal definition of the word.  No kobolds in solusek, no goblins<br/>
&gt;in runnyeye or permafrost, no lizardmen in cazic, no ogres in najena, no<br/>
&gt;orcs in crushbone...  what&#39;s left?<br/>
