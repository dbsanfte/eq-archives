<div id="ygrps-yiv-1983440204">I have not verified this yet, but I was told a way to help my faction<br/>
with the bashers in grobb so that i could enter the city using the guise<br/>
of the deceivers.  The way it supposedly works is this:<br/>
<br/>
1) Have a friend start a new character, in this case a freeport monk.  <br/>
2) Group with the new monk.<br/>
3) Have the new monk turn in his guild note and do as many quests as<br/>
possible.<br/>
<br/>
Supposedly, you get the same faction hits that the new monk gets when he<br/>
does the quests, because you are in the same group and in the same zone.<br/>
I was told i could do this in grobb to get my BashersOfGrobb faction<br/>
raised if i grouped with a level 1 troll warrior as he did the quests<br/>
there.  <br/>
<br/>
The only experience i have that would prove/disprove that this technique<br/>
works is a time that i had just zoned in to south karana to meet a<br/>
friend killing avocets.  He didnt realize I had entered the zone, and he<br/>
completed one of the centaur crafted armor quests.  I know for certain<br/>
that i got experience, and i&#39;m almost positive that i got faction hits<br/>
as well.  (btw those crafted armor quests have very good experience for<br/>
low 30&#39;s)<br/>

&gt; <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; When a monk from Qeynos tries to start the Sash Quests of Freeport, he<br/>
&gt; runs into difficulty. The Qeynos monk&#39;s faction with them is usually<br/>
&gt; too low to allow him to begin the quests. There are several quests in<br/>
&gt; Qeynos that will allow a Freeport monk to increase their faction with<br/>
&gt; the Silent Fist, but no such quests (that I&#39;m aware of) in Freeport to<br/>
&gt; increase faction with the Ashen Order.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Workarounds for this have been the subject of much debate. Many<br/>
&gt; solutions have been presented, however, it looks like Verant has<br/>
&gt; &quot;fixed&quot; them all. I&#39;m going to list all the ones that don&#39;t work now,<br/>
&gt; so that any starting monks won&#39;t fall into these traps...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1) Create a Freeport monk and get his guild note to turn in for<br/>
&gt; instant faction.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Problem: The guild notes are now Lore items, and so are no-drop,<br/>
&gt; no-trade.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2) Do the Tomer and/or Konem Quests in Qeynos.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Problem: The only faction you increase with these now is with the<br/>
&gt; Silent Fist, the Ashen Order does NOT show up anymore.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 3) Get a Freeport monk to give you their White Sash, and then carry on<br/>
&gt; from there.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Problem: If you try to get the next sash by turning in your current<br/>
&gt; sash (gotten from the Freeport monk) and the items, you lose all the<br/>
&gt; items and the sash. The Ashen Guild member will give you a message<br/>
&gt; like &quot;I will not help beings of your kind&quot;. This is especially vexing<br/>
&gt; if you had a Freeport monk to give you the Orange sash, and tried to<br/>
&gt; turn it in for the Red sash. The Red sash items are a little hard to<br/>
&gt; come by, and having them go up in smoke would be frustrating.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In conclusion, it looks like the only way to truly do the quests now<br/>
&gt; is to build your faction with the Freeport monks in some way. I have<br/>
&gt; been noticing that they HAVE been starting to like me more, but, I am<br/>
&gt; unsure as to why. I believe it is because I&#39;ve been killed so many<br/>
&gt; orcs lately. If anyone has any ideas, they would be welcome.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The only possible workaround I see now, is to give the items for the<br/>
&gt; later quests to a Freeport monk (one you create or another player) and<br/>
&gt; have them give you the resulting sash. However, I think the later<br/>
&gt; sashes are no-drop, no-trade, unlike the beginning sashes, which are<br/>
&gt; Lore items, but can be traded.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Finally, the point of the Monk headbands/sashes is not that they are<br/>
&gt; terribly powerful magical items, but that it&#39;s fun and challenging for<br/>
&gt; a monk to complete a quest that is not really available to many other<br/>
&gt; people. Sure there are lots of items that are better, but it&#39;s a nice<br/>
&gt; part of you character when you can say that you are a Purple Headband,<br/>
&gt; Purple Sash holder ;-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; (If I&#39;ve made any glaring errors/omissions, I apologize, and would<br/>
&gt; expect that I will be corrected asap &lt;grin&gt;)<br/>
