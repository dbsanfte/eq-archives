Once this group is sitting in a room you&#39;ll do <br/>
fine...how you&#39;ll ever survive to get there is <br/>
the question. :)  More casters = more downtime <br/>
from all that mana being used.  Now the Bard <br/>
and Encanter help minimize that but essentially <br/>
all your damage is from those wizzies dumping<br/>
on the poor beastie.  I had this same argument <br/>
with a friend and he took the above party <br/>
approach exactly...until the saw it in action <br/>
and realized how poorly it stacks up for dungeon <br/>
crawling to:<br/>
<br/>
1. Monk (best puller in the game bar none)<br/>
2. Warrior (best damage sponge bar none)<br/>
3. Enchanter (amazing...simply amazing)<br/>
4. Cleric (superior/complete heals and res&#39;s)<br/>
5. Shaman (best friend of any tank...2nd healer :)<br/>
6. Druid (Evacs, damage shields and 2nd healer)<br/>
<br/>
Some flexability there but this is pretty darn <br/>
good overall.<br/>
