A slight variation for your early hunting to consider. The advice presented by<br/>
Imari is very well thought out, and mirrors much of my hunting strategies. The<br/>
variations I would propose involve levels 12 through 14 and later Levels 22<br/>
through 25. After your adventures in Misty Thicket up to level 12, take your<br/>
hunt to either the rolling hills of the West Commons or explore the world and<br/>
head to Erud&#39;s Crossing. For the next three levels, try hunting willowisps<br/>
exclusively; your hunt will require gloves that are magical in nature, so be<br/>
sure to equip them before you proceed with slaying wisps. You will get a fare<br/>
amount of experience, and you will also receive plenty of platinum from the<br/>
adventure. Lightstones, you can generally sell to other players for 1 pp.<br/>
Greater Lightstones, you can take with you to North Karana. In that zone is a<br/>
gypsy camp. If you talk to the right gypsy she will request these Greater<br/>
Lightstones in exchange for a book (it is a container, so make sure you have<br/>
1st level inventory slots available). The books can then be resold to her<br/>
for 7<br/>
to 8 pp or you can take them back to your home guild and assuming your faction<br/>
is high enough, sell them for 9 pp. Other players will offer you from 5 to<br/>
7 pp<br/>
for your Greater Lightstones. I would save them and exchange them en masse<br/>
with<br/>
this gypsy for the Concordance of Research (the book I mentioned). This quest<br/>
will also grant you substancial experience for these levels. Turning in<br/>
Lightstones will earn you experience as well, but the item you receive in<br/>
exchange can only be resold for a few silvers, so it is far better to sell<br/>
them<br/>
to other PCs when you find them. Greater Lightstones are not stackable, so you<br/>
may want to make sure you have plenty of back packs and room in the bank. You<br/>
can save the stones in your vault until the time has come to deliver them to<br/>
North Karana. Again, the item you receive from turning in your stones is a<br/>
container, so I would recommend taking four backpacks full of stones and<br/>
keeping your other inventory slots free for the Concordance of Research. You<br/>
will have to exchange them four at a time, but each time you empty a backpack,<br/>
you can sell it to the same gypsy so that you have another inventory slot<br/>
for a<br/>
Concordance.<br/>
<br/>
The other variation in the hunt involves the hunting of Aviaks. As many on<br/>
this<br/>
list know, I, as a follower of The Tranquil, am opposed to the hunting of any<br/>
civilized creature that does not first attack you unprovoked, many may<br/>
disagree<br/>
with this stance. It is up to each individual to decide how best to follow the<br/>
way of Quellious. However, if during these levels, you are passionate about<br/>
hunting solo, I would recommend the Ocean of Tears. There is an island there<br/>
occupied by Greater Skeletons, Gargoyles and four Spectres. The Spectres keep<br/>
to themselves at the top of the island, so they are usually not trouble unless<br/>
a druid is busy kiting them around (so be prepared to feign on a moments<br/>
notice<br/>
if you are not alone on the island). The Gargoyles will provide you with an<br/>
abundant prey for the hunt. The only problem is that they share the spawn with<br/>
the Greater Skels, so you will have to waste some time between engagements<br/>
with<br/>
Gargoyles removing these pesky skeletons. Also, the Gargoyles drop gargoyle<br/>
eyes as loot. These items are stackable, and if you should return them by the<br/>
stack to your guild merchants and your faction is at its maximum for them, you<br/>
should receive just about 9 pp per eye. A stack of 20 then, will serve you<br/>
with<br/>
a tidy sum of 180 pp. Make sure that before you make the trip to the Ocean of<br/>
Tears, you load up on bandages. The Gargs have duel weild and double<br/>
attack, so<br/>
it is not uncommon to be hit three times in one round for up to 40 damage a<br/>
hit. If you have not practice mend and bind wound religiously every level,<br/>
then<br/>
you will get plenty or practice here : ). I usually travel to any place with a<br/>
single eight slot container. Half of which I fill with bandages. You may find<br/>
other alternatives more to your benefit.<br/>
<br/>
Whatever you may choose for your hunt, I wish you well.<br/>
