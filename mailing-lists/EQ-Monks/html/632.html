<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-956838908">I know this is gonna sound sarcastic with no tone being able to be conveyed,<br/>
but try not to look at it this way.  The game was designed for groups.  Once<br/>
you hit a certain level (different for different classes) it&#39;s just almost<br/>
impossible<br/>
to solo.  I know for my bard, he sucked at soloing from about 20-25 in unrest,<br/>
but now at 27 i am able to solo blues again, thanks to fear song and chains<br/>
song.  (This is the part that will sound nasty, but i really don&#39;t mean it<br/>
that way)<br/>
If you only have 10 or 15 minutes I would suggest just playing some other<br/>
non eq game of which there are many good ones.<br/>

&gt;Hi everyone, I&#39;m new to the list, but my monk has hit level 20, and<br/>
&gt;has decided he has killed enough crocodiles.  I&#39;m looking for some<br/>
&gt;place that I could solo from level 20-30 and maybe a place that even<br/>
&gt;gives good monk loot.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also, what kind of armor should I be looking for?  I&#39;m pretty much<br/>
&gt;straight mesh and LJ tunic.<br/>
