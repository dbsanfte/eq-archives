<div id="ygrps-yiv-1974749603">heh I totally agree about the enchanter, and believe me they have my utmost<br/>
respect. I have a regular hunting partner who is an enchanter, and while<br/>
yes, she does have the pulling abilities you mentioned, we both agreed that<br/>
is was far more beneficial for me to pull and her to save her mana for when<br/>
I return with a couple friends. If she pulls two mobs, then both beasts are<br/>
concentrating on her. If I pull 2, only the mob she mez&#39;s will be<br/>
concentrating on her, and I can change that pretty quick by attacking it<br/>
before the Mez wears off. This way, she takes no hits, she does not get<br/>
interrupted, and I do not worry about her being attacked. My personal goal<br/>
in each and every fight is to not let whatever caster I am with get hit, so<br/>
I really don&#39;t want her pulling. She is far more effective debuffing and<br/>
buffing as I come running back to her with critters in tow. The 2 of us<br/>
regularly take out 2 even cons at a time and have taken out 2 yellows on<br/>
rare occasions. And she is the ONLY class I would ever consider attempting 2<br/>
yellows at once. Why? Because of her debuffs. The only 2 buffs she ever<br/>
casts on me are Alacrity and Cloud (weaker versions of Clarity and<br/>
Augmentation I believe. Please correct me if I am wrong.) I don&#39;t know the<br/>
names of all the spells she casts on the critters, but they are simply<br/>
awesome. Whirl, the one that slows the MoB&#39;s attack rate,  and Mez are just<br/>
3 examples... all Debuffs. And that&#39;s what make this class special, in my<br/>
own opinion.<br/>
<br/>
As for their Travel spells, illusion is self only, invis from any class is<br/>
finicky at best (I find camo and superior camo to be more reliable), and I<br/>
am not aware that they get Enduring Breath and Levitate. I do know that my<br/>
partner, a lvl 27 enchanter, has never cast either one on me, so perhaps it<br/>
is a higher level spell. Again, please correct me if I am mistaken. The<br/>
druid I hunt with has both, and the Wiz has Lev (and Evac for the first time<br/>
last night, whew!). While Evac is a great perk to the Wiz class, it is not<br/>
the reason I hunt with a Wizard. If we get into a situation that requires<br/>
Evac, then something has gone very very wrong. To group with a Wiz because<br/>
of Evac is expecting things to go very very wrong. That is not a group I<br/>
wish to be a part of.<br/>
<br/>
I did not mean to belittle any class with my breakdown, and I apologize if<br/>
it came across that way. I was merely pointing out the primary reasons<br/>
different classes are called upon in an average grouping situation (in my<br/>
experience, at least). I suppose that it boils down to the fact that<br/>
recently I have grown weary of some monks claiming that we have become<br/>
useless with this or that patch, and that we need x, y, and/or z to become a<br/>
more viable and useful class. I think we have it pretty damn good, and<br/>
personally don&#39;t see a need for gloves that proc or nunchukas that stun or<br/>
anything else for that matter. The only thing I have a problem with is the<br/>
value of the sashes and headbands when you compare them to the items we turn<br/>
in to get them and the stats they provide. But that has been mentioned going<br/>
way back to the Betas, so it is fairly obvious that nothing was ever planned<br/>
to change in those regards. The monk is, in my own opinion, the class that<br/>
has the least amount of balancing issues. I stick by my assertion that the<br/>
two most important things you can do when in a group situation is to 1)<br/>
Communicate efficiently and 2) know the strengths and weaknesses of your<br/>
class and play within your strengths.<br/>

&gt; &gt;All classes (except Druid and Shaman) have one thing they are outstanding<br/>
&gt; &gt;at, and other things they do ok, and some things they just plain stink<br/>
&gt; at.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Why is it bad to be sought after because we are the best pullers in the<br/>
&gt; &gt;lands?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;          Two points of contention here:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;          First, Enchanters have MANY things they are outstanding at. Buff <br/>
&gt; (Clarity and Augmentation anyone?), Debuff (obvious), Travel (Illusions, <br/>
&gt; Invis, Enduring Breath, Lev, etc.... ). Wizzies have duel roles too. They <br/>
&gt; are bar none the best damage dealers and the best for getting a group out <br/>
&gt; of a sticking situation (Evacs). The only class that I can think of that <br/>
&gt; DOESN&#39;T have more than one role in a group is a Warrior. They are Tanks <br/>
&gt; only. They don&#39;t do anything else well (and sometimes they don&#39;t even Tank<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; well).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;          Second, Enchanters are the best pullers in the game hands down. <br/>
&gt; They RARELY perform this function, but they can do it better and safer<br/>
&gt; than <br/>
&gt; anyone else. Watch an Enchanter Lull all the Mobs and then pull the one <br/>
&gt; they want (and ONLY the one they want) back to the group. Plus, if they do<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; pull too many, they just Mez everything and continue pulling the single <br/>
&gt; they wanted. Once you have seen an Enchanter do this you will gain a new <br/>
&gt; level of respect. Monks are the second best pullers though.   :-)<br/>
