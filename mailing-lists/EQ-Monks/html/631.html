<b>Subject:</b> Twinking and level reqs on equipment <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1488984632">Well, honestly, I&#39;ve been playing EQ about 2 weeks now, and it&#39;s kinda<br/>
funny to see the outrage of many people at the old MUD tactics<br/>
surfacing on the revitalized online playing.<br/>
<br/>
It simply comes down to this, those who twink are completely blind<br/>
(voluntarily) to the fact that it does affect other gamers, however<br/>
slight the effect may be in certain cases.  Level reqs for equipment<br/>
have existed for YEARS in the MUD/MERC world and have had no serious<br/>
gameplay flaws leveled at them yet. Although,  general DIKU mud types<br/>
without level reqs had all sorts of people complaining about not having<br/>
a higher level sugar daddy to twink them.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, there are a couple of folks who worked and labored to get their<br/>
power character together begin the sugar daddy process and they have<br/>
the rights to it.  But they appreciate the difficulty of making it<br/>
there alone, and would usually be at least a little moderated in the<br/>
doling out of great stuffs.  <br/>
<br/>
The problem almost always occurs with the first generation of lev 50<br/>
twinks. (or whatever the lev max was for the particular MUD)  These are<br/>
people who have little to no sense of time investment and patience. <br/>
They bolt for the levs, spells and abilities, hell bent on obtaining<br/>
bragging rights on being the fastest to kill a certain mob from lev 1,<br/>
or being the lowest lev char to kill a certain mob.  <br/>
<br/>
They have very little sense of teamwork with other players, and<br/>
generally do not group well with non-twinks, because they tend to rely<br/>
on the strength of the equipment to win the day over their character<br/>
abilities.  This doesn&#39;t work with non-twinks, since their lack of<br/>
super stuff is little to non-existant, so when the group dies, the<br/>
twink blames his teammates, when in reality, equipped with what he<br/>
himself could appropriate, he would normally fare worse.<br/>
<br/>
Level req&#39;d items have worked fine for years, and not only has it<br/>
removed the &quot;majority&quot; of twinking (not all. no one is stupid enough to<br/>
say all lev 15 eq is the same) Goals are now for groups to work to<br/>
obtain that borderline equipment.  But, if it happens to be a couple<br/>
levs over the group in strength, you can bet a character out there 2<br/>
levs up will pay top dollar for it.  This opens up the trade market a<br/>
bit more for lower lev characters.<br/>
<br/>
To sum up, the only people who have really complained of equipment<br/>
level requirements are the twinks themselves.  Other gamers take it in<br/>
stride, and it even provides that unofficial quest syndrome the &quot;Level<br/>
13 Shiny Brass Shield quest&quot; would be followed by quite a few.<br/>
<br/>
As for implementation, it&#39;s simple.  The standing rule was always level<br/>
of the mob = level of the loot.  Providing a level flag to the basic<br/>
object types in code is neither time consuming nor difficult, proper<br/>
testing would be done and it could be implemented without a great deal<br/>
of hassle, except the twinks screaming in horror now that their lev 14<br/>
character can&#39;t sweep crushbone alone anymore.<br/>
