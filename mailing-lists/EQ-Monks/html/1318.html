&gt;Nothing wrong with being different.  However, I would not choose to wear<br/>
&gt;those items because of their weight.  I know that the Lizzy Mantle<br/>
&gt;weighs 2.5 which is quite a bit.<br/>

stones and that includes food, drink, and several stacks of bandages. It not<br/>
much of a burden and it is greater by 2 AC over cured silk. I am also<br/>
sometimes<br/>
guilty of duel weilding combine warhammers (7.3 WT). Typically I group with a<br/>
warrior and a ranger along with casters, so I rarely take hits and can afford<br/>
the over 20 weight. I hope to replace them soon with Black Enamelled Maces<br/>
which will shed about six stones of weight. Nothing else on my person weighs<br/>
much more than 0.1 with the exception of a Bracer of Erolissi (1.0 WT) and a<br/>
Serpentine Bracer (0.8 WT). Rusty Spike Shoulderpads, incidentally, are also<br/>
2.5 WT and provide 3AC with +5 STR.<br/>
