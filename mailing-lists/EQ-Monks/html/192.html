<div id="ygrps-yiv-185281202"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;The Grass is Greener Syndrom has landed on us, has it?  It&#39;s all been said:<br/>
&gt;No one class is best -- that&#39; why we group. I&#39;ve put a lot of time in other<br/>
&gt;classes, but so far, I like being a monk best of all. It&#39;s always going to<br/>
&gt;be a personal preference thing. If you&#39;re unhappy, role another character,<br/>
&gt;but remember that no one class is really best at soloing -- some are better<br/>
&gt;than others, but all in all, I think we (monks) have a pretty well balanced,<br/>
&gt;kick ass class.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>	My feelings are similar.  I have loved my monk more than any <br/>
of the other many classes I played from the moment I started him.  I <br/>
knew going in that I wouldn&#39;t be as good as a &#39;classic&#39; tank as would <br/>
be a warrior and wouldn&#39;t be able to match them in damage until at <br/>
least the upper 20&#39;s.  I didn&#39;t mind this so much and took a kind of <br/>
perverse pride in the fact that monks didn&#39;t &#39;mature&#39; until much <br/>
later - making them a labor of love and patience.  Well, I&#39;m finally <br/>
&#39;mature&#39; (meaning I&#39;ve hit 30 and now have Flying Kick), but it seems <br/>
that my hopes for being as valuable a contributor to my party as our <br/>
warrior have been undercut.<br/>
	I&#39;ve always bemoaned the lack of Taunt, because I see it as <br/>
one of my primary callings in life - to protect others (especially <br/>
those who have dedicated themselves to the healing arts).  Without <br/>
such a tool, this has been extremely difficult.  I have consoled <br/>
myself with the knowledge that recently I had achieved a rough parity <br/>
with our warrior in terms of the ability to put down a creature who <br/>
had come up against our group.  We would split duties and assignments <br/>
as equals (except in those situations where our individual abilities <br/>
dictated otherwise).  Now this parity is no more.<br/>
	I have no desire to see monks become a &#39;superclass&#39;... if <br/>
they were everybody would play them and how much fun would THAT be? <br/>
Nor am I looking for the ability to solo.  I vastly prefer group play <br/>
and find it to be much more rewarding on a number of levels. <br/>
Unfortunately, the benefits which can be brought to a group by monks <br/>
have been marginalized by the incredible adjustments made to the <br/>
warrior class.  I would just like to see some thought given to giving <br/>
monks a greater ability to contribute again, that&#39;s all.<br/>
