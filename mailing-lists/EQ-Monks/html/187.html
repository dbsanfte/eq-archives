<div id="ygrps-yiv-86231593">Naah dude that is wack..  On Fennin Ro Bodhi (The First EVER lvl 50 monk,<br/>
Leader of Dragoon of A.....(sorry bod i cna&#39;t remember))  Anyways we have<br/>
done MANY Nagafen and Vox adventures and he is pretty much ther eason why.<br/>
He is able to pull out those Fire/Ice Giants in a steady pace so that we can<br/>
handle them easily.  I feel i have something to look forward to when i get<br/>
my monk 20 levels higher.  Then my guild won&#39;t have to depend on the<br/>
Dragoons for so much stuff (heh).<br/>
<br/>
Monks, Rogues, Warriors, none of these classes are made to really solo<br/>
(although rogues should be able to) They need groups, in groups their skills<br/>
are magnified by such an amazing degree it is beyond comprehension.  If a<br/>
Monk has a smart cleric or shaman he can take mobs on that are 5-7 levels<br/>
higher then him, just by being constantly buffed and healed.<br/>
<br/>
People that complain about monks being sorry were just not made to play<br/>
monks they should play a necro or mage or Wiz (good solo classes) So give<br/>
them a spin fellas!<br/>
<br/>
Thats all!!<br/>
