&gt; Verant doesn&#39;t want you to be able to do this or else they would have<br/>
&gt; made macro programs usable... if a GM found you, you would most likely<br/>
&gt; be banned.  There was a great deal of problem with this in UO, Verant<br/>
&gt; has tried hard not to make it a problem in Everquest.<br/>

      Heh, reason I quit EQ is because Everlevel got rather boring, as there<br/>
was no point to it after hitting level 50, (And their pvp was terrible).<br/>
AC... Well.. Thats different... AC is boring and worthless unless you play<br/>
on a pvp server, then it gets interesting.  Also... someone 5 or even 10<br/>
levels above you cant just kill you off the bat... If you get ahead in the<br/>
fight then you can win too...<br/>
<br/>
      If you hate zones, AC is good too.<br/>
<br/>
      Its also possible to kill monsters much higher level than you, thus<br/>
faster and less tedious leveling<br/>
<br/>
       Thats all I have to say, now back to raising my archer up to level 10<br/>
so I can hit the golem burial grounds...<br/>
