<div id="ygrps-yiv-1254130067">You want an advantage?  Tell him you will duel him nude.  Hehe, I did this <br/>
before a while ago.  I told the person (I think he was an <br/>
warrior/ranger/paladin, I cant remember exactly it was a while ago) and I <br/>
told him I would fight him, directly after we both suicided by attacking a <br/>
high level guard, and then not looting our corpse.  Of course he had no idea <br/>
that monks pretty much repop combat ready, he figured it would be two <br/>
unarmored, unarmed people relying on skills like kick to do damage.  So <br/>
while he was hitting me for 4 and 5 points, and his kicks were doing like <br/>
10-12, my punches were landing for 10-12 points, and my tiger claw was <br/>
getting him for 9-11 each time.  needless to say the imbalance in hitpoints <br/>
didn&#39;t matter much, it wasn&#39;t long before he dropped.<br/>

&gt;  I have a question that hasn&#39;t been addressed, at least as long as I have<br/>
&gt;been reading this board.<br/>
&gt;  I have been challenged to a duel by a 23 Paladin as soon as I hit his lvl<br/>
&gt;(I&#39;m currently at 22) and wondered if there are any hints/strategies to<br/>
&gt;dueling as a monk that might help. I haven&#39;t dueled since lvl 5 and have no<br/>
&gt;idea what to do to give myself any kind of advantage. He is a bit tweeked<br/>
&gt;whereas I am not so that will give him even more of an advantage of course,<br/>
&gt;but I believe I still have a chance......anything anyone can think of that<br/>
&gt;might help me out?  I would REALLY appreciate any help on this esp. since I<br/>
&gt;have to work with this guy every day.<br/>
&gt;  I have a little more of a desire to beat him since he just happens to be <br/>
&gt;my<br/>
&gt;supervisor, too!!!    :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I thank you all in advance for your input.<br/>
