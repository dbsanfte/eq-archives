<div id="ygrps-yiv-51374872">The Iskare hate EVERYONE, so they won&#39;t be friendly to you. Why should they?<br/>
Both the Good and Evil races have invaded their little island, so I&#39;m sure<br/>
they&#39;re going to be pretty upset.<br/>
<br/>
I did a fair amount of the zones lastnight, and the zones are FRIGGIN HUGE.<br/>
The poly count has been upped dramatically in all zones, bringing my p2-450<br/>
Viper770 256meg machine to a crawl. (The frogloks city in The Swamp comes to<br/>
mind).<br/>
<br/>
Make no joke, the hard zones are hard.<br/>
<br/>
Really hard. The castle is insanely difficult. Ook Ook (my guild) but two<br/>
solid groups together and got about a quarter of the way in... reminds me of<br/>
hate.<br/>
<br/>
The iskar newbie zone, Lake of Ill Omen might be a good place for you to<br/>
hunt with your Ogre shaman. I&#39;ll be runing down a human cleric and Shadow<br/>
Knight twink to asses the difficulty of the new zones.<br/>

I thought that my troll shaman would be a great canadate to take to Kunark,<br/>
cause he was evil and worshiped the same god as the monks of the Iskar.  Man<br/>
was I wrong.  The only thing so far I have found in kurnark that are NOT<br/>
hostile to my trollie, is the little town in The Overthere, which is a bunch<br/>
of evil races in an encapment.  If I wasn&#39;t a shaman, I couldn&#39;t bind there,<br/>
and I cant hunt there because everything is blood red, and scowling.  I made<br/>
my way to the iskar city, with a little luck and help from sow, and found<br/>
they are scowling and ready to attack.  So I made my way to the good elf<br/>
encampent, and guess what?  Scowling no less.  Does any one know of a race<br/>
that the iskar ARE friendly to?<br/>

<br/>
well being evil is a pain in the ass unless you are willing to work on<br/>
factions.<br/>
i was just pointing out that being able to kill goodie goodie guards is not<br/>
one<br/>
of the advantages to being evil, since the goodie goodie races kill goodie<br/>
goodie<br/>
guards as well.  and actually maybe have an easier time of it than evil<br/>
races, since they could kill guards til faction drops to apprehensive and<br/>
then<br/>
do quests to knock it back up again, whereas the evil folks have a hell of<br/>
a time doing side quests just so they can get non-kos so they can do the<br/>
real<br/>
faction quests.<br/>

&gt;Hell no.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My point was that being evil is NOT the bad thing that a lot make it<br/>
&gt;out to be.  It&#39;s actually quite a good thing in many ways.<br/>
