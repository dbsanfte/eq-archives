<div id="ygrps-yiv-1095402799">Odds are the lower level players who have them either:<br/>
<br/>
A.  Are played by people with higher level characters (twinks)<br/>
B. Are played by friends of people with higher level characters (twinks)<br/>
C. Bought them with RL money (eBay)<br/>
<br/>
Anything else I may have missed?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But the problem is that there are those at my level or close to it who<br/>
*can* afford this stuff.  Why, because they have been killing and looting<br/>
and I have been RPing.</div>
