<div id="ygrps-yiv-2146528617">Yeah, I&#39;ve been beta&#39;ing AC, and you can chose to the shade what color skin,<br/>
clothing, eyes, hair, hairstyle, etc. you get.  Granted however at least on<br/>
the low end you all start looking hte same as you buy gear, but it is a nice<br/>
change.<br/>
<br/>
The thing is with graphics, they are simply not going to put in new stuff<br/>
for the old continents.  The expansion pack will add some new textures and<br/>
the requirements (hardware) while yer there are higher so they can give you<br/>
some more degrees of differentiation, but from what I understand it will<br/>
only be like that in those new areas.<br/>
<br/>
What I would suggest, since they won&#39;t add textures, is that if you want a<br/>
different look you /feeback and email for more monk coloration (colors are<br/>
not textures as I understand it).  Bout the best we can hope for.<br/>

  Oh, it&#39;s so great in Asheron&#39;s Call, everyone does look different.  Maybe<br/>
they will<br/>
  include new graphics in the expansion set?<br/>
