<b>Subject:</b> RE: Bind for Guk? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1975487075">News from a friend of mine actually makes the suggestion of a level 7 monk<br/>
binding in Grobb even more dangerous:<br/>
It seems that on my sever (tarew Marr) 23 level 45+ guys (several from my<br/>
guild) decided to go into the PoF (fear plane).  THey zoned in, one at a<br/>
time or in small groups of 2 or 3.  <br/>
<br/>
THere is a fact of life that you who play on pvp servers are well aware<br/>
of:  when you zone your body &#39;pops&#39; in the new zone several seconds before<br/>
your client is aware of it. Well in the few seconds that it took their<br/>
clients to register the change in zone, EVERY SINGEL ONE of the 20+ person<br/>
team was killed save afew wizzies and a cleric who had cast<br/>
invulnerability on himself. <br/>
<br/>
Now picture for a moment this scenario:  our level 7 monk binds in Grob<br/>
and sneaks away for a night of adventure in guk.  The inevitable happens<br/>
and he is trained  - he re-pops in Grobb.  When he re-pops he is spotted<br/>
by a bouncer who charges him and kills him in 2 quick chops.  He pops<br/>
again, but before his client can even register the change in position, he<br/>
is killed again.  This Loop of death continues untill our friend (the<br/>
formerly level seven monk) shuts off his computer - I mean what else can<br/>
he do? He cant log ou....<br/>
<br/>
It would be an UNMITIGATED disaster!<br/>
<br/>
My advice: bind in FP.<br/>

&gt; Well, at 35 a monk certainly has nothing to fear binding in grobb.<br/>
&gt; Level 7 might be risky though, as you point out.  <br/>

&gt; &gt; I think this plan smacks of &quot;Unrecoverable corpse&quot;.    I have a level<br/>
&gt; &gt; 35<br/>
&gt; &gt; character and would not dare try this.  Bear in mind that at levle 7<br/>
&gt; &gt; guard<br/>
&gt; &gt; s will kill you in one hit - they hit for  upwards of 100 dmge and<br/>
&gt; &gt; double<br/>
&gt; &gt; attack almost every time.<br/>
