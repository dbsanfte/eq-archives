<div id="ygrps-yiv-1898920510">Yea one of my big money makers was making raw silk armor.  30 plat for a 13 <br/>
peice suit.  Low level mages and monks would go nuts over that stuff.  Also, <br/>
another big money maker for me well before I was 10th level, is I hung <br/>
around in the sewers in Qeynos, I know those places upside down.  And there <br/>
were a few things in there high level people were some times interested in.  <br/>
I would have level 20-50s come in and not know there way around the place.  <br/>
That is where I came in.  I would show them to where ever it was they wanted <br/>
to go, and I got as much as 50 plat for showing someone around.  Of course, <br/>
sometimes they wouldn&#39;t pay me squat.  But they had to get out of the place <br/>
sometimes.  Heheh, and when they did, if they didn&#39;t pay anything to me <br/>
before for showing them the place, I would make myself a little too <br/>
convienantly busy to show them back out, till they offered the big bucks.  <br/>
:)  Being a monk, I find it my duty to know zones inside and out.  If I hang <br/>
out in a zone for more than just a casual passthough, I make sure I know <br/>
that zone inside and out, as far as spawns, rates of spawns, bad places, <br/>
good places, and rare spawns and where items can be found.  I get most of my <br/>
information from web sites.  Alahkazams is the best.  And I tell you, people <br/>
pay if you can guide them to that &#39;rare&#39; item mob.  And even more so they <br/>
are usually pretty impressed and remember you for future reference.  Doing <br/>
good business requires providing a good service.<br/>
<br/>
Oh and BTW, I said I had traded over 1000 plat of stuff, I never said I had <br/>
that in the bank.  Unfortunatly some of the nicer items I have on me now <br/>
pretty much depleted most of my funds.<br/>

&gt;1000 pp in the bank for a lvl 18 monk?  I&#39;d guess you do a LOT of<br/>
&gt;trading.  Don&#39;t think I had a grand in the bank until I was doing HGs<br/>
&gt;in Rathe.  But then I spend no time at all trading, usually just give<br/>
&gt;my obselete stuff to friends or strangers.<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;First off, I am not twinked, every thing I got I earned the money for <br/>
&gt;myself.  As a monk this is really easy to do as monks dont have anything to <br/>
&gt;spend money on but good armor.  By the time I was 10th level, I had over <br/>
&gt;100 plat saved, by the time I reached 18th I had bought and sold over 1000 <br/>
&gt;plat worth of stuff, all done by money and items I have earned myself by <br/>
&gt;selling loot or trade skills.<br/>
