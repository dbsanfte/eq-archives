<div id="ygrps-yiv-1841207964">I have a question that hasn&#39;t been addressed, at least as long as I have<br/>
been reading this board.<br/>
 I have been challenged to a duel by a 23 Paladin as soon as I hit his lvl<br/>
(I&#39;m currently at 22) and wondered if there are any hints/strategies to<br/>
dueling as a monk that might help. I haven&#39;t dueled since lvl 5 and have no<br/>
idea what to do to give myself any kind of advantage. He is a bit tweeked<br/>
whereas I am not so that will give him even more of an advantage of course,<br/>
but I believe I still have a chance......anything anyone can think of that<br/>
might help me out?  I would REALLY appreciate any help on this esp. since I<br/>
have to work with this guy every day.<br/>
 I have a little more of a desire to beat him since he just happens to be my<br/>
supervisor, too!!!    :)<br/>
<br/>
I thank you all in advance for your input.<br/>
