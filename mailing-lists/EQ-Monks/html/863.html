&lt;&lt;  The only class that CAN&#39;T Solo all the way to 50 is a Wizard. <br/>
 However, with that said, only Shamans, Druids (less so with Kiting <br/>
 curtailed), Monks, Necromancers, and Shadow Knights can do it effectively.  <br/>

at certain points along the path. In the 40&#39;s, few mobs give good exp that a <br/>
monk can solo effectively. Even with great equipment (including a haste <br/>
sash), anything beyond very low blues are a big risk. Further, lack of <br/>
ability to root makes soloing very problematic in dungeons -- especially if <br/>
the mob has SoW. I&#39;m not saying it can&#39;t be done, but I wouldn&#39;t want to try <br/>
it. As a monk, sticking in groups seems far faster, in my experience. (Can&#39;t <br/>
say the same about my shaman...)</div>
