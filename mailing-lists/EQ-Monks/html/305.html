<div id="ygrps-yiv-1825005692">I think this plan smacks of &quot;Unrecoverable corpse&quot;.    I have a level 35<br/>
character and would not dare try this.  Bear in mind that at levle 7 guard<br/>
s will kill you in one hit - they hit for  upwards of 100 dmge and double<br/>
attack almost every time.<br/>

&gt; Actually you can be bound in grobb and its not that hard to do!!!<br/>
&gt; You have two options both of which I have done. First you have to sneak past <br/>
&gt; the guards to get into the pass! I have had no problems at level 12 sneaking <br/>
&gt; past them out fo the water up the right side of the mountain, dont go <br/>
&gt; straight through them. Or just have a magic user cast invisible on you (no <br/>
&gt; the guards cant see invisible). Once inside the tunnel you have two choices<br/>
&gt; 1.) Have a troll who can bind you go into grobb nad make sure that basher <br/>
&gt; the guard isnt there, zone in ,bind, and get the hell out!<br/>
&gt; 2.) Im not sure if invisible lasts across zones or while binding but head in <br/>
&gt; and try that!<br/>
&gt; KEY--- make sure you bind right when you step into grobba nd turn to face <br/>
&gt; the exit! When you die and basher is there you only have a plsit second, so <br/>
&gt; if you are even 4 steps from the door and have to make a 180 you are <br/>
&gt; screwed! You need to be facing the exit and one step away.<br/>
&gt; I have done this twice and had no problem. ALso when you sneak out I always <br/>
&gt; go left up the monutain and out into the water giving the left guard a <br/>
&gt; little berth.  Byt his method I have never had a problem gtetting out of <br/>
&gt; Grobb. except the one time wehn i would zone into the swamp and it would put <br/>
&gt; be 10 feet deep into grobb. I would run and jump to zone out and appear 10 <br/>
&gt; feet deep into grobb, very strange but that happened only once in many <br/>
&gt; times! Ya i die alot in gukk.<br/>
