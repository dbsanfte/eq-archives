<b>Subject:</b> MESH / NETTED ARMOUR <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-799650772">Do I have to live in the game just to get mesh or netted armour? I have been <br/>
trying to find some ever since I got to level 8 (now I&#39;m level 11) and still <br/>
have not found anything other than a mesh collar (whoop te do) What&#39;s up <br/>
with mesh? Why is there not enough of it? Must it be made or does it spawn <br/>
on certain NPC&#39;s? I&#39;m wondering why I never see any vendors carry any mesh <br/>
items. Perhaps this is something I need to take up with Verant?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
