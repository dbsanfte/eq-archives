<div id="ygrps-yiv-1193197398">Speaking from my own personal experience, it is not possible to solo a<br/>
wizard unless he has jboots or sow.<br/>
<br/>
The root line of spells can not be used to solo.  They are very unreliable<br/>
and creatures have high resists rate. This was the fact before the changes<br/>
to the root line of spells.<br/>
<br/>
I have not soloed my wizard since 12 level.  The times you see a wizard root<br/>
and nuke a creature without the creature breaking free is a rare occurrence.<br/>
This is because a creature gets a chance to break free when the spell is<br/>
cast, and whenever it takes damage.  The root line of spells also get a<br/>
random length of duration.<br/>
<br/>
The problem with using root is that once the creature breaks free, it will<br/>
be pounding on you faster than you can cast any DD spells. For this reason<br/>
most solo wizards will lure creatures to the zone line in.<br/>

&gt; Whoever said wizzie can&#39;t solo their way to 50 is sadly mistaken. They can<br/>
do<br/>
&gt; it a lot easier than us monks, it&#39;s called root.  I&#39;ve seen it many times.<br/>
&gt; But on the main point of this lil rant, soloing sucks.  In more than one<br/>
way.<br/>
&gt;  First, it&#39;s boring as hell, you&#39;re all alone with nobody to talk to.<br/>
&gt; Second, it&#39;s dangerous, you&#39;re in trouble if more than you can handle<br/>
comes<br/>
&gt; along, and when you&#39;re soloing, that&#39;s normally more than one mob, which<br/>
&gt; happens at the worst times.  Third, you don&#39;t get half of what was<br/>
designed<br/>
&gt; for this game, a massive MULTIPLAYER game,  that&#39;s what everybody is there<br/>
&gt; for, to make friends, interact and have fun together, in groups.  Fourth,<br/>
&gt; when you do make lvl 50, you&#39;ll want good equipment, and for that, you<br/>
need<br/>
&gt; to group.  Well, from personal experience, I really dislike ppl that have<br/>
&gt; soloed their way up the lvls because they have no clue how to use their<br/>
char<br/>
&gt; in a group.  And it is grossly obvious when a person has done that, I<br/>
simply<br/>
&gt; won&#39;t group with them again.  You NEED to group with ppl to help you out<br/>
&gt; later on, the &#39;I scratch your back, you scratch mine&#39; deal.  Don&#39;t get me<br/>
&gt; wrong, once you&#39;ve climbed that ladder it&#39;s fun to go see what you can do<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; your own, but soloing the whole way does not pay off in the long run.<br/>
Just<br/>
&gt; about all the high lvl ppl I know agree with me on this subject and don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; like to group with solos.  Well, I&#39;m done bitchin about soloists.<br/>
