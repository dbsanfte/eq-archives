<div id="ygrps-yiv-1224663688">Bards are extremely powerful, if they know what they are doing. Most dont.<br/>
One of my characters is a 20th lvl bard. My friend plays a 20th lvl<br/>
paladin. We dueled in arena the other night and at the end of the fight I<br/>
was at full health. This was even after he used hands. He also blinded me<br/>
and ran off and hid someplace and healed himself back to full a second<br/>
time. It didn&#39;t save him. And yes, we stood toe to toe (except when he<br/>
ran hehe) <br/>
<br/>
In any case, I find this whole thread of monks being master pullers<br/>
discouraging. Is this all they are good for at high levels? Is pulling the<br/>
only reason they are sought out for groups? Because that hardly sounds<br/>
like a fun way to spend time. I play a monk now because I dont have the<br/>
patients for long camps. Pulling things for other people to blast doesnt<br/>
sound much better :(  Surely there are other things to look forward to as<br/>
a high level monk?<br/>

&gt; &gt;Ever wonder why parties always want a monk to pull? Because the Monk IS the<br/>
&gt; &gt;best puler in the game Bar none.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;          Once again, I am going to have to disagree. The Monk is the 2nd <br/>
&gt; best puller in the game. The best puller is one that no one has mentioned <br/>
&gt; yet: The Bard. The reason the Bard is the best puller is because of Kelin`s <br/>
&gt; Lugubrious Lament (Lull), Kelin`s Lucid Lullaby (AoE Lull), and Selo&#39;s <br/>
&gt; Accelerando. Bards can use the spells to pull EXACTLY one Mob and then <br/>
&gt; hightail it back to the group. If they do pull more they can use Kelin&#39;s <br/>
&gt; Lullaby to keep them occupied or just haul ass to zone. All in all, if you <br/>
&gt; have a Bard that knows what he is doing, they are the best pullers.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;          However, that all said and done, most Bards are not as adept at <br/>
&gt; pulling as Monks are. Monks start honing their pulling skills early on. <br/>
&gt; Bards, for the most part, never really work on pulling. So, given the same <br/>
&gt; skill level and knowledge, a Bard is a better class for pulling. I still <br/>
&gt; like a Monk because of the damage they deal. Bard songs are invaluable at <br/>
&gt; higher levels though. I would choose a Bard (that knows what they are <br/>
&gt; doing) over a Shaman/Druid/Paladin/Ranger if possible.<br/>
