<div id="ygrps-yiv-512262859">As many of you have said, some of the camping times for the Quests<br/>
these days are rediculous, dozens of hours just sitting by the<br/>
computer, but what about those of us who have to PAY for it. I mean<br/>
over here we pay for the price of a local phone call, every minute<br/>
we&#39;re online. You guys have a flat rate fee a lot of you don&#39;t you?<br/>
well I have to pay A LOT of money to just play EQ, let alone camp<br/>
stuff. My phone bil is about $250 a month and it&#39;s not cool, so<br/>
camping for these itmes is something pretty much impossible for me,<br/>
when are Verant going to realise this and change quests so they can<br/>
be completed in a lot of very small bits?<br/>
<br/>
And also when are they going to have some GM&#39;s deal with people who<br/>
play from Europe lie me? I mean I hate to log on at 3 in the mourning<br/>
just to petition a GM for a name chnge which he never showed up for!<br/>
They should be bothered to employ just a COUPLE in Europe to help us<br/>
with our problems.</div>
