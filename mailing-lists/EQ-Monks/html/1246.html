<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1515262048">Okay the cube is nowhere near there but on the same lvl<br/>
okay you rember how you come down the ramp go through that first door then<br/>
the second door<br/>
then theres the guards you go around them to head to kings room well this<br/>
time<br/>
you don&#39;t go into that next door but take a right and you will see water and<br/>
path following the way on both sides<br/>
you follow the path by taking a left and you go all the way till you come to<br/>
some tables and such and you will see a star with<br/>
water in it and water around it you have to jump into the star and swim down<br/>
sometimes theres some kind of water goblin i forget<br/>
the name of it down there wasn&#39;t too much trouble for me lvl 30 monk<br/>
took me over 15 hours yesterday camping to finally get the goblin in<br/>
beholder luckly the one in misty spawned within an hour<br/>
good luck<br/>

&gt; Hi all I ned help.  I am trying to complete the TREATN fist quest. I have<br/>
&gt; all the ingredients except the cat skull cap form the gelatenous cube in<br/>
&gt; Running Eye.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am trying to find the exact location of the gelatenous cube in running<br/>
&gt; eye. If anyone here has any ideas as to whre it is (in relation to the<br/>
&gt; throne room an the captain spawn) please provide DETAILED explanation.<br/>
&gt; Everyone tells  me behind the throne room but I just  spent all night<br/>
&gt; killing everything I could find behind the throne room and I managed to<br/>
kill<br/>
&gt; two captains in the time that no cube has shown its face.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ok so as I enter the King  I face a door that leeads to the room where the<br/>
&gt; captain spawns ( one of the elite guards is the captains place holder)<br/>
Now<br/>
&gt; does the cube spawn in this &quot;captain room&quot; or  in the hall behind the door<br/>
&gt; in the back of this &quot;captain room&quot;?  Or is he even farther back?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If I am rambling excuse me but I just spent allnight on this damned quest<br/>
&gt; with no results... very frustrating....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
