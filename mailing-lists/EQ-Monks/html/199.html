<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-636895540">the type of person that plays a monk normally is complacent and optimistic.<br/>
even if we get screwed we just take it.. and try to reason that it&#39;s not all<br/>
that important.<br/>
<br/>
the type of person that plays a warrior is egotistic and power hungry.<br/>
if they see other classes runn&#39;n around out damaging them they whine and<br/>
bitch until they are the &quot;masters of melee combat.&quot;<br/>
well... that&#39;s cool and all but there are 2 other melee classes.<br/>
<br/>
there is a rogue.... before too long the rogue will be out damaging monks...<br/>
mark my words.<br/>
their poison will be effective along with thier back stabs.<br/>
i currently group with a lvl48 rogue who does a tremendous amount of dmg<br/>
with just backstabs (up to 160 with one hit.)<br/>
and i think personally that would be fine... because they can&#39;t take crap<br/>
for dmg.. they r even wimpier than monks.<br/>
however, they r rogues... their contribution is not suppose to be strictly<br/>
melee combat.<br/>
they r suppose to be contributing with find traps, picking locks, sneaking<br/>
and hiding to scout ahead.<br/>
granted the implementation of these skills sucks.<br/>
but one day they will be fairly implemented to make rogues a valuable<br/>
contribution to a group besides melee dmg.<br/>
<br/>
and there is a monk.... hmm... what contribution do monks have for a group?<br/>
well... i&#39;ll tell ya what ppl think when they r considering inviting a monk<br/>
into a group.<br/>
if it&#39;s casters starting the group they r gonna make sure they have a tank<br/>
1st... one that can taunt.<br/>
then they r thinking that since they have a tank it would probably be better<br/>
to have another that can do more melee dmg as a back up.<br/>
<br/>
now consider that warriors can do just as much dmg as monks or @least almost<br/>
as much.<br/>
hmm... now the casters can have a back up taunter just in case more than one<br/>
mob is aggro on the casters.<br/>
and they still don&#39;t loose much in dmg melee wise... hmm<br/>
i know if i was a cleric i would rather have 2 taunters just in case.<br/>
and if they r fighting casters... ohh yeah.. 2 warriors would be a much<br/>
better option.<br/>
all i know is that green wizzies can kill me @lvl49... i don&#39;t even dare try<br/>
to solo them anymore.<br/>
i hardly ever interrupt them and i&#39;m almost dead after 2 or 3 casts...hmm.<br/>
and with 32 magic resist... i&#39;m a sitting duck when it comes to casters.<br/>
<br/>
feign death is great for solo stints and to let other party members run away<br/>
while u distract the mob... but monks can&#39;t solo past lvl45 and @lvl 50 and<br/>
if your smart in later lvls u don&#39;t fight far from the zone with out an<br/>
evacer in the group anyways.<br/>
<br/>
i guess what i&#39;m try&#39;n to do is give u guys a different perspective about<br/>
your class.<br/>
if u just keep saying everything is fine and i love my monk.<br/>
u will get severely surpassed by the other melee classes.<br/>
because believe me they r not stopping here.<br/>
in another month they will be whining about something else and another patch<br/>
will be implimented.<br/>
u watch... the next patch will set the warrior combat skills cap to 255...<br/>
which is now 200 btw.<br/>
and they will raise the skill cap for sneak from 118 to 255 for the monk...<br/>
just so we don&#39;t feel left out.<br/>
or possibly even make it to where r sashes show... ohh boy...))<br/>
<br/>
and whether u want to admit it or not... ppl do consider the effectiveness<br/>
of your class b4 inviting.<br/>
who wants sympathy invites anyways.. i wanta be invited not only because<br/>
they like me but because i round off the group.<br/>
a monks ONLY contribution over a warrior to a group is dmg.<br/>
past lvl 45 grouping is all that matters... cuz u can&#39;t do crap without a<br/>
group... besides maybe help out newbies.:)<br/>
<br/>
just watch what happens if we keep whining about newbie looks and missing<br/>
skills like instill doubt.<br/>
we will look cool doin fly&#39;n kicks with r sashes and all... but when it<br/>
comes to putting together groups to goto the fear plane... we will be like<br/>
the nerdy fat kid waiting to be picked.(no offense to all the nerdy fat kids<br/>
out there.)<br/>
btw, all guild sashes suck.. the only sash i will be wearing is the flowing<br/>
black sash.<br/>
<br/>
i hate to say it...<br/>
but if we don&#39;t whine and gripe like the others WE WILL GET LEFT BEHIND.<br/>
<br/>
sorry so long,<br/>
saihung of tunare<br/>

Well, I suppose we could start a petition and try to get some stuff<br/>
implemented -- the warriors were at a distinct disadvantage to us until the<br/>
patch. But, there&#39;s more going on then just basic skills -- it&#39;s in how you<br/>
play it. Someone else just posted that he&#39;s the last one out in a fight --<br/>
he gets his party moving, sticks behind, lets his group get away safely, and<br/>
feigns death. This is great and this is how I intend to play it, too.<br/>
Warriors need to be the masters of armed combat, just as we are the masters<br/>
of hand-to-hand. And we do have different roles -- we&#39;re not meant to be the<br/>
damage sponges. In a pinch, we suffice for that job, but it&#39;s not our<br/>
primary role. Our primary job is to be walking Damage Over Time weapons and<br/>
that we still do rather well. And, when the inevitable happens and we die,<br/>
who&#39;s in worse trouble -- us or a warrior? Take a warrior&#39;s weapons away,<br/>
and he&#39;s nothing. That cannot be said about us.<br/>
<br/>
Now, warrior tweaks: More hitpoints -- they need &#39;em -- they&#39;re going to get<br/>
hit more than us.<br/>
<br/>
Critical hit: For me, the jury&#39;s still out -- I&#39;d like to hear from<br/>
experience how it goes for a level 30 warrior compared to a level 30 monk as<br/>
far as damage done per round on average. Will a warrior consistently do more<br/>
damage than us? That&#39;s the real question.<br/>
<br/>
Magic Resistance: This one does cheese me off -- why are warriors so much<br/>
more deserving of magic resistance than any other melee class? This is an<br/>
unfair advantage, imho.<br/>
<br/>
Taunt would be a lovely skill to have, but maybe they could just make our<br/>
magical attacks act more like taunts. We&#39;re never, ever going to be able to<br/>
pull a mob off a caster who&#39;s done a full mana burn -- that&#39;s just the fact.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, I&#39;m still pleased with my monk and I don&#39;t think grouping will<br/>
be a problem because your friends aren&#39;t going to be that empiracal about<br/>
it -- be a good groupie and do your job and you will be loved and sought<br/>
after. I&#39;ve never once had anyone say &quot;Gee, Owyn, you&#39;re just a monk. We&#39;ve<br/>
got this great warrior to replace you. Sorry, bud.&quot;  Don&#39;t look at it<br/>
strictly as Class A is better than Class B -- If you want to solo as a monk<br/>
(or any other class) you&#39;re going to have a tougher go at it.  Just have fun<br/>
and when it&#39;s not fun any longer, try something else.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; My feelings are similar.  I have loved my monk more than any<br/>
&gt;of the other many classes I played from the moment I started him.  I<br/>
&gt;knew going in that I wouldn&#39;t be as good as a &#39;classic&#39; tank as would<br/>
&gt;be a warrior and wouldn&#39;t be able to match them in damage until at<br/>
&gt;least the upper 20&#39;s.  I didn&#39;t mind this so much and took a kind of<br/>
&gt;perverse pride in the fact that monks didn&#39;t &#39;mature&#39; until much<br/>
&gt;later - making them a labor of love and patience.  Well, I&#39;m finally<br/>
&gt;&#39;mature&#39; (meaning I&#39;ve hit 30 and now have Flying Kick), but it seems<br/>
&gt;that my hopes for being as valuable a contributor to my party as our<br/>
&gt;warrior have been undercut.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve always bemoaned the lack of Taunt, because I see it as<br/>
&gt;one of my primary callings in life - to protect others (especially<br/>
&gt;those who have dedicated themselves to the healing arts).  Without<br/>
&gt;such a tool, this has been extremely difficult.  I have consoled<br/>
&gt;myself with the knowledge that recently I had achieved a rough parity<br/>
&gt;with our warrior in terms of the ability to put down a creature who<br/>
&gt;had come up against our group.  We would split duties and assignments<br/>
&gt;as equals (except in those situations where our individual abilities<br/>
&gt;dictated otherwise).  Now this parity is no more.<br/>
&gt; I have no desire to see monks become a &#39;superclass&#39;... if<br/>
&gt;they were everybody would play them and how much fun would THAT be?<br/>
&gt;Nor am I looking for the ability to solo.  I vastly prefer group play<br/>
&gt;and find it to be much more rewarding on a number of levels.<br/>
&gt;Unfortunately, the benefits which can be brought to a group by monks<br/>
&gt;have been marginalized by the incredible adjustments made to the<br/>
&gt;warrior class.  I would just like to see some thought given to giving<br/>
&gt;monks a greater ability to contribute again, that&#39;s all.<br/>
