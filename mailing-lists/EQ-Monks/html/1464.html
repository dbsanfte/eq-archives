<b>Subject:</b> RE: [EQ-Monks] Goblin Alchemist <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-317076244">I hunted mino&#39;s in the gorge for a week hoping to run into the alchemist<br/>
while there.  No such luck.  <br/>
<br/>
What I was told when trying to learn more about him, was that the<br/>
placeholders spawn every 70 minutes.  As you come out of RE into the gorge,<br/>
there are three gobbies that spawn.  The two on the right are supposed to be<br/>
the place holders.  <br/>
<br/>
Some people have told me they just find the spawn cycle time, then leave and<br/>
return right before the next set spawns.  I always ck when I run thru the<br/>
gorge.  Maybe someday I&#39;ll get lucky and run into it.<br/>
<br/>
The gobbies there are pretty low level, low teens I think.  I would guess<br/>
the alchy will be in the high teens or very low twenties.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>
