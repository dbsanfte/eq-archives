&gt;<br/>
&gt;I recently joined the brotherhood of monks.<br/>
&gt;I am still an apprentice monk in dawn of my years with little experience<br/>
&gt;in battle (indeed with little proficiency in it) but I hope that this will<br/>
&gt;change in the next few weeks.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Lastnight while conversing with a far more experienced monk than myself,<br/>
&gt;he mentioned a monk website to me that i was trying to check out today.<br/>
&gt;the URL was something like: www.kadamit.com/eqmonks<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;However when I try to go to the site, I realize that I have the URL<br/>
&gt;slightly wrong.  Do any of you know the correct URL.  Indeed do any of you<br/>
&gt;know of anyother websites with good information on MONKS?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;thank you.<br/>
