<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-931496718">I had heard that the black sash was a drop from the Master of the Ashen Order.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else heard that? What does the sash do, and what type of faction<br/>
crash does it involve?<br/>
<br/>
What would you do if you saw someone wearing the sash from your order?<br/>
