&gt;  &gt;You must bear in mind that at for any level, monks have higher DW<br/>
&gt;  &gt;and DA skills than all other groups (even warriors).  Thus we get more<br/>
&gt;  &gt;attacks than they do in an average round.<br/>
&gt;  &gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ya know, to be more realistic it might be said that our punches need to go <br/>
faster and possibly hit for a little less.  But anyone who has ever come up <br/>
against a damage sheilded opponent knows why at that time it sucks being a <br/>
monk lol.  Can you say Quadruple hit?  Hitting a damage sheild over and over <br/>
again while the mob is attacking you at the same time is a sure way to die <br/>
unless you just have more hit points.<br/>
<br/>
So i for one think its alright for the things to stay the way they are.  Im <br/>
for a move into the more superficial areas of improvement like the proposed <br/>
graphic headbands.<br/>
