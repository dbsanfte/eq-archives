<br/>
The alchemist in Misty is NOT in the closest camp to Runny Eye. When Runny<br/>
is behind you, it is the camp you see straight and to the right (south I<br/>
think). Only one tent there. 2 goblins spawn very quickly. And every 20<br/>
minutes, a third goblin spawns right inside the tent. It is NOT a one hour<br/>
and a half spawn. It can be a warrior, a shaman, Mooto most of the time, OR<br/>
the alchemist. This one will begin to wander by the other camps if you wait<br/>
too long, so don&#39;t wait to kill it.<br/>
That one took me 10, then 12, then 5 hours.<br/>
<br/>
The alchemist in the gorge is, indeed, very rare. But it is not a once a<br/>
week spawn. It can spawn twice in a day, and 2 or 3 times a week as far as I<br/>
know. I missed it 3 times for 5 minutes, I have been there for 5 server<br/>
reboot, but never got it that way. A server reboot is not an automatic<br/>
success. The spawn rate is NOT 2-4 hours. It is between 72 and 80 minutes.<br/>
Right in front of the fork by Runny Eye zone, you have 2 spots for goblins.<br/>
One to the left, and one at the middle. The middle spot is the correct spot.<br/>
There you have 2 goblin spawns AT THE EXACT SAME SPOT. One every 6 minutes,<br/>
and one every 72-80 minutes (the good one). I usually waited til I could see<br/>
both, then I killed them and I could time it precisely. Goblins at this spot<br/>
will wander a little, but they always come back. Their path is not very<br/>
long.<br/>
That one took me 180+ hours. But don&#39;t worry, it is usually something like<br/>
30 hours. I was just VERY unlucky.<br/>

1st point:<br/>
The alchemist in misty spawns at teh goblin camp closest to the running eye<br/>
zone.  ordinarily there are 2 goblins at this camp, but ever hour and a half<br/>
or<br/>
so a 3rd goblibn pops - either Mooto or the alchemist.  Mooto and the<br/>
alchemist<br/>
are the only ones you need to kill.  But somepeople kill the other two to<br/>
pass<br/>
the time.  <br/>
<br/>
NOTE: this is the easier of the two alchemists to get.  The one in the gorge<br/>
is<br/>
*VERY* rare.  If I were you I would take advantage of the server reset and<br/>
head<br/>
to the GOrge as soon as you wake up!  The misty thicket alchemist will pop<br/>
about<br/>
once every 2-4 hours.  The one in the gorge is rumored to be a once a week<br/>
guy....</div>
