<div id="ygrps-yiv-1099199281">Don&#39;t let one guy chase you out - every list has to have at least one like<br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
Just set up a kill filter like everyone else did, it makes you feel better,<br/>
and you still can get valuble information.<br/>

Oh how wrong you are.  You don&#39;t know me..you don&#39;t know my life you<br/>
don&#39;t know jack as far as I am concerned.  You are probably some stupid<br/>
college student who thinks that everyone has a life outside of the<br/>
game.  Some of us choose not to and you know what??? I am happy that<br/>
way.  I don&#39;t want to engage in the activities I did before EQ and you<br/>
know what else? its not your place to tell me or anyone else what they<br/>
should think or feel about EQ or to pass judgement on anyone for<br/>
thinking the way they do about EQ.  <br/>
<br/>
As for your post about that this was a list for information about<br/>
monks...blah blah blah...I don&#39;t think your orginal post had anything<br/>
to do with monks at all! In fact if it did, I would not have responded<br/>
with such anger. So who are you to be telling me what to post here when<br/>
you don&#39;t follow the rules yourself!<br/>
<br/>
Now...don&#39;t bother to reply.  I have gotten some advice from a few of<br/>
you and the rest have whined about this that and the other thing.  What<br/>
ever.  Welcome to the world of EQ. I got what I needed from those of<br/>
you who actually were kind enough to contribute to my questions and I<br/>
thank you for it. I think that there is probably nothing else worth<br/>
hearing on this list and so with that, I will be leaving the list...so<br/>
your flames won&#39;t be heard.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 9 months ago, at some date in the future, EQ will not exist.  I hope<br/>
&gt; you have a contingency plan ready, because EQ is not life, or a way<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; life, it is simply a game you enjoy together.  &gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; IF EQ was perfect, or something you&#39;ve been doing for tens of years<br/>
&gt; and nothing had ever changed on it, then you would have a much better<br/>
&gt; argument.  However we can clearly see that monks aren&#39;t being singled<br/>
&gt; out, almost every class is being tuned every month.  This one was<br/>
&gt; slightly major.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But enough is enough.  Shit happens and we adjust.  This mailing list<br/>
&gt; is not about these kinds of posts or this kind of thread. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The purpose of this list is to distribute information about Monks to<br/>
&gt; the players of EverQuest. Spoilers may be included so read at your<br/>
&gt; own risk. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The purpose of this list is NOT to be a vent for your fustration.<br/>
