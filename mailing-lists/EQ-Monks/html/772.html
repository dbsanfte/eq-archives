<div id="ygrps-yiv-1517735221">Ok, I was aiming to post a group for the high teens into the twenties.<br/>
My highest character is level 30, so I really don&#39;t know high level<br/>
group strategies.<br/>
<br/>
If we are to debates, lets debates about the same thing....what<br/>
is a good group for the 20s?  The bard doesn&#39;t have the mana song,<br/>
the cleric can&#39;t res, the enchanter doesn&#39;t have the mana regen <br/>
spell (until level 29). <br/>
<br/>
And since its near impossible to find the perfect group<br/>
How about we discuss groups that compliment well.  And since<br/>
this is the monk mailing list lets make sure the Monk is on it...<br/>
<br/>
I think someone posted that Monk/Shaman is a nice team for 2 person group.<br/>
<br/>
What about 3 or 4 or 5 or 6?<br/>
Personally, I think the bard with his attack speedup song can <br/>
compliment the Monk well, that is from experience with<br/>
bard/warrior teams though.  Warriors get crafted armor decently<br/>
through these levels, so they experience a jump in AC compared<br/>
to the monk/ranger/paladin/sk, right?  So if you can<br/>
find a warrior as your primary tank, the party will take a lot less<br/>
damage?  I know later on the monk catches up to the warrior in AC,<br/>
but not in the 20s.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, I&#39;m rambling now...if you guys want to discuss level 50 groups<br/>
don&#39;t do them when some of us are talking about level 20 groups..<br/>

&gt;  &gt; 1 - Monk<br/>
&gt;  &gt; 2 - Monk / Ranger / Paladin<br/>
&gt;  &gt; 3 - Enchanter<br/>
&gt;  &gt; 4 - Druid / Shaman<br/>
&gt;  &gt; 5 - Cleric<br/>
&gt;  &gt; 6 - Wizard / Magician<br/>
&gt;  &gt; <br/>
&gt;  Change 2 to Monk / Warrior.  In a group as diversified<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  as this, the spells they have are almost useless, and a warrior<br/>
&gt;  should be able to taunt the monsters better.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  Add a bard, replaces 5.  In a group of 5 or 6<br/>
&gt;  a bard is a far better healer than a cleric, and if needed in<br/>
&gt;  a pinch, the druid/shaman can do the quick healing.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  Maybe for lower levels, but a cleric is ESSENTIAL at high levels. Druids, <br/>
&gt; Shaman, and paladins pale in comparison to clerics at very high levels, in <br/>
&gt; terms of healing powers. They are a must!<br/>
