<div id="ygrps-yiv-736509358">HI everyone,<br/>
<br/>
Well I was looking around for decent monk equipment that<br/>
would be (relatively) cheap to get.  I found some jewellery that<br/>
is tough to beat<br/>
<br/>
Gold Topaz Earring AC3 +8vsDisease wt0.1<br/>
Gold Pearl Necklace AC5 +9vsPoison wt0.1<br/>
<br/>
The stones cost around 5pp each.  The bars would cost 10pp.<br/>
If you can assemble the materials and find a nice enchanter,<br/>
they might be willing to make these for you for very little.<br/>
They should end up costing you 30pp max.<br/>
<br/>
Short of the Diamondine Earrings (ac2 3agi 15hp), Obsidian<br/>
Hoops (ac2 3agi 3int) and Fishbone (waterbreathing),  these<br/>
earrings are probably the best there is.  I&#39;m switching out<br/>
of the amber ones I have now as soon as I can find a shop<br/>
that sells topaz.  Anyone know a shop??<br/>
<br/>
The necklace is pretty good if you can&#39;t find or afford a<br/>
Collar of Undead Protection.<br/>
<br/>
