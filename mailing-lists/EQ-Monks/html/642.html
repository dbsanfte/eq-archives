<b>Subject:</b> RE: Twinking thoughts <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-658068110">Just thought I&#39;d give my 2 coppers worth on twinking here.  I play a monk as my<br/>
secondary character and a cleric as my primary.  At higher levels, a caster<br/>
mainly sits and meditates, only standing to cast a spell, then sits right back<br/>
down and starts to meditate again.  This can get very repetitive, and some say<br/>
boring (I think it&#39;s fun!).<br/>
<br/>
About level 30 with my cleric, I started a Monk because I needed to group to be<br/>
effective as a cleric.  I wanted to see what I was missing and get the<br/>
satisfaction of beating the heck out of something with melee skills, not spells.<br/>
So, I go create a bind-as-a-bat human monk.  I go out to fight, then nighttime<br/>
falls- yikes!! I CAN&#39;T SEE!!!  That just wasn&#39;t very fun, so my cleric gave him<br/>
a greater lightstone.  Okay, so I go and kill some rats and bats, and decaying<br/>
skeletons- wow- flashback to my first day of EverQuest.  Hmmm... this is okay<br/>
for awhile- now my monk is level 4.<br/>
<br/>
I quickly got bored of being a monk because, truth to be told, I didn&#39;t want to<br/>
be a level 4 anymore.  I was used to killing Frogs in Upper and Lower Guk,<br/>
camping in Cazic or Najena, or venturing into Permafrost.  Well, I went back to<br/>
the cleric.  It&#39;s now more exciting to play my cleric because I know what the<br/>
other class went through (at least a little bit).  Cleric is now level 38 and<br/>
having some problems getting to 39.<br/>
<br/>
Back to the monk, but this time I tell myself, I&#39;ll help the monk along so he&#39;ll<br/>
be able to get to those places that I love so much and get to see what it&#39;s<br/>
really like to be another class.  So cleric gives him some woven armor, some<br/>
medium jewelry (cleric is maxed with high level jewelry), and the monk is off to<br/>
fight.  The monk is now a killing machine- taking on white and yellow cons- this<br/>
rocks!  Then I reach level 8, back to blues as even the evens cons are whipping<br/>
my butt.  Well, I continue to fight and since I never really got to explore<br/>
Black Burrow, I&#39;m having a blast there.  Now my monk is level 12.<br/>
<br/>
Back to the Cleric, but now I&#39;m watching out for items I can give to my monk.  I<br/>
made a trade here and there, loot some items that no one else in my group needs,<br/>
and before I know it- I&#39;ve got a complete set of level 30 or so monk gear with a<br/>
few odd pieces into the 40s.  My cleric is now level 43 and I have a blast<br/>
playing him.  I can&#39;t wait until I get to 44 with my new spells.  I know that<br/>
there will be times when my level 18 (now) monk will be pulled out of the hamper<br/>
to give him some more experience, but my primary character will be my cleric.<br/>
<br/>
I think all of the characters I create, if any, should benefit from the time<br/>
I&#39;ve put into the game.  I do not tweak other players, or like the fact that<br/>
some players buy their character or gear, but it really does not effect they way<br/>
I play my character if they do.  And if anyone objects to a level 15 Warrior in<br/>
full crafted armor or a level 20 ranger in full rubicite, it&#39;s not any skin off<br/>
my back (those characters are not mine, but friends of mine who did what I did).</div>
