&gt; The reason it&#39;s not workin for ya in lower guk is because of your lvl.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m <br/>
&gt; gonna guess that most mobs in upper guk are green for you, or close to<br/>
&gt; it.  <br/>
&gt; When you are above the lvl of the mob by a certain amount, then you<br/>
&gt; won&#39;t <br/>
&gt; always pull all of them if don&#39;t see you.  At lvl 50, I can pull<br/>
&gt; single <br/>
&gt; solusek kobolds because some are green, and even when they are low<br/>
&gt; blue, most <br/>
&gt; every time, I can just stand and wait for one to see me, then yell and<br/>
&gt; run at <br/>
&gt; me, but the other won&#39;t come because I&#39;m too high lvl for them.  So<br/>
&gt; this is <br/>
&gt; why your throwing a star or knife at them works on easier mobs, but<br/>
&gt; not on <br/>
&gt; the harder ones.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The thing you mention is another interesting method of pulling, when the<br/>
mobs are all green.  If i&#39;m in upper guk nowadays (level 41), I do<br/>
something different to separate groups that are all green.  Even though<br/>
they are green to me, if i stand next to anything tougher than a gaz<br/>
knight, the mob will attack me within a few seconds.  However, it will<br/>
not train others that it runs past as it&#39;s comming to me, like they do<br/>
if they are blue.  So, I get just close enough to one, so it will<br/>
attack, but just far enough so the others dont.  Or, just throw a star<br/>
at any of them from a longer range, and it will come alone.  <br/>
<br/>
However, what i was talking about doing with using a star to pull from a<br/>
group after they have all aggro&#39;d on me definitely worked on everything,<br/>
including blues, yellows, and reds.  I used the technique to level<br/>
myself and my regular group from 17 to 33 or so in upper guk.  Like i<br/>
said though, it doesnt work at all in lower guk as far as I can tell.<br/>
The difference is either some kind of effect of the different mobs<br/>
involved, or the fact that since I used the technique months ago, there<br/>
has been some kind of patch or change to the way all mobs react.</div>
