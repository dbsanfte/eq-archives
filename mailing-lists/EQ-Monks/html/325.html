<div id="ygrps-yiv-61883861">Hail and well met! I am indeed on the Erollisi Marr<br/>
server. And yes, Brother Monel has become my friend. I<br/>
just spoke to him yesterday. I am a friend to all<br/>
monks (until they prove unworthy. I posted about a<br/>
greedy brother a while ago) and especially those who<br/>
would travel with an acquiantance of mine. Merely send<br/>
me a tell and I will help you in any way that I can.<br/>
<br/>
Good journeys and may Truth guide you,<br/>
