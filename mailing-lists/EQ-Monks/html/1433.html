<div id="ygrps-yiv-1066729836">Many options here....<br/>
<br/>
17-20 can be a Mistmoore affair, staying in the CY<br/>
20-35 can easily be done in Cazic (I&#39;m 37 and still get exp at the AoF or<br/>
Tae)<br/>
30-35 you could also try the fairies in Lesser - I teamed up with a warrior<br/>
and we cleaned house.  The only &quot;campers&quot; we got were newbie magicians<br/>
needing something the fairie guards dropped.<br/>
<br/>
You may complain these are both camped but nothing like I&#39;ve seen SK get<br/>
between gnolls and aviaks - some nights it looks like Greater Faydark, over<br/>
100 people and /ooc & /shout spamming, at least on Quellious.<br/>
<br/>
And Highkeep is so.... small.  Plus, the KSing that runs rampant in HH pass<br/>
seems to leak in to the hold the few times I was there.  The only good thing<br/>
- guards and bank are just upstairs.<br/>
<br/>
Also, for the bold and brave...  Get a group up and you can hunt inside the<br/>
cave in Feerot, I gained 3 bubbles of experience killing spectres and<br/>
Cindrella in about 4 hours last night (At level 36)  Cindrella has a nasty<br/>
DOT but we used the /duel trick to circumvent any experience loss. (The DOT<br/>
does about 600 damage in 1 minute).  But if the specs don&#39;t con blue to your<br/>
entire party, I would advise against this route.  It&#39;s a nice place if you<br/>
can get in there - the word is out more and more about it, but only one<br/>
group showed up the entire time.<br/>
<br/>
I know this started as a solo list...  But the exp and fun I can have in a<br/>
good group far outweighs anything I can do solo.  If I wanted to solo, I&#39;d<br/>
play Ultima Online.<br/>

Here has been my hunting so far, when I find a place I like I tend to<br/>
stay there!<br/>
<br/>
1-4		West Freeport<br/>
4-6		North Ro (Beetles around Inn)<br/>
7-10		North Ro (Spiders and Snakes)<br/>
10-14		East/West Commons (Orcs and Dervs)<br/>
14-17		Oasis (Crocs and Orcs)<br/>
17-20		East Karana (Gnolls)<br/>
20-25		South Karana (Aviaks and Gnolls)<br/>
25-30		High Keep<br/>
30-32		Solusek&#39;s Eye A<br/>
<br/>
I will probably be staying in SolA until at least 35<br/>
<br/>
High Keep rules at 25 because a bank is so close, gets old quickly<br/>
though<br/>
