<b>Subject:</b> Re: [EQ-Monks] Goblin Alchemist <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-309793017">I just finished the quest a couple weeks ago.  The alchemist in Misty<br/>
Thicket, and the goblin captain and gelatinous cube in RunnyEye were all<br/>
pretty easy.  I killed Mooto and the other placeholders about 9 times or so<br/>
before the alchemist spawned in Misty.  Tsin (also on this list) pulled the<br/>
goblin captain and cube to the zone for me in Runny, so that only took about<br/>
15 mins. hehe.<br/>
<br/>
BUT.. the alchemist in Beholder took me 48 hours to get.  I *think* that it<br/>
may NOT spawn if you are in the zone for a long time however.. a few monks<br/>
I&#39;ve talked to said he spawned within a half hour of them entering the<br/>
zone.. but previous to that, on other occasions, they had been in the zone<br/>
for hours and hours.. one even camped it for 40 hours straight (did it in<br/>
shifts with someone else).  I got him after being in the zone for about 10<br/>
mins, finally.<br/>
<br/>
If you hate camping, don&#39;t do the quest.  The gloves aren&#39;t all that great.<br/>
I did the quest just to say I&#39;d done the quest.<br/>

&gt; Ok I think it&#39;s about time for me to hunt the goblin alchemistr in<br/>
&gt; beholder and do the treant fists quest. ANY information on the quest<br/>
&gt; at all, spawn rates, lvl&#39;s what they drop and where as well as<br/>
&gt; anything you think would help me is much appreciated, thanks alot.<br/>
