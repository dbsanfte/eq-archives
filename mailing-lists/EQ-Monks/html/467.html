<div id="ygrps-yiv-1847087937">I for one like the current damage we do. I don&#39;t think we should be<br/>
out-damaging a warrior swinging a big 2h weapon or dual wielding, and I<br/>
don&#39;t want to. They have the ac and the hp to protect them from those 50+<br/>
damage blows that would chew us up in very little time. I have always been<br/>
of the belief that the monk is NOT a tank. Our armor limitations prevent us<br/>
from acting like one. With one MoB, we are fine as Dodge and Block will<br/>
serve us well, but if we get hit, we get hit HARD. With 2 or more MoB&#39;s, our<br/>
Dodge and Block skill will not serve us nearly as well. We are more like an<br/>
animated DoT spell, inflicting a steady amount of damage throughout the<br/>
duration of a fight. Few people can dish out the damage we can yet remain<br/>
relatively unmolested. A drawback is it is very difficult to pull a MoB off<br/>
a party member who is in trouble, and perhaps I would enjoy having a Taunt<br/>
skill (no I don&#39;t think it is built into our special attacks), but I for one<br/>
think the Monk class on the whole is doing just fine.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt;  Lots of good points brought up in this discussion. <br/>
&gt;  I agree completely that we should get some kind of stunning attack, and<br/>
&gt; that <br/>
&gt; our delay should beat most, if not all, weapons. As a very well-equipped<br/>
&gt; monk <br/>
&gt; at lvl 40, I am routinely outdamaged by Ogre and Troll warriors, to say <br/>
&gt; nothing of casters. So, though we have some unique abilities, monks could <br/>
&gt; certainly stand some improvement. On my server, monks are sought primarily<br/>
&gt; as <br/>
&gt; pullers rather than combatants, b/c of Feign pulling...<br/>
&gt;  But until we get organized, and talk to Verant in some organized manner,<br/>
&gt; we <br/>
&gt; will get very little...<br/>
