<div id="ygrps-yiv-749706890">I didnt notice a big problem with weight until  Ihit 12.  then the<br/>
difference between 14 and 15 ment the difference between loosing 1 bubble<br/>
during a fight, and running for my life.<br/>
<br/>
I kept my guild tunic, and picked up a couple peices of cloth.  by 10, get<br/>
yourself some netted gloves.  once you can hunt wisps, you can start<br/>
building up a collection of mesh (money becomes very unimportant once you<br/>
can hunt wisps).<br/>
