<div id="ygrps-yiv-615866194">Your experience seems to be fairly common for monks who are<br/>
near the point of getting mend to 100.  It has never failed for me in<br/>
the countless times I&#39;ve used it past 19th level but failed a LOT at<br/>
17th-18th level.<br/>

Of the monks that I know, it seems that I have the worst luck at getting my<br/>
Mend skill to work, especially in high risk combat situations.  I have<br/>
maxed out the skill at 17th level.  This is not an exaggeration.  Yesterday<br/>
I was soloing scarecrows in West Karana.  I was earning a little Xp and<br/>
practicing my newly aquired FD skill, which did work,  I used mend 4 times<br/>
in about a 2 hour period of time.  It worked once, failed twice, and<br/>
worsened my wounds the last time, which killed me when I had a white<br/>
scarecrow on its last legs.  My character basically committed suicide at<br/>
the point where he was going to win.  As I said, it seems I have the worse<br/>
luck with Mend.  Does any one else have this problem or am I just the<br/>
victim of bad numbers?<br/>
