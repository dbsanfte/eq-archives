<div id="ygrps-yiv-622736641">Hrmm..well, he does have a point.  I was rather difficult to even understand<br/>
your message without several reads.  Would it be so difficult to format it<br/>
in a way that is clear to everyone?  Considering that you are asking for<br/>
information, you&#39;d think that you be a little more clear in your method of<br/>
speech.<br/>
<br/>
I shall endeavor to answer it as best I can.<br/>
<br/>
First paragraph: No clue what you are talking about, though I think it might<br/>
have something to do with a football game on Nintendo, Sega or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
1.) Your weight info is off.  The Lockjaw Vest, as I recall, weighs 1.5.<br/>
The Cured Silk weighs 0.1.  The difference in coinage is about 55 coins of<br/>
any type.  Since EQ uses a bracketing system, even 4 AC makes a difference<br/>
and +5 Stamina means more hit points, depending on your current stamina and<br/>
level.<br/>
<br/>
2.) Don&#39;t know what I BOBS is, but I assume BOE means Bracer of Erollisi.<br/>
Yes, Lore means you can only own one.  With the upgrade of the Bracer of<br/>
Erollisi, I feel it&#39;s worth it for the extra 0.9 weight.  I supose BOBS<br/>
could refer to Bracer of Battle (S?).  If so, then I don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth<br/>
the hassle of aquiring it.<br/>
<br/>
3.) Reconsider Mistmoore.  Orc Highway - what are you talking about?  Maze -<br/>
Do you mean The Gorge of King Grobb?  If so, it&#39;s a bit slow, but still<br/>
okay.  You really shouldn&#39;t have to contend with lawn trash in Unrest at<br/>
that level.  Also, consider Runnyeye, East Karana, South Karana, Rathe<br/>
Mountains, Cazic Thule, Permafrost and Upper Guk.<br/>
<br/>
Assume &quot;pimping&quot; means what level should you consider adventuring there.<br/>
Cazic - 20, Sol A - 25, Sol B - 35.<br/>

&gt; Hmmmm and exactly what is your problem?  Are you upset <br/>
&gt; because I didn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; proof read my e-mail like a college english paper? I am sorry <br/>
&gt; you took <br/>
&gt; offense to my e-mail though I do understand it is easy to <br/>
&gt; &quot;act&quot; tough in <br/>
&gt; e-mail. Ill just attribute your rant to juvenile behavior. <br/>
&gt; Sorry about the <br/>
&gt; FSU thing.<br/>
