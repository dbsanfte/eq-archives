<div id="ygrps-yiv-1353249377">Well, if you really think about it, it is possiblef or someone to poke a lot<br/>
faster then a person can punch.  If you consider since monks have to put<br/>
some strength into the punch, their speed can&#39;t be too fast.  But on the<br/>
other hand, warrior types can upgrade their weapons, in both damage and<br/>
speed, monks only get upgrades in damage, i&#39;d like to see us get a speed<br/>
upgrade too.  Because if a person wields a pain bringer and a ykesha, they<br/>
will easily outdamage a monk, because both of the weapons are sub 30 delay,<br/>
pain bringer is closer to 20.  Nonetheless, monks are supposed to be the<br/>
ultimate melee dishers, that makes up for the extreme hp loss.<br/>
