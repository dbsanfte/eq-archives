<div id="ygrps-yiv-1462833062">its amazing how bent some of you get over spending 34 cents a day on a <br/>
game... hell i loose more change then that over the course of one day... <br/>
play the game or dont play the game, nobody cares... and by the way, &quot;shit <br/>
happens and we adjust&quot; is very logial and, furthermore, one of the most <br/>
widely accepted scientific theories (really about the only theory) on why <br/>
there are so many different forms of life on this little plant� it&#39;s really <br/>
about the only way anyone can be a success in life.  If one cant live by the <br/>
motto, �shit happens and we adjust� you will be going they way of the <br/>
dinosaur before too long�<br/>

&gt;     Hmm. &quot;Shit happens and we adjust&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    I don&#39;t see that as being very logical<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    Verant is giving us bullshit and we are paying them for it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     And this is a game.  &quot;Shit&quot; shouldn&#39;t happen and you shouldn&#39;t have to<br/>
&gt;&quot;Adjust&quot; (I.E. Sitting back timidly and watching your enjoyment being<br/>
&gt;lessened and doing nothign about it but scowling occaisionally at the ones<br/>
&gt;responsible).  It should be enjoyed.  But, I know it is addictive.  Verant<br/>
&gt;COUNTS on the fact that they can screw over this game to their vision of an<br/>
&gt;ideal game and keep you playing at the same time, only because you are too<br/>
&gt;addicted to do more then complain and bitch and put down other complainers<br/>
&gt;and bitchers.  I&#39;ve quit EQ, but I can&#39;t help look at all this and laugh.<br/>
&gt;It&#39;s funny.  Seriously.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     I don&#39;t like playing a game where I have to do any MAJOR <br/>
&gt;&quot;Adjustments&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    Hell, Origin&#39;s only fault, and their fatal fault, was the fact that <br/>
&gt;they<br/>
&gt;screwed their customers over individually with corrupt game masters and<br/>
&gt;peice-a-crap customer support.  But they never mauled their game as <br/>
&gt;terribly<br/>
&gt;as Verant is doing to EQ.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    I would still love this game and play it if it werent for some of the<br/>
&gt;things they&#39;ve done.  But I can&#39;t do anything about it but leave.  Im not<br/>
&gt;letting them have my 10$ a month, and if some of you are so beat up about<br/>
&gt;this game, seriously, take a look at the broad range of where it&#39;s heading<br/>
&gt;and whats happening to it.  Do you see a pattern in the &quot;Tunings&quot; verant is<br/>
&gt;making?  Take a big broad look at it all, and say to yourself &quot;Do I still<br/>
&gt;like this game?&quot;  &quot;Is it still worth it?&quot;  &quot;Should I support this company<br/>
&gt;with my money any longer?&quot;  If you do still like it, I congratulate you:<br/>
&gt;You&#39;re damn good at taking huge amounts of shit from others to try to enjoy<br/>
&gt;something.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     Your decisions are your own, but sometimes it&#39;s good to take a good <br/>
&gt;step<br/>
&gt;back and look at the big picture, and take a look where it&#39;s going, and<br/>
&gt;decide whether you want to go the same way or not.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I agree with one thing though, that if some of you people seriously <br/>
&gt;think<br/>
&gt;of Everwhack as more than a game... You should see some help, or something<br/>
&gt;like that.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Brother, Neighbor, college friend, someone in pasadina you don&#39;t even<br/>
&gt; &gt; know... Its a game.  You happen to play with your brother, that&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; wonderful, however EQ is still a game.  For you, the ability to<br/>
&gt; &gt; play a game together means you can spend time together.  That<br/>
&gt; &gt; is wonderful.  This doesn&#39;t make EQ more than a game.  EQ didn&#39;t exist<br/>
&gt; &gt; 9 months ago, at some date in the future, EQ will not exist.  I hope<br/>
&gt; &gt; you have a contingency plan ready, because EQ is not life, or a way of<br/>
&gt; &gt; life, it is simply a game you enjoy together.  Joke all you want that<br/>
&gt; &gt; it is life, fine, no problem.  But when you read a post where someone<br/>
&gt; &gt; seriously thinks it is more than a game.  Please step back from it<br/>
&gt; &gt; and think about it.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; IF EQ was perfect, or something you&#39;ve been doing for tens of years<br/>
&gt; &gt; and nothing had ever changed on it, then you would have a much better<br/>
&gt; &gt; argument.  However we can clearly see that monks aren&#39;t being singled<br/>
&gt; &gt; out, almost every class is being tuned every month.  This one was<br/>
&gt; &gt; slightly major.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; But enough is enough.  Shit happens and we adjust.  This mailing list<br/>
&gt; &gt; is not about these kinds of posts or this kind of thread.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The purpose of this list is to distribute information about Monks to the<br/>
&gt;players of EverQuest. Spoilers may be included so read at your own risk.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The purpose of this list is NOT to be a vent for your fustration.<br/>
