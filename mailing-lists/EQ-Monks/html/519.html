&lt;&lt; Actually yes, that is quite possible... since the fact that ice comet takes<br/>
 so long to cast, monks have plenty of time to pummel in a good 500-700 dmg,<br/>
 which very easily could be more then half of the MoBs HP therefore giving<br/>
 him the kill instead of the wizzie woh just just wasted a 900 mana spell... <br/>

 </span></blockquote> I don&#39;t know how often lvl 49 Wizards and 46 monks are fighting mobs with <br/>
1000-1400 hp&#39;s on your server, but in my exp, doesn&#39;t happen much.<br/>
 When i party with my guild in lower guk, we often take two parties to do the <br/>
Ghoul Lord. We try to be somewhat egalitarian about the distribution of kills <br/>
between the two parties. So when one party is getting less kills, their <br/>
wizard will send out a few ice comets, and they get the kills -- monk or <br/>
melee classes in the other party seem quite irrelevant.</div>
