<div id="ygrps-yiv-1141082535">Well, I&#39;ve been on a big armor-upgrade kick lately, when it<br/>
occurred to me that I am still walking around in the same ol&#39; footwear that<br/>
I&#39;ve had since... well, forever.  It&#39;s like walking around in the beat up<br/>
blue Keds you had back in 2nd grade.  Seeing as there is no &#39;mesh boots&#39; or<br/>
anything of that ilk, I was wondering what was out there that was<br/>
monk-friendly (i.e. low weight).  AC is obviouly desireable, although<br/>
anything that could offer other bonuses (stat increase, resistances, etc.)<br/>
would be wonderful.<br/>
	Suggestions, advices, personal experiences appreciated...<br/>
