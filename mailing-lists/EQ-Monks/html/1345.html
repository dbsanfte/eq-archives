<b>Subject:</b> RE: Experience and Twinking <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-133871908">This is the great debate once every few months - twinking.  From my point of<br/>
view (As a level 36 monk) I see two directions to this argument.  Direction<br/>
1:  Lower level characters that have scrapped and fought and saved for weeks<br/>
to buy equipment, seeing a level 5 wizard strutting around with a SMR and<br/>
such....    <br/>
Direction 2: Higher level characters that have to put up with greedy members<br/>
of group and guild and others, that are farming and camping for items for<br/>
&quot;their twink&quot;   Examples of this have been given out in this list over and<br/>
over, so I won&#39;t regurgitate them.  Make no mistake, there are people out<br/>
there that would never be selfish or greedy - I know a few that if they win<br/>
an item they don&#39;t need, they turn around and give it to one that does.  All<br/>
the arguments are the same as well.  I&#39;m not advocating one position or the<br/>
other - just stating some observations.<br/>
<br/>
If a level 50 character wants to twink a newbie with equipment, then fine by<br/>
me.  His newbie or someone elses.  This is stuff he / she got (fairly or<br/>
unfairly).  It&#39;s not like they get to go to the Magic Well and pull this<br/>
stuff out of thin air.  They camped for it.<br/>
<br/>
So Twinkers aren&#39;t really a problem.  Really they aren&#39;t.  Game balance and<br/>
all that, they&#39;re not hurting anyone.  It&#39;s the methods behind getting the<br/>
equipment that I think is suspect.<br/>
<br/>
I used to be the lower level monk screaming that twinking was unfair.  But<br/>
for many people, it&#39;s about the only way to keep the game interesting.  Now<br/>
that I&#39;m a little higher level, I get mad at people camping 6 spawns at<br/>
once, or group members being selfish about things me or another group member<br/>
could use.<br/>
<br/>
But Verant can&#39;t (And shouldn&#39;t) get into the business of trying to<br/>
&quot;legislate&quot; morals.  The new looting code is interesting - but won&#39;t really<br/>
stop ninja looters.  If people want to be assholes, let them be assholes.<br/>
Spread the word.  I for one will not group with Obsidian Warlords, and if<br/>
someone asks me, I tell them why.  I won&#39;t group with Dragons of Asia, or<br/>
several other camping/farming guilds.  Now my entire guild has stopped<br/>
grouping with them too.  Some of the names are memorized, some are not.<br/>
Point is, if someone is twinked, don&#39;t group with them if it upsets you -<br/>
and spread the word to those that share a sympathetic cause.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Valid point about whether or not Verant thinks that this is a problem.  I<br/>
will ask why you don&#39;t think twinking is a problem or that anything should<br/>
be done about it?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I accept your argument on this conditionally, since my field of expertise<br/>
is emergency medicine and not computer programming.  Couldn&#39;t they have<br/>
added this into the Ruins of Kunark expansion?  Wouldn&#39;t an expansion of<br/>
that size have taken a great deal of programmer time?<br/>
