<b>Subject:</b> Re: Mend, my most useless and irritating skill. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-875639028">It seems to me that the chances of it failing are a LOT higher if you use<br/>
Mend and you are at 50% health or lower.  I&#39;m level 24 and my skill is only<br/>
90 (never bothered practicing it when sitting in town babbling with people,<br/>
I&#39;m going to have to start now. :)).  If I use it when I only have 2 bubbles<br/>
of health gone, it seems to work almost all the time.  I can only recall it<br/>
failing twice, in recent memory, and only worsening my wounds once.  I<br/>
always try and use it when I&#39;ve lost 2 bubbles.<br/>

&gt; practicing my newly aquired FD skill, which did work,  I used mend 4 times<br/>
&gt; in about a 2 hour period of time.  It worked once, failed twice, and<br/>
&gt; worsened my wounds the last time, which killed me when I had a white<br/>
&gt; scarecrow on its last legs.  My character basically committed suicide at<br/>
&gt; the point where he was going to win.  As I said, it seems I have the worse<br/>
&gt; luck with Mend.  Does any one else have this problem or am I just the<br/>
&gt; victim of bad numbers?<br/>
