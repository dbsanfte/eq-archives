<div id="ygrps-yiv-884905610">Well, this is just getting plain silly. Your monk is not a worthless pile of<br/>
meat. Its not a mana sponge, or a helpless school girl. The monk class at<br/>
any level does a Great Deal of Damage, and in my opinion more than any other<br/>
melee class with the exception of a warrior with Plane of Fear equipment.<br/>
Your strength lies not with one or two glorious swings for 70 points of<br/>
damage, but in four punches for 23, and a flying kick for 52. Your Armor<br/>
class is not as high as a warriors, it never will be. Get used to it, but<br/>
also get used to Block, Dodge, Block. You hit points are lower, until you<br/>
factor in a 25% hit point heal every six minutes, you&#39;re selling yourself<br/>
short.<br/>
<br/>
As for playing with Twinked characters who out damage you, I must answer to<br/>
the positive. I&#39;ve been playing with Ranger and Bard both of which carry top<br/>
of the line Ykeesha&#39;s and they generally out damage me (then again, they<br/>
take the damage then, too and I&#39;m a hell of a lot harder to hit than some<br/>
ranger). The gap is narrowing however, and would be closed if they were not<br/>
wearing haste sashes. Remember, the higher you level, the less of an<br/>
advantage Twinking Gives.<br/>
<br/>
Yes Verant has changed our most unique skill, it will still save youin tight<br/>
situations, however. At least we have it! I&#39;ve used it numerous times to get<br/>
myself out of Castle Mistmoore when EVERYONE in my party died, twinks and<br/>
casters alike. Indeed, they&#39;ve suggested calling me Stonedorn EscapeArtist.<br/>
Its harder now, but playing a Monk was never an easy path.<br/>
<br/>
To be honest, I think we&#39;ve passed the meaningful discussion of the class<br/>
and have entered into &quot;the Grass is Greener&quot; syndrome. If you&#39;re so unhappy<br/>
with your Monk, Give It Up and go play a Dark Elf Necro. Please don&#39;t take<br/>
the Monk Name in the Realm of Envious Complainers.<br/>
