 </span></blockquote>I found it much worse...  At least in the elder room I could go around a <br/>
kill blue mobs..  In the Gorge EVERYTHING is green.  With the help of<br/>
a low level ranger I got bored enough and cleared the zone of all mobs we<br/>
could find on tracking!  =)<br/>
<br/>
The other 3 weren&#39;t too bad..  The other alchemist in Misty you just camp<br/>
the Motto spawn spot (far left tent).  The cube is almost always there,<br/>
and the last one I guess he spawns all the time.<br/>
