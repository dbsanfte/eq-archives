<div id="ygrps-yiv-417494637">Well, I&#39;ve got a monk at 26th level and I think that if I had to do it all <br/>
over again I&#39;d dump all the points into agility.  I&#39;d just rather not get <br/>
hit than hit a bit harder.<br/>
<br/>
As for how I distributed my stats at the beginning, I put 5 into DEX, 5 <br/>
into AGILITY, and (please don&#39;t laugh too hard, I didn&#39;t know any better) <br/>
10 into INT.  Strangest part is that putting those 10 points into INT has <br/>
come in kinda handy for Dragon Punch, from what I hear about how hard it is <br/>
to raise it&#39;s going up really fast.  I&#39;m mabye 3/4ths of a bubble into 26 <br/>
and I&#39;ve got Dragon up to 71.  And I guess it also comes in handy for <br/>
Brewing, hehe.<br/>

I played a Monk up to level 8 and am now thinking that I messed up pretty<br/>
bad on wasting experience on combat stuff when you really shouldn&#39;t bother. <br/>
I have now decided to start a new Monk at Freeport (because, holy cow, is <br/>
it<br/>
long and tedious to look for beasts around Karana. My questions:<br/>
<br/>
1. What is final word on starting Str and Agil? How much in each? If you<br/>
higher up guys could go back and re-do it what would you pick?<br/>
2. Is there any trade skill that I should concentrate on that would be a <br/>
big<br/>
benifit to my guy for money etc?<br/>
<br/>
Any advice or other tips would be appreciated - I definately do not want to <br/>
run another up levels again.<br/>
