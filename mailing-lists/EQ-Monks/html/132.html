<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-841080179">I just hit 15 and have about 80-90% mesh (the rest is woven - magic bracers,<br/>
rings, earrings).  I bought every piece of armor I have, I have never even<br/>
been to Guk.  What worked for me is killing wisps by the hundreds in W<br/>
Commons.  Greater Lightstones are few and far between, but when you get<br/>
them, NPC&#39;s will pay 4+ pp for each (PC&#39;s even more) and even regular<br/>
lightstones are good for 8-9 gp.  Besides this, I had 2+ full sets of netted<br/>
armor in the sewers beneath qeynos that i sold for about 1pp each - gave<br/>
away the last 5 pieces to a very cute lvl 4 female monk last night :)  So<br/>
no, you don&#39;t have to travel to Guk.<br/>
<br/>
I paid anywhere between 4-8 plat per piece of mesh and 2-4 plat per woven<br/>
piece.  Whether it&#39;s a good deal or not depends on how badly you want it,<br/>
and how badly the seller wants to sell it :)  I did most of my auctioning in<br/>
Freeport, E & W Comm, but have been told on several occasions that prices<br/>
get much cheaper as you go into zones closer to Guk.  I auctioned<br/>
*constantly* for over a week to get my mesh (I was surprised how fast it<br/>
went!)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
At lvl 10, you&#39;re probly not ready to solo wisps yet.  I would suggest<br/>
killing orcs at the 2 orc camps in E Comm until lvl 12 or 13.  Also, you do<br/>
know that you need magical gloves (at least netted) to fight wisps, right?<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck,<br/>

&gt; &gt; I am new to this list so I don&#39;t know if you guys have discussed this<br/>
&gt; &gt; before. I am looking for Mesh armor, but I don&#39;t want to travel to Guk<br/>
&gt; &gt; to get it. What is a good town to buy it in, and what is the normal<br/>
&gt; &gt; price I should expect to pay. Thanks in Advance<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Mesh at level 8 is a pretty aggressive goal. I&#39;m rather lazy and at 10<br/>
&gt; I have but a netted veil and gloves, and that&#39;s it for<br/>
&gt; mesh/woven/netted stuff.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you don&#39;t want to go to guk, you are probably best served by<br/>
&gt; Freeport which is the closest *major* human-friendly town to<br/>
&gt; Innothule, Guk, et. al.<br/>
