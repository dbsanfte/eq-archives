<div id="ygrps-yiv-1338915470">Me too!  The first thing I do when I log on is hit the Run key :), and then<br/>
my Friends button.  Then I ask all the ones who are anon where they are. :)<br/>

I&#39;ve had some fun without a group, recently in Highpass.  Nobody wanted to<br/>
group with my level 18 ogre basher, so he just joined in the free-for-all<br/>
fray.  Much to my surprise he was able to do enough damage to get some of<br/>
the kills if there were multiple mobs!  So I started saying things like &quot;Yah<br/>
meez da bestest barsher round!&quot; /em flexes his muscles &quot;Me kills da orcs<br/>
gud!&quot;  Everyone around was laughing. :)  I love that.<br/>

&gt; But, it is the grouping I really enjoy. I love the interaction. I try to<br/>
&gt; make heavy use of the /friends list. </span></blockquote></div>
