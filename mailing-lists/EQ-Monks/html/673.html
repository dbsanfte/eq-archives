<div id="ygrps-yiv-2125877367"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I made it to higher levels with my druid (and no, it wasn&#39;t by kiting.  I<br/>
&gt; was a druid when people didn&#39;t even know what a druid could do) and then<br/>
&gt; everyone suddenly decided to become druids.  Well, I can&#39;t stand being<br/>
&gt; commonplace.  So I switched characters.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is exactly what I did.  I had been playing a monk (level 18).. and just<br/>
got bored with it.  Wasn&#39;t sure if I&#39;d ever play him again, so I sold (at a<br/>
cheap price) all of his equipment, which he had earned, and gave the money<br/>
to my ogre, who was level 12 at the time.  I did this so I wouldn&#39;t have to<br/>
sit around camping MOBs with great loot, to earn enough money to equip him<br/>
even half bad.  So I&#39;d be able to adventure more, and go different places.<br/>
I have a lot more fun role-playing my ogre than I ever did playing my monk<br/>
because I was constantly looking out for money and equipment.  Didn&#39;t have<br/>
the time to adventure (if I wanted to be relatively safe when doing it!)<br/>
The ogre is level 17 now, and has been a lot more places that my monk has.<br/>
I like spending time sitting and talking to folks (&quot;Her der, shorti!  &lt;/em<br/>
rests his elbow on Ulrik&#39;s head.&gt;&quot;)  My ogre has mostly bronze, some<br/>
banded.. 2 combines, and a fine steel 2 hander.  Certainly nothing<br/>
outstanding, and about half of which he earned himself.  But he never would<br/>
have been able to, had he not had the little headstart I gave him.  He&#39;s<br/>
probably still be in the Feerrott killing lizards.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; You know what I&#39;ve noticed?  The only people who have a problem with<br/>
&gt; twinking are the people who twink without the resources to do it well.  I<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t count the number of times some level 5 warrior in full bronze has<br/>
&gt; called me a twink and sneered at me.  Hello?  Ok, I&#39;ll write them off as<br/>
&gt; stupid.  Do I write you off that way, too?<br/>
