<div id="ygrps-yiv-2057765013"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; maybe FD pulling itself is an exploit?  maybe verant never intended the <br/>
&gt; monk class<br/>
&gt; to be able to break spawns by fd pulling?  maybe they just intended it as a <br/>
&gt; &#39;&#39;get out<br/>
&gt; of death free&#39;&#39; card for the individual monk?  I personally think some <br/>
&gt; spawns should<br/>
&gt; not be able to be broken since it makes the game too easy.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I imagine they didnt think of fd pulling, it just happened.  Thats whats<br/>
kind of unrealistic.  IMHO, whe you build a game of this magnitude, you<br/>
build the environment, and see what falls.  they planned on the monk being<br/>
the melee damage dealer, and instead he ends up being a puller.  <br/>
<br/>
I kind of see the fd pulling along the same lines as bard twisting.  did<br/>
they plan for that? probably not.  But I bet bards would be upset if they<br/>
removed that ability.</div>
