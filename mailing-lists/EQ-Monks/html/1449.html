<div id="ygrps-yiv-405526611">Ok, this line of discussion brings up a tough question.  I&#39;ve been saving<br/>
points for dragon punch coming up.  I&#39;ll have 25 points when I get it.  Is<br/>
instill doubt good enough that I should put some of the saved up points into<br/>
it, instead of the special attack?  Any advice here in either direction?<br/>

		Oh yea, I forgot the stop attacking thingy too.  Hehe.  As<br/>
far as instill <br/>
		doubt goes, its the hardest skill I have ever had to raise.<br/>
I hit the <br/>
		instill doubt button constantly, targeting anything I can,<br/>
and I think mine <br/>
		is like 35th.  And the key to getting it to work is make<br/>
sure the ONLY thing <br/>
		you are doing to your target is auto attack, no special<br/>
attacks, and your <br/>
		special attacks button has to be up (Tiger Claw, etc) and<br/>
then hit your <br/>
		instill doubt.  Now, chances are the next result you will<br/>
see is it telling <br/>
		you &quot;You aren&#39;t scaring anyone&quot;.  Hehe if you are REALLY<br/>
lucky and get it to <br/>
		work (I think I have gotten it to work like 3 or 4 times),<br/>
it should have <br/>
		the same effect as the 4th level necro spell, and make them<br/>
start to run <br/>
		away for 10-30 seconds.  Only you don&#39;t get the nifty flying<br/>
skulls.</div>
