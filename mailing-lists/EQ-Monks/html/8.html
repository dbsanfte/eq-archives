<b>Subject:</b> KOS by the Freeport guards... help! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-471176097">I&#39;ve got a frequent grouping partner who has a problem with his<br/>
faction information.  I was hoping some of the geniuses on this list might<br/>
be able to help.<br/>
	He was in the Freeport bank while another player was beating up on<br/>
one of the guards there (the corrupt one, I believe).  Being the cleric<br/>
that he is, he healed him up and then left.  Apparently - for whatever<br/>
reason - this other player was not able to kill the guard (what happened to<br/>
him is unknown).  How do I know this?  Well, the next time my friend<br/>
stopped by the bank, this guard attacked him on sight and my friend was<br/>
forced to kill him in self-defense.<br/>
	As a result of this, he is now KOS by the Freeport guards and<br/>
cannot get anywhere near the gates without being jumped.  We&#39;ve tried any<br/>
number of things to try to raise his faction with the guards, but nothing<br/>
seems to work... Slaughtered orcs of various flavors (including those in<br/>
High Hold and Qeynos), tried a bunch of quests, etc.  So far nothing has<br/>
worked... We don&#39;t believe that it&#39;s a matter of simply &#39;killing enough of<br/>
them&#39; as we&#39;ve taken note of the faction hits and bonuses accrued as a<br/>
result of killing these things, and it seems as if none of them affect the<br/>
&#39;normal&#39; Freeport Guards.<br/>
	Is there anybody here who might have any suggestions?<br/>
