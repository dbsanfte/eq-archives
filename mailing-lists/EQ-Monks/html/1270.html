<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1810530562">As a level 34 monk (all be it with slightly above average equipment for my<br/>
level)  Here is what I did after verants &quot;dissapointing&quot; news:<br/>
<br/>
I took my two plat bp rings off and placed em in my inventory.  Grabbed a pair<br/>
of jagged bands.  I switched from drake hide leggings to gator scale: 7 AC! best<br/>
monk legs in the game.  (I camped the ancient croc for about 7 hours one day and<br/>
got em  myself - made 2kpp  selling the gator amrs in the process!)<br/>
<br/>
Serp bracers were replaced first with an erolisi and a vox and then with a Hero<br/>
bracer and a vox bracer.  I HIGHLY recommend the hero bracer despite its weight<br/>
it has Awsome AC and looks super cool with the black treant fists equiped.<br/>
<br/>
I took off that exec hood and switched to a Crown of forglock kings -  12 just<br/>
rocks.  <br/>
<br/>
Caveat:<br/>
With all these changes I did notice mobs were hitting me for a lot less. <br/>
However duel wiel in particular was rising slowly (dex increase melee skill<br/>
learning rates) SO what I do now is after each level play for an hour  our two<br/>
in &quot;dex gear&quot; to max out my skills quickly then switch back to the AC/STR gear<br/>
when I am done.  I maxed out equipment I can get my dex to 145 and agi to 139. <br/>
With stats like those I learn  SUPER fast ( like I say I am usually maxed all my<br/>
melee skills within an hour of levelling) then its back to the old AC/STR gear<br/>
for the real tough fights.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
So, folks, we all recently heard *with disappointment* about verant<br/>
employees posting about DEX and AGI - they seem to be a lot less important<br/>
than we hoped for.  In light of this new information - what do all you monks<br/>
out there see as the most important stats for a monk, now? How would you<br/>
focus your items (ie STR? AC? HPS? AGI? DEX? STA?)? And how would you<br/>
distribute your starting points?  Maybe a few could name some equipment that<br/>
backs up their opinions.<br/>
Thanks in advance for everyone&#39;s input =)<br/>
