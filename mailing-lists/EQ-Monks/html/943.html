&gt;When I&#39;m playing my cleric, I actually look for monks to group with<br/>
&gt;before warriors.  There are a few reasons (and this is at the mid ish<br/>
&gt;levels, apparantly the warrior hps become more vital at the high levels)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>         I now play an Enchanter for my main character and almost always <br/>
(unless the Warrior is ultra-twinked for my protection) choose a Monk over <br/>
a Warrior for my primary Tank. Monks make the fight shorter (especially <br/>
after I drop Augmentation, Celerity, or Rampage on them). Rangers are a <br/>
very close 3rd choice since they have Snare, some Healing, and SoW (at 39).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;1.  Monks have less hp, but tend to take less damage than warriors.  We<br/>
&gt;cannot tank as well as a warrior, but the cleric hp buffs mean a lot<br/>
&gt;more on a monk with their dodges, blocks, etc...  Also this makes heals<br/>
&gt;worth more too.  Said more clearly, monks tanking means less damage<br/>
&gt;being absorbed, thus heals are more powerful.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>         Never really noticed this at lower levels, but at higher levels a <br/>
Warrior will last longer. Dodge, Block, Riposte don&#39;t make up for the lower <br/>
AC and HPs. HOWEVER, any Enchanter worth anything will alternate Stuns <br/>
(maybe even Whirl) in the battle to keep the Monk from even getting <br/>
touched. That makes up for the lower AC and HPs. Especially since a Monk <br/>
will finish the Mob a lot faster than a Warrior will. To that end I will <br/>
generally drop Rampage on the Monk. Lowers AGI by 15 but gives an extra 30 <br/>
STR and a 150-200 point Protective Skin. Bad trade-off (I know how much <br/>
losing 15 AGI hurts) unless I can keep the Mob &quot;busy&quot;. So, I keep them &quot;busy&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;2.  We lack taunt, but the special attacks seem to hack monsters off<br/>
&gt;pretty well.  Warrior&#39;s special attacks are nothing compared to monk&#39;s.<br/>
&gt;They need taunt to keep up on the aggro list, while monks just need<br/>
&gt;their damage to do that.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>         As an Enchanter I have Rune up (damage shield) and can Stun then <br/>
Mem Blur the Mob off of me pretty quickly. As for Wizards, Stun then Mem <br/>
Blur works pretty well. Most groups I am in don&#39;t need a Taunter unless we <br/>
are pulling 3+ mobs. Of course, with a Monk, this doesn&#39;t happen all that <br/>
often.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;3.  Monks tend to be better players.  Most munchkins don&#39;t play monks.<br/>
&gt;My odds of getting a good tank from the shallow gene pool of warriors<br/>
&gt;are not good.  Monks have a much higher player skill level.  (maybe this<br/>
&gt;is jut&#92;st on the servers I play, but I have heard similar stuff from<br/>
&gt;other clerics)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>         Any Warrior that can make it past 35 will be decent in a group so <br/>
this argument holds very little water for me. However, I agree that at <br/>
lower levels most Warriors haven&#39;t figured out how to group effectively. <br/>
Then again, most classes don&#39;t figure it out until 20+. Enchanters are <br/>
forced to learn a little earlier.  :-)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;People choose paladins over you?? Ewww, paladins are my least favorite<br/>
&gt;tank.  Their damage output is pathetic unless you are going on a two man<br/>
&gt;undead hunting team (which is GREAT xp for cleric/pally),<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>         Unless that Paladin has Ghoulbane and I am hunting Mistmoore, <br/>
Unrest or Undead side of Lower Guk, I would rather have a Ranger for my 2nd <br/>
Tank. Or a good Rogue that knows how to hang back for a bit before Backstabbing.</div>
