<b>Subject:</b> Skill training while you sleep. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1434489564">Lately Ive been trying to think of a way to train hard-to-learn skills<br/>
while Im sleeping - such as instill doubt.  I know you can target a corpse<br/>
and train ID.  I have set up my sidewinder precision pro, using its profiler<br/>
software, to press #s 1-6 (the skill hotkeys) by just pressing 1 button on<br/>
the joystick.  Thing is, I can&#39;t figure out any way to get this button to be<br/>
pressed down over and over (if you hold it down with a rubberband or<br/>
similar, it will work once, but wont keep pressing your hotkeys all night).<br/>
Sidewinder doesnt seem to have auto-fire.  I know that gravis makes a<br/>
joystick (or is it gamepad?) with autofire but I&#39;d rather not spend a ton of<br/>
money - I already pay 8 bucks a month for this game =P<br/>
	Has anyone put some thought into this?  Anyone ever created a<br/>
button-presser?  Let me know what you folks think - I&#39;d rather not spend my<br/>
waking hours pressing hotkeys =)<br/>
