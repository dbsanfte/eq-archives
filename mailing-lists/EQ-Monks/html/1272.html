<div id="ygrps-yiv-1895806426">well this is what im wearing,  im not sure if i have all of the top of the <br/>
line gear but it works ok for me.<br/>
<br/>
foremans tunic, 3 str, 3 wis<br/>
serpentine bracer 3dex (not really useful) 9agi<br/>
bracer of erollisi 5 str <br/>
2 jagged bands 3str 5 ac<br/>
2 golden amber earrings 3 str<br/>
mesh pants ( i think they look better than cured silk)<br/>
fur lined shoes<br/>
mesh sleeves (trying to get a lupine armband thing)<br/>
mesh cap<br/>
for the neck i had a 3 dex necklace, but since thats not so useful and im <br/>
kinda broke right now, i stuck in a 4 int necklace, spiked collar would go <br/>
well here<br/>
wu&#39;s fighting gauntlets<br/>
raw silk shoulders <br/>
silvered star ruby veil 5 dex, 5 cha (im going to switch to a silver ruby <br/>
veil which is 4 str 4 wis)<br/>
mesh cape<br/>
<br/>
i think thats all the equipment slots, ive had all this stuff since lvl 16 so <br/>

next? thanks in advance<br/>
