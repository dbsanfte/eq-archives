<div id="ygrps-yiv-1593915969"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;HOW can you say using FD pulling was exploiting on  the planes??  Do you<br/>
 </span></blockquote>know what happens now?  Even more of a cheat if you ask me.  Just takes<br/>
longer, cause now after FD, you just need to /exit and wait 3 min before<br/>
loggin back into the server.  I have been lvl 50 for about 2 or 3 months<br/>
now, and this nerf has seriously hurt our skills.  We are pullers, that is<br/>
our main contribution to a party after we get FD and hone our skills.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t say it was. I don&#39;t think FD pulling is an exploit. It is handled<br/>
wrong in the Gameplay Logic. Personally I think once you FD and a mob _sees_<br/>
you back on your feet again, it should never believe another oneo of you<br/>
FDs. As I&#39;ve said before, Verant has a MUD mentality in which they balance<br/>
gameplay at the expense of logic. This is bad design.<br/>
<br/>
Getting back to the point is the way in which two main incidents were<br/>
handled. The first being the new monk robe, which is marginally better than<br/>
a lockjaw vest AC 12 vs AC 9 vs and choice of which stat increases you think<br/>
is most valuable. Personally, I&#39;ll take the AC at this point in my monks<br/>
career. Introducing this item seemed to me a border line waste of time, not<br/>
mine, but theirs. The second incident being the FD thing. My favorite<br/>
example being when you stand back up and everyone but the caboose of the<br/>
train forgets you and he goes along re-aggroing the lot.<br/>
<br/>
I think what got everyone so worked up was the FD split-pull defined the<br/>
monk&#39;s role in the group. Now that role has changed, and its led to<br/>
confusion and no small amount of bitterness. Given the over-crowding issue<br/>
in most dungeons though, (75 in lower guk? _shudder_) the split-pull was<br/>
becoming less important as &quot;just finding&quot; something to attack.<br/>
