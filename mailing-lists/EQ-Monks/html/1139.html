Monks of the Whistling Fist:  It is likely that you need to be a tailor to<br/>
do this.  Brother Qwinn in Southern Karana seeks the return of the code of<br/>
the whistling fist, which was stolen by him. It is dropped by Targin the<br/>
Rock, a rare spawn in the Sol B throne room.  Bring him the Code and a<br/>
purple silent fist headband and you will get a special needle.  Brother<br/>
Zephyl in Rathe Mountains wants the Idol of Zan Fi, which is in the<br/>
possession of Brother Raster, who spawns in the Mino Elders room in Lower<br/>
Guk. Returning this Idol, plus a red sash, results in a special tailoring<br/>
pattern.  These two items need to be combined in a sewing kit with a swatch<br/>
of shadow silk (tailored) and a Scroll of Jonathans Whistling Warsong, which<br/>
is bought from the Bards Guild, to make a monk only item called the Robe of<br/>
the Lost Circle.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
AC 12<br/>

Looks like a maroon caster robe.<br/>
<br/>
This is a very long quest. The items droped are no drop and ALL ALL, so some<br/>
players can loot it not knowing it is a quest for monks. Especially the<br/>
idol, that has stats in INT and WIS.<br/>
Targin the Rock seems to be a once a day spawn, may be even more often. But<br/>
Raster of Guk is the big part, a once a week spawn. Yes, once a week !!!!!<br/>
The brothers in SK and RM seem to spawn every 6 hours, and they disappear<br/>
after one hour or two.<br/>
<br/>
I would say it is a lvl 35+ quest.<br/>
