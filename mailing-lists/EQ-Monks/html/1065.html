<div id="ygrps-yiv-1493549414">Friends you meet on EQ?  Do you know their real life names? Where<br/>
they live? Their e-mail?  If EQ dropped off the planet, would you have any<br/>
way to find these people again?<br/>
<br/>
EQ is still a game.<br/>
<br/>
I went to play basketball the other day, I liked a guy I *played* against,<br/>
and we became friends.  The basketball game is still a game<br/>
even if I do meet friends there.  And maybe we only meet on the basketball<br/>
court.  ... Basketball is still just a game.  Just like work is work,<br/>
even though I have created friends at work, the &quot;work&quot; I do is still<br/>
just work.  The people you meet while you play a game <br/>
do not make the game more than what it is.<br/>
<br/>
I played a mud for well over 7 years, and during that time, my fellow<br/>
mudders and I became such good friends that we had international<br/>
gatherings of us mudders to meet in real life.  Yes, the friends I<br/>
created there last a lifetime, but where we met, the mud... the &quot;game&quot;<br/>
will always be just a game.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; So you&#39;re saying you haven&#39;t made one friend on EQ that you want to keep?<br/>
&gt; So you solo everything?  Never group, never interact?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; All those little names popping up on your screen are real people - true,<br/>
&gt; most of the game is spent trying to get better and better &quot;bits&quot; on that<br/>
&gt; computer in California, but to make a blanket the game is not real statement<br/>
&gt; is wrong.  There are people in that game that I care about, and I know there<br/>
&gt; are a few that return the favor.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This e-mail is not real.  It&#39;s bits on a computer in Georgia.<br/>

&gt; It should not be more than a game.  Because that is ALL it is, a game.<br/>
&gt; If its more to you, then you seriously need to stop &quot;playing&quot; it,<br/>
&gt; readjust your life, realize how little those bytes stored on a computer<br/>
&gt; in california really should mean to you.<br/>
