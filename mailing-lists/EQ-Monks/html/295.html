<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1609928405">My suggestion - Check your current AC, and carried weight, and then go to <br/>
the bank. Bank one of your leather items (not the shirt). Check your AC and <br/>
carry weight again. After a while, you will find the combination of worn & <br/>
banked items that gives you the best AC. Once you&#39;ve done this, you will <br/>
want to start replacing what you banked with a very light armour...<br/>
<br/>
What city are you adventuring from?<br/>

&gt;Hail all, I am a relatively new member of the EverQuest family.On the E&#39;Chi <br/>
&gt;world I just reached 8th lvl, moments ago actualy, And have many Q&#39;s <br/>
&gt;regarding the intricacies of playing the ever loved Monk. I read in some of <br/>
&gt;the recent posts about AC-weight considerations and would like to &quot;trim the <br/>
&gt;fat&quot; so to speak from my armor.<br/>
&gt;As of now I have a Leather, shirt, pants, shoulder, gloves, mask, cap, A <br/>
&gt;cloth cape a mesh bracers and raw hide boots. Now keeping in mind that I am <br/>
&gt;working with a tight budget, Nay, make that a VERY tight budget, what <br/>
&gt;whould be your suggestions on what I should keep/acquire.<br/>
&gt;Thank you for your time.<br/>
