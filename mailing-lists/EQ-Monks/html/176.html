<div id="ygrps-yiv-1054960533">not sure what lvl the ape was he was blue to me @49 but i imagine he was in<br/>
his high 40s and i heard they have boots of the same quality.)<br/>
<br/>
we had about 3 parties of 6 lvl45+ players<br/>
a well balanced party of 6 45+ could probably do 1 ape alone with no prob.<br/>
<br/>
however in the fear plane mobs like to wonder on by and join in.<br/>
<br/>
to do the fear plane u will need a WELL balanced party.<br/>
<br/>
you need a druid for sow for when u get teleported by the monster your<br/>
fighting and also you need them for evac since the zone out of that place is<br/>
like hidden in a castle or something.<br/>
<br/>
you need a cleric to heal and to res ppl when they die.<br/>
<br/>
you need a bard for the mana song, fighting buffs, and levetate so when the<br/>
entire party gets blasted up above the trees it won&#39;t kill your casters from<br/>
the fall. (all that traing in safefall actually paid off... i didn&#39;t take a<br/>
bit a dmg and i was sure to brag about it too)<br/>
<br/>
you need a caster... we had a necro.. i like the necros skel stun spell... i<br/>
turns the mob into a skel and stuns them for like 10 seconds.<br/>
enchanters are really nice because they can mesmorise several mobs @a time<br/>
and allow your party to focus on one with out gett&#39;n hit in the back the<br/>
whole time.<br/>
<br/>
and lastly you need a real tank... one that can taunt... i prefer rangers<br/>
normally because they can track... however our ranger said his tracking was<br/>
useless in there because monster didn&#39;t respawn and there were too many ppl<br/>
in the zone that filled up his tracking screen.<br/>
<br/>
don&#39;t really know why you need a monk anymore though... since the warriors<br/>
are doing more dmg than ever.. they got more hps.. and they can taunt...<br/>
casters seem to like that taunt thing.. it can come in handy in keeping a<br/>
party alive... it really sucks to see one of my casters gett&#39;n the crap beat<br/>
out of em and there is nothing i can do about it... as a matter of fact i<br/>
normally just stay on the 1st mob until he&#39;s dead... tanks normally have to<br/>
taunt off the casters when we get more than one... and they take more dmg<br/>
than ever... high lvl monks hardly ever take dmg... not because of block,<br/>
dodge, reposte and such... but because we can&#39;t taunt... i&#39;ve gotten to<br/>
where i normally do the pull&#39;n just so i can take some dmg before the mob<br/>
jumps on a caster and it has to be taunted off by the tank.<br/>
actually i think if there were more high lvl warriors and i wasn&#39;t such good<br/>
friends with the ppl i normally party with i would probably get replaced...<br/>
just like our server&#39;s 1st high lvl rogue.)<br/>
<br/>
sorry to go off the subject like that... but this has been bugging me for a<br/>
while..(<br/>

&gt; 	Now that people are going into the Plane of Fear we are hearing<br/>
&gt; about all the great things coming out.� Apparently there is a set of<br/>
&gt; armor special for every class in the Plane of Fear.� Has anyone hear<br/>
&gt; anything about a new armor for monks.� Most of it is plate based but<br/>
&gt; the druids have armor that is chain based coming out of there.� It<br/>
&gt; would be nice if we got something there too.<br/>
&gt; 	�<br/>
