<b>Subject:</b> RE: [EQ-Monks] Disarm skill <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1590338180">When you disarm a critter they drop the weapon to the ground.  You cannot <br/>
disarm magical weapons from critters.  Even if you do disarm a crittter you <br/>
will not notice a difference in the damage it does or in its attack rate. <br/>
 Aside from a few laughs (you can practice it against green critters), it&#39;s <br/>
really not all that useful vs. critters.<br/>
<br/>
Until a few days ago I was under the impression that we could not disarm <br/>
magical weapons from PCs, but a (still very pissed off) high elf paladin <br/>
told me that he had indeed been disarmed in a dual.  Personally, I think <br/>
that we should be able to disarm in a dual.  It&#39;s not like the other <br/>
classes can&#39;t use disarm, they just don&#39;t get the skill as early as we do. <br/>
 If they&#39;re afraid of being disarmed they can go get magical gloves and <br/>
they can practice hand to hand for a couple weeks, or they can just not <br/>
accept the dual.<br/>
<br/>
On a side note, warriors (and probably rouges) can fight just as well hand <br/>
to hand as a monk until 20th level.  Why?  Monks are the only class that <br/>
can MASTER hand to hand, and 100 skill (attainable at 19th level) is still <br/>
excellent not master.  In fact, a warrior will probably hit harder due to <br/>
their strength being on the average greater, but they will not swing quite <br/>
as often as a monk.  (That should also kind of explain why we have to have <br/>
patience and wait for our characters to become powerful.)<br/>
<br/>
I love playing a monk, I&#39;m so glad that I didn&#39;t play a warrior and that I <br/>
stopped playing my shaman.  I build my character almost totally wrong (10 <br/>
into INT of all things, seriously) and I still rage.  As far as I&#39;m <br/>
concerned I&#39;m the weakest monk for my level that ever was and will be, but <br/>
I can still make warriors look silly.  Sure it takes a while to get there, <br/>
but it&#39;s sure worth it when you do.<br/>

A couple of days ago when I logged on the chat server they had that <br/>
question<br/>
&quot;Should you be able to use the disarm skill in a PvP situatioin?&quot;  Can you<br/>
use it now in a PvP situation and they are thinking about changing it or is <br/>
it the other way around?  I think monks should be able to because it is one <br/>
of the skills we get, and it makes us who we are.  Why even give us the<br/>
skill if we can&#39;t use it.  Also to the people that already have it, what<br/>
happens when you disarm?  Does the weapon go on the ground or in your<br/>
inventory?  Thanks<br/>
