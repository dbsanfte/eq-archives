No one was presuming to tell you anything.  We were discussing why it<br/>
(twinking) bothered us.  Perhaps most heavy twinkers are in that same boat<br/>
you are - friends are way ahead of them as far as levels go and they need<br/>
every chance they can to catch up.<br/>
<br/>
But someone did ask why Twinking bothered us so much, and I gave an honest<br/>
answer without trying to force anyone to conform to my POV.  <br/>
<br/>
And if you don&#39;t attach any significance to items that aren&#39;t real why the<br/>
hostile response?  I honestly took the time and read this through - and<br/>
perhaps mistakingly I did pick up on an anger vibe.  :)  I&#39;ve found when<br/>
people start shouting MY GAME MY MONEY MY TIME that some nerve has been hit.<br/>
Camping is a sad fact of the online genre now.  UO, EQ and AC (From what<br/>
little I&#39;ve been able to actually get in) all have spawn points.  People<br/>
needing money or items are going to find out where they are and camp the<br/>
site.  But basically it seems that the view you&#39;ve taken is screw camping,<br/>
this &lt;Insert your own word here&gt; isn&#39;t real, I don&#39;t care about ITEMS THAT<br/>
ARE NOT REAL - but screw anyone who complains about these things being given<br/>
to me. If you couldn&#39;t give a crap about ITEMS THAT ARE NOT REAL then why<br/>
not give me your Serp Bracers? :)<br/>
<br/>
And as far as the &quot;Working damn hard&quot; &quot;nice spread&quot; comments you made:  If<br/>
this is all just some mixed up little insignificant universe that matters<br/>
nothing to you - go into the character selection screen, pick your Monk that<br/>
has all those ITEMS THAT ARE NOT REAL, and click &quot;Delete&quot;<br/>

&quot;Nice spread&quot; - &quot;Worked damn hard&quot; - &quot;nothing to look forward too&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Whatever.  These are all words and phrases that bother me.<br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;m going to throw up all over my cloth shoes. I have a some twinked<br/>
items, no doubt about it. Among my favorites are the Serp Braces given to me<br/>
by<br/>
a dear real life friend when I first broke level ten.<br/>
<br/>
Do not presume to tell me how to enjoy MY game paid for with MY MONEY. If<br/>
your<br/>
idea of fun is waiting around, camping out a certain area for some piece of<br/>
equipment, be my guest, but DO NOT ASSUME everyone else has that same sense<br/>
of<br/>
fun.<br/>
<br/>
I do not, and never will attach any amount of significance to the<br/>
acquisition of<br/>
items THAT ARE NOT REAL. If I could play this game naked, without any<br/>
inventory<br/>
at all, I would. This is one of the reasons I choose the Monk class. I<br/>
detest<br/>
the idea of running all over the universe begging to group with some other<br/>
players, using each other to just get a new piece of armor. If I were forced<br/>
to<br/>
do that, I would not be &quot;around too much longer&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
As it stands now, I am having the most fun leveling my monk, attempting to<br/>
reach<br/>
a point in the game where I can adventure with my friends who purchased the<br/>
game<br/>
two or three months before I did. I want to play with them, sitting in their<br/>
office till 3 am, playing on their T1, drinking beer, while we all are<br/>
gaming<br/>
Together, not merely on the same server.<br/>

&gt; I have to agree with Praelor.  I don&#39;t know *why* twinking bothers me.  I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t deny it is perhaps partial jealousy.  Hell yes I would like level<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; twinkers get over a non-twinked same level person.  Now perhaps that the<br/>
&gt; advantage is more of a psycological thing.. i.e. I *think* they have a<br/>
&gt; better chance than me.  But I feel that if I&#39;m standing beside a level 20<br/>
&gt; monk with high level gear and me with my low level gear, I feel like the<br/>
&gt; monk is going to be able to fight better and for longer without downtime<br/>
&gt; because of his ill gotten gear.  I haven&#39;t seen any &quot;studies&quot; to back up<br/>
 </span></blockquote>my<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; feelings, but it just makes sense to me :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And I don&#39;t want to open the &quot;If you want better gear go get it&quot; can of<br/>
&gt; worms.  I get the best that me and my group can get.  In a group of 10-12<br/>
&gt; people, we have to balance out quest items - it&#39;s only fair.  So that is<br/>
 </span></blockquote>not<br/>

 </span></blockquote>comes<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; from a level 40 MoB, then only a level 35+ can wear it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think the thing that bothers me the most about EQ is the money<br/>
 </span></blockquote>situation.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The greed factor has almost turned it into a UO-type situation.  I realize<br/>
&gt; this is a total tangent, but how many of you have actually had to turn OFF<br/>
&gt; the auction channel on a non-bazaar day?  I hate it.  I hate greed.  I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; level 20 and I have 15 pp to my name.  But that&#39;s just me and I could be<br/>
&gt; stupid :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Back to the twinking issue, I see one more factor:  My over developed<br/>
 </span></blockquote>sense<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; of injustice.  If I had to work so hard to get what I have, what gives Mr.<br/>
&gt; Twinkee the right to get everything handed to him?  Actually, now that I<br/>
&gt; think about it, it is the sense of injustice.  Jealousy is just a<br/>
