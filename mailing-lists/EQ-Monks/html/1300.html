<div id="ygrps-yiv-1592326209">Oh yea, another thing I didn&#39;t mention in my retort to Clarity The <br/>
Everknowing, was that your monk quest items for your sashes, are items you <br/>
can easily buy off of higher level people adventuring in the same places <br/>
that the items spawn.  Before they changed Paw, I used to hang in there <br/>
killing the stuff around 10-14th, and there were always high level people in <br/>
there killing the high level mobs shouting out things like &quot;What the heck is <br/>
a head of Shin?&quot;, of course my reply would always be &quot;Monk quest item, need <br/>
it for anything?  I could take it off your hands.&quot;  Hehe, I got most of my <br/>
sashes/headbands that way.  Anyway, hopefully he won&#39;t jump me again for for <br/>
trying to give you some good advice.<br/>

&gt;Hehe Clarity<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Starting a fight on my behalf?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt;I&#39;m sorry, but what are you talking about?  Herrick is a level 12 monk<br/>
&gt;talking<br/>
&gt;  &gt;about saving up scarab carapaces for 1.7gp each!  Do you think this guy <br/>
&gt;has<br/>
&gt;  &gt;30pp to go buy a bracer of erolisi? or 100pp to get a silver-plated <br/>
&gt;bracer?<br/>
&gt;  &gt;Please tell me what armor better than cured even a level 18 can go get?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;13th now :)<br/>
&gt;I have seen people selling Lockjaw Vests around Freeport, and was thinking<br/>
&gt;of saving for one. They are about 30pp.. and I&#39;ve about 11 saved so far..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Admittedly it&#39;s a lot at my level, but if I saved up 50pp for some Wu&#39;s<br/>
&gt;then by the time I hit 18, I should have bought a bit more stuff (although<br/>
&gt;I am currently spending most of my income on training up my brewing skill)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Finally got my orange sash too.<br/>
