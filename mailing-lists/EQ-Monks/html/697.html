<div id="ygrps-yiv-751497710">Well the yield policy should help this somewhat.  as to the bibs... well<br/>
i went to runnyeye the past 3 days in a row and no one was camping the<br/>
bibs while i was there.  i camped it once, the other 2 times i was just<br/>
passing thru and checked on it.  (knight never spawned while i was there,<br/>
heh.)<br/>

&gt;I would just like to say to the person that used the 26th level Bard to get <br/>
&gt;stuff that fine great if no one else wa around. I on the other hand have <br/>
&gt;walked into RE to try for a BIBS for a friend and found a 45th lvl Necro <br/>
&gt;sitting in the room. There he was taking away from us. I do not care if you <br/>
&gt;add to your character if it hurts no one else, but in the case of something <br/>
&gt;like a BIBS where it is a fairly rare drop your taking one might mean the <br/>
&gt;difference from some poor appropriate level guy sitting there half an hour <br/>
&gt;our 3 to 4 hours. The Onyx Ear rings are a frequent drop, but some of the <br/>
&gt;other items especially the items that started this whole debate are not. Can <br/>
