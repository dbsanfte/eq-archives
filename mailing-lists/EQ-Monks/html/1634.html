<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1260469750">ok I&#39;m a 18 (almost 19) monk, recently got Feign Death and Instil Doubt both<br/>
really cool skills I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll all agree.<br/>
<br/>
The main things are they take ages to train up, are there any hints or tips<br/>
you lot can give me about it, so far I&#39;m feigning then instil doubt whilst<br/>
feigned and as soon as feign pops FD again then ID, rinse and repeat. Is<br/>
this the best way of doing it or are there better ways ?<br/>
<br/>
also up until now i haven&#39;t really bothered using weapon at all (mucked<br/>
about with it and both 1hb and 2hb are at about 10) are there any cheap<br/>
weapons that i can pick up with low weight or are they all expensive things<br/>
like fighting batons and knuckle dusters ?<br/>
<br/>
any help appreciated<br/>
