<div id="ygrps-yiv-552612629">I&#39;m working on the Treant fist quest and have spent more <br/>
hours than I could possibly want to count sitting in the inn in <br/>
Kithicor waiting for the special monk to spawn.  I know about the <br/>
&#39;only at night&#39; restriction as well as the &#39;every other night&#39; <br/>
restriction to his spawn, and the only thing I&#39;ve ever seen spawn in <br/>
his spot are some NPCs that look like druids and con green to me at <br/>
level 47.  The one I spend most of my time staring at is &quot;Voli <br/>
Greenwhisper&quot;.<br/>
	It seems to me that if Greenwhisper is hanging out in the <br/>
monk&#39;s spawn spot, then the monk can&#39;t pop and I can&#39;t continue with <br/>
the quest.  Problem is, I&#39;m concerned what taking this guy out might <br/>
do to my factions (REALLY don&#39;t wanna screw my druid faction, as a <br/>
group gate out of a nasty spot in a dungeon at low health into the <br/>
arms of some pissed-off druids at the stones is not my idea of a fun <br/>
time.<br/>
	So my question would be: Do I have to kill this guy to free <br/>
up the space for the monk to pop when it&#39;s his time, and if so what <br/>
hits will I take.  If not, what do I have to do to ensure that the <br/>
monk DOES pop?<br/>
	Thanks for your time...<br/>
<br/>
P.S.: Yes, I know that they had stopped the quest before, but a <br/>
friend of mine has performed the quest after yesterday&#39;s patch, so it <br/>
seems to be in place.<br/>
