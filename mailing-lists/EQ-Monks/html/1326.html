<div id="ygrps-yiv-1421563428"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; It is somewhat high; however, with it on, my total weight is still<br/>
&gt; under 9<br/>
&gt; stones and that includes food, drink, and several stacks of bandages.<br/>
&gt; It not<br/>
&gt; much of a burden and it is greater by 2 AC over cured silk. I am also<br/>
&gt; sometimes<br/>
&gt; guilty of duel weilding combine warhammers (7.3 WT). Typically I group<br/>
&gt; with a<br/>
&gt; warrior and a ranger along with casters, so I rarely take hits and can<br/>
&gt; afford<br/>
&gt; the over 20 weight. I hope to replace them soon with Black Enamelled<br/>
&gt; Maces<br/>
&gt; which will shed about six stones of weight. Nothing else on my person<br/>
&gt; weighs<br/>
&gt; much more than 0.1 with the exception of a Bracer of Erolissi (1.0 WT)<br/>
&gt; and a<br/>
&gt; Serpentine Bracer (0.8 WT). Rusty Spike Shoulderpads, incidentally,<br/>
&gt; are also<br/>
&gt; 2.5 WT and provide 3AC with +5 STR.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Under 9?  thats impressive... what backpacks/boxes do you use... if any?<br/>
<br/>
I generally am at 14 or so... of course I carry an Sewn Evil Eye Pack<br/>
(3wt) and a few Large bags which are 1 wt each<br/>
<br/>
I know its very un-monk of me but I have never abided by the 14 stone<br/>
rule.  By this I mean that many monks will never loot past 14 stones but<br/>
I think thats stupid and you will never make money.  Sure your losing AC<br/>
and can potentially die faster but its a risk you take to actually make<br/>
some money in the game.  I am currently fighting in High Keep which<br/>
rules because its a short job upstairs to the bank =)<br/>
<br/>
Anyone, personally I would never take 2ac for and additional 2.4 wt...<br/>
one thing that is important for monks is ac/wt ration, not ac in itself<br/>
<br/>
Cured Silk Shoulders: 3ac 0.1wt  30ac/wt<br/>
Lizardscale Mantle: 5ac 2.5wt 2ac/wt<br/>
<br/>
In that respect it is much more favorable to take the shoulders<br/>
<br/>
Its all a matter of preference though<br/>
