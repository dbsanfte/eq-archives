&gt;This is probably a bit off topic, but since you asked...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I used Denon&#39;s Disrupted Discord(18th), Chord&#39;s of Dissonance(2nd), and<br/>
&gt;Hymn of Restoration(6th). I used those 3 songs with switching instruments<br/>
&gt;and punches (1-4dmg :) After 18th bards are more powerful using just<br/>
&gt;music. Had I tried fighting the paladin with my PGT and barbed whip, I<br/>
&gt;would have been thumped soundly. The problem is those songs are area<br/>
&gt;effect. You wouldn&#39;t believe the hatred mobs feel for bards, but thats a<br/>
&gt;rant for another list.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As for bards pulling, all the songs are low level ones as already posted.<br/>
&gt;In fact only a handful of bard songs over 20 are any good, which is why I<br/>
&gt;dont play him much these days.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>ok, so i suck and haven&#39;t been delving too much into switching weapons<br/>
and instruments in combat.  but i&#39;m probly gonna start.  so do the instruments<br/>
have to be in the active slot just when the pulse goes off?  or just when you<br/>
start the song?  or for the whole time?<br/>
