&gt;P.S. 500p is a reasonable amount to have SAVED up by level 18, but making<br/>
&gt;500p IN ONE DAY at level 19 is amazing, he may not wnat to give away his<br/>
&gt;secret, but what ever he is doing to make that kind of money I would like<br/>
&gt;to know...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, 500pp in ONE day isn&#39;t so hard.   Get lucky on a few rare spawns or <br/>
good loots (Runed Bone Fork, Chitin Shell tunic, etc), head to auction and <br/>
let the bidding commence.   500pp EVERY day at level 19 would be amazing!   <br/>
Of course then you get into rapid devaluation of platinum, mass <br/>
unemployment, famine, disease, pottery sketch fraud, etc., etc.<br/>
