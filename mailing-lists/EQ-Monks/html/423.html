Hey another thing while I&#39;m posting. What stats do the orange Headband give<br/>
you? I just got my white and it&#39;s a pretty handy item. Is it really worth<br/>
the trade from white to orange and so on? I&#39;v e seen some crappy quests that<br/>
have you turn in stuff for really useless items.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the help.<br/>
