<div id="ygrps-yiv-1365886610">Our role hasn&#39;t really changed all that much (I&#39;m speaking from the lvl 50 <br/>
point of view and pulling in the planes, and the harder mobs on Norrath.)  We <br/>
are still needed in PoH w/o a doubt.  I believe Verant has nerfed FD to what <br/>
they want it to be, which is just causing ppl to play more and items for high <br/>
lvls harder to get.  This is extremely evident in the drop percentage of <br/>
plane armor.  When PoF first opened, armor dropped quite often, now you can <br/>
get groups of 18 to 30 ppl on a plane, spend 18 hours plus and get maybe 5 to <br/>
7 drops total.  Verant is just tryin to make more money off us, and that is <br/>
where my major gripe is.  There are various ways around FD pulling technique. <br/>
 Pulling to a &#39;safe&#39; spot and waiting til one mob is left, then have an <br/>
archer shoot that one mob and pull it. This makes it so the monk cannot fight <br/>
though the entire battle.  Then we stand up, the aggroed monsters run back to <br/>
us at the &#39;safe&#39; spot and we FD again, having the archer pull one more when <br/>
it is left.  This method is the safest, but the most boring for us.  Another <br/>
method is to have an enchanter along.  The monk pulls to the &#39;safe&#39; spot, and <br/>
has to wait until ALL aggroed mobs are on him, then FD.  The enchanter cast <br/>
their AE mem blur, and the monk waits until one mob is left, then pull it.  <br/>
This will not work on PoF, as the enchanter will be aggroed before being in <br/>
range to cast the spell.  It is also dangerous if ALL the mobs aggroed to the <br/>
monk are not in area of the spell.  So in standing will cause the ones not in <br/>
range to aggro again and pull everything in the way on you again.  This <br/>
allows the monk to participate in the battle but is riskier.  No longer are <br/>
we able to pull AND fight, so we don&#39;t contribute nearly as much to a group <br/>
anymore.  Oh, and on a side note, FD DOES NOT work like they have said on <br/>
mobs lvl 35+.  From personal experience, I have FD 15 to 20 times in a row <br/>
and still have mobs aggroing me that are no where near line of sight.  The <br/>
whole FD nerf and it&#39;s excuse for one is just a ploy by Verant to stall for <br/>
the expansion, and for this reason as all others everyone has, I plead with <br/>
you to continue to write in feedback to have FD put back to it&#39;s original <br/>
status.  We were once also instrumental in corpse recovery, but having mobs <br/>
continued aggro, now it is near impossible unless the dungeon is a low lvl <br/>
for the lvls involved.  I could go on and on, but it would take hours to <br/>
write out all the feelings I have on this subject.<br/>
