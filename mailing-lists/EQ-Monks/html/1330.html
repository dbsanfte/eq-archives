<div id="ygrps-yiv-103748713">My weight is rarely over 10lbs too.  I use 3 beltpouches for my storange, <br/>
and a large sewing kit.  And truthfully, I don&#39;t make most of my money from <br/>
my loot.  My looting policy is, if its not really expencive or really light, <br/>
hopefully stackable, or most important of use to me, I usually just destroy <br/>
it.  I figure let the casters and tanks and most importantly the healers <br/>
take most of the expensive heavy loot, as they need the money well more than <br/>
I do.  I can make my money other ways...<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;I generally am at 14 or so... of course I carry an Sewn Evil Eye Pack<br/>
&gt;(3wt) and a few Large bags which are 1 wt each<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I know its very un-monk of me but I have never abided by the 14 stone<br/>
&gt;rule.  By this I mean that many monks will never loot past 14 stones but<br/>
&gt;I think thats stupid and you will never make money.  Sure your losing AC<br/>
&gt;and can potentially die faster but its a risk you take to actually make<br/>
&gt;some money in the game.  I am currently fighting in High Keep which<br/>
&gt;rules because its a short job upstairs to the bank =)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyone, personally I would never take 2ac for and additional 2.4 wt...<br/>
&gt;one thing that is important for monks is ac/wt ration, not ac in itself<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Cured Silk Shoulders: 3ac 0.1wt  30ac/wt<br/>
&gt;Lizardscale Mantle: 5ac 2.5wt 2ac/wt<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In that respect it is much more favorable to take the shoulders<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Its all a matter of preference though<br/>
