<div id="ygrps-yiv-367982846">EXACTLY.<br/>
<br/>
Monk Damage/delay is BALANCED in such a way that we do an appropriate<br/>
amount of damage.  It is a valid point that realistically, monks would<br/>
punch faster than almost any weapon in the game but in order to enable us<br/>
to do this variant would have to lower the damage on our fists to a level<br/>
where we would become ineffective againts heavily armored openents or<br/>
oponents with a damage shield/barb coat effect effect on.  <br/>
<br/>
SUPER WEAPON COMPARISON:<br/>
<br/>
MOnks are by design an egalitarian class - EVERY monk at levle 40 has the<br/>
same skills, simila hp, ac, and max damge.  Items we wear will be similar<br/>
as well. This is nice because we do not have to camp and get parties<br/>
together to help us get those weapons.  But, this is balanced by the fact<br/>
that with store bought or common drop equipment we are able to do massive<br/>
amounts of damge - more than anyohter mele class withouth the use of magic<br/>
wepons. But it a valid observation that a ranger/warrior with 2<br/>
Uberweapons will probably outdamge us - but not by as much as you think.<br/>
ALso, I think that this ability of rangers/paladin/warriors to obtain<br/>
super weapons to enable them to do MAssive amounts of damage is part of<br/>
the design of these classes.  They are weak without their equipment, while<br/>
we are strong.  They must camp and endure HELL in order to obtain good<br/>
items, monks can lead a stress free life of hunting and adventuring<br/>
without a care in the world.  I think it is a matter of personal choice<br/>
which class is better.<br/>
<br/>
FOR EXAMPLE:<br/>
<br/>
A RAnger with 2 Ykesha balades will hit for a max damage around 25dmg<br/>
(assuming level 40 or so) the delay on his weapon is 24 - this means he<br/>
does one attack round every 2.4 seconds.  In a max damage attack round the<br/>
ranger will do a DA/DW for 4 attacks of 25dmge, kick for about 20 dmge,<br/>
and then the ykesha effect will go off for 70dmge - resulting in a total<br/>
of 190dmge for this round.  NOTE: If anyone ever sees a non monk hit for<br/>
their max damage 4 times in a row let me know - IT IS JUST NOT GOING TO<br/>
HAPPEN!<br/>
<br/>
A level 40 monk will hit for max damge of 36 or more, also monk damage is<br/>
more steady - I have watched monk friends hit for close to their maximum<br/>
damage for several attacks in a row! (almost like those NPC&#39;s who seem to<br/>
hit for their max damge every singel hit.)<br/>
<br/>
In a maximum attack round a monk will deal the following damage (level 40<br/>
monk): DA/DW for 4 attacks of 36dmge, Flying kick for 95 dmge. Resulting<br/>
total damage is 239dmge. NOt a bad chunk of damge!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Bear in mind that the monk is far more likely to come close to the dream<br/>
round that I described here - for some reason our damage seems to be more<br/>
consistent than for other classes.  I play both a paladin and my monk and<br/>
I have found that when my Paladins max damge with his Gigantic Zweihander<br/>
is 55, he will tipically hit monsters for only  upper 30&#39;s dmage range.<br/>
MOnk damge at level 40 AVERAGEs to 30 per hit. ALso we monks have a higher<br/>
DW skill than any other class so we will get those nice Quad attacks more<br/>
often.<br/>
<br/>
And lastly I would like to poitn out that as a monk, we didnt have to go<br/>
with 3 groups of levle 45 friends to camp for a Ykesha balde or sit there<br/>
for days waiting on the GHoulbane to spawn.  In short monks dont have to<br/>
camp or go through hardship for their weapons/equipment.  ALL level 40<br/>
monks will be able to do the 239 (or there abouts depening on their str)<br/>
max damge round.  <br/>
<br/>
COmpare a monk to a ranger with two less powerfull more common swordes and<br/>
we win the damge contest hands down!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; That&#39;s not the case, in actuality.  A friend of mine (who has been heavily<br/>
&gt; into martial arts (karate and aikido) since he was 12 (I thnk) punches damn<br/>
&gt; hard and damn fast.  He was back from Seattle (he&#39;s studying under an aikido<br/>
&gt; master (one of the students of the founder of the art) recently and was<br/>
&gt; teaching some classes and giving some demonstrations.  I used to think<br/>
&gt; boxers could throw punches fast.  You couldn&#39;t count the punches, and<br/>
&gt; sometimes the only way you knew he threw one was the &lt;wham&gt; coming from the<br/>
&gt; the target an assistant was holding.  Speed is vital to getting your punches<br/>
&gt; to connect.  If they&#39;re slow, they are REALLY easy to block or dodge, since<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s easy to figure out the person&#39;s reach.  They also do more damage the<br/>
&gt; faster the fist is travelling.  Good old momentum and inertia. To be<br/>
&gt; realistic.. monks would have a LOT quicker punches but still do the same<br/>
&gt; damage.  I&#39;d guess a delay around 22 or so, comparing it to other weapons<br/>
&gt; (magic mostly) in the game.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Of course, that will never happen as we&#39;d become the ubermelee class.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Well, if you really think about it, it is possiblef or someone to poke a<br/>
&gt; lot<br/>
&gt; &gt; faster then a person can punch.  If you consider since monks have to put<br/>
&gt; &gt; some strength into the punch, their speed can&#39;t be too fast.  But on the<br/>
&gt; &gt; other hand, warrior types can upgrade their weapons, in both damage and<br/>
&gt; &gt; speed, monks only get upgrades in damage, i&#39;d like to see us get a speed<br/>
&gt; &gt; upgrade too.  Because if a person wields a pain bringer and a ykesha, they<br/>
&gt; &gt; will easily outdamage a monk, because both of the weapons are sub 30<br/>
&gt; delay,<br/>
&gt; &gt; pain bringer is closer to 20.  Nonetheless, monks are supposed to be the<br/>
&gt; &gt; ultimate melee dishers, that makes up for the extreme hp loss.<br/>
