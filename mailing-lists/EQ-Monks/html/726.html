As part of the Purple Headband quest, I recently was able to acquire Zaharn&#39;s Coronet from within Permafrost.  I&#39;ve been holding the Dagger of Marnek for some time now, just waiting for the day when I could obtain the coronet (it being the hardest item of the 3 to get).  Now I am left with needing the final component, the Skull of Jhen&#39;Tra.  At first I auctioned for one, not sure if I had the energy to adventure to a strange land and attempt to find it.  But now I think that I shall!<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have any tips on this mob (Which Gnoll Embalmer? Level needed?) and it&#39;s resident zone (Lake Rathe?).<br/>
<br/>
Any information would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
