<div id="ygrps-yiv-1862414716">Damn you guys got me all nervous now! LOL. Seriously, I prob wouldnt try it <br/>
until atleast you havw 200+hp, I bound in grobb and NEVER had a problem <br/>
getting out or killed. Sometimes I would get wacked for 96 twice but no <br/>
more, I NEVER TOOK OVER 200pts at 12th level in dmg. At 7th though he might <br/>
deal you 150 a pop though. I dontn lie, it is dangerous, but I can testify <br/>
at 12th and up it isnt a prob. Both of my monk brothers ae bound in grobb <br/>
and neither has had a problem getting out either. Its a game, take a <br/>
chance!, bind in GROBB, but never ever piss off a shin shaman, it&#39;s <br/>
humiliating being rooted and beat down!!!!!</div>
