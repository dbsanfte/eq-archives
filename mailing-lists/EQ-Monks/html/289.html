<div id="ygrps-yiv-376477087">Western Plains of Karana might be OK at level 7 (I&#39;m blanking on when I <br/>
started hunting there, but I think it was 7 or 8). Stay close to the guard <br/>
towers, and look for Mist Wolves, Young Lionesses, Brown Bears and possibly <br/>
Young Lions.<br/>
<br/>
The guards will attack everything you&#39;ll run into (unless you&#39;re unlucky <br/>
enough to find a wandering bandit) so you should be able to survive the <br/>
occasional grizzly attack as long as you run for cover straight away :)<br/>

&gt; &gt; OK.  I am a 7th level monk travelling through the Qeynos area on the new<br/>
&gt; &gt; Tribunal server.  I&#39;ve run into a stump, though.  It seems to me that<br/>
&gt; &gt; everything in the area is now either conning green or conning yellow <br/>
&gt;(few<br/>
&gt; &gt; and far between).  However, if I go to different zones, it&#39;s instant red<br/>
&gt; &gt; cons.  Any suggestions on getting over this level hump?<br/>
