<div id="ygrps-yiv-309903179">They nerfed the gnome toy drops?  When was this?<br/>
<br/>
I remember when Kerra Isle reopened it took me 5<br/>
minutes to do that quest.  Got a druid, tp to<br/>
steamfont, 1 minute run to mino area, track one down,<br/>
kill, tp to tox, turn it in and wahoo.<br/>
<br/>
Sucks that they nerfed it =(  I told everyone I knew<br/>
to do it fast because there was no telling what Verant<br/>
would do to it.<br/>
