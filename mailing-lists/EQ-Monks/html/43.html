<div id="ygrps-yiv-1235774166">I played a Monk up to level 8 and am now thinking that I messed up pretty <br/>
bad on wasting experience on combat stuff when you really shouldn&#39;t bother. <br/>
I have now decided to start a new Monk at Freeport (because, holy cow, is it <br/>
long and tedious to look for beasts around Karana. My questions:<br/>
<br/>
1. What is final word on starting Str and Agil? How much in each? If you <br/>
higher up guys could go back and re-do it what would you pick?<br/>
2. Is there any trade skill that I should concentrate on that would be a big <br/>
benifit to my guy for money etc?<br/>
<br/>
Any advice or other tips would be appreciated - I definately do not want to <br/>
run another up levels again.</div>
