<div id="ygrps-yiv-1624588788">The swamp is fantastic if you watch out for Lynunga, the Troll Slayer, the<br/>
Troll Captain, and all the Troll Guards, they&#39;ll KOS ya.  However, the swamp<br/>
has TONS of froglocks (watch out for mobs and trains) ranging from newbie at<br/>
the far end of the swamp from where you enter to froglock foragers and<br/>
kobold hunters where you come in.  Then, after you hit about 15th level, go<br/>
deep into guk and get the good stuff.<br/>

just made the run from Qeynos to Freeport and N. Ro isn&#39;t all that<br/>
terribly exciting. Also, I initially MADE the run as an interim step<br/>
to Innothule/Guk, strictly for netted stuff.  (And Woven.  And Mesh.<br/>
Both of which are in desperate short supply in Qeynos.)<br/>
<br/>
Where do you guys all hunt? I&#39;m only 9&#39;th level so I may be somewhat<br/>
limited in my choices, but would love to hear what you all are<br/>
doing/have done.<br/>
