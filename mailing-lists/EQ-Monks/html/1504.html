Much camping???  Much Camping????????  You reported about 21 hours max on it. <br/>
 Let&#39;s see...Runnyeye was no time for me.  Goblin alchemist in Misty Thicket <br/>
was 7 hours, I was happy.  Goblin alchemist in Beholder is currently at 78 <br/>
hours and still waiting.  And I know several monks out there have beaten me <br/>
in time (wish them dern iksar scaled gloves were less of weight).</div>
