 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s the thing.  In EQ, there&#39;s not supposed to be a BEST class.  Each and<br/>
every class will have its ups and downs, and, in the end, we all need each<br/>
other.  Sure, there might be imbalances at times, but I don&#39;t think you&#39;re going<br/>
to find a lot of groups refusing you just because you&#39;re a monk.  If they do,<br/>
you probably didn&#39;t want to group with them anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I love playing a monk.  Not because we&#39;re the BEST class in the game<br/>
or do more melee damage than anyone else, but because the monk class is one of<br/>
the most unique classes in the game.  Who else dishes out as much damage as we<br/>
do with their bare hands?  Who else has as much AC as we do while wearing plain<br/>
looking clothes? (Yes, I _like_ looking ordinary.)  Who else has a cool flying<br/>
kick?  Who else (besides rogues) can jump from Kelethin and survive?  For me, <br/>
playing a monk is enjoyable not because I&#39;m the best figher in the game, but <br/>
because monks are unique and fun to roleplay.<br/>
<br/>
But then, that&#39;s just my opinion.  Go forth, and form your own.<br/>
