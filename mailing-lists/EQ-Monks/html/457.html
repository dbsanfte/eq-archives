<div id="ygrps-yiv-205319743">That&#39;s not the case, in actuality.  A friend of mine (who has been heavily<br/>
into martial arts (karate and aikido) since he was 12 (I thnk) punches damn<br/>
hard and damn fast.  He was back from Seattle (he&#39;s studying under an aikido<br/>
master (one of the students of the founder of the art) recently and was<br/>
teaching some classes and giving some demonstrations.  I used to think<br/>
boxers could throw punches fast.  You couldn&#39;t count the punches, and<br/>
sometimes the only way you knew he threw one was the &lt;wham&gt; coming from the<br/>
the target an assistant was holding.  Speed is vital to getting your punches<br/>
to connect.  If they&#39;re slow, they are REALLY easy to block or dodge, since<br/>
it&#39;s easy to figure out the person&#39;s reach.  They also do more damage the<br/>
faster the fist is travelling.  Good old momentum and inertia. To be<br/>
realistic.. monks would have a LOT quicker punches but still do the same<br/>
damage.  I&#39;d guess a delay around 22 or so, comparing it to other weapons<br/>
(magic mostly) in the game.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, that will never happen as we&#39;d become the ubermelee class.<br/>

&gt; some strength into the punch, their speed can&#39;t be too fast.  But on the<br/>
&gt; other hand, warrior types can upgrade their weapons, in both damage and<br/>
&gt; speed, monks only get upgrades in damage, i&#39;d like to see us get a speed<br/>
&gt; upgrade too.  Because if a person wields a pain bringer and a ykesha, they<br/>
&gt; will easily outdamage a monk, because both of the weapons are sub 30<br/>

&gt; ultimate melee dishers, that makes up for the extreme hp loss. </span></blockquote></div>
