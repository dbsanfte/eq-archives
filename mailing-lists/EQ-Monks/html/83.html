<div id="ygrps-yiv-1438130790">Greetings all,<br/>
<br/>
I found that the low weight ac thing was not really an<br/>
issue till I got to 12th lvl then I slowly started<br/>
taking off my leather armor and replacing it with<br/>
lighter components here and there.<br/>
<br/>
At lvl 18 I still carry some heavy stuff with me...<br/>
though my weight without stars and bandages is 14<br/>
now... I am still after one more Mesh bracer... a<br/>
lighter cloak some lighter shoulder pads... though I<br/>
have a great weight as it is<br/>
<br/>
I found though that from 12th up it started making a<br/>
difference... not much at first but slowly ever lvl<br/>
the bonus for low weight was more and more...<br/>
<br/>
I wish you all well<br/>
