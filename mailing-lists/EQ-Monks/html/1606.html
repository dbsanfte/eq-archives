<div id="ygrps-yiv-258913839">Well after a week in fear, I got 1 bracer, 2 gloves, 2 arms, 2 legs.<br/>
Most of the time I was the only monk in fear (or even close to fear) so<br/>
I got to loot whatever dropped, and I got doubles when the corpses were<br/>
going to &quot;poof&quot;. I got most of it in the first night. The last 2 nights<br/>
1 bracer dropped and I let the other monk who was there have it. In the<br/>
times I missed, I heard of 2 jerkins and 1 pair of boots dropping.<br/>
<br/>
Only 1 bracer, a jerkin and boots to go. And infact I only want the<br/>
boots.<br/>
<br/>
How common are the boots usually ? (weren&#39;t very common this last week<br/>
;p).<br/>
<br/>
What parts drop off of chests in hate ?<br/>
Do the boots drop off phobos ?</div>
