<div id="ygrps-yiv-1778157798"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;         The Bard is the one pulling. He will be taking the brunt of the<br/>
&gt;damage while the Enchanter does Crowd Control. They will stay on the Bard<br/>
&gt;because he is the one that pulled them and because those Songs piss Mobs<br/>
&gt;off. If the Wizards use /assist they will be taking out what the Bard has<br/>
&gt;targeted. Enchanter will use Mesmerization for AoE Crowd Control and there<br/>
&gt;should only be 1 fighting at a time. You are quite mistaken about this<br/>
&gt;group. This is the MOST powerful group that you can have. There is no other<br/>
&gt;group that will do more damage in a shorter amount of time. It is not right<br/>
&gt;for every situation, but it is the best for most situations.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This still seems iffy to me, especially if you pull more than two mobs, and<br/>
they get lucky around of resisting....<br/>

I wouldn&#39;t feel comfortable without a dedicated melee class to start bash&#39;n<br/>
and distract&#39;n.<br/>
