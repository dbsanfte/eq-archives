<div id="ygrps-yiv-347178112">I&#39;ve heard that Kobald hide boots are good.  They give a AGI, and a HP<br/>
bonus, but don&#39;t quote me on that.  I think they are found in Guk somewhere.<br/>
I never seem they myself, that&#39;s just what i heard soemwhere.<br/>

&gt; blue Keds you had back in 2nd grade.  Seeing as there is no &#39;mesh boots&#39;<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; anything of that ilk, I was wondering what was out there that was<br/>
&gt; monk-friendly (i.e. low weight).  AC is obviouly desireable, although<br/>
&gt; anything that could offer other bonuses (stat increase, resistances, etc.)<br/>
&gt; would be wonderful.<br/>
&gt; Suggestions, advices, personal experiences appreciated...<br/>
