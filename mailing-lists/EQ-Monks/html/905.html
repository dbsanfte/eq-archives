<div id="ygrps-yiv-1419502620"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; 1.  Do monks get better at resisting stun effects as they get higher in<br/>
&gt; level or is the idea just not to get hit?  IF there were a class that could<br/>
&gt; roll with the punches, I figured Monks would be it, followed closely by<br/>
&gt; warriors.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>nope.  you get better at resisting, but the mobs you fight get better at<br/>
stunning.  orcs of all level (so far) stun me<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; 2.  Do any of the higher level monk attacks include some sort of stun<br/>
&gt; ability?  Why should only warriors, ogres and trolls get a bash?  If not,<br/>
&gt; it would be nice if we did.  Some sort of Nerve strike or punch to stun an<br/>
&gt; opponent or some sort of Judo throw to knock them off balance.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>no stun. according to brad, monks are too powerfull as it is (at higher<br/>
levels)<br/>

&gt; 3.  Has anyone run into the following problem:  I was fighting downstairs<br/>
&gt; in Blackburrow.  Some high level weenie was having fun creating trains of<br/>
&gt; various levels of gnolls and pulling them into the rest area and then<br/>
&gt; standing back and watching us lower level characters live or die by our own<br/>
&gt; skills.  I was jumped by 4 elite gnoll guards and gave a good accounting of<br/>
&gt; myself before dieing.  I was a bit mad, but ran back to get my body.  To my<br/>
&gt; surpise, it wasn&#39;t there.  I was grouped with several people.  They said<br/>
&gt; they could see my body, but I couldn&#39;t.  I re-logeed and it was not there.<br/>
&gt; I consented to have someone loot my body.  They began to hadn me my things,<br/>
&gt; when another train arrived.  I managed to outrun the train and we both hot<br/>
&gt; footed it to the zone.  Lo and behold, there was my body, in front of the<br/>
&gt; zone line.  It had my remaining items.  What is going on? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>zone bugs happen, sometimes your corspe can drop beneith the world...if<br/>
you cant find it do a /petition<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 4.  Is there anyway to prevent a PC thief from picking your pockets? ( He<br/>
&gt; was a PC, because I wasn&#39;t allowed to attack him, even though he was my<br/>
&gt; current target.)  I see this as having a negative effect on my character.<br/>
&gt; If they can effect my character in a negative way, why can&#39;t I do the same<br/>
&gt; to them?  A quick kick or throw would end that problem.   I have a hard<br/>
&gt; time believing that some Shadowknight or Necro is going to stand there<br/>
&gt; while some little sneak thief makes off with their hard earned money or<br/>
&gt; items.  It wouldn&#39;t have been so bad if they hadn&#39;t taunted me about it and<br/>
&gt; then run off.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the theif was playing with you.  he didnt actually steal anything</div>
