<b>Subject:</b> Patch day is this wednesday! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1646438106">I am told that Patch day is this wednesday and with it will come HASTE for monks<br/>
aswell as afew other enhancements (some still being kept secret)  I am also told<br/>
that the treant fists will gain a Proc in this patch.  Anyone got any word on<br/>
that or was I just being fed a baseless rumor?<br/>
<br/>
Personnally I am looking forward to the enhancements and have already started<br/>
camping for my treant fist items.</div>
