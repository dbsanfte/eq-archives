<div id="ygrps-yiv-100796216">OK, here is my understanding on what they can do with new stuff....<br/>
First off, races that don&#39;t have mage-types, can not wear robes, period,<br/>
same with barbarian shields....<br/>
Secondly, I think the nunchucks would have that same problem...<br/>
However, a blue tunic should be a very small if any download, as it is just<br/>
changing a color (Like an enchanter that is using illusion: Non-robe wearing<br/>
class), a whole new texture would probably be tougher...<br/>
The monk gloves though would be great, all the other melee classes get cool<br/>
weapons with effects, monks get Mesh gloves : /<br/>
Although knowing Verant, the gloves would have Effect:  Minor Heal or<br/>
Effect:  Grasping Roots (Horrible root spell, resisted a lot, ask druids, it<br/>
does damage and roots, so it is resisted more...)  Too bad you couldn&#39;t get<br/>
flaming fists ; )<br/>

&gt;&gt;It&#39;s a little late to change the looks of characters (i.e.: adding the<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;&gt;look to monks with a mesh tunic, etc) because it would require a total<br/>
&gt;&gt;rework of the art files. Anyone remember those lovely 300 meg downloads in<br/>
&gt;&gt;beta 3?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m not sure I understand this.  Didn&#39;t they add an entire zone (or maybe<br/>
&gt;it&#39;s even more than one zone, I don&#39;t know), the plane of fear?  Did we<br/>
&gt;download everything necessary for that zone?  If so, I find it difficult to<br/>
&gt;believe that a few new texture would be that large an addition.<br/>
