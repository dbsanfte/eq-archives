<div id="ygrps-yiv-972685798">Excuse me, I&#39;m new to the list so I&#39;ve missed a whole lot of what&#39;s been<br/>
said on the topic of twinking. I personally am not into twinking. An<br/>
item I earn means a whole lot more to me than an item I&#39;m given, but<br/>
that&#39;s all personal preference. From a game play point there are a few<br/>
problems with twinking that all those twinkers out there need to<br/>
realize. YOU ARE STUNTING YOUR GROWTH. Literally. I have a friend who<br/>
opted for the easy way out and bought a bunch of cool stuff off of<br/>
e-bay. Anything you want is for sale there for a price. So he gets some<br/>
really nice armor and stuff to raise his AC way up and his Stats as<br/>
well. Now he&#39;s taking on anything that cons white to him and kicking<br/>
butt. Leveling is no problem but... because he is so hard to hit at his<br/>
level from artificially raised stats his abilities are going up real<br/>
slow. Most things don&#39;t hit him and his dodge, block and defense are not<br/>
going up 5 points per level. He&#39;s lucky if they go up 2 or 3. He hits<br/>
for so much damage that he&#39;s only raising his offense, double attack and<br/>
special attack 2 or 3 per level also. At low level this isn&#39;t much of a<br/>
problem, but there will come a time when he&#39;s higher level that all the<br/>
non-twinkers catch up to him in items, but he won&#39;t be equal with them<br/>
in abilities. Imagine being a 20th level Monk with only Above Average<br/>
Offense and Defense instead of Master. Still, if you don&#39;t mind the<br/>
problems it will cause you at higher levels, then go ahead and twink<br/>
away, but please come and duel with me when we both hit 30.....<br/>
