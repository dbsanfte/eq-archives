<div id="ygrps-yiv-951104176">maybe FD pulling itself is an exploit?  maybe verant never intended the <br/>
monk class<br/>
to be able to break spawns by fd pulling?  maybe they just intended it as a <br/>
&#39;&#39;get out<br/>
of death free&#39;&#39; card for the individual monk?  I personally think some <br/>
spawns should<br/>
not be able to be broken since it makes the game too easy.<br/>

&gt;     I just wanted to let you know about the AC issue and monks.  We do have<br/>
&gt;as good AC as warriors.  At lvl 50, my AC is 824 base, and that&#39;s not with my<br/>
&gt;tankin gear, I can easily bump it up to over 850.<br/>
&gt;     Now for my lil rant.  HOW can you say using FD pulling was exploiting on<br/>
&gt;the planes??  Do you know what happens now?  Even more of a cheat if you ask<br/>
&gt;me.  Just takes longer, cause now after FD, you just need to /exit and wait 3<br/>
&gt;min before loggin back into the server.  I have been lvl 50 for about 2 or 3<br/>
&gt;months now, and this nerf has seriously hurt our skills.  We are pullers,<br/>
&gt;that is our main contribution to a party after we get FD and hone our skills.<br/>
&gt;  We can still do this job, but it makes it MUCH more difficult and time<br/>
&gt;comsuming.  Yes you can get around it, BUT, IMHO, I now think we have to use<br/>
&gt;more of a cheat to get around it.  There are other ways, yes, but WHY (and<br/>
&gt;believe me, I&#39;ve sent in MANY feedbacks and petitions) did Verant change this<br/>
&gt;skill.  Okay, I&#39;m done, thanks for listening all.<br/>
