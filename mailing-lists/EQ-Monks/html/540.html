The Nybright sisters will serve as no obstacle to one of your training. Even<br/>
through fourteen orders of training, I have considered them less than equal to<br/>
the task of one on one combat. Your abilities are best served in the undead<br/>
depths of Unrest or the outlying Cauldron. It would be my hope that no monk<br/>
among us would go so far as to take the life of a fellow human in order to<br/>
gain<br/>
some modicum of advancement. Our talents are best reserved for defending those<br/>
less fortunate from the hordes of undead and staving off attacks from those<br/>
beast that are less civilized than we and which aggressively pursue us<br/>
unprovoked. I wish you good fortune in your travels. <br/>
