<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1194651595">I have recently acquired an item which I was told is Marnek&#39;s wand.<br/>
However, I was under the impression that what was necessary to fulfil the<br/>
Monk&#39;s red sash quest are actually TWO PIECES of the Wand of the Burning<br/>
Dead.  I therefore expected to be needing two different inventory items.  I<br/>
asked somebody on-line about this, and he showed me his own Red Sash and<br/>
told me that the whole wand is what he used.<br/>
	Can somebody confirm this for me?  I&#39;m a little (well, a lot) leery<br/>
of gambling this whole wand as well as my sash (not to mention the<br/>
still-to-be-obtained saphire) when I turn them in for the Red sash.<br/>
	Oh yeah, one more thing.  I&#39;ve recently put both my orange sash and<br/>
orange headband in the bank and wend with mesh articles in their stead.<br/>
The theory is that the AC (and damage dissipation) they offer more than<br/>
offsets the small stat bonuses provided by the quest items - not to mention<br/>
the fact that we can&#39;t even proudly display these thins as we walk around.<br/>
Is anybody else of this opinion as well?  At what point would the<br/>
sash/headband properties outweigh mesh&#39;s?<br/>
