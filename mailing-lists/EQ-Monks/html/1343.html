<div id="ygrps-yiv-297872560"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
&gt;Let me tell you a few things.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Monks are without any doubt the MOST difficult class in the game to<br/>
&gt;twink.  Equipment is not very helpful for us.  The only thing that would<br/>
&gt;really help at low levels is AC and hit points.  Getting an additional<br/>
&gt;10 hit points at level 1 gives you about 20% more hp.  AC isn&#39;t that<br/>
&gt;important anyway unless you do some MAJOR AC twinking.  For example,<br/>
&gt;that serp bracer would be worthless to a level 5 character.  The would<br/>
&gt;have an EXTREMELY minimal advantage over a monk with full cloth.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Just my thoughts... I had a friend who twinked his monk, level 1 he had<br/>
&gt;2 serp bracers, azure sleeves, foremans, wolf fur slippers, jagged<br/>
&gt;bands.  Still died just as often as without the stuff.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;-- <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wasn&#39;t speaking of monks in general.  I was talking about twinking and a<br/>
possible way to solve the problem.  If Verant thought it was a problem,<br/>
they could solve it.<br/>
