I beleive this to be the most insightful statement yet regarding the position of<br/>
twinking vs. nontwinking.  As much as I&#39;ve appreciated most of your candor and am<br/>
somewhat put off by EvilJohn&#39;s approach, I believe he has a valid point.  I believe<br/>
the crux of his premise ( and John, correct me if I&#39;m wrong) for gameplay rests on<br/>
the fact that he plays within the context of the game without violating any rules.<br/>
If your main problem with his actions are that he should not &quot;twink&quot; because of game<br/>
ethics, then I would say you are incorrect.  EvilJohn, in fact, is acting very much<br/>
within the ethics of the game as set out by Verant; namely, he is using whatever<br/>
means he finds most desirable to achieve satisfaction in gaming without breaking the<br/>
rules.<br/>
<br/>
If, however, you are saying that Verant should themselves reconsider their current<br/>
position on twinking and set more stringent regulations, that is another matter<br/>
entirely.  I would also have to agree with John on this point, but for another<br/>
reasoning as this is a separate question.  In order to explain my opposition to<br/>
banning PC twinking, I must first remind ourselves the framework for the issue we<br/>
are all discussing.  We are, in effect, all participating in a computer assisted<br/>
role-playing game.  Because of this, I believe we should analyze the problem of<br/>
twinking through these lenses.  In a standard, run of the mill fantasy RPG, there is<br/>
a framework of rules that are used to guide players and GM in play, not unlike EQ.<br/>
In a standard RPG, the players are allowed to do whatever they will so long as it<br/>
fits within the reality (i.e. the rules) of the game, AND it is in character for<br/>
them to do so.<br/>
<br/>
My question, therefore, to you all is this:  would twinking be a conceivable<br/>
possiblity in most standard fantasy RPGs?  Yes, it would.  OF course it would be, in<br/>
fact.  In fact, this whole argument reminds me of a similar debate many years ago I<br/>
had the pleasure of being involved with at GenCon.  It was concerning GMs and<br/>
players who would make EXTREMELY powerful characters out of thin air, rather than<br/>
starting them from scratch at Lvl 1.  It also concerned GMs giving away magic items<br/>
and powers like candy to players.   My position was simply, that&#39;s just bad<br/>
roleplaying, not rule violation.<br/>
<br/>
And so it is also with twinking.  In any RPG, standard or computer assisted, there<br/>
are two things we must weigh:  one is rule integrity.  The other is character<br/>
integrity.  As a GM, I personally made my players fight to get everything they<br/>
earned, only by my personal preference to the way i like to play the most.  I would<br/>
almost never put players together with characters of vastly different levels in<br/>
order to balance gameplay and make campaigns easier to formulate.  HOWEVER,  if my<br/>
players were resourceful enough to connive, coerce, entice, seduce, or otherwise<br/>
persuade someone to relinquish either favors or items to them, well, that was well<br/>
within their rights.  In fact, they would usually get xp for such resourcefulness.<br/>
<br/>
I see the real difference here is that EQ has several hundred PCs at one time while<br/>
a standard RPG has much fewer.  Thus, the opportunity to be exposed to other PCs of<br/>
high level are significantly increased.   The GMs in EQ (ie the designers)  wanted<br/>
the world to be like this; that&#39;s why they made it this way.    Since EQ is a<br/>
simulated reality, let&#39;s lok at it this way--- is it POSSIBLE that there would be<br/>
characters, NPC and/or PC alike, who were of the benevolent sort, preferring to give<br/>
much of their items away to those less fortunate?  Of course there would be; in<br/>
fact, there is already.   The problem I believe we must all wrestle with here is:<br/>
DOES EITHER TWINKING MYSELF OR TWINKING OTHERS FIT WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE<br/>
DISPOSITION OF MY CHARACTER?  Personally, my monk Kilsan is a very friendly and<br/>
generous sort.  If he has copper on him and runs into a beggar, he will most likely<br/>
stop and give him some to help with the beggar&#39;s food.  He also likes to chat,<br/>
especially with strange new beings to him.   He also believes in work incentives and<br/>
discipline (he is, after all, a monk), so I believe he would not be prone to random<br/>
twinking just because.  Frugality is a virtue to him.  Poor stewardship is not.<br/>
<br/>
Let me conclude by giving one more example.   A is a 35th lvl shadowknight with some<br/>
serious gear.  His offline friend B has just started playing and really likes<br/>
Paladins, so he starts out and makes his way up, slowly but sure, to lvl 3.   Since<br/>
A and B are real life buddies, A decides to help B out and gives him 500 pp to help<br/>
him get outfitted.  Does A violate any rules?  No.  Does A make a terible choice in<br/>
roleplaying his character?  I believe so, and I&#39;m sure most of you would agree.<br/>
<br/>
So what is my suggestion for all of this?  I believe it would be in Verant&#39;s best<br/>
interest to approach this situation not from the stance that &quot;twinking&quot; is fair or<br/>
unfair.  Rather, I believe they need to approace it with the viewpoint: &quot;Let&#39;s<br/>
reward those who roleplay well.&quot;    How do we do that?  I leave that matter to the<br/>
rest of you, and I&#39;d love to hear your thoughts/views!<br/>
