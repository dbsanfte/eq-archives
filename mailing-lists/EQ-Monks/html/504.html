<div id="ygrps-yiv-651858365">Monks take a long time to come out, you are just starting to at lvl 26.  <br/>
Patience is really needed for our class.  You will begin to see significant <br/>
improvements soon, we get very nice dmg bonuses every 5 lvls, so you will see <br/>
another at lvl 30.  My guess is that the ranger and palidan had very good <br/>
equipment for their lvls.  Either they have been twinked or had to spend a <br/>
lot of time camping for their equipment.  I agree that there are a couple <br/>
things that need to be tweaked about monks, mainly a snare or stun.  And in <br/>
higher lvls, group will really love your FD pulling abilities.  I was <br/>
recently on a raid of Nagafen and who do you think pulled the FGs in the way? <br/>
 A monk, not me, but a lvl 49 and 50 monk.  Keep with it and you shall soon <br/>
see the benefits of monks.<br/>
