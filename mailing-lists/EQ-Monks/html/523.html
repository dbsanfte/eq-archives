<b>Subject:</b> Q&#39; about Netted/Mesh <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-422703748">Hail Brother&#39;s & Sisters,<br/>
  First of all I would like to say Thank you to the many people that take the time to answer Q&#39;s from new&#39;B players like myself, I hope you know that the info you share is very appreciated!.<br/>
 Now on to the Q&#39;s!<br/>
I have read many things about Netted/Mesh armor, and am planing to start &quot;Questing&quot; for some. What I need to know though is, is this armor somthing that I will actualy &quot;make&quot; (ex. making patch work armor out of hides) and if so, what do I need to do this? just a sewing kit, or do I need to use some of my traing ponits in a certain skill area?. I am now on the cusp of tenth LvL, Is that high enough to start hunting what ever creatures will &quot;give&quot; me netted/mesh?. Also, I am a Freeport monk, I hear much talk about the sewers of Qeynos (think that is the place) But nothing of were to hunt for the creatures I am looking for in my area. (Here is a VERY New&#39;b Q, If i do need to go to Qeynos, how do i get there, by boat or try it overland?) <br/>
I thank you all in advance for your time.<br/>
