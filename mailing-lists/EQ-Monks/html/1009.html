<div id="ygrps-yiv-895251517"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;   They always know where you are.  There is no way to escape a mob without<br/>
&gt;zoning.  Mobs are faster than PC&#39;s.  Mobs can hit a PC from a greater<br/>
&gt;distance.  Mobs are more resistant to magic.  Mobs have more HP than the<br/>
&gt;average PC of the same level.  Mobs do more damage than the average PC of<br/>
&gt;the same level. <br/>
 </span></blockquote>[yada yada yada]<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Mobs have<br/>
&gt;twice as much mana as a PC of their level.  Mobs have faster casting times.<br/>
&gt;MOBS HAVE MORE FRIENDS.  It is much harder to resist a mob&#39;s spell.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>[yada yada yada]<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;IS THIS FAIR?<br/>
&gt;IS THIS RIGHT?  WE CAN&#39;T EVEN RUN AWAY! HELL, MOBS ARE THE SUPERIOR RACE!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And yet, somehow, PC&#39;s always win. Always. There is not a single mob in the<br/>
game that players haven&#39;t beaten or will beat very soon. Not one.<br/>
<br/>
Just because you can&#39;t do it solo doesn&#39;t mean the game is unbalanced. If<br/>
you could solo Vox, teaming up with just one other person would make the<br/>
game completely boring.<br/>
<br/>
Do mobs have, in a roleplaying sense, unfair advantages? Sure. So what?<br/>
PC&#39;s beat them anyway. Verant has had to make mobs tougher, in fact,<br/>
because players were besting them too easily.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   Moving to a game like Shadowbane ( <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sb.drtwister.com">http://sb.drtwister.com</a> )  , where he<br/>
&gt;can CRUSH people instead of &quot;MOBS&quot; that are ridiculously more powerful than<br/>
&gt;himself.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In the mean time, why not play Ultima Online, power-level a character, and<br/>
sit just outside of town and PK newbies? Or find a poplular teleport spot<br/>
in a busy dungeon and &quot;Corp Por&quot; adventurers all day long. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll<br/>
find that much easier than fighting NPC mobs in EverQuest.<br/>
