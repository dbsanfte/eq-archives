<b>Subject:</b> Re: RE: That darn goblin alchemist. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2072907838">I&#39;ve now camped the middle camp for 9 hours, the single hut camp for 5 hours<br/>
(killed Mooto 9 times, warrior 6 times, shaman once).. and have not seen the<br/>
alchemist.  This is getting frustrating, since this is supposed to be the<br/>
&quot;short&quot; camp.<br/>
<br/>
Did the alchemist appear at the middle camp or did he walk over?<br/>
