	I recently hit 30 and you&#39;ll REALLY notice a difference when you get <br/>
there.  I think monks really just start to come out around lvl 25.  Seems <br/>
like I quadruple hit about every 5 attacks, if it&#39;s a good one, each punch is <br/>
over 20, plus a flying kick for around 50.  I have a friend who is 35, his <br/>
max dmg on a punch is close to 35 and can kick around 80.  Not to mention any <br/>
duel with a fighter type is really easy, just disarm them, they can&#39;t do <br/>
anything.  I&#39;ve seen one warrior able to do as much/more dmg than me a lvl <br/>
above me, but that&#39;s because he had an executioner&#39;s axe which is very rare.  <br/>
So keep fighting and you&#39;ll be able to see how we kick ass.  Oh, our hands <br/>
also become magical at 30, so you don&#39;t need to worry about netted/woven/mesh <br/>
gloves, go for ones with bonuses to them.<br/>
