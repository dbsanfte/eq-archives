&gt; There are many reasons I love playing a monk.  Yes we make great pullers.  <br/>
&gt; You can go to Rodcet Nife and anybody I&#39;ve grouped with who they think the <br/>
&gt; best puller is.  They will say a monk.  When I pull, there is no downtime, at <br/>
&gt; least for me.  If I&#39;m not fighting a mob, I&#39;m busy pulling one.  I haven&#39;t <br/>
&gt; grouped with anybody that can keep the pace like myself.  Another reason, I <br/>
&gt; love to dish out the damage.  At lvl 49 my max punch is 53, and kick 104, <br/>
&gt; without buffs.  The max dmg I&#39;ve done in one round, 4 punches and a kick, was <br/>
&gt; 224.  And this was to a lvl 45 mob, not some lil green guy.  Another thing <br/>
&gt; we&#39;re great at that isn&#39;t so fun is corpse recovery.  I can run into anywhere <br/>
&gt; and FD, change views and look for the corpse, if it&#39;s not there, stand, run, <br/>
&gt; FD, look.  Once you get the corpse, drag it where ever is needed.  I was on <br/>
&gt; PoF alone, running all over dragging corpses to the hill to be ressed when we <br/>
&gt; brought the cleric in.  Even if a mob aggros you, it will walk off after a <br/>
&gt; lil bit.  And if they come back when you stand up, you still have time to run <br/>
&gt; a ways until they get to you.  In LG, I don&#39;t need invis vs undead to get <br/>
&gt; out, or to get into a party already camping something.  Yes, it helps, but I <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t need it, just run, FD, wait, run again.  These are the reasons I love <br/>
&gt; playing a monk.  If you have any questions, or can think of something you&#39;ve <br/>
&gt; heard of that I haven&#39;t mentioned, plz ask, and I&#39;ll do my best to fill you <br/>
&gt; in.<br/>
