<div id="ygrps-yiv-989038521">well well well...what have i *hic* started.  Sems two me dat a slite<br/>
debate be goin on while i be away.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to steer from my whole drunk arguement and go talk normal so<br/>
every here can be understanding of what i have to say.  That whole MY<br/>
GAME, MY MONEY agruement is old and just an exscuse for someone to say<br/>
<br/>
&quot;screw you....i don&#39;t care what you think...i&#39;ll do what I want and I<br/>
don&#39;t care about anyone else&quot;<br/>
<br/>
thats what the whole MY MONEY, MY GAME arguement means...and if you<br/>
disagree with that you are wrong.  The whole reason people say that is so<br/>
they can justify what ever they do even when they are wrong.  This is a<br/>
roleplaying game with many many people playing at one time.  <br/>
<br/>
A massive multiplayer game right?  Massively Multiplayer.....i think<br/>
everyone can agree with that.  And wheather or not you realize it<br/>
everything you do has an effect on the other people who play the game. <br/>
Every orc pawn you kill, every foraged piece of food you drop...it all has<br/>
an effect on the other people on the server.  <br/>
<br/>
Now that we have that understood....lets talk about twinking.  Everytime<br/>
you twink you take something away from someone who is at the right level<br/>
to have that item.  At 19 or 17 or 22 or whatever level he was...he took<br/>
away an executioners hood from some 45th+ level character.  He took the<br/>
serpentine bracers away from some 40th+ level character who deserved it.<br/>
<br/>
And it&#39;s not the fact that he can go and get another one...it&#39;s the fact<br/>
that he is just going to have to wait that much longer because there is<br/>
some chump monk who can&#39;t earn his own equipment...he has to have older<br/>
friends help him out or just use his own older character to get things for<br/>
him cause he can&#39;t play the game like it was meant to be played.  <br/>
<br/>
I hate twinking and i hate twinkers because you take things away from<br/>
people who rightfully deserve those items.  I don&#39;t care if your 48th<br/>
level kill stealing wizard had to shoot down the hopes of a group of 45th<br/>
levels to get the item....you still took it from them and gave it to<br/>
someone who is 1/2 their age...maybe younger.  Everytime you twink an item<br/>
you screw someone who REALLY AND TRULEY DESERVES THE ITEM.   <br/>
<br/>
I think the one thing that people don&#39;t realize about this game and any<br/>
other game is that it is everyones responsibility to provide a roleplaying<br/>
environment.  it is EVERYONES responsibility to PROVIDE a ROLEPLAYING<br/>
ENVIRONMENT....it is a massively multiplayer roleplaying game after<br/>
all..... <br/>
