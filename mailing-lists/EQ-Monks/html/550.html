<div id="ygrps-yiv-1787529267">I am currently lvl 22 and not particularly strong for my level and I have<br/>
been hunting gargoyles.  I have died a few times, but mostly because I get<br/>
greedy and think I can finish one off when I get low on hps.  You can always<br/>
feign if you get in trouble.  You should be able to solo them at lvl 22<br/>
(just make sure you are full of hp&#39;s and have a mend available).  As far as<br/>
spawns, you have to kill the greater skels to get gargoyles to spawn.  When<br/>
you leave try to leave one garg on the island since they do attack and kill<br/>
the skels, so the next person will come and have a few gargs already on<br/>
island.<br/>
<br/>
You can get there by taking ship from freeport and get off at first stop. I<br/>
think it is called sister isle.  Swim straight out from the dock until you<br/>
came to another island.  Follow that island around to right a little way and<br/>
you will see another island in the distance. That is garg island.  Hope this<br/>
helps.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Dornn, Level 17 Monk (Feign Death! Yeah, baby!), Brell Serilis, currently<br/>
&gt;  hunting Gargoyles in the Ocean of Tears.&lt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thank god you mentioned gargoyles.  I&#39;m level 22nd monk from cazic thule<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; was wondering where I should hunt.  I&#39;ve hunted gorge hounds for the last<br/>
3<br/>
&gt; levels and I do not want to hunt avaiks due to the over crowded<br/>
population.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m fully decked out with serpentines/exe hoods/black pearl so i&#39;m rather<br/>
&gt; strong for my level.  I guess what I&#39;m asking is that What level are<br/>
&gt; gargoyles and what island are they on? and do they respawn fast? any<br/>
trains?<br/>
&gt; Can I solo?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Does anyone recomend Cazic thule? I friend of mine said it took her 2<br/>
hours<br/>
&gt; to find a group(24thmage) and died/zoned many of times.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Another question.  I have no boots. Leather is too heavy. They don&#39;t make<br/>
&gt; mesh.  Anyone know where i can get good boots with low wieght?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks for your time,<br/>
