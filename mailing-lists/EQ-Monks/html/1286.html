<div id="ygrps-yiv-1435948469">There is a TON of armor better than cured silk, I think the only place on my <br/>
monk that is still wearing cured is my Cured Silk Ghi (cause I just LOVE the <br/>
way my female monk looks wearing it)  but every other location has a better <br/>
amrmor peice.  Goto EQ Stomped and they have a special section on monk armor <br/>
and you can compare and contrast them, and see what you want to hunt for <br/>

&gt;Subject: [EQ-Monks] What to buy?<br/>
&gt;Date: Wed, 02 Feb 2000 01:47:59 +0000<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hi all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m a level 12 monk who now has a full set of cured and some wu&#39;s<br/>
&gt;gauntlets. (It took long enough to save up)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The thing is I don&#39;t have a clue what to buy next? The only better armour I<br/>
&gt;know of is that Plane of Fear, Shiverback stuff.. At level 12, I think not.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So I guess that leaves earrings and rings? What should I go for? I<br/>
&gt;currently have no earrings and two +2 dex rings, + 1 AC derv rings..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Any suggestions welcomed!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;PS I have discovered a useful (bug?) Scarab (sand/Giant) carapaces weigh<br/>
&gt;0.0kgs. You can solo these at about level 10, and since the loot doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;weigh anything it&#39;s all good! (Ok at higher levels 1.7gp per shell isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;going to get anyone very excited is it!)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Cheers,<br/>
