<div id="ygrps-yiv-224912277">Yes it is silly that any weapon out there has a faster delay than our<br/>
fist&#39;s.  Even if it is a lightweight weapon....the whole reason a blunt<br/>
weapon or slashing weapon does damage is because of the windup and swing.<br/>
Fists however are just straight forward....no extra weight off any<br/>
sort...unlike a weapon.  The only thing i can see maybe being faster is<br/>
small piercing weapons such as dagger&#39;s, dirk&#39;s, stiletto&#39;s and so on.<br/>
