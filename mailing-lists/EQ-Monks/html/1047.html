 </span></blockquote>Aye, South Ro is AWESOME. Of course, by the time I noticed that, damn near<br/>
everything was green to me.... I wouldn&#39;t be surprised to see South Ro take<br/>
a similar path to Split Paw (if that EVER gets done).<br/>
<br/>
Out of Curiousity, is anyone else besides me greatly looking forward to<br/>
SplitPaw being changed?<br/>
