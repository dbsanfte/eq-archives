<b>Subject:</b> RE: A warning for Fenin Ro players <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1745487703">Well... the good news is, Praelor is back from Limbo. After 12 hours in<br/>
e-mails, on the phone, and in /tells with about 6 different folx, it took GM<br/>
Tunso (head GM for Fenin Ro) all of about 10 minutes to fix whatever the<br/>
problem was. Here is a run down of what we discovered:<br/>
<br/>
1- Since it was happening to any character I tried to pass thru that zone on<br/>
the Fenin Ro server, it is not a corrupt character file.<br/>
2- Since the zone files are not server specific, and I can zone with no<br/>
problem on other servers, it is not a corrupt zone file.<br/>
3- The problem occurred on 2 different systems at my place, each working<br/>
independently of the other, so it is not machine specific.<br/>
4- Removing EQ, re-installing EQ, and downloading all the patches did not<br/>
resolve the issue.<br/>
<br/>
All this adds up to 1 probable cause: my connection. I run on a cable modem<br/>
(Road Runner) and up until the last patch have had absolutely no problems<br/>
whatsoever. I have passed through this zone into North Keladim a hundred<br/>
times or more, as I spend alot of time in Unrest and it is the closest bank.<br/>
To further the argument, the same problem occurred again last night zoning<br/>
from East Commons to West Commons! I had a trusted guildmate log in as me,<br/>
and she was able to move Praelor just fine. But here is where the problem<br/>
is... On the Character selection screen, when I chose Praelor, it gave the<br/>
location as East Commons. When my guildmate logged in, she logged into West<br/>
Commons.<br/>
<br/>
So it appears that it is some kind of connection problem or difficulty<br/>
between my systems and the Fenin Ro servers (perhaps a UUNET incompatibility<br/>
somewhere?). I say all this to see if anyone out there more versed than I<br/>
with communication issues has any idea of what I can do to prevent this in<br/>
the future. I am not running thru a Proxy server nor am I using NAT<br/>
software. any ideas at all would be appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

&gt; I had a similar problem with a monk on the Solusek Ro server, but it was<br/>
&gt; happening in Qeynos, I sent an e-mail to verant and they recommended that<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; delete the files on my pc relating to that zone and the zone you are<br/>
&gt; currently in, when you next log in they update server will replace the<br/>
&gt; zone<br/>
&gt; files and it should correct the problem.<br/>

&gt; I write to let you know of a rather upsetting issue that I am faced with<br/>
&gt; at<br/>
&gt; the moment. It appears to only be affecting me, but it is severe enough to<br/>
&gt; bring to your attention as well, I think.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Last night, while zoning from South Keladim into North Keladim (where the<br/>
&gt; bank is) I crashed. A drag, but nothing all that new. The twist is,<br/>
&gt; however,<br/>
&gt; I cannot log my monk, Praelor, back onto the server! I tried re-starting<br/>
&gt; EQ,<br/>
&gt; re-connecting my ISP, and re-booting my system, all to no avail. I brought<br/>
&gt; in a lvl 2 druid and /petitioned, and spent the next 3 hours speaking with<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; guide and a gm. The GM said he would reset my character to a point prior<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; the disappearance, but could make no promises on when that would occur. So<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; logged and tried again this morning.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And there he was, right where I had started Last night. Everything<br/>
&gt; appeared<br/>
&gt; to be fine. I still needed to go to the bank, however, so off to Keladim I<br/>
&gt; went, and upon zoning from S. Keladim into N. Keladim again, I crashed.<br/>
&gt; With<br/>
&gt; the same results as last night. Well, it was 6:30 am EST, and no GM&#39;S were<br/>
&gt; online, but I did speak with a guide who promised to forward my problem to<br/>
&gt; then first GM who showed up, but it would not be for several hours.<br/>
&gt; Understandable, given that it was 3:30 am in San Diego.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So now, with time to kill before work, I decided to experiment. I created<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; Dwarven Cleric and ran him into the zone and promptly crashed. So at least<br/>
&gt; it is not a corrupt character file with Praelor. I then created a Dwarven<br/>
&gt; Cleric on The Tribunal server and zoned with no problem. Now I know it is<br/>
&gt; not a corrupt N. Keladim data file and that it is specific to Fenin Ro. A<br/>
&gt; few of my guildmates then create characters on Fenin Ro and zone with no<br/>
&gt; problem, so it is not a server-wide issue.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; All this leads me to believe that it is something specific with the link<br/>
&gt; between my system and the Fenin Ro servers, but I just wanted to give<br/>
&gt; everyone a heads up on this &quot;just in case&quot;. I am planning on re-installing<br/>
&gt; EQ and running all the patches tonight, and will let you know the outcome.<br/>
&gt; With any luck, that will solve everything and Praelor Dileasai will once<br/>
&gt; again be running from all those nasty critters in Mistmoore (hehe). If<br/>
&gt; not... well.. I just don&#39;t really want to think about the &quot;if not&quot;<br/>
&gt; scenario<br/>
&gt; yet.<br/>
