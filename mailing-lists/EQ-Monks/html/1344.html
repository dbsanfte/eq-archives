&gt;Firstly:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What makes you think &quot;twinking&quot; is a problem that verant wants to curtail.<br/>
 </span></blockquote> They<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;have never, not once made a post, comment editorial, patch or any other<br/>
&gt;statement in any way about it.  I am not convinced anything will ever be done<br/>
&gt;about twinking or that it should.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Valid point about whether or not Verant thinks that this is a problem.  I<br/>
will ask why you don&#39;t think twinking is a problem or that anything should<br/>
be done about it?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;Secondly:<br/>
&gt;The coding required to implement such a system would probably require an<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;complete rewrite of the item or player character tables.  This would take<br/>
 </span></blockquote>ALOT<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;of programmer time (requiring the cessation of all other projects) and would<br/>
&gt;very likely introduce new BUGs and exploits.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I accept your argument on this conditionally, since my field of expertise<br/>
is emergency medicine and not computer programming.  Couldn&#39;t they have<br/>
added this into the Ruins of Kunark expansion?  Wouldn&#39;t an expansion of<br/>
that size have taken a great deal of programmer time?<br/>
