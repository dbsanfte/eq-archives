<div id="ygrps-yiv-844977005">We are getting some pretty intense arguments  here, aren&#39;t we?<br/>
<br/>
          Well, of course,  nothing is as good as an MMORPG to get the<br/>
passionate words/arguments flowing.   =)   With a few exceptions, of course.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
      On the whole debate of twinking, note, that I take no side in this<br/>
argument, and if someone flames me, I shall ignore them.  Here are a couple<br/>
of OPINIONS of mine.  I am not pushing them on you, and if you do not wish<br/>
to read them, fine by me.  I am not foolish enough to call them fact.  If<br/>
you do read them, and whine, you will recieve no response:<br/>
<br/>
        Now, since you have thousands of people playing this game at once,<br/>
it would be a delusional dream to  convince  EVERYONE to play the game the<br/>
way you want them to.  If it is against the rules, I will bet you many<br/>
people are doing it, and if it is on the edge of the rules (twinking) I will<br/>
bet you 3X as much people are doing it.  I saw 3 people duping rubicite<br/>
yesterday.  I don&#39;t know how, I don&#39;t wanna know how, they weren&#39;t telling<br/>
anyone, and no GMs were on.  I saw a level 6 warrior in full steel plate.<br/>
People are going to play this game the way they want to if it is within the<br/>
rules (and many times if not) and there is hardly anything you people can<br/>
say or do about it.  This  is much similar to religious pounding!! Look at<br/>
yourselves: &quot;Wicca is evil, come to Christianity or you will burn in hell<br/>
and be shunned by fellow humans for the rest of your life&quot;  &quot;No, I will be<br/>
wicca because it  is a better and different way to live!&quot;/ &quot;Twinking is bad!<br/>
Stop twinking or, or, or, I WILL TELL THE GMS ON YOU AND YOU WILL BE<br/>
BANNED!&quot;  &quot;No! Im twinking because it is a better and more enjoyable for me<br/>
to play this way!&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
     People, opinions MAY sway some, but until verant &quot;fixes&quot; this, just<br/>
like they &quot;FIXED&quot; the DoTs (I play a  druid as well, and my enjoyment of EQ<br/>
has dropped tenfold because of this retarded patch), people will play the<br/>
game with a level 6 warrior decked in steel plate and duel weilding<br/>
langseax!  Many will just because they  can!  Many will because they are<br/>
bored! Many will because they want to be a different character but don&#39;t<br/>
have half of their lives to waste on it!<br/>
<br/>
    Stop bashing people because they twink!  It is just like me calling you<br/>
some vulgar thing just because your a buddhist or a jewish instead of a<br/>
christian!  You may see me defending twinkers here, but how many twinkers<br/>
have you seen bashing people who don&#39;t twink?  I haven&#39;t seen any!  And if<br/>
you bashed them first it doesn&#39;t matter!!<br/>
<br/>
    &quot;Twinkers interfere with my playing time!&quot;  Deal with it, this is an<br/>
MMORPG, and in buying it, you just invested in all the hassles, jerks,<br/>
idiots, fools, immature 12 year olds (I myself am 13, so I will not say<br/>
plain out &quot;12 year olds&quot;), opinionated idea bashers, and so forth.  You<br/>
can&#39;t eliminate assholes, EQ is so much like life in the fact that you will<br/>
have to deal with all of the undesireables as well as the desireables.  I<br/>
bet many of you complaining about twinkers played UO long enough to get<br/>
Pimpslapped all over the place by PKs before you left (Kudos to you if you<br/>
weren&#39;t and played the game).  I will tell ya all one thing:  That game<br/>
taught me to stop whining, hunker down, and fight back.     If twinkers are<br/>
annoying you so much, annoy them back.  If they are making you miserable,<br/>
try to find a way to make them miserable in turn.    Worried about Higher<br/>
levels taking YOUR kills?  How many of you visit stratics?  Brad is<br/>
releasing a new Yield policy stating that all high levels must yield all<br/>
lower leveled creatures to their appropriate hunters, if this is not done a<br/>
GM can be called and the situation solved.<br/>
<br/>
       So, my advice is that you people stop bashing the hell out of<br/>
eachother, my mailbox is getting so flooded with useless flame wars that Im<br/>
thinking of quitting this list.  Too bad the sensible good informative posts<br/>
would go with the flames.<br/>
<br/>
        I twinked my druid once (Only a suit of leather, and an RTS, and 25<br/>
plat emergency money), and if I actually COULD twink, I bet I would, because<br/>
I&#39;m sick of making a new char, then having it nerfed by Verant.  (I&#39;ve<br/>
gotten my necro to level 19 before Verant did those DoT changes, thereby<br/>
killing alot of the class, druid hit  15 before they nerfed him too). Im<br/>
thinking of making a wizzy, or getting my desperate monk back on his feet.<br/>
Or then again I may quit this game, and head back to UO, where I don&#39;t have<br/>
to worry about annoying little kids, because I can just kill them instead.<br/>
