<div id="ygrps-yiv-1520716753">and the other person was right.  I didnt say I thought we were going to<br/>
get snare, just that given all the spells out there, that would be the one<br/>
spell I would want most.<br/>
<br/>
I fought with a lvl 21 rogue the other day who had som e expensive dagger<br/>
that proced either root or snare.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Under this logic, why would a melee class such as a rogue<br/>
&gt; or a warrior get weapons that proc darkness or DoT or even<br/>
&gt; DD spells?  We have treant fists.  There must be a reason<br/>
&gt; they&#39;re called treant fists.  There are no treants involved in<br/>
&gt; the quest!<br/>

&gt; Just to clarify:<br/>
&gt; &quot; snaring glove or 1h blunt weapon would be an unlikely development.&quot;<br/>
&gt; What I meant was a &quot;glove that proced snare&quot; or a &quot;1hb weapon that proced snare&quot;<br/>
&gt; would be an unlikely development - regardless of whether they are plane dropped<br/>
&gt; or norrath found.  That monk only one hand blunt weapons are coming is something<br/>
&gt; I believe I was one of the first to announce on this list and am &quot;reasonably&quot;<br/>
&gt; sure that they will be an eventuality (reasonably because until verant puts them<br/>
&gt; in the game you NEVER can tell what those guys will do)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Insummary : we agree that 1hblunt weapons are coming.<br/>
&gt;             I strongly disagree that snaring weapons (gloves/blunt weapons) will<br/>
&gt; ever be useable by any class that does not already have a snare or slowing<br/>
&gt; spell: druid ranger shaman etc)<br/>

&gt; The orignal person said just for fun what proc would you like to see and of<br/>
&gt; course thats what people want.  1hb weapons will be introduced into the game<br/>
&gt; of that I have no doubt as Gorden has already said we should practice our<br/>
&gt; 1hb skills. I also think if and when a glove such as that became avaiable<br/>
&gt; just as with the 1hb weapons they will most likely come from the planes.<br/>

&gt; &gt; A snaring glove or 1h blunt weapon would be an unlikely development.<br/>
&gt; Monks role<br/>
&gt; &gt; in a group is to do massive melee damge (reducing the  load on the casters<br/>
&gt; mana<br/>
&gt; &gt; at high levels).  To give us snare would weaken the ranger/druid role from<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; group some. Snare would be AWSOME, but it would mean we monks become to<br/>
&gt; &gt; powerful. able to solo in dungeons and area we were never meant to solo.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; While on the subject of monk items:<br/>
&gt; &gt; I have a question for all of you who did the treant fist quest.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I have spent about 15hours (total in two marathon sessions) camping for<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; humorous handheld mace off the alchemist in the  Xorb gorge.  I have<br/>
&gt; killed the<br/>
&gt; &gt; two goblin guards there till I am blue in the face.  Nothing has made that<br/>
&gt; &gt; alchemist spawn.  Is there a trick to doing so?  Last night I spent about<br/>
&gt; 10<br/>
&gt; &gt; hours at it (and I picked up the camp from a guy who had been there for 4<br/>
&gt; hours<br/>
&gt; &gt; before me and had to go to bed)  So if you think about it in 14 hours of<br/>
&gt; &gt; non-stop camping he never showed.  Anyone who has done the quest can help<br/>
&gt; me out<br/>
&gt; &gt; with some advice?   I thought this guy was a 8-10 hour spawn?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt; Snare would be great.  Stun would be nice too.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Perhaps ones that proc some sort of flame-based or force-based DoT.<br/>
&gt; &quot;target<br/>
&gt; &gt; is slammed by an intense force&quot; or something like that.  Think of it as<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; monk focussing his ki into an attack.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; for fun, what would you want something to proc? personally, I really<br/>
&gt; wish<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I had a good mid lvl set of gloves that proced snare.  most usefull<br/>
&gt; spell<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; in the game imho.  then I could solo in dungeons that most people dont<br/>
&gt; go<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; into..upper guk, runnyeye, sola..etc.<br/>
