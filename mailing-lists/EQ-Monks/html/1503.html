<div id="ygrps-yiv-1899565111">Last night, I finally finished the treant fists quest.  My camp times were <br/>
different than most though:<br/>
<br/>
1)	Gorge Alchamist, *no camp time*.  He spawned twice while I was<br/>
	fighing Gorge Minotaurs for exp.<br/>
<br/>
2)	Gelatinous cube, *no camp time*, but I had to have a friend invisi<br/>
	me so I could go get him.  At 24th, he was a risky blue, not too<br/>
	much trouble.  (but almost ran out of air!)<br/>
<br/>
3)	Misty Alachamist: 10-12 hours camp time.  This little guy just<br/>
	would *not* spawn for me.  At first, I kept turnning in beads to try<br/>
	to get a squad ring, but eventually, that started getting as<br/>
	tedious as camping itself.  When he finally did spawn, he was <br/>
	*very* green.  I lost about a bubble of health killing him, without<br/>
	mending.<br/>
<br/>
4)	Goblin Captian: 9 hourss camp time.  I could not believe this guy<br/>
	took so long to spawn.  I lost two lives to Borxx, and had much <br/>
	trouble with him.  At 24th, a full group of mid-low 20s would have<br/>
	no trouble holding the king/captian room, but all of my friends got<br/>
	very tired of camping him.  So, eventually, I ended up feigned on<br/>
	the floor benieth the captian . . . couldn&#39;t split him either . .<br/>
	finally, a guild mate came along and split him for me.  He was<br/>
	risky blue (prolly 20-21) and went down fast.<br/>
<br/>
So, after much camping, I have the prized, but not worth the camp time, <br/>
Treant Fists.  Now I just have to go kill another wisp for a light stone.<br/>
Or, continue to carry my Wu&#39;s Gauntlets instead :)<br/>
<br/>
Later,<br/>
