<b>Subject:</b> Tarrrew - marr Guk run? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1069067981">I recently started a monk by the name of Aslam on tarew server when I<br/>
became frustrated with my level 32 paladin character - Innoriel (that is<br/>
his name) had been haveing trouble getting people to help him camp for<br/>
his ghoulbane - even the people who he helped get their holy swords!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, now that I am on this list and I see how much trouble we monks<br/>
have getting mesh, I realize that i can organize a party to help me camp<br/>
for the GB and to get lots of mesh at the same time.  I know from<br/>
Innoriel&#39;s numerous - and I do mean numerous- excursions into guk that<br/>
mesh is so common in the lower regions that Innoriel sometimes destroys it<br/>
or leaves it on the corpse!<br/>
<br/>
If I can get 2 other level 30 plus monks we can make the camp safe- I am<br/>
very good at controlling ths spawn in the Lord area.  But I figure it<br/>
would be more fun if I gathered 6 level 20-25 monks and lead them down<br/>
there - more the merrier - we can give each group an area of<br/>
responsibility. while I and one other higher level monk (level 28 at<br/>
least) watched for the Lord or his cronies.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My experience has been the the mesh will be dropped in quantities<br/>
enough to grant every monk present one or two pieces each (assuming we get<br/>
8 or more monks)  The xp at level 20 -25 will be Tremendous.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Its just an idea.  If there are any of you on Trew marr who are<br/>
interested give me email - no need to spam the whole list.  and we can set<br/>
up a time for toinght or tomorrow.  BRING Friends!</div>
