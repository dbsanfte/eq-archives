<div id="ygrps-yiv-989549492">whoa.....this thread has balloned quite a bit since I last checked this<br/>

All I said was that too some it is more than a game....but I didn&#39;t state<br/>
anything more....<br/>
<br/>
For some it&#39;s a game<br/>

For some it&#39;s an escape from reality for a few hours<br/>
<br/>
For some it&#39;s a way to keep in contact with old and new friends<br/>
