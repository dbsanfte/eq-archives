<div id="ygrps-yiv-1019399769">I got my netted armor (& gloves) from a nice dark elf enchantress for 2 plat <br/>
because &quot;she had no use for them&quot;.  Ya just gotta shop around!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I have to agree with this .. Monks really do have the p*** taken out of <br/>
&gt;them<br/>
&gt;because everyone knows they need netted armour and upwards, but I have to<br/>
&gt;say that I am yet to meet a fellow monk that shares the same thoughts. I<br/>
&gt;managed to get myself a full set of netted from a troll for 4pp al that was<br/>
&gt;missing was the gloves .. which I expected to pay up to 2pp for, even <br/>
&gt;though<br/>
&gt;I begrudge paying it .. Imagine my supprise when I auctioned for a pair and<br/>
&gt;a fellow monk offered me some for &quot;Oh the least I will take is 10pp&quot; .. <br/>
&gt;this<br/>
&gt;was on Erollisi Marr server<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Perhaps an all monk guild would address this problem?<br/>
