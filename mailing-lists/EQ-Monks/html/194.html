 </span></blockquote>I went to Permafrost last night and used it about 4 times.  Once when I was solo<br/>
and got attacked by several of the goblins at the entrance, once when some high<br/>
level characters brought a bunch of elites to the zone, once when an ice giant<br/>
decided to say hello, and once when I was afk.  ;)  It worked every time for me.<br/>
<br/>
One night in Mistmoore, before the patch, it failed on me (&quot;Faeaani has fallen<br/>
to the ground&quot;) three times in a row while I was trying to get away from a train<br/>
of ancilles and gypsies, but that&#39;s been the extent of my bad luck with FD.<br/>
