<div id="ygrps-yiv-645011025">In the VERY long run you should shoot for some rings/bracers that give<br/>
both AGI and DEx.<br/>
<br/>
I currently use 2 platinum Black pearl rings - +6 AGI/DEX  (yes it<br/>
increases both) *costs about 550pp each and is player made*<br/>
<br/>
2 earings *cant remember the name, but they are jeweler crafted also* :<br/>
+4str/2int    *costs about 175pp each*<br/>
<br/>
One platinum black pearl choker - 7Agi/7Dex  *150pp I think I paid for it<br/>
- jeweler crafted also!*<br/>
<br/>
and of course two serpentine bracers. *found on the animated hand in lower<br/>
guk*<br/>
<br/>
There also armor pieces like Executioner hood, dwarven work boots <br/>
Lizardscale gloves that give DEX and other bonuses.  <br/>
<br/>
My dex is currently 134 and Agility is 129<br/>
I realize that at level 15 you can&#39;t really afford any of these, but its<br/>
always nice to know what is out there.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck - personally I would go with AGI (improve your ac and balcking<br/>
ability)<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I appeal to the wisdom of the group once again. I&#39;m a 15th level monk<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; starting to assemble a nice set of armor, but I&#39;m a bit naive when it<br/>
&gt; &gt; comes<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to jewelry. Which stat is more valuable to raise with jewelry, DEX or AGI?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Both. :)<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; and str. str apparently has a direct relation to your atk value.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would try to balance the three.<br/>
