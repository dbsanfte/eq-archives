<div id="ygrps-yiv-1996418158">whats absolutly Kills me is that some clerics triedn to get some things<br/>
changed about their class and the response was.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the feedback. At this point in the game, we really can&#39;t<br/>
change how the Cleric class works. There are too many people who chose the<br/>
class because of the way that it is. I do appreciate your suggestions, and<br/>
will use them if we ever work on another project similar to EQ.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
so with this staement in mind remove the word cleric and insert the word<br/>
monk !  WTF verant?<br/>

&gt; Nice of them to tell us.  If you look at the wording, the only reason<br/>
&gt; they bothered was because some had it as a spell.  If they nerf<br/>
&gt; mend or some other monk only skill, they will NEVER mention it in<br/>
&gt; the patch message, it seems.  Does this bother anyone else?<br/>
