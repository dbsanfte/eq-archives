&gt;I think that monks should be a little subdued as far as magical abilities<br/>
&gt;go.  After all, we&#39;re supposed to have turned our bodies into living<br/>
&gt;weapons.  :)  Some items that give big increases to Dodge, or Block (Gloves<br/>
&gt;or Bracers of Blocking, perhaps?) would be much more appropriate to the way<br/>
&gt;I feel the class should be.  No flashy magics.  Perhaps a Jump ability<br/>
&gt;enabling you to jump across distances, or reach higher things.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I recently sold all of my items (Raean,18th level monk on Tunare) and am<br/>
&gt;going to be hanging around Freeport helping newbies out when I want to take<br/>
&gt;a break from my other characters.  I just got too bored.  I already had full<br/>
&gt;mesh with a Lockjaw Tunic. I was pretty much set until I could get into Fear<br/>
&gt;and get shiverback (silverback?) armor, didn&#39;t have a regular group, and had<br/>
&gt;trouble finding ones all the time, so I was forced to solo.  Just got<br/>
&gt;disillusioned with being a Monk.  I loved being able to dish out damage, and<br/>
&gt;not needing to spend a billion platinum to get things, but it&#39;d be nice to<br/>
&gt;get some &quot;cool stuff&quot; during the next 30 levels, besides new jewelry.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Just my two cents.<br/>

&gt;Hello Fellow Monks,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It is me again. This bit just gave me an idea. How about Monk<br/>
specialization? something like pick a new skill such  as &quot;Fists like<br/>
Stone&quot;, or &quot;Bending Reed&quot;, which might seriously add to dodging. So fists<br/>
of stone would dish out harder hits when the skill increases and bending<br/>
reed might seriously cut on the damage and add to the swiftness and agility<br/>
of Monks. But make it a choose one or the other type of special skill.<br/>
Perhaps give us three or four skills to choose from. How about that? :o)<br/>
