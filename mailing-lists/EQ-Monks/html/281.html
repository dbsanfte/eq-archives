<div id="ygrps-yiv-1653489890">i have all the stuff for the first 3 sash&#39;s, but it&#39;s the fact that I<br/>
can&#39;t seem to raise my faction high enough cause i chose agnostic for god.<br/>

Doing Qeynos quests does raise your faction with Freeport monks....and I<br/>
would assume the same for doing Freeport sash&#39;s quests having effects on<br/>
the Silent Fist clan.<br/>
<br/>
Also...people have eluded to orc&#39;s giving Ashen Order faction.  Which<br/>
orc&#39;s would these be if any.  I killed a few in ECom on my way through one<br/>
day and didn&#39;t notice an Ashen Order hit.<br/>
