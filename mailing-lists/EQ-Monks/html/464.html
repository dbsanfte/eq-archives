<br/>
I am a tailor of a good deal of experience and was<br/>
hoping that someone could answer a question for me.  I<br/>
hunt in East Commonlands and therefore tailoring is a<br/>
simple skill to use because pelts are so common. <br/>
However, Patchwork has become too easy for me and I<br/>
have done some research into Studded Leather.  As most<br/>
of you know, making studded armor requires studs.  I<br/>
do not wish to take the time to make studs because<br/>
what I like most about tailoring is I do not have to<br/>
spend time doing it, I just kill animals and use their<br/>
pelts.   Does anyone know if it is possible to buy<br/>
studs, or anyone on the Karana Server near Freeport<br/>
who sells them.<br/>
