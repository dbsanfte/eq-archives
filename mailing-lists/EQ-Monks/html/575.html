&gt; &gt;hmm may be tough for you to level if you don&#39;t kill any races that are<br/>
&gt; &gt;&#39;&#39;civilized&#39;&#39;.  by &#39;&#39;civilized&#39;&#39; i assume you mean they have a society,<br/>
&gt; &gt;since<br/>
&gt; &gt;bandits who KOS other people, could hardly be considered civilized<br/>
&gt; &gt;by the normal definition of the word.  No kobolds in solusek, no goblins<br/>
&gt; &gt;in runnyeye or permafrost, no lizardmen in cazic, no ogres in najena, no<br/>
&gt; &gt;orcs in crushbone...  what&#39;s left?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I believe our brother was referring to the civilised races of the light.<br/>
&gt; Kobolds and ogres and trolls (oh my!) are fiendish races who deserve<br/>
&gt; whatever punishment my fists can deal to them.   Human and demihuman<br/>
&gt; bandits, however, are children of the light who have fallen from the path.<br/>
&gt; They should not be hunted and killed like scrawny gnolls, but rather shown<br/>
&gt; that their ways are in error and urged to repent.    I think that the dark<br/>
&gt; races, such as orcs and dark elves, are beyond salvation.<br/>
