&gt;2) One handed blunt patch: call it Nunchuck patch:<br/>
&gt;Abashi has also been quoted on the message board as saying that in the future<br/>
&gt;(afew months down the line) monk only 1handed blunt weapons will be <br/>
&gt;implemented<br/>
&gt;: they should proc and offer us more diversity.  No word on whether the haste<br/>
&gt;effect on our fists will carry over to one-handed blunt.  I doubt it will<br/>
&gt;however.  I suspect that the 1handed blunt weapons will be implemented to give<br/>
&gt;us more variety.  You know switch to &quot;nunchucks of stunning&quot; for extra<br/>
&gt;interrupts when fighting casters, or &quot;nunchucks of slowing&quot; for proc&#39;ing snare<br/>
&gt;when in a dungeon.  Who knows there may introduce a godly nunchuck of<br/>
&gt;ASSWHOOPing that is a 10 dmage 12 delay type thingy... (of course it will only<br/>
&gt;found in the plains)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
If these things are found in the plains that would be awesome and very easy <br/>
to get.<br/>
I assume you mean the plains of Karana, since those are the only plains i <br/>
know of<br/>
in this game.</div>
