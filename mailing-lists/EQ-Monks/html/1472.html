<div id="ygrps-yiv-2100692711">First I&#39;d like to thank everyone on responding to my post, you&#39;ve<br/>
been a great help all of you. But I&#39;ve already spent a while camping<br/>
him. He&#39;s meant to span every 72-80 minutes? cause I&#39;d NEVER seen him<br/>
and i&#39;ve spent a couple of lvl&#39;s in there from 16-18 and now a while<br/>
there and he never seems to spawn! Also when you kill him does he<br/>
drop the humerus handled mace every time?<br/>
What about the other mobs? Can you provide information for them liek<br/>
the where they spawn and the times and lvl&#39;s etc? Cause I haven&#39;t<br/>
spent much time in misty or runneyeye. <br/>
Thanks again in advance,<br/>
<br/>
