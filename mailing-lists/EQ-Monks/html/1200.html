<b>Subject:</b> Monks role: <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-579678298">A snaring glove or 1h blunt weapon would be an unlikely development.  Monks role<br/>
in a group is to do massive melee damge (reducing the  load on the casters mana<br/>
at high levels).  To give us snare would weaken the ranger/druid role from the<br/>
group some. Snare would be AWSOME, but it would mean we monks become to<br/>
powerful. able to solo in dungeons and area we were never meant to solo.<br/>
<br/>
While on the subject of monk items:<br/>
I have a question for all of you who did the treant fist quest.<br/>
I have spent about 15hours (total in two marathon sessions) camping for the<br/>
humorous handheld mace off the alchemist in the  Xorb gorge.  I have killed the<br/>
two goblin guards there till I am blue in the face.  Nothing has made that<br/>
alchemist spawn.  Is there a trick to doing so?  Last night I spent about 10<br/>
hours at it (and I picked up the camp from a guy who had been there for 4 hours<br/>
before me and had to go to bed)  So if you think about it in 14 hours of<br/>
non-stop camping he never showed.  Anyone who has done the quest can help me out<br/>
with some advice?   I thought this guy was a 8-10 hour spawn?<br/>
<br/>

Snare would be great.  Stun would be nice too.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps ones that proc some sort of flame-based or force-based DoT.  &quot;target<br/>
is slammed by an intense force&quot; or something like that.  Think of it as the<br/>
monk focussing his ki into an attack.<br/>

&gt; for fun, what would you want something to proc? personally, I really wish<br/>
&gt; I had a good mid lvl set of gloves that proced snare.  most usefull spell<br/>
&gt; in the game imho.  then I could solo in dungeons that most people dont go<br/>
&gt; into..upper guk, runnyeye, sola..etc.<br/>
