<div id="ygrps-yiv-1165299627">Though I may be wrong it sounds like you should start looking to <br/>
adventure/purchase a lizard cloak out of lower gukk or the silver bracers <br/>
which run somewhere in the 125pp range.  Also you may want to look into <br/>
getting the Jagged rings not sure where they are, heard the dwarf ghost in <br/>
UNrest then not but they are ac5 and two of those I think would be better <br/>
then +10 agi but thats just a wild guess, I love AC!</div>
