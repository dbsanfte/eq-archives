<div id="ygrps-yiv-1076555913">Hi all, being around the level that dragon raids are attempted and such, I<br/>
realized that I don&#39;t have any resistance gear and such to fight them, I was<br/>
wondering if anyone had a nice little list of good dragon fighting equipment<br/>
and such. I am looking forward to going out there and kicking butt! Thanks.</div>
