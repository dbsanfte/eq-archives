<div id="ygrps-yiv-845876136">Holy smokes WAKE UP AND SMELL THE JAVA!!!! Im a little tired of reading <br/>
these posts that the headband animation or sash cant be added because the <br/>
&quot;2mb buffer over flow tri linera mip mapped anti aliased Voodoo 1 yad yada <br/>
yada&quot; machines will slow down and cant handle it. If you believe that then <br/>
call me quick cause I got a whole lot of pure grade a sunshine in a bottle <br/>
to sell ya. THINK! We are not asking for entirely new animations of dragons <br/>
or flying vehicles or backflips out of dangeers way. All we are asking for <br/>
is a nice yellow, blue, ornage, red, pink, muave, sandle whatever colored <br/>
strip on my head! For christ sakes barbarians get 19 different helmets with <br/>
all sorts of funky horns and yet if you put a simple colored stripe on my <br/>
head or waist the graphics engine cant handle it and the game will come to a <br/>
screaching halt? Please stop the non sense! I have a feeling the developers <br/>
are being misquoted here on this thread and their comments are in reference <br/>
to other much larger issues within the game and not a simple stripe on a <br/>
head.</div>
