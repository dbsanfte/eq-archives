&gt;I&#39;ve been posting this on the message board at:<br/>
&gt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://server3.ezboard.com/beverquestmonks">http://server3.ezboard.com/beverquestmonks</a><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And I thought I&#39;d also post it here, as this is turning <br/>
&gt;out to be a lot of fun and so far I&#39;ve had a lot of <br/>
&gt;support.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Event: Monk Madness <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Server: Vallon Zek <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Time: Starting this Friday at 9PM eastern US time. That <br/>
&gt;is GMT -5:00 for international monks. :)This will be an <br/>
&gt;ongoing event until Sunday Night. Play as little or as <br/>
&gt;much of that as you want to. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Story: An evil gnome wizard experimenting with cloning <br/>
&gt;captured a lone human monk in Freeport, and tried to <br/>
&gt;clone him. He inadvertently triggered a chain reaction <br/>
&gt;and suddenly there spawns many many many monks. All <br/>
&gt;identical. Being of one mind they are also all of one <br/>
&gt;guild, &quot;The Armadillos of Norrath&quot;. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Naming: This is an event in which monks from all <br/>
&gt;servers who may know each other from messageboards will <br/>
&gt;participate. Therefore I think it is a great idea that <br/>
&gt;we use the naming convention &#39;&quot;your real monk <br/>
&gt;name&quot;dillo&#39;. Or a variation thereof. Such that I am <br/>
&gt;going to be Ipnodillo on vallon zek for the weekend. ;) <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Goal: Have fun. Group up with as many monks as you can <br/>
&gt;and run around the zone punching everything in site. Go <br/>
&gt;on suicide missions. We&#39;ll be like ants. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;To participate, create a new monk on Vallon Zek Friday <br/>
&gt;Night. The monk should be the male version with the <br/>
&gt;Priest of Discord face. We&#39;re gonna try to create a <br/>
&gt;guild for this as well, so look for a guild officer to <br/>
&gt;invite you. Please try to keep your guild tunic on at <br/>
&gt;all times so we have the monk &quot;look&quot; about us. Invite <br/>
&gt;all your friends to attend. This is an event to have <br/>
&gt;fun, not so heavy on the roleplaying, but lets just <br/>
&gt;have a LOT of fun. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;To clarify, your monk should look like this: <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shada.com/pod.jpg">http://www.shada.com/pod.jpg</a><br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;The guild has been submitted. Lets all hope verant <br/>
&gt;approves it! <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Invite your non monk friends who have always admired <br/>
&gt;your monkness as well! Lets try and make this event a <br/>
&gt;legend of it&#39;s own kind! :) <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Just think. Hundreds of Identical Newbie Monks... <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ipno Ashen<br/>
&gt;20th Armadillo<br/>
&gt;Brell Serilis<br/>
&gt;&quot;The future just isn&#39;t what it used to be.&quot;<br/>
