<div id="ygrps-yiv-1297909288">Its not about &quot;chatting&quot;!!! I don&#39;t need some lame ass chat room to<br/>
talk to him.  I get bored to death with ICQ and chats and all that<br/>
stupid crap!!  Its not even about talking...its about doing something<br/>
together....the working together.  We don&#39;t have anything to do<br/>
together besides talking about &quot;well so have you talked to dad lately? <br/>
or how&#39;s mom doing?&quot;  BORING!!!  BUT when we are in EQ we fight mobs<br/>
together and I trust him completely..he is my brother!  I love him more<br/>
than anyone.  We just don&#39;t have much to say and this way its like he<br/>
lives near me and I can do things with him all the time.  Last time I<br/>
saw him...we sat and played diablo all day or something.  This is<br/>
something we enjoy doing together!  And for your info..yes I have been<br/>
in Lower guk fighting and carrying on a coversation with him....guess I<br/>
am just multi-tasking...or something.  <br/>

&gt; could chat<br/>
&gt; in e-mail or ICQ but you say you dont have the time. For your own<br/>
&gt; brother?<br/>
&gt; Yet you go ingame and use it like a chat room, doing nothing but<br/>
&gt; sending<br/>
&gt; messages back and forth. You can&#39;t tell me you are in Sol B fighting<br/>
&gt; whatever while you chat with him. I&#39;ve tried carrying on<br/>
&gt; conversations while<br/>
&gt; fighting and it doesn&#39;t work real well. So you sit in game and chat<br/>
&gt; but you<br/>
&gt; have no time to sit out of game and chat. With your own family.....<br/>
&gt; That<br/>
&gt; doesnt make EQ more than a game, just a game with a chat<br/>
&gt; feature......<br/>
