<div id="ygrps-yiv-2034235305">You can practice instill doubt on anything, other ppl, mobs nowhere near you, <br/>
conning whatever color.  It takes forever for it to go up.  Mine is at 105 <br/>
right now and works maybe 1 in 10 times.  It is no good in dungeons, the mob <br/>
will run and get friends to bring back.  Only good thing I have seen for it <br/>
is if a mob is ensnared and you are fighting in the open where there are <br/>
hardly any mobs around it and it will run so you can smack it in the back.<br/>
