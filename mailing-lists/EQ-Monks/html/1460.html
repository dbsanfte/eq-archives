<div id="ygrps-yiv-222266287">I don&#39;t know about personal experience, seeing how I haven&#39;t gotten ID<br/>
yet (so close to 18), but I have seen it in action.  I&#39;ve seen a  couple<br/>
higher lvl monks solo a spectre very easily using ID, fearing it, then<br/>
beating on its back.  One monk of the karana server has claimed to solo<br/>
a hill giant using it. (just can&#39;t remember the name)  Though it is slow<br/>
to increase I&#39;ve heard that ID can be rather helpful in hte right<br/>
situations.<br/>

&gt; &gt;From what I have read, and what I have experienced, FD goes up really slow,<br/>
&gt; I mean CRAWLING slow.  I put one point in it at 18th (starting me at 18)and<br/>
&gt; have been hitting it almost constantly, running, waiting, I mean anytime I<br/>
&gt; remember to hit the thing, and I think it just hit 35.  I hear once it hits<br/>
&gt; 50, it goes up a bit faster.  If you want to see it work, stand in front of<br/>
&gt; a green mob that wont agro on you, and preferably won&#39;t move.  and hit ONLY<br/>
&gt; the ID key, and just keep hitting it over and over and eventually it will go<br/>
&gt; off on it.  At such a low level, this skill is not going to benifit you in<br/>
&gt; combat in anyway, for a good while.  Ahh well I know people who have gotten<br/>
&gt; it to the low 100s but I don&#39;t often hear that it is a great help.  Probably<br/>
&gt; just as much of a help as a Spell Thrower&#39;s fear spell.<br/>

&gt; &gt;My FD works great.. has saved my butt HEAPS.. just<br/>
&gt; &gt;keep practicing like crazy...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Instill doubt.. well, I try to practice and practice..<br/>
&gt; &gt;don&#39;t see it working.. don&#39;t see it improving either<br/>
&gt; &gt;*shrugs hopelessly*  but then I said that with Safe<br/>
&gt; &gt;Fall at early levels too :-))  Now THAT is maxxed<br/>
&gt; &gt;within 5 mins of gaining a new level :-)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Sneak is very sneaky.. hehe...  AND if you find a<br/>
&gt; &gt;vendor that don&#39;t like you, just use sneak and he/she<br/>
&gt; &gt;immediately becomes indifferent... hooray!!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I love my Monk, have Mend and Bind Wound over 100 and<br/>
&gt; &gt;hardly ever have to sit down!  Drives my partner<br/>
