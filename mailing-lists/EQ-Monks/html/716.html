<div id="ygrps-yiv-1064954840">Heh, i made a ton of money this way with my level 7 bard making trips to<br/>
unrest to get fs weapons and stuff.  speed song was very big in making<br/>
this worthwhile.  now tho, it&#39;s easier to kill stuff and get the fs to<br/>
sell, heh.<br/>

&gt;&gt; P.S. 500p is a reasonable amount to have SAVED up by level 18, but making<br/>
&gt;&gt; 500p IN ONE DAY at level 19 is amazing, he may not wnat to give away his<br/>
&gt;&gt; secret, but what ever he is doing to make that kind of money I would like <br/>
&gt;&gt; to know... <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;its no secret. verant had created a rather true economy.  instead of<br/>
&gt;practicing my skills in pottery, I&#39;ve practiced it in commerce.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Capitolism is alive and well on the servers.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;granted, I had a great day yesterday, and my initial investment certanly<br/>
&gt;needed to be taken out of the 500pp I made.  and I sold stuff that I have<br/>
&gt;had sitting in inventory for a while.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;just another example of another way to play the game (that I&#39;m sure some<br/>
&gt;poeple will tell me I&#39;m wrong for)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;*monk specific part*<br/>
&gt;I find that monks make good traders.  When I&#39;m traveling, I dont worry<br/>
&gt;about the weight restrictions, and I usually dont fight, just feign.  Gets<br/>
&gt;me where I want to go.<br/>
