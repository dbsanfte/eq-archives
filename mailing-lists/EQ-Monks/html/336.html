<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1429209854">The Barbarian&#39;s name is &quot;Hadden&quot; and he is a very rare spawn near the Lake in Qeynos hills. Either that, or he takes a long time to respawn, since he is seldom there.<br/>
<br/>
Be warned that the faction hit you take from killing him is VERY heavy. He also does not always have the Fishbone Earring, compounding the problem. The person I talked to who did kill him, said it took 3-4 times to get the earring, and many Merchants will still not sell to him.<br/>
<br/>
FYI the Fisbone Earring is a moderately useful item that grants unlimited water breating and +3 Dex. In my opinion, until there is another way to obtain this item, I would try and buy it from someone, rather than try for it myself. Obviously, though, most people will not want to part with it once they get it ;-( Expect to pay a premium price...</div>
