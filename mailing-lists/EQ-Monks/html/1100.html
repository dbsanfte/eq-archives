<div id="ygrps-yiv-697090327">LOL well I guess I will be back on the list since a few of you have<br/>
written to me and told me not to let him get to me...I won&#39;t.  thanks..<br/>
and besides I found him lurking on the druid list where I have been on<br/>
for a long time and everyone knows who I am anyway.  I guess I can&#39;t<br/>
run from Dave so I will put him on filter and keep watching for the bit<br/>
of knowledge that will make my monk a better player.<br/>
