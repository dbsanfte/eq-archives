<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1247414423">As a Platoon leader extrordinaire in Lower guk (Tarew marr server) <br/>
I have worked with many different groups.  Different grouyps are ideal for<br/>
different things  and in differrent environments.<br/>
<br/>
For example:<br/>
Monks pull the best in dungeons(fein death).  I thinkg Bards do better<br/>
inthe outdoors (with soothe and speedsong).<br/>
<br/>
As a Dungeon crawler myself Ihave come to develop an affinity for a group<br/>
with a certain KEY classes.<br/>
<br/>
1)  ENCHANTER - any group with an enchater ROCKS!! NO iffs and or butts.<br/>
Enchanters make evacs obsolete (well almost almost)<br/>
<br/>
2) Cleric is a very NICE to-have but there are work arounds, like extra<br/>
nukers ( to make the fight shorter) a druid and multiple hybrids<br/>
(rangers and paladins, bards) to replace healing.<br/>
<br/>
3) It is always good to have a specialist puller. (usually thats me) Level<br/>
36 monks have decnt hp, fein death and mend all of which, when combined<br/>
with an intricate knowledge of the dugeon mean they make excellent<br/>
pullers.<br/>
<br/>
In my opinion ther is no sustitute for coordination.  No matter what your<br/>
group is composed of  - if the tanks start attacking the mob the enchater<br/>
just mezzed or no one pays attention while the cleric is bashed to<br/>
death... ther is going to be alot of bodies to collect.  <br/>
<br/>
A well organized group of players who know and appreciate teh skills of<br/>
every other player in their group, who have worked out exactly what each<br/>
person in the  group needs to do in any given situation is better off than<br/>
any of the &quot;IDEAL&quot; groups described here without such planning.<br/>
<br/>
I have gone into the depths of lower guk with no healer no wizz and no<br/>
enchanter - just 3 pallies, a rnager, a rogue and myself: we CLEANED up! -<br/>
no deaths, plenty of exp.  All I am saying is the best groups are made by<br/>
ORGANIZATION and team work - not by any specific combination of classes<br/>
and levels...<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 coppers.<br/>
