<div id="ygrps-yiv-486550348">As at 25th and often back to 24th level Monk fighting in the Aviak Village,<br/>
I can definitely say the FD Bandage trick works on Rooks and Harriers<br/>
<br/>
But it will not work if someone else is attacking the bird...<br/>
or if someone ran an Agro Bird by you while your were fighting<br/>
or if something causes the bird to go agro while you are bandaging<br/>
I have had Spell Casters Nuke a Bird while I was bandaging ( they said they<br/>
were trying to help - as I came back from Lake Rathe to Retrieve my Corpse)<br/>
and of course the Bird agro&#39;s on you , no the nuker.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Also make sure you are attacking the bird at or near it&#39;s spawn point, or it<br/>
will wander away while you are bandaging :(<br/>
<br/>
at 25th I have not been able to kill a Harry this way yet... I do not need<br/>
it any more for rooks - but I have come close - I burned through 30 bandages<br/>
and two FD&#39;s and then died ( I have seen the message &quot;caene has fallen to<br/>
the ground&quot; three times now at level 25 I have not seen that message since I<br/>
was level 19 :(<br/>
<br/>
I think once I get Dragon punch maxed I should be able to Solo Harrys, but<br/>
for now it would take at least 50 bandages, and that is just not cost<br/>
effective<br/>

&gt; I have a question for all the higher level monks out there. I am of the<br/>
26th<br/>
&gt; season and I was wondering, when you solo the aviak guards in Lake Rathe<br/>
if<br/>
&gt; you need to feign death you can, then you can stand right back up and<br/>
&gt; bandage and continue on with the fight, my question is can you do the same<br/>
&gt; to aviaks in the aviak village, I was wondering because if you can that<br/>
&gt; means I can solo harriers instead of just rooks. Thank you for your time.<br/>
Oh<br/>
&gt; by the way I bought my BP Choker last night, and now I am broke, but I am<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; satisfied broke hehehe, and I also traded for a Shralok Pack for my opal<br/>
&gt; electrum necklace too.<br/>
