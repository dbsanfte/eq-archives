<b>Subject:</b> Re: Bards pulling? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1436572980"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Once again, I am going to have to disagree. The Monk <br/>
&gt;is the 2nd best puller in the game. The best puller <br/>
&gt;is one that no one has mentioned yet: The Bard. The <br/>
&gt;reason the Bard is the best puller is because of <br/>
&gt;Kelin`s Lugubrious Lament (Lull), Kelin`s Lucid <br/>
&gt;Lullaby (AoE Lull), and Selo&#39;s Accelerando. Bards can<br/>
<br/>
&gt;use the spells to pull EXACTLY one Mob and then <br/>
&gt;hightail it back to the group. If they do pull more <br/>
&gt;they can use Kelin&#39;s Lullaby to keep them occupied or<br/>
<br/>
&gt;just haul ass to zone. All in all, if you have a Bard<br/>
<br/>
&gt;that knows what he is doing, they are the best <br/>
&gt;pullers.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Try this in sol b or lower guk...you end up with a <br/>
dead party or if you&#39;re lucky one at a druid/wizard <br/>
evac point. :)  Bard songs get resisted and most <br/>
of their crowd control type songs have a hard level<br/>
level cap that they don&#39;t work beyond.  (Charm for <br/>
example is capped at lvl 37 mobs...I forget the other <br/>
caps.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Bard songs are invaluable at higher levels though. I <br/>
&gt;would choose a Bard (that knows what they are doing) <br/>
&gt;over a Shaman/Druid/Paladin/Ranger if possible.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m operating under the assumption that the player <br/>
knows what they&#39;re doing...if that&#39;s not the case <br/>
then no class works. :)  To be honest I have never <br/>
seen a full 6 person party that I can&#39;t make *better* <br/>
by taking out the bard.  They are basically weak <br/>
enchanters when you get right down to it.  Enchanters <br/>
do what they do only better.<br/>
