<b>Subject:</b> Re: When and why do monks become such a powerhouse? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-343172550">I was having a very tough time as a monk up to 17, dying very often and<br/>
needing to be in a group at all times to make any progress.  Around<br/>
there though, i headed off to Guk, bound to grobb (use sneak to get out<br/>
past the guards), and have been there almost exclusively for the past<br/>
month and half.  I could do pretty well there in or out of a group there<br/>
for a while, but around 24 or 25 it became very hard again to do much<br/>
without a good sized party.  Now I just made 28 and it really does seem<br/>
that I am disproportionately meaner than I was 1 or 2 levels ago.  <br/>
<br/>
At 30 we get flying kick, and I think it will make us considerably more<br/>
powerful than we are the few levels before.  I&#39;ve seen monks and<br/>
warriors at high levels (40 or so) and the monks seem to do considerably<br/>
more damage that the warriors, but on the other hand, the monks get hit<br/>
alot harder than the warriors.  Already, my punches are doing more<br/>
damage than what i&#39;ve seen level 40 warriors do.  Once I accidentally<br/>
stole a kill from a party much higher than me when the fight was<br/>
obviously won and their spellcasters laid back.  <br/>
<br/>
Im hoping that after 30, with all of our attack skills learned, the road<br/>
ahead will be more steady instead of having the jumps after gaining<br/>
skills like feign (and i hope flying kick).<br/>

&gt; Subject:	[EQ-Monks] When and why do monks become such a<br/>
&gt; powerhouse?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have heard numerous times on this list &quot;just wait till you hit lvl<br/>
&gt; 30, that&#39;s when monks come into their own&quot; and similar type messages.�<br/>
&gt; My question is, what&#39;s so special about lvl 30?� Is that just the<br/>
&gt; point at which our multiple punches + special attacks catch up with<br/>
&gt; other tanks and their best weapons?<br/>
&gt; �<br/>
&gt; Also, I have heard ppl�talk about being in a lull or hitting a really<br/>
&gt; tough level.� 2 comments questions about this:<br/>
&gt; �<br/>
&gt; 1)� I just hit 15 and I have not had anything similar to this yet.� Is<br/>
&gt; it just a result of playing a character for a long time (probably<br/>
&gt; pretty intensely too)?� It seems to me that there shouldn&#39;t really be<br/>
&gt; any &quot;tough&quot; levels, just tough areas or tough monsters for a certain<br/>
&gt; level.� ie, some blue monsters are alot tougher than others at certain<br/>
&gt; lvls.� If you are in an area where all the blues are kicking your<br/>
&gt; butt, maybe just move somewhere else for a while where the exp. giving<br/>
&gt; monsters are not as tough for you.� Just an idea, seems to have worked<br/>
&gt; for me so far - any comments?<br/>
&gt; �<br/>
&gt; 2)� Are there any of these lulls after 30?� Or is it really some<br/>
&gt; magical threshhold that we just kick butt after that lvl?<br/>
&gt; �<br/>
&gt; �<br/>
&gt; Anyway, I absolutely love playing my monk so far, and I&#39;m not even as<br/>
&gt; good a tank as a warrior.� It&#39; just alot of fun being able to pummel<br/>
&gt; things with my fists and seeing (now that I&#39;m 15) 3 sets of punches<br/>
&gt; for 14 and then my special attack for 13 - man, that is so awesome.�<br/>
&gt; Sort of bored here at work today, just looking for some new<br/>
&gt; conversation pieces :)<br/>
&gt; �<br/>
&gt; Looking forward to lots of cool thoughts/ideas/comments,<br/>
&gt; �<br/>
