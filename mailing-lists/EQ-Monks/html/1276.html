<div id="ygrps-yiv-1014140723"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;  &gt;then start saving up:<br/>
&gt;  &gt;Bracer of Erolisi (ac5 5str) 30pp from OOT<br/>
&gt; They sell stuff in OOT, where? On that island in the middle? Can u wear 2<br/>
&gt; of these then?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, they&#39;re dropped in OOT.  A great place to buy things is either GFay<br/>
(Kelethin) or at the bank in North Freeport.  A lot of high level folks sell<br/>
their wares there.  The Bracers of Erollisi are a lore item, so you can only<br/>
wear one.  I&#39;m probably going to buy one today.  I&#39;d considered getting<br/>
another Serp Bracer, but I think I&#39;d rather have the 5AC and 5 STR.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  &gt;Jagged bands (ac5 3str) 30-50pp from Unrest<br/>
&gt; Not sure where Unrest is..<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unrest is located in Dagnor&#39;s Cauldron, which you get to from the<br/>
Butcherblock Mountains on Faydwer.  It&#39;s a pretty good place for people all<br/>
the way from level 13-40 or so.  Gotta watch out for trains, however.<br/>
