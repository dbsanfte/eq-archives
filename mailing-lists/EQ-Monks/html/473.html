 </span></blockquote>         Two points of contention here:<br/>
<br/>
         First, Enchanters have MANY things they are outstanding at. Buff <br/>
(Clarity and Augmentation anyone?), Debuff (obvious), Travel (Illusions, <br/>
Invis, Enduring Breath, Lev, etc.... ). Wizzies have duel roles too. They <br/>
are bar none the best damage dealers and the best for getting a group out <br/>
of a sticking situation (Evacs). The only class that I can think of that <br/>
DOESN&#39;T have more than one role in a group is a Warrior. They are Tanks <br/>
only. They don&#39;t do anything else well (and sometimes they don&#39;t even Tank <br/>
well).<br/>
<br/>
         Second, Enchanters are the best pullers in the game hands down. <br/>
They RARELY perform this function, but they can do it better and safer than <br/>
anyone else. Watch an Enchanter Lull all the Mobs and then pull the one <br/>
they want (and ONLY the one they want) back to the group. Plus, if they do <br/>
pull too many, they just Mez everything and continue pulling the single <br/>
they wanted. Once you have seen an Enchanter do this you will gain a new <br/>
level of respect. Monks are the second best pullers though.   :-)<br/>
