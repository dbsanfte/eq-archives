<div id="ygrps-yiv-14252046">Well even though they are just a dex +3 goves.  I&#39;ve been camping them anyways.  I have all the components but the humorous handled mace.  I camped it for about 9 hours yesterday.  Killed every gobbo i came across.  Somebody told me that the alchamists is a seven hour spawn, and that the placeholder is a wondering goblin.  So first thing you do is wonder through beholder and kill every single goblin you come accross.  I logged on at 7:40 MTN and a guy there said he had spawn at around 7:00.  Well good hunting to you all, and i hope you put this info to good use.</div>
