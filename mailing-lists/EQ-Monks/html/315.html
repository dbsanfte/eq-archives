&gt; Damn you guys got me all nervous now! LOL. Seriously, I prob wouldnt<br/>
&gt; try it <br/>
&gt; until atleast you havw 200+hp, I bound in grobb and NEVER had a<br/>
&gt; problem <br/>
&gt; getting out or killed. Sometimes I would get wacked for 96 twice but<br/>
&gt; no <br/>
&gt; more, I NEVER TOOK OVER 200pts at 12th level in dmg. At 7th though he<br/>
&gt; might <br/>
&gt; deal you 150 a pop though. I dontn lie, it is dangerous, but I can<br/>
&gt; testify <br/>
&gt; at 12th and up it isnt a prob. Both of my monk brothers ae bound in<br/>
&gt; grobb <br/>
&gt; and neither has had a problem getting out either. Its a game, take a <br/>
&gt; chance!, bind in GROBB, but never ever piss off a shin shaman, it&#39;s <br/>
&gt; humiliating being rooted and beat down!!!!!<br/>
