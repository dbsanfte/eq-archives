<div id="ygrps-yiv-2123281218">It&#39;s the new quest monk robe.  You need to be around lvl 40 to get it, as the <br/>
mobs you need to kill are in lower guk and in the solb king area.  The mobs <br/>
are VERY rare spawns, you get pattern and needle from them to make a robe.  <br/>
You must be a master tailor yourself, as these items are no drop.  You take a <br/>
swatch of shadow silk, bard song Johnathan&#39;s Whistling Warsong, the needle <br/>
and the pattern from your quests and combine them to give you a robe (heard <br/>
it is crimson in color) that&#39;s stats are worse than a foreman&#39;s tunic that <br/>
can be obtained around lvl 30 from sola.  So much for the wonderful monk <br/>
quest items, bleh.<br/>
