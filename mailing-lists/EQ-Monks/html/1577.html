<div id="ygrps-yiv-829579920">Ok, thanks for all the help.  I forogt to mention that I have a mesh cape.  <br/>
Any suggestions on what to have instead of that?  Also, I have heard that <br/>
getting Obsidian Bead Hoops, Dented Brass Mask, and Lumberjacks Cap or Fine <br/>
Silk Turban would be a good swap for my other equipment.  So, I have figured <br/>
that resists seem to be more important than sr, dex, and agi.  I guess that <br/>
makes sense =)<br/>
