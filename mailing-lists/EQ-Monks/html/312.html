<b>Subject:</b> RE: Hunting wisps <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1389153321">I spent 11 - 15 hunting at the toll booth. follow the path, youll run into<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
there are guards there that will kill everything (except for the wisps).<br/>
<br/>
gix has never been a problem for me, but there is a dark elf &quot;dragoon<br/>
zytl&quot; that wanders the zone.  I think he spawns near the inn, because I&#39;ve<br/>
been killed by him a few times replenishing my supplies.  even if you can<br/>
run away from him, it doesnt really matter.  he casts some nasty dot&#39;s<br/>
makes asp venom look like water.  brought my health down to 1 buble when I<br/>
was nearing the zone, he caught up with me and smaked me.<br/>

&gt; Just hunt close to the zone wall.<br/>
&gt; hunt along the zone wall opposite the dessert.  Not only is it safe there,<br/>
&gt; but you wont get lost - run with zone wall on the right to enter, and run<br/>
&gt; with the zone wall on teh left to flee ( tothe East Commonland zone)  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Pull all your wisps and kodiaks to teh zone wall to kill.  I have never<br/>
&gt; had problems with giants or ghouls in this area using this method.<br/>

&gt; &gt; West Commonlands is indeed much more populated with wisps.  Try to get SOW <br/>
&gt; &gt; from someone - offer a druid or shaman a few gold and say that you will <br/>
&gt; &gt; come to them, or try and find one and ask while you are there... If you <br/>
&gt; &gt; stay between the trail and the inn (directly west of where the trail is), <br/>
&gt; &gt; Giants will rarely bother you. Kizdean Gix is mean, but never bothered my <br/>
&gt; &gt; monk...  I usually roam around the hills surrounding the inn, and stay <br/>
&gt; &gt; close enough to the zone to make a run...  Other than than, bind yourself <br/>
&gt; &gt; to Qeynos and take the boat to Wisp (Kerra) Isle...  Find out where the <br/>
&gt; &gt; wisps spawn and camp there with a few other people... Good exp through <br/>
&gt; &gt; level 15 and excellent money...<br/>

&gt; &gt; First post to this list, woo.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;m 11th lvl on the Prexus server, and just recently obtained woven gloves.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Since I can now actually hit them, I&#39;ve been searching for wisps in E<br/>
&gt; &gt; Commonlands and finding maybe one per hour of real time (!). Now, I know<br/>
&gt; &gt; it&#39;s a busy zone and that their heavily hunted there -- is there perhaps a<br/>
&gt; &gt; better place to find them? I&#39;ve been avoiding W Commons due to the<br/>
&gt; &gt; likelihood of being crushed by hill giants and/or smacked around by the<br/>
&gt; &gt; griffs, not to mention double-teamed by young kodiaks...<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks in advance,<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
