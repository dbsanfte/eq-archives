<div id="ygrps-yiv-1182941706">I have killed dorn many times, and have never seen anything like this.  I do<br/>
know that he drops a BOOK that can be sold to merchants for about 8pp. I<br/>
don&#39;t believe Dorn has anything to do LORE wise with the iksar monks, so I<br/>
don&#39;t believe what is rumored around out there.  However, the shackle of<br/>
clay can be multiquested, as I created another monk, with the sole purpose<br/>
of testing this idea.  The early shackles are iksar only, but I believe that<br/>
the Shackle of Bronze and above can be worn by humans also, I will confirm<br/>
this once I jump in game.  Since I have shackle of Bronze.  If anyone has<br/>
the Shackle of Steel already, could you confirm who can use it, and while<br/>
your at it, please post the full stats on shackle of steel please.<br/>
<br/>
If someone is going to do the shackle quests, and they have not finished all<br/>
needed factions, but are going to use illlusions or wolf  form I suggest<br/>
gathering all the items upto the shackle of Copper and getting the box for<br/>
shackle of Bronze.  the actual shackle is givin out by Master Rinmark in<br/>
Timourous Deep.  and he initiates the shackle of Steel aswell.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
P.S.<br/>
since the original poster did not mention the lvl of his monk I did not<br/>
bother to post anything, I know of many quests, but I am not gonna post all<br/>
of them from lvl&#39;s 1 - 60 , so please specify your lvl, and server if you<br/>
read this, and maybe I&#39;ll send some quests to keep you busy.<br/>

&gt; RE: [EQ-Monks] Monk QuestsThis used to be true, but it no longer drops the<br/>
newbie note.  Now it&#39;s a book about Charassis.<br/>
&gt; Even if you multiquested the first shackle, you couldn&#39;t wear them,<br/>
they&#39;re iksar only.<br/>

&gt;   can anyone confirm this.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   i remember seeing on the net somewhere that if you kill Dorn (in north<br/>
ro, not sure which surname) a Dark elf assassin spawns, if you kill him a<br/>
Widow mite spawns and if you kill that it drops the Iskar monk initiation<br/>
book (or note) the one they start with and give to their guild master.<br/>
according to this web page a human monk could use the scroll to join the<br/>
iskar monk guild and thus gain access to the shackle quests...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   has anyone ever seen or heard anything like this elsewhere ???<br/>
