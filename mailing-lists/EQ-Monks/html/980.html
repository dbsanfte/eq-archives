<div id="ygrps-yiv-812711851">I just wanted to let you know about the AC issue and monks.  We do have <br/>
as good AC as warriors.  At lvl 50, my AC is 824 base, and that&#39;s not with my <br/>
tankin gear, I can easily bump it up to over 850.<br/>
    Now for my lil rant.  HOW can you say using FD pulling was exploiting on <br/>
the planes??  Do you know what happens now?  Even more of a cheat if you ask <br/>
me.  Just takes longer, cause now after FD, you just need to /exit and wait 3 <br/>
min before loggin back into the server.  I have been lvl 50 for about 2 or 3 <br/>
months now, and this nerf has seriously hurt our skills.  We are pullers, <br/>
that is our main contribution to a party after we get FD and hone our skills. <br/>
 We can still do this job, but it makes it MUCH more difficult and time <br/>
comsuming.  Yes you can get around it, BUT, IMHO, I now think we have to use <br/>
more of a cheat to get around it.  There are other ways, yes, but WHY (and <br/>
believe me, I&#39;ve sent in MANY feedbacks and petitions) did Verant change this <br/>
skill.  Okay, I&#39;m done, thanks for listening all.<br/>
