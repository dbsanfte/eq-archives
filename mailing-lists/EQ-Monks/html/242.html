Do not fret!<br/>
<br/>
True, advancing does take some time.  I too have gone through bouts of shortened play time and RL commitments.  I think we all run into levels that seem to take FOREVER to pass.<br/>
<br/>
I found my personal hell ranges to be 14-17 and 22-24.  I think it took me almost a month to do 3 levels.  Now that I got through 24, I&#39;ve noticed a marked inprovement in my skills and exp gain.  I just hit 25 and got Dragon Punch; the satisfaction I get from hitting for higher rounds makes the hard work and persiverance well worth it.<br/>
<br/>
Hell levels tend to appear just as you max out your special attacks and have to wait for the &#39;Next Big Monk Skill&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
Finding a good group does take time also.  I was fortunate to find a great group of friends back when I was around level 11 or so.  We have all be companions ever since, now our crowd runs around 20 people or so (18 - 31 range), all changing groups as the need arises or play time coincides.  <br/>
<br/>
Do shouts often, if you find a group that looks out for each other, latch onto them and build the friendship.  If someone doesn&#39;t play their part in the group (cleric fights like a wizard and not a healer) it prolly means that they USED to play that class and haven&#39;t learned to play their new strengths.  This is your indication to move on.<br/>
<br/>
Hang in there Brother, all will come in time.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;Fellow monks,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I need help.  I have lately lost interest in my monk and in the game in &gt;general.  I hit lvl 16 about a month ago and have been stuck there ever &gt;since.  About that time, I started playing less due to RL commitments.  &gt;Even now, I can only play 2-3 hours at a time max.  I have been hanging &gt;out around Freeport:  Commons, NRo, Oasis area.  I even tried going to &gt;Faydward (sp?) and spending time there.  I just can&#39;t get into it.  I &gt;think my biggest problem is it is SOOO hard to find a good group.  I was &gt;grouped in the Oasis last week and had a cleric who refused to heal &gt;during a battle, all he wanted to do was beat on the MOBs.  This led to &gt;me dying 3 times in short succession.  Also, what is more frustrating &gt;that running to the derv camp in W Comm and trying to get into a group &gt;when there are already 2 groups camping the place and they refuse to &gt;even acknowledge you by replying to a simple /tell?  The only time I get &gt;an indication that they know I exist is when one of their wizards keeps &gt;stealing MOBs from me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I need some advice/encouragement on what to do for a couple of levels!  &gt;I have tried starting a  necromancer, revisited a lvl 6 warrior, and &gt;started a cleric in this time also.  Problem is, this game does not get &gt;interesting until lvl 8-10 or so (usually a caster&#39;s 3 set of spells).  &gt;If you&#39;ve played one newbie class, you&#39;ve played them all - and you have &gt;to invest SOOO much time to just get to a level where each class starts &gt;getting interesting.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I really do like my monk and I realize that it starts getting better &gt;after FD, but I am just in this funk and need some help getting out....<br/>
