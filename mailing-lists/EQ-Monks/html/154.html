<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1371004706">Yes I have experienced this problem 3 times in the last week or so. Once<br/>
with a Festering Hag (which I chalked up to an interrupted spell), once to a<br/>
non-casting Dry Bone Skeleton, and most recently to Droon. This is exactly<br/>
what I was referring to in my previous notes, the fact that even after a<br/>
successful Feign, I still get killed. Actually, in the past week or so, I<br/>
have not had FD actually work for me. I also petitioned about it, and the<br/>
response I got from Sandolin was &quot;Sometimes monsters can see thru even a<br/>
successful Feign Death.&quot; My question is now no longer why/ how did I die<br/>
with a successful feign, but rather if a monster &quot;sees thru&quot;<br/>
a successful feign, how the heck is that feign considered successful?<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; In my experience it seems that time has been the important factor in a <br/>
&gt; monster&#39;s agro level. For example it would seem like no matter how long I <br/>
&gt; lay there a Sand Giant will always come looking for me once I stand up. <br/>
&gt; That&#39;s why I bolt to to the zone after a run-in with them no matter what. <br/>
&gt; But of course this seems fitting with the way sand giants behavior has <br/>
&gt; always shown it be one of the most hatefully aggressive creatures in the <br/>
&gt; game. i.e. the way they are more willing to switch targets from who they <br/>
&gt; were chasing to something else which just got a tad bit closer. All they <br/>
&gt; want is to whoop some butt. It makes them happy.<br/>
&gt; On the other hand I&#39;ve noticed some creatures will seem to not come back<br/>
&gt; if <br/>
&gt; just wait a long time. And still others seem to not come back after just a<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; little bit even if I can see in zoomed out view that they didn&#39;t even go<br/>
&gt; but <br/>
&gt; just out of sight or what some call their alleged radius of aggression.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But now my question. I had a couple of experiences recently where I was<br/>
&gt; not <br/>
&gt; fighting a spell-casting creature and auto-attack was turned off. Also<br/>
&gt; there <br/>
&gt; was no failure message. Yet I died. Once was during a packet-loss spike <br/>
&gt; (showed me feign and everything but when the PL cleared I was dead) and<br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; other I saw no PL and I hadn&#39;t had any lag all day! But everything seemed <br/>
&gt; fine after I feigned until about 10 seconds later a flood of damage<br/>
&gt; reports <br/>
&gt; came through with my slain message too. The worst part was I feigned<br/>
&gt; because <br/>
&gt; I couldn&#39;t take my opponent (Dorn) even though I&#39;m level 21 but I had 4 <br/>
&gt; bubbles of health when I feigned! And suddenly poof I&#39;m dead. I fought him<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; at level 20 and I know Dorn can beat me but it takes him longer than that.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So I contacted a guide who related that he really didn&#39;t know much about <br/>
&gt; &quot;the ways of the monk&quot;. Anyways he said it might be a bug of some sort and<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; he filed it as such and recommended that I file a bug report too. Anyways<br/>
&gt; I <br/>
&gt; just wanna know if anyone else has had the same problem before?<br/>
