<div id="ygrps-yiv-637689112">I like druid and ranger pullers in certain zones over monks just for the<br/>
carpet harmony effect.  Basically the ranger or druid carpet cast&#39;s<br/>
harmony till he reach&#39;s the MoB he wants.  He then cast&#39;s at the MoB and<br/>
pulls him from his original spot through the carpet cast harmony zone<br/>
without pulling anything else.  Unrest/Mistmoore/Cazic are very nice<br/>
places for this.  I have yet to go on a serious LGuk trip yet but I assume<br/>
they would do just as good there.  <br/>
<br/>
Monks I would have to say are tied for number one with druid/ranger if not<br/>
the best.  They can pull multiple mobs....FD....loose one or two, pop up<br/>
and pull the remaining ones.  Rinse Repeat until they get the desired<br/>
effect or MoB.  They can also just FD long enough to cancel the entire<br/>
pull altogether....<br/>
