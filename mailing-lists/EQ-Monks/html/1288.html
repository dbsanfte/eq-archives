I&#39;m sorry, but what are you talking about?  Herrick is a level 12 monk talking<br/>
about saving up scarab carapaces for 1.7gp each!  Do you think this guy has<br/>
30pp to go buy a bracer of erolisi? or 100pp to get a silver-plated bracer?<br/>
Please tell me what armor better than cured even a level 18 can go get?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just a little tired of people who are twinked telling new players what <br/>
they<br/>
should be wearing:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;oh, man, that cured hat sucks, go get a froglock crown&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There is a lot better stuff that Harrick can get, but he definitely <br/>
shouldn&#39;t worry<br/>
about it now.  He has to get to 30 or so first.<br/>

&gt;monk that is still wearing cured is my Cured Silk Ghi (cause I just LOVE the<br/>
&gt;way my female monk looks wearing it)  but every other location has a better<br/>
&gt;amrmor peice.  Goto EQ Stomped and they have a special section on monk armor<br/>
&gt;and you can compare and contrast them, and see what you want to hunt for<br/>

&gt; &gt;Hi all,<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I&#39;m a level 12 monk who now has a full set of cured and some wu&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt;gauntlets. (It took long enough to save up)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;The thing is I don&#39;t have a clue what to buy next? The only better armour I<br/>
&gt; &gt;know of is that Plane of Fear, Shiverback stuff.. At level 12, I think not.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;So I guess that leaves earrings and rings? What should I go for? I<br/>
&gt; &gt;currently have no earrings and two +2 dex rings, + 1 AC derv rings..<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Any suggestions welcomed!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;PS I have discovered a useful (bug?) Scarab (sand/Giant) carapaces weigh<br/>
&gt; &gt;0.0kgs. You can solo these at about level 10, and since the loot doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt;weigh anything it&#39;s all good! (Ok at higher levels 1.7gp per shell isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt;going to get anyone very excited is it!)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Cheers,<br/>
