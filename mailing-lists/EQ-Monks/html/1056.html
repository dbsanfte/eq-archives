<div id="ygrps-yiv-528064564">Under the advice of many people, I have moved my<br/>
hunting ground to south karana.  I am currently<br/>
hunting in tha aviak town and am VERY pleased with<br/>
what I have seen.<br/>
<br/>
Easily managed to find a bind to the Arena.  No more<br/>
running ALL THE FRIKIN way down the path in East<br/>
Karana.  Now its just a short swim.<br/>
<br/>
However, I have one problem.  Where can I sell?  the<br/>
Aviak merchant won&#39;t sell to humans and I would really<br/>
like to find a place to buy bandages.  Is their<br/>
anywhere relatively NEAR the aviak town where this can<br/>
be done?<br/>
