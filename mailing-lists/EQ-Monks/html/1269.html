<div id="ygrps-yiv-160912899">Personally, I lean towards Str/AC/Agi/HP in that order. A lot of it depends<br/>
upon your typical role in a group. I usually hunt with a ranger and paladin,<br/>
who both taunt and we can spread the damage out rather nicely among our<br/>
group. When outdoors, the ranger like to harmonize and do the pulling. When<br/>
indoors, the job is usually mine.<br/>

So, folks, we all recently heard *with disappointment* about verant<br/>
employees posting about DEX and AGI - they seem to be a lot less important<br/>
than we hoped for.  In light of this new information - what do all you monks<br/>
out there see as the most important stats for a monk, now? How would you<br/>
focus your items (ie STR? AC? HPS? AGI? DEX? STA?)? And how would you<br/>
distribute your starting points?  Maybe a few could name some equipment that<br/>
backs up their opinions.<br/>
Thanks in advance for everyone&#39;s input =)<br/>
