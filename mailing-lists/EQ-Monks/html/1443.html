<div id="ygrps-yiv-415635070">I got feign death last level and have had no luck with it at all. <br/>
I&#39;ve been faithfully practicing (my death screams are still ringing<br/>
in my ears) and my skill is up to around 70, but it&#39;s only worked one<br/>
time.  Will this ever be useful?  Also what good is sneak and instill<br/>
doubt?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
Daina</div>
