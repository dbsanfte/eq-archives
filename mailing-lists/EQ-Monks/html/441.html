<b>Subject:</b> Monk hand speed <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-286809216">I seem to recall reading someone from Verant saying that monk hand to hand<br/>
attack speed is &quot;never lower than 30&quot;... that would seem to suggest that<br/>
there is some variation, either based on level, skill, Dex, ???  I&#39;m 15th<br/>
lvl, and I honestly cannot claim to have noticed any speed difference thus<br/>
far, regardless of agi, dex, or level changes... maybe it&#39;s just too subtle<br/>
to be noticed in the increments that I am changing those stats.<br/>
<br/>
I agree that a bare fist should be faster than most weapons - definitely<br/>
faster than any sword outside, possibly, of a fencing weapon.  Axes, etc.,<br/>
should likewise have significantly longer delays.  The only weapons that<br/>
should be faster than an open fist are those that carry some magical speed<br/>
bonus.  Maybe that&#39;s most magic weapons, maybe it&#39;s just a few... at the<br/>
very least, no non-magical weapon should out speed the fist that wields it.<br/>
