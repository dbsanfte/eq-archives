&gt;But the problem is that there are those at my level or close to it who<br/>
&gt;*can* afford this stuff.  Why, because they have been killing and looting<br/>
&gt;and I have been RPing.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t see the problem here.  If you are having fun rp-ing, who cares what<br/>
equipment you have or don&#39;t have.  if you want hi/mid level stuff at lower<br/>
levels you may have to sacrifice rping for powergaming.  that&#39;s just a choice<br/>
you have to make.<br/>
