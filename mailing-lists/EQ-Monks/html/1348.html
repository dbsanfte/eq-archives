<b>Subject:</b> RE: Re[2]:Experience and Twinking <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-626873451"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I am sorry, but is this discussion about twinking or the fact that you<br/>
&gt;started playing the game before I did?  It sounds like you have some issues<br/>
&gt;to deal with here and are very hostile about this discussion.  I started<br/>
&gt;this thread as an intelleuctual discussion, not a flame war.  Twinkers have<br/>
&gt;no more rights than Kill stealers in my estimation.  Do you feel that we<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Equating Twinking with kill stealing is wrong.  KSing is anti-social and<br/>
directly &quot;harms&quot; others.  Twinking, while it can be argued of an indirect<br/>
approach, does not.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;who started after you automatically owe you repsect because you have played<br/>
&gt;a GAME longer than we have?  I don&#39;t think so.  I, too, spend my time in<br/>
&gt;dungeons, dying and dying again, in the search for elusive  items and<br/>
&gt;experience.  Items and experience are becoming harder and harder to find<br/>
&gt;due to server overcrowding and spawn camping.  To me, you were lucky that<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What&#39;s with respect?  So I&#39;ve been playing for a year - I&#39;ve put in more<br/>
time, I&#39;ve paid more money, I&#39;ve seen more things - does that mean you owe<br/>
me respect?  Hardly.  Sorta a life metaphor...  My parents have more money<br/>
than me, have more possessions, have more everything it seems - I&#39;m scraping<br/>
by and trying to buy a crappy home and they&#39;re cruising the states,<br/>
retirement style.  So if they have a kid, they&#39;ll probably give that kid a<br/>
lot more than they gave me... they have the resources for it.  Not fair?<br/>
Sure.  Does it really change my life or actions?  Hell no.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;you didn&#39;t have to deal with people camping spawning points early in the<br/>
&gt;ife of the game.  It was probably easier for you to find creatures of the<br/>
&gt;appropriate level.  When I go out looking, I often find that people will<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yea.  Obviously next time a new server goes up, create a monk in Freeport<br/>
and see how long it takes you to get to level 2.  This is neither here nor<br/>
there, but this is a serious case of &quot;The Grass Is Greener....&quot;   Contrary<br/>
to popular belief, it gets much harder to get exp at higher levels, because<br/>
the load of exp bearing creatures that don&#39;t require 17 groups to hold down<br/>
gets smaller and smaller.  Like I said, not really on topic.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;jump on monsters, yelling &quot;Mine!  Mine&quot;, like some 2 year old, because they<br/>
&gt;need the XP or the items.  Do not make assupmtions about me.  I do not take<br/>
&gt;for granted that I can buy serp bracers for 200pp or any of the other<br/>
&gt;things.  Why?  Because I play this game for adventuring purposes.  At 17th<br/>
&gt;level, I figured that the 200 pp I had stashed away would last me quite a<br/>
&gt;while.  That is 200pp I earned the hard way.  No one gave it to me.  It is<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Get off the cross, we need the wood.  99% of all players have gone through<br/>
this.  And by the way, I didn&#39;t have my first 200 pp until I was well into<br/>
my 20&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;twinking that is one of the causes of the drop in prices for items.  If<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Bull - absolute bull.  Twinkers aren&#39;t selling the items they&#39;re wearing.<br/>
Lower prices, more supply.  Less Supply, higher prices.  Perhaps you&#39;ve<br/>
heard of it?  The ole &quot;Supply and Demand&quot; theory.  I just can&#39;t figure out<br/>
why a glowing stein is still selling for 250 pp on Quell.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;every 6th level character has access ti items intended for a 20th level<br/>
&gt;character, those items will decrease in value.  As for the fact that you<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So by your theory...  if there was a magic level limit and such...  the<br/>
prices would go up???  No, you&#39;ve created a higher inventory with a smaller<br/>
consumer base.  In other words, you&#39;ve made a bad situation worse.   Again,<br/>
this is part of my revolutionary &quot;With greater supply comes cheaper prices&quot;<br/>
theory.  Twinkers cause prices to fall?  Puh-lease.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;shouldn&#39;t have to invest 9 months into a new character:  Why not?  Are you<br/>
&gt;afraid that you will get bored?  You already have intimate knowledge of<br/>
&gt;most of the areas of the world that you can use to your advantage.  Why<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The fact that it was his 9 months and his items means he can do any damn<br/>
thing he wants to.  Including, but not limited to, creating a Troll<br/>
Enchanter and trying to twink it&#39;s INT up to 500.<br/>
<br/>
should you add the capability of walking around with items that your<br/>
character would never have had to chance to obtain?  To be honest, I do not<br/>
have a problem with a character getting a sword or a piece of armor from<br/>
someone, even another of the PCs that a player owns..  There are plenty of<br/>
historical and fantasy based accounts of this, but when someone steps onto<br/>
the stage, a new character, decked out in itmes that should belong to a<br/>
10th level or 20th level or 30th level characters, it really cheeses those<br/>
of us who are trying to earn the items legitimately.  Every item that goes<br/>
into a twinkers hands, is one less that I or another honest player can earn.<br/>
<br/>
BUZZ!!!!  Thank you for playing!  Except for the MASSIVELY rare spawns,<br/>
there are several holes in your theory.  First, most of the ultra-rare items<br/>
are on very very high level creatures.  So honest player #1 that is level 18<br/>
- sorry, you would never legitimately get this item.  Secondly, most of the<br/>
servers that have been around for a while... there&#39;s at least 2,000 of<br/>
everything it seems, except as I said, the ultra rares, that honest players<br/>
have no chance of getting while they&#39;re young.<br/>
<br/>
Twink used to really mean something.  Now all it means is someone who has<br/>
better stuff than you do.<br/>
