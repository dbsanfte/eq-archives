<div id="ygrps-yiv-948186297">No, maybe they didn&#39;t see it when they FIRST programmed the game, but I <br/>
played in beta and let me assure you, Verant saw what it could do when <br/>
testing it.  And if you think it makes the game too easy, I strongly <br/>
encourage you to go to PoH and try to see what it would be like w/o monks <br/>
pulling.  Impossible.  Sure a group of maybe 50 lvl 50s could do it, but <br/>
whenever you get more than 24 ppl in an enclosed area fighting mobs, you <br/>
normally have 1/6 of the ppl goin ld. And it get worse as you add more ppl, <br/>
so plz tell me how anybody could do it, I&#39;m more than willing to listen.</div>
