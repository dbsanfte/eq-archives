&gt;Ok. Point well taken. Let me try to re-phrase and remain a calmer, more<br/>
&gt;productive Praelor =).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Does twinking affect more than the twinked? IMHO yes it does. My PoF <br/>
&gt;example<br/>
&gt;illustrates that, even though someone has pointed out an alternate <br/>
&gt;reasoning<br/>
&gt;on why the level restriction was put into place (I wont go into a debate on<br/>
&gt;that as it is a different subject altogether. Suffice it to say that the<br/>
&gt;alternate reasoning was just as valid as mine and I agree with it).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My stance is not one of jealousy or envy. If it were, I would have my full<br/>
&gt;shiverback tonight. I am in a guild with lvl 35+ members who had invited me<br/>
&gt;a number of times into PoF with them for Shiverback before it was closed <br/>
&gt;off<br/>
&gt;to me. Each time I had declined. I knew I was not ready for such a venture.<br/>
&gt;They have invited me to the depths of Lower Guk, and again I have declined.<br/>
&gt;Soon I will be ready for Guk, and then and only then will I go. Do I want<br/>
&gt;the azure sleeves and serp bracers? Absolutely. Will I buy them if I get an<br/>
&gt;opportunity? Definitely. Would I accept one as a gift? Perhaps. It would<br/>
&gt;depend upon who it was coming from. There is a thin line between the<br/>
&gt;occasional gift and outright twinking. A full suit of Shiverback at lvl 19<br/>
&gt;is not a gift. A BP necklace at lvl 19 could be. Would I take Praelor and <br/>
&gt;go<br/>
&gt;out and buy a full suit of steel plate (or whatever.. I don&#39;t know armors<br/>
&gt;much outside what monks can wear) for a new cleric I was starting? Not a<br/>
&gt;chance. And yet I have a friend who did just that. And did it while he owed<br/>
&gt;me 100 plat! That is the selfishness I refer to. And that is the type of<br/>
&gt;behavior that reflects upon all monks. When you think back to last weekend,<br/>
&gt;do you first remember what a grand time you had in that group in Aviaks, or<br/>
&gt;do you first remember that &lt;expletive deleted&gt; who did nothing but steal<br/>
&gt;everyone&#39;s kills in Pickclaws all night? Do you remember the fun<br/>
&gt;conversation you had with that little gnome on the boat to Butcherblock, or<br/>
&gt;do you remember that blue con in Solusek running around in full rubicite <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;duel wielding 2 Ykesha (or whatever that sword is called) shouting for <br/>
&gt;help?<br/>
&gt;People tend to remember negative experiences first, negative impressions<br/>
&gt;first. I personally have never grouped with someone who was obviously a<br/>
&gt;twink, and have removed myself from groups when one would join. I do not<br/>
&gt;wish to be associated with that type of selfish attitude, as I think it<br/>
&gt;looks bad for all those who are associated with it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I know there is no stopping twinking. And believe it or not, I don&#39;t get <br/>
&gt;mad<br/>
&gt;in game about it. I have developed a definite rp attitude and opinion<br/>
&gt;towards the twink. More often than not I chuckle softly to myself and go my<br/>
&gt;merry way, avoiding the issue in-game entirely and knowing that this poor<br/>
&gt;lvl 15 in full steel will perish in the oasis just as many times as I did <br/>
&gt;in<br/>
&gt;woven and mesh. But OOC I will be as vociferous and adamantly against<br/>
&gt;twinking as my nerves will allow me =).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And now for a little fun =)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hamlet, the Twink of Norrath<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;To twink, or not to twink, that is the question,<br/>
&gt;Whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer<br/>
&gt;The slings and arrows of outrageous demons<br/>
&gt;Or take gifts amongst a sea of friends,<br/>
&gt;And by opposing, confuse them, to die to twink<br/>
&gt;No more, and by a twink, to say we end<br/>
&gt;The heartache, and the thousand nat&#39;ral shocks<br/>
&gt;That flesh is heir to; Tis a attitude<br/>
&gt;Devout to be wished to die than twink,.<br/>
&gt;To twink, perchance to die; Aye there&#39;s the rub,<br/>
&gt;For in that death of twink what eyes may come<br/>
&gt;When we have shuffled off this mortal coil<br/>
&gt;Must give us pause, there&#39;s the respect<br/>
&gt;That makes mockery of so long life.<br/>
&gt;For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,<br/>
&gt;The demons claw, the high level&#39;d costume,<br/>
&gt;the pangs of envied gear, the lawless delay,<br/>
&gt;The insolence of office, and the spurns<br/>
&gt;Of the patient merit him unworthy that takes<br/>
&gt;Before his time a suit of gleaming rubicite.<br/>
&gt;Who would these black pearls bear,<br/>
&gt;To eat and sleep under a pamper&#39;d life<br/>
&gt;But then dread possible death in<br/>
&gt;The undiscovered country from who&#39;s corpse<br/>
&gt;No armor returns, puzzles the will,<br/>
&gt;And makes us rather bear that gear we have,<br/>
&gt;Than fly to others that we cannot ourselves obtain.<br/>
&gt;Lack of conscience does make Twinkers of us all.<br/>
&gt;And thus the natural hue of evolution<br/>
&gt;Is sickly ore with the pale cast of fire emeralds<br/>
&gt;And enterprises of great pitch and moment<br/>
&gt;With this regard, their currents turn awry<br/>
&gt;And loose the name of action. Soft you now,<br/>
&gt;For Norrath calls for heroes and I shall answer:<br/>
&gt;Be all our twinks outnumbered..<br/>

&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt; it is not about jealousy. It is about taking pride in actually <br/>
&gt;earning<br/>
&gt; &gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt;  gear I wear and knowing that what I have, I got for myself, whether by<br/>
&gt; &gt;  earning coin enough to buy it or by venturing and slaying the beast <br/>
&gt;that<br/>
&gt; &gt;  carries it. I got it. I did not have it handed to me on a silver <br/>
&gt;platter<br/>
&gt; &gt; by<br/>
&gt; &gt;  some high level friend who already has no problem getting as many as he<br/>
&gt; &gt;  wants.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;  Kind of like that spoiled rich kid in high school who was driving the<br/>
&gt; &gt;  Corvette. Sure he looks cool, but you know damn well he didn&#39;t pay for <br/>
&gt;it<br/>
&gt; &gt; or<br/>
&gt; &gt;  the insurance that comes with it. Would I like to own a vette? you bet.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  Would I take one if my folks offered it to me? hell no. All a matter of<br/>
&gt; &gt; self<br/>
&gt; &gt;  pride vs. selfishness &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;  Jealousy. Who cares what else anyone has, simply because they had it<br/>
&gt; &gt; handed<br/>
&gt; &gt; to them? If you are essentially concerned with what you&#39;ve earned, then<br/>
&gt; &gt; why<br/>
&gt; &gt; does what others have bother you so much? It sounds like envy, and it at<br/>
&gt; &gt; best, reactive, rather than proactive. Bottled up ressentiment <br/>
&gt;expressing<br/>
&gt; &gt; itself.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;  I am not twinked. Everything I have, I have earned. But the fact that<br/>
&gt; &gt; someone else has not is irrelevant to me (unless I am harmed by it, as <br/>
&gt;in<br/>
&gt; &gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; PoF example someone gave earlier.) Be proud of what you&#39;ve earned, and <br/>
&gt;do<br/>
&gt; &gt; your best to have fun.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;  Just my thoughts on this matter... And btw, Praelor, I have enjoyed <br/>
&gt;many<br/>
&gt; &gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; your thoughtful posts. I disagree with you about this, though.<br/>
