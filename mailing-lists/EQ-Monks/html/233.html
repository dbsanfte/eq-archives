<div id="ygrps-yiv-637528849">Hail, all. I play Moorgard, a lev 12 Freeport monk on the Povar server. I<br/>
don&#39;t have a lot of time to play these days, as I&#39;ve just switched jobs and<br/>
am getting used to a new routine. As such, level 12 is taking me forever to<br/>
get through. I hang out in N Ro and East/West Comm a lot.<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to learning tips from you more experienced monks out there.<br/>
Right now my main goals are gaining levels and trying to finish a set of<br/>
mesh armor. Anything else I should be shooting for?<br/>
<br/>
I would appreciate any tips you guys have on good boots and where to get them.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else think it&#39;s a real shame that mesh armor looks just like leather<br/>
when worn? If mesh had a grey/silver or black kind of look to it, I think<br/>
monks would have a much more unique appearance.<br/>
