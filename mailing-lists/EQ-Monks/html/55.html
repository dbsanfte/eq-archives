Has anyone ever found the feign death skill to be actually useful in <br/>
getting<br/>
creatures that are attacking you to stop? I have been practicing non-stop<br/>
since I got the skill and it is now at 50, but fighting crocodiles and<br/>
caiman, not once has feigning death, whether i fell to the ground or not,<br/>
stopped them from biting me. Is there something about the use of the skill<br/>
that I am missing or is it just not that useful?<br/>
<br/>
