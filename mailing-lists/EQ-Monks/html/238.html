<div id="ygrps-yiv-1763691618"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I would appreciate any tips you guys have on good boots and where to get them.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>	Heh... I was stuck with Patchwork boots (leather weighed too <br/>
much) until about level 27 when I finally got hold of some Kobold <br/>
Hide Boots.  I&#39;ve gone through the equipment lists, and besides the <br/>
Shiverback stuff, that&#39;s about as good as we&#39;re likely to get. <br/>
(Possible exception of the JMan boots, but I&#39;m not going for them <br/>
because the AC sucks and they&#39;re one of the most heavily camped items <br/>
in the game.)<br/>
