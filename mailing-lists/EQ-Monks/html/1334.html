&gt;Under 9?  thats impressive... what backpacks/boxes do you use... if any?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I generally am at 14 or so... of course I carry an Sewn Evil Eye Pack<br/>
&gt;(3wt) and a few Large bags which are 1 wt each<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I know its very un-monk of me but I have never abided by the 14 stone<br/>
&gt;rule.  By this I mean that many monks will never loot past 14 stones but<br/>
&gt;I think thats stupid and you will never make money.  Sure your losing AC<br/>
&gt;and can potentially die faster but its a risk you take to actually make<br/>
&gt;some money in the game.  I am currently fighting in High Keep which<br/>
&gt;rules because its a short job upstairs to the bank =)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyone, personally I would never take 2ac for and additional 2.4 wt...<br/>
&gt;one thing that is important for monks is ac/wt ration, not ac in itself<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Cured Silk Shoulders: 3ac 0.1wt  30ac/wt<br/>
&gt;Lizardscale Mantle: 5ac 2.5wt 2ac/wt<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In that respect it is much more favorable to take the shoulders<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Its all a matter of preference though<br/>

carry any bags. I also only loot gem stones, words and runes or other low<br/>
weight items. Lately, I have been adventuring in Unrest, so all of my fine<br/>
steel goes to my allies, and I try to horn in on the occasional piece of<br/>
amber,<br/>
pearl or topaz. They have similar sell back rates to merchants, so it does not<br/>
affect the kind of income you bring in. Weight to AC ratio has never been a<br/>
qualifying factor for me. If we have learned anything these past few weeks, it<br/>
is that physical attributes have little affect on melee classes, while AC<br/>
keeps<br/>
us all alive. The higher AC I can fit on me and still remain under 14 stones,<br/>
the better. But, as you say, it is personal preference.<br/>
