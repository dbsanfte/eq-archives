<div id="ygrps-yiv-399695029">My View on Tinking<br/>
<br/>
Fist, I have twinked another character.  I have a level 21 druid who<br/>
been twinked.  I believe that I have the right to twink this character,<br/>
here is why:<br/>
<br/>
1)  The money I invested into this character was my own.  My money which<br/>
I earned, therefore I have the right to *technically* spend it as I<br/>
please.  I chose to spend it to purchase items with the intent of<br/>
starting another character.<br/>
<br/>
2)  I did not camp any spawns to twink this character, all of his item&#39;s<br/>
were purchased through bazaar&#39;s or were items off my main character<br/>
which I no longer needed.<br/>
<br/>
There are many ways to look at twinking.  My view is that there is<br/>
nothing wrong with it.  Perhaps there is something wrong with camping<br/>
items for the sole purpose of twinking but I do not think this can be<br/>
avoided without removing a interesting part of the game.  Being able to<br/>
twink allowed me to start a character and be able to move quickly<br/>
through the lower levels.  I had invested the time and effort into<br/>
making a non-twink main character.  Why shouldn&#39;t I with the money I<br/>
have earned to start another character off with some pretty decent<br/>
equipment.  Yes, it does remove some fun out of the game.  Your always<br/>
&quot;twinked&quot; in that you never had the joy of earning that first pp or<br/>
buying those +2 wis rings out of your own money but thats a personal<br/>
decision.<br/>
<br/>
The only way that twinkers stop normal gameplay is by farming items. <br/>
Aside from that being twinked will only help you level faster.  You will<br/>
never see a group shout in the oasis: &quot;Highway Group looking for Tank<br/>
level 14-17, TWINKS ONLY&quot;  It just doesn&#39;t happen, never will.  Unless<br/>
you do some SERIOUS twinking, like full crafted and mithril 2 hander on<br/>
a level 15 warrior won&#39;t be that much better than a non-twinked.  Sure<br/>
you WILL be better, but you are losing a certain part of the game.<br/>
<br/>
The main reason I twinked my druid was because when my monk got boring I<br/>
would have another character I could play who is very different from my<br/>
monk and I would not have to earn all the money.  Call me wrong, flame<br/>
me, do what you will but Verant will NOT stop twinking and there is not<br/>
much we can do about it.  <br/>
<br/>
Good day to you all<br/>
