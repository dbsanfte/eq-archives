<div id="ygrps-yiv-1216540344">I would just like to say to the person that used the 26th level Bard to get <br/>
stuff that fine great if no one else wa around. I on the other hand have <br/>
walked into RE to try for a BIBS for a friend and found a 45th lvl Necro <br/>
sitting in the room. There he was taking away from us. I do not care if you <br/>
add to your character if it hurts no one else, but in the case of something <br/>
like a BIBS where it is a fairly rare drop your taking one might mean the <br/>
difference from some poor appropriate level guy sitting there half an hour <br/>
our 3 to 4 hours. The Onyx Ear rings are a frequent drop, but some of the <br/>
other items especially the items that started this whole debate are not. Can <br/>
anyone honestly say on this post that they have never  walked and saw someone <br/>
obviously not there for the hunting, but instead for the items? I have <br/>
absolutely no problem if someone gives there second character 1,000,000 plat <br/>
to buy everything in the game, but when they start having 45th lvl Necro&#39;s <br/>
sitting in front of me and my friend trying to get a BIBS that becomes a <br/>
problem to me. If something drops maybe 3 or 4 times a day you have taken <br/>
something from someone else. For you to say that you did not is just plain <br/>
lieing to yourself. Again I have no problem with giving you character a leg <br/>
up. I am doing something like that woth my Monk. During the course of my <br/>
regular hunting if I find something that could be useful for the Druid I plan <br/>
on someday making I stick it in the bank. I will not though go out and camp <br/>
something for him. I will not make someone wait in line behind me while I go <br/>
for something that my current character does not need.</div>
