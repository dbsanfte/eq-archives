<div id="ygrps-yiv-266213475">Thanks, and yea, I agree, I really didn&#39;t go hard core EQ till I was about <br/>
16th level, and only reason I did then was because I was getting really <br/>
bored waiting for that big FD.  Best thing for a monk to do would be to get <br/>
that cured silk or mesh, which ever is more redily available and then just <br/>
save and wait for good items to present themselves at good costs.  It&#39;s what <br/>
I did, I just happen to have gotten some really good opertunities.<br/>

&gt;My apologies, Shelza, I was too quick to judge your intentions there.<br/>
&gt;However I still think Harrick is far better off ignoring equipment for the<br/>
&gt;moment.  The best equipment he could save up for right now would be:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Onyx earrings (2 agi) 5pp or so from Blackburrow<br/>
&gt;Spiked collar (ac3 3str) 5pp or so from Blackburrow<br/>
&gt;Lockjaw vest (ac12 5sta) 20-30pp from Oasis<br/>
&gt;Bracer of erolisi (ac5 5str) 25-30pp from Ocean of Tears<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The Wu&#39;s gauntlets is not worth the money for him right now.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;To be perfectly honest, Shelza, cured silk can stay in a lot of locations <br/>
&gt;on a<br/>
&gt;monk until he or she hits the planes.  Swap out to gear that gives you <br/>
&gt;better<br/>
&gt;AC/HP than cured as you can afford it, but it&#39;s only going to make a<br/>
&gt;marginal improvement in combat performance for each piece of armor you<br/>
&gt;trade out. Levels and skills are what this game is really about.<br/>
