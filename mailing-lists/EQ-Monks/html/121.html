<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-435627303">I&#39;m not aware of the exact formula used. In my experience, based on an <br/>
initial strength of 80(my dex and agi are at 95, which seems to be very <br/>
common), if my weight climbs above 14 then my ac definitely takes a <br/>
significant dive. This will also be affected by any magical bonuses you get, <br/>
as well as a piece of armor that, in your current configuration, the ac <br/>
penalty is offset by the armor bonus. For example your weight drops your ac <br/>
by 10, but the new armor adds 12, so you perceive a gain of 2. If your <br/>
weight affects your atk number(I&#39;ve not looked that deeply, but it should be <br/>
easy to check) that 2 ac gain is going to hurt a lot more than help. You&#39;ll <br/>
just have to check it out. The general consensus is that netted/woven/mesh <br/>
armor are what you are going to want for a long time to come(I think in that <br/>
order), most of which can be had in Guk.<br/>
<br/>
Something else, and you&#39;ll be harassed to no end over this...<br/>
<br/>
Since you are still young, you might consider training up your one handed <br/>
blunt skill. Monks(players) will treat you like you are some sort of war <br/>
criminal, but there is NO disadvantage in training up this skill. Your <br/>
skills will advance very quickly after you level, you could even work on the <br/>
2HB skill as well, there is more than enough time to raise all of them. The <br/>
advantage is that somewhere along the line you will find some weapon that <br/>
(in fact much of the time) will allow you to hit for more damage, or some <br/>
whizzy magical effect. Seeings how your fists never get faster than <br/>
30(that&#39;s Verant&#39;s number), for much of the middling levels this can be a <br/>
significant advantage. Dress light(these weapons can be heavy), and go <br/>
anonymous, and you will be happy with your new skills. And you&#39;ll be the <br/>
coolest looking &lt;anonomyous&gt; on the newbie field(or at the very least you&#39;ll <br/>
look different from everyone else).<br/>

&gt;I have heard many people say that weight affects my ac, then I have also <br/>
&gt;heard many that say that weight affects my chance of hitting. I was just <br/>
&gt;starting to get rid of my leather armor for light patchwork or maybe just <br/>
&gt;spend all my money on netted when I saw a monk wearing leather. When I <br/>
&gt;asked him he said that weight doesn&#39;t matter at all for monks. Now, I <br/>
&gt;usually have more weight than 14 and I find myself missing more then my <br/>
&gt;other less bulbous monk counterparts. So, what&#39;s the truth does weight <br/>
&gt;matter for us?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I also was wondering, does ac and atk mean the damage we take and do, or <br/>
&gt;the chance we have to get hit or hit. Thanks for your time all.<br/>
