<div id="ygrps-yiv-2144962624">I have to agree with Praelor.  I don&#39;t know *why* twinking bothers me.  I<br/>
don&#39;t deny it is perhaps partial jealousy.  Hell yes I would like level 40+<br/>
armor to start out with!  I&#39;m level 20 and I&#39;d take it now!<br/>
<br/>
But I think what really gets me is the unfair (And it is) advantage that the<br/>
twinkers get over a non-twinked same level person.  Now perhaps that the<br/>
advantage is more of a psycological thing.. i.e. I *think* they have a<br/>
better chance than me.  But I feel that if I&#39;m standing beside a level 20<br/>
monk with high level gear and me with my low level gear, I feel like the<br/>
monk is going to be able to fight better and for longer without downtime<br/>
because of his ill gotten gear.  I haven&#39;t seen any &quot;studies&quot; to back up my<br/>
feelings, but it just makes sense to me :)<br/>
<br/>
And I don&#39;t want to open the &quot;If you want better gear go get it&quot; can of<br/>
worms.  I get the best that me and my group can get.  In a group of 10-12<br/>
people, we have to balance out quest items - it&#39;s only fair.  So that is not<br/>
an option, so to speak.<br/>
<br/>
Simple solution (And I like it no matter what anyone says)  Make gear start<br/>
to have a level requirement.  If that &quot;Glowing Baseball cap of Might&quot; comes<br/>
from a level 40 MoB, then only a level 35+ can wear it.<br/>
<br/>
I think the thing that bothers me the most about EQ is the money situation.<br/>
The greed factor has almost turned it into a UO-type situation.  I realize<br/>
this is a total tangent, but how many of you have actually had to turn OFF<br/>
the auction channel on a non-bazaar day?  I hate it.  I hate greed.  I&#39;m<br/>
level 20 and I have 15 pp to my name.  But that&#39;s just me and I could be<br/>
stupid :)<br/>
<br/>
Back to the twinking issue, I see one more factor:  My over developed sense<br/>
of injustice.  If I had to work so hard to get what I have, what gives Mr.<br/>
Twinkee the right to get everything handed to him?  Actually, now that I<br/>
think about it, it is the sense of injustice.  Jealousy is just a mitigating<br/>
factor :)</div>
