<div id="ygrps-yiv-267695607">Actually shiverback has the monk GM look- same as cured.  So the level<br/>
50 monks do have some of the same look as the level 1-20s.<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;m willing to make a very big bet that 95% of level 30-45 monks are<br/>
wearing cured in at least one place- shoulders. :)  The other 5% are<br/>
wearing mesh there.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;Cured silk makes you look like a monk?  I would have to disagree, what<br/>
&gt;makes us look like monks are the fact that we look like newbies.  I<br/>
&gt;personally much prefer foreman&#39;s tunic.  Here is a comparison<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Cured Silk Gi<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Foreman&#39;s Tunic<br/>
&gt;10ac<br/>
&gt;+3str +3dex<br/>
&gt;WEIGHTLESS<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;you have .1 less weight, 2 more ac, and +3 str.  Ok, so it looks leather<br/>
&gt;but who cares.  Once you get to 30 you won&#39;t wear anything that looks<br/>
&gt;like cured silk.  Thats because there is better stuff out there<br/>
