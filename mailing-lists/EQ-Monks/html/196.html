<div id="ygrps-yiv-494283826">Well, one person has seen the effects since the last patch.  Please speak up and give stories if your having a tough time with it.<br/>
<br/>
I am just very curious if Verant made a change in the ability to FD without stating it.  I bet they would call this an &quot;ENHANCEMENT&quot; wouldn&#39;t they.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and the durations of Buff spells really really dissapoints me.  I thought they were good as is before the patch.  Have to rebuff after ever other fight. Very annoying to the casters in my group.  <br/>
<br/>
Axlon hooks up his mana sieve to Jhessa   (Very lovely Barbarian Shaman that she is)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And one rumor I heard..is that Clerics can not cast buffs on ya unless you are grouped with them. Can anyone confirm this?<br/>
