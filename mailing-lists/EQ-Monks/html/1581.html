<div id="ygrps-yiv-2019712468"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=2&gt;Bah!  I put all my points into Agil and did all my gear based<br/>

is the theory of the week.  My monk is now level 40 and I don&#39;t see any big<br/>
differences between me and the other monks who went all str.  Sure now I&#39;m putting<br/>
some STR gear on, but leaning heavily towards AC and MR.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;<br/>

&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=2&gt;Besides, at level 20 you&#39;ve *just* gotten your STR attack bonus<br/>
 </span></blockquote>- how would you even notice?   What &quot;Massive Disadvantage&quot; could you have possibly<br/>
uncovered?  Face it, As much as Verant would like us to believe stats are worthwhile,<br/>
I think in their addiction to &quot;Balancing&quot; the classes they don&#39;t really mean<br/>
squat.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ok, only thing I notice about level 20 compared to level 19, is maybe one damage,<br/>
I do group with higher level monks (alt is 40) and they seem to go all with<br/>
str, and screw the weight restriction, IE many of them wear Treeweave. My weight<br/>
is 14, and thats only because I carry enuf plat to hold me over food/drink wise<br/>
for life.  If you have read the recent posts, you would see that no one seems<br/>
to like agility, and say strength and AC is the way to go..... Im not saying<br/>
this is true, just what I have noticed, I really wish AGI had as much of an<br/>
affect that I had hoped, with 152 as my current, but it does not, (I still dont<br/>
see why Dodge/block are not affected by agility, they really should be, and<br/>
it would save me from having to trash my monks full plat jewlery)</div>
