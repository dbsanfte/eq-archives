<div id="ygrps-yiv-1106132623">Diamondine earrings are AC 2 STR +3 HP+12.  I need to get a<br/>
pair myself. 8)<br/>
<br/>
They come from mistmoore and I&#39;ve never even seen them offered<br/>
in trades or auctions so they must be rare.<br/>

Obsidian Bead Hoops are definately a good choince as everyone is saying.<br/>
they are the common drop off Singe in Solusek A The rare drop is another<br/>
good monk item being the Drakescale belt (Dex +3  Fire +10  AC 5).  The only<br/>
other earrings I personally would recommend (that I know about anyways hehe)<br/>
are Gold Amber Earrings (Str +3), Electrum Sapphire Earrings (Str +4  Int<br/>
+2), or of course a Fishbone Earring (Dex +3  Enduring Breath).</div>
