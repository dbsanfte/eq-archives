<b>Subject:</b> Re: NUNCHUCKS! COOL!!!!!! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1305487976">Have you ever gone to a martial arts competition?  Some of those who<br/>
chose to master nunchucks....  Those things fly...  I have been close to<br/>
them and the sound they make is incredible...  I think nunchucks should hit<br/>
faster, do less damage then fists, and have a bit of a chance for a<br/>
critical.  That would balance it out..<br/>
