<div id="ygrps-yiv-23209687">Well, one of the formost reasons is the economy.<br/>
<br/>
    Everwhack&#39;s economy is slowly going down and down.  Things are costing<br/>
less.  There will be a point where steins of moggock will cost 25 PP, and<br/>
every newbie will have em.  Mesh and cured silk will be available to<br/>
everyone.  It doesn&#39;t have the get/lose/restock economy that UO has.   It&#39;s<br/>
get, keep, never lose, accumulate....  So forth.<br/>
<br/>
    Verant continues to nerf the classes, to &quot;Balance&quot; them.  They are doing<br/>
a peice of shit job of it.  If they keep going at this rate, all of the<br/>
classes will be especially weak, fighting especially strong monsters.  Sure,<br/>
this will be a challenge, but there comes to be a point where it gets<br/>
ludicrous.<br/>
<br/>
I know this sounds rather silly, but seriously look at how the game started,<br/>
and how it is now?<br/>
<br/>
   Where are the differences?  How have they changed?  How have they changed<br/>
more towards my predictions?  I saw a moggock stein for 900 pp one day.  A<br/>
month later it was 255pp</div>
