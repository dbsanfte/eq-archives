<div id="ygrps-yiv-1030514707">Have you headed down to innothule (sp?) swamp?  Even if you can&#39;t find it<br/>
yourself, I&#39;ve often come across trolls who will sell it (albeit for high<br/>
prices).  Still, considering in Qeynos someone would have been happy to pay<br/>
12pp for netted gloves, it&#39;s probably worth the trip.<br/>

<br/>
Do I have to live in the game just to get mesh or netted armour? I have been<br/>
trying to find some ever since I got to level 8 (now I&#39;m level 11) and still<br/>
have not found anything other than a mesh collar (whoop te do) What&#39;s up<br/>
with mesh? Why is there not enough of it? Must it be made or does it spawn<br/>
on certain NPC&#39;s? I&#39;m wondering why I never see any vendors carry any mesh<br/>
items. Perhaps this is something I need to take up with Verant?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
