Monks have officially been nerfed, their feign death skill can no<br/>
longer be used to split mobs. We found this out the hard way in<br/>
the king area of Lower Guk, almost got us all killed. We did some<br/>
testing, and sure enough as soon as our monk would stand up all the<br/>
frogs would leave their post and come running. (we had a couple<br/>
good-factioned lookouts watching along their path.)<br/>
<br/>
I think this was done to prevent Powerleveling.  A Monk could fight a MOB to very low health..FD..and anyone<br/>
else could come up..finish the MOB and get full exp.  I sure hope they find a different solution.  <br/>

  I am suprised it hasn&#39;t started already. I just wanted to share with you my Post nerf FD experimentaion.<br/>
<br/>
  Sol A green Flame goblins. the goblins I was experimenting with were on the floor near the passage to where the Foreman spawns.  I succesfully feigned them at this point. they returned to thier spawn points . I stood up they immediatly came back.  so I feign again they return to thier points I get up and run all the way to the small bridge type thing near the sol b spawn point. I fd again.  I was several mins stand up wait a few and here they come a running at me. I fd again let them walk away. get up and they come back.<br/>
<br/>
  A fellow monk on my server experimented in Lguk with some Dar Undead frogs and had similar results even after 5 mins of feign time.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  any other people doing experimentation out there?<br/>
