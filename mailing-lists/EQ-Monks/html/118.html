<b>Subject:</b> Weight <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-482787306">I have heard many people say that weight affects my ac, then I have also heard many that say that weight affects my chance of hitting. I was just starting to get rid of my leather armor for light patchwork or maybe just spend all my money on netted when I saw a monk wearing leather. When I asked him he said that weight doesn&#39;t matter at all for monks. Now, I usually have more weight than 14 and I find myself missing more then my other less bulbous monk counterparts. So, what&#39;s the truth does weight matter for us? <br/>
<br/>
I also was wondering, does ac and atk mean the damage we take and do, or the chance we have to get hit or hit. Thanks for your time all.<br/>
