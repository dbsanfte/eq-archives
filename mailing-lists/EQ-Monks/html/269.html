<div id="ygrps-yiv-1301110331">O.K. I need help!!!!!! Im a monk form Qeynos and Im trying to do the <br/>
freeport monk quests but it wont let me! Whenever I try it the monks say I <br/>
need to prove myself or some such message but I can find nothing to kill/do <br/>
in order to incresae my faction to do their quests. IM curently working on <br/>
the red headband questout of qey. Any Ideas????????? At this point Ill take <br/>
anything legal or not to get started. IM tired of seeing everybody doing <br/>
both quests while I can only do one!</div>
