<div id="ygrps-yiv-1298899140">Hello, brothers and sisters...<br/>
<br/>
Just spent a long, frustrating night in Paw trying to get the head of Dareb.<br/>
I&#39;ve heard you get this item from High Shaman Phido, who is a rare spawn,<br/>
who shows up in place of Shaman Ren&#39;Rexx on occasion. Well, I killed Ren&#39;Rex<br/>
so many times I started feeling sorry for him &lt;g&gt;.  Does anyone know who to<br/>
get the head of Dareb? After questing for the headband items for weeks, I<br/>
don&#39;t feel bad about a spoiler at this point &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!</div>
