<div id="ygrps-yiv-1252399289"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; 1)  I managed to buy some Cured Silk Armor for a<br/>
&gt; relativily low price.  So my choice is between Cured<br/>
&gt; Silk Gi or Foreman&#39;s tunic.  Any input?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Foreman&#39;s Tunic DEFINITELY.  It&#39;s AC 10 STR 3 WIS 3, but most importantly,<br/>
weighs nothing!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still looking for one.  I&#39;ve been wearing my Lockjaw Tunic since level<br/>
13 and I&#39;m level 23 now, and finally starting to get some money back after<br/>
spending about 500pp on jewelry.  :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 2)  Where is a good place for a level 20 to hunt.<br/>
&gt; From 14-17 I hunted oasis and from 17-20 I hunted East<br/>
&gt; Karana.  Any recomendations?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I got levels 16-23 in Highpass Hold.  You need a group there, but you&#39;ll get<br/>
levels quite quickly, I found.  I also enjoyed the excitement of a free for<br/>
all.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 3)  Anyone know a good surname for a Monk named<br/>
&gt; Hammeron<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Heads?</div>
