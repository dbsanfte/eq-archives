<div id="ygrps-yiv-1452984967">Greetings all...<br/>
<br/>
Thought I would add a bit to the FD topic. Last night while hunting in<br/>
Unrest, my party found ourselves overwhelmed by a train (in Unrest?<br/>
Unbelievable! hehe). Well... I FD&#39;d successfully, and was lying there for<br/>
perhaps 15 seconds, when in comes a dark boned skel and walks straight up to<br/>
me and clobbers me! I jump up, nearly dead, and FD again, successful again.<br/>
Everything stops attacking. Party escapes with only 1 casualty, and I have a<br/>
mere 7 hps left.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps the FD, when successful, generates a &quot;number&quot;. Any creature with a<br/>
number lower than the one generated is fooled. Any creature with a higher<br/>
number is not. This would explain the dark boned coming in the door and<br/>
whacking me. The first number generated was high enough to fool the 3 dry<br/>
bones and the 4 carrion ghouls, but not enough to fool the Dark Boned, a<br/>
higher level MoB than the others. He knew I was faking it and hit me<br/>
(causing the others to wail on me as well). The 2nd FD generated a number<br/>
that was able to fool them all.<br/>
<br/>
Now I am not a programmer or anything, but this would be similar to a dice<br/>
roll in DD or Palladium (for example) table top games for those of you<br/>
familiar with them. There is a set minimum and a set maximum number, and the<br/>
level of the feign falls randomly somewhere in that range. Maybe? Perhaps?<br/>
<br/>
What say you to this possibility?<br/>

&gt; &gt; Let me know if you all have noticed any difference. If ya haven&#39;t, I may<br/>
&gt; be having a string of bad luck. If ya have, it might mean the demise of<br/>
&gt; more monks out there.<br/>

&gt; I went to Permafrost last night and used it about 4 times.  Once when I<br/>
&gt; was solo<br/>
&gt; and got attacked by several of the goblins at the entrance, once when some<br/>
&gt; high<br/>
&gt; level characters brought a bunch of elites to the zone, once when an ice<br/>
&gt; giant<br/>
&gt; decided to say hello, and once when I was afk.  ;)  It worked every time<br/>
&gt; for me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One night in Mistmoore, before the patch, it failed on me (&quot;Faeaani has<br/>
&gt; fallen<br/>
&gt; to the ground&quot;) three times in a row while I was trying to get away from a<br/>
&gt; train<br/>
&gt; of ancilles and gypsies, but that&#39;s been the extent of my bad luck with<br/>
&gt; FD.<br/>
