&gt; I thought all merchants were beta neutral, meaning they might<br/>
&gt; not sell to<br/>
&gt; you, but they wont attack (unless you have bad beta neutral<br/>
&gt; faction). you<br/>
&gt; could always just hit sneak to sell<br/>

&gt; the butcherblock druid<br/>
&gt; &gt; ring.   i thnk that is beta neutral faction.  i know for<br/>
&gt; sure, my roommate&#39;s necro<br/>
