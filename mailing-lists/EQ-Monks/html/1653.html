<div id="ygrps-yiv-1611620252">Great reply, thanks for the info on shackle of steel, could you post a<br/>
breakdown of the quest, I am gonna be starting this failry soon, maybe I can<br/>
begin collecting whatever items are needed now.  I think the stell shackle<br/>
will be a perfect compliment ot my items, and I have a new found<br/>
appreciation for Magic resistance since I obtained my bronze shackle.  Stats<br/>
are great on the Steel one though.<br/>
<br/>
Any info you can provide to easy my quest would be appreciated.<br/>
<br/>

I was in my mid twenties when I finished the shackle of Bronze quest.<br/>

All shackles are Iksar only, I have had all of them.  I currently sport a<br/>
Shackle of Steel and Shackle of Bronze.<br/>
Shackle of Bronze: 6 ac 5 vs magic 0.2 weight.<br/>
Shackle of Steel: 9 ac 5 str 5 sta 5 vs magic 0.1 weight.<br/>
The Shackle of Bronze quest can be done in your high 20&#39;s low 30&#39;s with a<br/>
group I&#39;d say.  Mostly for safety, and the pieces in Permafrost and Frontier<br/>
Mountains, the rest is foraging and an easy quest.<br/>
The Shackle of Steel in your low to mid 40&#39;s with a group.  That Droga<br/>
section can be tough.<br/>

If someone is going to do the shackle quests, and they have not finished all<br/>
needed factions, but are going to use illlusions or wolf  form I suggest<br/>
gathering all the items upto the shackle of Copper and getting the box for<br/>
shackle of Bronze.  the actual shackle is givin out by Master Rinmark in<br/>
Timourous Deep.  and he initiates the shackle of Steel aswell.<br/>
