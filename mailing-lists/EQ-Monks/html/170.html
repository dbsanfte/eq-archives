<div id="ygrps-yiv-1518905496">Now that people are going into the Plane of Fear we are hearing about all the great things coming out.  Apparently there is a set of armor special for every class in the Plane of Fear.  Has anyone hear anything about a new armor for monks.  Most of it is plate based but the druids have armor that is chain based coming out of there.  It would be nice if we got something there too.<br/>
