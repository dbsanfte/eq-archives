&gt; Subject:	[EQ-Monks] New monk questions.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hail Fellow Monks,<br/>
&gt;    This is my first time as a monk and I have several questions.  Any help<br/>
&gt; would be great appreciated.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; 1. I know that will less weight we have a higher AC.  But where is the<br/>
&gt; balance of weigh and armor.  Am I better off with all Leather because of<br/>
&gt; its higher AC or and I better off with all cloth because of its lower<br/>
&gt; weight?<br/>
&gt;   [Praelor]  When starting off, a mixture of leather or patchwork and<br/>
&gt; cloth is best, with the maximum weight being 14. At the early levels, up<br/>
&gt; until about 8 or so, staying under this limit isn&#39;t nearly as important as<br/>
&gt; it is at higher levels. Eventually, you will want to acquire netted,<br/>
&gt; woven, and mesh, as these have magical properties and a weight of 0.1 to<br/>
&gt; 0.4 depending on the piece. These can be found in the Qeynos Sewers<br/>
&gt; (netted) and Guk, and are often for sale in East Commonlands and every<br/>
&gt; zone on the way to Guk. The closer you get to Guk, the lower you can<br/>
&gt; expect to pay.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; 2.  When I am ready to upgrade armor from either cloth or leather armor,<br/>
&gt; depending  on the answers I get for number 1, what should I get?  I know<br/>
&gt; there is netted, mesh, and woven but what is best to get first?  What are<br/>
&gt; the advantages of each?  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>	[Praelor]  Mesh is the goal for most low-mid level monks. The<br/>
Lockjaw Tunic (Oasis) has been replaced by the Forman&#39;s Tunic (Unrest) as<br/>
the goal for body protection.<br/>

&gt; 3. When I am ready where is the best place to get magic gloves?  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>	[Praelor]  Personally, I say get them as soon as you can afford<br/>
them. I bought a pair of woven gloves in East Commonlands at lvl 6 for 8<br/>
plat, and I got my mesh gloves at lvl 20 quite by accident in High Keep.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   <br/>
&gt; 4. When I hit level 17 and get feign death how many points should I put<br/>
&gt; into it?  Should I just put one and then start it and sit there till it<br/>
&gt; maxes or won&#39;t that work?  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>	[Praelor]  This is a toss up with Instill Doubt being available to<br/>
us now at 18, as ID is EXTREMELY difficult to train yourself. Personally, I<br/>
would dump them all in FD as I see that being much more useful than ID. ID<br/>
looks great, but even at a skill of 35 and practicing for 4 hours straight<br/>
last night, I did not go raise my skill even a single point and was NEVER<br/>
successful. Feign Death on the other hand, after putting 25 points into it<br/>
at lvl 17, saved me on the way back to my hunting party that very day.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 5. What am I forgetting about?  What is important for me to remember or<br/>
&gt; keep held back for later?  Should I save all my practice points for one<br/>
&gt; thing?  Etc...<br/>
 </span></blockquote>	[Praelor]  Practice points for a Monk, IMHO, are pretty useless. I<br/>
usually train 1 in everything that becomes available, from Pottery to 2<br/>
handed blunt. Most of the skills we have (except for ID) are easily trained<br/>
through combat, which we have to do anyway. The only one I would recommend<br/>
keeping up via training points is Bind Wound. This skill is perhaps the most<br/>
overlooked skill in the game, but can seriously reduce down time.<br/>
