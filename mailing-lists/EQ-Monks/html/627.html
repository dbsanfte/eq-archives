<div id="ygrps-yiv-994449217">Nope, he&#39;s 20th level and most of his abilities are in the 70&#39;s instead of<br/>
around 100. He is not going up 5 per level, he&#39;s leveling faster than his<br/>
abilities, so to speak.<br/>

&gt; This is only a problem in the lower levels.  by the time he reaches<br/>
&gt; 15 or so he will be caught up in all the categories and will max them<br/>
&gt; out at the same rate as anyone else when he makes a new level. </span></blockquote></div>
