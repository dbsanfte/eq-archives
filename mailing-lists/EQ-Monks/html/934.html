&gt;<br/>
&gt; Good day all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I know that sneak is capped at 113, does anyone know what the highest<br/>
levels we can take our other skills too?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think I remember reading that the natual cap for skills is 200, but Dual<br/>
Wield is at 250.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Can anyone confirm or deny this ?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>

&gt; &gt;I think I remember reading that the natual cap for skills is 200,<br/>
&gt; &gt;but Dual Wield is at 250.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well, although I cannot speak definitively or authoritatively, I can<br/>
&gt; say that the only skill I can recall capping at 200 was Sense<br/>
&gt; Heading.  Most of the other abilities that I can think of off-hand<br/>
&gt; seem to have progressed beyond that except at an extremely slow rate<br/>
&gt; of progress.  Speaking as a recent achiever of level 46, I can say<br/>
&gt; the following with some confidence:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; - After the last 30 hours of play, my Defense has gone up a single<br/>
&gt; point (to 211) - and I&#39;ve spent almost the entire time being the<br/>
&gt; exclusive tank to a nearly endless parade of blues.<br/>
&gt; - I don&#39;t remember the last time I saw Flying Kick go up.<br/>
&gt; - Offense seems to keep going up at its normal rate of speed (now in the<br/>
220s).<br/>
&gt; - The last number I saw out of Dual Wield was 252 - and that was some<br/>
&gt; time ago.  It&#39;s possible that it went higher (perhaps all the way to<br/>
&gt; 255) and I just didn&#39;t notice it, however.<br/>
&gt; - Mend seems to still be progressing, but again is an extremely slow<br/>
&gt; progress so I may have capped that as well - not that it matters<br/>
&gt; becuase it&#39;s been over 20 levels since it&#39;s failed.<br/>
&gt; - Progress on Feign Death continues, although I haven&#39;t been working<br/>
&gt; on it as much as I perhaps should lately so it still is languishing<br/>
&gt; in the 190&#39;s.<br/>
&gt; - Disarm is still moving into the 170s as well, but don&#39;t ask me why<br/>
&gt; I bother - a disarmed opponent doesn&#39;t seem to be a whole lot less<br/>
&gt; dangerous than an armed one.<br/>
&gt; - Instill Doubt is the singularly most useless and dangerous (to us,<br/>
&gt; that is) skill in our arsenal and I haven&#39;t bothered to skill it up a<br/>
&gt; single point since acquiring it at level 29 (which is where I was<br/>
&gt; when the patch went in which supports it), so I can&#39;t really speak on<br/>
&gt; that one.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; While my current rate of progress is annoying, it doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; really bother me.  However, I&#39;m becoming rather concerned about my<br/>
&gt; Defense and Flying Kick.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve capped them, but the<br/>
&gt; rate of progress is disturbingly slow.  I really don&#39;t want to<br/>
&gt; out-level my skills and thereby be rendered useless in a group of<br/>
&gt; like-leveled people (as so many power-levelers have found).  Does<br/>
&gt; anybody else have anything to say about this situation?<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; A side note for the disarm issue. the only time I reccomend using disarm<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; when the mob is using a very fast weapon like a dagger or a rapier etc..<br/>
&gt; what we know is that if the mobs hand damage is the higher damge weapon it<br/>
&gt; will use the damage from it hands. if it happens to be holding a fs dagger<br/>
&gt; then it will use the speed of the dagger but not the damage of the dagger.<br/>
&gt; so it would be doing its hand damage with dagger speed.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been posting this on the message board at:<br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://server3.ezboard.com/beverquestmonks">http://server3.ezboard.com/beverquestmonks</a><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And I thought I&#39;d also post it here, as this is turning<br/>
&gt; out to be a lot of fun and so far I&#39;ve had a lot of<br/>
&gt; support.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Event: Monk Madness<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Server: Vallon Zek<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Time: Starting this Friday at 9PM eastern US time. That<br/>
&gt; is GMT -5:00 for international monks. :)This will be an<br/>
&gt; ongoing event until Sunday Night. Play as little or as<br/>
&gt; much of that as you want to.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Story: An evil gnome wizard experimenting with cloning<br/>
&gt; captured a lone human monk in Freeport, and tried to<br/>
&gt; clone him. He inadvertently triggered a chain reaction<br/>
&gt; and suddenly there spawns many many many monks. All<br/>
&gt; identical. Being of one mind they are also all of one<br/>
&gt; guild, &quot;The Armadillos of Norrath&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Naming: This is an event in which monks from all<br/>
&gt; servers who may know each other from messageboards will<br/>
&gt; participate. Therefore I think it is a great idea that<br/>
&gt; we use the naming convention &#39;&quot;your real monk<br/>
&gt; name&quot;dillo&#39;. Or a variation thereof. Such that I am<br/>
&gt; going to be Ipnodillo on vallon zek for the weekend. ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Goal: Have fun. Group up with as many monks as you can<br/>
&gt; and run around the zone punching everything in site. Go<br/>
&gt; on suicide missions. We&#39;ll be like ants.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; To participate, create a new monk on Vallon Zek Friday<br/>
&gt; Night. The monk should be the male version with the<br/>
&gt; Priest of Discord face. We&#39;re gonna try to create a<br/>
&gt; guild for this as well, so look for a guild officer to<br/>
&gt; invite you. Please try to keep your guild tunic on at<br/>
&gt; all times so we have the monk &quot;look&quot; about us. Invite<br/>
&gt; all your friends to attend. This is an event to have<br/>
&gt; fun, not so heavy on the roleplaying, but lets just<br/>
&gt; have a LOT of fun.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; To clarify, your monk should look like this:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shada.com/pod.jpg">http://www.shada.com/pod.jpg</a><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The guild has been submitted. Lets all hope verant<br/>
&gt; approves it!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Invite your non monk friends who have always admired<br/>
&gt; your monkness as well! Lets try and make this event a<br/>
&gt; legend of it&#39;s own kind! :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just think. Hundreds of Identical Newbie Monks...<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; You can practice instill doubt on anything, other ppl, mobs nowhere near<br/>
you,<br/>
&gt; conning whatever color.  It takes forever for it to go up.  Mine is at 105<br/>
&gt; right now and works maybe 1 in 10 times.  It is no good in dungeons, the<br/>
mob<br/>
&gt; will run and get friends to bring back.  Only good thing I have seen for<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; is if a mob is ensnared and you are fighting in the open where there are<br/>
&gt; hardly any mobs around it and it will run so you can smack it in the back.<br/>
