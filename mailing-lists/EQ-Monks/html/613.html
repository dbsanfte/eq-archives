<div id="ygrps-yiv-1936722524">Well then if you choose to play outside of the constraints then you have no<br/>
one to complain to about, because you choose to play this way don&#39;t expect<br/>
everyone to do the same, I do not like to sit for an item but sometimes it<br/>
can not be helped, did I like to wait 6 hours for that stupid High Priest<br/>
Grisok so I could get my red headband no, but sometimes you have to do that.<br/>

&#39;I hate to break this to you, this game is a camp game, if you want<br/>
something<br/>
then sometimes you have to sit there, sorry until Verant fixes this there is<br/>
just no other way around it..&quot;<br/>
<br/>
No, I&#39;m trying to tell you differenlty. If your game is to run around and<br/>
acquire items, it is a camp game. I don&#39;t want to play a camp game, so I<br/>
have<br/>
taken a different route to allow me enjoy the game as I see fit.<br/>
<br/>
As for &quot;Verant&quot; fixing items, that statement is so far out of line, I don&#39;t<br/>
know<br/>
where to start. You say the word &quot;fix&quot;, which implies something is broken<br/>
(not<br/>
working as designed). Well, that simply is not the case, things are working<br/>
as<br/>
designed. I just choose not to be constrained by those choices.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I did read your whole post, and I did not choose your words out of<br/>
context,<br/>
your post is anti-twinking, I choose phrases to illustrate that.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I have to agree with Praelor.  I don&#39;t know *why* twinking bothers me.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; don&#39;t deny it is perhaps partial jealousy.  Hell yes I would like level<br/>
&gt; 40+<br/>
&gt; &gt; armor to start out with!  I&#39;m level 20 and I&#39;d take it now!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; But I think what really gets me is the unfair (And it is) advantage that<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; twinkers get over a non-twinked same level person.  Now perhaps that the<br/>
&gt; &gt; advantage is more of a psycological thing.. i.e. I *think* they have a<br/>
&gt; &gt; better chance than me.  But I feel that if I&#39;m standing beside a level<br/>
 </span></blockquote>20<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; monk with high level gear and me with my low level gear, I feel like the<br/>
&gt; &gt; monk is going to be able to fight better and for longer without downtime<br/>
&gt; &gt; because of his ill gotten gear.  I haven&#39;t seen any &quot;studies&quot; to back up<br/>
&gt; my<br/>
&gt; &gt; feelings, but it just makes sense to me :)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; And I don&#39;t want to open the &quot;If you want better gear go get it&quot; can of<br/>
&gt; &gt; worms.  I get the best that me and my group can get.  In a group of<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; people, we have to balance out quest items - it&#39;s only fair.  So that is<br/>
&gt; not<br/>
&gt; &gt; an option, so to speak.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Simple solution (And I like it no matter what anyone says)  Make gear<br/>
&gt; start<br/>
&gt; &gt; to have a level requirement.  If that &quot;Glowing Baseball cap of Might&quot;<br/>
&gt; comes<br/>
&gt; &gt; from a level 40 MoB, then only a level 35+ can wear it.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I think the thing that bothers me the most about EQ is the money<br/>
&gt; situation.<br/>
&gt; &gt; The greed factor has almost turned it into a UO-type situation.  I<br/>
 </span></blockquote>realize<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; this is a total tangent, but how many of you have actually had to turn<br/>
 </span></blockquote>OFF<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; the auction channel on a non-bazaar day?  I hate it.  I hate greed.  I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; &gt; level 20 and I have 15 pp to my name.  But that&#39;s just me and I could be<br/>
&gt; &gt; stupid :)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Back to the twinking issue, I see one more factor:  My over developed<br/>
&gt; sense<br/>
&gt; &gt; of injustice.  If I had to work so hard to get what I have, what gives<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Mr.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; Twinkee the right to get everything handed to him?  Actually, now that I<br/>
&gt; &gt; think about it, it is the sense of injustice.  Jealousy is just a<br/>
&gt; mitigating<br/>
&gt; &gt; factor :)<br/>
