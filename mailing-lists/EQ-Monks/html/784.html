<div id="ygrps-yiv-155616498">Ok, how about:<br/>

2. Wizard<br/>
3. Wizard<br/>
4. Wizard<br/>
5. Wizard<br/>
6. Wizard<br/>

I&#39;m 30th, and there is not much that lives through 6 of the big<br/>
wizard spells.  This group with die horribly to the wrong target,  <br/>
but around 35th level this group would walk through giants (i think).<br/>
<br/>
If this group can coordinate, nothing moves, its standing at full, then its<br/>
dead.<br/>

&gt; &gt;         The Bard is the one pulling. He will be taking the brunt of the<br/>
&gt; &gt;damage while the Enchanter does Crowd Control. They will stay on the Bard<br/>
&gt; &gt;because he is the one that pulled them and because those Songs piss Mobs<br/>
&gt; &gt;off. If the Wizards use /assist they will be taking out what the Bard has<br/>
&gt; &gt;targeted. Enchanter will use Mesmerization for AoE Crowd Control and there<br/>
&gt; &gt;should only be 1 fighting at a time. You are quite mistaken about this<br/>
&gt; &gt;group. This is the MOST powerful group that you can have. There is no other<br/>
&gt; &gt;group that will do more damage in a shorter amount of time. It is not right<br/>
&gt; &gt;for every situation, but it is the best for most situations.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This still seems iffy to me, especially if you pull more than two mobs, and<br/>
&gt; they get lucky around of resisting....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I wouldn&#39;t feel comfortable without a dedicated melee class to start bash&#39;n<br/>
&gt; and distract&#39;n.<br/>
