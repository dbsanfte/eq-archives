<div id="ygrps-yiv-1822056100">East Karana is a good place to go with a group of your level. The gorge<br/>
hounds and reavers should be good exp for you. I cant rmember if I was<br/>
fighting undead reavers at your level or not. with a good small group you<br/>
should be just fine.<br/>

&gt; On a starting point I am a level 17 monk of Quellious<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; On the Blind issue: Everyone complains about this...<br/>
&gt; yet I don&#39;t seem to see the problem.  Perhaps it is<br/>
&gt; because I learn zones quickly and generally always<br/>
&gt; know where I am.  Buy a greater lightstone, memorize<br/>
&gt; the zone you are in, max out sense heading and always<br/>
&gt; know which way to run.  Thats the best advice I can<br/>
&gt; give.  I have a druid with infravision and it doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; seem to be much of an improvement (still can&#39;t see<br/>
&gt; anything in Misty Thicket)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just live with it<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Second... I am level 17, i&#39;ve been hunt in oasis for 3<br/>
&gt; levels and I want to go somewhere else.  I was<br/>
&gt; thinking of East Karana.  Any recommendations as to<br/>
&gt; where I should hunt and what I should fight<br/>
