&lt;&lt; I think the key to pulling in that particular situation is to just pull and<br/>
 sort out one individual mob and clear them all out rather than to try to<br/>
 just pull that knight out by himself.  &gt;&gt;<br/>

 Yes, lots of times you have to knock them all down, 1 by 1, and can&#39;t choose <br/>
the order in which they choose to linger over your feigned body. Eventually <br/>
you will get the mob you&#39;re after, though. when i pull the Ghoul Lord or the <br/>
Live King in lower guk, very rarely is the target mob the last one to return <br/>
to his spot. In those situations, you just grab the last one to linger, and <br/>
eventually you&#39;ll get the one you want.</div>
