successfully performed Feign may remove you from any monsters target lists,<br/>
meaning both &#39;current target&#39; and &#39;targetable if I ever get around to it&#39;.<br/>
However, if anything happens to put you back on that list (say, a completed<br/>
blow or spell), then you have to re-feign to try and get yourself out of<br/>
the loop again.  I don&#39;t think that each and every monster performs an<br/>
individual check, that would be way too resource intensive in terms of cpu<br/>
time and would have to be re-executed for each new monster that spawns or<br/>
otherwise nears you.  Besides, when six or seven critters are on you and<br/>
you manage to Feign correctly, they all turn as one and leave.  It&#39;s not<br/>
like four leave, but the other three are still thumping happily away.<br/>
