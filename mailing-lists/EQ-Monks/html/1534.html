(at worst) to everyone.<br/>
<br/>
So if you just waltz by them, it&#39;s OK.  And they certainly won&#39;t sell<br/>
to you if that&#39;s the case.<br/>

I found that my troll who used to be KOS to some merchants still can&#39;t<br/>
sell to/from them, but they don&#39;t attack, and I don&#39;t THINK I did<br/>
anything to fix faction with them.<br/>

Or am i insane again?</div>
