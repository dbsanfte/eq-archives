<div id="ygrps-yiv-854882595">I write to let you know of a rather upsetting issue that I am faced with at<br/>
the moment. It appears to only be affecting me, but it is severe enough to<br/>
bring to your attention as well, I think.<br/>
<br/>
Last night, while zoning from South Keladim into North Keladim (where the<br/>
bank is) I crashed. A drag, but nothing all that new. The twist is, however,<br/>
I cannot log my monk, Praelor, back onto the server! I tried re-starting EQ,<br/>
re-connecting my ISP, and re-booting my system, all to no avail. I brought<br/>
in a lvl 2 druid and /petitioned, and spent the next 3 hours speaking with a<br/>
guide and a gm. The GM said he would reset my character to a point prior to<br/>
the disappearance, but could make no promises on when that would occur. So I<br/>
logged and tried again this morning.<br/>
<br/>
And there he was, right where I had started Last night. Everything appeared<br/>
to be fine. I still needed to go to the bank, however, so off to Keladim I<br/>
went, and upon zoning from S. Keladim into N. Keladim again, I crashed. With<br/>
the same results as last night. Well, it was 6:30 am EST, and no GM&#39;S were<br/>
online, but I did speak with a guide who promised to forward my problem to<br/>
then first GM who showed up, but it would not be for several hours.<br/>
Understandable, given that it was 3:30 am in San Diego.<br/>
<br/>
So now, with time to kill before work, I decided to experiment. I created a<br/>
Dwarven Cleric and ran him into the zone and promptly crashed. So at least<br/>
it is not a corrupt character file with Praelor. I then created a Dwarven<br/>
Cleric on The Tribunal server and zoned with no problem. Now I know it is<br/>
not a corrupt N. Keladim data file and that it is specific to Fenin Ro. A<br/>
few of my guildmates then create characters on Fenin Ro and zone with no<br/>
problem, so it is not a server-wide issue.<br/>
<br/>
All this leads me to believe that it is something specific with the link<br/>
between my system and the Fenin Ro servers, but I just wanted to give<br/>
everyone a heads up on this &quot;just in case&quot;. I am planning on re-installing<br/>
EQ and running all the patches tonight, and will let you know the outcome.<br/>
With any luck, that will solve everything and Praelor Dileasai will once<br/>
again be running from all those nasty critters in Mistmoore (hehe). If<br/>
not... well.. I just don&#39;t really want to think about the &quot;if not&quot; scenario<br/>
yet.<br/>
