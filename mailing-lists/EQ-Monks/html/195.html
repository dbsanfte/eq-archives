<div id="ygrps-yiv-1593053591">You&#39;re not alone.  Sence the patch I&#39;ve died about 4 times cause of FD <br/>
failure.  I am level 30 and have now had more FD &quot;Synjyn has fallen to the <br/>
ground&quot; messges than I did between levels 20 to 30 combined.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what they did with the patch, but I do not like it at all.  I&#39;m <br/>
the puller for any group I&#39;m with and it has really screwed up our hunting <br/>
with so many failures now.  Its cost me my life too many times now and has <br/>
also cost my friends theirs too some because they rush in try&#39;n to help me <br/>
when they see &quot;Synjyn has fallen to the ground&quot; and my life bar speed&#39;n to <br/>
zero.<br/>
