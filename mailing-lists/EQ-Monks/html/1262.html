<div id="ygrps-yiv-763950303"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Interesting.  I assume people who are not consumed with haggling down<br/>
&gt;to the last cp, screwing you over, or obsessing over trade values are<br/>
&gt;the stupid people?  Ever thought that people may have been stupid<br/>
&gt;because they liked you, were in a hurry, or much preferred the item<br/>
&gt;you had to trade?<br/>
<br/>
&gt;No big deal, just the expression annoyed me.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Annoyed me to when I went back and read it.  I think I mis-phrased what<br/>
I was trying to say.  Some people were being very generous in the prices<br/>
they wanted for some items.  You are most certainly right though, I was<br/>
out of line in my comments.<br/>
