&gt;I think I remember reading that the natual cap for skills is 200, <br/>
&gt;but Dual Wield is at 250.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, although I cannot speak definitively or authoritatively, I can <br/>
say that the only skill I can recall capping at 200 was Sense <br/>
Heading.  Most of the other abilities that I can think of off-hand <br/>
seem to have progressed beyond that except at an extremely slow rate <br/>
of progress.  Speaking as a recent achiever of level 46, I can say <br/>
the following with some confidence:<br/>
<br/>
- After the last 30 hours of play, my Defense has gone up a single <br/>
point (to 211) - and I&#39;ve spent almost the entire time being the <br/>
exclusive tank to a nearly endless parade of blues.<br/>
- I don&#39;t remember the last time I saw Flying Kick go up.<br/>
- Offense seems to keep going up at its normal rate of speed (now in the 220s).<br/>
- The last number I saw out of Dual Wield was 252 - and that was some <br/>
time ago.  It&#39;s possible that it went higher (perhaps all the way to <br/>
255) and I just didn&#39;t notice it, however.<br/>
- Mend seems to still be progressing, but again is an extremely slow <br/>
progress so I may have capped that as well - not that it matters <br/>
becuase it&#39;s been over 20 levels since it&#39;s failed.<br/>
- Progress on Feign Death continues, although I haven&#39;t been working <br/>
on it as much as I perhaps should lately so it still is languishing <br/>
in the 190&#39;s.<br/>
- Disarm is still moving into the 170s as well, but don&#39;t ask me why <br/>
I bother - a disarmed opponent doesn&#39;t seem to be a whole lot less <br/>
dangerous than an armed one.<br/>
- Instill Doubt is the singularly most useless and dangerous (to us, <br/>
that is) skill in our arsenal and I haven&#39;t bothered to skill it up a <br/>
single point since acquiring it at level 29 (which is where I was <br/>
when the patch went in which supports it), so I can&#39;t really speak on <br/>
that one.<br/>
<br/>
	While my current rate of progress is annoying, it doesn&#39;t <br/>
really bother me.  However, I&#39;m becoming rather concerned about my <br/>
Defense and Flying Kick.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve capped them, but the <br/>
rate of progress is disturbingly slow.  I really don&#39;t want to <br/>
out-level my skills and thereby be rendered useless in a group of <br/>
like-leveled people (as so many power-levelers have found).  Does <br/>
anybody else have anything to say about this situation?<br/>
