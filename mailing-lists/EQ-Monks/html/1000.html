Fairness? hmmm I heard of that concept somewhere before. Not that you will<br/>
ever see somthing like that in a MMORGP. Tell, shout, groupsay and guildsay<br/>
are forms of communication that are integral part of a game such as this.<br/>
This is a social game and if you couldn&#39;t communicate with friends and<br/>
guildmates etc by these meanspeople just wouldn&#39;t play. If you take out the<br/>
social interaction you dont have a customer base if they dont have a<br/>
customer base you dont have a game.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Fairness and Reality are not somthing that belong in a fantasy setting IMO<br/>

&gt; Someone mentioned on one of the recent posts about FD that it was unfair<br/>
&gt; that the NPCs had some sort of telepathy to know when one of its members<br/>
&gt; saw you stand again and let everyone else in the mob know.  In the<br/>
interest<br/>
&gt; of fairness, doesn&#39;t every PC in the game already have telepathy?  WIth<br/>
&gt; group say, auction, OOC, Tell, and Sohut, Pcs are able to talk to<br/>
eachother<br/>
&gt; over a large area.  I know that I have been in the hills of Queynos and<br/>
&gt; have been talking to a friend of mine in Freeport.  Why should it be any<br/>
&gt; different from the NPcs.  So waht if they are computer generated AI NPCs.<br/>
