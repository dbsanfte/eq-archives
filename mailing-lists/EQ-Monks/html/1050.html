<br/>
Well last night was pretty good.   Over the course of the day, we hunted <br/>
kobolds till the king room opened up for us to hunt.   We finally got in it, <br/>
broke the spawn, and had a merry old time (and I got a Large Soiled Bag!  <br/>
woo woo!).<br/>
<br/>
However, at the end of the night, me and the mage (Raraielie) went linkdead <br/>
at the same time.    We came back on to find the party gone and one member&#39;s <br/>
corpse (Jagriel) on the ground.   We zone out with kobolds in tow, no <br/>
problem.<br/>
<br/>
While going on corpse retrieval, we get into the hall leading to the king <br/>
room, are fighting two kobolds when *bam* the mage and I go linkdead again!  <br/>
  This time me and her log back on to our bind points.   = (<br/>
<br/>
She zones in, finds her corpse and re-joins the party.   However, no one in <br/>
the zone sees my corpse anywhere.   No corpse, no res.  So I hoof it back <br/>
from Freeport and did I mention Nektulos and East Commons are REALLY dark at <br/>
night?   Anyway I eventually make it back to the team, and I zone into <br/>
Solusek B (It&#39;s about 2:15am).<br/>
<br/>
I start running around jamming my /corpse hotkey.  Corpse IS in zone (yay!) <br/>
but never in range of my summon (boo!).   I explore as far as I can without <br/>
bringing kobolds down on the house, but no dice.    I sit down, file a <br/>
petition, and prepare to wait a few minutes.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;SYSTEMWIDE MESSAGE:  THE SERVERS ARE COMING DOWN NOW!  LOGOUT NOW!&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Uh oh.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I log into the chat room, and there are a couple guides and GM&#39;s <br/>
there who, while trying to be helpful, have no idea what the nature of the <br/>
problem is (per usual, can&#39;t the techs give the GM&#39;s SOME idea of what&#39;s <br/>
going on?  = P).   After about a half hour of the inane banter in the chat <br/>
room, I call it a night and go to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
Overall?  Before death I got 2 and half bubbles (so I netted 2 and a <br/>
quarter) of 45 xp, the nice bag, and some undisclosed amount of platinum.   <br/>
The extremely low turnover rate for our group was nice (4 of the 6 people in <br/>
the group were there from start to end - about 2pm to 2am).<br/>
<br/>
We got kinda loopy at points, I was trying to decipher the cave paintings in <br/>
the rooms,  and I explored an underlava tunnel from the King room lava pool. <br/>
  At 83 fire resist, I was taking 23 or 27 points per hit from the lava.  <br/>
The tunnel goes a way, comes up to a small &quot;way station&quot; type room (Small <br/>
room, no exits except through the lava tunnels), and then continues on (I <br/>
opted not to explore beyond that = P).<br/>
<br/>
I think that things were just going too well for us and the game just had to <br/>
throw a wrench in it.   = )<br/>
<br/>
So, hopefully tonight I can log on, get my corpse, get a GM ress *crosses <br/>
fingers*, and continue on my merry way.   Not much time for EQ tonight, but <br/>
I&#39;ll be on an hour or two.<br/>
<br/>
Fare well<br/>
<br/>

&gt;Hiya, Kaladiel!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;There seems to be a misconception about mistmoore werewolves.  To my<br/>
&gt;understanding, they do NOT drop the claw for the Karg quest.  They drop the<br/>
&gt;Talon for the crafted breastplate quest.   I believe you can only get a <br/>
&gt;claw<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;from werewolves in outdoor areas.   Someone please, please correct me if I<br/>
&gt;am wrong, but I believe this to be true.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Fare well<br/>

&gt; &gt;Hi all, I have decided that it is time for me to complete something I <br/>
&gt;have<br/>
&gt; &gt;set out to do for quite some time. And that is to get a freaking Werewolf<br/>
&gt; &gt;claw. Now being one that does not like to run around in the stupid West<br/>
&gt; &gt;Commonlands, or West Karana asking repetitively anyone have a werewolf on<br/>
&gt; &gt;tracking let me know! I got so bored and tired so I have decided to go to<br/>
&gt; &gt;Mistmoore and try to get to the dance floor. Now I have been to MM quite <br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt; &gt;few times but I have never been inside the castle barely even down the <br/>
&gt;ramp<br/>
&gt; &gt;towards the castle. mainly the Grave Yard and the zone line. Now I would<br/>
&gt; &gt;like some help on any suggestions or tips as to what to go or how to go<br/>
&gt; &gt;about getting to the Dance Room with the Gypsies/Werewolves....i.e. party<br/>
&gt; &gt;make up and level or a site where there might be a map. Thanks for your<br/>
&gt; &gt;help.<br/>
