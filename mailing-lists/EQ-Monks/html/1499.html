<div id="ygrps-yiv-613687411">well being evil is a pain in the ass unless you are willing to work on factions.<br/>
i was just pointing out that being able to kill goodie goodie guards is not one<br/>
of the advantages to being evil, since the goodie goodie races kill goodie goodie<br/>
guards as well.  and actually maybe have an easier time of it than evil<br/>
races, since they could kill guards til faction drops to apprehensive and then<br/>
do quests to knock it back up again, whereas the evil folks have a hell of<br/>
a time doing side quests just so they can get non-kos so they can do the real<br/>
faction quests.<br/>

&gt;My point was that being evil is NOT the bad thing that a lot make it<br/>
&gt;out to be.  It&#39;s actually quite a good thing in many ways.<br/>
