<div id="ygrps-yiv-96280979">I found that I can save myself from dying of poison using bandages.  It<br/>
heals 1 hitpoint for every 4 points of skill.  So at level 9 you&#39;ll max<br/>
at skill 50, and get 12 points per bandage, easily counteracting the<br/>
poison until it wears off.  Raising your skill to that level can be<br/>
expensive however.  It has saved me several times though, and later when<br/>
your level goes up and money is less and less of a problem, you can use<br/>
it very effectively to heal quickly and decrease the time inbetween<br/>
fights.  Alot of times I can fight several battles, then use bandage to<br/>
get back up to 50%, then hit mend to get up to about 80%, then right to<br/>
the next monster.  If you&#39;re fighting monsters that take off a bubble of<br/>
health each, by the time you&#39;re down to 20 or 30%, your mend will be<br/>
available again.  Of course if you&#39;re with any sort of healer, the whole<br/>
bandage thing is pretty much a waste.<br/>

&gt; I am a 9th monk fighting Giant Spiders in the east commons.  They give<br/>
&gt; me good experience, but I find myself having to run at around 2<br/>
&gt; bubbles of health left because otherwise I will die from the poison. <br/>
&gt; Can anyone give me a list of equipment (not too expensive) that has<br/>
&gt; nice resistances to poison? Thanks alot. -Ashanak on Tunare<br/>
