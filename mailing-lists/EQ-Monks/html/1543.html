completely though.<br/>
<br/>
If what he says below is true, then I shouldn&#39;t have even been able to<br/>
raise it from 100 to 120 until I got to lvl 20, which clearly isn&#39;t<br/>
the case.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll have to get to lvl 5 to confirm this, but if I get to 5, and my<br/>
skill can go to 125, then it looks like it&#39;s lvl capped to 100 + (lvl<br/>
* 5), which was my initial question.  I thought swimming WASN&#39;T lvl<br/>
capped, but it looks (at first glance) that it is.<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; No, nothing is wrong. The cap for human monk swimming is as you<br/>
&gt; &gt; have stated. Lizards are better swimmers innately and begin with<br/>
&gt; &gt; swimming mastery. The first poster is using some software package<br/>
&gt; &gt; (ShowEQ or something similar) to display a numeric value for his<br/>
&gt; &gt; skill. In answer to the first poster&#39;s question, you will not be<br/>
&gt; &gt; able to improve your skill beyond 120 until you reach a level that<br/>
&gt; &gt; allows you to progress beyond that skill (level 24 in this case).<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Then why did it allow me to get to 120 at lvl 4?  I mean, why go from<br/>
&gt; 100 to 120, stop for 20 lvls, then start up again?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That makes no sense at all.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; (I&#39;m not using ShowEQ, BTW; I looked at my log file to see where it<br/>
&gt; started and ended.)<br/>
