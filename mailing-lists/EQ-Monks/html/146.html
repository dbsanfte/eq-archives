<div id="ygrps-yiv-1829318590">The monsters behave differently in different zones.  In Oasis for<br/>
instance, once a giant targets me, he will come back to me from what<br/>
seems like any distance the moment I stand up from feign.  What im not<br/>
sure about is if they do the same thing after they have started<br/>
attacking someone else while i&#39;m on the ground.  In a zone like Guk, a<br/>
feign seems to instantly and permanently remove me from the monsters&#39;<br/>
minds, with the possible exception being when they are still battling<br/>
members of my group.  <br/>
<br/>
As an interesting side-note to using feign in Guk in particular, and I&#39;m<br/>
guessing other indoor zones, I can use feign to run through the zone for<br/>
the most part with impunity.  The best guess i can make is that the<br/>
monsters do a radius check around themselves every 10 seconds or so to<br/>
look for trespassers.  As I&#39;m running through the level (usually headed<br/>
for a corpse or zone), I move past most monsters between their radius<br/>
checks and they do not attack.  On the occasions that they do attack<br/>
(maybe 1 in 5 frogs) I immediately feign death, stand up, and keep<br/>
running.  By the time they do another radius check, I&#39;m long gone.  The<br/>
one thing that makes it complicated at times is the issue of<br/>
spellcasters that has been discussed here.  If I notice a frog has begun<br/>
casting a spell, instead of immediately feigning to lose any other<br/>
pursuing frogs, I keep running.  After the spell hits me, i feign,<br/>
stand, and run again.  The frogs all return to their guard posts or<br/>
patrol routes while I run past the next groups.<br/>
<br/>
Well, hope the technique can be used by others if needed.<br/>

&gt; unfortunately, yes, this is supposed to happen. Supposedly there is a<br/>
&gt; radius<br/>
&gt; of aggression which, once the critter has passed it, it will not<br/>
&gt; return, but<br/>
&gt; I have never had a monster forget about me. The funniest was running<br/>
&gt; from a<br/>
&gt; brigand in the Karanas (West I think it was). I FD (was on a corpse<br/>
&gt; retreival run and in no mood to fight this thing), wait, run, FD,<br/>
&gt; wait,<br/>
&gt; run... repeat all the way to North Karanas Zone. I was laughing so<br/>
&gt; hard I<br/>
&gt; cant believe the dumb brigand didn&#39;t know I was alive!  =D<br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; : tells a quick story of woe<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Once uopn a time there was a Monk who was going to Freepoet after<br/>
&gt; getting<br/>
&gt; &gt; her red headband in Qeynos she was all the way to the west Commans<br/>
&gt; when<br/>
&gt; &gt; she<br/>
&gt; &gt; happened upon a hill Giant who decided to step on her.  She feigned<br/>
&gt; death<br/>
&gt; &gt; the Giant thinking he had killed our heroine walk off and started<br/>
&gt; crushing<br/>
&gt; &gt; people in derv camp which was was pretty far  away she could barely<br/>
&gt; see it<br/>
&gt; &gt; in the distance.  Rather hurt the Monk stood and mended her wounds.<br/>
&gt; The<br/>
&gt; &gt; Giant who was no were near her can RUNNING BACK and procceded to<br/>
&gt; kill her.<br/>
&gt; &gt; She rewake in Qeynos were she was bound and started the long run<br/>
&gt; back to<br/>
&gt; &gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; commans and her body woundering why the Hill Giant came running back<br/>
&gt; just<br/>
&gt; &gt; for her.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; The end.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; : Adds a quick almost tale of Woe<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Later while she was in East Karana she was jumped by a goruge hound<br/>
&gt; she<br/>
&gt; &gt; ran<br/>
&gt; &gt; to the gaurds already hurt and bleeding from a fight with a Gnoll,<br/>
&gt; seeing<br/>
&gt; &gt; the gurads of the fishing village (though they were trying there<br/>
&gt; best to<br/>
&gt; &gt; kill it) would not be able to before it killed her in time she<br/>
&gt; feigned<br/>
&gt; &gt; death.  The hound looked at her for a moment and walked off she<br/>
&gt; opened an<br/>
&gt; &gt; eye and looked around for a few minutes to make sure it was NO WERE<br/>
&gt; in<br/>
&gt; &gt; sight<br/>
&gt; &gt; before standing up she even had time to sit down to try to heal when<br/>
&gt; all<br/>
&gt; &gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; a sudden IT CAME RUNNING BACK!  Luckally the gurads were able to<br/>
&gt; slay the<br/>
&gt; &gt; thing in time (lived by 23 hps).<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; The end (for real this time)<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; So heres the question: ummmm is this whats soposed to happen?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Palerose 19th circle Monk of the Ashen order who thinks its about<br/>
&gt; time she<br/>
&gt; &gt; looked in to buying more mesh armor.<br/>
