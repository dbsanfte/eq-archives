<div id="ygrps-yiv-697530958"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; <br/>
&gt; From: &quot;Goode, Jason&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:JGoode@...">JGoode@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just for clarification, I&#39;ll assume when you say &quot;you&quot;, you mean the vauge,<br/>
&gt; general, collective &quot;you&quot;, not me in particular, as you&#39;ve not once seen me<br/>
&gt; complain, but rather, just this once, try to speculate as to exactly why so<br/>
&gt; many are so upset.  Now, on to your points:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, excactly, not you in particular at all, you as in general, anyone.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What you say about the social evolution of games is true, but I&#39;ll wager<br/>
&gt; most of the  EQ players about today didn&#39;t grow up with bridge night with<br/>
&gt; the Jones&#39; from next door.  For them, this is largely a new phenomena.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No bridge, but they should have played some tag, hide and seek, kickball,<br/>
hopscotch, monopoly...social contact in games is, I hope, not new at all.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Nor, do I recall that anyone has once stated that their existing friends<br/>
&gt; deny them groups and interactions.  So, discard that paragraph.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sorry, I assumed by the statements I have previously read, like<br/>
&quot;can&#39;t find any group at all&quot;, and &quot;no one wants monks now&quot; that they<br/>
weren&#39;t exaggerating.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Look, if you want to help, stop further insulting them and making them feel<br/>
&gt; worse.  Instead, do this:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1) Come up with examples and arguments demonstrating that they can still do<br/>
&gt; everything they used to, or alternately propose new ways in which they can<br/>
&gt; explore and express.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Monks can&#39;t.  Verant believes the ability of classes to pull so safely<br/>
at high levels was simply too powerful, and thus they took it out of the<br/>
game.  Half the power of FD is gone; its time to learn to live with the<br/>
change.  There is no work around, monks need to suck it up and go on.<br/>
<br/>
Formal, well thought out complaints are fine, but I find statements like<br/>
&quot;Its more than a game, gimmie FD back&quot; just plain silly.  How many<br/>
weeks of venting do I have to endure?<br/>
<br/>
I play a wizard...I have watched them take away our easy root/nuke/nuke<br/>
strategy.  I watched them take away our escape tool, jboots.  I watched<br/>
them take away our toy, manastone.  Each time I suck it up.  I still<br/>
have friends, I still meet new people.  My power is greatly reduced<br/>
still.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But The game is just a game.  Monks have been tuned (nerfed), life<br/>
and game go on.</div>
