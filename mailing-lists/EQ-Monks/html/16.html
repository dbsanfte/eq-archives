<div id="ygrps-yiv-481658273">Monk Kicks and strikes are are always magic regardless of if you are wearing magic gloves or not.  That is useful to keep in mind if you suddenly find your group in combat with something requiring magic as you can always contribute a little whether you have magic gloves or not.
