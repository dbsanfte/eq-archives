<div id="ygrps-yiv-1590486757">In response to you final paragraph...<br/>
<br/>
Verant made life very very difficult for themselves when they raised the<br/>
level cap to 60. Keep in mind that all of EQ was designed for levels 1-50<br/>
prior to Kunark. Upping the level cap involved far more than simply giving<br/>
the classes a balanced skill/ability set post 50. MoB experience tables,<br/>
resistances, abilities, levels, etc throughout Norrath needed to be (and<br/>
still need to be) adjusted in order to accommodate the 50+ crowd. The<br/>
imminent changes to the planes, and the change to Naggy and Vox are examples<br/>
of this. I would expect changes to be made in Sol B and LGuk eventually as<br/>
well. And they still have a long way to go. With specifically class balance<br/>
in mind, I think the only thing that really makes no sense to me is not<br/>
raising the monks hand to hand skill cap to be equal to their 1hb and 2hb<br/>
weapon caps. What they have done is virtually eliminate Hand to Hand<br/>
fighting in the game. I know a lvl 52 Iksar Monk who has NEVER trained Hand<br/>
to Hand unless he was on a cr. He says his skill is about 40 or so. That<br/>
speaks VOLUMES about the redirection our class has taken since the<br/>
expansion.<br/>
<br/>
The initial design of the class, according to Verant, prevents them from<br/>
doing many things (like gloves with procs). What they were able to do, was<br/>
make wielding a weapon an attractive alternative. IMHO, it is a cheap and<br/>
easy way (not to mention a cop out) to make sure we are still on par with<br/>
damage dealing when compared to Warriors. From where I sit, rather than<br/>
spend the time and resources to upgrade and balance the Monk class<br/>
correctly, they took the shortest route and abandoned their initial vision<br/>
for the class. Personally, I have been playing a monk since day 1 of<br/>
release. I had somewhere between 0 and 50 skill in 1 hb and 2 hb at level 47<br/>
when Kunark was released (perhaps slightly higher in 1hb, I forget). To<br/>
suddenly shift the focus of the class away from hand to hand was a HUGE<br/>
mistake. Had I known that in order to maintain my status as a Human DoT I<br/>
would need weapon skills, I would have been training them from level 1, as<br/>
it was a pain in the butt to raise 2hb from 0 and not have whatever group I<br/>
was in get ticked off for carrying me.<br/>
<br/>
In the end though, I look at it one way, and one way only... Do I still love<br/>
playing my monk? You betcha :)  And that, in the end, is the only question<br/>
that really needs to be answered.<br/>
<br/>
Do you still love playing your monk? :)<br/>

     I would have to agree that it would depend upon the situation, but with<br/>
my weight as it is I try not to carry any extras. Most of the time the<br/>
Clerics I have been with have not even used CH on me since from what they<br/>
have said I just do not have the HPs to make it to its optimum mana<br/>
efficiency. I do not claim to know anything about a Cleric&#39;s business so I<br/>
will not say anything more on that. <br/>
<br/>
     I do know that most of the time recently I have not been aggroed the<br/>
most in my group. Get a good warrior or even any other real tank and they<br/>
will keep the mobs off you. When I have died the extra 135hps would not have<br/>
made jack for a difference. Those times being like when FD failed while<br/>
trying to split a spawn and times of the like. I mean when I have a Froggy<br/>
Wiz out there blasting my socks off for two bubs a nuke and knights popping<br/>
me for 100+ with double hits 135hps is not going to make a ton of<br/>
difference.<br/>
<br/>
     In places where the mobs have SO many HPs and hit SO hard I would much<br/>
rather do my little extra part in hitting that mob a little harder or a<br/>
little more often. I have long given up the thought that I am a tank. Any<br/>
Monk who thinks himself a tank is delusional. We do not have the HPs to be a<br/>
tank and no amount of HPs from Equipment is going to make the difference in<br/>
that. Now if you started talking about 100 or maybe even 75 for one piece of<br/>
Equipment I could see the difference. <br/>
<br/>
     Unless something is going to dramaticly shift the balance of power I am<br/>
not a primary meat wall. I am a damage dealer for the group. This is<br/>
actually one of my primary gripes about the Monk class. We have so much<br/>
fewer HPs then the primary tank classes and our damage output is only<br/>
marginally better I question the true value of a Monk in a group. Though in<br/>
the end I must accept my role as damage dealer and freak puller so therefore<br/>
I must side with STR items as my mainline equipment. Afterall once the spawn<br/>
is broken the Warriors or other mainline tank classes can then do a much<br/>
better job of pulling then a Monk. Being able to wait longer before needing<br/>
a heal and thus being able to build up the aggro list much higher.<br/>
<br/>
     This leads me to a question for all of you. Before Kunark came out<br/>
Verant said Monks were balanced with the other classes. Yes, the other<br/>
classes had much better AC for their planes armor but this was balanced out<br/>
by our much higher defensive skill caps. Well, since Kunark the new armors<br/>
for the other classes came out with insane AC and their skill caps sky<br/>
rocketed up to almost our level. We have recieved nothing. If we were<br/>
balanced before all this enhancing of the other melee classes what does that<br/>
mean now? Does this make sense to anyone out there and if it does please<br/>
explain to me. <br/>
