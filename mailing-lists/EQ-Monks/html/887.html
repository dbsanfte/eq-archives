<div id="ygrps-yiv-1853852771"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Is there ANY way to separate mobs that stack one on top the other? I was in<br/>
&gt; Najena today trying to pull the Ogre Captain. I&#39;d hit him and run back out<br/>
&gt; of the room. He would come along with one of his officers. But they were<br/>
&gt; directly on top of each other and they would consistently leave together.<br/>
&gt; What am I doing wrong?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m actually camped outside of najena.  I went in with a group of 4 (lvls<br/>
18-21).  Could anyone give any pointers to fighting in this dungeon?  we<br/>
mainly just fought the ogre guards, and cleaned up some trains that people<br/>
brought to the zone line. (one guy trained bonecrusher, and following<br/>
along were 2 inkie necro&#39;s, their pets, and several oger guards).<br/>
<br/>
we wanted to go in further, but kept getting jumped by green pets, and<br/>
elementals that gave no exp, but hurt really bad when you hit them.<br/>
<br/>
any specific class you want to group with here?  any good buffs to protect<br/>
agianst fire?<br/>
