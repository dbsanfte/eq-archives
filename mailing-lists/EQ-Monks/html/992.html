&gt; Subject: The best fight of my life<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Over the last few weeks, I have seen the &quot;older&quot; and &quot;wiser&quot; monks on these<br/>
&gt; list moan about the changes in Feign Death.  Everyone has strong feelings<br/>
&gt; about the game and the changes that have been made.  People have stated<br/>
&gt; that the changes have made monks unplayable.  I really don&#39;t know, since I<br/>
&gt; have only been playing for a few weeks and have not made it to the level<br/>
&gt; necessary for feign death.  Last night, however, I reaffirmed my belief<br/>
&gt; that the Monk class is truly the best class in this game, regardless of<br/>
&gt; design changes.  I will elaborate.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I had just leveled to 15th and had trained all available slots into Double<br/>
&gt; Attack.  I figured I would make a trip out to Black Burrow to hone my<br/>
&gt; skills before moving on to bigger game.  I know that at my level, that most<br/>
&gt; of the gnolls wouldn&#39;t give me any XP. I could pick up the teeth and gain<br/>
&gt; some small XP there.  I was playing solo.  There were several PCs around,<br/>
&gt; with a group of 13-15th level deciding to take on the gnoll commanders.<br/>
&gt; They were full up and I didn&#39;t go.  I stayed around the rest area, picking<br/>
&gt; off patrolling gnolls, and guards an the occasional brewer.  I had gone<br/>
&gt; back to the rest area for a breather.  Then, it happened:  Someone ticked<br/>
&gt; off the gnolls up in the commander area and trained them down onto us.  It<br/>
&gt; looked like an angry swarm coming out of a bee hive.  I was playing in full<br/>
&gt; window mode and the entire screen was filled with overlapping gnoll images.<br/>
&gt;  There was everything from Scrawny gnolls, up to the Commanders.  I could<br/>
&gt; not tell who my target was or how many there were.  Everyone in that room<br/>
&gt; was in for the fight of their digital lives.  At one point I know I was<br/>
&gt; fighting 2 guards, an elite guard and a commander.  That I could tell from<br/>
&gt; the descriptive text.  Spells were flying, weapons were slashing, and my<br/>
&gt; fist and feet were flying as fast as I could throw them.  Several<br/>
&gt; relatively low level casters fell first.  Then, the panic set in.  People<br/>
&gt; started running, but the train didn&#39;t follow them away.  It stayed there.<br/>
&gt; The PC panic was led by a pair of Troll warriors, who conned red to me.  I<br/>
&gt; saw them and others run.  I just kept fighting.  I managed to get a mend<br/>
&gt; off and a cleric or Druid healed me at one point in the fight.  When it was<br/>
&gt; all over, the only 2 PCs left in the room full of gnoll bodies, were myself<br/>
&gt; and another monk who was 16th level.  I still had 2 1/2 bubbles of health.<br/>
&gt; I picked up 8 gnoll teeth out of that fight and dumped more coin than I<br/>
&gt; wanted to carry.  With the exception of the heal, I had no magical buffs,<br/>
&gt; not even a SOW to help in case of retreat.  I wear cured silk armor, but<br/>
&gt; more than 2/3 of my AC is innate.  I don&#39;t have any fancy equipment,<br/>
&gt; although I do have the money to purchase some.  The next time some warrior<br/>
&gt; starts talking about how great they are, their armor is, their weapons,<br/>
&gt; etc.., just relate this little story.<br/>

&gt; A monk is very fun in his teens.  Once you get past the 20s you<br/>
&gt; will find ver very few places you can solo, however.  By that time,<br/>
&gt; a mob that cons low blue will take out the best equipped monk<br/>
&gt; without much of a sweat.  You will also start seeing warriors or<br/>
&gt; other melee types wielding weapons that easily make them better<br/>
&gt; damagers than you. Rangers with dual ykeshas in their low 30s<br/>
&gt; are not uncommon and those weapons essentially do the same<br/>
&gt; damage as a 44th level monk.  Also at 30th level warriros get a<br/>
&gt; huge HP bonus.  You will see their ability to tank go up dramatically<br/>
&gt; where as we can barely take hits from higher level mobs.  But what<br/>
&gt; set us apart was feign death.  With that skill I feared no zone.  I<br/>
&gt; could go anywhere as I had a nice safety net.  Now that safety net<br/>
&gt; is gone.  I have to cower at the zone lines with those same warriors<br/>
&gt; until some group is nice enough to pick me up.  Unfortunately, they<br/>
&gt; would rather not anymore.  Alas there isn&#39;t much left for me to do so<br/>
&gt; I have been looking into a nice retirement community next door to<br/>
&gt; the druid retirement grove.  I may try to kill a few dragons from time<br/>
&gt; to time, but I am not wanted there anymore either.  Too much mana<br/>
&gt; to keep me alive.  Troll Warriors are much more mana efficient.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Oh well.  Now I may finally find peace and tranquility.<br/>

&gt; Thanks for raining on my parade.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You have attained a level of experience that I may not obtain for months.<br/>
&gt; Please understand that this is based on my limited experience and opinion.<br/>
&gt; Prehaps those of us who haven&#39;t played under the old feign death, will find<br/>
&gt; other means to deal with the problems you listed.  No disrespect meant to<br/>
&gt; you or any of the others, but it sounds like feign death was a crutch.<br/>
&gt; Maybe at higher levels we need to learn to adjust our tactics and stop<br/>
&gt; meeting problems head on.  We should be thinking fighters.  Let the wariors<br/>
&gt; wade in and trade blows with the big bad guy.  Let the warriors take the<br/>
&gt; role of the tank, while we take the role of the Smart bomb.  We zero in on<br/>
&gt; a target and take them out clean and fast.  I agree that warrior based<br/>
&gt; classes and their weapons can do more damge than we can, per hit, but I<br/>
&gt; still think we hit more often.  They are also too dependent upon those<br/>
&gt; weapons for their abilites.  Everything we have is innate.  Let Verant<br/>
&gt; throw in a zone or two that magic doesn&#39;t work and see who is really the<br/>
&gt; true meele (sp?) master. Strip a warrior of his weapons and armor and you<br/>
&gt; have a target .  Strip us, and we are still deadly.  I think we just have<br/>
&gt; to adjust our purpose in the Verant universe<br/>

&gt; I know a lot of people are going to disagree with me, but Verant&#39;s change to<br/>
&gt; the feign death is warranted. People WERE exploiting the FD especially<br/>
&gt; inside the planes. One way to fix that WITHOUT screwing a lot of lower level<br/>
&gt; people was to make it where any creature under level 35, would think you<br/>
&gt; were dead and forget about you while creatures 35th and up would use the<br/>
&gt; different percentages setup by Verant. I think this fair. I have ONLY used<br/>
&gt; feign death in serious situations where there was a train on my butt and I<br/>
&gt; was definitely going to die because I couldn&#39;t make it to a zone. I feel<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s what it was intended to do and some people figured out a way to<br/>
&gt; exploit it in the planes with the big creatures. So thats that. I&#39;m fine<br/>
&gt; with it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As for other things, I have a 36th level monk on the Tribunal and I WOULDN&#39;T<br/>
&gt; have made it this far without having a balanced group of guildmembers to go<br/>
&gt; around with. Since monks dont get the huge amounts of HPs we really lose out<br/>
&gt; to the other warrior classes. Saying that I can honestly say that the monks<br/>
&gt; are the best class in the game. I know you&#39;re looking forward to that flying<br/>
&gt; kick skill too and while i&#39;m at 180 skill I still miss about 60% of the time<br/>
&gt; ,AGAINST LOW BLUES,even though I have a 131dex and 137agi. Even with these<br/>
&gt; problems I will continue to play my monk though, UGLY robe and all, because<br/>
&gt; I have to admit I have had fun playing it. Seeing &quot;You kick a greater kobold<br/>
&gt; for 88 points.&quot; is one hell of a rush. I also have one hell of  bank<br/>
&gt; account.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well, this is just getting plain silly. Your monk is not a worthless pile of<br/>
&gt; meat. Its not a mana sponge, or a helpless school girl. The monk class at<br/>
&gt; any level does a Great Deal of Damage, and in my opinion more than any other<br/>
&gt; melee class with the exception of a warrior with Plane of Fear equipment.<br/>
&gt; Your strength lies not with one or two glorious swings for 70 points of<br/>
&gt; damage, but in four punches for 23, and a flying kick for 52. Your Armor<br/>
&gt; class is not as high as a warriors, it never will be. Get used to it, but<br/>
&gt; also get used to Block, Dodge, Block. You hit points are lower, until you<br/>
&gt; factor in a 25% hit point heal every six minutes, you&#39;re selling yourself<br/>
&gt; short.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As for playing with Twinked characters who out damage you, I must answer to<br/>
&gt; the positive. I&#39;ve been playing with Ranger and Bard both of which carry top<br/>
&gt; of the line Ykeesha&#39;s and they generally out damage me (then again, they<br/>
&gt; take the damage then, too and I&#39;m a hell of a lot harder to hit than some<br/>
&gt; ranger). The gap is narrowing however, and would be closed if they were not<br/>
&gt; wearing haste sashes. Remember, the higher you level, the less of an<br/>
&gt; advantage Twinking Gives.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yes Verant has changed our most unique skill, it will still save youin tight<br/>
&gt; situations, however. At least we have it! I&#39;ve used it numerous times to get<br/>
&gt; myself out of Castle Mistmoore when EVERYONE in my party died, twinks and<br/>
&gt; casters alike. Indeed, they&#39;ve suggested calling me Stonedorn EscapeArtist.<br/>
&gt; Its harder now, but playing a Monk was never an easy path.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; To be honest, I think we&#39;ve passed the meaningful discussion of the class<br/>
&gt; and have entered into &quot;the Grass is Greener&quot; syndrome. If you&#39;re so unhappy<br/>
&gt; with your Monk, Give It Up and go play a Dark Elf Necro. Please don&#39;t take<br/>
&gt; the Monk Name in the Realm of Envious Complainers.<br/>

&gt; I am kinda confused on why you think using a skill on a below 35th level mob<br/>
&gt; is ok and why using it on an above 35th level mob is an exploit?  I also<br/>
&gt; undertsand that different people use different skill in different ways.<br/>
&gt; Verant nerfed druids kiting but in return made them more viable in the<br/>
&gt; group. it is all in how you use the skill while I see the need to fix an<br/>
&gt; exploit (Verant specifically mentioned dragons and FD they did not mention<br/>
&gt; monks specifically nor Planes that I have seen or heard) but to make a point<br/>
&gt; you are correct that monks need a good group and the only groups I get now<br/>
&gt; are guildmates and freinds because no one wants me anymore. At the higher<br/>
&gt; levels there are so few places to hunt for exp and they all are train heavy<br/>
&gt; places with lots of wanderers anbd thats just a risk neither I nor potential<br/>
&gt; trains victums want.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I know a lot of people are going to disagree with me, but Verant&#39;s change<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; the feign death is warranted. People WERE exploiting the FD especially<br/>
&gt; &gt; inside the planes. One way to fix that WITHOUT screwing a lot of lower<br/>
&gt; level<br/>
&gt; &gt; people was to make it where any creature under level 35, would think you<br/>
&gt; &gt; were dead and forget about you while creatures 35th and up would use the<br/>
&gt; &gt; different percentages setup by Verant. I think this fair. I have ONLY used<br/>
&gt; &gt; feign death in serious situations where there was a train on my butt and I<br/>
&gt; &gt; was definitely going to die because I couldn&#39;t make it to a zone. I feel<br/>
&gt; &gt; that&#39;s what it was intended to do and some people figured out a way to<br/>
&gt; &gt; exploit it in the planes with the big creatures. So thats that. I&#39;m fine<br/>
&gt; &gt; with it.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; As for other things, I have a 36th level monk on the Tribunal and I<br/>
&gt; WOULDN&#39;T<br/>
&gt; &gt; have made it this far without having a balanced group of guildmembers to<br/>
&gt; go<br/>
&gt; &gt; around with. Since monks dont get the huge amounts of HPs we really lose<br/>
&gt; out<br/>
&gt; &gt; to the other warrior classes. Saying that I can honestly say that the<br/>
&gt; monks<br/>
&gt; &gt; are the best class in the game. I know you&#39;re looking forward to that<br/>
&gt; flying<br/>
&gt; &gt; kick skill too and while i&#39;m at 180 skill I still miss about 60% of the<br/>
&gt; time<br/>
&gt; &gt; ,AGAINST LOW BLUES,even though I have a 131dex and 137agi. Even with these<br/>
&gt; &gt; problems I will continue to play my monk though, UGLY robe and all,<br/>
&gt; because<br/>
&gt; &gt; I have to admit I have had fun playing it. Seeing &quot;You kick a greater<br/>
&gt; kobold<br/>
&gt; &gt; for 88 points.&quot; is one hell of a rush. I also have one hell of  bank<br/>
&gt; &gt; account.<br/>

&gt;     I just wanted to let you know about the AC issue and monks.  We do have <br/>
&gt; as good AC as warriors.  At lvl 50, my AC is 824 base, and that&#39;s not with my <br/>
&gt; tankin gear, I can easily bump it up to over 850.<br/>
&gt;     Now for my lil rant.  HOW can you say using FD pulling was exploiting on <br/>
&gt; the planes??  Do you know what happens now?  Even more of a cheat if you ask <br/>
&gt; me.  Just takes longer, cause now after FD, you just need to /exit and wait 3 <br/>
&gt; min before loggin back into the server.  I have been lvl 50 for about 2 or 3 <br/>
&gt; months now, and this nerf has seriously hurt our skills.  We are pullers, <br/>
&gt; that is our main contribution to a party after we get FD and hone our skills. <br/>
&gt;  We can still do this job, but it makes it MUCH more difficult and time <br/>
&gt; comsuming.  Yes you can get around it, BUT, IMHO, I now think we have to use <br/>
&gt; more of a cheat to get around it.  There are other ways, yes, but WHY (and <br/>
&gt; believe me, I&#39;ve sent in MANY feedbacks and petitions) did Verant change this <br/>
&gt; skill.  Okay, I&#39;m done, thanks for listening all.<br/>

&gt; &gt;HOW can you say using FD pulling was exploiting on  the planes??  Do you<br/>
&gt; know what happens now?  Even more of a cheat if you ask me.  Just takes<br/>
&gt; longer, cause now after FD, you just need to /exit and wait 3 min before<br/>

&gt; now, and this nerf has seriously hurt our skills.  We are pullers, that is<br/>
&gt; our main contribution to a party after we get FD and hone our skills.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I didn&#39;t say it was. I don&#39;t think FD pulling is an exploit. It is handled<br/>
&gt; wrong in the Gameplay Logic. Personally I think once you FD and a mob _sees_<br/>
&gt; you back on your feet again, it should never believe another oneo of you<br/>
&gt; FDs. As I&#39;ve said before, Verant has a MUD mentality in which they balance<br/>
&gt; gameplay at the expense of logic. This is bad design.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Getting back to the point is the way in which two main incidents were<br/>
&gt; handled. The first being the new monk robe, which is marginally better than<br/>
&gt; a lockjaw vest AC 12 vs AC 9 vs and choice of which stat increases you think<br/>
&gt; is most valuable. Personally, I&#39;ll take the AC at this point in my monks<br/>
&gt; career. Introducing this item seemed to me a border line waste of time, not<br/>
&gt; mine, but theirs. The second incident being the FD thing. My favorite<br/>
&gt; example being when you stand back up and everyone but the caboose of the<br/>
&gt; train forgets you and he goes along re-aggroing the lot.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think what got everyone so worked up was the FD split-pull defined the<br/>
&gt; monk&#39;s role in the group. Now that role has changed, and its led to<br/>
&gt; confusion and no small amount of bitterness. Given the over-crowding issue<br/>
&gt; in most dungeons though, (75 in lower guk? _shudder_) the split-pull was<br/>
&gt; becoming less important as &quot;just finding&quot; something to attack.<br/>

&gt; I didn&#39;t realise that my little story was going to have people at each<br/>
&gt; other&#39;s throats.  I was posting something that I hoped would re-instill<br/>
&gt; pride in our class, instead of everyone sitting around wringing their hand,<br/>
&gt; how can we as the player&#39;s redefine our place in the s about how useless we<br/>
&gt; are as a class.  There are many intelligent people on this list, most of<br/>
&gt; you are probably smarter than I am.  Many of you have been playing the game<br/>
&gt; and this class longer than I have.  I suppose the situation is much akin to<br/>
&gt; the role of children and parents.  Since one of the roles of children in<br/>
&gt; society is to question the way things are, I  would like to propose a<br/>
&gt; sersious intellectual discussion of the situation.  Lets use the following<br/>
&gt; question as that basis:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Given Verant&#39;s change in the Feign Death skill, what can we as players do<br/>
&gt; to change our role or our preceived role in the game, based on game mechanics?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The rules:<br/>
&gt; 1.  Everyones opinion matters<br/>
&gt; 2.  No flaming or personal attacks<br/>
&gt; 3.  Quitting the game, playing Asheron&#39;s call, or starting new characters<br/>
&gt; are not viable answers.<br/>

&gt; maybe FD pulling itself is an exploit?  maybe verant never intended the <br/>
&gt; monk class<br/>
&gt; to be able to break spawns by fd pulling?  maybe they just intended it as a <br/>
&gt; &#39;&#39;get out<br/>

&gt; &gt;Thanks for raining on my parade.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;You have attained a level of experience that I may not obtain for months.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Please understand that this is based on my limited experience and opinion.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sorry, that was not my intention.  Like I said, my monk was great fun until<br/>
&gt; very high levels for me so I expect you will enjoy your monk for quite a<br/>
&gt; while.  If he wasn&#39;t I would not have gotten him so far.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;Prehaps those of us who haven&#39;t played under the old feign death, will find<br/>
&gt; &gt;other means to deal with the problems you listed.  No disrespect meant to<br/>
&gt; &gt;you or any of the others, but it sounds like feign death was a crutch.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well I did not speak at all of FD pulling which is what you probably heard<br/>
&gt; everyone mention.  And FD IS a crutch.  It was meant to be.  I continued<br/>
&gt; playing my monk because we were the masters of melee and also because<br/>
&gt; of FD (I started my FD countdown at 12th level).  At my level, rogues are the<br/>
&gt; masters of melee and FD simply doesn&#39;t work well enough to use as a safety<br/>
&gt; net.  Plus the mobs I face cannot reasonably be meleed to death.  We are<br/>
&gt; just there to do damage to keep the mobs thinking about us while the nukers<br/>
&gt; and DoTers (and healers) so their jobs.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;Maybe at higher levels we need to learn to adjust our tactics and stop<br/>
&gt; &gt;meeting problems head on.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well, the FD pull technique was meant for just that 8).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;Strip us, and we are still deadly.  I think we just have<br/>
&gt; &gt;to adjust our purpose in the Verant universe<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I didn&#39;t get to my level just so I can still kill mobs while looking for my<br/>
&gt; corpse.<br/>
&gt; But of course that was another role for FD.  Corpse recovery missions.  No<br/>
&gt; longer.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;I know a lot of people are going to disagree with me, but Verant&#39;s change to<br/>
&gt; &gt;the feign death is warranted. People WERE exploiting the FD especially<br/>
&gt; &gt;inside the planes. One way to fix that WITHOUT screwing a lot of lower level<br/>
&gt; &gt;people was to make it where any creature under level 35, would think you<br/>
&gt; &gt;were dead and forget about you while creatures 35th and up would use the<br/>
&gt; &gt;different percentages setup by Verant. I think this fair.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Inside the plains?  At 36th level (unless you have another plane level char)<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t see how you can come to that conclusion.  If anything, the change<br/>
&gt; to FD is even more of an exploit.  Imagine now that every mob in the game<br/>
&gt; is able to track monks without fail.  And as another post mentioned.  If you<br/>
&gt; think something is an exploit, why would you say it is ok for mobs under 35th<br/>
&gt; level?  I have always accepted that feigning on non KoS mobs and then<br/>
&gt; popping back up (to bandage or whatnot) was something of an exploit and I<br/>
&gt; have been expecting a fix.  If they removed that a lot of lower level monks<br/>
&gt; who relied on it to kill aviaks or whatever would have grumbled loudly as it<br/>
&gt; would remove their main soloing technique (what would your reaction be if<br/>
&gt; they did that to you at say 20th level or so?).  However the nerf they did to FD<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t fix an exploit.  It just gave the mobs one.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;I have ONLY used<br/>
&gt; &gt;feign death in serious situations where there was a train on my butt and I<br/>
&gt; &gt;was definitely going to die because I couldn&#39;t make it to a zone.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Good luck now since that aspect of FD has also been seriously degraded.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;I feel<br/>
&gt; &gt;that&#39;s what it was intended to do and some people figured out a way to<br/>
&gt; &gt;exploit it in the planes with the big creatures. So thats that. I&#39;m fine<br/>
&gt; &gt;with it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What difference does it make how  it was intended?  What you are saying is<br/>
&gt; that verant should be expected to make things like tactics, strategy, and other<br/>
&gt; forms of thinking in the game illegal.  Giving mob an unlimited<br/>
&gt; tracking/telepathic<br/>
&gt; ability is the exploit here.  What monks did was perfectly reasonable as long as<br/>
&gt; mobs aren&#39;t telepathically linked, which - oh no - now they are!   Telepathic<br/>
&gt; orcs.<br/>
&gt; What will they think of next.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;Well, this is just getting plain silly. Your monk is not a worthless pile of<br/>
&gt; &gt;meat. Its not a mana sponge, or a helpless school girl. The monk class at<br/>
&gt; &gt;any level does a Great Deal of Damage, and in my opinion more than any<br/>
&gt; &gt;other melee class with the exception of a warrior with Plane of Fear equipment.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Not a mana sponge?  How many 120+ hits do you think a monk can take? See<br/>
&gt; how long you can stand up to the frenzied ghoul even at 50th when you out level<br/>
&gt; him by 5 or so!  The next best thing to a healer is a great taunting tank or<br/>
&gt; another<br/>
&gt; melee class that dishes out more damage.  I certainly am not whining about other<br/>
&gt; classes doing more damage than me.  I&#39;d love to have them in my group!  The<br/>
&gt; problem I face is that if I go into a zone shouting &quot;monk looking for group&quot; I<br/>
&gt; will be<br/>
&gt; met by silence.  Why?  Suppose I actually do outdamage other classes.  The<br/>
&gt; problem is that I can&#39;t outdmage by enough to compensate for:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; the massive HPs of a warrior (complete heal becomes much more efficient and<br/>
&gt; the warrior gives the cleric the time to cast it, and the warrior can taunt the<br/>
&gt; mob<br/>
&gt; off when it inevitably goes after the cleric).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; the dual wielding ability of a ranger with great weapons (ykesha = 44th level<br/>
&gt; monk with similar skill) who can snare SOW and TRACK.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Paladins with great quest weapons with a ton of HP, a complete heal, great<br/>
&gt; taunting, and a great AC.  Not to mention a role as a backup healer<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Rogues just tear mobs apart, easily outdamaging any other melee class in the<br/>
&gt; game at high levels.  Of course they are in far worse shape than monks without<br/>
&gt; someone taking the mobs off them.  Rogues were born nerfed and will die<br/>
&gt; nerfed.  But the rogue is still the master of melee.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &lt;and in a second post&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;I didn&#39;t say it was. I don&#39;t think FD pulling is an exploit. It is handled<br/>
&gt; &gt;wrong in the Gameplay Logic. Personally I think once you FD and a mob _sees_<br/>
&gt; &gt;you back on your feet again, it should never believe another oneo of you<br/>
&gt; &gt;FDs. As I&#39;ve said before, Verant has a MUD mentality in which they balance<br/>
&gt; &gt;gameplay at the expense of logic. This is bad design.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What you neglect here is the fact that the mobs you are FD pulling (actually<br/>
&gt; the mobs you aren&#39;t pulling) DON&#39;T see you get up, assuming you are doing<br/>
&gt; it right.  Why should they run back to you when they don&#39;t see you get up?  Of<br/>
&gt; all the people who look down on us for complaining about the nerf, not ONE<br/>
&gt; person has managed to explain what makes this more logical.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &lt;back to first post&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;Your strength lies not with one or two glorious swings for 70 points of<br/>
&gt; &gt;damage, but in four punches for 23, and a flying kick for 52. Your Armor<br/>
&gt; &gt;class is not as high as a warriors, it never will be. Get used to it, but<br/>
&gt; &gt;also get used to Block, Dodge, Block. You hit points are lower, until you<br/>
&gt; &gt;factor in a 25% hit point heal every six minutes, you&#39;re selling yourself<br/>
&gt; &gt;short.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; How about a 44th level ranger hitting 4 times with his ykesha for 40+ each<br/>
&gt; and a proc for 70?  I have kicked for 111, but I usually miss and my average<br/>
&gt; damage is maybe 40ish.  Our defensive skills cap the same as theirs so they<br/>
&gt; will dodge parry riposte about as much as we do.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When travelling with a healer or 3 you should never need mend unless you bite<br/>
&gt; off more than you can chew.  But if that happens your group is more likely to<br/>
&gt; evac.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;As for playing with Twinked characters who out damage you, I must answer to<br/>
&gt; &gt;the positive. I&#39;ve been playing with Ranger and Bard both of which carry top<br/>
&gt; &gt;of the line Ykeesha&#39;s and they generally out damage me (then again, they<br/>
&gt; &gt;take the damage then, too and I&#39;m a hell of a lot harder to hit than some<br/>
&gt; &gt;ranger). The gap is narrowing however, and would be closed if they were not<br/>
&gt; &gt;wearing haste sashes. Remember, the higher you level, the less of an<br/>
&gt; &gt;advantage Twinking Gives.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It is very easy to see how much of an impact twinking gives.  But it is not<br/>
&gt; really<br/>
&gt; a matter of twinking.  Equipment is permanent.  And on old servers, with limited<br/>
&gt; inventory/bank space, newer/better weapons will find their way down the line<br/>
&gt; and the average level character holding a particular prize will decline over<br/>
&gt; time.<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s just the way the server based economy works.  So it isn&#39;t a matter of<br/>
&gt; monks<br/>
&gt; getting worse, it is a matter of the weapons held by other melee classes getting<br/>
&gt; better.  I am sure Verant intended the monks to be masters of melee.  For a<br/>
&gt; while<br/>
&gt; they succeeded quite well in my opinion.  However, as the other melee classes of<br/>
&gt; a particular level improve over time with new weapons, monks have basically been<br/>
&gt; gathering dust and this melee edge has shrunk or become non-existent to the<br/>
&gt; point<br/>
&gt; that the other classes offer other things that outweigh any supposed edge we may<br/>
&gt; have.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For 1-handed weapons, the best a monk can ever do is dmg 14 delay 36.  There<br/>
&gt; are now a ton of weapons in the game that have better dmg/delay ratios than that<br/>
&gt; and also proc for even more damage (at 44th level a monk is 12/36 which is the<br/>
&gt; same ratio as a ykesha).  Giving that to a warrior who has 1.5-2x your hp, and<br/>
&gt; can<br/>
&gt; taunt makes a monks damage dealing capacity in a group very much in doubt.  Plus<br/>
&gt; at the highest levels, melee is just to keep the mobs busy while the DoTs do<br/>
&gt; their job<br/>
&gt; and nukes finish the mob off.  When shamans and druids can heal and DoT for<br/>
&gt; 2000+ and wizards can chuck 1100+ per ice comet, the extra 2-3 points per hit we<br/>
&gt; may or may not be adding just don&#39;t seem to be enough to compensate the group<br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; any of the other abilities the other melee classes bring.  That is the reason<br/>
&gt; why monks<br/>
&gt; got defined as pullers because it was the only thing we were unarguably the best<br/>
&gt; at<br/>
&gt; and of the most important contributions anyone can make to a group.  How many<br/>
&gt; plane or dragon raids were considered to require a monk (pre-patch)?  It was<br/>
&gt; a moot point.  You had one or you just didn&#39;t bother.  Now, monks can still<br/>
&gt; chain<br/>
&gt; pull if necessary and lay on the ground.  Now even a wizard out melees the<br/>
&gt; monk.  I could be doing that, but that&#39;s just not any fun.  Which is the whole<br/>
&gt; point.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;Yes Verant has changed our most unique skill, it will still save youin tight<br/>
&gt; &gt;situations<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Think again.  Even the core purpose for FD has been seriously nerfed.  It<br/>
&gt; fails way way way too much, and new spawns can now see through it.  And<br/>
&gt; FD is now very very dangerous not just to the monk but to anyone in the same<br/>
&gt; zone.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;To be honest, I think we&#39;ve passed the meaningful discussion of the class<br/>
&gt; &gt;and have entered into &quot;the Grass is Greener&quot; syndrome. If you&#39;re so unhappy<br/>
&gt; &gt;with your Monk, Give It Up and go play a Dark Elf Necro. Please don&#39;t take<br/>
&gt; &gt;the Monk Name in the Realm of Envious Complainers.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It has nothing to do with any other class being better.  I am all in favor of<br/>
&gt; warriors rangers and what not being great in my group.  I am not looking to<br/>
&gt; be the star of the show.  I just want to be invited to a show once in a while.<br/>
&gt; The problem I have is not with all these great weapons lying around, but the<br/>
&gt; general consensus at high levels that &quot;monks are only needed for pulling, and<br/>
&gt; if they can&#39;t pull why invite them into the group?&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &lt;rant on&gt;<br/>
&gt; That being said, I hear too much of this &quot;play another character if you don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; like<br/>
&gt; the change&quot; crap.  Why even play in a game that consistently makes these sorts<br/>
&gt; of changes?  If I wanted to play a DE necro, I would have made one already (of<br/>
&gt; course they have been seriously nerfed as well, but not as badly because they<br/>
&gt; are still desirable in groups).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I wanted to play a monk.  The monk I wanted to play existed when the game<br/>
&gt; started.  I had something to look forward to.  He doesn&#39;t anymore and there is<br/>
&gt; nothing for me to look forward to unless I like to play with my face attached to<br/>
&gt; the ground while the action surrounds me.  In any case, even if I were to make<br/>
&gt; another character, what will stop Verant from nerfing that class into the<br/>
&gt; ground?<br/>
&gt; Take a look at what&#39;s on the test server.  Shaman spell diurations (eg SOW) are<br/>
&gt; cut in half) and druids lost tracking.  Who knows what else.  Will monks get<br/>
&gt; something in the future to make them seem useful again?  Sure.  They will<br/>
&gt; introduce the Iskar monk removing yet another unique aspect of the (human)<br/>
&gt; monk.  What race will virtually all new monks be once the expansion comes?<br/>
&gt; Humans? Guess again.  It is very possible (and I am not prone to conspiracy<br/>
&gt; theories) that the human monk is being phased out of existence.  Of course<br/>
&gt; we&#39;ll have to wait and see what the new race is like, but the email I got from<br/>
&gt; Verant stated very little of what will be new aside from Iskar monks.  An<br/>
&gt; interview with brad McQuaid tells us not to expect any new skills unless we are<br/>
&gt; Iskar.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Tell me what else I can look forward to.<br/>
&gt; &lt;rant off&gt;<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; maybe FD pulling itself is an exploit?  maybe verant never intended the <br/>
&gt; &gt; monk class<br/>
&gt; &gt; to be able to break spawns by fd pulling?  maybe they just intended it as a <br/>
&gt; &gt; &#39;&#39;get out<br/>
&gt; &gt; of death free&#39;&#39; card for the individual monk?  I personally think some <br/>
&gt; &gt; spawns should<br/>
&gt; &gt; not be able to be broken since it makes the game too easy.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I imagine they didnt think of fd pulling, it just happened.  Thats whats<br/>
&gt; kind of unrealistic.  IMHO, whe you build a game of this magnitude, you<br/>
&gt; build the environment, and see what falls.  they planned on the monk being<br/>
&gt; the melee damage dealer, and instead he ends up being a puller.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I kind of see the fd pulling along the same lines as bard twisting.  did<br/>
&gt; they plan for that? probably not.  But I bet bards would be upset if they<br/>
&gt; removed that ability.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Our role hasn&#39;t really changed all that much (I&#39;m speaking from the lvl 50 <br/>
&gt; point of view and pulling in the planes, and the harder mobs on Norrath.)  We <br/>
&gt; are still needed in PoH w/o a doubt.  I believe Verant has nerfed FD to what <br/>
&gt; they want it to be, which is just causing ppl to play more and items for high <br/>
&gt; lvls harder to get.  This is extremely evident in the drop percentage of <br/>
&gt; plane armor.  When PoF first opened, armor dropped quite often, now you can <br/>
&gt; get groups of 18 to 30 ppl on a plane, spend 18 hours plus and get maybe 5 to <br/>
&gt; 7 drops total.  Verant is just tryin to make more money off us, and that is <br/>
&gt; where my major gripe is.  There are various ways around FD pulling technique. <br/>
&gt;  Pulling to a &#39;safe&#39; spot and waiting til one mob is left, then have an <br/>
&gt; archer shoot that one mob and pull it. This makes it so the monk cannot fight <br/>
&gt; though the entire battle.  Then we stand up, the aggroed monsters run back to <br/>
&gt; us at the &#39;safe&#39; spot and we FD again, having the archer pull one more when <br/>
&gt; it is left.  This method is the safest, but the most boring for us.  Another <br/>
&gt; method is to have an enchanter along.  The monk pulls to the &#39;safe&#39; spot, and <br/>
&gt; has to wait until ALL aggroed mobs are on him, then FD.  The enchanter cast <br/>
&gt; their AE mem blur, and the monk waits until one mob is left, then pull it.  <br/>
&gt; This will not work on PoF, as the enchanter will be aggroed before being in <br/>
&gt; range to cast the spell.  It is also dangerous if ALL the mobs aggroed to the <br/>
&gt; monk are not in area of the spell.  So in standing will cause the ones not in <br/>
&gt; range to aggro again and pull everything in the way on you again.  This <br/>
&gt; allows the monk to participate in the battle but is riskier.  No longer are <br/>
&gt; we able to pull AND fight, so we don&#39;t contribute nearly as much to a group <br/>
&gt; anymore.  Oh, and on a side note, FD DOES NOT work like they have said on <br/>
&gt; mobs lvl 35+.  From personal experience, I have FD 15 to 20 times in a row <br/>
&gt; and still have mobs aggroing me that are no where near line of sight.  The <br/>
&gt; whole FD nerf and it&#39;s excuse for one is just a ploy by Verant to stall for <br/>
&gt; the expansion, and for this reason as all others everyone has, I plead with <br/>
&gt; you to continue to write in feedback to have FD put back to it&#39;s original <br/>
&gt; status.  We were once also instrumental in corpse recovery, but having mobs <br/>
&gt; continued aggro, now it is near impossible unless the dungeon is a low lvl <br/>
&gt; for the lvls involved.  I could go on and on, but it would take hours to <br/>
&gt; write out all the feelings I have on this subject.<br/>

&gt; No, maybe they didn&#39;t see it when they FIRST programmed the game, but I <br/>
&gt; played in beta and let me assure you, Verant saw what it could do when <br/>
&gt; testing it.  And if you think it makes the game too easy, I strongly <br/>
&gt; encourage you to go to PoH and try to see what it would be like w/o monks <br/>
&gt; pulling.  Impossible.  Sure a group of maybe 50 lvl 50s could do it, but <br/>
&gt; whenever you get more than 24 ppl in an enclosed area fighting mobs, you <br/>
&gt; normally have 1/6 of the ppl goin ld. And it get worse as you add more ppl, <br/>
&gt; so plz tell me how anybody could do it, I&#39;m more than willing to listen.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Getting back to the point is the way in which two<br/>
&gt; &gt; main incidents were<br/>
&gt; &gt; handled. The first being the new monk robe, which is<br/>
&gt; &gt; marginally better than<br/>
&gt; &gt; a lockjaw vest AC 12 vs AC 9 vs and choice of which<br/>
&gt; &gt; stat increases you think<br/>
&gt; &gt; is most valuable. &#39;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What new monk robe?  Do you mean Cured Silk Gi?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If not what is name of this robe? stats? bonuses? what<br/>
&gt; does it look like and where can it be found?<br/>

&gt; It&#39;s the new quest monk robe.  You need to be around lvl 40 to get it, as the <br/>
&gt; mobs you need to kill are in lower guk and in the solb king area.  The mobs <br/>
&gt; are VERY rare spawns, you get pattern and needle from them to make a robe.  <br/>
&gt; You must be a master tailor yourself, as these items are no drop.  You take a <br/>
&gt; swatch of shadow silk, bard song Johnathan&#39;s Whistling Warsong, the needle <br/>
&gt; and the pattern from your quests and combine them to give you a robe (heard <br/>
&gt; it is crimson in color) that&#39;s stats are worse than a foreman&#39;s tunic that <br/>
&gt; can be obtained around lvl 30 from sola.  So much for the wonderful monk <br/>
&gt; quest items, bleh.<br/>
