<div id="ygrps-yiv-1164370995">On a whim, an enchanter and bard I regularly group with went to Lavastorm.  <br/>
We were all 17th level at the time.  We found it tough going at first mainly <br/>
because everytime we hit (and we monks do that a lot) most of the creatures <br/>
there we were taking damage (darn shields).<br/>
<br/>
We now spend most of our time in Najena and tend to group with others our <br/>
level and up to maybe level 22.  We have the occassional bad situation but <br/>
for the most part we are able to control the first third of the area.<br/>
<br/>
Last night was probably the worst.  I was escorting someone to the zone and <br/>
it seemed like everything came at us.  We had 2 ogre guards, 4 earth <br/>
elementals, 2 mist elementals, 1 fire elemental, probably 6 greater <br/>
skeletons, a magician and her pet and to top it off a terror tentacle <br/>
beating on us.  We almost got them all.  Mental Note: Feign Death is less <br/>
likely to work when there are 5-6 mobs hitting/casting on you at the same <br/>
time.  This situation is pretty rare I have found.<br/>
<br/>
If you can bring along someone to &#39;cancel magic&#39; when there is a shield, or <br/>
root the runners/blast the runners both Lavastorm and Najena can be lots of <br/>
fun.<br/>
<br/>
I digressed a bit.  Sorry.  Point is, we keep on coming back to Lavastorm <br/>
and Najena.<br/>

&gt;I also am level 17... I was hoping to find somewhere new, besides EK, WK,<br/>
&gt;etc.... Is Lavastorm a reasonable place for a level 17 to hunt?  According<br/>
&gt;to Eq-lozer it is 10 - 20 ... does anyone have any suggestions if I am<br/>
&gt;heading that way?<br/>

&gt; &gt; On a starting point I am a level 17 monk of Quellious<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; On the Blind issue: Everyone complains about this...<br/>
&gt; &gt; yet I don&#39;t seem to see the problem.  Perhaps it is<br/>
&gt; &gt; because I learn zones quickly and generally always<br/>
&gt; &gt; know where I am.  Buy a greater lightstone, memorize<br/>
&gt; &gt; the zone you are in, max out sense heading and always<br/>
&gt; &gt; know which way to run.  Thats the best advice I can<br/>
&gt; &gt; give.  I have a druid with infravision and it doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; seem to be much of an improvement (still can&#39;t see<br/>
&gt; &gt; anything in Misty Thicket)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Just live with it<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Second... I am level 17, i&#39;ve been hunt in oasis for 3<br/>
&gt; &gt; levels and I want to go somewhere else.  I was<br/>
&gt; &gt; thinking of East Karana.  Any recommendations as to<br/>
&gt; &gt; where I should hunt and what I should fight<br/>
