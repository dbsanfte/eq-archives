<div id="ygrps-yiv-242407617"><html><div style=''><div>
<p>Fight in zones close to banking / merchants </p>
<p>Newbie areas</p>
<p>the moon - bank in Shadow haven / Bazzaar</p>
<p>high keep - bank/ merchants</p>
<p>sola - merchant sells bandages / water</p>
<p>runneye - bank/merchants on 4th floor</p>
<p>(Find stuff on merchants that is stackable and can be bought without breaking into your PP and sells for decent change). In the temple of solselek ro (in the Lavastorm Zone) is a NPC named ginni she will sell you a fire opal for 55pp or 550 gold. After i spent a few hours in sola / and later solb, i would visit her and buy one. When i made it back to cabillis (iksar monk) I always had a stack or two or fire opals that sold for 40pp plus. At level 35, I went to cabillis and sold my loot and deposited 1600pp in the bank. Use your copper / silver to buy bandages. Having a high bind wound skill will only be one of the most beneficial things you invest your time in while playing this game. And get some CHA gear (the opal encrusted steins can be bought for 50pp each and give you +25 CHA so 100pp invested will next you the best selling / buying prices 105 CHA that your faction can buy you :)<br><br>Get 4 light weight bags that hold 6 to 8 items. Find some shamans. LVL 4 shamans and up can summon spirit pouches ( 100% WR 4 slor bags - place your food/water/bandages and loot in those bags) and REMEMBER to never log with anything in them that you did not want to lose. When done playing, place all the loot and your suplies back into the bag. I sometime ran back to cabillis at 50 stones killing green stuff along the way adding a few more PP to my bank and then i would go&nbsp;out again and do the same thing.  I lost a few things after playing real late and forgetting that i had the spirit pouches but all in all it allowed me to loot more and helped me buy fighting batons / Cane of Tranquils / +HP rings / and wu armor. </p></div>

<div></div>&gt;Many thanks for the information! 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;I will work hard to make sure I use it as much as I can! 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;Question.... If we as monks have to keep our weight limit down, how 
<div></div>&gt;do we ever make any money? 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;Wu&#39;s armor cost pp to buy along with jewelry STR and DEX.
