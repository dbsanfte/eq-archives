<div id="ygrps-yiv-933866759">So you&#39;re saying you haven&#39;t made one friend on EQ that you want to keep?<br/>
So you solo everything?  Never group, never interact?<br/>
<br/>
All those little names popping up on your screen are real people - true,<br/>
most of the game is spent trying to get better and better &quot;bits&quot; on that<br/>
computer in California, but to make a blanket the game is not real statement<br/>
is wrong.  There are people in that game that I care about, and I know there<br/>
are a few that return the favor.<br/>

This e-mail is not real.  It&#39;s bits on a computer in Georgia.<br/>

It should not be more than a game.  Because that is ALL it is, a game.<br/>
If its more to you, then you seriously need to stop &quot;playing&quot; it,<br/>
readjust your life, realize how little those bytes stored on a computer<br/>
in california really should mean to you.<br/>
