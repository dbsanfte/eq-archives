<div id="ygrps-yiv-1133232847">Making money is a good thing at lower levels but I wouldnt go out of my way<br/>
to try to make any. Once you get up in level Money really becomes valuless.<br/>
(sp?) if you have a way to make cash use it to get the items you need or<br/>
want, but cash in the bank gets old.  most of the really good items are<br/>
never sold only traded for. when was the last time you saw someone auctiona<br/>
FBSS or a Ykesha etc. if you just adventure and look foir the items you want<br/>
they will eventually show up. or you may just get somthing better than you<br/>
wanted in the 1st place.<br/>

&gt; &gt;P.S. 500p is a reasonable amount to have SAVED up by level 18, but making<br/>
&gt; &gt;500p IN ONE DAY at level 19 is amazing, he may not wnat to give away his<br/>
&gt; &gt;secret, but what ever he is doing to make that kind of money I would like<br/>
&gt; &gt;to know...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well, 500pp in ONE day isn&#39;t so hard.   Get lucky on a few rare spawns or<br/>
&gt; good loots (Runed Bone Fork, Chitin Shell tunic, etc), head to auction and<br/>
&gt; let the bidding commence.   500pp EVERY day at level 19 would be amazing!<br/>
&gt; Of course then you get into rapid devaluation of platinum, mass<br/>
&gt; unemployment, famine, disease, pottery sketch fraud, etc., etc.<br/>
