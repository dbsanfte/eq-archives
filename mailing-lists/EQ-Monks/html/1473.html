<b>Subject:</b> Re: [EQ-Monks] the goblin alchemist <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-885692524">Nono... his spawn POINT spawns every 72-80 minutes.  The alchemist, a<br/>
veteran, sentry, or a lookout will spawn.  The alchemist is the rare spawn<br/>
at that spawn point.<br/>
<br/>
In Misty, go to the single hut goblin camp.  He shares the spawn point with<br/>
Mooto.  It&#39;s the one just inside the hut.  This is generally a 2-4 hour<br/>
camp.  The goblin captain and gelatinous cube I think are on 20min spawns,<br/>
but I don&#39;t think they have placeholders.. i.e.: they always spawn.<br/>
Locations, I&#39;m not too sure of, as they were pulled to the zone for me. :)<br/>
Alchemist in Misty is about the same level as the one in Runny.  The goblin<br/>
captain is around level 22 or 23 I think, and so is the goblin captain.<br/>
<br/>
They always have the quest items.<br/>

&gt; First I&#39;d like to thank everyone on responding to my post, you&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; been a great help all of you. But I&#39;ve already spent a while camping<br/>
&gt; him. He&#39;s meant to span every 72-80 minutes? cause I&#39;d NEVER seen him<br/>
&gt; and i&#39;ve spent a couple of lvl&#39;s in there from 16-18 and now a while<br/>
&gt; there and he never seems to spawn! Also when you kill him does he<br/>
&gt; drop the humerus handled mace every time?<br/>
&gt; What about the other mobs? Can you provide information for them liek<br/>
&gt; the where they spawn and the times and lvl&#39;s etc? Cause I haven&#39;t<br/>
&gt; spent much time in misty or runneyeye.<br/>
&gt; Thanks again in advance,<br/>
