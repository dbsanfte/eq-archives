<b>Subject:</b> PLing a Monk <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-358425958">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I need some PLing info and I was hoping some of you could give me a <br/>
hand.  <br/>
<br/>
I have a irl friend has a monk that I am PLing atm with my level 52 <br/>
Shaman.  His monk is level 33 and is hunting in OT and the experience <br/>
is pretty darn good (Killing Tigers, Sarnak Knights and other <br/>
red /con mobs).  I am casting Str, Agi, Dex, Sta, Chloro, Guardian <br/>
(AC Buff), &#39;tuna (HP Buff), Alacrity, SoW and Burst of Str (Short <br/>
term Str buff that stacks with Str) on the Monk.  On the mob, I cast <br/>
an Melee debuff (-AC, -Str) and a Turgur&#39;s (Slow spell).  When the <br/>
mob gets less than half health, I send in my pet to help him kill the <br/>
mob.  I think I can get him to level 40 in the next few days.<br/>
<br/>
My question is:  Where can I take this Monk to level him from 40 - <br/>
50ish very fast?<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking of the Ice Giants outside of Perma.  They are level <br/>
38 - 42, they are a 6 min spawn but they have a lot of HPs, high AC <br/>
and do a ton of damage per hit.<br/>
<br/>
your friend,<br/>
