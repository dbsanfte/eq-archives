<b>Subject:</b> RE: Issues with the new damage. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1802013826">No.  Abashi was pretty much unequivocal that the monk haste effect will be<br/>
inherent.<br/>
Spell and item haste effects are separate and the haste cap is calculated AFTER<br/>
the<br/>
inherent monk haste effect (ie we can get below a 20 delay).<br/>
<br/>
I had also seen sugested somewhere that it is the number of attacks and type<br/>
that get<br/>
you noticed (note the rogue backstabs act as taunts even when they miss).<br/>
<br/>
Abashi had also stated and I don&#39;t think I disagree, that DEX does not help dual<br/>
wield<br/>
and double attack..  Just another &quot;urban myth.&quot;  I used to be a STR/DEX hound.<br/>
I used<br/>
to hang out with shamans all the time. However, I noticed that getting buffed by<br/>
druids<br/>
(storm str, woof form) did not have much of a negative effect on my damage<br/>
output (not<br/>
counting DS).  Considering that I had over a 200 DEX when buffed, I took that to<br/>
mean<br/>
that a high DEX just didn&#39;t do much for me.  STR has a fairly obvious role,<br/>
though it is<br/>
less important than I thought.  It only affects damage, but has no impact on the<br/>
to hit<br/>
role.  Oddly enough, Wolf form, which is an increase to ATK with no effect on<br/>
STR also<br/>
increases max damage.  Whether it affects the to hit role or not I don&#39;t know.<br/>
But I do<br/>
know that a 35+ increase in STR has a significant effect on damage output.  An<br/>
extra<br/>
2-3 hp/attack over the course of a fight really adds up.<br/>
<br/>
Each point of AGI is worth maybe 1/3 a point of AC or so.  According to Abashi,<br/>
AC is<br/>
made of 2 numbers.  Chance to get missed and chance to avoid damage.  AGI<br/>
affects<br/>
the latter only.  I&#39;ll take AC items any day.<br/>
<br/>
As far as paladin&#39;s are concerned, my impression is that against anything but<br/>
undead,<br/>
they are the weakest melee type class out there.  Until they get their fiery<br/>
avenger<br/>
that is 8).<br/>

<br/>
Here we go. Time to start another incident.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>by level 50.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe, how the delay is being changed, I don&#39;t know. If you re-read GA&#39;s<br/>
post you could take what he said as the delay cap for the fist is being<br/>
lowered, but the actual delay isn&#39;t. Possible translation: Augmentation,<br/>
Alacrity, and Haste Items will HELP YOU MORE, but your fist Delay MAY NOT<br/>
improve. Not a straight answer either way.<br/>
<br/>
None of your special attacks acts as a taunt, its _strictly_ damage based.<br/>
Monsters agro you based on the amount of damage you&#39;re doing, not the attack<br/>
doing the damage. (Referring to monk attacks only.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I recommend you all dump some of your dex and agi gear (keep agi above 120,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>but drop dex like a rock - detailed log studies show it is useless to us!)<br/>
and switch it out for AC stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Well, it should depend somewhat on whom you&#39;re grouping with. I have<br/>
personally been trying to up my dex, in an attempt to get my double attack<br/>
and dual wield to go off more (that&#39;s not so useless in my eyes). As for<br/>
dropping AGI, that gives you AC (at least it effects the number on the<br/>
screen, which isn&#39;t totally indicative of what&#39;s going on). As near as I can<br/>
tell, having a High AGI helps you when taking a hit, by lessening the amount<br/>
of damage you take. I get hit a lot less hard then some of the other party<br/>
members with a lower AGI. (Gotta love the Ranger who casts FLAC.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I know I am going to go in all AC gear from now on, concentrating on str as<br/>
 </span></blockquote>secondary.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sold on the STR gear. The ATK number is a hybrid like AC. Adding<br/>
another 5 points of str doesn&#39;t seem to help all that much compared to<br/>
another 5 pts of dex. Again, it seems that having another +5 str only gives<br/>
another five points of damage. I&#39;d rather spend the inventory spot on a dex<br/>
item that gives me another attack chance at a 30+ punch. Still, there is<br/>
much guess work here.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Just be prepared for a change in tactics and gear once the patch goes live.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Indeed! Its a good day for monks, and I&#39;m prepared to be healed a lot more.<br/>
I&#39;ve been playing with the same group of people of the past month or so, and<br/>
its been very interesting. I very rarely can get a monster&#39;s attention off<br/>
the Ranger with his dual SSOYs, but occasionally it does happen (good old<br/>
Flying Kick). I&#39;m already embarrassing the paladin (3 levels higher) on<br/>
damage to the point where she can rarely pull the mob off me (not counting<br/>
undead). I&#39;m very curious to see how this works out versus the ranger, post<br/>
patch. I&#39;m prepared to get some love from my clerics. ;)<br/>
