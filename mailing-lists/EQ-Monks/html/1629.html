<div id="ygrps-yiv-878570669">My guess would be he&#39;s smoking out people who are trying to pass around<br/>
copies of the password without paying, but that&#39;s just a guess. I mean if<br/>
he&#39;s dumb enough to put his email on this maybe he did forget his own<br/>
password.<br/>

So why does the person who originates all the email in the EQ-Cheats list,<br/>
and runs www.eqtotalsecrets.com need the password to his own site?<br/>

Please email me the password if you have it.  I want all the cool <br/>
info but I don&#39;t want to have to pay for it<br/>
<br/>
Thanks</div>
