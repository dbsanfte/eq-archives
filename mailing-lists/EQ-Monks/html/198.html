<div id="ygrps-yiv-239099748">I play on Test Server, and about clerics not being able to cast buffs, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s true. I had a cleric cast a Center and Spirit armor on me just last night and I wasn&#39;t grouped with her.  <br/>
<br/>
We have noticed buffs not lasting as long and have complained to the high heavens about that.  I just got FD, so I&#39;m still working with it.<br/>

    Well, one person has seen the effects since the last patch.  Please speak up and give stories if your having a tough time with it.<br/>
     <br/>
    I am just very curious if Verant made a change in the ability to FD without stating it.  I bet they would call this an &quot;ENHANCEMENT&quot; wouldn&#39;t they.<br/>
     <br/>
    Oh, and the durations of Buff spells really really dissapoints me.  I thought they were good as is before the patch.  Have to rebuff after ever other fight. Very annoying to the casters in my group.  <br/>

    Axlon hooks up his mana sieve to Jhessa   (Very lovely Barbarian Shaman that she is)<br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And one rumor I heard..is that Clerics can not cast buffs on ya unless you are grouped with them. Can anyone confirm this?<br/>
