&lt;&lt; Back to the twinking issue, I see one more factor:  My over developed sense<br/>
 of injustice.  If I had to work so hard to get what I have, what gives Mr.<br/>
 Twinkee the right to get everything handed to him? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 It&#39;s not a matter of &quot;Mr. Twinkie&quot; having the right &quot;to get everything <br/>
handed to him.&quot; The items go to who earned them, and it is their right to do <br/>
with them as they wish -- giving them to others, included.</div>
