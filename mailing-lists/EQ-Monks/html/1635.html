&gt; you lot can give me about it, so far I&#39;m feigning then instil doubt whilst<br/>
&gt; feigned and as soon as feign pops FD again then ID, rinse and repeat. Is<br/>
&gt; this the best way of doing it or are there better ways ?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I did most of my training of those skills on long boat rides, and waiting for<br/>
spawns.  I finally maxed ID in Level 30.  But, I&#39;ve let it fall behind.  IT<br/>
is even hard to get the 5 points per level without constantly pressing it.<br/>
But, it is an awesome skill for duels . . . nothing&#39;s funnier than sending your opponent out of the arena :)<br/>

&gt; also up until now i haven&#39;t really bothered using weapon at all (mucked<br/>
&gt; about with it and both 1hb and 2hb are at about 10) are there any cheap<br/>
&gt; weapons that i can pick up with low weight or are they all expensive things<br/>
&gt; like fighting batons and knuckle dusters ?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I used staffs to train myself up.  Just plain 1H staff.  You can buy them at<br/>
vendors (I bought mine in FV).  Then, since I was terrible at them (and they<br/>
were kinda heavy), I fought in High Keep till my skill was maxed.  In HK,<br/>
you almost never get into trouble, and there&#39;s almost always a Warrior or<br/>
Ranger taunting the heck out of the gobbies, so you don&#39;t have to worry about<br/>
your AC problems from being overweight.<br/>
<br/>
And Finally, for 2H blunt, shout around for a bamboo bo stick.  The stats are<br/>
terrible, so monks usually give them away.  I got mine for free, and I twinked<br/>
some green monk with it when I bought something better.  It weighs 1.0.</div>
