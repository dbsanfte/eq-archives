<div id="ygrps-yiv-1465754720">I am sending this to both lists in hopes that someone may be able to answer<br/>
my questions<br/>
<br/>
I am a newbie.  I have only been playing for a couple weeks.  I have<br/>
managed to work my Monk up to 10th level.  After reading the posts on both<br/>
lists, I have a few questions:<br/>
<br/>
1.  Do monks get better at resisting stun effects as they get higher in<br/>
level or is the idea just not to get hit?  IF there were a class that could<br/>
roll with the punches, I figured Monks would be it, followed closely by<br/>
warriors.<br/>
<br/>
2.  Do any of the higher level monk attacks include some sort of stun<br/>
ability?  Why should only warriors, ogres and trolls get a bash?  If not,<br/>
it would be nice if we did.  Some sort of Nerve strike or punch to stun an<br/>
opponent or some sort of Judo throw to knock them off balance.<br/>
<br/>
3.  Has anyone run into the following problem:  I was fighting downstairs<br/>
in Blackburrow.  Some high level weenie was having fun creating trains of<br/>
various levels of gnolls and pulling them into the rest area and then<br/>
standing back and watching us lower level characters live or die by our own<br/>
skills.  I was jumped by 4 elite gnoll guards and gave a good accounting of<br/>
myself before dieing.  I was a bit mad, but ran back to get my body.  To my<br/>
surpise, it wasn&#39;t there.  I was grouped with several people.  They said<br/>
they could see my body, but I couldn&#39;t.  I re-logeed and it was not there.<br/>
I consented to have someone loot my body.  They began to hadn me my things,<br/>
when another train arrived.  I managed to outrun the train and we both hot<br/>
footed it to the zone.  Lo and behold, there was my body, in front of the<br/>
zone line.  It had my remaining items.  What is going on? <br/>
<br/>
4.  Is there anyway to prevent a PC thief from picking your pockets? ( He<br/>
was a PC, because I wasn&#39;t allowed to attack him, even though he was my<br/>
current target.)  I see this as having a negative effect on my character.<br/>
If they can effect my character in a negative way, why can&#39;t I do the same<br/>
to them?  A quick kick or throw would end that problem.   I have a hard<br/>
time believing that some Shadowknight or Necro is going to stand there<br/>
while some little sneak thief makes off with their hard earned money or<br/>
items.  It wouldn&#39;t have been so bad if they hadn&#39;t taunted me about it and<br/>
then run off.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the help<br/>
