<div id="ygrps-yiv-143939438"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;From: James W Hooper &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:jhooper@...">jhooper@...</a>&gt;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;1.  Do monks get better at resisting stun effects as they get higher in<br/>
&gt;level or is the idea just not to get hit?  IF there were a class that could<br/>
&gt;roll with the punches, I figured Monks would be it, followed closely by<br/>
&gt;warriors.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not really. We get better, but so does the creatures. When you hit level 20 or something, go back in Blackburrow and see if they still stun you :-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;2.  Do any of the higher level monk attacks include some sort of stun<br/>
&gt;ability?  Why should only warriors, ogres and trolls get a bash?  If not,<br/>
&gt;it would be nice if we did.  Some sort of Nerve strike or punch to stun an<br/>
&gt;opponent or some sort of Judo throw to knock them off balance.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Agreed. We should have a stun attack. Some people are discussing other options, like a grab attack or something like that.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;3.  Has anyone run into the following problem:  I was fighting downstairs<br/>
&gt;in Blackburrow.  Some high level weenie was having fun creating trains of<br/>
&gt;various levels of gnolls and pulling them into the rest area and then<br/>
&gt;standing back and watching us lower level characters live or die by our own<br/>
&gt;skills.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is an offense, and (according to Everquest Rules) should not be tolerated. Use /report and then /petition.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I was jumped by 4 elite gnoll guards and gave a good accounting of<br/>
&gt;myself before dieing.  I was a bit mad, but ran back to get my body.  To my<br/>
&gt;surpise, it wasn&#39;t there.  I was grouped with several people.  They said<br/>
&gt;they could see my body, but I couldn&#39;t.  I re-logeed and it was not there.<br/>
&gt;I consented to have someone loot my body.  They began to hadn me my things,<br/>
&gt;when another train arrived.  I managed to outrun the train and we both hot<br/>
&gt;footed it to the zone.  Lo and behold, there was my body, in front of the<br/>
&gt;zone line.  It had my remaining items.  What is going on? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Blackburrow have a tendency to make corpses dissapear. I know lots of people who lost their corpes in BB due to this. They have /petition for it, but now response. Then a few days later, their corpes are suddenly found at the entrance of BB. My guess is that GM&#39;s regularly scoops up all corpses and dumps them at the entrace. Apparently corpses dissapears inside walls and other weird things.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, use the /corpse command if you know you are close to your corpse. That command will summon your corpse to your feet, if you are close enough.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;4.  Is there anyway to prevent a PC thief from picking your pockets? ( He<br/>
&gt;was a PC, because I wasn&#39;t allowed to attack him, even though he was my<br/>
&gt;current target.)  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He most certainly played a silly joke on you. Like this:<br/>
<br/>
/em steals an item from YOU!<br/>
<br/>
A good respons to this (old and boring joke) is:<br/>
<br/>
/em quickly grabs xxx&#39;s thieving arm and with a loud *snap*, breaks it...<br/>
<br/>
Or something.</div>
