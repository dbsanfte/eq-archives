<div id="ygrps-yiv-2078487352">I decided to give it one more go today. I get to Paw and find the room. I attack the commander out in front of the shaman&#39;s room and guess who comes charging out after me? None other than Phido himself. I switch focus to him and start pounding him, all the while the commander&#39;s taking free shots at me. I finally manage to kill Phido, but have a bubble of health left. I feign, wait a minute, loot Phido, collect Dareb&#39;s skull. bind my wounds, mend, and high tail it to Qeynos. Yes, there will be better headgear, but I&#39;m kinda proud of my red headband &lt;g&gt;<br/>

    Well after many hours in Paw, I have done this quest.  You just have to keep killing Ren&#39;Rexx eventually phido does spawn.... The other two heads come from Ghanex Drah who is a normal spawn, and the third comes from killing High Shaman Grisok who is a random spawn for Shaman Lenrel...<br/>
<br/>
    I got Ghanex Drah&#39;s head easily, it took around 7 hours (non-consecitvly) of fighting till I got the other two heads, as a coincidence both Grisok and Phido spawned at the same time (was killing all three in a circle)<br/>

    Hello, brothers and sisters... <br/>
<br/>
    Just spent a long, frustrating night in Paw trying to get the head of Dareb. <br/>
    I&#39;ve heard you get this item from High Shaman Phido, who is a rare spawn, <br/>
    who shows up in place of Shaman Ren&#39;Rexx on occasion. Well, I killed Ren&#39;Rex <br/>
    so many times I started feeling sorry for him &lt;g&gt;.  Does anyone know who to <br/>
    get the head of Dareb? After questing for the headband items for weeks, I <br/>
    don&#39;t feel bad about a spoiler at this point &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
    Thanks! <br/>
<br/>
