<b>Subject:</b> Re: Monk Armor and the short end of the stick <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1373233511">Thanks for all the thoughtful posts on the recent tweaking of warriors and <br/>
the resultant marginalization of monks. It disturbs me too, because I&#39;d <br/>
always heard and believed that monks were supposed to be the melee machines, <br/>
able to heap massive damage upon foes. And the price we paid was crappy hit <br/>
points, very few cool toys, bad armor, and a weight restriction. <br/>
 Now, however, warriors seem to do similar damage to us. At least at lvl 35, <br/>
that&#39;s what i&#39;ve seen. (Maybe past lvl 40, the balance shifts? I haven&#39;t been <br/>
there yet, so I can&#39;t say.) And with none of our weaknesses. Oh, sure, they <br/>
can&#39;t mend -- but so what? They have many more hp&#39;s than us to start; they <br/>
don&#39;t need a mend. And yes, we can fight with our bare hands -- big deal! <br/>
What warrior ever has to? What advantage is it to fight without weapons (or <br/>
to not need them), really? Monsters don&#39;t disarm!  It seems we pay a big <br/>
price for being monks, and as far as being useful to a party, don&#39;t get much <br/>
of a return. <br/>
 Sure, being a monk might offer unique possibilities  -- but being able to <br/>
jump from Kelethin bank only carries so much novelty... i&#39;d much prefer being <br/>
able to contribute something meaningful and unique to the game.<br/>
 Well, there&#39;s my rant on the subject. Sorry if it sounds a little bitter, <br/>
but I sometimes wonder why i&#39;ve put so much labor into a character (and <br/>
class) that Verant seems so willing to leave by the wayside...<br/>
