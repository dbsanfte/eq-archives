&gt;Ah, where to start?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;First, you don&#39;t make netted or mesh armor.  Certain critters drop it in<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;finished state.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Second, there is a rather plentiful supply of mesh/woven/netted fairly near<br/>
&gt;Freeport, but you have to travel through a fairly dangerous desert to get<br/>
&gt;there.  If you can find a guide through North Ro, Oasis, and South Ro, you<br/>
&gt;can get to the swamp where the froglocks roam.   These are the creatures<br/>
&gt;that drop netted and rarely some woven armor.  If you can find a decent<br/>
 </span></blockquote>spot<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;them, you can amass a good amount of netted in a short time.   Woven and<br/>
&gt;Mesh armor, while better, is found on higher level frogloks in the dungeon<br/>
&gt;of Guk, which is off of that swamp.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thirdly, the Qeynos sewers do have frogloks in them, but getting to Qeynos<br/>
&gt;from Freeport is pretty dangerous at your level (hey, no risk no reward,<br/>
&gt;right?).   If you have a good guide (preferably a druid), you should be<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;to make it, but it&#39;s a very long journey.   However, there are only 3,<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&#39;em, 3 froglocks in the sewers.  They are often camped by low level monks<br/>
 </span></blockquote>of<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;Qeynos, but just keep checking back until they are free.   Again, you&#39;ll<br/>
&gt;probably need a guide to show you exactly where in the sewers to hunt the<br/>
&gt;froggies.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The choice?   Getting to Qeynos is probably harder than getting to the area<br/>
&gt;around Guk, BUT once you get to Qeynos it&#39;s considerably safer hunting for<br/>
&gt;netted.  The sewers are a low level dungeon and not much will come after<br/>
&gt;you.   However, there the swamp has far more frogloks to kill so the netted<br/>
&gt;should come faster.   It&#39;s all about personal preference at that point.   I<br/>
&gt;personally would head to the swamp to hunt there, but some people like to<br/>
&gt;hunt near their bind points (you can be bound right outside the sewers,<br/>
&gt;whereas the swamp is four zones away from a city).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Of course, you can get this info from higher level monks on your server.<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve found monks to be pretty open to helping each other out.<br/>

&gt;&gt;Hail Brother&#39;s & Sisters,<br/>
&gt;&gt;Also, I am a Freeport monk, I hear much talk about the sewers of &gt;Qeynos<br/>
&gt;&gt;(think that is the place) But nothing of were to hunt for the &gt;creatures I<br/>
&gt;&gt;am looking for in my area. (Here is a VERY New&#39;b Q, If i &gt;do need to go to<br/>
&gt;&gt;Qeynos, how do i get there, by boat or try it &gt;overland?)<br/>
&gt;&gt;I thank you all in advance for your time.<br/>
