&gt; &gt; &gt;jump on monsters, yelling &quot;Mine!  Mine&quot;, like some 2 year old,<br/>
&gt; because they<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;need the XP or the items.  Do not make assupmtions about me.  I do<br/>
&gt; not take<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;for granted that I can buy serp bracers for 200pp or any of the<br/>
&gt; other<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;things.  Why?  Because I play this game for adventuring purposes.<br/>
&gt; At 17th<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;level, I figured that the 200 pp I had stashed away would last me<br/>
&gt; quite a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;while.  That is 200pp I earned the hard way.  No one gave it to<br/>
&gt; me.  It is<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Get off the cross, we need the wood.  99% of all players have gone<br/>
&gt; through<br/>
&gt; &gt;this.  And by the way, I didn&#39;t have my first 200 pp until I was well<br/>
&gt; into<br/>
&gt; &gt;my 20&#39;s.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; hahahaha good one, can i use this in future rants?  that get off the<br/>
&gt; cross<br/>
&gt; comment<br/>
&gt; would seem to apply to the first guy too, who thinks we owe him<br/>
&gt; respect for<br/>
&gt; some unknown reason.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;twinking that is one of the causes of the drop in prices for<br/>
&gt; items.  If<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Bull - absolute bull.  Twinkers aren&#39;t selling the items they&#39;re<br/>
&gt; wearing.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Lower prices, more supply.  Less Supply, higher prices.  Perhaps<br/>
&gt; you&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; &gt;heard of it?  The ole &quot;Supply and Demand&quot; theory.  I just can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; figure out<br/>
&gt; &gt;why a glowing stein is still selling for 250 pp on Quell.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; they&#39;re about 250 on veeshan too.  only thing i can figure out is that<br/>
&gt; those<br/>
&gt; damn enchanters are fixing prices, heh.  ahh more power to them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;shouldn&#39;t have to invest 9 months into a new character:  Why not?<br/>
&gt; Are you<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;afraid that you will get bored?  You already have intimate<br/>
&gt; knowledge of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;most of the areas of the world that you can use to your advantage.<br/>
&gt; Why<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;The fact that it was his 9 months and his items means he can do any<br/>
&gt; damn<br/>
&gt; &gt;thing he wants to.  Including, but not limited to, creating a Troll<br/>
&gt; &gt;Enchanter and trying to twink it&#39;s INT up to 500.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; hmm now there&#39;s a thought.  i can do the troll enchanter part, but i&#39;m<br/>
&gt; not sure<br/>
&gt; how to get his int up to 500 heh.  better go twink some more.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;should you add the capability of walking around with items that your<br/>
&gt; &gt;character would never have had to chance to obtain?  To be honest, I<br/>
&gt; do not<br/>
&gt; &gt;have a problem with a character getting a sword or a piece of armor<br/>
&gt; from<br/>
&gt; &gt;someone, even another of the PCs that a player owns..  There are<br/>
&gt; plenty of<br/>
&gt; &gt;historical and fantasy based accounts of this, but when someone steps<br/>
&gt; onto<br/>
&gt; &gt;the stage, a new character, decked out in itmes that should belong to<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt;10th level or 20th level or 30th level characters, it really cheeses<br/>
&gt; those<br/>
&gt; &gt;of us who are trying to earn the items legitimately.  Every item that<br/>
&gt; goes<br/>
&gt; &gt;into a twinkers hands, is one less that I or another honest player<br/>
&gt; can earn.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;BUZZ!!!!  Thank you for playing!  Except for the MASSIVELY rare<br/>
&gt; spawns,<br/>
&gt; &gt;there are several holes in your theory.  First, most of the<br/>
&gt; ultra-rare items<br/>
&gt; &gt;are on very very high level creatures.  So honest player #1 that is<br/>
&gt; level 18<br/>
&gt; &gt;- sorry, you would never legitimately get this item.  Secondly, most<br/>
&gt; of the<br/>
&gt; &gt;servers that have been around for a while... there&#39;s at least 2,000<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt;everything it seems, except as I said, the ultra rares, that honest<br/>
&gt; players<br/>
&gt; &gt;have no chance of getting while they&#39;re young.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; well to be honest there is a little bit of this going on.  i.e. when<br/>
&gt; was<br/>
&gt; the last time<br/>
&gt; a non caster got a kill on hadden for the fishbone earring heh.  and<br/>
&gt; stop<br/>
&gt; catering<br/>
&gt; to him by using &#39;&#39;honest&#39;&#39; incorrectly, heh.  twinking has nothing<br/>
&gt; whatsoever<br/>
&gt; to do with &#39;&#39;honesty&#39;&#39;.  look it up if you don&#39;t believe me. :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;Twink used to really mean something.  Now all it means is someone who<br/>
&gt; has<br/>
&gt; &gt;better stuff than you do.<br/>
