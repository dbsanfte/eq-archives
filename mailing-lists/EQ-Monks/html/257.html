&gt; Hey there,<br/>
&gt; Brother Kingdok here again. I received a /tell<br/>
&gt; yesterday from a concerned party on Erollisi Marr<br/>
&gt; asking the name of the greedy monk I spoke of<br/>
&gt; yesterday. I do not feel it is right to post his name<br/>
&gt; on the lits but if you are on Erollisi Marr and wish<br/>
&gt; to know his name, email me and I will tell you. I do<br/>
&gt; not wish people to bother him, that is why I didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; post his name. HE does have the right to be a jerk<br/>
&gt; even if i do not like it. So please ask only if you<br/>
&gt; wish to know his name in case you are ever in party<br/>
&gt; with him or have the chance to be. Please do not<br/>
&gt; harass him. I do not wish him ill, but I do understand<br/>
&gt; why people would want to know so that they would not<br/>
&gt; have the misfortune of having an evening spoiled by<br/>
&gt; his greed and poor sportsmanship.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; May truth guide you,<br/>
&gt; Brother Kingdok<br/>
