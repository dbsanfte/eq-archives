<div id="ygrps-yiv-1757008680">Okay so now you have me confused. are you complaining that you are RPing and<br/>
they are not or that you need to wirk to get to cash to buy this? it is your<br/>
choice to play how you want and thier choice to play as they wish. so what<br/>
are you really complaining about?<br/>

&gt; &gt;No I dont see a problem with this but if you wish to RP your monk maybe<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; &gt;should not buy anything but only use what items you loot yourself. this<br/>
way<br/>
&gt; &gt;you would not have to save up so much money. Another thoguht is that<br/>
those<br/>
&gt; &gt;bracers come off of a difficult Mob in Lguk. at level 16 you werent<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;supposed&quot; to have those. Back at level 16 when E-marr was still new and<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt;highest playes were only in there low 30&#39;s noone had those bracers.<br/>
People<br/>
&gt; &gt;on the server didnt even know where they came from. I Think I was wearing<br/>
&gt; &gt;woven still at that point. dont dispair because you dont have level 30<br/>
&gt; &gt;equipment at level 16. you will get it eventually.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&quot;Good things come to those monks who wait&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But the problem is that there are those at my level or close to it who<br/>
&gt; *can* afford this stuff.  Why, because they have been killing and looting<br/>
&gt; and I have been RPing.<br/>
