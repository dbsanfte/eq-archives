&gt;A monk is very fun in his teens.  Once you get past the 20s you<br/>
&gt;will find ver very few places you can solo, however.  By that time,<br/>
&gt;a mob that cons low blue will take out the best equipped monk<br/>
&gt;without much of a sweat.  You will also start seeing warriors or<br/>
&gt;other melee types wielding weapons that easily make them better<br/>
&gt;damagers than you. Rangers with dual ykeshas in their low 30s<br/>
&gt;are not uncommon and those weapons essentially do the same<br/>
&gt;damage as a 44th level monk.  Also at 30th level warriros get a<br/>
&gt;huge HP bonus.  You will see their ability to tank go up dramatically<br/>
&gt;where as we can barely take hits from higher level mobs.  But what<br/>
&gt;set us apart was feign death.  With that skill I feared no zone.  I<br/>
&gt;could go anywhere as I had a nice safety net.  Now that safety net<br/>
&gt;is gone.  <br/>

You have attained a level of experience that I may not obtain for months.<br/>
Please understand that this is based on my limited experience and opinion.<br/>
Prehaps those of us who haven&#39;t played under the old feign death, will find<br/>
other means to deal with the problems you listed.  No disrespect meant to<br/>
you or any of the others, but it sounds like feign death was a crutch.<br/>
Maybe at higher levels we need to learn to adjust our tactics and stop<br/>
meeting problems head on.  We should be thinking fighters.  Let the wariors<br/>
wade in and trade blows with the big bad guy.  Let the warriors take the<br/>
role of the tank, while we take the role of the Smart bomb.  We zero in on<br/>
a target and take them out clean and fast.  I agree that warrior based<br/>
classes and their weapons can do more damge than we can, per hit, but I<br/>
still think we hit more often.  They are also too dependent upon those<br/>
weapons for their abilites.  Everything we have is innate.  Let Verant<br/>
throw in a zone or two that magic doesn&#39;t work and see who is really the<br/>
true meele (sp?) master. Strip a warrior of his weapons and armor and you<br/>
have a target .  Strip us, and we are still deadly.  I think we just have<br/>
to adjust our purpose in the Verant universe<br/>
