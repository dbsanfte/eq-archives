<div id="ygrps-yiv-85062871">Najena was pretty good solo, same with Unrest, even though it was a pain <br/>
breaking up the undead from the others.  Forget guk or everfrost, second you <br/>
really beat something up, it runs and gets more.  That is why I liked <br/>
unrest, the dead didn&#39;t run as much.  Also gonna try Mistmoore Sooner or <br/>
later but I have never been there.  Birds in SK if you don&#39;t mind the crowd. <br/>
  I soloed a bit in Rathe Mnts, but I decided to hold that off till I was a <br/>
little higher level.  Anyway, that was my two cents  :)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hail all you experienced monks out there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What recommendations does everyone have for places to hunt solo by levels?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My character is only level 21, but here were his favorites so far&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Level	Area Hunted<br/>
&gt;1-4	Freeport<br/>
&gt;5-10	Rivervale (with runnyeye bead quest)<br/>
&gt;11-12	Black Burrow (with gnoll teeth quest)<br/>
&gt;13-16	Wisp island (gls quest, good money and exp!)<br/>
&gt;17-18	EK (gnoll reavers)<br/>
&gt;19-20	HH (gnolls solo and orcs in a group)<br/>
&gt;21-22?  Gorge hunting mino&#39;s<br/>
&gt;22+?	Not there yet............1 bubble to go!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The quests seem to really speed up the leveling.  Has anyone else found <br/>
&gt;that<br/>
&gt;to be true also?  Are they any good quests out there for experience once in<br/>
&gt;the twenties and beyond?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
