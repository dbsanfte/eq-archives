<div id="ygrps-yiv-2032979616">First: don&#39;t judge people too quickly Clarity, I know people with much<br/>
better equipment that cured silk at lvl 20, and I am SURE they did not twink<br/>
their character. Trading can be very efficient, especially on old servers<br/>
where some items are very cheap now.<br/>
Second: I think Shelza was speaking about that because Herrick said there<br/>
was nothing better than cured silk armor before planes, which is not true.<br/>
But I agree when you say he should not worry about that. You can be fine<br/>
with cured silk armor til level 30.<br/>

Shelza,<br/>

I&#39;m sorry, but what are you talking about?  Herrick is a level 12 monk<br/>
talking<br/>
about saving up scarab carapaces for 1.7gp each!  Do you think this guy has<br/>
30pp to go buy a bracer of erolisi? or 100pp to get a silver-plated bracer?<br/>
Please tell me what armor better than cured even a level 18 can go get?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just a little tired of people who are twinked telling new players what <br/>
they<br/>
should be wearing:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;oh, man, that cured hat sucks, go get a froglock crown&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There is a lot better stuff that Harrick can get, but he definitely <br/>
shouldn&#39;t worry<br/>
about it now.  He has to get to 30 or so first.<br/>
