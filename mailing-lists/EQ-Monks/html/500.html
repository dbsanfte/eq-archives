<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1118260761"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Depending on where you are Young Brother, the steep mountain walls outside<br/>
 </span></blockquote>of Freeport are good Safe Fall training spots (any steep wall could suffice<br/>
though).  I saw this tip posted on a monk board.<br/>
<br/>
I used the tunnel to North Ro in the East Commons for the bulk of my safe<br/>
fall training.  Ran around in a loop falling off the upper part of the<br/>
tunnel.  Worked very quickly.</div>
