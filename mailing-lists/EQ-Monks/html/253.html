&gt; <br/>
&gt; Fellow monks,<br/>
&gt; �<br/>
&gt; I need help.� I have lately lost interest in my monk and in the game<br/>
&gt; in general.� I hit lvl 16 about a month ago and have been stuck there<br/>
&gt; ever since.� About that time, I started playing less due to RL<br/>
&gt; commitments.� Even now, I can only play 2-3 hours at a time max.� I<br/>
&gt; have been hanging out around Freeport:� Commons, NRo, Oasis area.� I<br/>
&gt; even tried going to Faydward (sp?) and spending time there.� I just<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t get into it.� I think my biggest problem is it is SOOO hard to<br/>
&gt; find a good group.� I was grouped in the Oasis last week and had a<br/>
&gt; cleric who refused to heal during a battle, all he wanted to do was<br/>
&gt; beat on the MOBs.� This led to me dying 3 times in short succession.�<br/>
&gt; Also, what is more frustrating that running to the derv camp in W Comm<br/>
&gt; and trying to get into a group when there are already 2 groups camping<br/>
&gt; the place and they refuse to even acknowledge you by replying to a<br/>
&gt; simple /tell?� The only time I get an indication that they know I<br/>
&gt; exist is when one of their wizards keeps stealing MOBs from me.<br/>
&gt; �<br/>
&gt; I need some advice/encouragement on what to do for a couple of<br/>
&gt; levels!� I have tried starting a� necromancer, revisited a lvl 6<br/>
&gt; warrior, and started a cleric in this time also.� Problem is, this<br/>
&gt; game does not get interesting until lvl 8-10 or so (usually a caster&#39;s<br/>
&gt; 3 set of spells).� If you&#39;ve played one newbie class, you&#39;ve played<br/>
&gt; them all - and you have to invest SOOO much time to just get to a<br/>
&gt; level where each class starts getting interesting.<br/>
&gt; �<br/>
&gt; I really do like my monk and I realize that it starts getting better<br/>
&gt; after FD, but I am just in this funk and need some help getting<br/>
&gt; out.... </span></blockquote></div>
