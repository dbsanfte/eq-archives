&gt; &gt;I meant to say a spot that you&#39;d normally take damage from, if you didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt;have safe fall. :)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Depending on where you are Young Brother, the steep mountain walls outside<br/>
of Freeport are good Safe Fall training spots (any steep wall could suffice<br/>
though).  I saw this tip posted on a monk board.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Outside of FP, either in East Commons or North Ro, the mountains to the<br/>
side of the inner zones are great places to train that skill up.  You do not<br/>
need to take damage, just as long as you make that skipping sound as you<br/>
descend.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Find an almost sheer wall, back up all the way to the top then run down.<br/>
Every time you trip, you will up your chances for a skill increase.  Back up<br/>
to the top, then repeat.  I did this a few nights ago at the FP/NRo wall and<br/>
managed to get 45 skill increases in about 30 minutes...(now 112)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Use caution and make sure you do not jump off the top of the cliff (some<br/>
have flat spots at the top that you can launch from), I only did this to<br/>
train my Bind Wound, taking 275 DMG 2 times to lower my HPs (608 total).  If<br/>
you have less HPs, you could be doomed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You may even get some odd stares from passers-by like I did; &#39;What&#39;s that<br/>
Monk doing?&#39;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Safe training to you Brothers and Sisters.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
