&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Hail Fellow Monks<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I am a tailor of a good deal of experience and was<br/>
&gt; &gt; hoping that someone could answer a question for<br/>
&gt; me.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; hunt in East Commonlands and therefore tailoring<br/>
&gt; is a<br/>
&gt; &gt; simple skill to use because pelts are so common.<br/>
&gt; &gt; However, Patchwork has become too easy for me and<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; have done some research into Studded Leather.  As<br/>
&gt; most<br/>
&gt; &gt; of you know, making studded armor requires studs. <br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; do not wish to take the time to make studs because<br/>
&gt; &gt; what I like most about tailoring is I do not have<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; spend time doing it, I just kill animals and use<br/>
&gt; their<br/>
&gt; &gt; pelts.   Does anyone know if it is possible to buy<br/>
&gt; &gt; studs, or anyone on the Karana Server near<br/>
&gt; Freeport<br/>
&gt; &gt; who sells them.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you are pursuing making studded armor because of<br/>
&gt; the satisfaction of<br/>
&gt; having made your armor yourself I wish you good<br/>
&gt; fortune.  If you are making<br/>
&gt; it because you want either to upgrade your armor or<br/>
&gt; plan on selling it I am<br/>
&gt; afraid you will most likely be disappointed. <br/>
&gt; Studded armor unfortunately is<br/>
&gt; far to difficult to make for the amount of<br/>
&gt; protection it provides.  For the<br/>
&gt; studs you must find a talented blacksmith willing to<br/>
&gt; make them for you.  If<br/>
&gt; you can find one they will most likely be priced at<br/>
&gt; 1PP each.  If you can<br/>
&gt; find someone to make them for you I recommend<br/>
&gt; spending all you can to get as<br/>
&gt; many studs as possible.   Because of the difficulty<br/>
&gt; of studded armor you<br/>
&gt; will go though many, many studs on your way a suit<br/>
&gt; of armor.  Also, the<br/>
&gt; tailoring skill seems to improve very slowly after<br/>
&gt; you have reached an<br/>
&gt; ability of 26.  The other problem is that studded<br/>
&gt; armor does not provide as<br/>
&gt; good protection as other types of armor you could<br/>
&gt; find on the corpses of<br/>
&gt; certain creatures in Norrath.  But as I stated at<br/>
&gt; the beginning, if you are<br/>
&gt; able to make and wear a full suit of studded the<br/>
&gt; self satisfaction could be<br/>
&gt; well worth all other obstacles.<br/>
