<div id="ygrps-yiv-677094952">The way to increase your faction *is* to kill orcs for the Ashen Guild.<br/>
This has always been the case, even months ago when I knew a poor monk who<br/>
accidentally auto-attacked the guildmaster... numerous times!  (Actually it<br/>
was extremely funny to watch, since he died after one punch, and he kept<br/>
showing up for more... :-)  Anyway, the only way he was able to establish a<br/>
rapport with the guild again was to kill lots of orcs.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a Ashen Order monk by birth.  When I travelled to Qeynos I killed lots<br/>
of BlackBurrow gnolls and had no problem joining the Silent Fist.  I never<br/>
did the Tomer or Konem quests, I just showed up with a bunch of gnoll pelts<br/>
and was on my way.<br/>
<br/>
Of these things I am sure of... However, I don&#39;t know what kind of<br/>
difference your religious beliefs may have.  I&#39;m a believer in Quellious and<br/>
that may make some difference...<br/>

that they HAVE been starting to like me more, but, I am unsure as to why. I<br/>
believe it is because I&#39;ve been killed so many orcs lately. If anyone has<br/>
any ideas, they would be welcome.<br/>

&gt;The only possible workaround I see now, is to give the items for the later<br/>
 </span></blockquote>quests to a Freeport monk (one you create or another player) and have them<br/>
give you the resulting sash. However, I think the later sashes are no-drop,<br/>
no-trade, unlike the beginning sashes, which are Lore items, but can be<br/>
traded.<br/>
