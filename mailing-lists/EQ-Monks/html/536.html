<div id="ygrps-yiv-189962926">There is practically no use in NOT messing up you faction in Guk. eventually<br/>
you will want to go to Lguk and get some of the good monk stuff down there<br/>
and you have to kill live and dead froggies to get it not to mention the few<br/>
good monk items in Uguk (IE Mesh, silverplated bracers, collar of undead<br/>
protection). As soon as you kill one live froggie or one Mino in Lguk your<br/>
AOS to all live froggies in guk. By the time your High enought level to want<br/>
to go to Lguk alot you wont really have to worry about the froggies In Uguk<br/>
you can feign them easy get an invis etc.<br/>

&gt; If I were you, I&#39;d either buy it, or hunt the Qeynos sewers, because you&#39;d<br/>
&gt; probably be better off not messing your faction up with the Frogloks of<br/>
&gt; Guk...<br/>

&gt; &gt;Ah, where to start?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;First, you don&#39;t make netted or mesh armor.  Certain critters drop it in<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt;finished state.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Second, there is a rather plentiful supply of mesh/woven/netted fairly<br/>
near<br/>
&gt; &gt;Freeport, but you have to travel through a fairly dangerous desert to get<br/>
&gt; &gt;there.  If you can find a guide through North Ro, Oasis, and South Ro,<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; &gt;can get to the swamp where the froglocks roam.   These are the creatures<br/>
&gt; &gt;that drop netted and rarely some woven armor.  If you can find a decent<br/>
&gt; spot<br/>
&gt; &gt;them, you can amass a good amount of netted in a short time.   Woven and<br/>
&gt; &gt;Mesh armor, while better, is found on higher level frogloks in the<br/>
dungeon<br/>
&gt; &gt;of Guk, which is off of that swamp.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Thirdly, the Qeynos sewers do have frogloks in them, but getting to<br/>
Qeynos<br/>
&gt; &gt;from Freeport is pretty dangerous at your level (hey, no risk no reward,<br/>
&gt; &gt;right?).   If you have a good guide (preferably a druid), you should be<br/>
&gt; able<br/>
&gt; &gt;to make it, but it&#39;s a very long journey.   However, there are only 3,<br/>
&gt; count<br/>
&gt; &gt;&#39;em, 3 froglocks in the sewers.  They are often camped by low level monks<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt;Qeynos, but just keep checking back until they are free.   Again, you&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; &gt;probably need a guide to show you exactly where in the sewers to hunt the<br/>
&gt; &gt;froggies.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;The choice?   Getting to Qeynos is probably harder than getting to the<br/>
area<br/>
&gt; &gt;around Guk, BUT once you get to Qeynos it&#39;s considerably safer hunting<br/>
for<br/>
&gt; &gt;netted.  The sewers are a low level dungeon and not much will come after<br/>
&gt; &gt;you.   However, there the swamp has far more frogloks to kill so the<br/>
netted<br/>
&gt; &gt;should come faster.   It&#39;s all about personal preference at that point.<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; &gt;personally would head to the swamp to hunt there, but some people like to<br/>
&gt; &gt;hunt near their bind points (you can be bound right outside the sewers,<br/>
&gt; &gt;whereas the swamp is four zones away from a city).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Of course, you can get this info from higher level monks on your server.<br/>
&gt; &gt;I&#39;ve found monks to be pretty open to helping each other out.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt;Hail Brother&#39;s & Sisters,<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;Also, I am a Freeport monk, I hear much talk about the sewers of &gt;Qeynos<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;(think that is the place) But nothing of were to hunt for the &gt;creatures<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;am looking for in my area. (Here is a VERY New&#39;b Q, If i &gt;do need to go<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;Qeynos, how do i get there, by boat or try it &gt;overland?)<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;I thank you all in advance for your time.<br/>
