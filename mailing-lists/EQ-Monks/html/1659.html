<div id="ygrps-yiv-1672140276">Here is todays patch message<br/>
<br/>
April 17th, 3:00 am<br/>
------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
** Food Changes **<br/>
<br/>
- Food items now have a &#39;duration&#39;.  This means that some food items will<br/>
not sustain a character as long as others, and some items will sustain your<br/>
character longer than they did before.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
** Bug Fixes **<br/>
<br/>
- We THINK we&#39;ve fixed the problem with the Dusty Werebat.  This fellow has<br/>
been steadfastly refusing to appear where and when we ask him to.  We&#39;ve<br/>
worked out a deal with his agent, and we think he&#39;ll be back to work with<br/>
this patch.<br/>
<br/>
- Corrected an anomaly with hit point bars that occurred when a character<br/>
was healed or damaged by spells.  This could be seen, for example, when a<br/>
character was healed and the hit point bar would go up and then quickly go<br/>
back down a bit right afterwards.  There was no error in the assignment of<br/>
healing or damage previously, just in the way it was being displayed.<br/>
<br/>
- Fixed the visual bracer bug where other people would see a different<br/>
bracer graphic than you would.  Now everyone (including the wearer) will<br/>
always see the same bracer texture.  If you have two bracers that have a<br/>
different look (one is leather and one is steel, for example), make sure<br/>
that the one you want to show up graphically is on your right wrist<br/>
inventory slot, because this is the one that the game will choose to show<br/>
for you (unless you take off the left one and put it back on, which will<br/>
show the left one, but that is only temporary, and it will go back to<br/>
showing the right one after you zone or reenter the game).<br/>
<br/>
- Fixed zoning problem in Nurga to Droga that caused characters to be facing<br/>
the wrong way when they zoned, often causing confusion that lead to<br/>
accidentally zoning back the way they had come.  You should be facing the<br/>
right way when you make that zone transition now.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
** Zone and Quest Changes **<br/>
<br/>
- The marauding Tar Goos will no longer be assisted by the Geonids. This<br/>
should make at least one quest more available.<br/>
<br/>
- Grobb should now have a couple of ovens.  Hopefully this will allow Troll<br/>
bakers to keep their fellows full of carbs and ready to fight.<br/>
<br/>
- Fixed a bug that occurred when selling stacks of items.  Previously, if<br/>
you had 4 bat wings and sold them one by one to the merchant, the merchant<br/>
would have 4 bat wings for you to buy, but if you sold all four at once to<br/>
the merchant he would only have one for you to buy.  Now he will have 4 in<br/>
either case.<br/>
<br/>
- We have increased the spawn rate of Venril Sathir and his skeletal<br/>
remains.  Please note that only Rangers and Druids will be able to trigger<br/>
the spawn for the skeletal remains, and those remains will only be dropping<br/>
items for those epic quests.  Hopefully these changes will dramatically<br/>
reduce the competition and resentment over this spawn.<br/>
<br/>
- We have reduced resistances to some spell types on some NPCs in Sky Shrine<br/>
and the Tower of Frozen Shadow.  This is the beginning of our overview of<br/>
the resistances of NPCs in Velious.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
** Improved and New Features **<br/>
<br/>
- When you /consent someone it will give them the ability to drag all of<br/>
your corpses.<br/>
<br/>
- You can now buy stacks of combinable items (such as rations, water,<br/>
etc...) from merchants.  It works the same way as sell in that you can hold<br/>
down shift to buy a full stack and control to buy just one item.<br/>
<br/>
- Added the ability to change the color of all windows at one time with<br/>
/wincolor (all windows that can be changed, that is).  You can now use<br/>
/wincolor ALL 0 0 100 2, for example, instead of having to set each window<br/>
separately.<br/>
<br/>
- Right-clicking items while looting will &#39;auto-equip&#39; them.  This will work<br/>
just as if you had picked the items up and dropped them onto the<br/>
&#39;auto-equip&#39; area of your character profile.  So if there is already a piece<br/>
of equipment on your character in the spot where the looted item would<br/>
normally go, it will drop into your inventory, if you have room for it.<br/>
<br/>
- The tab key will no longer toggle between you and your last target when<br/>
the chat bar is up.  When the chat bar is open the tab key will take you<br/>
through the list of your most recent /tell names or /reply names.  When the<br/>
chat bar is closed the tab key will switch you between yourself and your<br/>
last target.<br/>
<br/>
- /assist has an added parameter.  /assist on and /assist off will determine<br/>
whether or not your character auto-attacks when you use /assist.  So if you<br/>
type /assist off, from that time forward using /assist will NOT engage your<br/>
character&#39;s auto-attack.  This change will be persistent, so it will remain<br/>
as you left it when you log out.  /assist also now has a range of 200 feet.<br/>
<br/>
- The destroy confirmation requestor now shows the name of the item you are<br/>
trying to destroy, or it just says money if you are destroying coins.  This<br/>
should greatly reduce the chance of accidentally deleting the wrong item.<br/>
PLEASE read the text in the destroy confirmation box to be certain that you<br/>
are destroying the right item before choosing to destroy it.<br/>
<br/>
- Hailing Player Character will now say &#39;Hail Playername&#39;, rather than just<br/>
&#39;hail&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
- Added /charinfo command.  Currently this command only reports the zone<br/>
where the current character is bound.  We may add further information as<br/>
things progress.<br/>
<br/>
- You will now see how much damage your character has taken when he is hit<br/>
by a spell that causes instant damage (DOT damage is not reported).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
** Item Changes **<br/>
<br/>
- We&#39;ve made a change to the Red Scabbard that should relieve most of the<br/>
problems warriors were having with their epic weapon occasionally<br/>
disappearing during conversion between the two-handed weapon and the two<br/>
one-handed weapons.  What will happen now is rather simple.  The very next<br/>
time you use the container to combine the weapons (or break them apart), the<br/>
old scabbard will disappear and a new one will replace it.<br/>
<br/>
THE NEW SCABBARD AND THE SWORDS WILL APPEAR ON YOUR CURSOR, rather than in<br/>
your inventory.  So once you have combined them, make sure to place them in<br/>
your inventory.  And don&#39;t panic, the items didn&#39;t disappear.  :)  But also<br/>
MAKE CERTAIN THAT YOU HAVE ROOM IN YOUR INVENTORY FOR ALL THREE ITEMS (the<br/>
two swords and the scabbard, which is a container and needs to be able to<br/>
fit into your main inventory).  If you end up with a No-Drop container on<br/>
your cursor with no place to put it in your inventory, you will have a<br/>
problem...<br/>
<br/>
Also, right now the new scabbard is a little bugged.  Right now you won&#39;t be<br/>
able to open the new scabbard until you camp out once after it is created.<br/>
We&#39;re working on fixing that bug.  We decided to make this change even with<br/>
this small bug to help relieve everyone of the problems with the old<br/>
scabbard.<br/>
<br/>
This new scabbard will have a special ability.  It will be able to recreate<br/>
the epic weapons if you have lost them.  Simply place a Sword of Runes<br/>
(summoned by a Magician) into the scabbard and hit the combine button.  The<br/>
scabbard will convert the temporary power of the Sword of Runes into the<br/>
permanent epic sword.<br/>
<br/>
Customer Service WILL NOT be replacing the old scabbards with the new ones.<br/>
That will be done by the game itself once you have completed the quest and<br/>
combined the swords for the first time.<br/>
<br/>
- Changed the size of the Weighted Axe from Tiny to Large (after all, it&#39;s a<br/>
big two-handed axe...).  If you have one in a bag now, be aware that it<br/>
probably won&#39;t fit back into that bag again once you take it out.<br/>
<br/>
- No Rent Items will no longer be immediately deleted from your character<br/>
inventory upon disconnection with the server.  If you are disconnected from<br/>
the servers, or even if you log out, your No Rent items (such as summoned<br/>
food and water) will remain on your character as long as you log back to<br/>
that character within 30 minutes.  After thirty minutes those No Rent items<br/>
will be deleted.  There may be some extreme cases beyond our control (such<br/>
as hardware failures) where No Rent items will not be on your character even<br/>
if you log back in within the 30 minute timeframe.  No reimbursement will be<br/>
given for No Rent items lost in this manner.<br/>
<br/>
- Grand Master Wrist Wraps have been fixed and should now create the &quot;Pouch<br/>
of Quellios&quot; as intended.  If you have one of these items and it still does<br/>
not work, please contact a GM using /petition and ask them to switch yours<br/>
for a new one.<br/>
<br/>
- Snow Storm Mask should now function properly.<br/>
<br/>
- The Ring of the Frozen Flame should now be working properly.<br/>
<br/>
- The slow effect on the Willsapper proc has been reduced.<br/>
<br/>
- The weight of Skewers has been increase to a weight of 3.<br/>
<br/>
- Velious Monk armor appearances have been changed.  If you&#39;re wearing these<br/>
items, you probably already noticed this, but we thought we&#39;d announce it<br/>
anyway.  New textures will be showing on the Plane of Growth dropped armors<br/>
and on the questable armors.  Because the Velious textures can be a strain<br/>
on some systems, the textures for these new armors will not be loaded by<br/>
default by the game.  If you want to see the new textures you will have to<br/>
edit your EQClient.ini and change the line LoadArmor23=FALSE (the default)<br/>
to LoadArmor23=TRUE.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
** Trade Skill Changes **<br/>
<br/>
- Bards that worship Sol Ro will now be able to wear the Imbued jewelry made<br/>
for their god.  For those that not only sing around the campfire, but sing<br/>
about the campfire!<br/>
<br/>
- &#39;World&#39; Trade Containers (those that are stationary) have been fixed.<br/>
Previously when a character tried to combine items in a world container that<br/>
did not match a recipe, the items would seem to disappear.  But if the<br/>
character closed and reopened the container, the items were still in it.<br/>
Those items should no longer seem to disappear.<br/>
<br/>
- The speed of Selo&#39;s Song of Travel, the effect of the Singing Steel<br/>
Chestplate has been increased a little.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
** Spell Changes **<br/>
<br/>
- Removed Gem component from the following spells. They will now only<br/>
require the metal components. These are the Enchant spells for making<br/>
cultural armor.<br/>
<br/>
Enchant Velium<br/>
Enchant Mithril<br/>
Enchant Adamantite<br/>
Enchant Steel<br/>
Enchant Brellium<br/>
<br/>
- Changed the spell component for the following Magician spells from Lapis<br/>
Lazuli to Malachite.  They now use the same reagent as every other Magician<br/>
pet spell.<br/>
<br/>
Minor Summoning: Earth<br/>
Minor Summoning: Water<br/>
Minor Summoning: Fire<br/>
Minor Summoning: Air<br/>
Elemental: Earth<br/>
Elemental: Water<br/>
Elemental: Fire<br/>
Elemental: Air<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Added Casting Text to the Following spells (the messages in brackets will<br/>
now appear upon a successful use of the spell):<br/>
<br/>
Panic Animal (soandso flees in a state of total panic!)<br/>
Terrorize Animal (soandso runs away in terror!)<br/>
Repulse Animal (soandso is utterly repulsed!)<br/>
Acumen (soandso&#39;s eyes tingle)<br/>
<br/>
- Cannibalize IV now exists.  This spell is now available in Velious.<br/>
<br/>
- Cannibalize II and III have had their effects improved.  They now return<br/>
more mana to the caster than they did before.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
** Class Specific Changes **<br/>
<br/>
- Monk weight allowance has been increased.  Every 15 levels monks will get<br/>
an extra 1 stone weight allowance.  The post 50 weight allowance has also<br/>
been increased by 2 stone.<br/>
<br/>
Level 15, Limit 15<br/>
Level 30, Limit 16<br/>
Level 45, Limit 17<br/>
Level 51, Limit 18<br/>
Level 55, Limit 20<br/>
Level 60, Limit 24<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Disarmed traps will remain disarmed for a somewhat longer time than before<br/>
to allow larger groups to get past the traps before they go off.</div>
