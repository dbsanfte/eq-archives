As I said, the alchemist and his place holders (including Mooto) in Misty<br/>
are wanderers, and go to other camps, and the one you are talking about is<br/>
their first goal. You may have intercept them while they were wandering. But<br/>
I am sure that the spawns are every 20 minutes, and it is not only Mooto,<br/>
but also a warrior or a shaman so you may have missed some place holders.<br/>
I have never seen a place holder in the gorge outside the 72-85 min range.<br/>
You have to be very careful, because if people are fighting next to the<br/>
zone, it can be very difficult to see the exact spawns and when they are<br/>
killed.<br/>
Of course, everything I say is true if they have not changed anything about<br/>
the spawns. I have not read anything about it on the message boards, so I<br/>
think it is still true.<br/>

Hmm Maybe they moved the spawn in Misty.  When I got the alchemist there (<br/>
after<br/>
about 2 hours of camping) I was at the camp right next to the running eye<br/>
zone,<br/>
and the alchemist spawned right ontop of me.  Also my experience there was<br/>
that<br/>
mooto spawned only every hour or so<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I never moved to any of the otehr goblin camps.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As far as your info on the Gorge spawn goes.  It conforms to my experience. <br/>
Only thing I would add is that the 72-80 minte spawn seems to have a much<br/>
wider<br/>
range than that - sometimes you wont get a double spawn for more than 2<br/>
hours.<br/>
<br/>
I did the quest when I was levle 19, about 3 weeks ago.  Maybe your info is<br/>
more<br/>
recent. i dont know.</div>
