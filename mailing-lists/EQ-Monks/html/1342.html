&gt; Does anyone know what factors are used when someone cons an NPC?  Is<br/>
&gt; it<br/>
&gt; just the level or their other factors involved?  It seems to me that<br/>
&gt; only<br/>
&gt; levels are used to determine how any given NPC compares to a PC.  If<br/>
&gt; PCs<br/>
&gt; level is represented as X and an NPcs level is represented by Y.  If<br/>
&gt; X=Y<br/>
&gt; then the NPc is Black/White to the PC.  If X&gt;Y the Npc is green or<br/>
&gt; blue<br/>
&gt; depending by how much X&gt;Y.  If X&lt;Y then the NPc is yellow or red<br/>
&gt; depending<br/>
&gt; on how much X&lt;Y.  If Verant wanted to really cut down on Twinking,<br/>
&gt; they<br/>
&gt; could factor in  persons magic items, AC, buffs etc..  The PC may be X<br/>
&gt; level, but with items and buffs they are in a situation where their<br/>
&gt; relative power level (Z) places them in X&gt;Y by a wide margin.  This<br/>
&gt; allows<br/>
&gt; them to breeze through levels much easier than their non-twinked<br/>
&gt; counterparts.   &quot;Oh, look, here comes Fippy.  He cons red to me at 2nd<br/>
&gt; level, but because I am twinked, I can take him with ease and get lots<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; XP.&quot;  If the cons and XP given  were based on the power level of the<br/>
&gt; PC,<br/>
&gt; then the powergamers and twinkers would have to make a choice:  Do<br/>
&gt; they<br/>
&gt; keep the really kewl stuff meant for higher level characters or do<br/>
&gt; they<br/>
&gt; place the items in sotrage in order to level to the point where their<br/>
&gt; items<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t matter as much?  &quot;I am a 5th level monk with a Vox and a<br/>
&gt; Serpentine<br/>
&gt; bracer, split paw gloves, etc...  I can kill anything in this zone,<br/>
&gt; but I<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t get any XP.&quot;  (This e-mail was in response to a 5th level monk I<br/>
&gt; saw<br/>
&gt; in the Queynos hills who did have a Serpentine and a Vox bracer among<br/>
&gt; high<br/>
&gt; level items.)  It would solve some problems, I think.  Just my 2 cents<br/>
&gt; worth.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Let me tell you a few things.<br/>
<br/>
Monks are without any doubt the MOST difficult class in the game to<br/>
twink.  Equipment is not very helpful for us.  The only thing that would<br/>
really help at low levels is AC and hit points.  Getting an additional<br/>
10 hit points at level 1 gives you about 20% more hp.  AC isn&#39;t that<br/>
important anyway unless you do some MAJOR AC twinking.  For example,<br/>
that serp bracer would be worthless to a level 5 character.  The would<br/>
have an EXTREMELY minimal advantage over a monk with full cloth.<br/>
<br/>
Just my thoughts... I had a friend who twinked his monk, level 1 he had<br/>
2 serp bracers, azure sleeves, foremans, wolf fur slippers, jagged<br/>
bands.  Still died just as often as without the stuff.<br/>
