<div id="ygrps-yiv-1459518352">Interesting.  I assume people who are not consumed with haggling down<br/>
to the last cp, screwing you over, or obsessing over trade values are<br/>
the stupid people?  Ever thought that people may have been stupid<br/>
because they liked you, were in a hurry, or much preferred the item<br/>
you had to trade?<br/>
<br/>
No big deal, just the expression annoyed me.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;Show how little you know.  Never had an item given to<br/>
&gt;me in my life.  earned every one of them.  some things<br/>
&gt;I really lucked out on.  won a lizzie cloak in a lotto<br/>
&gt;and then traded it for werewolf.  Got some other<br/>
&gt;things for extremely low prices from stupid people =)<br/>
