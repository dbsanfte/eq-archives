<div id="ygrps-yiv-1267465844">You know, I don&#39;t usually get into flaming, but this post is kinda dumb.<br/>
<br/>
I made it to higher levels with my druid (and no, it wasn&#39;t by kiting.  I<br/>
was a druid when people didn&#39;t even know what a druid could do) and then<br/>
everyone suddenly decided to become druids.  Well, I can&#39;t stand being<br/>
commonplace.  So I switched characters.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I had something like 9,000pp in the bank and some weapons I&#39;d collected<br/>
in my playing time.  I wanted to start a bard.  Contrary to the beliefs of<br/>
newbies, the fun in this game is NOT in scratching for money, and saving for<br/>
every little thing.  That&#39;s too much like real life to be fun.  I much<br/>
prefer to not have to worry about my equipment or where I should be hunting<br/>
for maximum profit.  With those things out of the way, I can relax and have<br/>
fun hunting with new friends without worrying about silly things.  This game<br/>
gets to be the most fun AFTER level 20, not before.<br/>
<br/>
So, it was a natural conclusion to me to buy steel plate for my bard.  I got<br/>
her that plate and a thulian claw and a pgt.  Serious twinking?  Sure.  Does<br/>
it affect anyone else?  NO.  I got those items when I was the appropriate<br/>
level with my druid.  So be quiet already.<br/>
<br/>
You know what I&#39;ve noticed?  The only people who have a problem with<br/>
twinking are the people who twink without the resources to do it well.  I<br/>
can&#39;t count the number of times some level 5 warrior in full bronze has<br/>
called me a twink and sneered at me.  Hello?  Ok, I&#39;ll write them off as<br/>
stupid.  Do I write you off that way, too?<br/>

&gt; well well well...what have i *hic* started.  Sems two me dat a slite<br/>
&gt; debate be goin on while i be away.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m going to steer from my whole drunk arguement and go talk normal so<br/>
&gt; every here can be understanding of what i have to say.  That whole MY<br/>
&gt; GAME, MY MONEY agruement is old and just an exscuse for someone to say<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;screw you....i don&#39;t care what you think...i&#39;ll do what I want and I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t care about anyone else&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; thats what the whole MY MONEY, MY GAME arguement means...and if you<br/>
&gt; disagree with that you are wrong.  The whole reason people say that is so<br/>
&gt; they can justify what ever they do even when they are wrong.  This is a<br/>
&gt; roleplaying game with many many people playing at one time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A massive multiplayer game right?  Massively Multiplayer.....i think<br/>
&gt; everyone can agree with that.  And wheather or not you realize it<br/>
&gt; everything you do has an effect on the other people who play the game.<br/>
&gt; Every orc pawn you kill, every foraged piece of food you drop...it all has<br/>
&gt; an effect on the other people on the server.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now that we have that understood....lets talk about twinking.  Everytime<br/>
&gt; you twink you take something away from someone who is at the right level<br/>
&gt; to have that item.  At 19 or 17 or 22 or whatever level he was...he took<br/>
&gt; away an executioners hood from some 45th+ level character.  He took the<br/>
&gt; serpentine bracers away from some 40th+ level character who deserved it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And it&#39;s not the fact that he can go and get another one...it&#39;s the fact<br/>
&gt; that he is just going to have to wait that much longer because there is<br/>
&gt; some chump monk who can&#39;t earn his own equipment...he has to have older<br/>
&gt; friends help him out or just use his own older character to get things for<br/>
&gt; him cause he can&#39;t play the game like it was meant to be played.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I hate twinking and i hate twinkers because you take things away from<br/>
&gt; people who rightfully deserve those items.  I don&#39;t care if your 48th<br/>
&gt; level kill stealing wizard had to shoot down the hopes of a group of 45th<br/>
&gt; levels to get the item....you still took it from them and gave it to<br/>
&gt; someone who is 1/2 their age...maybe younger.  Everytime you twink an item<br/>
&gt; you screw someone who REALLY AND TRULEY DESERVES THE ITEM.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think the one thing that people don&#39;t realize about this game and any<br/>
&gt; other game is that it is everyones responsibility to provide a roleplaying<br/>
&gt; environment.  it is EVERYONES responsibility to PROVIDE a ROLEPLAYING<br/>
&gt; ENVIRONMENT....it is a massively multiplayer roleplaying game after<br/>
&gt; all.....<br/>
