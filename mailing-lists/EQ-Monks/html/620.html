&gt;I have to agree with Praelor.  I don&#39;t know *why* twinking bothers me.  I<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t deny it is perhaps partial jealousy.  Hell yes I would like level 40+<br/>
&gt;armor to start out with!  I&#39;m level 20 and I&#39;d take it now!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But I think what really gets me is the unfair (And it is) advantage that the<br/>
&gt;twinkers get over a non-twinked same level person.  Now perhaps that the<br/>
&gt;advantage is more of a psycological thing.. i.e. I *think* they have a<br/>
&gt;better chance than me.  But I feel that if I&#39;m standing beside a level 20<br/>
&gt;monk with high level gear and me with my low level gear, I feel like the<br/>
&gt;monk is going to be able to fight better and for longer without downtime<br/>
&gt;because of his ill gotten gear.  I haven&#39;t seen any &quot;studies&quot; to back up my<br/>
&gt;feelings, but it just makes sense to me :)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The only time this affects you is if you are competing for the same spawns.<br/>
And if this is the case then that means there aren&#39;t enough spawns in that<br/>
particular spot and maybe it&#39;s time to move on.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;And I don&#39;t want to open the &quot;If you want better gear go get it&quot; can of<br/>
&gt;worms.  I get the best that me and my group can get.  In a group of 10-12<br/>
&gt;people, we have to balance out quest items - it&#39;s only fair.  So that is not<br/>
&gt;an option, so to speak.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe you need to go find a better group of people :-).  I&#39;ve been clearing<br/>
maybe 30 plat a night since level 23 (4-6 hours of play).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;Simple solution (And I like it no matter what anyone says)  Make gear start<br/>
&gt;to have a level requirement.  If that &quot;Glowing Baseball cap of Might&quot; comes<br/>
&gt;from a level 40 MoB, then only a level 35+ can wear it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well since you won&#39;t change your opinion then i guess I won&#39;t even bother<br/>
to point out the flaws in this.<br/>

&gt;I think the thing that bothers me the most about EQ is the money situation.<br/>
&gt;The greed factor has almost turned it into a UO-type situation.  I realize<br/>
&gt;this is a total tangent, but how many of you have actually had to turn OFF<br/>
&gt;the auction channel on a non-bazaar day?  I hate it.  I hate greed.  I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;level 20 and I have 15 pp to my name.  But that&#39;s just me and I could be<br/>
&gt;stupid :)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Never played UO.  Hmm, capitalism is based on greed.  I suppose you don&#39;t<br/>
like free market economics.  Maybe you&#39;d rather that EQ had a communist<br/>
form of economics.  Like i said, I have never had money problems.  My main<br/>
character is a bard, and I was doing merchanting in various zones that weren&#39;t<br/>
that close to a town.  Every week or so now, I&#39;m making and blowing thru about<br/>
300-400 plat.  Level 27 and have 500+ plat in bank currently.  Are you not<br/>
looting<br/>
in your regular group?  Or are you stuck in the mass of campers that is oasis<br/>
killing crocs and caimans for no dough?<br/>

&gt;Back to the twinking issue, I see one more factor:  My over developed sense<br/>
&gt;of injustice.  If I had to work so hard to get what I have, what gives Mr.<br/>
&gt;Twinkee the right to get everything handed to him?  Actually, now that I<br/>
&gt;think about it, it is the sense of injustice.  Jealousy is just a mitigating<br/>
&gt;factor :)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Man, that&#39;s life.  That&#39;s part of a free market economy.  There are some<br/>
people<br/>
that have a lot and some people that don&#39;t.  What gives the Kennedies the<br/>
right<br/>
to have a lot of money and all the benefits that go along with that while<br/>
Joe Blow<br/>
is working the counter at Mcdonalds?<br/>
