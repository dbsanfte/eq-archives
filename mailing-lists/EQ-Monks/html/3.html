<div id="ygrps-yiv-238428334">Depending on your level you could go kill froglocks in the sewer and get a <br/>
set of netted off of them.  I dont know how long it would take to get a pair <br/>
of gloves off them as the loot spawn is random, but they are found on <br/>
Froglocks.  I also don&#39;t know what they sell for in Queyons as I&#39;m from the <br/>
Freeport area and I run to Guk for netted, woven and mesh armor.   A glove of <br/>
any of those will work as a magic glove. <br/>
