<div id="ygrps-yiv-1225482737">Hi there!<br/>
<br/>
I made level 15 last night, and am currently based around Freeport.<br/>
<br/>
I started out in Qeynos, but at around level 8 wanted to upgrade to<br/>
Netted/Woven/Mesh armour, and having had no luck finding Netted in the<br/>
sewers headed out for Freeport.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, once in Freeport I started grouping and have now found a group of<br/>
around 10 people who always play at the same time, so we tend to group<br/>
together -- much more fun when you have a consistent group.<br/>
<br/>
We levelled our way up from 8 to 15 in the East and West Commonlands, now<br/>
lots of things are /con&#39;ing green to us, so we need to move on. Only problem<br/>
is we are all new to EQ so have no real ideas as to where to go.<br/>
<br/>
We did try Crocodile hunting in Oasis last night but the spawn rate seemed<br/>
very low - certainly too low to support the 45 people in the zone.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have any suggestions as to where to go?<br/>
<br/>
Also, what level to we need to be to get Mesh? I have an almost complete set<br/>
of Woven (obtained by a combination of purchasing and hunting Frogloks and<br/>
Kobolds in Innothule) but have never seen Mesh for sale. I play on The<br/>
Tribunal server, so there arent that many high level characters who hunt in<br/>
Guk and then sell their stuff.<br/>
<br/>
As for weight -- Spirit Pouches! One of the people I regularly group with is<br/>
a Shaman, so when we start I get him to summon me some pouches, fabulous<br/>
items!<br/>
<br/>
One last thing -- been browsing the archives, and I see several references<br/>
to a cross-server Monk guild. Is there such a thing? Is there interest? How<br/>
do we go about forming one?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
