<div id="ygrps-yiv-1943410556">This is how I see it: A successful feign is like casting a spell <br/>
successfully.  If a spell fails, you fizzle, if a feign fails, you &quot;fall to <br/>
the ground&quot;.  However, because you performed the skill perfectly doesn&#39;t <br/>
mean that it will have it&#39;s affect.  A spell can be resisted (far to easily <br/>
it seems : ) ), and monsters can sometimes see through feign death.<br/>
<br/>
Is your skill maxed?  My friend at 32nd level has his up to 167 and someone <br/>
that was 35th level that he was with was only in his 120s.  Even at 167, <br/>
monsters sometimes see though it (like Gorillas in Cazic-Thul).<br/>

 My question is now no longer why/ how did I die<br/>
with a successful feign, but rather if a monster &quot;sees thru&quot;<br/>
a successful feign, how the heck is that feign considered successful?<br/>
