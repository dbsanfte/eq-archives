<div id="ygrps-yiv-106041252">Herrick:  With a full set of cured you will do just fine at level 12 or even<br/>
level 20.  Some cheap stuff you could buy now or save up for:<br/>
<br/>
Onyx earrings (2agi ones) 5pp from Blackburrow<br/>
Spiked collar (3ac 3str) 5pp from Blackburrow<br/>
<br/>
then start saving up:<br/>
<br/>
Bracer of Erolisi (ac5 5str) 30pp from OOT<br/>
Jagged bands (ac5 3str) 30-50pp from Unrest<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Raykwon:  Get rid of the serpentine bracer and buy a vox bracer (ac7).<br/>
Spiked collar (ac3 3str) is hard to beat even though it is newbieish.<br/>
Collar of undead protection (ac5) is good as well.  Get a mask with<br/>
some AC on it- leering mask (from Najena) is cheap or the lizard<br/>
tribal mask from CT is really nice.  Finally get a real cloak-<br/>
lizardscale cloak from CT (ac8 5dex) has great AC even if the dex is<br/>
next to useless.<br/>
<br/>
Also try to switch into cured silk for a lot of your extra equipment. For<br/>
shoes I think the cured silk is better than fur lined and elsewhere it is<br/>
lighter than mesh.<br/>
<br/>
With all those changes, which shouldn&#39;t cost a lot if you can get a<br/>
good price on the serp bracers, you should go up about 20AC.  You<br/>
will notice a big difference in the melee damage you take- that&#39;s<br/>
more AC than you gain for going up a level.<br/>
