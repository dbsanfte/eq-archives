<div id="ygrps-yiv-1162064434">In my experience it seems that time has been the important factor in a <br/>
monster&#39;s agro level. For example it would seem like no matter how long I <br/>
lay there a Sand Giant will always come looking for me once I stand up. <br/>
That&#39;s why I bolt to to the zone after a run-in with them no matter what. <br/>
But of course this seems fitting with the way sand giants behavior has <br/>
always shown it be one of the most hatefully aggressive creatures in the <br/>
game. i.e. the way they are more willing to switch targets from who they <br/>
were chasing to something else which just got a tad bit closer. All they <br/>
want is to whoop some butt. It makes them happy.<br/>
On the other hand I&#39;ve noticed some creatures will seem to not come back if <br/>
just wait a long time. And still others seem to not come back after just a <br/>
little bit even if I can see in zoomed out view that they didn&#39;t even go but <br/>
just out of sight or what some call their alleged radius of aggression.<br/>
<br/>
But now my question. I had a couple of experiences recently where I was not <br/>
fighting a spell-casting creature and auto-attack was turned off. Also there <br/>
was no failure message. Yet I died. Once was during a packet-loss spike <br/>
(showed me feign and everything but when the PL cleared I was dead) and the <br/>
other I saw no PL and I hadn&#39;t had any lag all day! But everything seemed <br/>
fine after I feigned until about 10 seconds later a flood of damage reports <br/>
came through with my slain message too. The worst part was I feigned because <br/>
I couldn&#39;t take my opponent (Dorn) even though I&#39;m level 21 but I had 4 <br/>
bubbles of health when I feigned! And suddenly poof I&#39;m dead. I fought him <br/>
at level 20 and I know Dorn can beat me but it takes him longer than that. <br/>
So I contacted a guide who related that he really didn&#39;t know much about <br/>
&quot;the ways of the monk&quot;. Anyways he said it might be a bug of some sort and <br/>
he filed it as such and recommended that I file a bug report too. Anyways I <br/>
just wanna know if anyone else has had the same problem before?<br/>
