<div id="ygrps-yiv-1060156047">They start with the follow base stats:<br/>
<br/>
75 str<br/>
80sta<br/>
100agi<br/>
95dex<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
+20 points to distribute<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If I were you I would put all those points into STR.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The iksar have infravision and regen as fast as trolls.  They probably take<br/>
a slight XP penalty for this.  Their high agility and Dex means taht you can<br/>
IGNORE those stats and go for straight AC and STR gear - something that<br/>
human monks cant do as easily.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So in a word, Yes, iksar are better at lower levels (1-40).  Beyond level<br/>
40, the regen rate means squat cause you wont be soloing and you will have<br/>
over 1000 hp.  The AGI and dex wont make &quot;all that much&quot; difference, cause<br/>
human monks would have acquired good gear by this time to compensate them<br/>
for thier innate difficiency.  All in all I would have to say that an Iksar<br/>
at level 50 and a Human at level 50 would be go about 50/50 in a series of<br/>
duels, with prhaps a slight edge going to the Iksar.<br/>
<br/>
I do not intend to start an iksar monk.  But I think they will be great<br/>
monks to play and level from 1-35 or so.  Bear in mind they will not be<br/>
liked everywhere they go and faction will be a problem for them.<br/>
