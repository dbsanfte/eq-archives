<div id="ygrps-yiv-1021286406"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; ahhh and the twinkers respond.  You know what...just keep twinking<br/>
&gt; away...eventually you will get bored with the game and leave.<br/>
&gt; Actually...i think I will just move to Tallon Zek servers.  That way I can<br/>
&gt; take care of twinkers...one twink at a time.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nope.  I&#39;m on the 6-month subscription plan. :)  If I get my ogre to 50th<br/>
level and want to start a new char.. you bet I&#39;ll twink him a little.  The<br/>
most boring levels of the game are the &quot;builder&quot; levels.  The ones you&#39;re<br/>
stuck in a little area, and can&#39;t go anywhere else because 95% of everything<br/>
will KoS you in 1 attack.  If I can give my char a little edge to get<br/>
through these levels faster, to get him into good enough shape to ADVENTURE,<br/>
I will.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The kindergarden mentality on the normal servers of &quot;i can do what i want<br/>
&gt; and you can&#39;t do anything about it&quot;  sickens me.  Damn I wish every server<br/>
&gt; was PvP....no twinkers....and the only assholes would be the ones who can<br/>
&gt; defend themselves.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>PvP does not make the game enjoyable for me.  I&#39;m in it to look around,<br/>
adventure.  Not have to deal with people wanting to kill me if I happen to<br/>
get something cool for my chars.  And, the &quot;race war&quot; server is a good<br/>
idea.. bad implementation.  I&#39;ll never use it in its current form.  But, I&#39;m<br/>
not gonna say I&#39;m better than people who DO use it.  I play the game my way,<br/>
and I really don&#39;t care how anyone else does it (unless they&#39;re actually<br/>
hacking the game, a la Diablo.)<br/>
