<div><font face="Arial" size="2">You&#39;re going to want two suits, at least.&nbsp; For 
soloing, you want AC and resistances first, then str etc.&nbsp; When you&#39;re in a 
group with good tanks/healers, you want strength first.&nbsp; The reasoning 
behind this is simple.&nbsp; When soloing, you want to make it as hard as 
possible for them to hurt you.&nbsp; When in a group, you can concentrate on 
damage rather than defense since you won&#39;t be taking the hits if there are 
decent tanks in the group.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">My defense gear includes things like ac 
rings/earrings, symbols of loyalty to vox, etc, all as light as possible.&nbsp; 
My offense gear is strength rings/earrings, hero/erollisi bracers, etc.&nbsp; 
Yes, it puts me over my weight limit (the hero bracer is 4 weight all by 
itself), but it&#39;s not really a concern if I&#39;m not getting hit.</font></div>

  <p><tt>Well, I&#39;ve been fighting in Dalnir&#39;s for a while now (about two weeks, 
  off<br>and on), and yesterday, I stumbeled upon THREE pieces of 
  Crescent:&nbsp; Gi, arms,<br>and slippers.<br><br>The slipers are a 
  no-brainer, since I had been wearing cured silk.&nbsp; But, the<br>other two 
  are a bit harder.<br><br>I *was* wearing a Foreman&#39;s Tunic (10AC, +3 STR, +3 
  WIS), so I think the<br>+7 str of the Gi more than makes up for the 2 AC 
  difference.&nbsp; (The Gi is AC8)<br><br>But, I&#39;m wearing Auzure sleves.&nbsp; 
  I don&#39;t think that the stats of the arms even<br>come close to the AC of the 
  Azure.&nbsp; Comments?<br><br>So, for now, I carry around the arms to sell 
  with (+2 CHA)<br><br>I can&#39;t wait to get more of this stuff.&nbsp; I&#39;m still 
  wearing cured silk sholders<br>and cape.<br></tt></p></blockquote></span></blockquote></html>
