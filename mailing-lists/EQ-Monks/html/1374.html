<div id="ygrps-yiv-727657116">Hi guys.  AS i am now bored of reading about twinking...i thought i would pose a question out to my higher level brothers and sisters.  This weekend, i competed in a guild scavenger hunt and won.  My prize was a Staff of Writhing and a Crested Helm.  My level is only 10 right now and i know this is kinda expensive/rare stuff, especially the helm.  My question is what do you think i should trade for? Because i have no clue.  Following is a list of my equipment that i already have:<br/>
<br/>
Foreman Tunic (borrowed)<br/>
cloth sandals<br/>
mammoth leggings (borrowed)<br/>
cloth cape<br/>
cloth arms<br/>
serp bracer (borrowed), mesh bracelet<br/>
Jagged band ( borrowed )<br/>
Band of flesh<br/>
mesh neck<br/>
cloth cape<br/>
Wu&#39;s Gauntlets<br/>
cloth shoulders<br/>
Splitpaw mask<br/>
<br/>
I guess that is about it....i have a friend who is going to make me cured silk all i have to do is get the heady kiolas.  Hopefully you guys can lead me in the right direction. Thanks.<br/>
