<div id="ygrps-yiv-1031122299"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Now for the questions...<br/>
&gt; 1. How rare is Qwinn ? it took me about 16 hours to get Br Z. more rare<br/>
&gt; ? less rare ? good places to try and find him / spot him ? does he have<br/>
&gt; placeholders ? basically anyone got any low down on him ?<br/>
&gt; 2. Is there still a skill check against tailoring ? (I have 0 skill in<br/>
&gt; tailoring or maybe 1)<br/>
&gt; if there is, and it fails will a GM give me either all the items again<br/>
&gt; or the robe ?<br/>
&gt; and should I petition a GM before attempting ... just in case ?<br/>
&gt; (I heard that this was fixed a few patches back but still I want to be<br/>
&gt; sure, this is hundreds of hours worth of work, I don&#39;t want to lose it)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; yay the ordeal is almost over ..... treant fists next 8(.<br/>
<br/>

1) Qwinn is pretty common.  Just do a /ooc and have others help locate<br/>
him.  He roams all over the zone so someone with tracking is helpful.<br/>
You do not need to kill him, and as another person pointed out, he hits<br/>
extremely hard.  Watched him taked out a cyclops in 2 rounds...<br/>
2) No skill check is needed for making the robe now.<br/>
<br/>
Treant fist..  Enjoy the boring camp of the Gorge...  3 of 4 pieces are<br/>
easy to get, the gorge one sucked up hours and hours of time.<br/>
