<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1441504164">In answer to that question, then... swimming is level capped. The only <br/>
skills that are not level capped are trade skills (You too can be a master <br/>
blacksmith at level 2 : ). You will even notice that fishing is level <br/>
capped as well.<br/>

&gt; &gt; That is just the way skills work. It benefits you either way. Trying<br/>
&gt; &gt; making a human and get your whopping skill of 20 at 4th and try to<br/>
&gt; &gt; get away from something. Ain&#39;t gonna happen.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I didn&#39;t say it would happen. Nice job on neatly missing the point<br/>
&gt;completely though.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If what he says below is true, then I shouldn&#39;t have even been able to<br/>
&gt;raise it from 100 to 120 until I got to lvl 20, which clearly isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;the case.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ll have to get to lvl 5 to confirm this, but if I get to 5, and my<br/>
&gt;skill can go to 125, then it looks like it&#39;s lvl capped to 100 + (lvl<br/>
&gt;* 5), which was my initial question.  I thought swimming WASN&#39;T lvl<br/>
&gt;capped, but it looks (at first glance) that it is.<br/>
