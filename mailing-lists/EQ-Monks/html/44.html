 </span></blockquote>	Whoa... while level 8 is still considered by most to be &#39;low&#39;, it<br/>
probably doesn&#39;t feel like it to the person who&#39;s just brought it up to<br/>
that point.  You might want to think about trashing all of that effort for<br/>
a fairly minimal potential return.<br/>
	As far as skill point distribution goes, I&#39;ve only once put<br/>
anything other than a single point into any skill, and that was for Feign<br/>
Death, which I put 15 into just to get it kick started.  (A decision I<br/>
would not make again, given the chance, btw.)  If you&#39;re clever, all of<br/>
your skills are readily maxxed out without having to put points and money<br/>
into training them up.  Now, that having been said, don&#39;t think that you&#39;ve<br/>
wasted the points you&#39;ve already spent.  To tell you the truth, at level<br/>
20, I&#39;ve got more practices saved up than I know what to do with, and I<br/>
suspect that over time, most monks experience this same thing.  Personally,<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t let the use of a few practice points lead me into trashing an<br/>
otherwise perfectly good character.<br/>
	(Freeport is a fantastic area, so a move there might not be a bad<br/>
idea, btw.  I found it to be much more to my liking than the Qeynos area.)<br/>

&gt;higher up guys could go back and re-do it what would you pick?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>	Conventional wisdom is that you should dump everything into Agility<br/>
and have done with it.  I started my character some time ago and without<br/>
the benefit of such advice, so I ended up distributing things in a roughly<br/>
even fashion.  Do I regret it?  Not at all...  While sometimes I wonder how<br/>
much more (or less) effective I might have been with another arrangement,<br/>
I&#39;ve never once seriously considered dumping that char to start over from<br/>
scratch.  Having spent time with a lot of other monks and talking to them<br/>
about their experiences, I&#39;d have to venture the (heretical) opinion that<br/>
perhaps dumping everything into AGI isn&#39;t as huge a thing as some might<br/>
have you think.  I&#39;m just as effective as other monks of my level with<br/>
different base stats.  (Besides, magic items can help you even things out a<br/>
bit later if you still have stat envy. :) )<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;2. Is there any trade skill that I should concentrate on that would be a big<br/>

 </span></blockquote>	Hrm... good question.  I don&#39;t practice any trades (they all scare<br/>
me with the amount of time and money they seem to require), so I can&#39;t help<br/>
you on this one.  Sorry...<br/>
