&gt; Of the monks that I know, it seems that I have the worst luck at getting<br/>
my<br/>
&gt; Mend skill to work, especially in high risk combat situations.  I have<br/>
&gt; maxed out the skill at 17th level.  This is not an exaggeration.<br/>
Yesterday<br/>
&gt; I was soloing scarecrows in West Karana.  I was earning a little Xp and<br/>
&gt; practicing my newly aquired FD skill, which did work,  I used mend 4 times<br/>
&gt; in about a 2 hour period of time.  It worked once, failed twice, and<br/>
&gt; worsened my wounds the last time, which killed me when I had a white<br/>
&gt; scarecrow on its last legs.  My character basically committed suicide at<br/>
&gt; the point where he was going to win.  As I said, it seems I have the worse<br/>
&gt; luck with Mend.  Does any one else have this problem or am I just the<br/>
&gt; victim of bad numbers?<br/>
