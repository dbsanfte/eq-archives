<div id="ygrps-yiv-639494362">Actually, I&#39;m a monk from Qeynos and recently (two days ago) was able to<br/>
get the white sash (and then the yellow one) from the Freeport monks.<br/>
<br/>
The last time I checked, the Tomer and Konem quests did give Ashen Order<br/>
faction (about a week ago at least). I don&#39;t know if they change that in<br/>
the last patch or not...<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;When a monk from Qeynos tries to start the Sash Quests of Freeport, he<br/>
 </span></blockquote>runs into difficulty. The Qeynos monk&#39;s faction with them is usually too<br/>
low to allow him to begin the quests. There are several quests in Qeynos<br/>
that will allow a Freeport monk to increase their faction with the Silent<br/>
Fist, but no such quests (that I&#39;m aware of) in Freeport to increase<br/>
faction with the Ashen Order.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;Workarounds for this have been the subject of much debate. Many solutions<br/>
 </span></blockquote>have been presented, however, it looks like Verant has &quot;fixed&quot; them all.<br/>
I&#39;m going to list all the ones that don&#39;t work now, so that any starting<br/>
monks won&#39;t fall into these traps...<br/>

&gt;1) Create a Freeport monk and get his guild note to turn in for instant<br/>
 </span></blockquote>faction.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;Problem: The guild notes are now Lore items, and so are no-drop, no-trade.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;2) Do the Tomer and/or Konem Quests in Qeynos.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Problem: The only faction you increase with these now is with the Silent<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Fist, the Ashen Order does NOT show up anymore.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;3) Get a Freeport monk to give you their White Sash, and then carry on<br/>
 </span></blockquote>from there.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;Problem: If you try to get the next sash by turning in your current sash<br/>
 </span></blockquote>(gotten from the Freeport monk) and the items, you lose all the items and<br/>
the sash. The Ashen Guild member will give you a message like &quot;I will not<br/>
help beings of your kind&quot;. This is especially vexing if you had a Freeport<br/>
monk to give you the Orange sash, and tried to turn it in for the Red sash.<br/>
The Red sash items are a little hard to come by, and having them go up in<br/>
smoke would be frustrating.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;In conclusion, it looks like the only way to truly do the quests now is to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>build your faction with the Freeport monks in some way. I have been<br/>
noticing that they HAVE been starting to like me more, but, I am unsure as<br/>
to why. I believe it is because I&#39;ve been killed so many orcs lately. If<br/>
anyone has any ideas, they would be welcome.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;The only possible workaround I see now, is to give the items for the later<br/>
 </span></blockquote>quests to a Freeport monk (one you create or another player) and have them<br/>
give you the resulting sash. However, I think the later sashes are no-drop,<br/>
no-trade, unlike the beginning sashes, which are Lore items, but can be<br/>
traded.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;Finally, the point of the Monk headbands/sashes is not that they are<br/>
 </span></blockquote>terribly powerful magical items, but that it&#39;s fun and challenging for a<br/>
monk to complete a quest that is not really available to many other people.<br/>
Sure there are lots of items that are better, but it&#39;s a nice part of you<br/>
character when you can say that you are a Purple Headband, Purple Sash<br/>
holder ;-)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;(If I&#39;ve made any glaring errors/omissions, I apologize, and would expect<br/>
 </span></blockquote>that I will be corrected asap &lt;grin&gt;)<br/>
