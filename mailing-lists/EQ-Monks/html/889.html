&gt; Subject: Feign Pulling Yet Again<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hi, all.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Is there ANY way to separate mobs that stack one on top the other? I<br/>
&gt; was in<br/>
&gt; Najena today trying to pull the Ogre Captain. I&#39;d hit him and run back<br/>
&gt; out<br/>
&gt; of the room. He would come along with one of his officers. But they<br/>
&gt; were<br/>
&gt; directly on top of each other and they would consistently leave<br/>
&gt; together.<br/>
&gt; What am I doing wrong?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks in advance<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>

<br/>
First, attack one of the monsters in the group and let them all come out<br/>
after you.  Fall back a little bit, then feign death.  Wait for all of<br/>
them to leave.  Of course, if one stays around so that you can stand up<br/>
and pull him at this time, do so.  If they wont separate, wait for them<br/>
all to go back, then get up.  Go back near them, to just inside throwing<br/>
star range.  Throw a star at the one you want.  <br/>
<br/>
Normally, just the one you throw a star at will come, after the group<br/>
has already been pulled out once.  I used this technique very often to<br/>
separate groups like the ogre captain, and the shin lord in upper guk.<br/>
Often I used this process exclusively in upper guk, because i usually<br/>
didnt have to wait as long, because i wouldnt need to draw them out<br/>
hardly at all it seemed to make it work.  I am noticing that recently,<br/>
however, that the technique works less and less.  This might be due to<br/>
the fact that i&#39;m fighting different types/levels of monsters, or as a<br/>
result of an actual server-side code change.  As far as i can tell it<br/>
wont work on anything in lower guk for instance.  If you get a group you<br/>
can&#39;t separate with a simple feign, give it a try.</div>
