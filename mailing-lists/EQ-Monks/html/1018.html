<div id="ygrps-yiv-1240593275">I&#39;ve had a kraken targetted before.  I believe it does exist, though<br/>
just like Nessie, I never was able to get a good look at it,<br/>
probably due to the huge yellow streak running down my back.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Mayhong Mistmoore(sp) has been beated on most servers, at least the old<br/>
&gt; &gt; school ones.  The kraken or whatever the name of it is, does not<br/>
&gt; &gt; exist....as of 3 days ago when i and my guildmates last did a check for<br/>
&gt; &gt; it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Really?  Did it ever exist, or was it just one of those fables people tell<br/>
&gt; newbies to scare them? :)<br/>
