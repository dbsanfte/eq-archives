On a starting point I am a level 17 monk of Quellious<br/>
<br/>
On the Blind issue: Everyone complains about this...<br/>
yet I don&#39;t seem to see the problem.  Perhaps it is<br/>
because I learn zones quickly and generally always<br/>
know where I am.  Buy a greater lightstone, memorize<br/>
the zone you are in, max out sense heading and always<br/>
know which way to run.  Thats the best advice I can<br/>
give.  I have a druid with infravision and it doesn&#39;t<br/>
seem to be much of an improvement (still can&#39;t see<br/>
anything in Misty Thicket)<br/>
<br/>
Just live with it<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Second... I am level 17, i&#39;ve been hunt in oasis for 3<br/>
levels and I want to go somewhere else.  I was<br/>
thinking of East Karana.  Any recommendations as to<br/>
where I should hunt and what I should fight<br/>
