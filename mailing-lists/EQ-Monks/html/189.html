<div id="ygrps-yiv-1763625402">I think part of the problem is this.  The melee classes were very close to<br/>
being balanced but then they went and upped everything for the warriors.<br/>
Now the warriors have been boosted up so much that they can out do a monk<br/>
almost completely.  We used to be of equal use to a group as a warrior but<br/>
now we just can&#39;t keep up.<br/>
