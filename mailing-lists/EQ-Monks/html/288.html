<div id="ygrps-yiv-141674727">Don&#39;t know if this will help but here goes. In the Qeynos area you can<br/>
travel to BlackBurrow (&quot;BB&quot;), the entrance to which is on the Eastern side<br/>
of the Qeynos Hills Zone. Gnolls there are good hunting from levels 7 to 15,<br/>
more or less. The area is famous, and justly so, for &quot;Trains&quot; so stay near<br/>
the zone border at first. Also, strongly suggest you NOT go in hollow tree<br/>
to the left of cave exit as you go into BB, hehe.<br/>

&gt; everything in the area is now either conning green or conning yellow (few<br/>
&gt; and far between).  However, if I go to different zones, it&#39;s instant red<br/>
&gt; cons.  Any suggestions on getting over this level hump? </span></blockquote></div>
