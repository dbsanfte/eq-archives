&gt; I&#39;ve wanted to read this log for a while - any ideas on where i can find it?<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve cursed myself for missing the thing.<br/>

&gt; I think you are giving these guys WAY too much credit.  Check<br/>
&gt; the log from the monk sit in.  Smedley told us a bald faced lie.<br/>
&gt; Not something that he was considering but something he said he<br/>
&gt; was doing.  He has yet to do it obviously and he never will.  As<br/>
&gt; far as I&#39;m concerned, I have no reason to accept their word or<br/>
&gt; that they are working with us in good faith.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Just sent this off to Brad and Smedley... was hoping that if<br/>
&gt; &gt; others felt as I do, we could continue to work them in a similar<br/>
&gt; &gt; manner.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Mr. McQuaid,<br/>
&gt; &gt; I have just finished reading your rather long and impassioned<br/>
&gt; &gt; eMail/Producer letter on the topic of Everquest&#39;s evolution.  I found<br/>
&gt; &gt; it to be one of the most effective communications from any game<br/>
&gt; &gt; company to its customers that I have ever read, and for that I<br/>
&gt; &gt; congratulate you.  I hope that people read it, think about it, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; take away from it that which you intended: that the EQ team cares<br/>
&gt; &gt; deeply about Norrath and its citizens.<br/>
&gt; &gt; As a software developer myself (although truthfully, I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; do as much actual development as I&#39;d like any more - I tend to spend<br/>
&gt; &gt; more time in the design and management process these days), I also<br/>
&gt; &gt; understand that there must be a primary focus to every project.  For<br/>
&gt; &gt; me, this doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that the primary goal be &quot;create<br/>
&gt; &gt; the best possible system&quot;... it goes beyond that to a deeper goal:<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;Make sure that the client is happy&quot;.  Sometimes this involves<br/>
&gt; &gt; difficult and painful decisions, Herculean efforts, and the ability<br/>
&gt; &gt; to case aside profit considerations at times in order to fight for<br/>
&gt; &gt; what is ultimately the best way to solve any given problem.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I suspect that you and your team have a similar goal, except<br/>
&gt; &gt; yours would be to keep your subscriber base happy and to attract new<br/>
&gt; &gt; members to that subscriber base.  Another parallel between what we do<br/>
&gt; &gt; is that our clients (or subscribers, in your case) don&#39;t always know<br/>
&gt; &gt; what it is that will truly make them happy or are at loggerheads<br/>
&gt; &gt; about what any particular change might do to forward that goal<br/>
&gt; &gt; (witness how many people cannot even agree on whether or not an item<br/>
&gt; &gt; on your recently released change list is a &quot;+&quot; or a &quot;-&quot;.)<br/>
&gt; &gt; Most of us understand that tuning needs to take place.  If<br/>
&gt; &gt; things were too easy, then there would be no challenge to life in<br/>
&gt; &gt; Norrath and therefore there would be little enjoyment of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; surmounting of those challenges.  If one class is too powerful, a<br/>
&gt; &gt; surfeit of players using that class results, just as a underpowered<br/>
&gt; &gt; or less useful class suffers a dearth of interested participants.<br/>
&gt; &gt; The fact that it requires a group of people to do most worthwhile<br/>
&gt; &gt; things in EQ is one of the more attractive things about the game<br/>
&gt; &gt; (although there are of course those who would argue that this is also<br/>
&gt; &gt; one of its greatest downfalls).  The fact that each and every class -<br/>
&gt; &gt; once it reaches maturity - can bring something unique to a group is a<br/>
&gt; &gt; wonderful and fragile thing.  Adjusting the balance of the classes so<br/>
&gt; &gt; that their value to such a group is maintained is a task of<br/>
&gt; &gt; monumental delicacy, and your efforts at maintaining this balance<br/>
&gt; &gt; should be commended.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Unfortunately, as people are by definition human, mistakes<br/>
&gt; &gt; are occasionally made.  Over time, the development team has<br/>
&gt; &gt; recognized some of these mistakes and have made efforts to address<br/>
&gt; &gt; them.  By way of example, Warriors got some serious boosts some time<br/>
&gt; &gt; ago, and with the introduction of the expansion, the presence of a<br/>
&gt; &gt; Rogue in a well-rounded party will become very important indeed.<br/>
&gt; &gt; These were both well-considered and well-deserved changes, and the<br/>
&gt; &gt; players of those classes have (or will have) reaped the rewards of<br/>
&gt; &gt; these changes over the course of time.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Other classes who have been &#39;nerfed&#39; may complain<br/>
&gt; &gt; vociferously about it, but if they go over those issues which<br/>
&gt; &gt; generated the most complaints (kiting, pet damage, etc) I think that<br/>
&gt; &gt; people will realize that while these changes were made to the<br/>
&gt; &gt; possible detriment of the solo player, they were certainly done to<br/>
&gt; &gt; enhance the value and necessity of other classes in a group.  If this<br/>
&gt; &gt; was indeed your goal, then I must certainly say that your mission has<br/>
&gt; &gt; been accomplished.<br/>
&gt; &gt; With this in mind, I am still at a loss to explain why the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Feign Death skill for Monks was recently so seriously altered.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; understand your reasons for doing what you did, but the consequence<br/>
&gt; &gt; is that the usefulness of a Monk in higher-level (40+) groups has<br/>
&gt; &gt; been seriously compromised.  True, we can do the damage of a<br/>
&gt; &gt; decently-equipped warrior, but that&#39;s it.  The warrior offers so much<br/>
&gt; &gt; more to a group (stun, taunt, the ability to take huge amounts of<br/>
&gt; &gt; damage, etc) that the role of a monk has been diminished greatly.<br/>
&gt; &gt; The one thing that we could bring to a group - that of feign-pulling<br/>
&gt; &gt; - has for all practical purposes been eliminated and replaced with a<br/>
&gt; &gt; reputation for being the &quot;Master Train Engineers&quot;.  For this reason,<br/>
&gt; &gt; monks are beginning to be refused entry into impromptu groups because<br/>
&gt; &gt; they do not bring anything special and are often dangerous companions.<br/>
&gt; &gt; As a level 50 monk, I no longer use FD for fear that on those<br/>
&gt; &gt; occasions where it is necessary, I&#39;ll end up wiping out half the zone<br/>
&gt; &gt; as I get up to work my way back to a zone point.  I would far rather<br/>
&gt; &gt; die individually than wipe out other innocent players in a ploy to<br/>
&gt; &gt; save my own skin - and have now done so on a number of occasions.<br/>
&gt; &gt; How has this change made your player base happier?  How has<br/>
&gt; &gt; it enhanced the role of a Monk in a group?  How has it positively<br/>
&gt; &gt; affected group dynamics?  I really want to understand what the<br/>
&gt; &gt; desired affect of this change was... perhaps if I did, I could lose<br/>
&gt; &gt; the bitter taste in my mouth and not continually toy with the idea of<br/>
&gt; &gt; dropping out of Norrath in disappointment.  As it is, I only stay so<br/>
&gt; &gt; that I can help twink up friends.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Don&#39;t get me wrong, I am not saying that Norrath is an<br/>
&gt; &gt; impossible place to live in without Monks being able to Feign in<br/>
&gt; &gt; their accustomed fashion.  Groups will just load up on more Warriors<br/>
&gt; &gt; or Paladins in their stead, and the more difficult areas of Norrath<br/>
&gt; &gt; that could previously be handled by a single well-organized and<br/>
&gt; &gt; balanced group will now have to be taken by multiple groups just<br/>
&gt; &gt; charging in willy-nilly with no plan more sophisticated than &quot;kill<br/>
&gt; &gt; this one first, then that one, and if we&#39;re still left alive, we go<br/>
&gt; &gt; for that other one last.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I understand that your decision is made and that further<br/>
&gt; &gt; revision to the Feign Death mechanics is unlikely.  I am not<br/>
&gt; &gt; therefore asking for you to do so - your team seems to be happy with<br/>
&gt; &gt; FD in its current form, and we as players should respect that and<br/>
&gt; &gt; make our own decisions accordingly.  I just wanted to ask for a brief<br/>
&gt; &gt; explanation of the motivations behind this change and to also bring<br/>
&gt; &gt; again to your attention the fact that the balance you strive for is<br/>
&gt; &gt; an exceedingly delicate thing that is all to easily thrown out of<br/>
&gt; &gt; kilter by even the best-intentioned and well-discussed changes.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Thank you for your time.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Brad: &quot;u twink ur friends?&quot;  *BAN*<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;    Sorry, I&#39;m a cynical bastard and I just had to add that little bit.<br/>
&gt; Really, it is a sensible letter, but when has an MMORPG team ever made<br/>
&gt; sense?<br/>
