<div id="ygrps-yiv-1054167261">First off I am fairly new to EQ... tomorrow I will<br/>
have been playing for a week in real life time.  I<br/>
spent a lot of time looking into the game before I<br/>
bought and decided I would have the most fun playing a<br/>
monk.  I started a Monk character and have been<br/>
immensily satisfied, I am level 8. (I started in<br/>
freeport)<br/>
<br/>
Onto sashes.  I have had horrible experiences with<br/>
sashes.  I got the white sash at Level 2, you would<br/>
have a hell of a time killing deathfist pawns at level<br/>
1 so I think most ppl get it at 2.  Anyway... by 5 I<br/>
was out of the newbie area and began searching for the<br/>
things needed for the yellow headband, to refresh our<br/>
memory you need a Tarantula Chitin, a Deathfist<br/>
Slashed Belt, and a Giant Snake Rattle.  I worked hard<br/>
to get these items, and because I was trying at a<br/>
lower level than I should it was very difficult.  I<br/>
managed to kill a tarantula with a group of 4 people. <br/>
I also found the  rattle and slashed belt this way. <br/>
Great I thought, I as level 6 and I was about to get<br/>
something that most ppl can&#39;t get on their own till 7<br/>
or 8.  I took the stuff back, turned it all in and I<br/>
got nothing.  I was so pissed.  I had to go back to<br/>
newbie area to find all the stuff I needed for white,<br/>
then I went back and I was so pissed that I bought the<br/>
giant snake rattle and chitin and managed to find<br/>
someone to give me the slashed belt.  This time I<br/>
turned it in and it worked.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not looking forward to Orange tho.  I need a<br/>
Greater Lightstone, Legionaire&#39;s bracers, and a<br/>
Cutthroat insignia ring.  I have the latter and I can<br/>
buy the former if I have to but I don&#39;t have a clue<br/>
what the legionare&#39;s bracers are... its probably not<br/>
worth the effort <br/>
