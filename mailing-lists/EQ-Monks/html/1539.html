<div id="ygrps-yiv-836432415">That is just the way skills work. It benefits you either way. Trying making<br/>
a human and get your whopping skill of 20 at 4th and try to get away from<br/>
something. Ain&#39;t gonna happen. <br/>

&gt; mastery. The first poster is using some software package (ShowEQ or <br/>
&gt; something similar) to display a numeric value for his skill. In answer to <br/>
&gt; the first poster&#39;s question, you will not be able to improve your skill <br/>
&gt; beyond 120 until you reach a level that allows you to progress beyond that<br/>
<br/>
&gt; skill (level 24 in this case).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Then why did it allow me to get to 120 at lvl 4?  I mean, why go from<br/>
100 to 120, stop for 20 lvls, then start up again?<br/>
<br/>
That makes no sense at all.<br/>
<br/>
(I&#39;m not using ShowEQ, BTW; I looked at my log file to see where it<br/>
started and ended.)<br/>
