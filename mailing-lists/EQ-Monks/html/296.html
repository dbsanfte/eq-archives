As several of our number have recommended, Butcher Block is indeed a ripe<br/>
hunting ground.  The beast therein are enemies to our kind, and swift<br/>
execution<br/>
of such foul creatures will only serve to improve the esteem with which all of<br/>
the monks of Qeynos regard you. Take all due precautions, however.  Never turn<br/>
your back to a gnoll as they are prone to rally their dispicable brethren in a<br/>
vulgar call to arms against our kind.  Carry a full supply of straps for<br/>
binding; you will suffer injuries both great and mild in the burrow that even<br/>
your thoughtful meditations may be unable to heal.  And always head the<br/>
call of<br/>
others warning of approaching gnoll platoons; make haste for a safe spot but,<br/>
if you are able, assist those in need on your way.<br/>
<br/>
There are other advantages to battling the gnolls of Blackburrow as well. I<br/>
would advise you to discuss those very beast with Master Phin at the house of<br/>
the Silent Fist. He may have a vital mission requiring your attention.<br/>
<br/>
May Quellious guide you,<br/>

&gt;OK.  I am a 7th level monk travelling through the Qeynos area on the new<br/>
&gt;Tribunal server.  I&#39;ve run into a stump, though.  It seems to me that<br/>
&gt;everything in the area is now either conning green or conning yellow (few<br/>
&gt;and far between).  However, if I go to different zones, it&#39;s instant red<br/>
&gt;cons.  Any suggestions on getting over this level hump?<br/>
