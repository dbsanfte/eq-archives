<div id="ygrps-yiv-1576155495">Someone mentioned on one of the recent posts about FD that it was unfair<br/>
that the NPCs had some sort of telepathy to know when one of its members<br/>
saw you stand again and let everyone else in the mob know.  In the interest<br/>
of fairness, doesn&#39;t every PC in the game already have telepathy?  WIth<br/>
group say, auction, OOC, Tell, and Sohut, Pcs are able to talk to eachother<br/>
over a large area.  I know that I have been in the hills of Queynos and<br/>
have been talking to a friend of mine in Freeport.  Why should it be any<br/>
different from the NPcs.  So waht if they are computer generated AI NPCs.<br/>
