<div id="ygrps-yiv-1726958337">I&#39;m a Freeport monk who just hit level 14 and am wondering what to do next.<br/>
My circuit of N Ro, E Comm, and W Comm (parts of it, anyway) have gotten me<br/>
this far, but opponents now are getting to be either too easy around there<br/>
or still way too tough, so I want a zone that&#39;s going to have a good share<br/>
of blues for me, plus whites, yellows, and realistic reds I can fight in<br/>
groups.<br/>
<br/>
A 20th level Necro friend of mine wants to bring me to Highpass to help me<br/>
level quickly, but I&#39;m nervous that if he&#39;s not around I may not be able to<br/>
solo. Any thoughts on this?<br/>
<br/>
Anybody else have suggestions? I&#39;d prefer to stay on the eastern side of<br/>
Antonica or on Faydwer.<br/>
<br/>
Also, can I get some recommendations on jewelry that&#39;s in my price range?<br/>
I&#39;ve got all of 30 plat to my name.<br/>
<br/>
