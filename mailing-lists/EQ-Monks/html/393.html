&gt; &gt;Hello Fellow Monks,<br/>
&gt; &gt;It is me again. This bit just gave me an idea. How about Monk<br/>
&gt; &gt;specialization? something like pick a new skill such  as &quot;Fists like<br/>
&gt; &gt;Stone&quot;, or &quot;Bending Reed&quot;, which might seriously add to dodging. So fists<br/>
&gt; &gt;of stone would dish out harder hits when the skill increases and bending<br/>
&gt; &gt;reed might seriously cut on the damage and add to the swiftness and<br/>
agility<br/>
&gt; &gt;of Monks. But make it a choose one or the other type of special skill.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Perhaps give us three or four skills to choose from. How about that? :o)<br/>
&gt; &gt;Quan of Tribunal<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That actually sounds like a good idea.  But at what level would these be<br/>
&gt; available?  20?<br/>
20 is a bit early, it should be the same time casters get their<br/>
specialization, or maybe the same level we get flying kick.  I think the<br/>
earliest it should be is about 25,  but still who am I, a player, who makes<br/>
the changes, Verant : ()<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Perhaps have one for swifter punching too?  Fists of the Wind?  Decreases<br/>
&gt; your delay by 1 every level? (up to a minimum of 15, or something? </span></blockquote></div>
