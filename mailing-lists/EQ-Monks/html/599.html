<div id="ygrps-yiv-226561564">Well, actually in a way it does twinking does hurt many of us. How often have <br/>
you headed into that area to camp for that item you need for your character <br/>
or your friend who is with you only to find that guy 15 levels above anything <br/>
in the place sitting there in front of you? I think twinking is a problem <br/>
outside of just beefing up characters but in that I have heard many times <br/>
someone say I can use this for my other character this gets under my skin. <br/>
What if I can use it for the character I am playing at the moment which <br/>
happens to be the ONLY character I have. The problem comes when they camp for <br/>
items for these other characters. I am not saying everyone does it, but I <br/>
have seen it done MOORE then enough times to have a almost automatic dislike <br/>
for every twinked character I have met. I have gone in to maybe camp the <br/>
Jboots with friends and find 4 35+ lvl casters sitting there camping the <br/>
spot. All from the same guild. When they killed her in trotted one of their <br/>
lower level guildmembers to loot the corpse. This is the problem I have with <br/>
it. Twinking encourages camping and camping is already enough of a problem as <br/>
is. I could care less if his high level friend gave him all that stuff, but <br/>
if his high level friend was sitting in front of me when I was going for the <br/>
same item then it did effect me. How can you prove either way?</div>
