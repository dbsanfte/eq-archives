<div id="ygrps-yiv-1312155646">14 in Misty Thicket? I think that&#39;s a little high for there. And if I recall<br/>
correctly, 14 is the very upper edge for wisps and most will not give exp. I<br/>
would recommend either the Dervs in West Commons, or a trip with a party to<br/>
East Karanas for Reaver hunting. East Karanas, for those of you that don&#39;t<br/>
know, has a GREAT spread of critters. I started hunting there about 16,<br/>
found things to solo and things to group up with. At lvl 27, there are still<br/>
a few things there that will offer me exp. It is also right next door to<br/>
Highpass, should your friend want to take you there. Personally, I hate<br/>
Highpass... On Fennin Ro, it has become a total free for all, with solo<br/>
wizzies blasting everything in sight. Same thing with the Pickclaws in<br/>
Highkeep.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to stay in Eastern Antonica, that&#39;s about it really. You could<br/>
probably group and go into Oasis, but it would be a little risky. Don&#39;t<br/>
limit yourself to just a few zones tho. Crushbone, Steamfront Minos, Aviaks,<br/>
Lake Rathe, Rathe Mts, Dagnors Cauldron, S. Ro... they all have some<br/>
critters that would suit you well.<br/>

&gt; First off you should be able to take Wisps in singles. That would jump<br/>
&gt; your <br/>
&gt; plat funds way up pretty quickly and still offer xps as well. If you want<br/>
&gt; a <br/>
&gt; good place to hunt run on over to Misty Thicket. I found it a pretty nice <br/>
&gt; hunting spot around that level. You could solo there for quite some time. <br/>
&gt; When you max out there take off for Oasis and that can carry you even<br/>
&gt; higher. <br/>
&gt; The loot in both places is not very good so do not expect to get rich. If<br/>
&gt; I <br/>
&gt; were starting over that is probably what I would do at least. <br/>
