<b>Subject:</b> Wizards can solo <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1083682156">Wizards can solo.<br/>
<br/>
I can and do solo as a wizard.  I do not lure creatures to the zone line.  I <br/>
can&#39;t, no speed.  I&#39;m not twinked, I have no JBoots, and I never get SoW while <br/>
soloing.<br/>
<br/>
I nuke from long range, root before they get to me and nuke some more.  When <br/>
they break root, I wait until after they attack and root again.  After some <br/>
practice timing this, it this is very successful.<br/>
<br/>
I soloed crocs in the oasis from 12th to 20th.  Very easy 20% xp per hour.  Yes <br/>
I did die a few times, but obviously by that xp rate it was rare.<br/>
<br/>
I solo easy blues, sometimes medium blues, anything beyond that is dangerous.</div>
