<div id="ygrps-yiv-1106512911">Heh, and I don&#39;t feel nerfed at all. Aside from my monk <br/>
I play an enchanter, and I don&#39;t really kite, but I <br/>
think I&#39;m an even stronger player. The enchanter is <br/>
becoming my favorite class.<br/>
<br/>
The secret is to get the mob to run from you. :)<br/>
<br/>

Variant didnt Nerf anyone!<br/>
i assume that you are referring to the recently <br/>
announced patch in which<br/>
DOT were MODIFIED.  <br/>
<br/>
1) Kiting was widely viewed as an exploit used by <br/>
players to POWER level<br/>
at tremendous rates! THis new patch only makes that <br/>
habbit slightly harder<br/>
 DOT&#39;s do 66% damage while mob is running after you.  <br/>
<br/>
2)You may not beable to Kite BLOOD REDS anymore, but <br/>
blues will be<br/>
kiteable - by level 30 BLues are kicking any mele class <br/>
player&#39;s butt, so<br/>
Kiters will still have a solo advantage over mele types.<br/>
<br/>
3) Fighting in a group  your DOT&#39;s will do a good deal <br/>
more damge now<br/>
because Variant upped the duration by 18 seconds.<br/>
<br/>
All this patch does is prevent players from choosing a <br/>
character just so<br/>
they can Kite their way to level 50 ahead of everyone <br/>
else.  If you seek<br/>
to play a character that has an unfair levelling <br/>
advantage over all others<br/>
then yes, this patch took a major chunk out of your <br/>
behind!  But for those<br/>
of us who are interested in enjoying the game, role-<br/>
playing our chosen<br/>
class of character then this patch doesnt make any <br/>
difference at all.<br/>
