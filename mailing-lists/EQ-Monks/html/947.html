<div id="ygrps-yiv-972931131">I experimented at found they only came back if they could see me.  After<br/>
consulting<br/>
with a GM, I pretty much confirmed that it is a line of sight nerf.  Feign<br/>
pulling a mob<br/>
around the corner should be possible, though I have not specifically tried it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am suprised it hasn&#39;t started already. I just wanted to share with you my Post<br/>
nerf FD experimentaion.<br/>
<br/>
Sol A green Flame goblins. the goblins I was experimenting with were on the<br/>
floor near the passage to where the Foreman spawns.  I succesfully feigned them<br/>
at this point. they returned to thier spawn points . I stood up they immediatly<br/>
came back.  so I feign again they return to thier points I get up and run all<br/>
the way to the small bridge type thing near the sol b spawn point. I fd again.<br/>
I was several mins stand up wait a few and here they come a running at me. I fd<br/>
again let them walk away. get up and they come back.<br/>
<br/>
A fellow monk on my server experimented in Lguk with some Dar Undead frogs and<br/>
had similar results even after 5 mins of feign time.</div>
