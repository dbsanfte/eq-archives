<div id="ygrps-yiv-61481403">I actually liked throwing, the shrukiens and throwing knives are about 1 sp each, and they&#39;re really good for picking stuff out of a mob, like that gnoll that looks like he has a <br/>
cracked staff ; )  But throwing can do about 5 damage with throwing knives (That was my highest at level 9...), and it&#39;s good for stuff that is moving quickly...Like trains and <br/>
stuff...Just make sure there isn&#39;t an elite gnoll commander between you and your target, or a guard ; )<br/>

&gt;&gt; I am a level 7 monk and i have 20 points to spend. Would you recommend i spend them on offensive skills now, save them for later, use them on a skill to make money, or <br/>
use them on throwing. If on<br/>
&gt;&gt; throwing is it a really good skill to get, does it do any damage or is it just to attract animals as ive heard. Thanks for your time.<br/>

&gt;No matter what, dont use them on offensive skills. Your skills will<br/>
&gt;max out at each level as you use them. Waste of points. I&#39;ve found<br/>
&gt;Throwing to be a useless skill as well, only using it rarely to lure.<br/>
