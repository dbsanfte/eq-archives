<div id="ygrps-yiv-1182807833">I haven&#39;t been told that, in those exact words - but I have found slower<br/>
(And fewer) responses to &quot;Monk looking for work&quot; shouts.<br/>
<br/>
And there have been some heated battles between know-it-all wizards, necros<br/>
and druids who tell me that FD does to still work and I&#39;m just not good at<br/>
it :)<br/>
<br/>
I had a lot more to say on the subject but then I&#39;d be whining and it&#39;s just<br/>
a game.<br/>

Ok i posted this question on another board and got zero response.  I will<br/>
try one more time before I give up.<br/>
<br/>
Since the feign death patch, has any high level monk been told &quot;No we don&#39;t<br/>
want you to group with us because you can&#39;t feign death pull&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
thanks<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;If I had to speculate, I&#39;d say that the changes to feign death, or perhaps<br/>
&gt;more accurately now, non-monks perceptions of monks due to the changes in<br/>
&gt;feign death, negatively impact the ability of monks to continue to explore<br/>
&gt;the social aspect of the game, i.e., difficulty getting into groups of<br/>
&gt;strangers, thus not being able to share in a group activity and make new<br/>
&gt;friends, etc., that is the most damaging aspect of what has transpired and<br/>
&gt;the core root of the anger and outrage many monks express.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Just my thoughts...take them for that and nothing more.<br/>
