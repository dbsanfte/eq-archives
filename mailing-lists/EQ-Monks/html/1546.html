&gt; &gt; The negitive is that they are hated by every other race in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; world. Try going to Unrest at 20th or so to collect some of that FS<br/>
&gt; &gt; or bronze and hoard it up till you are twice over your weight limit<br/>
&gt; &gt; as an Iksar, then, try to find a merchant to sell it too who wont<br/>
&gt; &gt; kill you on sight.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I could be on crack here, but I thought they made merchants dubious<br/>
&gt; (at worst) to everyone.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So if you just waltz by them, it&#39;s OK.  And they certainly won&#39;t sell<br/>
&gt; to you if that&#39;s the case.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I found that my troll who used to be KOS to some merchants still can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; sell to/from them, but they don&#39;t attack, and I don&#39;t THINK I did<br/>
&gt; anything to fix faction with them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Or am i insane again?<br/>
