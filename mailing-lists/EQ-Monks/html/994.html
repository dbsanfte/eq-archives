<div id="ygrps-yiv-1003538999">Hi all..!  this is my first post and well I am hoping you all can help<br/>
me here.  I have never wanted to play anything but my druid until just<br/>
recently I was grouped with a monk...and omg he kicked ass.  I have<br/>
shyed away from melee classes since I thought they would be boring but<br/>
after doing some research on monks in general sounds like they get new<br/>
skills all the time and can be fun to play...So I made me a little monk<br/>
newbie.  Now I guess after all my babbling I am on to what I need to<br/>
know here.  First of all...equipment.  What kind of equipment should I<br/>
be looking for...like boots and gloves.  I am ashamed to admit it but I<br/>
am a twink and would readily buy what ever I need for my monk...so tell<br/>
me what should I be looking for....for just good basic stuff.  Right<br/>
now she is pretty decked out in mesh with a few things extras like a<br/>
bracer of errolsi and some silver +agi rings that I had laying around. <br/>
What I don&#39;t have for her is boots or gloves and I have fought<br/>
countless nights in guk looking for mesh gloves....to no avail.   Can<br/>
anyone tell me where to get something that will work in their place and<br/>
what kind of boots I should be looking for.   Anyway sorry for<br/>
babbling...any advice is useful here though!<br/>
