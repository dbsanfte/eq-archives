<div id="ygrps-yiv-1596429149">and if a friend offered me serpentine bracers and an exe hood i wouldn&#39;t<br/>
take em.  I don&#39;t need em at my level and when I get to the appropriate<br/>
level i want to go camp for them....it&#39;s how the game was meant to be<br/>
played and until they change the whole camping system I will continue to<br/>
play it in that fashion.  Twinkers like you already screwed the<br/>
PoF.....whats next....Lower Guk...permafrost.....<br/>
<br/>
you&#39;re just a bunch of jerks who don&#39;t give a shit about the rest of the<br/>
people that play the game....so I can&#39;t wait until you get to 50th level<br/>
and leave the game cause you have nothing else to do.  maybe you can then<br/>
go back to UO or whatever jerkoff game you played before you came and<br/>
wrecked this one.<br/>
