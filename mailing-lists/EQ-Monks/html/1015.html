Hi all, I have decided that it is time for me to complete something I have<br/>
set out to do for quite some time. And that is to get a freaking Werewolf<br/>
claw. Now being one that does not like to run around in the stupid West<br/>
Commonlands, or West Karana asking repetitively anyone have a werewolf on<br/>
tracking let me know! I got so bored and tired so I have decided to go to<br/>
Mistmoore and try to get to the dance floor. Now I have been to MM quite a<br/>
few times but I have never been inside the castle barely even down the ramp<br/>
towards the castle. mainly the Grave Yard and the zone line. Now I would<br/>
like some help on any suggestions or tips as to what to go or how to go<br/>
about getting to the Dance Room with the Gypsies/Werewolves....i.e. party<br/>
make up and level or a site where there might be a map. Thanks for your<br/>
help.<br/>
