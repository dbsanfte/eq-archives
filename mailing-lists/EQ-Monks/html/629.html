<b>Subject:</b> Level 20-30 solo? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1808894248">Hi everyone, I&#39;m new to the list, but my monk has hit level 20, and<br/>
has decided he has killed enough crocodiles.  I&#39;m looking for some<br/>
place that I could solo from level 20-30 and maybe a place that even<br/>
gives good monk loot.<br/>
<br/>
Also, what kind of armor should I be looking for?  I&#39;m pretty much<br/>
straight mesh and LJ tunic.</div>
