<div id="ygrps-yiv-12293323">Does anyone know what factors are used when someone cons an NPC?  Is it<br/>
just the level or their other factors involved?  It seems to me that only<br/>
levels are used to determine how any given NPC compares to a PC.  If PCs<br/>
level is represented as X and an NPcs level is represented by Y.  If X=Y<br/>
then the NPc is Black/White to the PC.  If X&gt;Y the Npc is green or blue<br/>
depending by how much X&gt;Y.  If X&lt;Y then the NPc is yellow or red depending<br/>
on how much X&lt;Y.  If Verant wanted to really cut down on Twinking, they<br/>
could factor in  persons magic items, AC, buffs etc..  The PC may be X<br/>
level, but with items and buffs they are in a situation where their<br/>
relative power level (Z) places them in X&gt;Y by a wide margin.  This allows<br/>
them to breeze through levels much easier than their non-twinked<br/>
counterparts.   &quot;Oh, look, here comes Fippy.  He cons red to me at 2nd<br/>
level, but because I am twinked, I can take him with ease and get lots of<br/>
XP.&quot;  If the cons and XP given  were based on the power level of the PC,<br/>
then the powergamers and twinkers would have to make a choice:  Do they<br/>
keep the really kewl stuff meant for higher level characters or do they<br/>
place the items in sotrage in order to level to the point where their items<br/>
don&#39;t matter as much?  &quot;I am a 5th level monk with a Vox and a Serpentine<br/>
bracer, split paw gloves, etc...  I can kill anything in this zone, but I<br/>
can&#39;t get any XP.&quot;  (This e-mail was in response to a 5th level monk I saw<br/>
in the Queynos hills who did have a Serpentine and a Vox bracer among high<br/>
level items.)  It would solve some problems, I think.  Just my 2 cents worth.<br/>
