&gt;         Hmph... Finally hit 20 last night (well, technically it was this<br/>
&gt; morning, I guess :) ), and I got to thinking about what life&#39;ll be like<br/>
&gt; once I get all &#39;grown up&#39;.  At this level, I&#39;m able to handle myself fairly<br/>
&gt; well as long as I don&#39;t go overboard, but the thought struck me that it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; unlikely that I&#39;ll be able to pull off some of the kills that I&#39;m seeing<br/>
&gt; other like-leveled classes do all around me - or at least not until<br/>
&gt; significantly higher levels.  I can deal with the fact that monks might not<br/>
&gt; really &#39;mature&#39; until level 30 or so, but that doesn&#39;t mean I have to like<br/>
&gt; it...<br/>
&gt;         While dwelling on this, I began to consider options which might<br/>
&gt; help me accomplish some of these same tasks.  This brought me to get down<br/>
&gt; to one of the basic difference between ourselves and our closest cousin,<br/>
&gt; the warrior.  With the right equipment, etc. the two classes can do about<br/>
&gt; equivilant damage, but while warriors can take a lot more than we can (by<br/>
&gt; virtue of their greater hit points), we can tank just as well as they can<br/>
&gt; because our forte is to handle damage coming our way by simply NOT GETTING<br/>
&gt; HIT.<br/>
&gt;         With this realization in mind, the question becomes one of<br/>
&gt; increasing our AC and resistances without violating the Prime Weight<br/>
&gt; Directive.  I&#39;ve been doing all right up to now with a full set of Woven<br/>
&gt; (exceptions: LockJaw vest, Orange Sash, Orange Headband), but I suspect<br/>
&gt; that I&#39;m outgrowing these.  This is where I hit a bit of a roadblock:<br/>
&gt; What&#39;s next on the ol&#39; armor menu, and what steps need ot be taken to<br/>
&gt; acquire it?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I believe next on the list would be Mesh.  Its equivalent to Chain (I think)<br/>
but very low weight.  Also, look for rings that increase Agility as that is<br/>
what will drive your AC up. I put all of my stat points into Agility for this<br/>
reason.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t even gotten a full set of mesh myself (I&#39;m a lowly lvl 10), just<br/>
gloves, tunic, gorget, sleeves(I think).<br/>
