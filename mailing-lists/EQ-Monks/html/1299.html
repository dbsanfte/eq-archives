<div id="ygrps-yiv-1207384496">First off, I am not twinked, every thing I got I earned the money for <br/>
myself.  As a monk this is really easy to do as monks dont have anything to <br/>
spend money on but good armor.  By the time I was 10th level, I had over 100 <br/>
plat saved, by the time I reached 18th I had bought and sold over 1000 plat <br/>
worth of stuff, all done by money and items I have earned myself by selling <br/>
loot or trade skills.  One good one is mesh.  Poke your head into Guk and <br/>
you can just about get that stuff free off of the people in there....they <br/>
have it comming out of thier ears.  I would also rather have things like a <br/>
spiked collar (easily obtainable in Black Burrow) than the cured silk <br/>
counterpart.  Man, I give someone valuble information, such as the location <br/>
to where he can find a list of just about EVERY item a monk can wear, what <br/>
the stats are and more importantly where he can get them and how much they <br/>
usually sell for, so he can judge whether or not they are obtainable or not, <br/>
and you jump me with an offensive letter like this?  Learn some manners.<br/>
What I am tired is, people like you jumping to conclutions when you have <br/>
absolutely no idea what you are talking about.  The worst part is, I wasn&#39;t <br/>
insulting his armor, I was offering good, helpfull information.  I never <br/>
said ANYTHING like &quot;oh well cure silk is crap compaired to Shiverback, you <br/>
should get a full suit of that&quot;.  If you knew anything, you yourself would <br/>
know there are little peices people can pick up here and there to improve <br/>
over something as rudimentary as cured silk is.<br/>
Anyway, do yourself a favor, think before you type...and maybe you should <br/>
check on stomped, you might find there is a peice of armor you could easily <br/>
replace with something better.  Getting eq doesn&#39;t always involve camping <br/>
45+ mobs.  Anyway.<br/>

&gt;I&#39;m sorry, but what are you talking about?  Herrick is a level 12 monk <br/>
&gt;talking<br/>
&gt;about saving up scarab carapaces for 1.7gp each!  Do you think this guy has<br/>
&gt;30pp to go buy a bracer of erolisi? or 100pp to get a silver-plated bracer?<br/>
&gt;Please tell me what armor better than cured even a level 18 can go get?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m just a little tired of people who are twinked telling new players what<br/>
&gt;they<br/>
&gt;should be wearing:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;oh, man, that cured hat sucks, go get a froglock crown&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;There is a lot better stuff that Harrick can get, but he definitely<br/>
&gt;shouldn&#39;t worry<br/>
&gt;about it now.  He has to get to 30 or so first.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;There is a TON of armor better than cured silk, I think the only place on <br/>
&gt;my<br/>
&gt; &gt;monk that is still wearing cured is my Cured Silk Ghi (cause I just LOVE <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt;way my female monk looks wearing it)  but every other location has a <br/>
&gt;better<br/>
&gt; &gt;amrmor peice.  Goto EQ Stomped and they have a special section on monk <br/>
&gt;armor<br/>
&gt; &gt;and you can compare and contrast them, and see what you want to hunt for<br/>
&gt; &gt;next.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Hi all,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;I&#39;m a level 12 monk who now has a full set of cured and some wu&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;gauntlets. (It took long enough to save up)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;The thing is I don&#39;t have a clue what to buy next? The only better <br/>
&gt;armour I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;know of is that Plane of Fear, Shiverback stuff.. At level 12, I think <br/>
&gt;not.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;So I guess that leaves earrings and rings? What should I go for? I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;currently have no earrings and two +2 dex rings, + 1 AC derv rings..<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Any suggestions welcomed!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;PS I have discovered a useful (bug?) Scarab (sand/Giant) carapaces <br/>
&gt;weigh<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;0.0kgs. You can solo these at about level 10, and since the loot <br/>
&gt;doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;weigh anything it&#39;s all good! (Ok at higher levels 1.7gp per shell <br/>
&gt;isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;going to get anyone very excited is it!)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Cheers,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
