<b>Subject:</b> Re: Q&#39; about Netted/Mesh <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-139267733">Ah, where to start?<br/>
<br/>
First, you don&#39;t make netted or mesh armor.  Certain critters drop it in the <br/>
finished state.<br/>
<br/>
Second, there is a rather plentiful supply of mesh/woven/netted fairly near <br/>
Freeport, but you have to travel through a fairly dangerous desert to get <br/>
there.  If you can find a guide through North Ro, Oasis, and South Ro, you <br/>
can get to the swamp where the froglocks roam.   These are the creatures <br/>
that drop netted and rarely some woven armor.  If you can find a decent spot <br/>
them, you can amass a good amount of netted in a short time.   Woven and <br/>
Mesh armor, while better, is found on higher level frogloks in the dungeon <br/>
of Guk, which is off of that swamp.<br/>
<br/>
Thirdly, the Qeynos sewers do have frogloks in them, but getting to Qeynos <br/>
from Freeport is pretty dangerous at your level (hey, no risk no reward, <br/>
right?).   If you have a good guide (preferably a druid), you should be able <br/>
to make it, but it&#39;s a very long journey.   However, there are only 3, count <br/>
&#39;em, 3 froglocks in the sewers.  They are often camped by low level monks of <br/>
Qeynos, but just keep checking back until they are free.   Again, you&#39;ll <br/>
probably need a guide to show you exactly where in the sewers to hunt the <br/>
froggies.<br/>
<br/>
The choice?   Getting to Qeynos is probably harder than getting to the area <br/>
around Guk, BUT once you get to Qeynos it&#39;s considerably safer hunting for <br/>
netted.  The sewers are a low level dungeon and not much will come after <br/>
you.   However, there the swamp has far more frogloks to kill so the netted <br/>
should come faster.   It&#39;s all about personal preference at that point.   I <br/>
personally would head to the swamp to hunt there, but some people like to <br/>
hunt near their bind points (you can be bound right outside the sewers, <br/>
whereas the swamp is four zones away from a city).<br/>
<br/>
Of course, you can get this info from higher level monks on your server.  <br/>
I&#39;ve found monks to be pretty open to helping each other out.<br/>

&gt;Hail Brother&#39;s & Sisters,<br/>
&gt;Also, I am a Freeport monk, I hear much talk about the sewers of &gt;Qeynos <br/>
&gt;(think that is the place) But nothing of were to hunt for the &gt;creatures I <br/>
&gt;am looking for in my area. (Here is a VERY New&#39;b Q, If i &gt;do need to go to <br/>
&gt;Qeynos, how do i get there, by boat or try it &gt;overland?)<br/>
&gt;I thank you all in advance for your time.<br/>
