<div id="ygrps-yiv-9998710">To tell you the truth, I think it&#39;s kinda a stupid arguement, there really <br/>
isn&#39;t much you can do about it, you can either play everquest and put up <br/>
with it, or don&#39;t play everquest and not have to worry about it.  Though I <br/>
know there is probably some people out there, that even if they didn&#39;t play <br/>
everquest, the idea of Twinking would still keep them up at nights.  Arguing <br/>
about it, whether it is for or against, is counter productive.  So get on <br/>
with it, and instead of typing flames on the mailing lists, you should be in <br/>
the game playing your character.  :)<br/>

&gt; &gt;It&#39;s sorta funny to see morals are getting involved now.  The thread has<br/>
&gt; &gt;gone full circle.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;That was my entire point of posting my initial and subsequent e-mails.  I<br/>
&gt;enjoy a stimulating debate.<br/>
