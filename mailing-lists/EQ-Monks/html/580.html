<b>Subject:</b> Re: Gargoyles&#39; level and some info on Mistmoore <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1167408465">Several of the Grinning Gargs are even to my level 23 ranger, so I&#39;d have to say<br/>
that they range from 21 to 24 or so.  The sneering are 24 up to 28-  (pretty<br/>
sure) and the Flouting are 31 to 35 (not one green-all blue-to my level 42<br/>
cleric- level 30s are green).<br/>
<br/>
Mistmoore is know for it&#39;s trains.  Worst train tracks I&#39;ve ever seen- if you<br/>
are 20s-30s pull to the top of the lake, 30-high 30s stick to the graveyard, 40+<br/>
go into the castle.  This way you are out of the range of most trains.  Most of<br/>
the trains come screaming out of the castle through the tunnel entrance because<br/>
the level 40+ PC jumped from the bridge that connects the from and back fo the<br/>
castle (by the lake).<br/>
<br/>
However, if you are 30+, this zone has a lot of great items and great exp.  This<br/>
is the one zone that I can say for sure has not been fully explored yet<br/>
(although there are some parts of Sol A & B that are pretty untouched still<br/>
too).  There are just so many hidden tunnels here.  The other thing is that<br/>
everything is agro (unless you are in wolf form, then only a few are agro),<br/>
unless you have not fought here and there is no racial/religion faction hits.<br/>
I&#39;m sure a bunch of dark elves could walk through this whole zone without<br/>
getting attacked, but I&#39;ve never seen it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Flouting Gargs also appear in Lower Guk, btw.<br/>

&gt;Mistmoore gargoyles that I fought/saw when Level 26 (in group):<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Grinning - blue-ish<br/>
&gt;Sneering - white-ish<br/>
&gt;Flouting - red, red, red...<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Not sure of the Flouting level, but 2 were pulled to the zone line by a party<br/>
 </span></blockquote>of 40ish &gt;players, along with other Castle nasties.  If you hear a high level<br/>
party shout &quot;Train to &gt;zone&quot;, play it safe and get out of there.  There may be<br/>
more gargoyle types...but I&#39;m not &gt;ready to try them out yet at 28...</div>
