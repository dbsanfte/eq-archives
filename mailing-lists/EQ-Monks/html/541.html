<div id="ygrps-yiv-537283278">I did not plan on it, I was just wondering where they were I had never heard<br/>
of them before, as for Unrest, that place is really difficult and I had to<br/>
zone a million times to tell you the truth.<br/>

Brother monk,<br/>
<br/>
The Nybright sisters will serve as no obstacle to one of your training. Even<br/>
through fourteen orders of training, I have considered them less than equal<br/>
to<br/>
the task of one on one combat. Your abilities are best served in the undead<br/>
depths of Unrest or the outlying Cauldron. It would be my hope that no monk<br/>
among us would go so far as to take the life of a fellow human in order to<br/>
gain<br/>
some modicum of advancement. Our talents are best reserved for defending<br/>
those<br/>
less fortunate from the hordes of undead and staving off attacks from those<br/>
beast that are less civilized than we and which aggressively pursue us<br/>
unprovoked. I wish you good fortune in your travels. <br/>
