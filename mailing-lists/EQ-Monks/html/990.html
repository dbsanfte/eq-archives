<b>Subject:</b> monk or warrior <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-308673549">I am thinking of starting a monk or warrior.  The main deciding factors for <br/>
me are how much hp each have and how many hits they can take.  Can monks <br/>
take more hits than warriors if they use mend and have high agility?  Which <br/>
can dish out more damage up until level 30 or so?  Thanx for any answers in <br/>
advance.  i am kind of leaning towards warrior though since all the bad <br/>
stuff i heard about FD now.</div>
