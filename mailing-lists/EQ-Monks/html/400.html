<div id="ygrps-yiv-1010029358">Oh, it&#39;s so great in Asheron&#39;s Call, everyone does look different.  Maybe they will <br/>
include new graphics in the expansion set?<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; For enhanced graphics,  I  think there should be an optional download...<br/>
&gt; maybe some people would want to download  a 300 MB file.  I know i would<br/>
&gt; want to. Im tired of everyone looking the same anyhow.  I hear that in<br/>
&gt; Asheron&#39;s Call everyone looks much different from each other than they do in<br/>
&gt; EQ.  Maybe the next EQ addon will address this (if there is one, more $ for<br/>
&gt; Verant).<br/>
