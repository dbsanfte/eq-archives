<div id="ygrps-yiv-24913058">: tells a quick story of woe<br/>
<br/>
Once uopn a time there was a Monk who was going to Freepoet after getting<br/>
her red headband in Qeynos she was all the way to the west Commans when she<br/>
happened upon a hill Giant who decided to step on her.  She feigned death<br/>
the Giant thinking he had killed our heroine walk off and started crushing<br/>
people in derv camp which was was pretty far  away she could barely see it<br/>
in the distance.  Rather hurt the Monk stood and mended her wounds.  The<br/>
Giant who was no were near her can RUNNING BACK and procceded to kill her.<br/>
She rewake in Qeynos were she was bound and started the long run back to the<br/>
commans and her body woundering why the Hill Giant came running back just<br/>
for her.<br/>
<br/>
The end.<br/>
<br/>
: Adds a quick almost tale of Woe<br/>
<br/>
Later while she was in East Karana she was jumped by a goruge hound she ran<br/>
to the gaurds already hurt and bleeding from a fight with a Gnoll, seeing<br/>
the gurads of the fishing village (though they were trying there best to<br/>
kill it) would not be able to before it killed her in time she feigned<br/>
death.  The hound looked at her for a moment and walked off she opened an<br/>
eye and looked around for a few minutes to make sure it was NO WERE in sight<br/>
before standing up she even had time to sit down to try to heal when all of<br/>
a sudden IT CAME RUNNING BACK!  Luckally the gurads were able to slay the<br/>
thing in time (lived by 23 hps).<br/>
<br/>
The end (for real this time)<br/>
<br/>
So heres the question: ummmm is this whats soposed to happen?<br/>
