<b>Subject:</b> please enough on twinking <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1308647559">no disresecpt intended to all the messages on twinking, but we get your <br/>
point now. many people think twinking is bad. many have no problem with it. <br/>
both sides make good points......<br/>
<br/>
....but please remeber that this is message service is about monks, and not <br/>
twinking. a few messages ok, but i got all of your points.<br/>
<br/>
yes i could just delete them, but i get this in digest form, and by this <br/>
point its a little annoying to scroll through 25 messages only to see more <br/>
than half not related directly to monk topics.<br/>
<br/>
thank you.</div>
