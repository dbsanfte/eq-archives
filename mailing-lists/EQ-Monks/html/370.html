<div id="ygrps-yiv-139410124"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;It&#39;s a little late to change the looks of characters (i.e.: adding the blue<br/>
&gt;look to monks with a mesh tunic, etc) because it would require a total<br/>
&gt;rework of the art files. Anyone remember those lovely 300 meg downloads in<br/>
&gt;beta 3?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure I understand this.  Didn&#39;t they add an entire zone (or maybe<br/>
it&#39;s even more than one zone, I don&#39;t know), the plane of fear?  Did we<br/>
download everything necessary for that zone?  If so, I find it difficult to<br/>
believe that a few new texture would be that large an addition.<br/>
