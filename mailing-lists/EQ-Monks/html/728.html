<div id="ygrps-yiv-210495541">Black pearls are a rare drop off of level 30ish mobs, or so I&#39;ve been told.<br/>
I got mine off of an Avocet near the Aviak village and got a very nice +7<br/>
dex/agi gold choker made with it. I was level 23 in a group of 5, including<br/>
a level 27 druid and 28 wizard. Those suckers hit HARD, so I don&#39;t think I&#39;d<br/>
be able to solo one until 30, 31, maybe, if then. A friend also got a black<br/>
pearl off of a Centaur Corser (sp?). And like someone else mentioned<br/>
already, griffs seem to drop them too. They&#39;re rare, so just have to keep<br/>
working at it.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

&gt;Black pearls come from Aviak Avocets right?  I have killed all the<br/>
&gt;avocets I really want to kill and have never gotten a black pearl.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;How rare of these suckers?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also, Quillmane seems to have some decent Monk equipment, do you<br/>
&gt;take a faction hit for killing him?  The equipment is no_drop.<br/>
