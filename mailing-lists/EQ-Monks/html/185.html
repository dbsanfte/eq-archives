<div id="ygrps-yiv-2141963973">I only have one thing to say here, about the taunt thing.  All of our <br/>
secondary attacks are also taunts. AND if you keep trying to disarm a mob, <br/>
even if they don&#39;t have a weapon, well, there&#39;s another taunt.  I was <br/>
recently in a party with a lvl 36 warrior, myself being lvl 31 and had NO <br/>
problem taking dmg if I wanted to.  I do agree they should beef up our hits <br/>
now a little bit though.</div>
