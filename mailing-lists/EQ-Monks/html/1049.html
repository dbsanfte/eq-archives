 </span></blockquote>To be blunt, you&#39;re much too low level to be worried about this. Having<br/>
250pp at your level is phenomenal. Serpentine bracers for 800pp a pair is a<br/>
fine deal (I was shocked to get mine for 700pp).<br/>
<br/>
I assume you have either a full set of mesh or cured silk. What you should<br/>
do with that 250pp is look for good values - items that will provide the<br/>
most benefit for the lowest cost.<br/>
<br/>
Examples:<br/>
<br/>
Jagged bands (5AC, +3 STR) - 25-60pp each<br/>
Gold carnelian rings (+5 AGI) - 30pp each<br/>
Gold amber earrings (+3 STR) - 30-40pp each<br/>
<br/>
Do the headband and sash quests at least up to red headband and orange<br/>
sash. These aren&#39;t great stat boosting items, but they&#39;re easy to get<br/>
(though you&#39;d better hurry and get the red headband before Infected Paw<br/>
goes wild).<br/>
<br/>
Forget about buying anything that comes out of Guk, because everything from<br/>
there is pricey.<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line: do the research, check the websites, and compile a list of<br/>
items in your price range. Then go look for them at the best prices you can<br/>
find. When you see a fair deal, go for it.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I think it is sad, that if I am going to be a<br/>
&gt;successful adventurer, I am going to have to be like the rest of the money<br/>
&gt;grubbing classes:  Rogues, Shadow Knights,  Warriors, Druids, Shamans,<br/>
&gt;Rangers, Bards,  Enchanters, Wizards, Magicians, Necromancers,  holy<br/>
&gt;Clerics and pious Paladins.  Does anyone else see a problem with this?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Monks live in the same world as all the other classes, and are a part of<br/>
the same economy. There&#39;s nothing evil about that.<br/>
<br/>
The fact is that once you get into your 20&#39;s, money gets a lot easier to<br/>
come by. I&#39;m level 26 now, and a night in the Highkeep basement nets me<br/>
10-20pp over a 3 hour period. Even more now that I&#39;m starting to join the<br/>
warrior room groups, as they drop fine steel weapons sometimes. Be patient.<br/>
You&#39;ll make money without having to lower yourself to the level of a<br/>
shadowknight.<br/>
