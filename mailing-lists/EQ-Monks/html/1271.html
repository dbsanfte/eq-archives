<b>Subject:</b> What to buy? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-837687321">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a level 12 monk who now has a full set of cured and some wu&#39;s <br/>
gauntlets. (It took long enough to save up)<br/>
<br/>
The thing is I don&#39;t have a clue what to buy next? The only better armour I <br/>
know of is that Plane of Fear, Shiverback stuff.. At level 12, I think not.<br/>
<br/>
So I guess that leaves earrings and rings? What should I go for? I <br/>
currently have no earrings and two +2 dex rings, + 1 AC derv rings..<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions welcomed!<br/>
<br/>
PS I have discovered a useful (bug?) Scarab (sand/Giant) carapaces weigh <br/>
0.0kgs. You can solo these at about level 10, and since the loot doesn&#39;t <br/>
weigh anything it&#39;s all good! (Ok at higher levels 1.7gp per shell isn&#39;t <br/>
going to get anyone very excited is it!)<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
