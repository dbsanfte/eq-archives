<b>Subject:</b> Bind Wound now goes to 201 <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-777085179">Well, I&#39;m about halfway through 51, have had my bind wound skill capped at 200 for quite awhile prior expansion.  Then last night, BAM!  Got it to 201, which now allows me to bandage anybody to 70% hps at 75 hps a bandage.  KICK ASS SKILL!  I can&#39;t emphasized this enough.  This means when soloing or grouping w/o a healer type, we can get MAX hps from 1 hp after a fight in at very most, 6 min.  Just bandage up to 70% (can get higher, just can&#39;t bandage after you&#39;ve past the 70% line) and then hit mend, tah dah, full hps.  Just wanted to let all you guys know what&#39;s in store for us  :o)<br/>
