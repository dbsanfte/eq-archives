<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1945515505">I agree with some of the previous statements. At lvl 30, much more frequent <br/>
quadruple attacks coupled with Flying Kick seems to make a BIG difference, <br/>
and puts the monk on much more equal footing with other melee classes. At lvl <br/>
30, I could generally outdamage all but the very best equipped warriors of <br/>
the same lvl.<br/>
