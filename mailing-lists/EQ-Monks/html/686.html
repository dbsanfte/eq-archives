<br/>
A question of my more accomplished fellows: where might I find good solo<br/>
hunting at level 25? I fear that I&#39;ve been driving myself insane trying to<br/>
keep up with friends in my regular group (where they find the time to level<br/>
the way they do is beyond me &lt;g&gt;) and I&#39;m letting the joy of the game seep<br/>
out (and I play on the Test Server so it&#39;s sometimes very difficult to find<br/>
a group). I&#39;d like information on some places where I could possibly keep up<br/>
my development at my own pace. Alas, I realize EQ is meant to be a group<br/>
game, and I will group when I&#39;m able, but rather than quit playing entirely,<br/>
I&#39;ll have to spend some solo time.  Any input would be greatly appreciated!<br/>
