<div id="ygrps-yiv-1504937765">let me add a bit here.  Last night I was sitting..minding my own<br/>
business...right at the zone to qeynos..you know the place....right<br/>
next to that bug where you get bounced back to the hills when someone<br/>
is zoning at the same time as you....<br/>
anyway i am just sitting there medding and talking when out of nowhere<br/>
i get smacked by a werewolf!! there were several other ppl standing<br/>
close to me too so i think it spawned right there as i was sitting<br/>
there.  so yeah...I think there is a spawn spot there.   and as luck<br/>
would have it i have killed 3 werewolves ever and NONE of them ever<br/>
dropped a damn thing!  worthless things they are :p<br/>

&gt; That is a separate spawn site.  I don&#39;t know if it is static though<br/>
&gt; there is a werewolf spawn in that area.<br/>

&gt; &gt; If you don&#39;t mind a long boring camp, werewolves spawn at the<br/>
&gt; qeynos<br/>
&gt; &gt; hills zone in west karana.  They are a little less frequent than<br/>
&gt; one per night<br/>
&gt; &gt; but I&#39;ve seen them as early as 7PM and as late as 5AM.  Claws are<br/>
&gt; VERY<br/>
&gt; &gt; rare.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hi all, I have decided that it is time for me to complete something<br/>
&gt; I have<br/>
&gt; &gt; set out to do for quite some time. And that is to get a freaking<br/>
&gt; Werewolf<br/>
&gt; &gt; claw. Now being one that does not like to run around in the stupid<br/>
&gt; West<br/>
&gt; &gt; Commonlands, or West Karana asking repetitively anyone have a<br/>
&gt; werewolf on<br/>
&gt; &gt; tracking let me know! I got so bored and tired so I have decided to<br/>
&gt; go to<br/>
&gt; &gt; Mistmoore and try to get to the dance floor. Now I have been to MM<br/>
&gt; quite a<br/>
&gt; &gt; few times but I have never been inside the castle barely even down<br/>
&gt; the ramp<br/>
&gt; &gt; towards the castle. mainly the Grave Yard and the zone line. Now I<br/>
&gt; would<br/>
&gt; &gt; like some help on any suggestions or tips as to what to go or how<br/>
&gt; to go<br/>
&gt; &gt; about getting to the Dance Room with the Gypsies/Werewolves....i.e.<br/>
&gt; party<br/>
&gt; &gt; make up and level or a site where there might be a map. Thanks for<br/>
&gt; your<br/>
&gt; &gt; help.<br/>
