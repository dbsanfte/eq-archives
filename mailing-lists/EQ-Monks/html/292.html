<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-888618785">Unfortunately, yes FP (free Port) is teh closest bind spot other than the<br/>
areana in Lake rathe: lake rathe -&gt; RAthe mountains (cyclops and giant<br/>
skells, lizard men and grizzlies - all bad for a level 7) -&gt;Ferroot<br/>
(spectres, BOUNCER FLERB *I spit on  his grave!* and various skeletons,<br/>
not to mention lizard men) -&gt; innothule -&gt; Guk.  This may be one zone<br/>
shorter, but ALL of these zones are risky to a level 20 character, not to<br/>
mention a level 7.  <br/>
	Conversely, in the FP route, the only real risky part<br/>
is the run through south Ro where the orc and derv camps can mean death.<br/>
THis is easily overcome - just get an SOW.  I see alot of people who don&#39;t<br/>
know how to get an SOW.  Basically, auctioning in the zone or shouting out<br/>
is pointless, noone wants to take the time to FIND you to get give you an<br/>
SOW.  waht you  have to do is be on the look out for Barbarians carrying<br/>
blunt weapons and wearing chain (shamen) or leather clad elves and half<br/>
elves carrying blunt weapons or maybe a scimitar and a shield (druids).<br/>
You walk up to them and politely ask for an SOW.  You will get one 99% of<br/>
the time.  best place to look for them is OAsis, this is where some of the<br/>
higher level ones will hang out.  <br/>

&gt; Adventuring in Guk was recently mentioned in the 7th Level Qeynos Blues,<br/>
&gt; and that reminded me of a question I have been meaning to ask.  Where is<br/>
&gt; the nearest place to get bound for adventuring in Guk for a Monk (of<br/>
&gt; course)?  Freeport?  North Ro -&gt; Oasis of Marr -&gt; South Ro -&gt; Innotule<br/>
&gt; Swamp -&gt; Guk = Not fun.  Anything closer?<br/>
