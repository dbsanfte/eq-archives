<b>Subject:</b> Re: Hunting wisps <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-574772108">I hunt wisps in West Comm and, with a partner, find at<br/>
leats one every 3 or 4 minutes. Sometimes we take on 3<br/>
or more at once. West Comm is very wisp friendly. You<br/>
do have valid points about YKs and other beasties<br/>
though. I doubt you can risk West Comm at your level.<br/>
That is the best place I have seen them so far.<br/>
Although... there is an alternative. Get on the boat<br/>
from free port and get off at the first stop. This<br/>
island has many wisps and not much else. (Don&#39;t attack<br/>
spiders, they swarm.)<br/>
<br/>
Try that island.<br/>
