<div id="ygrps-yiv-1862520159">I think that monks should be a little subdued as far as magical abilities<br/>
go.  After all, we&#39;re supposed to have turned our bodies into living<br/>
weapons.  :)  Some items that give big increases to Dodge, or Block (Gloves<br/>
or Bracers of Blocking, perhaps?) would be much more appropriate to the way<br/>
I feel the class should be.  No flashy magics.  Perhaps a Jump ability<br/>
enabling you to jump across distances, or reach higher things.<br/>
<br/>
I recently sold all of my items (Raean,18th level monk on Tunare) and am<br/>
going to be hanging around Freeport helping newbies out when I want to take<br/>
a break from my other characters.  I just got too bored.  I already had full<br/>
mesh with a Lockjaw Tunic. I was pretty much set until I could get into Fear<br/>
and get shiverback (silverback?) armor, didn&#39;t have a regular group, and had<br/>
trouble finding ones all the time, so I was forced to solo.  Just got<br/>
disillusioned with being a Monk.  I loved being able to dish out damage, and<br/>
not needing to spend a billion platinum to get things, but it&#39;d be nice to<br/>
get some &quot;cool stuff&quot; during the next 30 levels, besides new jewelry.<br/>
<br/>
Just my two cents.</div>
