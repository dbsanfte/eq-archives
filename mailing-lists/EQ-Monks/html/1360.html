<div id="ygrps-yiv-968573445">Gday Clarity, Borix/Minimus/Drexal/Sparx here. Good ta see ya round,<br/>
you&#39;ve been pretty quiet recently.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I&#39;m sorry, but what are you talking about?  Herrick is a level 12 monk talking<br/>
&gt;about saving up scarab carapaces for 1.7gp each!  Do you think this guy has<br/>
&gt;30pp to go buy a bracer of erolisi? or 100pp to get a silver-plated bracer?<br/>
&gt;Please tell me what armor better than cured even a level 18 can go get?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m just a little tired of people who are twinked telling new players what <br/>
&gt;they<br/>
&gt;should be wearing:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;oh, man, that cured hat sucks, go get a froglock crown&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;There is a lot better stuff that Harrick can get, but he definitely <br/>
&gt;shouldn&#39;t worry<br/>
&gt;about it now.  He has to get to 30 or so first.<br/>

friends then twink away.  Yes, it&#39;s kind of pathetic, but has anyone<br/>
looked at Oasis lately.  Twink-o-rama.  Get the gear yourself and<br/>
you&#39;ll like it more, buy or trade for it and you&#39;ll still be happy.<br/>
Just find it strange that people think item collection is the be-all<br/>
and end-all of the game.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Dude, don&#39;t bother paying 50pp for Wu&#39;s, especially if you only have<br/>
&gt;11.  Wu&#39;s aren&#39;t that helpful.  If I were you I would go for a Lockjaw<br/>
&gt;vest and maybe some jewelry.  Wait till later for wu&#39;s.  I held out and<br/>
&gt;found a guy selling them at cost, 19pp.  My lucky day =)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also, at least on Karana, there are many high level tailors who will<br/>
&gt;make them for nothing if you find the ingrediants.  Just find a<br/>
&gt;potter/enchanter for that vial of viscous mana, everything else is easy.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Open invitation to anyone on Karana:  If you get the components I&#39;ll<br/>
enchant the vial for free.  Be warned my pottery skill is nonexistsent<br/>
so you&#39;ll need to bring the components.<br/>
