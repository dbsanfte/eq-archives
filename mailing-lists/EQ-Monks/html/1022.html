<div id="ygrps-yiv-2036720173">Just sent this off to Brad and Smedley... was hoping that if <br/>
others felt as I do, we could continue to work them in a similar <br/>
manner.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. McQuaid,<br/>
	I have just finished reading your rather long and impassioned <br/>
eMail/Producer letter on the topic of Everquest&#39;s evolution.  I found <br/>
it to be one of the most effective communications from any game <br/>
company to its customers that I have ever read, and for that I <br/>
congratulate you.  I hope that people read it, think about it, and <br/>
take away from it that which you intended: that the EQ team cares <br/>
deeply about Norrath and its citizens.<br/>
	As a software developer myself (although truthfully, I don&#39;t <br/>
do as much actual development as I&#39;d like any more - I tend to spend <br/>
more time in the design and management process these days), I also <br/>
understand that there must be a primary focus to every project.  For <br/>
me, this doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that the primary goal be &quot;create <br/>
the best possible system&quot;... it goes beyond that to a deeper goal: <br/>
&quot;Make sure that the client is happy&quot;.  Sometimes this involves <br/>
difficult and painful decisions, Herculean efforts, and the ability <br/>
to case aside profit considerations at times in order to fight for <br/>
what is ultimately the best way to solve any given problem.<br/>
	I suspect that you and your team have a similar goal, except <br/>
yours would be to keep your subscriber base happy and to attract new <br/>
members to that subscriber base.  Another parallel between what we do <br/>
is that our clients (or subscribers, in your case) don&#39;t always know <br/>
what it is that will truly make them happy or are at loggerheads <br/>
about what any particular change might do to forward that goal <br/>
(witness how many people cannot even agree on whether or not an item <br/>
on your recently released change list is a &quot;+&quot; or a &quot;-&quot;.)<br/>
	Most of us understand that tuning needs to take place.  If <br/>
things were too easy, then there would be no challenge to life in <br/>
Norrath and therefore there would be little enjoyment of the <br/>
surmounting of those challenges.  If one class is too powerful, a <br/>
surfeit of players using that class results, just as a underpowered <br/>
or less useful class suffers a dearth of interested participants. <br/>
The fact that it requires a group of people to do most worthwhile <br/>
things in EQ is one of the more attractive things about the game <br/>
(although there are of course those who would argue that this is also <br/>
one of its greatest downfalls).  The fact that each and every class - <br/>
once it reaches maturity - can bring something unique to a group is a <br/>
wonderful and fragile thing.  Adjusting the balance of the classes so <br/>
that their value to such a group is maintained is a task of <br/>
monumental delicacy, and your efforts at maintaining this balance <br/>
should be commended.<br/>
	Unfortunately, as people are by definition human, mistakes <br/>
are occasionally made.  Over time, the development team has <br/>
recognized some of these mistakes and have made efforts to address <br/>
them.  By way of example, Warriors got some serious boosts some time <br/>
ago, and with the introduction of the expansion, the presence of a <br/>
Rogue in a well-rounded party will become very important indeed. <br/>
These were both well-considered and well-deserved changes, and the <br/>
players of those classes have (or will have) reaped the rewards of <br/>
these changes over the course of time.<br/>
	Other classes who have been &#39;nerfed&#39; may complain <br/>
vociferously about it, but if they go over those issues which <br/>
generated the most complaints (kiting, pet damage, etc) I think that <br/>
people will realize that while these changes were made to the <br/>
possible detriment of the solo player, they were certainly done to <br/>
enhance the value and necessity of other classes in a group.  If this <br/>
was indeed your goal, then I must certainly say that your mission has <br/>
been accomplished.<br/>
	With this in mind, I am still at a loss to explain why the <br/>
Feign Death skill for Monks was recently so seriously altered.  I <br/>
understand your reasons for doing what you did, but the consequence <br/>
is that the usefulness of a Monk in higher-level (40+) groups has <br/>
been seriously compromised.  True, we can do the damage of a <br/>
decently-equipped warrior, but that&#39;s it.  The warrior offers so much <br/>
more to a group (stun, taunt, the ability to take huge amounts of <br/>
damage, etc) that the role of a monk has been diminished greatly. <br/>
The one thing that we could bring to a group - that of feign-pulling <br/>
- has for all practical purposes been eliminated and replaced with a <br/>
reputation for being the &quot;Master Train Engineers&quot;.  For this reason, <br/>
monks are beginning to be refused entry into impromptu groups because <br/>
they do not bring anything special and are often dangerous companions.<br/>
	As a level 50 monk, I no longer use FD for fear that on those <br/>
occasions where it is necessary, I&#39;ll end up wiping out half the zone <br/>
as I get up to work my way back to a zone point.  I would far rather <br/>
die individually than wipe out other innocent players in a ploy to <br/>
save my own skin - and have now done so on a number of occasions.<br/>
	How has this change made your player base happier?  How has <br/>
it enhanced the role of a Monk in a group?  How has it positively <br/>
affected group dynamics?  I really want to understand what the <br/>
desired affect of this change was... perhaps if I did, I could lose <br/>
the bitter taste in my mouth and not continually toy with the idea of <br/>
dropping out of Norrath in disappointment.  As it is, I only stay so <br/>
that I can help twink up friends.<br/>
	Don&#39;t get me wrong, I am not saying that Norrath is an <br/>
impossible place to live in without Monks being able to Feign in <br/>
their accustomed fashion.  Groups will just load up on more Warriors <br/>
or Paladins in their stead, and the more difficult areas of Norrath <br/>
that could previously be handled by a single well-organized and <br/>
balanced group will now have to be taken by multiple groups just <br/>
charging in willy-nilly with no plan more sophisticated than &quot;kill <br/>
this one first, then that one, and if we&#39;re still left alive, we go <br/>
for that other one last.&quot;<br/>
	I understand that your decision is made and that further <br/>
revision to the Feign Death mechanics is unlikely.  I am not <br/>
therefore asking for you to do so - your team seems to be happy with <br/>
FD in its current form, and we as players should respect that and <br/>
make our own decisions accordingly.  I just wanted to ask for a brief <br/>
explanation of the motivations behind this change and to also bring <br/>
again to your attention the fact that the balance you strive for is <br/>
an exceedingly delicate thing that is all to easily thrown out of <br/>
kilter by even the best-intentioned and well-discussed changes.<br/>
	Thank you for your time.<br/>
