<div id="ygrps-yiv-440750268">I have completed the quest yesterday, with a tailoring skill of 36, and I<br/>
got the trivial message. BUT I know a monk who failed with the exact same<br/>
skill, and lost all the items. I I heard about some fellow monks who<br/>
succeeded with a skill in the low 20s, and got the trivial message too. So,<br/>
my guess is that the robe is always trivial, but if you have a VERY bad<br/>
luck, you can fail. That is a risk you must be aware of.<br/>
Next step, the Treant Fists !!<br/>
