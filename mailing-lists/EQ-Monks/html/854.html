&gt;What is everyones opinion on the best race/class combo to solo? Can any<br/>
&gt;classes solo all the way to 50?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>         The only class that CAN&#39;T Solo all the way to 50 is a Wizard. <br/>
However, with that said, only Shamans, Druids (less so with Kiting <br/>
curtailed), Monks, Necromancers, and Shadow Knights can do it effectively. <br/>
Enchanters, Magicians, Bards, Paladins, and Rangers can do it to some <br/>
extent. Clerics and Warriors could possibly do it, but that would be <br/>
nightmarish. Wizards simply can&#39;t due to the lack of a Pet.<br/>
<br/>
         Shadow Knights are really the class that was designed with Soloing <br/>
in mind. Especially the infamous Troll Shadow Knight. Until Kiting was <br/>
restricted though, they were not the best at it. Druids USED to be the best <br/>
Solo class in the game. Now, it is a toss-up between Shamans, Druids, <br/>
Monks, Necros, and SKs.<br/>
<br/>
         Personally, I would hate to try and Solo my way to 50 as an <br/>
Enchanter. The Pets we get are weak and Charm is &quot;unstable&quot;. Don&#39;t get me <br/>
wrong, I love Charm but I like having a nice BIG Warrior right beside me to <br/>
Taunt the Mob off when Charm breaks.</div>
