<div id="ygrps-yiv-1215157219">The religious affiliation is the heart of this<br/>
problem. Ashen Order monks (like me) worship<br/>
Quellious. Silent Fist monks are agnostic. The Ashen<br/>
Order guildmasters don&#39;t care much for agnostics but<br/>
the Silent Fist monks like Ashen Order monks merely<br/>
because they are monks, they do not care who you<br/>
worship. Hence the problem. I hail from Freeport and<br/>
when I traveled west I was able to do the headband<br/>
quests before I had killed a single gnoll. Many have<br/>
said that killing orcs will raise faction with the<br/>
Ashen Order; I do not know if that is true but they<br/>
liked me to begin with. I am always willing to help<br/>
our Qeynos brothers in any way that I can so I will<br/>
turn in sash items for sashes if anyone asks.<br/>
I would say that becoming a better monk (i.e. getting<br/>
higher level headbands SHOULD raise faction with the<br/>
Ashen Order if it does not) I can only encourage more<br/>
research and for us all to be aware of what things<br/>
raise faction with which guild.<br/>
Good journeys and may Truth guide you,<br/>
