<div id="ygrps-yiv-674911984">It is a fact.  The problem is that you are saying you take off ARMOR to get <br/>
the weight down.  The AC benefit from some armor outweighs the drawbacks <br/>
from weight.  The weight factor becomes more apparent at later levels also. <br/>
 If you notice your AC fluctuating as you loot your enemies, that is the <br/>
problem.  Try filling your inventory with swords, staffs and maces you loot <br/>
from MOBs and then sell them all and notice the swing in your AC.<br/>

I am not sure where anyone got the 15 weight is the best for monks...can<br/>
someone please explain this...My AC does not change when i drop down to or<br/>
below 15, if anything it gets worse as I take my patchwork armor off. I<br/>
can&#39;t believe this nonsense about the super low weight unless you are<br/>
talking about encumbering weight. I know monks are suppose to use less than<br/>
others but I can&#39;t go on a huge hunting spree and not carry something back<br/>
to sell. Or should I be investing in items instead? Its a little hard to<br/>
invest in items on the PVP server since everyone is out to get you hehe.<br/>
Suggestions for eq would be most appriciated...where to buy cost? Thanks<br/>
