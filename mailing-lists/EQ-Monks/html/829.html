<b>Subject:</b> cured silk and other delights <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1285871388">I&#39;ve found the debate about pulling interesting, as I just reached 17th<br/>
level and can start appreciating the feign death skill. It already saved me<br/>
once today, so I&#39;m very grateful for it.<br/>
<br/>
Cured silk armor has been mentioned a bit here, but not too much. I was<br/>
curious about people&#39;s opinions on it. I for one think it&#39;s a wonderful<br/>
thing. Finally monks have a look that is unique, even at lower levels (for<br/>
those who don&#39;t know, cured silk and shiverback look the same). Cured silk<br/>
has the same AC as mesh, although it isn&#39;t magic in its native form (so<br/>
keep your mesh gloves for fighting). If you&#39;re out to buy silk armor, make<br/>
sure you&#39;re getting cured, not raw silk.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s true that cured silk doesn&#39;t provide the stats that some of the game&#39;s<br/>
unique mob-obtainable items do (silver plated bracers, Lockjaw vest, etc.),<br/>
but when Enchanters gain the ability to enchant this armor, I think it will<br/>
become one of the best armor sets in the game. Monks need stat boosts with<br/>
their equipment, since our choice in armor is so limited. Even moderate<br/>
boosts to our abilities via enchanted cured silk will be wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a little unfortunate that we don&#39;t have the ability to change the<br/>
pants to a different color, but there is room for customization. I have<br/>
cured silk on my upper body but kept mesh pants and fur-lined boots. This<br/>
gives me a black colored lower half, which I think looks better than the<br/>
yellow-tan look of all cured armor.<br/>
<br/>
Something I haven&#39;t seen mentioned on the monk web sites is Gauntlets of<br/>
Wu, another item exclusive to our class. This is a tailor-made item, which<br/>
results in magic gloves that give off the light of a greater lightstone (a<br/>
GL is required for their creation). They have the same AC as mesh. What&#39;s<br/>
the big deal, you say, I can just wear mesh gloves and carry a GL for the<br/>
same effect. True, but these gauntlets are a must for several reasons: 1)<br/>
Any monk-only item is cool to have. 2) They have a neat graphic in your<br/>
inventory. 3) Awesome name! Finally, equipment named to make sense for a<br/>
monk to have.<br/>
<br/>
After running around looking like a low-level fighter for most of the game<br/>
(even though I was supposed to be wearing magical armor), it&#39;s nice to have<br/>
a look all our own. These days I&#39;m loving being a monk.<br/>
