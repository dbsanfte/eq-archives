<div id="ygrps-yiv-1159055037">Hi, all.<br/>
<br/>
Is there ANY way to separate mobs that stack one on top the other? I was in<br/>
Najena today trying to pull the Ogre Captain. I&#39;d hit him and run back out<br/>
of the room. He would come along with one of his officers. But they were<br/>
directly on top of each other and they would consistently leave together.<br/>
What am I doing wrong?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance</div>
