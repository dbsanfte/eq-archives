<div id="ygrps-yiv-1014704564">oasis.  hunt caimens, and crocks. then by 17, you can hunt dw caimens (I&#39;m<br/>
17, and can solo some of them, if mend works)<br/>
<br/>
no loot, but great exp.  or hunt wisps, great loot, crap exp. (I went from<br/>
14 to 15 hunting wisps, and it took forever, but I made enough money that<br/>
when I went to oasis, I bought a full suit of mesh, lockjaw vest, jewlery,<br/>
and I have almost 200 pp left in the bank.  now I&#39;m looking for rare<br/>
expensive jewlery.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m a Freeport monk who just hit level 14 and am wondering what to do next.<br/>
&gt; My circuit of N Ro, E Comm, and W Comm (parts of it, anyway) have gotten me<br/>
&gt; this far, but opponents now are getting to be either too easy around there<br/>
&gt; or still way too tough, so I want a zone that&#39;s going to have a good share<br/>
&gt; of blues for me, plus whites, yellows, and realistic reds I can fight in<br/>
&gt; groups.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A 20th level Necro friend of mine wants to bring me to Highpass to help me<br/>
&gt; level quickly, but I&#39;m nervous that if he&#39;s not around I may not be able to<br/>
&gt; solo. Any thoughts on this?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anybody else have suggestions? I&#39;d prefer to stay on the eastern side of<br/>
&gt; Antonica or on Faydwer.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also, can I get some recommendations on jewelry that&#39;s in my price range?<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve got all of 30 plat to my name.<br/>
