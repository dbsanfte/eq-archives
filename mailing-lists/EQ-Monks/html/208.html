<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1167710614">Well, after achieving level 33 (by the way, if you haven&#39;t <br/>
gotten to the 30&#39;s yet and are getting discouraged playing a monk, <br/>
stick with it... it WILL be worth it and you WILL have a blast <br/>
playing this class), and having spent nearly the entire time <br/>
searching for the various items to complete the quests, I have <br/>
finally managed to acquire the Purple headband and the Red sash.<br/>
	By the way... don&#39;t even get me started on the &#39;too much <br/>
time, too little money, too much hassle for too little reward&#39; thing. <br/>
You&#39;re right.  I give in.  But for me, it&#39;s a monk thing.<br/>
	Anyway, I&#39;ve just visited the monk&#39;s guild in Freeport to <br/>
find out how to get the purple sash and found that this quest is not <br/>
yet implemented.  Unfortunately, I forgot to investigate the blue <br/>
headband quest when last I was in Qeynos.  Does this quest exist yet? <br/>
Either way, is it known when any of these unimplemented quests might <br/>
be added to the game?<br/>
	Also, a bit of a question here for ya: After having worn a <br/>
Blackened Iron Crown for the last few levels, I&#39;ve decided to dump <br/>
it.  The stat boosters are phenominal, but it was killing me in terms <br/>
of weight.  I have a rather good collection of extremely low-weight <br/>
and weight-reducing items and was STILL bordering on 18lbs in &#39;going <br/>
out to party&#39; configuration.  Obviously, this was not acceptable.  I <br/>
replaced the BIC with the aforementioned Purple Headband, which is <br/>
rather inferior, but moving from a 6Wt item to a 0Wt item has lifted <br/>
a great burden from my shoulders (literally).  I figure it&#39;ll do <br/>
until I can get an executioner&#39;s hood.<br/>
	My question is this: as far as headgear goes, am I missing <br/>
something?  There only seems to be 2 more items that are worth <br/>
considering, those being the Crown of the Froglok Kings and the Crown <br/>
of King Tranix.  Is there something else out there that would be <br/>
worth hunting after (besides the shiverback stuff, of course... but <br/>
that&#39;s WAY off)?<br/>
