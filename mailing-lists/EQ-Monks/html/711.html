hmm...let see<br/>
<br/>
1) The discussions have revolved around monk issues<br/>
2) the people dropping have never contributed<br/>
3) fills up your mailbox?  learn to use a filter<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m sure that you have all noticed that people have been dropping from<br/>
this <br/>
&gt; list like flies, and to tell the truth I&#39;m about ready to quit too.  I <br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t sign up to hear people bitch and moan about twinking and spell <br/>
&gt; nerfing.  While I&#39;m not positive, I would think that most of you didn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; sign up to hear about it either.  Yet that is what fills up my mailbox day<br/>
<br/>
&gt; in and day out now.  Please drop it and lets get back to monks before <br/>
&gt; anyone else is alienated from what used to be a worthwhile list.  If it&#39;s <br/>
&gt; really an issue for you, just create EQ-Twinkers and EQ-Nerfs mailing<br/>
lists <br/>
&gt; and carry on there.<br/>
