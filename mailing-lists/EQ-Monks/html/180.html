<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1273199927">well @lower lvls monks can&#39;t really do that much dmg and they don&#39;t have<br/>
alot of hps... pretty much just a weak tank.<br/>
however when you get feign death that helps u out. when things go wrong your<br/>
casters can gate and you can feign.<br/>
however after your casters get evac u will rarely use feign... i don&#39;t even<br/>
train it anymore cuz i hardly ever use it.<br/>
the only time i use feign now is when i go exploring or when i&#39;m try&#39;n to<br/>
sort out mobs when i&#39;m pull&#39;n.<br/>
but sorting is gett&#39;n to where it hardly works anymore because more mobs are<br/>
staying aggro on u forever.<br/>
also, if u do die.. u can get your friendly neighborhood cleric... to res u<br/>
for 75% exp return... not a bad deal. and now since everyone has bitch about<br/>
exp loss from death, they cut that in half.. making feign that much more<br/>
useless.<br/>
<br/>
i was looking forward to doing alot of dmg when i got upto higher lvls... i<br/>
figured it would make up for the lower lvl hell that a monk goes through and<br/>
the fact that we can&#39;t carry crap or wear anything that looks decent.<br/>
<br/>
but if u think your gonna be able to start the best class in the game now<br/>
and it be the best class by the time u hit 50... think again.<br/>
<br/>
this is a very politically correct game... who ever whines the most... gets<br/>
fixed up a little... so i guess it&#39;s our turn to whine *sigh*:(<br/>
its really sad we hafta do that though.<br/>
we had a really nice class b4 all the enhancements.<br/>
<br/>
i better stop this.. i&#39;m just depressing myself and several other up<br/>
incoming monks out there....:(<br/>

Wow, after all of that I&#39;m really inspired.  Is there any hope in sight for<br/>
a monk. I just started my monk and plan on taking him to a high level but if<br/>
we are pretty worthless at very high levels I might reconsider.  I really<br/>
need to know what you think of the monk class.  I don&#39;t want to start this<br/>
character and have him become useless.  Is there anything that might be<br/>
added to the class to make it better?   What do you think?<br/>

&gt; No, no!!! Don&#39;t apologize!  This has been really on my mind<br/>
&gt; for the last several days.  One of the things I accepted when I<br/>
&gt; became a monk was that I wouldn&#39;t really &#39;come into my own&#39; until<br/>
&gt; level 30 when Flying Kick became available - at which point I could<br/>
&gt; start being a more serious contributor to how the party functions.<br/>
&gt; Well, now that I&#39;m less than a bubble from that turning point, Verant<br/>
&gt; updates warriors in such a fashion so as to make monks a clearly<br/>
&gt; second-class melee type.  Consider the following notes regarding some<br/>
&gt; of the skills afforded each class:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Mend: Monks get it, warriors do not.  With a successful mend, we have<br/>
&gt; about as many HPs available to me as a warrior of a similar level.<br/>
&gt; Needless to say, we do not always have mend available, so we are<br/>
&gt; typically at a disadvantage in terms of hit points.  Result: Healers<br/>
&gt; would rather have warriors around because they don&#39;t have to heal<br/>
&gt; them as often (all else being equal).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Taunt: Monks don&#39;t get it, warriors do.  Result: Casters would rather<br/>
&gt; have a warrior around when they are getting beat on.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Armor: Monks don&#39;t get it, warriors do.  Result: All sorts of neat<br/>
&gt; bonuses and stat boosters not available to us.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Weapons: Don&#39;t get &#39;em (from a pracitical perspective).  Result: All<br/>
&gt; sorts of interesting effects we don&#39;t get to throw around.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Extra Magic Resistance: Monks don&#39;t get it, warriors do.  Result: We<br/>
&gt; are far more vulnerable to magic attacks than warriors are.  Team<br/>
&gt; members don&#39;t like this because they have to rush to your aid more<br/>
&gt; often.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Critical hit: Monks don&#39;t get it, warriors do.  Result: A warrior I<br/>
&gt; group with  (who is lower level than I am) REGULARLY criticals in the<br/>
&gt; 70-90+ range.  I can&#39;t expect to hit in the 90s until I&#39;m level 45+<br/>
&gt; (16 levels from now) and even then, it&#39;ll be a rare occurrence off of<br/>
&gt; a special attack.  Where once we had a rough parity in the amount of<br/>
&gt; damage we could do, this has been completely destroyed with the last<br/>
&gt; patch.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Monks get more hits: I don&#39;t buy it.  A warrior and a ranger I often<br/>
&gt; group with multi-hit just as often as I do and since they are using<br/>
&gt; cool double-weilded weapons, they do much more damage per hit.<br/>
&gt; Besides, the theory that more hits help break up a caster&#39;s<br/>
&gt; concentration also does not hold water.  Any decent NPC (level 25+)<br/>
&gt; will recover their concentration 9 times out of 10 and finish the job<br/>
&gt; anyway.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There is more, but I&#39;m running the danger of getting myself a<br/>
&gt; little too worked up about this.  The bottom line is that I feel as<br/>
&gt; if monks have been cheated by a too-generous tweaking of warriors.<br/>
&gt; Am I way off-base here, or do others feel as I do?<br/>
