<div id="ygrps-yiv-786347020">I have got everything except for the Needle. (I do have the headband and<br/>
the tome, and I am camped in South karanas waiting for Brother Qwinn)<br/>
Just to be sure, I have.<br/>
Shadow silk swatch<br/>
Johnathon&#39;s whistling warsong.<br/>
Rare robe pattern<br/>
large sewwing kit<br/>
+ red head band & tome of zan fi<br/>
<br/>
Now for the questions...<br/>
1. How rare is Qwinn ? it took me about 16 hours to get Br Z. more rare<br/>
? less rare ? good places to try and find him / spot him ? does he have<br/>
placeholders ? basically anyone got any low down on him ?<br/>
2. Is there still a skill check against tailoring ? (I have 0 skill in<br/>
tailoring or maybe 1)<br/>
if there is, and it fails will a GM give me either all the items again<br/>
or the robe ?<br/>
and should I petition a GM before attempting ... just in case ?<br/>
(I heard that this was fixed a few patches back but still I want to be<br/>
sure, this is hundreds of hours worth of work, I don&#39;t want to lose it)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
yay the ordeal is almost over ..... treant fists next 8(.</div>
