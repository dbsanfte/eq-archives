&gt;This is the same company that changed our version of Feign Death without any<br/>
&gt;input from the people who play the game.  Why are they suddenly asking for<br/>
&gt;opinions?  I say it should be changed, if just to level the playing field.  I<br/>
&gt;guess this goes to prove thast if you play a popular class you get special<br/>
&gt;benefits, but if you are the minority you get walked all over. Oh, well all<br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;Necros will scream that it would be unfair to take away this unbalancing &quot;bug&quot;<br/>
&gt;and we will still get stuck with our nerfed FD.<br/>

customers?  Sometimes I wish you guys would just make up your mind.<br/>
You say you want more input into the game.  Then they ask for your opinion<br/>
and you complain about that. Sheesh.</div>
