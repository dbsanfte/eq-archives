<div id="ygrps-yiv-1508303659">From what I understand, and what they are saying on the EQ-Iksar mailing <br/>
list, it will be hard for them to find someone who is NOT iksar who won&#39;t <br/>
kill them on sight.  I hear they are modifying the factions even further <br/>
down than they already are.<br/>

&gt;Try<br/>
&gt; &gt;going to Unrest at 20th or so to collect some of that FS or bronze and <br/>
&gt;hoard<br/>
&gt; &gt;it up till you are twice over your weight limit as an Iksar, then, try to<br/>
&gt; &gt;find a merchant to sell it too who wont kill you on sight.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Shelza, Karana<br/>
&gt; &gt;Berfurt, Karana<br/>
&gt;i&#39;m betting you will still be able to sell to the druid at the butcherblock <br/>
&gt;druid<br/>
&gt;ring.   i thnk that is beta neutral faction.  i know for sure, my <br/>
&gt;roommate&#39;s necro<br/>
&gt;was able to sell there and he was kos just about everywhere else.<br/>
