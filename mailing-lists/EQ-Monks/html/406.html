<div id="ygrps-yiv-1824369054">Well, since there are a few people talking about AC, I think I&#39;ll give you a<br/>
general rundown of what I&#39;ve noticed and correct a few things people have<br/>
said. At least from a monk&#39;s point of view. I won&#39;t even get into spells<br/>
cause that&#39;s a whole other bucket of worms...<br/>
<br/>
Pros:<br/>
* Can customize face and initial clothing to some extent, nice sliders and<br/>
drop boxes.<br/>
* Appearance and initial clothing choices determined by &#39;heritage&#39;, as well<br/>
as some items can be only used by one of the 3 choices.<br/>
* Auto-aim on melee means you always follow and whack the mob/player that<br/>
you are attacking (many PvPers on EQ should be drooling over this)<br/>
* Can decide which weapons, if any, you would like to specialize in, and<br/>
only a few can&#39;t be used unless trained<br/>
* Unarmed combat actually lets you use some weapons, so it&#39;s not really<br/>
unarmed combat...<br/>
* Fighters can get nifty elemental weapons with ice/fire/lightning/acid<br/>
coming off of them so that they don&#39;t have to have mage-particle envy like<br/>
on EQ ;)<br/>
<br/>
Cons:<br/>
* No provision for dying clothes a different color at a later time.<br/>
* Easy to get whacked fatally by a big huge monster someone let out before<br/>
you can even see it. Usually in EQ I&#39;ve at least had time to panic.<br/>
* Lag can cause you to move slower and eventually stop altogether, basically<br/>
running in place. BUT it&#39;s not as bad as the stop-walk-jerk-stop-walk-stop<br/>
motion from UO I always had, even when I had a good connection.<br/>
* If you want an armor bonus of some sort for being an unarmed combatant,<br/>
forget it. But your bare hands still are damn fast. You can specialize in<br/>
defensive skills or raise the attributes behind those skills though.<br/>
* No mend, but if you were willing to take points away from vital fighting<br/>
statistics you could get stats to help you use Healing Kits.<br/>
<br/>
Other notes:<br/>
* Initial 3rd person perspective can be changed to 1st person by hitting<br/>
Del, but it does look kinda funny.<br/>
* Custom character lets you do some weird combos, like you can have a<br/>
super-fast and coordinated guy who specializes in a dagger, so he can&#39;t hit<br/>
but he can avoid everything :)<br/>
* If you got a beta invite and plan on playing the game, don&#39;t choose a<br/>
pre-made character type unless don&#39;t have any time to choose your own stats.<br/>
The characters you can come up with yourself are more fun.<br/>
* Oh, BTW, archery is actually affordable in AC.<br/>
* For some reason AC actually has some &quot;safe zones&quot; built into the<br/>
landscape, like walls that monsters cant climb the ladders too. Weird, huh.</div>
