<div id="ygrps-yiv-1372162842">Here is an example why twinking bothers me so much:<br/>
<br/>
Lets just say a new zone opens and it is extremely difficult. Very high<br/>
level mobs for the most part, but a full group of lvl 36-40 players can do<br/>
ok *if* they are very careful. Many groups of adventurers from levels 35-50<br/>
are soon wandering around the new area, exploring, hunting, dying, killing<br/>
things, what have you. One group in particular, lvls 45-50, is concentrating<br/>
on killing things. Not a bad thing in and of itself, but upon exploring a<br/>
little, they discover many pieces of no drop, class specific armor. Soon,<br/>
they have invited all of their lower level friends to come in and partake of<br/>
the loot that would otherwise remain on the corpses of the dead critters.<br/>
Now there are low level characters running around in high level armor. This<br/>
practice continues and escalates to such an extant, that Verant feels<br/>
compelled to say &quot;That&#39;s it...&quot; and place a level restriction of 45 on the<br/>
zone in question, thus banning EVERYONE from lvls 35-44 who were hunting<br/>
there for the actions of a few.<br/>
<br/>
Now lets place a name on this new zone and call it The Plane of Fear. I saw<br/>
a lvl 19 Monk fully decked out in Shiverback and bp jewelry the other day.<br/>
No argument you come up with can justify his gear. It is players like him<br/>
that made Verant come to the decision they did about the level restriction<br/>
on PoF. So don&#39;t try to tell me that twinking has no affect on those around<br/>
you. For every piece of twinked armor someone wears, there is someone out<br/>
there who has been trying to get that piece for a long time.<br/>
<br/>
I will apologize now for the tone of this note. But the more I think about<br/>
twinking and the ramifications it carriers, the angrier I get. I mean no<br/>
disrespect to anyone. Just realize that there ARE consequences to twinking<br/>
that affect everyone.<br/>

&gt; Why does twinking bother you so much?<br/>
&gt; You make a valid point that it spoils the game for the guy who twinked his<br/>
&gt; character - I mean he has nothing to look forward to but weeks of<br/>
&gt; pwerlevelling his guy to levle 50...<br/>
&gt; But how does it affect you or your enjoyment of the game?<br/>
&gt; Coluld it be it makes you jealous?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I dont twink myself but I have no<br/>
&gt; problem with twinkers. Let them twink!  How does that affect my<br/>
&gt; play/enjoyment? Express anger/resentment at peopl who twink and those who<br/>
&gt; allow themselves to be twinked. By this you are implying that if someone<br/>
&gt; were to offer you a haste sash and 2 serpentine bracers you would turn<br/>
&gt; them down (Nay, you would curse them out for trying to twink you!).  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Personally if someone offered me all that great stuff I would accept it<br/>
&gt; happily and be thankfull to them.  So suppose my level 30 monk were to be<br/>
&gt; walking around decked out in level 45-50 gear would your everquest gaming<br/>
&gt; expereince be affected in teh least?<br/>

&gt; &gt; i don&#39;t be caring how *hic* much you hunted mammoths.  By your 22nd yeer<br/>
&gt; &gt; you still *burp* canna afford an exe hood, serpentine bracers and hav<br/>
&gt; &gt; mutliple black pearls....unless yer twinked or yer *hic* guild twinked<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; mudder loving hell out a ya.  Still either way....it&#39;s a friggin shame<br/>
&gt; &gt; that peepol twink themselves or allow themselves to be *burp* twinked.<br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; p.s.  ill say this in plain ole english...not drunk speek.  I saw a<br/>
&gt; &gt; 17-19th level SK hunting in Oasis.  Full suit of rubi/carnal armor.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Purity Belt, Dark Reaver, BP Choker, Plantinum Silver Ruby Veil, Dwarven<br/>
&gt; &gt; Work Boots and a White Wolf Hide Cloak.  Whats the fun at that<br/>
&gt; &gt; point...when everything you want for your character you already have.<br/>
&gt; &gt; There is just no point.  I wish twinking was a bannable offense.<br/>
