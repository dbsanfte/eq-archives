<div id="ygrps-yiv-240071806">Mino hero is level 40ish. you will need a full group of 35s to take him down  (<br/>
you and 5 level 35-40 friends). A level 39 necro could take him down solo with<br/>
some difficulty.  Depending on the server you play on he could be camped and so<br/>
you might want to bring a good NUKE along to ensure you earn the kill.<br/>
<br/>
The first thing to do is raise qeynos warrior guild faction.  Wiat let me take<br/>
that back... the first thing to do is go to www.gameznet.com and print out the<br/>
walk through for the quest.  You have to do a silly quest to kerra isle before<br/>
you can get the hero bracer quest, and you have to con amiable before you can<br/>
get any quests at all.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly one trick you wil want to know is *how do I make the mino hero spawn?*<br/>
Well rumor has it that if you kill minos and skeleton by the skelie camp he will<br/>
spawn in a matter of minutes (people have gotten 2 spawns an hour with this<br/>
method). <br/>
<br/>
Take the shakle off the mino + faction with the warrior guild + complete the<br/>
first &quot;runaway gladiator&quot; quest, and you will get one hero bracers 9ac, 10 str,<br/>
5 poison, 5 disease.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck<br/>

Since we have all decided that the Twinking debat is boring (and it is)<br/>
I would like to ask a question that is actually worthwile.<br/>
<br/>
I am interested in starting the Hero Bracers quest.  I know what I need<br/>
but I would appreciate more information on exactly how to get the<br/>
items.  Also, is level 30 too low to attempt this quest?<br/>
