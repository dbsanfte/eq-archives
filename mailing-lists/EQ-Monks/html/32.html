<div id="ygrps-yiv-495966830">I have to agree with this .. Monks really do have the p*** taken out of them<br/>
because everyone knows they need netted armour and upwards, but I have to<br/>
say that I am yet to meet a fellow monk that shares the same thoughts. I<br/>
managed to get myself a full set of netted from a troll for 4pp al that was<br/>
missing was the gloves .. which I expected to pay up to 2pp for, even though<br/>
I begrudge paying it .. Imagine my supprise when I auctioned for a pair and<br/>
a fellow monk offered me some for &quot;Oh the least I will take is 10pp&quot; .. this<br/>
was on Erollisi Marr server<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps an all monk guild would address this problem?<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m planning on making a run into Upper Guk tonight and am at a<br/>
&gt;loss as far as finding maps of this region go.  Does anybody have any<br/>
&gt;references they wouldn&#39;t mind sharing?  I&#39;d appreciate it.<br/>
&gt; BTW: I&#39;m on E&#39;ci, so if anybody would like to purchase any of the<br/>
&gt;netted/woven/mesh items I obtain, I would be happy to sell them to you at a<br/>
&gt;discount (we monks have to stick together... :) )<br/>
