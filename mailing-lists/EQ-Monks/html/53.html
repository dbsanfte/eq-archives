<b>Subject:</b> Feign Death Skill <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-916065025">Has anyone ever found the feign death skill to be actually useful in getting <br/>
creatures that are attacking you to stop? I have been practicing non-stop <br/>
since I got the skill and it is now at 50, but fighting crocodiles and <br/>
caiman, not once has feigning death, whether i fell to the ground or not, <br/>
stopped them from biting me. Is there something about the use of the skill <br/>
that I am missing or is it just not that useful?<br/>
