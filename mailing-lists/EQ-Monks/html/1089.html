<div id="ygrps-yiv-299609300"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; That&#39;s a very passive attitude.  I believe that if you tell someone<br/>
&gt; to take a look at themselves, and their posts from another<br/>
&gt; perspective.  Think before they post, about half the idiot posts would<br/>
&gt; not be sent.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If no one responds and complains about one bad email.  The <br/>
&gt; offender will<br/>
&gt; just send another, and another, and another.  Eventually someone<br/>
&gt; (me) needs to tell that person that his e-mails aren&#39;t being <br/>
&gt; productive<br/>
&gt; and he is only hurting his own name, that person will stop or the<br/>
&gt; emails will be a lot more well thought out.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So tell me what exactly is different about you?  What makes your version of<br/>
&quot;Shut up and quit whining about it&quot; different than say, Stone&#39;s?  Why are<br/>
you going to invoke a change than he, or any of the others won&#39;t?  As you<br/>
say, it has been weeks, and it seemed to me that the thread had just about<br/>
petered out until a sudden, unnecessary inflamation.<br/>
