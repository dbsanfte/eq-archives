<br/>
How to make swatches:<br/>
<br/>
Take two spider silks (not spiderling) and place them<br/>
in your sewing kit.  Hit combine.  You have a swatch.<br/>
<br/>
How to make armor:<br/>
Use swatches just like they are pelts.  Place a swatch<br/>
with a cap patterm, hit combine, voila, raw silk cap. <br/>
(Note: For Tunic and Pants you need 2 swatches, when<br/>
you place them in your kit them can not be stacked. <br/>
Therefore if you want to make tunics or pants you need<br/>
a large sewing kit)<br/>
<br/>
Selling Price:<br/>
I sell all the 1 swatch pieces for 2pp, the leggings<br/>
for 3pp and the tunic for 4pp.  You have a limited<br/>
ammount of people who will buy it but if you can sell<br/>
it, you make a good ammount of money.  (I have seen<br/>
prices higher than this, someone sold a tunic for 6pp<br/>
which I thought was a little high)<br/>
<br/>
Example, Raw Silk Cap:<br/>
Item                        Cost<br/>
2 spider silks              2 for 3gp (thats what I   <br/>
                         pay) or free of giant        <br/>
                    spiders<br/>
cap pattern                 5 silver 6 copper (at 75  <br/>
                            chr)<br/>
total                       3gp 5 silver 6 copper (can<br/>
                            be more or less)<br/>
sells to vendor             3 gp 6 silver (on average,<br/>
                            can be + or - 2 silver)<br/>
sells to other player       2 pp<br/>
<br/>
Thats a decent profit if you can sell it to another<br/>
player, and practically no profit if you sell it to<br/>
vendor.  Thats all I know about silk, it is still<br/>
unknown how to make whips.<br/>
<br/>
Skill Level<br/>
<br/>
swatches were trivial for me at when I started at 20,<br/>
probably go trivial at 16 tho.  I hear that actually<br/>
armor doesn&#39;t go trivial till arround 30-35<br/>
<br/>
hope that helps<br/>
