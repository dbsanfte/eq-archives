&lt;&lt; Really? I know about the Foreman&#39;s Tunic, but I haven&#39;t seen or heard of<br/>
 anything else available, either from perusing various websites, or from<br/>
 talking to other monks in EQ.<br/>
<br/>
 Do you still look as if you were wearing leather?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 Here is, piece by piece, what i have:<br/>
<br/>
 Head: Executioner&#39;s Hood<br/>
 Earrings: electrum sapphire earrings (+4 STR / +2 INT)<br/>
 Neck: Gold black pearl neclace (+7 AGI / +7 DEX)<br/>
 Shoulders: Mesh mantle<br/>
 Chest: Foreman&#39;s Tunic (AC 10, +3 STR / +3 WIS, weightless)<br/>
 Back: Cloak of the White Wolf (AC 7, +3 STR / +3 DEX, +5 vs. Cold, wt. .3)<br/>
 Arms: Azure Sleeves (AC 12, weight -- not sure, i think .6)<br/>
 Wrists: Serpentine Bracers (+9 AGI / +3 DEX, wt. .1 or so)<br/>
 Gloves: Bone Fingered Gloves (AC 3, +3 DEX / +3 INT, weight .3)<br/>
 Rings: Platinum black pearl rings (+6 AGI / +6 DEX)<br/>
 Waist: Red Sash (Working on getting my Flowing Black Sash, currently!)<br/>
 Legs: Drake-hide leggings (AC 5, +5 DEX / +5 CHA, wt. .1)<br/>
 Feet: Wolf fur slippers (+7 AGI, wt. .2 or .3)<br/>
 <br/>
 So there is a list of almost all non-mesh stuff... <br/>
<br/>
 And yes, for the most part, it still looks like newbie equipment, except for <br/>
the bracers... Most of the time I keep my Guise of the Deceiver turned on, <br/>
though, so I look like a DE monk.... <br/>
