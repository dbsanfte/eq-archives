<div id="ygrps-yiv-87602700">ID is a very nice skill for just messing around, though at high lvl, it&#39;s not <br/>
really all that important.  It is quite fun however to run through oasis or <br/>
WC and kill SG or HG.  And this is made mostly possible through use of ID.  I <br/>
have soloed a SG w/o using it before, but it was way to close to actually <br/>
depend on being able to kill them regularly.  With using it, I have soloed SG <br/>
and only lost half my hps, not even using mend.  Though it&#39;s not very <br/>
reliable, I can normally count on it working at least once or twice in a <br/>
fight of the sort mentioned above.<br/>
