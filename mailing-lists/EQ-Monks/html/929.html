Subject: All Monk Event - Please Read<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been posting this on the message board at:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://server3.ezboard.com/beverquestmonks">http://server3.ezboard.com/beverquestmonks</a><br/>
<br/>
And I thought I&#39;d also post it here, as this is turning <br/>
out to be a lot of fun and so far I&#39;ve had a lot of <br/>
support.<br/>
<br/>
Event: Monk Madness <br/>
<br/>
Server: Vallon Zek <br/>
<br/>
Time: Starting this Friday at 9PM eastern US time. That <br/>
is GMT -5:00 for international monks. :)This will be an <br/>
ongoing event until Sunday Night. Play as little or as <br/>
much of that as you want to. <br/>
<br/>
Story: An evil gnome wizard experimenting with cloning <br/>
captured a lone human monk in Freeport, and tried to <br/>
clone him. He inadvertently triggered a chain reaction <br/>
and suddenly there spawns many many many monks. All <br/>
identical. Being of one mind they are also all of one <br/>
guild, &quot;The Armadillos of Norrath&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
Naming: This is an event in which monks from all <br/>
servers who may know each other from messageboards will <br/>
participate. Therefore I think it is a great idea that <br/>
we use the naming convention &#39;&quot;your real monk <br/>
name&quot;dillo&#39;. Or a variation thereof. Such that I am <br/>
going to be Ipnodillo on vallon zek for the weekend. ;) <br/>
<br/>
Goal: Have fun. Group up with as many monks as you can <br/>
and run around the zone punching everything in site. Go <br/>
on suicide missions. We&#39;ll be like ants. <br/>
<br/>
To participate, create a new monk on Vallon Zek Friday <br/>
Night. The monk should be the male version with the <br/>
Priest of Discord face. We&#39;re gonna try to create a <br/>
guild for this as well, so look for a guild officer to <br/>
invite you. Please try to keep your guild tunic on at <br/>
all times so we have the monk &quot;look&quot; about us. Invite <br/>
all your friends to attend. This is an event to have <br/>
fun, not so heavy on the roleplaying, but lets just <br/>
have a LOT of fun. <br/>
<br/>
To clarify, your monk should look like this: <br/>
<br/>

 <br/>
The guild has been submitted. Lets all hope verant <br/>
approves it! <br/>
<br/>
Invite your non monk friends who have always admired <br/>
your monkness as well! Lets try and make this event a <br/>
legend of it&#39;s own kind! :) <br/>
<br/>
Just think. Hundreds of Identical Newbie Monks... <br/>
