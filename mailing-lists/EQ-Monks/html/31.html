<b>Subject:</b> Feign Death: Talk about HANDY!!! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1442215297">Well, now that I&#39;m level 19, I&#39;ve had a chance now to experiment a<br/>
bit with Feign Death and I have only one word: WOW!  This one skill alone<br/>
makes up for a huge number of the things that have irritated me about being<br/>
a monk and has restored my faith quite a bit in the Gods of Balance who<br/>
roam the halls at Verant.  Not only has it saved my behind on a number of<br/>
occasions from rampaging Giants, Ghouls, trains of various flavors, etc.,<br/>
but has also allowed me to do the following:<br/>
<br/>
- Leap on any &#39;dog pile&#39; forming around high-level creatures (LockJaw,<br/>
Giants, etc.) with near impunity.<br/>
- Draw any number of rampaging high-level NPCs from other players while<br/>
they run away.  Once they&#39;re safe, I hit the dirt.<br/>
- Lure NPCs away from other people&#39;s corpses while they drag them to a<br/>
safer location for looting.<br/>
- Explore areas I&#39;d never dream of exploring almost any other way.<br/>
- Drop in the middle of a dangerous area and act as a lookout for others<br/>
who need up-to-the-minute intelligence as far as what&#39;s going on.<br/>
- Do a &#39;temporary camp&#39; wherever I am so I don&#39;t have to log out if I need<br/>
to go AFK in the middle of a dangerous area.<br/>
<br/>
	The ideas just keep coming.<br/>
	Heh... you warriors can keep your armor, you mages can keep your<br/>
sissy little lightning bolts, bards can beat their drums in a corner...<br/>
Between Feign Death and Mend, I&#39;ll take being a monk any day!<br/>
