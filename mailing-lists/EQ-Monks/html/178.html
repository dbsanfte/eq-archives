<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1290077226">i was think&#39;n that they would give warriors a skill...<br/>
i wonder what warriors woulda said if they got instill doubt and we got<br/>
death touch (like we should have anyways.)<br/>
i was completely happy with my monk except for the dull attire... now this<br/>
crap happens.<br/>
the only way they can restore balance now.. is give us death touch or taunt.<br/>
that was are balance with warriors damnit... they had the hps and they could<br/>
taunt... and we could do more melee dmg.<br/>
btw... they also got alot more hps along with the dmg adjustment.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;don&#39;t really know why you need a monk anymore though... since the warriors<br/>
&gt;are doing more dmg than ever.. they got more hps.. and they can taunt...<br/>
&gt;casters seem to like that taunt thing.. it can come in handy in keeping a<br/>
&gt;party alive... it really sucks to see one of my casters gett&#39;n the crap<br/>
 </span></blockquote>beat<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;out of em and there is nothing i can do about it... as a matter of fact i<br/>
&gt;normally just stay on the 1st mob until he&#39;s dead... tanks normally have to<br/>
&gt;taunt off the casters when we get more than one... and they take more dmg<br/>
&gt;than ever... high lvl monks hardly ever take dmg... not because of block,<br/>
&gt;dodge, reposte and such... but because we can&#39;t taunt... i&#39;ve gotten to<br/>
&gt;where i normally do the pull&#39;n just so i can take some dmg before the mob<br/>
&gt;jumps on a caster and it has to be taunted off by the tank.<br/>
&gt;actually i think if there were more high lvl warriors and i wasn&#39;t such<br/>
 </span></blockquote>good<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;sorry to go off the subject like that... but this has been bugging me for a<br/>
&gt;while..(<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>	No, no!!! Don&#39;t apologize!  This has been really on my mind <br/>
for the last several days.  One of the things I accepted when I <br/>
became a monk was that I wouldn&#39;t really &#39;come into my own&#39; until <br/>
level 30 when Flying Kick became available - at which point I could <br/>
start being a more serious contributor to how the party functions. <br/>
Well, now that I&#39;m less than a bubble from that turning point, Verant <br/>
updates warriors in such a fashion so as to make monks a clearly <br/>
second-class melee type.  Consider the following notes regarding some <br/>
of the skills afforded each class:<br/>
<br/>
Mend: Monks get it, warriors do not.  With a successful mend, we have <br/>
about as many HPs available to me as a warrior of a similar level. <br/>
Needless to say, we do not always have mend available, so we are <br/>
typically at a disadvantage in terms of hit points.  Result: Healers <br/>
would rather have warriors around because they don&#39;t have to heal <br/>
them as often (all else being equal).<br/>
<br/>
Taunt: Monks don&#39;t get it, warriors do.  Result: Casters would rather <br/>
have a warrior around when they are getting beat on.<br/>
<br/>
Armor: Monks don&#39;t get it, warriors do.  Result: All sorts of neat <br/>
bonuses and stat boosters not available to us.<br/>
<br/>
Weapons: Don&#39;t get &#39;em (from a pracitical perspective).  Result: All <br/>
sorts of interesting effects we don&#39;t get to throw around.<br/>
<br/>
Extra Magic Resistance: Monks don&#39;t get it, warriors do.  Result: We <br/>
are far more vulnerable to magic attacks than warriors are.  Team <br/>
members don&#39;t like this because they have to rush to your aid more <br/>
often.<br/>
<br/>
Critical hit: Monks don&#39;t get it, warriors do.  Result: A warrior I <br/>
group with  (who is lower level than I am) REGULARLY criticals in the <br/>
70-90+ range.  I can&#39;t expect to hit in the 90s until I&#39;m level 45+ <br/>
(16 levels from now) and even then, it&#39;ll be a rare occurrence off of <br/>
a special attack.  Where once we had a rough parity in the amount of <br/>
damage we could do, this has been completely destroyed with the last <br/>
patch.<br/>
<br/>
Monks get more hits: I don&#39;t buy it.  A warrior and a ranger I often <br/>
group with multi-hit just as often as I do and since they are using <br/>
cool double-weilded weapons, they do much more damage per hit. <br/>
Besides, the theory that more hits help break up a caster&#39;s <br/>
concentration also does not hold water.  Any decent NPC (level 25+) <br/>
will recover their concentration 9 times out of 10 and finish the job <br/>
anyway.<br/>
<br/>
	There is more, but I&#39;m running the danger of getting myself a <br/>
little too worked up about this.  The bottom line is that I feel as <br/>
if monks have been cheated by a too-generous tweaking of warriors. <br/>
Am I way off-base here, or do others feel as I do?<br/>
