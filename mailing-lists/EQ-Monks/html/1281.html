<div id="ygrps-yiv-346450012">NOT werewolf talons, these are for the crafted BP quest and they are no<br/>
drop. What you need are werewolf claws. And it was not rare to see them sold<br/>
for 1k. I traded the Lupine Claw Gauntlets for a Crown of the Froglok King<br/>
when I got my Treant Fists, so it can be a very valuable item.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with most of the advices.<br/>
About the bracers, I recommend a Hero Bracer in a few levels. You will be<br/>
able to camp the hero mino with a good group. The difficult part is then to<br/>
increase your faction with the Steel Warriors, because you need to be in<br/>
high &quot;amiably&quot; to succeed. There are a few quest to do it, and it took me 3<br/>
days. AC 9, STR +10, +5 poison and disease, wt 4.0. Yes they are heavy, but<br/>
you can live with it. My wt is under 14, and it is worth it.<br/>
<br/>
I used to have a pure AGI/DEX gear, but I switched to pure AC a few levels<br/>
ago. I keep my old gear though, to make some tests in the future.<br/>
The Robe of the Lost Circle and the Treant Fists are the best items we can<br/>
have for hands and chest (with Syythrak Hide vest), but they are hell of<br/>
camps, so I would just recommend to let luck give them to you. You can camp<br/>
it like I did, but it is very time consuming (took me more than 200 hours<br/>
total for the fists, I was particularly unlucky).<br/>
<br/>
Here is what I have at lvl 40:<br/>
<br/>
2 Obsidian bead hoop (2 Diamondine earrings would be ok, but not necessary)<br/>
Collar of undead protection (Runed lava pendant would be ok, but resists are<br/>
nice too)<br/>
Crown of Froglok King<br/>
Cured silk shoulderpads (nothing better for us before planes, what a joke !)<br/>
Lizardskin tribal mask (I need to go to Kedge Keep to find the Pearlescent<br/>
mask)<br/>
Azur sleeves<br/>
Symbol of royalty to Vox<br/>
Hero bracer<br/>
Robe of the Lost Circle<br/>
White wolf hide cloak (Cloak of shadow or Hooded black cloak would be<br/>
better, but both very rare)<br/>
Treant Fists<br/>
2 platinum fire wedding rings (platinum with fire opals)<br/>
Flowing black silk sash (Thick banded belt if you prefer AC and STR, but I<br/>
prefer haste here, both very rare items too)<br/>
Gatorscale leggings<br/>
Cured silk slippers (looking for Wolf fur slippers)<br/>
<br/>
I am not speaking about plane or dragon items here. But it can give you an<br/>
idea of a possible evolution in the long term.<br/>

Decent equipment though I have some suggestions for upgrading:<br/>
<br/>
1) Werewolf hid gloves are very obtainable:<br/>
<br/>
Go to MM and auction to buy some werewolf talons from some of the higher<br/>
level<br/>
players out there.  A good deal is about 200pp (trust me you might get it<br/>
for<br/>
free! They are fairly common drop - 2 or three are typically dropped in a 3<br/>
hour<br/>
period in the music room).  Take these to Karg Icebear with 75pp (?? double<br/>
check <br/>
that amount)  to earn yourself a pair of Lupine gauntlets.</div>
