&gt; i assume that you are referring to the recently announced patch in which<br/>
&gt; DOT were MODIFIED.  <br/>

I&#39;m a monk, I dont kite, I dont twink (not yet at least).<br/>
<br/>
and no, I have not been nerfed.  just my inventory.<br/>
<br/>
and when you loose all your stuff ZONING, and they say &quot;too bad, known<br/>
bug, shouldnt have zoned&quot;, you start to have a little different thinking<br/>
to twinking.<br/>
-------<br/>
<br/>
on a side note, If verant wants to keep its player based economy, then<br/>
twinking will never be banned, and lvl limits will never be put in place.<br/>
The only way a player based economy works is if the currency is actually<br/>
worth something.  <br/>
<br/>
It is. <br/>
<br/>
add level caps, or ban twinking, and you seriously devalue the currency,<br/>
turning the economy into a barter system.<br/>
<br/>
-------<br/>
<br/>
on a third note.  What connotates twinking?  is it buying stuff?  I bought<br/>
my mesh, am I a twink?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m lvl 19, and I made 500pp yesterday.  If I buy something nice with it,<br/>
am I a twink?</div>
