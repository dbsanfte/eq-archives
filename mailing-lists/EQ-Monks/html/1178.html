&gt;It seems to me that the chances of it failing are a LOT higher if you use<br/>
&gt;Mend and you are at 50% health or lower.  I&#39;m level 24 and my skill is only<br/>
&gt;90 (never bothered practicing it when sitting in town babbling with people,<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m going to have to start now. :)).  If I use it when I only have 2 bubbles<br/>
&gt;of health gone, it seems to work almost all the time.  I can only recall it<br/>
&gt;failing twice, in recent memory, and only worsening my wounds once.  I<br/>
&gt;always try and use it when I&#39;ve lost 2 bubbles.<br/>
<br/>
