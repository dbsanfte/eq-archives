<b>Subject:</b> Monk stats <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2075533146">I don&#39;t just think it&#39;s we monks who are complaining.  In general the melee<br/>
stats (Str/Sta/Agi/Dex) just don&#39;t affect combat much in any way.  The warriors<br/>
are complaining about this as well.  However it does mean that initial choices<br/>
like what race to be or where to put bonus stats aren&#39;t very <br/>
important.  It&#39;s levels<br/>
and skills (and a good weapon) that really matter.<br/>
<br/>
For monks, the best ordering of priorities I saw was<br/>
<br/>
1. Haste (swap ANYTHING to get a haste item... even that Girdle of +100 Str)<br/>
2. AC/HP (those plat fire opal rings are awesome, especially now with the<br/>
monk upgrade meaning that we will be tanking more)<br/>
3. Str/Agi (you&#39;re worrying about how to add +3Str when you regularly get<br/>
buffed by shaman/druids to +20/+30Str- ever noticed much difference between<br/>
a +20Str buff and a +30Str buff?)<br/>
<br/>
Look at monks at level 50, we have better AC and attack than warriors, cause<br/>
much more damage, but our HP are 7-800 points below theirs.  With good gear<br/>
you can add 350hp or so to a monk. That gets you halfway to being a real<br/>
tank.<br/>
<br/>
Good AC/HP gear:<br/>
Plat fire opal rings- ac5 55hp  (cost 500pp+)<br/>
Gold fire opal rings- ac4 45hp  (cost 60-120pp)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;So, folks, we all recently heard *with disappointment* about verant<br/>
&gt;employees posting about DEX and AGI - they seem to be a lot less important<br/>
&gt;than we hoped for.  In light of this new information - what do all you monks<br/>
&gt;out there see as the most important stats for a monk, now? How would you<br/>
&gt;focus your items (ie STR? AC? HPS? AGI? DEX? STA?)? And how would you<br/>
&gt;distribute your starting points?  Maybe a few could name some equipment that<br/>
&gt;backs up their opinions.<br/>
&gt;Thanks in advance for everyone&#39;s input =)<br/>
