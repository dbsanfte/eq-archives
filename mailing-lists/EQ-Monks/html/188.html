<div id="ygrps-yiv-1584569624">The Grass is Greener Syndrom has landed on us, has it?  It&#39;s all been said:<br/>
No one class is best -- that&#39; why we group. I&#39;ve put a lot of time in other<br/>
classes, but so far, I like being a monk best of all. It&#39;s always going to<br/>
be a personal preference thing. If you&#39;re unhappy, role another character,<br/>
but remember that no one class is really best at soloing -- some are better<br/>
than others, but all in all, I think we (monks) have a pretty well balanced,<br/>
kick ass class.<br/>

&gt;Naah dude that is wack..  On Fennin Ro Bodhi (The First EVER lvl 50 monk,<br/>
&gt;Leader of Dragoon of A.....(sorry bod i cna&#39;t remember))  Anyways we have<br/>
&gt;done MANY Nagafen and Vox adventures and he is pretty much ther eason why.<br/>
&gt;He is able to pull out those Fire/Ice Giants in a steady pace so that we<br/>
 </span></blockquote>can<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;handle them easily.  I feel i have something to look forward to when i get<br/>
&gt;my monk 20 levels higher.  Then my guild won&#39;t have to depend on the<br/>
&gt;Dragoons for so much stuff (heh).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Monks, Rogues, Warriors, none of these classes are made to really solo<br/>
&gt;(although rogues should be able to) They need groups, in groups their<br/>
 </span></blockquote>skills<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;are magnified by such an amazing degree it is beyond comprehension.  If a<br/>
&gt;Monk has a smart cleric or shaman he can take mobs on that are 5-7 levels<br/>
&gt;higher then him, just by being constantly buffed and healed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;People that complain about monks being sorry were just not made to play<br/>
&gt;monks they should play a necro or mage or Wiz (good solo classes) So give<br/>
&gt;them a spin fellas!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thats all!!<br/>
