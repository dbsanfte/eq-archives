<div id="ygrps-yiv-611318454">Hey there,<br/>
Brother Kingdok here again. I received a /tell<br/>
yesterday from a concerned party on Erollisi Marr<br/>
asking the name of the greedy monk I spoke of<br/>
yesterday. I do not feel it is right to post his name<br/>
on the lits but if you are on Erollisi Marr and wish<br/>
to know his name, email me and I will tell you. I do<br/>
not wish people to bother him, that is why I didn&#39;t<br/>
post his name. HE does have the right to be a jerk<br/>
even if i do not like it. So please ask only if you<br/>
wish to know his name in case you are ever in party<br/>
with him or have the chance to be. Please do not<br/>
harass him. I do not wish him ill, but I do understand<br/>
why people would want to know so that they would not<br/>
have the misfortune of having an evening spoiled by<br/>
his greed and poor sportsmanship.<br/>
<br/>
May truth guide you,<br/>
Brother Kingdok<br/>
