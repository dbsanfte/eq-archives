<div id="ygrps-yiv-1983955830">Hmmmm and exactly what is your problem?  Are you upset because I didn&#39;t <br/>
proof read my e-mail like a college english paper? I am sorry you took <br/>
offense to my e-mail though I do understand it is easy to &quot;act&quot; tough in <br/>
e-mail. Ill just attribute your rant to juvenile behavior. Sorry about the <br/>
FSU thing.</div>
