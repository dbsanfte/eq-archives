<div id="ygrps-yiv-828594012">I know a lot of people are going to disagree with me, but Verant&#39;s change to<br/>
the feign death is warranted. People WERE exploiting the FD especially<br/>
inside the planes. One way to fix that WITHOUT screwing a lot of lower level<br/>
people was to make it where any creature under level 35, would think you<br/>
were dead and forget about you while creatures 35th and up would use the<br/>
different percentages setup by Verant. I think this fair. I have ONLY used<br/>
feign death in serious situations where there was a train on my butt and I<br/>
was definitely going to die because I couldn&#39;t make it to a zone. I feel<br/>
that&#39;s what it was intended to do and some people figured out a way to<br/>
exploit it in the planes with the big creatures. So thats that. I&#39;m fine<br/>
with it.<br/>
<br/>
As for other things, I have a 36th level monk on the Tribunal and I WOULDN&#39;T<br/>
have made it this far without having a balanced group of guildmembers to go<br/>
around with. Since monks dont get the huge amounts of HPs we really lose out<br/>
to the other warrior classes. Saying that I can honestly say that the monks<br/>
are the best class in the game. I know you&#39;re looking forward to that flying<br/>
kick skill too and while i&#39;m at 180 skill I still miss about 60% of the time<br/>
,AGAINST LOW BLUES,even though I have a 131dex and 137agi. Even with these<br/>
problems I will continue to play my monk though, UGLY robe and all, because<br/>
I have to admit I have had fun playing it. Seeing &quot;You kick a greater kobold<br/>
for 88 points.&quot; is one hell of a rush. I also have one hell of  bank<br/>
account.<br/>
