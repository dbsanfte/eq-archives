Pulling really becomes and art when there are multiple mobs that your<br/>
group cannot handle.  You attract their attention with an attack<br/>
(range attacks are ok here).  They all come steaming after you with<br/>
murder in their eyes.  You pull them away from their usually spawn<br/>
point and Feign Death.  Some of them will turn and leave eventually,<br/>
until the remainder (the ones your group CAN handle) are left.  Stand<br/>
and attack them, then draw them back to your group.  Means that you<br/>
should never have more targets than you can deal with.  Simple really<br/>
but takes a lot of experience and patience to get good at.  Upper Guk<br/>
is THE place to learn this in my humble opinion.<br/>

&gt;Subject: RE: Pulling<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Can someone tell me how a monk pulls things and what makes them better than<br/>
&gt;other &#39;pullers&#39;?  sort of go through the technique.  I know that you use<br/>
&gt;feign death, but HOW???<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Yes monk&#39;s are the best pullers bar none.  Ask any <br/>
&gt;&gt;group of 35+s whether they want a monk pulling in <br/>
&gt;&gt;sol b or lower guk or anyone else? :)<br/>
