Would you take ac15 12str or ac15 135hp<br/>

buffed up I notice a dramatic increase in the number of times I hit and the<br/>
amount of damage I do. This is not strict scientific data not checked or<br/>
anything but I do know that all my highs I have ever jotted down with flying<br/>
kick and weapons attacks are all from when being buffed. If this is a<br/>
coincidence then so be it. I do know that the 110 hps more I get from<br/>
wearing Plat FO rings as opposed to any of the better STR rings does not<br/>
mean a whole lot to me. If one of the mobs in Seb decides it really wants to<br/>
rip into me with my HPs I am a lost cause anyways.<br/>

boosts my chances to hit by one percent when I am wielding low delay low<br/>
damage weapons the more often I hit the more often I do my job which is<br/>
dealing damage. Lord knows Monks do not have the HPs to be a meat wall.<br/>
