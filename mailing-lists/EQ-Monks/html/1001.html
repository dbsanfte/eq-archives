<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1181877398">Ok... Telepathy, thats not all... Here is what mobs/any npc does:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
   They always know where you are.  There is no way to escape a mob without<br/>
zoning.  Mobs are faster than PC&#39;s.  Mobs can hit a PC from a greater<br/>
distance.  Mobs are more resistant to magic.  Mobs have more HP than the<br/>
average PC of the same level.  Mobs do more damage than the average PC of<br/>
the same level.  Mobs are impossible to capture when they are running away<br/>
(Ever wonder why there are so many trains in some dungeons? Mobs run away<br/>
and PC can&#39;t catch em, and the mob goes and gets 40 other mobs).  Mobs have<br/>
twice as much mana as a PC of their level.  Mobs have faster casting times.<br/>
MOBS HAVE MORE FRIENDS.  It is much harder to resist a mob&#39;s spell.  If a<br/>
mob is using a fast weapon that does less damage then the mobs fists, it<br/>
uses the SPEED of the weapon and does the damage of it&#39;s fist.  If the<br/>
weapon is slower than its fists but does more damage, it uses the speed of<br/>
its fists and the damage of the weapon.  The list goes on!  IS THIS FAIR?<br/>
IS THIS RIGHT?  WE CAN&#39;T EVEN RUN AWAY! HELL, MOBS ARE THE SUPERIOR RACE!<br/>
WHY DOESN&#39;T VERANT HAVE AN &quot;Uprising of the MOBS&quot; where THEY SPAWN 50 VOX&#39;S<br/>
IN EVERY CITY!  Why doesn&#39;t verant just BAN us ALL and play with the MOBS?<br/>
Heck, they don&#39;t complain!<br/>
<br/>
   Im sick of this BS and thats why I&#39;m quitting.  Go ahead, flame me, do<br/>
whatever, I don&#39;t care.  I&#39;ve transcended this game that is supposed to be<br/>
&quot;Fun&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
   Darkblade,<br/>
   Moving to a game like Shadowbane ( <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sb.drtwister.com">http://sb.drtwister.com</a> )  , where he<br/>
can CRUSH people instead of &quot;MOBS&quot; that are ridiculously more powerful than<br/>
himself.</div>
