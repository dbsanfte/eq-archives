<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1852240956">Another place to get netted is from the low level lizards in feerrott, near <br/>
the Innothule swamp.  This, however, is not suggested, as the ogre bouncers <br/>
(guards) tend to roam all over, and it&#39;s very easy to get lost.  Also the <br/>
swamp is very dangerous, because there are a few higher level mobs in the <br/>
area, namely Jojongua the kobold.  That, and it&#39;s pretty easy to gather <br/>
quite a crowd of frogs while you&#39;re fighting one.  Another idea, though, is <br/>
to simply go to the swamp and auction to buy it.  There should be plenty of <br/>
low level trolls with some to sell.  Don&#39;t pay too much for it tho, as the <br/>
protection is equivalent to cloth.<br/>
<br/>
Getting to Qeynos isn&#39;t that difficult, and is definitely possible at your <br/>
level.  Check out this website for maps -<br/>

It would be best to travel with a shaman, druid, or bard for speed.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck...<br/>

&gt;Hail Brother&#39;s & Sisters,<br/>
&gt;   First of all I would like to say Thank you to the many people that take <br/>
&gt;the time to answer Q&#39;s from new&#39;B players like myself, I hope you know that <br/>
&gt;the info you share is very appreciated!.<br/>
&gt;  Now on to the Q&#39;s!<br/>
&gt;I have read many things about Netted/Mesh armor, and am planing to start <br/>
&gt;&quot;Questing&quot; for some. What I need to know though is, is this armor somthing <br/>
&gt;that I will actualy &quot;make&quot; (ex. making patch work armor out of hides) and <br/>
&gt;if so, what do I need to do this? just a sewing kit, or do I need to use <br/>
&gt;some of my traing ponits in a certain skill area?. I am now on the cusp of <br/>
&gt;tenth LvL, Is that high enough to start hunting what ever creatures will <br/>
&gt;&quot;give&quot; me netted/mesh?. Also, I am a Freeport monk, I hear much talk about <br/>
&gt;the sewers of Qeynos (think that is the place) But nothing of were to hunt <br/>
&gt;for the creatures I am looking for in my area. (Here is a VERY New&#39;b Q, If <br/>
&gt;i do need to go to Qeynos, how do i get there, by boat or try it overland?)<br/>
&gt;I thank you all in advance for your time.<br/>
