<div id="ygrps-yiv-510063321"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;From all that I&#39;ve heard, they do not spawn Grim Oakfist any more, because<br/>
&gt;the treant fist NEEDS to be nerfed first.  And if he does spawn, the tigers<br/>
&gt;will not.  I personally totally agree with this, treant fists are not<br/>
&gt;something we need, they would make up way too powerful and totally throw off<br/>
&gt;game balance.  Come on now, do you really need gloves that have limitless<br/>
&gt;charges of CH?  Let&#39;s plz all play fair  :o)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>	I totally agree, and as a matter of fact they already have <br/>
nerfed the Treant fists.  They have removed the healing proc <br/>
completely.  This makes them a much more reasonable item.  As I said, <br/>
a friend of obtained them yesterday afternoon (post-patch, of course) <br/>
and reports this.  So it seems that the quest is back in place, but <br/>
Voli is in the way of Oakfist spawning.  I&#39;m now back to having to <br/>
deal with him without blowing my well-cared-for faction ratings. :)<br/>
