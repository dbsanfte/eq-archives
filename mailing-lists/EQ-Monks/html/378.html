<div id="ygrps-yiv-788879379">No, you didn&#39;t download an entire zone, and no it&#39;s not feasible to<br/>
implement missing or enhanced graphics. Trust me, I know the fear zone was<br/>
in the game well before it was released. If you do a fresh install, you&#39;ll<br/>
still see those zone files marked fear. You downloaded updated versions of<br/>
some files, but not the entire zone. Go into your EQ folder, see those big<br/>
5-6 meg pak files? Or the 2-3 meg S3D files? You never downloaded those,<br/>
which my estimate is contain the graphic files for each zone. (I say this,<br/>
because whenever they made a bunch of graphic updates in beta, we had to<br/>
download all those files again. ugh.) What you downloaded is an XMI file,<br/>
the little 90k or so files with zone information.<br/>
<br/>
The reason it&#39;s not feasible to implement new graphics is, it would require<br/>
you to download all those nice little graphic files again, and while people<br/>
on fast connections wouldn&#39;t mind, no sane modem user is going to download<br/>
all those huge files, especially when 120k other people are also trying to<br/>
download them. I don&#39;t know why they can&#39;t do it as a separate download, for<br/>
those who want new graphics, or perhaps rework graphics in the original<br/>
zones and put them on the expansion pack on another CD.<br/>
<br/>
Just my two cents, I wish it wasn&#39;t this way - I&#39;d really like to see some<br/>
cool variations in characters and armor. One look at EQ and you feel more<br/>
like you&#39;re playing EverClone. At least monks have their own texture - that<br/>
looks cool - with their newbie shirt that nobody else has.<br/>

&gt;I&#39;m not sure I understand this.  Didn&#39;t they add an entire zone (or maybe<br/>
&gt;it&#39;s even more than one zone, I don&#39;t know), the plane of fear?  Did we<br/>
&gt;download everything necessary for that zone?  If so, I find it difficult to<br/>

Yes we did download an entire zone. If you ever watch your downloads, you<br/>
would have seen files marked &#39;fear&#39;. They did this in multiple downloads<br/>
and patches over a period of about a month or so. So it would be feasable<br/>
to implement missing or enhanced graphics over a period of time with an<br/>
activation que in the last download. Personally I would like to see more of<br/>
a clothing differentiation on every class in the game. To me this is<br/>
important for the reason that if I saw a human Paladin and a Human Shadow<br/>
Night standing side by side, I would not be able to tell the difference.<br/>
What would be good is to have a distinct body style for every class in<br/>
every race. Such as if you chose a Barbarian Warrior over a Barbarian<br/>
Shaman, he/she might be wearing a blue Kilt as a newbie instead of a red<br/>
one. Each clas should have a distinct pattern in which clothing and armor<br/>
is represented on them. The same idea with weaponry as well. But these<br/>
things would best go into the new addition. So those with the newer program<br/>
would see huge differences, while those with the existing one will see<br/>
things much as they are now. *that would help motivate sales for Verant, so<br/>
I think they might be interested*(wink) As far as magic items..well....I<br/>
actually would like to have seen a pair of gloves that raised attack like a<br/>
weapon such as if it had claws, it should feel like them on a mob. That<br/>
could easily be implemented on existing items such as Lupine Gloves. I<br/>
would like to see more versions of the Journeyman boots. Let&#39;s face it, I<br/>
know they want to keep us in the game, but I don&#39;t know of anything that<br/>
can be done about camping except make the item a little more available.<br/>
Sure that defeats the purpose of rare items, but these should be a<br/>
necessity. But then Shamans and Druids would whine about not feeling<br/>
important anymore...so...whatever. :o) But actually the last thing would be<br/>
keeping Monks in the Sacred Tradition of harnessing inner Chi through<br/>
meditation. Meaning, I would  like to see monks get regeneration like<br/>
Trolls have, except maybe make it while sitting only to keep the balance.<br/>
MOnks are supposed to be masters of the human form, so this would fit in<br/>
nicely. To me that would be balanced enough. It isn&#39;t anything overly<br/>
major. Just a little shave off the down time to make Monks a little more<br/>
Monkish.<br/>
Oh and by the way, it is spelled Numchuks, as in Num-Chaku sticks. :o)<br/>
