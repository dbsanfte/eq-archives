<div id="ygrps-yiv-1294792174">I&#39;m sure that you have all noticed that people have been dropping from this <br/>
list like flies, and to tell the truth I&#39;m about ready to quit too.  I <br/>
didn&#39;t sign up to hear people bitch and moan about twinking and spell <br/>
nerfing.  While I&#39;m not positive, I would think that most of you didn&#39;t <br/>
sign up to hear about it either.  Yet that is what fills up my mailbox day <br/>
in and day out now.  Please drop it and lets get back to monks before <br/>
anyone else is alienated from what used to be a worthwhile list.  If it&#39;s <br/>
really an issue for you, just create EQ-Twinkers and EQ-Nerfs mailing lists <br/>
and carry on there.<br/>
