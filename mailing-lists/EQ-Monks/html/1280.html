<b>Subject:</b> Re[2]: What to buy? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-725205323">Decent equipment though I have some suggestions for upgrading:<br/>
<br/>
1) Werewolf hid gloves are very obtainable:<br/>
<br/>
Go to MM and auction to buy some werewolf talons from some of the higher level<br/>
players out there.  A good deal is about 200pp (trust me you might get it for<br/>
free! They are fairly common drop - 2 or three are typically dropped in a 3 hour<br/>
period in the music room).  Take these to Karg Icebear with 75pp (?? double<br/>
check <br/>
that amount)  to earn yourself a pair of Lupine gauntlets.<br/>
<br/>
2) White wolf hide cloak:<br/>
Personally, I would trade the lupine cloak for a White wolfe hide cloak. <br/>
(Better AC) Because of the coolness factor of the werewolf cloak you might get a<br/>
one for one deal (or even get some other goodies thrown in besides if the chap<br/>
is gung ho about it).  But this is just my opinion.  The werewolf cloak is<br/>
definitely cool to have and you should factor this in to the trade you make.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
3) Platinum Fire Opal rings:  (55hp 5 ac)  <br/>
Replace those jaggeds and give yourself a HUGE hp boost)<br/>
 Do you have a Jewel crafting buddy?  If he is a Good friend of yours or in your<br/>
guild he might make you a pair of Platinum fire opal rings AT COST (which<br/>
happens to come to about 600pp).  Go to Genni in Solousek Ro temple bring 550<br/>
*GOLD* pieces per fire opal you are going to buy.  I strongly recommend you  buy<br/>
4 - 5 to give your enchanter friend a high probability of succeeding at making 2<br/>
of these rings.   So take your 2750 in gold bullion, lug on over to Temple SOl<br/>
and buy the rings.  It will cost your enchanter 105pp per Attempt to make the<br/>
rings and the decent thing to do is to pay him his costs.  If he succeeds more<br/>
than twice take the extra ring and sell it for 500-600pp (now you see why<br/>
enchanters have to charge so much for jewelry) and use that to finance the<br/>
lupine gauntlets!  Keep the jaggeds handy though... I am an inspector gadget<br/>
type - I tend to walk around with spare equipment in my backpack so I can<br/>
*optimize* for the various group situations, and there are times when the extra<br/>
6str would be preferred to 110 hp. <br/>
<br/>
4)I am not certain but I think level 29 is high enough to CAMP for the runed<br/>
lava pendant.  great monk neck 5ac 6 str and some fire resists too.  Even if you<br/>
hang on to your agi necklace the runed lava pendant is good addition to both<br/>
your &quot;High AC&quot; and &quot;Human DOT&quot; equipment sets.  I want to get one of these<br/>
myself but I refuse to camp. *sigh*<br/>
<br/>
5)Vox bracer:<br/>
 Get a vox bracer to compliment the errolisi. 7 ac 0.3 wt is great! The resist<br/>
are also great.  I like to think of resists as &quot;CASTER AC&quot;  and am proud of the<br/>
fact that ALL of my resists are above 30 (and I can get em higher with<br/>
specialized equipment).  Vox bracers are cheap. Common drop of King in Perma. <br/>
(100-200pp at the most)<br/>
<br/>
6) Diamodine earings<br/>
In the long run shoot for a pair of these babies.  Truly great monk items. +hp,<br/>
+ac + str.  I love em.  But these are rare enough to be *trade only* or go for<br/>
RIDICULOUS amounts of pp (2-3k or so) so just keep em in mind while you save.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
7) ON the subject of your foot gear:<br/>
I would personally stick with the wolf fur.  Keep the 7 agi ( as you switch out<br/>
the serp bracers and possibly the necklace your agi will drop.  Even though it<br/>
was recently shown to be NOT *as* important as we thought, having an AGI ABOVE<br/>
115 as a monk is a must IMHO.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That is my two coppers.<br/>
Well ok more like 2 plats worth.. (I get carried away when I get the opportunity<br/>
to pontificate about equipment - its my pet thing)<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps!<br/>
