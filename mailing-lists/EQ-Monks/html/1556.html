<div id="ygrps-yiv-2033197571">Under that logic, he should have never been able to progress to 120 untill <br/>
he came close to 24 when he is only 4th.  I think its like these other <br/>
people are saying 100+(5*lvl+5)<br/>

&gt;No, nothing is wrong. The cap for human monk swimming is as you have<br/>
&gt;stated. Lizards are better swimmers innately and begin with swimming<br/>
&gt;mastery. The first poster is using some software package (ShowEQ or<br/>
&gt;something similar) to display a numeric value for his skill. In answer to<br/>
&gt;the first poster&#39;s question, you will not be able to improve your skill<br/>
&gt;beyond 120 until you reach a level that allows you to progress beyond that<br/>
&gt;skill (level 24 in this case).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Best,<br/>
