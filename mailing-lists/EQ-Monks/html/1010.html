&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just because you can&#39;t do it solo doesn&#39;t mean the game is unbalanced. If<br/>
&gt; you could solo Vox, teaming up with just one other person would make the<br/>
&gt; game completely boring.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Do mobs have, in a roleplaying sense, unfair advantages? Sure. So what?<br/>
&gt; PC&#39;s beat them anyway. Verant has had to make mobs tougher, in fact,<br/>
&gt; because players were besting them too easily.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   Moving to a game like Shadowbane ( <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sb.drtwister.com">http://sb.drtwister.com</a> )  , where<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; In the mean time, why not play Ultima Online, power-level a character, and<br/>
&gt; sit just outside of town and PK newbies? Or find a poplular teleport spot<br/>
&gt; in a busy dungeon and &quot;Corp Por&quot; adventurers all day long. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; find that much easier than fighting NPC mobs in EverQuest.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  Ultima hit rock bottom.  I played it for a year and a half.  It was, in<br/>
theory, a good game.  It was fair, in a twisted mindset, to the fact that<br/>
every player had the potential to be as powerful as the next player.  Now, I<br/>
am NOT a Newbie killer and I never was.  I killed many, many individuals in<br/>
fair fights.  I hardly ever exploited (Only a couple times on accident). I<br/>
did powergame, but only because Ultima was not the type of game that was<br/>
enjoyable to work from 0 to 100 manually (not that EQ seems to be now<br/>
either, why I am quitting).  I am, and I admit, a smartass.  Even<br/>
anti-social to a degree in some games.  I do not like everquest any more,<br/>
because the AI simply annoys me.  Leveling is too hard alone.  I know it is<br/>
no longer the game for me.  I loved playing my monk, I also loved playing my<br/>
wizard, and my druid.  I loved it all but I&#39;m leaving now, for Asherons<br/>
Call, and Shadowbane.  It&#39;s not the type of environment I enjoy because it<br/>
makes it almost impossible for me to play it the way I want to.  I myself,<br/>
am making a new guild, the MA (Megalomaniacs Anonymous).  We are going to be<br/>
an online gaming oriented ranting smartass guild.  If, any of you want to<br/>
join, go ahead and ICQ me at 15078928. NOTE:  Guild not good for the<br/>
non-pvpist of heart... and we will not be based on Evercrack... either...<br/>
<br/>
   I&#39;ve come to respect a lot of you people on this list. I will still be<br/>
subscribed so you may get a few heated remarks and arguments started from me<br/>
yet. I have been a silent onlooker almost since a month after EQ came out.<br/>
My knowledge of EQ remains expansive enough to argue and converse with you<br/>
guys, and probably will even after I&#39;ve quit.  I&#39;m probably going to be<br/>
posting a lot more now.  Good luck guys.<br/>
