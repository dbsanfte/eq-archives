<div id="ygrps-yiv-1996518753"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I am a level 7 monk and i have 20 points to spend. Would you recommend i spend them on offensive skills now, save them for later, use them on a skill to make money, or use them on throwing. If on<br/>
&gt; throwing is it a really good skill to get, does it do any damage or is it just to attract animals as ive heard. Thanks for your time.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No matter what, dont use them on offensive skills. Your skills will<br/>
max out at each level as you use them. Waste of points. I&#39;ve found<br/>
Throwing to be a useless skill as well, only using it rarely to lure.<br/>
<br/>
If I were you, I&#39;d save them for Feign Death at level 17.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone but me that feels skill points are pretty useless for monks?<br/>
Hehe, I mean, after you get feign death, how many skills are left? 4?<br/>
5? And most, if not all, monk skills are used in combat constantly, so<br/>
they&#39;ll max out by themselfs.<br/>
<br/>
*shrug* Might just be me...<br/>
