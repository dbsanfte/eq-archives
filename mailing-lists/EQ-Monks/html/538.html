<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-586129514">I would wait a bit longer. I just hit 15 and I&#39;m still a little uncomfortable<br/>
soloing in Oasis. Orc hunting can be a dangerous buisness when you are by<br/>
yourself. Orcs tend to wander a bit, and will help other Orcs they see in a<br/>
fight. A fight can go from one orc to three orcs pretty damn fast.<br/>
<br/>
Even the orcs that con blue to me can still beat me in a fight, if they stun<br/>
me a few times, and my mend fails during the skirmish. Enter Oasis from N Ro<br/>
by the mountain side and you should find some people willing to group. Orcs<br/>
are not the only thing to hunt in Oasis, but they are the ones closet to the<br/>
N Ro zone edge, which I assume is where you&#39;ll be coming from. If you decide<br/>
to venture down the waters edge, you can find some good crocs and caimens to<br/>
kill, but they will be real tough at your level, and it can be loooong way<br/>
back to zone edge from their spawning areas.<br/>
<br/>
Basically, I would wait till I hit 13 (or better yet 14) before Oasis. Even<br/>
then, you&#39;ll be out classed until you get your double attack skill up at<br/>
level 15.<br/>
<br/>
One last tip, if you see &quot;an Orc Warrior&quot;, that&#39;s good. If you see &quot;a Orc<br/>
Warrior&quot; run like hell. That guy is an 18-20th lvl orc capable of dealing out<br/>
over 50 pts damage a round, making him a favorite target for upper teen<br/>
groupings.<br/>
<br/>
One Last Last Tip: Treat Casters with Respect, Kill them First.<br/>

&gt; I am a level 12 (nearly 13) freeport monk who is<br/>
&gt; really happy the way in which his character is going.<br/>
&gt; I think the truly great thing about the monk is that<br/>
&gt; in lower levels we don&#39;t have near as many expensizes<br/>
&gt; as other races.  Like at 12 I have 50plat in bank and<br/>
&gt; I would have 80 except yesterday I bought a Lockjaw<br/>
&gt; hide vest and a snakeskin mask.  All the other people<br/>
&gt; around my level seem to be short on cash.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; On to my question, at what level can I go into oasis.<br/>
&gt; I mean so I can walk in solo and still kill some guys<br/>
&gt; while I am trying to find a group?<br/>
