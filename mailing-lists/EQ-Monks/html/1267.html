Since the beginning of my training, I was suspicious of the advantages of DEX<br/>
and AGI--I am not so certain that many monks were surprised by the information<br/>
to which you are refering. I favored AGI improvements as they also contributed<br/>
to improvements in AC. But I will say that AC and STR can both be increased<br/>
with little trouble. I do not think I would change the allocation of my start<br/>
points which I largely divided between STR and AGI; I might have put more into<br/>
STR than I did. Basically, the distribution of your starting points will have<br/>
less to do with your success than the acquisition of items and the training of<br/>
your skills later on. Any real changes in ATK value and AC from STR and AGI,<br/>
respectively doesn&#39;t occur until each five point increment, so keep that in<br/>
mind when arming yourself and distributing points. My preference, as of late,<br/>
however has been to add AC every chance I get. I have substituted a Serpentine<br/>
Bracer with a Bracer of Erolissi, and have added a pair of Jagged Bands. What<br/>
you may notice is that often when adding AC with certain items you will<br/>
enhance<br/>
STR along with it.<br/>

&gt;So, folks, we all recently heard *with disappointment* about verant<br/>
&gt;employees posting about DEX and AGI - they seem to be a lot less important<br/>
&gt;than we hoped for.  In light of this new information - what do all you monks<br/>
&gt;out there see as the most important stats for a monk, now? How would you<br/>
&gt;focus your items (ie STR? AC? HPS? AGI? DEX? STA?)? And how would you<br/>
&gt;distribute your starting points?  Maybe a few could name some equipment that<br/>
&gt;backs up their opinions.<br/>
&gt;Thanks in advance for everyone&#39;s input =)<br/>
