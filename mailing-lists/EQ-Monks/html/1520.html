&gt; Can someone point out a negative of the iksar? All I see so far is<br/>
&gt; the 20% exp penatly. And they&#39;re butt ugly :)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, there&#39;s the faction issue.  I&#39;ve heard they are KOS in every<br/>
&quot;old&quot; city (not true; they&#39;re ok at least in PART of freeport, but so<br/>
are DE&#39;s).<br/>
<br/>
The 20% XP penalty is over _baseline_, and humans are 10% UNDER<br/>
baseline, so compared to humans, Iksar&#39;s have a 33 1/3% penalty, which<br/>
is significant.<br/>
<br/>
They can&#39;t wear some things humans can.  (But the reverse is true<br/>
also)<br/>
<br/>
They have a slower delay in H2H, which I think is about 20% slower, if<br/>
memory serves.  Thats a big deal for monks.  Less so for other<br/>
classes, tanks included.<br/>
<br/>
But, the advantages are:<br/>
- swimming  (nice, not necessary)<br/>
- regen (HUGE!)<br/>
- night vision (nice for some, deal maker for others)<br/>
- higher natural AC/higher base AGI (nice for monks, less so for tanks<br/>
                                     since they can&#39;t wear plate,<br/>
                                     tanks have other issues.)<br/>
- forage (nice, but getting nicer the more I use it)<br/>
- awesome newbie zones, with decent quests<br/>
<br/>
So, as *I* see it, they are certainly more well rounded for a monk;<br/>
they are less dependant on the outside world (they can heal/mend/bind<br/>
wounds), get their own food/water, have better natural defenses, and<br/>
can see at night.<br/>
<br/>
I love tanks, and I love monks, so this was a natural fit for me.  I<br/>
love &#39;em.<br/>
