<div id="ygrps-yiv-1394793461">at an ID skill lvl of 108 I can suscesfully pass the skill check multiple<br/>
times a fight against a hard blue.<br/>
<br/>
I was able to solo the firescale crock (~lvl 30) at lvl 33, with id<br/>
working 3 times, 2 of thoes were back to back.<br/>
<br/>
id put every point into it you can, then go out and purchace a gravis<br/>
digital extream game pad, and set up a macro to practice it over night.<br/>
(you dont have to fear something to make a skill increase, so I target a<br/>
mecrchent and go feign next to a guard).<br/>
<br/>
also, as someone mentioned, you cannot have a special skill greyed out<br/>
when the skill check happens (the your not scaring anyone message). so I<br/>
alternate between flying kick and ID.<br/>

&gt; Ok, this line of discussion brings up a tough question.  I&#39;ve been saving<br/>
&gt; points for dragon punch coming up.  I&#39;ll have 25 points when I get it.  Is<br/>
&gt; instill doubt good enough that I should put some of the saved up points into<br/>
&gt; it, instead of the special attack?  Any advice here in either direction?<br/>

&gt; 		Oh yea, I forgot the stop attacking thingy too.  Hehe.  As<br/>
&gt; far as instill <br/>
&gt; 		doubt goes, its the hardest skill I have ever had to raise.<br/>
&gt; I hit the <br/>
&gt; 		instill doubt button constantly, targeting anything I can,<br/>
&gt; and I think mine <br/>
&gt; 		is like 35th.  And the key to getting it to work is make<br/>
&gt; sure the ONLY thing <br/>
&gt; 		you are doing to your target is auto attack, no special<br/>
&gt; attacks, and your <br/>
&gt; 		special attacks button has to be up (Tiger Claw, etc) and<br/>
&gt; then hit your <br/>
&gt; 		instill doubt.  Now, chances are the next result you will<br/>
&gt; see is it telling <br/>
&gt; 		you &quot;You aren&#39;t scaring anyone&quot;.  Hehe if you are REALLY<br/>
&gt; lucky and get it to <br/>
&gt; 		work (I think I have gotten it to work like 3 or 4 times),<br/>
&gt; it should have <br/>
&gt; 		the same effect as the 4th level necro spell, and make them<br/>
&gt; start to run <br/>
&gt; 		away for 10-30 seconds.  Only you don&#39;t get the nifty flying<br/>
&gt; skulls.<br/>
