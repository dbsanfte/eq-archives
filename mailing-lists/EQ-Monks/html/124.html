<div id="ygrps-yiv-2141212458">I disagree about throwing. I hunt with an enchanter mostly, and having a<br/>
ranged attack to pull critters is wonderful. It doesnt really matter if you<br/>
advance the skill or not, as even if you miss, the critter still gets peeved<br/>
that you tried to hit it and comes runnin after you. So as a tool, throwing<br/>
is great. Just dont expect to do any damage.<br/>

&gt; Do NOT spend points on offensive anything. They will develope fast enough<br/>
&gt; in <br/>
&gt; combat. Save them for later. Put one or two practices into a new skill and<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; then leave it. for example your next big skill is Sneak just put one or<br/>
&gt; two <br/>
&gt; and then practice it just by itself.<br/>
&gt; I would not worry about learning throwing. In my opinion it doesn&#39;t do a <br/>
&gt; whole lot.<br/>
