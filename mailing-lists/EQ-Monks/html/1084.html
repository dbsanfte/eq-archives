<div id="ygrps-yiv-205007925">Well i think the slowdown may be partially due to overcrowding.  also it seems<br/>
whenever i go down into lower guk everyone already has a group of 6 or are <br/>
higher<br/>
levels with a smaller group that don&#39;t need 6.<br/>

&gt;I haven&#39;t been told that, in those exact words - but I have found slower<br/>
&gt;(And fewer) responses to &quot;Monk looking for work&quot; shouts.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And there have been some heated battles between know-it-all wizards, necros<br/>
&gt;and druids who tell me that FD does to still work and I&#39;m just not good at<br/>
&gt;it :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>HEH.  This was my point.  I have seen a lot of griping that this fd patch makes<br/>
monks useless and they won&#39;t be able to find a group, etc.  I know for me, <br/>
personally<br/>
i don&#39;t care and would accept anyone in the group if we needed a person and had<br/>
an opening.  heck, you probably don&#39;t want to group with the power gamers who<br/>
would turn you down just because of that anyway.  Anyway, I just wanted to see<br/>
if this was empty rhetoric or if there really was a difference in finding a <br/>
group.<br/>
<br/>
I think I have my answer.</div>
