<br/>
Guilty.<br/>
<br/>
Not with my monk, as I set him up with a specific RP philosphy.  No twinkage<br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
Got a little bored with Lei.  Started an Erudite Enchanter.  Being low level<br/>
again sucked.  Especially as an Enchanter.  So I figured on some nice<br/>
healthy twinkage should squeeze me through these crap times onto when<br/>
Enchanters get to be fun.<br/>
<br/>
Moderately heavy twinkage.  Haha!  I am a bad ass now!  Problem solved?<br/>
Nope.  After a while, I just figured no matter how cool they seem,<br/>
enchanters just aren&#39;t for me.<br/>
<br/>
Back to Lei.  Having much fun, but I feel the dark side calling.<br/>
<br/>
A DE Necro is born.  My god is this character fun!  Even at level one!  Life<br/>
tap has to be the coolest spell ever made!  /pet kill  Muhahahaha!  Evil is<br/>
good!  I&#39;m having a ton of fun with this character and have no particular<br/>
desire to twink her.  She&#39;s doing just fine on her own.<br/>
<br/>
So, my thoughts on twinking?  <br/>
<br/>
*shrug*  I can see both sides.<br/>
<br/>
In the end, no matter what I say or do, some people are going to twink and<br/>
others aren&#39;t.  Ultimately, it&#39;s up to Verant to decide if they want<br/>
twinking or not.<br/>
