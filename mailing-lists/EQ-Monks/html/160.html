<b>Subject:</b> Skill cap on Dual Wield? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-745088599">Just hit 29 (*Shivers at the thought of being so close to <br/>
finally getting Flying Kick*) and all of my skills have capped, but <br/>
there as been no movement on Dual Wield since it hit 198 back during <br/>
level 28.  Should I be worried?  Is there a skill cap on this that <br/>
I&#39;ve hit like I did with sneak back at 113?  Anybody know for sure <br/>
whether or not they have gotten past this number?<br/>
