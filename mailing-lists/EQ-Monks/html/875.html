(Hit A then feign). <br/>

You know it works when you do not see any message.  If you see a message<br/>
&quot;Monk has fallen to the ground&quot;, it&#39;s failed.  Get up run for 8 seconds<br/>
or trying fighting, whichever you want to do.  then get ready to feign<br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
Also, if something is casting a spell on you, it will always hit you,<br/>
there is no escape.<br/>

&gt; I just got the skill, and used all my practices to max it. Now i was <br/>
&gt; wondering if anyone has any tips as hhow to make it work more reliably, and a <br/>
&gt; list of the types of (or individual) mobs that can see through it.<br/>
