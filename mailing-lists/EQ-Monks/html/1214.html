&gt; A snaring glove or 1h blunt weapon would be an unlikely development.<br/>
Monks role<br/>
&gt; in a group is to do massive melee damge (reducing the  load on the casters<br/>
mana<br/>
&gt; at high levels).  To give us snare would weaken the ranger/druid role from<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; group some. Snare would be AWSOME, but it would mean we monks become to<br/>
&gt; powerful. able to solo in dungeons and area we were never meant to solo.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; While on the subject of monk items:<br/>
&gt; I have a question for all of you who did the treant fist quest.<br/>
&gt; I have spent about 15hours (total in two marathon sessions) camping for<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; humorous handheld mace off the alchemist in the  Xorb gorge.  I have<br/>
killed the<br/>
&gt; two goblin guards there till I am blue in the face.  Nothing has made that<br/>
&gt; alchemist spawn.  Is there a trick to doing so?  Last night I spent about<br/>
10<br/>
&gt; hours at it (and I picked up the camp from a guy who had been there for 4<br/>
hours<br/>
&gt; before me and had to go to bed)  So if you think about it in 14 hours of<br/>
&gt; non-stop camping he never showed.  Anyone who has done the quest can help<br/>
me out<br/>
&gt; with some advice?   I thought this guy was a 8-10 hour spawn?<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt; Snare would be great.  Stun would be nice too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Perhaps ones that proc some sort of flame-based or force-based DoT.<br/>
&quot;target<br/>
&gt; is slammed by an intense force&quot; or something like that.  Think of it as<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; monk focussing his ki into an attack.<br/>

&gt; &gt; for fun, what would you want something to proc? personally, I really<br/>
wish<br/>
&gt; &gt; I had a good mid lvl set of gloves that proced snare.  most usefull<br/>
spell<br/>
&gt; &gt; in the game imho.  then I could solo in dungeons that most people dont<br/>
go<br/>
&gt; &gt; into..upper guk, runnyeye, sola..etc.<br/>
