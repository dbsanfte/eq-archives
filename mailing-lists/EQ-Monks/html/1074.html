<b>Subject:</b> Rules Changing <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1896666396">All rules are subject to change.....<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s take professional sports as an example. Players on pro sports<br/>
teams make friends on the team that they only see when they are<br/>
playing/practicing. They only talk to them on the sidelines/in the<br/>
dugout/at practices. It&#39;s still just a game, not a way of life. And when<br/>
the rules change, and they do every so often, the players don&#39;t quit,<br/>
they find ways to deal with the rule changes and the game goes on. No<br/>
one quit being an offensive lineman when Football changed the rules and<br/>
made it illegal for offensive linemen to use their hands (they used to<br/>
be able to grab defensive linemen with their hands, now its called<br/>
holding...). No one quit pro Basketball when they made it illegal to<br/>
stand under the basket as long as you wanted or help guide a shot in (<br/>
you used to be able camp out under the basket as long as you wanted and<br/>
guide anything in, now its a 3-second violation and offensive goal<br/>
tending, thanks in a large part to Wilt Chamberlin using both these<br/>
tactics to score 100 points in a single game...). No one quit Baseball<br/>
when they added the DH nor did they quit Football when they added the<br/>
forward pass (it used to be illegal to throw the ball forward, I&#39;m sure<br/>
lots of defenses were P.O.&#39;d and thought the game was ruined, but they<br/>
kept playing and found ways to deal with it...)  Lots of things will<br/>
change in life, and some will seem very unfair, but whinning never<br/>
solved any problems, and I know of no one who won anything by<br/>
quitting...<br/>
