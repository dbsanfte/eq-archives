<div id="ygrps-yiv-1562758597">yes... but we are a very selfish class...<br/>
another words... what do we do when everyone in the party is dying..<br/>
heal them?... no.<br/>
taunt?... no<br/>
wonder if feign death is gonna save our ass?... yes<br/>
to me that kinda sucks...<br/>
i like being able to help out in bad situations...<br/>
yes.. it would be nice to have taunt...<br/>
or maybe a death touch that does alot of dmg to get the mobs attention<br/>
(could recycle once an hour or so.)<br/>
or how about being able to use our mend on someone besides yourself... very<br/>
minor but better than nothing.<br/>
i like to help ppl out.. especially my party.<br/>
i loan out money.. and give away items all the time...<br/>
and i&#39;m thankfull i can @least do that.<br/>
but sure would be nice to be able to save lives.<br/>
almost every class with the exception of us and rogues can do something.<br/>
<br/>
ranger, sk, warrior can taunt<br/>
druid, wizzard can evac<br/>
necro, enchanter can mez<br/>
cleric can heal and res<br/>
i&#39;m pretty sure mage pets can taunt or @they could blast a mob to get em off<br/>
an evacer or cleric.<br/>
hopefully one day rogues will be able to detect traps.<br/>
<br/>
if i left out a class i just couldn&#39;t think of it.<br/>
ohh yeah... we got instill doubt... ohh boy.. but all i&#39;ve heard is that it<br/>
sucks.<br/>
from both rogues and bards.<br/>
it hardly ever works and when it does it just causes trains.(&#39;<br/>
and how the hell am i gonna fit it on my quick keys?<br/>
<br/>
i guess my whole point is i want a party to feel like i can help them out<br/>
when things get bad.<br/>
if you don&#39;t care about that then thats fine...<br/>
but i don&#39;t think roleplaying is gonna make u feel any better when your<br/>
whole party is dead and your lying on the floor feeling like crap because u<br/>
couldn&#39;t taunt the mob off of your evacer or off your cleric.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s the thing.  In EQ, there&#39;s not supposed to be a BEST class.  Each and<br/>
every class will have its ups and downs, and, in the end, we all need each<br/>
other.  Sure, there might be imbalances at times, but I don&#39;t think you&#39;re<br/>
going<br/>
to find a lot of groups refusing you just because you&#39;re a monk.  If they<br/>
do,<br/>
you probably didn&#39;t want to group with them anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I love playing a monk.  Not because we&#39;re the BEST class in the<br/>
game<br/>
or do more melee damage than anyone else, but because the monk class is one<br/>
of<br/>
the most unique classes in the game.  Who else dishes out as much damage as<br/>
we<br/>
do with their bare hands?  Who else has as much AC as we do while wearing<br/>
plain<br/>
looking clothes? (Yes, I _like_ looking ordinary.)  Who else has a cool<br/>
flying<br/>
kick?  Who else (besides rogues) can jump from Kelethin and survive?  For<br/>
me, <br/>
playing a monk is enjoyable not because I&#39;m the best figher in the game, but<br/>
<br/>
because monks are unique and fun to roleplay.<br/>
<br/>
But then, that&#39;s just my opinion.  Go forth, and form your own.<br/>
