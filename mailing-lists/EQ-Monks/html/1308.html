<div id="ygrps-yiv-273826852">My apologies, Shelza, I was too quick to judge your intentions there.<br/>
However I still think Harrick is far better off ignoring equipment for the<br/>
moment.  The best equipment he could save up for right now would be:<br/>
<br/>
Onyx earrings (2 agi) 5pp or so from Blackburrow<br/>
Spiked collar (ac3 3str) 5pp or so from Blackburrow<br/>
Lockjaw vest (ac12 5sta) 20-30pp from Oasis<br/>
Bracer of erolisi (ac5 5str) 25-30pp from Ocean of Tears<br/>
<br/>
The Wu&#39;s gauntlets is not worth the money for him right now.<br/>
<br/>
To be perfectly honest, Shelza, cured silk can stay in a lot of locations on a<br/>
monk until he or she hits the planes.  Swap out to gear that gives you better<br/>
AC/HP than cured as you can afford it, but it&#39;s only going to make a<br/>
marginal improvement in combat performance for each piece of armor you<br/>
trade out. Levels and skills are what this game is really about.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;First off, I am not twinked, every thing I got I earned the money for<br/>
&gt;myself.  As a monk this is really easy to do as monks dont have anything to<br/>
&gt;spend money on but good armor.  By the time I was 10th level, I had over 100<br/>
&gt;plat saved, by the time I reached 18th I had bought and sold over 1000 plat<br/>
&gt;worth of stuff, all done by money and items I have earned myself by selling<br/>
&gt;loot or trade skills.  One good one is mesh.  Poke your head into Guk and<br/>
&gt;you can just about get that stuff free off of the people in there....they<br/>
&gt;have it comming out of thier ears.  I would also rather have things like a<br/>
&gt;spiked collar (easily obtainable in Black Burrow) than the cured silk<br/>
&gt;counterpart.  Man, I give someone valuble information, such as the location<br/>
&gt;to where he can find a list of just about EVERY item a monk can wear, what<br/>
&gt;the stats are and more importantly where he can get them and how much they<br/>
&gt;usually sell for, so he can judge whether or not they are obtainable or not,<br/>
&gt;and you jump me with an offensive letter like this?  Learn some manners.<br/>
&gt;What I am tired is, people like you jumping to conclutions when you have<br/>
&gt;absolutely no idea what you are talking about.  The worst part is, I wasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;insulting his armor, I was offering good, helpfull information.  I never<br/>
&gt;said ANYTHING like &quot;oh well cure silk is crap compaired to Shiverback, you<br/>
&gt;should get a full suit of that&quot;.  If you knew anything, you yourself would<br/>
&gt;know there are little peices people can pick up here and there to improve<br/>
&gt;over something as rudimentary as cured silk is.<br/>
&gt;Anyway, do yourself a favor, think before you type...and maybe you should<br/>
&gt;check on stomped, you might find there is a peice of armor you could easily<br/>
&gt;replace with something better.  Getting eq doesn&#39;t always involve camping<br/>
&gt;45+ mobs.  Anyway.<br/>
