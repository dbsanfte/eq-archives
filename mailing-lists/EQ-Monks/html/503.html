<div id="ygrps-yiv-1003666799">Get yourself 4 more levels and they will bow down to you. Also you have only<br/>
had dragon punch for 1 level now it is weak once you get ready to dump it<br/>
you will be doing mid 30s with that. It does take awhile to go up but once<br/>
it does look out. at 30 35 40 45 and 50 I have heard that we get +3 to all<br/>
damage. I have seen increases in damage at these levels close to this but I<br/>
can not confirm that it is this increase or just my attack going up. Be<br/>
patience you are a monk after all master of body and mind.<br/>

&gt; Ok, this is a question because I am getting frustrated. I have had kills<br/>
&gt; taken from me twice by a 24th lvl Ranger duel wielding some kind of whip<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; some sword, plus I have had a kill taken by a 24th lvl Paladin with a SBH.<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; am a 26th lvl Monk with just about everything that seems to come<br/>
recommended<br/>
&gt; for equipment. I was hitting first in all three of these fights and then<br/>
they<br/>
&gt; started hitting. When am I going to do a lot more damage then them? I hit<br/>
&gt; more often but my hits are in the 10 to 15 hp range typically with a few<br/>
&gt; higher but a few lower. The Ranger was hitting in the mid 20&#39;s to lower<br/>
30&#39;s<br/>
&gt; range with some lower but some higher as well. The Paladin was hitting in<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; mid to upper 30&#39;s. If Monks do so much more damage how did they get the<br/>
&gt; kills? I have everything I thought I was supposed to have. My STR is 97,<br/>
STA<br/>
&gt; 99, DEX 113, and AGI 110. I have never seen myself doing more damage then<br/>
&gt; those other classes around me unless they are significantly lower then I<br/>
am.<br/>
&gt; What is a Monks place in a group? Tank? No. What is the place of a Monk?<br/>
The<br/>
&gt; only thing I can do fairly well is pull from crowded places because I can<br/>
&gt; manipulate my Feign well enough to pick out one or two things. In most<br/>
places<br/>
&gt; I have found that is not a great thing for a group. I have never heard<br/>
people<br/>
&gt; give out a call &quot;looking for a great puller&quot; when I stand in a zone<br/>
looking<br/>
&gt; for a group. I also do not think the comparisons should be made with the<br/>
&gt; Warrior considering I think we both got the short end when it comes to<br/>
&gt; balance. What can a warrior do that a Paladin cannot do most of the time?<br/>
The<br/>
&gt; only thing that is worse off is a Thief. We do not deal the damage in<br/>
groups.<br/>
&gt; That is the casters job. We are designed like a tank and tanks are<br/>
supposed<br/>
&gt; to take damage and that we cannot do. A warrior can do that at least but I<br/>
&gt; have found a Ranger or a Paladin can do that just as well with a good<br/>
healer<br/>
&gt; on board. Well, go ahead and grill me for my views. I play a Monk and I am<br/>
&gt; 26th level but I have disliked the class since 12th level. I continue to<br/>
look<br/>
&gt; for the redeeming qualities. Before you just dismiss me with saying stop<br/>
&gt; playing the class then moron. I continue because I have friends and to<br/>
start<br/>
&gt; over would mean I would not be able to group with them. I am just looking<br/>
for<br/>
&gt; a way to redeem my Monk to myself and present myself with the most value<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; any group.<br/>
