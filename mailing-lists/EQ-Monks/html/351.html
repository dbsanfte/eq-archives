Monks definetly need a weapon that proces  (casts a spell)<br/>
Maybe brass knuckles or a multi spiked glove(s) with cool graphics!<br/>
They could proc some DD spell, maybe a greater heal spell or a<br/>
clinging/dooming darkness - at high levels Monks have trouble becase we<br/>
cant root, Clining/Dooming darkness is cool because it slows the critter<br/>
down to a crawl and does good DOT damge.<br/>

&gt; A monk only weapon, now before someone say but out fists are our weapons<br/>
&gt; listen for a sec.  Wouldn&#39;t it be cool if there were magic gloves with<br/>
&gt; effects?  I personally would love to wield a pair of gloves that cast an<br/>
&gt; effect, like life tap or shock of frost.  There are just not enough Monk<br/>
&gt; only stuff out there, other then the PoF stuff and the sashes and head bands<br/>
&gt; I think this would be a nice addition, maybe along with a nifty looking robe<br/>
&gt; for monks.<br/>
