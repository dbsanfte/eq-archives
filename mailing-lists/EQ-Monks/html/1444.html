<div id="ygrps-yiv-226450919">Make sure to stop attacking for a sec before you fd.  Then it should work a<br/>
lot more than it fails at lvl 70 skill.  <br/>
<br/>
Sneak is fantastic when you are the scout and mapping out a new dungeon.<br/>
When other characters would get wiped out, you can sneak past guards.  Hehe,<br/>
when that fails, you just fd.  Works out great.  (You haven&#39;t had fun till<br/>
you scout out a dungeon full of red mob&#39;s with another monk.  You and the<br/>
other monk can sneak around, fd when needed, then find lower level mobs to<br/>
wipe out before the red ones find you.)  <br/>
<br/>
Someone else will have to answer about instill doubt.  I haven&#39;t had good<br/>
luck with it either.  <br/>

		I got feign death last level and have had no luck with it at<br/>
all. <br/>
		I&#39;ve been faithfully practicing (my death screams are still<br/>
ringing<br/>
		in my ears) and my skill is up to around 70, but it&#39;s only<br/>
worked one<br/>
		time.  Will this ever be useful?  Also what good is sneak<br/>
and instill<br/>
		doubt?<br/>
<br/>
		Thanks,<br/>
