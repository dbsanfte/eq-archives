  Subject: [EQ-Monks] Warrior Petition?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
      What I want to know is what is with this warrior petition.  Granted<br/>
maybe the warrior class is not really any better than the paladin class in<br/>
melee (and it is, IMHO), but why should warriors get another big boost over<br/>
the already humbled monk?  Despite the fact that we get feign death<br/>
eventually, our armor class and atttack does not usually equal that of a<br/>
warrior, which is alright now, but if they get another boost, where is this<br/>
going to leave the monk.  I for one am against the warrior update, unless<br/>
the make a minimal change to the monk class.  I&#39;m not asking for much, I&#39;m<br/>
just asking for something that by making the warrior &quot;king of melee&quot; that<br/>
they just not leave the monks in the dust.<br/>
