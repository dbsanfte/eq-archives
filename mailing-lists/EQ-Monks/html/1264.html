<div id="ygrps-yiv-1876195817">Guess I reacted a little strongly too ... just get really annoyed with<br/>
the way some people act in EQ.  Nothing wrong with bartering or<br/>
haggling but some people get obnoxious with it.<br/>
<br/>
I know: It&#39;s their game too.  I concede that I don&#39;t have a right to<br/>
condemn them.  But I will and you can&#39;t stop me!<br/>
<br/>
Just out of interest ... anyone ever tried to work out how much<br/>
copper, silver and gold a monk would drop in getting to lvl 50?<br/>
