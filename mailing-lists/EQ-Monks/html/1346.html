<b>Subject:</b> Re[2]:Experience and Twinking <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-524178542">The main argument for Twinking was that:<br/>
<br/>
Twinks cause high level characters to camp for items, preventing regular players<br/>
from having access to the spawns.  Its not the twinking that is the problem<br/>
here, its the Kill stealing, spawn hogging Asshole who refuses to show other<br/>
players respect.  Somehow making twinking impossible or difficult will not stop<br/>
this type of player.  He might just sell the item on Ebay, or use it to twink a<br/>
friends character instead, or &quot;Farm&quot; the spawn for in-game trading purposes. <br/>
Infact I think 99.9% of the level 50&#39;s hanging out in low level camping spots<br/>
are NOT doing so because of twinking.<br/>
<br/>
Most twinks are started when one character on an account reaches level 50 and<br/>
they get bored, or decide to spice up the monotony of their EQ life with a new<br/>
race/class selection.  Most of the time what happens is they happen to win a<br/>
random on a class specific Uber item. Or take a look at all the mid - high level<br/>
junk sitting in their bank account and realize that if they trade this so-and-so<br/>
for that so-and-so they could have a fully decked out Troll SK..etc etc.  What<br/>
happened with me is that I FINALLY won a random on a haste sash and then<br/>
realized that I didnt want it because I would rather have the AC and stat buffs<br/>
from my PoF belt.  So I was going to trade the item then realized there was<br/>
NOTHING *tradeable* that i wanted in the entire game (all that I needed was the<br/>
no-drop stuff in the PoF/HATE/SKY)! (except maybe gauntlets of fiery might - and<br/>
noone will be trading those for a LOOOOONG time)  So I was faced with the<br/>
realization that I had a &quot;worthless&quot; sash sitting in my bank. I realized that I<br/>
had a good deal of additional monk uber items kicking around - diamondine<br/>
earings, and some wolf fur slippers.  So I created inno ( I had always admired<br/>
monks) And here I am today.  <br/>
<br/>
Fact is most of my friends (those who have twinks - and trust me, we ALL do, and<br/>
I promise you you will too when you get to my level) started twninks in almost<br/>
exactly the same way.  Ofcourse those people whose main characters were KSing<br/>
ASSHOLEs, will go about twinking in an ASSHOLE-like manner.  My point is that it<br/>
is the ASSHOLE, and not the twinking that is the problem.  ASSHOLES will be<br/>
ASSHOLES even if they can no longer twink.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A second way that twinks get started is that a character reaches the high 20&#39;s<br/>
early 30&#39;s and realizes they dont like thier class, or that they got their<br/>
starting stats all wrong.. and scraps that character donating all of his<br/>
equipment to the new one they create.  Surely you cant argue that this is wrong,<br/>
everyone makes mistakes, or changes their mind once in a while.  IF you have 2<br/>
months invested in a character, how can you say it is fair to tell that person<br/>
that their new character cannot reap *some* of the benefits of their previous<br/>
months work.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Twinkers RIGHTS!<br/>
<br/>
I would say that I have earned my right to twink. ALL of you playing the game<br/>
today, owe me and all the other pioneers a debt of gratitude.  Who do you think<br/>
writes all those quest walk throughs?  How is that you came by that knowledge of<br/>
exactly where that item is dropped?  You take for granted the fact that you can<br/>
walk into a dungeon, hang out by the zone and auction for a group, but when I<br/>
hit level 30 ( and I was one of the first to do - way back in March! ) I spent<br/>
lots and lots and lots of deaths figuring out the dungeons all over NOrrath. I<br/>
was in FuLL Bronze back then and VERY VERY VERY proud of it!  I weilded a Black<br/>
iron Bastard sword (Ghoulbane had not been found yet) and I thought I was DA<br/>
BOMB! This is NEWBIE gear now a days, largely due to the deflationary influence<br/>
of the pioneering players trading off their old equipment and discovering the<br/>
spawns so that everyone knows how/where to camp the items. <br/>
<br/>
Every player today, even the untwinked ones, owes a lot to the pioneers. You can<br/>
BUY items at a trade bazaar at unbelievably cheap prices, these are the same<br/>
items I would have spent HOURS searching for the spawn, or xp dying while<br/>
learning how to pull the area.  YOu take for granted the fact that you can pick<br/>
up a serp bracer for 200pp, a BIBS for 500pp, bronze armor at 6pp a peice! <br/>
These were once *status* items that would probably not have even been traded for<br/>
6 or 7 months ago.<br/>
<br/>
Excuse me If I want to just take some of the excess items I have acccumulated<br/>
over the months ( and once you start going to the PoF/HATE/etc you will start to<br/>
PILE stuff up!) and creat a Uber character of my choosing!  I have invested 9<br/>
months into my first character, I dont see it as fair to require me to invest<br/>
ANOTHER 9 months in a new one!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I accept your argument on this conditionally, since my field of expertise<br/>
is emergency medicine and not computer programming.  Couldn&#39;t they have<br/>
added this into the Ruins of Kunark expansion?  Wouldn&#39;t an expansion of<br/>
that size have taken a great deal of programmer time?<br/>
