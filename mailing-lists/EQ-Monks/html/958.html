&gt; ---------------------<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Feign Death was recently changed by the Tuning Team to reflect evolving<br/>
&gt; gameplay issues.  Since two of the three classes that get Feign Death get<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; through spells, I thought this might be a good place to explain the<br/>
changes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Previously, when you used Feign Death (and assuming you cast the spell<br/>
&gt; successfully or, in the case of the Monk, made your skill roll) hostile<br/>
&gt; monsters would decided that you were dead and wander off.  When you later<br/>
&gt; got up, they would still remember that they were angry with you.  If you<br/>
&gt; were within sight, they would immediately come after you.  If not, they<br/>
&gt; would come after you at some later point.  This might happen within a few<br/>
&gt; minutes, or could happen even a few hours later.  The only way to be<br/>
&gt; absolutely sure that a monster had forgotten about you was to zone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; With our new changes, about a third of the time that you successfully<br/>
Feign<br/>
&gt; Death, the monster will immediately forget about you, similar to an<br/>
&gt; Enchanter casting Memory Blur.  If they do NOT forget about you, they will<br/>
&gt; immediately come after you when you stand up.  No more monsters coming<br/>
back<br/>
&gt; at irregular amounts of time - it should be immediate or not at all.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is a change - the old way, if you Feigned Death a SINGLE TIME, the<br/>
&gt; monster would ALWAYS  remember you.  This way, they remember you about<br/>
&gt; two-thirds of the time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Using the old Feign Death, you could Feign Death multiple times to try to<br/>
&gt; confuse the monster.  After about seven or eight times doing this, most<br/>
&gt; monsters would eventually forget they were mad at you.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; With the new Feign Death, if you Feign Death once the monster has about a<br/>
65<br/>
&gt; percent chance of remembering you.  Twice and the monster has about a 50<br/>
&gt; percent chance of remembering you.  Four times means about 20 percent, and<br/>
&gt; six times means about 8 percent.  This is very similar to the old Feign<br/>
&gt; Death.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Another addition to the new Feign Death involves a monster &quot;going home.&quot;<br/>
&gt; When you Feign Death, most monsters will return to where they were before<br/>
&gt; the fight.  If a monster returns to its initial location, it will<br/>
&gt; immediately forget about you greater then 90 percent of the time.<br/>
&gt; Therefore, if you Feign Death and stay down long enough for a monster to<br/>
&quot;go<br/>
&gt; home,&quot; you should be safe when you stand up a majority of the time.  If<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; monster IS still mad at you, it will return immediately, rather then<br/>
&gt; wandering back later at some irregular interval.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; *FEIGN DEATH UPDATE*<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; After further testing and watching these changes on the Live verses the<br/>
Test<br/>
&gt; Server, we will bechanging Feign Death again on the next patch.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; New changes will make it so that if the creature is less than level 35,<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; monster will always forget about you. If the creature greater then level<br/>
35,<br/>
&gt; then the monster will use the changes detailed above.<br/>

&gt; This last update seems great  :)<br/>
