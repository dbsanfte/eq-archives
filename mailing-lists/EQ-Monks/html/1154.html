<b>Subject:</b> RE: Issues with the new damage. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-120607581"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Now I am by no means Crazy enough to complain about the impending<br/>
 </span></blockquote>enhancements. But I just wanted to share with some of you issues that we<br/>
monks wil  face once the patch goes in.<br/>
<br/>
Here we go. Time to start another incident.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Every monk above level 20 will be doing a good deal more damage - 15% more<br/>
 </span></blockquote>by level 50.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe, how the delay is being changed, I don&#39;t know. If you re-read GA&#39;s<br/>
post you could take what he said as the delay cap for the fist is being<br/>
lowered, but the actual delay isn&#39;t. Possible translation: Augmentation,<br/>
Alacrity, and Haste Items will HELP YOU MORE, but your fist Delay MAY NOT<br/>
improve. Not a straight answer either way.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m open to corrections and other thoughts on this, particularly from<br/>
Brother Choy.<br/>
<br/>
(changing the order of the next few statements)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;What this means is that like rogues we will be doing &quot;hella taunts&quot; with<br/>
 </span></blockquote>our whirling fists.  I may also start using easgle strike a bit more (it<br/>
taunts alot less than kick and does almost as much damage).<br/>
<br/>
None of your special attacks acts as a taunt, its _strictly_ damage based.<br/>
Monsters agro you based on the amount of damage you&#39;re doing, not the attack<br/>
doing the damage. (Referring to monk attacks only.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I recommend you all dump some of your dex and agi gear (keep agi above 120,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>but drop dex like a rock - detailed log studies show it is useless to us!)<br/>
and switch it out for AC stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Well, it should depend somewhat on whom you&#39;re grouping with. I have<br/>
personally been trying to up my dex, in an attempt to get my double attack<br/>
and dual wield to go off more (that&#39;s not so useless in my eyes). As for<br/>
dropping AGI, that gives you AC (at least it effects the number on the<br/>
screen, which isn&#39;t totally indicative of what&#39;s going on). As near as I can<br/>
tell, having a High AGI helps you when taking a hit, by lessening the amount<br/>
of damage you take. I get hit a lot less hard then some of the other party<br/>
members with a lower AGI. (Gotta love the Ranger who casts FLAC.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I know I am going to go in all AC gear from now on, concentrating on str as<br/>
 </span></blockquote>secondary.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sold on the STR gear. The ATK number is a hybrid like AC. Adding<br/>
another 5 points of str doesn&#39;t seem to help all that much compared to<br/>
another 5 pts of dex. Again, it seems that having another +5 str only gives<br/>
another five points of damage. I&#39;d rather spend the inventory spot on a dex<br/>
item that gives me another attack chance at a 30+ punch. Still, there is<br/>
much guess work here.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Just be prepared for a change in tactics and gear once the patch goes live.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Indeed! Its a good day for monks, and I&#39;m prepared to be healed a lot more.<br/>
I&#39;ve been playing with the same group of people of the past month or so, and<br/>
its been very interesting. I very rarely can get a monster&#39;s attention off<br/>
the Ranger with his dual SSOYs, but occasionally it does happen (good old<br/>
Flying Kick). I&#39;m already embarrassing the paladin (3 levels higher) on<br/>
damage to the point where she can rarely pull the mob off me (not counting<br/>
undead). I&#39;m very curious to see how this works out versus the ranger, post<br/>
patch. I&#39;m prepared to get some love from my clerics. ;)<br/>
