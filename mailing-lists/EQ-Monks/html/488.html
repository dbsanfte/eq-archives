<div id="ygrps-yiv-554913834"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; 1.    Does dual weild has level cap? It seems that my dual wield is more<br/>
&gt; than 25  when I&#39;m just only level 4.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, but it&#39;s a special exception.  It is (level + 1) * 7, instead of (level<br/>
+ 1) * 5, like other combat skills.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 2.    How does safe fall work? Is it automatic?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes it&#39;s automatic.  And to train it, you just need to find a spot that<br/>
you&#39;ll take damage from falling.  Even if it&#39;s just 2 points.. you&#39;ll still<br/>
be able to train the skill.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 3.    What is the best glove I can get now to hit magical?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>At level 5.. with the money at your disposal (assuming non-twink. :)), I&#39;d<br/>
say netted gloves, perhaps woven if you really save your money.</div>
