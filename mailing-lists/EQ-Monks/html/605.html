I think the thing that bothers me the most about EQ is the money situation.<br/>
The greed factor has almost turned it into a UO-type situation.  I realize<br/>
this is a total tangent, but how many of you have actually had to turn OFF<br/>
the auction channel on a non-bazaar day?  I hate it.  I hate greed.  I&#39;m<br/>
level 20 and I have 15 pp to my name.  But that&#39;s just me and I could be<br/>
stupid :)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I play on The Tribunal, and I don&#39;t think we have this problem, there just<br/>
aren&#39;t that many items for sale. I am level 15 and have over 180plat in the<br/>
bank.<br/>
<br/>
I would have more, but when I went (solo-)wisp hunting, I would give LS<br/>
away, and sell GLS for 4pp which was around 2pp less than anyone else does.<br/>
I recently sold my spare woven (tunic, cape, leggings, bracer) to a fellow<br/>
monk who was wearing full leather and had a weight of 34 for 7pp (which is<br/>
what I had paid for some of it earlier in my career). Money just isn&#39;t a<br/>
requirement for me.<br/>
<br/>
I am looking for something to spend money on and cannot find anything -- I<br/>
would like some of the top-end jewellery, but I have not seen any jewellers<br/>
of high enough skill offering anything.<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone suggest what I should be aiming for? I am wearing mostly woven<br/>
(except for shoulders, feet (obviously), waist and head). I am still wearing<br/>
2 Cutthroat Rings - I tried the +2Agi rings, but the Derv rings seemed to<br/>
work better for me - the 2AC and 4Dex appear to be better than 4Agi.<br/>
<br/>
Would love to hear suggestions from anyone!<br/>
