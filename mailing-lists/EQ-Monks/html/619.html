<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2006536958">I&#39;m going to try and break this apart, not easy given the nature of the of the<br/>
paragraph.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&quot;Ok - we&#39;re going to label the first paragraph there &quot;A&quot; and the second &quot;B&quot;. In<br/>
 </span></blockquote>paragraph &quot;A&quot; you state that you need those items to do what you want to do in<br/>
the game, but in &quot;B&quot; tell me that if I need the items I should delete. Huh?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
No, I said (maybe you should read it again), that I need those item due to the<br/>
nature of the game system. For example, I would prefer my monk wear no armor at<br/>
all, but that&#39;s not a viable option in EQ the system. Okay, fine, that&#39;s the way<br/>
it works, I wear some mesh armor, some earned, some bought, some given. I would<br/>
prefer to have no armor or magic items at all, only practicing my skills to make<br/>
my punches and strikes more deadly, but I can&#39;t do that either.Its not exactly<br/>
the kinda gameplay I want, but it doesn&#39;t detract (much) from my enjoyment of<br/>
the game. Which, for the umpteenth time is not based around which equipment I<br/>
posses.<br/>
<br/>
Paragraph B was meant to illustrate that you yourself were asking to be twinked.<br/>
If so, why are you objecting to what I&#39;m doing?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&quot;Yes, to keep up with my group, unfortunately I have to go get better armor and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>jewelry.  Since I didn&#39;t have someone give me Serp Bracers or Platinum Jewelry,<br/>
I guess I&#39;m going to have to either make the money honestly or camp the spawn. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
So which is  it dude? You pick. You don&#39;t Twink because you don&#39;t like the<br/>
impurity, or you don&#39;t twink because you can&#39;t? You can&#39;t have it both ways if<br/>
you&#39;re objecting to my chosen style of gameplay.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&quot;And my group is in the same boat.  If my Paladin friend needs something, then<br/>
 </span></blockquote>we go get it for him.  If the Cleric.... ditto.  That&#39;s a little bit of<br/>
adventuring.  I&#39;m glad you have a sugar daddy giving you the equipment.  One<br/>
less person waiting around for it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sugar Daddy eh? You sound jealous, want his email address?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&quot;And you&#39;re not fooling anyone with that loot cycle stuff - I think almost<br/>
 </span></blockquote>every monk out there is selective about looting. So sorry, no prize for you<br/>
today.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sigh, THATS WHY I PICKED THE MONK IN THE FIRST PLACE. So don&#39;t need to worry<br/>
about that kind of crap (or as little as possible). I&#39;m not looking for your<br/>
praise, nor your approval, but I&#39;m tired of listening to people whining about<br/>
twinked characters. &quot;Waaa he has serp bracers and I don&#39;t... waaa&quot;. Gimme a<br/>
break, go get your own. Don&#39;t complain about the way I play, as I already accept<br/>
yours. Hearing someone say I&#39;ve been playing unfairly because I&#39;ve got better<br/>
stuff then I &#39;should&#39; have for my level is INSULTING. I&#39;m playing the game the<br/>
way I want to play it, within the parameters provided by Verant. I will continue<br/>
to do so until Verant changes those rules, or I no longer enjoy my time on<br/>
EverQuest. i will also continue to defend the way I play as long as I see fit.<br/>
