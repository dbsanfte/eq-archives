<div id="ygrps-yiv-219670935">Hail all you experienced monks out there.  <br/>
<br/>
What recommendations does everyone have for places to hunt solo by levels?<br/>
<br/>
My character is only level 21, but here were his favorites so far&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Level	Area Hunted<br/>
1-4	Freeport<br/>
5-10	Rivervale (with runnyeye bead quest)<br/>
11-12	Black Burrow (with gnoll teeth quest)<br/>
13-16	Wisp island (gls quest, good money and exp!)<br/>
17-18	EK (gnoll reavers)<br/>
19-20	HH (gnolls solo and orcs in a group)<br/>
21-22?  Gorge hunting mino&#39;s<br/>
22+?	Not there yet............1 bubble to go!<br/>
<br/>
The quests seem to really speed up the leveling.  Has anyone else found that<br/>
to be true also?  Are they any good quests out there for experience once in<br/>
the twenties and beyond?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
