 </span></blockquote>Actually Druids with wolf form make better pullers <br/>
than rangers in those zones.  But let&#39;s be honest, <br/>
there&#39;s nothing particularly difficult about those <br/>
zones and pulling there. (Except MM which is a <br/>
rather poorly designed zone IMO.)  And a monk is <br/>
dang near as good with FD pulling as the druid/ranger<br/>
there.  So we have what 3ish dungeons where a monk <br/>
isn&#39;t the best puller, by a very small amount?  <br/>
And let see: Perma, sol a, sol b, upper guk, lower <br/>
guk where druid/ranger can&#39;t pull for squat?<br/>
<br/>
Yes monk&#39;s are the best pullers bar none.  Ask any <br/>
group of 35+s whether they want a monk pulling in <br/>
sol b or lower guk or anyone else? :)<br/>
