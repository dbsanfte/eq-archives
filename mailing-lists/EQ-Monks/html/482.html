&gt; I for one like the current damage we do. I don&#39;t think we should be<br/>
&gt; out-damaging a warrior swinging a big 2h weapon or dual wielding, and I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t want to. They have the ac and the hp to protect them from those 50+<br/>
&gt; damage blows that would chew us up in very little time.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wrong, at higher levels, (40-50) monks have the same AC, and the extra<br/>
dodge,block skill things.  Don&#39;t you remember that silly weight restriction<br/>
thing?  it gets more and more effective each level, and slowly your AC<br/>
creeps behind that of a warrior.   Monks are a very nimble tank, and they<br/>
pack a hell of a punch (excuse the pun).  We definately outdamage any silly<br/>
warrior whom decides to use a 2h, but the dual wielders that get heavy procs<br/>
and awesome delay.. well they own us..<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The rest of your article basically reinstates yoru beliefs.. Monks very much<br/>
so are tanks, more so then rogues, rangers, bards.  Monks were made at first<br/>
to be the &quot;ultimate melee machien&quot; it&#39;s in our description!  But with the<br/>
Thulian Claws (at mid lvls) and those hard weps to get like Painbringer and<br/>
such, a monks  built in ability to hit fast and hard is thwarted.. since a<br/>
warrior will outhit you (round wise) and in the long run out dmg you.<br/>
<br/>
Monks in no stretch of the imagination shoudl get mor HP, but we should get<br/>
a taunt since all other so called tanks, and real tanks get them.  Or<br/>
atleast let us use mend on our buddies... i hate seeing people die, when we<br/>
have so much at our disposal to save ourselves (mend, FD)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
wow a rant, sorry; i am a little mad and wound up today : )<br/>
