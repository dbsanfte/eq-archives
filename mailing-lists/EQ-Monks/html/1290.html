 &gt;Please tell me what armor better than cured even a level 18 can go get?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>13th now :)<br/>
I have seen people selling Lockjaw Vests around Freeport, and was thinking <br/>
of saving for one. They are about 30pp.. and I&#39;ve about 11 saved so far..<br/>
<br/>
Admittedly it&#39;s a lot at my level, but if I saved up 50pp for some Wu&#39;s <br/>
then by the time I hit 18, I should have bought a bit more stuff (although <br/>
I am currently spending most of my income on training up my brewing skill)<br/>
<br/>
Finally got my orange sash too.<br/>
