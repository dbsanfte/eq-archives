It is my understanding that the patch will do the following:<br/>
<br/>
THere are two monk upgrades coming, one sooner than the other:<br/>
1)Haste patch<br/>
It will imbue level 20 - 50 monks with a haste effect that reduces the<br/>
damage on<br/>
their fists. The magnitude of this effect increases with level (at level 50<br/>
it<br/>
will be a 15% delay reduction). The haste effect STACKS with item and PC<br/>
buffing<br/>
speed effects.  In essence a level 50 monk with a haste sash will be dual<br/>
wielding 15dmge 25 delay puppies (in the form of his fists).  Monk fists<br/>
currently are about 15dmge 36 delay weapons - at level 50.<br/>
<br/>
2) One handed blunt patch: call it Nunchuck patch:<br/>
Abashi has also been quoted on the message board as saying that in the<br/>
future<br/>
(afew months down the line) monk only 1handed blunt weapons will be<br/>
implemented<br/>
: they should proc and offer us more diversity.  No word on whether the<br/>
haste<br/>
effect on our fists will carry over to one-handed blunt.  I doubt it will<br/>
however.  I suspect that the 1handed blunt weapons will be implemented to<br/>
give<br/>
us more variety.  You know switch to &quot;nunchucks of stunning&quot; for extra<br/>
interrupts when fighting casters, or &quot;nunchucks of slowing&quot; for proc&#39;ing<br/>
snare<br/>
when in a dungeon.  Who knows there may introduce a godly nunchuck of<br/>
ASSWHOOPing that is a 10 dmage 12 delay type thingy... (of course it will<br/>
only<br/>
found in the plains)<br/>
