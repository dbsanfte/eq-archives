<div id="ygrps-yiv-1271871282">I am sorry anyone took my last two posts as a flame or insulting. Neither <br/>
was meant in such an context.  If the whole graphics change was in reference <br/>
to new armors etc. My bad. I was only refering to having visible headbands <br/>
and sashes, which is what I thought the general theme of the discussion was. <br/>
I had agreed with the post in the sense that large scale changes werent <br/>
possible. Though maybe I was uncclear. While I dont like that we dont have <br/>
any armor changes I can see why this was implemented, monks on a whole arent <br/>
the most fashionable people nor do they change clothes twice a day. They are <br/>
simple people and as as such we are given simple clothes!<br/>
I think some people on this board have had some great ideas for gloves and <br/>
monk modifiers, something the class sorely needs. But how do we go about <br/>
trying to get notice to these ideas? Was there a movement amongst the <br/>
rangers to get crits or was that a developer idea? Is there a place to find <br/>
what changes are being tried on the test server? Are the monks being tweaked <br/>
on the test server at all?<br/>
<br/>
P.S. IMHO other classes wont complain if we get our sash/headband <br/>
animiations, everyone I have talked to also thinks its a severe oversight! <br/>
Now if we got taunt, backflip, critical, nunchucks, and magic gloves other <br/>
classes might complain, a little ;)</div>
