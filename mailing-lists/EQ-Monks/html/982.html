&gt;I think what got everyone so worked up was the FD split-pull defined the<br/>
&gt;monk&#39;s role in the group. Now that role has changed, and its led to<br/>
&gt;confusion and no small amount of bitterness. Given the over-crowding issue<br/>
&gt;in most dungeons though, (75 in lower guk? _shudder_) the split-pull was<br/>
&gt;becoming less important as &quot;just finding&quot; something to attack.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t realise that my little story was going to have people at each<br/>
other&#39;s throats.  I was posting something that I hoped would re-instill<br/>
pride in our class, instead of everyone sitting around wringing their hand,<br/>
how can we as the player&#39;s redefine our place in the s about how useless we<br/>
are as a class.  There are many intelligent people on this list, most of<br/>
you are probably smarter than I am.  Many of you have been playing the game<br/>
and this class longer than I have.  I suppose the situation is much akin to<br/>
the role of children and parents.  Since one of the roles of children in<br/>
society is to question the way things are, I  would like to propose a<br/>
sersious intellectual discussion of the situation.  Lets use the following<br/>
question as that basis:<br/>
<br/>
Given Verant&#39;s change in the Feign Death skill, what can we as players do<br/>
to change our role or our preceived role in the game, based on game mechanics?<br/>
<br/>
The rules:<br/>
1.  Everyones opinion matters<br/>
2.  No flaming or personal attacks<br/>
3.  Quitting the game, playing Asheron&#39;s call, or starting new characters<br/>
are not viable answers.<br/>
<br/>
Lets the fun begin.<br/>
