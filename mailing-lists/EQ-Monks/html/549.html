Are they not a gang of female rogues born of a drunkard in Kelethin? Do they<br/>
not share an allegiance with those base bandits known as Dervish Cutthroats?<br/>
Among their number is seen many a human.  Be they human or some other<br/>
civilized<br/>
race, I would believe them undeserving of assault; but do guard yourself from<br/>
harm if accosted. When first I approached these war ready females, I had<br/>
assumed they were human. Alas, I could be mistaken. Good journey.<br/>

&gt;&gt;The Nybright sisters will serve as no obstacle to one of your training. Even<br/>
&gt;&gt;through fourteen orders of training, I have considered them less than<br/>
&gt;equal to<br/>
&gt;&gt;the task of one on one combat. Your abilities are best served in the undead<br/>
&gt;&gt;depths of Unrest or the outlying Cauldron. It would be my hope that no monk<br/>
&gt;&gt;among us would go so far as to take the life of a fellow human in order to<br/>
&gt;&gt;gain<br/>
