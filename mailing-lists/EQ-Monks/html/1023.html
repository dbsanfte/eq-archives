Hiya, Kaladiel!<br/>
<br/>
There seems to be a misconception about mistmoore werewolves.  To my <br/>
understanding, they do NOT drop the claw for the Karg quest.  They drop the <br/>
Talon for the crafted breastplate quest.   I believe you can only get a claw<br/>
<br/>
from werewolves in outdoor areas.   Someone please, please correct me if I <br/>
am wrong, but I believe this to be true.<br/>
<br/>
Fare well<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hi all, I have decided that it is time for me to complete something I have<br/>
&gt;set out to do for quite some time. And that is to get a freaking Werewolf<br/>
&gt;claw. Now being one that does not like to run around in the stupid West<br/>
&gt;Commonlands, or West Karana asking repetitively anyone have a werewolf on<br/>
&gt;tracking let me know! I got so bored and tired so I have decided to go to<br/>
&gt;Mistmoore and try to get to the dance floor. Now I have been to MM quite a<br/>
&gt;few times but I have never been inside the castle barely even down the ramp<br/>
&gt;towards the castle. mainly the Grave Yard and the zone line. Now I would<br/>
&gt;like some help on any suggestions or tips as to what to go or how to go<br/>
&gt;about getting to the Dance Room with the Gypsies/Werewolves....i.e. party<br/>
&gt;make up and level or a site where there might be a map. Thanks for your<br/>
&gt;help.<br/>
