<div id="ygrps-yiv-1984507113">Oh yea, I forgot the stop attacking thingy too.  Hehe.  As far as instill <br/>
doubt goes, its the hardest skill I have ever had to raise.  I hit the <br/>
instill doubt button constantly, targeting anything I can, and I think mine <br/>
is like 35th.  And the key to getting it to work is make sure the ONLY thing <br/>
you are doing to your target is auto attack, no special attacks, and your <br/>
special attacks button has to be up (Tiger Claw, etc) and then hit your <br/>
instill doubt.  Now, chances are the next result you will see is it telling <br/>
you &quot;You aren&#39;t scaring anyone&quot;.  Hehe if you are REALLY lucky and get it to <br/>
work (I think I have gotten it to work like 3 or 4 times), it should have <br/>
the same effect as the 4th level necro spell, and make them start to run <br/>
away for 10-30 seconds.  Only you don&#39;t get the nifty flying skulls.<br/>

&gt;Make sure to stop attacking for a sec before you fd.  Then it should work a<br/>
&gt;lot more than it fails at lvl 70 skill.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sneak is fantastic when you are the scout and mapping out a new dungeon.<br/>
&gt;When other characters would get wiped out, you can sneak past guards.  <br/>
&gt;Hehe,<br/>
&gt;when that fails, you just fd.  Works out great.  (You haven&#39;t had fun till<br/>
&gt;you scout out a dungeon full of red mob&#39;s with another monk.  You and the<br/>
&gt;other monk can sneak around, fd when needed, then find lower level mobs to<br/>
&gt;wipe out before the red ones find you.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Someone else will have to answer about instill doubt.  I haven&#39;t had good<br/>
&gt;luck with it either.<br/>

&gt;		I got feign death last level and have had no luck with it at<br/>
&gt;all.<br/>
&gt;		I&#39;ve been faithfully practicing (my death screams are still<br/>
&gt;ringing<br/>
&gt;		in my ears) and my skill is up to around 70, but it&#39;s only<br/>
&gt;worked one<br/>
&gt;		time.  Will this ever be useful?  Also what good is sneak<br/>
&gt;and instill<br/>
&gt;		doubt?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;		Thanks,<br/>
