&gt; I experimented at found they only came back if they could see me.  After<br/>
&gt; consulting<br/>
&gt; with a GM, I pretty much confirmed that it is a line of sight nerf.  Feign<br/>
&gt; pulling a mob<br/>
&gt; around the corner should be possible, though I have not specifically tried<br/>
it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am suprised it hasn&#39;t started already. I just wanted to share with you<br/>
my Post<br/>
&gt; nerf FD experimentaion.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sol A green Flame goblins. the goblins I was experimenting with were on<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; floor near the passage to where the Foreman spawns.  I succesfully feigned<br/>
them<br/>
&gt; at this point. they returned to thier spawn points . I stood up they<br/>
immediatly<br/>
&gt; came back.  so I feign again they return to thier points I get up and run<br/>
all<br/>
&gt; the way to the small bridge type thing near the sol b spawn point. I fd<br/>
again.<br/>
&gt; I was several mins stand up wait a few and here they come a running at me.<br/>
I fd<br/>
&gt; again let them walk away. get up and they come back.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A fellow monk on my server experimented in Lguk with some Dar Undead frogs<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; had similar results even after 5 mins of feign time.<br/>
