&gt; Oh how wrong you are.  You don&#39;t know me..you don&#39;t know my life you<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t know jack as far as I am concerned.  You are probably some stupid<br/>
&gt; college student who thinks that everyone has a life outside of the<br/>
&gt; game.  Some of us choose not to and you know what??? I am happy that<br/>
&gt; way.  I don&#39;t want to engage in the activities I did before EQ and you<br/>
&gt; know what else? its not your place to tell me or anyone else what they<br/>
&gt; should think or feel about EQ or to pass judgement on anyone for<br/>
&gt; thinking the way they do about EQ.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m just giving advice.  You can ask Mr. McQuaid, he&#39;ll be glad to<br/>
inform you that EQ is a game.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been called everything from a stupid college student with a life<br/>
to a cool dude teenager with no life.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if your attempt at guessing who/what I am was a joke or<br/>
some pathetic way to make you feel better or make me feel worse.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, quoth the Joker:<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re dead.&quot;</div>
