<div id="ygrps-yiv-854897374">Here you go, the ultimate party, around lvl 40+<br/>
<br/>
1- Monk<br/>
2- Monk<br/>
3- Monk<br/>
4- Enchanter<br/>
5- Druid<br/>
6- Cleric<br/>
<br/>
With fbss and the enchanter&#39;s celerity (39) or swift like wind (49) the monks <br/>
can dish an AMAZING amount of dmg.  Enchanter can slow down mobs, and give <br/>
all 3 caster types mana faster.  Cleric heals and buffs.  Druids have some <br/>
nice DD and DOTS, snare and back up heal.  If you can think of a better group <br/>
plz tell me cause I don&#39;t think there is.  No resisting and don&#39;t need a <br/>
taunt as the casters more than likely aren&#39;t gonna get jumped.  Not to <br/>
mention, if one of the monks is getting beaten too badly, FD and mob will <br/>
jump to another of them.  If you have ever seen this kind of group in action, <br/>
I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll agree with me.<br/>
