<div id="ygrps-yiv-1248912474">A friend of mine actually paid for the password, against my advise. There<br/>
is nothing there that can&#39;t be found on any other EQ sites. There is less<br/>
information than most EQ sites have, and 80% of it is out of date<br/>
from patches. There are no &quot;secrets&quot; there. Just go to allahkazam&#39;s site. <br/>
<br/>
This is just an advertizing scam, he posts to all the newgroups now and<br/>
then. <br/>

&gt; Can someone here hack his website and post the password up?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I bet his secrets are pants anyway (and against the AUP)<br/>
