<div id="ygrps-yiv-1032094713">As for being tanks... the only thing holding us back from being better tanks <br/>
than warriors is our hit points.  At lvl 50, I have around 600 to 700 less <br/>
hps than a warrior.  BUT AC is not that different.  Compared to a warrior in <br/>
almost full lustrous russet with AC of 829, I, having only 2 pieces of <br/>
shiverback (gloves and leggings), have an AC of 810.  Plus, as a monk, we <br/>
block, dodge and riposte quite a bit more on average than a warrior.  Okay, I <br/>
think I&#39;m done now.<br/>
