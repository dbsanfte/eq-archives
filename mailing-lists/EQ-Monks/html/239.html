<br/>
I need help.  I have lately lost interest in my monk and in the game in general.  I hit lvl 16 about a month ago and have been stuck there ever since.  About that time, I started playing less due to RL commitments.  Even now, I can only play 2-3 hours at a time max.  I have been hanging out around Freeport:  Commons, NRo, Oasis area.  I even tried going to Faydward (sp?) and spending time there.  I just can&#39;t get into it.  I think my biggest problem is it is SOOO hard to find a good group.  I was grouped in the Oasis last week and had a cleric who refused to heal during a battle, all he wanted to do was beat on the MOBs.  This led to me dying 3 times in short succession.  Also, what is more frustrating that running to the derv camp in W Comm and trying to get into a group when there are already 2 groups camping the place and they refuse to even acknowledge you by replying to a simple /tell?  The only time I get an indication that they know I exist is when one of their wizards keeps stealing MOBs from me.<br/>
<br/>
I need some advice/encouragement on what to do for a couple of levels!  I have tried starting a  necromancer, revisited a lvl 6 warrior, and started a cleric in this time also.  Problem is, this game does not get interesting until lvl 8-10 or so (usually a caster&#39;s 3 set of spells).  If you&#39;ve played one newbie class, you&#39;ve played them all - and you have to invest SOOO much time to just get to a level where each class starts getting interesting.<br/>

I really do like my monk and I realize that it starts getting better after FD, but I am just in this funk and need some help getting out....</div>
