<div id="ygrps-yiv-256224428">Great post by John Halman, just to add abit...<br/>
<br/>
keep in mind monks can ake alot of money very easily, in may ways, I found that with my monk, I could camp mobs and loot, which few other classes could do alone, Feign Death, Mend and BW are the keys.  Monks can easily split up a full camp and fight a mob one on one, instead of the full camp at once, you can invade areas fully spawned, and live.<br/>
Although here may be some spawns abit too tough for you to handle, there are ways you can still work them safely.  As a monk, I soloed Permafrost quite easily fairly early, Kings chamber andall other named spawns in zone were easy to work, if you take your time.  The first time I soloed King chamber I was 38.  King in perma drops White Wolf Hide Cloak, which I was afte for myself, and a few other decent drops in zone, along with a WR pack from archeologist.  this is one example of an area, where most others that come to camp, are much higher lvl. Due to the difficulty with adds.  Like thsi, there are many other zones, which a monk can control or break up for great cash loots and player loots.<br/>
In my earlier days I had a hunting partner, another monk, we hunted areas where full groups typically camped with little problem, we knew each others playing styles,a nd tendencies very well, and there is little that canot be worked by a pair of good monks.  Had a blast hunting the King area in Runnyeye together, much earlier than we should have been, and we each walke out with full suits of blackened armor among other loots, with merchants and banker in zame zone, you can&#39;t go wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Look for out of the way or rarely hunted areas, that you can break, and solo. Or find a partner you can hunt with.  The plat is out there for the taking.<br/>
