<div id="ygrps-yiv-818141472">proc is not a word that I believe is short for anything.  Procing is the term<br/>
that I first encountered from verant&#39;s game designers to refer to the &quot;act of a<br/>
weapon casting a spell on its target/wielder&quot;.  The entomology of this word is<br/>
probably a suitable question for submission to &quot;ASK milo&quot;.  Word of advice:<br/>
spell his name right and loose any attitude you might have - he will rip you to<br/>
shreds otherwise (eheeheh).</div>
