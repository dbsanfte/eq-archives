<div id="ygrps-yiv-135940373">I have a question for all the higher level monks out there. I am of the 26th<br/>
season and I was wondering, when you solo the aviak guards in Lake Rathe if<br/>
you need to feign death you can, then you can stand right back up and<br/>
bandage and continue on with the fight, my question is can you do the same<br/>
to aviaks in the aviak village, I was wondering because if you can that<br/>
means I can solo harriers instead of just rooks. Thank you for your time. Oh<br/>
by the way I bought my BP Choker last night, and now I am broke, but I am a<br/>
satisfied broke hehehe, and I also traded for a Shralok Pack for my opal<br/>
electrum necklace too.<br/>
