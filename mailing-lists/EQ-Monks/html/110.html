<div id="ygrps-yiv-2008858137">I am a level 7 monk and i have 20 points to spend. Would you recommend i spend them on offensive skills now, save them for later, use them on a skill to make money, or use them on throwing. If on throwing is it a really good skill to get, does it do any damage or is it just to attract animals as ive heard. Thanks for your time.<br/>
