<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-232686458">Ok, from what I have heard, this is a great item for a monk.  It has<br/>
3AC, gives +3 AGI, and only weighs 0.1..I also know that it is received<br/>
from a named snake in Dagnor&#39;s Cauldron.  I need more information about<br/>
it..What is the name of the snake?  Where does he spawn in Dagnor&#39;s?<br/>
How tough is he?  How much do these go for if I bought one.  Any<br/>
information would be appreciated.<br/>
