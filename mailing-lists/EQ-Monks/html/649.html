&lt;&lt; Hehe, full bronze isn&#39;t serious twinking.  That&#39;s someone who wanted to <br/>
try <br/>
 a tank, but didn&#39;t want to go through the pain of buying/wearing pw/leather. <br/>
   Serious twinking is the guy I saw the other day in full steel plate (yes, <br/>
 every single piece of it) who con&#39;d green to my 22 Ranger. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 My own favorite example was a lvl 6, with full steel plate, an exec axe, a <br/>
black silk sash, and journeyman boots! LOL</div>
