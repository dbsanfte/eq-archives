<div id="ygrps-yiv-1169234202">You might try fighting mobs that drop low weight items.  For example, the<br/>
stone and iron guards in the North West corner of Nektulos forest drop gems,<br/>
rings, words, runes, and pages.  All of these are light weight, and most<br/>
stack.  I realize this area is a bit high for lvl 16, but the idea is still<br/>
sound.  The common tactic is to loot everything, but those rusty weapons<br/>
just weight too much for all but the strongest races.<br/>
<br/>
You could also try grouping with a high strength race to hold all the heavy<br/>
stuff, then split the proceeds.  Of course, you have to find a trustworthy<br/>
PC to group with.<br/>

I have always thought that monks should be characters of moderation and<br/>
poverty.  I have tried to play my character that way.  I have managed to<br/>
squrriel away 250 pp.  I figured that would handle most of my expenses for<br/>
the foreseeable future.  I buy muffins and water for food and drink.  All<br/>
of my magic tiems have been given to me or looted off of drops.  However, I<br/>
have reached an impasse.  Someone last night was auctioning off Serpent<br/>
bracers.  When I asked how much, I was shocked to hear 800 pp.  I guess<br/>
that I am going to have to break down and loot everything or hope that I<br/>
stumble across a raqre drop.  I am not going to be able to afford anything<br/>
better if I don&#39;t do so.  I think it is sad, that if I am going to be a<br/>
successful adventurer, I am going to have to be like the rest of the money<br/>
grubbing classes:  Rogues, Shadow Knights,  Warriors, Druids, Shamans,<br/>
Rangers, Bards,  Enchanters, Wizards, Magicians, Necromancers,  holy<br/>
Clerics and pious Paladins.  Does anyone else see a problem with this?<br/>
