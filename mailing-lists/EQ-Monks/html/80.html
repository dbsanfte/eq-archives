<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1163070264">What is happening is that the AC of your patchwork outweights the<br/>
penalty for the weight.  I went through the same thing at low levels.<br/>
When I switched leather for mesh armor, which has the same ac but very<br/>
low weight, my AC went up over 40 points.  You could try swapping cloth<br/>
for patchwork.  If you swap any given piece and your AC stays the same<br/>
or goes up, keep the cloth.  Then go get mesh as soon as you can.  It<br/>
might be hard on the PvP server, though, cause it&#39;s found in Guk, right<br/>
in the middle of Troll territory.<br/>

&gt; I am not sure where anyone got the 15 weight is the best for<br/>
&gt; monks...can<br/>
&gt; someone please explain this...My AC does not change when i drop down<br/>
&gt; to or<br/>
&gt; below 15, if anything it gets worse as I take my patchwork armor off.<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t believe this nonsense about the super low weight unless you are<br/>
&gt; talking about encumbering weight. I know monks are suppose to use less<br/>
&gt; than<br/>
&gt; others but I can&#39;t go on a huge hunting spree and not carry something<br/>
&gt; back<br/>
&gt; to sell. Or should I be investing in items instead? Its a little hard<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; invest in items on the PVP server since everyone is out to get you<br/>
&gt; hehe.<br/>
&gt; Suggestions for eq would be most appriciated...where to buy cost?<br/>
&gt; Thanks<br/>
