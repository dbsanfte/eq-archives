Your mind and your speed are your armor.  Do not allow the frivolties of other<br/>
classes of adventures to cloud your mind and burden your body. Keep that one<br/>
item that affords you the greatest defense; a strong leather tunic will guard<br/>
your vital organs well.  You will soon find a way to exchange it for a<br/>
sturdier<br/>
yet lighter mesh garment. Your bracers of mesh also provide you with strong<br/>
defense and add little to encumber your flow, so it may be to your<br/>
advantage to<br/>
retain those on your person.  Soon, you may find it in your interest to locate<br/>
a jewler capable of crafting enchanted pieces to accelerate your innate<br/>
abilities; smaller such items can be had for only a few of your platinum<br/>
pieces, and may be well worth the expense.  Do keep an eye out for traveling<br/>
merchants, and be not afraid to ask them how their jewels might help you.<br/>
<br/>
May Quellious guide you,<br/>

Monk of the 10th Order, Disciple of Quellious, the Tranquil<br/>
