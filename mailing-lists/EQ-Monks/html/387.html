&lt;&lt;  I just got too bored.  I already had full<br/>
 mesh with a Lockjaw Tunic. I was pretty much set until I could get into Fear<br/>
 and get shiverback (silverback?) armor &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 You can get a lot better stuff than full mesh + an LJ tunic prior to getting <br/>
shiverback stuff... I think the only piece of mesh i have left is the mantle, <br/>
and I have no shiverback stuff yet.<br/>
