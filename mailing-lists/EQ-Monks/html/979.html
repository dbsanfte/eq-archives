<div id="ygrps-yiv-1559748151">I am kinda confused on why you think using a skill on a below 35th level mob<br/>
is ok and why using it on an above 35th level mob is an exploit?  I also<br/>
undertsand that different people use different skill in different ways.<br/>
Verant nerfed druids kiting but in return made them more viable in the<br/>
group. it is all in how you use the skill while I see the need to fix an<br/>
exploit (Verant specifically mentioned dragons and FD they did not mention<br/>
monks specifically nor Planes that I have seen or heard) but to make a point<br/>
you are correct that monks need a good group and the only groups I get now<br/>
are guildmates and freinds because no one wants me anymore. At the higher<br/>
levels there are so few places to hunt for exp and they all are train heavy<br/>
places with lots of wanderers anbd thats just a risk neither I nor potential<br/>
trains victums want.<br/>

&gt; I know a lot of people are going to disagree with me, but Verant&#39;s change<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; the feign death is warranted. People WERE exploiting the FD especially<br/>
&gt; inside the planes. One way to fix that WITHOUT screwing a lot of lower<br/>
level<br/>
&gt; people was to make it where any creature under level 35, would think you<br/>
&gt; were dead and forget about you while creatures 35th and up would use the<br/>
&gt; different percentages setup by Verant. I think this fair. I have ONLY used<br/>
&gt; feign death in serious situations where there was a train on my butt and I<br/>
&gt; was definitely going to die because I couldn&#39;t make it to a zone. I feel<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s what it was intended to do and some people figured out a way to<br/>
&gt; exploit it in the planes with the big creatures. So thats that. I&#39;m fine<br/>
&gt; with it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As for other things, I have a 36th level monk on the Tribunal and I<br/>
WOULDN&#39;T<br/>
&gt; have made it this far without having a balanced group of guildmembers to<br/>
go<br/>
&gt; around with. Since monks dont get the huge amounts of HPs we really lose<br/>
out<br/>
&gt; to the other warrior classes. Saying that I can honestly say that the<br/>
monks<br/>
&gt; are the best class in the game. I know you&#39;re looking forward to that<br/>
flying<br/>
&gt; kick skill too and while i&#39;m at 180 skill I still miss about 60% of the<br/>
time<br/>
&gt; ,AGAINST LOW BLUES,even though I have a 131dex and 137agi. Even with these<br/>
&gt; problems I will continue to play my monk though, UGLY robe and all,<br/>
because<br/>
&gt; I have to admit I have had fun playing it. Seeing &quot;You kick a greater<br/>
kobold<br/>
&gt; for 88 points.&quot; is one hell of a rush. I also have one hell of  bank<br/>
&gt; account.<br/>
