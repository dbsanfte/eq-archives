<div id="ygrps-yiv-195417827">Here is some info for you,<br/>
<br/>
1.  A Serpentine Bracer for 800pp is one of the worst<br/>
deals you can get.  Even 2 for that much would be bad.<br/>
 The price has dropped recently so about 200-250 is a<br/>
decent range.  Many high levels give them away for<br/>
free.<br/>
<br/>
2.  Monk equipment shouldn&#39;t matter that much.  I will<br/>
admit that I have recieved some nice items from guild<br/>
members but what I would recomend you do is buy cured<br/>
silk armor.  Pretty decent price.<br/>
<br/>
3.  You don&#39;t need to loot everything but don&#39;t think<br/>
its the end of the world if you go over your limit. <br/>
Try to hunt near a place you can sell.<br/>
<br/>
4.  250pp is quite a bit, you must not buy much.  I<br/>
only have about 140pp TOTAL at level 20.  Of course I<br/>
support another character and have recently bought<br/>
some jewelry but still, don&#39;t consider yourself low on<br/>
cash. <br/>
