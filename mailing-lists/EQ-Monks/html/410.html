<div id="ygrps-yiv-1658598116">I took the advice of a fellow monk on this mailing list.  I was from<br/>
Freeport and at level 6 I went west to Qeynos (solo through HighHold without<br/>
Sow or Invis ;) hehe ) and found the frogloks in the Qeynos Aqueducts. The<br/>
frogloks are a little tough at level 6, but you can find someone else to<br/>
help you out.  I got most of what i wanted in the first night there, and<br/>
helped out a lower level monk and finished my collection of netted on the<br/>
2nd night.<br/>
<br/>
Right now I am level 12 and looking for players selling mesh in the freeport<br/>
area once again, but i havent found anyone yet. In a couple of levels maybe<br/>
I will head to Guk. Also, I picked up a LJ hide vest or whatever it was<br/>
called for 30pp.<br/>
