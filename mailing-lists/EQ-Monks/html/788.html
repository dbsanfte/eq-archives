<div id="ygrps-yiv-2105674275">They would have to pick and choose.  They could not go into Guk.  They<br/>
could however do all the outdoor/single spawns fairly easily.  Soloing,<br/>
if the Wizard casts 5 DD spells on average to kill a blue.  This means<br/>
5 successful full damages and 1 left to fizzle/resist.  <br/>
<br/>
The group would be fun at first, but quickly turn boring I imagine...<br/>
<br/>
I came close to this once killing dervishes.  We had<br/>
3 Wizards, 2 Magicians and 1 Enchanter.  Everyone would med, as soon<br/>
as someone began casting a spell, everyone would stand up and cast a<br/>
spell.  The dervs usually made it up to the original caster before they<br/>
died.<br/>

&gt; Ok, how about:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;1. Wizard 2. Wizard 3. Wizard 4. Wizard 5. Wizard 6. Wizard<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;I&#39;m 30th, and there is not much that lives through 6 of the big<br/>
&gt; wizard spells.  This group with die horribly to the wrong target,<br/>
&gt; but around 35th level this group would walk through giants (i think).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;If this group can coordinate, nothing moves, its standing at full, then its<br/>
&gt; dead.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Its an interesting question to be sure... if this kinda of group could walk<br/>
&gt; through the game, I would think the game needs an adjustment or two. I<br/>
&gt; suspect though, that this kind of group would have zero staying power. They<br/>
&gt; could kill one or two things, and they&#39;re out of business.<br/>
