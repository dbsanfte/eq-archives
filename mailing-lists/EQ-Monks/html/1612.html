<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1443110594">Well, I&#39;ve been fighting in Dalnir&#39;s for a while now (about two weeks, off<br/>
and on), and yesterday, I stumbeled upon THREE pieces of Crescent:  Gi, arms,<br/>
and slippers.<br/>
<br/>
The slipers are a no-brainer, since I had been wearing cured silk.  But, the<br/>
other two are a bit harder.<br/>
<br/>
I *was* wearing a Foreman&#39;s Tunic (10AC, +3 STR, +3 WIS), so I think the<br/>
+7 str of the Gi more than makes up for the 2 AC difference.  (The Gi is AC8)<br/>
<br/>
But, I&#39;m wearing Auzure sleves.  I don&#39;t think that the stats of the arms even<br/>
come close to the AC of the Azure.  Comments?<br/>
<br/>
So, for now, I carry around the arms to sell with (+2 CHA)<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t wait to get more of this stuff.  I&#39;m still wearing cured silk sholders<br/>
and cape.</div>
