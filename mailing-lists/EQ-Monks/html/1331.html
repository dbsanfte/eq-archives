<div id="ygrps-yiv-1670540250">I am usually at around 12 or 13 weight, depending on how much plat I choose<br/>
to carry on me.  Personally, I think that large bags are not the way to go.<br/>
If you are really careful, you should buy two spits (6 slots, weight 0.2).<br/>
I carry two spits and a sewing kit (8 slot, wt 0.4)...total bag weight is<br/>
0.8 which is still less than one large bag.  I generally never loot because<br/>
I am usually always grouped with members of my guild who do a master loot.<br/>
The only problem with spits and sewing kits is the evil combine buttion.  If<br/>
you can find enough will power to stay away from it there shouldn&#39;t be a<br/>
problem.  I have destroyed stuff in the past, but it is usually just<br/>
muffins, milk, bandages, or shurikens.<br/>

&gt; &gt; It is somewhat high; however, with it on, my total weight is still<br/>
&gt; &gt; under 9<br/>
&gt; &gt; stones and that includes food, drink, and several stacks of bandages.<br/>
&gt; &gt; It not<br/>
&gt; &gt; much of a burden and it is greater by 2 AC over cured silk. I am also<br/>
&gt; &gt; sometimes<br/>
&gt; &gt; guilty of duel weilding combine warhammers (7.3 WT). Typically I group<br/>
&gt; &gt; with a<br/>
&gt; &gt; warrior and a ranger along with casters, so I rarely take hits and can<br/>
&gt; &gt; afford<br/>
&gt; &gt; the over 20 weight. I hope to replace them soon with Black Enamelled<br/>
&gt; &gt; Maces<br/>
&gt; &gt; which will shed about six stones of weight. Nothing else on my person<br/>
&gt; &gt; weighs<br/>
&gt; &gt; much more than 0.1 with the exception of a Bracer of Erolissi (1.0 WT)<br/>
&gt; &gt; and a<br/>
&gt; &gt; Serpentine Bracer (0.8 WT). Rusty Spike Shoulderpads, incidentally,<br/>
&gt; &gt; are also<br/>
&gt; &gt; 2.5 WT and provide 3AC with +5 STR.<br/>

&gt; Under 9?  thats impressive... what backpacks/boxes do you use... if any?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I generally am at 14 or so... of course I carry an Sewn Evil Eye Pack<br/>
&gt; (3wt) and a few Large bags which are 1 wt each<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I know its very un-monk of me but I have never abided by the 14 stone<br/>
&gt; rule.  By this I mean that many monks will never loot past 14 stones but<br/>
&gt; I think thats stupid and you will never make money.  Sure your losing AC<br/>
&gt; and can potentially die faster but its a risk you take to actually make<br/>
&gt; some money in the game.  I am currently fighting in High Keep which<br/>
&gt; rules because its a short job upstairs to the bank =)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyone, personally I would never take 2ac for and additional 2.4 wt...<br/>
&gt; one thing that is important for monks is ac/wt ration, not ac in itself<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Cured Silk Shoulders: 3ac 0.1wt  30ac/wt<br/>
&gt; Lizardscale Mantle: 5ac 2.5wt 2ac/wt<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In that respect it is much more favorable to take the shoulders<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Its all a matter of preference though<br/>
