just made the run from Qeynos to Freeport and N. Ro isn&#39;t all that<br/>
terribly exciting. Also, I initially MADE the run as an interim step<br/>
to Innothule/Guk, strictly for netted stuff.  (And Woven.  And Mesh.<br/>
Both of which are in desperate short supply in Qeynos.)<br/>

Where do you guys all hunt? I&#39;m only 9&#39;th level so I may be somewhat<br/>
limited in my choices, but would love to hear what you all are<br/>
doing/have done.</div>
