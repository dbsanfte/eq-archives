<div id="ygrps-yiv-284378916">Heh what do you expect from a monk mailing list everyone to not like monks?<br/>
would my monk survive a fight against a lower level caster that could root<br/>
etc? No I have crappy magic resistence for one, and no spells either.  I<br/>
believe everyone in a group has their function, one part of that for a monk<br/>
is pulling. I for one enjoy the role I take in the groups I am in. Usually I<br/>
am asked to many groups becuase of my pulling skills. I do not always pull<br/>
but frequently I am called upon to do it and I accept that. If I do pull I<br/>
pull the monster, the taunters taunt it off me and we all beat the hell out<br/>
of it. At higher levels monks dish out some very serious damage especially<br/>
when there is a taunter to keep the mob off them. There is no perfect party<br/>
as each class brings with it charcateristics that make it better than<br/>
another in some respect. and everyone has their own opinion on which<br/>
characteristic is the most important. Oherwise we would all play the same<br/>
class, Now that would be boring, if we were all tank mages in full plate<br/>
casting ice comet. You say bards are very powerfull noone has disagreed with<br/>
that. admittedly you say most dont know how to play them. I would suspect<br/>
most here dont know how to play a bard. maybe I will look into starting one<br/>
as a twink :)<br/>

&gt; Bards are extremely powerful, if they know what they are doing. Most dont.<br/>
&gt; One of my characters is a 20th lvl bard. My friend plays a 20th lvl<br/>
&gt; paladin. We dueled in arena the other night and at the end of the fight I<br/>
&gt; was at full health. This was even after he used hands. He also blinded me<br/>
&gt; and ran off and hid someplace and healed himself back to full a second<br/>
&gt; time. It didn&#39;t save him. And yes, we stood toe to toe (except when he<br/>
&gt; ran hehe)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In any case, I find this whole thread of monks being master pullers<br/>
&gt; discouraging. Is this all they are good for at high levels? Is pulling the<br/>
&gt; only reason they are sought out for groups? Because that hardly sounds<br/>
&gt; like a fun way to spend time. I play a monk now because I dont have the<br/>
&gt; patients for long camps. Pulling things for other people to blast doesnt<br/>
&gt; sound much better :(  Surely there are other things to look forward to as<br/>
&gt; a high level monk?<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;Ever wonder why parties always want a monk to pull? Because the Monk IS<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;best puler in the game Bar none.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;          Once again, I am going to have to disagree. The Monk is the 2nd<br/>
&gt; &gt; best puller in the game. The best puller is one that no one has<br/>
mentioned<br/>
&gt; &gt; yet: The Bard. The reason the Bard is the best puller is because of<br/>
Kelin`s<br/>
&gt; &gt; Lugubrious Lament (Lull), Kelin`s Lucid Lullaby (AoE Lull), and Selo&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; Accelerando. Bards can use the spells to pull EXACTLY one Mob and then<br/>
&gt; &gt; hightail it back to the group. If they do pull more they can use Kelin&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; Lullaby to keep them occupied or just haul ass to zone. All in all, if<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; &gt; have a Bard that knows what he is doing, they are the best pullers.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;          However, that all said and done, most Bards are not as adept at<br/>
&gt; &gt; pulling as Monks are. Monks start honing their pulling skills early on.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Bards, for the most part, never really work on pulling. So, given the<br/>
same<br/>
&gt; &gt; skill level and knowledge, a Bard is a better class for pulling. I still<br/>
&gt; &gt; like a Monk because of the damage they deal. Bard songs are invaluable<br/>
at<br/>
&gt; &gt; higher levels though. I would choose a Bard (that knows what they are<br/>
&gt; &gt; doing) over a Shaman/Druid/Paladin/Ranger if possible.<br/>
