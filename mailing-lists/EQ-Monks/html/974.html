<div id="ygrps-yiv-1651663222">Over the last few weeks, I have seen the &quot;older&quot; and &quot;wiser&quot; monks on these<br/>
list moan about the changes in Feign Death.  Everyone has strong feelings<br/>
about the game and the changes that have been made.  People have stated<br/>
that the changes have made monks unplayable.  I really don&#39;t know, since I<br/>
have only been playing for a few weeks and have not made it to the level<br/>
necessary for feign death.  Last night, however, I reaffirmed my belief<br/>
that the Monk class is truly the best class in this game, regardless of<br/>
design changes.  I will elaborate.<br/>
<br/>
I had just leveled to 15th and had trained all available slots into Double<br/>
Attack.  I figured I would make a trip out to Black Burrow to hone my<br/>
skills before moving on to bigger game.  I know that at my level, that most<br/>
of the gnolls wouldn&#39;t give me any XP. I could pick up the teeth and gain<br/>
some small XP there.  I was playing solo.  There were several PCs around,<br/>
with a group of 13-15th level deciding to take on the gnoll commanders.<br/>
They were full up and I didn&#39;t go.  I stayed around the rest area, picking<br/>
off patrolling gnolls, and guards an the occasional brewer.  I had gone<br/>
back to the rest area for a breather.  Then, it happened:  Someone ticked<br/>
off the gnolls up in the commander area and trained them down onto us.  It<br/>
looked like an angry swarm coming out of a bee hive.  I was playing in full<br/>
window mode and the entire screen was filled with overlapping gnoll images.<br/>
 There was everything from Scrawny gnolls, up to the Commanders.  I could<br/>
not tell who my target was or how many there were.  Everyone in that room<br/>
was in for the fight of their digital lives.  At one point I know I was<br/>
fighting 2 guards, an elite guard and a commander.  That I could tell from<br/>
the descriptive text.  Spells were flying, weapons were slashing, and my<br/>
fist and feet were flying as fast as I could throw them.  Several<br/>
relatively low level casters fell first.  Then, the panic set in.  People<br/>
started running, but the train didn&#39;t follow them away.  It stayed there.<br/>
The PC panic was led by a pair of Troll warriors, who conned red to me.  I<br/>
saw them and others run.  I just kept fighting.  I managed to get a mend<br/>
off and a cleric or Druid healed me at one point in the fight.  When it was<br/>
all over, the only 2 PCs left in the room full of gnoll bodies, were myself<br/>
and another monk who was 16th level.  I still had 2 1/2 bubbles of health.<br/>
I picked up 8 gnoll teeth out of that fight and dumped more coin than I<br/>
wanted to carry.  With the exception of the heal, I had no magical buffs,<br/>
not even a SOW to help in case of retreat.  I wear cured silk armor, but<br/>
more than 2/3 of my AC is innate.  I don&#39;t have any fancy equipment,<br/>
although I do have the money to purchase some.  The next time some warrior<br/>
starts talking about how great they are, their armor is, their weapons,<br/>
etc.., just relate this little story.<br/>
