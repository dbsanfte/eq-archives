<div id="ygrps-yiv-1693966465">I do not play a monk so i dont know from experience, but what i was told by a higher lvl monk friend is that at the early lvls weight doesnt matter all that much but at higher lvls anything above 15 weight takes off 3AC per weight...perhaps a higher lvl monk on this list can confirm this.<br/>

    <br/>
    I have heard many people say that weight affects my ac, then I have also heard many that say that weight affects my chance of hitting. I was just starting to get rid of my leather armor for light patchwork or maybe just spend all my money on netted when I saw a monk wearing leather. When I asked him he said that weight doesn&#39;t matter at all for monks. Now, I usually have more weight than 14 and I find myself missing more then my other less bulbous monk counterparts. So, what&#39;s the truth does weight matter for us? <br/>
    <br/>
    I also was wondering, does ac and atk mean the damage we take and do, or the chance we have to get hit or hit. Thanks for your time all.<br/>
