&gt;can&#39;t believe this nonsense about the super low weight unless you are<br/>
&gt;talking about encumbering weight. I know monks are suppose to use less than<br/>
&gt;others but I can&#39;t go on a huge hunting spree and not carry something back<br/>
&gt;to sell.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>	Be patient... I felt this same way.  I sat and experimented with<br/>
everything from encumbered to buck flaming naked and never saw a<br/>
difference.  I began to wonder what the deal was with everybody being all<br/>
obsessed about a monk&#39;s weight when I couldn&#39;t tell the difference to save<br/>
my life.<br/>
	Well, I don&#39;t know the exact specifics of how it works, but your<br/>
level must be involved somehow.  All I can say is that now ever stone over<br/>
14 I accumulate causes me to lose an average of 3AC.  Once I saw this, my<br/>
eyes bugged out and I went on a diet to make your average supermodel<br/>
envious.  I now leave the bank with about 10 stones on me (including<br/>
backpack, rations, etc.) and love life.  I no longer even bother to keep<br/>
copper at all.. I just burn it as I get it.  (40 coins of any type = 1<br/>
stone, BTW.)  With silver, I frequently am reduced to exchanging it with<br/>
group members at a rate of about 115 silver for a plat.  This way they make<br/>
a profit and I get my weight back down.  It&#39;s a good deal all around.<br/>
	The bottom line is that it&#39;s possible your level isn&#39;t high enough<br/>
where you are experiencing the wieght effect (I&#39;m now at 21).  Keep your<br/>
eyes on it to see when it kicks in for you and let us know!<br/>
