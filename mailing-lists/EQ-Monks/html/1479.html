<div id="ygrps-yiv-1080224025">I finally got the Gorge goblin.. The secret seems to be sheer luck.<br/>
<br/>
I hunted home 60+ hours.. and finally got it when pulling stuff for other<br/>
people iin the zone..<br/>
<br/>
Only the three Goblins spawn there.. the two 6 minute spawns.. and the<br/>
placeholder or alchmist at about 75 minutes. Any of these goblins can be a<br/>
lookout to a veteran. I had it explained to me that the alchmist is a 10%<br/>
chance of showing on it turn. So it can show up seveal times in a row.. or<br/>
take a long time.<br/>
