<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Now that we have that understood....lets talk about twinking.  Everytime<br/>
&gt;you twink you take something away from someone who is at the right level<br/>
&gt;to have that item.  At 19 or 17 or 22 or whatever level he was...he took<br/>
&gt;away an executioners hood from some 45th+ level character.  He took the<br/>
&gt;serpentine bracers away from some 40th+ level character who deserved it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hold on a second...<br/>
<br/>
Obviously, the person who originally got this item deserved it, right?<br/>
Then, when they get something better, or just aren&#39;t going to use it<br/>
anymore, what should they do with it?  Destroy it?  So, they give/sell it to<br/>
someone.  Well, do they deserve it?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;And it&#39;s not the fact that he can go and get another one...it&#39;s the fact<br/>
&gt;that he is just going to have to wait that much longer because there is<br/>
&gt;some chump monk who can&#39;t earn his own equipment...he has to have older<br/>
&gt;friends help him out or just use his own older character to get things for<br/>
&gt;him cause he can&#39;t play the game like it was meant to be played.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So, if everyone should earn their own equipment, that sort of messes with<br/>
the whole player driven economy, doesn&#39;t it?  Anyone who sells armor is then<br/>
twinking...right?  The person buying that armor didn&#39;t earn it...right?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I hate twinking and i hate twinkers because you take things away from<br/>
&gt;people who rightfully deserve those items.  I don&#39;t care if your 48th<br/>
&gt;level kill stealing wizard had to shoot down the hopes of a group of 45th<br/>
&gt;levels to get the item....you still took it from them and gave it to<br/>
&gt;someone who is 1/2 their age...maybe younger.  Everytime you twink an item<br/>
&gt;you screw someone who REALLY AND TRULEY DESERVES THE ITEM.   <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The necessity of purchasing items or being twinked comes from the fact that<br/>
all of the good items are constantly camped by higher level players who<br/>
either get the items for themselves or sell them for outrageous prices.  You<br/>
want JBoots?  Well, be prepared to spend a good portion of your EQ life<br/>
camping for them, taking turns with god knows how many others (who may not<br/>
be willing to take turns themselves).<br/>
<br/>
So, who really deserves anything?  Apparently, it&#39;s the people who have<br/>
hours upon hours to camp certain areas, or those who have the finacial means<br/>
to buy the items from them.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone wants to give me their JBoots that they don&#39;t need anymore, how is<br/>
that affecting you?  I don&#39;t see how it would.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I think the one thing that people don&#39;t realize about this game and any<br/>
&gt;other game is that it is everyones responsibility to provide a roleplaying<br/>
&gt;environment.  it is EVERYONES responsibility to PROVIDE a ROLEPLAYING<br/>
&gt;ENVIRONMENT....it is a massively multiplayer roleplaying game after<br/>
&gt;all..... <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Roleplaying means what?  Playing a role of your character, right?  What does<br/>
that have to do with twinking?  Do you think that we are playing in a day<br/>
where no one gave gifts or handed down used items?<br/>
