<div id="ygrps-yiv-769668029">From everything I&#39;ve read, all you need is the blackened wand and the blackened sapphire, and the orange sash. I too am waiting on the sapphire. My advice is petition a GM BEFORE you try it, show the items to the GM, then turn them in. <br/>

&gt;	I have recently acquired an item which I was told is Marnek&#39;s wand.<br/>
&gt;However, I was under the impression that what was necessary to fulfil the<br/>
&gt;Monk&#39;s red sash quest are actually TWO PIECES of the Wand of the Burning<br/>
&gt;Dead.  I therefore expected to be needing two different inventory items.  I<br/>
&gt;asked somebody on-line about this, and he showed me his own Red Sash and<br/>
&gt;told me that the whole wand is what he used.<br/>
&gt;	Can somebody confirm this for me?  I&#39;m a little (well, a lot) leery<br/>
&gt;of gambling this whole wand as well as my sash (not to mention the<br/>
&gt;still-to-be-obtained saphire) when I turn them in for the Red sash.<br/>
&gt;	Oh yeah, one more thing.  I&#39;ve recently put both my orange sash and<br/>
&gt;orange headband in the bank and wend with mesh articles in their stead.<br/>
&gt;The theory is that the AC (and damage dissipation) they offer more than<br/>
&gt;offsets the small stat bonuses provided by the quest items - not to mention<br/>
&gt;the fact that we can&#39;t even proudly display these thins as we walk around.<br/>
&gt;Is anybody else of this opinion as well?  At what point would the<br/>
&gt;sash/headband properties outweigh mesh&#39;s?<br/>
