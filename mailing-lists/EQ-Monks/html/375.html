<div id="ygrps-yiv-930242893">On the topic of changing colors, adding graphics, and the whatnot, I<br/>
recently read an interview with the games&#39; top Graphic artist/implementor<br/>
(the name escapes me right now, sorry), and he mentioned a few very salient<br/>
points with regards to this same topic.  I, like most of you, thought that<br/>
there would be no problem adding more variation to the colors and the armor<br/>
that different types of armor could have to give them more variation.  Just<br/>
download the new graphic in an updated file, right?  Not so simple.  Sure<br/>
that would be all it took to get the new graphics out to the clients, but<br/>
you&#39;re forgetting one major problem with adding colors and variations.  This<br/>
game is a 3d game, not 2d, so all the objects in the game have to be<br/>
rendered on the fly by the graphics processor and the &quot;colors and patterns&quot;<br/>
in the game have to be able to fit into the texture memory of the video<br/>
card.  Not everyone has the newest coolest video cards with 8MB of texture<br/>
memory, or even 4MB.  A lot of people still use the &quot;old&quot; voodoo 1 cards<br/>
with 2MB of texture memory.  They wanted to release the game in a timely<br/>
manner (so they skimped a bit on the amount of variation in the colors), and<br/>
they wanted it to be playable on a large number of client machines.  Yes,<br/>
the game will load up as much texture memory as you have, so they didn&#39;t put<br/>
a limit of only a maximum of 2MB of textures in the video card&#39;s memory at<br/>
once (thank god or those of us with more wouldn&#39;t see very much benefit at<br/>
all from having better graphics cards).  But they wanted the game to be<br/>
playable with only 2MB of texture memory available.  That&#39;s why on older<br/>
cards (voodoo 1), when more than a few people come on the screen at once,<br/>
you start to slow down, and if you go into a zone where there&#39;s a large<br/>
number of players (like a bazaar in the tunnel to north ro from east<br/>
commons, where I&#39;ve seen over 200 people on occassion), you&#39;re updates crawl<br/>
as the textures are pushed out from the System RAM to the video texture RAM,<br/>
to the video processor.  The more texture RAM, the better this is, but even<br/>
with that many people with all the variations they already do have in the<br/>
game, the system WILL slow down.  Don&#39;t anyone tell me you haven&#39;t had your<br/>
graphics slow down, or I&#39;ll have to beat you (only kidding).  Now, if you<br/>
were to add a lot more variations (such as colors of armor, and more<br/>
character variations), you&#39;d have to lower the &quot;side&quot; count of the polygons<br/>
(what the textures get added to...for an example of what you sacrifice when<br/>
lowering the number of sides to a polygon, take a look at the screen shots<br/>
of Asheron&#39;s Call....the graphics aren&#39;t that swell looking to me, but you<br/>
do have a lot of variations) in order to keep the same level of performance.<br/>
Okay, I think I&#39;ll stop there as far as the technical talk goes, I&#39;m sure I<br/>
may be losing some people.  But basically, if they were to add a color,<br/>
they&#39;d have to put in the code to have the object now re-texture-mapped (not<br/>
a very dificult process no, but it will take processor time to do it on the<br/>
fly), and the texture count would go up significantly in a crowded room.<br/>
This is also why they broke the game down to the zones like they did.  At<br/>
most you have around 2 or 3 large variations in the landscape.  I.E. in the<br/>
East commonlands, you have some desert and some hills.  If they were to add<br/>
another region, like a lake, or an arctic region, you&#39;d have to load all<br/>
those textures into memory, or load them from system RAM on the fly, and<br/>
that would drag the performance way down.  The landscape they decided to<br/>
limit so that they could increase the number of textures available on people<br/>
so that there could be the variations that they do have.  okay, now I&#39;m<br/>
done.  I think.  Any questions, send them my way, and I&#39;ll try to answer as<br/>
concisely as possible.  for those of you that read this far, thanks for<br/>
staying with me.<br/>
