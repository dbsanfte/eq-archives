<div id="ygrps-yiv-1318505574"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;No offense Stone, but you are mistaken. Strength does indeed affect damage<br/>
 </span></blockquote>done, as it directly effects one&#39;s attack rating. More strength means higher<br/>
attack. Higher attack means more hits. More hits means more damage.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen data to the contrary. Play as you will.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;As for AC/MR/HP. PERIOD.... well... I would say you are mistaken here as<br/>
 </span></blockquote>well. It is certainly an optimum combination for some situations, but<br/>
definitely not for all situations. Lets take fighting Seafuies as an<br/>
example.<br/>
<br/>
That should be the general order in pursing equipment.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Why sacrifice Agi for MR when AGI will increase your AC (however<br/>
 </span></blockquote>minutely)and Seafuries do not cast (aside from the named one who only casts<br/>
mana drain)?<br/>
<br/>
Minutely is the key here. For example, Serp bracers. Great +7 AGI. 1 AC.<br/>
Better off with an AC 3 peice with   no AGI bonus.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;And if I am going to be pulling Tola (lvl 60 enchanter in<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sebelis) like I was last night, you get better believe I am going to break<br/>
out the MR gear over the AC gear I was using against the Jugs.<br/>
<br/>
In that case I agree. MR gear is more important.... not that I can carry<br/>
around of extra stuff. If I&#39;m pulling a mob that casts like that, My own<br/>
enchanter is casting GRM and I&#39;m a happy man.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;The only thing that remains unanimous is that AC is king... in most<br/>
 </span></blockquote>situations. From there the line gets blurred due to differing fighting<br/>
styles, group composition, combat situations, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like the lines blur all that much. Stats are irrelevant. Damage<br/>
output stays the same if your STR is 120 or 180 (shaman buffs) anyone. This<br/>
has been gone over before, and by verants admission they really do not<br/>
matter.<br/>
<br/>
The point being, when looking for gear, your first question should be &quot;Whats<br/>
the AC?&quot;. That +7 AGI +7 DEX necklace looks very tempting, but you&#39;d be<br/>
better of with a mesh or cured silk neck peice.<br/>
<br/>
I know sucks, I know its fun to believe it, I know its not the way most<br/>
monks want their character to be, but that is the way it is.<br/>

Except for the fact that STR has nothing to do with damage done, this is a<br/>
fine idea......<br/>
<br/>
There have been a HUGE amount of studies on what affects combat, and for<br/>
monks the answer is effectively NOTHING. Skill and level are what its all<br/>
about.<br/>
<br/>
AC/MR/HP. PERIOD.  Dex gear helps when you get a weapon that procs (love<br/>
that wu trance stick!), but still its not that big of deal....  It won&#39;t be<br/>
long before you just cannot carry this extra stuff around. I&#39;m at 14 weight<br/>
right now, with a box of abu-kar..... I really wish they&#39;d lossen that up at<br/>
higher levels. Adding 1hb weapons can push you over the edge pretty quickly.<br/>

You&#39;re going to want two suits, at least.  For soloing, you want AC and<br/>
resistances first, then str etc.  When you&#39;re in a group with good<br/>
tanks/healers, you want strength first.  The reasoning behind this is<br/>
simple.  When soloing, you want to make it as hard as possible for them to<br/>
hurt you.  When in a group, you can concentrate on damage rather than<br/>
defense since you won&#39;t be taking the hits if there are decent tanks in the<br/>
group.<br/>
My defense gear includes things like ac rings/earrings, symbols of loyalty<br/>
to vox, etc, all as light as possible.  My offense gear is strength<br/>
rings/earrings, hero/erollisi bracers, etc.  Yes, it puts me over my weight<br/>
limit (the hero bracer is 4 weight all by itself), but it&#39;s not really a<br/>
concern if I&#39;m not getting hit.<br/>

Well, I&#39;ve been fighting in Dalnir&#39;s for a while now (about two weeks, off<br/>
and on), and yesterday, I stumbeled upon THREE pieces of Crescent:  Gi,<br/>
arms,<br/>
and slippers.<br/>
<br/>
The slipers are a no-brainer, since I had been wearing cured silk.  But, the<br/>
other two are a bit harder.<br/>
<br/>
I *was* wearing a Foreman&#39;s Tunic (10AC, +3 STR, +3 WIS), so I think the<br/>
+7 str of the Gi more than makes up for the 2 AC difference.  (The Gi is<br/>
AC8)<br/>
<br/>
But, I&#39;m wearing Auzure sleves.  I don&#39;t think that the stats of the arms<br/>
even<br/>
come close to the AC of the Azure.  Comments?<br/>
<br/>
So, for now, I carry around the arms to sell with (+2 CHA)<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t wait to get more of this stuff.  I&#39;m still wearing cured silk<br/>
sholders<br/>
and cape. </span></blockquote></div>
