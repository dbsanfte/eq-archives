<div id="ygrps-yiv-296646705">Im in Najena with a group of 20&#39;s now. My exp has been that if the green <br/>
pets dont jump you then youll want to make it deep in where there are many <br/>
safe places to setup and pull to.  We like to setup by the ogre guard camp <br/>
fire near where the undead frogloks.  We then camp that room and pull the <br/>
goblin wizards from around the way. If you go the other way towards <br/>
bonecrusher etc. instead of going lft into his room go rihgt and down the <br/>
hall and then take the T left. There are 2 magicians in there and 1 ogre <br/>
officer which is good to gang up on etc. Then you can stay there and camp <br/>
from there. Hope this helps.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Is there ANY way to separate mobs that stack one on top the other? I was <br/>
&gt;in<br/>
&gt; &gt; Najena today trying to pull the Ogre Captain. I&#39;d hit him and run back <br/>
&gt;out<br/>
&gt; &gt; of the room. He would come along with one of his officers. But they were<br/>
&gt; &gt; directly on top of each other and they would consistently leave <br/>
&gt;together.<br/>
&gt; &gt; What am I doing wrong?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m actually camped outside of najena.  I went in with a group of 4 (lvls<br/>
&gt;18-21).  Could anyone give any pointers to fighting in this dungeon?  we<br/>
&gt;mainly just fought the ogre guards, and cleaned up some trains that people<br/>
&gt;brought to the zone line. (one guy trained bonecrusher, and following<br/>
&gt;along were 2 inkie necro&#39;s, their pets, and several oger guards).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;we wanted to go in further, but kept getting jumped by green pets, and<br/>
&gt;elementals that gave no exp, but hurt really bad when you hit them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;any specific class you want to group with here?  any good buffs to protect<br/>
&gt;agianst fire?<br/>
