<div id="ygrps-yiv-823261523">Brother, Neighbor, college friend, someone in pasadina you don&#39;t even<br/>
know... Its a game.  You happen to play with your brother, that&#39;s<br/>
wonderful, however EQ is still a game.  For you, the ability to<br/>
play a game together means you can spend time together.  That<br/>
is wonderful.  This doesn&#39;t make EQ more than a game.  EQ didn&#39;t exist<br/>
9 months ago, at some date in the future, EQ will not exist.  I hope<br/>
you have a contingency plan ready, because EQ is not life, or a way of<br/>
life, it is simply a game you enjoy together.  Joke all you want that<br/>
it is life, fine, no problem.  But when you read a post where someone<br/>
seriously thinks it is more than a game.  Please step back from it<br/>
and think about it.<br/>
<br/>
IF EQ was perfect, or something you&#39;ve been doing for tens of years<br/>
and nothing had ever changed on it, then you would have a much better<br/>
argument.  However we can clearly see that monks aren&#39;t being singled<br/>
out, almost every class is being tuned every month.  This one was<br/>
slightly major.<br/>
<br/>
But enough is enough.  Shit happens and we adjust.  This mailing list<br/>
is not about these kinds of posts or this kind of thread. <br/>
<br/>
The purpose of this list is to distribute information about Monks to the players of EverQuest. Spoilers may be included so read at your own risk. <br/>
<br/>
The purpose of this list is NOT to be a vent for your fustration.<br/>

&gt; Its not about &quot;chatting&quot;!!! I don&#39;t need some lame ass chat room to<br/>
&gt; talk to him.  I get bored to death with ICQ and chats and all that<br/>
&gt; stupid crap!!  Its not even about talking...its about doing something<br/>
&gt; together....the working together.  We don&#39;t have anything to do<br/>
&gt; together besides talking about &quot;well so have you talked to dad lately? <br/>
&gt; or how&#39;s mom doing?&quot;  BORING!!!  BUT when we are in EQ we fight mobs<br/>
&gt; together and I trust him completely..he is my brother!  I love him more<br/>
&gt; than anyone.  We just don&#39;t have much to say and this way its like he<br/>
&gt; lives near me and I can do things with him all the time.  Last time I<br/>
&gt; saw him...we sat and played diablo all day or something.  This is<br/>
&gt; something we enjoy doing together!  And for your info..yes I have been<br/>
&gt; in Lower guk fighting and carrying on a coversation with him....guess I<br/>
&gt; am just multi-tasking...or something.  <br/>

&gt; &gt; If the only reason you and your brother talk to each other is because<br/>
&gt; &gt; you<br/>
&gt; &gt; are both in EQ than you have a serious relationship problem. You<br/>
&gt; &gt; could chat<br/>
&gt; &gt; in e-mail or ICQ but you say you dont have the time. For your own<br/>
&gt; &gt; brother?<br/>
&gt; &gt; Yet you go ingame and use it like a chat room, doing nothing but<br/>
&gt; &gt; sending<br/>
&gt; &gt; messages back and forth. You can&#39;t tell me you are in Sol B fighting<br/>
&gt; &gt; whatever while you chat with him. I&#39;ve tried carrying on<br/>
&gt; &gt; conversations while<br/>
&gt; &gt; fighting and it doesn&#39;t work real well. So you sit in game and chat<br/>
&gt; &gt; but you<br/>
&gt; &gt; have no time to sit out of game and chat. With your own family.....<br/>
&gt; &gt; That<br/>
&gt; &gt; doesnt make EQ more than a game, just a game with a chat<br/>
&gt; &gt; feature......<br/>
