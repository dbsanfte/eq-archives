<div id="ygrps-yiv-1447780153">Greetings Brothers and Sisters,<br/>
I have recently heard a rumor that i would like to find more about. It seems <br/>
that in high hold pass there is a wondering monk. And if you get your <br/>
stnding with the citizens of high hold, high enought he will offer to teach <br/>
you the skills. Like i said this is only a rumor. I was wondering if anyone <br/>
out there has seen this monk. or been able to ge these skills?<br/>
