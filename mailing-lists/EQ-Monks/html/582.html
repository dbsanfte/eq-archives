<div id="ygrps-yiv-773045270">Why does twinking bother you so much?<br/>
You make a valid point that it spoils the game for the guy who twinked his<br/>
character - I mean he has nothing to look forward to but weeks of<br/>
pwerlevelling his guy to levle 50...<br/>
But how does it affect you or your enjoyment of the game?<br/>
Coluld it be it makes you jealous?<br/>
<br/>
I dont twink myself but I have no<br/>
problem with twinkers. Let them twink!  How does that affect my<br/>
play/enjoyment? Express anger/resentment at peopl who twink and those who<br/>
allow themselves to be twinked. By this you are implying that if someone<br/>
were to offer you a haste sash and 2 serpentine bracers you would turn<br/>
them down (Nay, you would curse them out for trying to twink you!).  <br/>
<br/>
Personally if someone offered me all that great stuff I would accept it<br/>
happily and be thankfull to them.  So suppose my level 30 monk were to be<br/>
walking around decked out in level 45-50 gear would your everquest gaming<br/>
expereince be affected in teh least?<br/>

&gt; i don&#39;t be caring how *hic* much you hunted mammoths.  By your 22nd yeer<br/>
&gt; you still *burp* canna afford an exe hood, serpentine bracers and hav<br/>
&gt; mutliple black pearls....unless yer twinked or yer *hic* guild twinked the<br/>
&gt; mudder loving hell out a ya.  Still either way....it&#39;s a friggin shame<br/>
&gt; that peepol twink themselves or allow themselves to be *burp* twinked.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; p.s.  ill say this in plain ole english...not drunk speek.  I saw a<br/>
&gt; 17-19th level SK hunting in Oasis.  Full suit of rubi/carnal armor.<br/>
&gt; Purity Belt, Dark Reaver, BP Choker, Plantinum Silver Ruby Veil, Dwarven<br/>
&gt; Work Boots and a White Wolf Hide Cloak.  Whats the fun at that<br/>
&gt; point...when everything you want for your character you already have.<br/>
&gt; There is just no point.  I wish twinking was a bannable offense.<br/>
