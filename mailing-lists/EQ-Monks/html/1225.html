<div id="ygrps-yiv-1533296447">I disagree with that. The spawn is a 72-75 minute one. Near the entrance of<br/>
Runny Eye, there is a 6 min spawn at the first fork. At the exact same spot<br/>
there is also the long spawn. Both are waderers but they don&#39;t go very far.<br/>
Be there every 70 min to kill it, and you are ok. That&#39;s the way it worked<br/>
for all the monks who got it. Unfortunately, I have camped it every day for<br/>
at least 11 hours, for a total of may be 120 hours, and he never spawned,<br/>
except when I was gone... Today will be my last day on it. Back to leveling,<br/>
I have spent enough useless time.<br/>

Well even though they are just a dex +3 goves.  I&#39;ve been camping them<br/>
anyways.  I have all the components but the humorous handled mace.  I camped<br/>
it for about 9 hours yesterday.  Killed every gobbo i came across.  Somebody<br/>
told me that the alchamists is a seven hour spawn, and that the placeholder<br/>
is a wondering goblin.  So first thing you do is wonder through beholder and<br/>
kill every single goblin you come accross.  I logged on at 7:40 MTN and a<br/>
guy there said he had spawn at around 7:00.  Well good hunting to you all,<br/>
and i hope you put this info to good use.<br/>
