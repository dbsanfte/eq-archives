<div id="ygrps-yiv-410548152">I bought a pair of fur-lined slippers.  they have a +7 agi boost, and<br/>
are low weight.  I didnt get the kobold boots because of weight, which I<br/>
think is 2.5.  However, i have no idea where those slippers came from.<br/>

&gt; get them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	Heh... I was stuck with Patchwork boots (leather weighed too <br/>
&gt; much) until about level 27 when I finally got hold of some Kobold <br/>
&gt; Hide Boots.  I&#39;ve gone through the equipment lists, and besides the <br/>
&gt; Shiverback stuff, that&#39;s about as good as we&#39;re likely to get. <br/>
&gt; (Possible exception of the JMan boots, but I&#39;m not going for them <br/>
&gt; because the AC sucks and they&#39;re one of the most heavily camped items <br/>
&gt; in the game.)<br/>
