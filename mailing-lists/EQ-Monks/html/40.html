<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-661099151">Hmph... Finally hit 20 last night (well, technically it was this<br/>
morning, I guess :) ), and I got to thinking about what life&#39;ll be like<br/>
once I get all &#39;grown up&#39;.  At this level, I&#39;m able to handle myself fairly<br/>
well as long as I don&#39;t go overboard, but the thought struck me that it&#39;s<br/>
unlikely that I&#39;ll be able to pull off some of the kills that I&#39;m seeing<br/>
other like-leveled classes do all around me - or at least not until<br/>
significantly higher levels.  I can deal with the fact that monks might not<br/>
really &#39;mature&#39; until level 30 or so, but that doesn&#39;t mean I have to like<br/>
it...<br/>
	While dwelling on this, I began to consider options which might<br/>
help me accomplish some of these same tasks.  This brought me to get down<br/>
to one of the basic difference between ourselves and our closest cousin,<br/>
the warrior.  With the right equipment, etc. the two classes can do about<br/>
equivilant damage, but while warriors can take a lot more than we can (by<br/>
virtue of their greater hit points), we can tank just as well as they can<br/>
because our forte is to handle damage coming our way by simply NOT GETTING<br/>
HIT.<br/>
	With this realization in mind, the question becomes one of<br/>
increasing our AC and resistances without violating the Prime Weight<br/>
Directive.  I&#39;ve been doing all right up to now with a full set of Woven<br/>
(exceptions: LockJaw vest, Orange Sash, Orange Headband), but I suspect<br/>
that I&#39;m outgrowing these.  This is where I hit a bit of a roadblock:<br/>
What&#39;s next on the ol&#39; armor menu, and what steps need ot be taken to<br/>
acquire it?<br/>
	Yes, I&#39;ve heard about some of the more exotic armor (Rubicite,<br/>
Green, etc.), but remember that I&#39;m only level 20, and as such cannot go<br/>
after level 30-50+ mobs to get these things or come anywhere CLOSE to<br/>
affording to buy them from a fellow player willing to sell them (yeah, like<br/>
THAT happens so often).  I assume that I&#39;m not the first person to have<br/>
these thoughts, so I was wondering what others have done to address these<br/>
concerns.<br/>
	Eagerly awaiting input...<br/>
