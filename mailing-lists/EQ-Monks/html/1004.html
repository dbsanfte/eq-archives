<div id="ygrps-yiv-230573831">Because Mobs are just a big fuggin joke, thats all....  Or maybe the players<br/>
are the joke?  I can imagine the GMS and Brad laughing at everyone as a<br/>
train of froggies rips through guk and slaughters all the newbies.  Mobs<br/>
should be EQUAL in ability to players, so it isn&#39;t impossible to kill a mob<br/>
of your level alone.  Good thing I&#39;m quitting EQ anyway.</div>
