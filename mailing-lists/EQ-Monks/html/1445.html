<div id="ygrps-yiv-45447448">Instill Doubt happens to be one of my favorite skills. I group regularly <br/>
with two rangers and a druid. After a MOB is snared, drop on a dose of <br/>
doubt and proceed to hit said MOB in the back... The problem is that <br/>
Instill is so slow to improve. Basically, you need to practice it on <br/>
everything. When you are sailing on the boat, target the boat and practice <br/>
Instill Doubt. Practice it while targeting a friend or a random corpse in <br/>
Unrest while healing up. You can even practice it while feigned, sitting, <br/>
or twiddling your thumbs : ).<br/>
<br/>
Very entertaining to watch creatures run away in fear... Not certain how <br/>
fear works with root, but if you were soloing and could accommodate your <br/>
weight so that you could carry a Treant Staff, it might be fun.<br/>

&gt;Make sure to stop attacking for a sec before you fd.  Then it should work a<br/>
&gt;lot more than it fails at lvl 70 skill.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sneak is fantastic when you are the scout and mapping out a new dungeon.<br/>
&gt;When other characters would get wiped out, you can sneak past guards.  Hehe,<br/>
&gt;when that fails, you just fd.  Works out great.  (You haven&#39;t had fun till<br/>
&gt;you scout out a dungeon full of red mob&#39;s with another monk.  You and the<br/>
&gt;other monk can sneak around, fd when needed, then find lower level mobs to<br/>
&gt;wipe out before the red ones find you.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Someone else will have to answer about instill doubt.  I haven&#39;t had good<br/>
&gt;luck with it either.<br/>
