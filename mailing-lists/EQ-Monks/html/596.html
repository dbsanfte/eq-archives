<div id="ygrps-yiv-44113500">it is not about jealousy. It is about taking pride in actually earning the<br/>
gear I wear and knowing that what I have, I got for myself, whether by<br/>
earning coin enough to buy it or by venturing and slaying the beast that<br/>
carries it. I got it. I did not have it handed to me on a silver platter by<br/>
some high level friend who already has no problem getting as many as he<br/>
wants.<br/>
<br/>
Kind of like that spoiled rich kid in high school who was driving the<br/>
Corvette. Sure he looks cool, but you know damn well he didn&#39;t pay for it or<br/>
the insurance that comes with it. Would I like to own a vette? you bet.<br/>
Would I take one if my folks offered it to me? hell no. All a matter of self<br/>
pride vs. selfishness<br/>
