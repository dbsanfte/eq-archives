<div id="ygrps-yiv-1406789421">I am a 9th monk fighting Giant Spiders in the east commons.  They <br/>
give me good experience, but I find myself having to run at around 2 <br/>
bubbles of health left because otherwise I will die from the poison.  <br/>
Can anyone give me a list of equipment (not too expensive) that has <br/>
nice resistances to poison? Thanks alot. -Ashanak on Tunare</div>
