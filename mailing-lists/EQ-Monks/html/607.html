Not sure how you got your monk to level 4 with only 6 H2H, but I suppose<br/>
if youy hunted in groups it was possible.  Certainly by time youy hit mid<br/>
levels like 10+ you max out skills within the first buble of  a new level.<br/>
Skills are never a worry for me.<br/>

&gt; Only thing twinking does to me ( I assume other too) Make the game boring<br/>
&gt; and soon forgotten.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I found that if I use cheat codes or twink I soon loose interest in the<br/>
&gt; chalange of the moment.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For the same reason I dislike begger and those who consitly ask for a hand<br/>
&gt; out.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Life is a hard life for a monk, give thanks for the things that pass by your<br/>
&gt; way. To level with ggreat speed, is that hurting you more then not?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  The qustion is, If a person Speed Levels( very quick EXPS) will his skills<br/>
&gt; keep up, or will they lag behind?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I had a monk who whent to level 4 very quicky and only had H2H of 6 and Kick<br/>
&gt; of 7, Was that just me or does speed kill?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Towshee of the many servers<br/>
