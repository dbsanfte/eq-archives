<div id="ygrps-yiv-1350224767">From what I have read, and what I have experienced, FD goes up really slow, <br/>
I mean CRAWLING slow.  I put one point in it at 18th (starting me at 18)and <br/>
have been hitting it almost constantly, running, waiting, I mean anytime I <br/>
remember to hit the thing, and I think it just hit 35.  I hear once it hits <br/>
50, it goes up a bit faster.  If you want to see it work, stand in front of <br/>
a green mob that wont agro on you, and preferably won&#39;t move.  and hit ONLY <br/>
the ID key, and just keep hitting it over and over and eventually it will go <br/>
off on it.  At such a low level, this skill is not going to benifit you in <br/>
combat in anyway, for a good while.  Ahh well I know people who have gotten <br/>
it to the low 100s but I don&#39;t often hear that it is a great help.  Probably <br/>
just as much of a help as a Spell Thrower&#39;s fear spell.<br/>

&gt;My FD works great.. has saved my butt HEAPS.. just<br/>
&gt;keep practicing like crazy...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Instill doubt.. well, I try to practice and practice..<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t see it working.. don&#39;t see it improving either<br/>
&gt;*shrugs hopelessly*  but then I said that with Safe<br/>
&gt;Fall at early levels too :-))  Now THAT is maxxed<br/>
&gt;within 5 mins of gaining a new level :-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sneak is very sneaky.. hehe...  AND if you find a<br/>
&gt;vendor that don&#39;t like you, just use sneak and he/she<br/>
&gt;immediately becomes indifferent... hooray!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I love my Monk, have Mend and Bind Wound over 100 and<br/>
&gt;hardly ever have to sit down!  Drives my partner<br/>
&gt;crazy.. :-))<br/>
