<div id="ygrps-yiv-2106473086"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Thanks for the tips, brothers. Oasis has never been very kind to me, but<br/>
&gt;perhaps I need to give it a chance.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The caiman/croc side of Oasis is ok, but it&#39;s usually so crowded.   Try <br/>
hunting the other side (orc side) of the zone with a good group.   I am <br/>
level 15, and hunting there is going great!  All of the &quot;an&quot; orc warriors <br/>
are blue or white, orc clerics are blue and white.   AND since my group <br/>
contains a level 18 mage, we can even take down the &quot;a&quot; orc warriors (Level <br/>
20 mob).   There are more orcs than you can shake a stick at, plus the loot <br/>
is way better than fighting crocs.   Also, on Brell at least, there is VERY <br/>
low competition for kills.  I think at best I see one other group hunting <br/>
the ENTIRE side of the zone.<br/>
<br/>
Normally we set up camp on a little ledge somewhere near the SW corner of <br/>
the zone.  We more or less constant kill blue mobs, with the occasional <br/>
white or red thrown in.<br/>
