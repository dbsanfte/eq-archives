<div id="ygrps-yiv-764976106">I have seen two wizzes and a druid take on a sandgiant using the &quot;TAG&quot;<br/>
technique. basically the druid casts DOT and SNARE on mr ALi, then The<br/>
first wizz &quot;TAG&#39;s&quot; him with a massize DD...naturally Ali turns to take on<br/>
his new attacker but just as he is about to pound the living daylights out<br/>
of Wizzie number one, Wizzie number two NUKes - once or twice untill Ali<br/>
is attacking him. bear in mind the Druid is healing and casting DD spells<br/>
of his own all this time..  <br/>
<br/>
It is a beautifull tactic though it can get .......umm .....messsy if a<br/>
second SG wonders by.<br/>

&gt; Ok, how about:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1. Wizard<br/>
&gt; 2. Wizard<br/>
&gt; 3. Wizard<br/>
&gt; 4. Wizard<br/>
&gt; 5. Wizard<br/>
&gt; 6. Wizard<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m 30th, and there is not much that lives through 6 of the big<br/>
&gt; wizard spells.  This group with die horribly to the wrong target,  <br/>
&gt; but around 35th level this group would walk through giants (i think).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If this group can coordinate, nothing moves, its standing at full, then its<br/>
&gt; dead.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;         The Bard is the one pulling. He will be taking the brunt of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;damage while the Enchanter does Crowd Control. They will stay on the Bard<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;because he is the one that pulled them and because those Songs piss Mobs<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;off. If the Wizards use /assist they will be taking out what the Bard has<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;targeted. Enchanter will use Mesmerization for AoE Crowd Control and there<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;should only be 1 fighting at a time. You are quite mistaken about this<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;group. This is the MOST powerful group that you can have. There is no other<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;group that will do more damage in a shorter amount of time. It is not right<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;for every situation, but it is the best for most situations.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; This still seems iffy to me, especially if you pull more than two mobs, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; they get lucky around of resisting....<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I wouldn&#39;t feel comfortable without a dedicated melee class to start bash&#39;n<br/>
&gt; &gt; and distract&#39;n.<br/>
