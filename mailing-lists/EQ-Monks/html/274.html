<div id="ygrps-yiv-2068471134">i got my faction upto warmly by doing the white sash quest about 50 times or<br/>
more.;)<br/>
i got my faction so high with the guild that i defeated a guild master in a<br/>
dual for the black sash and they still see me warmly.8)<br/>
<br/>
to do the quest as quickly as possible go and get a backpack or 2 and<br/>
collect all the needed components from a vendor to do the quest a few times.<br/>
all components are stackable so its not to hard to get @least 40 orc scalps,<br/>
20 bones, and 20 snake skins.<br/>
then just set there and keep turning in the needed components while<br/>
destroying the sashes.<br/>
it&#39;s kinda tedious but it gets the job done.<br/>

O.K. I need help!!!!!! Im a monk form Qeynos and Im trying to do the <br/>
freeport monk quests but it wont let me! Whenever I try it the monks say I <br/>
need to prove myself or some such message but I can find nothing to kill/do <br/>
in order to incresae my faction to do their quests. IM curently working on <br/>
the red headband questout of qey. Any Ideas????????? At this point Ill take <br/>
anything legal or not to get started. IM tired of seeing everybody doing <br/>
both quests while I can only do one!<br/>
