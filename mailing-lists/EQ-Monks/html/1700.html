<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1812584586">Hi... Sorry to barge into your group uninvited, but I&#39;m a BBC <br/>
reporter looking for an avid EQ fan who lives in the London area, and <br/>
wouldn&#39;t mind giving up an hour of their life next Thursday (3rd Oct) <br/>
to tell us what it is about the game that makes it so popular. It&#39;s <br/>
for a 4 minute feature that&#39;s going into the techie show on the BBC <br/>
world service - Click Online.<br/>
<br/>
If you can help me, please mail me asap on <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:kate@...">kate@...</a>. Also, if you know anywhere else I could <br/>
post to get the message out I&#39;d be very happy to hear from you. <br/>
Thanks for your time.<br/>
Kate</div>
