<div id="ygrps-yiv-2086238139">Your entire opinion will change once you hit 30th level. You will start<br/>
outdamaging almost everyone. I am in the high 40s and have outdamaged 3 50th<br/>
Paladins. We are a great tank AC goes up every level as Defense goes up and<br/>
we dont have to hunt down all kinds of crap for armor. attacking 4 times in<br/>
a round and hitting for 30 to 50 points each shot and then kicking for 90+<br/>
you will pull almost anything off a party member...clerics...in no time.<br/>
Give it some more time and I think you will see that all this changes.<br/>

&gt; I for one like the current damage we do. I don&#39;t think we should be<br/>
&gt; out-damaging a warrior swinging a big 2h weapon or dual wielding, and I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t want to. They have the ac and the hp to protect them from those 50+<br/>
&gt; damage blows that would chew us up in very little time. I have always been<br/>
&gt; of the belief that the monk is NOT a tank. Our armor limitations prevent<br/>
us<br/>
&gt; from acting like one. With one MoB, we are fine as Dodge and Block will<br/>
&gt; serve us well, but if we get hit, we get hit HARD. With 2 or more MoB&#39;s,<br/>
our<br/>
&gt; Dodge and Block skill will not serve us nearly as well. We are more like<br/>
an<br/>
&gt; animated DoT spell, inflicting a steady amount of damage throughout the<br/>
&gt; duration of a fight. Few people can dish out the damage we can yet remain<br/>
&gt; relatively unmolested. A drawback is it is very difficult to pull a MoB<br/>
off<br/>
&gt; a party member who is in trouble, and perhaps I would enjoy having a Taunt<br/>
&gt; skill (no I don&#39;t think it is built into our special attacks), but I for<br/>
one<br/>
&gt; think the Monk class on the whole is doing just fine.<br/>

&gt; &gt;  Lots of good points brought up in this discussion.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  I agree completely that we should get some kind of stunning attack, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; our delay should beat most, if not all, weapons. As a very well-equipped<br/>
&gt; &gt; monk<br/>
&gt; &gt; at lvl 40, I am routinely outdamaged by Ogre and Troll warriors, to say<br/>
&gt; &gt; nothing of casters. So, though we have some unique abilities, monks<br/>
could<br/>
&gt; &gt; certainly stand some improvement. On my server, monks are sought<br/>
primarily<br/>
&gt; &gt; as<br/>
&gt; &gt; pullers rather than combatants, b/c of Feign pulling...<br/>
&gt; &gt;  But until we get organized, and talk to Verant in some organized<br/>
manner,<br/>
&gt; &gt; we<br/>
&gt; &gt; will get very little...<br/>
