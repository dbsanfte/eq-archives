weapon at all unless there is a 1hb weapon that weighs less than a pound or<br/>
so. Holding a black enamled mace I can keep my wieght to 14 if I take off my<br/>
shoes. but to me it is just not worth it at this point in time.<br/>

&gt; &gt;From someone who has played a more traditional tank, I would offer that<br/>
28<br/>
&gt; delay is relatively slow.  If a monk&#39;s fists are slower than that, then we<br/>
&gt; are truly slighted.  I&#39;ve never seen numbers on the delay of hand to hand,<br/>
&gt; but I&#39;m really hoping it&#39;s faster than 28 (more like 20 or so, and maybe<br/>
&gt; dependent on level).  I&#39;m not sure what level you are, but put it this<br/>
way,<br/>
&gt; you&#39;ll never see anyone dual wielding anything that slow past about level<br/>
&gt; 25, except maybe in their off hand, but their dual wield is about 3 levels<br/>
&gt; below ours.  They are less concerned with how often the dual wield hits,<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; more with how much dmg it does.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I would suggest, that if you&#39;d like to play with a mace, use only one, and<br/>
&gt; in your off hand.<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;my main point is that no one really knows what does what.  I&#39;ve read WAY<br/>
&gt; &gt;too much about which stat should go where, and the only consensus is that<br/>
&gt; &gt;no one really knows.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;my philosophy is 2 fold.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;1) I belive (with no empirical data to back it up) that once a stat gets<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; &gt;a certain level, adjusting that stat will have diminishing returns. i.e<br/>
&gt; &gt;add +5 to a stat that is at 90, and thats a big change.  and +5 to a<br/>
&gt; &gt;stat that is at 130, and the change is less noticeable.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;and<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;2) most of the high level shiverback stuff adjusts str, dex, and agil.<br/>
&gt; &gt;(also stamina)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;so, I&#39;m trying to build a well balanced character.  Its quite possible<br/>
&gt; &gt;that for some situations agil is needed, for others str in important.<br/>
&gt; &gt;different situations are based on Mob type, group/solo, level...just too<br/>
&gt; &gt;many varieties.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I&#39;m also trying to get a balance of +resistance (cold, fire, magic..etc).<br/>
&gt; &gt;That seems to be quite a bit more difficult<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I&#39;m not saying that anyone is right, or anyone is wrong.  Just a humble<br/>
&gt; &gt;monk expaining his philosophies.  :)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;on a side note.  I also have a feeling that speading up our attacks would<br/>
&gt; &gt;have the biggest impact.  I&#39;m planning on duel weilding some maces (rate<br/>
&gt; &gt;of 28) to compare against my fists.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  I would go for improving mainly AGI and DEX... STR does affect<br/>
attack,<br/>
&gt; &gt;but<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; our attack in already higher than any other class, and we end up with<br/>
an<br/>
&gt; &gt;ATK<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; higher than any others except for the most magically enhanced warriors<br/>
&gt; &gt;-- and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; those who have such an ATK will have much worse DEX or AGI than a<br/>
monk.<br/>
