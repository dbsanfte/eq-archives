&gt;4.  Is there anyway to prevent a PC thief from picking your pockets? ( He<br/>
&gt;was a PC, because I wasn&#39;t allowed to attack him, even though he was my<br/>
&gt;current target.)  I see this as having a negative effect on my character.<br/>
&gt;If they can effect my character in a negative way, why can&#39;t I do the same<br/>
&gt;to them?  A quick kick or throw would end that problem.   I have a hard<br/>
&gt;time believing that some Shadowknight or Necro is going to stand there<br/>
&gt;while some little sneak thief makes off with their hard earned money or<br/>
&gt;items.  It wouldn&#39;t have been so bad if they hadn&#39;t taunted me about it and<br/>
&gt;then run off.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>no there is nothing you can do.  mostly because this is an emote and<br/>
not a real action.  did you bother to check your equipment/cash to<br/>
verify whether or not he had taken what he said he took?</div>
