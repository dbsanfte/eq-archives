<b>Subject:</b> Re: which stat? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1175446155">my main point is that no one really knows what does what.  I&#39;ve read WAY<br/>
too much about which stat should go where, and the only consensus is that<br/>
no one really knows.<br/>
<br/>
my philosophy is 2 fold.  <br/>
<br/>
1) I belive (with no empirical data to back it up) that once a stat gets to<br/>
a certain level, adjusting that stat will have diminishing returns. i.e<br/>
add +5 to a stat that is at 90, and thats a big change.  and +5 to a<br/>
stat that is at 130, and the change is less noticeable.<br/>
<br/>
and <br/>
<br/>
2) most of the high level shiverback stuff adjusts str, dex, and agil.<br/>
(also stamina)<br/>
<br/>
so, I&#39;m trying to build a well balanced character.  Its quite possible<br/>
that for some situations agil is needed, for others str in important.<br/>
different situations are based on Mob type, group/solo, level...just too<br/>
many varieties.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also trying to get a balance of +resistance (cold, fire, magic..etc).<br/>
That seems to be quite a bit more difficult<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying that anyone is right, or anyone is wrong.  Just a humble<br/>
monk expaining his philosophies.  :)<br/>
<br/>
on a side note.  I also have a feeling that speading up our attacks would<br/>
have the biggest impact.  I&#39;m planning on duel weilding some maces (rate<br/>
of 28) to compare against my fists.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt;  I would go for improving mainly AGI and DEX... STR does affect attack, but <br/>
&gt; our attack in already higher than any other class, and we end up with an ATK <br/>
&gt; higher than any others except for the most magically enhanced warriors -- and <br/>
&gt; those who have such an ATK will have much worse DEX or AGI than a monk.<br/>
