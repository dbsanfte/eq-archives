<div id="ygrps-yiv-1460286751">um actually a ranger and warrior (and sk and paladin for that matter)<br/>
all taunt as well as each other don&#39;t they all level +1 * 5 ?<br/>
<br/>
Infact a ranger taunts better MOBs really hate snare and flame lick (go<br/>
figure they are low level druid spells). But when ever a ranger casts<br/>
either of them it seems to get special attention.<br/>
<br/>
As for ranger spells being useless.<br/>
Why I question your judgement....<br/>
1. snare ... better then root but they have root too<br/>
2. harmony outdoors only makes them a great puller<br/>
3. camo and greater camo<br/>
if you haven&#39;t got a shaman in the group<br/>
4. Feetlike cat<br/>
<br/>
And while there dots are not great all damage helps, nor their DD... but<br/>
if a MOB roots a few tanks and then takes off no other primarily melee<br/>
class can dish as much damage at a distance (crit bow hits and weak dd<br/>
spells).<br/>

&gt; &gt; 1 - Monk<br/>
&gt; &gt; 2 - Monk / Ranger / Paladin<br/>
&gt; &gt; 3 - Enchanter<br/>
&gt; &gt; 4 - Druid / Shaman<br/>
&gt; &gt; 5 - Cleric<br/>
&gt; &gt; 6 - Wizard / Magician<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; Change 2 to Monk / Warrior.  In a group as diversified<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; as this, the spells they have are almost useless, and a warrior<br/>
&gt; should be able to taunt the monsters better.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Add a bard, replaces 5.  In a group of 5 or 6<br/>
&gt; a bard is a far better healer than a cleric, and if needed in<br/>
&gt; a pinch, the druid/shaman can do the quick healing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What is the min level for a group in Mistmoore?<br/>
