<div id="ygrps-yiv-1548151504">Wanna help out your party? Then be smart when you fight. Realize when the<br/>
fight is turning against you and don&#39;t hang around until your party members<br/>
start dying. In my groups, and granted I am only lvl 22 and don&#39;t have<br/>
immediate access to Res or anything along those lines, it is standard<br/>
practice to, when the fight is going badly for everyone, they back off, I<br/>
get the critter(s) attention so they turn on me, and they take off. Now it&#39;s<br/>
time to feign. This has only not worked 1 time (Party lived, I died). Each<br/>
other time, the party has escaped, our druid has come back to SoW me, or Wiz<br/>
come back to invis me, I pop up and head for the escape route.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I love my monk. I have played nearly every other class, and none<br/>
of them give me the enjoyment of my monk. If you believe that we are a<br/>
selfish class, then (and no problem with it btw &lt;g&gt;) that is the way you rp<br/>
him. Praelor is anything but selfish. I would rather take the death than<br/>
have our Paladin with 1000&#39;s of plat worth of armor and weapons take it.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t care much about damage potential or tanking ability (gawd I do hate<br/>
that word tho... Wish people would realize we are NOT tanks. We are the guys<br/>
in that little pill box with the machine gun. Tuff to hit, but when we do<br/>
get hit, it usually hurts.). I know that a Ranger 2 lvls higher than me cant<br/>
pull a critter off me unless he casts. <br/>
<br/>
The monk is as effective or as useless as you want him to be. And there is<br/>
more than just the constant drone of fighting to EQ. I think that if that is<br/>
all you are concerned about, gaining levels, then the grass will always be<br/>
greener in someone else&#39;s yard no matter what class you play.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
btw... I am just stating my opinions here... it is not my intention to flame<br/>
anyone or start a heated debate. I wish you all the best of luck with your<br/>
monks or whatever class you choose to play =)<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; yes... but we are a very selfish class...<br/>
&gt; another words... what do we do when everyone in the party is dying..<br/>
&gt; heal them?... no.<br/>
&gt; taunt?... no<br/>
&gt; wonder if feign death is gonna save our ass?... yes<br/>
&gt; to me that kinda sucks...<br/>
&gt; i like being able to help out in bad situations...<br/>
&gt; yes.. it would be nice to have taunt...<br/>
&gt; or maybe a death touch that does alot of dmg to get the mobs attention<br/>
&gt; (could recycle once an hour or so.)<br/>
&gt; or how about being able to use our mend on someone besides yourself...<br/>
&gt; very<br/>
&gt; minor but better than nothing.<br/>
&gt; i like to help ppl out.. especially my party.<br/>
&gt; i loan out money.. and give away items all the time...<br/>
&gt; and i&#39;m thankfull i can @least do that.<br/>
&gt; but sure would be nice to be able to save lives.<br/>
&gt; almost every class with the exception of us and rogues can do something.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ranger, sk, warrior can taunt<br/>
&gt; druid, wizzard can evac<br/>
&gt; necro, enchanter can mez<br/>
&gt; cleric can heal and res<br/>
&gt; i&#39;m pretty sure mage pets can taunt or @they could blast a mob to get em<br/>
&gt; off<br/>
&gt; an evacer or cleric.<br/>
&gt; hopefully one day rogues will be able to detect traps.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; if i left out a class i just couldn&#39;t think of it.<br/>
&gt; ohh yeah... we got instill doubt... ohh boy.. but all i&#39;ve heard is that<br/>
&gt; it<br/>
&gt; sucks.<br/>
&gt; from both rogues and bards.<br/>
&gt; it hardly ever works and when it does it just causes trains.(&#39;<br/>
&gt; and how the hell am i gonna fit it on my quick keys?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; i guess my whole point is i want a party to feel like i can help them out<br/>
&gt; when things get bad.<br/>
&gt; if you don&#39;t care about that then thats fine...<br/>
&gt; but i don&#39;t think roleplaying is gonna make u feel any better when your<br/>
&gt; whole party is dead and your lying on the floor feeling like crap because<br/>
&gt; u<br/>
&gt; couldn&#39;t taunt the mob off of your evacer or off your cleric.<br/>

&gt; &gt; but if u think your gonna be able to start the best class in the game<br/>
&gt; now<br/>
&gt; &gt; and it be the best class by the time u hit 50... think again.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That&#39;s the thing.  In EQ, there&#39;s not supposed to be a BEST class.  Each<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; every class will have its ups and downs, and, in the end, we all need each<br/>
&gt; other.  Sure, there might be imbalances at times, but I don&#39;t think you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; going<br/>
&gt; to find a lot of groups refusing you just because you&#39;re a monk.  If they<br/>
&gt; do,<br/>
&gt; you probably didn&#39;t want to group with them anyway.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Personally, I love playing a monk.  Not because we&#39;re the BEST class in<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; game<br/>
&gt; or do more melee damage than anyone else, but because the monk class is<br/>
&gt; one<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; the most unique classes in the game.  Who else dishes out as much damage<br/>
&gt; as<br/>
&gt; we<br/>
&gt; do with their bare hands?  Who else has as much AC as we do while wearing<br/>
&gt; plain<br/>
&gt; looking clothes? (Yes, I _like_ looking ordinary.)  Who else has a cool<br/>
&gt; flying<br/>
&gt; kick?  Who else (besides rogues) can jump from Kelethin and survive?  For<br/>
&gt; me, <br/>
&gt; playing a monk is enjoyable not because I&#39;m the best figher in the game,<br/>
&gt; but<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; because monks are unique and fun to roleplay.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But then, that&#39;s just my opinion.  Go forth, and form your own.<br/>
