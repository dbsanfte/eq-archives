&gt;No I dont see a problem with this but if you wish to RP your monk maybe you<br/>
&gt;should not buy anything but only use what items you loot yourself. this way<br/>
&gt;you would not have to save up so much money. Another thoguht is that those<br/>
&gt;bracers come off of a difficult Mob in Lguk. at level 16 you werent<br/>
&gt;&quot;supposed&quot; to have those. Back at level 16 when E-marr was still new and the<br/>
&gt;highest playes were only in there low 30&#39;s noone had those bracers. People<br/>
&gt;on the server didnt even know where they came from. I Think I was wearing<br/>
&gt;woven still at that point. dont dispair because you dont have level 30<br/>
&gt;equipment at level 16. you will get it eventually.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>But the problem is that there are those at my level or close to it who<br/>
*can* afford this stuff.  Why, because they have been killing and looting<br/>
and I have been RPing.<br/>
