<div id="ygrps-yiv-822684288">I don&#39;t think I agree that a monk with a snaring item is making<br/>
other classes less useful.  Every other class as far as I know has<br/>
some means of stopping a runner.  Monks are the lone exception.<br/>
Whether this is by design or the luck of the draw, or by design as<br/>
you imply, I can&#39;t say.<br/>
<br/>
However, your message seems to be an echo of Verant&#39;s message<br/>
which I simply don&#39;t agree with.  They say they don&#39;t want to infringe on<br/>
certain classes&#39; abilities by offering the same spell/skill to another<br/>
class or in an item (eg clarity).  They do this to encourage grouping so<br/>
that every class has something to offer a group.  However, their design,<br/>
and in fact their statements state that 1 group slot should be reserved for<br/>
enchanters and 1 should be reserved for clerics and another slot should<br/>
be reserved for druids or rangers/wizards.  That is, any group must have<br/>
an enchanter a cleric a snarer and an evacer to have a chance to do<br/>
anything.  That leaves 10-11 classes to go for the other 2-3 slots.  This is<br/>
not much of an encouragement to group since it gets very hard to find<br/>
groups at high levels.  A monk with an item that procs a snare would not<br/>
stop anyone from requiring a class that can actually cast snare to be in a<br/>
group since relying on a procing item to keep runners from leaving is<br/>
risky at best.<br/>
<br/>
Besides, Verant stated that clerics are the only class that is suposed to<br/>
be able to cast exp rezzes, but there is an item that casts it and can be<br/>
used by non-clerics.  Regardless of who is correct, there is precedent 8).<br/>

DD proc&#39;s:  This is pure damage.  Damage is not unbalancing regardless of how it<br/>
is done (DOT or DD).<br/>
        Alternative effects that come with that damage (such as root or snare<br/>
can be unbalancing). More often than not these secondary effects especially root<br/>
and snare can be down right annoying, er go the ebony blade - great ranger<br/>
weapon ruined by the proc.<br/>
<br/>
The case of the rogue clinging darkness proc (is that the serrated bone dirk?) I<br/>
think this is something of a Powerfull advantage rogues have over other melee<br/>
classes.  Perhaps verant allowed it to help the rogue out a little bit (seeing<br/>
as how most of their &quot;skills&quot; are useless).  You would have to agree that that<br/>
clinging darkness line of spells is pretty darn powefull and make a duelweilding<br/>
rogue quite a little damage/utility machine.<br/>
<br/>
I am still of the opinion that giving monks snare would hurt other classes and<br/>
give our class an unbalancing advantage.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the name &quot;treant fists&quot; goes - maybe it can proc a druid DOT or DD<br/>
spell or perhaps a regen or damage shield?<br/>

Under this logic, why would a melee class such as a rogue<br/>
or a warrior get weapons that proc darkness or DoT or even<br/>
DD spells?  We have treant fists.  There must be a reason<br/>
they&#39;re called treant fists.  There are no treants involved in<br/>
the quest!<br/>

Just to clarify:<br/>
&quot; snaring glove or 1h blunt weapon would be an unlikely development.&quot;<br/>
What I meant was a &quot;glove that proced snare&quot; or a &quot;1hb weapon that proced snare&quot;<br/>
would be an unlikely development - regardless of whether they are plane dropped<br/>
or norrath found.  That monk only one hand blunt weapons are coming is something<br/>
I believe I was one of the first to announce on this list and am &quot;reasonably&quot;<br/>
sure that they will be an eventuality (reasonably because until verant puts them<br/>
in the game you NEVER can tell what those guys will do)<br/>
<br/>
Insummary : we agree that 1hblunt weapons are coming.<br/>
            I strongly disagree that snaring weapons (gloves/blunt weapons) will<br/>
ever be useable by any class that does not already have a snare or slowing<br/>
spell: druid ranger shaman etc)<br/>

The orignal person said just for fun what proc would you like to see and of<br/>
course thats what people want.  1hb weapons will be introduced into the game<br/>
of that I have no doubt as Gorden has already said we should practice our<br/>
1hb skills. I also think if and when a glove such as that became avaiable<br/>
just as with the 1hb weapons they will most likely come from the planes.<br/>

&gt; A snaring glove or 1h blunt weapon would be an unlikely development.<br/>
Monks role<br/>
&gt; in a group is to do massive melee damge (reducing the  load on the casters<br/>
mana<br/>
&gt; at high levels).  To give us snare would weaken the ranger/druid role from<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; group some. Snare would be AWSOME, but it would mean we monks become to<br/>
&gt; powerful. able to solo in dungeons and area we were never meant to solo.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; While on the subject of monk items:<br/>
&gt; I have a question for all of you who did the treant fist quest.<br/>
&gt; I have spent about 15hours (total in two marathon sessions) camping for<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; humorous handheld mace off the alchemist in the  Xorb gorge.  I have<br/>
killed the<br/>
&gt; two goblin guards there till I am blue in the face.  Nothing has made that<br/>
&gt; alchemist spawn.  Is there a trick to doing so?  Last night I spent about<br/>
10<br/>
&gt; hours at it (and I picked up the camp from a guy who had been there for 4<br/>
hours<br/>
&gt; before me and had to go to bed)  So if you think about it in 14 hours of<br/>
&gt; non-stop camping he never showed.  Anyone who has done the quest can help<br/>
me out<br/>
&gt; with some advice?   I thought this guy was a 8-10 hour spawn?<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt; Snare would be great.  Stun would be nice too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Perhaps ones that proc some sort of flame-based or force-based DoT.<br/>
&quot;target<br/>
&gt; is slammed by an intense force&quot; or something like that.  Think of it as<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; monk focussing his ki into an attack.<br/>

&gt; &gt; for fun, what would you want something to proc? personally, I really<br/>
wish<br/>
&gt; &gt; I had a good mid lvl set of gloves that proced snare.  most usefull<br/>
spell<br/>
&gt; &gt; in the game imho.  then I could solo in dungeons that most people dont<br/>
go<br/>
&gt; &gt; into..upper guk, runnyeye, sola..etc.<br/>
