<b>Subject:</b> NUNCHUCKS! COOL!!!!!! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1666581586">yes!  why, oh why didnt we think  of this before?<br/>
OOOOOOOOH!<br/>
<br/>
Ok ok, stay calm....<br/>
we gotta make a petition!<br/>
NOt one of those whining petitions begging variant to make our class<br/>
stronger, but a petition asking to get out class some more items and<br/>
attention.  All the suggestions I have read so far are cool! And I think<br/>
they would go along way to improving the game in a meaningfull way.<br/>
<br/>
Ideas for nun-chucks:<br/>
<br/>
They should use the hand to hand skill<br/>
Monk only<br/>
There should be 3 levels of nunchucks:<br/>
<br/>
A high level variant would be 7dmg/16 delay proc dooming darkness level<br/>
34 necro spell? (correct me if I am wrong) <br/>
<br/>
Obtainablity:<br/>
Obtainable through a level 40+<br/>
multi group effort similar to the Soulfire or flesh ripper type require<br/>
ments.  I would locate this weapon somehwere in LOWER GUK or SOL B.<br/>
<br/>
Balance issues:<br/>
Bear in mind that with 7 base damge a level 40 will only hit for 21-25<br/>
max damage with these nunchucks vs 35+ with his fists, the DOT makes up<br/>
for the loss in damage, and I think that the 16 delay is faster than our<br/>
fists?)<br/>
<br/>
_________________<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Mid level version should do 6dmg/17delay and proc stun<br/>
<br/>
Obtainability:<br/>
Obtainable in a single level 30+ group.<br/>
Locate this in some dungeon but at a reasonably accessible place in a<br/>
level 35 critter? the depths of UPPER GUK or SOL A, or the front part of<br/>
LOWER GUKS LIVE SIDE or SOL B are candidates, As Is NAJENA)<br/>
<br/>
Balance:<br/>
Stun is such a cool spell. <br/>
It is a great way to taunt a creature, and it saves SO much damage <br/>
- at leve 30 mobs hit for around 70+ a pop and they double attack often!<br/>
Stun is just want a monk needs to help keep stuff off his groups casters<br/>
and to save himself a good 140 to 420 points of damge!  Nothing to sneeze<br/>
at.<br/>
At level 30 you will hitting for 18 a pop with this weapon vs 30+ with<br/>
your fists. but the delay is faster i think.  I say again anyone know the<br/>
delay on our fists?<br/>
<br/>
_____________________<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Low level variant should do 6 damge/20 delay and proc root?<br/>
<br/>
Obtainability:<br/>
Good level 15+ group<br/>
 Locate it in a dungeon like Crushbone or Befallen<br/>
<br/>
Balance issues: <br/>
At level 15 a monk will probably be better off using his fists<br/>
 except for the nifty root that these weapons cast, allowing him to tackle<br/>
creatures in dungeons. This weapon is not meant to be a be all or end all.<br/>
Just a nifty looking addition to the players wardrobe.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What do you guys think?  what is the effect delay on our fist punches<br/>
anyone know?<br/>

&gt; &gt; A monk only weapon, now before someone say but out fists are our weapons<br/>
&gt; &gt; listen for a sec.  Wouldn&#39;t it be cool if there were magic gloves with<br/>
&gt; &gt; effects?  I personally would love to wield a pair of gloves that cast an<br/>
&gt; &gt; effect, like life tap or shock of frost.  There are just not enough Monk<br/>
&gt; &gt; only stuff out there, other then the PoF stuff and the sashes and head bands<br/>
&gt; &gt; I think this would be a nice addition, maybe along with a nifty looking robe<br/>
&gt; &gt; for monks.<br/>
