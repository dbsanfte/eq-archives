<div id="ygrps-yiv-102709500">I have done the Hero Bracer quest.<br/>
Go to Halas, and speak to one of the warriors in the warrior guild. The<br/>
woman I think. She will ask you to bring back some gnoll teeth from<br/>
BlackBurrow (no drop, but stackable). Then, after a lot of teeth, she will<br/>
ask you for some necklaces from ice gobs in Everfrost (was paying 2pp per<br/>
mecklaces, it was a kind of mini quest for newbies :o)). Then you can go<br/>
back to Qeynos and speak to another woman warrior in the Arena. She will ask<br/>
to bring some kobold hide from Toxulia Forest. You can also kill the catman<br/>
in Erud&#39;s Crossing for the key #17 that you have to bring back to the<br/>
warrior who gives the hero bracer quest, and don&#39;t forget to kill some<br/>
zombies there too because you can loot a tattered map that is a quest for<br/>
the same woman warrior in Qeynos (you need a good faction with her first,<br/>
with the kobold hide quest). These quests will all give you faction with<br/>
Steel Warriors.<br/>
You need to be high amiably with them. Took me many Dorn&#39;s death (til no<br/>
more faction hit, I have killed him my whole life for revenge each time I<br/>
was passing by :o)), 100 teeth from BB, 48 necklaces, 24 kobold hide, a key<br/>
#17 and a tattered map !!! 2 day work.<br/>
