<div id="ygrps-yiv-807305324">it has worked rather well against everything I&#39;ve fought (and hid from) so<br/>
far (lvl 20).<br/>
griffawns, reavers, broon, giants, spectors, crocks, dbskells, dervs,<br/>
craig spiders (damn I&#39;ve gotten a lot use out of fd)<br/>
<br/>
so far, most creatures will run back to you when you get up.  I think mobs<br/>
in dungeons have a higher percentage chance of not returning (hence the fd<br/>
pull).<br/>
<br/>
tips for using it:<br/>
1) wait till after your hit.  do hit fd right when a mob is swinging, if<br/>
they hit you, they will see past fd.<br/>
2) wait till after a caster blasts you (same reason)<br/>
3) turn off auto attack for a few seconds (so you dont hit them) before<br/>
you hit fd<br/>
4) (I think I&#39;m the only one to do  this)  jump away from the mob right<br/>
before you hit fd.  got to time it right.  this way, you are out of range,<br/>
and so are they.<br/>
<br/>
when I first got it, it saved my life onece, then killed me. I was trying<br/>
it out on an orc warrior in oasis.  I fd, then got right back up, he<br/>
aggroed on me. I fd&#39;ed  again, and waited for him to walk off.  thought<br/>
that was neat.  the warrior walked off in the direction of a dbskell.  the<br/>
dbskell attacked, and the orc came running back to me (with the skell).<br/>
the skell killed the orc, then killed me :).  after that, I decided to put<br/>
most of my points into it to get it to a somewhat usable level (got it to<br/>
about 65 I think).<br/>

&gt; I just got the skill, and used all my practices to max it. Now i was <br/>
&gt; wondering if anyone has any tips as hhow to make it work more reliably, and a <br/>
&gt; list of the types of (or individual) mobs that can see through it.<br/>
