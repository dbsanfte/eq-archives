<b>Subject:</b> Monk Tinking <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1776323545">Only thing twinking does to me ( I assume other too) Make the game boring<br/>
and soon forgotten.<br/>
<br/>
I found that if I use cheat codes or twink I soon loose interest in the<br/>
chalange of the moment.<br/>
<br/>
For the same reason I dislike begger and those who consitly ask for a hand<br/>
out.<br/>
<br/>
Life is a hard life for a monk, give thanks for the things that pass by your<br/>
way. To level with ggreat speed, is that hurting you more then not?<br/>
<br/>
 The qustion is, If a person Speed Levels( very quick EXPS) will his skills<br/>
keep up, or will they lag behind?<br/>
<br/>
I had a monk who whent to level 4 very quicky and only had H2H of 6 and Kick<br/>
of 7, Was that just me or does speed kill?<br/>
<br/>
Towshee of the many servers</div>
