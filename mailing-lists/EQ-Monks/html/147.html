&gt; unfortunately, yes, this is supposed to happen. Supposedly there is a radius<br/>
&gt; of aggression which, once the critter has passed it, it will not return, but<br/>
&gt; I have never had a monster forget about me. The funniest was running from a<br/>
&gt; brigand in the Karanas (West I think it was). I FD (was on a corpse<br/>
&gt; retreival run and in no mood to fight this thing), wait, run, FD, wait,<br/>
&gt; run... repeat all the way to North Karanas Zone. I was laughing so hard I<br/>
&gt; cant believe the dumb brigand didn&#39;t know I was alive!  =D<br/>

Which reminds me, you can use this to good effect, if you have courage<br/>
and trusts in your FD. Once, when going thu West Commons, I spotted<br/>
the Werewolf. Knowing it was too hard to handle for me alone, and that<br/>
once people are aware of its precence, they come killing it ASAP, I<br/>
lured it to the wall, waited untill it were close to me, feigned<br/>
death, and called my highlevel friends. While waiting for them to come<br/>
(as they REALLY wanted to kill the WW), I stood several times, to keep<br/>
it close by, and away from the more populated areas of the zone. Every<br/>
time I stood, it would come running back, and I would feign. Think I<br/>
did this 7 or 8 times, untill my friends came to take care of it. =)<br/>
I failed once, but running back and forth a few times, waiting for FD<br/>
to come back were no problem.<br/>
<br/>
Conclution, FD can be used to &#39;hold on&#39; to the occational Rare Spawn<br/>
untill the cavalry arrives. =)<br/>
