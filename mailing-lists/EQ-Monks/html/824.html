&gt;&gt;Ever wonder why parties always want a monk to pull? Because the Monk IS the<br/>
&gt;&gt;best puler in the game Bar none.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;         Once again, I am going to have to disagree. The Monk is the 2nd <br/>
&gt; best puller in the game. The best puller is one that no one has mentioned <br/>
&gt; yet: The Bard. The reason the Bard is the best puller is because of <br/>
&gt; Kelin`s Lugubrious Lament (Lull), Kelin`s Lucid Lullaby (AoE Lull), and <br/>
&gt; Selo&#39;s Accelerando. Bards can use the spells to pull EXACTLY one Mob and <br/>
&gt; then hightail it back to the group. If they do pull more they can use <br/>
&gt; Kelin&#39;s Lullaby to keep them occupied or just haul ass to zone. All in <br/>
&gt; all, if you have a Bard that knows what he is doing, they are the best pullers.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;         However, that all said and done, most Bards are not as adept at <br/>
&gt; pulling as Monks are. Monks start honing their pulling skills early on. <br/>
&gt; Bards, for the most part, never really work on pulling. So, given the <br/>
&gt; same skill level and knowledge, a Bard is a better class for pulling. I <br/>
&gt; still like a Monk because of the damage they deal. Bard songs are <br/>
&gt; invaluable at higher levels though. I would choose a Bard (that knows <br/>
&gt; what they are doing) over a Shaman/Druid/Paladin/Ranger if possible.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well i actually run a bard as my primary char, and while most of this is <br/>
true, i think monks<br/>
get the edge on bards because of the loss of selos in an indoor dungeon <br/>
(i.e. most of the<br/>
good hi level ones).  While there are many people in unrest who think I am <br/>
the best puller<br/>
they have ever seen, I find myself somewhat limited in places like guk, <br/>
simply because i<br/>
don&#39;t know the layout that well, so I can&#39;t really compare pulling there to <br/>
pulling in unrest.<br/>
