<div id="ygrps-yiv-1561242594">I&#39;m a fp monk who recently went to qeynos and back (to get my white-orange<br/>
sash, and to travel the world some).  I thought when I smacked the gnolls<br/>
in bb, that it gave faction to the fp monk guild. I know they gave me<br/>
faction to the silent fist clan.<br/>
<br/>
one question.  for the red headband, I know you need 3 heads from paw.<br/>
but when I asked about the red headband, all the guy said was to find<br/>
brother someone, and bring them back to the guild (not tomer, did that).<br/>
am I supposed to talk to someone and find out that that guy is dead, then<br/>
get a new quest?<br/>

&gt; Actually, I&#39;m a monk from Qeynos and recently (two days ago) was able to<br/>
&gt; get the white sash (and then the yellow one) from the Freeport monks.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The last time I checked, the Tomer and Konem quests did give Ashen Order<br/>
&gt; faction (about a week ago at least). I don&#39;t know if they change that in<br/>
&gt; the last patch or not...<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;When a monk from Qeynos tries to start the Sash Quests of Freeport, he<br/>
&gt; runs into difficulty. The Qeynos monk&#39;s faction with them is usually too<br/>
&gt; low to allow him to begin the quests. There are several quests in Qeynos<br/>
&gt; that will allow a Freeport monk to increase their faction with the Silent<br/>
&gt; Fist, but no such quests (that I&#39;m aware of) in Freeport to increase<br/>
&gt; faction with the Ashen Order.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Workarounds for this have been the subject of much debate. Many solutions<br/>
&gt; have been presented, however, it looks like Verant has &quot;fixed&quot; them all.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m going to list all the ones that don&#39;t work now, so that any starting<br/>
&gt; monks won&#39;t fall into these traps...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;1) Create a Freeport monk and get his guild note to turn in for instant<br/>
&gt; faction.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Problem: The guild notes are now Lore items, and so are no-drop, no-trade.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;2) Do the Tomer and/or Konem Quests in Qeynos.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Problem: The only faction you increase with these now is with the Silent<br/>
&gt; Fist, the Ashen Order does NOT show up anymore.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;3) Get a Freeport monk to give you their White Sash, and then carry on<br/>
&gt; from there.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Problem: If you try to get the next sash by turning in your current sash<br/>
&gt; (gotten from the Freeport monk) and the items, you lose all the items and<br/>
&gt; the sash. The Ashen Guild member will give you a message like &quot;I will not<br/>
&gt; help beings of your kind&quot;. This is especially vexing if you had a Freeport<br/>
&gt; monk to give you the Orange sash, and tried to turn it in for the Red sash.<br/>
&gt; The Red sash items are a little hard to come by, and having them go up in<br/>
&gt; smoke would be frustrating.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;In conclusion, it looks like the only way to truly do the quests now is to<br/>
&gt; build your faction with the Freeport monks in some way. I have been<br/>
&gt; noticing that they HAVE been starting to like me more, but, I am unsure as<br/>
&gt; to why. I believe it is because I&#39;ve been killed so many orcs lately. If<br/>
&gt; anyone has any ideas, they would be welcome.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;The only possible workaround I see now, is to give the items for the later<br/>
&gt; quests to a Freeport monk (one you create or another player) and have them<br/>
&gt; give you the resulting sash. However, I think the later sashes are no-drop,<br/>
&gt; no-trade, unlike the beginning sashes, which are Lore items, but can be<br/>
&gt; traded.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Finally, the point of the Monk headbands/sashes is not that they are<br/>
&gt; terribly powerful magical items, but that it&#39;s fun and challenging for a<br/>
&gt; monk to complete a quest that is not really available to many other people.<br/>
&gt; Sure there are lots of items that are better, but it&#39;s a nice part of you<br/>
&gt; character when you can say that you are a Purple Headband, Purple Sash<br/>
&gt; holder ;-)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;(If I&#39;ve made any glaring errors/omissions, I apologize, and would expect<br/>
&gt; that I will be corrected asap &lt;grin&gt;)<br/>
