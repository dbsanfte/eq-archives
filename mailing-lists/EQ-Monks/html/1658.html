quests.. unfortunately... that means more orcs, or more deathfist belts.&nbsp; 
(I would choose orcs, no negative faction.)<br>I feel your pain, I&#39;m doing the 
same thing.</font></div>

  <div><font face="Arial" size="2">Hi !<br>I have done at the weekend the Freeport 
  faction. Now i can move nearly safely trough all Freeport. Sure i have to 
  avoid the caster guild and the paladins LOL</font></div>
  <div>&nbsp;</div>
  <div><font face="Arial" size="2">But now i have a problem. I am dubious to the 
  Ashen Order (the Monks) and when sneaking indiff. I collected 60 times the 
  stuff for the white sash quest to increase faction with them, so that i can 
  train mz skills in Freeport too.<br>I got wolfform from a friend and was 
  indiff to them (no increasing when sneaking) and handed two deathfist scalps, 
  one bone chip and one snake fang (the scalps not stacked) and all i recieve as 
  answer was <br>&quot;i will not support anything like you&quot; (or something like that, 
  cant remeber exact)<br>How can i increase mz faction with them instead of 
  camping more and more orcs. I have read it should work with wolfform and the 
  white sash quest.<br>If you could please help me or give me some advice i 
  would really appreciate that</font></div>
