<div id="ygrps-yiv-925790746">I was able to split mobs once they were out of line of sight last night.  I<br/>
was in Cazic, just chatting with some friends and messing around, and they<br/>
asked me to pull a bit before I went off to bed.  They had a new guy with<br/>
them who had never heard of feign pulling and they wanted me to show him.<br/>
Nothing difficult, mind you, as it was mostly a demonstration.  I never<br/>
pulled anything tougher than Fanatic/Zealots/etc, but I had no trouble<br/>
spliting them once they got out of line of sight.<br/>

&gt; Sorry to disagree with you but the flame goblins I let go <br/>
&gt; back to thier<br/>
&gt; spots were in no way in line of sight and neither were the <br/>
&gt; Dar froggies my<br/>
&gt; friend experimented with. </span></blockquote></div>
