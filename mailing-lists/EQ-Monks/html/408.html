<div id="ygrps-yiv-158725180">Ok I assume you started in the city of freeport<br/>
<br/>
First you need to get your white training sash.  Level<br/>
2 and 3 is the ideal time to get it.  If you haven&#39;t<br/>
gotten it yet I won&#39;t ruin your first quest so you<br/>
will have to figure it out for yourself<br/>
<br/>
By the time I was level five I pretty much had a full<br/>
set of cloth armor.  Cloth is good for your level<br/>
because it is light and fairly cheap, you can buy it<br/>
in the Freeport Market, the shops near the bank.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t need to worry much about items until level<br/>
4or5, then I would start heading out.  I would go to<br/>
through east freeport to the desert of ro and fight<br/>
near the inn.  You won&#39;t have to worry about being<br/>
killed by madmen there and there is a good spawn of<br/>
beetle&#39;s and armadillos.   Once you get to 7 you can<br/>
start killing orcs and snakes and stuff<br/>
