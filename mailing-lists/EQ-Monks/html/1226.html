<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-975984296">Raean Bloodyhands asked about 1-handed blunt weapons that are light enough for<br/>
a monk to use.<br/>
<br/>
Check here:<br/>

<br/>
and go to the &quot;Weapons&quot; section on the right hand side. Here is a<br/>
comprehensive list of weapons that Monks can use.<br/>
<br/>
Most of them are heavy, being around 3 weight. But the Humerous Handled mace<br/>
is light (although once you get it, most likely you&#39;ll want to trade it in for<br/>
the Treeant fists), and probably the best one is the Sharkbone WarHammer.<br/>
