<div id="ygrps-yiv-808766491">Hey, I am a newbie at the monk thing. I was wondering if someone can help me out with what armour is the best to try and get.  I am level 6 and have Netted Gloves and the rest is Leather.  I hear about netted, woven and mesh.  Can someone provide some info on where i can get them? And whats a decent price to pay players for any of these?<br/>
<br/>
