Don&#39;t read if you want to figure this stuff out yourself.  = )<br/>

Well, I assume you are talking about the entrance to the bat area in Sol B.  <br/>
That room has two bats, but I&#39;ve never seen them pulled and no one I know <br/>
knows how to pull them (AE spell?  Bard&#39;s Chords of Dissonance?).    They <br/>
never assist either.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, from that room you have two directions you can take (aside from the one <br/>
you came in).<br/>
<br/>
Left heads to a room with two bats that ARE stacked so it might look like <br/>
one.  Both exits from that room lead to beetles and spiders, so if you are <br/>
just pulling bats, stop there.<br/>
<br/>
Right goes to a room with 2 bats (non-stacked).  Easy to split, but I <br/>
usually lose patience and just pull both.  = )   Past that room there are <br/>
one or two bats that spawn in a hall going down (it varies).   Past THAT <br/>
point comes to a hallway with lava on one side.<br/>
<br/>
This area gets a bit tricky.  There is one bat to your right, but it&#39;s <br/>
across the lava and you&#39;ll need a shuriken or have it aggro you to pull it, <br/>
BUT it will sometimes bring one to four other bats with it due to weird <br/>
pathing (feign death m&#39;boy).<br/>
<br/>
Further down the lava hall is a spot where two bats spawn on the right <br/>
across the lava again (they are stacked).  Near them in the corridor is a <br/>
spot where one or two roaming bats like to pace.   These last three or four <br/>
bats can be pretty close, so the pull can get messy quick.<br/>
<br/>
At the end of the lava hall, the corridor turns sharply to the left and up.  <br/>
One bat spawns up there.  The one or two of the roamers sometimes hang out <br/>
here.  The corridor past that point leads to a room of beetles.  Three or <br/>
four beetles can be found here, including the death beetle, but they are on <br/>
ledges, so it&#39;s possible to just get one or two.  One or two of the roaming <br/>
bats hang out there sometimes.  One of this rooms three exits leads back to <br/>
the first bat room I talked about, the other to the imp area that is the <br/>
start of the Efreeti Lord area.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun, and get your magic resist buffed.   = )<br/>

&gt;Yeah, my buddy Larn left me in the dust for level. Damn him!!!!! Its ok, <br/>
&gt;now<br/>
&gt;I get to the be the resident puller of SOL B for the groups camping <br/>
&gt;assorted<br/>
&gt;areas. I am getting to learn Sol B quite well now, quick question though,<br/>
&gt;the start of the room with the sonic bats hovering, is there only one or <br/>
&gt;are<br/>
&gt;they stacked upon on another so as you can not see them all or what? I <br/>
&gt;don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;want a nasty surprise if I try to pull these to my group.<br/>
