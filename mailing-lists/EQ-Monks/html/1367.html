&lt;&lt; To tell you the truth, I think it&#39;s kinda a stupid arguement, there really <br/>
 isn&#39;t much you can do about it, you can either play everquest and put up <br/>
 with it, or don&#39;t play everquest and not have to worry about it &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No, that statement could be altered a bit...<br/>
You can either play Everquest and put up with twinking, or you can play PVP <br/>
servers and have fun with it :)</div>
