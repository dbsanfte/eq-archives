<div id="ygrps-yiv-1087491269">The only time I ever really lost stamina when fighting was in Kedge<br/>
Keep.  When fighting Vox I noted a bunch of tanks shouting for invigor,<br/>
but my stamina bar was still pretty much full.  I also think it is CHA that<br/>
affects our susceptibility to charm spells.<br/>

I thought I would provide a litttle summary on all the stats that are important<br/>
to monks and why they are important:<br/>
<br/>
In order of importance:<br/>
<br/>
1) STR thisaffects damage on both fists and Flying Kick<br/>
<br/>
2) AGI this affects our ac and Mitigates (reduces) damage when we are hit<br/>
<br/>
3) STA this allows us to keep fighting without getting fatigued  (important at<br/>
high levels when fights last long and DW/DA go off more often) and adds<br/>
hitpoints.<br/>
<br/>
4) Int/Wisdom  these reduce our suceptability to CHARMING and Messmerizing<br/>
spells that some high level critters cast, and increase our learning rate.  Good<br/>
to have for trade skills.<br/>
<br/>
5) CHA prices you get at vendor.<br/>
<br/>
NOTE: DEX this is UNIMPORTANT and does nothing except increase our LEARNING rate<br/>
of the melee skills.</div>
