Okay, I won&#39;t stoop to your level of insulting, but I will defend myself.<br/>
No, it wouldn&#39;t slow things down to &quot;just add different color headbands&quot; as<br/>
you seem to think that&#39;s the only thing that is wanted to be changed.  I&#39;m<br/>
talking on a broad level here, not just one or two things.  Can you guess<br/>
what would happen if the monks got their way and got several different color<br/>
variations on &quot;a simple stripe on a head?&quot;  Every other group would come<br/>
screaming to Verant about they need a little change here and a little change<br/>
there.  That&#39;s when it would become a problem with texture memory and<br/>
everything else I wrote about.  When EVERYONE gets little changes, and<br/>
leather armor is in 47 different colors, and all the rest of the changes<br/>
that are being asked for constantly to make for some more differentiation<br/>
amongst the players.  I haven&#39;t misquoted anything, because I didn&#39;t quote<br/>
anything in my response.  Perhaps you should reread my letter and think<br/>
about it a little before you go off like this.  I do happen to THINK a lot<br/>
just like you say I don&#39;t, and I was making a point about changing the<br/>
system as a whole, not just one little headband.  Please grow up next time<br/>
before you decide to rant and rave about a post that you don&#39;t seem to<br/>
understand what&#39;s being talked about within it&#39;s context.  Thanks much<br/>
<br/>
Randy<br/>

&gt; Holy smokes WAKE UP AND SMELL THE JAVA!!!! Im a little tired of reading<br/>
&gt; these posts that the headband animation or sash cant be added because the<br/>
&gt; &quot;2mb buffer over flow tri linera mip mapped anti aliased Voodoo 1 yad yada<br/>
&gt; yada&quot; machines will slow down and cant handle it. If you believe that then<br/>
&gt; call me quick cause I got a whole lot of pure grade a sunshine in a bottle<br/>
&gt; to sell ya. THINK! We are not asking for entirely new animations of<br/>
dragons<br/>
&gt; or flying vehicles or backflips out of dangeers way. All we are asking for<br/>
&gt; is a nice yellow, blue, ornage, red, pink, muave, sandle whatever colored<br/>
&gt; strip on my head! For christ sakes barbarians get 19 different helmets<br/>
with<br/>
&gt; all sorts of funky horns and yet if you put a simple colored stripe on my<br/>
&gt; head or waist the graphics engine cant handle it and the game will come to<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; screaching halt? Please stop the non sense! I have a feeling the<br/>
developers<br/>
&gt; are being misquoted here on this thread and their comments are in<br/>
reference<br/>
&gt; to other much larger issues within the game and not a simple stripe on a<br/>
&gt; head.<br/>
