<div id="ygrps-yiv-2080126688">First off, let me say this list is great, and very informative.<br/>
<br/>
I guess my best course of action at level 15 is to simply buy the best stat<br/>
enhancing stuff I can as it comes available. Bottom line is to increase<br/>
your stats as much as possible.<br/>
<br/>
Which brings me to another question... when will I be able to afford this<br/>
stuff? At what level do we start being able to get the big kills that earn<br/>
us hundreds of plat? It&#39;s only recently that I&#39;ve been able to start having<br/>
about 50pp in the bank at any time, and paying 35pp for a +5 AGI ring was a<br/>
major investment for me. My main cash cow has been wisp hunting, but the<br/>
experience I get killing them has started to diminish a lot. Killing Dervs<br/>
is still okay, but doesn&#39;t get me much cash unless they have bronze.<br/>
<br/>
I love not having to buy expensive armor and weapons all the time, but it&#39;s<br/>
getting to the point where I will need lots of cash to buy jewelry, rare<br/>
items, etc.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, how much should one pay for serpentine bracers?<br/>
<br/>
And at what level can I realistically hope to get journeyman&#39;s boots?<br/>
