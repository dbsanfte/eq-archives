<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-347275782">Well.. I had the unfortunate opportunity to do a little more experimentation<br/>
with FD last night, and have come to a couple conclusions. Perhaps someone<br/>
out there can add to or refute my findings. Either way would be great!<br/>
<br/>
I believe that there are 2 conditions (aside from the &quot;in the middle of<br/>
attacking/casting&quot; conditions). The first is the level of the MoB being<br/>
feigned against. A high level MoB (by that I mean one that con&#39;s red) has a<br/>
good chance of seeing thru a successful FD. I say this due to my *insert<br/>
foul language here* death against Droon. We had just killed Broon and were<br/>
heading for the Zone with Droon hot on our tails. He caught up with our<br/>
enchanter, so I doubled back to get his attention on me while the others<br/>
kept going. I got his attention, he started hitting me. We had already<br/>
worked out that if this should happen, the Wizard would cast, pulling Droons<br/>
focus, and I would FD, and then he would zone. Worked like a charm. Droon<br/>
turned to go after the Wiz, I FD successfully (no message), the Wiz zones,<br/>
Droon comes back and kills me while I am still FD&#39;d. It is my assumption<br/>
that he was not fooled due to the fact that he is Red... or perhaps because<br/>
of my 2nd condition (which I actually find less likely in this case) which<br/>
is an INT check vs. FD skill. I have noticed that MoBs I would consider<br/>
sentient (i.e.. creatures that have formed a type of society such as Aviaks<br/>
or Frogluks) are the ones that continually either return or I have failures<br/>
against.<br/>
<br/>
Just for your info, I am 20th with all skills except weapons, kick, and<br/>
round kick maxed.<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts on this? It is really starting to bug me that the last 2 times<br/>
I have tried FD, I have been killed by non-casting MoB&#39;s after a successful<br/>
FD. The only saving grace is that at least the rest of my party was able to<br/>
escape both times.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here is my expierence, FD only works if the mobs have completely finished<br/>
&gt; all <br/>
&gt; their actions for the round. If you FD and one still has yet to hit you or<br/>
&gt; a <br/>
&gt; spell still has to go off against you it does not matter, it will fail. I<br/>
&gt; do <br/>
&gt; not know about against DoT and that is an interesting question. I do know<br/>
&gt; I <br/>
&gt; have fought the spiders in Guk several times and Feigned successfelly<br/>
&gt; while <br/>
&gt; poisoned. And rabies have never seemed to be a problem. I also like the<br/>
&gt; range <br/>
&gt; of aggression type suggestion as in my expierences this has proven to be <br/>
&gt; true. In Guk I have almost always had the stupid frogs come running after<br/>
&gt; me <br/>
&gt; when I had Feigned, the spiders on the other hand depend how far away from<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; them I am. Even if I am just over into the next chamber they do not<br/>
&gt; pursue. <br/>
&gt; The same in Unrest, Dark Boned Skels to my great surprise did not come<br/>
&gt; after <br/>
&gt; me when I got up from a feign, but you can imagine my surprise when the <br/>
&gt; Barbed Skel did not ignore me and came back and whoopped my rear. Well,<br/>
&gt; this <br/>
&gt; is my thoughts on it. I still do not think it is the awesome skill I had <br/>
&gt; heard of before getting it. I would much prefer to have something that<br/>
&gt; would <br/>
&gt; help the rest of the party a little more and not be so much of a simple <br/>
&gt; self-preservation thing. I know the responses about leading mobs away and<br/>
&gt; I <br/>
&gt; have done this, but still those situations are pretty rare. Usually it<br/>
&gt; ends <br/>
&gt; out with the call for run going out and me just hitting feign when<br/>
&gt; everyone <br/>
&gt; has minimal time to head out the nearest door before I die. As I am only<br/>
&gt; 20th <br/>
&gt; level I always looked forward to the views of more expierenced players. <br/>
