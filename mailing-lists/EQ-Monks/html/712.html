<div id="ygrps-yiv-891049762"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; P.S. 500p is a reasonable amount to have SAVED up by level 18, but making<br/>
&gt; 500p IN ONE DAY at level 19 is amazing, he may not wnat to give away his<br/>
&gt; secret, but what ever he is doing to make that kind of money I would like <br/>
&gt; to know... <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>its no secret. verant had created a rather true economy.  instead of<br/>
practicing my skills in pottery, I&#39;ve practiced it in commerce.<br/>
<br/>
Capitolism is alive and well on the servers.<br/>
<br/>
granted, I had a great day yesterday, and my initial investment certanly<br/>
needed to be taken out of the 500pp I made.  and I sold stuff that I have<br/>
had sitting in inventory for a while.<br/>
<br/>
just another example of another way to play the game (that I&#39;m sure some<br/>
poeple will tell me I&#39;m wrong for)<br/>
<br/>
*monk specific part*<br/>
I find that monks make good traders.  When I&#39;m traveling, I dont worry<br/>
about the weight restrictions, and I usually dont fight, just feign.  Gets<br/>
me where I want to go.</div>
