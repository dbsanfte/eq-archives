The philosophies on supernatural aid for innate abilities are great and<br/>
varied,<br/>
but consider these few notions when deciding: Each enhancement works to serve<br/>
the same purpose, whether you chose to perform more agile feats of<br/>
avoidance or<br/>
dexterous techniques of attack, your only goal is to apply damage to your foe<br/>
more often and more rapidly than your enemy can harm you. Magical improvements<br/>
in either of these skills will work to your advantage for those goals. You and<br/>
I are quite nearly equals in study, so I imagine, like myself, you live a<br/>
humble and meek existence. Such jewels as those that will greatly improve us,<br/>
are often prohibitive in cost, and you will find that light weight pieces of<br/>
armor may afford you greater resistance to harm.  Through negotiations with<br/>
our<br/>
brothers and sisters of the Ashen Order, I have acquired a great many<br/>
pieces of<br/>
mesh fortification, and find that they provide me with the greatest benefit<br/>
while in battle. As we both mature in our adventures, I am certain that those<br/>
magically crafted jewels that will offer a noticeable improvement of our<br/>
innate<br/>
abilities will be easier to acquire. In them, we will then find our perfect<br/>
balance.<br/>
