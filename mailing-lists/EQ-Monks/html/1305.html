<div id="ygrps-yiv-1555430764">Hey to the Level 13 Monk who caused quite a stir on the message board you can make quite a lot of money at your level. Head out to the West Commonlands and hunt Willowisps (you can do this in the East Commons but there are more in the West). Between level 12 and 14 is prpobably the best time to do this. At this point you can solo them without to much difficulty and still get good XP. Occasionally these willowisps drop normal and greater lightstones. The normal&#39;s sell for about 1pp and the greater lightstones for 5-6pp. By using this method I saved up enough for a full set of cured silk, 2 +3 str earrings (Golden Amber), 2 +3 str rings (Jagged Bands). If you put in a good 3-4 hours you can make upto 50pp a day. You can do this till about lvl 15 but then they don&#39;t give such good XP anymore, but you can still do it for money.</div>
