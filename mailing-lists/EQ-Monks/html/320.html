<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-783970188">O.K., my main thing is that I dont care how I get the sashes as long as I <br/>
earn them! So if i can have a free monk turn the stuff in thats fine with <br/>
me, ill have my friend create a free monk to turn the stuff in and get me <br/>
the sash but is there a level restriction?<br/>
Say i get all the things needed for the orange or red sashes and give them <br/>
to my friend, will they still give him the stuff or say no he&#39;s too low <br/>
level being first and i lose all the gear etc...? If thats the case Ill have <br/>
to &quot;hire&quot; a monk in the game which could be a risky deal even if they had <br/>
the sash in question.</div>
