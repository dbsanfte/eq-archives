<div id="ygrps-yiv-701325055">I had read awhile back that the going price for Mesh runs around 3p per AC, negotiable down to 2p.  Mesh Gloves average for around 20p to start, but usually not less then 15p.  I guess it all really depends on how much you are willing to pay.<br/>
<br/>
I think I had paid 10p for 2 bracers and 10p for a mesh tunic.  That was before I managed to get a full suit in Guk myself.  Mesh gloves and cloaks are rare, but still attainable.  <br/>
<br/>
Having a Mesh wardrobe in the bank is great for shifting armor around to try and find the best combination of items.  As you level up, you will be presented with many options.  A mix of armor depends on what you have.<br/>
<br/>
For comparison, I&#39;m at 7 pounds if I have no coin in pocket and 20 baked foods & 20 milks(in weight reducing pack)/20 stars .<br/>

&gt;    Monks armor can be tricky as any point over 14 in weight will lower &gt;our armor class. Right now I would start saving your coins as for you it &gt;will be easy as seeing that you are a monk you really have nothing to &gt;spend your money on. Around 10th level I would look to make the trek &gt;down to Guk and hang out in the front area of the dungeon. Keep your &gt;eyes peeled for Woven or Mesh armor these are monk staples. If you can &gt;afford the Mesh go for it and besides you really aren&#39;t going to have &gt;anything to spend you coin on for awhile. If you can get an LJ tunic in &gt;Oasis pick one up but this will be based on the amount of money you have &gt;and you really will not be very effective in that zone till around level &gt;12 or so. But start with getting some Woven or mesh...One thing you can &gt;look into is getting in some Wisp hunting parties and putting those &gt;netted gloves to use. Also if you are in Qeynos hit the Aqueducts and &gt;get a full suit of netted. Not all that great for armor but it is light &gt;and will allow you to carry more other stuff that will make you the coin &gt;needed to buy mesh or woven. Mesh being the better of all three.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hope this all helped.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Hey, I am a newbie at the monk thing. I was wondering if someone can &gt;help me out with what armour is the best to try and get.  I am level 6 &gt;and have Netted Gloves and the rest is Leather.  I hear about netted, &gt;woven and mesh.  Can someone provide some info on where i can get them? &gt;And whats a decent price to pay players for any of these?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   <br/>
&gt;  k Thx<br/>
