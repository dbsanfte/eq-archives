<div id="ygrps-yiv-1904253712">First post to this list, woo.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m 11th lvl on the Prexus server, and just recently obtained woven gloves.<br/>
Since I can now actually hit them, I&#39;ve been searching for wisps in E<br/>
Commonlands and finding maybe one per hour of real time (!). Now, I know<br/>
it&#39;s a busy zone and that their heavily hunted there -- is there perhaps a<br/>
better place to find them? I&#39;ve been avoiding W Commons due to the<br/>
likelihood of being crushed by hill giants and/or smacked around by the<br/>
griffs, not to mention double-teamed by young kodiaks...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,<br/>
<br/>
