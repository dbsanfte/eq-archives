<div id="ygrps-yiv-1442910358">I&#39;ve noticed this as well.  Black Burrows once had range of 60 to 80<br/>
players, and a high well over 100.  Now it rarely has more than 40.  Low<br/>
twenties is common.  <br/>
<br/>
With a high number of players on a server, no new players will start there<br/>
(maybe some).  Even with the slowest leveling players, the average character<br/>
level will rise.  This is also having a tremendous impact on the economies.<br/>
Items like shiny brass halberds, although great below level 20, are almost<br/>
mediocre at higher levels, so the prices are dropping.<br/>

i have noticed at least on my server....alot of the 25th level and below<br/>
dungeons are emptying out.  It&#39;s seems the average age on my server is now<br/>
35 or so.<br/>

p.s. i started tooling around the lower level dungeons with my 38th<br/>
druid....getting stuff for my guild.  BB was practically empty...noone was<br/>
attacking the elites for their items.  Walking all around PAW with no<br/>
problem and I even walked into Befallen and nothing was happening<br/>
there...got a BBC as soon as I walked in....</div>
