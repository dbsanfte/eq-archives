&gt;I didn&#39;t sign up to hear people bitch and moan about twinking and spell<br/>
&gt;nerfing.  While I&#39;m not positive, I would think that most of you didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;sign up to hear about it either.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here, here.  If I wanted to hear whining and ranting, I&#39;d go read EQVault <br/>
message boards.    I liked the stories, questions and roleplaying stuff I <br/>
heard when I first joined the list.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, does anyone think the new silk armor is pretty cool for low-mid <br/>
level monks?  Sure, it makes woven outdated, but it definitely makes <br/>
tailoring a viable trade skill again.    I hope someday it ends up being <br/>
like jewelry is now.   Ah, it only took verant six months to add the <br/>
remaining tailor patterns.   Maybe smiths will be able to craft other armor <br/>
and weapons next!<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and on the subject of what is an appropriate amount of money for a level <br/>
19 monk (someone posted they had 500pp at that level):  I had 200pp saved up <br/>
at level 18, and I really didn&#39;t try to make money.   Certain areas <br/>
(gargoyle isle, beholder) are very very profitable.   Had I been trying to <br/>
amass wealth, I could have easily had 500pp by now.<br/>
