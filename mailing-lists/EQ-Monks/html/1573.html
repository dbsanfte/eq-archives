<div id="ygrps-yiv-385642488">I&#39;ve just hit 25, aquired Treant fists, and amassed a bit of plat.  So, <br/>
I was wondering if any of my sensei&#39;s out there could let me know what I<br/>
should be shopping for.  I&#39;m wearing cured silk, except the following:<br/>
<br/>
Executioners&#39; Hood<br/>
Spiked Collar (+3 STR, 3 AC)<br/>
Bracer of Erollisi (+5 STR, 5AC)<br/>
Serpentine Bracer  (I&#39;ve got 2, but prefer the ac of the erollisi)<br/>
Treant Fists<br/>
2 Jagged Bands<br/>
Onyx Earring (+2 AGI)<br/>
Earring from the bartender in unrest (+5 cha, ? AC) -- wearing for the AC<br/>
Foreman&#39;s Tunic<br/>
<br/>
Questions:  <br/>
<br/>
Should I sell the foreman&#39;s tunic, and get a lockjaw for 2 more AC?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen gatorscale stuff that drops in guk.  Looks like caster armor, mostly,<br/>
but we can wear it, and the AC is very high.  Should I save up and buy that one<br/>
piece at a time?  (Leggings alone are around 700p)<br/>
<br/>
What level should I consider trying for the Robe of the Lost Circle?  I have<br/>
the purple headband (and black, and blue), and the red sash already).<br/>
<br/>
Are there any *light* 1H blunt weapons that I can cary around to practice with?<br/>
Normally, I just join a HK group and duel wield cracked staves, hoping no one<br/>
will notice that I&#39;m not doing much damage :)  But, when I&#39;m the only tank,<br/>
I can&#39;t afford that much AC loss.<br/>
<br/>
Should I buy a weight reducing bag?  How much should I pay?  I don&#39;t normally<br/>
carry anything at all with weight, besides armor and maybe a couple of weapons<br/>
that will, when wielded, take me over 15 anyway.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance!<br/>
