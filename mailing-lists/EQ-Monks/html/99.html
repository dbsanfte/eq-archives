<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-664894233">For quite a while I was upset about the warrior petition, but after some <br/>
thinking I got over it.  Sure, warriors and paladins can do a lot of <br/>
damage, if they have a 2 hander.  But with a two hander they only get two <br/>
swings.  Sure, they can dual wield, but most one handed weapons don&#39;t have <br/>
a very high damage.  Sure, there are some but they aren&#39;t all that common. <br/>
 Yeah, they&#39;ll be able to swing 4 times at level 29 like we do, but not for <br/>
as much damage as we can punch, and only if they have a good weapon will <br/>
they come close.  At 29 I was helping a level 30 warrior friend to try and <br/>
get the great zweihander, and even with her damage and taunt combined I was <br/>
doing so much more damage she couldn&#39;t pull Karg off of me.  Monks take <br/>
patience, but man o man is it worth it!<br/>
<br/>
Think about this, Monks are the only class that can master hand to hand. <br/>
 That means that up until level 20 other classes could (if they wanted <br/>
too), fight hand to hand just like a monk.  They would have the same skill <br/>
in H2H as a monk, double attack and dual wield, and on top of that be able <br/>
to wear as much metal armor as they want.  Hand to Hand can only start to <br/>
give damage bonuses at 101 skill (Master), or everybody would be able to <br/>
fight like a monk all the time. As far as I&#39;m concerned, monks begin to <br/>
mature at 20th level, this is why I say monks take patience.<br/>
<br/>
On the subject of feign death, I think it is one of the greatest skills in <br/>
the game!  It is so convenient to have, we can go AFK at any time, in any <br/>
place, for any amount of time.  Currently I&#39;m level 30, and since I picked <br/>
up feign death I have only died 4 times.<br/>
<br/>
Stick with it, it&#39;s well worth the time.  :)<br/>

Subject:	[EQ-Monks] Warrior Petition?<br/>
<br/>
 What I want to know is what is with this warrior petition.  Granted maybe <br/>
the warrior class is not really any better than the paladin class in melee  <br/>
 (and it is, IMHO), but why should warriors get another big boost over <br/>
the already humbled monk?  Despite the fact that we get feign death <br/>
eventually, our armor class and atttack does not usually equal that of a <br/>
warrior, which is alright now, but if they get another boost, where is this <br/>
going to leave the monk.  I for one am against the warrior update, unless <br/>
the make a minimal change to the monk class.  I&#39;m not asking for much, I&#39;m <br/>
just asking for something that by making the warrior &quot;king of melee&quot; that <br/>
they just not leave the monks in the dust.<br/>
