I read in some of the recent posts about AC-weight considerations and would like to &quot;trim the fat&quot; so to speak from my armor.<br/>
As of now I have a Leather, shirt, pants, shoulder, gloves, mask, cap, A cloth cape a mesh bracers and raw hide boots. Now keeping in mind that I am working with a tight budget, Nay, make that a VERY tight budget, what whould be your suggestions on what I should keep/acquire.<br/>
Thank you for your time.<br/>
