&gt; &gt;Twinkers RIGHTS!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I would say that I have earned my right to twink. ALL of you playing the <br/>
&gt; game<br/>
&gt; &gt;today, owe me and all the other pioneers a debt of gratitude.  Who do you<br/>
&gt;think<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>this is garbage.  why do i have to earn the right to twink?  i can twink <br/>
whenever<br/>
i want.  i don&#39;t owe you anything.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;writes all those quest walk throughs?  How is that you came by that<br/>
&gt;knowledge of<br/>
&gt; &gt;exactly where that item is dropped?  You take for granted the fact that<br/>
&gt;you can<br/>
&gt; &gt;walk into a dungeon, hang out by the zone and auction for a group, but <br/>
&gt; when I<br/>
&gt; &gt;hit level 30 ( and I was one of the first to do - way back in March! ) I<br/>
&gt;spent<br/>
&gt; &gt;lots and lots and lots of deaths figuring out the dungeons all over<br/>
&gt;NOrrath. I<br/>
&gt; &gt;was in FuLL Bronze back then and VERY VERY VERY proud of it!  I weilded a<br/>
&gt;Black<br/>
&gt; &gt;iron Bastard sword (Ghoulbane had not been found yet) and I thought I was DA<br/>
&gt; &gt;BOMB! This is NEWBIE gear now a days, largely due to the deflationary<br/>
&gt;influence<br/>
&gt; &gt;of the pioneering players trading off their old equipment and <br/>
&gt; discovering the<br/>
&gt; &gt;spawns so that everyone knows how/where to camp the items.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>yah right.  or maybe due to the fact that 100 new bronze pieces enter the<br/>
economy every day on every server just in unrest.  this is the real <br/>
deflationary<br/>
influence not the original players.  and what does this have to do with <br/>
twinking?<br/>
if older players are twinking newer characters they are not trading off old<br/>
equipment and are actually contributing to INflation.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Every player today, even the untwinked ones, owes a lot to the pioneers.<br/>
&gt;You can<br/>
&gt; &gt;BUY items at a trade bazaar at unbelievably cheap prices, these are the same<br/>
&gt; &gt;items I would have spent HOURS searching for the spawn, or xp dying while<br/>
&gt; &gt;learning how to pull the area.  YOu take for granted the fact that you can<br/>
&gt;pick<br/>
&gt; &gt;up a serp bracer for 200pp, a BIBS for 500pp, bronze armor at 6pp a peice!<br/>
&gt; &gt;These were once *status* items that would probably not have even been<br/>
&gt;traded for<br/>
&gt; &gt;6 or 7 months ago.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>so 6 or 7 months ago.  let&#39;s just use bronze armor as an example.  100 pieces<br/>
a day out of unrest.  that&#39;s 3000 pieces per month.  or 18000 to 21000 in 6 <br/>
or 7<br/>
months.  nah, creating 20000 new pieces of bronze (just in one zone, mind you)<br/>
couldn&#39;t have anything to do with the price of bronze falling so rapidly.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Excuse me If I want to just take some of the excess items I have <br/>
&gt; acccumulated<br/>
&gt; &gt;over the months ( and once you start going to the PoF/HATE/etc you will<br/>
&gt;start to<br/>
&gt; &gt;PILE stuff up!) and creat a Uber character of my choosing!  I have <br/>
&gt; invested 9<br/>
&gt; &gt;months into my first character, I dont see it as fair to require me to <br/>
&gt; invest<br/>
&gt; &gt;ANOTHER 9 months in a new one!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>well does this refer to powerlevelling or twinking?  not sure <br/>
here.  twinking alone won&#39;t<br/>
cut a lot of time out of those 9 months.  if anything it may be worse now <br/>
cuz there<br/>
are many more people on the server.  you won&#39;t be able to go to your pet spots<br/>
and have them to yourself all the time.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am sorry, but is this discussion about twinking or the fact that you<br/>
&gt;started playing the game before I did?  It sounds like you have some issues<br/>
&gt;to deal with here and are very hostile about this discussion.  I started<br/>
&gt;this thread as an intelleuctual discussion, not a flame war.  Twinkers have<br/>
&gt;no more rights than Kill stealers in my estimation.  Do you feel that we<br/>
&gt;who started after you automatically owe you repsect because you have played<br/>
&gt;a GAME longer than we have?  I don&#39;t think so.  I, too, spend my time in<br/>
&gt;dungeons, dying and dying again, in the search for elusive  items and<br/>
&gt;experience.  Items and experience are becoming harder and harder to find<br/>
&gt;due to server overcrowding and spawn camping.  To me, you were lucky that<br/>
&gt;you didn&#39;t have to deal with people camping spawning points early in the<br/>
&gt;life of the game.  It was probably easier for you to find creatures of the<br/>
&gt;appropriate level.  When I go out looking, I often find that people will<br/>
&gt;jump on monsters, yelling &quot;Mine!  Mine&quot;, like some 2 year old, because they<br/>
&gt;need the XP or the items.  Do not make assupmtions about me.  I do not take<br/>
&gt;for granted that I can buy serp bracers for 200pp or any of the other<br/>
&gt;things.  Why?  Because I play this game for adventuring purposes.  At 17th<br/>
&gt;level, I figured that the 200 pp I had stashed away would last me quite a<br/>
&gt;while.  That is 200pp I earned the hard way.  No one gave it to me.  It is<br/>
&gt;twinking that is one of the causes of the drop in prices for items.  If<br/>
&gt;every 6th level character has access ti items intended for a 20th level<br/>
&gt;character, those items will decrease in value.  As for the fact that you<br/>
&gt;shouldn&#39;t have to invest 9 months into a new character:  Why not?  Are you<br/>
&gt;afraid that you will get bored?  You already have intimate knowledge of<br/>
&gt;most of the areas of the world that you can use to your advantage.  Why<br/>
&gt;should you add the capability of walking around with items that your<br/>
&gt;character would never have had to chance to obtain?  To be honest, I do not<br/>
&gt;have a problem with a character getting a sword or a piece of armor from<br/>
&gt;someone, even another of the PCs that a player owns..  There are plenty of<br/>
&gt;historical and fantasy based accounts of this, but when someone steps onto<br/>
&gt;the stage, a new character, decked out in itmes that should belong to a<br/>
&gt;10th level or 20th level or 30th level characters, it really cheeses those<br/>
&gt;of us who are trying to earn the items legitimately.  Every item that goes<br/>
&gt;into a twinkers hands, is one less that I or another honest player can earn.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>oh whine whine whine.  i&#39;ve heard this argument and it is lame.  maybe you<br/>
don&#39;t understand the meaning of the word &#39;&#39;legitimately&#39;&#39;.  here&#39;s an example,<br/>
i have a level 38 bard.  i camp the frenzy for experience.  i get lucky and get<br/>
a fbss.  now my bard is pretty well decked out until i can go to the planes.<br/>
there&#39;s a few things i want, but nothing major.  now let me get this <br/>
straight.  if<br/>
i wear this fbss, i have gotten it legitimately.  if i give it to my 16th <br/>
level monk<br/>
i have not?  give me a break.  how is me giving it to my monk instead of<br/>
wearing it myself taking it out of your hands.  if you got your ass up and went<br/>
to lower guk and camped the frenzy maybe you&#39;d have a chance to <br/>
&#39;&#39;legitimately&#39;&#39;<br/>
get it yourself.  the other lame thing you say is &#39;&#39;one less that I or <br/>
another honest<br/>
player can earn&#39;&#39;.  are you implying that twinking is &#39;&#39;dishonest&#39;&#39;?  hmm <br/>
maybe i<br/>
should give you a dictionary, you sure seem to be unclear on what these words<br/>
mean.  if this really &#39;&#39;cheeses&#39;&#39; you,  maybe you are taking this game way too<br/>
seriously.<br/>
