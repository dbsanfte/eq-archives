<div id="ygrps-yiv-697312352"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Hello Fellow Monks,<br/>
&gt;It is me again. This bit just gave me an idea. How about Monk<br/>
&gt;specialization? something like pick a new skill such  as &quot;Fists like<br/>
&gt;Stone&quot;, or &quot;Bending Reed&quot;, which might seriously add to dodging. So fists<br/>
&gt;of stone would dish out harder hits when the skill increases and bending<br/>
&gt;reed might seriously cut on the damage and add to the swiftness and agility<br/>
&gt;of Monks. But make it a choose one or the other type of special skill.<br/>
&gt;Perhaps give us three or four skills to choose from. How about that? :o)<br/>
&gt;Quan of Tribunal<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That actually sounds like a good idea.  But at what level would these be<br/>
available?  20?<br/>
Perhaps have one for swifter punching too?  Fists of the Wind?  Decreases<br/>
your delay by 1 every level? (up to a minimum of 15, or something?</div>
