 </span></blockquote>Alright, I also have a level 8 monk, made him on Fennin and managed to get<br/>
about 5 plat in the bank and keep it about that rate. I haven&#39;t even touched<br/>
a trade skill with him yet, I just sell the rusty weapons I get off of<br/>
gnolls in BB.  Now, BB can be a crappy place to fight, but being in Qeynos,<br/>
since I also dislike running around the huuuuge Karanas, I&#39;ve taken that<br/>
chance.  It is a little tedious since I have to run out and sell stuff in<br/>
the Q hills and eventually have to go to the bank to change all that darn<br/>
heavy copper the gnolls drop, but i haven&#39;t had a big problem. Note that the<br/>
only stuff I have EVER bought is a lightstone for 1pp, some patchwork that<br/>
someone was selling for 1pp for a sort of set (pants/boots/shirt) but that<br/>
stuff is way too heavy to be able to carry much loot. So i haven&#39;t really<br/>
had an occasion to spend any dough. I bought some cloth recently and stashed<br/>
the patch in the bank (debating on just getting rid of it) which seems to<br/>
work nicely. I usually watch my AC to see how much weight I can carry before<br/>
my AC goes back down to what it is without any equipment on.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I am starting a new Monk on Prexus instead &#39;cause I can never find<br/>
anyone to group with (everyone&#39;s got their cliques on Fenn I guess) and I am<br/>
learning Fishing and Baking from the start because they require little<br/>
investment. I don&#39;t know that they&#39;ll help much but they ought to be<br/>
interesting. Baking can be raised by smashing fire beetles and rats (an easy<br/>
task for a lvl 8 monk) and combining a Fire Beetle Eye and a Rat Ears (just<br/>
one) in the Oven in Voleen&#39;s in South Q. You may want to work on that since<br/>
you can get the stuff to learn it pretty darn easily. I have yet to find<br/>
where you can buy Jug O&#39; Sauces or Spices but if I knew then when I got my<br/>
baking up I could cook meats from wolves and the like. There&#39;s a guide on<br/>
EqVault about that one. I&#39;m also doing fishing for the halibut, er, hell of<br/>
it, I don&#39;t see that it produces large amounts of money, but it does have a<br/>
pretty big ROI (a 3 to 4 copper bait for a 2 silver fish?) and I&#39;ve heard<br/>
rumors of better poles available somewhere. Dunno bout that one though. Also<br/>
am working on Beg for the hell of it while I sit on the dock, you can shlep<br/>
both fishing, beg, and sense heading all while you stand there, but all I&#39;ve<br/>
ever got from beg was the wrong end of a guard&#39;s weapon. :)<br/>
<br/>
Anybody else got any ideas? I&#39;m pretty sure that everything other than<br/>
Baking and Fishing requires a sizeable starting investment, but am I on the<br/>
wrong track? Also, is there anything that can be thrown that doesn&#39;t<br/>
disappear? I like the idea of carrying shuriken around to toss at enemies,<br/>
that&#39;s fun, but I imagine I would get tired of buying shuriken refills all<br/>
the time. Also was considering using my dual wield skill to learn a little<br/>
1h blunt on the side but all those darn weapons are so heavy. :(</div>
