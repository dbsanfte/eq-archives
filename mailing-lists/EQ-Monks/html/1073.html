<div id="ygrps-yiv-1486193469">One of the main reasons I like EQ better than Asheron&#39;s call is<br/>
AC&#39;s lack of communications options (I can&#39;t chat with the whole<br/>
zone) makes it less interesting making it more like a single<br/>
player game.  It is fun in Guk razzing people camping other items,<br/>
congratulate people getting good items or levels, etc.  I miss that<br/>
in AC.  Even when I want to solo I still like to chat.  Otherwise, I&#39;d<br/>
play a single player game.<br/>

Seems like its me against the world again...<br/>
<br/>
When I say EQ is just a game, I mean that in the sense that the &quot;game&quot;<br/>
of EQ, the mana regen rate, the special abilities of the warrior, the<br/>
aggro characteristics of lizards, etc is a game.<br/>
<br/>
The ability to /tell,<br/>
/guildsay, /say, /shout, /ooc are common means of communication<br/>
that exist in any non-single player game.  These aren&#39;t part of the<br/>
&quot;game&quot;.   And this is why I say the &quot;game&quot; is just a game.</div>
