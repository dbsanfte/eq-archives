&gt; &gt;I recommend you all dump some of your dex and agi gear (keep agi above 120,<br/>
&gt;but drop dex like a rock - detailed log studies show it is useless to us!)<br/>
&gt;and switch it out for AC stuff.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Well, it should depend somewhat on whom you&#39;re grouping with. I have<br/>
&gt;personally been trying to up my dex, in an attempt to get my double attack<br/>
&gt;and dual wield to go off more (that&#39;s not so useless in my eyes). As for<br/>
&gt;dropping AGI, that gives you AC (at least it effects the number on the<br/>
&gt;screen, which isn&#39;t totally indicative of what&#39;s going on). As near as I can<br/>
&gt;tell, having a High AGI helps you when taking a hit, by lessening the amount<br/>
&gt;of damage you take. I get hit a lot less hard then some of the other party<br/>
&gt;members with a lower AGI. (Gotta love the Ranger who casts FLAC.)<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>according to posts i&#39;ve seen, dex has nothing to do with double attack or dual<br/>
wield going off more, only with how fast the double attack and dual wield <br/>
skills<br/>
go up.  i.e. skill increase, not skill success</div>
