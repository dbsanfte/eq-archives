<div id="ygrps-yiv-1444208588">1st point:<br/>
The alchemist in misty spawns at teh goblin camp closest to the running eye<br/>
zone.  ordinarily there are 2 goblins at this camp, but ever hour and a half or<br/>
so a 3rd goblibn pops - either Mooto or the alchemist.  Mooto and the alchemist<br/>
are the only ones you need to kill.  But somepeople kill the other two to pass<br/>
the time.  <br/>
<br/>
NOTE: this is the easier of the two alchemists to get.  The one in the gorge is<br/>
*VERY* rare.  If I were you I would take advantage of the server reset and head<br/>
to the GOrge as soon as you wake up!  The misty thicket alchemist will pop about<br/>
once every 2-4 hours.  The one in the gorge is rumored to be a once a week<br/>
guy....<br/>

Started.. or at least tried to start.. the Treant Fists quest last night.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s 10:04AM central... I haven&#39;t gone to bed yet.  Spent from 1:15am until<br/>
just now slaughtering goblins in Misty Thicket trying to get the damn<br/>
alchemist to spawn.  No luck.  Even petitioned just before the servers were<br/>
going to come down to see if they could make him spawn for me.  No dice. :)<br/>
<br/>
Ah well... I hope my next attempt later today won&#39;t last as long as this one<br/>
did.  I&#39;m exhausted.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully the servers will be up when I wake up.<br/>
