<div id="ygrps-yiv-2104733091">Another warning sign is people who insist on being anon.  I don&#39;t mind<br/>
people doing it.  But from a few unpleasent experiences I will not<br/>
group with amyone who will not let me /who them to check levels.<br/>
There seem to be a lot of people out there who love to group a with a<br/>
party a few lvls lower to grab the xp.<br/>

&gt;I agree with you totally. <br/>
&gt;I would have abandoned his greedy little butt the minute he refused to<br/>
&gt;turn over the crush tunic.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Players like that are defintely to be avoided at all costs.  putting up<br/>
&gt;with them only encourages them to persist in their intolerabel behavior.<br/>
&gt;I hope that what you did gave him cause to reflect and to realize the<br/>
&gt;error of his ways.<br/>

&gt;&gt; On the same thread of persistence...<br/>
[snip]<br/>
&gt;&gt; A) Greed is a poor quality in a monk<br/>
&gt;&gt; B) He was one of the worst group members we had ever<br/>
&gt;&gt; been with<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; We left him there and went on our way. Now, the moral<br/>
&gt;&gt; of the story is this. Having lied to us once already<br/>
&gt;&gt; by stealing the armor, we did not trust him to ever<br/>
&gt;&gt; give it back. Therefore, why would we help him? There<br/>
&gt;&gt; would be many more chances to get Crush and his armor<br/>
&gt;&gt; (which I plan to do for my new friend, btw) and we did<br/>
&gt;&gt; not need his poor company.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; Forgive my ramblings but in EQ ,as in life, you will<br/>
&gt;&gt; get farther with honesty and loyalty than with<br/>
&gt;&gt; mistrust and greed. If he had handed the armor over I<br/>
&gt;&gt; would have been sure to help him since we would then<br/>
&gt;&gt; have only needed the one BoB. His greed cost him our<br/>
&gt;&gt; help.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; Thanks for listening and may truth guide you<br/>
