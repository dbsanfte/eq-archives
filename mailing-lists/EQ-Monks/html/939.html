<div id="ygrps-yiv-1429434077">From all that I&#39;ve heard, they do not spawn Grim Oakfist any more, because <br/>
the treant fist NEEDS to be nerfed first.  And if he does spawn, the tigers <br/>
will not.  I personally totally agree with this, treant fists are not <br/>
something we need, they would make up way too powerful and totally throw off <br/>
game balance.  Come on now, do you really need gloves that have limitless <br/>
charges of CH?  Let&#39;s plz all play fair  :o)<br/>
