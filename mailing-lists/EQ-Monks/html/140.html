<b>Subject:</b> Feign Death vs. casters and anomolous failures <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-247999245">I posted this on another list, but wanted to share it with this one<br/>
as well to see if anybody might be able to help solve the mystery of why FD<br/>
fails without a message sometimes.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>	Interesting suggestion, and it would seem to jive with some of my<br/>
own experiences with FD lately.  I&#39;ve been racking my brains trying to<br/>
figure out why it is that FD fails to stop an aggressor&#39;s attacks even when<br/>
no &quot;xxx has fallen to the ground&quot; message.  Clearly, it has failed but we<br/>
have no indication of this other than the fact that we&#39;re still getting<br/>
pounded.  Some of my thoughts on the subject are these, any modifications<br/>
to this list would be well appreciated:<br/>
<br/>
1 - Feigning when mobs are frenzied on you has a dramatically higher rate<br/>
of failure than against non-frenzied mobs.<br/>
<br/>
2 - Feigning &#39;mid-attack&#39; seems to fail more frequently.  Perhaps it goes<br/>
something like this:<br/>
<br/>
a) Mob starts his swing<br/>
b) Feign performed (no message of failure)<br/>
c) I stob being the mob&#39;s current target<br/>
d) Blow lands, re-instating me as the current target<br/>
e) Mob keeps pounding on current target (me).<br/>
<br/>
	I don&#39;t know if this is really what happens or not, but it would<br/>
fit with the previous poster&#39;s &#39;wait until the caster has done his thing&#39;<br/>
suggestion.  Also, have you noticed that after you kill a mob, you still<br/>
sometimes take a swing and occasionally see a damage message AFTER the<br/>
thing has died?  Perhaps this is an artifact of the above sequence.<br/>
<br/>
3 - Still not sure whether or not stopping your attack before feigning<br/>
affects things except perhaps exacerbating the situation outlined in #2.<br/>
<br/>
	Well?<br/>
