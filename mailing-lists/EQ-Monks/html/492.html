&gt;Perhaps I don&#39;t fully recognize the stun issue because of level differences?<br/>
&gt;At lvl 27, I have no problem with blue young goblin shamans in Soluseks Eye,<br/>
&gt;and surprised myself by outlasting a cinder goblin wizard as well, although<br/>
&gt;it was close. I resisted each a couple times without wearing any magic<br/>
&gt;enhancing items. Does the problem vs. casting MoB&#39;s mainly come into play at<br/>
&gt;the higher levels?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>         Actually, no it doesn&#39;t. One of my most vivid deaths as a Monk was <br/>
in West Commons to a GREEN con Derv Erudite wiz. There were 2 Dervs, the <br/>
wizzie and a rogue (didn&#39;t know it at the time). Both me (14th level Monk) <br/>
and my partner (14th level Wizard) engaged the Melee and promptly got <br/>
stomped by the Wiz. The Derv Wiz was hidden by a tent. After that first <br/>
Fire Bolt I ran back there to him and started hitting him. I lasted a total <br/>
of 30 more seconds. The rogue got a single backstab in, but the Wiz just <br/>
tore me to shreds. My Wiz partner did his job and dropped the Rogue on my <br/>
back, but it was way too late. He ended up dying too when that Wiz finished <br/>
me off and turned on him.<br/>
<br/>
         When I turned and ran at that Wiz and started hitting him, I was <br/>
connecting on most of my punches and strikes. He was getting hit, but he <br/>
kept on casting. I hit him several times right in the middle of casting and <br/>
it didn&#39;t faze him. There wasn&#39;t even a message about regaining <br/>
concentration; he just hammered me like I wasn&#39;t touching him. I have seen <br/>
this several times since then. After this fiasco though, I vowed to fight <br/>
as few NPC wizards as possible. I now only take on Casters in a full group.<br/>
<br/>
         Interesting side note: The Derv Wiz was probably level 10. He <br/>
didn&#39;t get interrupted once. However, as any 10th level Pure Caster will <br/>
tell you, getting pummeled like that by a Melee Mob that cons Yellow or <br/>
better would cause EVERY spell they tried to cast to be interrupted. The <br/>
rules of balance are definitely skewed towards the NPCs.<br/>
<br/>
         There are of course several items that will help with MR. If you <br/>
know you will be fighting Casters get your MR as high as possible. Get all <br/>
the latest and greatest equipment and wear it. Don&#39;t worry about AC that <br/>
much. Wearing the following Jewelry and items will get you up to a total of <br/>
70 vs. Magic (not to mention 39 vs. Disease/Poison and 44 vs. Fire/Cold):<br/>
         (2) Platinum Diamond Rings (+7 vs. All)<br/>
         (1) Gold Diamond Veil (+10 vs. Disease/Poison, +5 vs. Fire/Cold, <br/>
+3 vs Magic)<br/>
         (2) Gold Wolf&#39;s Eye Bracelets (+7 vs. Magic)<br/>
         (1) Platinum Wolf&#39;s Eye Necklace (+9 vs. Magic)<br/>
         Snakeskin Mask (+5 vs. Magic)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
         Getting a Diamond, much less 3, is a hard thing to accomplish, but <br/>
the Bracelets and Necklace are easily made by any skilled Jeweler. Total <br/>
materials cost should be around 135p or so. Make friends with a Jeweler and <br/>
you should have no problems. If you don&#39;t have any Jeweler friends and are <br/>
not currently in a Guild, I would ask around and find out who the Master <br/>
Jewelers are on your server and then join the Guild they are in. It will <br/>
save you a ton of money in the long run and you get the benefit of having a <br/>
high-lvl Enchanter to group with.<br/>
<br/>
p.s. Fighting a Shaman and fighting a Pure Caster are two completely <br/>
different things. I could easily take Mooto (10th level Goblin Shaman in <br/>
Misty Thicket) at 10th level and then got demolished by a 10th level Wizard <br/>
when I was 14th level.<br/>
