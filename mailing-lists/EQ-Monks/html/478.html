<div id="ygrps-yiv-718306228">I think some of the monks, if I am not mistaken,  you have seen complaining<br/>
were not even in their 20s from what I saw in their emails. Monks and Rogues<br/>
are amazing for dealing damage at the higher levels. Where both classes<br/>
begin to blossom unfortunately most people stop playing these character<br/>
types before they even get there. What are monks good for. Well lets take a<br/>
look at this whole pulling thing. To be able to Feign Death pull is a huge<br/>
asset not only to a group but to solo fighting. Walking into a room of 5<br/>
mobs and pulling out one is an amazing trick. On top of that. I myself spent<br/>
levels 30 to where I am now at 47 with only a cleric at my side. Yes I did<br/>
group with others but most of my hunting would be just myself and him.<br/>
Damage wise. Lets take a look at this. Shooting out 4 attacks every 3 secs<br/>
potentially hitting for 50 each time lets average at 35 plus a high kick in<br/>
the 90s. Those 4 attacks every 3 secs or just over 2 if you have the black<br/>
sash from Lower Guk giving you HASTE. What does this mean. 140 points of<br/>
damage every 2 to 3 secs plus a kick every 8 or so putting potential damage<br/>
for a 9 sec interval at somewhere between 400 and 600. To me that is pretty<br/>
impressive! You can heal yourself every 6 minutes. Making clerics love you<br/>
knowing that they don&#39;t have to heal you at the first sight of damage.<br/>
<br/>
Please any other Higher level Monks respond to this so the younger guys can<br/>
know that it does get better and that we are not as impaired as they think<br/>
we are.<br/>

&gt; will do. A question tho... if this is the case, why then do many monks say<br/>
&gt; we need more damage dealing ability? Because they are not out-damaging<br/>
&gt; everyone in sight? I have no problem with my role in group situations<br/>
&gt; changing as my abilities change.. Actually I think they should. I know I<br/>
&gt; would get fairly bored if my role from lvl 1-50 was static. It is the<br/>
whole<br/>
&gt; reason I dumped my lvl 18 warrior. I never saw any change in what would be<br/>
&gt; expected of the class. The original post I responded to said most groups<br/>
&gt; seek monks for their pulling ability. Well, lets take a look at what the<br/>
&gt; other classes are sought after for:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Cleric- healing<br/>
&gt; Druid- ok.. bad example, they do alot of things<br/>
&gt; Shaman- buffing (and see druid)<br/>
&gt; Wiz- blasting<br/>
&gt; War- soaking and dealing damage<br/>
&gt; Ranger- dealing damage<br/>
&gt; Enchanter- debuffing<br/>
&gt; rogue- backstabbing<br/>
&gt; Mag- ummm never grouped with one so I am not sure.<br/>
&gt; Necro- DoT<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; All classes (except Druid and Shaman) have one thing they are outstanding<br/>
&gt; at, and other things they do ok, and some things they just plain stink at.<br/>
&gt; Why is it bad to be sought after because we are the best pullers in the<br/>
&gt; lands? Should Rogues be upset that the only thing anyone ever expects of<br/>
&gt; them is to backstab? The point I am trying rather long-windedly to make is<br/>
&gt; that while there are many abilities we do not have, the ones we do have<br/>
are<br/>
&gt; vital in a group situation, which is how EQ was designed to be played (I<br/>
&gt; won&#39;t go into the whole solo vs group issue, as I am sure each of us has a<br/>
&gt; different opinion). Regardless of what class is played, if you know what<br/>
&gt; your strengths and weaknesses are and utilize them accordingly, you will<br/>
be<br/>
&gt; a sought after party member.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But thanks for the info on the perception and ability change that comes<br/>
with<br/>
&gt; 30. I look forward to finding yet another facet of the monk class.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Your entire opinion will change once you hit 30th level. You will start<br/>
&gt; &gt; outdamaging almost everyone. I am in the high 40s and have outdamaged 3<br/>
&gt; &gt; 50th<br/>
&gt; &gt; Paladins. We are a great tank AC goes up every level as Defense goes up<br/>
&gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; we dont have to hunt down all kinds of crap for armor. attacking 4 times<br/>
&gt; &gt; in<br/>
&gt; &gt; a round and hitting for 30 to 50 points each shot and then kicking for<br/>
90+<br/>
&gt; &gt; you will pull almost anything off a party member...clerics...in no time.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Give it some more time and I think you will see that all this changes.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I for one like the current damage we do. I don&#39;t think we should be<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; out-damaging a warrior swinging a big 2h weapon or dual wielding, and<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t want to. They have the ac and the hp to protect them from those<br/>
&gt; &gt; 50+<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; damage blows that would chew us up in very little time. I have always<br/>
&gt; &gt; been<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; of the belief that the monk is NOT a tank. Our armor limitations<br/>
prevent<br/>
&gt; &gt; us<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; from acting like one. With one MoB, we are fine as Dodge and Block<br/>
will<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; serve us well, but if we get hit, we get hit HARD. With 2 or more<br/>
MoB&#39;s,<br/>
&gt; &gt; our<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Dodge and Block skill will not serve us nearly as well. We are more<br/>
like<br/>
&gt; &gt; an<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; animated DoT spell, inflicting a steady amount of damage throughout<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; duration of a fight. Few people can dish out the damage we can yet<br/>
&gt; &gt; remain<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; relatively unmolested. A drawback is it is very difficult to pull a<br/>
MoB<br/>
&gt; &gt; off<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; a party member who is in trouble, and perhaps I would enjoy having a<br/>
&gt; &gt; Taunt<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; skill (no I don&#39;t think it is built into our special attacks), but I<br/>
for<br/>
&gt; &gt; one<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; think the Monk class on the whole is doing just fine.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  Lots of good points brought up in this discussion.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  I agree completely that we should get some kind of stunning attack,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; our delay should beat most, if not all, weapons. As a very<br/>
&gt; &gt; well-equipped<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; monk<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at lvl 40, I am routinely outdamaged by Ogre and Troll warriors, to<br/>
&gt; &gt; say<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; nothing of casters. So, though we have some unique abilities, monks<br/>
&gt; &gt; could<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; certainly stand some improvement. On my server, monks are sought<br/>
&gt; &gt; primarily<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pullers rather than combatants, b/c of Feign pulling...<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  But until we get organized, and talk to Verant in some organized<br/>
&gt; &gt; manner,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will get very little...<br/>
