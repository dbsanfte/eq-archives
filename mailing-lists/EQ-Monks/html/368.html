<div id="ygrps-yiv-771619151">the Electrum Bracelets(+3dex/+3agi) are not jewelry craft.  They are off a<br/>
rare spawn Aviak in S Karanas named Knari or something close to that.  I<br/>
tried to buy one off another monk but he was trying to get 100pp from me<br/>
for one because thats about what he paid.  I wouldn&#39;t pay more than<br/>
40-50pp for one.  Anything more than that would not be worth<br/>
it...considering you can buy a Black Pearl for about 75pp on my<br/>
server...and get much better jewelry made from it and it has a much higher<br/>
resell value if you ever wanted to sell it.<br/>
