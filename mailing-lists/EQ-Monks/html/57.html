advantages of being a monk in the first place.  First off, take whatever<br/>
time you need and do nothing but pound that Feign Death button until you<br/>
max the skill out for your level (90 at level 17).  I can GUARANTEE that<br/>
this skill WILL save your life repeatedly.  There are a couple of things<br/>
which can increase your likelyhood of success, though.  First, stop<br/>
attacking your opponent before you try to FD.  Others claim that having low<br/>
HP as well as having your back turned will help, but my experience does not<br/>
bear this out.<br/>
	I could go on and on about Feign Death (as a matter of fact, I<br/>
think I did in a post just last week), but please dont give up on it yet.<br/>
<br/>
P.S.: If you had a bunch of problems yesterday getting it to work, Verant<br/>
was having odd server lag that made a successful FD much more difficult.<br/>
It claimed my life more than once.<br/>
