<b>Subject:</b> Disarm skill <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-218569510">A couple of days ago when I logged on the chat server they had that question <br/>
&quot;Should you be able to use the disarm skill in a PvP situatioin?&quot;  Can you <br/>
use it now in a PvP situation and they are thinking about changing it or is <br/>
it the other way around?  I think monks should be able to because it is one <br/>
of the skills we get, and it makes us who we are.  Why even give us the <br/>
skill if we can&#39;t use it.  Also to the people that already have it, what <br/>
happens when you disarm?  Does the weapon go on the ground or in your <br/>
inventory?  Thanks</div>
