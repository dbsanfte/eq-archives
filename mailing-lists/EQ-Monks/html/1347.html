&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am sorry, but is this discussion about twinking or the fact that you<br/>
started playing the game before I did?  It sounds like you have some issues<br/>
to deal with here and are very hostile about this discussion.  I started<br/>
this thread as an intelleuctual discussion, not a flame war.  Twinkers have<br/>
no more rights than Kill stealers in my estimation.  Do you feel that we<br/>
who started after you automatically owe you repsect because you have played<br/>
a GAME longer than we have?  I don&#39;t think so.  I, too, spend my time in<br/>
dungeons, dying and dying again, in the search for elusive  items and<br/>
experience.  Items and experience are becoming harder and harder to find<br/>
due to server overcrowding and spawn camping.  To me, you were lucky that<br/>
you didn&#39;t have to deal with people camping spawning points early in the<br/>
life of the game.  It was probably easier for you to find creatures of the<br/>
appropriate level.  When I go out looking, I often find that people will<br/>
jump on monsters, yelling &quot;Mine!  Mine&quot;, like some 2 year old, because they<br/>
need the XP or the items.  Do not make assupmtions about me.  I do not take<br/>
for granted that I can buy serp bracers for 200pp or any of the other<br/>
things.  Why?  Because I play this game for adventuring purposes.  At 17th<br/>
level, I figured that the 200 pp I had stashed away would last me quite a<br/>
while.  That is 200pp I earned the hard way.  No one gave it to me.  It is<br/>
twinking that is one of the causes of the drop in prices for items.  If<br/>
every 6th level character has access ti items intended for a 20th level<br/>
character, those items will decrease in value.  As for the fact that you<br/>
shouldn&#39;t have to invest 9 months into a new character:  Why not?  Are you<br/>
afraid that you will get bored?  You already have intimate knowledge of<br/>
most of the areas of the world that you can use to your advantage.  Why<br/>
should you add the capability of walking around with items that your<br/>
character would never have had to chance to obtain?  To be honest, I do not<br/>
have a problem with a character getting a sword or a piece of armor from<br/>
someone, even another of the PCs that a player owns..  There are plenty of<br/>
historical and fantasy based accounts of this, but when someone steps onto<br/>
the stage, a new character, decked out in itmes that should belong to a<br/>
10th level or 20th level or 30th level characters, it really cheeses those<br/>
of us who are trying to earn the items legitimately.  Every item that goes<br/>
into a twinkers hands, is one less that I or another honest player can earn.<br/>
