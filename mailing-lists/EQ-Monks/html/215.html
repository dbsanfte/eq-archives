<b>Subject:</b> monk websites? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-640050894">I recently joined the brotherhood of monks.<br/>
I am still an apprentice monk in dawn of my years with little experience<br/>
in battle (indeed with little proficiency in it) but I hope that this will<br/>
change in the next few weeks.<br/>
<br/>
Lastnight while conversing with a far more experienced monk than myself,<br/>
he mentioned a monk website to me that i was trying to check out today.<br/>
the URL was something like: www.kadamit.com/eqmonks <br/>
<br/>
However when I try to go to the site, I realize that I have the URL<br/>
slightly wrong.  Do any of you know the correct URL.  Indeed do any of you<br/>
know of anyother websites with good information on MONKS?<br/>
<br/>
thank you.<br/>
