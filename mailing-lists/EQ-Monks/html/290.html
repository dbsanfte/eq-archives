<div id="ygrps-yiv-201978130">Just two add my two cents. BB is a great place so dont fill intimidated, <br/>
just know your escape routes. Remember monks get the safe fall skill (at 8 i <br/>
think) and BB is filled with little bridges, if you tet in trouble dont take <br/>
the path, just fall off a bridge and run out, they will be on your behind <br/>
but too far away too catch you. Ths also really helps to build you safe <br/>
fall! I worked BB from 7-12 before heading to gukk where I have been living <br/>
since with some adventuring up to crush and infected for some change of <br/>
vista!</div>
