<div id="ygrps-yiv-1133819828">Ok, the warrior will have more HP, and can take more hits going from<br/>
full to dead.  But remember that most of your time spent grouping<br/>
involves a monster pull, barsh some heads, you go down 40% life, the<br/>
cleric heals you up, you go pull again.  The monk will lose roughly<br/>
the same amount of HP, (thus greater %HP), regen hp just as fast, and<br/>
be pulling again just as fast.  In times when the warriors full hp<br/>
are needed for him to live, the monk can FD and live, and in<br/>
good steady groups, the greater warrior hp don&#39;t matter that much.<br/>
<br/>
FD pulling is slow, and its much more efficient to just bring them<br/>
all and mez or just blast through the pack.  FD pulling is still very<br/>
good, but it is not the best way to gain xp fast, my opinion.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am thinking of starting a monk or warrior.  The main deciding factors for <br/>
&gt; me are how much hp each have and how many hits they can take.  Can monks <br/>
&gt; take more hits than warriors if they use mend and have high agility?  Which <br/>
&gt; can dish out more damage up until level 30 or so?  Thanx for any answers in <br/>
&gt; advance.  i am kind of leaning towards warrior though since all the bad <br/>
&gt; stuff i heard about FD now.<br/>
