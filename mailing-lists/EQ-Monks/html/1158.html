<div id="ygrps-yiv-405291266">1)DEX currently is cmpletely useless to  monk.  IT has been confirmed by ABASHI:<br/>
high dex will help your skill to increase more (i.e. learn faster) but dex gets<br/>
nopart in your DA/DW roll.  DEX is only important for proc&#39;ing weapons, archery,<br/>
and critical hits.  NONE of which are important to monks.  You can argue this<br/>
point back and forth if you like.  There have been studies done to PROVE that<br/>
DEX has no other effects than those I just stated here.  Abashi has CONFIRMED it<br/>
on the www.everquest.com message board.<br/>
<br/>
2) Basically the change is going in to reduce the delay on the fists as you<br/>
level.  This means that Augmentation, celerity, and the haste shash effect will<br/>
STACK (ie combine) with the delay to make you fists go even faster.  I said this<br/>
in my original post.<br/>
<br/>
3)  You are right there is no  taunt built into our fists or kicks, but neither<br/>
is there a taunt built into rogue stabs or backstabs,  the Monster will simply<br/>
be responding to the entity that is hitting it the most frequently and doing the<br/>
most damage (hence the quotes around &quot;hella taunt&quot; - it was a figurative<br/>
reference).  <br/>
 <br/>
4) As far as agi affecting ac this is true up to a certain point.  Beyond about<br/>
120, agi is useless.  DO a test, if your agi is above 130,  equip and de-equip<br/>
that golden black pearl choker.  How does your ac change?  My agi is 139, and<br/>
removing ALL my Black pearl jewelery has little effect on my AC (reduces it by<br/>
2).  Replacing it with jagged bands and a 7str, 7int necklace DOES increase my<br/>
ac (by about 15) and the damage on fists by a good deal. This, I find usefull.<br/>

monks wil  face once the patch goes in.<br/>
<br/>
Here we go. Time to start another incident.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Every monk above level 20 will be doing a good deal more damage - 15% more<br/>
 </span></blockquote>by level 50.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe, how the delay is being changed, I don&#39;t know. If you re-read GA&#39;s<br/>
post you could take what he said as the delay cap for the fist is being<br/>
lowered, but the actual delay isn&#39;t. Possible translation: Augmentation,<br/>
Alacrity, and Haste Items will HELP YOU MORE, but your fist Delay MAY NOT<br/>
improve. Not a straight answer either way.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m open to corrections and other thoughts on this, particularly from<br/>
Brother Choy.<br/>
<br/>
(changing the order of the next few statements)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;What this means is that like rogues we will be doing &quot;hella taunts&quot; with<br/>
 </span></blockquote>our whirling fists.  I may also start using easgle strike a bit more (it<br/>
taunts alot less than kick and does almost as much damage).<br/>
<br/>
None of your special attacks acts as a taunt, its _strictly_ damage based.<br/>
Monsters agro you based on the amount of damage you&#39;re doing, not the attack<br/>
doing the damage. (Referring to monk attacks only.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I recommend you all dump some of your dex and agi gear (keep agi above 120,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>but drop dex like a rock - detailed log studies show it is useless to us!)<br/>
and switch it out for AC stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Well, it should depend somewhat on whom you&#39;re grouping with. I have<br/>
personally been trying to up my dex, in an attempt to get my double attack<br/>
and dual wield to go off more (that&#39;s not so useless in my eyes). As for<br/>
dropping AGI, that gives you AC (at least it effects the number on the<br/>
screen, which isn&#39;t totally indicative of what&#39;s going on). As near as I can<br/>
tell, having a High AGI helps you when taking a hit, by lessening the amount<br/>
of damage you take. I get hit a lot less hard then some of the other party<br/>
members with a lower AGI. (Gotta love the Ranger who casts FLAC.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I know I am going to go in all AC gear from now on, concentrating on str as<br/>
 </span></blockquote>secondary.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sold on the STR gear. The ATK number is a hybrid like AC. Adding<br/>
another 5 points of str doesn&#39;t seem to help all that much compared to<br/>
another 5 pts of dex. Again, it seems that having another +5 str only gives<br/>
another five points of damage. I&#39;d rather spend the inventory spot on a dex<br/>
item that gives me another attack chance at a 30+ punch. Still, there is<br/>
much guess work here.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Just be prepared for a change in tactics and gear once the patch goes live.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Indeed! Its a good day for monks, and I&#39;m prepared to be healed a lot more.<br/>
I&#39;ve been playing with the same group of people of the past month or so, and<br/>
its been very interesting. I very rarely can get a monster&#39;s attention off<br/>
the Ranger with his dual SSOYs, but occasionally it does happen (good old<br/>
Flying Kick). I&#39;m already embarrassing the paladin (3 levels higher) on<br/>
damage to the point where she can rarely pull the mob off me (not counting<br/>
undead). I&#39;m very curious to see how this works out versus the ranger, post<br/>
patch. I&#39;m prepared to get some love from my clerics. ;)<br/>
