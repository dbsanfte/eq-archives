<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1406359922">I have always been able to find the Cube by following the waterway to the<br/>
other end where it opens into a large pool...<br/>
there is  an underwater tunnel at the end of the pool, swim in there, the<br/>
cube is always there... after starting the attack swim out and jump out the<br/>
pool, the cube will follow you and you can attack him there....<br/>
caution you might also pull some Gobbie that lives down there as well... I<br/>
just ignored him till I killed the Cube<br/>

&gt; Okay the cube is nowhere near there but on the same lvl<br/>
&gt; okay you rember how you come down the ramp go through that first door then<br/>
&gt; the second door<br/>
&gt; then theres the guards you go around them to head to kings room well this<br/>
&gt; time<br/>
&gt; you don&#39;t go into that next door but take a right and you will see water<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; path following the way on both sides<br/>
&gt; you follow the path by taking a left and you go all the way till you come<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; some tables and such and you will see a star with<br/>
&gt; water in it and water around it you have to jump into the star and swim<br/>
down<br/>
&gt; sometimes theres some kind of water goblin i forget<br/>
&gt; the name of it down there wasn&#39;t too much trouble for me lvl 30 monk<br/>
&gt; took me over 15 hours yesterday camping to finally get the goblin in<br/>
&gt; beholder luckly the one in misty spawned within an hour<br/>
&gt; good luck<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hi all I ned help.  I am trying to complete the TREATN fist quest. I<br/>
have<br/>
&gt; &gt; all the ingredients except the cat skull cap form the gelatenous cube in<br/>
&gt; &gt; Running Eye.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I am trying to find the exact location of the gelatenous cube in running<br/>
&gt; &gt; eye. If anyone here has any ideas as to whre it is (in relation to the<br/>
&gt; &gt; throne room an the captain spawn) please provide DETAILED explanation.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Everyone tells  me behind the throne room but I just  spent all night<br/>
&gt; &gt; killing everything I could find behind the throne room and I managed to<br/>
&gt; kill<br/>
&gt; &gt; two captains in the time that no cube has shown its face.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Ok so as I enter the King  I face a door that leeads to the room where<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; captain spawns ( one of the elite guards is the captains place holder)<br/>
&gt; Now<br/>
&gt; &gt; does the cube spawn in this &quot;captain room&quot; or  in the hall behind the<br/>
door<br/>
&gt; &gt; in the back of this &quot;captain room&quot;?  Or is he even farther back?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; If I am rambling excuse me but I just spent allnight on this damned<br/>
quest<br/>
&gt; &gt; with no results... very frustrating....<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
