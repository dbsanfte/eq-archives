<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1311350173">Now I am by no means Crazy enough to complain about the impending enhancements.<br/>
But I just wanted to share with some of you issues that we monks wil  face once<br/>
the patch goes in.  Every monk above level 20 will be doing a good deal more<br/>
damage - 15% more by level 50.  What this means is that like rogues we will be<br/>
doing &quot;hella taunts&quot; with our whirling fists.  I recommend you all dump some of<br/>
your dex and agi gear (keep agi above 120, but drop dex like a rock - detailed<br/>
log studies show it is useless to us!)   and switch it out for AC stuff.  I know<br/>
I am going to go in all AC gear from now on, concentrating on str as secondary. <br/>
I may also start using easgle strike a bit more (it taunts alot less than kick<br/>
and does almost as much damage).<br/>
<br/>
Just be prepared for a change in tactics and gear once the patch goes live.<br/>
