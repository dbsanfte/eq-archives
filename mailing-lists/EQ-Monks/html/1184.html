Mend heals exactly one quarter of your health or exactly one and one<br/>
quarter of a bubble. My personal recommendation is that until you have<br/>
reached a point where mend does not fail (around level 20) use it<br/>
immediately when you see a bubble and a half of your health expire.  Use it<br/>
for both of those reasons that brother Shelza indicates--faster recycling<br/>
for the next mend, save cleric mana--and also use it so that if you are in<br/>
a particularly close combat situation, you will have a better idea if you<br/>
should retreat or not (if it fails or worsens). When your mend skill<br/>
reaches a point where it is successful every use (and yes, that time will<br/>
come). Then I would do as brother Dizzy recommends and save it for post<br/>
battle recuperation after you have applied your bind wound skill. In this<br/>
last example, by the time you have reached full health and begin the battle<br/>
anew, your mend skill should refresh. You will then be able to repeat the<br/>
process. I used this last technique to great effect battling fierce<br/>
gargoyles in the Ocean of Tears from levels 22 to 25. To those that<br/>
advocate chasing noble Aviaks at this level range, just know this, Aviaks<br/>
do not attack unprovoked while the evil gargoyles have no qualms about<br/>
drawing human blood...<br/>
