<div id="ygrps-yiv-379053015">I started a monk last weekend. After growing bored of my high lvl druid. My<br/>
one question is How do you see? I get nervous going anywhere at night. I<br/>
have Wu&#39;s fighting guantlets...but Greater lightstones are not the answer<br/>
and heat/cold stones are no rent is there anything out there that is good<br/>
to use to see. Or am I blind forever? =(</div>
