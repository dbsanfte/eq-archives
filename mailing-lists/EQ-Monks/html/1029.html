&gt; Hiya, Kaladiel!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There seems to be a misconception about mistmoore werewolves.  To my<br/>
&gt; understanding, they do NOT drop the claw for the Karg quest.  They drop<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; Talon for the crafted breastplate quest.   I believe you can only get a<br/>
claw<br/>
&gt; from werewolves in outdoor areas.   Someone please, please correct me if I<br/>
&gt; am wrong, but I believe this to be true.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Fare well<br/>

&gt; &gt;Hi all, I have decided that it is time for me to complete something I<br/>
have<br/>
&gt; &gt;set out to do for quite some time. And that is to get a freaking Werewolf<br/>
&gt; &gt;claw. Now being one that does not like to run around in the stupid West<br/>
&gt; &gt;Commonlands, or West Karana asking repetitively anyone have a werewolf on<br/>
&gt; &gt;tracking let me know! I got so bored and tired so I have decided to go to<br/>
&gt; &gt;Mistmoore and try to get to the dance floor. Now I have been to MM quite<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; &gt;few times but I have never been inside the castle barely even down the<br/>
ramp<br/>
&gt; &gt;towards the castle. mainly the Grave Yard and the zone line. Now I would<br/>
&gt; &gt;like some help on any suggestions or tips as to what to go or how to go<br/>
&gt; &gt;about getting to the Dance Room with the Gypsies/Werewolves....i.e. party<br/>
&gt; &gt;make up and level or a site where there might be a map. Thanks for your<br/>
&gt; &gt;help.<br/>
