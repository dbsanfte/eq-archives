<div id="ygrps-yiv-1532195403">Well after many hours in Paw, I have done this quest.  You just have to keep<br/>
killing Ren&#39;Rexx eventually phido does spawn.... The other two heads come<br/>
from Ghanex Drah who is a normal spawn, and the third comes from killing<br/>
High Shaman Grisok who is a random spawn for Shaman Lenrel...<br/>
I got Ghanex Drah&#39;s head easily, it took around 7 hours (non-consecitvly) of<br/>
fighting till I got the other two heads, as a coincidence both Grisok and<br/>
Phido spawned at the same time (was killing all three in a circle)<br/>

Hello, brothers and sisters...<br/>
<br/>
Just spent a long, frustrating night in Paw trying to get the head of Dareb.<br/>
I&#39;ve heard you get this item from High Shaman Phido, who is a rare spawn,<br/>
who shows up in place of Shaman Ren&#39;Rexx on occasion. Well, I killed Ren&#39;Rex<br/>
so many times I started feeling sorry for him &lt;g&gt;.  Does anyone know who to<br/>
get the head of Dareb? After questing for the headband items for weeks, I<br/>
don&#39;t feel bad about a spoiler at this point &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
