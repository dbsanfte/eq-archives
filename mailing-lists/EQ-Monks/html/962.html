<div id="ygrps-yiv-516522204">Nice of them to tell us.  If you look at the wording, the only reason<br/>
they bothered was because some had it as a spell.  If they nerf<br/>
mend or some other monk only skill, they will NEVER mention it in<br/>
the patch message, it seems.  Does this bother anyone else?<br/>

is still nerfed where it matter the most. and that is the higher levels.</div>
