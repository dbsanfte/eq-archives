<div id="ygrps-yiv-1154028745">Here is my 2 cp - I would have to agree that speed twinking really kills.<br/>
<br/>
I had a (now previous) character that was given a box of &quot;Quest item&quot; belts<br/>
to return to &quot;someone&quot; for experience, cash and a minor (sellable) item.<br/>
Well, with this first level character, it was an instant jump to level 4<br/>
with enough csh left over to buy some leather.<br/>
<br/>
Great.  Instant level 4 and plenty of skill points to play with.  Not by<br/>
half.  I have since abandoned the character because he can&#39;t pull his own<br/>
weight in combat or spells as his skills are way underdeveloped and a<br/>
monster that /cons blue still whups him hard enough that he has to sit for<br/>
20 minutes to regain hp & mana.<br/>
<br/>
My new character is less than a week (RL) old, nearly reached level 7,<br/>
hasn&#39;t twinked a thing and really kicks ass.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t recommend speed twinking to anyone.<br/>

&gt; Probably just you?<br/>
&gt; Not sure how you got your monk to level 4 with only 6 H2H, but I suppose<br/>
&gt; if youy hunted in groups it was possible.  Certainly by time youy hit mid<br/>
&gt; levels like 10+ you max out skills within the first buble of  a new level.<br/>
&gt; Skills are never a worry for me.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Only thing twinking does to me ( I assume other too) Make the game<br/>
boring<br/>
&gt; &gt; and soon forgotten.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I found that if I use cheat codes or twink I soon loose interest in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; chalange of the moment.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; For the same reason I dislike begger and those who consitly ask for a<br/>
hand<br/>
&gt; &gt; out.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Life is a hard life for a monk, give thanks for the things that pass by<br/>
your<br/>
&gt; &gt; way. To level with ggreat speed, is that hurting you more then not?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;  The qustion is, If a person Speed Levels( very quick EXPS) will his<br/>
skills<br/>
&gt; &gt; keep up, or will they lag behind?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I had a monk who whent to level 4 very quicky and only had H2H of 6 and<br/>
Kick<br/>
&gt; &gt; of 7, Was that just me or does speed kill?<br/>
