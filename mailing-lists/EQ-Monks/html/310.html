<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1029603578">West Commonlands is indeed much more populated with wisps.  Try to get SOW <br/>
from someone - offer a druid or shaman a few gold and say that you will <br/>
come to them, or try and find one and ask while you are there... If you <br/>
stay between the trail and the inn (directly west of where the trail is), <br/>
Giants will rarely bother you. Kizdean Gix is mean, but never bothered my <br/>
monk...  I usually roam around the hills surrounding the inn, and stay <br/>
close enough to the zone to make a run...  Other than than, bind yourself <br/>
to Qeynos and take the boat to Wisp (Kerra) Isle...  Find out where the <br/>
wisps spawn and camp there with a few other people... Good exp through <br/>
level 15 and excellent money...<br/>

First post to this list, woo.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m 11th lvl on the Prexus server, and just recently obtained woven gloves.<br/>
Since I can now actually hit them, I&#39;ve been searching for wisps in E<br/>
Commonlands and finding maybe one per hour of real time (!). Now, I know<br/>
it&#39;s a busy zone and that their heavily hunted there -- is there perhaps a<br/>
better place to find them? I&#39;ve been avoiding W Commons due to the<br/>
likelihood of being crushed by hill giants and/or smacked around by the<br/>
griffs, not to mention double-teamed by young kodiaks...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,<br/>
<br/>
