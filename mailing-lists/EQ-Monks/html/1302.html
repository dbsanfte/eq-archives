<div id="ygrps-yiv-290643977">Cured silk makes you look like a monk?  I would have to disagree, what<br/>
makes us look like monks are the fact that we look like newbies.  I<br/>
personally much prefer foreman&#39;s tunic.  Here is a comparison<br/>
<br/>
Cured Silk Gi<br/>

0.1wt<br/>
<br/>
Foreman&#39;s Tunic<br/>

+3str +3dex<br/>
WEIGHTLESS<br/>
<br/>
you have .1 less weight, 2 more ac, and +3 str.  Ok, so it looks leather<br/>
but who cares.  Once you get to 30 you won&#39;t wear anything that looks<br/>
like cured silk.  Thats because there is better stuff out there<br/>
