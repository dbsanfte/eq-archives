<div id="ygrps-yiv-1232879605">I am trying to figure out if I entered a period where FD becomes utterly useless, of if something was tweaked in the last patch.  Over the past few weeks when I FD, I normally succeed 9 out of 10 times.  Very RARELY did I ever get a &quot;Axlon has fallen to the ground&quot; message.  Now I get it about 4 out of 10 attempts.<br/>
<br/>
For background, I play Axlon Stormbringer (26 Level Monk on Karana).  My FD skill is around 120 at the moment. Not sure if it is maxed, but Its close.<br/>
<br/>
I have been spending alot of time in Cazic Thule, and have never had a problem FD&#39;ing on the lizzies there.  After the patch, I got the failed message, and even without the message, failed to trick the lizzies.  I have died 3 times since the patch. Before the patch I had died only ONCE since lvl 22 in Cazic.  FD had saved me probably more than a hundred times. (trains,trains,trains, and then more trains...ya know what I&#39;m talkin about :) )<br/>
<br/>
Whenever I attempt to FD, I always stop attacking, and wait 3-5 seconds.  I haven&#39;t changed the way I play, or the group I&#39;m with.  It just seems extremely odd that since the patch FD doesnt work as well.  I am not saying they nerfed it, but was wondering if I may be at the lvl where is fails alot. I notcied this from lvl 20-21...FD almost never worked. Then it got better.  <br/>
<br/>
Let me know if you all have noticed any difference. If ya haven&#39;t, I may be having a string of bad luck. If ya have, it might mean the demise of more monks out there.<br/>
<br/>
On the note about Monks vs. Warriors.  Did you all realize Warriors max for Bind Wounds is 100? That seems awfully low if ya ask me.  I&#39;m sure where these people play, that say Warriors didnt do alot of damage before the patch. Every warrior I have played with has done damage equal to or greater than me. I just Warriors would realize what Monks give up for our Melee skills.  I still don&#39;t understand why they should have better magic resistance!? I would think all that metal armour they have on would lower their resistance to electrical/heat/cold based attacks. I am still waiting for more observations.<br/>
<br/>
Just my little rant for the month.<br/>
