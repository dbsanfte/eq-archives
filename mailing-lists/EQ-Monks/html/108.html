<div id="ygrps-yiv-315409238">I don&#39;t know if this will help anyone looking for the Instill Doubt skill,<br/>
but as many of you are looking for this I thought I&#39;d post.  Let me know if<br/>
any of you get a chance to test this one!<br/>

&quot;At Level 26 Bards can learn a skill called &quot;Instill Doubt&quot;<br/>
It causes your target to walk away from you.<br/>
Only one NPC in the game is known to be able to train a bard in this:<br/>
Caskin Marsheart, who may be found on the 2nd story of the bard&#39;s guild in<br/>
Freeport.<br/>
It should be just above Common in the list of skills.<br/>
Thanks and credit goes to the Concert Hall, a great site for bards. {<br/>
