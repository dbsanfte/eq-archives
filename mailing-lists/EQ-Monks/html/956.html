<div id="ygrps-yiv-648148451">This is a very shitty thing for them to do. But here is what we must do. We<br/>
all have to band together and Feedback the hell out of them. I mean if a Mob<br/>
goes all the way back to its resting place but then can come after us and<br/>
kill us what kind of BS is that. Besides from 300 yards away behind walls<br/>
and door and deep below where we feigned death how would anything let alone<br/>
a mob know that we got up. Very suspect if you ask me. So all of us need to<br/>
Feedback the hell out of varent. If you don&#39;t think it will work all I have<br/>
to say is look back to when they nerfed the Box of Abu Kar.<br/>

&gt; You are not wrong. I died in Unrest last night. I<br/>
&gt; feigned then got up after a while my buds said the<br/>
&gt; zone was clear. We got back to work and about 5 mins<br/>
&gt; later the ghouls and a hag came screaming out of the<br/>
&gt; house looking for Monk blood. I really feel like<br/>
&gt; Verant bent us over on this one!<br/>
