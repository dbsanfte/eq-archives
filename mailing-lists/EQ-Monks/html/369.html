<div id="ygrps-yiv-64936790">You guys were talking about showing the sash&#39;s and such as an animation the<br/>
reason that its not been implemented is that EverQuest has to work on<br/>
Voodoo1&#39;s and such which would take forever to load the colors and such for<br/>
people with machines that have those type of graphics cards this was<br/>
straight from Verant.</div>
