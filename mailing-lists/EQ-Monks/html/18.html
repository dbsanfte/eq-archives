&gt; Greetings Brothers,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Kicks are magic as soon as you put on the gloves for<br/>
&gt; some reason...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am not complaining...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Be well all,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Like the other guy said, your kicks are magical, &#39;cause all of the monk&#39;s<br/>
special attacks are magical, at least as far as I&#39;ve read.  I don&#39;t think<br/>
just Kick is but you get Round Kick at such a low level (before you even<br/>
need to consider taking on magic-only enemies) that you don&#39;t really have to<br/>
worry about your special attack being magical, just need to worry about your<br/>
hands.  I also heard rumors about your attacks being magical at level 17 but<br/>
I would think most would have looked for magic gloves by then anyway, so I<br/>
don&#39;t really know, and I suspect it&#39;s false.  If anyone knows this rumor to<br/>
be true or false, please reply :)</div>
