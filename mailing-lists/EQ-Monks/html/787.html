<div id="ygrps-yiv-902778502">OK I Love my DC and NFL2K but Pro level is impossible to run on (Had ricky <br/>
williams and and O-line i traded for of all 99+ and still avergeade 3.0 y/c <br/>
my first three games --wtf?) and rookie is a bomb td whenever you want and <br/>
an 8 yrad averga no matter the line.. now back to eq.<br/>
<br/>
1.) LJ vs Cured Tunic----Is the +4ac and +5sta worth it or be 3.5 lbs <br/>
lighter, thats alot of coin to carry back?<br/>
2.) BOBS vs Cured Silk Bracres?  Worth the camp for em and the lose of <br/>
weight? Can you have to BOE&#39;s or only 1 since they are lore?<br/>
3.) Group of level 20&#39;s whats a good place?<br/>
Mistmoore is a nightmare<br/>
OrcHighway is a alittle to low level<br/>
Maze is good as far as I can tell, good exp good loot, and alwyas funny to <br/>
be charmed by the eye and dragged around for 3 minutes or tobeat on your <br/>
friends, alwyas good gg there.<br/>
Unrest, not fond of lawn trash though full group of 20&#39;s I guess should <br/>
handle the first floor<br/>
Anybody know about SOL A or B or Cazic, when should those be pimped?</div>
