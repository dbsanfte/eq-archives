 </span></blockquote>Having been through the same sort of thing, let me share a few of my<br/>
thoughts, and give you some ideas of where to hunt.<br/>
<br/>
First off, try heading down to Guk.  It sounds like you&#39;re in the area<br/>
anyway, and you can accomplish a few things at the same time by heading<br/>
down there.  First, you can pick up lots of netted and woven armor from<br/>
the frogs.  If you&#39;re lucky, you may find somebody selling some mesh<br/>
for cheap.  Of course, if you alreay have mesh...  Try to fight the<br/>
Froglok Guards, and perhaps even Tuks.  Avoid Gaz or Ton unless you<br/>
have a very good group.  Anyway, you can also pick up some pretty good<br/>
XP from the frogs, or, you can solo the crocs that are in Guk.  They<br/>
are worth huge XP for that level.  I don&#39;t remember exactly which level<br/>
I started soloing them, but it was somewhere right around 16 or 17. <br/>
With one other group member, you shouldn&#39;t have too much trouble at<br/>
all.<br/>
<br/>
Another suggestion for hunting ground would be Unrest.  It does tend to<br/>
be crowded, but at 16, you can fight the &quot;lawn trash&quot; that most people<br/>
just ignore.  There are death beetles, tormented dead, and greater<br/>
skeletons that would be very good hunting.  You may need to get in a<br/>
small group to do it, but you shouldn&#39;t have much trouble finding a<br/>
group in Unrest.  Just stay off to the sides, away from the path, and<br/>
you should be Ok.  Unrest is a really scary place, but there are some<br/>
really nice rewards.<br/>
<br/>
You could also head over to Black Burrow and beat up some Gnoll Elites<br/>
and Commanders.  You can gather up pretty good amounts of loot in BB,<br/>
plus you can get some great XP at the same time.  You can usually get<br/>
into the rotation in one of the commander rooms (where up to 5<br/>
commanders and elites spawn) or just camp one of the spots where just<br/>
one spawns.  It&#39;s not much fun camping alone, but can be interesting in<br/>
one of the larger rooms with people to talk to.<br/>
<br/>
You could try Befallen, but I really, truly hate that place.  I&#39;ve died<br/>
more times in there than I care to think about.<br/>
<br/>
Paw is a great place to go too if you can get into a group.  You can<br/>
beat up nobles and even commanders, plus maybe take a shot at some of<br/>
the named gnolls.  Plus, you can collect the stuff needed for your red<br/>
headband.<br/>
<br/>
Well, there are several ideas, and the top two are my favorites.  I<br/>
still really enjoy hanging out in Unrest or Guk.  If you want any other<br/>
info, feel free to ask.<br/>
<br/>
Now, on to my blues, can anybody give me any ideas of where to hunt at<br/>
level 22?  Specifically, Unrest is great, but a little too crowded at<br/>
my level, unless I can get into a room and camp it.  Guk is good, but<br/>
it&#39;s very hard to get a group going.  Runnyeye scares the hell out of<br/>
me with the giant trains of Dazed and Crazed Goblins that come pouring<br/>
up on a regular basis.  Highpass would be good if it weren&#39;t for all<br/>
the kill stealing.  I guess I could just use a few new ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Also, what should I be looking for for equipment?  I have a full set of<br/>
Mesh, LJ Tunic, Leering Mask, Red Headband, Collar of Undead<br/>
Protection, two Gold Wedding Rings (+5 AGI), two Onyx Earrings (+2<br/>
AGI), and a thick leather apron.  I currently have about 75 PP, and I&#39;m<br/>
wondering if there&#39;s anything specifically I should be looking for at<br/>
my level and monetary situation.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, sorry about the long rambling post, and good luck to you all!<br/>
