<div id="ygrps-yiv-897241423">Alternatively, since the first few sash quests are &quot;item&quot; quests, you can <br/>
get the sashes without needing faction by asking a Freeport Monk to turn <br/>
them in for you.<br/>
<br/>
I performed this favour for a visting Qeynos Monk, who was kind enough to <br/>
pay me with the Legionnaire Bracer I needed as the last item for my Orange <br/>
sash!<br/>

&gt;You have to raise your faction.  Ive found one way to raise faction with <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;ashen order, but i don&#39;t know how many times you have to do it to get good<br/>
&gt;enough faction with ashen order to get sash.  It is the tomer quest!  In<br/>
&gt;qeynos there is a quest to find tomer (saying that seta sent you to find<br/>
&gt;him) and take him to the guild.  I only did it 2-3 times and wasn&#39;t able to<br/>
&gt;do, so i dunno.<br/>
