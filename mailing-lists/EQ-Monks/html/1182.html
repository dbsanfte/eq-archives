<b>Subject:</b> Some more on Mend <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-677586344">For me mend has ben a greatly useful skill.  I am 16 and it works 80% of the time, but people keep on talking about how it heals them 2 bubbles.  For me it heals for a little more that one bubble and that&#39;s it.  Can anyone tell me if something is wrong?<br/>
