<div id="ygrps-yiv-1731461891"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Are the headbands and sash quests worth it?  Is the Ac/stat bonus merit<br/>
&gt;the time it takes to get these items? I was just wondering because I met a<br/>
&gt;level 35 monk who says she never did any of the quests and feels that the<br/>
&gt;items given are not worth the trouble.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>	Sadly, and despite my rampant enthusiasm in completing <br/>
quests, the resultant items are nowhere near worth it in terms of <br/>
time nor plat required to acquire the quest items.  I remember how <br/>
neat it was to get my first white training sash... it was the first <br/>
&#39;magic&#39; item of any kind that I had ever owned.  But soon the items <br/>
required to obtain higher sashes demanded levels the normal <br/>
acheivement of which would give you better items in any event!<br/>
	I have acquired the purple headband and the red sash and <br/>
haven&#39;t really used anything since that initial white sash (which was <br/>
quickly replaced with a woven belt, as I recall).  Recently, I&#39;ve <br/>
sporadically used the purple headband because the only other decent <br/>
head items I had access to was a Blackened Iron Crown which was FAR <br/>
too heavy to use practically.  This is a temporary solution until I <br/>
can get my hands on an Executioner&#39;s Hood, at which point the band <br/>
will go back into the bank.  (If I still had my Mesh headpiece, I&#39;d <br/>
use that instead.)<br/>
	I don&#39;t see this situation changing, as the stats I&#39;ve seen <br/>
on the Blue and Black items (looted from the corpses of trainers) are <br/>
nothing to get excited about either.  Personally, I&#39;ll probably get <br/>
them (when the quests are implemented, that is) solely because I&#39;m a <br/>
stubborn S.O.B. and not because they have any real use. :(<br/>
