<b>Subject:</b> Re: [EQ Monks] An idea for the slow day <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-117092403">Actually, there is a claw fisted sort of weapon, looks like a plate<br/>
glove with 3 or 4 blades coming out of it.  But its a 1 hand slashing<br/>
weapon.  Really expensive, I think....  But still, something like that that<br/>
had charges of poison or some other spell that could be refilled with a<br/>
special item would be really interesting.. (For instance, serum of slowness,<br/>
that would DOT and slow the creature down, and would require some item<br/>
gained off a creature to replenish.)  Monks are indefinitely cool, but we<br/>
could all use a refreshing new addition.  Maybe a cool graphic for our<br/>
sashes/headbands would be good too.....  And a manuever that tosses your<br/>
enemy back would be good for feigning.   Nail em away then walk off a few<br/>
steps and feign.  You could get it at 15 or something and the distance you<br/>
throw the enemy could be skill based...  And quite considerable at high<br/>
levels. =)<br/>
<br/>
     Also....  Is there anyone out there who plays Xegony who is absolutely<br/>
swamped with spare platinum and has nothing to do with it?  I need armor so<br/>
badly...   things that con white to me may as well con red..<br/>
