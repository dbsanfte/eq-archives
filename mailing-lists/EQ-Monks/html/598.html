&lt;&lt; it is not about jealousy. It is about taking pride in actually earning the<br/>
 gear I wear and knowing that what I have, I got for myself, whether by<br/>
 earning coin enough to buy it or by venturing and slaying the beast that<br/>
 carries it. I got it. I did not have it handed to me on a silver platter by<br/>
 some high level friend who already has no problem getting as many as he<br/>
 wants.<br/>
 <br/>
 Kind of like that spoiled rich kid in high school who was driving the<br/>
 Corvette. Sure he looks cool, but you know damn well he didn&#39;t pay for it or<br/>
 the insurance that comes with it. Would I like to own a vette? you bet.<br/>
 Would I take one if my folks offered it to me? hell no. All a matter of self<br/>
 pride vs. selfishness &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 Jealousy. Who cares what else anyone has, simply because they had it handed <br/>
to them? If you are essentially concerned with what you&#39;ve earned, then why <br/>
does what others have bother you so much? It sounds like envy, and it at <br/>
best, reactive, rather than proactive. Bottled up ressentiment expressing <br/>
itself.<br/>
<br/>
 I am not twinked. Everything I have, I have earned. But the fact that <br/>
someone else has not is irrelevant to me (unless I am harmed by it, as in the <br/>
PoF example someone gave earlier.) Be proud of what you&#39;ve earned, and do <br/>
your best to have fun.<br/>
<br/>
 Just my thoughts on this matter... And btw, Praelor, I have enjoyed many of <br/>
your thoughtful posts. I disagree with you about this, though.</div>
