<br/>
1. Bard<br/>
2. Wizard<br/>
3. Wizard<br/>
4. Wizard<br/>
5. Wizard<br/>
6. Enchanter<br/>
<br/>
         The fight won&#39;t last long if everyone in the group knows how to <br/>
use /assist and the Enchanter does their job of crowd control. This is a <br/>
group of 32+. The Bard will have Cassindra&#39;s Chorus of Clarity (The MANA <br/>
song) and the Enchanter has Clarity. Wizards should have little downtime. <br/>
They will play ping-pong with that Mob. Bard can juggle Hymn of Restoration <br/>
if HPS are needed. Oh yeah, if it gets sticky you have 4 Wizzes, so Evacs <br/>
should be easy to get off.<br/>

&gt;Here you go, the ultimate party, around lvl 40+<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1- Monk<br/>
&gt;2- Monk<br/>
&gt;3- Monk<br/>
&gt;4- Enchanter<br/>
&gt;5- Druid<br/>
&gt;6- Cleric<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;With fbss and the enchanter&#39;s celerity (39) or swift like wind (49) the monks<br/>
&gt;can dish an AMAZING amount of dmg.  Enchanter can slow down mobs, and give<br/>
&gt;all 3 caster types mana faster.  Cleric heals and buffs.  Druids have some<br/>
&gt;nice DD and DOTS, snare and back up heal.  If you can think of a better group<br/>
&gt;plz tell me cause I don&#39;t think there is.  No resisting and don&#39;t need a<br/>
&gt;taunt as the casters more than likely aren&#39;t gonna get jumped.  Not to<br/>
&gt;mention, if one of the monks is getting beaten too badly, FD and mob will<br/>
&gt;jump to another of them.  If you have ever seen this kind of group in action,<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll agree with me.<br/>
