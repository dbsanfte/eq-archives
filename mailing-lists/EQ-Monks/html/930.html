<div id="ygrps-yiv-1556035871">I don&#39;t quite understand what you two are talking about, I have been in<br/>
lower guk since the young age of 28, and I have always been able to single<br/>
pull mobs, using the same technique i used every (except Sol A where i had<br/>
to modify it).<br/>
<br/>
Keep your group out of the aggro range of the mob, get near the mobs u want<br/>
to break up, then choose one and throw a star at him.  Al the mobs will<br/>
come, run back to an area that is safe distance from your group, and feign.<br/>
When all but 1 or 2 (or how ever many you want) run away, get up and start<br/>
punching, then turn around and run to your group.  I&#39;ve *never* had a<br/>
problem with this, i&#39;ve broken the frenzy, king, lord  rooms.  Not to<br/>
mention i did quite a bit of pulling from the waterfalls to zone, or BR to<br/>
zone..<br/>
