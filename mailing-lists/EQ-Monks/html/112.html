<div id="ygrps-yiv-213138763">Do NOT spend points on offensive anything. They will develope fast enough in <br/>
combat. Save them for later. Put one or two practices into a new skill and <br/>
then leave it. for example your next big skill is Sneak just put one or two <br/>
and then practice it just by itself.<br/>
I would not worry about learning throwing. In my opinion it doesn&#39;t do a <br/>
whole lot.<br/>
