 </span></blockquote>	Ah... I looked up the stats on them and they don&#39;t seem to be <br/>
all that impressive to me, to tell you the truth.  There are better <br/>
rings out there for much less hassle.  You could get the gold <br/>
carnelian or the Platinum Black Pearl stuff from an enchanger (major <br/>
boosts to AGI and DEX) or simply go for the Jagged Band approach if <br/>
you&#39;ve already reached the point of diminishing returns for AGI and <br/>
DEX and would like to just have some nice, raw AC. :)<br/>
