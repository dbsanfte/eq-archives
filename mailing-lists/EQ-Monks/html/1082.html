<div id="ygrps-yiv-2135521174">Personally in my experieinces so far the only place FD is better now is for<br/>
pullin VOX and also good if you aggro the right giant pulling FG&#39;s. I dont<br/>
mind laying on the ground during fights like these when there is a greater<br/>
goal at hand.<br/>

&gt; I haven&#39;t been told that, in those exact words - but I have found slower<br/>
&gt; (And fewer) responses to &quot;Monk looking for work&quot; shouts.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And there have been some heated battles between know-it-all wizards,<br/>
necros<br/>
&gt; and druids who tell me that FD does to still work and I&#39;m just not good at<br/>
&gt; it :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I had a lot more to say on the subject but then I&#39;d be whining and it&#39;s<br/>
just<br/>
&gt; a game.<br/>

&gt; Ok i posted this question on another board and got zero response.  I will<br/>
&gt; try one more time before I give up.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Since the feign death patch, has any high level monk been told &quot;No we<br/>
don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; want you to group with us because you can&#39;t feign death pull&quot;?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; thanks<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;If I had to speculate, I&#39;d say that the changes to feign death, or<br/>
perhaps<br/>
&gt; &gt;more accurately now, non-monks perceptions of monks due to the changes in<br/>
&gt; &gt;feign death, negatively impact the ability of monks to continue to<br/>
explore<br/>
&gt; &gt;the social aspect of the game, i.e., difficulty getting into groups of<br/>
&gt; &gt;strangers, thus not being able to share in a group activity and make new<br/>
&gt; &gt;friends, etc., that is the most damaging aspect of what has transpired<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; &gt;the core root of the anger and outrage many monks express.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Just my thoughts...take them for that and nothing more.<br/>
