&lt;&lt; There is practically no use in NOT messing up you faction in Guk. <br/>
eventually<br/>
 you will want to go to Lguk and get some of the good monk stuff down there<br/>
 and you have to kill live and dead froggies to get it not to mention the few<br/>
 good monk items in Uguk (IE Mesh, silverplated bracers, collar of undead<br/>
 protection). As soon as you kill one live froggie or one Mino in Lguk your<br/>
 AOS to all live froggies in guk. By the time your High enought level to want<br/>
 to go to Lguk alot you wont really have to worry about the froggies In Uguk<br/>
 you can feign them easy get an invis etc. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 I think this is incorrect.<br/>
 First, I can&#39;t tell you how many times I have seen individuals or parties <br/>
harassed by the live frogs just inside Lower Guk. These are generally not a <br/>
threat, but to weakened parties or individuals soloing (or getting their <br/>
corpses), they can constitute quite a problem. And, with the exception of the <br/>
evil races, being attacked by the good frogs is entirely a problem of one&#39;s <br/>
own creation. I enjoy the fact that, since I never killed the good frogs in <br/>
upper guk, I can walk by them with impunity.<br/>
 Moreover, &quot;killing just one frog in lower&quot; does not automatically make you <br/>
KOS. During some emergency situations, I have been forced to kill live frogs <br/>
to help wounded party members who were being attacked by the lives near the <br/>
zone (in lower.) I have never been other than dubious to them.<br/>
 And yes, the lives in Upper Guk aren&#39;t much of a threat anymore when you&#39;re <br/>
able to go to Lower. But since we can&#39;t invis, it can still be a pain to have <br/>
a train of frogs all chasing you to the zone (even if most of them miss.... :)<br/>
