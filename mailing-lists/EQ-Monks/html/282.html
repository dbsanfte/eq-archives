<div id="ygrps-yiv-836940540">You have to raise your faction.  Ive found one way to raise faction with the <br/>
ashen order, but i don&#39;t know how many times you have to do it to get good <br/>
enough faction with ashen order to get sash.  It is the tomer quest!  In <br/>
qeynos there is a quest to find tomer (saying that seta sent you to find <br/>
him) and take him to the guild.  I only did it 2-3 times and wasn&#39;t able to <br/>
do, so i dunno.</div>
