<div id="ygrps-yiv-965373392">There really isn&#39;t anything that close anywhere...you can go to NK and<br/>
sell there or you can go to the centaurs and sell there.  My advice is<br/>
that if you get someone that can sell for you if you have a friend you<br/>
trust enough to do this.  Some times also there is someone in the zone<br/>
that is doing ATM stuff and will buy things from you (bronze,etc.) The<br/>
aviaks will sell to wood elves fine.  The centaurs will sell to anyone<br/>
but they aren&#39;t too close.  I don&#39;t remember but I think that the<br/>
aviaks sell bandages...or there is usually lots of mages running<br/>
around.   If worse comes to worst you can get a mage to summon you<br/>
some.  I have seen them sold in zone often.  Anyway..just my 2 cents<br/>
worth.<br/>

&gt; However, I have one problem.  Where can I sell?  the<br/>
&gt; Aviak merchant won&#39;t sell to humans and I would really<br/>
&gt; like to find a place to buy bandages.  Is their<br/>
&gt; anywhere relatively NEAR the aviak town where this can<br/>
