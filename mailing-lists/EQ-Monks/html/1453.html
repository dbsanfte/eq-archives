<div id="ygrps-yiv-790003923">Thanks everyone for the info on not using special skills when trying ID.  I<br/>
didn&#39;t know that and have been using it wrong.  (    I push tiger claw as<br/>
fast as I can, hehe, most of the time I hit it before it comes up as being<br/>
ready.  <br/>
<br/>
Hopefully I&#39;ll have better luck in the future with ID now.  <br/>

		at an ID skill lvl of 108 I can suscesfully pass the skill<br/>
check multiple<br/>
		times a fight against a hard blue.<br/>
<br/>
		I was able to solo the firescale crock (~lvl 30) at lvl 33,<br/>
with id<br/>
		working 3 times, 2 of thoes were back to back.<br/>
<br/>
		id put every point into it you can, then go out and purchace<br/>
a gravis<br/>
		digital extream game pad, and set up a macro to practice it<br/>
over night.<br/>
		(you dont have to fear something to make a skill increase,<br/>
so I target a<br/>
		mecrchent and go feign next to a guard).<br/>
<br/>
		also, as someone mentioned, you cannot have a special skill<br/>
greyed out<br/>
		when the skill check happens (the your not scaring anyone<br/>
message). so I<br/>
		alternate between flying kick and ID.</div>
