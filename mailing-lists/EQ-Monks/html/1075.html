<div id="ygrps-yiv-13688970"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; No bridge, but they should have played some tag, hide and <br/>
&gt; seek, kickball,<br/>
&gt; hopscotch, monopoly...social contact in games is, I hope, not <br/>
&gt; new at all.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But none of those can you turn on or off when you feel like it as you can<br/>
EQ. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Monks can&#39;t.  Verant believes the ability of classes to pull so safely<br/>
&gt; at high levels was simply too powerful, and thus they took it <br/>
&gt; out of the<br/>
&gt; game.  Half the power of FD is gone; its time to learn to <br/>
&gt; live with the<br/>
&gt; change.  There is no work around, monks need to suck it up and go on.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Perhaps, perhaps not.  Some are expressing some of their old success since<br/>
the last patch.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Formal, well thought out complaints are fine, but I find <br/>
&gt; statements like<br/>
&gt; &quot;Its more than a game, gimmie FD back&quot; just plain silly.  How many<br/>
&gt; weeks of venting do I have to endure?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So why argue back?  Surely you can see that it doesn&#39;t help, and just<br/>
extends it that much longer.  Nothing you can do is going to make the<br/>
argument/venting be over any sooner other than expressing your symapthies.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I play a wizard...I have watched them take away our easy <br/>
&gt; root/nuke/nuke<br/>
&gt; strategy.  I watched them take away our escape tool, jboots.  <br/>
&gt; I watched<br/>
&gt; them take away our toy, manastone.  Each time I suck it up.  I still<br/>
&gt; have friends, I still meet new people.  My power is greatly reduced<br/>
&gt; still.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, and so have my other characters been nerfed, so what?  You don&#39;t see me<br/>
yelling/arguing back.  It doesn&#39;t help.  Offer constructive counter<br/>
arguments, yes, but saying, in a sense &quot;You are a bunch of whiners who need<br/>
to shut up&quot; is not going to make anyone stop complaining, nor adjust their<br/>
point of view to the position that maybe it&#39;s not so bad.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; But The game is just a game.  Monks have been tuned (nerfed), life<br/>
&gt; and game go on.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Fine, you&#39;ve moved beyond it.  Others haven&#39;t.  No reason to extend this<br/>
thread further by calling them whiners and telling the to suck it up and<br/>
live with it.  It&#39;s just plain inflamatory and extends the thread even<br/>
further.  It you really are tire of hearing it and want the thread to die<br/>
off, then stop responding and let it die off.  Unless you are the list<br/>
admin, there&#39;s no other way you can end the thread.<br/>
