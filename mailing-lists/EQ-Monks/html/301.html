<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1828266392">Here is my rule when looking for armor/weight.<br/>
1.) Adhere to the 14 pound rule. Also remember that it does no good being 14 <br/>
pounds if in the first 5 five fight you pick 2 pounds in coin so plan to go <br/>
to 10 so you can gain some coin and not be over the mythical 14 number.<br/>
2.) When picking armor it doesnt matter about the weight or the ac. What <br/>
matters is the ac/weight ratio. Somes item give you a ratio of like 1 ac to <br/>
1 pound, these are bad, try to get things like leather bracers, give you ac3 <br/>
to wieght 1, much better then say boots of ac4 to weight 2.5. So mix and <br/>
maych to see what ac/weight ratio works best! Ths is very important in <br/>
leather since all of the items have very skewed ac/weight ratios. I <br/>
persoanlly reccomend the cap, ac4 weight.6 (great ratio) and the bracers <br/>
(ac3 weight 1, and yo get 2 of em!), i cant remeber what the sleeves were? I <br/>
know the pants were down right evil and the tunic wasnt so hot either I <br/>
think!<br/>

&quot;Suit up, roll out, it&#39;s dasiy chompin time!&quot;</div>
