<div id="ygrps-yiv-2032066857">Just picked up snakeskin gloves last night in paw.  My question:  Do these<br/>
hit magical, i.e. Ghouls and Ice Bones?  Or do I need to hang on to my<br/>
already over-used Mesh Gauntlets?  The dex bonus on those babies is nice,<br/>
and I would hate to have to hot key switching gloves around :)<br/>
 <br/>
And if you&#39;re wondering why I&#39;m asking instead of just trying it out, it&#39;s<br/>
because I was tired and couldn&#39;t track down something magical where I was<br/>
