<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-967511151">hi there people and fellow monks.<br/>
im just wondering if there are any Monk Guilds out there.<br/>
im really interested in joining one. Im a monk on Rodset Nife server<br/>
and if there is one on there that you know about please let me know.<br/>
If there isnt one yet, i would like any monk in that server to unite<br/>
under my banner and join me in my quest to make one.<br/>
thanks for you time.</div>
