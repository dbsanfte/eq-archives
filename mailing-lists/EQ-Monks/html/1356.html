&gt;Um, I know lots of melees who have killed Hadden against a KSing Caster,<br/>
&gt;take him into water, spells don&#39;t have an effect.  or so I have heard<br/>
&gt;--<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hammeron<br/>
&gt;Monk of Quellious<br/>
&gt;Karana<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>hmm i never thought of that...good idea, i&#39;ll have to try that someday.<br/>
<br/>
