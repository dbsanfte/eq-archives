<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I thought that my troll shaman would be a great 
canadate to take to Kunark, cause he was evil and worshiped the same god as the 
monks of the Iskar.&nbsp; Man was I wrong.&nbsp; The only thing so far I have 
found in kurnark that are NOT hostile to my trollie, is the little town in The 
Overthere, which is a bunch of evil races in an encapment.&nbsp; If I wasn&#39;t a 
shaman, I couldn&#39;t bind there, and I cant hunt there because everything is blood 
red, and scowling.&nbsp; I made my way to the iskar city, with a little luck and 
help from sow, and found they are scowling and ready to attack.&nbsp; So I made 
my way to the good elf encampent, and guess what?&nbsp; Scowling no less.&nbsp; 
Does any one know of a race that the iskar ARE friendly to?</font></div>

  <div><br></div><tt>well being evil is a pain in the ass unless you are willing 
  to work on factions.<br>i was just pointing out that being able to kill goodie 
  goodie guards is not one<br>of the advantages to being evil, since the goodie 
  goodie races kill goodie goodie<br>guards as well.&nbsp; and actually maybe 
  have an easier time of it than evil<br>races, since they could kill guards til 
  faction drops to apprehensive and then<br>do quests to knock it back up again, 
  whereas the evil folks have a hell of<br>a time doing side quests just so they 
  can get non-kos so they can do the real<br>faction quests.<br><br>At 11:29 AM

  NOT the bad thing that a lot make it<br>&gt;out to be.&nbsp; It&#39;s actually 
  quite a good thing in many ways.<br>&gt;<br><br></tt>
