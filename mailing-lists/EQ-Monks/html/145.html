<div id="ygrps-yiv-1145426471">unfortunately, yes, this is supposed to happen. Supposedly there is a radius<br/>
of aggression which, once the critter has passed it, it will not return, but<br/>
I have never had a monster forget about me. The funniest was running from a<br/>
brigand in the Karanas (West I think it was). I FD (was on a corpse<br/>
retreival run and in no mood to fight this thing), wait, run, FD, wait,<br/>
run... repeat all the way to North Karanas Zone. I was laughing so hard I<br/>
cant believe the dumb brigand didn&#39;t know I was alive!  =D<br/>

&gt; : tells a quick story of woe<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Once uopn a time there was a Monk who was going to Freepoet after getting<br/>
&gt; her red headband in Qeynos she was all the way to the west Commans when<br/>
&gt; she<br/>
&gt; happened upon a hill Giant who decided to step on her.  She feigned death<br/>
&gt; the Giant thinking he had killed our heroine walk off and started crushing<br/>
&gt; people in derv camp which was was pretty far  away she could barely see it<br/>
&gt; in the distance.  Rather hurt the Monk stood and mended her wounds.  The<br/>
&gt; Giant who was no were near her can RUNNING BACK and procceded to kill her.<br/>
&gt; She rewake in Qeynos were she was bound and started the long run back to<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; commans and her body woundering why the Hill Giant came running back just<br/>
&gt; for her.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The end.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; : Adds a quick almost tale of Woe<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Later while she was in East Karana she was jumped by a goruge hound she<br/>
&gt; ran<br/>
&gt; to the gaurds already hurt and bleeding from a fight with a Gnoll, seeing<br/>
&gt; the gurads of the fishing village (though they were trying there best to<br/>
&gt; kill it) would not be able to before it killed her in time she feigned<br/>
&gt; death.  The hound looked at her for a moment and walked off she opened an<br/>
&gt; eye and looked around for a few minutes to make sure it was NO WERE in<br/>
&gt; sight<br/>
&gt; before standing up she even had time to sit down to try to heal when all<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; a sudden IT CAME RUNNING BACK!  Luckally the gurads were able to slay the<br/>
&gt; thing in time (lived by 23 hps).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The end (for real this time)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So heres the question: ummmm is this whats soposed to happen?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Palerose 19th circle Monk of the Ashen order who thinks its about time she<br/>
&gt; looked in to buying more mesh armor.<br/>
