<b>Subject:</b> Oasis Question <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1541756426">I am a level 12 (nearly 13) freeport monk who is<br/>
really happy the way in which his character is going. <br/>
I think the truly great thing about the monk is that<br/>
in lower levels we don&#39;t have near as many expensizes<br/>
as other races.  Like at 12 I have 50plat in bank and<br/>
I would have 80 except yesterday I bought a Lockjaw<br/>
hide vest and a snakeskin mask.  All the other people<br/>
around my level seem to be short on cash.<br/>
<br/>
On to my question, at what level can I go into oasis. <br/>
I mean so I can walk in solo and still kill some guys<br/>
while I am trying to find a group?<br/>
