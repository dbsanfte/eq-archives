<div id="ygrps-yiv-94101559">I just got Feign death and I have been practicing it.  I haven&#39;t had a problem<br/>
with it and am learning how to use it.  I did see something regarding Feign<br/>
Death on EQ vault that I found interesting.  I will post it here: <br/>
<br/>
Feign Death Spell <br/>
Verant Interent Relations Manager Gordon Wrinn made a post about a new bug<br/>
discovered in EQ. The following post is from the Gameplay forum: <br/>
A bug has been brought to our attention. A necromancer can sic their pet<br/>
(charmed or summoned) upon a critter, load on DOT spells, and then cast Feign<br/>
Death. The pet remains, fighting the critter, and the critter ignores the<br/>
necromancer despite all of the damage being done by the DOTs. <br/>
What *should* happen is that the pet should behave as if the owner hid or<br/>
became invisible. That is, the pet should suicide if summomed, or should<br/>
uncharm if charmed. <br/>
Our inclination is that we should fix this bug, because the tactic is pretty<br/>
lame and allows the necromancer to do things they shouldn&#39;t be able to do,<br/>
such<br/>
as soloing high level critters in closed quarters. <br/>
So, should we change this? Or leave it as is? <br/>

This is the same company that changed our version of Feign Death without any<br/>
input from the people who play the game.  Why are they suddenly asking for<br/>
opinions?  I say it should be changed, if just to level the playing field.  I<br/>
guess this goes to prove thast if you play a popular class you get special<br/>
benefits, but if you are the minority you get walked all over. Oh, well all<br/>
the<br/>
Necros will scream that it would be unfair to take away this unbalancing &quot;bug&quot;<br/>
and we will still get stuck with our nerfed FD.<br/>
