<div id="ygrps-yiv-507527072">No idea about the lvl of captain and cube. May be around 25 ?<br/>
Anyway, since we are on the same server, give me a tell if we are both<br/>
around the zone, and I will try to pull them to zone. I did it several times<br/>
for other fellow monks while I was camping that #@$@%!^#%&$%# alchemist in<br/>
the gorge. They are pretty common spawns, so we can be lucky.<br/>

I&#39;m remembering back when I was a young&#39;un many months ago, that I did see<br/>
the alchemist spawn inside the tent at the camp right by RunnyEye.  I could<br/>
be wrong, but I honestly remember it spawning there.  I&#39;ll camp the other<br/>
tent now, though. :)<br/>
<br/>
As for the gelatinous cube and goblin captain in Runny, what level are they?<br/>
I know approximately where to find them, but have no idea what level they<br/>
are.  Some friends owe me a favor for helping them camp things for their<br/>
quests, so I&#39;m gonna call in the favor. :)<br/>
