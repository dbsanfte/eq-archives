<div id="ygrps-yiv-1376854685">Doh!  Don&#39;t know how I missed that . . Oh well . . . guess I have to wait till<br/>
I&#39;m higher, and can bring a few buddies.  I hate quests that you have to<br/>
mobilize a group for, and the common spawns don&#39;t drop much.<br/>

&gt; ahh no.<br/>
&gt; Patriach drops azure sleeves (ebony blade rare)<br/>
&gt; Elder drops cryosbyl talisman and some mask.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And on Tarew Marr they are not camped that regularly.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I&#39;m assuming that since the elder drops the azure sleves that he&#39;s perma-camped.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Am I pretty safe in assuming that?<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Is everyone dead?  I finally got the essence of Dol and baton.  I had to save<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; up 3kp to get it.  (Luckily, my wife quit eq, so I got to sell all of her stuff,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and managed to get 4.2kp out of it)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So, I&#39;m hanging out in Dalnir, praying that I manage to get some crescent armor.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But, I&#39;ve started jonesing for quests again.  What level do I have to be to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; start trying to get the Robe of the Lost circle?  I&#39;d prefer to go with a small<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; group of a bit higher than me (say a group of 3 35s-40s), or a full group of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; low 30s.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Well you should have the sash and headband already if not get em<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; already.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Any chance in hell I can camp the spawns at that level?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; The rock in solB is in the king room. It takes a full group of 6 35&#39;s to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; camp that room (and even then the king will most likely wipe you out).<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Or just a few of 45&#39;s. The raster area is much more campable at that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; level but still all the mobs are 35 (cept for the elder not sure on its<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; level).<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
