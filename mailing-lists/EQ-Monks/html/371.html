&gt; &gt;It&#39;s a little late to change the looks of characters (i.e.: adding the blue<br/>
&gt; &gt;look to monks with a mesh tunic, etc) because it would require a total<br/>
&gt; &gt;rework of the art files. Anyone remember those lovely 300 meg downloads in<br/>
&gt; &gt;beta 3?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not sure I understand this.  Didn&#39;t they add an entire zone (or maybe<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s even more than one zone, I don&#39;t know), the plane of fear?  Did we<br/>
&gt; download everything necessary for that zone?  If so, I find it difficult to<br/>
&gt; believe that a few new texture would be that large an addition.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think they should have made the graphics a lot more flexible.  It is not a very good thing <br/>
if you can&#39;t add new graphics without a large patch.  It&#39;s too bad, especially since EQ <br/>
has a fairly limited amount of graphical variations for the characters.</div>
