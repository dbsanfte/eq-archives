<div id="ygrps-yiv-1201545708">A side note for the disarm issue. the only time I reccomend using disarm is<br/>
when the mob is using a very fast weapon like a dagger or a rapier etc..<br/>
what we know is that if the mobs hand damage is the higher damge weapon it<br/>
will use the damage from it hands. if it happens to be holding a fs dagger<br/>
then it will use the speed of the dagger but not the damage of the dagger.<br/>
so it would be doing its hand damage with dagger speed.<br/>

&gt; &gt;I know that sneak is capped at 113, does anyone know what the<br/>
&gt; &gt;highest levels we can take our other skills too?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I think I remember reading that the natual cap for skills is 200,<br/>
&gt; &gt;but Dual Wield is at 250.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well, although I cannot speak definitively or authoritatively, I can<br/>
&gt; say that the only skill I can recall capping at 200 was Sense<br/>
&gt; Heading.  Most of the other abilities that I can think of off-hand<br/>
&gt; seem to have progressed beyond that except at an extremely slow rate<br/>
&gt; of progress.  Speaking as a recent achiever of level 46, I can say<br/>
&gt; the following with some confidence:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; - After the last 30 hours of play, my Defense has gone up a single<br/>
&gt; point (to 211) - and I&#39;ve spent almost the entire time being the<br/>
&gt; exclusive tank to a nearly endless parade of blues.<br/>
&gt; - I don&#39;t remember the last time I saw Flying Kick go up.<br/>
&gt; - Offense seems to keep going up at its normal rate of speed (now in the<br/>
220s).<br/>
&gt; - The last number I saw out of Dual Wield was 252 - and that was some<br/>
&gt; time ago.  It&#39;s possible that it went higher (perhaps all the way to<br/>
&gt; 255) and I just didn&#39;t notice it, however.<br/>
&gt; - Mend seems to still be progressing, but again is an extremely slow<br/>
&gt; progress so I may have capped that as well - not that it matters<br/>
&gt; becuase it&#39;s been over 20 levels since it&#39;s failed.<br/>
&gt; - Progress on Feign Death continues, although I haven&#39;t been working<br/>
&gt; on it as much as I perhaps should lately so it still is languishing<br/>
&gt; in the 190&#39;s.<br/>
&gt; - Disarm is still moving into the 170s as well, but don&#39;t ask me why<br/>
&gt; I bother - a disarmed opponent doesn&#39;t seem to be a whole lot less<br/>
&gt; dangerous than an armed one.<br/>
&gt; - Instill Doubt is the singularly most useless and dangerous (to us,<br/>
&gt; that is) skill in our arsenal and I haven&#39;t bothered to skill it up a<br/>
&gt; single point since acquiring it at level 29 (which is where I was<br/>
&gt; when the patch went in which supports it), so I can&#39;t really speak on<br/>
&gt; that one.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; While my current rate of progress is annoying, it doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; really bother me.  However, I&#39;m becoming rather concerned about my<br/>
&gt; Defense and Flying Kick.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve capped them, but the<br/>
&gt; rate of progress is disturbingly slow.  I really don&#39;t want to<br/>
&gt; out-level my skills and thereby be rendered useless in a group of<br/>
&gt; like-leveled people (as so many power-levelers have found).  Does<br/>
&gt; anybody else have anything to say about this situation?<br/>
