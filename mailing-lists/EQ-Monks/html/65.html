<div id="ygrps-yiv-1488735341">GMs will NOT give you ANY advice with quests, other than to say &quot;put each <br/>
item in a separate slot&quot;.  That is my experience when I could not get the <br/>
yellow sash.  Chette helped (?) me and that&#39;s the party line I got.  She <br/>
couldn&#39;t say anything else and I was really upset.  It turns out I was not <br/>
giving my white sash, which another monk finally told me I had to do.  I <br/>
got the quest BEFORE a patch that made giving the white sash mandatory, and <br/>
missed it when I re-read the quest text.  My friend had already performed <br/>
the quest and didn&#39;t have to give his sash so that made me not even think <br/>
about it...<br/>

 From everything I&#39;ve read, all you need is the blackened wand and the <br/>
blackened sapphire, and the orange sash. I too am waiting on the sapphire. <br/>
My advice is petition a GM BEFORE you try it, show the items to the GM, <br/>
then turn them in.<br/>
