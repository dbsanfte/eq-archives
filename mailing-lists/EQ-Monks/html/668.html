&gt;well well well...what have i *hic* started.  Sems two me dat a slite<br/>
&gt;debate be goin on while i be away.  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m going to steer from my whole drunk arguement and go talk normal so<br/>
&gt;every here can be understanding of what i have to say.  That whole MY<br/>
&gt;GAME, MY MONEY agruement is old and just an exscuse for someone to say<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;screw you....i don&#39;t care what you think...i&#39;ll do what I want and I<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t care about anyone else&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>well obviously they do care what you think or else we wouldn&#39;t be having this<br/>
discussion, heh.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;thats what the whole MY MONEY, MY GAME arguement means...and if you<br/>
&gt;disagree with that you are wrong.  The whole reason people say that is so<br/>
&gt;they can justify what ever they do even when they are wrong.  This is a<br/>
&gt;roleplaying game with many many people playing at one time.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;sarcasm on&gt;<br/>
yah i&#39;ve never heard anyone justify whatever wrong thing they were doing by<br/>
saying<br/>
&#39;&#39;oh but i was roleplaying&#39;&#39;.<br/>
&lt;sarcasm off&gt;<br/>

See massive debate on eqvault forum probly 6-8 weeks ago where people were <br/>
arguing that it is fine to train other players if they were &#39;&#39;defending<br/>
their homeland&#39;&#39;,<br/>
i.e. roleplaying.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;A massive multiplayer game right?  Massively Multiplayer.....i think<br/>
&gt;everyone can agree with that.  And wheather or not you realize it<br/>
&gt;everything you do has an effect on the other people who play the game. <br/>
&gt;Every orc pawn you kill, every foraged piece of food you drop...it all has<br/>
&gt;an effect on the other people on the server.  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Now that we have that understood....lets talk about twinking.  Everytime<br/>
&gt;you twink you take something away from someone who is at the right level<br/>
&gt;to have that item.  At 19 or 17 or 22 or whatever level he was...he took<br/>
&gt;away an executioners hood from some 45th+ level character.  He took the<br/>
&gt;serpentine bracers away from some 40th+ level character who deserved it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why is that the case?  I had my level 26 bard in blackburrow last week.  no<br/>
one was in the big commander room.  so i killed a bunch of them.  Who did<br/>
I deny that loot to?  No one.  If I hadn&#39;t been there, no one would have<br/>
killed<br/>
them.  In fact I have done good, I have generated *more* loot for the level<br/>
12ish<br/>
crowd to have.  That&#39;s 10 more onyx earrings and spiked collars and studded<br/>
collars that otherwise would not have existed.<br/>
<br/>
Which seems to bring up a tangent<br/>
that I just thought of.  Are you actually saying that hi level guys should<br/>
not be<br/>
killing lower level mobs to get loot?  Or is the act of giving the loot to<br/>
a lower<br/>
level character the problem?  Is it bad for a lower level char to give the<br/>
loot to a<br/>
higher level character?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;And it&#39;s not the fact that he can go and get another one...it&#39;s the fact<br/>
&gt;that he is just going to have to wait that much longer because there is<br/>
&gt;some chump monk who can&#39;t earn his own equipment...he has to have older<br/>
&gt;friends help him out or just use his own older character to get things for<br/>
&gt;him cause he can&#39;t play the game like it was meant to be played.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If the 40th level character wasn&#39;t camping the mob who dropped the bracers<br/>
he doesn&#39;t &#39;&#39;deserve&#39;&#39; it any more than any schmuck wandering around in<br/>
greater<br/>
faydark.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;I hate twinking and i hate twinkers because you take things away from<br/>
&gt;people who rightfully deserve those items.  I don&#39;t care if your 48th<br/>
&gt;level kill stealing wizard had to shoot down the hopes of a group of 45th<br/>
&gt;levels to get the item....you still took it from them and gave it to<br/>
&gt;someone who is 1/2 their age...maybe younger.  Everytime you twink an item<br/>
&gt;you screw someone who REALLY AND TRULEY DESERVES THE ITEM.   <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ahhh, you seem to be confusing/lumping kill stealing and twinking.  I<br/>
twinked my<br/>
paladin with stuff that my bard found.  (my monk is on a different server)<br/>
I never stole<br/>
any loot or kills from any other party.  i don&#39;t like kill stealing any<br/>
more than the<br/>
next guy.  but that is outside of the realm of this discussion; we are<br/>
talking about<br/>
twinking, the act of giving items to a lower level character that couldn&#39;t<br/>
kill the mob<br/>
by himself.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;I think the one thing that people don&#39;t realize about this game and any<br/>
&gt;other game is that it is everyones responsibility to provide a roleplaying<br/>
&gt;environment.  it is EVERYONES responsibility to PROVIDE a ROLEPLAYING<br/>
&gt;ENVIRONMENT....it is a massively multiplayer roleplaying game after<br/>
&gt;all..... <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You can roleplay whatever you want.  Twinking has nothing to do with that.<br/>
<br/>
Whee&#39;s father was a tough dwarven adventurer with much experience who has<br/>
travelled the world and collected much knowledge and treasure.  Unfortunately<br/>
he met his demise when trying to clear unrest manor of the foul creatures that<br/>
now populate the area.  Whee has decided to follow her dear father&#39;s footsteps<br/>
and venture out to discover the wonders of Norrath.  She has gone up to the<br/>
attic<br/>
to dust off several trunks of her father&#39;s old equipment that her mother<br/>
has stored<br/>
for some time now.<br/>
<br/>
etc, etc, etc.  now that&#39;s a perfectly believable roleplaying in character<br/>
background<br/>
for my character.  and she  has a blackened iron bastard sword, a<br/>
bloodstained <br/>
mantle and various pieces of bronze armor.  so what.  none of that was<br/>
stolen from<br/>
anyone else.  no other hi level character got screwed.  hell, no one other<br/>
than my <br/>
party was even in runnyeye when i got the bibs.  tell me who i &#39;&#39;stole&#39;&#39;<br/>
the bibs from<br/>
and who got &#39;&#39;screwed&#39;&#39; by it.<br/>
