I&#39;m guessing that the cap is thus 100 + (5 * lvl).  Don&#39;t know if<br/>
that&#39;s unique to ikkies (the cap) or if just by some luck of the throw<br/>
of the dice, I haven&#39;t gotten any skill raises since I hit 120.<br/>
<br/>
I never thought swimming was lvl capped, but now I&#39;m not so sure.</div>
