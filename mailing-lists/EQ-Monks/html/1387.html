<b>Subject:</b> That darn goblin alchemist. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-628585297">Started.. or at least tried to start.. the Treant Fists quest last night.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s 10:04AM central... I haven&#39;t gone to bed yet.  Spent from 1:15am until<br/>
just now slaughtering goblins in Misty Thicket trying to get the damn<br/>
alchemist to spawn.  No luck.  Even petitioned just before the servers were<br/>
going to come down to see if they could make him spawn for me.  No dice. :)<br/>
<br/>
Ah well... I hope my next attempt later today won&#39;t last as long as this one<br/>
did.  I&#39;m exhausted.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully the servers will be up when I wake up.<br/>
