<b>Subject:</b> Iksar Stat Test <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1057431016">I ran some tests last night on Iksar monks to see how the stats effected hp,<br/>
ac and attk.  I know some of the people on the list could have told me this<br/>
information, so I&#39;m passing the results along to the rest that haven&#39;t done<br/>
this experiment before as an FYI.<br/>
<br/>
Every 5 points of Ag added increased AC by 1, for a max of 4 added AC if all<br/>
20 went into it.<br/>
<br/>
About 80% of the points put into Str went into attk.  All 20 pts into Str<br/>
improved attk by 16 points.  The base was 10, then adding all 20 pts into<br/>
str almost tripled attk!  The difference in battles was very noticeable.<br/>
Plus for some reason, my battle skills went up really fast compared to the<br/>
other tests with this configuration.  Anyone know why?<br/>
<br/>
Nothing for hp, ac or attk for dex.  (I guess you all knew that.)<br/>
<br/>
I started this exp to see what would happen with stamina.  The results were<br/>
disappointing.  It took 9 extra points of sta to increase hp by 1.  20 pts<br/>
into stamina still only increased hp by 1.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I know some of you have done this for human monks before.  Were the results<br/>
similar, with the exception of better ac results for ag?</div>
