<div id="ygrps-yiv-1842008402">Hmm....well it may be just a game but you know...its more than JUST a<br/>
game to some people.  It is the only way that I can keep in touch with<br/>
my brother for instance...he is never at home and doesn&#39;t ever call me<br/>
and I don&#39;t have long distance on my phone.  Somehow though, we seem to<br/>
get together in the game and talk about things.  Before EQ we rarely<br/>
talked..maybe twice a year?  tell me does that make EQ just a game? <br/>
Its something that we can do together...which yeah its a game but then<br/>
again its not JUST a game.  If those little bytes disappeared in<br/>
California and we could no longer meet up in EQ then I seriously doubt<br/>
we would talk very much anymore.  Yeah sure I have the ICQ and email of<br/>
all the people that I play with and get close to.  But seriously how<br/>
much is he going to be able to say to me in an email...tell me about<br/>
all his daily activities everyday...I don&#39;t think so.   How often do<br/>
you send an email back and forth with someone...chatting about stupid<br/>
stuff?  I don&#39;t...I don&#39;t have time for that.  But when I sit down to<br/>
play EQ we have a common goal and spend time working together to<br/>
accomplish this, which makes us closer...  And I use my brother as an<br/>
example, but through the game I have met some of the best friends I<br/>
have ever had. Without EQ, I doubt we would have very much to do with<br/>
each other at all, let alone that we would have ever met... Anyway...<br/>
sorry you really touched a sensitive side of me.  If you think that EQ<br/>
is just a game then you should try finding a nice solo game (yeah go<br/>
dig out the dusty PSX and sit down for a few hours playing tomb raider)<br/>
and compare it to EQ and see which one you prefer.  The solo game is<br/>
JUST a game.  I think you will see the difference between JUST a game<br/>
and EQ.<br/>

&gt; If its more to you, then you seriously need to stop &quot;playing&quot; it,<br/>
&gt; readjust your life, realize how little those bytes stored on a<br/>
&gt; computer<br/>
&gt; in california really should mean to you.<br/>
