<div id="ygrps-yiv-1514441251">Weight most definatley does AC. I make it a point when hunting in groups to<br/>
just take the coin split. If you are worried about not getting decent coin,<br/>
probably 75% of the time, when someone in my group runs off to sell, they<br/>
come back and give me a little coin since I am not taking any loot. Last<br/>
night, for example, a party member looted a full set of bronze in our course<br/>
of adventuring. He sold the entire set to a player, turned around and gave<br/>
me 15 plat.<br/>
<br/>
As far as weight affecting atk, I have never seen anything official, but I<br/>
do believe this happens. I think it also affects dex, but haven&#39;t had the<br/>
chance to really look into it.<br/>
<br/>
I would recommend definately getting netted or woven armor if you can afford<br/>
it. Too bad I didn&#39;t see this earlier, as I just upgraded to full mesh and<br/>
gave away my full set of woven to a younger Brother.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have heard many people say that weight affects my ac, then I have also<br/>
&gt; heard many that say that weight affects my chance of hitting. I was just<br/>
&gt; starting to get rid of my leather armor for light patchwork or maybe just<br/>
&gt; spend all my money on netted when I saw a monk wearing leather. When I<br/>
&gt; asked him he said that weight doesn&#39;t matter at all for monks. Now, I<br/>
&gt; usually have more weight than 14 and I find myself missing more then my<br/>
&gt; other less bulbous monk counterparts. So, what&#39;s the truth does weight<br/>
&gt; matter for us? <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I also was wondering, does ac and atk mean the damage we take and do, or<br/>
&gt; the chance we have to get hit or hit. Thanks for your time all.<br/>
