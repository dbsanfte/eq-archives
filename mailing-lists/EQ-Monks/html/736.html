&lt;&lt; Variant didnt Nerf anyone!<br/>
 i assume that you are referring to the recently announced patch in which<br/>
 DOT were MODIFIED.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 &quot;modified&quot; = nerfed. You basically say this yourself, by admitting it slows <br/>
down powerlevelling by weakening the class&#39; soloing abilities.<br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt; 1) Kiting was widely viewed as an exploit used by players to POWER level<br/>
 at tremendous rates! THis new patch only makes that habbit slightly harder<br/>
  DOT&#39;s do 66% damage while mob is running after you.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 This supposed &quot;exploit&quot; was just another example of the endless parade of <br/>
jealous whining that is going on. SO WHAT if some classes can power level? <br/>
Why does anyone else care? What&#39;s stopping you (or anyone else) from playing <br/>
the classes that can? Since some people cant, therefore no one else should?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; 2)You may not beable to Kite BLOOD REDS anymore, but blues will be<br/>
 kiteable - by level 30 BLues are kicking any mele class player&#39;s butt, so<br/>
 Kiters will still have a solo advantage over mele types.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 I have a shaman. He could NEVER kite blood reds (though from what I <br/>
understand, necros often can.) Now, it takes him about a bubble more mana to <br/>
kite what he could have kited before. Wooo! More downtime while soloing. <br/>
Thanks whiners! What good did that do?!?<br/>
 <br/>
 &lt;&lt;3) Fighting in a group  your DOT&#39;s will do a good deal more damge now<br/>
 because Variant upped the duration by 18 seconds.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 One of the reason I liked playing a shaman was because I didn&#39;t have to <br/>
depend on groups quite so much. If I always wanted to group, I would always <br/>
play my monk.<br/>
 <br/>
 &lt;&lt;All this patch does is prevent players from choosing a character just so<br/>
 they can Kite their way to level 50 ahead of everyone else.  If you seek<br/>
 to play a character that has an unfair levelling advantage over all others<br/>
 then yes, this patch took a major chunk out of your behind!  But for those<br/>
 of us who are interested in enjoying the game, role-playing our chosen<br/>
 class of character then this patch doesnt make any difference at all. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 Sounds to me like you think of this game as a race to 50, not a role playing <br/>
game. Because, why else would you care if someone else gets to 50 before you? <br/>
If you&#39;re really into it for the roleplaying aspects, than why is it <br/>
important if another class can solo better than yours? And what makes your <br/>
method of &quot;enjoyment&quot;  so much more valid than anyone else&#39;s? <br/>
 What that patch is is just more catering to the whiners, who want to see <br/>
everyone nerfed and/or play in the style that they deem best for everyone <br/>
else. YAWN! <br/>
<br/>
 If you think one class is much better than another -- PLAY THAT CLASS! I <br/>
like my monk! I like my shaman! If I wanted to play something else I would; <br/>
and I don&#39;t demand that other classes be nerfed or changed or anything else, <br/>
so that they are better suited to what I consider the &quot;best&quot; way to play the <br/>
game. Play the class you enjoy, have fun, and stop worrying about anyone else <br/>
having an advantage over you, before we&#39;re all reduced to the least common <br/>
denominator, fighting like mages and casting like rogues.</div>
