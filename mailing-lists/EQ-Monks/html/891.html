&lt;&lt; Also with FD....say you take away 4/5th of a critters life...then FD.  If<br/>
 someone comes along and does the last 1/5th of damage...he gets full exp<br/>
 and you get none.  When you attack something then FD...any damage you did<br/>
 is now considered, i guess &quot;anonymous&quot; would be the best word.  And the<br/>
 person who kills it gets credit for the whole thing.  It&#39;s a good way to<br/>
 stack exp on someone too....almost kill something...then FD and let him<br/>
 finish it for full EXP. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 i tried powerleveling someone this way, and it didn&#39;t work at all. They <br/>
didn&#39;t get the exp; I did.</div>
