&gt; Ok, my bard can pull rather well, but occassionally that spell gets resisted<br/>
&gt; and the only option is to zone unless the party can take on more than 1.<br/>
&gt; It is a bit faster to pull with a bard than a monk.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My question is what songs did you twist when you fought the paladin?  How<br/>
&gt; did you play this fight? <br/>

<br/>
I used Denon&#39;s Disrupted Discord(18th), Chord&#39;s of Dissonance(2nd), and<br/>
Hymn of Restoration(6th). I used those 3 songs with switching instruments<br/>
and punches (1-4dmg :) After 18th bards are more powerful using just<br/>
music. Had I tried fighting the paladin with my PGT and barbed whip, I<br/>
would have been thumped soundly. The problem is those songs are area<br/>
effect. You wouldn&#39;t believe the hatred mobs feel for bards, but thats a<br/>
rant for another list. <br/>
<br/>
As for bards pulling, all the songs are low level ones as already posted.<br/>
In fact only a handful of bard songs over 20 are any good, which is why I<br/>
dont play him much these days. <br/>
