<div id="ygrps-yiv-607438134">Was just wondering if the message actually got through since it seems no one<br/>
listend to what I came from the horses mouth aka Verant this was at the show<br/>
they were at.  This came from ack can&#39;t remember his name its one of there<br/>
programmers.    It will not happen that they change the colors until they<br/>
upper the specs of the game though in order to get the most money and be the<br/>
most compatible with the most machine you have to let that guy with a Voodoo<br/>
1 online as well as bleeding edge equipment.   Its a marketing thing<br/>
therefore until they phase out older video cards the color scheme they have<br/>
is kinda stuck.<br/>
<br/>
I did hear someone talking about Ashron&#39;s Call to be honest with you the<br/>
game is in kinda over head side view.   The graphics are good but I feel<br/>
like they are missing the boat by not giving you the feel of being that<br/>
actual person.</div>
