<b>Subject:</b> Re: Verant Solution to Twinking <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-141661014">Very true, but it would go along way towards curtailing it. People would not be<br/>
able to sell items on e-bay (there are over 1000 up there right now) for one. The<br/>
only way I can see people being able to twink is the way you described, and then<br/>
only to people who were there with them and could loot the corpse themselves. If<br/>
Verant made it so you have to actually participate in the attack to loot, there<br/>
would at least be some risk to the low level twinker instead of just standing<br/>
back while your party kills it then looting for the item...<br/>

&gt; Making all items NO DROP will not solve the problem.  Last week, I was down<br/>
&gt; in LG, helping ppl in my group get a guise of the deciever.  When we first<br/>
&gt; zoned in we noticed there was a lvl 11 troll warrior down there with other<br/>
&gt; ppl from a certain guild.  Turns out they are twinking him a mask.  Well, I<br/>
&gt; nor my group would have anything to do with this so we walked in and took the<br/>
&gt; room in the temple.  Because they had the lvl 11, they couldn&#39;t camp the<br/>
&gt; room, or at least hadn&#39;t gotten to it yet, so were forced to pull from the<br/>
&gt; bridge.  Needless to say it rather pissed them off.  We said we would give<br/>
&gt; them the first mask IF it was for one of them, but it wasn&#39;t and they kept<br/>
&gt; bitching about how we stole their camp.  Guilds got involved, a person quit<br/>
&gt; their guild for camping NO DROP items to twink.  Point of the story is, you<br/>
&gt; can still twink ppl with NO DROP items.  Only think I can think of to change<br/>
&gt; it is to put lvl limits on items.<br/>
