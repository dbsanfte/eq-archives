<div id="ygrps-yiv-1908764890">1000 pp in the bank for a lvl 18 monk?  I&#39;d guess you do a LOT of<br/>
trading.  Don&#39;t think I had a grand in the bank until I was doing HGs<br/>
in Rathe.  But then I spend no time at all trading, usually just give<br/>
my obselete stuff to friends or strangers.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;First off, I am not twinked, every thing I got I earned the money for myself.  As a monk this is really easy to do as monks dont have anything to spend money on but good armor.  By the time I was 10th level, I had over 100 plat saved, by the time I reached 18th I had bought and sold over 1000 plat worth of stuff, all done by money and items I have earned myself by selling loot or trade skills.<br/>
