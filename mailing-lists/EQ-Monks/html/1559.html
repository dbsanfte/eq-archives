<div id="ygrps-yiv-333961835">I am not sure if you can do that or not, how I maxxed out my sneak though <br/>
was I just hit sneak untill it succeeded (after the first point in it) and <br/>
didn&#39;t unsneak untill it was maxxed (or I needed to run like hell).  SO I <br/>
guess that would work.  Of course like most things that are around the rules <br/>
are usually bad and can get you in trouble.<br/>

&gt; &gt; BTW,  I love my new Iksar monk!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve read the sneak thing too; never tried it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Question though:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;When you get your sneak skill and train 1 point in to it, can you hit<br/>
&gt;sneak, walk up to a wall, hit autorun and go eat dinner and just have<br/>
&gt;it raise on its own?  Or is the skill check made only when you hit the<br/>
&gt;button?<br/>
