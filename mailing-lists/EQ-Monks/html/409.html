<div id="ygrps-yiv-396849488">cloth is good and that sash quest is fine to run around 2-3. if i were you i <br/>
would not waste my money on leather or patchwork.  its heavy and cost a lot <br/>
(not patchwork but its still heavy) and you will just get rid of it later... <br/>
at lvl 4 or 5 i would go to East Commons and kill beatles and snakes and a <br/>
black bear here and there.  Just hang around the first inn and run to the <br/>
gaurds if you need to... also you can kill those little spiders as well.  <br/>
The first big money item you want to buy is a set of netted or better gloves <br/>
(the order goes netted, woven, mesh) plan on spending at least 2 plat maybe <br/>
as much as 5 or 6 plat depending on the day. Also, i would not spend any <br/>
money on netted armor except for the gloves.  Save you plat for at least <br/>
woven but buying netted gloves is fine.  these gloves will allow you to hit <br/>
magic critters likes wisps and stuff which you really dont need to worry <br/>
about till at least lvl 8 and most likly 10.  You really need a pair of <br/>
magic gloves so buy em even if your not ready to use em yet.  Then as you <br/>
lvl up just start moving west through the commons and do a little grouping.  <br/>
I went to befallen around lvl 7 (which is in West commons).  If you stay on <br/>
the first floor and steer clear of trains it will provide you with good exp <br/>
and good loot.  Its kinda risky gettin there and staying alive in there so <br/>
enter at your own risk. I fought in East and West Commons untill i hit lvl <br/>
15 after that you kinda have to move on or really start grouping.  But the <br/>
commons can support you well from lvl 5 to 15<br/>

&gt;Hey everyone. I just stared a monk on Quellious and am now lvl 2. What <br/>
&gt;armor and stuff can I use and what should I be looking for first as far as <br/>
&gt;weapons and armor goes? or should I not wear any? Any info would be most <br/>
&gt;appreciated.<br/>
