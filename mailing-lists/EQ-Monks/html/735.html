<div id="ygrps-yiv-1488020212">I can only really answer number 4, as I&#39;m not a tailor at all.  A good place<br/>
to hunt for silk at level 11 is everfrost peaks (on the plains area), be<br/>
looking for Giant and Large wooly spiders.  They should all be blue and even<br/>
fights to you, so unless you bring a healer, expect some downtime between<br/>
battles.  They also poison, but it&#39;s not that bad of poison.  Or you could<br/>
hunt in West Karanas.  The giant spiders are far between (as is everything<br/>
in that gigantic zone), but it&#39;s fairly good hunting.  Oh, and for hunting<br/>
spiders now a days, I recommend doing it off prime time hours, as every is<br/>
looking for spider silks now, and we monks can&#39;t out pull the thousands of<br/>
spellcasters out there that see a spider and burn it from a mile off.<br/>

&gt; 1.    What is the recommended skill level before I could make &quot;Silk Armor&quot;<br/>
&gt; at a reasonable rate?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2.    What is the recommended skill level before I could make &quot;Cured Silk<br/>
&gt; Armor&quot; at a reasonable rate?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 3.    What is the easiest part (cap, gorget, tunic, leggings, belt, cloak<br/>
&gt; etc...) to make for each type of armor? Can anyone list them down in order<br/>
&gt; of difficulties?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 4.    Where can I get a constant supply of spider silk near Qeynos area? I<br/>
&gt; am only level 11 so I cannot go to E.Karana.<br/>
