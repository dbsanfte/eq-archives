<div id="ygrps-yiv-1162295453">i have noticed at least on my server....alot of the 25th level and below<br/>
dungeons are emptying out.  It&#39;s seems the average age on my server is now<br/>
35 or so.<br/>
<br/>
Sligo<br/>
Cazic Thule<br/>
<br/>
p.s. i started tooling around the lower level dungeons with my 38th<br/>
druid....getting stuff for my guild.  BB was practically empty...noone was<br/>
attacking the elites for their items.  Walking all around PAW with no<br/>
problem and I even walked into Befallen and nothing was happening<br/>
there...got a BBC as soon as I walked in....</div>
