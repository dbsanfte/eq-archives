<b>Subject:</b> RE: Feign Death vs. casters and anomolous failures <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1449553262">Here is a question along these lines...<br/>
<br/>
While hunting in Unrest, I contracted rabies during a fight. A moment later,<br/>
a Hag came around the corner and cast on our paladin. I FD successfully and<br/>
everyone else runs, with the Hag in pursuit. The MoB I was fighting however,<br/>
the non-casting mummy that had given me the rabies, continued to beat on me.<br/>
I stood up, just me and the Mummy now, FD successfully again, and end up<br/>
getting killed by the mummy. My question is twofold... 1) Is rabies<br/>
considered a DoT? I know it says &quot;You resist the weak disease spell&quot; or<br/>
something similar, but actually thought that was a bug since the mummy does<br/>
not cast any spells. 2) If we a re hit by a DoT, does that nullify the use<br/>
of FD? I ask this because since a previous spell is affecting us, does the<br/>
cast then know that we are not dead?<br/>
<br/>
Thoughts?<br/>
<br/>
Praelor<br/>
<br/>
btw... I contacted a guide about this and was told &quot;Sometimes monsters just<br/>
aren&#39;t fooled by feign death, even if you are successful&quot;.  Excuse me, but<br/>
if they aren&#39;t fooled, exactly HOW are we successful??<br/>

&gt; 	I posted this on another list, but wanted to share it with this one<br/>
&gt; as well to see if anybody might be able to help solve the mystery of why<br/>
&gt; FD<br/>
&gt; fails without a message sometimes.<br/>

&gt; &gt;When faced with a caster you should turn off autoattack and wait for the<br/>
&gt; &gt;spell to hit you. Then feign before the caster starts a new spell. That<br/>
&gt; is<br/>
&gt; &gt;the way to trick a caster with feign death.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	Interesting suggestion, and it would seem to jive with some of my<br/>
&gt; own experiences with FD lately.  I&#39;ve been racking my brains trying to<br/>
&gt; figure out why it is that FD fails to stop an aggressor&#39;s attacks even<br/>
&gt; when<br/>
&gt; no &quot;xxx has fallen to the ground&quot; message.  Clearly, it has failed but we<br/>
&gt; have no indication of this other than the fact that we&#39;re still getting<br/>
&gt; pounded.  Some of my thoughts on the subject are these, any modifications<br/>
&gt; to this list would be well appreciated:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1 - Feigning when mobs are frenzied on you has a dramatically higher rate<br/>
&gt; of failure than against non-frenzied mobs.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2 - Feigning &#39;mid-attack&#39; seems to fail more frequently.  Perhaps it goes<br/>
&gt; something like this:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; a) Mob starts his swing<br/>
&gt; b) Feign performed (no message of failure)<br/>
&gt; c) I stob being the mob&#39;s current target<br/>
&gt; d) Blow lands, re-instating me as the current target<br/>
&gt; e) Mob keeps pounding on current target (me).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	I don&#39;t know if this is really what happens or not, but it would<br/>
&gt; fit with the previous poster&#39;s &#39;wait until the caster has done his thing&#39;<br/>
&gt; suggestion.  Also, have you noticed that after you kill a mob, you still<br/>
&gt; sometimes take a swing and occasionally see a damage message AFTER the<br/>
&gt; thing has died?  Perhaps this is an artifact of the above sequence.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 3 - Still not sure whether or not stopping your attack before feigning<br/>
&gt; affects things except perhaps exacerbating the situation outlined in #2.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	Well?<br/>
