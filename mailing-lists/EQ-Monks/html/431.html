<div id="ygrps-yiv-1465197577">K i have been playing a monk for a little while i say this cause im one bub<br/>
from 12.  What i would like to see:<br/>
<br/>
Nunchucks   Couple points more than our fists, delay a little longer,<br/>
obtainable around lvl 25<br/>
<br/>
Brass knuck  Maybe as  we are not thugs<br/>
<br/>
Sai (sp)  We are following the ways of the mind, but we are a martial arts<br/>
type of character.  Give them dagger qualities and same delay , only less<br/>
weight<br/>
<br/>
Weight   Either gives us a couple pounds more or make it so we can make our<br/>
money go fron 10 cp to 1 s, 10 s to 1g, 10 g to 1 pp while we are out<br/>
running around.<br/>
<br/>
tailoring (not just monk)  give ability to make bandages ( monks best<br/>
friends).<br/>
<br/>
Our hits should do more damage, maybe not much but am i going to be able to<br/>
hit for 128 points of damagae with one fist  (not sure on this one cause i<br/>
have not attained that lvl sorry).<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t follow the warriors or much of the other classes for that matter,<br/>
but a few more skills and some additions throughout the monks life would<br/>
make him a better rounded character ( he is already very fun to play).  I<br/>
don&#39;t think that i out damage to many people in melee yet, that happens<br/>
supposedly in our mid range.  But i don&#39;t want to go over the hill and hit<br/>
50 and be back at the bottom of the melee heap either.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Just 2 cents no rants no flames just having some fun with<br/>
<br/>
Shoalin on TZ</div>
