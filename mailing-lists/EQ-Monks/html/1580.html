<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-41706407">In my honest opinion, and that may not be worth much as I do not have a monk<br/>
of respectable level, is that monks are the only class in which<br/>
effectiveness is not measured in equipment.  Then my question is this, why<br/>
is there an equipment check everyday?  I realize the theory of the week has<br/>
everyone swapping constantly, but so far, over a year of grouping with<br/>
different monks, I have noticed few changes (Pre Kunark) no matter what gear<br/>
was worn.  I have observed that the only constants in the monk community<br/>
have been HP, AC, Resists for the solo monk, and Resists, HP, AC for the<br/>
grouped monk.  I believe this reflects the creatures to be fought... a solo<br/>
monk would not fight a caster if given the choice, and a grouped monk<br/>
expects to be hit rarely, save for the casters that open up on the party.<br/>
Now please tell me if I am wrong, but this is what I have observed.  Knowing<br/>
that agility really does nothing for your defensive skills, and adds little<br/>
to your AC, Stamina adds little to your HP, and strength adds to the damage,<br/>
but not the chance to hit, it really does seem that a move to AC and HP<br/>
would be best.  <br/>
<br/>
A monk friend of mine told me that he concentrates on HPs mainly, then on<br/>
whatever AC gear he can get to fill non HP areas.  He says that most of the<br/>
resist gear he has access to is either too heavy, or is too weak to be worth<br/>
dropping more valuable HP gear for.  I assume this will change with items<br/>
like the crown he was talking about.<br/>
<br/>
Now for the real question... I have noticed a great number of monk weapons<br/>
in Kunark.  I know that my friend has done no training in weapons, only Hand<br/>
to Hand.  Are the new monk weapons worth the trouble?  I say they would be,<br/>
and he still disagrees.</div>
