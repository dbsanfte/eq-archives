<div id="ygrps-yiv-1531325059">I would go for improving mainly AGI and DEX... STR does affect attack, but <br/>
our attack in already higher than any other class, and we end up with an ATK <br/>
higher than any others except for the most magically enhanced warriors -- and <br/>
those who have such an ATK will have much worse DEX or AGI than a monk.</div>
