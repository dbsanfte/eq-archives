<div id="ygrps-yiv-2097008864">I used to play a druid until recently.  During that time, we frequently<br/>
hunted EK, or Runnyeye, as a group.  ( Grouping Druid...I know...you are<br/>
shocked... )  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, because I read this and other Monk boards, just to see what is going<br/>
on... I got into the habit of checking tracking everytime I was in the gorge<br/>
for whatever reason.<br/>
<br/>
Well we were in Runnyeye, I died... bound in HH Bank... No big deal.<br/>
Running through the gorge... I spot the alchemist on tracking... right at<br/>
the Runnyeye door.   I get there, and he is attacking a dwarf who was just<br/>
fighting the reg gobs,  dwarf getting thrashed.  She I heal the dwarf, then<br/>
begin to blast the Alchemist.  Now I have my indoor grouping spells loaded,<br/>
not my soloing spells... and I just died...meaning I have no additional mana<br/>
reserve, or armor, or even a weapon.  Our group happens to contain a monk...<br/>
a good friend of a guildmate... so I start yelling for them to zone out<br/>
here, into the gorge... they are waiting just on the other side of the zone<br/>
line for me to zone in.  I was near death, and had to zone to save my<br/>
butt... but the whole time... I had to practically BEG to get them to come<br/>
into the gorge... monk would not even zone until after the battle was<br/>
over...and I explained to the rest of the group what this was that I had<br/>
nearly died again over.  They had to beg him to get him to come out before<br/>
he did.<br/>
<br/>
He complained the rest of the night about the weight of it &quot;putting him<br/>
over&quot;.  I think he destroyed the mace and never did the quest.<br/>
<br/>
And yes, this monk was low 20s at the time.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Everytime I hear about the long camp time in the gorge, I think of this.  I<br/>
thought some of the rest of you should too.  And if you run into Gohku on<br/>
the Brell Server, you can tell him what you think about it, too.<br/>
