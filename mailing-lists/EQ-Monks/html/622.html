&gt;I think another idea about the level limits could be the con system, if you<br/>
&gt;con certain level and you do not get experience from them, the same should<br/>
&gt;work in reverse for items, level groups should work for instance 1-5 5-15<br/>
&gt;15-25 25-35 35-50 or something of the like. That would solve a lot of those<br/>
&gt;problems, but in my real opinion, I just really love this game, it may be<br/>
&gt;because I am still so new, haven&#39;t even got past my first month and my 19th<br/>
&gt;(almost 20th Level) Monk is my pride and joy. I really enjoy when people<br/>
&gt;look at my gear and say nice spread, I worked damn hard for my stuff and it<br/>
&gt;is my own personnel satisfaction I get from my character. If I see someone<br/>
&gt;else who is twinked, I think that&#39;s good for them, I hope they enjoy that<br/>
&gt;because I know they will enjoyment of the game for they have nothing to look<br/>
&gt;forward too, so those people won&#39;t be around too much longer.<br/>

trying to get to where his friends are so they can group together.  Maybe<br/>
they are<br/>
trying to get to places they haven&#39;t seen yet because they would die almost<br/>
instantly.  Some people don&#39;t play the game strictly to get cool items.<br/>
