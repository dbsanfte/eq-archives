<b>Subject:</b> When and why do monks become such a powerhouse? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-479360884">I have heard numerous times on this list &quot;just wait till you hit lvl 30, that&#39;s when monks come into their own&quot; and similar type messages.  My question is, what&#39;s so special about lvl 30?  Is that just the point at which our multiple punches + special attacks catch up with other tanks and their best weapons?<br/>
<br/>
Also, I have heard ppl talk about being in a lull or hitting a really tough level.  2 comments questions about this:<br/>
<br/>
1)  I just hit 15 and I have not had anything similar to this yet.  Is it just a result of playing a character for a long time (probably pretty intensely too)?  It seems to me that there shouldn&#39;t really be any &quot;tough&quot; levels, just tough areas or tough monsters for a certain level.  ie, some blue monsters are alot tougher than others at certain lvls.  If you are in an area where all the blues are kicking your butt, maybe just move somewhere else for a while where the exp. giving monsters are not as tough for you.  Just an idea, seems to have worked for me so far - any comments?<br/>
<br/>
2)  Are there any of these lulls after 30?  Or is it really some magical threshhold that we just kick butt after that lvl?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I absolutely love playing my monk so far, and I&#39;m not even as good a tank as a warrior.  It&#39; just alot of fun being able to pummel things with my fists and seeing (now that I&#39;m 15) 3 sets of punches for 14 and then my special attack for 13 - man, that is so awesome.  Sort of bored here at work today, just looking for some new conversation pieces :)<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to lots of cool thoughts/ideas/comments,<br/>
