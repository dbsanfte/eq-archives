&gt; &gt;jump on monsters, yelling &quot;Mine!  Mine&quot;, like some 2 year old, because they<br/>
&gt; &gt;need the XP or the items.  Do not make assupmtions about me.  I do not take<br/>
&gt; &gt;for granted that I can buy serp bracers for 200pp or any of the other<br/>
&gt; &gt;things.  Why?  Because I play this game for adventuring purposes.  At 17th<br/>
&gt; &gt;level, I figured that the 200 pp I had stashed away would last me quite a<br/>
&gt; &gt;while.  That is 200pp I earned the hard way.  No one gave it to me.  It is<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Get off the cross, we need the wood.  99% of all players have gone through<br/>
&gt;this.  And by the way, I didn&#39;t have my first 200 pp until I was well into<br/>
&gt;my 20&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>hahahaha good one, can i use this in future rants?  that get off the cross <br/>
comment<br/>
would seem to apply to the first guy too, who thinks we owe him respect for<br/>
some unknown reason.<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;twinking that is one of the causes of the drop in prices for items.  If<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Bull - absolute bull.  Twinkers aren&#39;t selling the items they&#39;re wearing.<br/>
&gt;Lower prices, more supply.  Less Supply, higher prices.  Perhaps you&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;heard of it?  The ole &quot;Supply and Demand&quot; theory.  I just can&#39;t figure out<br/>
&gt;why a glowing stein is still selling for 250 pp on Quell.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>they&#39;re about 250 on veeshan too.  only thing i can figure out is that those<br/>
damn enchanters are fixing prices, heh.  ahh more power to them.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;shouldn&#39;t have to invest 9 months into a new character:  Why not?  Are you<br/>
&gt; &gt;afraid that you will get bored?  You already have intimate knowledge of<br/>
&gt; &gt;most of the areas of the world that you can use to your advantage.  Why<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The fact that it was his 9 months and his items means he can do any damn<br/>
&gt;thing he wants to.  Including, but not limited to, creating a Troll<br/>
&gt;Enchanter and trying to twink it&#39;s INT up to 500.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>hmm now there&#39;s a thought.  i can do the troll enchanter part, but i&#39;m not sure<br/>
how to get his int up to 500 heh.  better go twink some more.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;should you add the capability of walking around with items that your<br/>
&gt;character would never have had to chance to obtain?  To be honest, I do not<br/>
&gt;have a problem with a character getting a sword or a piece of armor from<br/>
&gt;someone, even another of the PCs that a player owns..  There are plenty of<br/>
&gt;historical and fantasy based accounts of this, but when someone steps onto<br/>
&gt;the stage, a new character, decked out in itmes that should belong to a<br/>
&gt;10th level or 20th level or 30th level characters, it really cheeses those<br/>
&gt;of us who are trying to earn the items legitimately.  Every item that goes<br/>
&gt;into a twinkers hands, is one less that I or another honest player can earn.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;BUZZ!!!!  Thank you for playing!  Except for the MASSIVELY rare spawns,<br/>
&gt;there are several holes in your theory.  First, most of the ultra-rare items<br/>
&gt;are on very very high level creatures.  So honest player #1 that is level 18<br/>
&gt;- sorry, you would never legitimately get this item.  Secondly, most of the<br/>
&gt;servers that have been around for a while... there&#39;s at least 2,000 of<br/>
&gt;everything it seems, except as I said, the ultra rares, that honest players<br/>
&gt;have no chance of getting while they&#39;re young.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>well to be honest there is a little bit of this going on.  i.e. when was <br/>
the last time<br/>
a non caster got a kill on hadden for the fishbone earring heh.  and stop <br/>
catering<br/>
to him by using &#39;&#39;honest&#39;&#39; incorrectly, heh.  twinking has nothing whatsoever<br/>
to do with &#39;&#39;honesty&#39;&#39;.  look it up if you don&#39;t believe me. :)<br/>
