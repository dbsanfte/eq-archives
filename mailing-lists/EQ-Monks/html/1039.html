<div id="ygrps-yiv-2017603701">If you decide to go the &quot;loot everything in sight&quot; route, all you need to do<br/>
is pick up a few weightless bags from a magician or shaman.  Granted, you<br/>
need to do this everytime you play, and they are limited as to the number of<br/>
items you can fit into them (just use them for the heaviest items), but they<br/>
work.  <br/>
