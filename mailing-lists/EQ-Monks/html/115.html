<div id="ygrps-yiv-1969073705">Ya, i&#39;ve found little use for skill points.  The best thing i ever used<br/>
them for was feign death, but I think it would have been a better choice<br/>
to just sit somewhere for 3 hours and get it up.  <br/>
<br/>
Disarm i just got, and found that it can be raised quite easily by<br/>
giving a weapon to your nearest level 1 monster and then take it back,<br/>
feign, get up, then hand it right back, and repeat.  <br/>
<br/>
Probably the best use there could be is the trade skills, as someone<br/>
else mentioned.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I am a level 7 monk and i have 20 points to spend. Would you<br/>
&gt; recommend i spend them on offensive skills now, save them for later,<br/>
&gt; use them on a skill to make money, or use them on throwing. If on<br/>
&gt; &gt; throwing is it a really good skill to get, does it do any damage or<br/>
&gt; is it just to attract animals as ive heard. Thanks for your time.<br/>

&gt; No matter what, dont use them on offensive skills. Your skills will<br/>
&gt; max out at each level as you use them. Waste of points. I&#39;ve found<br/>
&gt; Throwing to be a useless skill as well, only using it rarely to lure.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If I were you, I&#39;d save them for Feign Death at level 17.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyone but me that feels skill points are pretty useless for monks?<br/>
&gt; Hehe, I mean, after you get feign death, how many skills are left? 4?<br/>
&gt; 5? And most, if not all, monk skills are used in combat constantly, so<br/>
&gt; they&#39;ll max out by themselfs.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; *shrug* Might just be me...<br/>
