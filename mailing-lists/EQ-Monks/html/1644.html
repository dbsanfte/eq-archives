&gt; RE: [EQ-Monks] Monk QuestsThis used to be true, but it no longer drops the newbie note.  Now it&#39;s a book about Charassis.<br/>
&gt; Even if you multiquested the first shackle, you couldn&#39;t wear them, they&#39;re iksar only.<br/>
&gt; Fenedar<br/>
&gt; Innoruuk<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   can anyone confirm this. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   i remember seeing on the net somewhere that if you kill Dorn (in north ro, not sure which surname) a Dark elf assassin spawns, if you kill him a Widow mite spawns and if you kill that it drops the Iskar monk initiation book (or note) the one they start with and give to their guild master. according to this web page a human monk could use the scroll to join the iskar monk guild and thus gain access to the shackle quests...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   has anyone ever seen or heard anything like this elsewhere ??? <br/>
