<div id="ygrps-yiv-462457357">The reason it didn&#39;t work is because you are too high and they run away from <br/>
you.  To get it to work, when the mob runs away, you need to run away too, <br/>
having SOW or jboots works best, and you really need to be in an outside <br/>
zone.  Run away and turn around so you can see the mob, if you are far enough <br/>
away, you&#39;ll see it runnin back for you, that&#39;s when you FD.  Then whoever <br/>
kills it will get exp.  If it&#39;s a mob that doesn&#39;t run away, just make sure <br/>
when you FD, it stops attacking you.  If it doesn&#39;t then you didn&#39;t clear <br/>
your dmg.<br/>
