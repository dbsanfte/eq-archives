<div id="ygrps-yiv-994897558">First off you should be able to take Wisps in singles. That would jump your <br/>
plat funds way up pretty quickly and still offer xps as well. If you want a <br/>
good place to hunt run on over to Misty Thicket. I found it a pretty nice <br/>
hunting spot around that level. You could solo there for quite some time. <br/>
When you max out there take off for Oasis and that can carry you even higher. <br/>
The loot in both places is not very good so do not expect to get rich. If I <br/>
were starting over that is probably what I would do at least.</div>
