<div id="ygrps-yiv-727577456">will do. A question tho... if this is the case, why then do many monks say<br/>
we need more damage dealing ability? Because they are not out-damaging<br/>
everyone in sight? I have no problem with my role in group situations<br/>
changing as my abilities change.. Actually I think they should. I know I<br/>
would get fairly bored if my role from lvl 1-50 was static. It is the whole<br/>
reason I dumped my lvl 18 warrior. I never saw any change in what would be<br/>
expected of the class. The original post I responded to said most groups<br/>
seek monks for their pulling ability. Well, lets take a look at what the<br/>
other classes are sought after for:<br/>
<br/>
Cleric- healing<br/>
Druid- ok.. bad example, they do alot of things<br/>
Shaman- buffing (and see druid)<br/>
Wiz- blasting<br/>
War- soaking and dealing damage<br/>
Ranger- dealing damage<br/>
Enchanter- debuffing<br/>
rogue- backstabbing<br/>
Mag- ummm never grouped with one so I am not sure.<br/>
Necro- DoT<br/>
<br/>
All classes (except Druid and Shaman) have one thing they are outstanding<br/>
at, and other things they do ok, and some things they just plain stink at.<br/>
Why is it bad to be sought after because we are the best pullers in the<br/>
lands? Should Rogues be upset that the only thing anyone ever expects of<br/>
them is to backstab? The point I am trying rather long-windedly to make is<br/>
that while there are many abilities we do not have, the ones we do have are<br/>
vital in a group situation, which is how EQ was designed to be played (I<br/>
won&#39;t go into the whole solo vs group issue, as I am sure each of us has a<br/>
different opinion). Regardless of what class is played, if you know what<br/>
your strengths and weaknesses are and utilize them accordingly, you will be<br/>
a sought after party member.<br/>
<br/>
But thanks for the info on the perception and ability change that comes with<br/>
30. I look forward to finding yet another facet of the monk class.<br/>

&gt; Your entire opinion will change once you hit 30th level. You will start<br/>
&gt; outdamaging almost everyone. I am in the high 40s and have outdamaged 3<br/>
&gt; 50th<br/>
&gt; Paladins. We are a great tank AC goes up every level as Defense goes up<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; we dont have to hunt down all kinds of crap for armor. attacking 4 times<br/>
&gt; in<br/>
&gt; a round and hitting for 30 to 50 points each shot and then kicking for 90+<br/>
&gt; you will pull almost anything off a party member...clerics...in no time.<br/>
&gt; Give it some more time and I think you will see that all this changes.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I for one like the current damage we do. I don&#39;t think we should be<br/>
&gt; &gt; out-damaging a warrior swinging a big 2h weapon or dual wielding, and I<br/>
&gt; &gt; don&#39;t want to. They have the ac and the hp to protect them from those<br/>
&gt; 50+<br/>
&gt; &gt; damage blows that would chew us up in very little time. I have always<br/>
&gt; been<br/>
&gt; &gt; of the belief that the monk is NOT a tank. Our armor limitations prevent<br/>
&gt; us<br/>
&gt; &gt; from acting like one. With one MoB, we are fine as Dodge and Block will<br/>
&gt; &gt; serve us well, but if we get hit, we get hit HARD. With 2 or more MoB&#39;s,<br/>
&gt; our<br/>
&gt; &gt; Dodge and Block skill will not serve us nearly as well. We are more like<br/>
&gt; an<br/>
&gt; &gt; animated DoT spell, inflicting a steady amount of damage throughout the<br/>
&gt; &gt; duration of a fight. Few people can dish out the damage we can yet<br/>
&gt; remain<br/>
&gt; &gt; relatively unmolested. A drawback is it is very difficult to pull a MoB<br/>
&gt; off<br/>
&gt; &gt; a party member who is in trouble, and perhaps I would enjoy having a<br/>
&gt; Taunt<br/>
&gt; &gt; skill (no I don&#39;t think it is built into our special attacks), but I for<br/>
&gt; one<br/>
&gt; &gt; think the Monk class on the whole is doing just fine.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;  Lots of good points brought up in this discussion.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  I agree completely that we should get some kind of stunning attack,<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; our delay should beat most, if not all, weapons. As a very<br/>
&gt; well-equipped<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; monk<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; at lvl 40, I am routinely outdamaged by Ogre and Troll warriors, to<br/>
&gt; say<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; nothing of casters. So, though we have some unique abilities, monks<br/>
&gt; could<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; certainly stand some improvement. On my server, monks are sought<br/>
&gt; primarily<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; as<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; pullers rather than combatants, b/c of Feign pulling...<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  But until we get organized, and talk to Verant in some organized<br/>
&gt; manner,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; we<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; will get very little...<br/>
