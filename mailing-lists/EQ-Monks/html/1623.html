<div id="ygrps-yiv-1667059347">btw ac15 12str vs ac15 135hp<br/>
is<br/>
2 jagged bands & runed lava pendant<br/>
versus<br/>
2 plat fire emrald rings & glowwing bone collar<br/>
<br/>
I wear the best AC gear I can find and as it turns out I get +219hp<br/>
(plus whatever my +stamina gear gives) helps make clerics complete heals<br/>
more efficient. It also mean I can bandage for more hitpoints and I<br/>
think means my mend heals more.<br/>

&gt; Depends on the situation. Not pulling, then the 15 ac 15str. Pulling, then<br/>
&gt; the hp.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I do not believe I have ever replied to something on this or if I have it<br/>
&gt; has been a very longtime. I just had to say though that when my STR is<br/>
&gt; buffed up I notice a dramatic increase in the number of times I hit and the<br/>
&gt; amount of damage I do. This is not strict scientific data not checked or<br/>
&gt; anything but I do know that all my highs I have ever jotted down with flying<br/>
&gt; kick and weapons attacks are all from when being buffed. If this is a<br/>
&gt; coincidence then so be it. I do know that the 110 hps more I get from<br/>
&gt; wearing Plat FO rings as opposed to any of the better STR rings does not<br/>
&gt; mean a whole lot to me. If one of the mobs in Seb decides it really wants to<br/>
&gt; rip into me with my HPs I am a lost cause anyways.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;      AC is the top dog but beyond that choose what you want. Whatever<br/>
&gt; makes you happiest. I personally like AC/STR/MR. I just feel that even if it<br/>
&gt; boosts my chances to hit by one percent when I am wielding low delay low<br/>
&gt; damage weapons the more often I hit the more often I do my job which is<br/>
&gt; dealing damage. Lord knows Monks do not have the HPs to be a meat wall.<br/>
