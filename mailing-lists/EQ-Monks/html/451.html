<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-523662381">Lots of good points brought up in this discussion. <br/>
 I agree completely that we should get some kind of stunning attack, and that <br/>
our delay should beat most, if not all, weapons. As a very well-equipped monk <br/>
at lvl 40, I am routinely outdamaged by Ogre and Troll warriors, to say <br/>
nothing of casters. So, though we have some unique abilities, monks could <br/>
certainly stand some improvement. On my server, monks are sought primarily as <br/>
pullers rather than combatants, b/c of Feign pulling...<br/>
 But until we get organized, and talk to Verant in some organized manner, we <br/>
will get very little...<br/>
