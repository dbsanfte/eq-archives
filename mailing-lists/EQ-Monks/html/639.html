<div id="ygrps-yiv-1834972181">Yeah this is ok, altho there is supposedly an exp bonus for fighting in a<br/>
dungeon and there is no way to make money hunting animals in the karanas<br/>
which i think is essentially what you&#39;re suggesting.  of course that&#39;s not<br/>
so different than fighting crocs in oasis, except that there aren&#39;t campers,<br/>
so maybe the point is moot.<br/>

&gt;I can solo blues fairly easily.  However, I need to find a place that<br/>
&gt;has a good spawn rate of them, close to a general merchant, and some<br/>
&gt;place that isn&#39;t overly camped.  I could stay in the oasis and solo<br/>
&gt;blues easily.  But it is way overcamped to be good.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Personally, I think trying to solo in a dungeon is not the right way to<br/>
&gt;go about it.  You should instead find a place with non aggs or aggs spread<br/>
&gt;out enough that you can pick one off safely and safely kill it without<br/>
&gt;worrying about all the other creatures roaming about.<br/>
