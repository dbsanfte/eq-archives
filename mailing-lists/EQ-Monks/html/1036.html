<div id="ygrps-yiv-1266807298">I have always thought that monks should be characters of moderation and<br/>
poverty.  I have tried to play my character that way.  I have managed to<br/>
squrriel away 250 pp.  I figured that would handle most of my expenses for<br/>
the foreseeable future.  I buy muffins and water for food and drink.  All<br/>
of my magic tiems have been given to me or looted off of drops.  However, I<br/>
have reached an impasse.  Someone last night was auctioning off Serpent<br/>
bracers.  When I asked how much, I was shocked to hear 800 pp.  I guess<br/>
that I am going to have to break down and loot everything or hope that I<br/>
stumble across a raqre drop.  I am not going to be able to afford anything<br/>
better if I don&#39;t do so.  I think it is sad, that if I am going to be a<br/>
successful adventurer, I am going to have to be like the rest of the money<br/>
grubbing classes:  Rogues, Shadow Knights,  Warriors, Druids, Shamans,<br/>
Rangers, Bards,  Enchanters, Wizards, Magicians, Necromancers,  holy<br/>
Clerics and pious Paladins.  Does anyone else see a problem with this?<br/>
