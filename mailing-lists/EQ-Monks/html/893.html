<div id="ygrps-yiv-1255008425">The reason it&#39;s not workin for ya in lower guk is because of your lvl.  I&#39;m <br/>
gonna guess that most mobs in upper guk are green for you, or close to it.  <br/>
When you are above the lvl of the mob by a certain amount, then you won&#39;t <br/>
always pull all of them if don&#39;t see you.  At lvl 50, I can pull single <br/>
solusek kobolds because some are green, and even when they are low blue, most <br/>
every time, I can just stand and wait for one to see me, then yell and run at <br/>
me, but the other won&#39;t come because I&#39;m too high lvl for them.  So this is <br/>
why your throwing a star or knife at them works on easier mobs, but not on <br/>
the harder ones.<br/>
