<div id="ygrps-yiv-1926453722">Five friends and I went to one of the younger servers and started what we<br/>
feel is the optimal group for as many different situations as possible.<br/>
Since the plan is that we get together and play these chars once a week,<br/>
always together as a full group, we wanted to be as flexible as possible.<br/>
The make up is nearly identical to this group, except we have a Wizard<br/>
instead of a Druid.  We find this make an awesome team and the fights go<br/>
very, very quickly.<br/>
