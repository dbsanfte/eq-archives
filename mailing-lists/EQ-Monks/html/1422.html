<div id="ygrps-yiv-2032315915">The best advice I can give you is to have a group of really close friends<br/>
that you adventure with often.  Offer to help them get the items they need,<br/>
and most of the time, they&#39;ll be happy to help you get what you need.  I got<br/>
a few of my items in the pleasant surprise manner - helping out someone<br/>
managed to get me something I wasn&#39;t expecting - like the Black Silk Gloves.<br/>
<br/>
At 21 you&#39;re doing fine - people will probably tell you to buy this or that,<br/>
but you have about the same that I had at 21.  The great thing about monks<br/>
is they don&#39;t absolutely positively have to have a lot of gear, because in a<br/>
good group, they&#39;re hitting more than they&#39;re getting hit, but can take a<br/>
few hits if need be.<br/>
<br/>
Just a personal Zen moment:  If you make the game solely about the<br/>
acquisition of items, you&#39;re going to have two things happen:  #1 - you&#39;ll<br/>
get *Real* bored camping the items or camping money for the items #2 -<br/>
you&#39;ll eventually top out, with no more cool gear to get and get bored.<br/>
That&#39;s my experience with it anyways.  Not to say that getting stuff isn&#39;t<br/>
cool; it is fun to get that item you want or to get to the next level.  I&#39;ve<br/>
just seen too often people get item-jealousy and then the game gets<br/>
stressful (HURRY UP!  THE 5 LEGGED CROC SPAWNS IN 12 SECONDS!) and no fun.<br/>
That&#39;s just my opinion, thought I&#39;d make someone suffer it today. :)<br/>

beginners armor. )    What are the pieces that a level 21 monk should be<br/>
