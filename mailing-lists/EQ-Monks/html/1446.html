<div id="ygrps-yiv-996910916">Acutally you need not keep screaming every time, once you fall down the <br/>
first time, rather than standing back up and doing it again, just hit the FD <br/>
button again, once it recycles without standing up.  If you recieve &quot;SoANDSo <br/>
has fallen to the ground&quot; you have failed.  If you get no message, chances <br/>
are you succeded (this is not always true).  Go up to a creature that <br/>
normally doesnt aggro on you, something really green, smack it, then when <br/>
you know it is attacking you, FD.  If it &#39;forgets&#39; you, its working.  My <br/>
skill is over 100, and it works most all the time, I rarely get the message <br/>
anymore, but I get many times where I am being mobbed, and I will FD and <br/>
only SOME of the mobs forget me, and this is only for a second.  I am <br/>
currently in unrest and I can usually FD to most mobs that are up to a low <br/>
red to me.  Hags on the other hand I have only fooled a couple of times.  <br/>
Most of the times even when I time it inbetween their spells, they still <br/>
seem to not be fooled by my feign.<br/>

&gt;I got feign death last level and have had no luck with it at all.<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve been faithfully practicing (my death screams are still ringing<br/>
&gt;in my ears) and my skill is up to around 70, but it&#39;s only worked one<br/>
&gt;time.  Will this ever be useful?  Also what good is sneak and instill<br/>
&gt;doubt?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks,<br/>
