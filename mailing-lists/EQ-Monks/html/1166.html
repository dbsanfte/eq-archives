&gt;To-HIT rolls are affected by your ATTCK rating.  There are several ways to <br/>
&gt;raise<br/>
&gt;this:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1)<br/>
&gt;Increase your str.  I play a level 45 paladin aswel.  His melee skills <br/>
&gt;capped at<br/>
&gt;level 40, so his attack rating stopped going up EXCEPT when I got new <br/>
&gt;equipment<br/>
&gt;for him...Equipment that raised his STR. I like grouping with shamen or Druids<br/>
&gt;because with then in the group I can get my ATTCK above 900 if I yalup.  THis<br/>
&gt;DRASTICALLy reduces the amount of misses I get.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;2) Wolf form or any other state altering spells - enchanters get werewolf <br/>
&gt;form -<br/>
&gt;gives them 30 str! massive AC and HUGE attack rating buff (but of course they<br/>
&gt;cant melee anyway).  The ONE time in my EQ life when I saw my attack <br/>
&gt;rating hit<br/>
&gt;999 I was grouped with a level 49 shaman, level 43 bard and 50 druid. wolf <br/>
&gt;form,<br/>
&gt;str, Bard song and yalup stacked and my attack when through the roof!!!  I <br/>
&gt;loved<br/>
&gt;it!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>note that it is just *part* of the ATK rating which helps your to hit <br/>
roll.  gordon posted<br/>
that they combined the to hit portion of ATK with the max damage/chance to do<br/>
max damage portion back in beta.  so when your str goes up, you are really <br/>
changing<br/>
your max damage and chance to hit max damage.  altho i am thinking back to my<br/>
ad&d days where strength affected your to hit roll as well, heh.  oh well, <br/>
i believe<br/>
gordon says str does NOT affect to hit but i didn&#39;t save any of those old <br/>
posts cuz<br/>
i&#39;m not into min/maxing or being a roll player.  i&#39;d rather just hang out <br/>
and have fun<br/>
and meet people (although i&#39;m not a huge role player either, heh).</div>
