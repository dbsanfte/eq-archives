<div id="ygrps-yiv-926424193">Here is my expierence, FD only works if the mobs have completely finished all <br/>
their actions for the round. If you FD and one still has yet to hit you or a <br/>
spell still has to go off against you it does not matter, it will fail. I do <br/>
not know about against DoT and that is an interesting question. I do know I <br/>
have fought the spiders in Guk several times and Feigned successfelly while <br/>
poisoned. And rabies have never seemed to be a problem. I also like the range <br/>
of aggression type suggestion as in my expierences this has proven to be <br/>
true. In Guk I have almost always had the stupid frogs come running after me <br/>
when I had Feigned, the spiders on the other hand depend how far away from <br/>
them I am. Even if I am just over into the next chamber they do not pursue. <br/>
The same in Unrest, Dark Boned Skels to my great surprise did not come after <br/>
me when I got up from a feign, but you can imagine my surprise when the <br/>
Barbed Skel did not ignore me and came back and whoopped my rear. Well, this <br/>
is my thoughts on it. I still do not think it is the awesome skill I had <br/>
heard of before getting it. I would much prefer to have something that would <br/>
help the rest of the party a little more and not be so much of a simple <br/>
self-preservation thing. I know the responses about leading mobs away and I <br/>
have done this, but still those situations are pretty rare. Usually it ends <br/>
out with the call for run going out and me just hitting feign when everyone <br/>
has minimal time to head out the nearest door before I die. As I am only 20th <br/>
level I always looked forward to the views of more expierenced players.</div>
