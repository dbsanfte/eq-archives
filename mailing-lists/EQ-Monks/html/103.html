<div id="ygrps-yiv-1881598903">I leveled from 10 to 13 quickly by killing Wisps and YKs in West <br/>
Commonlands.  The trick to keep from dying is to get SOW cast on you by a <br/>
friendly Shaman (at least 9th level) or Druid (at least 14th level).  This <br/>
will let you outrun the monsters if you get in trouble.  Make sure you have <br/>
magic (netted/woven/mesh) gloves.  The key to getting SOW is to offer a <br/>
donation every time you get it.  3-5 gold is probably good and they <br/>
shouldn&#39;t mind too much.  You should be able to make good money with the <br/>
lightstones from Wisps as well.  Also, kill any orc pawns and skeles you <br/>
see for loot and sell any weapons at the inn by the guards so they don&#39;t <br/>
slow you down.<br/>

Subject:	[EQ-Monks] Ok, Here&#39;s another, then.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been playing my monk since the first week the game was released.   My <br/>
played time is now about 4 day, 6 hours.  Is this about right for a lvl 11 <br/>
guy?  What are your played times for your lvl 32 monk?  I&#39;m just interested <br/>
in knowning if I&#39;m behind the curve here.  I just dont have the patience to <br/>
get to lvl 17!  It is frustrating.  Right now I&#39;m in Befallen, as a lvl 11. <br/>
 Is there a more appropriate place that I should go perhaps?  Right now I&#39;m <br/>
not worried about RPing too much, because I die way too much, so I guess <br/>
that means I just want to lvl ASAP.  Where&#39;s a good place to get EXP at my <br/>
level?  Grouping tips/anything would be appreciated.<br/>
