<div id="ygrps-yiv-140822839">I got levels 14-20 in Oasis, but that was long before the major overcrowding<br/>
problems there.<br/>
<br/>
I would recommend levels 15-24 in Highpass.  It&#39;s definitely doable.  Some<br/>
things were still blue to me at level 26 there (fanatics, mercenaries, and<br/>
the named orcs), and the loot is pretty good.  Lots of ringmail, and a shop<br/>
within a short distance to sell at.  You can also get the Shralok Pack from<br/>
Recfek Shralok, which is a 8 slot 25% weight reduction pack.  It&#39;s pending<br/>
lore, but it&#39;s been that way for months.  Handy thing to have.<br/>

&gt; Hail all you experienced monks out there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What recommendations does everyone have for places to hunt solo by levels?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My character is only level 21, but here were his favorites so far&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Level Area Hunted<br/>
&gt; 1-4 Freeport<br/>
&gt; 5-10 Rivervale (with runnyeye bead quest)<br/>
&gt; 11-12 Black Burrow (with gnoll teeth quest)<br/>
&gt; 13-16 Wisp island (gls quest, good money and exp!)<br/>
&gt; 17-18 EK (gnoll reavers)<br/>
&gt; 19-20 HH (gnolls solo and orcs in a group)<br/>
&gt; 21-22?  Gorge hunting mino&#39;s<br/>
&gt; 22+? Not there yet............1 bubble to go!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The quests seem to really speed up the leveling.  Has anyone else found<br/>
