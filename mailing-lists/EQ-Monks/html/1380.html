Steel Warrior Initiation: This quest can be done around level 6 or so<br/>
(lower with a group). Over the course of it, you will receive several<br/>
faction changes raising Steel Warriors, Guards of Qeynos and Knights of<br/>
Truth and Lowering Corrupt Qeynos Guards and Freeport Militia.  Go to<br/>
Brin Stolunger in Warriors Guild S. Qeynos, tell him you are a [young<br/>
steel warrior]. He will give you a ten slot arena sack and tell you to<br/>
collect 5 bat wings and 5 snake scales and combine them inside to create<br/>
a full sack. When you give it back to him, you get a few copper, xp,<br/>
faction and a note that you are to take to Axe Broadsmith in Qeynos<br/>
Hills. (He&#39;s in the hut by the pond) When you give him the note, he will<br/>
tell you to kill the [strange skeleton] across the pond. When you kill<br/>
it, bring it&#39;s skull to him as proof, and you&#39;ll get more coppers, xp,<br/>
faction and a letter of recommendation to take back to Brin Stolunger.<br/>
When you return to Qeynos and give the letter to Brin, you get MORE<br/>
coins, xp, faction, and another note. This one you take downstairs to<br/>
the animal pits below the arena, and give it to Grahan Rothkar who tells<br/>
you it&#39;s time for your Final Test. He will give you a key to open one of<br/>
the animal pens so you can enter and fight a young lion. When you kill<br/>
the young lion, bring it&#39;s pelt and meat to Grahan and you&#39;ll get MORE<br/>
copper, xp, faction and TADA... Strongbear Bracers.  And he welcomes you<br/>
to the Steel Warriors! (Submitted by Mistabus).<br/>
<br/>
If it works it probably take 30 minutes to do and be enough faction to<br/>
be high amiable.  I&#39;m going to try tomorrow afternoon!</div>
