<div id="ygrps-yiv-387488079">It only makes sense to use your Mend the second you are around two<br/>
bubbles down for 2 reasons.<br/>
<br/>
First off it really doens&#39;t matter when you mend, as long as you know<br/>
you are going to need it, in this case, any time you lose more than<br/>
about 1 1/2 bubbles you are going to need it, so I make a point to<br/>
Always use mine around 2 bubbles down.  Reason one is so your cleric<br/>
(if you are in a party) doesn&#39;t waste mana on you.  I always tell my <br/>
clerics, only pop a heal my way if I drop below 3 bubbles.  That way<br/>
I can use my mend without the fear of the cleric casting a heal on me<br/>
and one of us wasting either.<br/>
<br/>
Second main reason, specially when soloing, is that if you use it at the <br/>
beginning of a big combat (ie when you first reach about 2 bubbles<br/>
down) then you will have that mend button pop up a little bit more<br/>
quicker for the next combat, rather than probably having to go the<br/>
next combat without it.<br/>

&gt;It seems to me that the chances of it failing are a LOT higher if you use<br/>
&gt;Mend and you are at 50% health or lower.  I&#39;m level 24 and my skill is only<br/>
&gt;90 (never bothered practicing it when sitting in town babbling with people,<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m going to have to start now. :)).  If I use it when I only have 2 <br/>
&gt;bubbles<br/>
&gt;of health gone, it seems to work almost all the time.  I can only recall it<br/>
&gt;failing twice, in recent memory, and only worsening my wounds once.  I<br/>
&gt;always try and use it when I&#39;ve lost 2 bubbles.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Of the monks that I know, it seems that I have the worst luck at getting<br/>
&gt;my<br/>
&gt; &gt; Mend skill to work, especially in high risk combat situations.  I have<br/>
&gt; &gt; maxed out the skill at 17th level.  This is not an exaggeration.<br/>
&gt;Yesterday<br/>
&gt; &gt; I was soloing scarecrows in West Karana.  I was earning a little Xp and<br/>
&gt; &gt; practicing my newly aquired FD skill, which did work,  I used mend 4 <br/>
&gt;times<br/>
&gt; &gt; in about a 2 hour period of time.  It worked once, failed twice, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; worsened my wounds the last time, which killed me when I had a white<br/>
&gt; &gt; scarecrow on its last legs.  My character basically committed suicide at<br/>
&gt; &gt; the point where he was going to win.  As I said, it seems I have the <br/>
&gt;worse<br/>
&gt; &gt; luck with Mend.  Does any one else have this problem or am I just the<br/>
&gt; &gt; victim of bad numbers?<br/>
