<div id="ygrps-yiv-822709481">I believe he asks you to bring back Dareb. If you ask<br/>
him about Dareb (or whoever he told youto bring back)<br/>
he will explain that one went looking for another monk<br/>
and that if they perished to bring back their remains<br/>
so that they can be honored with burial. You shouldn&#39;t<br/>
need to speak with anyone else. Good journeys and my<br/>
truth guide you.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m a fp monk who recently went to qeynos and back<br/>
&gt; (to get my white-orange<br/>
&gt; sash, and to travel the world some).  I thought when<br/>
&gt; I smacked the gnolls<br/>
&gt; in bb, that it gave faction to the fp monk guild. I<br/>
&gt; know they gave me<br/>
&gt; faction to the silent fist clan.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; one question.  for the red headband, I know you need<br/>
&gt; 3 heads from paw.<br/>
&gt; but when I asked about the red headband, all the guy<br/>
&gt; said was to find<br/>
&gt; brother someone, and bring them back to the guild<br/>
&gt; (not tomer, did that).<br/>
&gt; am I supposed to talk to someone and find out that<br/>
&gt; that guy is dead, then<br/>
&gt; get a new quest?<br/>
