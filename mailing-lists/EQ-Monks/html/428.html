<div id="ygrps-yiv-184649174">Only a few problems with crit hits on monks....<br/>
<br/>
1) Monks hit duel wield and dual attack much more often then other classes.<br/>
2) We aren&#39;t really supposed to be the guys that hit for much higher then 40<br/>
points per punch anyways.<br/>
<br/>
Only thing i see a problem with is...<br/>
<br/>
1) Pets getting gay settings  (i.e. -- lvl 49 necro pets with a FS dagger<br/>
with 19 delay hits for higher then a monk, and now much quicker)<br/>
<br/>
2) How does wearing something make you hit faster, monks should without a<br/>
doubt get quicker punches, not higher dmg punches quicker punches..<br/>
<br/>
3 We need quicker punches : )<br/>
