<b>Subject:</b> Re:Hunting Guide for Monks <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1695547690">My advice on where to hunt:  The best xp by far is solo xp.  A monk with bind<br/>
wound skill and mend can solo with little down time.  Take on medium level blues<br/>
(the sorta stuff you can kill without losing too many hp and you can pretty much<br/>
go on a non-stop killing spree.<br/>
<br/>
At level 9 - head to misty thicket - you can solo there to level 15 or even 16. <br/>
Great xp, lots of stuff to kill, not much competition.  Be sure to get bound in<br/>
Rivervale.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
From levels 13 - 20 you can SOLO in the gorge of King Xorb.  Start with mudites<br/>
and gobline veterans etc, then move onto GORGE minitaurs and muddite elders.  Be<br/>
carefull when pulling them - sometimes pulling one muddite brings several. I<br/>
always pull to the running eye zone to be safe. <br/>
<br/>
From levels 18 - 22 the area right outside the zone of the Xorb Gorge in East<br/>
Karana is great solo xp.  I pick on lion patriarchs. gorge hounds  etc.  Leave<br/>
the crag spiders for when you are partnered with someone who can cure poison.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
From level 20 or 21 head to lake rathe.  If you can get one of the islands free,<br/>
find an island with one or two aviaks and solo em for some more xp ( this will<br/>
take you to level 23 or 24)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
From level 24 head to dungeons and group up.  The best xp from now on will be in<br/>
groups in dungeons where there are lots of spawns - High Keep, caszic thule,<br/>
Guktop and Paw. As a monk likely your job will be &quot;puller&quot; so be sure to<br/>
apprentice yourself to a knowledgeable tank in which ever dungeon you choose and<br/>
learn the special pull tactics and lay of the dungeon from him.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Soloing like this (in these areas) you could reach level 24 in about 2-3 weeks<br/>
playing 6 hours a day ( depending on how often you run back to town and how<br/>
often you die).  Try to avoid crowds and hunt in as small a group as possible<br/>
while in the outdoors - spawns are not abundant (as they are in dungeons) and so<br/>
group is not really worth it IMHO.  Of course the aviaks in SKarana are there<br/>
but that place is SOOO crowded that it is just not worth it!  110 people in<br/>
south karana on any given night is rediculous.  If you want to level quickly<br/>
avoid crowds and group only where there are abundant spawns.</div>
