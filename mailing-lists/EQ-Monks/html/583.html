<div id="ygrps-yiv-792562853">Oh come on man, you can have any amount of money at any level (within<br/>
reason), regardless of whether or not you have been twinked.  On any given<br/>
day a level 20 to go to lavastorm, kill rock dervishes for a couple hours<br/>
and make 100pp easy, while gaining no experience.  Money is NOT a difficult<br/>
thing to come by if that&#39;s what your going after.  Heck, just kill a bunch<br/>
of wisps and grab all the lightstones and sell them to the merchants and<br/>
you&#39;ll still make a killing.  Plus who knows, maybe the guy is a blacksmith<br/>
and made his money that way.  It&#39;s not at all unreasonable to have thousands<br/>
of pp as a monk at level 22 to spend on things, because we don&#39;t exactly<br/>
have a very expensive profession.<br/>

&gt; p.s.  ill say this in plain ole english...not drunk speek.  I saw a<br/>
&gt; 17-19th level SK hunting in Oasis.  Full suit of rubi/carnal armor.<br/>
&gt; Purity Belt, Dark Reaver, BP Choker, Plantinum Silver Ruby Veil, Dwarven<br/>
&gt; Work Boots and a White Wolf Hide Cloak.  Whats the fun at that<br/>
&gt; point...when everything you want for your character you already have.<br/>
&gt; There is just no point.  I wish twinking was a bannable offense.<br/>
