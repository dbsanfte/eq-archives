I am inclined to agree with you. Another thing to consider is the server one<br/>
plays on. Older servers tend to have a greater abundance of high level items<br/>
available at a lower cost than newer servers. I have experienced this on<br/>
Fennin<br/>
Ro. A few of the items that our level 28 monk wears are items that I also<br/>
wear.<br/>
Many of which I have acquired recently at what I would consider low prices. I<br/>
had the good fortune to purchase a Serpentine Bracer for 225 platinums.<br/>
Because<br/>
I spent much of my early time hunting wisps and recent levels hunting<br/>
gargoyles, I have found myself with more than a few platinums to spend on<br/>
items. And I have worked on my tailoring and brewing skills for some time,<br/>
so I<br/>
have a few cured silk pieces and the Gauntlets of Wu. Now if only I could find<br/>
a pair of those obsidian bead hoops as well, I could better improve some of my<br/>
other trade skills : )<br/>

&gt;Mmmh, what are you talking about ? I really think that equipment can be<br/>
&gt;obtained at around 30. If you camp a lot of valuable items and you trade<br/>
&gt;them well, you can easily have that (Sol A ?!). Don&#39;t jump on conclusions<br/>
&gt;too fast please.<br/>
