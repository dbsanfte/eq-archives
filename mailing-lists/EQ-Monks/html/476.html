&gt;yellows at once. Why? Because of her debuffs. The only 2 buffs she ever<br/>
&gt;casts on me are Alacrity and Cloud (weaker versions of Clarity and<br/>
&gt;Augmentation I believe. Please correct me if I am wrong.) I don&#39;t know the<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Alacrity (lvl 24) is a speed buff. Increases attack speed by 122 - 144<br/>
Cloud (lvl 20) is a +14AC bonus<br/>
<br/>
Clarity (lvl 29) increases Mana regeneration by 15% - 50%<br/>
Augmentation (lvl 29) has the following effects:<br/>
         Increase Attack Speed +115<br/>
         Increase AC +22<br/>
         Increase Agility + 22<br/>
<br/>
         In all honesty, there isn&#39;t much else she can give you besides a <br/>
+10 Str buff and maybe a damage shield. The damage shields available at lvl <br/>
24 are not really worth it. Mana is better spent elsewhere.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;As for their Travel spells, illusion is self only, invis from any class is<br/>
&gt;finicky at best (I find camo and superior camo to be more reliable), and I<br/>
&gt;am not aware that they get Enduring Breath and Levitate. I do know that my<br/>
&gt;partner, a lvl 27 enchanter, has never cast either one on me, so perhaps it<br/>
&gt;is a higher level spell. Again, please correct me if I am mistaken.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>         Lev is gained at lvl 16 and Enduring Breath is gained at lvl 12. <br/>
Illusions are self only, but they are helpful when you need to buy or sell <br/>
from/to vendors. Enchanters seem to get the best prices in foreign <br/>
cities.   :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>         Actually Monks are in desperate need of a Stun effect. Considering <br/>
the LOW MR that we have naturally, we are toast when fighting even a green <br/>
spellcasting Mob. EVERY other Melee class has the ability to Stun or <br/>
Interrupt spellcasting. Monks are very deficient in this area and it does <br/>
affect balance in my opinion.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I stick by my assertion that the<br/>

&gt;Communicate efficiently and 2) know the strengths and weaknesses of your<br/>
&gt;class and play within your strengths.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>         Even more important is know the Strengths and Limitations of the <br/>
OTHER classes in your group. Know what they can and can&#39;t do and you will <br/>
be able to save yourself and your group a lot of traveling to get corpses. <br/>
This is especially true if you are the puller for your group.</div>
