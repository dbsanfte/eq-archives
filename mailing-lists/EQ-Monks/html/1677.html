Actually to add to the last post I just read, depending on your skill, you will see more critical failures also.  It is common knowledge among the monk commuity that Mend will not only fail more often, but will Critically fail more often between the skill lvls of 60 to about 90. If your skill is in this zone, don&#39;t count on Mend to help you much, and don&#39;t use it as a last resort during your battles.  <br/>
<br/>
On a personal note, at those lvls I used mend as soon as I lost 25% of my health in battle, if for some reason it failed, or critically failed, I still had at least half life to do something.  If it was successful, I was back at full health.  and the Mend counter ticking away.  If you wait till your down to 25% to hit Mend you might be surprised when it fails, or critically fails, which bTW a Critical failed mend can never kill you, it will ALWAYS leave you at 5hp or so.  not enough to last one round against a mob, but if your just sitting there and hit mend while your under 25% you won&#39;t DIE.<br/>
<br/>
Once you skill hits 101, it will NEVER fail again. Mend is one of the monks biggest assets, learn to use it correctly and it wil save your life more times thatn you can count.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; Many thanks for the information! <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I will work hard to make sure I use it as much as I can! <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Question.... If we as monks have to keep our weight limit down, how <br/>
&gt; do we ever make any money?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Wu&#39;s armor cost pp to buy along with jewelry STR and DEX. <br/>
