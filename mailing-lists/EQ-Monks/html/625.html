<div id="ygrps-yiv-1546274188">Ok how about this. Being 19th Season sucks It seems to take forever to<br/>
raise, I was thinking of places to hunt any ideas. I was in Lake Rathe and<br/>
killing things like Dry Bones but I really hate to wait for dark, I was<br/>
wondering if there was a Commander in Paw that I can solo without 2 or 3<br/>
other Gnolls jumping in.<br/>

&gt; &gt;I think another idea about the level limits could be the con system, if<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; &gt;con certain level and you do not get experience from them, the same<br/>
should<br/>
&gt; &gt;work in reverse for items, level groups should work for instance 1-5 5-15<br/>
&gt; &gt;15-25 25-35 35-50 or something of the like. That would solve a lot of<br/>
those<br/>
&gt; &gt;problems, but in my real opinion, I just really love this game, it may be<br/>
&gt; &gt;because I am still so new, haven&#39;t even got past my first month and my<br/>
19th<br/>
&gt; &gt;(almost 20th Level) Monk is my pride and joy. I really enjoy when people<br/>
&gt; &gt;look at my gear and say nice spread, I worked damn hard for my stuff and<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; &gt;is my own personnel satisfaction I get from my character. If I see<br/>
someone<br/>
&gt; &gt;else who is twinked, I think that&#39;s good for them, I hope they enjoy that<br/>
&gt; &gt;because I know they will enjoyment of the game for they have nothing to<br/>
look<br/>
&gt; &gt;forward too, so those people won&#39;t be around too much longer.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Why do they have nothing to look forward to?  Maybe they are second<br/>
characters<br/>
&gt; trying to get to where his friends are so they can group together.  Maybe<br/>
&gt; they are<br/>
&gt; trying to get to places they haven&#39;t seen yet because they would die<br/>
almost<br/>
&gt; instantly.  Some people don&#39;t play the game strictly to get cool items.<br/>
