<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-279301070"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Hail Fellow Monks<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am a tailor of a good deal of experience and was<br/>
&gt; hoping that someone could answer a question for me.  I<br/>
&gt; hunt in East Commonlands and therefore tailoring is a<br/>
&gt; simple skill to use because pelts are so common.<br/>
&gt; However, Patchwork has become too easy for me and I<br/>
&gt; have done some research into Studded Leather.  As most<br/>
&gt; of you know, making studded armor requires studs.  I<br/>
&gt; do not wish to take the time to make studs because<br/>
&gt; what I like most about tailoring is I do not have to<br/>
&gt; spend time doing it, I just kill animals and use their<br/>
&gt; pelts.   Does anyone know if it is possible to buy<br/>
&gt; studs, or anyone on the Karana Server near Freeport<br/>
&gt; who sells them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you are pursuing making studded armor because of the satisfaction of<br/>
having made your armor yourself I wish you good fortune.  If you are making<br/>
it because you want either to upgrade your armor or plan on selling it I am<br/>
afraid you will most likely be disappointed.  Studded armor unfortunately is<br/>
far to difficult to make for the amount of protection it provides.  For the<br/>
studs you must find a talented blacksmith willing to make them for you.  If<br/>
you can find one they will most likely be priced at 1PP each.  If you can<br/>
find someone to make them for you I recommend spending all you can to get as<br/>
many studs as possible.   Because of the difficulty of studded armor you<br/>
will go though many, many studs on your way a suit of armor.  Also, the<br/>
tailoring skill seems to improve very slowly after you have reached an<br/>
ability of 26.  The other problem is that studded armor does not provide as<br/>
good protection as other types of armor you could find on the corpses of<br/>
certain creatures in Norrath.  But as I stated at the beginning, if you are<br/>
able to make and wear a full suit of studded the self satisfaction could be<br/>
well worth all other obstacles.<br/>
