<div id="ygrps-yiv-1652325285">Man, do I know your pain...<br/>
	I figure that my monk didn&#39;t really become a viable and <br/>
important contributing member of my party until I was level 30 or so. <br/>
(Talk about a  LONG adolescence!)  Monks are out-damaged by all other <br/>
melee classes and hybrids (with level-appropriate equipment) for most <br/>
of our lives.<br/>
	Once you hit 30 (and get flying kick), things begin to <br/>
change.  At that point, only warriors really can out-damage us (with <br/>
the new patch, that is - before it was more even, depending on his <br/>
equipment, of course).  As far as what would be a compelling reason <br/>
for a group to select us over a warrior goes... I can&#39;t think of one. <br/>
I stick with my monk because I have a ball playing him and the party <br/>
I&#39;m in has leaned to recognize that we bring benefits that are harder <br/>
to define.<br/>
