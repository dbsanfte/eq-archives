<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-335551340">I can solo blues fairly easily.  However, I need to find a place that<br/>
has a good spawn rate of them, close to a general merchant, and some<br/>
place that isn&#39;t overly camped.  I could stay in the oasis and solo<br/>
blues easily.  But it is way overcamped to be good.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I think trying to solo in a dungeon is not the right way to<br/>
go about it.  You should instead find a place with non aggs or aggs spread<br/>
out enough that you can pick one off safely and safely kill it without<br/>
worrying about all the other creatures roaming about.<br/>

&gt; I know this is gonna sound sarcastic with no tone being able to be conveyed,<br/>
&gt; but try not to look at it this way.  The game was designed for groups.  Once<br/>
&gt; you hit a certain level (different for different classes) it&#39;s just almost<br/>
&gt; impossible<br/>
&gt; to solo.  I know for my bard, he sucked at soloing from about 20-25 in unrest,<br/>
&gt; but now at 27 i am able to solo blues again, thanks to fear song and chains<br/>
&gt; song.  (This is the part that will sound nasty, but i really don&#39;t mean it<br/>
&gt; that way)<br/>
&gt; If you only have 10 or 15 minutes I would suggest just playing some other<br/>
&gt; non eq game of which there are many good ones.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Hi everyone, I&#39;m new to the list, but my monk has hit level 20, and<br/>
&gt; &gt;has decided he has killed enough crocodiles.  I&#39;m looking for some<br/>
&gt; &gt;place that I could solo from level 20-30 and maybe a place that even<br/>
&gt; &gt;gives good monk loot.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Also, what kind of armor should I be looking for?  I&#39;m pretty much<br/>
&gt; &gt;straight mesh and LJ tunic.<br/>
