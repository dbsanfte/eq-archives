&gt; and if a friend offered me serpentine bracers and an exe hood i wouldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; take em.  I don&#39;t need em at my level and when I get to the appropriate<br/>
&gt; level i want to go camp for them....it&#39;s how the game was meant to be<br/>
&gt; played and until they change the whole camping system I will continue to<br/>
&gt; play it in that fashion.  Twinkers like you already screwed the<br/>
&gt; PoF.....whats next....Lower Guk...permafrost.....<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Most people think camping is no fun.  I&#39;d much rather move around and fight<br/>
different things.  As for how the game was meant to be played....  Well,<br/>
that speaks for itself.<br/>
<br/>
Think of that every time you get into a car, or a plane, or a boat.  You are<br/>
equipped with boots or shoes or bare feet (maybe high heels, you never<br/>
know).  If you were &quot;meant&quot; to travel any other way than walking or running,<br/>
you&#39;d have wings, flippers, or wheels.<br/>
<br/>
The idea that something must be done the way it was &quot;meant&quot; to be done is<br/>
plain silly.  If we all thought that way, we&#39;d all be living in the trees<br/>
still and not speaking or writing, but that&#39;s not the way it&#39;s &quot;supposed&quot; to<br/>
be.<br/>
