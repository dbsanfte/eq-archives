<div id="ygrps-yiv-4050757"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Allright, I am a level 24 Monk currently hunting in<br/>
&gt;South Karana Aviak Tree... and sometimes the Tesh Mec<br/>
&gt;Gnolls.  Been here for 4 levels and have had a great<br/>
&gt;time and enjoyed the exp.  So my question is where<br/>
&gt;should I be hunting now?  Should I stay here or move<br/>
&gt;on to other places?  I could really use an idea.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Personally, I love Highkeep. You can stay there until your low 30&#39;s,<br/>
getting great exp and loot. There is a bank, vendors, food supply, and even<br/>
a gem merchant at your disposal. Plus, you can be bound right in the zone,<br/>
so death (which is very, very rare as long as you use common sense) is as<br/>
painless as possible.<br/>
<br/>
The basement of Highkeep is divided up into four rooms, named after the<br/>
type of goblin that is the dominant spawn in it. <br/>
<br/>
The lookout room is smallest, with only two spawn points that are well<br/>
spaced out. At 24th level, you and a healer could thrive in this room. Any<br/>
more than two PC&#39;s, though, and experience gets spread out pretty thin.<br/>
<br/>
Next is the guard room, which is largest and has may spawn points. This<br/>
room requires a full party of 20-25 level players to run effectively.<br/>
Guards occasionally have FS weapons, which can be sold quickly so you<br/>
aren&#39;t weighed down by them.<br/>
<br/>
Third is the warrior room. This requires a full group of levels 25-33.<br/>
Warriors range up to 32nd level, and commonly carry FS weapons and<br/>
occasionally small bronze armor. Spawn is pretty frequent, and battles can<br/>
get very intense if goblins aren&#39;t dispatched in a hurry.<br/>
<br/>
Last is the raider room. spawn is slower than in the warrior room, but<br/>
raiders are a few levels tougher. Often smaller groups try to control the<br/>
room because of the slower spawn rate. The problem comes when a weak party<br/>
loses control. Often a bad player will train several raiders or seers up to<br/>
the warrior room for help, which can result in a multitude of deaths. Even<br/>
if warriors and raiders are trained to the guards, it takes a long time for<br/>
them to be killed. On several occasions I&#39;ve seen entire parties forced to<br/>
zone because six guards couldn&#39;t kill a few raiders fast enough to save the<br/>
players.<br/>
<br/>
As a monk, of course, we have the advantage that we can feign and wait for<br/>
the goblins to be killed, saving ourselves the trouble of zoning. Knowing<br/>
the paths that the goblins run will easily allow you to add several seconds<br/>
of lead time which you can use to feign successfully.<br/>
<br/>
Like I said, with some common sense (don&#39;t be a hero and try to solo a<br/>
warrior or raider), this zone is phenomenal experience and will pad your<br/>
bank account quite nicely.<br/>
