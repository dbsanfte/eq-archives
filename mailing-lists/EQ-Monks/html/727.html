<div id="ygrps-yiv-904268613">Gnoll Embalmers are what drops the Skull of Jhen&#39;Tra.  I have always gotten<br/>
a Skull from one, but I have heard stories where this may not be the case.<br/>
<br/>
They are a level 20 mob from memory,  they only seem to appear at Dusk or<br/>
Dawn, basically when the undead appears or disappears from the spawn<br/>
locations.<br/>
<br/>
The spawn at same locations as the Gnoll High Shamans and if you are not<br/>
high enough level so that the other Gnolls are green, they will join in.<br/>
Try and con all nearby gnolls before you attack, or even better get yourself<br/>
a group.<br/>
<br/>
When the Embalmers appear,  if you can attack one early enough it will not<br/>
have enough time to summon its pet.<br/>
<br/>
Please be warned they are Necromancers and they can cast some nasty spells,<br/>
DOTs and Fear.<br/>
<br/>
The Embalmers also drop a plus 10 mana hoop, Crysknife plus other<br/>
miscellaneous items on occasion.<br/>
<br/>
The Skull is a lore item, so you can only really obtain one at a time.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; As part of the Purple Headband quest, I recently was able to acquire<br/>
Zaharn&#39;s Coronet from within Permafrost.  I&#39;ve been holding the Dagger of<br/>
Marnek for some time now, just waiting for the day when I could obtain the<br/>
coronet (it being the hardest item of the 3 to get).  Now I am left with<br/>
needing the final component, the Skull of Jhen&#39;Tra.  At first I auctioned<br/>
for one, not sure if I had the energy to adventure to a strange land and<br/>
attempt to find it.  But now I think that I shall!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Does anyone have any tips on this mob (Which Gnoll Embalmer? Level<br/>
needed?) and it&#39;s resident zone (Lake Rathe?).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Any information would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
