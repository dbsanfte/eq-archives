<div id="ygrps-yiv-966064953">Ever see a lvl 40+ caster?  It almost NEVER gets interrupted unless it is <br/>
stunned by a spell or bash.  Mobs don&#39;t play by the same rules as we do.  So <br/>
yes, the mob can get the spell off and what if it&#39;s SOWed?  It runs, your <br/>
monks can&#39;t catch it and it comes back with a train.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, <br/>
it&#39;d be a blast, but you need some other support.</div>
