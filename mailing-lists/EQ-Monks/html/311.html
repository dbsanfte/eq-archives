<div id="ygrps-yiv-2122785118">Just hunt close to the zone wall.<br/>
hunt along the zone wall opposite the dessert.  Not only is it safe there,<br/>
but you wont get lost - run with zone wall on the right to enter, and run<br/>
with the zone wall on teh left to flee ( tothe East Commonland zone)  <br/>
<br/>
Pull all your wisps and kodiaks to teh zone wall to kill.  I have never<br/>
had problems with giants or ghouls in this area using this method.<br/>

&gt; West Commonlands is indeed much more populated with wisps.  Try to get SOW <br/>
&gt; from someone - offer a druid or shaman a few gold and say that you will <br/>
&gt; come to them, or try and find one and ask while you are there... If you <br/>
&gt; stay between the trail and the inn (directly west of where the trail is), <br/>
&gt; Giants will rarely bother you. Kizdean Gix is mean, but never bothered my <br/>
&gt; monk...  I usually roam around the hills surrounding the inn, and stay <br/>
&gt; close enough to the zone to make a run...  Other than than, bind yourself <br/>
&gt; to Qeynos and take the boat to Wisp (Kerra) Isle...  Find out where the <br/>
&gt; wisps spawn and camp there with a few other people... Good exp through <br/>
&gt; level 15 and excellent money...<br/>

&gt; First post to this list, woo.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m 11th lvl on the Prexus server, and just recently obtained woven gloves.<br/>
&gt; Since I can now actually hit them, I&#39;ve been searching for wisps in E<br/>
&gt; Commonlands and finding maybe one per hour of real time (!). Now, I know<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s a busy zone and that their heavily hunted there -- is there perhaps a<br/>
&gt; better place to find them? I&#39;ve been avoiding W Commons due to the<br/>
&gt; likelihood of being crushed by hill giants and/or smacked around by the<br/>
&gt; griffs, not to mention double-teamed by young kodiaks...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks in advance,<br/>
