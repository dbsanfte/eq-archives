<div id="ygrps-yiv-1288052371">It&#39;s a little late to change the looks of characters (i.e.: adding the blue<br/>
look to monks with a mesh tunic, etc) because it would require a total<br/>
rework of the art files. Anyone remember those lovely 300 meg downloads in<br/>
beta 3?<br/>

I think even a lower level glove that could proc root would be a great too.<br/>
I<br/>
mean we are sentenced to hunt down gnoll after gnoll with the Qeynos quests,<br/>
yet those gnolls are the worst creatures I have ever encountered with<br/>
regard to<br/>
fleeing the battle! Even though most of the critters conned blue to me, they<br/>
would split with a third of their life left while their evil twin skippy was<br/>
doing the bash and stun on my behind to prevent the kill chase. By the time<br/>
the<br/>
second gnoll was down, the first returned with his big brothers! Needless to<br/>
say, death was a common function of my monk through levels 8 to 10 while<br/>
completing the orange headband quest. I do not even want to try the quest<br/>
for<br/>
the red headband since it is in another burrow filled with gnolls. A nice<br/>
pair<br/>
of gloves that could proc root would definitely ameliorate that situation.<br/>
<br/>
As for new monk animations/graphics, I am all for that. Why can we not see<br/>
the<br/>
mesh tunic in blue on our person? Or even different jewels that we may be<br/>
wearing. There is very little differentiation between one monk and another<br/>
no<br/>
matter what the level. A level three in patchwork is just as styling as I<br/>
am in<br/>
a mesh tunic (and little else :). It seems that more could be done.  Also, a<br/>
little variety in attacks would be nice or some spiffy fireworks on contact<br/>
for<br/>
our &quot;magical&quot; special attacks.<br/>
<br/>
Really, I am just dreaming of things to comlain about... I have been greatly<br/>
satisfied with playing a monk. I think I can solo well, and I am always<br/>
welcome<br/>
in groups. I spend too much time wandering Norrath and trading languages, so<br/>
I<br/>
may never break into the teens in level, but I am enjoying myself.<br/>
<br/>
Good fortunes to you,<br/>

&gt;I think it would be cool if we could just get a graphic like the claws from<br/>
&gt;the AoF for the werewolf gloves. But a weapon the would proc clinging<br/>
&gt;darkness would be awesome.<br/>
