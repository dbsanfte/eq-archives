<div id="ygrps-yiv-1547190491">Someone told me that they had seen mesh boots, but I never have.  In<br/>
fact, it&#39;s the only mesh piece that I am missing.  Has anyone else seen<br/>
or heard of mesh boots?<br/>

&gt; 	Well, I&#39;ve been on a big armor-upgrade kick lately, when it<br/>
&gt; occurred to me that I am still walking around in the same ol&#39; footwear<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve had since... well, forever.  It&#39;s like walking around in the beat<br/>
&gt; up<br/>
&gt; blue Keds you had back in 2nd grade.  Seeing as there is no &#39;mesh<br/>
&gt; boots&#39; or<br/>
&gt; anything of that ilk, I was wondering what was out there that was<br/>
&gt; monk-friendly (i.e. low weight).  AC is obviouly desireable, although<br/>
&gt; anything that could offer other bonuses (stat increase, resistances,<br/>
&gt; etc.)<br/>
&gt; would be wonderful.<br/>
&gt; 	Suggestions, advices, personal experiences appreciated...<br/>
