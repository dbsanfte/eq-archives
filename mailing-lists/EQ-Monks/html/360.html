&gt;         Actually, there is a claw fisted sort of weapon, looks like a<br/>
plate<br/>
&gt; glove with 3 or 4 blades coming out of it.  But its a 1 hand slashing<br/>
&gt; weapon.  Really expensive, I think....  But still, something like that<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; had charges of poison or some other spell that could be refilled with a<br/>
&gt; special item would be really interesting.. (For instance, serum of<br/>
slowness,<br/>
&gt; that would DOT and slow the creature down, and would require some item<br/>
&gt; gained off a creature to replenish.)  Monks are indefinitely cool, but we<br/>
&gt; could all use a refreshing new addition.  Maybe a cool graphic for our<br/>
&gt; sashes/headbands would be good too.....  And a manuever that tosses your<br/>
&gt; enemy back would be good for feigning.   Nail em away then walk off a few<br/>
&gt; steps and feign.  You could get it at 15 or something and the distance you<br/>
&gt; throw the enemy could be skill based...  And quite considerable at high<br/>
&gt; levels. =)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      Also....  Is there anyone out there who plays Xegony who is<br/>
absolutely<br/>
&gt; swamped with spare platinum and has nothing to do with it?  I need armor<br/>
so<br/>
&gt; badly...   things that con white to me may as well con red..<br/>
