<div id="ygrps-yiv-574263212">They modified fd a while back.  When successful, mobs under level 35 will<br/>
forget about you.  Above that they have a percentage chance to remember you.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m only level 22 and have never had a mob remember me yet.  If they are not<br/>
agro to me, I just fd, get up, then start bandaging right away.  Sometimes<br/>
when I&#39;m lucky I can bandage up enough to kill the mob before it wonders<br/>
away.<br/>

		Acutally you need not keep screaming every time, once you<br/>
fall down the <br/>
		first time, rather than standing back up and doing it again,<br/>
just hit the FD <br/>
		button again, once it recycles without standing up.  If you<br/>
recieve &quot;SoANDSo <br/>
		has fallen to the ground&quot; you have failed.  If you get no<br/>
message, chances <br/>
		are you succeded (this is not always true).  Go up to a<br/>
creature that <br/>
		normally doesnt aggro on you, something really green, smack<br/>
it, then when <br/>
		you know it is attacking you, FD.  If it &#39;forgets&#39; you, its<br/>
working.  My <br/>
		skill is over 100, and it works most all the time, I rarely<br/>
get the message <br/>
		anymore, but I get many times where I am being mobbed, and I<br/>
will FD and <br/>
		only SOME of the mobs forget me, and this is only for a<br/>
second.  I am <br/>
		currently in unrest and I can usually FD to most mobs that<br/>
are up to a low <br/>
		red to me.  Hags on the other hand I have only fooled a<br/>
couple of times.  <br/>
		Most of the times even when I time it inbetween their<br/>
spells, they still <br/>
		seem to not be fooled by my feign.</div>
