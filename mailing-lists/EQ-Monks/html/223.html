<div id="ygrps-yiv-360124128">On the same thread of persistence...<br/>
I headed over to Crushbone the other night to try and<br/>
find some Bracers of Battle. A friend said he would<br/>
help me out but by the time I got there he had to go<br/>
.So I hung out for a while, not knowing where the<br/>
warlord showed up. I missed him quite a few times and<br/>
was getting frustrated so I logged off. Last night I<br/>
decided  iwould try for a ltitle while longer before<br/>
seeking ym fortune elsewhere. I found a party with<br/>
another monk (more on him later) and a kindly Druid.<br/>
Since I initiated the party it was agreed that I would<br/>
get the first BoB. (in the meantime my friend came<br/>
through and got me one BoB so now I only needed one).<br/>
The other monk need one BoB as well so he would get<br/>
the next. Our Druid friend was looking for Crush&#39;s<br/>
armor so she was to get that. Now, my philosophy in<br/>
partying is that the group works together in order to<br/>
get all the items the various party members want<br/>
(within reason) so it was my thinking that I would<br/>
stay grouped with them until we got 2 BoBs (one for<br/>
each monk) and Crush&#39;s armor. Well, second Warlord we<br/>
got had a BoB so I was all set. Feeling loyalty to my<br/>
party memebrs for helping me, I vowed to stay on and<br/>
help them both achieve their goals. We got another<br/>
warlord (who did nto have the BoB) and got Crush when<br/>
we could. I noticed the monk was rushing to loot Crush<br/>
every time so I asked that he reserve the looting for<br/>
the Druid, since she needed his loot. About the third<br/>
time Crush went down, the monk sprinted for his corpse<br/>
and looted it. Happy for our victory, both the druid<br/>
and I asked if Crush had the armor. The monk was<br/>
silent for a while but eventually (after we asked a<br/>
few more times) admitted that he did. &quot;great!&quot; said I<br/>
and proceeded to ask if he would please hand it to the<br/>
druid. He said &quot;When I get my BoB she can have Crush&#39;s<br/>
armor.&quot; (For future reference to all who are reading,<br/>
that is not a good way to inspire loyalty) The druid<br/>
and I exchanged a few /tells and shesaid that she<br/>
didn&#39;t need it terribly so she didn&#39;t care much. I<br/>
told her  Iwould do I all I could to make sure he got<br/>
his BoB so she could have the armor and then she and I<br/>
would leave him behind. The monk then had the audacity<br/>
to say that he had to go to town and sell things,<br/>
leaving the two of us to get &quot;his&quot; BoB. having a<br/>
harder time of it with just 2, we missed a warlord<br/>
spawn and she got killed by Crush. The monk decided to<br/>
take his sweet time egtting back too so by the time he<br/>
returned, we were fed up and wanted to leave. He,<br/>
innocently might I add, asks where we are going and we<br/>
informed him that:<br/>
A) Greed is a poor quality in a monk<br/>
B) He was one of the worst group members we had ever<br/>
been with<br/>
<br/>
We left him there and went on our way. Now, the moral<br/>
of the story is this. Having lied to us once already<br/>
by stealing the armor, we did not trust him to ever<br/>
give it back. Therefore, why would we help him? There<br/>
would be many more chances to get Crush and his armor<br/>
(which I plan to do for my new friend, btw) and we did<br/>
not need his poor company.<br/>
<br/>
Forgive my ramblings but in EQ ,as in life, you will<br/>
get farther with honesty and loyalty than with<br/>
mistrust and greed. If he had handed the armor over I<br/>
would have been sure to help him since we would then<br/>
have only needed the one BoB. His greed cost him our<br/>
help.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening and may truth guide you<br/>
