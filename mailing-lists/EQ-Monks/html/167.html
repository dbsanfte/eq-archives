<div id="ygrps-yiv-1173866758">My level 1 ogre warrior was waiting for the Fear Plane to open up (They made<br/>
the spawn insane now, stuff at zone, nasty...) and this group left me a few<br/>
spectre corpses, and I got the box!!  It has 10 slots and reduces weight to<br/>
/0/!  Check it out on EQ&#39;lizer if you want, but anyways, I&#39;m on Fennin Ro,<br/>
and would be willing to trade for some nice druid armor for my druid, or<br/>
maybe warrior stuff (Not Ogre though, I would make it wood elf...)...I don&#39;t<br/>
know, just make offers, hehe, I would like something good, because I /do/<br/>
know what this is worth to monks as I used to have one (I don&#39;t play it<br/>
currently but I still like the list), anyways, just thought I&#39;d give you<br/>
guys first real crack at it (Except for the people that assumed I had one<br/>
when I asked what it was worth)...Anyways, I&#39;m in Feerott with it, but I&#39;m<br/>
sure I could get it to my nice wood elf druid to make it safer for you<br/>
guys...I&#39;m not sure if big things can fit in it, but I had a scythe I put in<br/>
there and it fit...</div>
