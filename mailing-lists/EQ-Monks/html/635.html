<b>Subject:</b> Another take on twinking <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-516792672">I tend to run many different characters; monk, warrior, shaman, bard,<br/>
cleric, paladin, magician, and wizard.  And yes, I twink between them, but<br/>
not outrageously so, and not so it unbalances anything.  For example, my<br/>
monk (lvl 10) was generating cash at a healthy clip.  So he gave all his<br/>
money to my warrior blacksmith (lvl 19).  The blacksmith use the pp to make<br/>
a partial suite of large banded armor for my ogre shaman (lvl 8), who in<br/>
turn is looking for mesh armor in Upper Guk for my monk.  I try to make it<br/>
more of a micro economy.  If these three characters were owned by different<br/>
people, it wouldn&#39;t be a twink at all.<br/>
<br/>
I have no doubt that there is outrageous twinking going on (saw a lvl 8 ogre<br/>
warrior with full bronze plate), but I think you can twink within reason and<br/>
not upset the game balance.<br/>
