<b>Subject:</b> Pls explain AC <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1143949843">I am not sure where anyone got the 15 weight is the best for monks...can<br/>
someone please explain this...My AC does not change when i drop down to or<br/>
below 15, if anything it gets worse as I take my patchwork armor off. I<br/>
can&#39;t believe this nonsense about the super low weight unless you are<br/>
talking about encumbering weight. I know monks are suppose to use less than<br/>
others but I can&#39;t go on a huge hunting spree and not carry something back<br/>
to sell. Or should I be investing in items instead? Its a little hard to<br/>
invest in items on the PVP server since everyone is out to get you hehe.<br/>
Suggestions for eq would be most appriciated...where to buy cost? Thanks<br/>
