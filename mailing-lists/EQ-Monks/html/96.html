<div id="ygrps-yiv-2061519565">LOL, you are a relatively young monk, my friend ;)  When you get to the higher lvls, we smoke the warriors, hands down.  They cannot equal the dmg that we monks can do.  Please don&#39;t underestimate Feign Death either.  I know of a 48th lvl monk who has only died twice between 32 and 48th lvl.  All because of feign death.  No, there is definitely no need to make any changes to the monk.<br/>
<br/>
The warriors, on the other hand, have every right to be upset.  They are not the master of melee like they should be.  At the very least, they should be able to equal the monks in power and they should definitely be able to out-melee a ranger or paladin.  Right now, this is not the case and that&#39;s why the warriors are up in arms, so to speak.  <br/>

  Subject: [EQ-Monks] Warrior Petition?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
      What I want to know is what is with this warrior petition.  Granted maybe the warrior class is not really any better than the paladin class in melee (and it is, IMHO), but why should warriors get another big boost over the already humbled monk?  Despite the fact that we get feign death eventually, our armor class and atttack does not usually equal that of a warrior, which is alright now, but if they get another boost, where is this going to leave the monk.  I for one am against the warrior update, unless the make a minimal change to the monk class.  I&#39;m not asking for much, I&#39;m just asking for something that by making the warrior &quot;king of melee&quot; that they just not leave the monks in the dust.<br/>
