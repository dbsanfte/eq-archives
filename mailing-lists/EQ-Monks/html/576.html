<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1287646211">my 25 bard soloed there pretty easily.  they all conned blue to me<br/>
at that point.  pain in the butt for melee classes tho since you need<br/>
to get bound in freeport and take boat back to your body if you die.<br/>
i don&#39;t think i ever died to a gargoyle tho.  killed about 10 in an hour,<br/>
got 2 eyes, got bored, went back to unrest the last time i was there.<br/>
there were maybe 2 other groups on the island at the time, but i hear<br/>
that it is pretty packed usually.</div>
