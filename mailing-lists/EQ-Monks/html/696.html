<div id="ygrps-yiv-2020090443">OK here goes:<br/>
<br/>
1) Start at the Zone from LAke rathe.  YOu will see some cyclops and<br/>
Giant skells mulling around in an area infront of you.<br/>
<br/>
2) Turn LEFT, HUGGING the zone wall unless you want to get your level 8-20<br/>
butt WHoooped!<br/>
<br/>
3)You will pass a tent, and right after the tent you will see a<br/>
mountain ridge.  It does quite reach all the way to teh Zone wall<br/>
along which you are sneaking creating something of a &quot;pass&quot; between the<br/>
two &#39;walls&#39;.  YOu want to go through that pass and then cross it to hugg<br/>
the mountain ridge on your right  side. (Translation Turn Right after<br/>
crossing the pass and Hugg the wall again - This time it wont be the zone<br/>
wall but the wall of the ridge that youw ill be clinging to)<br/>
<br/>
4) You will know you are on the right path if you come across an inn. Buy<br/>
sells stuff and stock up on food.<br/>
<br/>
5) Continue on straight past the inn.  YOu should be coming up on a second<br/>
mountain pass.  GO through this one and bear slightly left.  you will find<br/>
yourself in a narrow valley or gully (sp?)<br/>
<br/>
6) You should see a Pillar with some bettles/scarabs around them.  THis<br/>
will let you konw youare  on the right path.  Continue on running,<br/>
following the narrow &quot;gully&quot; that you are in.<br/>
<br/>
7) Eventually you will see a change in the grennery of to your right - the<br/>
grass willl go from green to a mossy grean-brown color.  This is the<br/>
mrking for the path to Ferrot.  <br/>
<br/>
8) NOTE: when you zone across to ferrot there is alot of danger - tehre is<br/>
a undead camp along the zone wall to teh right - You WILL NEED invis vs<br/>
undead (and SOW) to get past that alive),  Following the path infront of<br/>
you leads to a bridge with paths leading to both OGGoK or the zone to<br/>
innothule.  BE WARY OF BOUNCERS!  THey are very mean to us goodly races<br/>
and 2 of them roam the entire ZONE - *sigh I have died many times to that<br/>
damned BOUNCER FLERB! *I spit on his grave!*<br/>
<br/>
Anyway consider yourself warned.<br/>
Good Journeys to you.<br/>
