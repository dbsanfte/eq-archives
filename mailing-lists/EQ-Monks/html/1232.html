<div id="ygrps-yiv-927054776">what are the stats on the werewolf skin cloak?<br/>
<br/>
2)gator scale leggings are better - more ac.  Dex (as we discussed earlier) does<br/>
nothing for us monks so put those drakes in the bank (if there is ever a procing<br/>
glove introduced then break em back out again!)<br/>
and camp the ancient croc for some gator leggs - which are the rare drop.  But<br/>
you can earn afew thousand pp while you wait for em (and MONDO xp besides)<br/>
killing the crocs and selling the one or two gator sleeves you will likely earn<br/>
while you wait for your legs to drop.  At level 28 you could probably solo the<br/>
spawn but i would bring a caster friend (int based caster so he wont compete for<br/>
the legs) along just to be safe.<br/>
<br/>
3)get lupine gauntlets  (4 ac, 3dex 3 agi) or if you can treant fists ( 8ac 3dex<br/>
- hell of long quest for these: one of the spawns is a once a week spawn!)  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All in all great Equipment for your level.  Long term things to shoot for would<br/>
be cloak of shadows and haste sash.  Personally I use the crown of froglock<br/>
kings over the exe hood (which I keep in the bank) 12 is too good to pass up for<br/>
4 str and 9 meaningless dex.  The  crown is also a greater light source so it<br/>
can replace the wu&#39;s in that respect.<br/>
<br/>
My equipment is:<br/>
ears: diamodine earings<br/>
face: Lizardskin Tribal mask<br/>
neck: golden Black pearl choker (I will be switching to the gold opal soon)<br/>
head: Crown of froglock kingsb (12 ac, 20 fire, 20 cold resist)<br/>
fingers: jaggeds<br/>
wrist:  serp bracer/errolisi bracer (one of each)<br/>
arms: aszure<br/>
shoulders: cured silk<br/>
chest: cured silk<br/>
back: white wolf hide cloak (7ac, 3 str 3 dex I think... is the werewolf cloak<br/>
better? never seen it)<br/>
hands: treant fists (left my lupines in the bank)<br/>
legs: gatorscale<br/>
waist: haste sash<br/>
feet: wolf fur<br/>
<br/>
