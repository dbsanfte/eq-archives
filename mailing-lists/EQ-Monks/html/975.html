<div id="ygrps-yiv-74816874">A monk is very fun in his teens.  Once you get past the 20s you<br/>
will find ver very few places you can solo, however.  By that time,<br/>
a mob that cons low blue will take out the best equipped monk<br/>
without much of a sweat.  You will also start seeing warriors or<br/>
other melee types wielding weapons that easily make them better<br/>
damagers than you. Rangers with dual ykeshas in their low 30s<br/>
are not uncommon and those weapons essentially do the same<br/>
damage as a 44th level monk.  Also at 30th level warriros get a<br/>
huge HP bonus.  You will see their ability to tank go up dramatically<br/>
where as we can barely take hits from higher level mobs.  But what<br/>
set us apart was feign death.  With that skill I feared no zone.  I<br/>
could go anywhere as I had a nice safety net.  Now that safety net<br/>
is gone.  I have to cower at the zone lines with those same warriors<br/>
until some group is nice enough to pick me up.  Unfortunately, they<br/>
would rather not anymore.  Alas there isn&#39;t much left for me to do so<br/>
I have been looking into a nice retirement community next door to<br/>
the druid retirement grove.  I may try to kill a few dragons from time<br/>
to time, but I am not wanted there anymore either.  Too much mana<br/>
to keep me alive.  Troll Warriors are much more mana efficient.<br/>
<br/>
Oh well.  Now I may finally find peace and tranquility.<br/>

Over the last few weeks, I have seen the &quot;older&quot; and &quot;wiser&quot; monks on these<br/>
list moan about the changes in Feign Death.  Everyone has strong feelings<br/>
about the game and the changes that have been made.  People have stated<br/>
that the changes have made monks unplayable.  I really don&#39;t know, since I<br/>
have only been playing for a few weeks and have not made it to the level<br/>
necessary for feign death.  Last night, however, I reaffirmed my belief<br/>
that the Monk class is truly the best class in this game, regardless of<br/>
design changes.  I will elaborate.<br/>
<br/>
I had just leveled to 15th and had trained all available slots into Double<br/>
Attack.  I figured I would make a trip out to Black Burrow to hone my<br/>
skills before moving on to bigger game.  I know that at my level, that most<br/>
of the gnolls wouldn&#39;t give me any XP. I could pick up the teeth and gain<br/>
some small XP there.  I was playing solo.  There were several PCs around,<br/>
with a group of 13-15th level deciding to take on the gnoll commanders.<br/>
They were full up and I didn&#39;t go.  I stayed around the rest area, picking<br/>
off patrolling gnolls, and guards an the occasional brewer.  I had gone<br/>
back to the rest area for a breather.  Then, it happened:  Someone ticked<br/>
off the gnolls up in the commander area and trained them down onto us.  It<br/>
looked like an angry swarm coming out of a bee hive.  I was playing in full<br/>
window mode and the entire screen was filled with overlapping gnoll images.<br/>
 There was everything from Scrawny gnolls, up to the Commanders.  I could<br/>
not tell who my target was or how many there were.  Everyone in that room<br/>
was in for the fight of their digital lives.  At one point I know I was<br/>
fighting 2 guards, an elite guard and a commander.  That I could tell from<br/>
the descriptive text.  Spells were flying, weapons were slashing, and my<br/>
fist and feet were flying as fast as I could throw them.  Several<br/>
relatively low level casters fell first.  Then, the panic set in.  People<br/>
started running, but the train didn&#39;t follow them away.  It stayed there.<br/>
The PC panic was led by a pair of Troll warriors, who conned red to me.  I<br/>
saw them and others run.  I just kept fighting.  I managed to get a mend<br/>
off and a cleric or Druid healed me at one point in the fight.  When it was<br/>
all over, the only 2 PCs left in the room full of gnoll bodies, were myself<br/>
and another monk who was 16th level.  I still had 2 1/2 bubbles of health.<br/>
I picked up 8 gnoll teeth out of that fight and dumped more coin than I<br/>
wanted to carry.  With the exception of the heal, I had no magical buffs,<br/>
not even a SOW to help in case of retreat.  I wear cured silk armor, but<br/>
more than 2/3 of my AC is innate.  I don&#39;t have any fancy equipment,<br/>
although I do have the money to purchase some.  The next time some warrior<br/>
starts talking about how great they are, their armor is, their weapons,<br/>
etc.., just relate this little story.<br/>
