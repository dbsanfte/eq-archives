<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1718083941">Hail Fellow Monks,<br/>
   This is my first time as a monk and I have several questions.  Any help would be great appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
1. I know that will less weight we have a higher AC.  But where is the balance of weigh and armor.  Am I better off with all Leather because of its higher AC or and I better off with all cloth because of its lower weight?<br/>
<br/>
2.  When I am ready to upgrade armor from either cloth or leather armor, depending  on the answers I get for number 1, what should I get?  I know there is netted, mesh, and woven but what is best to get first?  What are the advantages of each?  <br/>
<br/>
3. When I am ready where is the best place to get magic gloves?  <br/>
<br/>
4. When I hit level 17 and get feign death how many points should I put into it?  Should I just put one and then start it and sit there till it maxes or won&#39;t that work?  <br/>
<br/>
5. What am I forgetting about?  What is important for me to remember or keep held back for later?  Should I save all my practice points for one thing?  Etc...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
Mark<br/>
