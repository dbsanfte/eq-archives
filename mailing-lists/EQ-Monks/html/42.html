Spiked Collar, etc. and my stats are at a place where I&#39;m comfortable.  I<br/>
had already heard of Mesh armor, and for that reason I was in Upper Guk<br/>
last night for about 6 hours with a party of 5 ranging in levels between 19<br/>
and 24.  Killed tons of the appropriate Gaz Warriors (as well as<br/>
innumerable shamans, idealists, etc.), and found that the entire group got<br/>
a total of 2 woven items and no mesh at all.  I had heard that the drop<br/>
rate for these items had been adjusted, which would seem to be supported by<br/>
this experience.<br/>
	As this is an area of a dungeon which generates trains of level<br/>
16-25 NPCs with distressing regularity, I&#39;m not comfortable going in there<br/>
with a group much less powerful than the aforementioned one.<br/>
Unfortunately, putting such a group together is very difficult - limiting<br/>
the opportunities to search for the precious armor. :(<br/>
