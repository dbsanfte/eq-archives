<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-735641193">Is everyone dead?  I finally got the essence of Dol and baton.  I had to save<br/>
up 3kp to get it.  (Luckily, my wife quit eq, so I got to sell all of her stuff,<br/>
and managed to get 4.2kp out of it)<br/>
<br/>
So, I&#39;m hanging out in Dalnir, praying that I manage to get some crescent armor.<br/>
<br/>
But, I&#39;ve started jonesing for quests again.  What level do I have to be to<br/>
start trying to get the Robe of the Lost circle?  I&#39;d prefer to go with a small<br/>
group of a bit higher than me (say a group of 3 35s-40s), or a full group of <br/>
low 30s.<br/>
<br/>
Any chance in hell I can camp the spawns at that level?</div>
