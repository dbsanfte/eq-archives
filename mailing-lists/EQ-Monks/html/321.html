<div id="ygrps-yiv-1684079198">This is correct.  I just turned in my Red Headband items last night, with some trepidation.  I was terrified that the trainer would not hand over the headband, but it did work.<br/>
<br/>
He asks you to find Brother Dareb and Brother Shen.  If they are not alive, bring back their remains (Dareb&#39;s Skull, Head of Shen) along with those of Ghanex Drah (Head).  Turn those in along with your Orange Headband.  I handed them to the Trainer in that order and was rewarded with the red headband.  The faction adjustments included that of the Silent Fist Clan as well as the Ashen Order, with a couple of others.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I was one of the lucky ones who managed to get both the headband and sash quests going before they &#39;Lored&#39; the guild notes.<br/>

&gt;I believe he asks you to bring back Dareb. If you ask<br/>
&gt;him about Dareb (or whoever he told youto bring back)<br/>
&gt;he will explain that one went looking for another monk<br/>
&gt;and that if they perished to bring back their remains<br/>
&gt;so that they can be honored with burial. You shouldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;need to speak with anyone else. Good journeys and my<br/>
&gt;truth guide you.<br/>

&gt;&gt; I&#39;m a fp monk who recently went to qeynos and back<br/>
&gt;&gt; (to get my white-orange<br/>
&gt;&gt; sash, and to travel the world some).  I thought when<br/>
&gt;&gt; I smacked the gnolls<br/>
&gt;&gt; in bb, that it gave faction to the fp monk guild. I<br/>
&gt;&gt; know they gave me<br/>
&gt;&gt; faction to the silent fist clan.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; one question.  for the red headband, I know you need<br/>
&gt;&gt; 3 heads from paw.<br/>
&gt;&gt; but when I asked about the red headband, all the guy<br/>
&gt;&gt; said was to find<br/>
&gt;&gt; brother someone, and bring them back to the guild<br/>
&gt;&gt; (not tomer, did that).<br/>
&gt;&gt; am I supposed to talk to someone and find out that<br/>
&gt;&gt; that guy is dead, then<br/>
&gt;&gt; get a new quest?<br/>
