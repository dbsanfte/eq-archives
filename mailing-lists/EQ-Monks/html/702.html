<div id="ygrps-yiv-213540555">500p is a lot for a lvel 19, but i suppose it is possible:<br/>
To answer your questions:<br/>
1) if you were not talking about the DOT patch then the last email was not<br/>
directed at you at all.<br/>
<br/>
2) Damn, sorry that you lost your stuff zoning - I know  i would be<br/>
mighty pissed if that happened to me.<br/>
<br/>
3)I agree with you level caps are dumb. I do not believe variant is<br/>
considering these. Incidentally someone on this list recently commented<br/>
that the reason for the POF level cap wa that Variant was fed up with<br/>
twinking - well this is just simply not so. The PoF or rather - corpse<br/>
recovery from the PoF was taking up FAR too much of the GM and Guide time.<br/>
As a result, to cut down on the number of &quot;Can you help me get my corpse<br/>
out of mr. Caszic thules toe nail&quot; requests, they cut donw on the number<br/>
of peopl going to teh POF who didn&#39;t belong there.<br/>
<br/>
4)Buying stuff with justly earned money is NOT twinking. Anything that you<br/>
can buy with money is not terribly good or rare (from a levle 35 point of<br/>
view of course). So you have two platinum Black pearls rings? So what you<br/>
are walking around in full mesh - maybe afew lupine armor.  These are all<br/>
things that you can buy/ earn fairly easily at your level.<br/>
<br/>
Haveing a Flowing balck sash, mask of the Deciver and Dwarven work boots<br/>
IS twinking however!  These are very hard to get and are usually trade<br/>
only items. You CAN NEVER<br/>
earn enough money in teh game to buy a Flowing balck sash. NO one who is<br/>
able to get one would be willing to sell one for cash - UNLESS THEY WERER<br/>
TRYING TO &quot;TWINK&quot; you. Very high levle items are TRADE only. The reason<br/>
for this is obvious: Cash is really and trully worthless. What give<br/>
platinum its value is the stuff you can buy with it in town/other<br/>
players.  For high levle items that are rare like Ghoulbane for example,<br/>
or box of abu kar or the flowing black sash, no amount of csh can<br/>
adequately compensate you for the tiem you spent CAMPING for these items.<br/>
<br/>
So no you are not a twink and have ing alot of cash doesn t make you a<br/>
twink.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Variant didnt Nerf anyone!<br/>
&gt; &gt; i assume that you are referring to the recently announced patch in which<br/>
&gt; &gt; DOT were MODIFIED.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; dont assume.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m a monk, I dont kite, I dont twink (not yet at least).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; and no, I have not been nerfed.  just my inventory.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; and when you loose all your stuff ZONING, and they say &quot;too bad, known<br/>
&gt; bug, shouldnt have zoned&quot;, you start to have a little different thinking<br/>
&gt; to twinking.<br/>
&gt; -------<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; on a side note, If verant wants to keep its player based economy, then<br/>
&gt; twinking will never be banned, and lvl limits will never be put in place.<br/>
&gt; The only way a player based economy works is if the currency is actually<br/>
&gt; worth something.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It is. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; add level caps, or ban twinking, and you seriously devalue the currency,<br/>
&gt; turning the economy into a barter system.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -------<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; on a third note.  What connotates twinking?  is it buying stuff?  I bought<br/>
&gt; my mesh, am I a twink?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m lvl 19, and I made 500pp yesterday.  If I buy something nice with it,<br/>
&gt; am I a twink?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
