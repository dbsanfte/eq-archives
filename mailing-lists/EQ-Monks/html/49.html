 </span></blockquote>Hail again fellow Monks...      *Warning- Possible spoiler*<br/>
           When I hit level 20 i got a couple friends together and headed to<br/>
Guk. After we arrived we decided to send a few tells, to see if we could get<br/>
some imput into what we wanted to look for. For fellow monks not familiar with<br/>
what type of froglock to kill, try the Gaz warriors. I stayed for 2 nights and<br/>
came away with a full set of mesh and a few left overs to bank or give away.<br/>
Now noted, you cant go alone as the Gaz warriors are from level 18th to 22nd as<br/>
I seem to have found.<br/>
 Just wanting to help my fellow brothers get the armor they need...If you<br/>
consider this a spoiler I noted at the top of this page it might be. Ill send<br/>
in more info as i can get it. Take care friends and Ill see you on Povar. Im<br/>
Jamez Shaolin 24th lvl Monk .</div>
