<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1119848343">I&#39;ve gotten my skill up to 120 at the entrance to East Commons from Northern<br/>
Ro just as my other brothers have described. Climb up as far as you can,<br/>
face outward, and hit autorun. Depending on where you are on the cliff side,<br/>
you should get 4 &quot;falls&quot; that don&#39;t incur any damage but do kick in Safe<br/>
Fall. You&#39;ll get increases in a hurry using this method. Prior to this, I<br/>
was using the Temple of Marr in North Freeport... What a tedious chore that<br/>
was!<br/>
<br/>
And yes, keep those bandages on hand -- they will save your life. The only<br/>
problem with Mage-summoned bandages is that they poof when you log out and<br/>
sometimes it&#39;s a pain trying to get back to a town with a bank. My bind<br/>
wound skill is up to 111 and I can heal almost 30 hitpoints with one<br/>
bandage. I always recommend keeping all your &quot;non-combat&quot; skills maxxed out.<br/>
Swimming, sense heading, safe fall (sneak to 113 &lt;g&gt;), Feign Death. I make a<br/>
point of trying to max these out as soon as I attain a higher rank.<br/>
<br/>
Where to go at 22? Lake Rathetear might be a good spot for you to solo.<br/>
There&#39;s an island with a huge ramp. On the ramp are three Aviak Guards. Go<br/>
up the ramp, target a bird, engage and run down the ramp.  All three birds<br/>
will come after you. Back up to the mountainside and let them get as close<br/>
to you as you dare and feign death. They immediately go non-agro on you so<br/>
you can stand back up right away. They stand there looking confused for a<br/>
minute and then they start the trip back up the ramp to their spawn points.<br/>
If all goes well, the separate enough so you can pick one off easily and<br/>
engage him. Great experience at that level and sometimes you get bronze<br/>
weapons and gold pieces. If you can get a small group together or a partner<br/>
(one who can heal, hopefully &lt;g&gt;), try out &quot;Gargoyle&quot; Island in the Ocean of<br/>
Tears. Good experience and if you&#39;re lucky enough to get Gargoyle Eyes --<br/>
great loot too.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt;I meant to say a spot that you&#39;d normally take damage from, if you<br/>
 </span></blockquote>didn&#39;t<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; &gt;have safe fall. :)<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Depending on where you are Young Brother, the steep mountain walls<br/>
 </span></blockquote>outside<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;of Freeport are good Safe Fall training spots (any steep wall could suffice<br/>
&gt;though).  I saw this tip posted on a monk board.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Outside of FP, either in East Commons or North Ro, the mountains to the<br/>
&gt;side of the inner zones are great places to train that skill up.  You do<br/>
 </span></blockquote>not<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;need to take damage, just as long as you make that skipping sound as you<br/>
&gt;descend.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Find an almost sheer wall, back up all the way to the top then run down.<br/>
&gt;Every time you trip, you will up your chances for a skill increase.  Back<br/>
 </span></blockquote>up<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;to the top, then repeat.  I did this a few nights ago at the FP/NRo wall<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;managed to get 45 skill increases in about 30 minutes...(now 112)<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Use caution and make sure you do not jump off the top of the cliff (some<br/>
&gt;have flat spots at the top that you can launch from), I only did this to<br/>
&gt;train my Bind Wound, taking 275 DMG 2 times to lower my HPs (608 total).<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;you have less HPs, you could be doomed.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; You may even get some odd stares from passers-by like I did; &#39;What&#39;s that<br/>
&gt;Monk doing?&#39;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; :)<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Safe training to you Brothers and Sisters.<br/>
