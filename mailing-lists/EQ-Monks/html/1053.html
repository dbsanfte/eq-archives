<div id="ygrps-yiv-735836474">Please remember prices vary from server to server what costs next to nothing<br/>
on one server maybe very expensive on another. Serp bracers stillseel for<br/>
about 800pp on my server while a Stein of Moggik has dropped in value to<br/>
about 300pp. on a brandnew server you can pay up to 100pp for a RTS now they<br/>
are garbage. it is all realtive to your server and how much the buyer is<br/>
willing to pay.<br/>

&gt; Here is some info for you,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1.  A Serpentine Bracer for 800pp is one of the worst<br/>
&gt; deals you can get.  Even 2 for that much would be bad.<br/>
&gt;  The price has dropped recently so about 200-250 is a<br/>
&gt; decent range.  Many high levels give them away for<br/>
&gt; free.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2.  Monk equipment shouldn&#39;t matter that much.  I will<br/>
&gt; admit that I have recieved some nice items from guild<br/>
&gt; members but what I would recomend you do is buy cured<br/>
&gt; silk armor.  Pretty decent price.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 3.  You don&#39;t need to loot everything but don&#39;t think<br/>
&gt; its the end of the world if you go over your limit.<br/>
&gt; Try to hunt near a place you can sell.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 4.  250pp is quite a bit, you must not buy much.  I<br/>
&gt; only have about 140pp TOTAL at level 20.  Of course I<br/>
&gt; support another character and have recently bought<br/>
&gt; some jewelry but still, don&#39;t consider yourself low on<br/>
&gt; cash.<br/>
