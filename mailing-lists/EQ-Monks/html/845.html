<div id="ygrps-yiv-195899751">5 or 6 monks is fun, but you&#39;d see big problems with high lvl healer types <br/>
and anything with SOW.  Mobs just do not get interrupted just by hitting them <br/>
anymore.  You need somebody with a stun attack or spell, so you can keep <br/>
beating on the kobold priest for instance, and the bam, it complete heals, so <br/>
try again and bam it does it again.  And SOW, without root to nerf it, or <br/>
snare to keep it there, the mob will most likely get away, and in dungeons, <br/>
that mean one thing, train comin back at ya.<br/>
So let me restate my &quot;ideal&quot; lvl 45+ group: 3 monks, druid, cleric and <br/>
enchanter.  You get the best of all worlds there really and no mob resisting <br/>
the monks&#39; fists.  Where&#39;s your nuker you ask?  Have you ever seen a monk in <br/>
action with fbss and celerity or swift like wind?  The is no downtime with <br/>
this group at all.  You have your group gater and snarer.  But then again it <br/>
always depends on the ppl actually playing these chars, cause if they aren&#39;t <br/>
fun, you&#39;re not gonna have fun.  So in the end, group with ppl you like, it <br/>
makes the world of Norrath much more enjoyable.<br/>
