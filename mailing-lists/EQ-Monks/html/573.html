&gt;hmm may be tough for you to level if you don&#39;t kill any races that are<br/>
&gt;&#39;&#39;civilized&#39;&#39;.  by &#39;&#39;civilized&#39;&#39; i assume you mean they have a society, <br/>
&gt;since<br/>
&gt;bandits who KOS other people, could hardly be considered civilized<br/>
&gt;by the normal definition of the word.  No kobolds in solusek, no goblins<br/>
&gt;in runnyeye or permafrost, no lizardmen in cazic, no ogres in najena, no<br/>
&gt;orcs in crushbone...  what&#39;s left?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I believe our brother was referring to the civilised races of the light.   <br/>
Kobolds and ogres and trolls (oh my!) are fiendish races who deserve <br/>
whatever punishment my fists can deal to them.   Human and demihuman <br/>
bandits, however, are children of the light who have fallen from the path.   <br/>
They should not be hunted and killed like scrawny gnolls, but rather shown <br/>
that their ways are in error and urged to repent.    I think that the dark <br/>
races, such as orcs and dark elves, are beyond salvation.<br/>
