&gt; Fine, you&#39;ve moved beyond it.  Others haven&#39;t.  No reason to extend this<br/>
&gt; thread further by calling them whiners and telling the to suck it up and<br/>
&gt; live with it.  It&#39;s just plain inflamatory and extends the thread even<br/>
&gt; further.  It you really are tire of hearing it and want the thread to die<br/>
&gt; off, then stop responding and let it die off.  Unless you are the list<br/>
&gt; admin, there&#39;s no other way you can end the thread.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s a very passive attitude.  I believe that if you tell someone<br/>
to take a look at themselves, and their posts from another<br/>
perspective.  Think before they post, about half the idiot posts would<br/>
not be sent.<br/>
<br/>
If no one responds and complains about one bad email.  The offender will<br/>
just send another, and another, and another.  Eventually someone<br/>
(me) needs to tell that person that his e-mails aren&#39;t being productive<br/>
and he is only hurting his own name, that person will stop or the<br/>
emails will be a lot more well thought out.</div>
