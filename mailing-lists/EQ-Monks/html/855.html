<br/>
I&#39;ve easily soloed off and on up through 30th (and looks like I can<br/>
go at least through 32nd).  A friend is soloing giants at 44th (with<br/>
Jboots).  I guess somewhere between 30 and 44th we can&#39;t solo?<br/>

&gt; &gt;What is everyones opinion on the best race/class combo to solo? Can any<br/>
&gt; &gt;classes solo all the way to 50?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;          The only class that CAN&#39;T Solo all the way to 50 is a Wizard. <br/>
&gt; However, with that said, only Shamans, Druids (less so with Kiting <br/>
&gt; curtailed), Monks, Necromancers, and Shadow Knights can do it effectively. <br/>
&gt; Enchanters, Magicians, Bards, Paladins, and Rangers can do it to some <br/>
&gt; extent. Clerics and Warriors could possibly do it, but that would be <br/>
&gt; nightmarish. Wizards simply can&#39;t due to the lack of a Pet.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;          Shadow Knights are really the class that was designed with Soloing <br/>
&gt; in mind. Especially the infamous Troll Shadow Knight. Until Kiting was <br/>
&gt; restricted though, they were not the best at it. Druids USED to be the best <br/>
&gt; Solo class in the game. Now, it is a toss-up between Shamans, Druids, <br/>
&gt; Monks, Necros, and SKs.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;          Personally, I would hate to try and Solo my way to 50 as an <br/>
&gt; Enchanter. The Pets we get are weak and Charm is &quot;unstable&quot;. Don&#39;t get me <br/>
&gt; wrong, I love Charm but I like having a nice BIG Warrior right beside me to <br/>
&gt; Taunt the Mob off when Charm breaks.<br/>
