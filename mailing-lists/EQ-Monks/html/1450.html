<div id="ygrps-yiv-1466594401">I never put points into any attack.  With the frequency you will use them, <br/>
they will go up really quick.  Only things I have ever put points in were of <br/>

I dumped some points in mend, and just recently dumped some points into <br/>
instill doubt because it advances about as fast as molasis in winter.<br/>

&gt;Ok, this line of discussion brings up a tough question.  I&#39;ve been saving<br/>
&gt;points for dragon punch coming up.  I&#39;ll have 25 points when I get it.  Is<br/>
&gt;instill doubt good enough that I should put some of the saved up points <br/>
&gt;into<br/>
&gt;it, instead of the special attack?  Any advice here in either direction?<br/>

&gt;		Oh yea, I forgot the stop attacking thingy too.  Hehe.  As<br/>
&gt;far as instill<br/>
&gt;		doubt goes, its the hardest skill I have ever had to raise.<br/>
&gt;I hit the<br/>
&gt;		instill doubt button constantly, targeting anything I can,<br/>
&gt;and I think mine<br/>
&gt;		is like 35th.  And the key to getting it to work is make<br/>
&gt;sure the ONLY thing<br/>
&gt;		you are doing to your target is auto attack, no special<br/>
&gt;attacks, and your<br/>
&gt;		special attacks button has to be up (Tiger Claw, etc) and<br/>
&gt;then hit your<br/>
&gt;		instill doubt.  Now, chances are the next result you will<br/>
&gt;see is it telling<br/>
&gt;		you &quot;You aren&#39;t scaring anyone&quot;.  Hehe if you are REALLY<br/>
&gt;lucky and get it to<br/>
&gt;		work (I think I have gotten it to work like 3 or 4 times),<br/>
&gt;it should have<br/>
&gt;		the same effect as the 4th level necro spell, and make them<br/>
&gt;start to run<br/>
&gt;		away for 10-30 seconds.  Only you don&#39;t get the nifty flying<br/>
&gt;skulls.<br/>
