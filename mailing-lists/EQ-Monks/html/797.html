&gt; 3.) Reconsider Mistmoore.  Orc Highway - what are you talking about?  Maze -<br/>
&gt; Do you mean The Gorge of King Grobb?  If so, it&#39;s a bit slow, but still<br/>
&gt; okay.  You really shouldn&#39;t have to contend with lawn trash in Unrest at<br/>
&gt; that level.  Also, consider Runnyeye, East Karana, South Karana, Rathe<br/>
&gt; Mountains, Cazic Thule, Permafrost and Upper Guk.<br/>

I&#39;ve seen fighter types try these evil eyes.  Best to leave them<br/>
to the casters, their charm is just too nasty.<br/>
<br/>
Orc Highway -- West side of the Oasis, particularly just west of the<br/>
gypsy camp.  Stand to the side of the &quot;road&quot; and watch the orcs just<br/>
walk back and forth.  Somehow people get them mad and instead of<br/>
walking, they run back and forth...<br/>
<br/>
Mistmoore is awesome.  Leveled from 24 to 26 in about 8 hours here.<br/>
Upper Guk is always really nice.  Hardly anyone ever killing guks<br/>
for experience, I&#39;m not sure why, its great.<br/>
<br/>
Unrest, Cazic are also both good, SK is way too camped for my liking.</div>
