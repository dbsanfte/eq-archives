Thank god you mentioned gargoyles.  I&#39;m level 22nd monk from cazic thule and<br/>
was wondering where I should hunt.  I&#39;ve hunted gorge hounds for the last 3<br/>
levels and I do not want to hunt avaiks due to the over crowded population.<br/>
I&#39;m fully decked out with serpentines/exe hoods/black pearl so i&#39;m rather<br/>
strong for my level.  I guess what I&#39;m asking is that What level are<br/>
gargoyles and what island are they on? and do they respawn fast? any trains?<br/>
Can I solo?<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone recomend Cazic thule? I friend of mine said it took her 2 hours<br/>
to find a group(24thmage) and died/zoned many of times.<br/>
<br/>
Another question.  I have no boots. Leather is too heavy. They don&#39;t make<br/>
mesh.  Anyone know where i can get good boots with low wieght?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your time,<br/>
