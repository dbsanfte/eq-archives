<div id="ygrps-yiv-2089305323">i guess one way to test that theory is to take 3 lvl40 warriors and put them<br/>
up against a lvl50 monk.<br/>
then take 3 lvl40 monks and put them on a lvl50 warrior and see who would<br/>
survive or who would come the closest to surviving.<br/>
<br/>
i would like to dual a warrior now that i&#39;m 40 just to see if they have it<br/>
all that bad.<br/>
right now i only have 960hp and a warrior my lvl has about 1500.<br/>
we may do more damage but to win a dual we would need to do over 1.5x as<br/>
much damage.<br/>
and if we spend alot of our attacks blocking and dodging then we won&#39;t be<br/>
hitting quite as much.<br/>
<br/>
also we have weeknesses that hafta be compinsated for.<br/>
wizzies and necros really hurt us.<br/>
i think we may have less hp then most all other classes and we have low<br/>
magic resist so spells like harms touch can kill us in one hit.<br/>

I dont&#39; know about that.  If a warrior and monk go toe-to-toe at high <br/>
levels, who would win?  The monk does more damage than warriors to <br/>
monsters, but if a monster is attacking the monk, they go down much faster <br/>
than warriors.  Warriors are just hard to hit with all of their armor.  A <br/>
30th level warrior can have three things attacking him and barely go down <br/>
through a fight, but a monk would be dead if he had even two on him.<br/>

LOL, you are a relatively young monk, my friend ;)  When you get to the <br/>
higher lvls, we smoke the warriors, hands down.  They cannot equal the dmg <br/>
that we monks can do.  Please don&#39;t underestimate Feign Death either.  I <br/>
know of a 48th lvl monk who has only died twice between 32 and 48th lvl. <br/>
 All because of feign death.  No, there is definitely no need to make any <br/>
changes to the monk.<br/>
<br/>
The warriors, on the other hand, have every right to be upset.  They are <br/>
not the master of melee like they should be.  At the very least, they <br/>
should be able to equal the monks in power and they should definitely be <br/>
able to out-melee a ranger or paladin.  Right now, this is not the case and <br/>
that&#39;s why the warriors are up in arms, so to speak.<br/>

<br/>
      What I want to know is what is with this warrior petition.  Granted <br/>
maybe the warrior class is not really any better than the paladin class in <br/>
melee (and it is, IMHO), but why should warriors get another big boost over <br/>
the already humbled monk?  Despite the fact that we get feign death <br/>
eventually, our armor class and atttack does not usually equal that of a <br/>
warrior, which is alright now, but if they get another boost, where is this <br/>
going to leave the monk.  I for one am against the warrior update, unless <br/>
the make a minimal change to the monk class.  I&#39;m not asking for much, I&#39;m <br/>
just asking for something that by making the warrior &quot;king of melee&quot; that <br/>
they just not leave the monks in the dust.<br/>
