<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-38182117">The misty alchemist isn&#39;t as long of a spawn as the gorge one.  Go to gobby<br/>
camp 1, the Mooto camp.  The Mooto spawn point at the tent entrance is where<br/>
the alchemist will spawn.  Something spawns in that spot every 20  minutes.<br/>
So kill what ever spawns there as soon as it spawns.  I tracked the spawn<br/>
times there for 2 days as I waited for this alchemist.  (If you let the<br/>
placeholder live, then the next one comes 20 minutes after the place holder<br/>
dies.)  Another point, if you stand close to the tent the spawn pattern does<br/>
not include the alchy.  If you stand farther away from the tent the pattern<br/>
changes immediately and the alchy is a part of that pattern, eventually.<br/>
You will hear rumors that this is a 12 hour spawn.  That is not true.  I<br/>
know of one time period where he came 3 times in 12 hours.  <br/>
<br/>
The captain is in the room behind the king room.  Kill him fast or he will<br/>
get help from the gobbies in the king room.  I hear there are 3 elites in<br/>
the room with the captain.  (I am missing this piece.  It&#39;s camped every<br/>
time I&#39;m in a group that could take the room.)  <br/>
<br/>
The gel is in the pool near the king room.    A level 35 monk killed this<br/>
gel and it&#39;s friend (a high level gobby) for me.  She took Â½ damage.  Be<br/>
careful, the two of them are very tough.  I tried helping a lvl 24  monk (I<br/>
was lvl 21 at the time) kill both and we never could succeed.  We had to fd<br/>
each attempt.  <br/>
<br/>
The maps on everlore will help you find your way there in RE.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck brother,<br/>
