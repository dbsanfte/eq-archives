 </span></blockquote>1) Warriors have on average 30%-45%+ more hit points than monks <br/>
(depending on the race and stamina of the warrior, of course).  This <br/>
means that even if you include a successful mend, warriors still have <br/>
more HP than a monk.<br/>
<br/>
2) Warriors can therefore take far more hits than we can.  Our <br/>
dodging ability makes up for this somewhat, but make no mistake - <br/>
nobody in the game can absorb damage better than a warrior.<br/>
<br/>
2a) In conjunction with this, warriors can taunt (monks cannot), <br/>
which means they can draw the attention of those damage dealing mobs <br/>
to themselves (and away from those oh-so-delicate casters :) ).<br/>
<br/>
3) Given a warrior with equipment typical of their level (ie. no <br/>
twink stuff), they regularly out-damage monks up until level 30.  In <br/>
fact, for much of that time, you&#39;ll find yourself being frustrated by <br/>
the damage being done by other melee and hybrid classes in comparison <br/>
to yourself.<br/>
<br/>
3a) However, after level 30 - when we get Flying Kick - monks start <br/>
to come into their own.  You&#39;ll start off doing up to the 50&#39;s and <br/>
work your way to just over 100 at level 50 (I still break into a grin <br/>
whenever I hit for triple digits).  From this point, monks rather <br/>
rapidly catch up to and eventually pass warriors in the <br/>
damage-dealing department.  Remember though, that this is very much <br/>
based on what equipment the warrior can get his or her hands on. <br/>
Once they get their grubby mits on some of that Plane equipment, <br/>
mithril swords, etc. the playing field will start to level again.<br/>
<br/>
	Did that help at all?<br/>
