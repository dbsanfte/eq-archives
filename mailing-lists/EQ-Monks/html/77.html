<div id="ygrps-yiv-1950062687">SH&gt; I am not sure where anyone got the 15 weight is the best for monks...can<br/>
SH&gt; someone please explain this...My AC does not change when i drop down to or<br/>
SH&gt; below 15, if anything it gets worse as I take my patchwork armor off. I<br/>
SH&gt; can&#39;t believe this nonsense about the super low weight unless you are<br/>
SH&gt; talking about encumbering weight. I know monks are su<br/>

Laf, ok, try this, then. Go to the bank, and deposit all your money,<br/>
and enough things untill you are carrying just 15. Exit bank, and<br/>
check your ac. Now, enter bank again, change 1 pp to coppers, and put<br/>
them in your inventory. Go out of bank, and check your weight. It<br/>
should be well above 20. Check your AC. Any difference? I think so.<br/>
<br/>
There is a substacial difference from 15 to 20. I think its somewhere<br/>
in the range of 20 to 40 ac, at my level. That DO mean alot. Its like wearing an<br/>
extra lockjaw vest, heh. Perhaps the difference is not that big around<br/>
your level, but I do know that I allways have teammates carry my loot,<br/>
and split my silvers and coppers with the party, or simply destroy<br/>
them, if they take my weight above 15.<br/>
<br/>
Trust me. It is there. And of cause you cant check if your AC gets<br/>
better by taking a piece of armor off. Besides, you should really try<br/>
to get your hands on some lighter armor. Patchwork weights like hell.<br/>
