Subject: [EQ-Monks] A warning for Fenin Ro players<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I write to let you know of a rather upsetting issue that I am faced with<br/>
at<br/>
&gt; the moment. It appears to only be affecting me, but it is severe enough to<br/>
&gt; bring to your attention as well, I think.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Last night, while zoning from South Keladim into North Keladim (where the<br/>
&gt; bank is) I crashed. A drag, but nothing all that new. The twist is,<br/>
however,<br/>
&gt; I cannot log my monk, Praelor, back onto the server! I tried re-starting<br/>
EQ,<br/>
&gt; re-connecting my ISP, and re-booting my system, all to no avail. I brought<br/>
&gt; in a lvl 2 druid and /petitioned, and spent the next 3 hours speaking with<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; guide and a gm. The GM said he would reset my character to a point prior<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; the disappearance, but could make no promises on when that would occur. So<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; logged and tried again this morning.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And there he was, right where I had started Last night. Everything<br/>
appeared<br/>
&gt; to be fine. I still needed to go to the bank, however, so off to Keladim I<br/>
&gt; went, and upon zoning from S. Keladim into N. Keladim again, I crashed.<br/>
With<br/>
&gt; the same results as last night. Well, it was 6:30 am EST, and no GM&#39;S were<br/>
&gt; online, but I did speak with a guide who promised to forward my problem to<br/>
&gt; then first GM who showed up, but it would not be for several hours.<br/>
&gt; Understandable, given that it was 3:30 am in San Diego.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So now, with time to kill before work, I decided to experiment. I created<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; Dwarven Cleric and ran him into the zone and promptly crashed. So at least<br/>
&gt; it is not a corrupt character file with Praelor. I then created a Dwarven<br/>
&gt; Cleric on The Tribunal server and zoned with no problem. Now I know it is<br/>
&gt; not a corrupt N. Keladim data file and that it is specific to Fenin Ro. A<br/>
&gt; few of my guildmates then create characters on Fenin Ro and zone with no<br/>
&gt; problem, so it is not a server-wide issue.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; All this leads me to believe that it is something specific with the link<br/>
&gt; between my system and the Fenin Ro servers, but I just wanted to give<br/>
&gt; everyone a heads up on this &quot;just in case&quot;. I am planning on re-installing<br/>
&gt; EQ and running all the patches tonight, and will let you know the outcome.<br/>
&gt; With any luck, that will solve everything and Praelor Dileasai will once<br/>
&gt; again be running from all those nasty critters in Mistmoore (hehe). If<br/>
&gt; not... well.. I just don&#39;t really want to think about the &quot;if not&quot;<br/>
scenario<br/>
&gt; yet.<br/>
