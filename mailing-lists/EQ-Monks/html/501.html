<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-889725272">Ok, this is a question because I am getting frustrated. I have had kills <br/>
taken from me twice by a 24th lvl Ranger duel wielding some kind of whip and <br/>
some sword, plus I have had a kill taken by a 24th lvl Paladin with a SBH. I <br/>
am a 26th lvl Monk with just about everything that seems to come recommended <br/>
for equipment. I was hitting first in all three of these fights and then they <br/>
started hitting. When am I going to do a lot more damage then them? I hit <br/>
more often but my hits are in the 10 to 15 hp range typically with a few <br/>
higher but a few lower. The Ranger was hitting in the mid 20&#39;s to lower 30&#39;s <br/>
range with some lower but some higher as well. The Paladin was hitting in the <br/>
mid to upper 30&#39;s. If Monks do so much more damage how did they get the <br/>
kills? I have everything I thought I was supposed to have. My STR is 97, STA <br/>
99, DEX 113, and AGI 110. I have never seen myself doing more damage then <br/>
those other classes around me unless they are significantly lower then I am. <br/>
What is a Monks place in a group? Tank? No. What is the place of a Monk? The <br/>
only thing I can do fairly well is pull from crowded places because I can <br/>
manipulate my Feign well enough to pick out one or two things. In most places <br/>
I have found that is not a great thing for a group. I have never heard people <br/>
give out a call &quot;looking for a great puller&quot; when I stand in a zone looking <br/>
for a group. I also do not think the comparisons should be made with the <br/>
Warrior considering I think we both got the short end when it comes to <br/>
balance. What can a warrior do that a Paladin cannot do most of the time? The <br/>
only thing that is worse off is a Thief. We do not deal the damage in groups. <br/>
That is the casters job. We are designed like a tank and tanks are supposed <br/>
to take damage and that we cannot do. A warrior can do that at least but I <br/>
have found a Ranger or a Paladin can do that just as well with a good healer <br/>
on board. Well, go ahead and grill me for my views. I play a Monk and I am <br/>
26th level but I have disliked the class since 12th level. I continue to look <br/>
for the redeeming qualities. Before you just dismiss me with saying stop <br/>
playing the class then moron. I continue because I have friends and to start <br/>
over would mean I would not be able to group with them. I am just looking for <br/>
a way to redeem my Monk to myself and present myself with the most value to <br/>
any group.</div>
