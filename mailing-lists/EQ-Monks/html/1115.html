While exchanging your agility enhancing jewelry, make a note of the changes to<br/>
your armor class. You will notice that when shedding your carnelian ring, you<br/>
lose, I believe, three units of armor (I could be mistaken tho&#39;, so I will<br/>
reexamine this issue further when I manage to excape from work : ). The Jagged<br/>
Band provides an additional five armor points. Your gain then is two with the<br/>
trade plus three strength points (improving your attack rating by a few<br/>
point).<br/>
With my current AGI of 131, I have noticed no dramatic improvement in the<br/>
frequency of Dodge, Block, etc. over my previous ~115 AGI. I do notice,<br/>
however, that your opponent has a harder time landing blows as your AC rises.<br/>
AGI serves as an additional source of AC, but when you find items like a<br/>
Jagged<br/>
Band that give a greater AC bonus than a similar AGI improving item, go with<br/>
the AC improvement. I&#39;m not certain, but it may be that you do not see the AC<br/>
bonus from AGI items until you add a full 10 point increase. In that case, it<br/>
may be more benificial to go with the AC boosting item. Again, I will take a<br/>
closer look at this later to make sure I am not just blowing smoke, or maybe<br/>
our brothers and sisters have already looked into this and provided some<br/>
answers...<br/>

&gt;I recently managed to buy some Jagged Bands which I<br/>
&gt;have used to replace my Gold Carnelian rings (+5 agi).<br/>
&gt; was this a good choice?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I currently use onyx earrings (+2 agi).  I want to<br/>
&gt;update this.  what should I be looking for<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks<br/>
