<div id="ygrps-yiv-1303779145">You could get those little motorized legos and try to build a button<br/>
pusher.  Its not hard, and I&#39;ve seen it done before.  Don&#39;t know how it&#39;d<br/>
work though.  And you know those little strange bird things, that dip their<br/>
beak repeatedly, depending on room temperature?  This is just idle<br/>
speculation...  but if you could position it to hit your 1 key......<br/>

&gt; Lately Ive been trying to think of a way to train hard-to-learn skills<br/>
&gt; while Im sleeping - such as instill doubt.  I know you can target a corpse<br/>
&gt; and train ID.  I have set up my sidewinder precision pro, using its<br/>
profiler<br/>
&gt; software, to press #s 1-6 (the skill hotkeys) by just pressing 1 button on<br/>
&gt; the joystick.  Thing is, I can&#39;t figure out any way to get this button to<br/>
be<br/>
&gt; pressed down over and over (if you hold it down with a rubberband or<br/>
&gt; similar, it will work once, but wont keep pressing your hotkeys all<br/>
night).<br/>
&gt; Sidewinder doesnt seem to have auto-fire.  I know that gravis makes a<br/>
&gt; joystick (or is it gamepad?) with autofire but I&#39;d rather not spend a ton<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; money - I already pay 8 bucks a month for this game =P<br/>
&gt; Has anyone put some thought into this?  Anyone ever created a<br/>
&gt; button-presser?  Let me know what you folks think - I&#39;d rather not spend<br/>
my<br/>
&gt; waking hours pressing hotkeys =)<br/>
