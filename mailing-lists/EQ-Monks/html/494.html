 </span></blockquote>Depending on where you are Young Brother, the steep mountain walls outside of Freeport are good Safe Fall training spots (any steep wall could suffice though).  I saw this tip posted on a monk board.<br/>
<br/>
Outside of FP, either in East Commons or North Ro, the mountains to the side of the inner zones are great places to train that skill up.  You do not need to take damage, just as long as you make that skipping sound as you descend.<br/>
<br/>
Find an almost sheer wall, back up all the way to the top then run down.  Every time you trip, you will up your chances for a skill increase.  Back up to the top, then repeat.  I did this a few nights ago at the FP/NRo wall and managed to get 45 skill increases in about 30 minutes...(now 112)<br/>
<br/>
Use caution and make sure you do not jump off the top of the cliff (some have flat spots at the top that you can launch from), I only did this to train my Bind Wound, taking 275 DMG 2 times to lower my HPs (608 total).  If you have less HPs, you could be doomed.<br/>
<br/>
You may even get some odd stares from passers-by like I did; &#39;What&#39;s that Monk doing?&#39;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Safe training to you Brothers and Sisters.<br/>
