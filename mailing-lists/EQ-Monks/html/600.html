<div id="ygrps-yiv-1844840684">Ok. Point well taken. Let me try to re-phrase and remain a calmer, more<br/>
productive Praelor =).<br/>
<br/>
Does twinking affect more than the twinked? IMHO yes it does. My PoF example<br/>
illustrates that, even though someone has pointed out an alternate reasoning<br/>
on why the level restriction was put into place (I wont go into a debate on<br/>
that as it is a different subject altogether. Suffice it to say that the<br/>
alternate reasoning was just as valid as mine and I agree with it).<br/>
<br/>
My stance is not one of jealousy or envy. If it were, I would have my full<br/>
shiverback tonight. I am in a guild with lvl 35+ members who had invited me<br/>
a number of times into PoF with them for Shiverback before it was closed off<br/>
to me. Each time I had declined. I knew I was not ready for such a venture.<br/>
They have invited me to the depths of Lower Guk, and again I have declined.<br/>
Soon I will be ready for Guk, and then and only then will I go. Do I want<br/>
the azure sleeves and serp bracers? Absolutely. Will I buy them if I get an<br/>
opportunity? Definitely. Would I accept one as a gift? Perhaps. It would<br/>
depend upon who it was coming from. There is a thin line between the<br/>
occasional gift and outright twinking. A full suit of Shiverback at lvl 19<br/>
is not a gift. A BP necklace at lvl 19 could be. Would I take Praelor and go<br/>
out and buy a full suit of steel plate (or whatever.. I don&#39;t know armors<br/>
much outside what monks can wear) for a new cleric I was starting? Not a<br/>
chance. And yet I have a friend who did just that. And did it while he owed<br/>
me 100 plat! That is the selfishness I refer to. And that is the type of<br/>
behavior that reflects upon all monks. When you think back to last weekend,<br/>
do you first remember what a grand time you had in that group in Aviaks, or<br/>
do you first remember that &lt;expletive deleted&gt; who did nothing but steal<br/>
everyone&#39;s kills in Pickclaws all night? Do you remember the fun<br/>
conversation you had with that little gnome on the boat to Butcherblock, or<br/>
do you remember that blue con in Solusek running around in full rubicite and<br/>
duel wielding 2 Ykesha (or whatever that sword is called) shouting for help?<br/>
People tend to remember negative experiences first, negative impressions<br/>
first. I personally have never grouped with someone who was obviously a<br/>
twink, and have removed myself from groups when one would join. I do not<br/>
wish to be associated with that type of selfish attitude, as I think it<br/>
looks bad for all those who are associated with it.<br/>
<br/>
I know there is no stopping twinking. And believe it or not, I don&#39;t get mad<br/>
in game about it. I have developed a definite rp attitude and opinion<br/>
towards the twink. More often than not I chuckle softly to myself and go my<br/>
merry way, avoiding the issue in-game entirely and knowing that this poor<br/>
lvl 15 in full steel will perish in the oasis just as many times as I did in<br/>
woven and mesh. But OOC I will be as vociferous and adamantly against<br/>
twinking as my nerves will allow me =).<br/>
<br/>
And now for a little fun =)<br/>
<br/>
Hamlet, the Twink of Norrath<br/>
<br/>
To twink, or not to twink, that is the question,<br/>
Whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer<br/>
The slings and arrows of outrageous demons<br/>
Or take gifts amongst a sea of friends,<br/>
And by opposing, confuse them, to die to twink<br/>
No more, and by a twink, to say we end<br/>
The heartache, and the thousand nat&#39;ral shocks<br/>
That flesh is heir to; Tis a attitude<br/>
Devout to be wished to die than twink,.<br/>
To twink, perchance to die; Aye there&#39;s the rub,<br/>
For in that death of twink what eyes may come<br/>
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil<br/>
Must give us pause, there&#39;s the respect<br/>
That makes mockery of so long life.<br/>
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,<br/>
The demons claw, the high level&#39;d costume,<br/>
the pangs of envied gear, the lawless delay,<br/>
The insolence of office, and the spurns<br/>
Of the patient merit him unworthy that takes<br/>
Before his time a suit of gleaming rubicite.<br/>
Who would these black pearls bear,<br/>
To eat and sleep under a pamper&#39;d life<br/>
But then dread possible death in<br/>
The undiscovered country from who&#39;s corpse<br/>
No armor returns, puzzles the will,<br/>
And makes us rather bear that gear we have,<br/>
Than fly to others that we cannot ourselves obtain.<br/>
Lack of conscience does make Twinkers of us all.<br/>
And thus the natural hue of evolution<br/>
Is sickly ore with the pale cast of fire emeralds<br/>
And enterprises of great pitch and moment<br/>
With this regard, their currents turn awry<br/>
And loose the name of action. Soft you now,<br/>
For Norrath calls for heroes and I shall answer:<br/>
Be all our twinks outnumbered..<br/>
<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt; it is not about jealousy. It is about taking pride in actually earning<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt;  gear I wear and knowing that what I have, I got for myself, whether by<br/>
&gt;  earning coin enough to buy it or by venturing and slaying the beast that<br/>
&gt;  carries it. I got it. I did not have it handed to me on a silver platter<br/>
&gt; by<br/>
&gt;  some high level friend who already has no problem getting as many as he<br/>
&gt;  wants.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  Kind of like that spoiled rich kid in high school who was driving the<br/>
&gt;  Corvette. Sure he looks cool, but you know damn well he didn&#39;t pay for it<br/>
&gt; or<br/>
&gt;  the insurance that comes with it. Would I like to own a vette? you bet.<br/>
&gt;  Would I take one if my folks offered it to me? hell no. All a matter of<br/>
&gt; self<br/>
&gt;  pride vs. selfishness &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  Jealousy. Who cares what else anyone has, simply because they had it<br/>
&gt; handed <br/>
&gt; to them? If you are essentially concerned with what you&#39;ve earned, then<br/>
&gt; why <br/>
&gt; does what others have bother you so much? It sounds like envy, and it at <br/>
&gt; best, reactive, rather than proactive. Bottled up ressentiment expressing <br/>
&gt; itself.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  I am not twinked. Everything I have, I have earned. But the fact that <br/>
&gt; someone else has not is irrelevant to me (unless I am harmed by it, as in<br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; PoF example someone gave earlier.) Be proud of what you&#39;ve earned, and do <br/>
&gt; your best to have fun.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  Just my thoughts on this matter... And btw, Praelor, I have enjoyed many<br/>
&gt; of <br/>
&gt; your thoughtful posts. I disagree with you about this, though.<br/>
