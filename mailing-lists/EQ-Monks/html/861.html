<b>Subject:</b> Soloing sucks <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-870144793">Whoever said wizzie can&#39;t solo their way to 50 is sadly mistaken. They can do <br/>
it a lot easier than us monks, it&#39;s called root.  I&#39;ve seen it many times.  <br/>
But on the main point of this lil rant, soloing sucks.  In more than one way. <br/>
 First, it&#39;s boring as hell, you&#39;re all alone with nobody to talk to.  <br/>
Second, it&#39;s dangerous, you&#39;re in trouble if more than you can handle comes <br/>
along, and when you&#39;re soloing, that&#39;s normally more than one mob, which <br/>
happens at the worst times.  Third, you don&#39;t get half of what was designed <br/>
for this game, a massive MULTIPLAYER game,  that&#39;s what everybody is there <br/>
for, to make friends, interact and have fun together, in groups.  Fourth, <br/>
when you do make lvl 50, you&#39;ll want good equipment, and for that, you need <br/>
to group.  Well, from personal experience, I really dislike ppl that have <br/>
soloed their way up the lvls because they have no clue how to use their char <br/>
in a group.  And it is grossly obvious when a person has done that, I simply <br/>
won&#39;t group with them again.  You NEED to group with ppl to help you out <br/>
later on, the &#39;I scratch your back, you scratch mine&#39; deal.  Don&#39;t get me <br/>
wrong, once you&#39;ve climbed that ladder it&#39;s fun to go see what you can do on <br/>
your own, but soloing the whole way does not pay off in the long run.  Just <br/>
about all the high lvl ppl I know agree with me on this subject and don&#39;t <br/>
like to group with solos.  Well, I&#39;m done bitchin about soloists.<br/>
