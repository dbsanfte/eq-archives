&gt;You have attained a level of experience that I may not obtain for months.<br/>
&gt;Please understand that this is based on my limited experience and opinion.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sorry, that was not my intention.  Like I said, my monk was great fun until<br/>
very high levels for me so I expect you will enjoy your monk for quite a<br/>
while.  If he wasn&#39;t I would not have gotten him so far.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Prehaps those of us who haven&#39;t played under the old feign death, will find<br/>
&gt;other means to deal with the problems you listed.  No disrespect meant to<br/>
&gt;you or any of the others, but it sounds like feign death was a crutch.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well I did not speak at all of FD pulling which is what you probably heard<br/>
everyone mention.  And FD IS a crutch.  It was meant to be.  I continued<br/>
playing my monk because we were the masters of melee and also because<br/>
of FD (I started my FD countdown at 12th level).  At my level, rogues are the<br/>
masters of melee and FD simply doesn&#39;t work well enough to use as a safety<br/>
net.  Plus the mobs I face cannot reasonably be meleed to death.  We are<br/>
just there to do damage to keep the mobs thinking about us while the nukers<br/>
and DoTers (and healers) so their jobs.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Maybe at higher levels we need to learn to adjust our tactics and stop<br/>
&gt;meeting problems head on.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, the FD pull technique was meant for just that 8).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Strip us, and we are still deadly.  I think we just have<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t get to my level just so I can still kill mobs while looking for my<br/>
corpse.<br/>
But of course that was another role for FD.  Corpse recovery missions.  No<br/>
longer.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I know a lot of people are going to disagree with me, but Verant&#39;s change to<br/>
&gt;the feign death is warranted. People WERE exploiting the FD especially<br/>
&gt;inside the planes. One way to fix that WITHOUT screwing a lot of lower level<br/>
&gt;people was to make it where any creature under level 35, would think you<br/>
&gt;were dead and forget about you while creatures 35th and up would use the<br/>
&gt;different percentages setup by Verant. I think this fair.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Inside the plains?  At 36th level (unless you have another plane level char)<br/>
I don&#39;t see how you can come to that conclusion.  If anything, the change<br/>
to FD is even more of an exploit.  Imagine now that every mob in the game<br/>
is able to track monks without fail.  And as another post mentioned.  If you<br/>
think something is an exploit, why would you say it is ok for mobs under 35th<br/>
level?  I have always accepted that feigning on non KoS mobs and then<br/>
popping back up (to bandage or whatnot) was something of an exploit and I<br/>
have been expecting a fix.  If they removed that a lot of lower level monks<br/>
who relied on it to kill aviaks or whatever would have grumbled loudly as it<br/>
would remove their main soloing technique (what would your reaction be if<br/>
they did that to you at say 20th level or so?).  However the nerf they did to FD<br/>
didn&#39;t fix an exploit.  It just gave the mobs one.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I have ONLY used<br/>
&gt;feign death in serious situations where there was a train on my butt and I<br/>
&gt;was definitely going to die because I couldn&#39;t make it to a zone.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Good luck now since that aspect of FD has also been seriously degraded.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I feel<br/>
&gt;that&#39;s what it was intended to do and some people figured out a way to<br/>
&gt;exploit it in the planes with the big creatures. So thats that. I&#39;m fine<br/>
&gt;with it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What difference does it make how  it was intended?  What you are saying is<br/>
that verant should be expected to make things like tactics, strategy, and other<br/>
forms of thinking in the game illegal.  Giving mob an unlimited<br/>
tracking/telepathic<br/>
ability is the exploit here.  What monks did was perfectly reasonable as long as<br/>
mobs aren&#39;t telepathically linked, which - oh no - now they are!   Telepathic<br/>
orcs.<br/>
What will they think of next.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Well, this is just getting plain silly. Your monk is not a worthless pile of<br/>
&gt;meat. Its not a mana sponge, or a helpless school girl. The monk class at<br/>
&gt;any level does a Great Deal of Damage, and in my opinion more than any<br/>
&gt;other melee class with the exception of a warrior with Plane of Fear equipment.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not a mana sponge?  How many 120+ hits do you think a monk can take? See<br/>
how long you can stand up to the frenzied ghoul even at 50th when you out level<br/>
him by 5 or so!  The next best thing to a healer is a great taunting tank or<br/>
another<br/>
melee class that dishes out more damage.  I certainly am not whining about other<br/>
classes doing more damage than me.  I&#39;d love to have them in my group!  The<br/>
problem I face is that if I go into a zone shouting &quot;monk looking for group&quot; I<br/>
will be<br/>
met by silence.  Why?  Suppose I actually do outdamage other classes.  The<br/>
problem is that I can&#39;t outdmage by enough to compensate for:<br/>
<br/>
the massive HPs of a warrior (complete heal becomes much more efficient and<br/>
the warrior gives the cleric the time to cast it, and the warrior can taunt the<br/>
mob<br/>
off when it inevitably goes after the cleric).<br/>
<br/>
the dual wielding ability of a ranger with great weapons (ykesha = 44th level<br/>
monk with similar skill) who can snare SOW and TRACK.<br/>
<br/>
Paladins with great quest weapons with a ton of HP, a complete heal, great<br/>
taunting, and a great AC.  Not to mention a role as a backup healer<br/>
<br/>
Rogues just tear mobs apart, easily outdamaging any other melee class in the<br/>
game at high levels.  Of course they are in far worse shape than monks without<br/>
someone taking the mobs off them.  Rogues were born nerfed and will die<br/>
nerfed.  But the rogue is still the master of melee.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I didn&#39;t say it was. I don&#39;t think FD pulling is an exploit. It is handled<br/>
&gt;wrong in the Gameplay Logic. Personally I think once you FD and a mob _sees_<br/>
&gt;you back on your feet again, it should never believe another oneo of you<br/>
&gt;FDs. As I&#39;ve said before, Verant has a MUD mentality in which they balance<br/>
&gt;gameplay at the expense of logic. This is bad design.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What you neglect here is the fact that the mobs you are FD pulling (actually<br/>
the mobs you aren&#39;t pulling) DON&#39;T see you get up, assuming you are doing<br/>
it right.  Why should they run back to you when they don&#39;t see you get up?  Of<br/>
all the people who look down on us for complaining about the nerf, not ONE<br/>
person has managed to explain what makes this more logical.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;back to first post&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Your strength lies not with one or two glorious swings for 70 points of<br/>
&gt;damage, but in four punches for 23, and a flying kick for 52. Your Armor<br/>
&gt;class is not as high as a warriors, it never will be. Get used to it, but<br/>
&gt;also get used to Block, Dodge, Block. You hit points are lower, until you<br/>
&gt;factor in a 25% hit point heal every six minutes, you&#39;re selling yourself<br/>
&gt;short.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How about a 44th level ranger hitting 4 times with his ykesha for 40+ each<br/>
and a proc for 70?  I have kicked for 111, but I usually miss and my average<br/>
damage is maybe 40ish.  Our defensive skills cap the same as theirs so they<br/>
will dodge parry riposte about as much as we do.<br/>
<br/>
When travelling with a healer or 3 you should never need mend unless you bite<br/>
off more than you can chew.  But if that happens your group is more likely to<br/>
evac.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;As for playing with Twinked characters who out damage you, I must answer to<br/>
&gt;the positive. I&#39;ve been playing with Ranger and Bard both of which carry top<br/>
&gt;of the line Ykeesha&#39;s and they generally out damage me (then again, they<br/>
&gt;take the damage then, too and I&#39;m a hell of a lot harder to hit than some<br/>
&gt;ranger). The gap is narrowing however, and would be closed if they were not<br/>
&gt;wearing haste sashes. Remember, the higher you level, the less of an<br/>
&gt;advantage Twinking Gives.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It is very easy to see how much of an impact twinking gives.  But it is not<br/>
really<br/>
a matter of twinking.  Equipment is permanent.  And on old servers, with limited<br/>
inventory/bank space, newer/better weapons will find their way down the line<br/>
and the average level character holding a particular prize will decline over<br/>
time.<br/>
That&#39;s just the way the server based economy works.  So it isn&#39;t a matter of<br/>
monks<br/>
getting worse, it is a matter of the weapons held by other melee classes getting<br/>
better.  I am sure Verant intended the monks to be masters of melee.  For a<br/>
while<br/>
they succeeded quite well in my opinion.  However, as the other melee classes of<br/>
a particular level improve over time with new weapons, monks have basically been<br/>
gathering dust and this melee edge has shrunk or become non-existent to the<br/>
point<br/>
that the other classes offer other things that outweigh any supposed edge we may<br/>
have.<br/>
<br/>
For 1-handed weapons, the best a monk can ever do is dmg 14 delay 36.  There<br/>
are now a ton of weapons in the game that have better dmg/delay ratios than that<br/>
and also proc for even more damage (at 44th level a monk is 12/36 which is the<br/>
same ratio as a ykesha).  Giving that to a warrior who has 1.5-2x your hp, and<br/>
can<br/>
taunt makes a monks damage dealing capacity in a group very much in doubt.  Plus<br/>
at the highest levels, melee is just to keep the mobs busy while the DoTs do<br/>
their job<br/>
and nukes finish the mob off.  When shamans and druids can heal and DoT for<br/>
2000+ and wizards can chuck 1100+ per ice comet, the extra 2-3 points per hit we<br/>
may or may not be adding just don&#39;t seem to be enough to compensate the group<br/>
for<br/>
any of the other abilities the other melee classes bring.  That is the reason<br/>
why monks<br/>
got defined as pullers because it was the only thing we were unarguably the best<br/>
at<br/>
and of the most important contributions anyone can make to a group.  How many<br/>
plane or dragon raids were considered to require a monk (pre-patch)?  It was<br/>
a moot point.  You had one or you just didn&#39;t bother.  Now, monks can still<br/>
chain<br/>
pull if necessary and lay on the ground.  Now even a wizard out melees the<br/>
monk.  I could be doing that, but that&#39;s just not any fun.  Which is the whole<br/>
point.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Yes Verant has changed our most unique skill, it will still save youin tight<br/>
&gt;situations<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Think again.  Even the core purpose for FD has been seriously nerfed.  It<br/>
fails way way way too much, and new spawns can now see through it.  And<br/>
FD is now very very dangerous not just to the monk but to anyone in the same<br/>
zone.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;To be honest, I think we&#39;ve passed the meaningful discussion of the class<br/>
&gt;and have entered into &quot;the Grass is Greener&quot; syndrome. If you&#39;re so unhappy<br/>
&gt;with your Monk, Give It Up and go play a Dark Elf Necro. Please don&#39;t take<br/>
&gt;the Monk Name in the Realm of Envious Complainers.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It has nothing to do with any other class being better.  I am all in favor of<br/>
warriors rangers and what not being great in my group.  I am not looking to<br/>
be the star of the show.  I just want to be invited to a show once in a while.<br/>
The problem I have is not with all these great weapons lying around, but the<br/>
general consensus at high levels that &quot;monks are only needed for pulling, and<br/>
if they can&#39;t pull why invite them into the group?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;rant on&gt;<br/>
That being said, I hear too much of this &quot;play another character if you don&#39;t<br/>
like<br/>
the change&quot; crap.  Why even play in a game that consistently makes these sorts<br/>
of changes?  If I wanted to play a DE necro, I would have made one already (of<br/>
course they have been seriously nerfed as well, but not as badly because they<br/>
are still desirable in groups).<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to play a monk.  The monk I wanted to play existed when the game<br/>
started.  I had something to look forward to.  He doesn&#39;t anymore and there is<br/>
nothing for me to look forward to unless I like to play with my face attached to<br/>
the ground while the action surrounds me.  In any case, even if I were to make<br/>
another character, what will stop Verant from nerfing that class into the<br/>
ground?<br/>
Take a look at what&#39;s on the test server.  Shaman spell diurations (eg SOW) are<br/>
cut in half) and druids lost tracking.  Who knows what else.  Will monks get<br/>
something in the future to make them seem useful again?  Sure.  They will<br/>
introduce the Iskar monk removing yet another unique aspect of the (human)<br/>
monk.  What race will virtually all new monks be once the expansion comes?<br/>
Humans? Guess again.  It is very possible (and I am not prone to conspiracy<br/>
theories) that the human monk is being phased out of existence.  Of course<br/>
we&#39;ll have to wait and see what the new race is like, but the email I got from<br/>
Verant stated very little of what will be new aside from Iskar monks.  An<br/>
interview with brad McQuaid tells us not to expect any new skills unless we are<br/>
Iskar.<br/>
<br/>
Tell me what else I can look forward to.<br/>
&lt;rant off&gt;</div>
