<div id="ygrps-yiv-566486712">I&#39;m remembering back when I was a young&#39;un many months ago, that I did see<br/>
the alchemist spawn inside the tent at the camp right by RunnyEye.  I could<br/>
be wrong, but I honestly remember it spawning there.  I&#39;ll camp the other<br/>
tent now, though. :)<br/>
<br/>
As for the gelatinous cube and goblin captain in Runny, what level are they?<br/>
I know approximately where to find them, but have no idea what level they<br/>
are.  Some friends owe me a favor for helping them camp things for their<br/>
quests, so I&#39;m gonna call in the favor. :)<br/>

&gt; I got my Treant Fists a little more than 3 weeks ago.<br/>
&gt; As I said, the alchemist and his place holders (including Mooto) in Misty<br/>
&gt; are wanderers, and go to other camps, and the one you are talking about is<br/>
&gt; their first goal. You may have intercept them while they were wandering.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I am sure that the spawns are every 20 minutes, and it is not only Mooto,<br/>
&gt; but also a warrior or a shaman so you may have missed some place holders.<br/>
&gt; I have never seen a place holder in the gorge outside the 72-85 min range.<br/>
&gt; You have to be very careful, because if people are fighting next to the<br/>
&gt; zone, it can be very difficult to see the exact spawns and when they are<br/>
&gt; killed.<br/>
&gt; Of course, everything I say is true if they have not changed anything<br/>

&gt; Hmm Maybe they moved the spawn in Misty.  When I got the alchemist there (<br/>
&gt; after<br/>
&gt; about 2 hours of camping) I was at the camp right next to the running eye<br/>
&gt; zone,<br/>
&gt; and the alchemist spawned right ontop of me.  Also my experience there was<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; mooto spawned only every hour or so<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I never moved to any of the otehr goblin camps.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As far as your info on the Gorge spawn goes.  It conforms to my<br/>
 </span></blockquote>experience.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Only thing I would add is that the 72-80 minte spawn seems to have a much<br/>
&gt; wider<br/>
&gt; range than that - sometimes you wont get a double spawn for more than 2<br/>
&gt; hours.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I did the quest when I was levle 19, about 3 weeks ago.  Maybe your info<br/>
 </span></blockquote>is<br/>
