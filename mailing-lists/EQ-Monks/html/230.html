    Monks armor can be tricky as any point over 14 in weight will lower our armor class. Right now I would start saving your coins as for you it will be easy as seeing that you are a monk you really have nothing to spend your money on. Around 10th level I would look to make the trek down to Guk and hang out in the front area of the dungeon. Keep your eyes peeled for Woven or Mesh armor these are monk staples. If you can afford the Mesh go for it and besides you really aren&#39;t going to have anything to spend you coin on for awhile. If you can get an LJ tunic in Oasis pick one up but this will be based on the amount of money you have and you really will not be very effective in that zone till around level 12 or so. But start with getting some Woven or mesh...One thing you can look into is getting in some Wisp hunting parties and putting those netted gloves to use. Also if you are in Qeynos hit the Aqueducts and get a full suit of netted. Not all that great for armor but it is light and will allow you to carry more other stuff that will make you the coin needed to buy mesh or woven. Mesh being the better of all three.<br/>

Hope this all helped.<br/>

  Hey, I am a newbie at the monk thing. I was wondering if someone can help me out with what armour is the best to try and get.  I am level 6 and have Netted Gloves and the rest is Leather.  I hear about netted, woven and mesh.  Can someone provide some info on where i can get them? And whats a decent price to pay players for any of these?<br/>
<br/>

  k Thx<br/>
