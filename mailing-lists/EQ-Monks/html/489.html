<div id="ygrps-yiv-208465920"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; 1.    Does dual weild has level cap? It seems that my dual wield is more<br/>
&gt; than 25  when I&#39;m just only level 4.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Dual weild is always higher then all skills it also depends on how many<br/>
practices you put into it<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 2.    How does safe fall work? Is it automatic?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes Safe Fall works automatically as you fall more and more you will see it<br/>
go up and as time goes on falls that would have hurt will no longer hurt or<br/>
you will take much less damage.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 3.    What is the best glove I can get now to hit magical?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Level 4 you say. Try and get some netted in Qeynos sewers if you are over<br/>
there in a few more levels. Or save your pennies and buy some woven or Mesh.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this all helps<br/>
