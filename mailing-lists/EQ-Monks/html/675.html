<div id="ygrps-yiv-831149545">ahhh and the twinkers respond.  You know what...just keep twinking<br/>
away...eventually you will get bored with the game and leave.<br/>
Actually...i think I will just move to Tallon Zek servers.  That way I can<br/>
take care of twinkers...one twink at a time.<br/>
<br/>
The kindergarden mentality on the normal servers of &quot;i can do what i want<br/>
and you can&#39;t do anything about it&quot;  sickens me.  Damn I wish every server<br/>
was PvP....no twinkers....and the only assholes would be the ones who can<br/>
defend themselves.<br/>
