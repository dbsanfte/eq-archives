No I dont see a problem with this but if you wish to RP your monk maybe you<br/>
should not buy anything but only use what items you loot yourself. this way<br/>
you would not have to save up so much money. Another thoguht is that those<br/>
bracers come off of a difficult Mob in Lguk. at level 16 you werent<br/>
&quot;supposed&quot; to have those. Back at level 16 when E-marr was still new and the<br/>
highest playes were only in there low 30&#39;s noone had those bracers. People<br/>
on the server didnt even know where they came from. I Think I was wearing<br/>
woven still at that point. dont dispair because you dont have level 30<br/>
equipment at level 16. you will get it eventually.<br/>

&gt; I have always thought that monks should be characters of moderation and<br/>
&gt; poverty.  I have tried to play my character that way.  I have managed to<br/>
&gt; squrriel away 250 pp.  I figured that would handle most of my expenses for<br/>
&gt; the foreseeable future.  I buy muffins and water for food and drink.  All<br/>
&gt; of my magic tiems have been given to me or looted off of drops.  However,<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; have reached an impasse.  Someone last night was auctioning off Serpent<br/>
&gt; bracers.  When I asked how much, I was shocked to hear 800 pp.  I guess<br/>
&gt; that I am going to have to break down and loot everything or hope that I<br/>
&gt; stumble across a raqre drop.  I am not going to be able to afford anything<br/>
&gt; better if I don&#39;t do so.  I think it is sad, that if I am going to be a<br/>
&gt; successful adventurer, I am going to have to be like the rest of the money<br/>
&gt; grubbing classes:  Rogues, Shadow Knights,  Warriors, Druids, Shamans,<br/>
&gt; Rangers, Bards,  Enchanters, Wizards, Magicians, Necromancers,  holy<br/>
&gt; Clerics and pious Paladins.  Does anyone else see a problem with this?<br/>
