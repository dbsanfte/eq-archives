<div id="ygrps-yiv-2106960357">I think that you are right on everything, except that as a melee class you<br/>
should have been skilling bind wound throughout all of your levels (what<br/>
else are you going to waste money on) Anyways... if that mob isn&#39;t attacking<br/>
you, you can heal for like 20-30 HP (skill lvl 70-130) a pop..<br/>
<br/>
But i do believe you are right we need to be able to use mend on other<br/>
people... like paladins can use lay hands on other people.</div>
