&gt;<br/>
&gt; First off I am fairly new to EQ... tomorrow I will<br/>
&gt; have been playing for a week in real life time.  I<br/>
&gt; spent a lot of time looking into the game before I<br/>
&gt; bought and decided I would have the most fun playing a<br/>
&gt; monk.  I started a Monk character and have been<br/>
&gt; immensily satisfied, I am level 8. (I started in<br/>
&gt; freeport)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Onto sashes.  I have had horrible experiences with<br/>
&gt; sashes.  I got the white sash at Level 2, you would<br/>
&gt; have a hell of a time killing deathfist pawns at level<br/>
&gt; 1 so I think most ppl get it at 2.  Anyway... by 5 I<br/>
&gt; was out of the newbie area and began searching for the<br/>
&gt; things needed for the yellow headband, to refresh our<br/>
&gt; memory you need a Tarantula Chitin, a Deathfist<br/>
&gt; Slashed Belt, and a Giant Snake Rattle.  I worked hard<br/>
&gt; to get these items, and because I was trying at a<br/>
&gt; lower level than I should it was very difficult.  I<br/>
&gt; managed to kill a tarantula with a group of 4 people.<br/>
&gt; I also found the  rattle and slashed belt this way.<br/>
&gt; Great I thought, I as level 6 and I was about to get<br/>
&gt; something that most ppl can&#39;t get on their own till 7<br/>
&gt; or 8.  I took the stuff back, turned it all in and I<br/>
&gt; got nothing.  I was so pissed.  I had to go back to<br/>
&gt; newbie area to find all the stuff I needed for white,<br/>
&gt; then I went back and I was so pissed that I bought the<br/>
&gt; giant snake rattle and chitin and managed to find<br/>
&gt; someone to give me the slashed belt.  This time I<br/>
&gt; turned it in and it worked.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not looking forward to Orange tho.  I need a<br/>
&gt; Greater Lightstone, Legionaire&#39;s bracers, and a<br/>
&gt; Cutthroat insignia ring.  I have the latter and I can<br/>
&gt; buy the former if I have to but I don&#39;t have a clue<br/>
&gt; what the legionare&#39;s bracers are... its probably not<br/>
&gt; worth the effort<br/>
