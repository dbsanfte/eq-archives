<div id="ygrps-yiv-136555693">Hrmmm...no, if you give it more of a bit of intropection, that&#39;s not really<br/>
true.  It&#39;s a different type of game than say, Heroes of Might and Magic,<br/>
where this statement would be valid.  This type of game has a twist to it -<br/>
the human social element.  That, I think, more than anything else is what<br/>
elevates it beyond a game to many.<br/>
<br/>
Humans are social creatures as a species.  We, as a species, have a deep and<br/>
abiding need to interact with others.  In this way is how it (and any<br/>
MMORPG) transcends being &quot;just a game&quot;.  It doesn&#39;t have anything to do with<br/>
the code or the virtual mobs that you virtually slay, but rather the people<br/>
beyond the icons with whom you will tend to build real relationships - often<br/>
without realizing it.  Whether it&#39;s with your drinking buddies in a bar<br/>
watching the game, going out dancing with your girlfriends, or sitting in<br/>
the king room in Sol B, killing kobold and role-playing/BSing about your job<br/>
in the down time, makes no difference.  Social interaction is still social<br/>
interaction, regardless of the arena it takes place in.<br/>
<br/>
If I had to speculate, I&#39;d say that the changes to feign death, or perhaps<br/>
more accurately now, non-monks perceptions of monks due to the changes in<br/>
feign death, negatively impact the ability of monks to continue to explore<br/>
the social aspect of the game, i.e., difficulty getting into groups of<br/>
strangers, thus not being able to share in a group activity and make new<br/>
friends, etc., that is the most damaging aspect of what has transpired and<br/>
the core root of the anger and outrage many monks express.<br/>
<br/>
Just my thoughts...take them for that and nothing more.<br/>

&gt; It should not be more than a game.  Because that is ALL it is, a game.<br/>
&gt; If its more to you, then you seriously need to stop &quot;playing&quot; it,<br/>
&gt; readjust your life, realize how little those bytes stored on <br/>
&gt; a computer<br/>
&gt; in california really should mean to you.<br/>
