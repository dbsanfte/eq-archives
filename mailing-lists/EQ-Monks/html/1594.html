&gt; I found it much worse...  At least in the elder room I could go around a<br/>
&gt; kill blue mobs..  In the Gorge EVERYTHING is green.  With the help of<br/>
&gt; a low level ranger I got bored enough and cleared the zone of all mobs we<br/>
&gt; could find on tracking!  =)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The other 3 weren&#39;t too bad..  The other alchemist in Misty you just camp<br/>
&gt; the Motto spawn spot (far left tent).  The cube is almost always there,<br/>
&gt; and the last one I guess he spawns all the time.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Br Z took me 3* 8 hour session and 3* 2 hours session to find. Br Qwinn<br/>
has so far been 1* 10 hour, 1* 8 hour, 1* 4 hours, 3* 2 hour sessions<br/>
and still no sign of him. And there is absolutely nothing blue for me to<br/>
kill in SKaranas, I sit just south of the entrance to Paw doing nothing,<br/>
save the occasion ooc (&quot;anyone seen Br Qwinn?&quot;). Oddly if I get a<br/>
response (which is rarely) I get &quot;I haven&#39;t seen him since 2 patches<br/>
ago&quot; or &quot;I haven&#39;t seen him in over a week&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I spent 70 hours trying to get a gnome toy from Nilits Contraption (for<br/>
the kerran toy) before giving up, it was slightly better then skaranas<br/>
atleast I felt like I was increasing my chances by killing everything<br/>
that moved outside the mino caves. The really stupid thing is the guy<br/>
you talk to, to get the clue as to what to kill says &quot;Talk not now! My<br/>
creation runs wild!&quot; .... hmmm no ... no it certainly is not running<br/>
wild.</div>
