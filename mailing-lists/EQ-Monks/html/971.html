<div id="ygrps-yiv-407717189"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;1)  I managed to buy some Cured Silk Armor for a<br/>
&gt;relativily low price.  So my choice is between Cured<br/>
&gt;Silk Gi or Foreman&#39;s tunic.  Any input?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I used to hate the look of mesh and my Lockjaw vest because they appeared<br/>
just like leather. When cured silk came around, I gave up the LJ vest to<br/>
wear the gi. After a while, though, I decided that combining the LJ vest<br/>
with cured silk armbands, pants, and sandals still gave me a distinctive<br/>
monk look while offering superior protection.<br/>
<br/>
I recently acquired a Foreman&#39;s tunic from a friend and love it. It looks<br/>
like leather, too, but with the rest of my monk look I don&#39;t mind at all.<br/>
It will hold me until I can get a Syythrak hide vest and then eventually<br/>
shiverback.<br/>
<br/>
The Foreman&#39;s tunic comes off the fire goblin foreman in Solusek&#39;s Eye<br/>
(SolA). It sells for 250-350pp, mostly because it&#39;s also desired by rangers<br/>
and druids. In my opinion it isn&#39;t worth the money compared to the LJ vest,<br/>
as +3 STR isn&#39;t going to change the way you play your monk.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;2)  Where is a good place for a level 20 to hunt. <br/>
&gt;&gt;From 14-17 I hunted oasis and from 17-20 I hunted East<br/>
&gt;Karana.  Any recomendations?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Levels 17-20 should hunt in Highpass Hold. The orc side is phenomenal<br/>
experience and loot, and you can level very quickly. At level 20, move into<br/>
High Keep basement. Start out in a small (3-4 player) group in the lookout<br/>
room (any veteran will be able to show you where that is). After a level or<br/>
two, move into a full group in the guard room. With a well-rounded group,<br/>
you&#39;ll be able to power level here and make some great cash as well. This<br/>
room has taken me to 24th level.<br/>
<br/>
It gets a little boring in terms of scenery, but the High Keep basement can<br/>
level you all the way into the low 30&#39;s by moving up to the warrior and<br/>
raider rooms.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve travelled to Cazic Thule for a change of pace, and while it offers<br/>
some variety the trains are deadly. After I hit 25 I&#39;ll move to Unrest for<br/>
a look, and possibly even Mistmoore. Solusek&#39;s Eye and Najena are also<br/>
possibilities, if you have the means to sneak past the dark elf guards.<br/>
