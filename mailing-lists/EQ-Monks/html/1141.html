<div id="ygrps-yiv-1416491770"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;This is the same company that changed our version of Feign Death without any<br/>
&gt;&gt;input from the people who play the game.  Why are they suddenly asking for<br/>
&gt;&gt;opinions?  I say it should be changed, if just to level the playing field.  I<br/>
&gt;&gt;guess this goes to prove thast if you play a popular class you get special<br/>
&gt;&gt;benefits, but if you are the minority you get walked all over. Oh, well all<br/>
&gt;&gt;the<br/>
&gt;&gt;Necros will scream that it would be unfair to take away this unbalancing &quot;bug&quot;<br/>
&gt;&gt;and we will still get stuck with our nerfed FD.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Or maybe it is a company who is trying to change the way they deal with<br/>
&gt;customers?  Sometimes I wish you guys would just make up your mind.<br/>
&gt;You say you want more input into the game.  Then they ask for your opinion<br/>
&gt;and you complain about that. Sheesh.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have to agree with you on this one.  They ahould have done it in the<br/>
first place but didn&#39;t.  We blasted them.  Now they are on the improve<br/>
- Your negotiation skill has improved (2) - and we blast them.  I&#39;m<br/>
willing to give them credit for doing things the right way.  Of course<br/>
I have shelved Borix at lvl 31 in favor of my Enchanter (lvl 30, Sparx<br/>
Dreamreaver) so it&#39;s easy for me to forgive and forget.</div>
