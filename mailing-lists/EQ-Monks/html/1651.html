<div><font face="Arial" size="2">The Shackle of Bronze quest can be done in your 
high 20&#39;s low 30&#39;s with a group I&#39;d say.&nbsp; Mostly for safety, and the pieces 
in Permafrost and Frontier Mountains, the rest is foraging and an easy 
quest.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">The Shackle of Steel in your low to mid 40&#39;s with a

  have killed dorn many times, and have never seen anything like this.&nbsp; I 
  do<br>know that he drops a BOOK that can be sold to merchants for about 8pp. 
  I<br>don&#39;t believe Dorn has anything to do LORE wise with the iksar monks, so 
  I<br>don&#39;t believe what is rumored around out there.&nbsp; However, the 
  shackle of<br>clay can be multiquested, as I created another monk, with the 
  sole purpose<br>of testing this idea.&nbsp; The early shackles are iksar only, 
  but I believe that<br>the Shackle of Bronze and above can be worn by humans 
  also, I will confirm<br>this once I jump in game.&nbsp; Since I have shackle 
  of Bronze.&nbsp; If anyone has<br>the Shackle of Steel already, could you 
  confirm who can use it, and while<br>your at it, please post the full stats on 
  shackle of steel please.<br><br>If someone is going to do the shackle quests, 
  and they have not finished all<br>needed factions, but are going to use 
  illlusions or wolf&nbsp; form I suggest<br>gathering all the items upto the 
  shackle of Copper and getting the box for<br>shackle of Bronze.&nbsp; the 
  actual shackle is givin out by Master Rinmark in<br>Timourous Deep.&nbsp; and 
  he initiates the shackle of Steel aswell.<br><br><br>P.S.<br>since the 
  original poster did not mention the lvl of his monk I did not<br>bother to 
  post anything, I know of many quests, but I am not gonna post all<br>of them 
  from lvl&#39;s 1 - 60 , so please specify your lvl, and server if you<br>read 
  this, and maybe I&#39;ll send some quests to keep you busy.<br><br><br>Indicus
