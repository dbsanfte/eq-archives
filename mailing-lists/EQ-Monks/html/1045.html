I made friends with anyone I could, heh. Actually, a cleric is awesome, too,<br/>
at that point because they&#39;re still viable meelee types at that point, and<br/>
the healing just can&#39;t be beat.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, finding a free cleric or shaman is another matter all together.<br/>
My advice would be to find a cleric and start killing aviaks in Lake Rathe<br/>
(one of the more interesting zones in the game).<br/>
