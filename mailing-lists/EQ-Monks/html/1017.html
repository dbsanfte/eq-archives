<div id="ygrps-yiv-437716640">Who has killed Phin since he has been buffed?  But still,<br/>
PCs win simply because of numbers and tactics.  Unfortunately,<br/>
numbers will not always win because of hardware constraints<br/>
and tactics are systematically being made illegal by Verant.<br/>
Basically this game will come down to pushing a button or 2<br/>
every few seconds without the need for thinking.<br/>

And yet, somehow, PC&#39;s always win. Always. There is not a single mob in the<br/>
game that players haven&#39;t beaten or will beat very soon. Not one.<br/>
<br/>
Just because you can&#39;t do it solo doesn&#39;t mean the game is unbalanced. If<br/>
you could solo Vox, teaming up with just one other person would make the<br/>
game completely boring.<br/>
<br/>
Do mobs have, in a roleplaying sense, unfair advantages? Sure. So what?<br/>
PC&#39;s beat them anyway. Verant has had to make mobs tougher, in fact,<br/>
because players were besting them too easily.</div>
