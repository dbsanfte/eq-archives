<div id="ygrps-yiv-422535151">I am a level 8 monk on the Xegony server and I need some guidance, I have been level 8 for what seems like an eternity and I have a LOT of trouble killing most things that con as an even fight.  I would like some guidance and some tips for some better ways to get to level 17 faster from a higher level monk, and possibly if  one is on the Xegony server is willing to help me in game, i will be very grateful.<br/>
