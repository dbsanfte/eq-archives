&gt;&gt;This is the same company that changed our version of Feign Death without any<br/>

&gt;&gt;opinions?  I say it should be changed, if just to level the playing<br/>

&gt;Or maybe it is a company who is trying to change the way they deal with<br/>

open to begin with.  They shouldn&#39;t change certain things without some<br/>
intial discussion with those that are playing.<br/>
