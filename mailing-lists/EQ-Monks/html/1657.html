<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Hi !<br>I have done at the weekend the Freeport 
faction. Now i can move nearly safely trough all Freeport. Sure i have to avoid 
the caster guild and the paladins LOL</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">But now i have a problem. I am dubious to the Ashen 
Order (the Monks) and when sneaking indiff. I collected 60 times the stuff for 
the white sash quest to increase faction with them, so that i can train mz 
skills in Freeport too.<br>I got wolfform from a friend and was indiff to them 
(no increasing when sneaking) and handed two deathfist scalps, one bone chip and 
one snake fang (the scalps not stacked) and all i recieve as answer was <br>&quot;i 
will not support anything like you&quot; (or something like that, cant remeber 
exact)<br>How can i increase mz faction with them instead of camping more and 
more orcs. I have read it should work with wolfform and the white sash 
quest.<br>If you could please help me or give me some advice i would really 
appreciate that</font></div>
