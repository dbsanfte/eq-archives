<div id="ygrps-yiv-1337838331">I am guess I am guilty of leting myself get dragged into teh TWINKING<br/>
debate.  Emotions sometimse run high and I wanted to defend my point of<br/>
view taht Twinking is a personal choice regaurdless of wether you yourself<br/>
support twinking or not.  <br/>
Anyway,  I agree the twinking debate has gotten old so I will IGNORE any<br/>
further posts on the subject no matter how they irritate me.<br/>
<br/>
P.S. 500p is a reasonable amount to have SAVED up by level 18, but making<br/>
500p IN ONE DAY at level 19 is amazing, he may not wnat to give away his<br/>
secret, but what ever he is doing to make that kind of money I would like <br/>
to know... <br/>

&gt; &gt;I didn&#39;t sign up to hear people bitch and moan about twinking and spell<br/>
&gt; &gt;nerfing.  While I&#39;m not positive, I would think that most of you didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt;sign up to hear about it either.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here, here.  If I wanted to hear whining and ranting, I&#39;d go read EQVault <br/>
&gt; message boards.    I liked the stories, questions and roleplaying stuff I <br/>
&gt; heard when I first joined the list.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway, does anyone think the new silk armor is pretty cool for low-mid <br/>
&gt; level monks?  Sure, it makes woven outdated, but it definitely makes <br/>
&gt; tailoring a viable trade skill again.    I hope someday it ends up being <br/>
&gt; like jewelry is now.   Ah, it only took verant six months to add the <br/>
&gt; remaining tailor patterns.   Maybe smiths will be able to craft other armor <br/>
&gt; and weapons next!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Oh, and on the subject of what is an appropriate amount of money for a level <br/>
&gt; 19 monk (someone posted they had 500pp at that level):  I had 200pp saved up <br/>
&gt; at level 18, and I really didn&#39;t try to make money.   Certain areas <br/>
&gt; (gargoyle isle, beholder) are very very profitable.   Had I been trying to <br/>
&gt; amass wealth, I could have easily had 500pp by now.<br/>
