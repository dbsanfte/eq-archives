<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-724216270">even in outdoor zones, I find that if I pull, the group stays safe.<br/>
<br/>
examples.  pulling dark elf guards in nek.  I pulled 2 blue guards near<br/>
the zone, turned around to make sure no one followed.  well, there was a<br/>
dragoon.  not the kind of thing our party wanted to be messing with.<br/>
<br/>
fd, wait for them to run off, then zone.  start over.  party safe.<br/>
<br/>
fighing undead knolls in ek.  all the time people pull way to many. the<br/>
seem to spawn in the path of the pull, plus the spirit stalkers always<br/>
decided to join the fray.  our ranger was pulling, and grabed about 10<br/>
mobs off the hill.  after that mess, I did the pulling.<br/>
<br/>
as for splitting the mobs up.  it has only worked successfully for me in<br/>
crushbone.  but I havent played in many dungeons since reaching 17. even<br/>
greenie dervs come running right back when you stand up.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; 1. Monk (best puller in the game bar none)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;sorry ..... ranger is better outdoors - camo, harmony<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;and track.  outdoors includes Cazic thule, unrest and<br/>

&gt; Actually Druids with wolf form make better pullers <br/>
&gt; than rangers in those zones.  But let&#39;s be honest, <br/>
&gt; there&#39;s nothing particularly difficult about those <br/>
&gt; zones and pulling there. (Except MM which is a <br/>
&gt; rather poorly designed zone IMO.)  And a monk is <br/>
&gt; dang near as good with FD pulling as the druid/ranger<br/>
&gt; there.  So we have what 3ish dungeons where a monk <br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t the best puller, by a very small amount?  <br/>
&gt; And let see: Perma, sol a, sol b, upper guk, lower <br/>
&gt; guk where druid/ranger can&#39;t pull for squat?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yes monk&#39;s are the best pullers bar none.  Ask any <br/>
&gt; group of 35+s whether they want a monk pulling in <br/>
&gt; sol b or lower guk or anyone else? :)<br/>
