<div id="ygrps-yiv-973133810">You are on the right track. Phido spawns anywhere from every 5 to every 15<br/>
Ren spawns. It is a long and frustrating camp, especially if you waited too<br/>
long like I did and get almost no experience from killing those foul beasts.<br/>
It took me a total of 8 - 9 hours last Saturday to get 2 Dareb heads (I had<br/>
a monk friend with me who needed all 3). I recommend that you do this in<br/>
stages if you are like me and hate camping. Spend a day getting Dareb&#39;s<br/>
head, then come back in a week or so and spend a day getting Shen&#39;s head.<br/>
Ghanex is a regular spawn as far as I can tell, or at least he has been<br/>
there every single time I felt like killing him =)<br/>
<br/>
I also recommend for anyone 12-16 or 17 and interested in good exp and good<br/>
loot to basically live in Paw. I sent a lvl 14 Bard friend there last night<br/>
and he grouped with the 1 other person in the place and gained half a level<br/>
and made 10pp in about 3 hours. And that is before selling the tunics and<br/>
masks he got.<br/>

&gt; Hello, brothers and sisters...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just spent a long, frustrating night in Paw trying to get the head of<br/>
&gt; Dareb.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve heard you get this item from High Shaman Phido, who is a rare spawn,<br/>
&gt; who shows up in place of Shaman Ren&#39;Rexx on occasion. Well, I killed<br/>
&gt; Ren&#39;Rex<br/>
&gt; so many times I started feeling sorry for him &lt;g&gt;.  Does anyone know who<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; get the head of Dareb? After questing for the headband items for weeks, I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t feel bad about a spoiler at this point &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
