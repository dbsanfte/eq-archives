&gt;and if a friend offered me serpentine bracers and an exe hood i wouldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;take em.  I don&#39;t need em at my level and when I get to the appropriate<br/>
&gt;level i want to go camp for them....it&#39;s how the game was meant to be<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh that&#39;s a good line.  &quot;I want to go camp for them&#39;&#39;.  and how do you justify<br/>
that in roleplaying terms.  I know for me, the less camping i do the more<br/>
fun the game is for me.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;played and until they change the whole camping system I will continue to<br/>
&gt;play it in that fashion.  Twinkers like you already screwed the<br/>
&gt;PoF.....whats next....Lower Guk...permafrost.....<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t believe that the plane of fear was closed due to twinking.  you<br/>
have no<br/>
proof of this, you are just making what happened fit your conclusions.  I did<br/>
see a post earlier on the list regarding a reason that was attributed to<br/>
someone<br/>
from Verant which i would tend to believe much more.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;you&#39;re just a bunch of jerks who don&#39;t give a shit about the rest of the<br/>
&gt;people that play the game....so I can&#39;t wait until you get to 50th level<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ah, why do these discussions always turn into namecalling and swearing?<br/>
Why can&#39;t anyone have a rational discussion about these game issues without<br/>
saying i am right, you are wrong, and if you don&#39;t agree with me you are a<br/>
*^$&^%&(%$%#%*&%$.  I don&#39;t expect a response to this question since<br/>
you have already dropped down to this level of discussion, of course.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;and leave the game cause you have nothing else to do.  maybe you can then<br/>
&gt;go back to UO or whatever jerkoff game you played before you came and<br/>
&gt;wrecked this one.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>To me, I enjoy exploring new areas of the world that I haven&#39;t seen before.<br/>
 If I am <br/>
level 50 and have all kinds of cool stuff, that won&#39;t stop that<br/>
exploration.  Heck<br/>
maybe i will create a new &lt;fill in class here&gt; and twink the heck out of<br/>
him/her,<br/>
bwahahahahaha.  For some of us the items are just a tool to be able to do<br/>
other <br/>
things.  Obviously to you, the items are the end all be all of the game.<br/>
Seems more<br/>
like a power gamer&#39;s viewpoint rather than a role player&#39;s viewpoint to me.<br/>
