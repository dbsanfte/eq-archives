Well, before the dawn of computer about 20 years ago, practically every<br/>
game out there invovled social contact.  A few exceptions like<br/>
&quot;solitaire&quot;...  Computers came along and let us play games<br/>
completely by ourselves.  But we for the most part find most of these<br/>
games not nearly as fun as games with other people..  Thus games<br/>
like DOOM and Warcraft II and Diablo, now UO and EQ and AC let us<br/>
again have social contact.<br/>
<br/>
If your friends suddenly do not allow you into your group because you are<br/>
not quite as powerful as before, then maybe you should look<br/>
at that friendship and see if thats what it is.  Not too many<br/>
of the people I call friends online give a hoot about my game power.<br/>
Just like I always invite Joe, the worlds worst golf player to go<br/>
with us to play golf, real friends shouldn&#39;t care if you walked up<br/>
and said flying kick was removed, you should still be immediately<br/>
grouped.<br/>
<br/>
Now the monk isn&#39;t suddenly instantly accepted into the group.  Well<br/>
guess what, neither are bards (pre level 32).  Neither are wizards <br/>
(unless you&#39;re going to hate), neither are warriors, neither are ...<br/>
<br/>
From the way you talk, monks are social rejects now because feign death<br/>
isn&#39;t as powerful, and that just isn&#39;t so.<br/>
<br/>
Yes it is more difficult, as you are not as useful, but every class<br/>
has their power tuned (nerfed or enhanced) occasionally, and if you<br/>
can&#39;t cpe with these kinds of changes, then I suggest you stop<br/>
playing EQ and join chat rooms to meet friends.  Verant can&#39;t put your<br/>
ability to make friends easily above the need to balance the game.<br/>

&gt; Hrmmm...no, if you give it more of a bit of intropection, that&#39;s not really<br/>
&gt; true.  It&#39;s a different type of game than say, Heroes of Might and Magic,<br/>
&gt; where this statement would be valid.  This type of game has a twist to it -<br/>
&gt; the human social element.  That, I think, more than anything else is what<br/>
&gt; elevates it beyond a game to many.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Humans are social creatures as a species.  We, as a species, have a deep and<br/>
&gt; abiding need to interact with others.  In this way is how it (and any<br/>
&gt; MMORPG) transcends being &quot;just a game&quot;.  It doesn&#39;t have anything to do with<br/>
&gt; the code or the virtual mobs that you virtually slay, but rather the people<br/>
&gt; beyond the icons with whom you will tend to build real relationships - often<br/>
&gt; without realizing it.  Whether it&#39;s with your drinking buddies in a bar<br/>
&gt; watching the game, going out dancing with your girlfriends, or sitting in<br/>
&gt; the king room in Sol B, killing kobold and role-playing/BSing about your job<br/>
&gt; in the down time, makes no difference.  Social interaction is still social<br/>
&gt; interaction, regardless of the arena it takes place in.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If I had to speculate, I&#39;d say that the changes to feign death, or perhaps<br/>
&gt; more accurately now, non-monks perceptions of monks due to the changes in<br/>
&gt; feign death, negatively impact the ability of monks to continue to explore<br/>
&gt; the social aspect of the game, i.e., difficulty getting into groups of<br/>
&gt; strangers, thus not being able to share in a group activity and make new<br/>
&gt; friends, etc., that is the most damaging aspect of what has transpired and<br/>
&gt; the core root of the anger and outrage many monks express.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just my thoughts...take them for that and nothing more.<br/>

&gt; &gt; It should not be more than a game.  Because that is ALL it is, a game.<br/>
&gt; &gt; If its more to you, then you seriously need to stop &quot;playing&quot; it,<br/>
&gt; &gt; readjust your life, realize how little those bytes stored on <br/>
&gt; &gt; a computer<br/>
&gt; &gt; in california really should mean to you.<br/>
