<div id="ygrps-yiv-1044887815">Hi, I have been receiving a lot of emails recently from people asking me<br/>
where to get stuff and how to do such and such. I do not have time to answer<br/>
all 50 msg&#39;s i get from people each day. That is what the lists are for.<br/>
There is also a fairly large ggroup of people who think (dont know what<br/>
they&#39;re thinkin actually), that EQ-*****<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:-owner@onelist.com">-owner@onelist.com</a> is the address of<br/>
the mailing list.. well it isn&#39;t; those messages get sent to me only, and<br/>
they are deleted and not answered. Only email me if you have a problem with<br/>
sending or receiving mail from the list or soemthing like that, nothing to<br/>
do with where to get &#39;blah&#39;. Thanks a lot.<br/>
