<div id="ygrps-yiv-1022952313"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Same problem with the second group here that I saw <br/>
&gt;before...Who does the damage?  Yes, the monk does <br/>
&gt;fairly good melee, the warrior is average/above <br/>
&gt;average.  Enchanter CAN do good, but then he&#39;s not <br/>
&gt;doing what enchanters do best.  Cleric Shaman Druid<br/>
&gt;all spend a majority of their time healing/buffing.  <br/>
&gt;No big damage.  Fights last forever.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>With the enchanter there you&#39;re usually only fighting<br/>
one mob at a time.  Fights do last longer but <br/>
with less downtime you are *much* safer moving <br/>
through a dungeon.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;The Wizzie group spends more &quot;down time&quot; sure, but <br/>
&gt;that&#39;s only because the fights last 10 or 20 <br/>
&gt;seconds.  Not 2 or 3 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Like I said the wizzie group is fine in a room with <br/>
a tent pitched...other than that you nuke some junk <br/>
in the hall everyone plops down to med and the <br/>
group dies when a roamer walks by.  I&#39;ve seen it <br/>
happen time and again.<br/>
