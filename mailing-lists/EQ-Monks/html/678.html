<b>Subject:</b> Verant Solution to Twinking <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-122993404">All Verant needs to do is make the items they don&#39;t want<br/>
twinked/camped/sold on e-bay/etc. NO DROP items and the problem goes<br/>
away. Verant has made many items NO DROP already and has chosen to leave<br/>
others alone, only making them LORE ITEMS so you may only have 1 in your<br/>
possession. Obviously Verant feels it should be okay to camp/twink/sell<br/>
on e-bay certain items or they would apply the NO DROP tag to them also.<br/>
Before you flame away let me tell you I don&#39;t twink/camp/buy items on<br/>
e-bay, to me that&#39;s not roleplaying fun. I only have one character in<br/>
EQ, my Monk. But after several years of UO I&#39;ve learned that not<br/>
everyones idea of fun is the same as mine. At least EQ allows me to play<br/>
the way I want without others ruining my fun too much. Yes there are<br/>
kill stealers out there, but pulling a train and FD&#39;ing at their feet<br/>
helps stop that. As for the serious twinkers? Their characters will<br/>
suffer in the long run. The easier they level the harder/longer it will<br/>
be before their skills are maxed. If the only way people can enjoy the<br/>
game is to start out with Superman, as long as he stays off my toes,<br/>
it&#39;s their nickel......<br/>
