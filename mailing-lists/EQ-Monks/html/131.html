<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I am new to this list so I don&#39;t know if you guys have discussed this<br/>
&gt; before. I am looking for Mesh armor, but I don&#39;t want to travel to Guk<br/>
&gt; to get it. What is a good town to buy it in, and what is the normal<br/>
&gt; price I should expect to pay. Thanks in Advance<br/>

I have but a netted veil and gloves, and that&#39;s it for<br/>
mesh/woven/netted stuff.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t want to go to guk, you are probably best served by<br/>
Freeport which is the closest *major* human-friendly town to<br/>
Innothule, Guk, et. al.<br/>
