<div id="ygrps-yiv-458519383">A monk only weapon, now before someone say but out fists are our weapons<br/>
listen for a sec.  Wouldn&#39;t it be cool if there were magic gloves with<br/>
effects?  I personally would love to wield a pair of gloves that cast an<br/>
effect, like life tap or shock of frost.  There are just not enough Monk<br/>
only stuff out there, other then the PoF stuff and the sashes and head bands<br/>
I think this would be a nice addition, maybe along with a nifty looking robe<br/>
for monks.<br/>
