<div id="ygrps-yiv-1150774042">I am suprised it hasn&#39;t started already. I just wanted to share with you my Post nerf FD experimentaion.<br/>
<br/>
Sol A green Flame goblins. the goblins I was experimenting with were on the floor near the passage to where the Foreman spawns.  I succesfully feigned them at this point. they returned to thier spawn points . I stood up they immediatly came back.  so I feign again they return to thier points I get up and run all the way to the small bridge type thing near the sol b spawn point. I fd again.  I was several mins stand up wait a few and here they come a running at me. I fd again let them walk away. get up and they come back.<br/>
<br/>
A fellow monk on my server experimented in Lguk with some Dar Undead frogs and had similar results even after 5 mins of feign time.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
any other people doing experimentation out there?<br/>
