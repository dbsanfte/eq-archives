<div id="ygrps-yiv-1960439489">If the only reason you and your brother talk to each other is because you<br/>
are both in EQ than you have a serious relationship problem. You could chat<br/>
in e-mail or ICQ but you say you dont have the time. For your own brother?<br/>
Yet you go ingame and use it like a chat room, doing nothing but sending<br/>
messages back and forth. You can&#39;t tell me you are in Sol B fighting<br/>
whatever while you chat with him. I&#39;ve tried carrying on conversations while<br/>
fighting and it doesn&#39;t work real well. So you sit in game and chat but you<br/>
have no time to sit out of game and chat. With your own family..... That<br/>
doesnt make EQ more than a game, just a game with a chat feature......<br/>

&gt; Hmm....well it may be just a game but you know...its more than JUST a<br/>
&gt; game to some people.  It is the only way that I can keep in touch with<br/>
&gt; my brother for instance...he is never at home and doesn&#39;t ever call me<br/>
&gt; and I don&#39;t have long distance on my phone.  Somehow though, we seem to<br/>
&gt; get together in the game and talk about things.  Before EQ we rarely<br/>
&gt; talked..maybe twice a year?  tell me does that make EQ just a game?<br/>
&gt; Its something that we can do together...which yeah its a game but then<br/>
&gt; again its not JUST a game.  If those little bytes disappeared in<br/>
&gt; California and we could no longer meet up in EQ then I seriously doubt<br/>
&gt; we would talk very much anymore.  Yeah sure I have the ICQ and email of<br/>
&gt; all the people that I play with and get close to.  But seriously how<br/>
&gt; much is he going to be able to say to me in an email...tell me about<br/>
&gt; all his daily activities everyday...I don&#39;t think so.   How often do<br/>
&gt; you send an email back and forth with someone...chatting about stupid<br/>
&gt; stuff?  I don&#39;t...I don&#39;t have time for that.  But when I sit down to<br/>
&gt; play EQ we have a common goal and spend time working together to<br/>
&gt; accomplish this, which makes us closer...  And I use my brother as an<br/>
&gt; example, but through the game I have met some of the best friends I<br/>
&gt; have ever had. Without EQ, I doubt we would have very much to do with<br/>
&gt; each other at all, let alone that we would have ever met... Anyway...<br/>
&gt; sorry you really touched a sensitive side of me.  If you think that EQ<br/>
&gt; is just a game then you should try finding a nice solo game (yeah go<br/>
&gt; dig out the dusty PSX and sit down for a few hours playing tomb raider)<br/>
&gt; and compare it to EQ and see which one you prefer.  The solo game is<br/>
&gt; JUST a game.  I think you will see the difference between JUST a game<br/>
&gt; and EQ.<br/>

&gt; &gt; If its more to you, then you seriously need to stop &quot;playing&quot; it,<br/>
&gt; &gt; readjust your life, realize how little those bytes stored on a<br/>
&gt; &gt; computer<br/>
&gt; &gt; in california really should mean to you.<br/>
