Well my advice, is conditional on your starting stats, and the tyoe of group you<br/>
usually play with.<br/>
<br/>
If you are a &quot;tank&quot; for your group (as you get higher and higher in level this<br/>
will become less and less viable) then a combo of errolisi and Vox might be<br/>
preferred to a serp/errolisi combo.  The Errolisi will boost your damage output,<br/>
which will help you do more damge on ALL of your attacks (especially flying<br/>
kick) while the Vox provides just plain great AC at low wieght.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
However if your base AGI is lower than 110, I would personally look after this<br/>
stat first.  AGI below 110 is (for my personal taste) unacceptable for a monk. <br/>
<br/>
I am lucky enough to have a weightless bag whereby I walk around with a second<br/>
set of equipment I switch into when I want to turn myslef into a &quot;Human DOT&quot;.<br/>
For specific group situations and specialized circumstances various equipment<br/>
has advantages over others.  <br/>
<br/>
Generally speaking though, never let your AGI stay below 110, AC beats str - Str<br/>
is easily buffed by the druid, shaman or bard in your group.<br/>
<br/>
So if your agi is below 110, consider using one of those serpentine bracers. <br/>
Otherwise I recomend a combo errolisi - Vox bracer on each arm.<br/>
<br/>
Depending on your characters stats, and your own playing style there are valid<br/>
arguments to adjust this.  Its up to you. This is just my recomendation.  If you<br/>
are wondering what I use: hero bracer - serp combo.. and I am looking for a Vox <br/>
to replace my serp.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Actually it&#39;s the 3ac from the earrings that&#39;s the important bit.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; take 3ac over 4str any time.  And these earrings will only cost you<br/>
&gt; 1/3 of the cost of electrum sapphire earrings.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Personally I would prefer the +4str +2int earrings over the disease<br/>
&gt; &gt;resistances... diseases aren&#39;t that big of a deal<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hmmm... a wise comment... perhaps I will look into that.<br/>
<br/>
While they are rarer and MUCH more expensive, I would recomend people<br/>
also look into Obsidian Bead Hoops, I have a pair in bank, 2ac +3 AGI<br/>
+3INT, ends up giving you 6ac on ears because of the AGI.  I might start<br/>
wearing them especially when I get my Bracer of Erollisi<br/>
