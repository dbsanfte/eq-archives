<div id="ygrps-yiv-1038805807">I have seen a few people gentlely reminding me that EQ is  &#39;just a<br/>
game&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking for myself when I was still playing, I was passionate about<br/>
it.  I was deadly serious about making Borix the best player<br/>
(regardless of equipment) that he could be.  Probably why I felt<br/>
personally hurt by them nerf.<br/>
<br/>
Damn, that sounds pathetic.<br/>
