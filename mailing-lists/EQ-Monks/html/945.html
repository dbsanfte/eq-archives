<div id="ygrps-yiv-376367556">I haven&#39;t gone online in a few weeks - but what?  When did this happen?  I<br/>
don&#39;t remember them saying any of this in the eqnews - If this is the case,<br/>
some of the monks wonderful versatility has been greatly reduced.<br/>

I am suprised it hasn&#39;t started already. I just wanted to share with you my<br/>
Post nerf FD experimentaion.<br/>
 <br/>
Sol A green Flame goblins. the goblins I was experimenting with were on the<br/>
floor near the passage to where the Foreman spawns.  I succesfully feigned<br/>
them at this point. they returned to thier spawn points . I stood up they<br/>
immediatly came back.  so I feign again they return to thier points I get up<br/>
and run all the way to the small bridge type thing near the sol b spawn<br/>
point. I fd again.  I was several mins stand up wait a few and here they<br/>
come a running at me. I fd again let them walk away. get up and they come<br/>
back.<br/>
 <br/>
A fellow monk on my server experimented in Lguk with some Dar Undead frogs<br/>
and had similar results even after 5 mins of feign time.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
any other people doing experimentation out there?<br/>
