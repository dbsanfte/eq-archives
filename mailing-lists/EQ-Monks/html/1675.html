<div id="ygrps-yiv-2011563385">Mend is a skill you have to practice (unlike a pallys Lay on Hands), just<br/>
like fighting skills such as one handed blunt. Keep using it and the skill<br/>
will rise, once your skill goes over about 100 you won&#39;t see anymore<br/>
critical failures, they actually reduce your hit points instead of healing<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
depending on your play style it can be very easy or quite hard to raise, if<br/>
you solo and use it as your main way of healing at lower levels it should<br/>
raise quite fast. if you group it can be harder to raise as its easy to fall<br/>
into the cleric heals me I&#39;ll save mend for an emergency.<br/>
<br/>
i would use it whenever you can until it hits 100, a death at lower levels<br/>
because of a failed mend is nothing compared to a death at higher level<br/>
because you never trained the skill.<br/>
