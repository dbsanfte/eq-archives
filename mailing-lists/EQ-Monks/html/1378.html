You don&#39;t need to do the quest in Kerra Isle. It is just another way to<br/>
raise faction. But it may have an important impact so do it if you can. I<br/>
know people who got the bracer without doing it.<br/>
Remember that just amiably is not enough. You need to be high amiably to<br/>
succeed.<br/>

Mino hero is level 40ish. you will need a full group of 35s to take him down<br/>
(<br/>
you and 5 level 35-40 friends). A level 39 necro could take him down solo<br/>
with<br/>
some difficulty.  Depending on the server you play on he could be camped and<br/>
so<br/>
you might want to bring a good NUKE along to ensure you earn the kill.<br/>
<br/>
The first thing to do is raise qeynos warrior guild faction.  Wiat let me<br/>
take<br/>
that back... the first thing to do is go to www.gameznet.com and print out<br/>
the<br/>
walk through for the quest.  You have to do a silly quest to kerra isle<br/>
before<br/>
you can get the hero bracer quest, and you have to con amiable before you<br/>
can<br/>
get any quests at all.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly one trick you wil want to know is *how do I make the mino hero<br/>
spawn?*<br/>
Well rumor has it that if you kill minos and skeleton by the skelie camp he<br/>
will<br/>
spawn in a matter of minutes (people have gotten 2 spawns an hour with this<br/>
method). <br/>
<br/>
Take the shakle off the mino + faction with the warrior guild + complete the<br/>
first &quot;runaway gladiator&quot; quest, and you will get one hero bracers 9ac, 10<br/>
str,<br/>
5 poison, 5 disease.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck</div>
