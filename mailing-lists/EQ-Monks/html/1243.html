<b>Subject:</b> Gelatenous cube in running eye? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-611469411">Hi all I ned help.  I am trying to complete the TREATN fist quest. I have<br/>
all the ingredients except the cat skull cap form the gelatenous cube in<br/>
Running Eye.<br/>
<br/>
I am trying to find the exact location of the gelatenous cube in running<br/>
eye. If anyone here has any ideas as to whre it is (in relation to the<br/>
throne room an the captain spawn) please provide DETAILED explanation.<br/>
Everyone tells  me behind the throne room but I just  spent all night<br/>
killing everything I could find behind the throne room and I managed to kill<br/>
two captains in the time that no cube has shown its face.<br/>
<br/>
Ok so as I enter the King  I face a door that leeads to the room where the<br/>
captain spawns ( one of the elite guards is the captains place holder)  Now<br/>
does the cube spawn in this &quot;captain room&quot; or  in the hall behind the door<br/>
in the back of this &quot;captain room&quot;?  Or is he even farther back?<br/>
<br/>
If I am rambling excuse me but I just spent allnight on this damned quest<br/>
with no results... very frustrating....</div>
