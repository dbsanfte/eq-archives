<div id="ygrps-yiv-1426509590">Easy.  If you&#39;re getting hit, it won&#39;t work.  If you&#39;re being cast upon, it<br/>
won&#39;t work.  So you have to either put some distance between yourself and<br/>
what&#39;s whackin&#39; ya, or time it between spell casts.  In my experience, if a<br/>
baddie casts a DOT on me, I will never fool them.<br/>
<br/>
Plus you have the baddies that will remember you, and come back after you<br/>
after you pop back up.  SG&#39;s and Harriers and stuff.<br/>

I just got the skill, and used all my practices to max it. Now i was <br/>
wondering if anyone has any tips as hhow to make it work more reliably, and<br/>
a <br/>
list of the types of (or individual) mobs that can see through it.</div>
