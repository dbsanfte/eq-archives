<div id="ygrps-yiv-299743629">I may not be quite as high as you, but I do have friends that are lvls 47, 49 <br/>
and 50 monks and a lvl 50 magician.  Monk BY FAR outdamage any other melee <br/>
class.  My lvl 50 magician has an earth elemental pet, and nobody can come <br/>
close to outdamaging it other than a lvl 50 monk.  The reason we don&#39;t make <br/>
great tanks is one, hit points.  We don&#39;t get nearly as many as warrriors, <br/>
but our AC is fairly close if we choose to wear AC type armor.  I myself <br/>
don&#39;t, I choose to go with stat increasing items, dex and agl.  Right now at <br/>
lvl 40, I can outdamage any other melee class with very decent equipment.  I <br/>
can hardly wait to get my sash and up past 45, I&#39;ve seen what my friends can <br/>
do and it is amazing.<br/>
