&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well after a week in fear, I got 1 bracer, 2 gloves, 2 arms, 2 legs.<br/>
&gt; Most of the time I was the only monk in fear (or even close to fear) so<br/>
&gt; I got to loot whatever dropped, and I got doubles when the corpses were<br/>
&gt; going to &quot;poof&quot;. I got most of it in the first night. The last 2 nights<br/>
&gt; 1 bracer dropped and I let the other monk who was there have it. In the<br/>
&gt; times I missed, I heard of 2 jerkins and 1 pair of boots dropping.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Only 1 bracer, a jerkin and boots to go. And infact I only want the<br/>
&gt; boots.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; How common are the boots usually ? (weren&#39;t very common this last week<br/>
&gt; ;p).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What parts drop off of chests in hate ?<br/>
&gt; Do the boots drop off phobos ?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
