<div id="ygrps-yiv-1758472819">Well, it seems that Verant may have done it - without warning <br/>
or notice apparently.<br/>
	After logging on to the server last night, I joined my <br/>
regular group and we headed off to Lower Guk to do some froggie <br/>
squishing and exploring of areas that we hadn&#39;t been to before.  On <br/>
our way there, we stopped off at one of our favorite places that <br/>
happened to be open so that we could do some &quot;warming up&quot;.  The group <br/>
consisted of a warrior, a druid, 2 clerics and myself - a monk. <br/>
Being a monk, I went about doing my Feign Pull magic so that we could <br/>
split the mobs we faced.  This is where things started to go wrong.<br/>
	I had heard rumors that FD had been seriously nerfed on the <br/>
test server, but a monk I have on that server was not yet high enough <br/>
to verify this, so I had to put those observations down as just that <br/>
- rumor.  Sadly, it seems that the patch which went in yesterday <br/>
implements this change.  The bottom line is that after some time <br/>
experimenting both with my group and with &#39;faction neutral&#39; observers <br/>
along the pull path we came to the conclusion that FD has been nerfed <br/>
- badly.<br/>
	It seems that any creature which is aggro to you when you <br/>
feign will immediately come screaming back after you once you get up. <br/>
This includes mobs which have returned back to their &#39;home&#39; position <br/>
and even after having waited several minutes.  For any and all <br/>
practical purposes, this kills the ability to feign pull.  As this <br/>
realization came upon us, we were all shocked and somewhat confused. <br/>
We were not aware that this had been a problem which was in need of <br/>
&#39;balancing&#39;.  This goes far beyond nerfing a single class, mind you - <br/>
it is a drastic and very serious change which affects every single <br/>
group which includes a monk of greater than 17th level.  It also <br/>
affects those multi-group arrangements which utilize monks to help <br/>
split mega-mobs (fire giants in Sol B, for example).<br/>
	I am keeping a strong leash on my ranting and raving until I <br/>
can receive some kind of confirmation or contradiction of our <br/>
observations of last night.  Is there anybody out there who can offer <br/>
first-hand information?  Thanks...<br/>
