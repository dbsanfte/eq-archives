<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1502720032">This entire discussion is silly and pointless.  EQ is based on<br/>
a text MUD system that have been around for over 10 years<br/>
now.  In the world of MUDs, there are MUDs that allow twinking<br/>
and ones that don&#39;t.  Verant made the CHOICE when they<br/>
designed EQ to allow twinking, as they chose not to implement<br/>
any of the well-known ways of stopping twinking.<br/>
<br/>
This was a conscious, design-level decision.  This will not be<br/>
reversed any time in the future.  So any arguments you are<br/>
making as to why twinking should not be allowed are fruitless<br/>
in terms of changing the game.<br/>
<br/>
Then your arguments must be &quot;moral&quot; ones- &quot;why you should<br/>
not twink your characters even though you can&quot;.  And, well,<br/>
moral arguments are not easily solved.<br/>
