<b>Subject:</b> which stat? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1641174612">I appeal to the wisdom of the group once again. I&#39;m a 15th level monk<br/>
starting to assemble a nice set of armor, but I&#39;m a bit naive when it comes<br/>
to jewelry. Which stat is more valuable to raise with jewelry, DEX or AGI?<br/>
<br/>
I know agility affects hit points, and the earings I picked up are +2 AGI<br/>
and that&#39;s great. But I also got a +2 AGI ring, and I was wondering if I<br/>
should use it to replace one of my trusty Derv rings which are +2 dexterity.<br/>
<br/>
Which affects attack and defense more, dexterity or agility?<br/>
<br/>
