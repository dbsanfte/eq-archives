<div id="ygrps-yiv-604325511">Another way to raise faction with the Steel Warriors is to complete the<br/>
Strongbear bracer quest.  After you&#39;ve turned in your hundreds of gnoll<br/>
teeth and still find yourself with not enough faction, hail Ebon<br/>
Strongbear who is at the top of the warriors guild in Qeynos by the<br/>
Captain of the guards.  If you have enough faction (not sure what you<br/>
need exactly) he will give you a bag and tell you to fill it up with bat<br/>
wings and other assorted newbie loot.  Give him the bag combined with<br/>
all the items and you recieve a Strongbear Bracer and a nice faction<br/>
boost.<br/>
