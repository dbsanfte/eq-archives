<b>Subject:</b> Re: Verant Solution to Twinking <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-599200549">Making all items NO DROP will not solve the problem.  Last week, I was down <br/>
in LG, helping ppl in my group get a guise of the deciever.  When we first <br/>
zoned in we noticed there was a lvl 11 troll warrior down there with other <br/>
ppl from a certain guild.  Turns out they are twinking him a mask.  Well, I <br/>
nor my group would have anything to do with this so we walked in and took the <br/>
room in the temple.  Because they had the lvl 11, they couldn&#39;t camp the <br/>
room, or at least hadn&#39;t gotten to it yet, so were forced to pull from the <br/>
bridge.  Needless to say it rather pissed them off.  We said we would give <br/>
them the first mask IF it was for one of them, but it wasn&#39;t and they kept <br/>
bitching about how we stole their camp.  Guilds got involved, a person quit <br/>
their guild for camping NO DROP items to twink.  Point of the story is, you <br/>
can still twink ppl with NO DROP items.  Only think I can think of to change <br/>
it is to put lvl limits on items.<br/>
