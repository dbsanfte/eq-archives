<div id="ygrps-yiv-186970282">Excellent.  I had never heard that Scowls, Ready to Attack Faction could be<br/>
upped.  It is the general consensus on the enchanter community ( most<br/>
faction conscience people in Norrath) that it could not, and that was the<br/>
data I was working under.   Too sweet, thanks.  ( hope yet for some places I<br/>
screwed)</div>
