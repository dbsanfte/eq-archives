&gt; Who has killed Phin since he has been buffed?  But still,<br/>
&gt; PCs win simply because of numbers and tactics.  Unfortunately,<br/>
&gt; numbers will not always win because of hardware constraints<br/>
&gt; and tactics are systematically being made illegal by Verant.<br/>
&gt; Basically this game will come down to pushing a button or 2<br/>
&gt; every few seconds without the need for thinking.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
    Exactly, this was my point.  Thanks for making it clear.  EQ is<br/>
gradually going downhill, the economy is getting saturated, Verant is making<br/>
intelligence and ingenuity less and less possible.  Not my kind of game<br/>
anymore.<br/>
