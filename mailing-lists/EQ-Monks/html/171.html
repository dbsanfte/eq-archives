<b>Subject:</b> another monk armor question <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1813642694">I&#39;m a freeport lvl 10 monk, and my entire armor constists of netted<br/>
gloves, and my guild tunic.  I was thinking about heading down to the<br/>
outside of guk to buy some mesh off of the people hunting there.<br/>
<br/>
how much can I expect to pay for peices of mesh?<br/>
<br/>
thanks</div>
