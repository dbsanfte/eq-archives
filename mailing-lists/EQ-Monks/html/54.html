<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-776346883">it is very useful.  once your skill gets to 80+ you will rarely fail.  the key<br/>
is stop attacking and run away for 1-5 secs and then feign :)  your mileage<br/>
will vary and you will start to get a feeling for it soon enough.  beware or<br/>
casters, if they have already started casting on you don&#39;t feign.  wait until<br/>
the spell hits you and then feign (because if they hit you they know you aren&#39;t<br/>
dead) :)<br/>
<br/>
hope this helps, took me many deaths and a long time to learn the above<br/>
lessons...  good luck!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Has anyone ever found the feign death skill to be actually useful in getting <br/>
&gt; creatures that are attacking you to stop? I have been practicing non-stop <br/>
&gt; since I got the skill and it is now at 50, but fighting crocodiles and <br/>
&gt; caiman, not once has feigning death, whether i fell to the ground or not, <br/>
&gt; stopped them from biting me. Is there something about the use of the skill <br/>
&gt; that I am missing or is it just not that useful?<br/>
