I know I am repeating myself (contantly too : ), but try the gargoyles in the<br/>
Ocean of Tears. Just across the first stop--sister island--from Freeport in<br/>
OoT<br/>
is the goblin island. To the immediate right of that island as you are facing<br/>
it is an undead island featuring spectres that you can easily avoid, greater<br/>
skeletons that you will have to kill in abundance, and gargoyles. You can hunt<br/>
them to level 25, and they yeild the best loot since wisps. Gargoyle eyes sell<br/>
at inns for about 9pp, and they are stackable, so hunt to your hearts content<br/>
and save the eyes until you are ready to return to Freeport. You will want to<br/>
take along plenty of bandages and insure that you have mend, bind wound, and<br/>
feign maxed for your level before taking these gargoyles on as they can be<br/>
quite dangerous. Good luck. I can not advise you beyond that because after my<br/>
gargoyle exploits, I have hunted almost exclusively in groups.<br/>
