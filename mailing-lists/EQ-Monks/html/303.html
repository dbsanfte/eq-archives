<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-741405190">I get bound in grobb.  If you bind just inside the zone, you can use<br/>
sneak to get out if you hug the right wall and go behind the 2 bashers<br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
Occasionally basher Sutok will be just inside the zone line, which can<br/>
be a pain.  But as long as you can take 1 or 2 hits, you&#39;ll last the 4<br/>
seconds needed to back out of the zone after you appear.<br/>

&gt; Adventuring in Guk was recently mentioned in the 7th Level Qeynos<br/>
&gt; Blues,<br/>
&gt; and that reminded me of a question I have been meaning to ask.  Where<br/>
&gt; is<br/>
&gt; the nearest place to get bound for adventuring in Guk for a Monk (of<br/>
&gt; course)?  Freeport?  North Ro -&gt; Oasis of Marr -&gt; South Ro -&gt; Innotule<br/>
&gt; Swamp -&gt; Guk = Not fun.  Anything closer?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
