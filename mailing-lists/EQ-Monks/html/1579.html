<p><font SIZE="2">&gt;One thing I have noticed about EQ melee classes is that none of them are</font>
<br><font SIZE="2">&gt;dependant on anything besides strength, and as a monk, you want str at your</font>
<br><font SIZE="2">&gt;level because odds are you are not the tank. I made the mistake of putting</font>
<br><font SIZE="2">&gt;all my points into agility, and buying all agi stuff, i am level 20, but am</font>
<br><font SIZE="2">&gt;probably stopping the character because he has a massive disadvantage to</font>
<br><font SIZE="2">&gt;everyone else.</font>
</p>
<br>

<p><font SIZE="2">Bah!&nbsp; I put all my points into Agil and did all my gear based on agil because it was the theory of the week.&nbsp; Massive Disadvantage?&nbsp; Now STR is the theory of the week.&nbsp; My monk is now level 40 and I don&#39;t see any big differences between me and the other monks who went all str.&nbsp; Sure now I&#39;m putting some STR gear on, but leaning heavily towards AC and MR.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="2">Besides, at level 20 you&#39;ve *just* gotten your STR attack bonus - how would you even notice?&nbsp;&nbsp; What &quot;Massive Disadvantage&quot; could you have possibly uncovered?&nbsp; Face it, As much as Verant would like us to believe stats are worthwhile, I think in their addiction to &quot;Balancing&quot; the classes they don&#39;t really mean squat.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="2">Just play your character and have fun.&nbsp; </font>
