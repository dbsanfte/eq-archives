<div id="ygrps-yiv-1538763164">One correction - Iksar CAN raise faction to good from Scowls.  I know<br/>
because I got my Troll SK who worships Innoruuk (the absolutely most hated<br/>
combo) to kindly with the vendors in Qeynos and amiable ot the guards.  It<br/>
can be done and just takes a lot of patience.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; FOR THE LEARNING IMPAIRED:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; EVERYONE has a level cap on swimming.  On Iksar, you get 100<br/>
&gt; as the base,<br/>
&gt; rather than 0 as the base as with every other race on Norrath.  The<br/>
&gt; Progression remains the same, 5 for ever level.  Meaning a<br/>
&gt; Level 5 human can<br/>
&gt; reach 25 swimming skill, BUT a level 5 iksar can reach 125 skill.<br/>
&gt; The only skills without level caps are the trade skills<br/>
&gt; (Fishing has a cap<br/>
&gt; though).<br/>
&gt; Humans get no XP bonus, general consensus is that Error in<br/>
&gt; coding gave bonus<br/>
&gt; to Halflings.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Iksar have massive disadvantages to counter their strengths.<br/>
&gt; 	Trolls have a 15% RACIAL XP penalty.  The previous quoter was<br/>
&gt; mistaken.  25% is the penalty for troll (15%) and Shadowknight (10%)<br/>
&gt; 	Iksar have a 20% Racial.<br/>
&gt; 	An error allowed the Iksar to be non KOS is a few places... This<br/>
&gt; error was changed on 4/28.  Iksar are now KOS to everything,<br/>
&gt; even vendors.<br/>
&gt; I am not sure if this is Threateningly or true Scowls KOS.<br/>
&gt; If it is Scowls,<br/>
&gt; then there is no way for them to increase that faction.  As<br/>
&gt; it is now, there<br/>
&gt; is only one zone in Antonica that Iksar can be bound, Arena.<br/>
&gt; Only one in<br/>
&gt; Feydwer, G. Feydark.  And unless something new has been<br/>
&gt; found, Kunark has<br/>
&gt; only one, Cabilis ( actually more than one zone, but the difference is<br/>
&gt; negligible ).<br/>
&gt; 	Iksar monks lose most of the Natural Haste of Human Monks.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Iksar will be powerful monks, and powerful in any class save<br/>
&gt; SK (smaller<br/>
&gt; size only advantage, but countered with lack of slam/front<br/>
&gt; stunable), but<br/>
&gt; Iksar will not be replacing any of the other races, even Iksar monks. </span></blockquote></div>
