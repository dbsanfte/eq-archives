<div id="ygrps-yiv-1150073266">Well it&#39;s not a targetted effect, so there is probably a check to see if<br/>
you performed<br/>
the skill, and then a check to see whether each monster in the immediate area<br/>
is fooled.<br/>

&gt;Here is a question along these lines...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;While hunting in Unrest, I contracted rabies during a fight. A moment later,<br/>
&gt;a Hag came around the corner and cast on our paladin. I FD successfully and<br/>
&gt;everyone else runs, with the Hag in pursuit. The MoB I was fighting however,<br/>
&gt;the non-casting mummy that had given me the rabies, continued to beat on me.<br/>
&gt;I stood up, just me and the Mummy now, FD successfully again, and end up<br/>
&gt;getting killed by the mummy. My question is twofold... 1) Is rabies<br/>
&gt;considered a DoT? I know it says &quot;You resist the weak disease spell&quot; or<br/>
&gt;something similar, but actually thought that was a bug since the mummy does<br/>
&gt;not cast any spells. 2) If we a re hit by a DoT, does that nullify the use<br/>
&gt;of FD? I ask this because since a previous spell is affecting us, does the<br/>
&gt;cast then know that we are not dead?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thoughts?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Praelor<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;btw... I contacted a guide about this and was told &quot;Sometimes monsters just<br/>
&gt;aren&#39;t fooled by feign death, even if you are successful&quot;.  Excuse me, but<br/>
&gt;if they aren&#39;t fooled, exactly HOW are we successful??<br/>
