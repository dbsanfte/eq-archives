<br/>
EVERYONE has a level cap on swimming.  On Iksar, you get 100 as the base,<br/>
rather than 0 as the base as with every other race on Norrath.  The<br/>
Progression remains the same, 5 for ever level.  Meaning a Level 5 human can<br/>
reach 25 swimming skill, BUT a level 5 iksar can reach 125 skill.<br/>
The only skills without level caps are the trade skills (Fishing has a cap<br/>
though).<br/>
Humans get no XP bonus, general consensus is that Error in coding gave bonus<br/>
to Halflings.<br/>
<br/>
Iksar have massive disadvantages to counter their strengths.<br/>
	Trolls have a 15% RACIAL XP penalty.  The previous quoter was<br/>
mistaken.  25% is the penalty for troll (15%) and Shadowknight (10%)<br/>
	Iksar have a 20% Racial.<br/>
	An error allowed the Iksar to be non KOS is a few places... This<br/>
error was changed on 4/28.  Iksar are now KOS to everything, even vendors.<br/>
I am not sure if this is Threateningly or true Scowls KOS.  If it is Scowls,<br/>
then there is no way for them to increase that faction.  As it is now, there<br/>
is only one zone in Antonica that Iksar can be bound, Arena.  Only one in<br/>
Feydwer, G. Feydark.  And unless something new has been found, Kunark has<br/>
only one, Cabilis ( actually more than one zone, but the difference is<br/>
negligible ).<br/>
	Iksar monks lose most of the Natural Haste of Human Monks.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Iksar will be powerful monks, and powerful in any class save SK (smaller<br/>
size only advantage, but countered with lack of slam/front stunable), but<br/>
Iksar will not be replacing any of the other races, even Iksar monks.</div>
