But here is what we must do.<br/>\nWe<br/>\n&gt; all have to band together and Feedback the hell out of them. I mean if a<br/>\nMob<br/>\n&gt; goes all the way back to its resting place but then can come after us and<br/>\n&gt; kill us what kind of BS is that. Besides from 300 yards away behind walls<br/>\n&gt; and door and deep below where we feigned death how would anything let<br/>\nalone<br/>\n&gt; a mob know that we got up. Very suspect if you ask me. So all of us need<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; Feedback the hell out of varent. If you don&#39;t think it will work all I<br/>\nhave<br/>\n&gt; to say is look back to when they nerfed the Box of Abu Kar.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Heldenfeld<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: Lance Cummins &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:landrewc@...\">landrewc@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, November 16, 1999 12:42 PM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EQ-Monks] Somebody PLEASE tell me I&#39;m wrong<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Lance Cummins &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:landrewc@...\">landrewc@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; You are not wrong.
