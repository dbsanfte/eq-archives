I have<br/>\nmaxed out the skill at 17th level.  This is not an exaggeration.  Yesterday<br/>\nI was soloing scarecrows in West Karana.  I was earning a little Xp and<br/>\npracticing my newly aquired FD skill, which did work,  I used mend 4 times<br/>\nin about a 2 hour period of time.  It worked once, failed twice, and<br/>\nworsened my wounds the last time, which killed me when I had a white<br/>\nscarecrow on its last legs.  My character basically committed suicide at<br/>\nthe point where he was going to win.  As I said, it seems I have the worse<br/>\nluck with Mend.  Does any one else have this problem or am I just the<br/>\nvictim of bad numbers?<br/>\n<br/>\nShando, 17th circle, Silent Fist Clan<br/>\nBertoxxulous</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
