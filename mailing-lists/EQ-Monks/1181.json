Reason one is so your cleric<br/>\n&gt; (if you are in a party) doesn&#39;t waste mana on you.  I always tell my <br/>\n&gt; clerics, only pop a heal my way if I drop below 3 bubbles.  That way<br/>\n&gt; I can use my mend without the fear of the cleric casting a heal on me<br/>\n&gt; and one of us wasting either.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Second main reason, specially when soloing, is that if you use it at the <br/>\n&gt; beginning of a big combat (ie when you first reach about 2 bubbles<br/>\n&gt; down) then you will have that mend button pop up a little bit more<br/>\n&gt; quicker for the next combat, rather than probably having to go the<br/>\n&gt; next combat without it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Shelza, Karana<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;RaceFace&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bean@...\">bean@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Subject: Re: [EQ-Monks] Mend, my most useless and irritating skill.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Date: Sat, 15 Jan 2000 15:04:25 -0600<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;It seems to me that the chances of it failing are a LOT higher if you use<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Mend and you are at 50% health or lower.  I&#39;m level 24 and my skill is only<br/>\n&gt; &gt;90 (never bothered practicing it when sitting in town babbling with people,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I&#39;m going to have to start now. :)).  If I use it when I only have 2 <br/>\n&gt; &gt;bubbles<br/>\n&gt; &gt;of health gone, it seems to work almost all the time.  I can only recall it<br/>\n&gt; &gt;failing twice, in recent memory, and only worsening my wounds once.  I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;always try and use it when I&#39;ve lost 2 bubbles.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;-Raean Bloodyhands, 24th fist, Tunare.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: James W Hooper &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhooper@...\">jhooper@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Of the monks that I know, it seems that I have the worst luck at getting<br/>\n&gt; &gt;my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mend skill to work, especially in high risk combat situations.  I have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; maxed out the skill at 17th level.  This is not an exaggeration.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Yesterday<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I was soloing scarecrows in West Karana.  I was earning a little Xp and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; practicing my newly aquired FD skill, which did work,  I used mend 4 <br/>\n&gt; &gt;times<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in about a 2 hour period of time.  It worked once, failed twice, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; worsened my wounds the last time, which killed me when I had a white<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; scarecrow on its last legs.  My character basically committed suicide at<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the point where he was going to win.  As I said, it seems I have the <br/>\n&gt; &gt;worse<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; luck with Mend.  Does any one else have this problem or am I just the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; victim of bad numbers?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Shando, 17th circle, Silent Fist Clan<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bertoxxulous<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Get great offers on top-notch products that match your interests!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sign up for eLerts at:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/elerts1\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/elerts1</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ______________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;     GRAB THE GATOR!
