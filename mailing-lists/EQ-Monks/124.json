I hunt with an enchanter mostly, and having a<br/>\nranged attack to pull critters is wonderful. It doesnt really matter if you<br/>\nadvance the skill or not, as even if you miss, the critter still gets peeved<br/>\nthat you tried to hit it and comes runnin after you. So as a tool, throwing<br/>\nis great. Just dont expect to do any damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nPraelor<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\tJay Watamaniuk [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wertou@...\">wertou@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tSaturday, July 03, 1999 6:41 AM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject:\tRe: [EQ-Monks] Skills<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Jay Watamaniuk &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wertou@...\">wertou@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Do NOT spend points on offensive anything. They will develope fast enough<br/>\n&gt; in <br/>\n&gt; combat. Save them for later. Put one or two practices into a new skill and<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; then leave it. for example your next big skill is Sneak just put one or<br/>\n&gt; two <br/>\n&gt; and then practice it just by itself.<br/>\n&gt; I would not worry about learning throwing. In my opinion it doesn&#39;t do a <br/>\n&gt; whole lot.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Jitte- 9th Level, Bristlebane<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Having difficulty getting &quot;in synch&quot; with list members? <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Try ONElist&#39;s Shared Calendar to organize events, meetings and more!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
