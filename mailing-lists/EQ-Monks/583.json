On any given<br/>\nday a level 20 to go to lavastorm, kill rock dervishes for a couple hours<br/>\nand make 100pp easy, while gaining no experience.  Money is NOT a difficult<br/>\nthing to come by if that&#39;s what your going after.  Heck, just kill a bunch<br/>\nof wisps and grab all the lightstones and sell them to the merchants and<br/>\nyou&#39;ll still make a killing.  Plus who knows, maybe the guy is a blacksmith<br/>\nand made his money that way.  It&#39;s not at all unreasonable to have thousands<br/>\nof pp as a monk at level 22 to spend on things, because we don&#39;t exactly<br/>\nhave a very expensive profession.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Seamus McNeill &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:smcneill@...\">smcneill@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, September 14, 1999 11:23 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ-Monks] Digest Number 66<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Seamus McNeill &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:smcneill@...\">smcneill@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; i don&#39;t be caring how *hic* much you hunted mammoths.

Full suit of rubi/carnal armor.<br/>\n&gt; Purity Belt, Dark Reaver, BP Choker, Plantinum Silver Ruby Veil, Dwarven<br/>\n&gt; Work Boots and a White Wolf Hide Cloak.  Whats the fun at that<br/>\n&gt; point...when everything you want for your character you already have.<br/>\n&gt; There is just no point.
