If you are making it","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-279301070\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt; Hail Fellow Monks<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am a tailor of a good deal of experience and was<br/>\n&gt; hoping that someone could answer a question for me.  I<br/>\n&gt; hunt in East Commonlands and therefore tailoring is a<br/>\n&gt; simple skill to use because pelts are so common.<br/>\n&gt; However, Patchwork has become too easy for me and I<br/>\n&gt; have done some research into Studded Leather.  As most<br/>\n&gt; of you know, making studded armor requires studs.  I<br/>\n&gt; do not wish to take the time to make studs because<br/>\n&gt; what I like most about tailoring is I do not have to<br/>\n&gt; spend time doing it, I just kill animals and use their<br/>\n&gt; pelts.   Does anyone know if it is possible to buy<br/>\n&gt; studs, or anyone on the Karana Server near Freeport<br/>\n&gt; who sells them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you are pursuing making studded armor because of the satisfaction of<br/>\nhaving made your armor yourself I wish you good fortune.  If you are making<br/>\nit because you want either to upgrade your armor or plan on selling it I am<br/>\nafraid you will most likely be disappointed.  Studded armor unfortunately is<br/>\nfar to difficult to make for the amount of protection it provides.  For the<br/>\nstuds you must find a talented blacksmith willing to make them for you.  If<br/>\nyou can find one they will most likely be priced at 1PP each.  If you can<br/>\nfind someone to make them for you I recommend spending all you can to get as<br/>\nmany studs as possible.   Because of the difficulty of studded armor you<br/>\nwill go though many, many studs on your way a suit of armor.  Also, the<br/>\ntailoring skill seems to improve very slowly after you have reached an<br/>\nability of 26.  The other problem is that studded armor does not provide as<br/>\ngood protection as other types of armor you could find on the corpses of<br/>\ncertain creatures in Norrath.  But as I stated at the beginning, if you are<br/>\nable to make and wear a full suit of studded the self satisfaction could be<br/>\nwell worth all other obstacles.<br/>\n<br/>\n--------<br/>\nMark<br/>\n<br/>\nFor great simple at home income opportunities check these out:<br/>\n1.
