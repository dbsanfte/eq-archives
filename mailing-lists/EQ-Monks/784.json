He will be taking the brunt of the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;damage while the Enchanter does Crowd Control. They will stay on the Bard<br/>\n&gt; &gt;because he is the one that pulled them and because those Songs piss Mobs<br/>\n&gt; &gt;off. If the Wizards use /assist they will be taking out what the Bard has<br/>\n&gt; &gt;targeted. Enchanter will use Mesmerization for AoE Crowd Control and there<br/>\n&gt; &gt;should only be 1 fighting at a time. You are quite mistaken about this<br/>\n&gt; &gt;group. This is the MOST powerful group that you can have. There is no other<br/>\n&gt; &gt;group that will do more damage in a shorter amount of time. It is not right<br/>\n&gt; &gt;for every situation, but it is the best for most situations.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This still seems iffy to me, especially if you pull more than two mobs, and<br/>\n&gt; they get lucky around of resisting....<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I wouldn&#39;t feel comfortable without a dedicated melee class to start bash&#39;n<br/>\n&gt; and distract&#39;n.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Stonedorn<br/>\n&gt; Cunnan&#39;s Brewing Co.<br/>\n&gt; Xegoney<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
