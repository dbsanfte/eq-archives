The trick to keep from dying is to get SOW cast on you by a <br/>\nfriendly Shaman (at least 9th level) or Druid (at least 14th level).  This <br/>\nwill let you outrun the monsters if you get in trouble.  Make sure you have <br/>\nmagic (netted/woven/mesh) gloves.  The key to getting SOW is to offer a <br/>\ndonation every time you get it.  3-5 gold is probably good and they <br/>\nshouldn&#39;t mind too much.  You should be able to make good money with the <br/>\nlightstones from Wisps as well.  Also, kill any orc pawns and skeles you <br/>\nsee for loot and sell any weapons at the inn by the guards so they don&#39;t <br/>\nslow you down.<br/>\n<br/>\nKogar, 13th Level Barbarian Shaman, Bristlebane<br/>\nFolnoth, 13th Level Human Monk, Bristlebane<br/>\nJason<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom:\tJesse Pink [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:maerjyon@...\">maerjyon@...</a>]<br/>\nSent:\tWednesday, June 30, 1999 2:03 AM<br/>\nTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject:\t[EQ-Monks] Ok, Here&#39;s another, then.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been playing my monk since the first week the game was released.   My <br/>\nplayed time is now about 4 day, 6 hours.  Is this about right for a lvl 11 <br/>\nguy?  What are your played times for your lvl 32 monk?  I&#39;m just interested <br/>\nin knowning if I&#39;m behind the curve here.  I just dont have the patience to <br/>\nget to lvl 17!  It is frustrating.  Right now I&#39;m in Befallen, as a lvl 11. <br/>\n Is there a more appropriate place that I should go perhaps?  Right now I&#39;m <br/>\nnot worried about RPing too much, because I die way too much, so I guess <br/>\nthat means I just want to lvl ASAP.  Where&#39;s a good place to get EXP at my <br/>\nlevel?
