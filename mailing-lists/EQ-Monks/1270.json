Grabbed a pair<br/>\nof jagged bands.  I switched from drake hide leggings to gator scale: 7 AC! best<br/>\nmonk legs in the game.  (I camped the ancient croc for about 7 hours one day and<br/>\ngot em  myself - made 2kpp  selling the gator amrs in the process!)<br/>\n<br/>\nSerp bracers were replaced first with an erolisi and a vox and then with a Hero<br/>\nbracer and a vox bracer.  I HIGHLY recommend the hero bracer despite its weight<br/>\nit has Awsome AC and looks super cool with the black treant fists equiped.<br/>\n<br/>\nI took off that exec hood and switched to a Crown of forglock kings -  12 just<br/>\nrocks.  <br/>\n<br/>\nCaveat:<br/>\nWith all these changes I did notice mobs were hitting me for a lot less. <br/>\nHowever duel wiel in particular was rising slowly (dex increase melee skill<br/>\nlearning rates) SO what I do now is after each level play for an hour  our two<br/>\nin &quot;dex gear&quot; to max out my skills quickly then switch back to the AC/STR gear<br/>\nwhen I am done.  I maxed out equipment I can get my dex to 145 and agi to 139. <br/>\nWith stats like those I learn  SUPER fast ( like I say I am usually maxed all my<br/>\nmelee skills within an hour of levelling) then its back to the old AC/STR gear<br/>\nfor the real tough fights.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: James [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wsjames@...\">wsjames@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, January 31, 2000 10:31 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [EQ-Monks] Monk Creation / Stats<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;James&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wsjames@...\">wsjames@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, folks, we all recently heard *with disappointment* about verant<br/>\nemployees posting about DEX and AGI - they seem to be a lot less important<br/>\nthan we hoped for.  In light of this new information - what do all you monks<br/>\nout there see as the most important stats for a monk, now? How would you<br/>\nfocus your items (ie STR? AC? HPS? AGI? DEX? STA?)? And how would you<br/>\ndistribute your starting points?  Maybe a few could name some equipment that<br/>\nbacks up their opinions.<br/>\nThanks in advance for everyone&#39;s input =)<br/>\n<br/>\nKyeric<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nFREE ADVICE FROM REAL PEOPLE!
