If a warrior and monk go toe-to-toe at high <br/>\nlevels, who would win?  The monk does more damage than warriors to <br/>\nmonsters, but if a monster is attacking the monk, they go down much faster <br/>\nthan warriors.  Warriors are just hard to hit with all of their armor.  A <br/>\n30th level warrior can have three things attacking him and barely go down <br/>\nthrough a fight, but a monk would be dead if he had even two on him.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom:\tKen Morris [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kmorris2@...\">kmorris2@...</a>]<br/>\nSent:\tTuesday, June 29, 1999 11:00 AM<br/>\nTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject:\tRe: [EQ-Monks] Warrior Petition?<br/>\n<br/>\nLOL, you are a relatively young monk, my friend ;)  When you get to the <br/>\nhigher lvls, we smoke the warriors, hands down.  They cannot equal the dmg <br/>\nthat we monks can do.  Please don&#39;t underestimate Feign Death either.  I <br/>\nknow of a 48th lvl monk who has only died twice between 32 and 48th lvl. <br/>\n All because of feign death.  No, there is definitely no need to make any <br/>\nchanges to the monk.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe warriors, on the other hand, have every right to be upset.  They are <br/>\nnot the master of melee like they should be.  At the very least, they <br/>\nshould be able to equal the monks in power and they should definitely be <br/>\nable to out-melee a ranger or paladin.  Right now, this is not the case and <br/>\nthat&#39;s why the warriors are up in arms, so to speak.<br/>\n<br/>\nThaladar, 32th  lvl Monk<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n  From: Jesse Pink<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, June 29, 1999 10:37 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [EQ-Monks] Warrior Petition?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      What I want to know is what is with this warrior petition.  Granted <br/>\nmaybe the warrior class is not really any better than the paladin class in <br/>\nmelee (and it is, IMHO), but why should warriors get another big boost over <br/>\nthe already humbled monk?  Despite the fact that we get feign death <br/>\neventually, our armor class and atttack does not usually equal that of a <br/>\nwarrior, which is alright now, but if they get another boost, where is this <br/>\ngoing to leave the monk.  I for one am against the warrior update, unless <br/>\nthe make a minimal change to the monk class.  I&#39;m not asking for much, I&#39;m <br/>\njust asking for something that by making the warrior &quot;king of melee&quot; that <br/>\nthey just not leave the monks in the dust.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Maerjyon, 11th Rank monk, E&#39;ci<br/>\n &lt;&lt; File: ATT00004.htm &gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
