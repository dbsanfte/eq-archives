Any help<br/>\n&gt; would be great appreciated.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; 1. I know that will less weight we have a higher AC.  But where is the<br/>\n&gt; balance of weigh and armor.  Am I better off with all Leather because of<br/>\n&gt; its higher AC or and I better off with all cloth because of its lower<br/>\n&gt; weight?<br/>\n&gt;   [Praelor]  When starting off, a mixture of leather or patchwork and<br/>\n&gt; cloth is best, with the maximum weight being 14. At the early levels, up<br/>\n&gt; until about 8 or so, staying under this limit isn&#39;t nearly as important as<br/>\n&gt; it is at higher levels. Eventually, you will want to acquire netted,<br/>\n&gt; woven, and mesh, as these have magical properties and a weight of 0.1 to<br/>\n&gt; 0.4 depending on the piece. These can be found in the Qeynos Sewers<br/>\n&gt; (netted) and Guk, and are often for sale in East Commonlands and every<br/>\n&gt; zone on the way to Guk. The closer you get to Guk, the lower you can<br/>\n&gt; expect to pay.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; 2.  When I am ready to upgrade armor from either cloth or leather armor,<br/>\n&gt; depending  on the answers I get for number 1, what should I get?  I know<br/>\n&gt; there is netted, mesh, and woven but what is best to get first?  What are<br/>\n&gt; the advantages of each?  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>\t[Praelor]  Mesh is the goal for most low-mid level monks. The<br/>\nLockjaw Tunic (Oasis) has been replaced by the Forman&#39;s Tunic (Unrest) as<br/>\nthe goal for body protection.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   <br/>\n&gt; 3. When I am ready where is the best place to get magic gloves?  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>\t[Praelor]  Personally, I say get them as soon as you can afford<br/>\nthem. I bought a pair of woven gloves in East Commonlands at lvl 6 for 8<br/>\nplat, and I got my mesh gloves at lvl 20 quite by accident in High Keep.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   <br/>\n&gt; 4. When I hit level 17 and get feign death how many points should I put<br/>\n&gt; into it?  Should I just put one and then start it and sit there till it<br/>\n&gt; maxes or won&#39;t that work?  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>\t[Praelor]  This is a toss up with Instill Doubt being available to<br/>\nus now at 18, as ID is EXTREMELY difficult to train yourself. Personally, I<br/>\nwould dump them all in FD as I see that being much more useful than ID. ID<br/>\nlooks great, but even at a skill of 35 and practicing for 4 hours straight<br/>\nlast night, I did not go raise my skill even a single point and was NEVER<br/>\nsuccessful. Feign Death on the other hand, after putting 25 points into it<br/>\nat lvl 17, saved me on the way back to my hunting party that very day.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 5. What am I forgetting about?  What is important for me to remember or<br/>\n&gt; keep held back for later?  Should I save all my practice points for one<br/>\n&gt; thing?  Etc...<br/>\n </span></blockquote>\t[Praelor]  Practice points for a Monk, IMHO, are pretty useless. I<br/>\nusually train 1 in everything that becomes available, from Pottery to 2<br/>\nhanded blunt. Most of the skills we have (except for ID) are easily trained<br/>\nthrough combat, which we have to do anyway. The only one I would recommend<br/>\nkeeping up via training points is Bind Wound. This skill is perhaps the most<br/>\noverlooked skill in the game, but can seriously reduce down time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Thanks<br/>\n&gt; Mark<br/>\n&gt; Blades-By-Reedo<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Amazing $14,000 Opportunity.
