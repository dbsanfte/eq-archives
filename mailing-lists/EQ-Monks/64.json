I therefore expected to be needing two different inventory items.  I\r<br/>\n&gt;asked somebody on-line about this, and he showed me his own Red Sash and\r<br/>\n&gt;told me that the whole wand is what he used.\r<br/>\n&gt;\tCan somebody confirm this for me?  I&#39;m a little (well, a lot) leery\r<br/>\n&gt;of gambling this whole wand as well as my sash (not to mention the\r<br/>\n&gt;still-to-be-obtained saphire) when I turn them in for the Red sash.\r<br/>\n&gt;\tOh yeah, one more thing.  I&#39;ve recently put both my orange sash and\r<br/>\n&gt;orange headband in the bank and wend with mesh articles in their stead.\r<br/>\n&gt;The theory is that the AC (and damage dissipation) they offer more than\r<br/>\n&gt;offsets the small stat bonuses provided by the quest items - not to mention\r<br/>\n&gt;the fact that we can&#39;t even proudly display these thins as we walk around.\r<br/>\n&gt;Is anybody else of this opinion as well?  At what point would the\r<br/>\n&gt;sash/headband properties outweigh mesh&#39;s?\r<br/>\n&gt;\r<br/>\n&gt;--\r<br/>\n&gt;Aaron Braunstein\r<br/>\n&gt;Pacific Data Management, Inc.\r<br/>\n&gt;\r<br/>\n&gt;&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aaron_braunstein@...\">aaron_braunstein@...</a>&gt;\r<br/>\n&gt;\r<br/>\n&gt;\r<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
