I haven&#39;t dueled since lvl 5 and have no<br/>\n&gt;idea what to do to give myself any kind of advantage. He is a bit tweeked<br/>\n&gt;whereas I am not so that will give him even more of an advantage of course,<br/>\n&gt;but I believe I still have a chance......anything anyone can think of that<br/>\n&gt;might help me out?  I would REALLY appreciate any help on this esp. since I<br/>\n&gt;have to work with this guy every day.<br/>\n&gt;  I have a little more of a desire to beat him since he just happens to be <br/>\n&gt;my<br/>\n&gt;supervisor, too!!!    :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I thank you all in advance for your input.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Kaldon of Povar<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
