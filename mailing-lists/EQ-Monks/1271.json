(It took long enough to save up)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing is I don&#39;t have a clue what to buy next? The only better armour I <br/>\nknow of is that Plane of Fear, Shiverback stuff.. At level 12, I think not.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I guess that leaves earrings and rings? What should I go for? I <br/>\ncurrently have no earrings and two +2 dex rings, + 1 AC derv rings..<br/>\n<br/>\nAny suggestions welcomed!<br/>\n<br/>\nPS I have discovered a useful (bug?) Scarab (sand/Giant) carapaces weigh <br/>\n0.0kgs. You can solo these at about level 10, and since the loot doesn&#39;t <br/>\nweigh anything it&#39;s all good!
