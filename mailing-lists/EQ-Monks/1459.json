I put one point in it at 18th (starting me at 18)and <br/>\nhave been hitting it almost constantly, running, waiting, I mean anytime I <br/>\nremember to hit the thing, and I think it just hit 35.  I hear once it hits <br/>\n50, it goes up a bit faster.  If you want to see it work, stand in front of <br/>\na green mob that wont agro on you, and preferably won&#39;t move.  and hit ONLY <br/>\nthe ID key, and just keep hitting it over and over and eventually it will go <br/>\noff on it.  At such a low level, this skill is not going to benifit you in <br/>\ncombat in anyway, for a good while.  Ahh well I know people who have gotten <br/>\nit to the low 100s but I don&#39;t often hear that it is a great help.  Probably <br/>\njust as much of a help as a Spell Thrower&#39;s fear spell.<br/>\n<br/>\nSister Shelza<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Caza Gaming &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MeCaza@...\">MeCaza@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [EQ-Monks] Skills questions<br/>\n&gt;Date: Thu, 16 Mar 2000 16:49:52 -0800 (PST)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My FD works great.. has saved my butt HEAPS.. just<br/>\n&gt;keep practicing like crazy...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Instill doubt.. well, I try to practice and practice..<br/>\n&gt;don&#39;t see it working.. don&#39;t see it improving either<br/>\n&gt;*shrugs hopelessly*  but then I said that with Safe<br/>\n&gt;Fall at early levels too :-))  Now THAT is maxxed<br/>\n&gt;within 5 mins of gaining a new level :-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sneak is very sneaky.. hehe...
