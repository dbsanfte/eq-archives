The problem is that you are saying you take off ARMOR to get <br/>\nthe weight down.  The AC benefit from some armor outweighs the drawbacks <br/>\nfrom weight.  The weight factor becomes more apparent at later levels also. <br/>\n If you notice your AC fluctuating as you loot your enemies, that is the <br/>\nproblem.  Try filling your inventory with swords, staffs and maces you loot <br/>\nfrom MOBs and then sell them all and notice the swing in your AC.<br/>\n<br/>\nJason<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom:\tSteve Hamner [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shamner@...\">shamner@...</a>]<br/>\nSent:\tTuesday, June 15, 1999 10:17 AM<br/>\nTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq-monks@onelist.com\">eq-monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject:\t[EQ-Monks] Pls explain AC<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Steve Hamner&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shamner@...\">shamner@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not sure where anyone got the 15 weight is the best for monks...can<br/>\nsomeone please explain this...My AC does not change when i drop down to or<br/>\nbelow 15, if anything it gets worse as I take my patchwork armor off. I<br/>\ncan&#39;t believe this nonsense about the super low weight unless you are<br/>\ntalking about encumbering weight. I know monks are suppose to use less than<br/>\nothers but I can&#39;t go on a huge hunting spree and not carry something back<br/>\nto sell. Or should I be investing in items instead? Its a little hard to<br/>\ninvest in items on the PVP server since everyone is out to get you hehe.<br/>\nSuggestions for eq would be most appriciated...where to buy cost?
