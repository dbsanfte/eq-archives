That&#39;s boring. I get my enjoyment by Killing mobs. That&#39;s<br/>\nwhat I like to do. Destroy, kill, rape, pillage and plunder. That is what I want<br/>\nto &quot;role-play&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;But someone did ask why Twinking bothered us so much, and I gave an honest<br/>\nanswer without trying to force anyone to conform to my POV.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut others have, repeatedly in pervious posts. They don&#39;t use words like &quot;I<br/>\ndon&#39;t enjoy...&quot; or &quot;I shouldn&#39;t&quot;, they say things like &quot;They shouldn&#39;t...&quot; or<br/>\n&quot;they won&#39;t enjoy their time&quot;. Those words a projections of their thoughts and<br/>\nbeliefs of how others should play. When I saw &quot;I&quot;, I&#39;m referring to those who<br/>\nhave who have items given to them by higher level friends because that&#39;s the<br/>\nonly perspective I can speak for, the perspective I play from.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;anger vibe&quot;<br/>\nI&#39;m annoyed, more than anything at those who constantly rail against the game<br/>\nchoices I make. Let me play my game, you play yours, and quit whining about<br/>\ntwinked characters.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;camping&quot;<br/>\nThere will always be camping as long as valuable item returns to the same<br/>\nlocation. Nothing can be done about that, but sitting in line for 8 hours<br/>\nwaiting for you turn at some Sword of Unholy Ass-Kicking is not my idea of fun.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;If you couldn&#39;t give a crap about ITEMS THAT ARE NOT REAL then why not give me<br/>\nyour Serp Bracers? :)&quot;<br/>\nHeading for the Dark Side Luke? And I thought you were against twinking....<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;And as far as the &quot;Working damn hard&quot; &quot;nice spread&quot; comments you made:  If this<br/>\nis all just some mixed up little insignificant universe that matters nothing to<br/>\nyou - go into the character selection screen, pick your Monk that has all those<br/>\nITEMS THAT ARE NOT REAL, and click &quot;Delete&quot; &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou miss the point. I need those items to do what I want to do in the game. Like<br/>\nI said, I would play the game naked if I could, but I can&#39;t. I can&#39;t play Kane<br/>\nfrom Kung-Fu because the game system is setup where I need those items. Don&#39;t<br/>\nblame me, I didn&#39;t make the rules, Verant did.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the rest of that, its not the items that matter to me, its the<br/>\ninteraction with those players around me that I enjoy, not spending my time<br/>\nhunting down items. I opt out of the loot cycle as often as possible, letting my<br/>\nteammates take the items. If you need those items to focus your group play,<br/>\nperhaps your the one who should (and I quote) &#39;click &quot;Delete&quot;&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvilJohn</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
