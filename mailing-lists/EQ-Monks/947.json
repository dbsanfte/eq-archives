I fd again.<br/>\nI was several mins stand up wait a few and here they come a running at me. I fd<br/>\nagain let them walk away. get up and they come back.<br/>\n<br/>\nA fellow monk on my server experimented in Lguk with some Dar Undead frogs and<br/>\nhad similar results even after 5 mins of feign time.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
