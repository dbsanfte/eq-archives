Clerics and Warriors could possibly do it, but that would be <br/>\nnightmarish. Wizards simply can&#39;t due to the lack of a Pet.<br/>\n<br/>\n         Shadow Knights are really the class that was designed with Soloing <br/>\nin mind. Especially the infamous Troll Shadow Knight. Until Kiting was <br/>\nrestricted though, they were not the best at it. Druids USED to be the best <br/>\nSolo class in the game. Now, it is a toss-up between Shamans, Druids, <br/>\nMonks, Necros, and SKs.<br/>\n<br/>\n         Personally, I would hate to try and Solo my way to 50 as an <br/>\nEnchanter. The Pets we get are weak and Charm is &quot;unstable&quot;. Don&#39;t get me <br/>\nwrong, I love Charm but I like having a nice BIG Warrior right beside me to <br/>\nTaunt the Mob off when Charm breaks.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
