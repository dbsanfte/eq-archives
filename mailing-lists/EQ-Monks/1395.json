It conforms to<br/>\n&gt; my experience.<br/>\n&gt; Only thing I would add is that the 72-80 minte spawn seems to<br/>\n&gt; have a much wider<br/>\n&gt; range than that - sometimes you wont get a double spawn for<br/>\n&gt; more than 2 hours.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>FYI, any spawn in the game can spawn nothing for a spawn cycle.  That is<br/>\nwhat you are seeing.  Some, like the Goblin Alchemist in Permafrost, are<br/>\nmore likely to spawn nothing for a cycle.  I.e. after the 25 min spawn, it<br/>\n*will* spawn, but it is the &quot;nothing&quot; place holder.  It&#39;s *very* annoying to<br/>\nbe sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nAstur il&#39;Ayan, Cleric of Brell<br/>\nSCARAB on Solusek Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
