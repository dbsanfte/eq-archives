I would have to disagree, what<br/>\nmakes us look like monks are the fact that we look like newbies.  I<br/>\npersonally much prefer foreman&#39;s tunic.

Ok, so it looks leather<br/>\nbut who cares.  Once you get to 30 you won&#39;t wear anything that looks<br/>\nlike cured silk.  Thats because there is better stuff out there<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<br/>\nHammeron<br/>\nMonk of Quellious<br/>\nKarana<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nWorlord<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:worlord@...\">worlord@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
