Only problem<br/>\nis we are all new to EQ so have no real ideas as to where to go.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe did try Crocodile hunting in Oasis last night but the spawn rate seemed<br/>\nvery low - certainly too low to support the 45 people in the zone.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone have any suggestions as to where to go?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, what level to we need to be to get Mesh? I have an almost complete set<br/>\nof Woven (obtained by a combination of purchasing and hunting Frogloks and<br/>\nKobolds in Innothule) but have never seen Mesh for sale. I play on The<br/>\nTribunal server, so there arent that many high level characters who hunt in<br/>\nGuk and then sell their stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for weight -- Spirit Pouches! One of the people I regularly group with is<br/>\na Shaman, so when we start I get him to summon me some pouches, fabulous<br/>\nitems!<br/>\n<br/>\nOne last thing -- been browsing the archives, and I see several references<br/>\nto a cross-server Monk guild. Is there such a thing? Is there interest? How<br/>\ndo we go about forming one?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n\tMartin<br/>\n<br/>\n\tNyrkl lvl15 monk on The Tribunal</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
