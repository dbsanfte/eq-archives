Yes we make great<br/>\npullers.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; You can go to Rodcet Nife and anybody I&#39;ve grouped with who they think<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; best puller is.  They will say a monk.  When I pull, there is no<br/>\ndowntime, at<br/>\n&gt; &gt; least for me.  If I&#39;m not fighting a mob, I&#39;m busy pulling one.  I<br/>\nhaven&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; grouped with anybody that can keep the pace like myself.  Another<br/>\nreason, I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; love to dish out the damage.  At lvl 49 my max punch is 53, and kick<br/>\n104,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; without buffs.  The max dmg I&#39;ve done in one round, 4 punches and a<br/>\nkick, was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 224.  And this was to a lvl 45 mob, not some lil green guy.  Another<br/>\nthing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; we&#39;re great at that isn&#39;t so fun is corpse recovery.  I can run into<br/>\nanywhere<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and FD, change views and look for the corpse, if it&#39;s not there, stand,<br/>\nrun,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; FD, look.  Once you get the corpse, drag it where ever is needed.  I was<br/>\non<br/>\n&gt; &gt; PoF alone, running all over dragging corpses to the hill to be ressed<br/>\nwhen we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; brought the cleric in.  Even if a mob aggros you, it will walk off after<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lil bit.  And if they come back when you stand up, you still have time<br/>\nto run<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a ways until they get to you.  In LG, I don&#39;t need invis vs undead to<br/>\nget<br/>\n&gt; &gt; out, or to get into a party already camping something.  Yes, it helps,<br/>\nbut I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t need it, just run, FD, wait, run again.  These are the reasons I<br/>\nlove<br/>\n&gt; &gt; playing a monk.  If you have any questions, or can think of something<br/>\nyou&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; &gt; heard of that I haven&#39;t mentioned, plz ask, and I&#39;ll do my best to fill<br/>\nyou<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Kanja<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Rodcet Nife<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
