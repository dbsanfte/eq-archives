Bottom line is to increase<br/>\nyour stats as much as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich brings me to another question... when will I be able to afford this<br/>\nstuff? At what level do we start being able to get the big kills that earn<br/>\nus hundreds of plat? It&#39;s only recently that I&#39;ve been able to start having<br/>\nabout 50pp in the bank at any time, and paying 35pp for a +5 AGI ring was a<br/>\nmajor investment for me. My main cash cow has been wisp hunting, but the<br/>\nexperience I get killing them has started to diminish a lot. Killing Dervs<br/>\nis still okay, but doesn&#39;t get me much cash unless they have bronze.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love not having to buy expensive armor and weapons all the time, but it&#39;s<br/>\ngetting to the point where I will need lots of cash to buy jewelry, rare<br/>\nitems, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, how much should one pay for serpentine bracers?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd at what level can I realistically hope to get journeyman&#39;s boots?<br/>\n<br/>\n_____________________________<br/>\nMoorgard, monk striving for Virtue<br/>\nPovar</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
