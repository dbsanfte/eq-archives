Because the Monk IS the<br/>\nbest puler in the game Bar none. When was the last time a ranger was asked<br/>\nto pull the ghoul lord or froglock king room? Maybe when a monk wasnt<br/>\navailable. Noone can split up groups of multiple mobs like a monk. Sure a<br/>\nranger can track in a large zone but a Monk can pull outdoors also. when a<br/>\nRanger can pull in all environments just as well as a monk then you will<br/>\nhave a valid argument.<br/>\n<br/>\nKizmet Bayashi<br/>\n40th level monk<br/>\nDa`Kor<br/>\nE-Marr<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Sean O&#39;Brien &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sobrien@...\">sobrien@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, October 07, 1999 11:36 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ-Monks] Re: Lots o Wizard groups<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Sean O&#39;Brien&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sobrien@...\">sobrien@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; David Blank wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 1.
