I felt this same way.  I sat and experimented with<br/>\neverything from encumbered to buck flaming naked and never saw a<br/>\ndifference.  I began to wonder what the deal was with everybody being all<br/>\nobsessed about a monk&#39;s weight when I couldn&#39;t tell the difference to save<br/>\nmy life.<br/>\n\tWell, I don&#39;t know the exact specifics of how it works, but your<br/>\nlevel must be involved somehow.  All I can say is that now ever stone over<br/>\n14 I accumulate causes me to lose an average of 3AC.  Once I saw this, my<br/>\neyes bugged out and I went on a diet to make your average supermodel<br/>\nenvious.  I now leave the bank with about 10 stones on me (including<br/>\nbackpack, rations, etc.) and love life.  I no longer even bother to keep<br/>\ncopper at all.. I just burn it as I get it.  (40 coins of any type = 1<br/>\nstone, BTW.)  With silver, I frequently am reduced to exchanging it with<br/>\ngroup members at a rate of about 115 silver for a plat.  This way they make<br/>\na profit and I get my weight back down.  It&#39;s a good deal all around.<br/>\n\tThe bottom line is that it&#39;s possible your level isn&#39;t high enough<br/>\nwhere you are experiencing the wieght effect (I&#39;m now at 21).  Keep your<br/>\neyes on it to see when it kicks in for you and let us know!<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nAaron Braunstein<br/>\nPacific Data Management, Inc.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aaron_braunstein@...\">aaron_braunstein@...</a>&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
