I haven&#39;t dueled since lvl 5 and have no<br/>\nidea what to do to give myself any kind of advantage. He is a bit tweeked<br/>\nwhereas I am not so that will give him even more of an advantage of course,<br/>\nbut I believe I still have a chance......anything anyone can think of that<br/>\nmight help me out?  I would REALLY appreciate any help on this esp. since I<br/>\nhave to work with this guy every day.<br/>\n I have a little more of a desire to beat him since he just happens to be my<br/>\nsupervisor, too!!!    :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI thank you all in advance for your input.<br/>\n<br/>\nKaldon of Povar</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
