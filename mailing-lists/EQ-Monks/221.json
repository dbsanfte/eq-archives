I was about to give up on scoring <br/>\nsome netted gloves in the Qeynos sewers.   I had a near full suit of netted <br/>\nand still no gloves.   Last night I gave it one more go and finally got my <br/>\ngloves!   Now this may not seem like a big deal to you high level monks, but <br/>\nto a level 11 monk this means I can now fight wisps and ice bone skeletons.  <br/>\nAnd I didn&#39;t have to trek to the Freeport area for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nDornn, Level 11 Monk, Brell Serilis, Wispslayer (it&#39;s official! = )<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Dave Woomer&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dwoomer@...\">dwoomer@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [EQ-Monks] Red Headband Quest<br/>\n&gt;Date: Wed, 18 Aug 1999 15:10:39 -0400<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I decided to give it one more go today. I get to Paw and find the room. I <br/>\n&gt;attack the commander out in front of the shaman&#39;s room and guess who comes <br/>\n&gt;charging out after me? None other than Phido himself. I switch focus to him <br/>\n&gt;and start pounding him, all the while the commander&#39;s taking free shots at <br/>\n&gt;me. I finally manage to kill Phido, but have a bubble of health left. I <br/>\n&gt;feign, wait a minute, loot Phido, collect Dareb&#39;s skull. bind my wounds, <br/>\n&gt;mend, and high tail it to Qeynos. Yes, there will be better headgear, but <br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m kinda proud of my red headband &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Owyn<br/>\n&gt;Test Server<br/>\n&gt;     -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;     From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ScottM@...\">ScottM@...</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ScottM@...\">ScottM@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     Date: Wednesday, August 18, 1999 7:32 AM<br/>\n&gt;     Subject: RE: [EQ-Monks] Red Headband Quest<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     Well after many hours in Paw, I have done this quest.  You just have <br/>\n&gt;to keep killing Ren&#39;Rexx eventually phido does spawn.... The other two <br/>\n&gt;heads come from Ghanex Drah who is a normal spawn, and the third comes from <br/>\n&gt;killing High Shaman Grisok who is a random spawn for Shaman Lenrel...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     I got Ghanex Drah&#39;s head easily, it took around 7 hours <br/>\n&gt;(non-consecitvly) of fighting till I got the other two heads, as a <br/>\n&gt;coincidence both Grisok and Phido spawned at the same time (was killing all <br/>\n&gt;three in a circle)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     Wade<br/>\n&gt;     Solusek Ro<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;     From: Dave Woomer [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dwoomer@...\">dwoomer@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;     Sent: Wednesday, August 18, 1999 5:34 AM<br/>\n&gt;     To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;     Subject: [EQ-Monks] Red Headband Quest<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     From: &quot;Dave Woomer&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dwoomer@...\">dwoomer@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     Hello, brothers and sisters...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     Just spent a long, frustrating night in Paw trying to get the head of <br/>\n&gt;Dareb.<br/>\n&gt;     I&#39;ve heard you get this item from High Shaman Phido, who is a rare <br/>\n&gt;spawn,<br/>\n&gt;     who shows up in place of Shaman Ren&#39;Rexx on occasion. Well, I killed <br/>\n&gt;Ren&#39;Rex<br/>\n&gt;     so many times I started feeling sorry for him &lt;g&gt;.  Does anyone know <br/>\n&gt;who to<br/>\n&gt;     get the head of Dareb?
