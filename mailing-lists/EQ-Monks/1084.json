This was my point.  I have seen a lot of griping that this fd patch makes<br/>\nmonks useless and they won&#39;t be able to find a group, etc.  I know for me, <br/>\npersonally<br/>\ni don&#39;t care and would accept anyone in the group if we needed a person and had<br/>\nan opening.  heck, you probably don&#39;t want to group with the power gamers who<br/>\nwould turn you down just because of that anyway.  Anyway, I just wanted to see<br/>\nif this was empty rhetoric or if there really was a difference in finding a <br/>\ngroup.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I have my answer.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
