I do<br/>\nknow that he drops a BOOK that can be sold to merchants for about 8pp. I<br/>\ndon&#39;t believe Dorn has anything to do LORE wise with the iksar monks, so I<br/>\ndon&#39;t believe what is rumored around out there.  However, the shackle of<br/>\nclay can be multiquested, as I created another monk, with the sole purpose<br/>\nof testing this idea.  The early shackles are iksar only, but I believe that<br/>\nthe Shackle of Bronze and above can be worn by humans also, I will confirm<br/>\nthis once I jump in game.  Since I have shackle of Bronze.  If anyone has<br/>\nthe Shackle of Steel already, could you confirm who can use it, and while<br/>\nyour at it, please post the full stats on shackle of steel please.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone is going to do the shackle quests, and they have not finished all<br/>\nneeded factions, but are going to use illlusions or wolf  form I suggest<br/>\ngathering all the items upto the shackle of Copper and getting the box for<br/>\nshackle of Bronze.  the actual shackle is givin out by Master Rinmark in<br/>\nTimourous Deep.  and he initiates the shackle of Steel aswell.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.<br/>\nsince the original poster did not mention the lvl of his monk I did not<br/>\nbother to post anything, I know of many quests, but I am not gonna post all<br/>\nof them from lvl&#39;s 1 - 60 , so please specify your lvl, and server if you<br/>\nread this, and maybe I&#39;ll send some quests to keep you busy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIndicus Velox<br/>\n35 rank in the SwiftTail Caste<br/>\nSaryrn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI recently got the book.
