I know you can target a corpse<br/>\nand train ID.  I have set up my sidewinder precision pro, using its profiler<br/>\nsoftware, to press #s 1-6 (the skill hotkeys) by just pressing 1 button on<br/>\nthe joystick.  Thing is, I can&#39;t figure out any way to get this button to be<br/>\npressed down over and over (if you hold it down with a rubberband or<br/>\nsimilar, it will work once, but wont keep pressing your hotkeys all night).<br/>\nSidewinder doesnt seem to have auto-fire.  I know that gravis makes a<br/>\njoystick (or is it gamepad?) with autofire but I&#39;d rather not spend a ton of<br/>\nmoney - I already pay 8 bucks a month for this game =P<br/>\n\tHas anyone put some thought into this?  Anyone ever created a<br/>\nbutton-presser?  Let me know what you folks think - I&#39;d rather not spend my<br/>\nwaking hours pressing hotkeys =)<br/>\n<br/>\nKyeric</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
