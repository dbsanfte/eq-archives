Another thoguht is that those<br/>\nbracers come off of a difficult Mob in Lguk. at level 16 you werent<br/>\n&quot;supposed&quot; to have those. Back at level 16 when E-marr was still new and the<br/>\nhighest playes were only in there low 30&#39;s noone had those bracers. People<br/>\non the server didnt even know where they came from. I Think I was wearing<br/>\nwoven still at that point. dont dispair because you dont have level 30<br/>\nequipment at level 16. you will get it eventually.<br/>\n<br/>\nKizmet Bayashi<br/>\nMonk of the 46th ....<br/>\nE-Marr<br/>\nDa`Kor<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Good things come to those monks who wait&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: James W Hooper &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhooper@...\">jhooper@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Monk@onelist.com\">EQ_Monk@onelist.com</a>&gt;; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, December 08, 1999 11:46 AM<br/>\nSubject: [EQ-Monks] General grousing<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: James W Hooper &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhooper@...\">jhooper@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have always thought that monks should be characters of moderation and<br/>\n&gt; poverty.  I have tried to play my character that way.  I have managed to<br/>\n&gt; squrriel away 250 pp.  I figured that would handle most of my expenses for<br/>\n&gt; the foreseeable future.  I buy muffins and water for food and drink.  All<br/>\n&gt; of my magic tiems have been given to me or looted off of drops.  However,<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; have reached an impasse.  Someone last night was auctioning off Serpent<br/>\n&gt; bracers.  When I asked how much, I was shocked to hear 800 pp.  I guess<br/>\n&gt; that I am going to have to break down and loot everything or hope that I<br/>\n&gt; stumble across a raqre drop.  I am not going to be able to afford anything<br/>\n&gt; better if I don&#39;t do so.  I think it is sad, that if I am going to be a<br/>\n&gt; successful adventurer, I am going to have to be like the rest of the money<br/>\n&gt; grubbing classes:  Rogues, Shadow Knights,  Warriors, Druids, Shamans,<br/>\n&gt; Rangers, Bards,  Enchanters, Wizards, Magicians, Necromancers,  holy<br/>\n&gt; Clerics and pious Paladins.  Does anyone else see a problem with this?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Shando, 16th level, Silent Fist Clan<br/>\n&gt; Bertoxxulous<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
