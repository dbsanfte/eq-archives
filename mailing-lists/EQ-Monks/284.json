After 12 hours in<br/>\ne-mails, on the phone, and in /tells with about 6 different folx, it took GM<br/>\nTunso (head GM for Fenin Ro) all of about 10 minutes to fix whatever the<br/>\nproblem was. Here is a run down of what we discovered:<br/>\n<br/>\n1- Since it was happening to any character I tried to pass thru that zone on<br/>\nthe Fenin Ro server, it is not a corrupt character file.<br/>\n2- Since the zone files are not server specific, and I can zone with no<br/>\nproblem on other servers, it is not a corrupt zone file.<br/>\n3- The problem occurred on 2 different systems at my place, each working<br/>\nindependently of the other, so it is not machine specific.<br/>\n4- Removing EQ, re-installing EQ, and downloading all the patches did not<br/>\nresolve the issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll this adds up to 1 probable cause: my connection. I run on a cable modem<br/>\n(Road Runner) and up until the last patch have had absolutely no problems<br/>\nwhatsoever. I have passed through this zone into North Keladim a hundred<br/>\ntimes or more, as I spend alot of time in Unrest and it is the closest bank.<br/>\nTo further the argument, the same problem occurred again last night zoning<br/>\nfrom East Commons to West Commons! I had a trusted guildmate log in as me,<br/>\nand she was able to move Praelor just fine. But here is where the problem<br/>\nis... On the Character selection screen, when I chose Praelor, it gave the<br/>\nlocation as East Commons. When my guildmate logged in, she logged into West<br/>\nCommons.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it appears that it is some kind of connection problem or difficulty<br/>\nbetween my systems and the Fenin Ro servers (perhaps a UUNET incompatibility<br/>\nsomewhere?). I say all this to see if anyone out there more versed than I<br/>\nwith communication issues has any idea of what I can do to prevent this in<br/>\nthe future. I am not running thru a Proxy server nor am I using NAT<br/>\nsoftware. any ideas at all would be appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nPraelor Dileasai<br/>\nLord of Limbo<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\tScott Miller [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ScottM@...\">ScottM@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tFriday, August 20, 1999 2:49 PM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject:\tRE: [EQ-Monks] A warning for Fenin Ro players<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Scott Miller &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ScottM@...\">ScottM@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I had a similar problem with a monk on the Solusek Ro server, but it was<br/>\n&gt; happening in Qeynos, I sent an e-mail to verant and they recommended that<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; delete the files on my pc relating to that zone and the zone you are<br/>\n&gt; currently in, when you next log in they update server will replace the<br/>\n&gt; zone<br/>\n&gt; files and it should correct the problem.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Wade<br/>\n&gt; Solusek Ro<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Robb Flynn [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:RobF@...\">RobF@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Friday, August 20, 1999 12:22 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [EQ-Monks] A warning for Fenin Ro players<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Robb Flynn &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:RobF@...\">RobF@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I write to let you know of a rather upsetting issue that I am faced with<br/>\n&gt; at<br/>\n&gt; the moment. It appears to only be affecting me, but it is severe enough to<br/>\n&gt; bring to your attention as well, I think.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Last night, while zoning from South Keladim into North Keladim (where the<br/>\n&gt; bank is) I crashed. A drag, but nothing all that new. The twist is,<br/>\n&gt; however,<br/>\n&gt; I cannot log my monk, Praelor, back onto the server! I tried re-starting<br/>\n&gt; EQ,<br/>\n&gt; re-connecting my ISP, and re-booting my system, all to no avail. I brought<br/>\n&gt; in a lvl 2 druid and /petitioned, and spent the next 3 hours speaking with<br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt; guide and a gm. The GM said he would reset my character to a point prior<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; the disappearance, but could make no promises on when that would occur. So<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; logged and tried again this morning.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And there he was, right where I had started Last night. Everything<br/>\n&gt; appeared<br/>\n&gt; to be fine. I still needed to go to the bank, however, so off to Keladim I<br/>\n&gt; went, and upon zoning from S. Keladim into N. Keladim again, I crashed.<br/>\n&gt; With<br/>\n&gt; the same results as last night. Well, it was 6:30 am EST, and no GM&#39;S were<br/>\n&gt; online, but I did speak with a guide who promised to forward my problem to<br/>\n&gt; then first GM who showed up, but it would not be for several hours.<br/>\n&gt; Understandable, given that it was 3:30 am in San Diego.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So now, with time to kill before work, I decided to experiment. I created<br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt; Dwarven Cleric and ran him into the zone and promptly crashed. So at least<br/>\n&gt; it is not a corrupt character file with Praelor. I then created a Dwarven<br/>\n&gt; Cleric on The Tribunal server and zoned with no problem. Now I know it is<br/>\n&gt; not a corrupt N. Keladim data file and that it is specific to Fenin Ro. A<br/>\n&gt; few of my guildmates then create characters on Fenin Ro and zone with no<br/>\n&gt; problem, so it is not a server-wide issue.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; All this leads me to believe that it is something specific with the link<br/>\n&gt; between my system and the Fenin Ro servers, but I just wanted to give<br/>\n&gt; everyone a heads up on this &quot;just in case&quot;. I am planning on re-installing<br/>\n&gt; EQ and running all the patches tonight, and will let you know the outcome.<br/>\n&gt; With any luck, that will solve everything and Praelor Dileasai will once<br/>\n&gt; again be running from all those nasty critters in Mistmoore (hehe). If<br/>\n&gt; not... well.. I just don&#39;t really want to think about the &quot;if not&quot;<br/>\n&gt; scenario<br/>\n&gt; yet.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Praelor Dileasai<br/>\n&gt; The Limbo Monk<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Congrats to our GROW TO GIVE winners, ZENtertainment & ROTInews!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Check out ONElist&#39;s latest program, FRIENDS & FAMILY.
