Its not a mana sponge, or a helpless school girl. The monk class at<br/>\nany level does a Great Deal of Damage, and in my opinion more than any other<br/>\nmelee class with the exception of a warrior with Plane of Fear equipment.<br/>\nYour strength lies not with one or two glorious swings for 70 points of<br/>\ndamage, but in four punches for 23, and a flying kick for 52. Your Armor<br/>\nclass is not as high as a warriors, it never will be. Get used to it, but<br/>\nalso get used to Block, Dodge, Block. You hit points are lower, until you<br/>\nfactor in a 25% hit point heal every six minutes, you&#39;re selling yourself<br/>\nshort.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for playing with Twinked characters who out damage you, I must answer to<br/>\nthe positive. I&#39;ve been playing with Ranger and Bard both of which carry top<br/>\nof the line Ykeesha&#39;s and they generally out damage me (then again, they<br/>\ntake the damage then, too and I&#39;m a hell of a lot harder to hit than some<br/>\nranger). The gap is narrowing however, and would be closed if they were not<br/>\nwearing haste sashes. Remember, the higher you level, the less of an<br/>\nadvantage Twinking Gives.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes Verant has changed our most unique skill, it will still save youin tight<br/>\nsituations, however. At least we have it! I&#39;ve used it numerous times to get<br/>\nmyself out of Castle Mistmoore when EVERYONE in my party died, twinks and<br/>\ncasters alike. Indeed, they&#39;ve suggested calling me Stonedorn EscapeArtist.<br/>\nIts harder now, but playing a Monk was never an easy path.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo be honest, I think we&#39;ve passed the meaningful discussion of the class<br/>\nand have entered into &quot;the Grass is Greener&quot; syndrome. If you&#39;re so unhappy<br/>\nwith your Monk, Give It Up and go play a Dark Elf Necro. Please don&#39;t take<br/>\nthe Monk Name in the Realm of Envious Complainers.<br/>\n<br/>\nStonedorn Windrunner<br/>\nCunnan&#39;s Brewing Company<br/>\nXegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
