The game was designed for groups.  Once<br/>\nyou hit a certain level (different for different classes) it&#39;s just almost<br/>\nimpossible<br/>\nto solo.  I know for my bard, he sucked at soloing from about 20-25 in unrest,<br/>\nbut now at 27 i am able to solo blues again, thanks to fear song and chains<br/>\nsong.  (This is the part that will sound nasty, but i really don&#39;t mean it<br/>\nthat way)<br/>\nIf you only have 10 or 15 minutes I would suggest just playing some other<br/>\nnon eq game of which there are many good ones.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 02:24 PM 9/15/1999 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Dave Gaines &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dave@...\">dave@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hi everyone, I&#39;m new to the list, but my monk has hit level 20, and<br/>\n&gt;has decided he has killed enough crocodiles.  I&#39;m looking for some<br/>\n&gt;place that I could solo from level 20-30 and maybe a place that even<br/>\n&gt;gives good monk loot.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Also, what kind of armor should I be looking for?
