How rare is Qwinn ? it took me about 16 hours to get Br Z. more rare<br/>\n? less rare ? good places to try and find him / spot him ? does he have<br/>\nplaceholders ? basically anyone got any low down on him ?<br/>\n2. Is there still a skill check against tailoring ? (I have 0 skill in<br/>\ntailoring or maybe 1)<br/>\nif there is, and it fails will a GM give me either all the items again<br/>\nor the robe ?<br/>\nand should I petition a GM before attempting ... just in case ?<br/>\n(I heard that this was fixed a few patches back but still I want to be<br/>\nsure, this is hundreds of hours worth of work, I don&#39;t want to lose it)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nyay the ordeal is almost over ..... treant fists next 8(.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
