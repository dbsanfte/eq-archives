I personally am not into twinking. An<br/>\nitem I earn means a whole lot more to me than an item I&#39;m given, but<br/>\nthat&#39;s all personal preference. From a game play point there are a few<br/>\nproblems with twinking that all those twinkers out there need to<br/>\nrealize. YOU ARE STUNTING YOUR GROWTH. Literally. I have a friend who<br/>\nopted for the easy way out and bought a bunch of cool stuff off of<br/>\ne-bay. Anything you want is for sale there for a price. So he gets some<br/>\nreally nice armor and stuff to raise his AC way up and his Stats as<br/>\nwell. Now he&#39;s taking on anything that cons white to him and kicking<br/>\nbutt. Leveling is no problem but... because he is so hard to hit at his<br/>\nlevel from artificially raised stats his abilities are going up real<br/>\nslow. Most things don&#39;t hit him and his dodge, block and defense are not<br/>\ngoing up 5 points per level. He&#39;s lucky if they go up 2 or 3. He hits<br/>\nfor so much damage that he&#39;s only raising his offense, double attack and<br/>\nspecial attack 2 or 3 per level also. At low level this isn&#39;t much of a<br/>\nproblem, but there will come a time when he&#39;s higher level that all the<br/>\nnon-twinkers catch up to him in items, but he won&#39;t be equal with them<br/>\nin abilities. Imagine being a 20th level Monk with only Above Average<br/>\nOffense and Defense instead of Master. Still, if you don&#39;t mind the<br/>\nproblems it will cause you at higher levels, then go ahead and twink<br/>\naway, but please come and duel with me when we both hit 30.....<br/>\n<br/>\nTymbyrwulf</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
