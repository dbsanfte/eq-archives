I got most of it in the first night. The last 2 nights<br/>\n&gt; 1 bracer dropped and I let the other monk who was there have it. In the<br/>\n&gt; times I missed, I heard of 2 jerkins and 1 pair of boots dropping.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Only 1 bracer, a jerkin and boots to go. And infact I only want the<br/>\n&gt; boots.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; How common are the boots usually ? (weren&#39;t very common this last week<br/>\n&gt; ;p).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What parts drop off of chests in hate ?<br/>\n&gt; Do the boots drop off phobos ?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
