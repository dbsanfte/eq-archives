A Serpentine Bracer for 800pp is one of the worst<br/>\n&gt; deals you can get.  Even 2 for that much would be bad.<br/>\n&gt;  The price has dropped recently so about 200-250 is a<br/>\n&gt; decent range.  Many high levels give them away for<br/>\n&gt; free.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 2.  Monk equipment shouldn&#39;t matter that much.  I will<br/>\n&gt; admit that I have recieved some nice items from guild<br/>\n&gt; members but what I would recomend you do is buy cured<br/>\n&gt; silk armor.  Pretty decent price.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 3.  You don&#39;t need to loot everything but don&#39;t think<br/>\n&gt; its the end of the world if you go over your limit.<br/>\n&gt; Try to hunt near a place you can sell.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 4.  250pp is quite a bit, you must not buy much.  I<br/>\n&gt; only have about 140pp TOTAL at level 20.  Of course I<br/>\n&gt; support another character and have recently bought<br/>\n&gt; some jewelry but still, don&#39;t consider yourself low on<br/>\n&gt; cash.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hammeron Stonspirit<br/>\n&gt; Monk of Quellious<br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Thousands of Stores.
