I just had to say though that when my STR is<br/>\n&gt; buffed up I notice a dramatic increase in the number of times I hit and the<br/>\n&gt; amount of damage I do. This is not strict scientific data not checked or<br/>\n&gt; anything but I do know that all my highs I have ever jotted down with flying<br/>\n&gt; kick and weapons attacks are all from when being buffed. If this is a<br/>\n&gt; coincidence then so be it. I do know that the 110 hps more I get from<br/>\n&gt; wearing Plat FO rings as opposed to any of the better STR rings does not<br/>\n&gt; mean a whole lot to me. If one of the mobs in Seb decides it really wants to<br/>\n&gt; rip into me with my HPs I am a lost cause anyways.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;      AC is the top dog but beyond that choose what you want. Whatever<br/>\n&gt; makes you happiest. I personally like AC/STR/MR. I just feel that even if it<br/>\n&gt; boosts my chances to hit by one percent when I am wielding low delay low<br/>\n&gt; damage weapons the more often I hit the more often I do my job which is<br/>\n&gt; dealing damage.
