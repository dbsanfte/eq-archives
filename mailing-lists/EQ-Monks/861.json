I&#39;ve seen it many times.  <br/>\nBut on the main point of this lil rant, soloing sucks.  In more than one way. <br/>\n First, it&#39;s boring as hell, you&#39;re all alone with nobody to talk to.  <br/>\nSecond, it&#39;s dangerous, you&#39;re in trouble if more than you can handle comes <br/>\nalong, and when you&#39;re soloing, that&#39;s normally more than one mob, which <br/>\nhappens at the worst times.  Third, you don&#39;t get half of what was designed <br/>\nfor this game, a massive MULTIPLAYER game,  that&#39;s what everybody is there <br/>\nfor, to make friends, interact and have fun together, in groups.  Fourth, <br/>\nwhen you do make lvl 50, you&#39;ll want good equipment, and for that, you need <br/>\nto group.  Well, from personal experience, I really dislike ppl that have <br/>\nsoloed their way up the lvls because they have no clue how to use their char <br/>\nin a group.  And it is grossly obvious when a person has done that, I simply <br/>\nwon&#39;t group with them again.  You NEED to group with ppl to help you out <br/>\nlater on, the &#39;I scratch your back, you scratch mine&#39; deal.  Don&#39;t get me <br/>\nwrong, once you&#39;ve climbed that ladder it&#39;s fun to go see what you can do on <br/>\nyour own, but soloing the whole way does not pay off in the long run.  Just <br/>\nabout all the high lvl ppl I know agree with me on this subject and don&#39;t <br/>\nlike to group with solos.  Well, I&#39;m done bitchin about soloists.<br/>\n<br/>\nKanja<br/>\n49 monk<br/>\nRodcet Nife</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
