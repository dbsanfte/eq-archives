After you&#39;ve turned in your hundreds of gnoll<br/>\nteeth and still find yourself with not enough faction, hail Ebon<br/>\nStrongbear who is at the top of the warriors guild in Qeynos by the<br/>\nCaptain of the guards.  If you have enough faction (not sure what you<br/>\nneed exactly) he will give you a bag and tell you to fill it up with bat<br/>\nwings and other assorted newbie loot.  Give him the bag combined with<br/>\nall the items and you recieve a Strongbear Bracer and a nice faction<br/>\nboost.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nZhanjin<br/>\nInnoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
