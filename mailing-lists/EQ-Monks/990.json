The main deciding factors for <br/>\nme are how much hp each have and how many hits they can take.  Can monks <br/>\ntake more hits than warriors if they use mend and have high agility?  Which <br/>\ncan dish out more damage up until level 30 or so?  Thanx for any answers in <br/>\nadvance.  i am kind of leaning towards warrior though since all the bad <br/>\nstuff i heard about FD now.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
