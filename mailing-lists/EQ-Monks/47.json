That&#39;s just off the top of my head.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom:\tAnkhorahil... <br/>\nSent:\tWednesday, June 09, 1999 8:43 AM<br/>\nTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aurum@...\">aurum@...</a><br/>\nSubject:\t[EQ-Monks] Let&#39;s set things right.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Ankhorahil... &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ankhorahil@...\">ankhorahil@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have recieved this message multiple times, I apologise, but it was <br/>\nnecessary to reach everyone possible.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I am writing today to try to correct an injustice that has been in <br/>\nexistance from the date of release. Many may feel that this issue is small <br/>\ncompared to many of the other problems with the game at this point. However, <br/>\nI feel that I am missing a large piece of the game because it appears as <br/>\nthough I am not allowed to fletch.<br/>\n<br/>\n  From all that I have heard and seen, there are only two places to buy the <br/>\nnecessary components for making arrows: Kelethin and Surefall Glade. As an <br/>\nevil character (Dark Elf, Troll, Ogre) it is near impossible to get these <br/>\nitems, and even more difficult to get them in quantities which make the <br/>\ntrade skill worth practicing.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Part of the irony in thi situation is that there IS an Ogre in the <br/>\nFeerrott which sells Bowyering components, but any fletcher will tell you <br/>\nthat you need to increase your skills with arrows before making bows.<br/>\n<br/>\n  In order to help resolve this situation, I wish to show the EQ Developers <br/>\nthat the players do have a voice. I propose a 3 step plan for you to help <br/>\nsolve this problem.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n1. In game, /feedback, and state that you would like to see a Merchant who <br/>\nsells arrow components in a conspicuous place in Neriak, Grobb, or Oggok<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Go to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://24.0.101.19/eq/\">http://24.0.101.19/eq/</a> and sign the petition that has been put up. <br/>\nAll that it asks for is a character name, race, class, and server. This list <br/>\nwill be sent straight to the EQ Developers as extra firepower for the cause.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Tell all the EQ gamers that you know to follow steps 1 and 2.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn order for this to work, we need everyone&#39;s support, not just those of the <br/>\ndarker affiliation. No matter what race or class your characters are, please <br/>\nparticipate to show that we can make a difference.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnkhorahil of the Rathe<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
