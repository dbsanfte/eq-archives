Most of the other abilities that I can think of off-hand<br/>\n&gt; seem to have progressed beyond that except at an extremely slow rate<br/>\n&gt; of progress.  Speaking as a recent achiever of level 46, I can say<br/>\n&gt; the following with some confidence:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - After the last 30 hours of play, my Defense has gone up a single<br/>\n&gt; point (to 211) - and I&#39;ve spent almost the entire time being the<br/>\n&gt; exclusive tank to a nearly endless parade of blues.<br/>\n&gt; - I don&#39;t remember the last time I saw Flying Kick go up.<br/>\n&gt; - Offense seems to keep going up at its normal rate of speed (now in the<br/>\n220s).<br/>\n&gt; - The last number I saw out of Dual Wield was 252 - and that was some<br/>\n&gt; time ago.  It&#39;s possible that it went higher (perhaps all the way to<br/>\n&gt; 255) and I just didn&#39;t notice it, however.<br/>\n&gt; - Mend seems to still be progressing, but again is an extremely slow<br/>\n&gt; progress so I may have capped that as well - not that it matters<br/>\n&gt; becuase it&#39;s been over 20 levels since it&#39;s failed.<br/>\n&gt; - Progress on Feign Death continues, although I haven&#39;t been working<br/>\n&gt; on it as much as I perhaps should lately so it still is languishing<br/>\n&gt; in the 190&#39;s.<br/>\n&gt; - Disarm is still moving into the 170s as well, but don&#39;t ask me why<br/>\n&gt; I bother - a disarmed opponent doesn&#39;t seem to be a whole lot less<br/>\n&gt; dangerous than an armed one.<br/>\n&gt; - Instill Doubt is the singularly most useless and dangerous (to us,<br/>\n&gt; that is) skill in our arsenal and I haven&#39;t bothered to skill it up a<br/>\n&gt; single point since acquiring it at level 29 (which is where I was<br/>\n&gt; when the patch went in which supports it), so I can&#39;t really speak on<br/>\n&gt; that one.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; While my current rate of progress is annoying, it doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; really bother me.  However, I&#39;m becoming rather concerned about my<br/>\n&gt; Defense and Flying Kick.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve capped them, but the<br/>\n&gt; rate of progress is disturbingly slow.  I really don&#39;t want to<br/>\n&gt; out-level my skills and thereby be rendered useless in a group of<br/>\n&gt; like-leveled people (as so many power-levelers have found).  Does<br/>\n&gt; anybody else have anything to say about this situation?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Aaron Braunstein<br/>\n&gt; Pacific Data Management, Inc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aaron_braunstein@...\">aaron_braunstein@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
