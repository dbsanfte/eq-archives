Every monk above level 20 will be doing a good deal more<br/>\ndamage - 15% more by level 50.  What this means is that like rogues we will be<br/>\ndoing &quot;hella taunts&quot; with our whirling fists.  I recommend you all dump some of<br/>\nyour dex and agi gear (keep agi above 120, but drop dex like a rock - detailed<br/>\nlog studies show it is useless to us!)   and switch it out for AC stuff.  I know<br/>\nI am going to go in all AC gear from now on, concentrating on str as secondary. <br/>\nI may also start using easgle strike a bit more (it taunts alot less than kick<br/>\nand does almost as much damage).<br/>\n<br/>\nJust be prepared for a change in tactics and gear once the patch goes live.<br/>\n<br/>\nHumbly submitted<br/>\nInno Thunderfist</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
