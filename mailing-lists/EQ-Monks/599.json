How often have <br/>\nyou headed into that area to camp for that item you need for your character <br/>\nor your friend who is with you only to find that guy 15 levels above anything <br/>\nin the place sitting there in front of you? I think twinking is a problem <br/>\noutside of just beefing up characters but in that I have heard many times <br/>\nsomeone say I can use this for my other character this gets under my skin. <br/>\nWhat if I can use it for the character I am playing at the moment which <br/>\nhappens to be the ONLY character I have. The problem comes when they camp for <br/>\nitems for these other characters. I am not saying everyone does it, but I <br/>\nhave seen it done MOORE then enough times to have a almost automatic dislike <br/>\nfor every twinked character I have met. I have gone in to maybe camp the <br/>\nJboots with friends and find 4 35+ lvl casters sitting there camping the <br/>\nspot. All from the same guild. When they killed her in trotted one of their <br/>\nlower level guildmembers to loot the corpse. This is the problem I have with <br/>\nit. Twinking encourages camping and camping is already enough of a problem as <br/>\nis. I could care less if his high level friend gave him all that stuff, but <br/>\nif his high level friend was sitting in front of me when I was going for the <br/>\nsame item then it did effect me. How can you prove either way?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
