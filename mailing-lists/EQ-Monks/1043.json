Another thoguht is that<br/>\nthose<br/>\n&gt; &gt;bracers come off of a difficult Mob in Lguk. at level 16 you werent<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&quot;supposed&quot; to have those. Back at level 16 when E-marr was still new and<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; &gt;highest playes were only in there low 30&#39;s noone had those bracers.<br/>\nPeople<br/>\n&gt; &gt;on the server didnt even know where they came from. I Think I was wearing<br/>\n&gt; &gt;woven still at that point. dont dispair because you dont have level 30<br/>\n&gt; &gt;equipment at level 16. you will get it eventually.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Kizmet Bayashi<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Monk of the 46th ....<br/>\n&gt; &gt;E-Marr<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Da`Kor<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&quot;Good things come to those monks who wait&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But the problem is that there are those at my level or close to it who<br/>\n&gt; *can* afford this stuff.
