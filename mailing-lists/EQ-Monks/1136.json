I haven&#39;t had a problem<br/>\nwith it and am learning how to use it.  I did see something regarding Feign<br/>\nDeath on EQ vault that I found interesting.  I will post it here: <br/>\n<br/>\nFeign Death Spell <br/>\nVerant Interent Relations Manager Gordon Wrinn made a post about a new bug<br/>\ndiscovered in EQ. The following post is from the Gameplay forum: <br/>\nA bug has been brought to our attention. A necromancer can sic their pet<br/>\n(charmed or summoned) upon a critter, load on DOT spells, and then cast Feign<br/>\nDeath. The pet remains, fighting the critter, and the critter ignores the<br/>\nnecromancer despite all of the damage being done by the DOTs. <br/>\nWhat *should* happen is that the pet should behave as if the owner hid or<br/>\nbecame invisible. That is, the pet should suicide if summomed, or should<br/>\nuncharm if charmed. <br/>\nOur inclination is that we should fix this bug, because the tactic is pretty<br/>\nlame and allows the necromancer to do things they shouldn&#39;t be able to do,<br/>\nsuch<br/>\nas soloing high level critters in closed quarters. <br/>\nSo, should we change this? Or leave it as is? <br/>\n-Gordon <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the same company that changed our version of Feign Death without any<br/>\ninput from the people who play the game.  Why are they suddenly asking for<br/>\nopinions?  I say it should be changed, if just to level the playing field.  I<br/>\nguess this goes to prove thast if you play a popular class you get special<br/>\nbenefits, but if you are the minority you get walked all over. Oh, well all<br/>\nthe<br/>\nNecros will scream that it would be unfair to take away this unbalancing &quot;bug&quot;<br/>\nand we will still get stuck with our nerfed FD.<br/>\n<br/>\nShando, 17th circle, Bertoxxulous</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
