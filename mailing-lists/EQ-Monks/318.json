The Qeynos monk&#39;s faction with them is usually too<br/>\n&gt; low to allow him to begin the quests. There are several quests in Qeynos<br/>\n&gt; that will allow a Freeport monk to increase their faction with the Silent<br/>\n&gt; Fist, but no such quests (that I&#39;m aware of) in Freeport to increase<br/>\n&gt; faction with the Ashen Order.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Workarounds for this have been the subject of much debate. Many solutions<br/>\n&gt; have been presented, however, it looks like Verant has &quot;fixed&quot; them all.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m going to list all the ones that don&#39;t work now, so that any starting<br/>\n&gt; monks won&#39;t fall into these traps...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;1) Create a Freeport monk and get his guild note to turn in for instant<br/>\n&gt; faction.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Problem: The guild notes are now Lore items, and so are no-drop, no-trade.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;2) Do the Tomer and/or Konem Quests in Qeynos.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Problem: The only faction you increase with these now is with the Silent<br/>\n&gt; Fist, the Ashen Order does NOT show up anymore.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;3) Get a Freeport monk to give you their White Sash, and then carry on<br/>\n&gt; from there.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Problem: If you try to get the next sash by turning in your current sash<br/>\n&gt; (gotten from the Freeport monk) and the items, you lose all the items and<br/>\n&gt; the sash. The Ashen Guild member will give you a message like &quot;I will not<br/>\n&gt; help beings of your kind&quot;. This is especially vexing if you had a Freeport<br/>\n&gt; monk to give you the Orange sash, and tried to turn it in for the Red sash.<br/>\n&gt; The Red sash items are a little hard to come by, and having them go up in<br/>\n&gt; smoke would be frustrating.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;In conclusion, it looks like the only way to truly do the quests now is to<br/>\n&gt; build your faction with the Freeport monks in some way. I have been<br/>\n&gt; noticing that they HAVE been starting to like me more, but, I am unsure as<br/>\n&gt; to why. I believe it is because I&#39;ve been killed so many orcs lately. If<br/>\n&gt; anyone has any ideas, they would be welcome.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;The only possible workaround I see now, is to give the items for the later<br/>\n&gt; quests to a Freeport monk (one you create or another player) and have them<br/>\n&gt; give you the resulting sash. However, I think the later sashes are no-drop,<br/>\n&gt; no-trade, unlike the beginning sashes, which are Lore items, but can be<br/>\n&gt; traded.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Finally, the point of the Monk headbands/sashes is not that they are<br/>\n&gt; terribly powerful magical items, but that it&#39;s fun and challenging for a<br/>\n&gt; monk to complete a quest that is not really available to many other people.<br/>\n&gt; Sure there are lots of items that are better, but it&#39;s a nice part of you<br/>\n&gt; character when you can say that you are a Purple Headband, Purple Sash<br/>\n&gt; holder ;-)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;(If I&#39;ve made any glaring errors/omissions, I apologize, and would expect<br/>\n&gt; that I will be corrected asap &lt;grin&gt;)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;ATTN ONELIST USERS: stay current on the latest activities,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;programs, & features at ONElist by joining our member newsletter at<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/onelist_announce\">http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/onelist_announce</a> &quot;&gt;Click&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Brian Malkowski<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; QuakeGod -- CO-Everything -- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:quakegod@...\">quakegod@...</a><br/>\n&gt; TeleFragged -- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.telefragged.com\">http://www.telefragged.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Power Incomprehensible, Energy Indispensable<br/>\n&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ONElist now has T-SHIRTS!<br/>\n&gt; For details and to order, go to:<br/>\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/tshirt1\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/tshirt1</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
