And that is to get a freaking Werewolf<br/>\n&gt; claw. Now being one that does not like to run around in the stupid West<br/>\n&gt; Commonlands, or West Karana asking repetitively anyone have a werewolf on<br/>\n&gt; tracking let me know! I got so bored and tired so I have decided to go to<br/>\n&gt; Mistmoore and try to get to the dance floor. Now I have been to MM quite a<br/>\n&gt; few times but I have never been inside the castle barely even down the ramp<br/>\n&gt; towards the castle. mainly the Grave Yard and the zone line. Now I would<br/>\n&gt; like some help on any suggestions or tips as to what to go or how to go<br/>\n&gt; about getting to the Dance Room with the Gypsies/Werewolves....i.e. party<br/>\n&gt; make up and level or a site where there might be a map. Thanks for your<br/>\n&gt; help.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kaladiel<br/>\n&gt; 39th Level Monk<br/>\n&gt; Brell Serilis<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
