I just hit 15 and I&#39;m still a little uncomfortable<br/>\nsoloing in Oasis. Orc hunting can be a dangerous buisness when you are by<br/>\nyourself. Orcs tend to wander a bit, and will help other Orcs they see in a<br/>\nfight. A fight can go from one orc to three orcs pretty damn fast.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven the orcs that con blue to me can still beat me in a fight, if they stun<br/>\nme a few times, and my mend fails during the skirmish. Enter Oasis from N Ro<br/>\nby the mountain side and you should find some people willing to group. Orcs<br/>\nare not the only thing to hunt in Oasis, but they are the ones closet to the<br/>\nN Ro zone edge, which I assume is where you&#39;ll be coming from. If you decide<br/>\nto venture down the waters edge, you can find some good crocs and caimens to<br/>\nkill, but they will be real tough at your level, and it can be loooong way<br/>\nback to zone edge from their spawning areas.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, I would wait till I hit 13 (or better yet 14) before Oasis. Even<br/>\nthen, you&#39;ll be out classed until you get your double attack skill up at<br/>\nlevel 15.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne last tip, if you see &quot;an Orc Warrior&quot;, that&#39;s good. If you see &quot;a Orc<br/>\nWarrior&quot; run like hell. That guy is an 18-20th lvl orc capable of dealing out<br/>\nover 50 pts damage a round, making him a favorite target for upper teen<br/>\ngroupings.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne Last Last Tip: Treat Casters with Respect, Kill them First.<br/>\n<br/>\nStonedorn, Monk of Xegony &lt;Protectors of Light&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWorlord wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Worlord &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:worlord99@...\">worlord99@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am a level 12 (nearly 13) freeport monk who is<br/>\n&gt; really happy the way in which his character is going.<br/>\n&gt; I think the truly great thing about the monk is that<br/>\n&gt; in lower levels we don&#39;t have near as many expensizes<br/>\n&gt; as other races.  Like at 12 I have 50plat in bank and<br/>\n&gt; I would have 80 except yesterday I bought a Lockjaw<br/>\n&gt; hide vest and a snakeskin mask.  All the other people<br/>\n&gt; around my level seem to be short on cash.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On to my question, at what level can I go into oasis.<br/>\n&gt; I mean so I can walk in solo and still kill some guys<br/>\n&gt; while I am trying to find a group?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Worlord<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hammeron<br/>\n&gt; 12th Circle<br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Bid and sell for free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://auctions.yahoo.com\">http://auctions.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Share your special moments with family and friends - send PHOTO Greetings<br/>\n&gt; at Zing.com!
