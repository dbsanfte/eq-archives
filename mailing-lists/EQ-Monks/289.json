Stay close to the guard <br/>\ntowers, and look for Mist Wolves, Young Lionesses, Brown Bears and possibly <br/>\nYoung Lions.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe guards will attack everything you&#39;ll run into (unless you&#39;re unlucky <br/>\nenough to find a wandering bandit) so you should be able to survive the <br/>\noccasional grizzly attack as long as you run for cover straight away :)<br/>\n<br/>\n- Steve (Tellos, 10th lvl, Veeshan)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Clarkson, Ron L&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:clarkrl3@...\">clarkrl3@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; OK.  I am a 7th level monk travelling through the Qeynos area on the new<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Tribunal server.  I&#39;ve run into a stump, though.  It seems to me that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; everything in the area is now either conning green or conning yellow <br/>\n&gt;(few<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and far between).  However, if I go to different zones, it&#39;s instant red<br/>\n&gt; &gt; cons.  Any suggestions on getting over this level hump?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
