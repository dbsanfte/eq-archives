Your fist has a 30 delay then how can some<br/>\n&gt; &gt; weapons have a delay below 30?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Would think fist should be the fastest delay!! Hmmm doesn&#39;t seem right that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; holding a weapon makes you attack faster....<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Congratulations GENEVINCENT.
