Before they changed Paw, I used to hang in there <br/>\nkilling the stuff around 10-14th, and there were always high level people in <br/>\nthere killing the high level mobs shouting out things like &quot;What the heck is <br/>\na head of Shin?&quot;, of course my reply would always be &quot;Monk quest item, need <br/>\nit for anything?  I could take it off your hands.&quot;  Hehe, I got most of my <br/>\nsashes/headbands that way.  Anyway, hopefully he won&#39;t jump me again for for <br/>\ntrying to give you some good advice.<br/>\n<br/>\nShelza, 18th, Karana<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Andy Sands &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:andy.sands@...\">andy.sands@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [EQ-Monks] Re: What to buy?<br/>\n&gt;Date: Fri, 04 Feb 2000 18:31:21 +0000<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hehe Clarity<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Starting a fight on my behalf?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;I&#39;m sorry, but what are you talking about?  Herrick is a level 12 monk<br/>\n&gt;talking<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;about saving up scarab carapaces for 1.7gp each!  Do you think this guy <br/>\n&gt;has<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;30pp to go buy a bracer of erolisi? or 100pp to get a silver-plated <br/>\n&gt;bracer?<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;Please tell me what armor better than cured even a level 18 can go get?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;13th now :)<br/>\n&gt;I have seen people selling Lockjaw Vests around Freeport, and was thinking<br/>\n&gt;of saving for one. They are about 30pp.. and I&#39;ve about 11 saved so far..<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Admittedly it&#39;s a lot at my level, but if I saved up 50pp for some Wu&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;then by the time I hit 18, I should have bought a bit more stuff (although<br/>\n&gt;I am currently spending most of my income on training up my brewing skill)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Finally got my orange sash too.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;Herrick of Quellious [Champions of Justice]<br/>\n&gt;13th Circle<br/>\n&gt;Bristlebane<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;E-mail: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:andy@...\">andy@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
