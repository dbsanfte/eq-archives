(knight never spawned while i was there,<br/>\n&gt; heh.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; At 10:57 PM 9/17/1999 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:IBNALNOOR@...\">IBNALNOOR@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I would just like to say to the person that used the 26th level Bard to get <br/>\n&gt; &gt;stuff that fine great if no one else wa around. I on the other hand have <br/>\n&gt; &gt;walked into RE to try for a BIBS for a friend and found a 45th lvl Necro <br/>\n&gt; &gt;sitting in the room. There he was taking away from us. I do not care if you <br/>\n&gt; &gt;add to your character if it hurts no one else, but in the case of something <br/>\n&gt; &gt;like a BIBS where it is a fairly rare drop your taking one might mean the <br/>\n&gt; &gt;difference from some poor appropriate level guy sitting there half an hour <br/>\n&gt; &gt;our 3 to 4 hours. The Onyx Ear rings are a frequent drop, but some of the <br/>\n&gt; &gt;other items especially the items that started this whole debate are not. Can <br/>\n&gt; &gt;anyone honestly say on this post that they have never  walked and saw<br/>\n&gt; someone <br/>\n&gt; &gt;obviously not there for the hunting, but instead for the items? I have <br/>\n&gt; &gt;absolutely no problem if someone gives there second character 1,000,000 plat <br/>\n&gt; &gt;to buy everything in the game, but when they start having 45th lvl Necro&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; &gt;sitting in front of me and my friend trying to get a BIBS that becomes a <br/>\n&gt; &gt;problem to me. If something drops maybe 3 or 4 times a day you have taken <br/>\n&gt; &gt;something from someone else. For you to say that you did not is just plain <br/>\n&gt; &gt;lieing to yourself. Again I have no problem with giving you character a leg <br/>\n&gt; &gt;up. I am doing something like that woth my Monk. During the course of my <br/>\n&gt; &gt;regular hunting if I find something that could be useful for the Druid I<br/>\n&gt; plan <br/>\n&gt; &gt;on someday making I stick it in the bank. I will not though go out and camp <br/>\n&gt; &gt;something for him. I will not make someone wait in line behind me while I go <br/>\n&gt; &gt;for something that my current character does not need. <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
