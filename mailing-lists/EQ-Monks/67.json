It&#39;s like walking around in the beat<br/>\n&gt; up<br/>\n&gt; blue Keds you had back in 2nd grade.  Seeing as there is no &#39;mesh<br/>\n&gt; boots&#39; or<br/>\n&gt; anything of that ilk, I was wondering what was out there that was<br/>\n&gt; monk-friendly (i.e. low weight).  AC is obviouly desireable, although<br/>\n&gt; anything that could offer other bonuses (stat increase, resistances,<br/>\n&gt; etc.)<br/>\n&gt; would be wonderful.<br/>\n&gt; \tSuggestions, advices, personal experiences appreciated...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Aaron Braunstein<br/>\n&gt; Pacific Data Management, Inc.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aaron_braunstein@...\">aaron_braunstein@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; ONElist members are using Shared Files in great ways!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Are you?
