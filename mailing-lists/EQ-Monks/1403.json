Well.. Thats different... AC is boring and worthless unless you play<br/>\non a pvp server, then it gets interesting.  Also... someone 5 or even 10<br/>\nlevels above you cant just kill you off the bat... If you get ahead in the<br/>\nfight then you can win too...<br/>\n<br/>\n      If you hate zones, AC is good too.<br/>\n<br/>\n      Its also possible to kill monsters much higher level than you, thus<br/>\nfaster and less tedious leveling<br/>\n<br/>\n       Thats all I have to say, now back to raising my archer up to level 10<br/>\nso I can hit the golem burial grounds...<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nDarkblade,<br/>\n&quot;When is Verant gonna realize they created a dead game?&quot; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
