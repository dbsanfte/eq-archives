Bank one of your leather items (not the shirt). Check your AC and <br/>\ncarry weight again. After a while, you will find the combination of worn & <br/>\nbanked items that gives you the best AC. Once you&#39;ve done this, you will <br/>\nwant to start replacing what you banked with a very light armour...<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat city are you adventuring from?<br/>\n<br/>\n- Steve<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Xurlus@...\">Xurlus@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hail all, I am a relatively new member of the EverQuest family.On the E&#39;Chi <br/>\n&gt;world I just reached 8th lvl, moments ago actualy, And have many Q&#39;s <br/>\n&gt;regarding the intricacies of playing the ever loved Monk.
