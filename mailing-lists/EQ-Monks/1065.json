Their e-mail?  If EQ dropped off the planet, would you have any<br/>\nway to find these people again?<br/>\n<br/>\nEQ is still a game.<br/>\n<br/>\nI went to play basketball the other day, I liked a guy I *played* against,<br/>\nand we became friends.  The basketball game is still a game<br/>\neven if I do meet friends there.  And maybe we only meet on the basketball<br/>\ncourt.  ... Basketball is still just a game.  Just like work is work,<br/>\neven though I have created friends at work, the &quot;work&quot; I do is still<br/>\njust work.  The people you meet while you play a game <br/>\ndo not make the game more than what it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nI played a mud for well over 7 years, and during that time, my fellow<br/>\nmudders and I became such good friends that we had international<br/>\ngatherings of us mudders to meet in real life.  Yes, the friends I<br/>\ncreated there last a lifetime, but where we met, the mud... the &quot;game&quot;<br/>\nwill always be just a game.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Bennett, Brian&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:BRIAN.BENNETT@...\">BRIAN.BENNETT@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So you&#39;re saying you haven&#39;t made one friend on EQ that you want to keep?<br/>\n&gt; So you solo everything?  Never group, never interact?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; All those little names popping up on your screen are real people - true,<br/>\n&gt; most of the game is spent trying to get better and better &quot;bits&quot; on that<br/>\n&gt; computer in California, but to make a blanket the game is not real statement<br/>\n&gt; is wrong.  There are people in that game that I care about, and I know there<br/>\n&gt; are a few that return the favor.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This e-mail is not real.
