Because the Monk IS the<br/>\n    best puler in the game Bar none. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n          Once again, I am going to have to disagree. The Monk is the 2nd best puller in the game. The best puller is one that no one has mentioned yet: The Bard. The reason the Bard is the best puller is because of Kelin`s Lugubrious Lament (Lull), Kelin`s Lucid Lullaby (AoE Lull), and Selo&#39;s Accelerando. Bards can use the spells to pull EXACTLY one Mob and then hightail it back to the group. If they do pull more they can use Kelin&#39;s Lullaby to keep them occupied or just haul ass to zone. All in all, if you have a Bard that knows what he is doing, they are the best pullers.<br/>\n<br/>\n          However, that all said and done, most Bards are not as adept at pulling as Monks are. Monks start honing their pulling skills early on. Bards, for the most part, never really work on pulling. So, given the same skill level and knowledge, a Bard is a better class for pulling. I still like a Monk because of the damage they deal. Bard songs are invaluable at higher levels though. I would choose a Bard (that knows what they are doing) over a Shaman/Druid/Paladin/Ranger if possible.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  ���`�.�.�.���.�.��.���`����`�.�.�.���.�.��.���`�<br/>\n          <br/>\n          Dan Gilbert, MCSE<br/>\n          Internet Systems Engineer<br/>\n          <br/>\n          GGI Technologies<br/>\n          P.O.
