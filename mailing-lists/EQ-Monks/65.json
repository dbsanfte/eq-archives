That is my experience when I could not get the <br/>\nyellow sash.  Chette helped (?) me and that&#39;s the party line I got.  She <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t say anything else and I was really upset.  It turns out I was not <br/>\ngiving my white sash, which another monk finally told me I had to do.  I <br/>\ngot the quest BEFORE a patch that made giving the white sash mandatory, and <br/>\nmissed it when I re-read the quest text.  My friend had already performed <br/>\nthe quest and didn&#39;t have to give his sash so that made me not even think <br/>\nabout it...<br/>\n<br/>\nJason<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shadow@...\">shadow@...</a> [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shadow@...\">shadow@...</a>]<br/>\nSent:\tMonday, June 14, 1999 2:40 PM<br/>\nTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject:\tRe: [EQ-Monks] Red sash quest questions...<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shadow@...\">shadow@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n From everything I&#39;ve read, all you need is the blackened wand and the <br/>\nblackened sapphire, and the orange sash.
