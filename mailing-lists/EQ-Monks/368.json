Anything more than that would not be worth<br/>\nit...considering you can buy a Black Pearl for about 75pp on my<br/>\nserver...and get much better jewelry made from it and it has a much higher<br/>\nresell value if you ever wanted to sell it.<br/>\n<br/>\nCormik<br/>\nCazic Thule</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
