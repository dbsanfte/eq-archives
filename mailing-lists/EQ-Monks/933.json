We found it<br/>\n&gt; tough going at first mainly <br/>\n&gt; because everytime we hit (and we monks do that a<br/>\n&gt; lot) most of the creatures <br/>\n&gt; there we were taking damage (darn shields).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We now spend most of our time in Najena and tend to<br/>\n&gt; group with others our <br/>\n&gt; level and up to maybe level 22.  We have the<br/>\n&gt; occassional bad situation but <br/>\n&gt; for the most part we are able to control the first<br/>\n&gt; third of the area.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Last night was probably the worst.  I was escorting<br/>\n&gt; someone to the zone and <br/>\n&gt; it seemed like everything came at us.  We had 2 ogre<br/>\n&gt; guards, 4 earth <br/>\n&gt; elementals, 2 mist elementals, 1 fire elemental,<br/>\n&gt; probably 6 greater <br/>\n&gt; skeletons, a magician and her pet and to top it off<br/>\n&gt; a terror tentacle <br/>\n&gt; beating on us.  We almost got them all.  Mental<br/>\n&gt; Note: Feign Death is less <br/>\n&gt; likely to work when there are 5-6 mobs<br/>\n&gt; hitting/casting on you at the same <br/>\n&gt; time.  This situation is pretty rare I have found.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you can bring along someone to &#39;cancel magic&#39;<br/>\n&gt; when there is a shield, or <br/>\n&gt; root the runners/blast the runners both Lavastorm<br/>\n&gt; and Najena can be lots of <br/>\n&gt; fun.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I digressed a bit.  Sorry.  Point is, we keep on<br/>\n&gt; coming back to Lavastorm <br/>\n&gt; and Najena.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Tom De Vries&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tdevries@...\">tdevries@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Subject: Re: [EQ-Monks] Re: Some Thoughts (please<br/>\n&gt; read)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Date: Fri, 29 Oct 1999 12:30:55 -0500<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I also am level 17...

Perhaps it<br/>\n&gt; is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; because I learn zones quickly and generally<br/>\n&gt; always<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; know where I am.  Buy a greater lightstone,<br/>\n&gt; memorize<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the zone you are in, max out sense heading and<br/>\n&gt; always<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; know which way to run.  Thats the best advice I<br/>\n&gt; can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; give.  I have a druid with infravision and it<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; seem to be much of an improvement (still can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; see<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; anything in Misty Thicket)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Just live with it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Second...
