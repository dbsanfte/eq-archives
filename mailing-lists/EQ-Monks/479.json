Monks and Rogues<br/>\n&gt; are amazing for dealing damage at the higher levels. Where both classes<br/>\n&gt; begin to blossom unfortunately most people stop playing these character<br/>\n&gt; types before they even get there. What are monks good for. Well lets take a<br/>\n&gt; look at this whole pulling thing. To be able to Feign Death pull is a huge<br/>\n&gt; asset not only to a group but to solo fighting. Walking into a room of 5<br/>\n&gt; mobs and pulling out one is an amazing trick. On top of that. I myself spent<br/>\n&gt; levels 30 to where I am now at 47 with only a cleric at my side. Yes I did<br/>\n&gt; group with others but most of my hunting would be just myself and him.<br/>\n&gt; Damage wise. Lets take a look at this. Shooting out 4 attacks every 3 secs<br/>\n&gt; potentially hitting for 50 each time lets average at 35 plus a high kick in<br/>\n&gt; the 90s. Those 4 attacks every 3 secs or just over 2 if you have the black<br/>\n&gt; sash from Lower Guk giving you HASTE. What does this mean. 140 points of<br/>\n&gt; damage every 2 to 3 secs plus a kick every 8 or so putting potential damage<br/>\n&gt; for a 9 sec interval at somewhere between 400 and 600. To me that is pretty<br/>\n&gt; impressive! You can heal yourself every 6 minutes. Making clerics love you<br/>\n&gt; knowing that they don&#39;t have to heal you at the first sight of damage.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please any other Higher level Monks respond to this so the younger guys can<br/>\n&gt; know that it does get better and that we are not as impaired as they think<br/>\n&gt; we are.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Heldenfeld<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: Robb Flynn &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:RobF@...\">RobF@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, September 07, 1999 7:08 AM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [EQ-Monks] Suggested monk improvements<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Robb Flynn &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:RobF@...\">RobF@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; will do. A question tho... if this is the case, why then do many monks say<br/>\n&gt; &gt; we need more damage dealing ability? Because they are not out-damaging<br/>\n&gt; &gt; everyone in sight? I have no problem with my role in group situations<br/>\n&gt; &gt; changing as my abilities change.. Actually I think they should. I know I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; would get fairly bored if my role from lvl 1-50 was static. It is the<br/>\n&gt; whole<br/>\n&gt; &gt; reason I dumped my lvl 18 warrior. I never saw any change in what would be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; expected of the class. The original post I responded to said most groups<br/>\n&gt; &gt; seek monks for their pulling ability. Well, lets take a look at what the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; other classes are sought after for:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Cleric- healing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Druid- ok.. bad example, they do alot of things<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Shaman- buffing (and see druid)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Wiz- blasting<br/>\n&gt; &gt; War- soaking and dealing damage<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Ranger- dealing damage<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Enchanter- debuffing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; rogue- backstabbing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Mag- ummm never grouped with one so I am not sure.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Necro- DoT<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; All classes (except Druid and Shaman) have one thing they are outstanding<br/>\n&gt; &gt; at, and other things they do ok, and some things they just plain stink at.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Why is it bad to be sought after because we are the best pullers in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lands? Should Rogues be upset that the only thing anyone ever expects of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; them is to backstab? The point I am trying rather long-windedly to make is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that while there are many abilities we do not have, the ones we do have<br/>\n&gt; are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; vital in a group situation, which is how EQ was designed to be played (I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; won&#39;t go into the whole solo vs group issue, as I am sure each of us has a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; different opinion). Regardless of what class is played, if you know what<br/>\n&gt; &gt; your strengths and weaknesses are and utilize them accordingly, you will<br/>\n&gt; be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a sought after party member.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; But thanks for the info on the perception and ability change that comes<br/>\n&gt; with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 30. I look forward to finding yet another facet of the monk class.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Safe travels<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Praelor Dileasai<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: Red Eyes [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:puckhoog@...\">puckhoog@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Tuesday, September 07, 1999 10:01 AM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [EQ-Monks] Suggested monk improvements<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: &quot;Red Eyes&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:puckhoog@...\">puckhoog@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Your entire opinion will change once you hit 30th level.

I don&#39;t think we should be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out-damaging a warrior swinging a big 2h weapon or dual wielding, and<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t want to. They have the ac and the hp to protect them from those<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 50+<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; damage blows that would chew us up in very little time. I have always<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; been<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the belief that the monk is NOT a tank. Our armor limitations<br/>\n&gt; prevent<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; us<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from acting like one. With one MoB, we are fine as Dodge and Block<br/>\n&gt; will<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; serve us well, but if we get hit, we get hit HARD. With 2 or more<br/>\n&gt; MoB&#39;s,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; our<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dodge and Block skill will not serve us nearly as well. We are more<br/>\n&gt; like<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; an<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; animated DoT spell, inflicting a steady amount of damage throughout<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; duration of a fight. Few people can dish out the damage we can yet<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; remain<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; relatively unmolested. A drawback is it is very difficult to pull a<br/>\n&gt; MoB<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; off<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a party member who is in trouble, and perhaps I would enjoy having a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Taunt<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; skill (no I don&#39;t think it is built into our special attacks), but I<br/>\n&gt; for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; one<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; think the Monk class on the whole is doing just fine.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Praelor Dileasai<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lvl 27 Monk of the Ashen Order<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Felizpunk@...\">Felizpunk@...</a> [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Felizpunk@...\">Felizpunk@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Saturday, September 04, 1999 2:58 AM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [EQ-Monks] Suggested monk improvements<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Felizpunk@...\">Felizpunk@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  Lots of good points brought up in this discussion.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  I agree completely that we should get some kind of stunning attack,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; our delay should beat most, if not all, weapons.
