The Qeynos monk&#39;s faction with them is usually too<br/>\nlow to allow him to begin the quests. There are several quests in Qeynos<br/>\nthat will allow a Freeport monk to increase their faction with the Silent<br/>\nFist, but no such quests (that I&#39;m aware of) in Freeport to increase<br/>\nfaction with the Ashen Order.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;Workarounds for this have been the subject of much debate.

The Ashen Guild member will give you a message like &quot;I will not<br/>\nhelp beings of your kind&quot;. This is especially vexing if you had a Freeport<br/>\nmonk to give you the Orange sash, and tried to turn it in for the Red sash.<br/>\nThe Red sash items are a little hard to come by, and having them go up in<br/>\nsmoke would be frustrating.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;In conclusion, it looks like the only way to truly do the quests now is to<br/>\n </span></blockquote>build your faction with the Freeport monks in some way. I have been<br/>\nnoticing that they HAVE been starting to like me more, but, I am unsure as<br/>\nto why. I believe it is because I&#39;ve been killed so many orcs lately. If<br/>\nanyone has any ideas, they would be welcome.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;The only possible workaround I see now, is to give the items for the later<br/>\n </span></blockquote>quests to a Freeport monk (one you create or another player) and have them<br/>\ngive you the resulting sash.
