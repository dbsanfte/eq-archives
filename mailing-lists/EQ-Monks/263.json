It appears to only be affecting me, but it is severe enough to<br/>\nbring to your attention as well, I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night, while zoning from South Keladim into North Keladim (where the<br/>\nbank is) I crashed. A drag, but nothing all that new. The twist is, however,<br/>\nI cannot log my monk, Praelor, back onto the server! I tried re-starting EQ,<br/>\nre-connecting my ISP, and re-booting my system, all to no avail. I brought<br/>\nin a lvl 2 druid and /petitioned, and spent the next 3 hours speaking with a<br/>\nguide and a gm. The GM said he would reset my character to a point prior to<br/>\nthe disappearance, but could make no promises on when that would occur. So I<br/>\nlogged and tried again this morning.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd there he was, right where I had started Last night. Everything appeared<br/>\nto be fine. I still needed to go to the bank, however, so off to Keladim I<br/>\nwent, and upon zoning from S. Keladim into N. Keladim again, I crashed. With<br/>\nthe same results as last night. Well, it was 6:30 am EST, and no GM&#39;S were<br/>\nonline, but I did speak with a guide who promised to forward my problem to<br/>\nthen first GM who showed up, but it would not be for several hours.<br/>\nUnderstandable, given that it was 3:30 am in San Diego.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo now, with time to kill before work, I decided to experiment. I created a<br/>\nDwarven Cleric and ran him into the zone and promptly crashed. So at least<br/>\nit is not a corrupt character file with Praelor. I then created a Dwarven<br/>\nCleric on The Tribunal server and zoned with no problem. Now I know it is<br/>\nnot a corrupt N. Keladim data file and that it is specific to Fenin Ro. A<br/>\nfew of my guildmates then create characters on Fenin Ro and zone with no<br/>\nproblem, so it is not a server-wide issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll this leads me to believe that it is something specific with the link<br/>\nbetween my system and the Fenin Ro servers, but I just wanted to give<br/>\neveryone a heads up on this &quot;just in case&quot;. I am planning on re-installing<br/>\nEQ and running all the patches tonight, and will let you know the outcome.<br/>\nWith any luck, that will solve everything and Praelor Dileasai will once<br/>\nagain be running from all those nasty critters in Mistmoore (hehe). If<br/>\nnot... well.. I just don&#39;t really want to think about the &quot;if not&quot; scenario<br/>\nyet.<br/>\n<br/>\nPraelor Dileasai<br/>\nThe Limbo Monk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
