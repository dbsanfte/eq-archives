We do have<br/>\n&gt;as good AC as warriors.  At lvl 50, my AC is 824 base, and that&#39;s not with my<br/>\n&gt;tankin gear, I can easily bump it up to over 850.<br/>\n&gt;     Now for my lil rant.  HOW can you say using FD pulling was exploiting on<br/>\n&gt;the planes??  Do you know what happens now?  Even more of a cheat if you ask<br/>\n&gt;me.  Just takes longer, cause now after FD, you just need to /exit and wait 3<br/>\n&gt;min before loggin back into the server.  I have been lvl 50 for about 2 or 3<br/>\n&gt;months now, and this nerf has seriously hurt our skills.  We are pullers,<br/>\n&gt;that is our main contribution to a party after we get FD and hone our skills.<br/>\n&gt;  We can still do this job, but it makes it MUCH more difficult and time<br/>\n&gt;comsuming.  Yes you can get around it, BUT, IMHO, I now think we have to use<br/>\n&gt;more of a cheat to get around it.  There are other ways, yes, but WHY (and<br/>\n&gt;believe me, I&#39;ve sent in MANY feedbacks and petitions) did Verant change this<br/>\n&gt;skill.  Okay, I&#39;m done, thanks for listening all.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Kanja<br/>\n&gt;Rodcet Nife<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
