The first poster is using some software package (ShowEQ or <br/>\n&gt; something similar) to display a numeric value for his skill. In answer to <br/>\n&gt; the first poster&#39;s question, you will not be able to improve your skill <br/>\n&gt; beyond 120 until you reach a level that allows you to progress beyond that<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; skill (level 24 in this case).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Then why did it allow me to get to 120 at lvl 4?  I mean, why go from<br/>\n100 to 120, stop for 20 lvls, then start up again?<br/>\n<br/>\nThat makes no sense at all.<br/>\n<br/>\n(I&#39;m not using ShowEQ, BTW; I looked at my log file to see where it<br/>\nstarted and ended.)<br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\n &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/3763/7/_/541798/_/956928179/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/3763/7/_/541798/_/956928179/</a>&gt; <br/>\n  &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://adimg.egroups.com/img/3763/7/_/541798/_/956928179/bad-boy.gif\">http://adimg.egroups.com/img/3763/7/_/541798/_/956928179/bad-boy.gif</a>&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n  _____</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
