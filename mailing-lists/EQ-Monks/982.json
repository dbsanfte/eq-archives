Now that role has changed, and its led to<br/>\n&gt;confusion and no small amount of bitterness. Given the over-crowding issue<br/>\n&gt;in most dungeons though, (75 in lower guk? _shudder_) the split-pull was<br/>\n&gt;becoming less important as &quot;just finding&quot; something to attack.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t realise that my little story was going to have people at each<br/>\nother&#39;s throats.  I was posting something that I hoped would re-instill<br/>\npride in our class, instead of everyone sitting around wringing their hand,<br/>\nhow can we as the player&#39;s redefine our place in the s about how useless we<br/>\nare as a class.  There are many intelligent people on this list, most of<br/>\nyou are probably smarter than I am.  Many of you have been playing the game<br/>\nand this class longer than I have.  I suppose the situation is much akin to<br/>\nthe role of children and parents.  Since one of the roles of children in<br/>\nsociety is to question the way things are, I  would like to propose a<br/>\nsersious intellectual discussion of the situation.  Lets use the following<br/>\nquestion as that basis:<br/>\n<br/>\nGiven Verant&#39;s change in the Feign Death skill, what can we as players do<br/>\nto change our role or our preceived role in the game, based on game mechanics?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe rules:<br/>\n1.  Everyones opinion matters<br/>\n2.  No flaming or personal attacks<br/>\n3.  Quitting the game, playing Asheron&#39;s call, or starting new characters<br/>\nare not viable answers.<br/>\n<br/>\nLets the fun begin.<br/>\n<br/>\nShando, 15th circle of the  Silent fist Clan<br/>\nBertoxxolous</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
