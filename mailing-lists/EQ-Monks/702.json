I do not believe variant is<br/>\nconsidering these. Incidentally someone on this list recently commented<br/>\nthat the reason for the POF level cap wa that Variant was fed up with<br/>\ntwinking - well this is just simply not so. The PoF or rather - corpse<br/>\nrecovery from the PoF was taking up FAR too much of the GM and Guide time.<br/>\nAs a result, to cut down on the number of &quot;Can you help me get my corpse<br/>\nout of mr. Caszic thules toe nail&quot; requests, they cut donw on the number<br/>\nof peopl going to teh POF who didn&#39;t belong there.<br/>\n<br/>\n4)Buying stuff with justly earned money is NOT twinking. Anything that you<br/>\ncan buy with money is not terribly good or rare (from a levle 35 point of<br/>\nview of course). So you have two platinum Black pearls rings? So what you<br/>\nare walking around in full mesh - maybe afew lupine armor.  These are all<br/>\nthings that you can buy/ earn fairly easily at your level.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaveing a Flowing balck sash, mask of the Deciver and Dwarven work boots<br/>\nIS twinking however!  These are very hard to get and are usually trade<br/>\nonly items. You CAN NEVER<br/>\nearn enough money in teh game to buy a Flowing balck sash. NO one who is<br/>\nable to get one would be willing to sell one for cash - UNLESS THEY WERER<br/>\nTRYING TO &quot;TWINK&quot; you. Very high levle items are TRADE only. The reason<br/>\nfor this is obvious: Cash is really and trully worthless. What give<br/>\nplatinum its value is the stuff you can buy with it in town/other<br/>\nplayers.  For high levle items that are rare like Ghoulbane for example,<br/>\nor box of abu kar or the flowing black sash, no amount of csh can<br/>\nadequately compensate you for the tiem you spent CAMPING for these items.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo no you are not a twink and have ing alot of cash doesn t make you a<br/>\ntwink.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mon, 20 Sep 1999, Dizzy J. wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Dizzy J.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dizzyj@...\">dizzyj@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Mon, 20 Sep 1999, Imari J.

What connotates twinking?  is it buying stuff?  I bought<br/>\n&gt; my mesh, am I a twink?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m lvl 19, and I made 500pp yesterday.  If I buy something nice with it,<br/>\n&gt; am I a twink?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
