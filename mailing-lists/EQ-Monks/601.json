Point well taken. Let me try to re-phrase and remain a calmer, more<br/>\n&gt;productive Praelor =).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Does twinking affect more than the twinked? IMHO yes it does. My PoF <br/>\n&gt;example<br/>\n&gt;illustrates that, even though someone has pointed out an alternate <br/>\n&gt;reasoning<br/>\n&gt;on why the level restriction was put into place (I wont go into a debate on<br/>\n&gt;that as it is a different subject altogether. Suffice it to say that the<br/>\n&gt;alternate reasoning was just as valid as mine and I agree with it).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My stance is not one of jealousy or envy. If it were, I would have my full<br/>\n&gt;shiverback tonight. I am in a guild with lvl 35+ members who had invited me<br/>\n&gt;a number of times into PoF with them for Shiverback before it was closed <br/>\n&gt;off<br/>\n&gt;to me. Each time I had declined. I knew I was not ready for such a venture.<br/>\n&gt;They have invited me to the depths of Lower Guk, and again I have declined.<br/>\n&gt;Soon I will be ready for Guk, and then and only then will I go. Do I want<br/>\n&gt;the azure sleeves and serp bracers? Absolutely. Will I buy them if I get an<br/>\n&gt;opportunity? Definitely. Would I accept one as a gift? Perhaps. It would<br/>\n&gt;depend upon who it was coming from. There is a thin line between the<br/>\n&gt;occasional gift and outright twinking. A full suit of Shiverback at lvl 19<br/>\n&gt;is not a gift. A BP necklace at lvl 19 could be. Would I take Praelor and <br/>\n&gt;go<br/>\n&gt;out and buy a full suit of steel plate (or whatever.. I don&#39;t know armors<br/>\n&gt;much outside what monks can wear) for a new cleric I was starting? Not a<br/>\n&gt;chance. And yet I have a friend who did just that. And did it while he owed<br/>\n&gt;me 100 plat! That is the selfishness I refer to. And that is the type of<br/>\n&gt;behavior that reflects upon all monks. When you think back to last weekend,<br/>\n&gt;do you first remember what a grand time you had in that group in Aviaks, or<br/>\n&gt;do you first remember that &lt;expletive deleted&gt; who did nothing but steal<br/>\n&gt;everyone&#39;s kills in Pickclaws all night? Do you remember the fun<br/>\n&gt;conversation you had with that little gnome on the boat to Butcherblock, or<br/>\n&gt;do you remember that blue con in Solusek running around in full rubicite <br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;duel wielding 2 Ykesha (or whatever that sword is called) shouting for <br/>\n&gt;help?<br/>\n&gt;People tend to remember negative experiences first, negative impressions<br/>\n&gt;first. I personally have never grouped with someone who was obviously a<br/>\n&gt;twink, and have removed myself from groups when one would join. I do not<br/>\n&gt;wish to be associated with that type of selfish attitude, as I think it<br/>\n&gt;looks bad for all those who are associated with it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I know there is no stopping twinking. And believe it or not, I don&#39;t get <br/>\n&gt;mad<br/>\n&gt;in game about it. I have developed a definite rp attitude and opinion<br/>\n&gt;towards the twink. More often than not I chuckle softly to myself and go my<br/>\n&gt;merry way, avoiding the issue in-game entirely and knowing that this poor<br/>\n&gt;lvl 15 in full steel will perish in the oasis just as many times as I did <br/>\n&gt;in<br/>\n&gt;woven and mesh. But OOC I will be as vociferous and adamantly against<br/>\n&gt;twinking as my nerves will allow me =).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;And now for a little fun =)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hamlet, the Twink of Norrath<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;To twink, or not to twink, that is the question,<br/>\n&gt;Whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer<br/>\n&gt;The slings and arrows of outrageous demons<br/>\n&gt;Or take gifts amongst a sea of friends,<br/>\n&gt;And by opposing, confuse them, to die to twink<br/>\n&gt;No more, and by a twink, to say we end<br/>\n&gt;The heartache, and the thousand nat&#39;ral shocks<br/>\n&gt;That flesh is heir to; Tis a attitude<br/>\n&gt;Devout to be wished to die than twink,.<br/>\n&gt;To twink, perchance to die; Aye there&#39;s the rub,<br/>\n&gt;For in that death of twink what eyes may come<br/>\n&gt;When we have shuffled off this mortal coil<br/>\n&gt;Must give us pause, there&#39;s the respect<br/>\n&gt;That makes mockery of so long life.<br/>\n&gt;For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,<br/>\n&gt;The demons claw, the high level&#39;d costume,<br/>\n&gt;the pangs of envied gear, the lawless delay,<br/>\n&gt;The insolence of office, and the spurns<br/>\n&gt;Of the patient merit him unworthy that takes<br/>\n&gt;Before his time a suit of gleaming rubicite.<br/>\n&gt;Who would these black pearls bear,<br/>\n&gt;To eat and sleep under a pamper&#39;d life<br/>\n&gt;But then dread possible death in<br/>\n&gt;The undiscovered country from who&#39;s corpse<br/>\n&gt;No armor returns, puzzles the will,<br/>\n&gt;And makes us rather bear that gear we have,<br/>\n&gt;Than fly to others that we cannot ourselves obtain.<br/>\n&gt;Lack of conscience does make Twinkers of us all.<br/>\n&gt;And thus the natural hue of evolution<br/>\n&gt;Is sickly ore with the pale cast of fire emeralds<br/>\n&gt;And enterprises of great pitch and moment<br/>\n&gt;With this regard, their currents turn awry<br/>\n&gt;And loose the name of action.

It is about taking pride in actually <br/>\n&gt;earning<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  gear I wear and knowing that what I have, I got for myself, whether by<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  earning coin enough to buy it or by venturing and slaying the beast <br/>\n&gt;that<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  carries it. I got it. I did not have it handed to me on a silver <br/>\n&gt;platter<br/>\n&gt; &gt; by<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  some high level friend who already has no problem getting as many as he<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  wants.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  Kind of like that spoiled rich kid in high school who was driving the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  Corvette. Sure he looks cool, but you know damn well he didn&#39;t pay for <br/>\n&gt;it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; or<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  the insurance that comes with it. Would I like to own a vette? you bet.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  Would I take one if my folks offered it to me? hell no. All a matter of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; self<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  pride vs. selfishness &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  Jealousy. Who cares what else anyone has, simply because they had it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; handed<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to them? If you are essentially concerned with what you&#39;ve earned, then<br/>\n&gt; &gt; why<br/>\n&gt; &gt; does what others have bother you so much? It sounds like envy, and it at<br/>\n&gt; &gt; best, reactive, rather than proactive. Bottled up ressentiment <br/>\n&gt;expressing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; itself.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  I am not twinked. Everything I have, I have earned. But the fact that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; someone else has not is irrelevant to me (unless I am harmed by it, as <br/>\n&gt;in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; PoF example someone gave earlier.) Be proud of what you&#39;ve earned, and <br/>\n&gt;do<br/>\n&gt; &gt; your best to have fun.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  Just my thoughts on this matter... And btw, Praelor, I have enjoyed <br/>\n&gt;many<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; your thoughtful posts.
