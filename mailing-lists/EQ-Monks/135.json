Around<br/>\nthere though, i headed off to Guk, bound to grobb (use sneak to get out<br/>\npast the guards), and have been there almost exclusively for the past<br/>\nmonth and half.  I could do pretty well there in or out of a group there<br/>\nfor a while, but around 24 or 25 it became very hard again to do much<br/>\nwithout a good sized party.  Now I just made 28 and it really does seem<br/>\nthat I am disproportionately meaner than I was 1 or 2 levels ago.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAt 30 we get flying kick, and I think it will make us considerably more<br/>\npowerful than we are the few levels before.  I&#39;ve seen monks and<br/>\nwarriors at high levels (40 or so) and the monks seem to do considerably<br/>\nmore damage that the warriors, but on the other hand, the monks get hit<br/>\nalot harder than the warriors.  Already, my punches are doing more<br/>\ndamage than what i&#39;ve seen level 40 warriors do.  Once I accidentally<br/>\nstole a kill from a party much higher than me when the fight was<br/>\nobviously won and their spellcasters laid back.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIm hoping that after 30, with all of our attack skills learned, the road<br/>\nahead will be more steady instead of having the jumps after gaining<br/>\nskills like feign (and i hope flying kick).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\tScott P [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sprigge@...\">sprigge@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tFriday, July 09, 1999 1:39 PM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Monk@onelist.com\">EQ_Monk@onelist.com</a>; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject:\t[EQ-Monks] When and why do monks become such a<br/>\n&gt; powerhouse?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have heard numerous times on this list &quot;just wait till you hit lvl<br/>\n&gt; 30, that&#39;s when monks come into their own&quot; and similar type messages.�<br/>\n&gt; My question is, what&#39;s so special about lvl 30?� Is that just the<br/>\n&gt; point at which our multiple punches + special attacks catch up with<br/>\n&gt; other tanks and their best weapons?<br/>\n&gt; �<br/>\n&gt; Also, I have heard ppl�talk about being in a lull or hitting a really<br/>\n&gt; tough level.� 2 comments questions about this:<br/>\n&gt; �<br/>\n&gt; 1)� I just hit 15 and I have not had anything similar to this yet.� Is<br/>\n&gt; it just a result of playing a character for a long time (probably<br/>\n&gt; pretty intensely too)?� It seems to me that there shouldn&#39;t really be<br/>\n&gt; any &quot;tough&quot; levels, just tough areas or tough monsters for a certain<br/>\n&gt; level.� ie, some blue monsters are alot tougher than others at certain<br/>\n&gt; lvls.� If you are in an area where all the blues are kicking your<br/>\n&gt; butt, maybe just move somewhere else for a while where the exp. giving<br/>\n&gt; monsters are not as tough for you.� Just an idea, seems to have worked<br/>\n&gt; for me so far - any comments?<br/>\n&gt; �<br/>\n&gt; 2)� Are there any of these lulls after 30?� Or is it really some<br/>\n&gt; magical threshhold that we just kick butt after that lvl?<br/>\n&gt; �<br/>\n&gt; �<br/>\n&gt; Anyway, I absolutely love playing my monk so far, and I&#39;m not even as<br/>\n&gt; good a tank as a warrior.� It&#39; just alot of fun being able to pummel<br/>\n&gt; things with my fists and seeing (now that I&#39;m 15) 3 sets of punches<br/>\n&gt; for 14 and then my special attack for 13 - man, that is so awesome.�<br/>\n&gt; Sort of bored here at work today, just looking for some new<br/>\n&gt; conversation pieces :)<br/>\n&gt; �<br/>\n&gt; Looking forward to lots of cool thoughts/ideas/comments,<br/>\n&gt; �<br/>\n&gt; Fistar, lvl 15 monk, Tarrew Marr </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
