On Fennin Ro Bodhi (The First EVER lvl 50 monk,<br/>\nLeader of Dragoon of A.....(sorry bod i cna&#39;t remember))  Anyways we have<br/>\ndone MANY Nagafen and Vox adventures and he is pretty much ther eason why.<br/>\nHe is able to pull out those Fire/Ice Giants in a steady pace so that we can<br/>\nhandle them easily.  I feel i have something to look forward to when i get<br/>\nmy monk 20 levels higher.  Then my guild won&#39;t have to depend on the<br/>\nDragoons for so much stuff (heh).<br/>\n<br/>\nMonks, Rogues, Warriors, none of these classes are made to really solo<br/>\n(although rogues should be able to) They need groups, in groups their skills<br/>\nare magnified by such an amazing degree it is beyond comprehension.  If a<br/>\nMonk has a smart cleric or shaman he can take mobs on that are 5-7 levels<br/>\nhigher then him, just by being constantly buffed and healed.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople that complain about monks being sorry were just not made to play<br/>\nmonks they should play a necro or mage or Wiz (good solo classes) So give<br/>\nthem a spin fellas!<br/>\n<br/>\nThats all!!<br/>\n<br/>\nBroy of The Mystical Order on Fennin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
