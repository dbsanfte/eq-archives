Last night while hunting in<br/>\n&gt;Unrest, my party found ourselves overwhelmed by a train (in Unrest?<br/>\n&gt;Unbelievable! hehe). Well... I FD&#39;d successfully, and was lying there for<br/>\n&gt;perhaps 15 seconds, when in comes a dark boned skel and walks straight up<br/>\n </span></blockquote>to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;me and clobbers me!

Any creature with a<br/>\n&gt;number lower than the one generated is fooled. Any creature with a higher<br/>\n&gt;number is not. This would explain the dark boned coming in the door and<br/>\n&gt;whacking me. The first number generated was high enough to fool the 3 dry<br/>\n&gt;bones and the 4 carrion ghouls, but not enough to fool the Dark Boned, a<br/>\n&gt;higher level MoB than the others. He knew I was faking it and hit me<br/>\n&gt;(causing the others to wail on me as well). The 2nd FD generated a number<br/>\n&gt;that was able to fool them all.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Now I am not a programmer or anything, but this would be similar to a dice<br/>\n&gt;roll in DD or Palladium (for example) table top games for those of you<br/>\n&gt;familiar with them. There is a set minimum and a set maximum number, and<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;level of the feign falls randomly somewhere in that range. Maybe?
