If I wanted to hear whining and ranting, I&#39;d go read EQVault <br/>\nmessage boards.    I liked the stories, questions and roleplaying stuff I <br/>\nheard when I first joined the list.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, does anyone think the new silk armor is pretty cool for low-mid <br/>\nlevel monks?  Sure, it makes woven outdated, but it definitely makes <br/>\ntailoring a viable trade skill again.    I hope someday it ends up being <br/>\nlike jewelry is now.   Ah, it only took verant six months to add the <br/>\nremaining tailor patterns.   Maybe smiths will be able to craft other armor <br/>\nand weapons next!<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and on the subject of what is an appropriate amount of money for a level <br/>\n19 monk (someone posted they had 500pp at that level):  I had 200pp saved up <br/>\nat level 18, and I really didn&#39;t try to make money.   Certain areas <br/>\n(gargoyle isle, beholder) are very very profitable.   Had I been trying to <br/>\namass wealth, I could have easily had 500pp by now.<br/>\n<br/>\nDornn, Level 18 Silent Fist, Brell Serilis server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
