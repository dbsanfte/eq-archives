Trust me, I know the fear zone was<br/>\nin the game well before it was released. If you do a fresh install, you&#39;ll<br/>\nstill see those zone files marked fear. You downloaded updated versions of<br/>\nsome files, but not the entire zone. Go into your EQ folder, see those big<br/>\n5-6 meg pak files? Or the 2-3 meg S3D files? You never downloaded those,<br/>\nwhich my estimate is contain the graphic files for each zone. (I say this,<br/>\nbecause whenever they made a bunch of graphic updates in beta, we had to<br/>\ndownload all those files again. ugh.) What you downloaded is an XMI file,<br/>\nthe little 90k or so files with zone information.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason it&#39;s not feasible to implement new graphics is, it would require<br/>\nyou to download all those nice little graphic files again, and while people<br/>\non fast connections wouldn&#39;t mind, no sane modem user is going to download<br/>\nall those huge files, especially when 120k other people are also trying to<br/>\ndownload them. I don&#39;t know why they can&#39;t do it as a separate download, for<br/>\nthose who want new graphics, or perhaps rework graphics in the original<br/>\nzones and put them on the expansion pack on another CD.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my two cents, I wish it wasn&#39;t this way - I&#39;d really like to see some<br/>\ncool variations in characters and armor. One look at EQ and you feel more<br/>\nlike you&#39;re playing EverClone. At least monks have their own texture - that<br/>\nlooks cool - with their newbie shirt that nobody else has.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlackHorse<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: David Bryson [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dbbryson@...\">dbbryson@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, August 27, 1999 9:41 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: Monk Loot and Modifications (was Re: [EQ-Monks] An idea for<br/>\nthe slow day)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: David Bryson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dbbryson@...\">dbbryson@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 08:22 PM 8/27/99 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Ezra Harrington &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tvar@...\">tvar@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;It&#39;s a little late to change the looks of characters (i.e.: adding the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>blue<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;look to monks with a mesh tunic, etc) because it would require a total<br/>\n&gt;&gt;rework of the art files.

If you ever watch your downloads, you<br/>\nwould have seen files marked &#39;fear&#39;. They did this in multiple downloads<br/>\nand patches over a period of about a month or so. So it would be feasable<br/>\nto implement missing or enhanced graphics over a period of time with an<br/>\nactivation que in the last download. Personally I would like to see more of<br/>\na clothing differentiation on every class in the game. To me this is<br/>\nimportant for the reason that if I saw a human Paladin and a Human Shadow<br/>\nNight standing side by side, I would not be able to tell the difference.<br/>\nWhat would be good is to have a distinct body style for every class in<br/>\nevery race. Such as if you chose a Barbarian Warrior over a Barbarian<br/>\nShaman, he/she might be wearing a blue Kilt as a newbie instead of a red<br/>\none. Each clas should have a distinct pattern in which clothing and armor<br/>\nis represented on them. The same idea with weaponry as well. But these<br/>\nthings would best go into the new addition. So those with the newer program<br/>\nwould see huge differences, while those with the existing one will see<br/>\nthings much as they are now. *that would help motivate sales for Verant, so<br/>\nI think they might be interested*(wink) As far as magic items..well....I<br/>\nactually would like to have seen a pair of gloves that raised attack like a<br/>\nweapon such as if it had claws, it should feel like them on a mob. That<br/>\ncould easily be implemented on existing items such as Lupine Gloves. I<br/>\nwould like to see more versions of the Journeyman boots. Let&#39;s face it, I<br/>\nknow they want to keep us in the game, but I don&#39;t know of anything that<br/>\ncan be done about camping except make the item a little more available.<br/>\nSure that defeats the purpose of rare items, but these should be a<br/>\nnecessity. But then Shamans and Druids would whine about not feeling<br/>\nimportant anymore...so...whatever. :o) But actually the last thing would be<br/>\nkeeping Monks in the Sacred Tradition of harnessing inner Chi through<br/>\nmeditation. Meaning, I would  like to see monks get regeneration like<br/>\nTrolls have, except maybe make it while sitting only to keep the balance.<br/>\nMOnks are supposed to be masters of the human form, so this would fit in<br/>\nnicely. To me that would be balanced enough. It isn&#39;t anything overly<br/>\nmajor. Just a little shave off the down time to make Monks a little more<br/>\nMonkish.<br/>\nOh and by the way, it is spelled Numchuks, as in Num-Chaku sticks. :o)<br/>\nThe original soon to be Master Quan of Tribunal.<br/>\n------------------------ ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;Show your ONElist SPIRIT!<br/>\n&gt;&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/tshirt2\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/tshirt2</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt;With a new ONElist SHIRT available through our website.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nCongratulations to Susan Davis!<br/>\nONElistï¿½s final FRIENDS&FAMILY WINNER!<br/>\nStay tuned for exciting new contests, sweepstakes & more at ONElist!<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
