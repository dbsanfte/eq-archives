But still,<br/>\nPCs win simply because of numbers and tactics.  Unfortunately,<br/>\nnumbers will not always win because of hardware constraints<br/>\nand tactics are systematically being made illegal by Verant.<br/>\nBasically this game will come down to pushing a button or 2<br/>\nevery few seconds without the need for thinking.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Steve Danuser &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:danu@...\">danu@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yet, somehow, PC&#39;s always win. Always. There is not a single mob in the<br/>\ngame that players haven&#39;t beaten or will beat very soon. Not one.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust because you can&#39;t do it solo doesn&#39;t mean the game is unbalanced. If<br/>\nyou could solo Vox, teaming up with just one other person would make the<br/>\ngame completely boring.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo mobs have, in a roleplaying sense, unfair advantages? Sure. So what?<br/>\nPC&#39;s beat them anyway. Verant has had to make mobs tougher, in fact,<br/>\nbecause players were besting them too easily.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
