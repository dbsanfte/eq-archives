The pally had been<br/>\nlugging it around, and fighting with it, and gave me 15pp out of his sense<br/>\nof honor and duty. I have found that alot of people I group with are like<br/>\nthis. I have never asked for a split on the sale of loot, and rarely loot,<br/>\nif at all loot items myself. I only do if I am seeking a particular item.

I.e., when I was level 10ish or so I found<br/>\n&gt; that wearing a full suit of leather actually gave me more AC than trying<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; stay under 14 weight, but at level 23 each increase of 1 weight over 14<br/>\n&gt; yields a pretty nasty loss in AC.  My guess is the monk you asked about<br/>\n&gt; weight was probably at a lower level where indeed weight doesn&#39;t seem to<br/>\n&gt; matter that much.  Rest assured though, it starts to very quickly in the<br/>\n&gt; teens.  Like Praelor said, you really want to start trying to find<br/>\n&gt; woven/mesh to replace the leather asap.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Praelor, you got 15pp as a share of a full suit of bronze?  Ouch man, I<br/>\n&gt; think you got jobbed :)  Most of those pieces on E-Marr go for 20pp+ each.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In answer to the second original question, assuming Verant took the<br/>\n&gt; standard<br/>\n&gt; use of AC from RPG&#39;s time immemorial, AC generally affects your chance of<br/>\n&gt; being hit as well as how much damage you take when you do get hit.  You<br/>\n&gt; can<br/>\n&gt; test this by dueling a like-level friend with low AC, than having them<br/>\n&gt; wear<br/>\n&gt; all their armor and/or using a few AC buffs and dueling again.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hope that helps some,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; - Chai, Taunter of Happy Fun Ball (E-Marr)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; PS:  If loot is what&#39;s bumping your weight up, there are several pouches<br/>\n&gt; you<br/>\n&gt; can use that cut the weight by a % on items you put in them.  The easiest<br/>\n&gt; ones to get are probably the ones Nillipus loads (Rivervale/dale<br/>\n&gt; whatever),<br/>\n&gt; and I hear there&#39;s an orc in High Hold Pass that loads a nice one too.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; read you can actually use a large sewing kit as well (don&#39;t hit combine),<br/>\n&gt; but I haven&#39;t tested that one personally.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Robb Flynn [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:RobF@...\">RobF@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, July 06, 1999 6:14 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EQ-Monks] Weight<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Robb Flynn &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:RobF@...\">RobF@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Weight most definatley does AC. I make it a point when hunting in groups<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; just take the coin split. If you are worried about not getting decent<br/>\n&gt; coin,<br/>\n&gt; probably 75% of the time, when someone in my group runs off to sell, they<br/>\n&gt; come back and give me a little coin since I am not taking any loot. Last<br/>\n&gt; night, for example, a party member looted a full set of bronze in our<br/>\n&gt; course<br/>\n&gt; of adventuring. He sold the entire set to a player, turned around and gave<br/>\n&gt; me 15 plat.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As far as weight affecting atk, I have never seen anything official, but I<br/>\n&gt; do believe this happens. I think it also affects dex, but haven&#39;t had the<br/>\n&gt; chance to really look into it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I would recommend definately getting netted or woven armor if you can<br/>\n&gt; afford<br/>\n&gt; it. Too bad I didn&#39;t see this earlier, as I just upgraded to full mesh and<br/>\n&gt; gave away my full set of woven to a younger Brother.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Praelor<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From:\tBlizzard [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:blizzard15@...\">blizzard15@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sent:\tSunday, July 04, 1999 12:03 PM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Monk@onelist.com\">EQ_Monk@onelist.com</a>; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject:\t[EQ-Monks] Weight<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I have heard many people say that weight affects my ac, then I have also<br/>\n&gt; &gt; heard many that say that weight affects my chance of hitting. I was just<br/>\n&gt; &gt; starting to get rid of my leather armor for light patchwork or maybe<br/>\n&gt; just<br/>\n&gt; &gt; spend all my money on netted when I saw a monk wearing leather. When I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; asked him he said that weight doesn&#39;t matter at all for monks. Now, I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; usually have more weight than 14 and I find myself missing more then my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; other less bulbous monk counterparts. So, what&#39;s the truth does weight<br/>\n&gt; &gt; matter for us?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I also was wondering, does ac and atk mean the damage we take and do, or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the chance we have to get hit or hit.
