If a spell fails, you fizzle, if a feign fails, you &quot;fall to <br/>\nthe ground&quot;.  However, because you performed the skill perfectly doesn&#39;t <br/>\nmean that it will have it&#39;s affect.  A spell can be resisted (far to easily <br/>\nit seems : ) ), and monsters can sometimes see through feign death.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs your skill maxed?  My friend at 32nd level has his up to 167 and someone <br/>\nthat was 35th level that he was with was only in his 120s.  Even at 167, <br/>\nmonsters sometimes see though it (like Gorillas in Cazic-Thul).<br/>\n<br/>\nJason<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom:\tRobb Flynn [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:RobF@...\">RobF@...</a>]<br/>\nSent:\tThursday, July 15, 1999 6:21 AM<br/>\nTo:\t&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject:\tRE: [EQ-Monks] On how FD works<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Robb Flynn &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:RobF@...\">RobF@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n My question is now no longer why/ how did I die<br/>\nwith a successful feign, but rather if a monster &quot;sees thru&quot;<br/>\na successful feign, how the heck is that feign considered successful?<br/>\n<br/>\nPraelor</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
