A few exceptions like<br/>\n&quot;solitaire&quot;...  Computers came along and let us play games<br/>\ncompletely by ourselves.  But we for the most part find most of these<br/>\ngames not nearly as fun as games with other people..  Thus games<br/>\nlike DOOM and Warcraft II and Diablo, now UO and EQ and AC let us<br/>\nagain have social contact.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your friends suddenly do not allow you into your group because you are<br/>\nnot quite as powerful as before, then maybe you should look<br/>\nat that friendship and see if thats what it is.  Not too many<br/>\nof the people I call friends online give a hoot about my game power.<br/>\nJust like I always invite Joe, the worlds worst golf player to go<br/>\nwith us to play golf, real friends shouldn&#39;t care if you walked up<br/>\nand said flying kick was removed, you should still be immediately<br/>\ngrouped.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow the monk isn&#39;t suddenly instantly accepted into the group.  Well<br/>\nguess what, neither are bards (pre level 32).  Neither are wizards <br/>\n(unless you&#39;re going to hate), neither are warriors, neither are ...<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom the way you talk, monks are social rejects now because feign death<br/>\nisn&#39;t as powerful, and that just isn&#39;t so.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes it is more difficult, as you are not as useful, but every class<br/>\nhas their power tuned (nerfed or enhanced) occasionally, and if you<br/>\ncan&#39;t cpe with these kinds of changes, then I suggest you stop<br/>\nplaying EQ and join chat rooms to meet friends.  Verant can&#39;t put your<br/>\nability to make friends easily above the need to balance the game.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Goode, Jason&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JGoode@...\">JGoode@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hrmmm...no, if you give it more of a bit of intropection, that&#39;s not really<br/>\n&gt; true.  It&#39;s a different type of game than say, Heroes of Might and Magic,<br/>\n&gt; where this statement would be valid.  This type of game has a twist to it -<br/>\n&gt; the human social element.  That, I think, more than anything else is what<br/>\n&gt; elevates it beyond a game to many.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Humans are social creatures as a species.  We, as a species, have a deep and<br/>\n&gt; abiding need to interact with others.  In this way is how it (and any<br/>\n&gt; MMORPG) transcends being &quot;just a game&quot;.  It doesn&#39;t have anything to do with<br/>\n&gt; the code or the virtual mobs that you virtually slay, but rather the people<br/>\n&gt; beyond the icons with whom you will tend to build real relationships - often<br/>\n&gt; without realizing it.  Whether it&#39;s with your drinking buddies in a bar<br/>\n&gt; watching the game, going out dancing with your girlfriends, or sitting in<br/>\n&gt; the king room in Sol B, killing kobold and role-playing/BSing about your job<br/>\n&gt; in the down time, makes no difference.  Social interaction is still social<br/>\n&gt; interaction, regardless of the arena it takes place in.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If I had to speculate, I&#39;d say that the changes to feign death, or perhaps<br/>\n&gt; more accurately now, non-monks perceptions of monks due to the changes in<br/>\n&gt; feign death, negatively impact the ability of monks to continue to explore<br/>\n&gt; the social aspect of the game, i.e., difficulty getting into groups of<br/>\n&gt; strangers, thus not being able to share in a group activity and make new<br/>\n&gt; friends, etc., that is the most damaging aspect of what has transpired and<br/>\n&gt; the core root of the anger and outrage many monks express.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Just my thoughts...take them for that and nothing more.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Leikung<br/>\n&gt; Warrior-Poet<br/>\n&gt; Bristlebane<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Dave Gaines [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dave@...\">dave@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Thursday, December 16, 1999 9:09 AM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [EQ-Monks] Digest Number 122<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Dave Gaines &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dave@...\">dave@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; It should not be more than a game.
