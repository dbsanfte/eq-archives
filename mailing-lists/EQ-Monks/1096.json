You don&#39;t know me..you don&#39;t know my life you<br/>\ndon&#39;t know jack as far as I am concerned.  You are probably some stupid<br/>\ncollege student who thinks that everyone has a life outside of the<br/>\ngame.  Some of us choose not to and you know what??? I am happy that<br/>\nway.  I don&#39;t want to engage in the activities I did before EQ and you<br/>\nknow what else? its not your place to tell me or anyone else what they<br/>\nshould think or feel about EQ or to pass judgement on anyone for<br/>\nthinking the way they do about EQ.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for your post about that this was a list for information about<br/>\nmonks...blah blah blah...I don&#39;t think your orginal post had anything<br/>\nto do with monks at all! In fact if it did, I would not have responded<br/>\nwith such anger. So who are you to be telling me what to post here when<br/>\nyou don&#39;t follow the rules yourself!<br/>\n<br/>\nNow...don&#39;t bother to reply.  I have gotten some advice from a few of<br/>\nyou and the rest have whined about this that and the other thing.  What<br/>\never.  Welcome to the world of EQ. I got what I needed from those of<br/>\nyou who actually were kind enough to contribute to my questions and I<br/>\nthank you for it. I think that there is probably nothing else worth<br/>\nhearing on this list and so with that, I will be leaving the list...so<br/>\nyour flames won&#39;t be heard.<br/>\n<br/>\n/i Dave<br/>\n/em turns on her heel and walks out with her chin jutted out proudly<br/>\nignoring everything behind her.<br/>\n<br/>\nLeiah<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 9 months ago, at some date in the future, EQ will not exist.  I hope<br/>\n&gt; you have a contingency plan ready, because EQ is not life, or a way<br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; life, it is simply a game you enjoy together.  &gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; IF EQ was perfect, or something you&#39;ve been doing for tens of years<br/>\n&gt; and nothing had ever changed on it, then you would have a much better<br/>\n&gt; argument.  However we can clearly see that monks aren&#39;t being singled<br/>\n&gt; out, almost every class is being tuned every month.  This one was<br/>\n&gt; slightly major.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But enough is enough.  Shit happens and we adjust.  This mailing list<br/>\n&gt; is not about these kinds of posts or this kind of thread. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The purpose of this list is to distribute information about Monks to<br/>\n&gt; the players of EverQuest. Spoilers may be included so read at your<br/>\n&gt; own risk. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The purpose of this list is NOT to be a vent for your fustration.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nThousands of Stores.
