I&#39;m level 22nd monk from cazic thule <br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;was wondering where I should hunt.  I&#39;ve hunted gorge hounds for the last 3<br/>\n&gt;levels and I do not want to hunt avaiks due to the over crowded population.<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m fully decked out with serpentines/exe hoods/black pearl so i&#39;m rather<br/>\n&gt;strong for my level.  I guess what I&#39;m asking is that What level are<br/>\n&gt;gargoyles and what island are they on? and do they respawn fast? any <br/>\n&gt;trains?<br/>\n&gt;Can I solo?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, a nicely decked out level 22 could solo there.   The skeletons (level <br/>\n12 - 14?) and the gargoyles (level 18 - 20?) share the same spawn, but the <br/>\nspawn is pretty fast.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;Does anyone recomend Cazic thule? I friend of mine said it took her 2 hours<br/>\n&gt;to find a group(24thmage) and died/zoned many of times.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have seen warriors solo there, but mostly you need a good group.   <br/>\nEspecially someone who can root or snare.   Level 20 - 35 can hunt that zone <br/>\nassuming it&#39;s not packed (and it often is).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;Another question.  I have no boots. Leather is too heavy. They don&#39;t make<br/>\n&gt;mesh.  Anyone know where i can get good boots with low wieght?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I use cloth shoes, but I hear wolf fur slippers from Permafrost are good <br/>\nmonk shoes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Thanks for your time,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Bismatal Bumrusher 22nd Circle<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Dornn<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;                Free Games & Cash Prizes!<br/>\n&gt;  Gamesville - The World&#39;s Biggest & Best Game Show Site!<br/>\n&gt;&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/gamesville2\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/gamesville2</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
