Phido spawns anywhere from every 5 to every 15<br/>\nRen spawns. It is a long and frustrating camp, especially if you waited too<br/>\nlong like I did and get almost no experience from killing those foul beasts.<br/>\nIt took me a total of 8 - 9 hours last Saturday to get 2 Dareb heads (I had<br/>\na monk friend with me who needed all 3). I recommend that you do this in<br/>\nstages if you are like me and hate camping. Spend a day getting Dareb&#39;s<br/>\nhead, then come back in a week or so and spend a day getting Shen&#39;s head.<br/>\nGhanex is a regular spawn as far as I can tell, or at least he has been<br/>\nthere every single time I felt like killing him =)<br/>\n<br/>\nI also recommend for anyone 12-16 or 17 and interested in good exp and good<br/>\nloot to basically live in Paw. I sent a lvl 14 Bard friend there last night<br/>\nand he grouped with the 1 other person in the place and gained half a level<br/>\nand made 10pp in about 3 hours. And that is before selling the tunics and<br/>\nmasks he got.<br/>\n<br/>\nPraelor Dileasai<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\tDave Woomer [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dwoomer@...\">dwoomer@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tWednesday, August 18, 1999 5:34 AM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject:\t[EQ-Monks] Red Headband Quest<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Dave Woomer&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dwoomer@...\">dwoomer@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hello, brothers and sisters...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Just spent a long, frustrating night in Paw trying to get the head of<br/>\n&gt; Dareb.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve heard you get this item from High Shaman Phido, who is a rare spawn,<br/>\n&gt; who shows up in place of Shaman Ren&#39;Rexx on occasion.
