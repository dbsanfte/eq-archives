I will<br/>\ntry one more time before I give up.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince the feign death patch, has any high level monk been told &quot;No we don&#39;t<br/>\nwant you to group with us because you can&#39;t feign death pull&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;If I had to speculate, I&#39;d say that the changes to feign death, or perhaps<br/>\n&gt;more accurately now, non-monks perceptions of monks due to the changes in<br/>\n&gt;feign death, negatively impact the ability of monks to continue to explore<br/>\n&gt;the social aspect of the game, i.e., difficulty getting into groups of<br/>\n&gt;strangers, thus not being able to share in a group activity and make new<br/>\n&gt;friends, etc., that is the most damaging aspect of what has transpired and<br/>\n&gt;the core root of the anger and outrage many monks express.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Just my thoughts...take them for that and nothing more.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Leikung<br/>\n&gt;Warrior-Poet<br/>\n&gt;Bristlebane </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
