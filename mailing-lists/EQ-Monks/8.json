I was hoping some of the geniuses on this list might<br/>\nbe able to help.<br/>\n\tHe was in the Freeport bank while another player was beating up on<br/>\none of the guards there (the corrupt one, I believe).  Being the cleric<br/>\nthat he is, he healed him up and then left.  Apparently - for whatever<br/>\nreason - this other player was not able to kill the guard (what happened to<br/>\nhim is unknown).  How do I know this?  Well, the next time my friend<br/>\nstopped by the bank, this guard attacked him on sight and my friend was<br/>\nforced to kill him in self-defense.<br/>\n\tAs a result of this, he is now KOS by the Freeport guards and<br/>\ncannot get anywhere near the gates without being jumped.  We&#39;ve tried any<br/>\nnumber of things to try to raise his faction with the guards, but nothing<br/>\nseems to work... Slaughtered orcs of various flavors (including those in<br/>\nHigh Hold and Qeynos), tried a bunch of quests, etc.  So far nothing has<br/>\nworked... We don&#39;t believe that it&#39;s a matter of simply &#39;killing enough of<br/>\nthem&#39; as we&#39;ve taken note of the faction hits and bonuses accrued as a<br/>\nresult of killing these things, and it seems as if none of them affect the<br/>\n&#39;normal&#39; Freeport Guards.<br/>\n\tIs there anybody here who might have any suggestions?<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nAaron Braunstein<br/>\nPacific Data Management, Inc.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aaron_braunstein@...\">aaron_braunstein@...</a>&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
