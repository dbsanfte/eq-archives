","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1452984967\">Greetings all...<br/>\n<br/>\nThought I would add a bit to the FD topic. Last night while hunting in<br/>\nUnrest, my party found ourselves overwhelmed by a train (in Unrest?<br/>\nUnbelievable! hehe). Well... I FD&#39;d successfully, and was lying there for<br/>\nperhaps 15 seconds, when in comes a dark boned skel and walks straight up to<br/>\nme and clobbers me! I jump up, nearly dead, and FD again, successful again.<br/>\nEverything stops attacking. Party escapes with only 1 casualty, and I have a<br/>\nmere 7 hps left.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps the FD, when successful, generates a &quot;number&quot;. Any creature with a<br/>\nnumber lower than the one generated is fooled. Any creature with a higher<br/>\nnumber is not. This would explain the dark boned coming in the door and<br/>\nwhacking me. The first number generated was high enough to fool the 3 dry<br/>\nbones and the 4 carrion ghouls, but not enough to fool the Dark Boned, a<br/>\nhigher level MoB than the others. He knew I was faking it and hit me<br/>\n(causing the others to wail on me as well). The 2nd FD generated a number<br/>\nthat was able to fool them all.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I am not a programmer or anything, but this would be similar to a dice<br/>\nroll in DD or Palladium (for example) table top games for those of you<br/>\nfamiliar with them. There is a set minimum and a set maximum number, and the<br/>\nlevel of the feign falls randomly somewhere in that range. Maybe? Perhaps?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat say you to this possibility?<br/>\n<br/>\nPraelor Dileasai<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\tClint Mitchell [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mitche@...\">mitche@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tFriday, July 30, 1999 11:44 AM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject:\tRe: [EQ-Monks] FEIGN DEATH FAILURE!!!!!!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Clint Mitchell &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mitche@...\">mitche@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Let me know if you all have noticed any difference.
