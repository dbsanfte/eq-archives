My weight<br/>\nis 14, and thats only because I carry enuf plat to hold me over food/drink wise<br/>\nfor life.  If you have read the recent posts, you would see that no one seems<br/>\nto like agility, and say strength and AC is the way to go..... Im not saying<br/>\nthis is true, just what I have noticed, I really wish AGI had as much of an<br/>\naffect that I had hoped, with 152 as my current, but it does not, (I still dont<br/>\nsee why Dodge/block are not affected by agility, they really should be, and<br/>\nit would save me from having to trash my monks full plat jewlery)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
