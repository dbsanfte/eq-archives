I have<br/>\n&gt; maxed out the skill at 17th level.  This is not an exaggeration.<br/>\nYesterday<br/>\n&gt; I was soloing scarecrows in West Karana.  I was earning a little Xp and<br/>\n&gt; practicing my newly aquired FD skill, which did work,  I used mend 4 times<br/>\n&gt; in about a 2 hour period of time.  It worked once, failed twice, and<br/>\n&gt; worsened my wounds the last time, which killed me when I had a white<br/>\n&gt; scarecrow on its last legs.  My character basically committed suicide at<br/>\n&gt; the point where he was going to win.  As I said, it seems I have the worse<br/>\n&gt; luck with Mend.  Does any one else have this problem or am I just the<br/>\n&gt; victim of bad numbers?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Shando, 17th circle, Silent Fist Clan<br/>\n&gt; Bertoxxulous<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Get great offers on top-notch products that match your interests!<br/>\n&gt; Sign up for eLerts at:<br/>\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/elerts1\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/elerts1</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
