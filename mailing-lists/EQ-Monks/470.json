Oasis has never been very kind to me, but<br/>\n&gt;perhaps I need to give it a chance.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The caiman/croc side of Oasis is ok, but it&#39;s usually so crowded.   Try <br/>\nhunting the other side (orc side) of the zone with a good group.   I am <br/>\nlevel 15, and hunting there is going great!  All of the &quot;an&quot; orc warriors <br/>\nare blue or white, orc clerics are blue and white.   AND since my group <br/>\ncontains a level 18 mage, we can even take down the &quot;a&quot; orc warriors (Level <br/>\n20 mob).   There are more orcs than you can shake a stick at, plus the loot <br/>\nis way better than fighting crocs.   Also, on Brell at least, there is VERY <br/>\nlow competition for kills.  I think at best I see one other group hunting <br/>\nthe ENTIRE side of the zone.<br/>\n<br/>\nNormally we set up camp on a little ledge somewhere near the SW corner of <br/>\nthe zone.  We more or less constant kill blue mobs, with the occasional <br/>\nwhite or red thrown in.<br/>\n<br/>\nDornn, Level 15 monk, Brell Serilis</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
