Yeah, baby!), Brell Serilis, currently<br/>\n </span></blockquote> hunting Gargoyles in the Ocean of Tears.&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThank god you mentioned gargoyles.  I&#39;m level 22nd monk from cazic thule and<br/>\nwas wondering where I should hunt.  I&#39;ve hunted gorge hounds for the last 3<br/>\nlevels and I do not want to hunt avaiks due to the over crowded population.<br/>\nI&#39;m fully decked out with serpentines/exe hoods/black pearl so i&#39;m rather<br/>\nstrong for my level.  I guess what I&#39;m asking is that What level are<br/>\ngargoyles and what island are they on? and do they respawn fast? any trains?<br/>\nCan I solo?<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone recomend Cazic thule? I friend of mine said it took her 2 hours<br/>\nto find a group(24thmage) and died/zoned many of times.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother question.  I have no boots. Leather is too heavy. They don&#39;t make<br/>\nmesh.  Anyone know where i can get good boots with low wieght?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your time,<br/>\n<br/>\nBismatal Bumrusher 22nd Circle</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
