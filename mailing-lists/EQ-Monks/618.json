That&#39;s boring. I get my enjoyment by Killing mobs.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;what I like to do. Destroy, kill, rape, pillage and plunder. That is what I<br/>\n </span></blockquote>want<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;to &quot;role-play&quot;.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ok - fair enough.  So you kill the non-camped mobs?  Where are they?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&quot;But others have, repeatedly in pervious posts. They don&#39;t use words like<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&quot;I<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;don&#39;t enjoy...&quot; or &quot;I shouldn&#39;t&quot;, they say things like &quot;They shouldn&#39;t...&quot;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>or<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&quot;they won&#39;t enjoy their time&quot;. Those words a projections of their thoughts<br/>\n </span></blockquote>and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;beliefs of how others should play. When I saw &quot;I&quot;, I&#39;m referring to those<br/>\n </span></blockquote>who<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;have who have items given to them by higher level friends because that&#39;s<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;only perspective I can speak for, the perspective I play from.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again, fair enough.  I think perhaps the peculiar symantecs of American<br/>\nEnglish is working against us - and I think those were intended to be<br/>\nsweeping, broad statements, not to be applied on a person by person basis.<br/>\nWhen I ask a mechanic what needs to be done to my car, he would probably say<br/>\n&quot;You&quot; instead of &quot;I&quot;.  Unfortunate, but most people have picked up on the<br/>\n&quot;You&quot; and &quot;I&quot; switch.  Yes, perhaps the ideal sentence would begin with &quot;If<br/>\nthat were me...&quot;  It&#39;s certainly intended, at least that was the impression<br/>\nI got on most of the posts on the subject.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&quot;I&#39;m annoyed, more than anything at those who constantly rail against the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>game<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;choices I make. Let me play my game, you play yours, and quit whining about<br/>\n&gt;twinked characters.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s where we completely seperate.  On message board after message board,<br/>\nif someone has a complaint, no matter how valid the &quot;targets&quot; of the<br/>\ncomplaint basically say shut up, stop whining.  It&#39;s not whining!  It would<br/>\nbe the same for me to tell you to stop whining - you have simple complaints.<br/>\nDegrading the conversation by calling everything that is not the lovechild<br/>\nof your thoughts &quot;whining&quot; doesn&#39;t advance the conversation.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&quot;Heading for the Dark Side Luke? And I thought you were against<br/>\n </span></blockquote>twinking....&quot;<br/>\nActually it was an attempt at humor to keep the conversation light :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&quot;You miss the point. I need those items to do what I want to do in the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>game. Like<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I said, I would play the game naked if I could, but I can&#39;t. I can&#39;t play<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Kane<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;from Kung-Fu because the game system is setup where I need those items.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;blame me, I didn&#39;t make the rules, Verant did.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;As for the rest of that, its not the items that matter to me, its the<br/>\n&gt;interaction with those players around me that I enjoy, not spending my time<br/>\n&gt;hunting down items. I opt out of the loot cycle as often as possible,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>letting my<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;teammates take the items. If you need those items to focus your group play,<br/>\n&gt;perhaps your the one who should (and I quote) &#39;click &quot;Delete&quot;&#39;.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ok - we&#39;re going to label the first paragraph there &quot;A&quot; and the second &quot;B&quot;.<br/>\nIn paragraph &quot;A&quot; you state that you need those items to do what you want to<br/>\ndo in the game, but in &quot;B&quot; tell me that if I need the items I should delete.<br/>\nHuh?  Yes, to keep up with my group, unfortunately I have to go get better<br/>\narmor and jewelry.  Since I didn&#39;t have someone give me Serp Bracers or<br/>\nPlatinum Jewelry, I guess I&#39;m going to have to either make the money<br/>\nhonestly or camp the spawn.  And my group is in the same boat.  If my<br/>\nPaladin friend needs something, then we go get it for him.  If the<br/>\nCleric.... ditto.  That&#39;s a little bit of adventuring.  I&#39;m glad you have a<br/>\nsugar daddy giving you the equipment.  One less person waiting around for<br/>\nit.  And you&#39;re not fooling anyone with that loot cycle stuff - I think<br/>\nalmost every monk out there is selective about looting.
