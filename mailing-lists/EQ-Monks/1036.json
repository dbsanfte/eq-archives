I have tried to play my character that way.  I have managed to<br/>\nsqurriel away 250 pp.  I figured that would handle most of my expenses for<br/>\nthe foreseeable future.  I buy muffins and water for food and drink.  All<br/>\nof my magic tiems have been given to me or looted off of drops.  However, I<br/>\nhave reached an impasse.  Someone last night was auctioning off Serpent<br/>\nbracers.  When I asked how much, I was shocked to hear 800 pp.  I guess<br/>\nthat I am going to have to break down and loot everything or hope that I<br/>\nstumble across a raqre drop.  I am not going to be able to afford anything<br/>\nbetter if I don&#39;t do so.  I think it is sad, that if I am going to be a<br/>\nsuccessful adventurer, I am going to have to be like the rest of the money<br/>\ngrubbing classes:  Rogues, Shadow Knights,  Warriors, Druids, Shamans,<br/>\nRangers, Bards,  Enchanters, Wizards, Magicians, Necromancers,  holy<br/>\nClerics and pious Paladins.  Does anyone else see a problem with this?<br/>\n<br/>\nShando, 16th level, Silent Fist Clan<br/>\nBertoxxulous</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
