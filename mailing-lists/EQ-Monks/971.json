Any input?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I used to hate the look of mesh and my Lockjaw vest because they appeared<br/>\njust like leather. When cured silk came around, I gave up the LJ vest to<br/>\nwear the gi. After a while, though, I decided that combining the LJ vest<br/>\nwith cured silk armbands, pants, and sandals still gave me a distinctive<br/>\nmonk look while offering superior protection.<br/>\n<br/>\nI recently acquired a Foreman&#39;s tunic from a friend and love it. It looks<br/>\nlike leather, too, but with the rest of my monk look I don&#39;t mind at all.<br/>\nIt will hold me until I can get a Syythrak hide vest and then eventually<br/>\nshiverback.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Foreman&#39;s tunic comes off the fire goblin foreman in Solusek&#39;s Eye<br/>\n(SolA). It sells for 250-350pp, mostly because it&#39;s also desired by rangers<br/>\nand druids. In my opinion it isn&#39;t worth the money compared to the LJ vest,<br/>\nas +3 STR isn&#39;t going to change the way you play your monk.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;2)  Where is a good place for a level 20 to hunt. <br/>\n&gt;&gt;From 14-17 I hunted oasis and from 17-20 I hunted East<br/>\n&gt;Karana.  Any recomendations?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Levels 17-20 should hunt in Highpass Hold. The orc side is phenomenal<br/>\nexperience and loot, and you can level very quickly. At level 20, move into<br/>\nHigh Keep basement. Start out in a small (3-4 player) group in the lookout<br/>\nroom (any veteran will be able to show you where that is). After a level or<br/>\ntwo, move into a full group in the guard room. With a well-rounded group,<br/>\nyou&#39;ll be able to power level here and make some great cash as well. This<br/>\nroom has taken me to 24th level.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt gets a little boring in terms of scenery, but the High Keep basement can<br/>\nlevel you all the way into the low 30&#39;s by moving up to the warrior and<br/>\nraider rooms.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve travelled to Cazic Thule for a change of pace, and while it offers<br/>\nsome variety the trains are deadly. After I hit 25 I&#39;ll move to Unrest for<br/>\na look, and possibly even Mistmoore. Solusek&#39;s Eye and Najena are also<br/>\npossibilities, if you have the means to sneak past the dark elf guards.<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------------------<br/>\nMoorgard Ghostfist of Povar<br/>\nSeeker of Virtue</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
