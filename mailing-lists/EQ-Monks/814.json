No I have crappy magic resistence for one, and no spells either.  I<br/>\nbelieve everyone in a group has their function, one part of that for a monk<br/>\nis pulling. I for one enjoy the role I take in the groups I am in. Usually I<br/>\nam asked to many groups becuase of my pulling skills. I do not always pull<br/>\nbut frequently I am called upon to do it and I accept that. If I do pull I<br/>\npull the monster, the taunters taunt it off me and we all beat the hell out<br/>\nof it. At higher levels monks dish out some very serious damage especially<br/>\nwhen there is a taunter to keep the mob off them. There is no perfect party<br/>\nas each class brings with it charcateristics that make it better than<br/>\nanother in some respect. and everyone has their own opinion on which<br/>\ncharacteristic is the most important. Oherwise we would all play the same<br/>\nclass, Now that would be boring, if we were all tank mages in full plate<br/>\ncasting ice comet. You say bards are very powerfull noone has disagreed with<br/>\nthat. admittedly you say most dont know how to play them. I would suspect<br/>\nmost here dont know how to play a bard. maybe I will look into starting one<br/>\nas a twink :)<br/>\n<br/>\nKizmet Bayashi<br/>\n40th level monk<br/>\nDa`Kor<br/>\nE-Marr<br/>\n<br/>\nPS How are the gloves and the vest  Bethorn?

Most dont.<br/>\n&gt; One of my characters is a 20th lvl bard. My friend plays a 20th lvl<br/>\n&gt; paladin. We dueled in arena the other night and at the end of the fight I<br/>\n&gt; was at full health. This was even after he used hands. He also blinded me<br/>\n&gt; and ran off and hid someplace and healed himself back to full a second<br/>\n&gt; time. It didn&#39;t save him. And yes, we stood toe to toe (except when he<br/>\n&gt; ran hehe)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In any case, I find this whole thread of monks being master pullers<br/>\n&gt; discouraging. Is this all they are good for at high levels? Is pulling the<br/>\n&gt; only reason they are sought out for groups? Because that hardly sounds<br/>\n&gt; like a fun way to spend time. I play a monk now because I dont have the<br/>\n&gt; patients for long camps. Pulling things for other people to blast doesnt<br/>\n&gt; sound much better :(  Surely there are other things to look forward to as<br/>\n&gt; a high level monk?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -Bethorn<br/>\n&gt; 18th monk, erollisi marr<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Fri, 8 Oct 1999, Dan Gilbert wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; At 08:19 AM 10/8/99 -0700, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;From: &quot;Tim Perkins&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tperkins@...\">tperkins@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Ever wonder why parties always want a monk to pull? Because the Monk IS<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;best puler in the game Bar none.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;          Once again, I am going to have to disagree. The Monk is the 2nd<br/>\n&gt; &gt; best puller in the game. The best puller is one that no one has<br/>\nmentioned<br/>\n&gt; &gt; yet: The Bard. The reason the Bard is the best puller is because of<br/>\nKelin`s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Lugubrious Lament (Lull), Kelin`s Lucid Lullaby (AoE Lull), and Selo&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Accelerando. Bards can use the spells to pull EXACTLY one Mob and then<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hightail it back to the group. If they do pull more they can use Kelin&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Lullaby to keep them occupied or just haul ass to zone. All in all, if<br/>\nyou<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have a Bard that knows what he is doing, they are the best pullers.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;          However, that all said and done, most Bards are not as adept at<br/>\n&gt; &gt; pulling as Monks are. Monks start honing their pulling skills early on.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Bards, for the most part, never really work on pulling. So, given the<br/>\nsame<br/>\n&gt; &gt; skill level and knowledge, a Bard is a better class for pulling. I still<br/>\n&gt; &gt; like a Monk because of the damage they deal. Bard songs are invaluable<br/>\nat<br/>\n&gt; &gt; higher levels though. I would choose a Bard (that knows what they are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; doing) over a Shaman/Druid/Paladin/Ranger if possible.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ���`�.�.�.���.�.��.���`����`�.�.�.���.�.��.���`�<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;          Dan Gilbert, MCSE<br/>\n&gt; &gt;          Internet Systems Engineer<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;          GGI Technologies<br/>\n&gt; &gt;          P.O.
