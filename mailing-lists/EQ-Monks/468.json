And if I recall<br/>\ncorrectly, 14 is the very upper edge for wisps and most will not give exp. I<br/>\nwould recommend either the Dervs in West Commons, or a trip with a party to<br/>\nEast Karanas for Reaver hunting. East Karanas, for those of you that don&#39;t<br/>\nknow, has a GREAT spread of critters. I started hunting there about 16,<br/>\nfound things to solo and things to group up with. At lvl 27, there are still<br/>\na few things there that will offer me exp. It is also right next door to<br/>\nHighpass, should your friend want to take you there. Personally, I hate<br/>\nHighpass... On Fennin Ro, it has become a total free for all, with solo<br/>\nwizzies blasting everything in sight. Same thing with the Pickclaws in<br/>\nHighkeep.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to stay in Eastern Antonica, that&#39;s about it really. You could<br/>\nprobably group and go into Oasis, but it would be a little risky. Don&#39;t<br/>\nlimit yourself to just a few zones tho. Crushbone, Steamfront Minos, Aviaks,<br/>\nLake Rathe, Rathe Mts, Dagnors Cauldron, S. Ro... they all have some<br/>\ncritters that would suit you well.<br/>\n<br/>\nPraelor Dileasai<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:IBNALNOOR@...\">IBNALNOOR@...</a> [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:IBNALNOOR@...\">IBNALNOOR@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tSunday, September 05, 1999 6:34 AM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject:\tRe: [EQ-Monks] monk on the move<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:IBNALNOOR@...\">IBNALNOOR@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; First off you should be able to take Wisps in singles. That would jump<br/>\n&gt; your <br/>\n&gt; plat funds way up pretty quickly and still offer xps as well. If you want<br/>\n&gt; a <br/>\n&gt; good place to hunt run on over to Misty Thicket. I found it a pretty nice <br/>\n&gt; hunting spot around that level. You could solo there for quite some time. <br/>\n&gt; When you max out there take off for Oasis and that can carry you even<br/>\n&gt; higher. <br/>\n&gt; The loot in both places is not very good so do not expect to get rich. If<br/>\n&gt; I <br/>\n&gt; were starting over that is probably what I would do at least. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;              Free Games & Cash Prizes!<br/>\n&gt; Gamesville - The World&#39;s Biggest & Best Game Show Site!<br/>\n&gt;         <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/ad/gamesville0\">http://www.onelist.com/ad/gamesville0</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
