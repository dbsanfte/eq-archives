Brother Qwinn in Southern Karana seeks the return of the code of<br/>\nthe whistling fist, which was stolen by him. It is dropped by Targin the<br/>\nRock, a rare spawn in the Sol B throne room.  Bring him the Code and a<br/>\npurple silent fist headband and you will get a special needle.  Brother<br/>\nZephyl in Rathe Mountains wants the Idol of Zan Fi, which is in the<br/>\npossession of Brother Raster, who spawns in the Mino Elders room in Lower<br/>\nGuk. Returning this Idol, plus a red sash, results in a special tailoring<br/>\npattern.  These two items need to be combined in a sewing kit with a swatch<br/>\nof shadow silk (tailored) and a Scroll of Jonathans Whistling Warsong, which<br/>\nis bought from the Bards Guild, to make a monk only item called the Robe of<br/>\nthe Lost Circle.<br/>\n<br/>\nstats:<br/>\n<br/>\nAC 12<br/>\nSTA +5<br/>\nAGI +5<br/>\nHP +25<br/>\nWT 0.7<br/>\n<br/>\nLooks like a maroon caster robe.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a very long quest. The items droped are no drop and ALL ALL, so some<br/>\nplayers can loot it not knowing it is a quest for monks. Especially the<br/>\nidol, that has stats in INT and WIS.<br/>\nTargin the Rock seems to be a once a day spawn, may be even more often. But<br/>\nRaster of Guk is the big part, a once a week spawn. Yes, once a week !!!!!<br/>\nThe brothers in SK and RM seem to spawn every 6 hours, and they disappear<br/>\nafter one hour or two.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would say it is a lvl 35+ quest.<br/>\n<br/>\nTsin Suchiko<br/>\n38th rank, Tunare.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
