It is quite fun however to run through oasis or <br/>\nWC and kill SG or HG.  And this is made mostly possible through use of ID.  I <br/>\nhave soloed a SG w/o using it before, but it was way to close to actually <br/>\ndepend on being able to kill them regularly.  With using it, I have soloed SG <br/>\nand only lost half my hps, not even using mend.  Though it&#39;s not very <br/>\nreliable, I can normally count on it working at least once or twice in a <br/>\nfight of the sort mentioned above.<br/>\n<br/>\nKanja<br/>\n50 monk<br/>\nRodcet Nife</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
