Nice job on neatly missing the point<br/>\ncompletely though.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf what he says below is true, then I shouldn&#39;t have even been able to<br/>\nraise it from 100 to 120 until I got to lvl 20, which clearly isn&#39;t<br/>\nthe case.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll have to get to lvl 5 to confirm this, but if I get to 5, and my<br/>\nskill can go to 125, then it looks like it&#39;s lvl capped to 100 + (lvl<br/>\n* 5), which was my initial question.  I thought swimming WASN&#39;T lvl<br/>\ncapped, but it looks (at first glance) that it is.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; No, nothing is wrong. The cap for human monk swimming is as you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have stated. Lizards are better swimmers innately and begin with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; swimming mastery. The first poster is using some software package<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (ShowEQ or something similar) to display a numeric value for his<br/>\n&gt; &gt; skill. In answer to the first poster&#39;s question, you will not be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; able to improve your skill beyond 120 until you reach a level that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; allows you to progress beyond that skill (level 24 in this case).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Then why did it allow me to get to 120 at lvl 4?  I mean, why go from<br/>\n&gt; 100 to 120, stop for 20 lvls, then start up again?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; That makes no sense at all.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; (I&#39;m not using ShowEQ, BTW; I looked at my log file to see where it<br/>\n&gt; started and ended.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>-- <br/>\nFrugguk, Frivyn, Fromiss: Xegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
