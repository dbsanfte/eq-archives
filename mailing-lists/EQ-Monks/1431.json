It&#39;s definitely doable.  Some<br/>\nthings were still blue to me at level 26 there (fanatics, mercenaries, and<br/>\nthe named orcs), and the loot is pretty good.  Lots of ringmail, and a shop<br/>\nwithin a short distance to sell at.  You can also get the Shralok Pack from<br/>\nRecfek Shralok, which is a 8 slot 25% weight reduction pack.  It&#39;s pending<br/>\nlore, but it&#39;s been that way for months.  Handy thing to have.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Raean Bloodyhands, soon to be 28th rank<br/>\n-Sifu of the Fists of Fury<br/>\n-Tunare<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Currey, Mick&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mick_currey@...\">mick_currey@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hail all you experienced monks out there.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What recommendations does everyone have for places to hunt solo by levels?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My character is only level 21, but here were his favorites so far&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Level Area Hunted<br/>\n&gt; 1-4 Freeport<br/>\n&gt; 5-10 Rivervale (with runnyeye bead quest)<br/>\n&gt; 11-12 Black Burrow (with gnoll teeth quest)<br/>\n&gt; 13-16 Wisp island (gls quest, good money and exp!)<br/>\n&gt; 17-18 EK (gnoll reavers)<br/>\n&gt; 19-20 HH (gnolls solo and orcs in a group)<br/>\n&gt; 21-22?
