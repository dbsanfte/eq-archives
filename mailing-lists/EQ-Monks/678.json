Verant has made many items","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-122993404\">All Verant needs to do is make the items they don&#39;t want<br/>\ntwinked/camped/sold on e-bay/etc. NO DROP items and the problem goes<br/>\naway. Verant has made many items NO DROP already and has chosen to leave<br/>\nothers alone, only making them LORE ITEMS so you may only have 1 in your<br/>\npossession. Obviously Verant feels it should be okay to camp/twink/sell<br/>\non e-bay certain items or they would apply the NO DROP tag to them also.<br/>\nBefore you flame away let me tell you I don&#39;t twink/camp/buy items on<br/>\ne-bay, to me that&#39;s not roleplaying fun. I only have one character in<br/>\nEQ, my Monk. But after several years of UO I&#39;ve learned that not<br/>\neveryones idea of fun is the same as mine. At least EQ allows me to play<br/>\nthe way I want without others ruining my fun too much. Yes there are<br/>\nkill stealers out there, but pulling a train and FD&#39;ing at their feet<br/>\nhelps stop that. As for the serious twinkers? Their characters will<br/>\nsuffer in the long run. The easier they level the harder/longer it will<br/>\nbe before their skills are maxed. If the only way people can enjoy the<br/>\ngame is to start out with Superman, as long as he stays off my toes,<br/>\nit&#39;s their nickel......<br/>\n<br/>\nTymbyrwulf<br/>\nSolusek Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
