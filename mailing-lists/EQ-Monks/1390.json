When Runny<br/>\nis behind you, it is the camp you see straight and to the right (south I<br/>\nthink). Only one tent there. 2 goblins spawn very quickly. And every 20<br/>\nminutes, a third goblin spawns right inside the tent. It is NOT a one hour<br/>\nand a half spawn. It can be a warrior, a shaman, Mooto most of the time, OR<br/>\nthe alchemist. This one will begin to wander by the other camps if you wait<br/>\ntoo long, so don&#39;t wait to kill it.<br/>\nThat one took me 10, then 12, then 5 hours.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe alchemist in the gorge is, indeed, very rare. But it is not a once a<br/>\nweek spawn. It can spawn twice in a day, and 2 or 3 times a week as far as I<br/>\nknow. I missed it 3 times for 5 minutes, I have been there for 5 server<br/>\nreboot, but never got it that way. A server reboot is not an automatic<br/>\nsuccess. The spawn rate is NOT 2-4 hours. It is between 72 and 80 minutes.<br/>\nRight in front of the fork by Runny Eye zone, you have 2 spots for goblins.<br/>\nOne to the left, and one at the middle. The middle spot is the correct spot.<br/>\nThere you have 2 goblin spawns AT THE EXACT SAME SPOT. One every 6 minutes,<br/>\nand one every 72-80 minutes (the good one). I usually waited til I could see<br/>\nboth, then I killed them and I could time it precisely. Goblins at this spot<br/>\nwill wander a little, but they always come back. Their path is not very<br/>\nlong.<br/>\nThat one took me 180+ hours. But don&#39;t worry, it is usually something like<br/>\n30 hours. I was just VERY unlucky.<br/>\n<br/>\nTsin Suchiko<br/>\n42nd rank, Tunare.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:imari_dellimore@...\">imari_dellimore@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:imari_dellimore@...\">imari_dellimore@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, February 17, 2000 8:42 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re:[EQ-Monks] That darn goblin alchemist.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:imari_dellimore@...\">imari_dellimore@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n1st point:<br/>\nThe alchemist in misty spawns at teh goblin camp closest to the running eye<br/>\nzone.  ordinarily there are 2 goblins at this camp, but ever hour and a half<br/>\nor<br/>\nso a 3rd goblibn pops - either Mooto or the alchemist.  Mooto and the<br/>\nalchemist<br/>\nare the only ones you need to kill.

If I were you I would take advantage of the server reset and<br/>\nhead<br/>\nto the GOrge as soon as you wake up!  The misty thicket alchemist will pop<br/>\nabout<br/>\nonce every 2-4 hours.
