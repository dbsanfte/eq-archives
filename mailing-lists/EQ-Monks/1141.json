Why are they suddenly asking for<br/>\n&gt;&gt;opinions?  I say it should be changed, if just to level the playing field.  I<br/>\n&gt;&gt;guess this goes to prove thast if you play a popular class you get special<br/>\n&gt;&gt;benefits, but if you are the minority you get walked all over. Oh, well all<br/>\n&gt;&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Necros will scream that it would be unfair to take away this unbalancing &quot;bug&quot;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;and we will still get stuck with our nerfed FD.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Shando, 17th circle, Bertoxxulous<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Or maybe it is a company who is trying to change the way they deal with<br/>\n&gt;customers?  Sometimes I wish you guys would just make up your mind.<br/>\n&gt;You say you want more input into the game.  Then they ask for your opinion<br/>\n&gt;and you complain about that.
