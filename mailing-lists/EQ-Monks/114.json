Would you recommend i spend them on offensive skills now, save them for later, use them on a skill to make money, or <br/>\nuse them on throwing. If on<br/>\n&gt;&gt; throwing is it a really good skill to get, does it do any damage or is it just to attract animals as ive heard.

Your skills will<br/>\n&gt;max out at each level as you use them. Waste of points. I&#39;ve found<br/>\n&gt;Throwing to be a useless skill as well, only using it rarely to lure.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
