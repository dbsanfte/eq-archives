Then it should work a<br/>\nlot more than it fails at lvl 70 skill.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSneak is fantastic when you are the scout and mapping out a new dungeon.<br/>\nWhen other characters would get wiped out, you can sneak past guards.  Hehe,<br/>\nwhen that fails, you just fd.  Works out great.  (You haven&#39;t had fun till<br/>\nyou scout out a dungeon full of red mob&#39;s with another monk.  You and the<br/>\nother monk can sneak around, fd when needed, then find lower level mobs to<br/>\nwipe out before the red ones find you.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone else will have to answer about instill doubt.  I haven&#39;t had good<br/>\nluck with it either.  <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Juliebu@...\">Juliebu@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Juliebu@...\">Juliebu@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tThursday, March 16, 2000 11:59 AM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n\t\tSubject:\t[EQ-Monks] Skills questions<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Juliebu@...\">Juliebu@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tI got feign death last level and have had no luck with it at<br/>\nall. <br/>\n\t\tI&#39;ve been faithfully practicing (my death screams are still<br/>\nringing<br/>\n\t\tin my ears) and my skill is up to around 70, but it&#39;s only<br/>\nworked one<br/>\n\t\ttime.
