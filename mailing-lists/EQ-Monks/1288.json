The only better armour I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;know of is that Plane of Fear, Shiverback stuff.. At level 12, I think not.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;So I guess that leaves earrings and rings?

Scarab (sand/Giant) carapaces weigh<br/>\n&gt; &gt;0.0kgs. You can solo these at about level 10, and since the loot doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt;weigh anything it&#39;s all good!
