And yes, I twink between them, but<br/>\n&gt;not outrageously so, and not so it unbalances anything.  For example, my<br/>\n&gt;monk (lvl 10) was generating cash at a healthy clip.  So he gave all his<br/>\n&gt;money to my warrior blacksmith (lvl 19).  The blacksmith use the pp to make<br/>\n&gt;a partial suite of large banded armor for my ogre shaman (lvl 8), who in<br/>\n&gt;turn is looking for mesh armor in Upper Guk for my monk.  I try to make it<br/>\n&gt;more of a micro economy.  If these three characters were owned by different<br/>\n&gt;people, it wouldn&#39;t be a twink at all.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I have no doubt that there is outrageous twinking going on (saw a lvl 8 <br/>\n&gt;ogre<br/>\n&gt;warrior with full bronze plate), but I think you can twink within reason <br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;not upset the game balance.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Charles Lembke<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:c-lembke@...\">c-lembke@...</a><br/>\n&gt;AKA, Raelph, Vulfgange, Argharghargharh, Orpheuss, Matar, and company.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   New!!
