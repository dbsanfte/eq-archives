No twinkage<br/>\nthere.<br/>\n<br/>\nGot a little bored with Lei.  Started an Erudite Enchanter.  Being low level<br/>\nagain sucked.  Especially as an Enchanter.  So I figured on some nice<br/>\nhealthy twinkage should squeeze me through these crap times onto when<br/>\nEnchanters get to be fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nModerately heavy twinkage.  Haha!  I am a bad ass now!  Problem solved?<br/>\nNope.  After a while, I just figured no matter how cool they seem,<br/>\nenchanters just aren&#39;t for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nBack to Lei.  Having much fun, but I feel the dark side calling.<br/>\n<br/>\nA DE Necro is born.  My god is this character fun!  Even at level one!  Life<br/>\ntap has to be the coolest spell ever made!  /pet kill  Muhahahaha!  Evil is<br/>\ngood!  I&#39;m having a ton of fun with this character and have no particular<br/>\ndesire to twink her.  She&#39;s doing just fine on her own.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, my thoughts on twinking?  <br/>\n<br/>\n*shrug*  I can see both sides.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the end, no matter what I say or do, some people are going to twink and<br/>\nothers aren&#39;t.  Ultimately, it&#39;s up to Verant to decide if they want<br/>\ntwinking or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nLei</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
