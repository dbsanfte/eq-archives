My","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1844840684\">Ok. Point well taken. Let me try to re-phrase and remain a calmer, more<br/>\nproductive Praelor =).<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes twinking affect more than the twinked? IMHO yes it does. My PoF example<br/>\nillustrates that, even though someone has pointed out an alternate reasoning<br/>\non why the level restriction was put into place (I wont go into a debate on<br/>\nthat as it is a different subject altogether. Suffice it to say that the<br/>\nalternate reasoning was just as valid as mine and I agree with it).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy stance is not one of jealousy or envy. If it were, I would have my full<br/>\nshiverback tonight. I am in a guild with lvl 35+ members who had invited me<br/>\na number of times into PoF with them for Shiverback before it was closed off<br/>\nto me. Each time I had declined. I knew I was not ready for such a venture.<br/>\nThey have invited me to the depths of Lower Guk, and again I have declined.<br/>\nSoon I will be ready for Guk, and then and only then will I go. Do I want<br/>\nthe azure sleeves and serp bracers? Absolutely. Will I buy them if I get an<br/>\nopportunity? Definitely. Would I accept one as a gift? Perhaps. It would<br/>\ndepend upon who it was coming from. There is a thin line between the<br/>\noccasional gift and outright twinking. A full suit of Shiverback at lvl 19<br/>\nis not a gift. A BP necklace at lvl 19 could be. Would I take Praelor and go<br/>\nout and buy a full suit of steel plate (or whatever.. I don&#39;t know armors<br/>\nmuch outside what monks can wear) for a new cleric I was starting? Not a<br/>\nchance. And yet I have a friend who did just that. And did it while he owed<br/>\nme 100 plat! That is the selfishness I refer to. And that is the type of<br/>\nbehavior that reflects upon all monks. When you think back to last weekend,<br/>\ndo you first remember what a grand time you had in that group in Aviaks, or<br/>\ndo you first remember that &lt;expletive deleted&gt; who did nothing but steal<br/>\neveryone&#39;s kills in Pickclaws all night? Do you remember the fun<br/>\nconversation you had with that little gnome on the boat to Butcherblock, or<br/>\ndo you remember that blue con in Solusek running around in full rubicite and<br/>\nduel wielding 2 Ykesha (or whatever that sword is called) shouting for help?<br/>\nPeople tend to remember negative experiences first, negative impressions<br/>\nfirst. I personally have never grouped with someone who was obviously a<br/>\ntwink, and have removed myself from groups when one would join. I do not<br/>\nwish to be associated with that type of selfish attitude, as I think it<br/>\nlooks bad for all those who are associated with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know there is no stopping twinking. And believe it or not, I don&#39;t get mad<br/>\nin game about it. I have developed a definite rp attitude and opinion<br/>\ntowards the twink. More often than not I chuckle softly to myself and go my<br/>\nmerry way, avoiding the issue in-game entirely and knowing that this poor<br/>\nlvl 15 in full steel will perish in the oasis just as many times as I did in<br/>\nwoven and mesh. But OOC I will be as vociferous and adamantly against<br/>\ntwinking as my nerves will allow me =).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd now for a little fun =)<br/>\n<br/>\nHamlet, the Twink of Norrath<br/>\n<br/>\nTo twink, or not to twink, that is the question,<br/>\nWhether tis nobler in the mind to suffer<br/>\nThe slings and arrows of outrageous demons<br/>\nOr take gifts amongst a sea of friends,<br/>\nAnd by opposing, confuse them, to die to twink<br/>\nNo more, and by a twink, to say we end<br/>\nThe heartache, and the thousand nat&#39;ral shocks<br/>\nThat flesh is heir to; Tis a attitude<br/>\nDevout to be wished to die than twink,.<br/>\nTo twink, perchance to die; Aye there&#39;s the rub,<br/>\nFor in that death of twink what eyes may come<br/>\nWhen we have shuffled off this mortal coil<br/>\nMust give us pause, there&#39;s the respect<br/>\nThat makes mockery of so long life.<br/>\nFor who would bear the whips and scorns of time,<br/>\nThe demons claw, the high level&#39;d costume,<br/>\nthe pangs of envied gear, the lawless delay,<br/>\nThe insolence of office, and the spurns<br/>\nOf the patient merit him unworthy that takes<br/>\nBefore his time a suit of gleaming rubicite.<br/>\nWho would these black pearls bear,<br/>\nTo eat and sleep under a pamper&#39;d life<br/>\nBut then dread possible death in<br/>\nThe undiscovered country from who&#39;s corpse<br/>\nNo armor returns, puzzles the will,<br/>\nAnd makes us rather bear that gear we have,<br/>\nThan fly to others that we cannot ourselves obtain.<br/>\nLack of conscience does make Twinkers of us all.<br/>\nAnd thus the natural hue of evolution<br/>\nIs sickly ore with the pale cast of fire emeralds<br/>\nAnd enterprises of great pitch and moment<br/>\nWith this regard, their currents turn awry<br/>\nAnd loose the name of action. Soft you now,<br/>\nFor Norrath calls for heroes and I shall answer:<br/>\nBe all our twinks outnumbered..<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPraelor Dileasai<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Felizpunk@...\">Felizpunk@...</a> [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Felizpunk@...\">Felizpunk@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tTuesday, September 14, 1999 9:29 PM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject:\tRe: [EQ-Monks] Digest Number 66<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Felizpunk@...\">Felizpunk@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 9/14/99 6:10:12 PM Eastern Daylight Time,<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:RobF@...\">RobF@...</a> <br/>\n&gt; writes:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt; it is not about jealousy. It is about taking pride in actually earning<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt;  gear I wear and knowing that what I have, I got for myself, whether by<br/>\n&gt;  earning coin enough to buy it or by venturing and slaying the beast that<br/>\n&gt;  carries it. I got it. I did not have it handed to me on a silver platter<br/>\n&gt; by<br/>\n&gt;  some high level friend who already has no problem getting as many as he<br/>\n&gt;  wants.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  Kind of like that spoiled rich kid in high school who was driving the<br/>\n&gt;  Corvette. Sure he looks cool, but you know damn well he didn&#39;t pay for it<br/>\n&gt; or<br/>\n&gt;  the insurance that comes with it. Would I like to own a vette? you bet.<br/>\n&gt;  Would I take one if my folks offered it to me? hell no. All a matter of<br/>\n&gt; self<br/>\n&gt;  pride vs. selfishness &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  Jealousy. Who cares what else anyone has, simply because they had it<br/>\n&gt; handed <br/>\n&gt; to them? If you are essentially concerned with what you&#39;ve earned, then<br/>\n&gt; why <br/>\n&gt; does what others have bother you so much? It sounds like envy, and it at <br/>\n&gt; best, reactive, rather than proactive. Bottled up ressentiment expressing <br/>\n&gt; itself.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  I am not twinked. Everything I have, I have earned. But the fact that <br/>\n&gt; someone else has not is irrelevant to me (unless I am harmed by it, as in<br/>\n&gt; the <br/>\n&gt; PoF example someone gave earlier.) Be proud of what you&#39;ve earned, and do <br/>\n&gt; your best to have fun.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  Just my thoughts on this matter... And btw, Praelor, I have enjoyed many<br/>\n&gt; of <br/>\n&gt; your thoughtful posts.
