What I need to know though is, is this armor somthing that I will actualy &quot;make&quot; (ex. making patch work armor out of hides) and if so, what do I need to do this? just a sewing kit, or do I need to use some of my traing ponits in a certain skill area?. I am now on the cusp of tenth LvL, Is that high enough to start hunting what ever creatures will &quot;give&quot; me netted/mesh?. Also, I am a Freeport monk, I hear much talk about the sewers of Qeynos (think that is the place) But nothing of were to hunt for the creatures I am looking for in my area. (Here is a VERY New&#39;b Q, If i do need to go to Qeynos, how do i get there, by boat or try it overland?) <br/>\nI thank you all in advance for your time.<br/>\n<br/>\nZarvitz, monk of the 9th circle.<br/>\n&quot;May Quellios guide your mind so that you may guide your fists&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
