Once you get up in level Money really becomes valuless.<br/>\n(sp?) if you have a way to make cash use it to get the items you need or<br/>\nwant, but cash in the bank gets old.  most of the really good items are<br/>\nnever sold only traded for. when was the last time you saw someone auctiona<br/>\nFBSS or a Ykesha etc. if you just adventure and look foir the items you want<br/>\nthey will eventually show up. or you may just get somthing better than you<br/>\nwanted in the 1st place.<br/>\n<br/>\nKizmet Bayashi<br/>\nMonk of the 38th level<br/>\nDa&#39;Kor Guild<br/>\nE-marr Server<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Scott Hueseman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shueseman@...\">shueseman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, September 20, 1999 1:58 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ-Monks] Isn&#39;t this a monk mailing list?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Scott Hueseman&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shueseman@...\">shueseman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Imari J.

Get lucky on a few rare spawns or<br/>\n&gt; good loots (Runed Bone Fork, Chitin Shell tunic, etc), head to auction and<br/>\n&gt; let the bidding commence.   500pp EVERY day at level 19 would be amazing!<br/>\n&gt; Of course then you get into rapid devaluation of platinum, mass<br/>\n&gt; unemployment, famine, disease, pottery sketch fraud, etc., etc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Dornn<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
