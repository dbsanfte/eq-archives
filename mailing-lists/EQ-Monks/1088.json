Its a game.  You happen to play with your brother, that&#39;s<br/>\nwonderful, however EQ is still a game.  For you, the ability to<br/>\nplay a game together means you can spend time together.  That<br/>\nis wonderful.  This doesn&#39;t make EQ more than a game.  EQ didn&#39;t exist<br/>\n9 months ago, at some date in the future, EQ will not exist.  I hope<br/>\nyou have a contingency plan ready, because EQ is not life, or a way of<br/>\nlife, it is simply a game you enjoy together.  Joke all you want that<br/>\nit is life, fine, no problem.  But when you read a post where someone<br/>\nseriously thinks it is more than a game.  Please step back from it<br/>\nand think about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIF EQ was perfect, or something you&#39;ve been doing for tens of years<br/>\nand nothing had ever changed on it, then you would have a much better<br/>\nargument.  However we can clearly see that monks aren&#39;t being singled<br/>\nout, almost every class is being tuned every month.  This one was<br/>\nslightly major.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut enough is enough.  Shit happens and we adjust.  This mailing list<br/>\nis not about these kinds of posts or this kind of thread. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe purpose of this list is to distribute information about Monks to the players of EverQuest. Spoilers may be included so read at your own risk. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe purpose of this list is NOT to be a vent for your fustration.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Crysarra de&#39;Danann &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lucretia_71@...\">lucretia_71@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Its not about &quot;chatting&quot;!!! I don&#39;t need some lame ass chat room to<br/>\n&gt; talk to him.  I get bored to death with ICQ and chats and all that<br/>\n&gt; stupid crap!!  Its not even about talking...its about doing something<br/>\n&gt; together....the working together.  We don&#39;t have anything to do<br/>\n&gt; together besides talking about &quot;well so have you talked to dad lately? <br/>\n&gt; or how&#39;s mom doing?&quot;  BORING!!!  BUT when we are in EQ we fight mobs<br/>\n&gt; together and I trust him completely..he is my brother!  I love him more<br/>\n&gt; than anyone.  We just don&#39;t have much to say and this way its like he<br/>\n&gt; lives near me and I can do things with him all the time.  Last time I<br/>\n&gt; saw him...we sat and played diablo all day or something.  This is<br/>\n&gt; something we enjoy doing together!  And for your info..yes I have been<br/>\n&gt; in Lower guk fighting and carrying on a coversation with him....guess I<br/>\n&gt; am just multi-tasking...or something.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- Robert Hillyer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:robhillyer@...\">robhillyer@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; If the only reason you and your brother talk to each other is because<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; are both in EQ than you have a serious relationship problem. You<br/>\n&gt; &gt; could chat<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in e-mail or ICQ but you say you dont have the time. For your own<br/>\n&gt; &gt; brother?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Yet you go ingame and use it like a chat room, doing nothing but<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sending<br/>\n&gt; &gt; messages back and forth. You can&#39;t tell me you are in Sol B fighting<br/>\n&gt; &gt; whatever while you chat with him. I&#39;ve tried carrying on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; conversations while<br/>\n&gt; &gt; fighting and it doesn&#39;t work real well. So you sit in game and chat<br/>\n&gt; &gt; but you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have no time to sit out of game and chat. With your own family.....<br/>\n&gt; &gt; That<br/>\n&gt; &gt; doesnt make EQ more than a game, just a game with a chat<br/>\n&gt; &gt; feature......<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Thousands of Stores.
