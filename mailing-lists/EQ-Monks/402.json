Granted however at least on<br/>\nthe low end you all start looking hte same as you buy gear, but it is a nice<br/>\nchange.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing is with graphics, they are simply not going to put in new stuff<br/>\nfor the old continents.  The expansion pack will add some new textures and<br/>\nthe requirements (hardware) while yer there are higher so they can give you<br/>\nsome more degrees of differentiation, but from what I understand it will<br/>\nonly be like that in those new areas.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I would suggest, since they won&#39;t add textures, is that if you want a<br/>\ndifferent look you /feeback and email for more monk coloration (colors are<br/>\nnot textures as I understand it).
