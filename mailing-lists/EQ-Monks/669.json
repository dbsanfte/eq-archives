Hold on a second... Obviously, the person who originally got this item deserved it, right? Then, when they get","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-76552910\">From: Seamus McNeill &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:smcneill@...\">smcneill@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Now that we have that understood....lets talk about twinking.  Everytime<br/>\n&gt;you twink you take something away from someone who is at the right level<br/>\n&gt;to have that item.  At 19 or 17 or 22 or whatever level he was...he took<br/>\n&gt;away an executioners hood from some 45th+ level character.  He took the<br/>\n&gt;serpentine bracers away from some 40th+ level character who deserved it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hold on a second...<br/>\n<br/>\nObviously, the person who originally got this item deserved it, right?<br/>\nThen, when they get something better, or just aren&#39;t going to use it<br/>\nanymore, what should they do with it?  Destroy it?  So, they give/sell it to<br/>\nsomeone.  Well, do they deserve it?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;And it&#39;s not the fact that he can go and get another one...it&#39;s the fact<br/>\n&gt;that he is just going to have to wait that much longer because there is<br/>\n&gt;some chump monk who can&#39;t earn his own equipment...he has to have older<br/>\n&gt;friends help him out or just use his own older character to get things for<br/>\n&gt;him cause he can&#39;t play the game like it was meant to be played.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So, if everyone should earn their own equipment, that sort of messes with<br/>\nthe whole player driven economy, doesn&#39;t it?  Anyone who sells armor is then<br/>\ntwinking...right?  The person buying that armor didn&#39;t earn it...right?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I hate twinking and i hate twinkers because you take things away from<br/>\n&gt;people who rightfully deserve those items.  I don&#39;t care if your 48th<br/>\n&gt;level kill stealing wizard had to shoot down the hopes of a group of 45th<br/>\n&gt;levels to get the item....you still took it from them and gave it to<br/>\n&gt;someone who is 1/2 their age...maybe younger.  Everytime you twink an item<br/>\n&gt;you screw someone who REALLY AND TRULEY DESERVES THE ITEM.   <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The necessity of purchasing items or being twinked comes from the fact that<br/>\nall of the good items are constantly camped by higher level players who<br/>\neither get the items for themselves or sell them for outrageous prices.  You<br/>\nwant JBoots?  Well, be prepared to spend a good portion of your EQ life<br/>\ncamping for them, taking turns with god knows how many others (who may not<br/>\nbe willing to take turns themselves).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, who really deserves anything?  Apparently, it&#39;s the people who have<br/>\nhours upon hours to camp certain areas, or those who have the finacial means<br/>\nto buy the items from them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone wants to give me their JBoots that they don&#39;t need anymore, how is<br/>\nthat affecting you?  I don&#39;t see how it would.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I think the one thing that people don&#39;t realize about this game and any<br/>\n&gt;other game is that it is everyones responsibility to provide a roleplaying<br/>\n&gt;environment.  it is EVERYONES responsibility to PROVIDE a ROLEPLAYING<br/>\n&gt;ENVIRONMENT....it is a massively multiplayer roleplaying game after<br/>\n&gt;all..... <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Roleplaying means what?  Playing a role of your character, right?  What does<br/>\nthat have to do with twinking?  Do you think that we are playing in a day<br/>\nwhere no one gave gifts or handed down used items?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nONElist:  your connection to online communities.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
