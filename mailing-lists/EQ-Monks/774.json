The first thing I do when I log on is hit the Run key :), and then<br/>\nmy Friends button.

Nobody wanted to<br/>\ngroup with my level 18 ogre basher, so he just joined in the free-for-all<br/>\nfray.  Much to my surprise he was able to do enough damage to get some of<br/>\nthe kills if there were multiple mobs!  So I started saying things like &quot;Yah<br/>\nmeez da bestest barsher round!&quot; /em flexes his muscles &quot;Me kills da orcs<br/>\ngud!&quot;  Everyone around was laughing. :)  I love that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;John Carney&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jcarney@...\">jcarney@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Amen!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve found I can group with most any class combo, it just changes how we<br/>\n&gt; play and what kind of monsters we attack.
