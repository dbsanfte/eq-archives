Monks are out-damaged by all other <br/>\nmelee classes and hybrids (with level-appropriate equipment) for most <br/>\nof our lives.<br/>\n\tOnce you hit 30 (and get flying kick), things begin to <br/>\nchange.  At that point, only warriors really can out-damage us (with <br/>\nthe new patch, that is - before it was more even, depending on his <br/>\nequipment, of course).  As far as what would be a compelling reason <br/>\nfor a group to select us over a warrior goes... I can&#39;t think of one. <br/>\nI stick with my monk because I have a ball playing him and the party <br/>\nI&#39;m in has leaned to recognize that we bring benefits that are harder <br/>\nto define.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nAaron Braunstein<br/>\nPacific Data Management, Inc.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aaron_braunstein@...\">aaron_braunstein@...</a>&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
