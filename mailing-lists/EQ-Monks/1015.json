And that is to get a freaking Werewolf<br/>\nclaw. Now being one that does not like to run around in the stupid West<br/>\nCommonlands, or West Karana asking repetitively anyone have a werewolf on<br/>\ntracking let me know! I got so bored and tired so I have decided to go to<br/>\nMistmoore and try to get to the dance floor. Now I have been to MM quite a<br/>\nfew times but I have never been inside the castle barely even down the ramp<br/>\ntowards the castle. mainly the Grave Yard and the zone line. Now I would<br/>\nlike some help on any suggestions or tips as to what to go or how to go<br/>\nabout getting to the Dance Room with the Gypsies/Werewolves....i.e. party<br/>\nmake up and level or a site where there might be a map. Thanks for your<br/>\nhelp.<br/>\n<br/>\nKaladiel<br/>\n39th Level Monk<br/>\nBrell Serilis</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
