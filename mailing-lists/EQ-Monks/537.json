If a monk&#39;s fists are slower than that, then we<br/>\n&gt; are truly slighted.  I&#39;ve never seen numbers on the delay of hand to hand,<br/>\n&gt; but I&#39;m really hoping it&#39;s faster than 28 (more like 20 or so, and maybe<br/>\n&gt; dependent on level).  I&#39;m not sure what level you are, but put it this<br/>\nway,<br/>\n&gt; you&#39;ll never see anyone dual wielding anything that slow past about level<br/>\n&gt; 25, except maybe in their off hand, but their dual wield is about 3 levels<br/>\n&gt; below ours.  They are less concerned with how often the dual wield hits,<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; more with how much dmg it does.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I would suggest, that if you&#39;d like to play with a mace, use only one, and<br/>\n&gt; in your off hand.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ryugen<br/>\n&gt; Bertoxxulous<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Dizzy J.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dizzyj@...\">dizzyj@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;Subject: Re: [EQ-Monks] which stat?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Date: Fri, 10 Sep 1999 11:54:12 -0500 (CDT)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Dizzy J.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dizzyj@...\">dizzyj@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;my main point is that no one really knows what does what.  I&#39;ve read WAY<br/>\n&gt; &gt;too much about which stat should go where, and the only consensus is that<br/>\n&gt; &gt;no one really knows.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;my philosophy is 2 fold.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;1) I belive (with no empirical data to back it up) that once a stat gets<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; &gt;a certain level, adjusting that stat will have diminishing returns. i.e<br/>\n&gt; &gt;add +5 to a stat that is at 90, and thats a big change.  and +5 to a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;stat that is at 130, and the change is less noticeable.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;2) most of the high level shiverback stuff adjusts str, dex, and agil.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;(also stamina)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;so, I&#39;m trying to build a well balanced character.  Its quite possible<br/>\n&gt; &gt;that for some situations agil is needed, for others str in important.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;different situations are based on Mob type, group/solo, level...just too<br/>\n&gt; &gt;many varieties.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I&#39;m also trying to get a balance of +resistance (cold, fire, magic..etc).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;That seems to be quite a bit more difficult<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I&#39;m not saying that anyone is right, or anyone is wrong.  Just a humble<br/>\n&gt; &gt;monk expaining his philosophies.  :)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;on a side note.  I also have a feeling that speading up our attacks would<br/>\n&gt; &gt;have the biggest impact.  I&#39;m planning on duel weilding some maces (rate<br/>\n&gt; &gt;of 28) to compare against my fists.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;-dj<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;On Fri, 10 Sep 1999 <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Felizpunk@...\">Felizpunk@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Felizpunk@...\">Felizpunk@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  I would go for improving mainly AGI and DEX...
