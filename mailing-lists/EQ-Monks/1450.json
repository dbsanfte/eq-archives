I&#39;ve been saving<br/>\n&gt;points for dragon punch coming up.  I&#39;ll have 25 points when I get it.  Is<br/>\n&gt;instill doubt good enough that I should put some of the saved up points <br/>\n&gt;into<br/>\n&gt;it, instead of the special attack?  Any advice here in either direction?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;\t\tFrom:\tThom Green [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:thom_mg@...\">thom_mg@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;\t\tSent:\tThursday, March 16, 2000 12:58 PM<br/>\n&gt;\t\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;\t\tSubject:\tRE: [EQ-Monks] Skills questions<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;\t\tFrom: &quot;Thom Green&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:thom_mg@...\">thom_mg@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;\t\tOh yea, I forgot the stop attacking thingy too.  Hehe.  As<br/>\n&gt;far as instill<br/>\n&gt;\t\tdoubt goes, its the hardest skill I have ever had to raise.<br/>\n&gt;I hit the<br/>\n&gt;\t\tinstill doubt button constantly, targeting anything I can,<br/>\n&gt;and I think mine<br/>\n&gt;\t\tis like 35th.  And the key to getting it to work is make<br/>\n&gt;sure the ONLY thing<br/>\n&gt;\t\tyou are doing to your target is auto attack, no special<br/>\n&gt;attacks, and your<br/>\n&gt;\t\tspecial attacks button has to be up (Tiger Claw, etc) and<br/>\n&gt;then hit your<br/>\n&gt;\t\tinstill doubt.  Now, chances are the next result you will<br/>\n&gt;see is it telling<br/>\n&gt;\t\tyou &quot;You aren&#39;t scaring anyone&quot;.  Hehe if you are REALLY<br/>\n&gt;lucky and get it to<br/>\n&gt;\t\twork (I think I have gotten it to work like 3 or 4 times),<br/>\n&gt;it should have<br/>\n&gt;\t\tthe same effect as the 4th level necro spell, and make them<br/>\n&gt;start to run<br/>\n&gt;\t\taway for 10-30 seconds.  Only you don&#39;t get the nifty flying<br/>\n&gt;skulls.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
