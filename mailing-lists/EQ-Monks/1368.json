Also, ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1898920510\">Yea one of my big money makers was making raw silk armor.  30 plat for a 13 <br/>\npeice suit.  Low level mages and monks would go nuts over that stuff.  Also, <br/>\nanother big money maker for me well before I was 10th level, is I hung <br/>\naround in the sewers in Qeynos, I know those places upside down.  And there <br/>\nwere a few things in there high level people were some times interested in.  <br/>\nI would have level 20-50s come in and not know there way around the place.  <br/>\nThat is where I came in.  I would show them to where ever it was they wanted <br/>\nto go, and I got as much as 50 plat for showing someone around.  Of course, <br/>\nsometimes they wouldn&#39;t pay me squat.  But they had to get out of the place <br/>\nsometimes.  Heheh, and when they did, if they didn&#39;t pay anything to me <br/>\nbefore for showing them the place, I would make myself a little too <br/>\nconvienantly busy to show them back out, till they offered the big bucks.  <br/>\n:)  Being a monk, I find it my duty to know zones inside and out.  If I hang <br/>\nout in a zone for more than just a casual passthough, I make sure I know <br/>\nthat zone inside and out, as far as spawns, rates of spawns, bad places, <br/>\ngood places, and rare spawns and where items can be found.  I get most of my <br/>\ninformation from web sites.  Alahkazams is the best.  And I tell you, people <br/>\npay if you can guide them to that &#39;rare&#39; item mob.  And even more so they <br/>\nare usually pretty impressed and remember you for future reference.  Doing <br/>\ngood business requires providing a good service.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh and BTW, I said I had traded over 1000 plat of stuff, I never said I had <br/>\nthat in the bank.  Unfortunatly some of the nicer items I have on me now <br/>\npretty much depleted most of my funds.<br/>\n<br/>\nShelza, Karana<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Chris Hennessy &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cdhenness@...\">cdhenness@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: [EQ-Monks] Monkey money<br/>\n&gt;Date: Sat, 12 Feb 2000 02:40:04 +1000<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;1000 pp in the bank for a lvl 18 monk?

As a monk this is really easy to do as monks dont have anything to <br/>\n&gt;spend money on but good armor.  By the time I was 10th level, I had over <br/>\n&gt;100 plat saved, by the time I reached 18th I had bought and sold over 1000 <br/>\n&gt;plat worth of stuff, all done by money and items I have earned myself by <br/>\n&gt;selling loot or trade skills.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Shelza, 18th, Karana.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sparx Dreamreaver<br/>\n&gt;Level 36, Karana<br/>\n&gt;- Resists&#39;R&#39;Us -<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
