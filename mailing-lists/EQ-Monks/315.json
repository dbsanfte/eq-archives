LOL. Seriously, I prob wouldnt<br/>\n&gt; try it <br/>\n&gt; until atleast you havw 200+hp, I bound in grobb and NEVER had a<br/>\n&gt; problem <br/>\n&gt; getting out or killed. Sometimes I would get wacked for 96 twice but<br/>\n&gt; no <br/>\n&gt; more, I NEVER TOOK OVER 200pts at 12th level in dmg. At 7th though he<br/>\n&gt; might <br/>\n&gt; deal you 150 a pop though. I dontn lie, it is dangerous, but I can<br/>\n&gt; testify <br/>\n&gt; at 12th and up it isnt a prob. Both of my monk brothers ae bound in<br/>\n&gt; grobb <br/>\n&gt; and neither has had a problem getting out either. Its a game, take a <br/>\n&gt; chance!, bind in GROBB, but never ever piss off a shin shaman, it&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; humiliating being rooted and beat down!!!!!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
