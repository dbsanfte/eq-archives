Man<br/>\nwas I wrong.  The only thing so far I have found in kurnark that are NOT<br/>\nhostile to my trollie, is the little town in The Overthere, which is a bunch<br/>\nof evil races in an encapment.  If I wasn&#39;t a shaman, I couldn&#39;t bind there,<br/>\nand I cant hunt there because everything is blood red, and scowling.  I made<br/>\nmy way to the iskar city, with a little luck and help from sow, and found<br/>\nthey are scowling and ready to attack.  So I made my way to the good elf<br/>\nencampent, and guess what?  Scowling no less.
