I used those 3 songs with switching instruments<br/>\n&gt;and punches (1-4dmg :) After 18th bards are more powerful using just<br/>\n&gt;music. Had I tried fighting the paladin with my PGT and barbed whip, I<br/>\n&gt;would have been thumped soundly. The problem is those songs are area<br/>\n&gt;effect. You wouldn&#39;t believe the hatred mobs feel for bards, but thats a<br/>\n&gt;rant for another list.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;As for bards pulling, all the songs are low level ones as already posted.<br/>\n&gt;In fact only a handful of bard songs over 20 are any good, which is why I<br/>\n&gt;dont play him much these days.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-Bethorn<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>ok, so i suck and haven&#39;t been delving too much into switching weapons<br/>\nand instruments in combat.  but i&#39;m probly gonna start.  so do the instruments<br/>\nhave to be in the active slot just when the pulse goes off?  or just when you<br/>\nstart the song?  or for the whole time?<br/>\n<br/>\njeff</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
