The paladins can heal themselves in emergencies, and can loh.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1354557766\">Try this group.<br/>\n<br/>\n1 - Monk<br/>\n2 - Paladin<br/>\n3 - Paladin<br/>\n4 - Ranger<br/>\n5- Bard<br/>\n6 - Cleric<br/>\n<br/>\nThe monk pulls.  The paladins can heal themselves in emergencies, and can loh.  The ranger does the snaring.  The bard takes care of the mana regen with a song.  And here&#39;s the beautiful part....  The cleric can buff instead of heal because with this many tanks and the bard singing a heal twisted with the mana regen, it does a remarkable job of keeping everyone in the party topped off.  I&#39;ve been both the healer and the bard in this kind of group, so I know it works.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother beautiful thing about this group is that no one is going to frenzy the mob.  It bounces back and forth between the 4 tanks, distributing damage between them.  It even works this way in a multiple target melee.  The only member you have to babysit is the bard, as the healing song can make the targets angry if it&#39;s used too much, or incorrectly.  A good first step is to not start the song until the targets are in melee.  If she starts the song while the monk is pulling, she makes the target angry before it even sees her.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you find that healing really isn&#39;t being done much (as is often the case in this group), switch the cleric out for a druid.  Then the fun really begins.  You have dots, damage shields, sow, regen, and heals.  A group regen with a bard&#39;s song stacked is a fun thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere aren&#39;t any wizards or other casters around to babysit.  Each caster you add to the group ties up a tank.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Here you go, the ultimate party, around lvl 40+<br/>\n<br/>\n  1- Monk<br/>\n  2- Monk<br/>\n  3- Monk<br/>\n  4- Enchanter<br/>\n  5- Druid<br/>\n  6- Cleric<br/>\n<br/>\n  With fbss and the enchanter&#39;s celerity (39) or swift like wind (49) the monks <br/>\n  can dish an AMAZING amount of dmg.  Enchanter can slow down mobs, and give <br/>\n  all 3 caster types mana faster.  Cleric heals and buffs.  Druids have some <br/>\n  nice DD and DOTS, snare and back up heal.  If you can think of a better group <br/>\n  plz tell me cause I don&#39;t think there is.  No resisting and don&#39;t need a <br/>\n  taunt as the casters more than likely aren&#39;t gonna get jumped.  Not to <br/>\n  mention, if one of the monks is getting beaten too badly, FD and mob will <br/>\n  jump to another of them.  If you have ever seen this kind of group in action, <br/>\n  I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll agree with me.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Kanja<br/>\n  Rodcet Nife<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Click Here<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
