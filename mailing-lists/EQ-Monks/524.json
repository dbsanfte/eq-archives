Certain critters drop it in the <br/>\nfinished state.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, there is a rather plentiful supply of mesh/woven/netted fairly near <br/>\nFreeport, but you have to travel through a fairly dangerous desert to get <br/>\nthere.  If you can find a guide through North Ro, Oasis, and South Ro, you <br/>\ncan get to the swamp where the froglocks roam.   These are the creatures <br/>\nthat drop netted and rarely some woven armor.  If you can find a decent spot <br/>\nthem, you can amass a good amount of netted in a short time.   Woven and <br/>\nMesh armor, while better, is found on higher level frogloks in the dungeon <br/>\nof Guk, which is off of that swamp.<br/>\n<br/>\nThirdly, the Qeynos sewers do have frogloks in them, but getting to Qeynos <br/>\nfrom Freeport is pretty dangerous at your level (hey, no risk no reward, <br/>\nright?).   If you have a good guide (preferably a druid), you should be able <br/>\nto make it, but it&#39;s a very long journey.   However, there are only 3, count <br/>\n&#39;em, 3 froglocks in the sewers.  They are often camped by low level monks of <br/>\nQeynos, but just keep checking back until they are free.   Again, you&#39;ll <br/>\nprobably need a guide to show you exactly where in the sewers to hunt the <br/>\nfroggies.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe choice?   Getting to Qeynos is probably harder than getting to the area <br/>\naround Guk, BUT once you get to Qeynos it&#39;s considerably safer hunting for <br/>\nnetted.  The sewers are a low level dungeon and not much will come after <br/>\nyou.   However, there the swamp has far more frogloks to kill so the netted <br/>\nshould come faster.   It&#39;s all about personal preference at that point.   I <br/>\npersonally would head to the swamp to hunt there, but some people like to <br/>\nhunt near their bind points (you can be bound right outside the sewers, <br/>\nwhereas the swamp is four zones away from a city).<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, you can get this info from higher level monks on your server.  <br/>\nI&#39;ve found monks to be pretty open to helping each other out.<br/>\n<br/>\nDornn, Level 16 monk on Brell Serilis<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Xurlus@...\">Xurlus@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hail Brother&#39;s & Sisters,<br/>\n&gt;Also, I am a Freeport monk, I hear much talk about the sewers of &gt;Qeynos <br/>\n&gt;(think that is the place) But nothing of were to hunt for the &gt;creatures I <br/>\n&gt;am looking for in my area.
