Over the course of the day, we hunted <br/>\nkobolds till the king room opened up for us to hunt.   We finally got in it, <br/>\nbroke the spawn, and had a merry old time (and I got a Large Soiled Bag!  <br/>\nwoo woo!).<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, at the end of the night, me and the mage (Raraielie) went linkdead <br/>\nat the same time.    We came back on to find the party gone and one member&#39;s <br/>\ncorpse (Jagriel) on the ground.   We zone out with kobolds in tow, no <br/>\nproblem.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile going on corpse retrieval, we get into the hall leading to the king <br/>\nroom, are fighting two kobolds when *bam* the mage and I go linkdead again!  <br/>\n  This time me and her log back on to our bind points.   = (<br/>\n<br/>\nShe zones in, finds her corpse and re-joins the party.   However, no one in <br/>\nthe zone sees my corpse anywhere.   No corpse, no res.  So I hoof it back <br/>\nfrom Freeport and did I mention Nektulos and East Commons are REALLY dark at <br/>\nnight?   Anyway I eventually make it back to the team, and I zone into <br/>\nSolusek B (It&#39;s about 2:15am).<br/>\n<br/>\nI start running around jamming my /corpse hotkey.  Corpse IS in zone (yay!) <br/>\nbut never in range of my summon (boo!).   I explore as far as I can without <br/>\nbringing kobolds down on the house, but no dice.    I sit down, file a <br/>\npetition, and prepare to wait a few minutes.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;SYSTEMWIDE MESSAGE:  THE SERVERS ARE COMING DOWN NOW!  LOGOUT NOW!&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nUh oh.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I log into the chat room, and there are a couple guides and GM&#39;s <br/>\nthere who, while trying to be helpful, have no idea what the nature of the <br/>\nproblem is (per usual, can&#39;t the techs give the GM&#39;s SOME idea of what&#39;s <br/>\ngoing on?  = P).   After about a half hour of the inane banter in the chat <br/>\nroom, I call it a night and go to sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nOverall?  Before death I got 2 and half bubbles (so I netted 2 and a <br/>\nquarter) of 45 xp, the nice bag, and some undisclosed amount of platinum.   <br/>\nThe extremely low turnover rate for our group was nice (4 of the 6 people in <br/>\nthe group were there from start to end - about 2pm to 2am).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe got kinda loopy at points, I was trying to decipher the cave paintings in <br/>\nthe rooms,  and I explored an underlava tunnel from the King room lava pool. <br/>\n  At 83 fire resist, I was taking 23 or 27 points per hit from the lava.  <br/>\nThe tunnel goes a way, comes up to a small &quot;way station&quot; type room (Small <br/>\nroom, no exits except through the lava tunnels), and then continues on (I <br/>\nopted not to explore beyond that = P).<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that things were just going too well for us and the game just had to <br/>\nthrow a wrench in it.   = )<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, hopefully tonight I can log on, get my corpse, get a GM ress *crosses <br/>\nfingers*, and continue on my merry way.   Not much time for EQ tonight, but <br/>\nI&#39;ll be on an hour or two.<br/>\n<br/>\nFare well<br/>\n<br/>\nLarn, Brell Serilis<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Lombard.Mikhael&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Mikhael_Lombard@...\">Mikhael_Lombard@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: &quot;&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a>&#39;&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: RE: [EQ-Monks] Werewolf Claw<br/>\n&gt;Date: Wed, 8 Dec 1999 09:02:13 -0800<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;What are you following me around Larn. =) I never did find a stupid group,<br/>\n&gt;so I had our 34th level Shaman buff my Ranger and slaughtered Goblins in <br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;goblin camps in Butcher Block.

To my<br/>\n&gt;understanding, they do NOT drop the claw for the Karg quest.  They drop the<br/>\n&gt;Talon for the crafted breastplate quest.   I believe you can only get a <br/>\n&gt;claw<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;from werewolves in outdoor areas.   Someone please, please correct me if I<br/>\n&gt;am wrong, but I believe this to be true.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Fare well<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Larn, Brell Serilis<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Lombard.Mikhael&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Mikhael_Lombard@...\">Mikhael_Lombard@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;Subject: [EQ-Monks] Werewolf Claw<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Date: Tue, 7 Dec 1999 15:12:46 -0800<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Hi all, I have decided that it is time for me to complete something I <br/>\n&gt;have<br/>\n&gt; &gt;set out to do for quite some time. And that is to get a freaking Werewolf<br/>\n&gt; &gt;claw. Now being one that does not like to run around in the stupid West<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Commonlands, or West Karana asking repetitively anyone have a werewolf on<br/>\n&gt; &gt;tracking let me know! I got so bored and tired so I have decided to go to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Mistmoore and try to get to the dance floor. Now I have been to MM quite <br/>\n&gt;a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;few times but I have never been inside the castle barely even down the <br/>\n&gt;ramp<br/>\n&gt; &gt;towards the castle. mainly the Grave Yard and the zone line. Now I would<br/>\n&gt; &gt;like some help on any suggestions or tips as to what to go or how to go<br/>\n&gt; &gt;about getting to the Dance Room with the Gypsies/Werewolves....i.e. party<br/>\n&gt; &gt;make up and level or a site where there might be a map. Thanks for your<br/>\n&gt; &gt;help.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Kaladiel<br/>\n&gt; &gt;39th Level Monk<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Brell Serilis<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&lt;&lt; text3.html &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&lt;&lt; text3.html &gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
