I&#39;ll have 25 points when I get it.  Is<br/>\ninstill doubt good enough that I should put some of the saved up points into<br/>\nit, instead of the special attack?  Any advice here in either direction?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\tThom Green [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:thom_mg@...\">thom_mg@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tThursday, March 16, 2000 12:58 PM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n\t\tSubject:\tRE: [EQ-Monks] Skills questions<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFrom: &quot;Thom Green&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:thom_mg@...\">thom_mg@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tOh yea, I forgot the stop attacking thingy too.  Hehe.  As<br/>\nfar as instill <br/>\n\t\tdoubt goes, its the hardest skill I have ever had to raise.<br/>\nI hit the <br/>\n\t\tinstill doubt button constantly, targeting anything I can,<br/>\nand I think mine <br/>\n\t\tis like 35th.  And the key to getting it to work is make<br/>\nsure the ONLY thing <br/>\n\t\tyou are doing to your target is auto attack, no special<br/>\nattacks, and your <br/>\n\t\tspecial attacks button has to be up (Tiger Claw, etc) and<br/>\nthen hit your <br/>\n\t\tinstill doubt.  Now, chances are the next result you will<br/>\nsee is it telling <br/>\n\t\tyou &quot;You aren&#39;t scaring anyone&quot;.  Hehe if you are REALLY<br/>\nlucky and get it to <br/>\n\t\twork (I think I have gotten it to work like 3 or 4 times),<br/>\nit should have <br/>\n\t\tthe same effect as the 4th level necro spell, and make them<br/>\nstart to run <br/>\n\t\taway for 10-30 seconds.  Only you don&#39;t get the nifty flying<br/>\nskulls.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
