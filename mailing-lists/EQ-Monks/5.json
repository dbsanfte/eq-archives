At that level just stay in the first few rooms--you won&#39;t get any experience but all frogloks have the potential to drop netted or above.  The tads drop netted, the sentries drop woven and once you are a bit higher the Gaz (which are over the plank of doom) drop mesh which you will want to outfit most of your slots in until it is possible to get the better armor.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone posted you can buy netted gloves for 1-5 gp.  Good luck.  Sellers who get this item know monks need it for magical attacks and sell it for around 2pp on Tunare at least.  Ditto but worse for woven and mesh, which is why it is in your best interest to get as much of it as you can yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeep in mind that monks have a 15 pound weight limit.  If your weight exceeds 15 pounds you take a huge AC hit.  I wore leather for a while and then someone told me about the weight limit and I got rid of every leather item and replaced what I could with woven or mesh and the rest with cloth and my ac shot through the roof.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and eventually the best armor that monks can wear is Green plate, just like every other medium-sized race.  This according to www.gameznet.com/eq besides being huge ac each piece has huge stat modifiers.<br/>\n<br/>\nLurt/Tunare</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
