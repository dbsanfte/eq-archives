His monk is level 33 and is hunting in OT and the experience <br/>\nis pretty darn good (Killing Tigers, Sarnak Knights and other <br/>\nred /con mobs).  I am casting Str, Agi, Dex, Sta, Chloro, Guardian <br/>\n(AC Buff), &#39;tuna (HP Buff), Alacrity, SoW and Burst of Str (Short <br/>\nterm Str buff that stacks with Str) on the Monk.  On the mob, I cast <br/>\nan Melee debuff (-AC, -Str) and a Turgur&#39;s (Slow spell).  When the <br/>\nmob gets less than half health, I send in my pet to help him kill the <br/>\nmob.  I think I can get him to level 40 in the next few days.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy question is:  Where can I take this Monk to level him from 40 - <br/>\n50ish very fast?<br/>\n<br/>\nI was thinking of the Ice Giants outside of Perma.  They are level <br/>\n38 - 42, they are a 6 min spawn but they have a lot of HPs, high AC <br/>\nand do a ton of damage per hit.<br/>\n<br/>\nyour friend,<br/>\n<br/>\nMajeot<br/>\nFennin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
