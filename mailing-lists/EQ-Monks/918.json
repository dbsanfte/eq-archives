That <br/>\nis GMT -5:00 for international monks. :)This will be an <br/>\nongoing event until Sunday Night. Play as little or as <br/>\nmuch of that as you want to. <br/>\n<br/>\nStory: An evil gnome wizard experimenting with cloning <br/>\ncaptured a lone human monk in Freeport, and tried to <br/>\nclone him. He inadvertently triggered a chain reaction <br/>\nand suddenly there spawns many many many monks. All <br/>\nidentical. Being of one mind they are also all of one <br/>\nguild, &quot;The Armadillos of Norrath&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nNaming: This is an event in which monks from all <br/>\nservers who may know each other from messageboards will <br/>\nparticipate. Therefore I think it is a great idea that <br/>\nwe use the naming convention &#39;&quot;your real monk <br/>\nname&quot;dillo&#39;. Or a variation thereof. Such that I am <br/>\ngoing to be Ipnodillo on vallon zek for the weekend. ;) <br/>\n<br/>\nGoal: Have fun. Group up with as many monks as you can <br/>\nand run around the zone punching everything in site. Go <br/>\non suicide missions. We&#39;ll be like ants. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo participate, create a new monk on Vallon Zek Friday <br/>\nNight. The monk should be the male version with the <br/>\nPriest of Discord face. We&#39;re gonna try to create a <br/>\nguild for this as well, so look for a guild officer to <br/>\ninvite you. Please try to keep your guild tunic on at <br/>\nall times so we have the monk &quot;look&quot; about us. Invite <br/>\nall your friends to attend. This is an event to have <br/>\nfun, not so heavy on the roleplaying, but lets just <br/>\nhave a LOT of fun. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo clarify, your monk should look like this: <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shada.com/pod.jpg\">http://www.shada.com/pod.jpg</a><br/>\n <br/>\nThe guild has been submitted. Lets all hope verant <br/>\napproves it! <br/>\n<br/>\nInvite your non monk friends who have always admired <br/>\nyour monkness as well! Lets try and make this event a <br/>\nlegend of it&#39;s own kind! :) <br/>\n<br/>\nJust think. Hundreds of Identical Newbie Monks... <br/>\n<br/>\nIpno Ashen<br/>\n20th Armadillo<br/>\nBrell Serilis<br/>\n&quot;The future just isn&#39;t what it used to be.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------------------------------------------<br/>\nThis mail sent through newave.net webmail.
