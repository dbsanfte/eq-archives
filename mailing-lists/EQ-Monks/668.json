The whole reason people say that is so<br/>\n&gt;they can justify what ever they do even when they are wrong.  This is a<br/>\n&gt;roleplaying game with many many people playing at one time.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;sarcasm on&gt;<br/>\nyah i&#39;ve never heard anyone justify whatever wrong thing they were doing by<br/>\nsaying<br/>\n&#39;&#39;oh but i was roleplaying&#39;&#39;.<br/>\n&lt;sarcasm off&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSee massive debate on eqvault forum probly 6-8 weeks ago where people were <br/>\narguing that it is fine to train other players if they were &#39;&#39;defending<br/>\ntheir homeland&#39;&#39;,<br/>\ni.e. roleplaying.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;A massive multiplayer game right?  Massively Multiplayer.....i think<br/>\n&gt;everyone can agree with that.  And wheather or not you realize it<br/>\n&gt;everything you do has an effect on the other people who play the game. <br/>\n&gt;Every orc pawn you kill, every foraged piece of food you drop...it all has<br/>\n&gt;an effect on the other people on the server.  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Now that we have that understood....lets talk about twinking.  Everytime<br/>\n&gt;you twink you take something away from someone who is at the right level<br/>\n&gt;to have that item.  At 19 or 17 or 22 or whatever level he was...he took<br/>\n&gt;away an executioners hood from some 45th+ level character.  He took the<br/>\n&gt;serpentine bracers away from some 40th+ level character who deserved it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why is that the case?  I had my level 26 bard in blackburrow last week.  no<br/>\none was in the big commander room.  so i killed a bunch of them.  Who did<br/>\nI deny that loot to?  No one.  If I hadn&#39;t been there, no one would have<br/>\nkilled<br/>\nthem.  In fact I have done good, I have generated *more* loot for the level<br/>\n12ish<br/>\ncrowd to have.  That&#39;s 10 more onyx earrings and spiked collars and studded<br/>\ncollars that otherwise would not have existed.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich seems to bring up a tangent<br/>\nthat I just thought of.  Are you actually saying that hi level guys should<br/>\nnot be<br/>\nkilling lower level mobs to get loot?  Or is the act of giving the loot to<br/>\na lower<br/>\nlevel character the problem?  Is it bad for a lower level char to give the<br/>\nloot to a<br/>\nhigher level character?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;And it&#39;s not the fact that he can go and get another one...it&#39;s the fact<br/>\n&gt;that he is just going to have to wait that much longer because there is<br/>\n&gt;some chump monk who can&#39;t earn his own equipment...he has to have older<br/>\n&gt;friends help him out or just use his own older character to get things for<br/>\n&gt;him cause he can&#39;t play the game like it was meant to be played.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If the 40th level character wasn&#39;t camping the mob who dropped the bracers<br/>\nhe doesn&#39;t &#39;&#39;deserve&#39;&#39; it any more than any schmuck wandering around in<br/>\ngreater<br/>\nfaydark.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;I hate twinking and i hate twinkers because you take things away from<br/>\n&gt;people who rightfully deserve those items.  I don&#39;t care if your 48th<br/>\n&gt;level kill stealing wizard had to shoot down the hopes of a group of 45th<br/>\n&gt;levels to get the item....you still took it from them and gave it to<br/>\n&gt;someone who is 1/2 their age...maybe younger.  Everytime you twink an item<br/>\n&gt;you screw someone who REALLY AND TRULEY DESERVES THE ITEM.   <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ahhh, you seem to be confusing/lumping kill stealing and twinking.  I<br/>\ntwinked my<br/>\npaladin with stuff that my bard found.  (my monk is on a different server)<br/>\nI never stole<br/>\nany loot or kills from any other party.  i don&#39;t like kill stealing any<br/>\nmore than the<br/>\nnext guy.  but that is outside of the realm of this discussion; we are<br/>\ntalking about<br/>\ntwinking, the act of giving items to a lower level character that couldn&#39;t<br/>\nkill the mob<br/>\nby himself.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;I think the one thing that people don&#39;t realize about this game and any<br/>\n&gt;other game is that it is everyones responsibility to provide a roleplaying<br/>\n&gt;environment.  it is EVERYONES responsibility to PROVIDE a ROLEPLAYING<br/>\n&gt;ENVIRONMENT....it is a massively multiplayer roleplaying game after<br/>\n&gt;all..... <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You can roleplay whatever you want.  Twinking has nothing to do with that.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhee&#39;s father was a tough dwarven adventurer with much experience who has<br/>\ntravelled the world and collected much knowledge and treasure.
