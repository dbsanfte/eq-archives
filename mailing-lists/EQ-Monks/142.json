A moment later,<br/>\n&gt;a Hag came around the corner and cast on our paladin. I FD successfully and<br/>\n&gt;everyone else runs, with the Hag in pursuit. The MoB I was fighting however,<br/>\n&gt;the non-casting mummy that had given me the rabies, continued to beat on me.<br/>\n&gt;I stood up, just me and the Mummy now, FD successfully again, and end up<br/>\n&gt;getting killed by the mummy. My question is twofold... 1) Is rabies<br/>\n&gt;considered a DoT? I know it says &quot;You resist the weak disease spell&quot; or<br/>\n&gt;something similar, but actually thought that was a bug since the mummy does<br/>\n&gt;not cast any spells. 2) If we a re hit by a DoT, does that nullify the use<br/>\n&gt;of FD? I ask this because since a previous spell is affecting us, does the<br/>\n&gt;cast then know that we are not dead?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thoughts?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Praelor<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;btw... I contacted a guide about this and was told &quot;Sometimes monsters just<br/>\n&gt;aren&#39;t fooled by feign death, even if you are successful&quot;.  Excuse me, but<br/>\n&gt;if they aren&#39;t fooled, exactly HOW are we successful??<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
