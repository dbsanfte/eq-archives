Just plain 1H staff.  You can buy them at<br/>\nvendors (I bought mine in FV).  Then, since I was terrible at them (and they<br/>\nwere kinda heavy), I fought in High Keep till my skill was maxed.  In HK,<br/>\nyou almost never get into trouble, and there&#39;s almost always a Warrior or<br/>\nRanger taunting the heck out of the gobbies, so you don&#39;t have to worry about<br/>\nyour AC problems from being overweight.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd Finally, for 2H blunt, shout around for a bamboo bo stick.  The stats are<br/>\nterrible, so monks usually give them away.  I got mine for free, and I twinked<br/>\nsome green monk with it when I bought something better.
