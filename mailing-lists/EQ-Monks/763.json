Enchanter can slow down mobs, and give <br/>\nall 3 caster types mana faster.  Cleric heals and buffs.  Druids have some <br/>\nnice DD and DOTS, snare and back up heal.  If you can think of a better group <br/>\nplz tell me cause I don&#39;t think there is.  No resisting and don&#39;t need a <br/>\ntaunt as the casters more than likely aren&#39;t gonna get jumped.  Not to <br/>\nmention, if one of the monks is getting beaten too badly, FD and mob will <br/>\njump to another of them.  If you have ever seen this kind of group in action, <br/>\nI&#39;m sure you&#39;ll agree with me.<br/>\n<br/>\nKanja<br/>\nRodcet Nife</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
