I do not<br/>\ncarry any bags. I also only loot gem stones, words and runes or other low<br/>\nweight items. Lately, I have been adventuring in Unrest, so all of my fine<br/>\nsteel goes to my allies, and I try to horn in on the occasional piece of<br/>\namber,<br/>\npearl or topaz. They have similar sell back rates to merchants, so it does not<br/>\naffect the kind of income you bring in. Weight to AC ratio has never been a<br/>\nqualifying factor for me. If we have learned anything these past few weeks, it<br/>\nis that physical attributes have little affect on melee classes, while AC<br/>\nkeeps<br/>\nus all alive. The higher AC I can fit on me and still remain under 14 stones,<br/>\nthe better. But, as you say, it is personal preference.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Quellious&#39;s Name,<br/>\n<br/>\nManjushri Bodhisattva<br/>\nBearer of the Red Sash of the Ashen Order<br/>\n(Fennin Ro)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
