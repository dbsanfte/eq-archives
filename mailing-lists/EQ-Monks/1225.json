Near the entrance of<br/>\nRunny Eye, there is a 6 min spawn at the first fork. At the exact same spot<br/>\nthere is also the long spawn. Both are waderers but they don&#39;t go very far.<br/>\nBe there every 70 min to kill it, and you are ok. That&#39;s the way it worked<br/>\nfor all the monks who got it. Unfortunately, I have camped it every day for<br/>\nat least 11 hours, for a total of may be 120 hours, and he never spawned,<br/>\nexcept when I was gone... Today will be my last day on it. Back to leveling,<br/>\nI have spent enough useless time.<br/>\n <br/>\nTsin Suchiko<br/>\n38th rank, Tunare.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jaden@...\">jaden@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jaden@...\">jaden@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, January 21, 2000 7:32 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Eq-Monks@onelist.com\">Eq-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [EQ-Monks] Treant Fists<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jaden@...\">jaden@...</a> (Josh Herron) <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWell even though they are just a dex +3 goves.  I&#39;ve been camping them<br/>\nanyways.  I have all the components but the humorous handled mace.  I camped<br/>\nit for about 9 hours yesterday.  Killed every gobbo i came across.  Somebody<br/>\ntold me that the alchamists is a seven hour spawn, and that the placeholder<br/>\nis a wondering goblin.  So first thing you do is wonder through beholder and<br/>\nkill every single goblin you come accross.  I logged on at 7:40 MTN and a<br/>\nguy there said he had spawn at around 7:00.  Well good hunting to you all,<br/>\nand i hope you put this info to good use.<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\n &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://adforce.imgis.com/?adlink|\">http://adforce.imgis.com/?adlink|</a>2.0|2|82041|1|1|misc=1220;loc=300;&gt;<br/>\nONElist Sponsor <br/>\nPlease click above to support our sponsor<br/>\n<br/>\n  _____</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
