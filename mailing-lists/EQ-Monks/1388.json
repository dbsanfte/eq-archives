I haven&#39;t gone to bed yet.  Spent from 1:15am until<br/>\njust now slaughtering goblins in Misty Thicket trying to get the damn<br/>\nalchemist to spawn.  No luck.  Even petitioned just before the servers were<br/>\ngoing to come down to see if they could make him spawn for me.  No dice. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAh well... I hope my next attempt later today won&#39;t last as long as this one<br/>\ndid.  I&#39;m exhausted.<br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully the servers will be up when I wake up.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Raean Bloodyhands, 26th monk, Tunare.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nGet what you deserve with NextCard Visa.
