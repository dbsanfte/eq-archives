On <br/>\nour way there, we stopped off at one of our favorite places that <br/>\nhappened to be open so that we could do some &quot;warming up&quot;.  The group <br/>\nconsisted of a warrior, a druid, 2 clerics and myself - a monk. <br/>\nBeing a monk, I went about doing my Feign Pull magic so that we could <br/>\nsplit the mobs we faced.  This is where things started to go wrong.<br/>\n\tI had heard rumors that FD had been seriously nerfed on the <br/>\ntest server, but a monk I have on that server was not yet high enough <br/>\nto verify this, so I had to put those observations down as just that <br/>\n- rumor.  Sadly, it seems that the patch which went in yesterday <br/>\nimplements this change.  The bottom line is that after some time <br/>\nexperimenting both with my group and with &#39;faction neutral&#39; observers <br/>\nalong the pull path we came to the conclusion that FD has been nerfed <br/>\n- badly.<br/>\n\tIt seems that any creature which is aggro to you when you <br/>\nfeign will immediately come screaming back after you once you get up. <br/>\nThis includes mobs which have returned back to their &#39;home&#39; position <br/>\nand even after having waited several minutes.  For any and all <br/>\npractical purposes, this kills the ability to feign pull.  As this <br/>\nrealization came upon us, we were all shocked and somewhat confused. <br/>\nWe were not aware that this had been a problem which was in need of <br/>\n&#39;balancing&#39;.  This goes far beyond nerfing a single class, mind you - <br/>\nit is a drastic and very serious change which affects every single <br/>\ngroup which includes a monk of greater than 17th level.  It also <br/>\naffects those multi-group arrangements which utilize monks to help <br/>\nsplit mega-mobs (fire giants in Sol B, for example).<br/>\n\tI am keeping a strong leash on my ranting and raving until I <br/>\ncan receive some kind of confirmation or contradiction of our <br/>\nobservations of last night.  Is there anybody out there who can offer <br/>\nfirst-hand information?
