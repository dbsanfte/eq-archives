After all, we&#39;re supposed to have turned our bodies into living<br/>\nweapons.  :)  Some items that give big increases to Dodge, or Block (Gloves<br/>\nor Bracers of Blocking, perhaps?) would be much more appropriate to the way<br/>\nI feel the class should be.  No flashy magics.  Perhaps a Jump ability<br/>\nenabling you to jump across distances, or reach higher things.<br/>\n<br/>\nI recently sold all of my items (Raean,18th level monk on Tunare) and am<br/>\ngoing to be hanging around Freeport helping newbies out when I want to take<br/>\na break from my other characters.  I just got too bored.  I already had full<br/>\nmesh with a Lockjaw Tunic. I was pretty much set until I could get into Fear<br/>\nand get shiverback (silverback?) armor, didn&#39;t have a regular group, and had<br/>\ntrouble finding ones all the time, so I was forced to solo.  Just got<br/>\ndisillusioned with being a Monk.  I loved being able to dish out damage, and<br/>\nnot needing to spend a billion platinum to get things, but it&#39;d be nice to<br/>\nget some &quot;cool stuff&quot; during the next 30 levels, besides new jewelry.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my two cents.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
