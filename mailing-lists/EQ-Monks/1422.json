Offer to help them get the items they need,<br/>\nand most of the time, they&#39;ll be happy to help you get what you need.  I got<br/>\na few of my items in the pleasant surprise manner - helping out someone<br/>\nmanaged to get me something I wasn&#39;t expecting - like the Black Silk Gloves.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 21 you&#39;re doing fine - people will probably tell you to buy this or that,<br/>\nbut you have about the same that I had at 21.  The great thing about monks<br/>\nis they don&#39;t absolutely positively have to have a lot of gear, because in a<br/>\ngood group, they&#39;re hitting more than they&#39;re getting hit, but can take a<br/>\nfew hits if need be.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a personal Zen moment:  If you make the game solely about the<br/>\nacquisition of items, you&#39;re going to have two things happen:  #1 - you&#39;ll<br/>\nget *Real* bored camping the items or camping money for the items #2 -<br/>\nyou&#39;ll eventually top out, with no more cool gear to get and get bored.<br/>\nThat&#39;s my experience with it anyways.  Not to say that getting stuff isn&#39;t<br/>\ncool; it is fun to get that item you want or to get to the next level.  I&#39;ve<br/>\njust seen too often people get item-jealousy and then the game gets<br/>\nstressful (HURRY UP!  THE 5 LEGGED CROC SPAWNS IN 12 SECONDS!) and no fun.<br/>\nThat&#39;s just my opinion, thought I&#39;d make someone suffer it today. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n*Unnamed Monk, Level 35*<br/>\n*Quellious*<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Currey, Mick [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mick_currey@...\">mick_currey@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, February 25, 2000 10:48 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [EQ-Monks] What are YOU wearing<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Currey, Mick&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mick_currey@...\">mick_currey@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy first question is how did all of you get such great armor?
