But still,<br/>\n&gt; PCs win simply because of numbers and tactics.  Unfortunately,<br/>\n&gt; numbers will not always win because of hardware constraints<br/>\n&gt; and tactics are systematically being made illegal by Verant.<br/>\n&gt; Basically this game will come down to pushing a button or 2<br/>\n&gt; every few seconds without the need for thinking.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n    Exactly, this was my point.  Thanks for making it clear.  EQ is<br/>\ngradually going downhill, the economy is getting saturated, Verant is making<br/>\nintelligence and ingenuity less and less possible.
