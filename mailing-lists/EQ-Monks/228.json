Burt&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:noahburt@...\">noahburt@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On the same thread of persistence...<br/>\n&gt; I headed over to Crushbone the other night to try and<br/>\n&gt; find some Bracers of Battle. A friend said he would<br/>\n&gt; help me out but by the time I got there he had to go<br/>\n&gt; .So I hung out for a while, not knowing where the<br/>\n&gt; warlord showed up. I missed him quite a few times and<br/>\n&gt; was getting frustrated so I logged off. Last night I<br/>\n&gt; decided  iwould try for a ltitle while longer before<br/>\n&gt; seeking ym fortune elsewhere. I found a party with<br/>\n&gt; another monk (more on him later) and a kindly Druid.<br/>\n&gt; Since I initiated the party it was agreed that I would<br/>\n&gt; get the first BoB. (in the meantime my friend came<br/>\n&gt; through and got me one BoB so now I only needed one).<br/>\n&gt; The other monk need one BoB as well so he would get<br/>\n&gt; the next. Our Druid friend was looking for Crush&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; armor so she was to get that. Now, my philosophy in<br/>\n&gt; partying is that the group works together in order to<br/>\n&gt; get all the items the various party members want<br/>\n&gt; (within reason) so it was my thinking that I would<br/>\n&gt; stay grouped with them until we got 2 BoBs (one for<br/>\n&gt; each monk) and Crush&#39;s armor. Well, second Warlord we<br/>\n&gt; got had a BoB so I was all set. Feeling loyalty to my<br/>\n&gt; party memebrs for helping me, I vowed to stay on and<br/>\n&gt; help them both achieve their goals. We got another<br/>\n&gt; warlord (who did nto have the BoB) and got Crush when<br/>\n&gt; we could. I noticed the monk was rushing to loot Crush<br/>\n&gt; every time so I asked that he reserve the looting for<br/>\n&gt; the Druid, since she needed his loot. About the third<br/>\n&gt; time Crush went down, the monk sprinted for his corpse<br/>\n&gt; and looted it. Happy for our victory, both the druid<br/>\n&gt; and I asked if Crush had the armor. The monk was<br/>\n&gt; silent for a while but eventually (after we asked a<br/>\n&gt; few more times) admitted that he did. &quot;great!&quot; said I<br/>\n&gt; and proceeded to ask if he would please hand it to the<br/>\n&gt; druid. He said &quot;When I get my BoB she can have Crush&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; armor.&quot; (For future reference to all who are reading,<br/>\n&gt; that is not a good way to inspire loyalty) The druid<br/>\n&gt; and I exchanged a few /tells and shesaid that she<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t need it terribly so she didn&#39;t care much. I<br/>\n&gt; told her  Iwould do I all I could to make sure he got<br/>\n&gt; his BoB so she could have the armor and then she and I<br/>\n&gt; would leave him behind. The monk then had the audacity<br/>\n&gt; to say that he had to go to town and sell things,<br/>\n&gt; leaving the two of us to get &quot;his&quot; BoB. having a<br/>\n&gt; harder time of it with just 2, we missed a warlord<br/>\n&gt; spawn and she got killed by Crush. The monk decided to<br/>\n&gt; take his sweet time egtting back too so by the time he<br/>\n&gt; returned, we were fed up and wanted to leave. He,<br/>\n&gt; innocently might I add, asks where we are going and we<br/>\n&gt; informed him that:<br/>\n&gt; A) Greed is a poor quality in a monk<br/>\n&gt; B) He was one of the worst group members we had ever<br/>\n&gt; been with<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We left him there and went on our way. Now, the moral<br/>\n&gt; of the story is this. Having lied to us once already<br/>\n&gt; by stealing the armor, we did not trust him to ever<br/>\n&gt; give it back. Therefore, why would we help him? There<br/>\n&gt; would be many more chances to get Crush and his armor<br/>\n&gt; (which I plan to do for my new friend, btw) and we did<br/>\n&gt; not need his poor company.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Forgive my ramblings but in EQ ,as in life, you will<br/>\n&gt; get farther with honesty and loyalty than with<br/>\n&gt; mistrust and greed. If he had handed the armor over I<br/>\n&gt; would have been sure to help him since we would then<br/>\n&gt; have only needed the one BoB. His greed cost him our<br/>\n&gt; help.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks for listening and may truth guide you<br/>\n&gt; Brother Kingdok<br/>\n&gt; Monk of Erollisi Marr<br/>\n&gt; 19th Circle<br/>\n&gt; Man at Arms of the Magius Knights<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; How do you enter ONElistï¿½s WEEKLY DRAWING for $100?<br/>\n&gt; By joining the FRIENDS & FAMILY program.
