I bought every piece of armor I have, I have never even<br/>\nbeen to Guk.  What worked for me is killing wisps by the hundreds in W<br/>\nCommons.  Greater Lightstones are few and far between, but when you get<br/>\nthem, NPC&#39;s will pay 4+ pp for each (PC&#39;s even more) and even regular<br/>\nlightstones are good for 8-9 gp.  Besides this, I had 2+ full sets of netted<br/>\narmor in the sewers beneath qeynos that i sold for about 1pp each - gave<br/>\naway the last 5 pieces to a very cute lvl 4 female monk last night :)  So<br/>\nno, you don&#39;t have to travel to Guk.<br/>\n<br/>\nI paid anywhere between 4-8 plat per piece of mesh and 2-4 plat per woven<br/>\npiece.  Whether it&#39;s a good deal or not depends on how badly you want it,<br/>\nand how badly the seller wants to sell it :)  I did most of my auctioning in<br/>\nFreeport, E & W Comm, but have been told on several occasions that prices<br/>\nget much cheaper as you go into zones closer to Guk.  I auctioned<br/>\n*constantly* for over a week to get my mesh (I was surprised how fast it<br/>\nwent!)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt lvl 10, you&#39;re probly not ready to solo wisps yet.  I would suggest<br/>\nkilling orcs at the 2 orc camps in E Comm until lvl 12 or 13.  Also, you do<br/>\nknow that you need magical gloves (at least netted) to fight wisps, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nGood Luck,<br/>\n<br/>\nFistar, lvl 15 monk, Tarrew Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Moe Drippins &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ug@...\">ug@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, July 08, 1999 3:25 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ-Monks] Mesh armor<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Moe Drippins &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ug@...\">ug@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mox1@...\">mox1@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I am new to this list so I don&#39;t know if you guys have discussed this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; before.
