At this point in the game, we really can&#39;t<br/>\nchange how the Cleric class works. There are too many people who chose the<br/>\nclass because of the way that it is. I do appreciate your suggestions, and<br/>\nwill use them if we ever work on another project similar to EQ.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nso with this staement in mind remove the word cleric and insert the word<br/>\nmonk !
