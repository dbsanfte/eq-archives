When you<br/>\nzone out from Freeport into the desert area (sorry, forgot the name) stay on<br/>\nyour left &#39;till you come to the hut/house near the mntn. Almost directly up<br/>\nthe mntn from there I have fallen 10 times per trip consistently and<br/>\nsometimes 11. Falling that many times you REALLY raise your Safe Fall<br/>\nquickly. When I was lvl 15ish I maxed out that lvl&#39;s worth in under 5 min.<br/>\nreal time.

Climb up as far as you can,<br/>\n&gt; face outward, and hit autorun. Depending on where you are on the cliff<br/>\nside,<br/>\n&gt; you should get 4 &quot;falls&quot; that don&#39;t incur any damage but do kick in Safe<br/>\n&gt; Fall. You&#39;ll get increases in a hurry using this method. Prior to this, I<br/>\n&gt; was using the Temple of Marr in North Freeport... What a tedious chore<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; was!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And yes, keep those bandages on hand -- they will save your life. The only<br/>\n&gt; problem with Mage-summoned bandages is that they poof when you log out and<br/>\n&gt; sometimes it&#39;s a pain trying to get back to a town with a bank. My bind<br/>\n&gt; wound skill is up to 111 and I can heal almost 30 hitpoints with one<br/>\n&gt; bandage. I always recommend keeping all your &quot;non-combat&quot; skills maxxed<br/>\nout.<br/>\n&gt; Swimming, sense heading, safe fall (sneak to 113 &lt;g&gt;), Feign Death. I make<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; point of trying to max these out as soon as I attain a higher rank.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Where to go at 22? Lake Rathetear might be a good spot for you to solo.<br/>\n&gt; There&#39;s an island with a huge ramp. On the ramp are three Aviak Guards. Go<br/>\n&gt; up the ramp, target a bird, engage and run down the ramp.  All three birds<br/>\n&gt; will come after you. Back up to the mountainside and let them get as close<br/>\n&gt; to you as you dare and feign death. They immediately go non-agro on you so<br/>\n&gt; you can stand back up right away. They stand there looking confused for a<br/>\n&gt; minute and then they start the trip back up the ramp to their spawn<br/>\npoints.<br/>\n&gt; If all goes well, the separate enough so you can pick one off easily and<br/>\n&gt; engage him. Great experience at that level and sometimes you get bronze<br/>\n&gt; weapons and gold pieces. If you can get a small group together or a<br/>\npartner<br/>\n&gt; (one who can heal, hopefully &lt;g&gt;), try out &quot;Gargoyle&quot; Island in the Ocean<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; Tears. Good experience and if you&#39;re lucky enough to get Gargoyle Eyes --<br/>\n&gt; great loot too.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hope this helps.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Jeff Bleich &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dolph@...\">dolph@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Date: Wednesday, September 08, 1999 11:57 AM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EQ-Monks] Safe Fall Tip<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Jeff Bleich&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dolph@...\">dolph@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Wow thanks for the tips , I heard another good place is Dagnors Cauldren.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Bandages are very expensive if no mages are on and very heavy but thier a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;must.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Any one have any sugesstions on where to hunt for 20th? im killing Gorge<br/>\n&gt; &gt;hounds now going to get 22 proabbly, but where do i go from thier unrest<br/>\ni<br/>\n&gt; &gt;heard? or guk?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Proabbly no warrior types that have ton of ac but any help would be<br/>\ngreat.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Bismatal 20th Monk of CT<br/>\n&gt; &gt;----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: Ezhar Montenegro &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Ezhar@...\">Ezhar@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Sent: Wednesday, September 08, 1999 12:36 PM<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Subject: [EQ-Monks] Safe Fall Tip<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; From: &quot;Ezhar Montenegro&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Ezhar@...\">Ezhar@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I meant to say a spot that you&#39;d normally take damage from, if you<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;have safe fall. :)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Depending on where you are Young Brother, the steep mountain walls<br/>\n&gt; outside<br/>\n&gt; &gt;of Freeport are good Safe Fall training spots (any steep wall could<br/>\nsuffice<br/>\n&gt; &gt;though).  I saw this tip posted on a monk board.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Outside of FP, either in East Commons or North Ro, the mountains to the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;side of the inner zones are great places to train that skill up.  You do<br/>\n&gt; not<br/>\n&gt; &gt;need to take damage, just as long as you make that skipping sound as you<br/>\n&gt; &gt;descend.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Find an almost sheer wall, back up all the way to the top then run<br/>\ndown.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Every time you trip, you will up your chances for a skill increase.  Back<br/>\n&gt; up<br/>\n&gt; &gt;to the top, then repeat.  I did this a few nights ago at the FP/NRo wall<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;managed to get 45 skill increases in about 30 minutes...(now 112)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Use caution and make sure you do not jump off the top of the cliff<br/>\n(some<br/>\n&gt; &gt;have flat spots at the top that you can launch from), I only did this to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;train my Bind Wound, taking 275 DMG 2 times to lower my HPs (608 total).<br/>\n&gt; If<br/>\n&gt; &gt;you have less HPs, you could be doomed.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; You may even get some odd stares from passers-by like I did; &#39;What&#39;s<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Monk doing?&#39;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; :)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Safe training to you Brothers and Sisters.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Ezhar Montenegro<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Proud Member of the Platinum Sphere Guild<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.platinumsphere.com\">http://www.platinumsphere.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; --------------------------- ONElist<br/>\nSponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ONElist:  your connection to online communities.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Show your ONElist SPIRIT!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/tshirt2\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/tshirt2</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;With a new ONElist SHIRT available through our website.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  your connection to online communities.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
