I currently sport a<br/>\nShackle of Steel and Shackle of Bronze.<br/>\nShackle of Bronze: 6 ac 5 vs magic 0.2 weight.<br/>\nShackle of Steel: 9 ac 5 str 5 sta 5 vs magic 0.1 weight.<br/>\nThe Shackle of Bronze quest can be done in your high 20&#39;s low 30&#39;s with a<br/>\ngroup I&#39;d say.  Mostly for safety, and the pieces in Permafrost and Frontier<br/>\nMountains, the rest is foraging and an easy quest.<br/>\nThe Shackle of Steel in your low to mid 40&#39;s with a group.  That Droga<br/>\nsection can be tough.<br/>\nFenedar<br/>\nInnoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone is going to do the shackle quests, and they have not finished all<br/>\nneeded factions, but are going to use illlusions or wolf  form I suggest<br/>\ngathering all the items upto the shackle of Copper and getting the box for<br/>\nshackle of Bronze.  the actual shackle is givin out by Master Rinmark in<br/>\nTimourous Deep.  and he initiates the shackle of Steel aswell.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________<br/>\nFREE Personalized Email at Mail.com<br/>\nSign up at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mail.com/?sr=signup\">http://www.mail.com/?sr=signup</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
