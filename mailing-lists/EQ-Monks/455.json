If you consider since monks have to put<br/>\nsome strength into the punch, their speed can&#39;t be too fast.  But on the<br/>\nother hand, warrior types can upgrade their weapons, in both damage and<br/>\nspeed, monks only get upgrades in damage, i&#39;d like to see us get a speed<br/>\nupgrade too.  Because if a person wields a pain bringer and a ykesha, they<br/>\nwill easily outdamage a monk, because both of the weapons are sub 30 delay,<br/>\npain bringer is closer to 20.  Nonetheless, monks are supposed to be the<br/>\nultimate melee dishers, that makes up for the extreme hp loss.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBroy</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
