It&#39;s a deal for them &#39;cause <br/>\nthey can sell it to a vendor for 3 - 5 plat, and it&#39;s a deal for me because <br/>\nI at least get some cash out of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason that I loot at all as opposed to taking just the spit is pretty <br/>\nsimple, you&#39;ll make a lot more if you loot it.  If you haven&#39;t noticed, the <br/>\nsplit isn&#39;t always equal between the looter and the rest of the group.  For <br/>\na split to happen there must be at least as many coins of a given type as <br/>\nthere are group members.  Example:  Your group kills a critter that has 5 <br/>\ngold on it.  If there are 4 people in the group, the looter gets 2 gold, <br/>\neveryone else gets 1. If there are 5 people, 1 coin each.  If there are <br/>\nsix, the looter gets all 5 coins and everyone else gets the shaft.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrothers and Sisters, next time you think that you don&#39;t need much cash <br/>\nsend a tell to a master jeweler and ask them how much the high end black <br/>\npearl (agi/dex) jewelry costs.  I have seen the plain jewels themselves <br/>\nsell for over 50 platinum in auction on Tarew Marr, and they aren&#39;t in as <br/>\nmuch demand as fire emeralds (str/dex).<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care,<br/>\nDorath Quickfist<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom:\tRobb Flynn<br/>\nSent:\tTuesday, July 06, 1999 9:01 AM<br/>\nTo:\t&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject:\tRe: [EQ-Monks] Weight<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Robb Flynn &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:RobF@...\">RobF@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nhehe yeah... but I look at it this way.. I wasn&#39;t expecting anything. All I<br/>\never say is along the lines of &quot;The weight hurts me and I won&#39;t be near as<br/>\neffective to you, so I&#39;ll just take the coin split&quot;. The pally had been<br/>\nlugging it around, and fighting with it, and gave me 15pp out of his sense<br/>\nof honor and duty. I have found that alot of people I group with are like<br/>\nthis. I have never asked for a split on the sale of loot, and rarely loot,<br/>\nif at all loot items myself. I only do if I am seeking a particular item.

I.e., when I was level 10ish or so I found<br/>\n&gt; that wearing a full suit of leather actually gave me more AC than trying<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; stay under 14 weight, but at level 23 each increase of 1 weight over 14<br/>\n&gt; yields a pretty nasty loss in AC.  My guess is the monk you asked about<br/>\n&gt; weight was probably at a lower level where indeed weight doesn&#39;t seem to<br/>\n&gt; matter that much.  Rest assured though, it starts to very quickly in the<br/>\n&gt; teens.  Like Praelor said, you really want to start trying to find<br/>\n&gt; woven/mesh to replace the leather asap.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Praelor, you got 15pp as a share of a full suit of bronze?  Ouch man, I<br/>\n&gt; think you got jobbed :)  Most of those pieces on E-Marr go for 20pp+ <br/>\n </span></blockquote>each.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; In answer to the second original question, assuming Verant took the<br/>\n&gt; standard<br/>\n&gt; use of AC from RPG&#39;s time immemorial, AC generally affects your chance of<br/>\n&gt; being hit as well as how much damage you take when you do get hit.  You<br/>\n&gt; can<br/>\n&gt; test this by dueling a like-level friend with low AC, than having them<br/>\n&gt; wear<br/>\n&gt; all their armor and/or using a few AC buffs and dueling again.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hope that helps some,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - Chai, Taunter of Happy Fun Ball (E-Marr)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; PS:  If loot is what&#39;s bumping your weight up, there are several pouches<br/>\n&gt; you<br/>\n&gt; can use that cut the weight by a % on items you put in them.  The easiest<br/>\n&gt; ones to get are probably the ones Nillipus loads (Rivervale/dale<br/>\n&gt; whatever),<br/>\n&gt; and I hear there&#39;s an orc in High Hold Pass that loads a nice one too.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; read you can actually use a large sewing kit as well (don&#39;t hit combine),<br/>\n&gt; but I haven&#39;t tested that one personally.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Robb Flynn [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:RobF@...\">RobF@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, July 06, 1999 6:14 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EQ-Monks] Weight<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: Robb Flynn &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:RobF@...\">RobF@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Weight most definatley does AC.
