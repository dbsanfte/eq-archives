I assume people who are not consumed with haggling down<br/>\n  &gt;to the last cp, screwing you over, or obsessing over trade values are<br/>\n  &gt;the stupid people?  Ever thought that people may have been stupid<br/>\n  &gt;because they liked you, were in a hurry, or much preferred the item<br/>\n  &gt;you had to trade?<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt;No big deal, just the expression annoyed me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Annoyed me to when I went back and read it.  I think I mis-phrased what<br/>\n  I was trying to say.  Some people were being very generous in the prices<br/>\n  they wanted for some items.  You are most certainly right though, I was<br/>\n  out of line in my comments.<br/>\n<br/>\n  -- <br/>\n<br/>\n  Hammeron<br/>\n  Monk of Quellious<br/>\n  Karana<br/>\n<br/>\n  --<br/>\n  Worlord<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:worlord@...\">worlord@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Please click above to support our sponsor<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
