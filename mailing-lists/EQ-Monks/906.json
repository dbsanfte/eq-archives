Is there anyway to prevent a PC thief from picking your pockets? ( He<br/>\n&gt;&gt;was a PC, because I wasn&#39;t allowed to attack him, even though he was my<br/>\n&gt;&gt;current target.)

A quick kick or throw would end that problem.   I have a hard<br/>\n&gt;&gt;time believing that some Shadowknight or Necro is going to stand there<br/>\n&gt;&gt;while some little sneak thief makes off with their hard earned money or<br/>\n&gt;&gt;items.
