I group regularly <br/>\nwith two rangers and a druid. After a MOB is snared, drop on a dose of <br/>\ndoubt and proceed to hit said MOB in the back... The problem is that <br/>\nInstill is so slow to improve. Basically, you need to practice it on <br/>\neverything. When you are sailing on the boat, target the boat and practice <br/>\nInstill Doubt. Practice it while targeting a friend or a random corpse in <br/>\nUnrest while healing up. You can even practice it while feigned, sitting, <br/>\nor twiddling your thumbs : ).<br/>\n<br/>\nVery entertaining to watch creatures run away in fear... Not certain how <br/>\nfear works with root, but if you were soloing and could accommodate your <br/>\nweight so that you could carry a Treant Staff, it might be fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 12:03 PM 3/16/00 -0600, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Currey, Mick&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mick_currey@...\">mick_currey@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Make sure to stop attacking for a sec before you fd.

Hehe,<br/>\n&gt;when that fails, you just fd.  Works out great.  (You haven&#39;t had fun till<br/>\n&gt;you scout out a dungeon full of red mob&#39;s with another monk.  You and the<br/>\n&gt;other monk can sneak around, fd when needed, then find lower level mobs to<br/>\n&gt;wipe out before the red ones find you.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Someone else will have to answer about instill doubt.
