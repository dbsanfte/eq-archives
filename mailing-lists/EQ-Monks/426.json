Neither <br/>\nwas meant in such an context.  If the whole graphics change was in reference <br/>\nto new armors etc. My bad. I was only refering to having visible headbands <br/>\nand sashes, which is what I thought the general theme of the discussion was. <br/>\nI had agreed with the post in the sense that large scale changes werent <br/>\npossible. Though maybe I was uncclear. While I dont like that we dont have <br/>\nany armor changes I can see why this was implemented, monks on a whole arent <br/>\nthe most fashionable people nor do they change clothes twice a day. They are <br/>\nsimple people and as as such we are given simple clothes!<br/>\nI think some people on this board have had some great ideas for gloves and <br/>\nmonk modifiers, something the class sorely needs. But how do we go about <br/>\ntrying to get notice to these ideas? Was there a movement amongst the <br/>\nrangers to get crits or was that a developer idea? Is there a place to find <br/>\nwhat changes are being tried on the test server? Are the monks being tweaked <br/>\non the test server at all?<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. IMHO other classes wont complain if we get our sash/headband <br/>\nanimiations, everyone I have talked to also thinks its a severe oversight! <br/>\nNow if we got taunt, backflip, critical, nunchucks, and magic gloves other <br/>\nclasses might complain, a little ;)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
