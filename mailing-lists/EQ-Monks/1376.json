Depending on the server you play on he could be camped and so<br/>\nyou might want to bring a good NUKE along to ensure you earn the kill.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first thing to do is raise qeynos warrior guild faction.  Wiat let me take<br/>\nthat back... the first thing to do is go to www.gameznet.com and print out the<br/>\nwalk through for the quest.  You have to do a silly quest to kerra isle before<br/>\nyou can get the hero bracer quest, and you have to con amiable before you can<br/>\nget any quests at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nLastly one trick you wil want to know is *how do I make the mino hero spawn?*<br/>\nWell rumor has it that if you kill minos and skeleton by the skelie camp he will<br/>\nspawn in a matter of minutes (people have gotten 2 spawns an hour with this<br/>\nmethod). <br/>\n<br/>\nTake the shakle off the mino + faction with the warrior guild + complete the<br/>\nfirst &quot;runaway gladiator&quot; quest, and you will get one hero bracers 9ac, 10 str,<br/>\n5 poison, 5 disease.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck<br/>\n<br/>\n____________________Reply Separator____________________<br/>\nSubject:    [EQ-Monks] A Real Topic!<br/>\nAuthor: Worlord &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:worlord@...\">worlord@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate:       02/12/2000 12:10 PM<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Worlord &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:worlord@...\">worlord@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSince we have all decided that the Twinking debat is boring (and it is)<br/>\nI would like to ask a question that is actually worthwile.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am interested in starting the Hero Bracers quest.
