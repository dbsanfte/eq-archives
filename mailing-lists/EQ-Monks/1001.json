There is no way to escape a mob without<br/>\nzoning.  Mobs are faster than PC&#39;s.  Mobs can hit a PC from a greater<br/>\ndistance.  Mobs are more resistant to magic.  Mobs have more HP than the<br/>\naverage PC of the same level.  Mobs do more damage than the average PC of<br/>\nthe same level.  Mobs are impossible to capture when they are running away<br/>\n(Ever wonder why there are so many trains in some dungeons? Mobs run away<br/>\nand PC can&#39;t catch em, and the mob goes and gets 40 other mobs).  Mobs have<br/>\ntwice as much mana as a PC of their level.  Mobs have faster casting times.<br/>\nMOBS HAVE MORE FRIENDS.  It is much harder to resist a mob&#39;s spell.  If a<br/>\nmob is using a fast weapon that does less damage then the mobs fists, it<br/>\nuses the SPEED of the weapon and does the damage of it&#39;s fist.  If the<br/>\nweapon is slower than its fists but does more damage, it uses the speed of<br/>\nits fists and the damage of the weapon.  The list goes on!  IS THIS FAIR?<br/>\nIS THIS RIGHT?  WE CAN&#39;T EVEN RUN AWAY! HELL, MOBS ARE THE SUPERIOR RACE!<br/>\nWHY DOESN&#39;T VERANT HAVE AN &quot;Uprising of the MOBS&quot; where THEY SPAWN 50 VOX&#39;S<br/>\nIN EVERY CITY!  Why doesn&#39;t verant just BAN us ALL and play with the MOBS?<br/>\nHeck, they don&#39;t complain!<br/>\n<br/>\n   Im sick of this BS and thats why I&#39;m quitting.  Go ahead, flame me, do<br/>\nwhatever, I don&#39;t care.  I&#39;ve transcended this game that is supposed to be<br/>\n&quot;Fun&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n   Darkblade,<br/>\n   Moving to a game like Shadowbane ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sb.drtwister.com\">http://sb.drtwister.com</a> )  , where he<br/>\ncan CRUSH people instead of &quot;MOBS&quot; that are ridiculously more powerful than<br/>\nhimself.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
