We found it tough going at first mainly <br/>\nbecause everytime we hit (and we monks do that a lot) most of the creatures <br/>\nthere we were taking damage (darn shields).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe now spend most of our time in Najena and tend to group with others our <br/>\nlevel and up to maybe level 22.  We have the occassional bad situation but <br/>\nfor the most part we are able to control the first third of the area.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night was probably the worst.  I was escorting someone to the zone and <br/>\nit seemed like everything came at us.  We had 2 ogre guards, 4 earth <br/>\nelementals, 2 mist elementals, 1 fire elemental, probably 6 greater <br/>\nskeletons, a magician and her pet and to top it off a terror tentacle <br/>\nbeating on us.  We almost got them all.  Mental Note: Feign Death is less <br/>\nlikely to work when there are 5-6 mobs hitting/casting on you at the same <br/>\ntime.  This situation is pretty rare I have found.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you can bring along someone to &#39;cancel magic&#39; when there is a shield, or <br/>\nroot the runners/blast the runners both Lavastorm and Najena can be lots of <br/>\nfun.<br/>\n<br/>\nI digressed a bit.  Sorry.  Point is, we keep on coming back to Lavastorm <br/>\nand Najena.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Tom De Vries&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tdevries@...\">tdevries@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [EQ-Monks] Re: Some Thoughts (please read)<br/>\n&gt;Date: Fri, 29 Oct 1999 12:30:55 -0500<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I also am level 17...

Perhaps it is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; because I learn zones quickly and generally always<br/>\n&gt; &gt; know where I am.  Buy a greater lightstone, memorize<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the zone you are in, max out sense heading and always<br/>\n&gt; &gt; know which way to run.  Thats the best advice I can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; give.  I have a druid with infravision and it doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; seem to be much of an improvement (still can&#39;t see<br/>\n&gt; &gt; anything in Misty Thicket)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Just live with it<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Second... I am level 17, i&#39;ve been hunt in oasis for 3<br/>\n&gt; &gt; levels and I want to go somewhere else.  I was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; thinking of East Karana.
