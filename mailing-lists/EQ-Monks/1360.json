Good ta see ya round,<br/>\nyou&#39;ve been pretty quiet recently.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I&#39;m sorry, but what are you talking about?  Herrick is a level 12 monk talking<br/>\n&gt;about saving up scarab carapaces for 1.7gp each!  Do you think this guy has<br/>\n&gt;30pp to go buy a bracer of erolisi? or 100pp to get a silver-plated bracer?<br/>\n&gt;Please tell me what armor better than cured even a level 18 can go get?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m just a little tired of people who are twinked telling new players what <br/>\n&gt;they<br/>\n&gt;should be wearing:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&quot;oh, man, that cured hat sucks, go get a froglock crown&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;There is a lot better stuff that Harrick can get, but he definitely <br/>\n&gt;shouldn&#39;t worry<br/>\n&gt;about it now.  He has to get to 30 or so first.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Clarity Harvestmoon,<br/>\n&gt;Karana<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>People tend to get a bit excited about items.  If you have the plat or<br/>\nfriends then twink away.  Yes, it&#39;s kind of pathetic, but has anyone<br/>\nlooked at Oasis lately.  Twink-o-rama.  Get the gear yourself and<br/>\nyou&#39;ll like it more, buy or trade for it and you&#39;ll still be happy.<br/>\nJust find it strange that people think item collection is the be-all<br/>\nand end-all of the game.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Dude, don&#39;t bother paying 50pp for Wu&#39;s, especially if you only have<br/>\n&gt;11.  Wu&#39;s aren&#39;t that helpful.  If I were you I would go for a Lockjaw<br/>\n&gt;vest and maybe some jewelry.  Wait till later for wu&#39;s.  I held out and<br/>\n&gt;found a guy selling them at cost, 19pp.  My lucky day =)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Also, at least on Karana, there are many high level tailors who will<br/>\n&gt;make them for nothing if you find the ingrediants.  Just find a<br/>\n&gt;potter/enchanter for that vial of viscous mana, everything else is easy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hammeron<br/>\n&gt;Monk of Quellious<br/>\n&gt;Karana<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Open invitation to anyone on Karana:  If you get the components I&#39;ll<br/>\nenchant the vial for free.  Be warned my pottery skill is nonexistsent<br/>\nso you&#39;ll need to bring the components.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSparx Dreamreaver<br/>\nLevel 36, Karana<br/>\n- Resists&#39;R&#39;Us -</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
