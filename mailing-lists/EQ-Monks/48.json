I&#39;d just rather not get <br/>\nhit than hit a bit harder.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for how I distributed my stats at the beginning, I put 5 into DEX, 5 <br/>\ninto AGILITY, and (please don&#39;t laugh too hard, I didn&#39;t know any better) <br/>\n10 into INT.  Strangest part is that putting those 10 points into INT has <br/>\ncome in kinda handy for Dragon Punch, from what I hear about how hard it is <br/>\nto raise it&#39;s going up really fast.  I&#39;m mabye 3/4ths of a bubble into 26 <br/>\nand I&#39;ve got Dragon up to 71.  And I guess it also comes in handy for <br/>\nBrewing, hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nDorath Quickfist<br/>\nTarew Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom:\tJay Watamaniuk<br/>\nSent:\tWednesday, June 09, 1999 4:29 PM<br/>\nTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject:\t[EQ-Monks] Beginner questions<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Jay Watamaniuk &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wertou@...\">wertou@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI played a Monk up to level 8 and am now thinking that I messed up pretty<br/>\nbad on wasting experience on combat stuff when you really shouldn&#39;t bother. <br/>\nI have now decided to start a new Monk at Freeport (because, holy cow, is <br/>\nit<br/>\nlong and tedious to look for beasts around Karana.
