You could chat<br/>\nin e-mail or ICQ but you say you dont have the time. For your own brother?<br/>\nYet you go ingame and use it like a chat room, doing nothing but sending<br/>\nmessages back and forth. You can&#39;t tell me you are in Sol B fighting<br/>\nwhatever while you chat with him. I&#39;ve tried carrying on conversations while<br/>\nfighting and it doesn&#39;t work real well. So you sit in game and chat but you<br/>\nhave no time to sit out of game and chat. With your own family..... That<br/>\ndoesnt make EQ more than a game, just a game with a chat feature......<br/>\n<br/>\nCrysarra de&#39;Danann wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Crysarra de&#39;Danann &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lucretia_71@...\">lucretia_71@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hmm....well it may be just a game but you know...its more than JUST a<br/>\n&gt; game to some people.  It is the only way that I can keep in touch with<br/>\n&gt; my brother for instance...he is never at home and doesn&#39;t ever call me<br/>\n&gt; and I don&#39;t have long distance on my phone.  Somehow though, we seem to<br/>\n&gt; get together in the game and talk about things.  Before EQ we rarely<br/>\n&gt; talked..maybe twice a year?  tell me does that make EQ just a game?<br/>\n&gt; Its something that we can do together...which yeah its a game but then<br/>\n&gt; again its not JUST a game.  If those little bytes disappeared in<br/>\n&gt; California and we could no longer meet up in EQ then I seriously doubt<br/>\n&gt; we would talk very much anymore.  Yeah sure I have the ICQ and email of<br/>\n&gt; all the people that I play with and get close to.  But seriously how<br/>\n&gt; much is he going to be able to say to me in an email...tell me about<br/>\n&gt; all his daily activities everyday...I don&#39;t think so.   How often do<br/>\n&gt; you send an email back and forth with someone...chatting about stupid<br/>\n&gt; stuff?  I don&#39;t...I don&#39;t have time for that.  But when I sit down to<br/>\n&gt; play EQ we have a common goal and spend time working together to<br/>\n&gt; accomplish this, which makes us closer...  And I use my brother as an<br/>\n&gt; example, but through the game I have met some of the best friends I<br/>\n&gt; have ever had. Without EQ, I doubt we would have very much to do with<br/>\n&gt; each other at all, let alone that we would have ever met... Anyway...<br/>\n&gt; sorry you really touched a sensitive side of me.  If you think that EQ<br/>\n&gt; is just a game then you should try finding a nice solo game (yeah go<br/>\n&gt; dig out the dusty PSX and sit down for a few hours playing tomb raider)<br/>\n&gt; and compare it to EQ and see which one you prefer.  The solo game is<br/>\n&gt; JUST a game.  I think you will see the difference between JUST a game<br/>\n&gt; and EQ.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Leiah<br/>\n&gt; e&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- Dave Gaines &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dave@...\">dave@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It should not be more than a game.
