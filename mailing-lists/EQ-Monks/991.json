This <br/>\nmeans that even if you include a successful mend, warriors still have <br/>\nmore HP than a monk.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Warriors can therefore take far more hits than we can.  Our <br/>\ndodging ability makes up for this somewhat, but make no mistake - <br/>\nnobody in the game can absorb damage better than a warrior.<br/>\n<br/>\n2a) In conjunction with this, warriors can taunt (monks cannot), <br/>\nwhich means they can draw the attention of those damage dealing mobs <br/>\nto themselves (and away from those oh-so-delicate casters :) ).<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Given a warrior with equipment typical of their level (ie. no <br/>\ntwink stuff), they regularly out-damage monks up until level 30.  In <br/>\nfact, for much of that time, you&#39;ll find yourself being frustrated by <br/>\nthe damage being done by other melee and hybrid classes in comparison <br/>\nto yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\n3a) However, after level 30 - when we get Flying Kick - monks start <br/>\nto come into their own.  You&#39;ll start off doing up to the 50&#39;s and <br/>\nwork your way to just over 100 at level 50 (I still break into a grin <br/>\nwhenever I hit for triple digits).  From this point, monks rather <br/>\nrapidly catch up to and eventually pass warriors in the <br/>\ndamage-dealing department.  Remember though, that this is very much <br/>\nbased on what equipment the warrior can get his or her hands on. <br/>\nOnce they get their grubby mits on some of that Plane equipment, <br/>\nmithril swords, etc. the playing field will start to level again.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tDid that help at all?<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nAaron Braunstein<br/>\nPacific Data Management, Inc.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aaron_braunstein@...\">aaron_braunstein@...</a>&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
