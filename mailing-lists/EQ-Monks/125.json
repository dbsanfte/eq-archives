I make it a point when hunting in groups to<br/>\njust take the coin split. If you are worried about not getting decent coin,<br/>\nprobably 75% of the time, when someone in my group runs off to sell, they<br/>\ncome back and give me a little coin since I am not taking any loot. Last<br/>\nnight, for example, a party member looted a full set of bronze in our course<br/>\nof adventuring. He sold the entire set to a player, turned around and gave<br/>\nme 15 plat.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as weight affecting atk, I have never seen anything official, but I<br/>\ndo believe this happens. I think it also affects dex, but haven&#39;t had the<br/>\nchance to really look into it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would recommend definately getting netted or woven armor if you can afford<br/>\nit. Too bad I didn&#39;t see this earlier, as I just upgraded to full mesh and<br/>\ngave away my full set of woven to a younger Brother.<br/>\n<br/>\nPraelor<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\tBlizzard [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:blizzard15@...\">blizzard15@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tSunday, July 04, 1999 12:03 PM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Monk@onelist.com\">EQ_Monk@onelist.com</a>; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject:\t[EQ-Monks] Weight<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have heard many people say that weight affects my ac, then I have also<br/>\n&gt; heard many that say that weight affects my chance of hitting. I was just<br/>\n&gt; starting to get rid of my leather armor for light patchwork or maybe just<br/>\n&gt; spend all my money on netted when I saw a monk wearing leather. When I<br/>\n&gt; asked him he said that weight doesn&#39;t matter at all for monks. Now, I<br/>\n&gt; usually have more weight than 14 and I find myself missing more then my<br/>\n&gt; other less bulbous monk counterparts. So, what&#39;s the truth does weight<br/>\n&gt; matter for us? <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; I also was wondering, does ac and atk mean the damage we take and do, or<br/>\n&gt; the chance we have to get hit or hit.
