I fear that I&#39;ve been driving myself insane trying to<br/>\nkeep up with friends in my regular group (where they find the time to level<br/>\nthe way they do is beyond me &lt;g&gt;) and I&#39;m letting the joy of the game seep<br/>\nout (and I play on the Test Server so it&#39;s sometimes very difficult to find<br/>\na group). I&#39;d like information on some places where I could possibly keep up<br/>\nmy development at my own pace. Alas, I realize EQ is meant to be a group<br/>\ngame, and I will group when I&#39;m able, but rather than quit playing entirely,<br/>\nI&#39;ll have to spend some solo time.  Any input would be greatly appreciated!<br/>\n<br/>\nOwyn Abhaya, Ashen Order<br/>\nTest Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
