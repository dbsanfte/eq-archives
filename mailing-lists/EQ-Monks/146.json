In Oasis for<br/>\ninstance, once a giant targets me, he will come back to me from what<br/>\nseems like any distance the moment I stand up from feign.  What im not<br/>\nsure about is if they do the same thing after they have started<br/>\nattacking someone else while i&#39;m on the ground.  In a zone like Guk, a<br/>\nfeign seems to instantly and permanently remove me from the monsters&#39;<br/>\nminds, with the possible exception being when they are still battling<br/>\nmembers of my group.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs an interesting side-note to using feign in Guk in particular, and I&#39;m<br/>\nguessing other indoor zones, I can use feign to run through the zone for<br/>\nthe most part with impunity.  The best guess i can make is that the<br/>\nmonsters do a radius check around themselves every 10 seconds or so to<br/>\nlook for trespassers.  As I&#39;m running through the level (usually headed<br/>\nfor a corpse or zone), I move past most monsters between their radius<br/>\nchecks and they do not attack.  On the occasions that they do attack<br/>\n(maybe 1 in 5 frogs) I immediately feign death, stand up, and keep<br/>\nrunning.  By the time they do another radius check, I&#39;m long gone.  The<br/>\none thing that makes it complicated at times is the issue of<br/>\nspellcasters that has been discussed here.  If I notice a frog has begun<br/>\ncasting a spell, instead of immediately feigning to lose any other<br/>\npursuing frogs, I keep running.  After the spell hits me, i feign,<br/>\nstand, and run again.  The frogs all return to their guard posts or<br/>\npatrol routes while I run past the next groups.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, hope the technique can be used by others if needed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\tRobb Flynn [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:RobF@...\">RobF@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tTuesday, July 13, 1999 1:37 PM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject:\tRE: [EQ-Monks] Feign Death vs. casters and anomolous<br/>\n&gt; failures<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Robb Flynn &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:RobF@...\">RobF@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; unfortunately, yes, this is supposed to happen.

The funniest was running<br/>\n&gt; from a<br/>\n&gt; brigand in the Karanas (West I think it was). I FD (was on a corpse<br/>\n&gt; retreival run and in no mood to fight this thing), wait, run, FD,<br/>\n&gt; wait,<br/>\n&gt; run... repeat all the way to North Karanas Zone.
