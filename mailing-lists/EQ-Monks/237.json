I received a /tell<br/>\nyesterday from a concerned party on Erollisi Marr<br/>\nasking the name of the greedy monk I spoke of<br/>\nyesterday. I do not feel it is right to post his name<br/>\non the lits but if you are on Erollisi Marr and wish<br/>\nto know his name, email me and I will tell you. I do<br/>\nnot wish people to bother him, that is why I didn&#39;t<br/>\npost his name. HE does have the right to be a jerk<br/>\neven if i do not like it. So please ask only if you<br/>\nwish to know his name in case you are ever in party<br/>\nwith him or have the chance to be. Please do not<br/>\nharass him. I do not wish him ill, but I do understand<br/>\nwhy people would want to know so that they would not<br/>\nhave the misfortune of having an evening spoiled by<br/>\nhis greed and poor sportsmanship.<br/>\n<br/>\nMay truth guide you,<br/>\nBrother Kingdok<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nBid and sell for free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://auctions.yahoo.com\">http://auctions.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
