A moment later,<br/>\na Hag came around the corner and cast on our paladin. I FD successfully and<br/>\neveryone else runs, with the Hag in pursuit. The MoB I was fighting however,<br/>\nthe non-casting mummy that had given me the rabies, continued to beat on me.<br/>\nI stood up, just me and the Mummy now, FD successfully again, and end up<br/>\ngetting killed by the mummy. My question is twofold... 1) Is rabies<br/>\nconsidered a DoT? I know it says &quot;You resist the weak disease spell&quot; or<br/>\nsomething similar, but actually thought that was a bug since the mummy does<br/>\nnot cast any spells. 2) If we a re hit by a DoT, does that nullify the use<br/>\nof FD? I ask this because since a previous spell is affecting us, does the<br/>\ncast then know that we are not dead?<br/>\n<br/>\nThoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\nPraelor<br/>\n<br/>\nbtw... I contacted a guide about this and was told &quot;Sometimes monsters just<br/>\naren&#39;t fooled by feign death, even if you are successful&quot;.  Excuse me, but<br/>\nif they aren&#39;t fooled, exactly HOW are we successful??<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\tAaron Braunstein [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aaron_spam@...\">aaron_spam@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tTuesday, July 13, 1999 12:23 PM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq-monks@onelist.com\">eq-monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject:\t[EQ-Monks] Feign Death vs. casters and anomolous failures<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Aaron Braunstein &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aaron_spam@...\">aaron_spam@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tI posted this on another list, but wanted to share it with this one<br/>\n&gt; as well to see if anybody might be able to help solve the mystery of why<br/>\n&gt; FD<br/>\n&gt; fails without a message sometimes.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; At 9:23 AM +0200 7/13/99, Brian Peter Thorsbro wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;When faced with a caster you should turn off autoattack and wait for the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;spell to hit you. Then feign before the caster starts a new spell. That<br/>\n&gt; is<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the way to trick a caster with feign death.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tInteresting suggestion, and it would seem to jive with some of my<br/>\n&gt; own experiences with FD lately.  I&#39;ve been racking my brains trying to<br/>\n&gt; figure out why it is that FD fails to stop an aggressor&#39;s attacks even<br/>\n&gt; when<br/>\n&gt; no &quot;xxx has fallen to the ground&quot; message.  Clearly, it has failed but we<br/>\n&gt; have no indication of this other than the fact that we&#39;re still getting<br/>\n&gt; pounded.  Some of my thoughts on the subject are these, any modifications<br/>\n&gt; to this list would be well appreciated:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1 - Feigning when mobs are frenzied on you has a dramatically higher rate<br/>\n&gt; of failure than against non-frenzied mobs.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 2 - Feigning &#39;mid-attack&#39; seems to fail more frequently.  Perhaps it goes<br/>\n&gt; something like this:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; a) Mob starts his swing<br/>\n&gt; b) Feign performed (no message of failure)<br/>\n&gt; c) I stob being the mob&#39;s current target<br/>\n&gt; d) Blow lands, re-instating me as the current target<br/>\n&gt; e) Mob keeps pounding on current target (me).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tI don&#39;t know if this is really what happens or not, but it would<br/>\n&gt; fit with the previous poster&#39;s &#39;wait until the caster has done his thing&#39;<br/>\n&gt; suggestion.  Also, have you noticed that after you kill a mob, you still<br/>\n&gt; sometimes take a swing and occasionally see a damage message AFTER the<br/>\n&gt; thing has died?  Perhaps this is an artifact of the above sequence.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 3 - Still not sure whether or not stopping your attack before feigning<br/>\n&gt; affects things except perhaps exacerbating the situation outlined in #2.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tWell?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Aaron Braunstein<br/>\n&gt; Pacific Data Management, Inc.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aaron_braunstein@...\">aaron_braunstein@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  your connection to like-minds and kindred spirits.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
