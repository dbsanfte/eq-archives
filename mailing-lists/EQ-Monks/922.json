Perhaps it is<br/>\n&gt; because I learn zones quickly and generally always<br/>\n&gt; know where I am.  Buy a greater lightstone, memorize<br/>\n&gt; the zone you are in, max out sense heading and always<br/>\n&gt; know which way to run.  Thats the best advice I can<br/>\n&gt; give.  I have a druid with infravision and it doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; seem to be much of an improvement (still can&#39;t see<br/>\n&gt; anything in Misty Thicket)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Just live with it<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Second... I am level 17, i&#39;ve been hunt in oasis for 3<br/>\n&gt; levels and I want to go somewhere else.  I was<br/>\n&gt; thinking of East Karana.  Any recommendations as to<br/>\n&gt; where I should hunt and what I should fight<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hammeron<br/>\n&gt; 17th Circle<br/>\n&gt; Monk of Quellious<br/>\n&gt; Karana<br/>\n&gt; &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
