It is the only way that I can keep in touch with<br/>\nmy brother for instance...he is never at home and doesn&#39;t ever call me<br/>\nand I don&#39;t have long distance on my phone.  Somehow though, we seem to<br/>\nget together in the game and talk about things.  Before EQ we rarely<br/>\ntalked..maybe twice a year?  tell me does that make EQ just a game? <br/>\nIts something that we can do together...which yeah its a game but then<br/>\nagain its not JUST a game.  If those little bytes disappeared in<br/>\nCalifornia and we could no longer meet up in EQ then I seriously doubt<br/>\nwe would talk very much anymore.  Yeah sure I have the ICQ and email of<br/>\nall the people that I play with and get close to.  But seriously how<br/>\nmuch is he going to be able to say to me in an email...tell me about<br/>\nall his daily activities everyday...I don&#39;t think so.   How often do<br/>\nyou send an email back and forth with someone...chatting about stupid<br/>\nstuff?  I don&#39;t...I don&#39;t have time for that.  But when I sit down to<br/>\nplay EQ we have a common goal and spend time working together to<br/>\naccomplish this, which makes us closer...  And I use my brother as an<br/>\nexample, but through the game I have met some of the best friends I<br/>\nhave ever had. Without EQ, I doubt we would have very much to do with<br/>\neach other at all, let alone that we would have ever met... Anyway...<br/>\nsorry you really touched a sensitive side of me.  If you think that EQ<br/>\nis just a game then you should try finding a nice solo game (yeah go<br/>\ndig out the dusty PSX and sit down for a few hours playing tomb raider)<br/>\nand compare it to EQ and see which one you prefer.  The solo game is<br/>\nJUST a game.  I think you will see the difference between JUST a game<br/>\nand EQ.<br/>\n<br/>\nLeiah<br/>\ne&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Dave Gaines &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dave@...\">dave@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It should not be more than a game.
