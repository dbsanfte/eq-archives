Certain critters drop it in<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;finished state.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Second, there is a rather plentiful supply of mesh/woven/netted fairly<br/>\nnear<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Freeport, but you have to travel through a fairly dangerous desert to get<br/>\n&gt; &gt;there.  If you can find a guide through North Ro, Oasis, and South Ro,<br/>\nyou<br/>\n&gt; &gt;can get to the swamp where the froglocks roam.   These are the creatures<br/>\n&gt; &gt;that drop netted and rarely some woven armor.  If you can find a decent<br/>\n&gt; spot<br/>\n&gt; &gt;them, you can amass a good amount of netted in a short time.   Woven and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Mesh armor, while better, is found on higher level frogloks in the<br/>\ndungeon<br/>\n&gt; &gt;of Guk, which is off of that swamp.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Thirdly, the Qeynos sewers do have frogloks in them, but getting to<br/>\nQeynos<br/>\n&gt; &gt;from Freeport is pretty dangerous at your level (hey, no risk no reward,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;right?).   If you have a good guide (preferably a druid), you should be<br/>\n&gt; able<br/>\n&gt; &gt;to make it, but it&#39;s a very long journey.   However, there are only 3,<br/>\n&gt; count<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&#39;em, 3 froglocks in the sewers.  They are often camped by low level monks<br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Qeynos, but just keep checking back until they are free.   Again, you&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; &gt;probably need a guide to show you exactly where in the sewers to hunt the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;froggies.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;The choice?   Getting to Qeynos is probably harder than getting to the<br/>\narea<br/>\n&gt; &gt;around Guk, BUT once you get to Qeynos it&#39;s considerably safer hunting<br/>\nfor<br/>\n&gt; &gt;netted.  The sewers are a low level dungeon and not much will come after<br/>\n&gt; &gt;you.   However, there the swamp has far more frogloks to kill so the<br/>\nnetted<br/>\n&gt; &gt;should come faster.   It&#39;s all about personal preference at that point.<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; &gt;personally would head to the swamp to hunt there, but some people like to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;hunt near their bind points (you can be bound right outside the sewers,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;whereas the swamp is four zones away from a city).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Of course, you can get this info from higher level monks on your server.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I&#39;ve found monks to be pretty open to helping each other out.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Dornn, Level 16 monk on Brell Serilis<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Xurlus@...\">Xurlus@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Hail Brother&#39;s & Sisters,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Also, I am a Freeport monk, I hear much talk about the sewers of &gt;Qeynos<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;(think that is the place) But nothing of were to hunt for the &gt;creatures<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;am looking for in my area.
