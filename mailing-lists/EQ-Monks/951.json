I succesfully feigned<br/>\nthem<br/>\n&gt; at this point. they returned to thier spawn points . I stood up they<br/>\nimmediatly<br/>\n&gt; came back.  so I feign again they return to thier points I get up and run<br/>\nall<br/>\n&gt; the way to the small bridge type thing near the sol b spawn point.
