Granted<br/>\nmaybe the warrior class is not really any better than the paladin class in<br/>\nmelee (and it is, IMHO), but why should warriors get another big boost over<br/>\nthe already humbled monk?  Despite the fact that we get feign death<br/>\neventually, our armor class and atttack does not usually equal that of a<br/>\nwarrior, which is alright now, but if they get another boost, where is this<br/>\ngoing to leave the monk.  I for one am against the warrior update, unless<br/>\nthe make a minimal change to the monk class.  I&#39;m not asking for much, I&#39;m<br/>\njust asking for something that by making the warrior &quot;king of melee&quot; that<br/>\nthey just not leave the monks in the dust.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Maerjyon, 11th Rank monk, E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
