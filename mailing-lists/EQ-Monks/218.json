I get to Paw and find the room. I attack the commander out in front of the shaman&#39;s room and guess who comes charging out after me? None other than Phido himself. I switch focus to him and start pounding him, all the while the commander&#39;s taking free shots at me. I finally manage to kill Phido, but have a bubble of health left. I feign, wait a minute, loot Phido, collect Dareb&#39;s skull. bind my wounds, mend, and high tail it to Qeynos. Yes, there will be better headgear, but I&#39;m kinda proud of my red headband &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOwyn<br/>\nTest Server<br/>\n    -----Original Message-----<br/>\n    From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ScottM@...\">ScottM@...</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ScottM@...\">ScottM@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n    To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n    Date: Wednesday, August 18, 1999 7:32 AM<br/>\n    Subject: RE: [EQ-Monks] Red Headband Quest<br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n    Well after many hours in Paw, I have done this quest.  You just have to keep killing Ren&#39;Rexx eventually phido does spawn.... The other two heads come from Ghanex Drah who is a normal spawn, and the third comes from killing High Shaman Grisok who is a random spawn for Shaman Lenrel...<br/>\n<br/>\n    I got Ghanex Drah&#39;s head easily, it took around 7 hours (non-consecitvly) of fighting till I got the other two heads, as a coincidence both Grisok and Phido spawned at the same time (was killing all three in a circle)<br/>\n<br/>\n    Wade <br/>\n    Solusek Ro <br/>\n<br/>\n    -----Original Message----- <br/>\n    From: Dave Woomer [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dwoomer@...\">dwoomer@...</a>] <br/>\n    Sent: Wednesday, August 18, 1999 5:34 AM <br/>\n    To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a> <br/>\n    Subject: [EQ-Monks] Red Headband Quest <br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n    From: &quot;Dave Woomer&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dwoomer@...\">dwoomer@...</a>&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n    Hello, brothers and sisters... <br/>\n<br/>\n    Just spent a long, frustrating night in Paw trying to get the head of Dareb. <br/>\n    I&#39;ve heard you get this item from High Shaman Phido, who is a rare spawn, <br/>\n    who shows up in place of Shaman Ren&#39;Rexx on occasion. Well, I killed Ren&#39;Rex <br/>\n    so many times I started feeling sorry for him &lt;g&gt;.  Does anyone know who to <br/>\n    get the head of Dareb? After questing for the headband items for weeks, I <br/>\n    don&#39;t feel bad about a spoiler at this point &lt;g&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n    Thanks! <br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n    --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ---------------------------- <br/>\n<br/>\n    ONElist:  your connection to people who share your interests. <br/>\n<br/>\n    ------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
