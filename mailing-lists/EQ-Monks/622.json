That would solve a lot of those<br/>\n&gt;problems, but in my real opinion, I just really love this game, it may be<br/>\n&gt;because I am still so new, haven&#39;t even got past my first month and my 19th<br/>\n&gt;(almost 20th Level) Monk is my pride and joy. I really enjoy when people<br/>\n&gt;look at my gear and say nice spread, I worked damn hard for my stuff and it<br/>\n&gt;is my own personnel satisfaction I get from my character. If I see someone<br/>\n&gt;else who is twinked, I think that&#39;s good for them, I hope they enjoy that<br/>\n&gt;because I know they will enjoyment of the game for they have nothing to look<br/>\n&gt;forward too, so those people won&#39;t be around too much longer.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why do they have nothing to look forward to?  Maybe they are second characters<br/>\ntrying to get to where his friends are so they can group together.  Maybe<br/>\nthey are<br/>\ntrying to get to places they haven&#39;t seen yet because they would die almost<br/>\ninstantly.
