I favored AGI improvements as they also contributed<br/>\nto improvements in AC. But I will say that AC and STR can both be increased<br/>\nwith little trouble. I do not think I would change the allocation of my start<br/>\npoints which I largely divided between STR and AGI; I might have put more into<br/>\nSTR than I did. Basically, the distribution of your starting points will have<br/>\nless to do with your success than the acquisition of items and the training of<br/>\nyour skills later on. Any real changes in ATK value and AC from STR and AGI,<br/>\nrespectively doesn&#39;t occur until each five point increment, so keep that in<br/>\nmind when arming yourself and distributing points. My preference, as of late,<br/>\nhowever has been to add AC every chance I get. I have substituted a Serpentine<br/>\nBracer with a Bracer of Erolissi, and have added a pair of Jagged Bands. What<br/>\nyou may notice is that often when adding AC with certain items you will<br/>\nenhance<br/>\nSTR along with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Quellious&#39;s name,<br/>\n<br/>\nManjushri<br/>\nBearer of the Red Sash of the Ashen Order<br/>\n(Fennin Ro?)<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 11:30 PM 1/31/00 -0700, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;James&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wsjames@...\">wsjames@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So, folks, we all recently heard *with disappointment* about verant<br/>\n&gt;employees posting about DEX and AGI - they seem to be a lot less important<br/>\n&gt;than we hoped for.  In light of this new information - what do all you monks<br/>\n&gt;out there see as the most important stats for a monk, now? How would you<br/>\n&gt;focus your items (ie STR? AC? HPS? AGI? DEX? STA?)? And how would you<br/>\n&gt;distribute your starting points?  Maybe a few could name some equipment that<br/>\n&gt;backs up their opinions.<br/>\n&gt;Thanks in advance for everyone&#39;s input =)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Kyeric<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;FREE ADVICE FROM REAL PEOPLE!
