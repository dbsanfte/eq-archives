How to make","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1983723385\">Silk Armor Guide<br/>\n<br/>\nHow to make swatches:<br/>\n<br/>\nTake two spider silks (not spiderling) and place them<br/>\nin your sewing kit.  Hit combine.  You have a swatch.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow to make armor:<br/>\nUse swatches just like they are pelts.  Place a swatch<br/>\nwith a cap patterm, hit combine, voila, raw silk cap. <br/>\n(Note: For Tunic and Pants you need 2 swatches, when<br/>\nyou place them in your kit them can not be stacked. <br/>\nTherefore if you want to make tunics or pants you need<br/>\na large sewing kit)<br/>\n<br/>\nSelling Price:<br/>\nI sell all the 1 swatch pieces for 2pp, the leggings<br/>\nfor 3pp and the tunic for 4pp.  You have a limited<br/>\nammount of people who will buy it but if you can sell<br/>\nit, you make a good ammount of money.  (I have seen<br/>\nprices higher than this, someone sold a tunic for 6pp<br/>\nwhich I thought was a little high)<br/>\n<br/>\nExample, Raw Silk Cap:<br/>\nItem                        Cost<br/>\n2 spider silks              2 for 3gp (thats what I   <br/>\n                         pay) or free of giant        <br/>\n                    spiders<br/>\ncap pattern                 5 silver 6 copper (at 75  <br/>\n                            chr)<br/>\ntotal                       3gp 5 silver 6 copper (can<br/>\n                            be more or less)<br/>\nsells to vendor             3 gp 6 silver (on average,<br/>\n                            can be + or - 2 silver)<br/>\nsells to other player       2 pp<br/>\n<br/>\nThats a decent profit if you can sell it to another<br/>\nplayer, and practically no profit if you sell it to<br/>\nvendor.  Thats all I know about silk, it is still<br/>\nunknown how to make whips.<br/>\n<br/>\nSkill Level<br/>\n<br/>\nswatches were trivial for me at when I started at 20,<br/>\nprobably go trivial at 16 tho.  I hear that actually<br/>\narmor doesn&#39;t go trivial till arround 30-35<br/>\n<br/>\nhope that helps<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n- Worlord<br/>\n<br/>\nHammeron<br/>\n13th Circle Monk<br/>\nKarana<br/>\n===<br/>\n- Worlord<br/>\nNews Reporter<br/>\nStarCraft Gurus<br/>\nstacraft.gamegurus.net<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nBid and sell for free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://auctions.yahoo.com\">http://auctions.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
