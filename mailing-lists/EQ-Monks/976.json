Once you get past the 20s you<br/>\n&gt;will find ver very few places you can solo, however.  By that time,<br/>\n&gt;a mob that cons low blue will take out the best equipped monk<br/>\n&gt;without much of a sweat.  You will also start seeing warriors or<br/>\n&gt;other melee types wielding weapons that easily make them better<br/>\n&gt;damagers than you. Rangers with dual ykeshas in their low 30s<br/>\n&gt;are not uncommon and those weapons essentially do the same<br/>\n&gt;damage as a 44th level monk.  Also at 30th level warriros get a<br/>\n&gt;huge HP bonus.  You will see their ability to tank go up dramatically<br/>\n&gt;where as we can barely take hits from higher level mobs.  But what<br/>\n&gt;set us apart was feign death.  With that skill I feared no zone.  I<br/>\n&gt;could go anywhere as I had a nice safety net.  Now that safety net<br/>\n&gt;is gone.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thanks for raining on my parade.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou have attained a level of experience that I may not obtain for months.<br/>\nPlease understand that this is based on my limited experience and opinion.<br/>\nPrehaps those of us who haven&#39;t played under the old feign death, will find<br/>\nother means to deal with the problems you listed.  No disrespect meant to<br/>\nyou or any of the others, but it sounds like feign death was a crutch.<br/>\nMaybe at higher levels we need to learn to adjust our tactics and stop<br/>\nmeeting problems head on.  We should be thinking fighters.  Let the wariors<br/>\nwade in and trade blows with the big bad guy.  Let the warriors take the<br/>\nrole of the tank, while we take the role of the Smart bomb.  We zero in on<br/>\na target and take them out clean and fast.  I agree that warrior based<br/>\nclasses and their weapons can do more damge than we can, per hit, but I<br/>\nstill think we hit more often.  They are also too dependent upon those<br/>\nweapons for their abilites.  Everything we have is innate.  Let Verant<br/>\nthrow in a zone or two that magic doesn&#39;t work and see who is really the<br/>\ntrue meele (sp?) master. Strip a warrior of his weapons and armor and you<br/>\nhave a target .  Strip us, and we are still deadly.  I think we just have<br/>\nto adjust our purpose in the Verant universe<br/>\n<br/>\nShando  15th circle, Silent Fist Clan<br/>\nBertoxxolous</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
