Silent Fist monks are agnostic. The Ashen<br/>\nOrder guildmasters don&#39;t care much for agnostics but<br/>\nthe Silent Fist monks like Ashen Order monks merely<br/>\nbecause they are monks, they do not care who you<br/>\nworship. Hence the problem. I hail from Freeport and<br/>\nwhen I traveled west I was able to do the headband<br/>\nquests before I had killed a single gnoll. Many have<br/>\nsaid that killing orcs will raise faction with the<br/>\nAshen Order; I do not know if that is true but they<br/>\nliked me to begin with. I am always willing to help<br/>\nour Qeynos brothers in any way that I can so I will<br/>\nturn in sash items for sashes if anyone asks.<br/>\nI would say that becoming a better monk (i.e. getting<br/>\nhigher level headbands SHOULD raise faction with the<br/>\nAshen Order if it does not) I can only encourage more<br/>\nresearch and for us all to be aware of what things<br/>\nraise faction with which guild.<br/>\nGood journeys and may Truth guide you,<br/>\nBrother Kingdok<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nBid and sell for free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://auctions.yahoo.com\">http://auctions.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
