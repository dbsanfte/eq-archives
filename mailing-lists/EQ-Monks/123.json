Would you recommend i<br/>\n&gt; spend them on offensive skills now, save them for later, use them on a<br/>\n&gt; skill to make money, or use them on throwing. If on throwing is it a<br/>\n&gt; really good skill to get, does it do any damage or is it just to attract<br/>\n&gt; animals as ive heard.
