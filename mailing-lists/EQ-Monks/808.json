But let&#39;s be honest, <br/>\n&gt; there&#39;s nothing particularly difficult about those <br/>\n&gt; zones and pulling there. (Except MM which is a <br/>\n&gt; rather poorly designed zone IMO.)  And a monk is <br/>\n&gt; dang near as good with FD pulling as the druid/ranger<br/>\n&gt; there.  So we have what 3ish dungeons where a monk <br/>\n&gt; isn&#39;t the best puller, by a very small amount?  <br/>\n&gt; And let see: Perma, sol a, sol b, upper guk, lower <br/>\n&gt; guk where druid/ranger can&#39;t pull for squat?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yes monk&#39;s are the best pullers bar none.  Ask any <br/>\n&gt; group of 35+s whether they want a monk pulling in <br/>\n&gt; sol b or lower guk or anyone else? :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -David<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; =====<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
