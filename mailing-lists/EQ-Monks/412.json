Im a little tired of reading <br/>\nthese posts that the headband animation or sash cant be added because the <br/>\n&quot;2mb buffer over flow tri linera mip mapped anti aliased Voodoo 1 yad yada <br/>\nyada&quot; machines will slow down and cant handle it. If you believe that then <br/>\ncall me quick cause I got a whole lot of pure grade a sunshine in a bottle <br/>\nto sell ya. THINK! We are not asking for entirely new animations of dragons <br/>\nor flying vehicles or backflips out of dangeers way. All we are asking for <br/>\nis a nice yellow, blue, ornage, red, pink, muave, sandle whatever colored <br/>\nstrip on my head! For christ sakes barbarians get 19 different helmets with <br/>\nall sorts of funky horns and yet if you put a simple colored stripe on my <br/>\nhead or waist the graphics engine cant handle it and the game will come to a <br/>\nscreaching halt? Please stop the non sense! I have a feeling the developers <br/>\nare being misquoted here on this thread and their comments are in reference <br/>\nto other much larger issues within the game and not a simple stripe on a <br/>\nhead.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
