I<br/>\nmean we are sentenced to hunt down gnoll after gnoll with the Qeynos quests,<br/>\nyet those gnolls are the worst creatures I have ever encountered with<br/>\nregard to<br/>\nfleeing the battle! Even though most of the critters conned blue to me, they<br/>\nwould split with a third of their life left while their evil twin skippy was<br/>\ndoing the bash and stun on my behind to prevent the kill chase. By the time<br/>\nthe<br/>\nsecond gnoll was down, the first returned with his big brothers! Needless to<br/>\nsay, death was a common function of my monk through levels 8 to 10 while<br/>\ncompleting the orange headband quest. I do not even want to try the quest for<br/>\nthe red headband since it is in another burrow filled with gnolls. A nice pair<br/>\nof gloves that could proc root would definitely ameliorate that situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for new monk animations/graphics, I am all for that. Why can we not see the<br/>\nmesh tunic in blue on our person? Or even different jewels that we may be<br/>\nwearing. There is very little differentiation between one monk and another no<br/>\nmatter what the level. A level three in patchwork is just as styling as I<br/>\nam in<br/>\na mesh tunic (and little else :). It seems that more could be done.  Also, a<br/>\nlittle variety in attacks would be nice or some spiffy fireworks on contact<br/>\nfor<br/>\nour &quot;magical&quot; special attacks.<br/>\n<br/>\nReally, I am just dreaming of things to comlain about... I have been greatly<br/>\nsatisfied with playing a monk. I think I can solo well, and I am always<br/>\nwelcome<br/>\nin groups. I spend too much time wandering Norrath and trading languages, so I<br/>\nmay never break into the teens in level, but I am enjoying myself. <br/>\n<br/>\nGood fortunes to you,<br/>\n<br/>\nManjushri<br/>\nMonk of the 10th Order of Quellious, the Tranquil<br/>\n(Fennin Ro)<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 03:21 PM 8/27/99 -0700, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Tim Perkins&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tperkins@...\">tperkins@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I think it would be cool if we could just get a graphic like the claws from<br/>\n&gt;the AoF for the werewolf gloves.
