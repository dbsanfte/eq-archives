Now, on to your points:<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat you say about the social evolution of games is true, but I&#39;ll wager<br/>\nmost of the  EQ players about today didn&#39;t grow up with bridge night with<br/>\nthe Jones&#39; from next door.  For them, this is largely a new phenomena.<br/>\n<br/>\nNor, do I recall that anyone has once stated that their existing friends<br/>\ndeny them groups and interactions.  So, discard that paragraph.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe biggest voices haven&#39;t complained about not being instantly* accepted<br/>\ninto groups, but rather not being excepted into groups at all in situations<br/>\nwhere their friends aren&#39;t available.  Discard that paragraph.<br/>\n<br/>\nFunny thing about social interactions...they vary from environment to<br/>\nenvironment, from situation to situation.  Just because you aren&#39;t<br/>\nexperiencing what these guys are, doesn&#39;t mean they aren&#39;t, nor does it<br/>\ninvalidate their claims.  Discard that paragraph.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you get upset in traffic, then I suggest you stop driving.  If you get<br/>\nupset at work, then quit your job.  Why do people keep throwing this silly<br/>\nargument out?  When the rules change, and this change negatively impacts a<br/>\nperson, that person is going to complain.  Their particular situation may<br/>\nallow them to find a way around it, as I and others have.  They may accept<br/>\nthat that aspect of their being is gone and try to move beyond it and<br/>\ncontinue to enjoy themselves with what remains as some have.  They may give<br/>\nup and pursue another course as still others have.  They are upset that they<br/>\nhad found an ideal venue to exercise their social needs as well as play a<br/>\nfun, fantasy-based RPG.  The rules have been altered in such a way as to<br/>\nnegatively impact that.  To say that they should go to a chatroom is just<br/>\nplain silly.<br/>\n<br/>\nLook, if you want to help, stop further insulting them and making them feel<br/>\nworse.  Instead, do this:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Come up with examples and arguments demonstrating that they can still do<br/>\neverything they used to, or alternately propose new ways in which they can<br/>\nexplore and express.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Present those ideas and examples.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Then go on your merry way, as all the counter-complaining you can do<br/>\nwon&#39;t help or ameliorate the situation.  Let them vent.  Once they cool off,<br/>\nthey may or may not take your suggestions to heart.  They may or may not<br/>\ncome up solutions that are acceptable to them.  Either way, arguing and<br/>\ncomplaining on your part (or Stone&#39;s, etc.) is not going to make Chuy, etc,<br/>\nfeel any better or positively affect their situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nLei<br/>\nWarrior-Poet<br/>\nBristlebane <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Dave Gaines [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dave@...\">dave@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, December 16, 1999 9:53 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EQ-Monks] Digest Number 122<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Dave Gaines &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dave@...\">dave@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Wow.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well, before the dawn of computer about 20 years ago, <br/>\n&gt; practically every<br/>\n&gt; game out there invovled social contact.  A few exceptions like<br/>\n&gt; &quot;solitaire&quot;...  Computers came along and let us play games<br/>\n&gt; completely by ourselves.  But we for the most part find most of these<br/>\n&gt; games not nearly as fun as games with other people..  Thus games<br/>\n&gt; like DOOM and Warcraft II and Diablo, now UO and EQ and AC let us<br/>\n&gt; again have social contact.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If your friends suddenly do not allow you into your group <br/>\n&gt; because you are<br/>\n&gt; not quite as powerful as before, then maybe you should look<br/>\n&gt; at that friendship and see if thats what it is.  Not too many<br/>\n&gt; of the people I call friends online give a hoot about my game power.<br/>\n&gt; Just like I always invite Joe, the worlds worst golf player to go<br/>\n&gt; with us to play golf, real friends shouldn&#39;t care if you walked up<br/>\n&gt; and said flying kick was removed, you should still be immediately<br/>\n&gt; grouped.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Now the monk isn&#39;t suddenly instantly accepted into the group.  Well<br/>\n&gt; guess what, neither are bards (pre level 32).  Neither are wizards <br/>\n&gt; (unless you&#39;re going to hate), neither are warriors, neither are ...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From the way you talk, monks are social rejects now because <br/>\n&gt; feign death<br/>\n&gt; isn&#39;t as powerful, and that just isn&#39;t so.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yes it is more difficult, as you are not as useful, but every class<br/>\n&gt; has their power tuned (nerfed or enhanced) occasionally, and if you<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t cpe with these kinds of changes, then I suggest you stop<br/>\n&gt; playing EQ and join chat rooms to meet friends.  Verant can&#39;t put your<br/>\n&gt; ability to make friends easily above the need to balance the game.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Goode, Jason&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JGoode@...\">JGoode@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hrmmm...no, if you give it more of a bit of intropection, <br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s not really<br/>\n&gt; &gt; true.  It&#39;s a different type of game than say, Heroes of <br/>\n&gt; Might and Magic,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; where this statement would be valid.  This type of game has <br/>\n&gt; a twist to it -<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the human social element.  That, I think, more than <br/>\n&gt; anything else is what<br/>\n&gt; &gt; elevates it beyond a game to many.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Humans are social creatures as a species.  We, as a <br/>\n&gt; species, have a deep and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; abiding need to interact with others.  In this way is how <br/>\n&gt; it (and any<br/>\n&gt; &gt; MMORPG) transcends being &quot;just a game&quot;.  It doesn&#39;t have <br/>\n&gt; anything to do with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the code or the virtual mobs that you virtually slay, but <br/>\n&gt; rather the people<br/>\n&gt; &gt; beyond the icons with whom you will tend to build real <br/>\n&gt; relationships - often<br/>\n&gt; &gt; without realizing it.  Whether it&#39;s with your drinking <br/>\n&gt; buddies in a bar<br/>\n&gt; &gt; watching the game, going out dancing with your girlfriends, <br/>\n&gt; or sitting in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the king room in Sol B, killing kobold and <br/>\n&gt; role-playing/BSing about your job<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in the down time, makes no difference.  Social interaction <br/>\n&gt; is still social<br/>\n&gt; &gt; interaction, regardless of the arena it takes place in.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; If I had to speculate, I&#39;d say that the changes to feign <br/>\n&gt; death, or perhaps<br/>\n&gt; &gt; more accurately now, non-monks perceptions of monks due to <br/>\n&gt; the changes in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; feign death, negatively impact the ability of monks to <br/>\n&gt; continue to explore<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the social aspect of the game, i.e., difficulty getting <br/>\n&gt; into groups of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; strangers, thus not being able to share in a group activity <br/>\n&gt; and make new<br/>\n&gt; &gt; friends, etc., that is the most damaging aspect of what has <br/>\n&gt; transpired and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the core root of the anger and outrage many monks express.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Just my thoughts...take them for that and nothing more.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Leikung<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Warrior-Poet<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Bristlebane<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: Dave Gaines [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dave@...\">dave@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Thursday, December 16, 1999 9:09 AM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [EQ-Monks] Digest Number 122<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: Dave Gaines &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dave@...\">dave@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It should not be more than a game.
