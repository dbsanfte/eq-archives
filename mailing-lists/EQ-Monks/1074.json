Players on pro sports<br/>\nteams make friends on the team that they only see when they are<br/>\nplaying/practicing. They only talk to them on the sidelines/in the<br/>\ndugout/at practices. It&#39;s still just a game, not a way of life. And when<br/>\nthe rules change, and they do every so often, the players don&#39;t quit,<br/>\nthey find ways to deal with the rule changes and the game goes on. No<br/>\none quit being an offensive lineman when Football changed the rules and<br/>\nmade it illegal for offensive linemen to use their hands (they used to<br/>\nbe able to grab defensive linemen with their hands, now its called<br/>\nholding...). No one quit pro Basketball when they made it illegal to<br/>\nstand under the basket as long as you wanted or help guide a shot in (<br/>\nyou used to be able camp out under the basket as long as you wanted and<br/>\nguide anything in, now its a 3-second violation and offensive goal<br/>\ntending, thanks in a large part to Wilt Chamberlin using both these<br/>\ntactics to score 100 points in a single game...). No one quit Baseball<br/>\nwhen they added the DH nor did they quit Football when they added the<br/>\nforward pass (it used to be illegal to throw the ball forward, I&#39;m sure<br/>\nlots of defenses were P.O.&#39;d and thought the game was ruined, but they<br/>\nkept playing and found ways to deal with it...)  Lots of things will<br/>\nchange in life, and some will seem very unfair, but whinning never<br/>\nsolved any problems, and I know of no one who won anything by<br/>\nquitting...<br/>\n<br/>\nTymbyrwulf<br/>\nSolusek Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
