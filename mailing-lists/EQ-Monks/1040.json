Another thoguht is that those<br/>\n&gt;bracers come off of a difficult Mob in Lguk. at level 16 you werent<br/>\n&gt;&quot;supposed&quot; to have those. Back at level 16 when E-marr was still new and the<br/>\n&gt;highest playes were only in there low 30&#39;s noone had those bracers. People<br/>\n&gt;on the server didnt even know where they came from.
