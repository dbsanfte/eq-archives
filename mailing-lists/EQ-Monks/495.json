I saw this tip posted on a monk board.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Outside of FP, either in East Commons or North Ro, the mountains to the<br/>\nside of the inner zones are great places to train that skill up.  You do not<br/>\nneed to take damage, just as long as you make that skipping sound as you<br/>\ndescend.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Find an almost sheer wall, back up all the way to the top then run down.<br/>\nEvery time you trip, you will up your chances for a skill increase.  Back up<br/>\nto the top, then repeat.  I did this a few nights ago at the FP/NRo wall and<br/>\nmanaged to get 45 skill increases in about 30 minutes...(now 112)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Use caution and make sure you do not jump off the top of the cliff (some<br/>\nhave flat spots at the top that you can launch from), I only did this to<br/>\ntrain my Bind Wound, taking 275 DMG 2 times to lower my HPs (608 total).  If<br/>\nyou have less HPs, you could be doomed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You may even get some odd stares from passers-by like I did; &#39;What&#39;s that<br/>\nMonk doing?&#39;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Safe training to you Brothers and Sisters.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Ezhar Montenegro<br/>\n&gt; Proud Member of the Platinum Sphere Guild<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.platinumsphere.com\">http://www.platinumsphere.com</a><br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  your connection to online communities.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
