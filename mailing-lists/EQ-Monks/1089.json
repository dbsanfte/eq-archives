I believe that if you tell someone<br/>\n&gt; to take a look at themselves, and their posts from another<br/>\n&gt; perspective.  Think before they post, about half the idiot posts would<br/>\n&gt; not be sent.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If no one responds and complains about one bad email.  The <br/>\n&gt; offender will<br/>\n&gt; just send another, and another, and another.  Eventually someone<br/>\n&gt; (me) needs to tell that person that his e-mails aren&#39;t being <br/>\n&gt; productive<br/>\n&gt; and he is only hurting his own name, that person will stop or the<br/>\n&gt; emails will be a lot more well thought out.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So tell me what exactly is different about you?
