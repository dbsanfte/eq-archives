A good place<br/>\nto hunt for silk at level 11 is everfrost peaks (on the plains area), be<br/>\nlooking for Giant and Large wooly spiders.  They should all be blue and even<br/>\nfights to you, so unless you bring a healer, expect some downtime between<br/>\nbattles.  They also poison, but it&#39;s not that bad of poison.  Or you could<br/>\nhunt in West Karanas.  The giant spiders are far between (as is everything<br/>\nin that gigantic zone), but it&#39;s fairly good hunting.  Oh, and for hunting<br/>\nspiders now a days, I recommend doing it off prime time hours, as every is<br/>\nlooking for spider silks now, and we monks can&#39;t out pull the thousands of<br/>\nspellcasters out there that see a spider and burn it from a mile off.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Terence Tan Kar Chuan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:karchuan@...\">karchuan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Monk@onelist.com\">EQ_Monk@onelist.com</a>&gt;; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, September 21, 1999 7:47 PM<br/>\nSubject: [EQ-Monks] Silk Armor & Cured Silk Armor (Recommended Skill Level)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Terence Tan Kar Chuan&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:karchuan@...\">karchuan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1.
