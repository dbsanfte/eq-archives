It&#39;s like walking around in the beat up<br/>\nblue Keds you had back in 2nd grade.  Seeing as there is no &#39;mesh boots&#39; or<br/>\nanything of that ilk, I was wondering what was out there that was<br/>\nmonk-friendly (i.e. low weight).  AC is obviouly desireable, although<br/>\nanything that could offer other bonuses (stat increase, resistances, etc.)<br/>\nwould be wonderful.<br/>\n\tSuggestions, advices, personal experiences appreciated...<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nAaron Braunstein<br/>\nPacific Data Management, Inc.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aaron_braunstein@...\">aaron_braunstein@...</a>&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
