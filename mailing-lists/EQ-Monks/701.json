Aside from my monk <br/>\nI play an enchanter, and I don&#39;t really kite, but I <br/>\nthink I&#39;m an even stronger player. The enchanter is <br/>\nbecoming my favorite class.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe secret is to get the mob to run from you. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nVariant didnt Nerf anyone!<br/>\ni assume that you are referring to the recently <br/>\nannounced patch in which<br/>\nDOT were MODIFIED.  <br/>\n<br/>\n1) Kiting was widely viewed as an exploit used by <br/>\nplayers to POWER level<br/>\nat tremendous rates! THis new patch only makes that <br/>\nhabbit slightly harder<br/>\n DOT&#39;s do 66% damage while mob is running after you.  <br/>\n<br/>\n2)You may not beable to Kite BLOOD REDS anymore, but <br/>\nblues will be<br/>\nkiteable - by level 30 BLues are kicking any mele class <br/>\nplayer&#39;s butt, so<br/>\nKiters will still have a solo advantage over mele types.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Fighting in a group  your DOT&#39;s will do a good deal <br/>\nmore damge now<br/>\nbecause Variant upped the duration by 18 seconds.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll this patch does is prevent players from choosing a <br/>\ncharacter just so<br/>\nthey can Kite their way to level 50 ahead of everyone <br/>\nelse.  If you seek<br/>\nto play a character that has an unfair levelling <br/>\nadvantage over all others<br/>\nthen yes, this patch took a major chunk out of your <br/>\nbehind!  But for those<br/>\nof us who are interested in enjoying the game, role-<br/>\nplaying our chosen<br/>\nclass of character then this patch doesnt make any <br/>\ndifference at all.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------------------------------------------<br/>\nThis mail sent through newave.net webmail.
