I on the other hand have <br/>\nwalked into RE to try for a BIBS for a friend and found a 45th lvl Necro <br/>\nsitting in the room. There he was taking away from us. I do not care if you <br/>\nadd to your character if it hurts no one else, but in the case of something <br/>\nlike a BIBS where it is a fairly rare drop your taking one might mean the <br/>\ndifference from some poor appropriate level guy sitting there half an hour <br/>\nour 3 to 4 hours. The Onyx Ear rings are a frequent drop, but some of the <br/>\nother items especially the items that started this whole debate are not. Can <br/>\nanyone honestly say on this post that they have never  walked and saw someone <br/>\nobviously not there for the hunting, but instead for the items? I have <br/>\nabsolutely no problem if someone gives there second character 1,000,000 plat <br/>\nto buy everything in the game, but when they start having 45th lvl Necro&#39;s <br/>\nsitting in front of me and my friend trying to get a BIBS that becomes a <br/>\nproblem to me. If something drops maybe 3 or 4 times a day you have taken <br/>\nsomething from someone else. For you to say that you did not is just plain <br/>\nlieing to yourself. Again I have no problem with giving you character a leg <br/>\nup. I am doing something like that woth my Monk. During the course of my <br/>\nregular hunting if I find something that could be useful for the Druid I plan <br/>\non someday making I stick it in the bank. I will not though go out and camp <br/>\nsomething for him. I will not make someone wait in line behind me while I go <br/>\nfor something that my current character does not need.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
