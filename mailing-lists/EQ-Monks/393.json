This bit just gave me an idea. How about Monk<br/>\n&gt; &gt;specialization? something like pick a new skill such  as &quot;Fists like<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Stone&quot;, or &quot;Bending Reed&quot;, which might seriously add to dodging. So fists<br/>\n&gt; &gt;of stone would dish out harder hits when the skill increases and bending<br/>\n&gt; &gt;reed might seriously cut on the damage and add to the swiftness and<br/>\nagility<br/>\n&gt; &gt;of Monks. But make it a choose one or the other type of special skill.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Perhaps give us three or four skills to choose from. How about that? :o)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Quan of Tribunal<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That actually sounds like a good idea.  But at what level would these be<br/>\n&gt; available?  20?<br/>\n20 is a bit early, it should be the same time casters get their<br/>\nspecialization, or maybe the same level we get flying kick.  I think the<br/>\nearliest it should be is about 25,  but still who am I, a player, who makes<br/>\nthe changes, Verant : ()<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Perhaps have one for swifter punching too?  Fists of the Wind?  Decreases<br/>\n&gt; your delay by 1 every level? (up to a minimum of 15, or something? </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
