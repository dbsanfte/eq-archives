Climb up as far as you can, face","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1119848343\">I&#39;ve gotten my skill up to 120 at the entrance to East Commons from Northern<br/>\nRo just as my other brothers have described. Climb up as far as you can,<br/>\nface outward, and hit autorun. Depending on where you are on the cliff side,<br/>\nyou should get 4 &quot;falls&quot; that don&#39;t incur any damage but do kick in Safe<br/>\nFall. You&#39;ll get increases in a hurry using this method. Prior to this, I<br/>\nwas using the Temple of Marr in North Freeport... What a tedious chore that<br/>\nwas!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yes, keep those bandages on hand -- they will save your life. The only<br/>\nproblem with Mage-summoned bandages is that they poof when you log out and<br/>\nsometimes it&#39;s a pain trying to get back to a town with a bank. My bind<br/>\nwound skill is up to 111 and I can heal almost 30 hitpoints with one<br/>\nbandage. I always recommend keeping all your &quot;non-combat&quot; skills maxxed out.<br/>\nSwimming, sense heading, safe fall (sneak to 113 &lt;g&gt;), Feign Death. I make a<br/>\npoint of trying to max these out as soon as I attain a higher rank.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere to go at 22? Lake Rathetear might be a good spot for you to solo.<br/>\nThere&#39;s an island with a huge ramp. On the ramp are three Aviak Guards. Go<br/>\nup the ramp, target a bird, engage and run down the ramp.  All three birds<br/>\nwill come after you. Back up to the mountainside and let them get as close<br/>\nto you as you dare and feign death. They immediately go non-agro on you so<br/>\nyou can stand back up right away. They stand there looking confused for a<br/>\nminute and then they start the trip back up the ramp to their spawn points.<br/>\nIf all goes well, the separate enough so you can pick one off easily and<br/>\nengage him. Great experience at that level and sometimes you get bronze<br/>\nweapons and gold pieces. If you can get a small group together or a partner<br/>\n(one who can heal, hopefully &lt;g&gt;), try out &quot;Gargoyle&quot; Island in the Ocean of<br/>\nTears. Good experience and if you&#39;re lucky enough to get Gargoyle Eyes --<br/>\ngreat loot too.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Jeff Bleich &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dolph@...\">dolph@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Wednesday, September 08, 1999 11:57 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ-Monks] Safe Fall Tip<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Jeff Bleich&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dolph@...\">dolph@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Wow thanks for the tips , I heard another good place is Dagnors Cauldren.<br/>\n&gt;Bandages are very expensive if no mages are on and very heavy but thier a<br/>\n&gt;must.<br/>\n&gt;Any one have any sugesstions on where to hunt for 20th? im killing Gorge<br/>\n&gt;hounds now going to get 22 proabbly, but where do i go from thier unrest i<br/>\n&gt;heard? or guk?<br/>\n&gt;Proabbly no warrior types that have ton of ac but any help would be great.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Bismatal 20th Monk of CT<br/>\n&gt;----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt;From: Ezhar Montenegro &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Ezhar@...\">Ezhar@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sent: Wednesday, September 08, 1999 12:36 PM<br/>\n&gt;Subject: [EQ-Monks] Safe Fall Tip<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; From: &quot;Ezhar Montenegro&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Ezhar@...\">Ezhar@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;I meant to say a spot that you&#39;d normally take damage from, if you<br/>\n </span></blockquote>didn&#39;t<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; &gt;have safe fall. :)<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Depending on where you are Young Brother, the steep mountain walls<br/>\n </span></blockquote>outside<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;of Freeport are good Safe Fall training spots (any steep wall could suffice<br/>\n&gt;though).
