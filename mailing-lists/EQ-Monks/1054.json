And that is to get a freaking<br/>\n&gt; Werewolf<br/>\n&gt; &gt; claw. Now being one that does not like to run around in the stupid<br/>\n&gt; West<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Commonlands, or West Karana asking repetitively anyone have a<br/>\n&gt; werewolf on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tracking let me know! I got so bored and tired so I have decided to<br/>\n&gt; go to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Mistmoore and try to get to the dance floor. Now I have been to MM<br/>\n&gt; quite a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; few times but I have never been inside the castle barely even down<br/>\n&gt; the ramp<br/>\n&gt; &gt; towards the castle. mainly the Grave Yard and the zone line. Now I<br/>\n&gt; would<br/>\n&gt; &gt; like some help on any suggestions or tips as to what to go or how<br/>\n&gt; to go<br/>\n&gt; &gt; about getting to the Dance Room with the Gypsies/Werewolves....i.e.<br/>\n&gt; party<br/>\n&gt; &gt; make up and level or a site where there might be a map. Thanks for<br/>\n&gt; your<br/>\n&gt; &gt; help.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Kaladiel<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 39th Level Monk<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Brell Serilis<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;HR&gt;<br/>\n&lt;html&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nThousands of Stores.
