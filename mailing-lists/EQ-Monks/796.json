I was rather difficult to even understand<br/>\nyour message without several reads.  Would it be so difficult to format it<br/>\nin a way that is clear to everyone?  Considering that you are asking for<br/>\ninformation, you&#39;d think that you be a little more clear in your method of<br/>\nspeech.<br/>\n<br/>\nI shall endeavor to answer it as best I can.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst paragraph: No clue what you are talking about, though I think it might<br/>\nhave something to do with a football game on Nintendo, Sega or whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\n1.) Your weight info is off.  The Lockjaw Vest, as I recall, weighs 1.5.<br/>\nThe Cured Silk weighs 0.1.  The difference in coinage is about 55 coins of<br/>\nany type.  Since EQ uses a bracketing system, even 4 AC makes a difference<br/>\nand +5 Stamina means more hit points, depending on your current stamina and<br/>\nlevel.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.) Don&#39;t know what I BOBS is, but I assume BOE means Bracer of Erollisi.<br/>\nYes, Lore means you can only own one.  With the upgrade of the Bracer of<br/>\nErollisi, I feel it&#39;s worth it for the extra 0.9 weight.  I supose BOBS<br/>\ncould refer to Bracer of Battle (S?).  If so, then I don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth<br/>\nthe hassle of aquiring it.<br/>\n<br/>\n3.) Reconsider Mistmoore.  Orc Highway - what are you talking about?  Maze -<br/>\nDo you mean The Gorge of King Grobb?  If so, it&#39;s a bit slow, but still<br/>\nokay.  You really shouldn&#39;t have to contend with lawn trash in Unrest at<br/>\nthat level.  Also, consider Runnyeye, East Karana, South Karana, Rathe<br/>\nMountains, Cazic Thule, Permafrost and Upper Guk.<br/>\n<br/>\nAssume &quot;pimping&quot; means what level should you consider adventuring there.<br/>\nCazic - 20, Sol A - 25, Sol B - 35.<br/>\n<br/>\nLei  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Court Little [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:courtlend@...\">courtlend@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, October 07, 1999 4:45 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [[EQ-Monks] Digest Number 83]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Court Little&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:courtlend@...\">courtlend@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hmmmm and exactly what is your problem?
