Al the mobs will<br/>\ncome, run back to an area that is safe distance from your group, and feign.<br/>\nWhen all but 1 or 2 (or how ever many you want) run away, get up and start<br/>\npunching, then turn around and run to your group.  I&#39;ve *never* had a<br/>\nproblem with this, i&#39;ve broken the frenzy, king, lord  rooms.  Not to<br/>\nmention i did quite a bit of pulling from the waterfalls to zone, or BR to<br/>\nzone..<br/>\n<br/>\nbroy</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
