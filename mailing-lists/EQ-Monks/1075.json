Verant believes the ability of classes to pull so safely<br/>\n&gt; at high levels was simply too powerful, and thus they took it <br/>\n&gt; out of the<br/>\n&gt; game.  Half the power of FD is gone; its time to learn to <br/>\n&gt; live with the<br/>\n&gt; change.  There is no work around, monks need to suck it up and go on.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Perhaps, perhaps not.  Some are expressing some of their old success since<br/>\nthe last patch.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Formal, well thought out complaints are fine, but I find <br/>\n&gt; statements like<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Its more than a game, gimmie FD back&quot; just plain silly.  How many<br/>\n&gt; weeks of venting do I have to endure?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So why argue back?  Surely you can see that it doesn&#39;t help, and just<br/>\nextends it that much longer.  Nothing you can do is going to make the<br/>\nargument/venting be over any sooner other than expressing your symapthies.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I play a wizard...I have watched them take away our easy <br/>\n&gt; root/nuke/nuke<br/>\n&gt; strategy.  I watched them take away our escape tool, jboots.  <br/>\n&gt; I watched<br/>\n&gt; them take away our toy, manastone.  Each time I suck it up.  I still<br/>\n&gt; have friends, I still meet new people.  My power is greatly reduced<br/>\n&gt; still.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, and so have my other characters been nerfed, so what?  You don&#39;t see me<br/>\nyelling/arguing back.  It doesn&#39;t help.  Offer constructive counter<br/>\narguments, yes, but saying, in a sense &quot;You are a bunch of whiners who need<br/>\nto shut up&quot; is not going to make anyone stop complaining, nor adjust their<br/>\npoint of view to the position that maybe it&#39;s not so bad.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; But The game is just a game.  Monks have been tuned (nerfed), life<br/>\n&gt; and game go on.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Fine, you&#39;ve moved beyond it.  Others haven&#39;t.  No reason to extend this<br/>\nthread further by calling them whiners and telling the to suck it up and<br/>\nlive with it.  It&#39;s just plain inflamatory and extends the thread even<br/>\nfurther.  It you really are tire of hearing it and want the thread to die<br/>\noff, then stop responding and let it die off.  Unless you are the list<br/>\nadmin, there&#39;s no other way you can end the thread.<br/>\n<br/>\nLei<br/>\nWarrior-Poet<br/>\nBristlebane</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
