These are all words and phrases that bother me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I&#39;m going to throw up all over my cloth shoes. I have a some twinked<br/>\nitems, no doubt about it. Among my favorites are the Serp Braces given to me<br/>\nby<br/>\na dear real life friend when I first broke level ten.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo not presume to tell me how to enjoy MY game paid for with MY MONEY.

If I could play this game naked, without any<br/>\ninventory<br/>\nat all, I would. This is one of the reasons I choose the Monk class. I<br/>\ndetest<br/>\nthe idea of running all over the universe begging to group with some other<br/>\nplayers, using each other to just get a new piece of armor. If I were forced<br/>\nto<br/>\ndo that, I would not be &quot;around too much longer&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs it stands now, I am having the most fun leveling my monk, attempting to<br/>\nreach<br/>\na point in the game where I can adventure with my friends who purchased the<br/>\ngame<br/>\ntwo or three months before I did. I want to play with them, sitting in their<br/>\noffice till 3 am, playing on their T1, drinking beer, while we all are<br/>\ngaming<br/>\nTogether, not merely on the same server.<br/>\n<br/>\nStonedorn - Xegony - 15th Oval<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nJohn M.
