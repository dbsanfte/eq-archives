For example, the<br/>\nstone and iron guards in the North West corner of Nektulos forest drop gems,<br/>\nrings, words, runes, and pages.  All of these are light weight, and most<br/>\nstack.  I realize this area is a bit high for lvl 16, but the idea is still<br/>\nsound.  The common tactic is to loot everything, but those rusty weapons<br/>\njust weight too much for all but the strongest races.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could also try grouping with a high strength race to hold all the heavy<br/>\nstuff, then split the proceeds.  Of course, you have to find a trustworthy<br/>\nPC to group with.<br/>\n<br/>\nCharles Lembke<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:c-lembke@...\">c-lembke@...</a><br/>\naka, Raelph, Lvl 10 Monk, Solusek Ro<br/>\naka, Vulfgange, Lvl 26 Warrior, Solusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: James W Hooper [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhooper@...\">jhooper@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, December 08, 1999 1:46 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Monk@onelist.com\">EQ_Monk@onelist.com</a>; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [EQ-Monks] General grousing<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: James W Hooper &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhooper@...\">jhooper@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI have always thought that monks should be characters of moderation and<br/>\npoverty.  I have tried to play my character that way.  I have managed to<br/>\nsqurriel away 250 pp.  I figured that would handle most of my expenses for<br/>\nthe foreseeable future.  I buy muffins and water for food and drink.  All<br/>\nof my magic tiems have been given to me or looted off of drops.  However, I<br/>\nhave reached an impasse.  Someone last night was auctioning off Serpent<br/>\nbracers.  When I asked how much, I was shocked to hear 800 pp.  I guess<br/>\nthat I am going to have to break down and loot everything or hope that I<br/>\nstumble across a raqre drop.  I am not going to be able to afford anything<br/>\nbetter if I don&#39;t do so.  I think it is sad, that if I am going to be a<br/>\nsuccessful adventurer, I am going to have to be like the rest of the money<br/>\ngrubbing classes:  Rogues, Shadow Knights,  Warriors, Druids, Shamans,<br/>\nRangers, Bards,  Enchanters, Wizards, Magicians, Necromancers,  holy<br/>\nClerics and pious Paladins.
