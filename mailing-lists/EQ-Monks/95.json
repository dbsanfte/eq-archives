Granted maybe the warrior class is not really any better than the paladin class in melee (and it is, IMHO), but why should warriors get another big boost over the already humbled monk?  Despite the fact that we get feign death eventually, our armor class and atttack does not usually equal that of a warrior, which is alright now, but if they get another boost, where is this going to leave the monk.  I for one am against the warrior update, unless the make a minimal change to the monk class.  I&#39;m not asking for much, I&#39;m just asking for something that by making the warrior &quot;king of melee&quot; that they just not leave the monks in the dust.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaerjyon, 11th Rank monk, E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
