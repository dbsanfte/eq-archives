EQ is based on<br/>\na text MUD system that have been around for over 10 years<br/>\nnow.  In the world of MUDs, there are MUDs that allow twinking<br/>\nand ones that don&#39;t.  Verant made the CHOICE when they<br/>\ndesigned EQ to allow twinking, as they chose not to implement<br/>\nany of the well-known ways of stopping twinking.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was a conscious, design-level decision.  This will not be<br/>\nreversed any time in the future.  So any arguments you are<br/>\nmaking as to why twinking should not be allowed are fruitless<br/>\nin terms of changing the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen your arguments must be &quot;moral&quot; ones- &quot;why you should<br/>\nnot twink your characters even though you can&quot;.  And, well,<br/>\nmoral arguments are not easily solved.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nClarity Harvestmoon,<br/>\nKarana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
