Mobs just do not get interrupted just by hitting them <br/>\nanymore.  You need somebody with a stun attack or spell, so you can keep <br/>\nbeating on the kobold priest for instance, and the bam, it complete heals, so <br/>\ntry again and bam it does it again.  And SOW, without root to nerf it, or <br/>\nsnare to keep it there, the mob will most likely get away, and in dungeons, <br/>\nthat mean one thing, train comin back at ya.<br/>\nSo let me restate my &quot;ideal&quot; lvl 45+ group: 3 monks, druid, cleric and <br/>\nenchanter.  You get the best of all worlds there really and no mob resisting <br/>\nthe monks&#39; fists.  Where&#39;s your nuker you ask?  Have you ever seen a monk in <br/>\naction with fbss and celerity or swift like wind?  The is no downtime with <br/>\nthis group at all.  You have your group gater and snarer.  But then again it <br/>\nalways depends on the ppl actually playing these chars, cause if they aren&#39;t <br/>\nfun, you&#39;re not gonna have fun.  So in the end, group with ppl you like, it <br/>\nmakes the world of Norrath much more enjoyable.<br/>\n<br/>\nKanja<br/>\n49 monk<br/>\nRodcet Nife</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
