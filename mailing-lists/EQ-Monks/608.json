That would solve a lot of those<br/>\nproblems, but in my real opinion, I just really love this game, it may be<br/>\nbecause I am still so new, haven&#39;t even got past my first month and my 19th<br/>\n(almost 20th Level) Monk is my pride and joy. I really enjoy when people<br/>\nlook at my gear and say nice spread, I worked damn hard for my stuff and it<br/>\nis my own personnel satisfaction I get from my character. If I see someone<br/>\nelse who is twinked, I think that&#39;s good for them, I hope they enjoy that<br/>\nbecause I know they will enjoyment of the game for they have nothing to look<br/>\nforward too, so those people won&#39;t be around too much longer.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKaladiel <br/>\n19th Season<br/>\nBrell Serilius<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Bennett, Brian [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:BRIAN.BENNETT@...\">BRIAN.BENNETT@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, September 15, 1999 6:04 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: [EQ-Monks] Twinking thoughts, continued<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Bennett, Brian&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:BRIAN.BENNETT@...\">BRIAN.BENNETT@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI have to agree with Praelor.  I don&#39;t know *why* twinking bothers me.  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t deny it is perhaps partial jealousy.  Hell yes I would like level 40+<br/>\narmor to start out with!  I&#39;m level 20 and I&#39;d take it now!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I think what really gets me is the unfair (And it is) advantage that the<br/>\ntwinkers get over a non-twinked same level person.  Now perhaps that the<br/>\nadvantage is more of a psycological thing.. i.e. I *think* they have a<br/>\nbetter chance than me.  But I feel that if I&#39;m standing beside a level 20<br/>\nmonk with high level gear and me with my low level gear, I feel like the<br/>\nmonk is going to be able to fight better and for longer without downtime<br/>\nbecause of his ill gotten gear.  I haven&#39;t seen any &quot;studies&quot; to back up my<br/>\nfeelings, but it just makes sense to me :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I don&#39;t want to open the &quot;If you want better gear go get it&quot; can of<br/>\nworms.  I get the best that me and my group can get.  In a group of 10-12<br/>\npeople, we have to balance out quest items - it&#39;s only fair.  So that is not<br/>\nan option, so to speak.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimple solution (And I like it no matter what anyone says)  Make gear start<br/>\nto have a level requirement.  If that &quot;Glowing Baseball cap of Might&quot; comes<br/>\nfrom a level 40 MoB, then only a level 35+ can wear it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the thing that bothers me the most about EQ is the money situation.<br/>\nThe greed factor has almost turned it into a UO-type situation.  I realize<br/>\nthis is a total tangent, but how many of you have actually had to turn OFF<br/>\nthe auction channel on a non-bazaar day?  I hate it.  I hate greed.  I&#39;m<br/>\nlevel 20 and I have 15 pp to my name.  But that&#39;s just me and I could be<br/>\nstupid :)<br/>\n<br/>\nBack to the twinking issue, I see one more factor:  My over developed sense<br/>\nof injustice.  If I had to work so hard to get what I have, what gives Mr.<br/>\nTwinkee the right to get everything handed to him?  Actually, now that I<br/>\nthink about it, it is the sense of injustice.  Jealousy is just a mitigating<br/>\nfactor :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n    GRAB THE GATOR!
