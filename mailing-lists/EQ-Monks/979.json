At the higher<br/>\nlevels there are so few places to hunt for exp and they all are train heavy<br/>\nplaces with lots of wanderers anbd thats just a risk neither I nor potential<br/>\ntrains victums want.<br/>\n<br/>\nKizmet Bayashi<br/>\n45th level train engineer<br/>\nE-Marr<br/>\nDa`Kor<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:blacoste@...\">blacoste@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, November 30, 1999 11:50 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ-Monks] The best fight of my life<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:blacoste@...\">blacoste@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I know a lot of people are going to disagree with me, but Verant&#39;s change<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; the feign death is warranted. People WERE exploiting the FD especially<br/>\n&gt; inside the planes. One way to fix that WITHOUT screwing a lot of lower<br/>\nlevel<br/>\n&gt; people was to make it where any creature under level 35, would think you<br/>\n&gt; were dead and forget about you while creatures 35th and up would use the<br/>\n&gt; different percentages setup by Verant. I think this fair. I have ONLY used<br/>\n&gt; feign death in serious situations where there was a train on my butt and I<br/>\n&gt; was definitely going to die because I couldn&#39;t make it to a zone. I feel<br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s what it was intended to do and some people figured out a way to<br/>\n&gt; exploit it in the planes with the big creatures. So thats that. I&#39;m fine<br/>\n&gt; with it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As for other things, I have a 36th level monk on the Tribunal and I<br/>\nWOULDN&#39;T<br/>\n&gt; have made it this far without having a balanced group of guildmembers to<br/>\ngo<br/>\n&gt; around with. Since monks dont get the huge amounts of HPs we really lose<br/>\nout<br/>\n&gt; to the other warrior classes. Saying that I can honestly say that the<br/>\nmonks<br/>\n&gt; are the best class in the game. I know you&#39;re looking forward to that<br/>\nflying<br/>\n&gt; kick skill too and while i&#39;m at 180 skill I still miss about 60% of the<br/>\ntime<br/>\n&gt; ,AGAINST LOW BLUES,even though I have a 131dex and 137agi. Even with these<br/>\n&gt; problems I will continue to play my monk though, UGLY robe and all,<br/>\nbecause<br/>\n&gt; I have to admit I have had fun playing it. Seeing &quot;You kick a greater<br/>\nkobold<br/>\n&gt; for 88 points.&quot; is one hell of a rush. I also have one hell of  bank<br/>\n&gt; account.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Carissa (36th level Monk, Tribunal)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
