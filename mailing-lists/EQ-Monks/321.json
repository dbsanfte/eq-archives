I just turned in my Red Headband items last night, with some trepidation.  I was terrified that the trainer would not hand over the headband, but it did work.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe asks you to find Brother Dareb and Brother Shen.  If they are not alive, bring back their remains (Dareb&#39;s Skull, Head of Shen) along with those of Ghanex Drah (Head).  Turn those in along with your Orange Headband.  I handed them to the Trainer in that order and was rewarded with the red headband.  The faction adjustments included that of the Silent Fist Clan as well as the Ashen Order, with a couple of others.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I was one of the lucky ones who managed to get both the headband and sash quests going before they &#39;Lored&#39; the guild notes.<br/>\n<br/>\n:(<br/>\n<br/>\nHang in their Brothers and Sisters<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------- Original Message ----------------------------------<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Noah D.
