Sitting back timidly and watching your enjoyment being<br/>\n&gt;lessened and doing nothign about it but scowling occaisionally at the ones<br/>\n&gt;responsible).  It should be enjoyed.  But, I know it is addictive.  Verant<br/>\n&gt;COUNTS on the fact that they can screw over this game to their vision of an<br/>\n&gt;ideal game and keep you playing at the same time, only because you are too<br/>\n&gt;addicted to do more then complain and bitch and put down other complainers<br/>\n&gt;and bitchers.  I&#39;ve quit EQ, but I can&#39;t help look at all this and laugh.<br/>\n&gt;It&#39;s funny.  Seriously.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     I don&#39;t like playing a game where I have to do any MAJOR <br/>\n&gt;&quot;Adjustments&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    Hell, Origin&#39;s only fault, and their fatal fault, was the fact that <br/>\n&gt;they<br/>\n&gt;screwed their customers over individually with corrupt game masters and<br/>\n&gt;peice-a-crap customer support.  But they never mauled their game as <br/>\n&gt;terribly<br/>\n&gt;as Verant is doing to EQ.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    I would still love this game and play it if it werent for some of the<br/>\n&gt;things they&#39;ve done.  But I can&#39;t do anything about it but leave.  Im not<br/>\n&gt;letting them have my 10$ a month, and if some of you are so beat up about<br/>\n&gt;this game, seriously, take a look at the broad range of where it&#39;s heading<br/>\n&gt;and whats happening to it.  Do you see a pattern in the &quot;Tunings&quot; verant is<br/>\n&gt;making?  Take a big broad look at it all, and say to yourself &quot;Do I still<br/>\n&gt;like this game?&quot;  &quot;Is it still worth it?&quot;  &quot;Should I support this company<br/>\n&gt;with my money any longer?&quot;  If you do still like it, I congratulate you:<br/>\n&gt;You&#39;re damn good at taking huge amounts of shit from others to try to enjoy<br/>\n&gt;something.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     Your decisions are your own, but sometimes it&#39;s good to take a good <br/>\n&gt;step<br/>\n&gt;back and look at the big picture, and take a look where it&#39;s going, and<br/>\n&gt;decide whether you want to go the same way or not.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   I agree with one thing though, that if some of you people seriously <br/>\n&gt;think<br/>\n&gt;of Everwhack as more than a game... You should see some help, or something<br/>\n&gt;like that.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;Darkblade<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt;From: Dave Gaines &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dave@...\">dave@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sent: Thursday, December 16, 1999 1:28 PM<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [EQ-Monks] Digest Number 122<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Dave Gaines &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dave@...\">dave@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Brother, Neighbor, college friend, someone in pasadina you don&#39;t even<br/>\n&gt; &gt; know... Its a game.  You happen to play with your brother, that&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wonderful, however EQ is still a game.  For you, the ability to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; play a game together means you can spend time together.  That<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is wonderful.  This doesn&#39;t make EQ more than a game.  EQ didn&#39;t exist<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 9 months ago, at some date in the future, EQ will not exist.  I hope<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you have a contingency plan ready, because EQ is not life, or a way of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; life, it is simply a game you enjoy together.  Joke all you want that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it is life, fine, no problem.  But when you read a post where someone<br/>\n&gt; &gt; seriously thinks it is more than a game.  Please step back from it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and think about it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; IF EQ was perfect, or something you&#39;ve been doing for tens of years<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and nothing had ever changed on it, then you would have a much better<br/>\n&gt; &gt; argument.  However we can clearly see that monks aren&#39;t being singled<br/>\n&gt; &gt; out, almost every class is being tuned every month.  This one was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; slightly major.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; But enough is enough.  Shit happens and we adjust.  This mailing list<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is not about these kinds of posts or this kind of thread.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The purpose of this list is to distribute information about Monks to the<br/>\n&gt;players of EverQuest.
