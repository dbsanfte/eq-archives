I was level 23 in a group of 5, including<br/>\na level 27 druid and 28 wizard. Those suckers hit HARD, so I don&#39;t think I&#39;d<br/>\nbe able to solo one until 30, 31, maybe, if then. A friend also got a black<br/>\npearl off of a Centaur Corser (sp?). And like someone else mentioned<br/>\nalready, griffs seem to drop them too. They&#39;re rare, so just have to keep<br/>\nworking at it.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Dave Gaines &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dave@...\">dave@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Monday, September 20, 1999 3:31 PM<br/>\nSubject: [EQ-Monks] Monk Questions<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Dave Gaines &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dave@...\">dave@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Black pearls come from Aviak Avocets right?
