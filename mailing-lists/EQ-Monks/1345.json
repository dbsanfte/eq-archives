Direction 1:","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-133871908\">This is the great debate once every few months - twinking.  From my point of<br/>\nview (As a level 36 monk) I see two directions to this argument.  Direction<br/>\n1:  Lower level characters that have scrapped and fought and saved for weeks<br/>\nto buy equipment, seeing a level 5 wizard strutting around with a SMR and<br/>\nsuch....    <br/>\nDirection 2: Higher level characters that have to put up with greedy members<br/>\nof group and guild and others, that are farming and camping for items for<br/>\n&quot;their twink&quot;   Examples of this have been given out in this list over and<br/>\nover, so I won&#39;t regurgitate them.  Make no mistake, there are people out<br/>\nthere that would never be selfish or greedy - I know a few that if they win<br/>\nan item they don&#39;t need, they turn around and give it to one that does.  All<br/>\nthe arguments are the same as well.  I&#39;m not advocating one position or the<br/>\nother - just stating some observations.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a level 50 character wants to twink a newbie with equipment, then fine by<br/>\nme.  His newbie or someone elses.  This is stuff he / she got (fairly or<br/>\nunfairly).  It&#39;s not like they get to go to the Magic Well and pull this<br/>\nstuff out of thin air.  They camped for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo Twinkers aren&#39;t really a problem.  Really they aren&#39;t.  Game balance and<br/>\nall that, they&#39;re not hurting anyone.  It&#39;s the methods behind getting the<br/>\nequipment that I think is suspect.<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to be the lower level monk screaming that twinking was unfair.  But<br/>\nfor many people, it&#39;s about the only way to keep the game interesting.  Now<br/>\nthat I&#39;m a little higher level, I get mad at people camping 6 spawns at<br/>\nonce, or group members being selfish about things me or another group member<br/>\ncould use.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut Verant can&#39;t (And shouldn&#39;t) get into the business of trying to<br/>\n&quot;legislate&quot; morals.  The new looting code is interesting - but won&#39;t really<br/>\nstop ninja looters.  If people want to be assholes, let them be assholes.<br/>\nSpread the word.  I for one will not group with Obsidian Warlords, and if<br/>\nsomeone asks me, I tell them why.  I won&#39;t group with Dragons of Asia, or<br/>\nseveral other camping/farming guilds.  Now my entire guild has stopped<br/>\ngrouping with them too.  Some of the names are memorized, some are not.<br/>\nPoint is, if someone is twinked, don&#39;t group with them if it upsets you -<br/>\nand spread the word to those that share a sympathetic cause.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n -----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: \tJames W Hooper [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhooper@...\">jhooper@...</a>] <br/>\nSent:\tThursday, February 10, 2000 9:14 AM<br/>\nTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject:\tRe:[EQ-Monks] Experience and Twinking<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: James W Hooper &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhooper@...\">jhooper@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;____________________Reply Separator____________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Firstly:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;What makes you think &quot;twinking&quot; is a problem that verant wants to curtail.<br/>\n </span></blockquote> They<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;have never, not once made a post, comment editorial, patch or any other<br/>\n&gt;statement in any way about it.
