Even<br/>\nthrough fourteen orders of training, I have considered them less than equal to<br/>\nthe task of one on one combat. Your abilities are best served in the undead<br/>\ndepths of Unrest or the outlying Cauldron. It would be my hope that no monk<br/>\namong us would go so far as to take the life of a fellow human in order to<br/>\ngain<br/>\nsome modicum of advancement. Our talents are best reserved for defending those<br/>\nless fortunate from the hordes of undead and staving off attacks from those<br/>\nbeast that are less civilized than we and which aggressively pursue us<br/>\nunprovoked. I wish you good fortune in your travels. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn Quellious&#39; name,<br/>\n<br/>\nManjushri<br/>\nBearer of the yellow sash of the Ashen Order<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 07:46 AM 9/13/99 -0700, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Lombard.Mikhael&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Mikhael_Lombard@...\">Mikhael_Lombard@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;What is the location of the Nybright Sisters in the Faydark, and willa 19th<br/>\n&gt;lvl monk get exp from them....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;ALMOST 20th LVL and next increase.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>---------------------------------------------------<br/>\nJohn N.
