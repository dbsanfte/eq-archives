And yes, I twink between them, but<br/>\nnot outrageously so, and not so it unbalances anything.  For example, my<br/>\nmonk (lvl 10) was generating cash at a healthy clip.  So he gave all his<br/>\nmoney to my warrior blacksmith (lvl 19).  The blacksmith use the pp to make<br/>\na partial suite of large banded armor for my ogre shaman (lvl 8), who in<br/>\nturn is looking for mesh armor in Upper Guk for my monk.  I try to make it<br/>\nmore of a micro economy.  If these three characters were owned by different<br/>\npeople, it wouldn&#39;t be a twink at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have no doubt that there is outrageous twinking going on (saw a lvl 8 ogre<br/>\nwarrior with full bronze plate), but I think you can twink within reason and<br/>\nnot upset the game balance.<br/>\n<br/>\nCharles Lembke<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:c-lembke@...\">c-lembke@...</a><br/>\nAKA, Raelph, Vulfgange, Argharghargharh, Orpheuss, Matar, and company.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
