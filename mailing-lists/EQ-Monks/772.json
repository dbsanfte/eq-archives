If","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1517735221\">Ok, I was aiming to post a group for the high teens into the twenties.<br/>\nMy highest character is level 30, so I really don&#39;t know high level<br/>\ngroup strategies.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we are to debates, lets debates about the same thing....what<br/>\nis a good group for the 20s?  The bard doesn&#39;t have the mana song,<br/>\nthe cleric can&#39;t res, the enchanter doesn&#39;t have the mana regen <br/>\nspell (until level 29). <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd since its near impossible to find the perfect group<br/>\nHow about we discuss groups that compliment well.  And since<br/>\nthis is the monk mailing list lets make sure the Monk is on it...<br/>\n<br/>\nI think someone posted that Monk/Shaman is a nice team for 2 person group.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat about 3 or 4 or 5 or 6?<br/>\nPersonally, I think the bard with his attack speedup song can <br/>\ncompliment the Monk well, that is from experience with<br/>\nbard/warrior teams though.  Warriors get crafted armor decently<br/>\nthrough these levels, so they experience a jump in AC compared<br/>\nto the monk/ranger/paladin/sk, right?  So if you can<br/>\nfind a warrior as your primary tank, the party will take a lot less<br/>\ndamage?  I know later on the monk catches up to the warrior in AC,<br/>\nbut not in the 20s.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, I&#39;m rambling now...if you guys want to discuss level 50 groups<br/>\ndon&#39;t do them when some of us are talking about level 20 groups..<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Felizpunk@...\">Felizpunk@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 10/6/99 3:10:46 PM Eastern Daylight Time, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dave@...\">dave@...</a> <br/>\n&gt; writes:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt;  &gt; 1 - Monk<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; 2 - Monk / Ranger / Paladin<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; 3 - Enchanter<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; 4 - Druid / Shaman<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; 5 - Cleric<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; 6 - Wizard / Magician<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; <br/>\n&gt;  Change 2 to Monk / Warrior.  In a group as diversified<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  as this, the spells they have are almost useless, and a warrior<br/>\n&gt;  should be able to taunt the monsters better.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  Add a bard, replaces 5.  In a group of 5 or 6<br/>\n&gt;  a bard is a far better healer than a cleric, and if needed in<br/>\n&gt;  a pinch, the druid/shaman can do the quick healing.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  Maybe for lower levels, but a cleric is ESSENTIAL at high levels. Druids, <br/>\n&gt; Shaman, and paladins pale in comparison to clerics at very high levels, in <br/>\n&gt; terms of healing powers. They are a must!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
