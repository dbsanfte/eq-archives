My played time is now about 4 day, 6 hours.  Is this about right for a lvl 11 guy?  What are your played times for your lvl 32 monk?  I&#39;m just interested in knowning if I&#39;m behind the curve here.  I just dont have the patience to get to lvl 17!  It is frustrating.  Right now I&#39;m in Befallen, as a lvl 11.  Is there a more appropriate place that I should go perhaps?  Right now I&#39;m not worried about RPing too much, because I die way too much, so I guess that means I just want to lvl ASAP.  Where&#39;s a good place to get EXP at my level?  Grouping tips/anything would be appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaerjyon &lt;The Keepers&gt;, E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
