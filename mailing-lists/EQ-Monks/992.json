No disrespect meant to<br/>\n&gt; you or any of the others, but it sounds like feign death was a crutch.<br/>\n&gt; Maybe at higher levels we need to learn to adjust our tactics and stop<br/>\n&gt; meeting problems head on.  We should be thinking fighters.  Let the wariors<br/>\n&gt; wade in and trade blows with the big bad guy.  Let the warriors take the<br/>\n&gt; role of the tank, while we take the role of the Smart bomb.  We zero in on<br/>\n&gt; a target and take them out clean and fast.  I agree that warrior based<br/>\n&gt; classes and their weapons can do more damge than we can, per hit, but I<br/>\n&gt; still think we hit more often.  They are also too dependent upon those<br/>\n&gt; weapons for their abilites.  Everything we have is innate.  Let Verant<br/>\n&gt; throw in a zone or two that magic doesn&#39;t work and see who is really the<br/>\n&gt; true meele (sp?) master. Strip a warrior of his weapons and armor and you<br/>\n&gt; have a target .  Strip us, and we are still deadly.

People WERE exploiting the FD especially<br/>\n&gt; inside the planes. One way to fix that WITHOUT screwing a lot of lower level<br/>\n&gt; people was to make it where any creature under level 35, would think you<br/>\n&gt; were dead and forget about you while creatures 35th and up would use the<br/>\n&gt; different percentages setup by Verant. I think this fair. I have ONLY used<br/>\n&gt; feign death in serious situations where there was a train on my butt and I<br/>\n&gt; was definitely going to die because I couldn&#39;t make it to a zone. I feel<br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s what it was intended to do and some people figured out a way to<br/>\n&gt; exploit it in the planes with the big creatures. So thats that. I&#39;m fine<br/>\n&gt; with it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As for other things, I have a 36th level monk on the Tribunal and I WOULDN&#39;T<br/>\n&gt; have made it this far without having a balanced group of guildmembers to go<br/>\n&gt; around with. Since monks dont get the huge amounts of HPs we really lose out<br/>\n&gt; to the other warrior classes. Saying that I can honestly say that the monks<br/>\n&gt; are the best class in the game. I know you&#39;re looking forward to that flying<br/>\n&gt; kick skill too and while i&#39;m at 180 skill I still miss about 60% of the time<br/>\n&gt; ,AGAINST LOW BLUES,even though I have a 131dex and 137agi. Even with these<br/>\n&gt; problems I will continue to play my monk though, UGLY robe and all, because<br/>\n&gt; I have to admit I have had fun playing it. Seeing &quot;You kick a greater kobold<br/>\n&gt; for 88 points.&quot; is one hell of a rush.

Your monk is not a worthless pile of<br/>\n&gt; meat. Its not a mana sponge, or a helpless school girl. The monk class at<br/>\n&gt; any level does a Great Deal of Damage, and in my opinion more than any other<br/>\n&gt; melee class with the exception of a warrior with Plane of Fear equipment.<br/>\n&gt; Your strength lies not with one or two glorious swings for 70 points of<br/>\n&gt; damage, but in four punches for 23, and a flying kick for 52. Your Armor<br/>\n&gt; class is not as high as a warriors, it never will be. Get used to it, but<br/>\n&gt; also get used to Block, Dodge, Block. You hit points are lower, until you<br/>\n&gt; factor in a 25% hit point heal every six minutes, you&#39;re selling yourself<br/>\n&gt; short.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As for playing with Twinked characters who out damage you, I must answer to<br/>\n&gt; the positive. I&#39;ve been playing with Ranger and Bard both of which carry top<br/>\n&gt; of the line Ykeesha&#39;s and they generally out damage me (then again, they<br/>\n&gt; take the damage then, too and I&#39;m a hell of a lot harder to hit than some<br/>\n&gt; ranger). The gap is narrowing however, and would be closed if they were not<br/>\n&gt; wearing haste sashes. Remember, the higher you level, the less of an<br/>\n&gt; advantage Twinking Gives.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yes Verant has changed our most unique skill, it will still save youin tight<br/>\n&gt; situations, however. At least we have it! I&#39;ve used it numerous times to get<br/>\n&gt; myself out of Castle Mistmoore when EVERYONE in my party died, twinks and<br/>\n&gt; casters alike.

People WERE exploiting the FD especially<br/>\n&gt; &gt; inside the planes. One way to fix that WITHOUT screwing a lot of lower<br/>\n&gt; level<br/>\n&gt; &gt; people was to make it where any creature under level 35, would think you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; were dead and forget about you while creatures 35th and up would use the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; different percentages setup by Verant. I think this fair. I have ONLY used<br/>\n&gt; &gt; feign death in serious situations where there was a train on my butt and I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; was definitely going to die because I couldn&#39;t make it to a zone. I feel<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that&#39;s what it was intended to do and some people figured out a way to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; exploit it in the planes with the big creatures. So thats that. I&#39;m fine<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; As for other things, I have a 36th level monk on the Tribunal and I<br/>\n&gt; WOULDN&#39;T<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have made it this far without having a balanced group of guildmembers to<br/>\n&gt; go<br/>\n&gt; &gt; around with. Since monks dont get the huge amounts of HPs we really lose<br/>\n&gt; out<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to the other warrior classes. Saying that I can honestly say that the<br/>\n&gt; monks<br/>\n&gt; &gt; are the best class in the game. I know you&#39;re looking forward to that<br/>\n&gt; flying<br/>\n&gt; &gt; kick skill too and while i&#39;m at 180 skill I still miss about 60% of the<br/>\n&gt; time<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ,AGAINST LOW BLUES,even though I have a 131dex and 137agi. Even with these<br/>\n&gt; &gt; problems I will continue to play my monk though, UGLY robe and all,<br/>\n&gt; because<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I have to admit I have had fun playing it.

As I&#39;ve said before, Verant has a MUD mentality in which they balance<br/>\n&gt; gameplay at the expense of logic. This is bad design.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Getting back to the point is the way in which two main incidents were<br/>\n&gt; handled. The first being the new monk robe, which is marginally better than<br/>\n&gt; a lockjaw vest AC 12 vs AC 9 vs and choice of which stat increases you think<br/>\n&gt; is most valuable. Personally, I&#39;ll take the AC at this point in my monks<br/>\n&gt; career. Introducing this item seemed to me a border line waste of time, not<br/>\n&gt; mine, but theirs. The second incident being the FD thing. My favorite<br/>\n&gt; example being when you stand back up and everyone but the caboose of the<br/>\n&gt; train forgets you and he goes along re-aggroing the lot.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think what got everyone so worked up was the FD split-pull defined the<br/>\n&gt; monk&#39;s role in the group. Now that role has changed, and its led to<br/>\n&gt; confusion and no small amount of bitterness.

Like I said, my monk was great fun until<br/>\n&gt; very high levels for me so I expect you will enjoy your monk for quite a<br/>\n&gt; while.  If he wasn&#39;t I would not have gotten him so far.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;Prehaps those of us who haven&#39;t played under the old feign death, will find<br/>\n&gt; &gt;other means to deal with the problems you listed.  No disrespect meant to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;you or any of the others, but it sounds like feign death was a crutch.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well I did not speak at all of FD pulling which is what you probably heard<br/>\n&gt; everyone mention.  And FD IS a crutch.  It was meant to be.  I continued<br/>\n&gt; playing my monk because we were the masters of melee and also because<br/>\n&gt; of FD (I started my FD countdown at 12th level).  At my level, rogues are the<br/>\n&gt; masters of melee and FD simply doesn&#39;t work well enough to use as a safety<br/>\n&gt; net.  Plus the mobs I face cannot reasonably be meleed to death.  We are<br/>\n&gt; just there to do damage to keep the mobs thinking about us while the nukers<br/>\n&gt; and DoTers (and healers) so their jobs.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;Maybe at higher levels we need to learn to adjust our tactics and stop<br/>\n&gt; &gt;meeting problems head on.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well, the FD pull technique was meant for just that 8).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;Strip us, and we are still deadly.  I think we just have<br/>\n&gt; &gt;to adjust our purpose in the Verant universe<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I didn&#39;t get to my level just so I can still kill mobs while looking for my<br/>\n&gt; corpse.<br/>\n&gt; But of course that was another role for FD.  Corpse recovery missions.  No<br/>\n&gt; longer.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:blacoste@...\">blacoste@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;I know a lot of people are going to disagree with me, but Verant&#39;s change to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the feign death is warranted. People WERE exploiting the FD especially<br/>\n&gt; &gt;inside the planes. One way to fix that WITHOUT screwing a lot of lower level<br/>\n&gt; &gt;people was to make it where any creature under level 35, would think you<br/>\n&gt; &gt;were dead and forget about you while creatures 35th and up would use the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;different percentages setup by Verant. I think this fair.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Inside the plains?  At 36th level (unless you have another plane level char)<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t see how you can come to that conclusion.  If anything, the change<br/>\n&gt; to FD is even more of an exploit.  Imagine now that every mob in the game<br/>\n&gt; is able to track monks without fail.  And as another post mentioned.  If you<br/>\n&gt; think something is an exploit, why would you say it is ok for mobs under 35th<br/>\n&gt; level?  I have always accepted that feigning on non KoS mobs and then<br/>\n&gt; popping back up (to bandage or whatnot) was something of an exploit and I<br/>\n&gt; have been expecting a fix.  If they removed that a lot of lower level monks<br/>\n&gt; who relied on it to kill aviaks or whatever would have grumbled loudly as it<br/>\n&gt; would remove their main soloing technique (what would your reaction be if<br/>\n&gt; they did that to you at say 20th level or so?).  However the nerf they did to FD<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t fix an exploit.  It just gave the mobs one.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;I have ONLY used<br/>\n&gt; &gt;feign death in serious situations where there was a train on my butt and I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;was definitely going to die because I couldn&#39;t make it to a zone.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Good luck now since that aspect of FD has also been seriously degraded.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;I feel<br/>\n&gt; &gt;that&#39;s what it was intended to do and some people figured out a way to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;exploit it in the planes with the big creatures. So thats that. I&#39;m fine<br/>\n&gt; &gt;with it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What difference does it make how  it was intended?  What you are saying is<br/>\n&gt; that verant should be expected to make things like tactics, strategy, and other<br/>\n&gt; forms of thinking in the game illegal.  Giving mob an unlimited<br/>\n&gt; tracking/telepathic<br/>\n&gt; ability is the exploit here.  What monks did was perfectly reasonable as long as<br/>\n&gt; mobs aren&#39;t telepathically linked, which - oh no - now they are!   Telepathic<br/>\n&gt; orcs.<br/>\n&gt; What will they think of next.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;John Carney&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jcarney@...\">jcarney@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;Well, this is just getting plain silly. Your monk is not a worthless pile of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;meat. Its not a mana sponge, or a helpless school girl. The monk class at<br/>\n&gt; &gt;any level does a Great Deal of Damage, and in my opinion more than any<br/>\n&gt; &gt;other melee class with the exception of a warrior with Plane of Fear equipment.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Not a mana sponge?  How many 120+ hits do you think a monk can take? See<br/>\n&gt; how long you can stand up to the frenzied ghoul even at 50th when you out level<br/>\n&gt; him by 5 or so!  The next best thing to a healer is a great taunting tank or<br/>\n&gt; another<br/>\n&gt; melee class that dishes out more damage.  I certainly am not whining about other<br/>\n&gt; classes doing more damage than me.  I&#39;d love to have them in my group!  The<br/>\n&gt; problem I face is that if I go into a zone shouting &quot;monk looking for group&quot; I<br/>\n&gt; will be<br/>\n&gt; met by silence.  Why?  Suppose I actually do outdamage other classes.  The<br/>\n&gt; problem is that I can&#39;t outdmage by enough to compensate for:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; the massive HPs of a warrior (complete heal becomes much more efficient and<br/>\n&gt; the warrior gives the cleric the time to cast it, and the warrior can taunt the<br/>\n&gt; mob<br/>\n&gt; off when it inevitably goes after the cleric).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; the dual wielding ability of a ranger with great weapons (ykesha = 44th level<br/>\n&gt; monk with similar skill) who can snare SOW and TRACK.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Paladins with great quest weapons with a ton of HP, a complete heal, great<br/>\n&gt; taunting, and a great AC.  Not to mention a role as a backup healer<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Rogues just tear mobs apart, easily outdamaging any other melee class in the<br/>\n&gt; game at high levels.  Of course they are in far worse shape than monks without<br/>\n&gt; someone taking the mobs off them.  Rogues were born nerfed and will die<br/>\n&gt; nerfed.  But the rogue is still the master of melee.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;and in a second post&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;I didn&#39;t say it was. I don&#39;t think FD pulling is an exploit. It is handled<br/>\n&gt; &gt;wrong in the Gameplay Logic. Personally I think once you FD and a mob _sees_<br/>\n&gt; &gt;you back on your feet again, it should never believe another oneo of you<br/>\n&gt; &gt;FDs. As I&#39;ve said before, Verant has a MUD mentality in which they balance<br/>\n&gt; &gt;gameplay at the expense of logic. This is bad design.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What you neglect here is the fact that the mobs you are FD pulling (actually<br/>\n&gt; the mobs you aren&#39;t pulling) DON&#39;T see you get up, assuming you are doing<br/>\n&gt; it right.  Why should they run back to you when they don&#39;t see you get up?  Of<br/>\n&gt; all the people who look down on us for complaining about the nerf, not ONE<br/>\n&gt; person has managed to explain what makes this more logical.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;back to first post&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;Your strength lies not with one or two glorious swings for 70 points of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;damage, but in four punches for 23, and a flying kick for 52. Your Armor<br/>\n&gt; &gt;class is not as high as a warriors, it never will be. Get used to it, but<br/>\n&gt; &gt;also get used to Block, Dodge, Block. You hit points are lower, until you<br/>\n&gt; &gt;factor in a 25% hit point heal every six minutes, you&#39;re selling yourself<br/>\n&gt; &gt;short.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; How about a 44th level ranger hitting 4 times with his ykesha for 40+ each<br/>\n&gt; and a proc for 70?  I have kicked for 111, but I usually miss and my average<br/>\n&gt; damage is maybe 40ish.  Our defensive skills cap the same as theirs so they<br/>\n&gt; will dodge parry riposte about as much as we do.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When travelling with a healer or 3 you should never need mend unless you bite<br/>\n&gt; off more than you can chew.  But if that happens your group is more likely to<br/>\n&gt; evac.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;As for playing with Twinked characters who out damage you, I must answer to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the positive. I&#39;ve been playing with Ranger and Bard both of which carry top<br/>\n&gt; &gt;of the line Ykeesha&#39;s and they generally out damage me (then again, they<br/>\n&gt; &gt;take the damage then, too and I&#39;m a hell of a lot harder to hit than some<br/>\n&gt; &gt;ranger). The gap is narrowing however, and would be closed if they were not<br/>\n&gt; &gt;wearing haste sashes. Remember, the higher you level, the less of an<br/>\n&gt; &gt;advantage Twinking Gives.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It is very easy to see how much of an impact twinking gives.  But it is not<br/>\n&gt; really<br/>\n&gt; a matter of twinking.  Equipment is permanent.  And on old servers, with limited<br/>\n&gt; inventory/bank space, newer/better weapons will find their way down the line<br/>\n&gt; and the average level character holding a particular prize will decline over<br/>\n&gt; time.<br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s just the way the server based economy works.  So it isn&#39;t a matter of<br/>\n&gt; monks<br/>\n&gt; getting worse, it is a matter of the weapons held by other melee classes getting<br/>\n&gt; better.  I am sure Verant intended the monks to be masters of melee.  For a<br/>\n&gt; while<br/>\n&gt; they succeeded quite well in my opinion.  However, as the other melee classes of<br/>\n&gt; a particular level improve over time with new weapons, monks have basically been<br/>\n&gt; gathering dust and this melee edge has shrunk or become non-existent to the<br/>\n&gt; point<br/>\n&gt; that the other classes offer other things that outweigh any supposed edge we may<br/>\n&gt; have.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; For 1-handed weapons, the best a monk can ever do is dmg 14 delay 36.  There<br/>\n&gt; are now a ton of weapons in the game that have better dmg/delay ratios than that<br/>\n&gt; and also proc for even more damage (at 44th level a monk is 12/36 which is the<br/>\n&gt; same ratio as a ykesha).  Giving that to a warrior who has 1.5-2x your hp, and<br/>\n&gt; can<br/>\n&gt; taunt makes a monks damage dealing capacity in a group very much in doubt.  Plus<br/>\n&gt; at the highest levels, melee is just to keep the mobs busy while the DoTs do<br/>\n&gt; their job<br/>\n&gt; and nukes finish the mob off.  When shamans and druids can heal and DoT for<br/>\n&gt; 2000+ and wizards can chuck 1100+ per ice comet, the extra 2-3 points per hit we<br/>\n&gt; may or may not be adding just don&#39;t seem to be enough to compensate the group<br/>\n&gt; for<br/>\n&gt; any of the other abilities the other melee classes bring.  That is the reason<br/>\n&gt; why monks<br/>\n&gt; got defined as pullers because it was the only thing we were unarguably the best<br/>\n&gt; at<br/>\n&gt; and of the most important contributions anyone can make to a group.  How many<br/>\n&gt; plane or dragon raids were considered to require a monk (pre-patch)?  It was<br/>\n&gt; a moot point.  You had one or you just didn&#39;t bother.  Now, monks can still<br/>\n&gt; chain<br/>\n&gt; pull if necessary and lay on the ground.  Now even a wizard out melees the<br/>\n&gt; monk.  I could be doing that, but that&#39;s just not any fun.  Which is the whole<br/>\n&gt; point.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;Yes Verant has changed our most unique skill, it will still save youin tight<br/>\n&gt; &gt;situations<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Think again.  Even the core purpose for FD has been seriously nerfed.  It<br/>\n&gt; fails way way way too much, and new spawns can now see through it.  And<br/>\n&gt; FD is now very very dangerous not just to the monk but to anyone in the same<br/>\n&gt; zone.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;To be honest, I think we&#39;ve passed the meaningful discussion of the class<br/>\n&gt; &gt;and have entered into &quot;the Grass is Greener&quot; syndrome. If you&#39;re so unhappy<br/>\n&gt; &gt;with your Monk, Give It Up and go play a Dark Elf Necro. Please don&#39;t take<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the Monk Name in the Realm of Envious Complainers.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It has nothing to do with any other class being better.  I am all in favor of<br/>\n&gt; warriors rangers and what not being great in my group.  I am not looking to<br/>\n&gt; be the star of the show.  I just want to be invited to a show once in a while.<br/>\n&gt; The problem I have is not with all these great weapons lying around, but the<br/>\n&gt; general consensus at high levels that &quot;monks are only needed for pulling, and<br/>\n&gt; if they can&#39;t pull why invite them into the group?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;rant on&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That being said, I hear too much of this &quot;play another character if you don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; like<br/>\n&gt; the change&quot; crap.  Why even play in a game that consistently makes these sorts<br/>\n&gt; of changes?  If I wanted to play a DE necro, I would have made one already (of<br/>\n&gt; course they have been seriously nerfed as well, but not as badly because they<br/>\n&gt; are still desirable in groups).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I wanted to play a monk.  The monk I wanted to play existed when the game<br/>\n&gt; started.  I had something to look forward to.  He doesn&#39;t anymore and there is<br/>\n&gt; nothing for me to look forward to unless I like to play with my face attached to<br/>\n&gt; the ground while the action surrounds me.  In any case, even if I were to make<br/>\n&gt; another character, what will stop Verant from nerfing that class into the<br/>\n&gt; ground?<br/>\n&gt; Take a look at what&#39;s on the test server.  Shaman spell diurations (eg SOW) are<br/>\n&gt; cut in half) and druids lost tracking.  Who knows what else.  Will monks get<br/>\n&gt; something in the future to make them seem useful again?  Sure.  They will<br/>\n&gt; introduce the Iskar monk removing yet another unique aspect of the (human)<br/>\n&gt; monk.  What race will virtually all new monks be once the expansion comes?<br/>\n&gt; Humans? Guess again.  It is very possible (and I am not prone to conspiracy<br/>\n&gt; theories) that the human monk is being phased out of existence.  Of course<br/>\n&gt; we&#39;ll have to wait and see what the new race is like, but the email I got from<br/>\n&gt; Verant stated very little of what will be new aside from Iskar monks.  An<br/>\n&gt; interview with brad McQuaid tells us not to expect any new skills unless we are<br/>\n&gt; Iskar.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Tell me what else I can look forward to.<br/>\n&gt; &lt;rant off&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; _______________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; _______________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Message: 12<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Tue, 30 Nov 1999 16:03:25 -0600 (CST)<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Dizzy J.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dizzyj@...\">dizzyj@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Easy Now<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; maybe FD pulling itself is an exploit?  maybe verant never intended the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; monk class<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to be able to break spawns by fd pulling?  maybe they just intended it as a <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &#39;&#39;get out<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of death free&#39;&#39; card for the individual monk?  I personally think some <br/>\n&gt; &gt; spawns should<br/>\n&gt; &gt; not be able to be broken since it makes the game too easy.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I imagine they didnt think of fd pulling, it just happened.  Thats whats<br/>\n&gt; kind of unrealistic.  IMHO, whe you build a game of this magnitude, you<br/>\n&gt; build the environment, and see what falls.  they planned on the monk being<br/>\n&gt; the melee damage dealer, and instead he ends up being a puller.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I kind of see the fd pulling along the same lines as bard twisting.  did<br/>\n&gt; they plan for that? probably not.  But I bet bards would be upset if they<br/>\n&gt; removed that ability.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; _______________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; _______________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Message: 13<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Tue, 30 Nov 1999 16:50:34 EST<br/>\n&gt;    From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JnglSkyPWR@...\">JnglSkyPWR@...</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Intellectual exercise was RE: Easy Now<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Our role hasn&#39;t really changed all that much (I&#39;m speaking from the lvl 50 <br/>\n&gt; point of view and pulling in the planes, and the harder mobs on Norrath.)  We <br/>\n&gt; are still needed in PoH w/o a doubt.  I believe Verant has nerfed FD to what <br/>\n&gt; they want it to be, which is just causing ppl to play more and items for high <br/>\n&gt; lvls harder to get.  This is extremely evident in the drop percentage of <br/>\n&gt; plane armor.  When PoF first opened, armor dropped quite often, now you can <br/>\n&gt; get groups of 18 to 30 ppl on a plane, spend 18 hours plus and get maybe 5 to <br/>\n&gt; 7 drops total.  Verant is just tryin to make more money off us, and that is <br/>\n&gt; where my major gripe is.  There are various ways around FD pulling technique. <br/>\n&gt;  Pulling to a &#39;safe&#39; spot and waiting til one mob is left, then have an <br/>\n&gt; archer shoot that one mob and pull it. This makes it so the monk cannot fight <br/>\n&gt; though the entire battle.  Then we stand up, the aggroed monsters run back to <br/>\n&gt; us at the &#39;safe&#39; spot and we FD again, having the archer pull one more when <br/>\n&gt; it is left.  This method is the safest, but the most boring for us.  Another <br/>\n&gt; method is to have an enchanter along.  The monk pulls to the &#39;safe&#39; spot, and <br/>\n&gt; has to wait until ALL aggroed mobs are on him, then FD.  The enchanter cast <br/>\n&gt; their AE mem blur, and the monk waits until one mob is left, then pull it.  <br/>\n&gt; This will not work on PoF, as the enchanter will be aggroed before being in <br/>\n&gt; range to cast the spell.  It is also dangerous if ALL the mobs aggroed to the <br/>\n&gt; monk are not in area of the spell.  So in standing will cause the ones not in <br/>\n&gt; range to aggro again and pull everything in the way on you again.  This <br/>\n&gt; allows the monk to participate in the battle but is riskier.  No longer are <br/>\n&gt; we able to pull AND fight, so we don&#39;t contribute nearly as much to a group <br/>\n&gt; anymore.  Oh, and on a side note, FD DOES NOT work like they have said on <br/>\n&gt; mobs lvl 35+.  From personal experience, I have FD 15 to 20 times in a row <br/>\n&gt; and still have mobs aggroing me that are no where near line of sight.  The <br/>\n&gt; whole FD nerf and it&#39;s excuse for one is just a ploy by Verant to stall for <br/>\n&gt; the expansion, and for this reason as all others everyone has, I plead with <br/>\n&gt; you to continue to write in feedback to have FD put back to it&#39;s original <br/>\n&gt; status.  We were once also instrumental in corpse recovery, but having mobs <br/>\n&gt; continued aggro, now it is near impossible unless the dungeon is a low lvl <br/>\n&gt; for the lvls involved.  I could go on and on, but it would take hours to <br/>\n&gt; write out all the feelings I have on this subject.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kanja<br/>\n&gt; Rodcet Nife<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; _______________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; _______________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Message: 14<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Tue, 30 Nov 1999 16:55:53 EST<br/>\n&gt;    From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JnglSkyPWR@...\">JnglSkyPWR@...</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Easy Now<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; No, maybe they didn&#39;t see it when they FIRST programmed the game, but I <br/>\n&gt; played in beta and let me assure you, Verant saw what it could do when <br/>\n&gt; testing it.
