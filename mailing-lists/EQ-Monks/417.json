I&#39;m<br/>\ntalking on a broad level here, not just one or two things.  Can you guess<br/>\nwhat would happen if the monks got their way and got several different color<br/>\nvariations on &quot;a simple stripe on a head?&quot;  Every other group would come<br/>\nscreaming to Verant about they need a little change here and a little change<br/>\nthere.  That&#39;s when it would become a problem with texture memory and<br/>\neverything else I wrote about.  When EVERYONE gets little changes, and<br/>\nleather armor is in 47 different colors, and all the rest of the changes<br/>\nthat are being asked for constantly to make for some more differentiation<br/>\namongst the players.  I haven&#39;t misquoted anything, because I didn&#39;t quote<br/>\nanything in my response.  Perhaps you should reread my letter and think<br/>\nabout it a little before you go off like this.  I do happen to THINK a lot<br/>\njust like you say I don&#39;t, and I was making a point about changing the<br/>\nsystem as a whole, not just one little headband.  Please grow up next time<br/>\nbefore you decide to rant and rave about a post that you don&#39;t seem to<br/>\nunderstand what&#39;s being talked about within it&#39;s context.  Thanks much<br/>\n<br/>\nRandy<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Court Little &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:courtlend@...\">courtlend@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, August 30, 1999 10:59 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ-Monks] Re: Monk Loot and Modifications...technical text<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Court Little&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:courtlend@...\">courtlend@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Holy smokes WAKE UP AND SMELL THE JAVA!!!! Im a little tired of reading<br/>\n&gt; these posts that the headband animation or sash cant be added because the<br/>\n&gt; &quot;2mb buffer over flow tri linera mip mapped anti aliased Voodoo 1 yad yada<br/>\n&gt; yada&quot; machines will slow down and cant handle it. If you believe that then<br/>\n&gt; call me quick cause I got a whole lot of pure grade a sunshine in a bottle<br/>\n&gt; to sell ya. THINK! We are not asking for entirely new animations of<br/>\ndragons<br/>\n&gt; or flying vehicles or backflips out of dangeers way. All we are asking for<br/>\n&gt; is a nice yellow, blue, ornage, red, pink, muave, sandle whatever colored<br/>\n&gt; strip on my head! For christ sakes barbarians get 19 different helmets<br/>\nwith<br/>\n&gt; all sorts of funky horns and yet if you put a simple colored stripe on my<br/>\n&gt; head or waist the graphics engine cant handle it and the game will come to<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; screaching halt? Please stop the non sense! I have a feeling the<br/>\ndevelopers<br/>\n&gt; are being misquoted here on this thread and their comments are in<br/>\nreference<br/>\n&gt; to other much larger issues within the game and not a simple stripe on a<br/>\n&gt; head.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;              Free Games & Cash Prizes!<br/>\n&gt; Gamesville - The World&#39;s Biggest & Best Game Show Site!<br/>\n&gt;         <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/ad/gamesville0\">http://www.onelist.com/ad/gamesville0</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
