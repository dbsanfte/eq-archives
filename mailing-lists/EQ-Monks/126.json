I.e., when I was level 10ish or so I found<br/>\nthat wearing a full suit of leather actually gave me more AC than trying to<br/>\nstay under 14 weight, but at level 23 each increase of 1 weight over 14<br/>\nyields a pretty nasty loss in AC.  My guess is the monk you asked about<br/>\nweight was probably at a lower level where indeed weight doesn&#39;t seem to<br/>\nmatter that much.  Rest assured though, it starts to very quickly in the<br/>\nteens.  Like Praelor said, you really want to start trying to find<br/>\nwoven/mesh to replace the leather asap.<br/>\n<br/>\nPraelor, you got 15pp as a share of a full suit of bronze?  Ouch man, I<br/>\nthink you got jobbed :)  Most of those pieces on E-Marr go for 20pp+ each.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn answer to the second original question, assuming Verant took the standard<br/>\nuse of AC from RPG&#39;s time immemorial, AC generally affects your chance of<br/>\nbeing hit as well as how much damage you take when you do get hit.  You can<br/>\ntest this by dueling a like-level friend with low AC, than having them wear<br/>\nall their armor and/or using a few AC buffs and dueling again.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps some,<br/>\n<br/>\n- Chai, Taunter of Happy Fun Ball (E-Marr)<br/>\n<br/>\nPS:  If loot is what&#39;s bumping your weight up, there are several pouches you<br/>\ncan use that cut the weight by a % on items you put in them.  The easiest<br/>\nones to get are probably the ones Nillipus loads (Rivervale/dale whatever),<br/>\nand I hear there&#39;s an orc in High Hold Pass that loads a nice one too.  I&#39;ve<br/>\nread you can actually use a large sewing kit as well (don&#39;t hit combine),<br/>\nbut I haven&#39;t tested that one personally.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Robb Flynn [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:RobF@...\">RobF@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, July 06, 1999 6:14 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ-Monks] Weight<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Robb Flynn &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:RobF@...\">RobF@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWeight most definatley does AC. I make it a point when hunting in groups to<br/>\njust take the coin split. If you are worried about not getting decent coin,<br/>\nprobably 75% of the time, when someone in my group runs off to sell, they<br/>\ncome back and give me a little coin since I am not taking any loot. Last<br/>\nnight, for example, a party member looted a full set of bronze in our course<br/>\nof adventuring. He sold the entire set to a player, turned around and gave<br/>\nme 15 plat.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as weight affecting atk, I have never seen anything official, but I<br/>\ndo believe this happens. I think it also affects dex, but haven&#39;t had the<br/>\nchance to really look into it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would recommend definately getting netted or woven armor if you can afford<br/>\nit. Too bad I didn&#39;t see this earlier, as I just upgraded to full mesh and<br/>\ngave away my full set of woven to a younger Brother.<br/>\n<br/>\nPraelor<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\tBlizzard [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:blizzard15@...\">blizzard15@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tSunday, July 04, 1999 12:03 PM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Monk@onelist.com\">EQ_Monk@onelist.com</a>; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject:\t[EQ-Monks] Weight<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have heard many people say that weight affects my ac, then I have also<br/>\n&gt; heard many that say that weight affects my chance of hitting.

When I<br/>\n&gt; asked him he said that weight doesn&#39;t matter at all for monks. Now, I<br/>\n&gt; usually have more weight than 14 and I find myself missing more then my<br/>\n&gt; other less bulbous monk counterparts. So, what&#39;s the truth does weight<br/>\n&gt; matter for us?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I also was wondering, does ac and atk mean the damage we take and do, or<br/>\n&gt; the chance we have to get hit or hit.
