I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-346450012\">NOT werewolf talons, these are for the crafted BP quest and they are no<br/>\ndrop. What you need are werewolf claws. And it was not rare to see them sold<br/>\nfor 1k. I traded the Lupine Claw Gauntlets for a Crown of the Froglok King<br/>\nwhen I got my Treant Fists, so it can be a very valuable item.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with most of the advices.<br/>\nAbout the bracers, I recommend a Hero Bracer in a few levels. You will be<br/>\nable to camp the hero mino with a good group. The difficult part is then to<br/>\nincrease your faction with the Steel Warriors, because you need to be in<br/>\nhigh &quot;amiably&quot; to succeed. There are a few quest to do it, and it took me 3<br/>\ndays. AC 9, STR +10, +5 poison and disease, wt 4.0. Yes they are heavy, but<br/>\nyou can live with it. My wt is under 14, and it is worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to have a pure AGI/DEX gear, but I switched to pure AC a few levels<br/>\nago. I keep my old gear though, to make some tests in the future.<br/>\nThe Robe of the Lost Circle and the Treant Fists are the best items we can<br/>\nhave for hands and chest (with Syythrak Hide vest), but they are hell of<br/>\ncamps, so I would just recommend to let luck give them to you. You can camp<br/>\nit like I did, but it is very time consuming (took me more than 200 hours<br/>\ntotal for the fists, I was particularly unlucky).<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is what I have at lvl 40:<br/>\n<br/>\n2 Obsidian bead hoop (2 Diamondine earrings would be ok, but not necessary)<br/>\nCollar of undead protection (Runed lava pendant would be ok, but resists are<br/>\nnice too)<br/>\nCrown of Froglok King<br/>\nCured silk shoulderpads (nothing better for us before planes, what a joke !)<br/>\nLizardskin tribal mask (I need to go to Kedge Keep to find the Pearlescent<br/>\nmask)<br/>\nAzur sleeves<br/>\nSymbol of royalty to Vox<br/>\nHero bracer<br/>\nRobe of the Lost Circle<br/>\nWhite wolf hide cloak (Cloak of shadow or Hooded black cloak would be<br/>\nbetter, but both very rare)<br/>\nTreant Fists<br/>\n2 platinum fire wedding rings (platinum with fire opals)<br/>\nFlowing black silk sash (Thick banded belt if you prefer AC and STR, but I<br/>\nprefer haste here, both very rare items too)<br/>\nGatorscale leggings<br/>\nCured silk slippers (looking for Wolf fur slippers)<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not speaking about plane or dragon items here. But it can give you an<br/>\nidea of a possible evolution in the long term.<br/>\n<br/>\nTsin Suchiko<br/>\n40th rank, Tunare.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:imari_dellimore@...\">imari_dellimore@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:imari_dellimore@...\">imari_dellimore@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, February 02, 2000 3:10 PM<br/>\nTo: Worlord; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re[2]: [EQ-Monks] What to buy?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:imari_dellimore@...\">imari_dellimore@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nDecent equipment though I have some suggestions for upgrading:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Werewolf hid gloves are very obtainable:<br/>\n<br/>\nGo to MM and auction to buy some werewolf talons from some of the higher<br/>\nlevel<br/>\nplayers out there.  A good deal is about 200pp (trust me you might get it<br/>\nfor<br/>\nfree! They are fairly common drop - 2 or three are typically dropped in a 3<br/>\nhour<br/>\nperiod in the music room).  Take these to Karg Icebear with 75pp (?? double<br/>\ncheck <br/>\nthat amount)  to earn yourself a pair of Lupine gauntlets.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
