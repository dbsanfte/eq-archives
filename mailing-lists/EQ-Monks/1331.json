If you","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1670540250\">I am usually at around 12 or 13 weight, depending on how much plat I choose<br/>\nto carry on me.  Personally, I think that large bags are not the way to go.<br/>\nIf you are really careful, you should buy two spits (6 slots, weight 0.2).<br/>\nI carry two spits and a sewing kit (8 slot, wt 0.4)...total bag weight is<br/>\n0.8 which is still less than one large bag.  I generally never loot because<br/>\nI am usually always grouped with members of my guild who do a master loot.<br/>\nThe only problem with spits and sewing kits is the evil combine buttion.  If<br/>\nyou can find enough will power to stay away from it there shouldn&#39;t be a<br/>\nproblem.  I have destroyed stuff in the past, but it is usually just<br/>\nmuffins, milk, bandages, or shurikens.<br/>\n<br/>\nChingon Cabron &lt;Art of War&gt;<br/>\nMonk of the 35th Chamber<br/>\nBrell Serilis<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Worlord&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:worlord@...\">worlord@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, February 08, 2000 1:00 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ-Monks] Re:What to buy?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Worlord &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:worlord@...\">worlord@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It is somewhat high; however, with it on, my total weight is still<br/>\n&gt; &gt; under 9<br/>\n&gt; &gt; stones and that includes food, drink, and several stacks of bandages.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; much of a burden and it is greater by 2 AC over cured silk. I am also<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sometimes<br/>\n&gt; &gt; guilty of duel weilding combine warhammers (7.3 WT). Typically I group<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; warrior and a ranger along with casters, so I rarely take hits and can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; afford<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the over 20 weight. I hope to replace them soon with Black Enamelled<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Maces<br/>\n&gt; &gt; which will shed about six stones of weight. Nothing else on my person<br/>\n&gt; &gt; weighs<br/>\n&gt; &gt; much more than 0.1 with the exception of a Bracer of Erolissi (1.0 WT)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Serpentine Bracer (0.8 WT). Rusty Spike Shoulderpads, incidentally,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; are also<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 2.5 WT and provide 3AC with +5 STR.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; In Quellious&#39;s Name,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Manjushri Bodhisattva<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Bearer of the Red Sash of the Ashen Order<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (Fennin Ro)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;                           [ONElist Sponsor]<br/>\n&gt; &gt;                Please click above to support our sponsor<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Under 9?  thats impressive... what backpacks/boxes do you use... if any?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I generally am at 14 or so... of course I carry an Sewn Evil Eye Pack<br/>\n&gt; (3wt) and a few Large bags which are 1 wt each<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I know its very un-monk of me but I have never abided by the 14 stone<br/>\n&gt; rule.  By this I mean that many monks will never loot past 14 stones but<br/>\n&gt; I think thats stupid and you will never make money.  Sure your losing AC<br/>\n&gt; and can potentially die faster but its a risk you take to actually make<br/>\n&gt; some money in the game.
