I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hunt in East Commonlands and therefore tailoring<br/>\n&gt; is a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; simple skill to use because pelts are so common.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; However, Patchwork has become too easy for me and<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have done some research into Studded Leather.  As<br/>\n&gt; most<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of you know, making studded armor requires studs. <br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; do not wish to take the time to make studs because<br/>\n&gt; &gt; what I like most about tailoring is I do not have<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; spend time doing it, I just kill animals and use<br/>\n&gt; their<br/>\n&gt; &gt; pelts.   Does anyone know if it is possible to buy<br/>\n&gt; &gt; studs, or anyone on the Karana Server near<br/>\n&gt; Freeport<br/>\n&gt; &gt; who sells them.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you are pursuing making studded armor because of<br/>\n&gt; the satisfaction of<br/>\n&gt; having made your armor yourself I wish you good<br/>\n&gt; fortune.  If you are making<br/>\n&gt; it because you want either to upgrade your armor or<br/>\n&gt; plan on selling it I am<br/>\n&gt; afraid you will most likely be disappointed. <br/>\n&gt; Studded armor unfortunately is<br/>\n&gt; far to difficult to make for the amount of<br/>\n&gt; protection it provides.  For the<br/>\n&gt; studs you must find a talented blacksmith willing to<br/>\n&gt; make them for you.  If<br/>\n&gt; you can find one they will most likely be priced at<br/>\n&gt; 1PP each.  If you can<br/>\n&gt; find someone to make them for you I recommend<br/>\n&gt; spending all you can to get as<br/>\n&gt; many studs as possible.   Because of the difficulty<br/>\n&gt; of studded armor you<br/>\n&gt; will go though many, many studs on your way a suit<br/>\n&gt; of armor.  Also, the<br/>\n&gt; tailoring skill seems to improve very slowly after<br/>\n&gt; you have reached an<br/>\n&gt; ability of 26.  The other problem is that studded<br/>\n&gt; armor does not provide as<br/>\n&gt; good protection as other types of armor you could<br/>\n&gt; find on the corpses of<br/>\n&gt; certain creatures in Norrath.  But as I stated at<br/>\n&gt; the beginning, if you are<br/>\n&gt; able to make and wear a full suit of studded the<br/>\n&gt; self satisfaction could be<br/>\n&gt; well worth all other obstacles.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------<br/>\n&gt; Mark<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; For great simple at home income opportunities check<br/>\n&gt; these out:<br/>\n&gt; 1.
