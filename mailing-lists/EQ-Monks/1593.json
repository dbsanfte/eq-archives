During that time, we frequently<br/>\nhunted EK, or Runnyeye, as a group.  ( Grouping Druid...I know...you are<br/>\nshocked... )  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, because I read this and other Monk boards, just to see what is going<br/>\non... I got into the habit of checking tracking everytime I was in the gorge<br/>\nfor whatever reason.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell we were in Runnyeye, I died... bound in HH Bank... No big deal.<br/>\nRunning through the gorge... I spot the alchemist on tracking... right at<br/>\nthe Runnyeye door.   I get there, and he is attacking a dwarf who was just<br/>\nfighting the reg gobs,  dwarf getting thrashed.  She I heal the dwarf, then<br/>\nbegin to blast the Alchemist.  Now I have my indoor grouping spells loaded,<br/>\nnot my soloing spells... and I just died...meaning I have no additional mana<br/>\nreserve, or armor, or even a weapon.  Our group happens to contain a monk...<br/>\na good friend of a guildmate... so I start yelling for them to zone out<br/>\nhere, into the gorge... they are waiting just on the other side of the zone<br/>\nline for me to zone in.  I was near death, and had to zone to save my<br/>\nbutt... but the whole time... I had to practically BEG to get them to come<br/>\ninto the gorge... monk would not even zone until after the battle was<br/>\nover...and I explained to the rest of the group what this was that I had<br/>\nnearly died again over.  They had to beg him to get him to come out before<br/>\nhe did.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe complained the rest of the night about the weight of it &quot;putting him<br/>\nover&quot;.  I think he destroyed the mace and never did the quest.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yes, this monk was low 20s at the time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEverytime I hear about the long camp time in the gorge, I think of this.  I<br/>\nthought some of the rest of you should too.  And if you run into Gohku on<br/>\nthe Brell Server, you can tell him what you think about it, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nFormerly Sonsi Leafcrafter<br/>\nDruid of 31 seasons<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKlakk Klokk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
