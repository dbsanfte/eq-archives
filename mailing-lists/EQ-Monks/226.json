I remember how <br/>\nneat it was to get my first white training sash... it was the first <br/>\n&#39;magic&#39; item of any kind that I had ever owned.  But soon the items <br/>\nrequired to obtain higher sashes demanded levels the normal <br/>\nacheivement of which would give you better items in any event!<br/>\n\tI have acquired the purple headband and the red sash and <br/>\nhaven&#39;t really used anything since that initial white sash (which was <br/>\nquickly replaced with a woven belt, as I recall).  Recently, I&#39;ve <br/>\nsporadically used the purple headband because the only other decent <br/>\nhead items I had access to was a Blackened Iron Crown which was FAR <br/>\ntoo heavy to use practically.  This is a temporary solution until I <br/>\ncan get my hands on an Executioner&#39;s Hood, at which point the band <br/>\nwill go back into the bank.  (If I still had my Mesh headpiece, I&#39;d <br/>\nuse that instead.)<br/>\n\tI don&#39;t see this situation changing, as the stats I&#39;ve seen <br/>\non the Blue and Black items (looted from the corpses of trainers) are <br/>\nnothing to get excited about either.  Personally, I&#39;ll probably get <br/>\nthem (when the quests are implemented, that is) solely because I&#39;m a <br/>\nstubborn S.O.B. and not because they have any real use. :(<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nAaron Braunstein<br/>\nPacific Data Management, Inc.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aaron_braunstein@...\">aaron_braunstein@...</a>&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
