But its a 1 hand slashing<br/>\nweapon.  Really expensive, I think....  But still, something like that that<br/>\nhad charges of poison or some other spell that could be refilled with a<br/>\nspecial item would be really interesting.. (For instance, serum of slowness,<br/>\nthat would DOT and slow the creature down, and would require some item<br/>\ngained off a creature to replenish.)  Monks are indefinitely cool, but we<br/>\ncould all use a refreshing new addition.  Maybe a cool graphic for our<br/>\nsashes/headbands would be good too.....  And a manuever that tosses your<br/>\nenemy back would be good for feigning.   Nail em away then walk off a few<br/>\nsteps and feign.  You could get it at 15 or something and the distance you<br/>\nthrow the enemy could be skill based...  And quite considerable at high<br/>\nlevels. =)<br/>\n<br/>\n     Also....  Is there anyone out there who plays Xegony who is absolutely<br/>\nswamped with spare platinum and has nothing to do with it?  I need armor so<br/>\nbadly...   things that con white to me may as well con red..<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Darkanano, 8th circle monk, Newbie Of Eternity, of Xegony.....</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
