If they are not<br/>\nagro to me, I just fd, get up, then start bandaging right away.

If you<br/>\nrecieve &quot;SoANDSo <br/>\n\t\thas fallen to the ground&quot; you have failed.  If you get no<br/>\nmessage, chances <br/>\n\t\tare you succeded (this is not always true).  Go up to a<br/>\ncreature that <br/>\n\t\tnormally doesnt aggro on you, something really green, smack<br/>\nit, then when <br/>\n\t\tyou know it is attacking you, FD.  If it &#39;forgets&#39; you, its<br/>\nworking.  My <br/>\n\t\tskill is over 100, and it works most all the time, I rarely<br/>\nget the message <br/>\n\t\tanymore, but I get many times where I am being mobbed, and I<br/>\nwill FD and <br/>\n\t\tonly SOME of the mobs forget me, and this is only for a<br/>\nsecond.  I am <br/>\n\t\tcurrently in unrest and I can usually FD to most mobs that<br/>\nare up to a low <br/>\n\t\tred to me.  Hags on the other hand I have only fooled a<br/>\ncouple of times.  <br/>\n\t\tMost of the times even when I time it inbetween their<br/>\nspells, they still <br/>\n\t\tseem to not be fooled by my feign.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
