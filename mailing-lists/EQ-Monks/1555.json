On Iksar, you get 100 as the base, rather than 0 as the base as with every other race on","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-534411615\">FOR THE LEARNING IMPAIRED:<br/>\n<br/>\nEVERYONE has a level cap on swimming.  On Iksar, you get 100 as the base,<br/>\nrather than 0 as the base as with every other race on Norrath.  The<br/>\nProgression remains the same, 5 for ever level.  Meaning a Level 5 human can<br/>\nreach 25 swimming skill, BUT a level 5 iksar can reach 125 skill.<br/>\nThe only skills without level caps are the trade skills (Fishing has a cap<br/>\nthough).<br/>\nHumans get no XP bonus, general consensus is that Error in coding gave bonus<br/>\nto Halflings.<br/>\n<br/>\nIksar have massive disadvantages to counter their strengths.<br/>\n\tTrolls have a 15% RACIAL XP penalty.  The previous quoter was<br/>\nmistaken.  25% is the penalty for troll (15%) and Shadowknight (10%)<br/>\n\tIksar have a 20% Racial.<br/>\n\tAn error allowed the Iksar to be non KOS is a few places... This<br/>\nerror was changed on 4/28.  Iksar are now KOS to everything, even vendors.<br/>\nI am not sure if this is Threateningly or true Scowls KOS.  If it is Scowls,<br/>\nthen there is no way for them to increase that faction.  As it is now, there<br/>\nis only one zone in Antonica that Iksar can be bound, Arena.  Only one in<br/>\nFeydwer, G. Feydark.  And unless something new has been found, Kunark has<br/>\nonly one, Cabilis ( actually more than one zone, but the difference is<br/>\nnegligible ).<br/>\n\tIksar monks lose most of the Natural Haste of Human Monks.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIksar will be powerful monks, and powerful in any class save SK (smaller<br/>\nsize only advantage, but countered with lack of slam/front stunable), but<br/>\nIksar will not be replacing any of the other races, even Iksar monks.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
