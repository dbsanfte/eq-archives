I have<br/>\n&gt;personally been trying to up my dex, in an attempt to get my double attack<br/>\n&gt;and dual wield to go off more (that&#39;s not so useless in my eyes). As for<br/>\n&gt;dropping AGI, that gives you AC (at least it effects the number on the<br/>\n&gt;screen, which isn&#39;t totally indicative of what&#39;s going on). As near as I can<br/>\n&gt;tell, having a High AGI helps you when taking a hit, by lessening the amount<br/>\n&gt;of damage you take. I get hit a lot less hard then some of the other party<br/>\n&gt;members with a lower AGI.
