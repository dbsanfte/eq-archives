In light of this new information - what do all you<br/>\nmonks<br/>\n&gt; out there see as the most important stats for a monk, now? How would you<br/>\n&gt; focus your items (ie STR? AC? HPS? AGI? DEX? STA?)? And how would you<br/>\n&gt; distribute your starting points?  Maybe a few could name some equipment<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; backs up their opinions.<br/>\n&gt; Thanks in advance for everyone&#39;s input =)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kyeric<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; FREE ADVICE FROM REAL PEOPLE!
