This one skill alone<br/>\nmakes up for a huge number of the things that have irritated me about being<br/>\na monk and has restored my faith quite a bit in the Gods of Balance who<br/>\nroam the halls at Verant.  Not only has it saved my behind on a number of<br/>\noccasions from rampaging Giants, Ghouls, trains of various flavors, etc.,<br/>\nbut has also allowed me to do the following:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Leap on any &#39;dog pile&#39; forming around high-level creatures (LockJaw,<br/>\nGiants, etc.) with near impunity.<br/>\n- Draw any number of rampaging high-level NPCs from other players while<br/>\nthey run away.  Once they&#39;re safe, I hit the dirt.<br/>\n- Lure NPCs away from other people&#39;s corpses while they drag them to a<br/>\nsafer location for looting.<br/>\n- Explore areas I&#39;d never dream of exploring almost any other way.<br/>\n- Drop in the middle of a dangerous area and act as a lookout for others<br/>\nwho need up-to-the-minute intelligence as far as what&#39;s going on.<br/>\n- Do a &#39;temporary camp&#39; wherever I am so I don&#39;t have to log out if I need<br/>\nto go AFK in the middle of a dangerous area.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe ideas just keep coming.<br/>\n\tHeh... you warriors can keep your armor, you mages can keep your<br/>\nsissy little lightning bolts, bards can beat their drums in a corner...<br/>\nBetween Feign Death and Mend, I&#39;ll take being a monk any day!<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nAaron Braunstein<br/>\nPacific Data Management, Inc.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aaron_braunstein@...\">aaron_braunstein@...</a>&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
