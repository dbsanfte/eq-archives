The only time this affects you is if you are competing for the same spawns.

I don&#39;t know *why* twinking bothers me.  I<br/>\n&gt;don&#39;t deny it is perhaps partial jealousy.  Hell yes I would like level 40+<br/>\n&gt;armor to start out with!  I&#39;m level 20 and I&#39;d take it now!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;But I think what really gets me is the unfair (And it is) advantage that the<br/>\n&gt;twinkers get over a non-twinked same level person.  Now perhaps that the<br/>\n&gt;advantage is more of a psycological thing.. i.e. I *think* they have a<br/>\n&gt;better chance than me.  But I feel that if I&#39;m standing beside a level 20<br/>\n&gt;monk with high level gear and me with my low level gear, I feel like the<br/>\n&gt;monk is going to be able to fight better and for longer without downtime<br/>\n&gt;because of his ill gotten gear.  I haven&#39;t seen any &quot;studies&quot; to back up my<br/>\n&gt;feelings, but it just makes sense to me :)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The only time this affects you is if you are competing for the same spawns.<br/>\nAnd if this is the case then that means there aren&#39;t enough spawns in that<br/>\nparticular spot and maybe it&#39;s time to move on.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;And I don&#39;t want to open the &quot;If you want better gear go get it&quot; can of<br/>\n&gt;worms.  I get the best that me and my group can get.  In a group of 10-12<br/>\n&gt;people, we have to balance out quest items - it&#39;s only fair.  So that is not<br/>\n&gt;an option, so to speak.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Maybe you need to go find a better group of people :-).  I&#39;ve been clearing<br/>\nmaybe 30 plat a night since level 23 (4-6 hours of play).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;Simple solution (And I like it no matter what anyone says)  Make gear start<br/>\n&gt;to have a level requirement.  If that &quot;Glowing Baseball cap of Might&quot; comes<br/>\n&gt;from a level 40 MoB, then only a level 35+ can wear it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well since you won&#39;t change your opinion then i guess I won&#39;t even bother<br/>\nto point out the flaws in this.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;I think the thing that bothers me the most about EQ is the money situation.<br/>\n&gt;The greed factor has almost turned it into a UO-type situation.  I realize<br/>\n&gt;this is a total tangent, but how many of you have actually had to turn OFF<br/>\n&gt;the auction channel on a non-bazaar day?  I hate it.  I hate greed.  I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt;level 20 and I have 15 pp to my name.  But that&#39;s just me and I could be<br/>\n&gt;stupid :)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Never played UO.  Hmm, capitalism is based on greed.  I suppose you don&#39;t<br/>\nlike free market economics.  Maybe you&#39;d rather that EQ had a communist<br/>\nform of economics.  Like i said, I have never had money problems.  My main<br/>\ncharacter is a bard, and I was doing merchanting in various zones that weren&#39;t<br/>\nthat close to a town.  Every week or so now, I&#39;m making and blowing thru about<br/>\n300-400 plat.  Level 27 and have 500+ plat in bank currently.  Are you not<br/>\nlooting<br/>\nin your regular group?  Or are you stuck in the mass of campers that is oasis<br/>\nkilling crocs and caimans for no dough?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;Back to the twinking issue, I see one more factor:  My over developed sense<br/>\n&gt;of injustice.  If I had to work so hard to get what I have, what gives Mr.<br/>\n&gt;Twinkee the right to get everything handed to him?  Actually, now that I<br/>\n&gt;think about it, it is the sense of injustice.  Jealousy is just a mitigating<br/>\n&gt;factor :)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Man, that&#39;s life.  That&#39;s part of a free market economy.  There are some<br/>\npeople<br/>\nthat have a lot and some people that don&#39;t.  What gives the Kennedies the<br/>\nright<br/>\nto have a lot of money and all the benefits that go along with that while<br/>\nJoe Blow<br/>\nis working the counter at Mcdonalds?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    GRAB THE GATOR!
