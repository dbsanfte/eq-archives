But,","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1088506006\">Well, I suppose we could start a petition and try to get some stuff<br/>\nimplemented -- the warriors were at a distinct disadvantage to us until the<br/>\npatch. But, there&#39;s more going on then just basic skills -- it&#39;s in how you<br/>\nplay it. Someone else just posted that he&#39;s the last one out in a fight --<br/>\nhe gets his party moving, sticks behind, lets his group get away safely, and<br/>\nfeigns death. This is great and this is how I intend to play it, too.<br/>\nWarriors need to be the masters of armed combat, just as we are the masters<br/>\nof hand-to-hand. And we do have different roles -- we&#39;re not meant to be the<br/>\ndamage sponges. In a pinch, we suffice for that job, but it&#39;s not our<br/>\nprimary role. Our primary job is to be walking Damage Over Time weapons and<br/>\nthat we still do rather well. And, when the inevitable happens and we die,<br/>\nwho&#39;s in worse trouble -- us or a warrior? Take a warrior&#39;s weapons away,<br/>\nand he&#39;s nothing. That cannot be said about us.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, warrior tweaks: More hitpoints -- they need &#39;em -- they&#39;re going to get<br/>\nhit more than us.<br/>\n<br/>\nCritical hit: For me, the jury&#39;s still out -- I&#39;d like to hear from<br/>\nexperience how it goes for a level 30 warrior compared to a level 30 monk as<br/>\nfar as damage done per round on average. Will a warrior consistently do more<br/>\ndamage than us? That&#39;s the real question.<br/>\n<br/>\nMagic Resistance: This one does cheese me off -- why are warriors so much<br/>\nmore deserving of magic resistance than any other melee class? This is an<br/>\nunfair advantage, imho.<br/>\n<br/>\nTaunt would be a lovely skill to have, but maybe they could just make our<br/>\nmagical attacks act more like taunts. We&#39;re never, ever going to be able to<br/>\npull a mob off a caster who&#39;s done a full mana burn -- that&#39;s just the fact.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll in all, I&#39;m still pleased with my monk and I don&#39;t think grouping will<br/>\nbe a problem because your friends aren&#39;t going to be that empiracal about<br/>\nit -- be a good groupie and do your job and you will be loved and sought<br/>\nafter. I&#39;ve never once had anyone say &quot;Gee, Owyn, you&#39;re just a monk. We&#39;ve<br/>\ngot this great warrior to replace you. Sorry, bud.&quot;  Don&#39;t look at it<br/>\nstrictly as Class A is better than Class B -- If you want to solo as a monk<br/>\n(or any other class) you&#39;re going to have a tougher go at it.  Just have fun<br/>\nand when it&#39;s not fun any longer, try something else.<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Aaron Braunstein &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aaron_spam@...\">aaron_spam@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Friday, July 30, 1999 12:32 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ-Monks] Monk Armor and the short end of the stick<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Aaron Braunstein &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aaron_spam@...\">aaron_spam@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;The Grass is Greener Syndrom has landed on us, has it?

I have loved my monk more than any<br/>\n&gt;of the other many classes I played from the moment I started him.  I<br/>\n&gt;knew going in that I wouldn&#39;t be as good as a &#39;classic&#39; tank as would<br/>\n&gt;be a warrior and wouldn&#39;t be able to match them in damage until at<br/>\n&gt;least the upper 20&#39;s.  I didn&#39;t mind this so much and took a kind of<br/>\n&gt;perverse pride in the fact that monks didn&#39;t &#39;mature&#39; until much<br/>\n&gt;later - making them a labor of love and patience.  Well, I&#39;m finally<br/>\n&gt;&#39;mature&#39; (meaning I&#39;ve hit 30 and now have Flying Kick), but it seems<br/>\n&gt;that my hopes for being as valuable a contributor to my party as our<br/>\n&gt;warrior have been undercut.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve always bemoaned the lack of Taunt, because I see it as<br/>\n&gt;one of my primary callings in life - to protect others (especially<br/>\n&gt;those who have dedicated themselves to the healing arts).  Without<br/>\n&gt;such a tool, this has been extremely difficult.  I have consoled<br/>\n&gt;myself with the knowledge that recently I had achieved a rough parity<br/>\n&gt;with our warrior in terms of the ability to put down a creature who<br/>\n&gt;had come up against our group.  We would split duties and assignments<br/>\n&gt;as equals (except in those situations where our individual abilities<br/>\n&gt;dictated otherwise).  Now this parity is no more.<br/>\n&gt; I have no desire to see monks become a &#39;superclass&#39;... if<br/>\n&gt;they were everybody would play them and how much fun would THAT be?<br/>\n&gt;Nor am I looking for the ability to solo.  I vastly prefer group play<br/>\n&gt;and find it to be much more rewarding on a number of levels.<br/>\n&gt;Unfortunately, the benefits which can be brought to a group by monks<br/>\n&gt;have been marginalized by the incredible adjustments made to the<br/>\n&gt;warrior class.  I would just like to see some thought given to giving<br/>\n&gt;monks a greater ability to contribute again, that&#39;s all.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;Aaron Braunstein<br/>\n&gt;Pacific Data Management, Inc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aaron_braunstein@...\">aaron_braunstein@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Congratulations to MICHELLE UNSER<br/>\n&gt;This weekï¿½s FRIENDS&FAMILY WINNER!<br/>\n&gt;To enter go to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html\">http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
