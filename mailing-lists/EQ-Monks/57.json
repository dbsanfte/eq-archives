Feign Death along with Mend are the two biggest<br/>\nadvantages of being a monk in the first place.  First off, take whatever<br/>\ntime you need and do nothing but pound that Feign Death button until you<br/>\nmax the skill out for your level (90 at level 17).  I can GUARANTEE that<br/>\nthis skill WILL save your life repeatedly.  There are a couple of things<br/>\nwhich can increase your likelyhood of success, though.  First, stop<br/>\nattacking your opponent before you try to FD.  Others claim that having low<br/>\nHP as well as having your back turned will help, but my experience does not<br/>\nbear this out.<br/>\n\tI could go on and on about Feign Death (as a matter of fact, I<br/>\nthink I did in a post just last week), but please dont give up on it yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.: If you had a bunch of problems yesterday getting it to work, Verant<br/>\nwas having odd server lag that made a successful FD much more difficult.<br/>\nIt claimed my life more than once.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nAaron Braunstein<br/>\nPacific Data Management, Inc.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aaron_braunstein@...\">aaron_braunstein@...</a>&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
