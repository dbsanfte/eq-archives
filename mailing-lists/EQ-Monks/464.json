I<br/>\nhunt in East Commonlands and therefore tailoring is a<br/>\nsimple skill to use because pelts are so common. <br/>\nHowever, Patchwork has become too easy for me and I<br/>\nhave done some research into Studded Leather.  As most<br/>\nof you know, making studded armor requires studs.  I<br/>\ndo not wish to take the time to make studs because<br/>\nwhat I like most about tailoring is I do not have to<br/>\nspend time doing it, I just kill animals and use their<br/>\npelts.   Does anyone know if it is possible to buy<br/>\nstuds, or anyone on the Karana Server near Freeport<br/>\nwho sells them.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Worlord<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:worlord99@...\">worlord99@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nHammeron<br/>\n11th Circle Monk<br/>\nKarana Server<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nBid and sell for free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://auctions.yahoo.com\">http://auctions.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
