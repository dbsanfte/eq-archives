I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-309793017\">I just finished the quest a couple weeks ago.  The alchemist in Misty<br/>\nThicket, and the goblin captain and gelatinous cube in RunnyEye were all<br/>\npretty easy.  I killed Mooto and the other placeholders about 9 times or so<br/>\nbefore the alchemist spawned in Misty.  Tsin (also on this list) pulled the<br/>\ngoblin captain and cube to the zone for me in Runny, so that only took about<br/>\n15 mins. hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nBUT.. the alchemist in Beholder took me 48 hours to get.  I *think* that it<br/>\nmay NOT spawn if you are in the zone for a long time however.. a few monks<br/>\nI&#39;ve talked to said he spawned within a half hour of them entering the<br/>\nzone.. but previous to that, on other occasions, they had been in the zone<br/>\nfor hours and hours.. one even camped it for 40 hours straight (did it in<br/>\nshifts with someone else).  I got him after being in the zone for about 10<br/>\nmins, finally.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you hate camping, don&#39;t do the quest.  The gloves aren&#39;t all that great.<br/>\nI did the quest just to say I&#39;d done the quest.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Nick Gee&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nick_gee@...\">nick_gee@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ok I think it&#39;s about time for me to hunt the goblin alchemistr in<br/>\n&gt; beholder and do the treant fists quest. ANY information on the quest<br/>\n&gt; at all, spawn rates, lvl&#39;s what they drop and where as well as<br/>\n&gt; anything you think would help me is much appreciated, thanks alot.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Aedir Swiftstriker </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
