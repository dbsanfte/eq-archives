I saw this tip posted on a monk board.<br/>\n<br/>\nOutside of FP, either in East Commons or North Ro, the mountains to the side of the inner zones are great places to train that skill up.  You do not need to take damage, just as long as you make that skipping sound as you descend.<br/>\n<br/>\nFind an almost sheer wall, back up all the way to the top then run down.  Every time you trip, you will up your chances for a skill increase.  Back up to the top, then repeat.  I did this a few nights ago at the FP/NRo wall and managed to get 45 skill increases in about 30 minutes...(now 112)<br/>\n<br/>\nUse caution and make sure you do not jump off the top of the cliff (some have flat spots at the top that you can launch from), I only did this to train my Bind Wound, taking 275 DMG 2 times to lower my HPs (608 total).  If you have less HPs, you could be doomed.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou may even get some odd stares from passers-by like I did; &#39;What&#39;s that Monk doing?&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\n:)<br/>\n<br/>\nSafe training to you Brothers and Sisters.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nEzhar Montenegro<br/>\nProud Member of the Platinum Sphere Guild<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.platinumsphere.com\">http://www.platinumsphere.com</a><br/>\n--</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
