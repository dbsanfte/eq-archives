At lvl 50, I can pull<br/>\n&gt; single <br/>\n&gt; solusek kobolds because some are green, and even when they are low<br/>\n&gt; blue, most <br/>\n&gt; every time, I can just stand and wait for one to see me, then yell and<br/>\n&gt; run at <br/>\n&gt; me, but the other won&#39;t come because I&#39;m too high lvl for them.  So<br/>\n&gt; this is <br/>\n&gt; why your throwing a star or knife at them works on easier mobs, but<br/>\n&gt; not on <br/>\n&gt; the harder ones.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kanja <br/>\n&gt; 50 monk<br/>\n&gt; Rodcet Nife<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>The thing you mention is another interesting method of pulling, when the<br/>\nmobs are all green.  If i&#39;m in upper guk nowadays (level 41), I do<br/>\nsomething different to separate groups that are all green.  Even though<br/>\nthey are green to me, if i stand next to anything tougher than a gaz<br/>\nknight, the mob will attack me within a few seconds.  However, it will<br/>\nnot train others that it runs past as it&#39;s comming to me, like they do<br/>\nif they are blue.  So, I get just close enough to one, so it will<br/>\nattack, but just far enough so the others dont.  Or, just throw a star<br/>\nat any of them from a longer range, and it will come alone.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, what i was talking about doing with using a star to pull from a<br/>\ngroup after they have all aggro&#39;d on me definitely worked on everything,<br/>\nincluding blues, yellows, and reds.  I used the technique to level<br/>\nmyself and my regular group from 17 to 33 or so in upper guk.  Like i<br/>\nsaid though, it doesnt work at all in lower guk as far as I can tell.<br/>\nThe difference is either some kind of effect of the different mobs<br/>\ninvolved, or the fact that since I used the technique months ago, there<br/>\nhas been some kind of patch or change to the way all mobs react.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
