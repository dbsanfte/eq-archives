They are very unreliable<br/>\nand creatures have high resists rate. This was the fact before the changes<br/>\nto the root line of spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have not soloed my wizard since 12 level.  The times you see a wizard root<br/>\nand nuke a creature without the creature breaking free is a rare occurrence.<br/>\nThis is because a creature gets a chance to break free when the spell is<br/>\ncast, and whenever it takes damage.  The root line of spells also get a<br/>\nrandom length of duration.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem with using root is that once the creature breaks free, it will<br/>\nbe pounding on you faster than you can cast any DD spells. For this reason<br/>\nmost solo wizards will lure creatures to the zone line in.<br/>\n<br/>\nAalidar<br/>\n32 level Erudite Wizard<br/>\nRallos Zek<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JnglSkyPWR@...\">JnglSkyPWR@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, October 13, 1999 6:39 AM<br/>\nSubject: [EQ-Monks] Soloing sucks<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JnglSkyPWR@...\">JnglSkyPWR@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Whoever said wizzie can&#39;t solo their way to 50 is sadly mistaken. They can<br/>\ndo<br/>\n&gt; it a lot easier than us monks, it&#39;s called root.  I&#39;ve seen it many times.<br/>\n&gt; But on the main point of this lil rant, soloing sucks.  In more than one<br/>\nway.<br/>\n&gt;  First, it&#39;s boring as hell, you&#39;re all alone with nobody to talk to.<br/>\n&gt; Second, it&#39;s dangerous, you&#39;re in trouble if more than you can handle<br/>\ncomes<br/>\n&gt; along, and when you&#39;re soloing, that&#39;s normally more than one mob, which<br/>\n&gt; happens at the worst times.  Third, you don&#39;t get half of what was<br/>\ndesigned<br/>\n&gt; for this game, a massive MULTIPLAYER game,  that&#39;s what everybody is there<br/>\n&gt; for, to make friends, interact and have fun together, in groups.  Fourth,<br/>\n&gt; when you do make lvl 50, you&#39;ll want good equipment, and for that, you<br/>\nneed<br/>\n&gt; to group.  Well, from personal experience, I really dislike ppl that have<br/>\n&gt; soloed their way up the lvls because they have no clue how to use their<br/>\nchar<br/>\n&gt; in a group.  And it is grossly obvious when a person has done that, I<br/>\nsimply<br/>\n&gt; won&#39;t group with them again.  You NEED to group with ppl to help you out<br/>\n&gt; later on, the &#39;I scratch your back, you scratch mine&#39; deal.  Don&#39;t get me<br/>\n&gt; wrong, once you&#39;ve climbed that ladder it&#39;s fun to go see what you can do<br/>\non<br/>\n&gt; your own, but soloing the whole way does not pay off in the long run.<br/>\nJust<br/>\n&gt; about all the high lvl ppl I know agree with me on this subject and don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; like to group with solos.  Well, I&#39;m done bitchin about soloists.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kanja<br/>\n&gt; 49 monk<br/>\n&gt; Rodcet Nife<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
