What i would like to see:<br/>\n<br/>\nNunchucks   Couple points more than our fists, delay a little longer,<br/>\nobtainable around lvl 25<br/>\n<br/>\nBrass knuck  Maybe as  we are not thugs<br/>\n<br/>\nSai (sp)  We are following the ways of the mind, but we are a martial arts<br/>\ntype of character.  Give them dagger qualities and same delay , only less<br/>\nweight<br/>\n<br/>\nWeight   Either gives us a couple pounds more or make it so we can make our<br/>\nmoney go fron 10 cp to 1 s, 10 s to 1g, 10 g to 1 pp while we are out<br/>\nrunning around.<br/>\n<br/>\ntailoring (not just monk)  give ability to make bandages ( monks best<br/>\nfriends).<br/>\n<br/>\nOur hits should do more damage, maybe not much but am i going to be able to<br/>\nhit for 128 points of damagae with one fist  (not sure on this one cause i<br/>\nhave not attained that lvl sorry).<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t follow the warriors or much of the other classes for that matter,<br/>\nbut a few more skills and some additions throughout the monks life would<br/>\nmake him a better rounded character ( he is already very fun to play).  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think that i out damage to many people in melee yet, that happens<br/>\nsupposedly in our mid range.  But i don&#39;t want to go over the hill and hit<br/>\n50 and be back at the bottom of the melee heap either.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJust 2 cents no rants no flames just having some fun with<br/>\n<br/>\nShoalin on TZ</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
