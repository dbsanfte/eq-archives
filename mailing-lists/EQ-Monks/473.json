Buff <br/>\n(Clarity and Augmentation anyone?), Debuff (obvious), Travel (Illusions, <br/>\nInvis, Enduring Breath, Lev, etc.... ). Wizzies have duel roles too. They <br/>\nare bar none the best damage dealers and the best for getting a group out <br/>\nof a sticking situation (Evacs). The only class that I can think of that <br/>\nDOESN&#39;T have more than one role in a group is a Warrior. They are Tanks <br/>\nonly. They don&#39;t do anything else well (and sometimes they don&#39;t even Tank <br/>\nwell).<br/>\n<br/>\n         Second, Enchanters are the best pullers in the game hands down. <br/>\nThey RARELY perform this function, but they can do it better and safer than <br/>\nanyone else. Watch an Enchanter Lull all the Mobs and then pull the one <br/>\nthey want (and ONLY the one they want) back to the group. Plus, if they do <br/>\npull too many, they just Mez everything and continue pulling the single <br/>\nthey wanted. Once you have seen an Enchanter do this you will gain a new <br/>\nlevel of respect. Monks are the second best pullers though.   :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTorg - 18th Circle<br/>\nE&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
