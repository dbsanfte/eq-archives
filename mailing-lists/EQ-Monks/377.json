After all, we&#39;re supposed to have turned our bodies into living<br/>\n&gt;weapons.  :)  Some items that give big increases to Dodge, or Block (Gloves<br/>\n&gt;or Bracers of Blocking, perhaps?) would be much more appropriate to the way<br/>\n&gt;I feel the class should be.  No flashy magics.  Perhaps a Jump ability<br/>\n&gt;enabling you to jump across distances, or reach higher things.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I recently sold all of my items (Raean,18th level monk on Tunare) and am<br/>\n&gt;going to be hanging around Freeport helping newbies out when I want to take<br/>\n&gt;a break from my other characters.  I just got too bored.  I already had full<br/>\n&gt;mesh with a Lockjaw Tunic. I was pretty much set until I could get into Fear<br/>\n&gt;and get shiverback (silverback?) armor, didn&#39;t have a regular group, and had<br/>\n&gt;trouble finding ones all the time, so I was forced to solo.  Just got<br/>\n&gt;disillusioned with being a Monk.  I loved being able to dish out damage, and<br/>\n&gt;not needing to spend a billion platinum to get things, but it&#39;d be nice to<br/>\n&gt;get some &quot;cool stuff&quot; during the next 30 levels, besides new jewelry.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Just my two cents.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hello Fellow Monks,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It is me again. This bit just gave me an idea. How about Monk<br/>\nspecialization? something like pick a new skill such  as &quot;Fists like<br/>\nStone&quot;, or &quot;Bending Reed&quot;, which might seriously add to dodging. So fists<br/>\nof stone would dish out harder hits when the skill increases and bending<br/>\nreed might seriously cut on the damage and add to the swiftness and agility<br/>\nof Monks. But make it a choose one or the other type of special skill.<br/>\nPerhaps give us three or four skills to choose from. How about that? :o)<br/>\nQuan of Tribunal<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Congratulations to Susan Davis!<br/>\n&gt;ONElistï¿½s final FRIENDS&FAMILY WINNER! <br/>\n&gt;Stay tuned for exciting new contests, sweepstakes & more at ONElist!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
