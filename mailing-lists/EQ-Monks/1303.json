Atleast with my Chest armor.  If I wanted a neet peice <br/>\nof stat item in my chest area, I would agree, fact is, I like the way my <br/>\nmonk looks with this.  The reason I think it makes me look like a monk, is <br/>\nbecause with that Gi, i am able to show the nice tattoo on my belly.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nShelza, 18th, Karana<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Worlord &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:worlord@...\">worlord@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [EQ-Monks] Re: What to buy?<br/>\n&gt;Date: Sat, 05 Feb 2000 10:23:27 -0500<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Cured silk makes you look like a monk?  I would have to disagree, what<br/>\n&gt;makes us look like monks are the fact that we look like newbies.  I<br/>\n&gt;personally much prefer foreman&#39;s tunic.

Ok, so it looks leather<br/>\n&gt;but who cares.  Once you get to 30 you won&#39;t wear anything that looks<br/>\n&gt;like cured silk.
