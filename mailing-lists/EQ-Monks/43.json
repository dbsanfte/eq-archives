My questions:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. What is final word on starting Str and Agil? How much in each? If you <br/>\nhigher up guys could go back and re-do it what would you pick?<br/>\n2. Is there any trade skill that I should concentrate on that would be a big <br/>\nbenifit to my guy for money etc?<br/>\n<br/>\nAny advice or other tips would be appreciated - I definately do not want to <br/>\nrun another up levels again.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
