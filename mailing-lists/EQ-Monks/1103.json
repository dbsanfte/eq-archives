Things are costing<br/>\nless.  There will be a point where steins of moggock will cost 25 PP, and<br/>\nevery newbie will have em.  Mesh and cured silk will be available to<br/>\neveryone.  It doesn&#39;t have the get/lose/restock economy that UO has.   It&#39;s<br/>\nget, keep, never lose, accumulate....  So forth.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Verant continues to nerf the classes, to &quot;Balance&quot; them.  They are doing<br/>\na peice of shit job of it.  If they keep going at this rate, all of the<br/>\nclasses will be especially weak, fighting especially strong monsters.  Sure,<br/>\nthis will be a challenge, but there comes to be a point where it gets<br/>\nludicrous.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know this sounds rather silly, but seriously look at how the game started,<br/>\nand how it is now?<br/>\n<br/>\n   Where are the differences?  How have they changed?  How have they changed<br/>\nmore towards my predictions?  I saw a moggock stein for 900 pp one day.  A<br/>\nmonth later it was 255pp</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
