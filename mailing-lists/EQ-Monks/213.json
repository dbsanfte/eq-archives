The other two heads come<br/>\nfrom Ghanex Drah who is a normal spawn, and the third comes from killing<br/>\nHigh Shaman Grisok who is a random spawn for Shaman Lenrel...<br/>\nI got Ghanex Drah&#39;s head easily, it took around 7 hours (non-consecitvly) of<br/>\nfighting till I got the other two heads, as a coincidence both Grisok and<br/>\nPhido spawned at the same time (was killing all three in a circle)<br/>\n<br/>\nWade<br/>\nSolusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Dave Woomer [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dwoomer@...\">dwoomer@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, August 18, 1999 5:34 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [EQ-Monks] Red Headband Quest<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Dave Woomer&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dwoomer@...\">dwoomer@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHello, brothers and sisters...<br/>\n<br/>\nJust spent a long, frustrating night in Paw trying to get the head of Dareb.<br/>\nI&#39;ve heard you get this item from High Shaman Phido, who is a rare spawn,<br/>\nwho shows up in place of Shaman Ren&#39;Rexx on occasion. Well, I killed Ren&#39;Rex<br/>\nso many times I started feeling sorry for him &lt;g&gt;.  Does anyone know who to<br/>\nget the head of Dareb?
