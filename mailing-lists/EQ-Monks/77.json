I<br/>\nSH&gt; can&#39;t believe this nonsense about the super low weight unless you are<br/>\nSH&gt; talking about encumbering weight. I know monks are su<br/>\n<br/>\n8&lt; 8&lt; 8&lt; 8&lt; 8&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nLaf, ok, try this, then. Go to the bank, and deposit all your money,<br/>\nand enough things untill you are carrying just 15. Exit bank, and<br/>\ncheck your ac. Now, enter bank again, change 1 pp to coppers, and put<br/>\nthem in your inventory. Go out of bank, and check your weight. It<br/>\nshould be well above 20. Check your AC. Any difference? I think so.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a substacial difference from 15 to 20. I think its somewhere<br/>\nin the range of 20 to 40 ac, at my level. That DO mean alot. Its like wearing an<br/>\nextra lockjaw vest, heh. Perhaps the difference is not that big around<br/>\nyour level, but I do know that I allways have teammates carry my loot,<br/>\nand split my silvers and coppers with the party, or simply destroy<br/>\nthem, if they take my weight above 15.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrust me. It is there. And of cause you cant check if your AC gets<br/>\nbetter by taking a piece of armor off. Besides, you should really try<br/>\nto get your hands on some lighter armor. Patchwork weights like hell.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--Laintal Novacek, the Drunken Monk of Povar, Baron of the Order of the<br/>\nDragon Fire, Master Smith, Journeyman Gemcutter and Linguistic Student.<br/>\n<br/>\n(beat the title, hehe)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
