Strength does indeed affect damage<br/>\ndone, as it directly effects one&#39;s attack rating. More strength means higher<br/>\nattack. Higher attack means more hits. More hits means more damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for AC/MR/HP. PERIOD.... well... I would say you are mistaken here as<br/>\nwell. It is certainly an optimum combination for some situations, but<br/>\ndefinitely not for all situations. Lets take fighting Seafuies as an<br/>\nexample. Why sacrifice Agi for MR when AGI will increase your AC (however<br/>\nminutely)and Seafuries do not cast (aside from the named one who only casts<br/>\nmana drain)? And if I am going to be pulling Tola (lvl 60 enchanter in<br/>\nSebelis) like I was last night, you get better believe I am going to break<br/>\nout the MR gear over the AC gear I was using against the Jugs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only thing that remains unanimous is that AC is king... in most<br/>\nsituations. From there the line gets blurred due to differing fighting<br/>\nstyles, group composition, combat situations, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nPraelor Dileasai<br/>\nSterling Order of Knights<br/>\nFennin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: John Carney [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jcarney@...\">jcarney@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, September 07, 2000 1:19 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@egroups.com\">EQ-Monks@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [EQ-Monks] Crescent Armor<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nExcept for the fact that STR has nothing to do with damage done, this is a<br/>\nfine idea......<br/>\n<br/>\nThere have been a HUGE amount of studies on what affects combat, and for<br/>\nmonks the answer is effectively NOTHING.

For soloing, you want AC and<br/>\nresistances first, then str etc.  When you&#39;re in a group with good<br/>\ntanks/healers, you want strength first.  The reasoning behind this is<br/>\nsimple.  When soloing, you want to make it as hard as possible for them to<br/>\nhurt you.  When in a group, you can concentrate on damage rather than<br/>\ndefense since you won&#39;t be taking the hits if there are decent tanks in the<br/>\ngroup.<br/>\nMy defense gear includes things like ac rings/earrings, symbols of loyalty<br/>\nto vox, etc, all as light as possible.  My offense gear is strength<br/>\nrings/earrings, hero/erollisi bracers, etc.  Yes, it puts me over my weight<br/>\nlimit (the hero bracer is 4 weight all by itself), but it&#39;s not really a<br/>\nconcern if I&#39;m not getting hit.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: David Frascone<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq-monks@egroups.com\">eq-monks@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Thursday, September 07, 2000 8:45 AM<br/>\nSubject: [EQ-Monks] Crescent Armor<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I&#39;ve been fighting in Dalnir&#39;s for a while now (about two weeks, off<br/>\nand on), and yesterday, I stumbeled upon THREE pieces of Crescent:  Gi,<br/>\narms,<br/>\nand slippers.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe slipers are a no-brainer, since I had been wearing cured silk.
