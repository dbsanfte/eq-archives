Do not allow the frivolties of other<br/>\nclasses of adventures to cloud your mind and burden your body. Keep that one<br/>\nitem that affords you the greatest defense; a strong leather tunic will guard<br/>\nyour vital organs well.  You will soon find a way to exchange it for a<br/>\nsturdier<br/>\nyet lighter mesh garment. Your bracers of mesh also provide you with strong<br/>\ndefense and add little to encumber your flow, so it may be to your<br/>\nadvantage to<br/>\nretain those on your person.  Soon, you may find it in your interest to locate<br/>\na jewler capable of crafting enchanted pieces to accelerate your innate<br/>\nabilities; smaller such items can be had for only a few of your platinum<br/>\npieces, and may be well worth the expense.  Do keep an eye out for traveling<br/>\nmerchants, and be not afraid to ask them how their jewels might help you.<br/>\n<br/>\nMay Quellious guide you,<br/>\n<br/>\nManjushri<br/>\nMonk of the 10th Order, Disciple of Quellious, the Tranquil<br/>\n(Fennin Ro)<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 02:56 PM 8/24/99 +0000, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Xurlus@...\">Xurlus@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hail all, I am a relatively new member of the EverQuest family.On the E&#39;Chi<br/>\n </span></blockquote>world I just reached 8th lvl, moments ago actualy, And have many Q&#39;s regarding<br/>\nthe intricacies of playing the ever loved Monk.
