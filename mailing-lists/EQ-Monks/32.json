Monks really do have the p*** taken out of them<br/>\nbecause everyone knows they need netted armour and upwards, but I have to<br/>\nsay that I am yet to meet a fellow monk that shares the same thoughts. I<br/>\nmanaged to get myself a full set of netted from a troll for 4pp al that was<br/>\nmissing was the gloves .. which I expected to pay up to 2pp for, even though<br/>\nI begrudge paying it .. Imagine my supprise when I auctioned for a pair and<br/>\na fellow monk offered me some for &quot;Oh the least I will take is 10pp&quot; .. this<br/>\nwas on Erollisi Marr server<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps an all monk guild would address this problem?<br/>\n<br/>\nMasafumi<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Aaron Braunstein &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aaron_spam@...\">aaron_spam@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m planning on making a run into Upper Guk tonight and am at a<br/>\n&gt;loss as far as finding maps of this region go.
