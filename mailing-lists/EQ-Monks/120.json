I was just starting to get rid of my leather armor for light patchwork or maybe just spend all my money on netted when I saw a monk wearing leather. When I asked him he said that weight doesn&#39;t matter at all for monks. Now, I usually have more weight than 14 and I find myself missing more then my other less bulbous monk counterparts. So, what&#39;s the truth does weight matter for us? <br/>\n    <br/>\n    I also was wondering, does ac and atk mean the damage we take and do, or the chance we have to get hit or hit. Thanks for your time all.<br/>\n    <br/>\n    -Blizzard</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
