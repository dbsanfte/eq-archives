I have been <br/>\ntrying to find some ever since I got to level 8 (now I&#39;m level 11) and still <br/>\nhave not found anything other than a mesh collar (whoop te do) What&#39;s up <br/>\nwith mesh? Why is there not enough of it? Must it be made or does it spawn <br/>\non certain NPC&#39;s? I&#39;m wondering why I never see any vendors carry any mesh <br/>\nitems. Perhaps this is something I need to take up with Verant?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nDerek Wilson<br/>\naka Spider-X<br/>\n<br/>\nLinchao &lt;Coalition of Fists&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
