LOL. Seriously, I prob wouldnt try it <br/>\nuntil atleast you havw 200+hp, I bound in grobb and NEVER had a problem <br/>\ngetting out or killed. Sometimes I would get wacked for 96 twice but no <br/>\nmore, I NEVER TOOK OVER 200pts at 12th level in dmg. At 7th though he might <br/>\ndeal you 150 a pop though. I dontn lie, it is dangerous, but I can testify <br/>\nat 12th and up it isnt a prob. Both of my monk brothers ae bound in grobb <br/>\nand neither has had a problem getting out either. Its a game, take a <br/>\nchance!, bind in GROBB, but never ever piss off a shin shaman, it&#39;s <br/>\nhumiliating being rooted and beat down!!!!!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
