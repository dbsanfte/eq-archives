Why? Because of her debuffs. The only 2 buffs she ever<br/>\n&gt;casts on me are Alacrity and Cloud (weaker versions of Clarity and<br/>\n&gt;Augmentation I believe. Please correct me if I am wrong.) I don&#39;t know the<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Alacrity (lvl 24) is a speed buff. Increases attack speed by 122 - 144<br/>\nCloud (lvl 20) is a +14AC bonus<br/>\n<br/>\nClarity (lvl 29) increases Mana regeneration by 15% - 50%<br/>\nAugmentation (lvl 29) has the following effects:<br/>\n         Increase Attack Speed +115<br/>\n         Increase AC +22<br/>\n         Increase Agility + 22<br/>\n<br/>\n         In all honesty, there isn&#39;t much else she can give you besides a <br/>\n+10 Str buff and maybe a damage shield. The damage shields available at lvl <br/>\n24 are not really worth it. Mana is better spent elsewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;As for their Travel spells, illusion is self only, invis from any class is<br/>\n&gt;finicky at best (I find camo and superior camo to be more reliable), and I<br/>\n&gt;am not aware that they get Enduring Breath and Levitate. I do know that my<br/>\n&gt;partner, a lvl 27 enchanter, has never cast either one on me, so perhaps it<br/>\n&gt;is a higher level spell. Again, please correct me if I am mistaken.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>         Lev is gained at lvl 16 and Enduring Breath is gained at lvl 12. <br/>\nIllusions are self only, but they are helpful when you need to buy or sell <br/>\nfrom/to vendors. Enchanters seem to get the best prices in foreign <br/>\ncities.   :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I think we have it pretty damn good, and<br/>\n&gt;personally don&#39;t see a need for gloves that proc or nunchukas that stun or<br/>\n&gt;anything else for that matter.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>         Actually Monks are in desperate need of a Stun effect. Considering <br/>\nthe LOW MR that we have naturally, we are toast when fighting even a green <br/>\nspellcasting Mob. EVERY other Melee class has the ability to Stun or <br/>\nInterrupt spellcasting. Monks are very deficient in this area and it does <br/>\naffect balance in my opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I stick by my assertion that the<br/>\n&gt;two most important things you can do when in a group situation is to 1)<br/>\n&gt;Communicate efficiently and 2) know the strengths and weaknesses of your<br/>\n&gt;class and play within your strengths.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>         Even more important is know the Strengths and Limitations of the <br/>\nOTHER classes in your group. Know what they can and can&#39;t do and you will <br/>\nbe able to save yourself and your group a lot of traveling to get corpses. <br/>\nThis is especially true if you are the puller for your group.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
