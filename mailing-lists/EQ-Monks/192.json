It&#39;s all been said:<br/>\n&gt;No one class is best -- that&#39; why we group. I&#39;ve put a lot of time in other<br/>\n&gt;classes, but so far, I like being a monk best of all.

If you&#39;re unhappy, role another character,<br/>\n&gt;but remember that no one class is really best at soloing -- some are better<br/>\n&gt;than others, but all in all, I think we (monks) have a pretty well balanced,<br/>\n&gt;kick ass class.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>\tMy feelings are similar.  I have loved my monk more than any <br/>\nof the other many classes I played from the moment I started him.  I <br/>\nknew going in that I wouldn&#39;t be as good as a &#39;classic&#39; tank as would <br/>\nbe a warrior and wouldn&#39;t be able to match them in damage until at <br/>\nleast the upper 20&#39;s.  I didn&#39;t mind this so much and took a kind of <br/>\nperverse pride in the fact that monks didn&#39;t &#39;mature&#39; until much <br/>\nlater - making them a labor of love and patience.  Well, I&#39;m finally <br/>\n&#39;mature&#39; (meaning I&#39;ve hit 30 and now have Flying Kick), but it seems <br/>\nthat my hopes for being as valuable a contributor to my party as our <br/>\nwarrior have been undercut.<br/>\n\tI&#39;ve always bemoaned the lack of Taunt, because I see it as <br/>\none of my primary callings in life - to protect others (especially <br/>\nthose who have dedicated themselves to the healing arts).  Without <br/>\nsuch a tool, this has been extremely difficult.  I have consoled <br/>\nmyself with the knowledge that recently I had achieved a rough parity <br/>\nwith our warrior in terms of the ability to put down a creature who <br/>\nhad come up against our group.  We would split duties and assignments <br/>\nas equals (except in those situations where our individual abilities <br/>\ndictated otherwise).  Now this parity is no more.<br/>\n\tI have no desire to see monks become a &#39;superclass&#39;... if <br/>\nthey were everybody would play them and how much fun would THAT be? <br/>\nNor am I looking for the ability to solo.  I vastly prefer group play <br/>\nand find it to be much more rewarding on a number of levels. <br/>\nUnfortunately, the benefits which can be brought to a group by monks <br/>\nhave been marginalized by the incredible adjustments made to the <br/>\nwarrior class.  I would just like to see some thought given to giving <br/>\nmonks a greater ability to contribute again, that&#39;s all.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nAaron Braunstein<br/>\nPacific Data Management, Inc.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aaron_braunstein@...\">aaron_braunstein@...</a>&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
