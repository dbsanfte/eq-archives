I&#39;ve been racking my brains trying to<br/>\nfigure out why it is that FD fails to stop an aggressor&#39;s attacks even when<br/>\nno &quot;xxx has fallen to the ground&quot; message.  Clearly, it has failed but we<br/>\nhave no indication of this other than the fact that we&#39;re still getting<br/>\npounded.  Some of my thoughts on the subject are these, any modifications<br/>\nto this list would be well appreciated:<br/>\n<br/>\n1 - Feigning when mobs are frenzied on you has a dramatically higher rate<br/>\nof failure than against non-frenzied mobs.<br/>\n<br/>\n2 - Feigning &#39;mid-attack&#39; seems to fail more frequently.  Perhaps it goes<br/>\nsomething like this:<br/>\n<br/>\na) Mob starts his swing<br/>\nb) Feign performed (no message of failure)<br/>\nc) I stob being the mob&#39;s current target<br/>\nd) Blow lands, re-instating me as the current target<br/>\ne) Mob keeps pounding on current target (me).<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI don&#39;t know if this is really what happens or not, but it would<br/>\nfit with the previous poster&#39;s &#39;wait until the caster has done his thing&#39;<br/>\nsuggestion.  Also, have you noticed that after you kill a mob, you still<br/>\nsometimes take a swing and occasionally see a damage message AFTER the<br/>\nthing has died?  Perhaps this is an artifact of the above sequence.<br/>\n<br/>\n3 - Still not sure whether or not stopping your attack before feigning<br/>\naffects things except perhaps exacerbating the situation outlined in #2.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWell?<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nAaron Braunstein<br/>\nPacific Data Management, Inc.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aaron_braunstein@...\">aaron_braunstein@...</a>&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
