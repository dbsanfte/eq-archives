A good place with few aggro mobs for probably 20 - 25 is East <br/>\nKarana, near either the entrance to the gorge, or the road to hph.  You can <br/>\nkill gorge hounds, and if you get one or 2 others, crag spiders which are <br/>\ngreat exp.  My 22 ranger gets a bubble from less than 10 crags (soloing with <br/>\nsnare/archery, takes a LOT of arrows).  They are usually about lvl 20 or 21.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust stay away from the griffawns, even the ones that con green.  They&#39;ll <br/>\ntear you up quick with double attack that hits for 40&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nRyugen<br/>\nBertoxxulous<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Dave Gaines &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dave@...\">dave@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [EQ-Monks] Level 20-30 solo?<br/>\n&gt;Date: Wed, 15 Sep 1999 15:14:18 -0400 (EDT)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: Dave Gaines &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dave@...\">dave@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I can solo blues fairly easily.  However, I need to find a place that<br/>\n&gt;has a good spawn rate of them, close to a general merchant, and some<br/>\n&gt;place that isn&#39;t overly camped.  I could stay in the oasis and solo<br/>\n&gt;blues easily.  But it is way overcamped to be good.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Personally, I think trying to solo in a dungeon is not the right way to<br/>\n&gt;go about it.  You should instead find a place with non aggs or aggs spread<br/>\n&gt;out enough that you can pick one off safely and safely kill it without<br/>\n&gt;worrying about all the other creatures roaming about.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Jeffrey Sue &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jsue@...\">jsue@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I know this is gonna sound sarcastic with no tone being able to be <br/>\n&gt;conveyed,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; but try not to look at it this way.  The game was designed for groups.  <br/>\n&gt;Once<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you hit a certain level (different for different classes) it&#39;s just <br/>\n&gt;almost<br/>\n&gt; &gt; impossible<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to solo.  I know for my bard, he sucked at soloing from about 20-25 in <br/>\n&gt;unrest,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; but now at 27 i am able to solo blues again, thanks to fear song and <br/>\n&gt;chains<br/>\n&gt; &gt; song.  (This is the part that will sound nasty, but i really don&#39;t mean <br/>\n&gt;it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that way)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; If you only have 10 or 15 minutes I would suggest just playing some <br/>\n&gt;other<br/>\n&gt; &gt; non eq game of which there are many good ones.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; At 02:24 PM 9/15/1999 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;From: Dave Gaines &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dave@...\">dave@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Hi everyone, I&#39;m new to the list, but my monk has hit level 20, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;has decided he has killed enough crocodiles.  I&#39;m looking for some<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;place that I could solo from level 20-30 and maybe a place that even<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;gives good monk loot.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Also, what kind of armor should I be looking for?
