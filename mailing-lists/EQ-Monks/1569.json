I know<br/>\nbecause I got my Troll SK who worships Innoruuk (the absolutely most hated<br/>\ncombo) to kindly with the vendors in Qeynos and amiable ot the guards.  It<br/>\ncan be done and just takes a lot of patience.<br/>\n<br/>\nAstur il&#39;Ayan, Cleric of Brell<br/>\nSCARAB on Solusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Jeremy Caswell [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:moghedan@...\">moghedan@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Friday, April 28, 2000 2:04 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@egroups.com\">EQ-Monks@egroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [EQ-Monks] Digest Number 196<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; FOR THE LEARNING IMPAIRED:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; EVERYONE has a level cap on swimming.  On Iksar, you get 100<br/>\n&gt; as the base,<br/>\n&gt; rather than 0 as the base as with every other race on Norrath.  The<br/>\n&gt; Progression remains the same, 5 for ever level.  Meaning a<br/>\n&gt; Level 5 human can<br/>\n&gt; reach 25 swimming skill, BUT a level 5 iksar can reach 125 skill.<br/>\n&gt; The only skills without level caps are the trade skills<br/>\n&gt; (Fishing has a cap<br/>\n&gt; though).<br/>\n&gt; Humans get no XP bonus, general consensus is that Error in<br/>\n&gt; coding gave bonus<br/>\n&gt; to Halflings.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Iksar have massive disadvantages to counter their strengths.<br/>\n&gt; \tTrolls have a 15% RACIAL XP penalty.  The previous quoter was<br/>\n&gt; mistaken.  25% is the penalty for troll (15%) and Shadowknight (10%)<br/>\n&gt; \tIksar have a 20% Racial.<br/>\n&gt; \tAn error allowed the Iksar to be non KOS is a few places... This<br/>\n&gt; error was changed on 4/28.  Iksar are now KOS to everything,<br/>\n&gt; even vendors.<br/>\n&gt; I am not sure if this is Threateningly or true Scowls KOS.<br/>\n&gt; If it is Scowls,<br/>\n&gt; then there is no way for them to increase that faction.  As<br/>\n&gt; it is now, there<br/>\n&gt; is only one zone in Antonica that Iksar can be bound, Arena.<br/>\n&gt; Only one in<br/>\n&gt; Feydwer, G. Feydark.  And unless something new has been<br/>\n&gt; found, Kunark has<br/>\n&gt; only one, Cabilis ( actually more than one zone, but the difference is<br/>\n&gt; negligible ).<br/>\n&gt; \tIksar monks lose most of the Natural Haste of Human Monks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Iksar will be powerful monks, and powerful in any class save<br/>\n&gt; SK (smaller<br/>\n&gt; size only advantage, but countered with lack of slam/front<br/>\n&gt; stunable), but<br/>\n&gt; Iksar will not be replacing any of the other races, even Iksar monks. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
