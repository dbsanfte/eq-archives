I am also<br/>\n&gt; sometimes<br/>\n&gt; guilty of duel weilding combine warhammers (7.3 WT). Typically I group<br/>\n&gt; with a<br/>\n&gt; warrior and a ranger along with casters, so I rarely take hits and can<br/>\n&gt; afford<br/>\n&gt; the over 20 weight. I hope to replace them soon with Black Enamelled<br/>\n&gt; Maces<br/>\n&gt; which will shed about six stones of weight. Nothing else on my person<br/>\n&gt; weighs<br/>\n&gt; much more than 0.1 with the exception of a Bracer of Erolissi (1.0 WT)<br/>\n&gt; and a<br/>\n&gt; Serpentine Bracer (0.8 WT).
