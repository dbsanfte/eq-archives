I got most of it in the first night. The last 2 nights<br/>\n1 bracer dropped and I let the other monk who was there have it. In the<br/>\ntimes I missed, I heard of 2 jerkins and 1 pair of boots dropping.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnly 1 bracer, a jerkin and boots to go. And infact I only want the<br/>\nboots.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow common are the boots usually ? (weren&#39;t very common this last week<br/>\n;p).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat parts drop off of chests in hate ?<br/>\nDo the boots drop off phobos ?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
