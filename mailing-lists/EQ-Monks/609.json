These are all words and phrases that bother me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I&#39;m going to throw up all over my cloth shoes. I have a some twinked<br/>\nitems, no doubt about it. Among my favorites are the Serp Braces given to me by<br/>\na dear real life friend when I first broke level ten.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo not presume to tell me how to enjoy MY game paid for with MY MONEY. If your<br/>\nidea of fun is waiting around, camping out a certain area for some piece of<br/>\nequipment, be my guest, but DO NOT ASSUME everyone else has that same sense of<br/>\nfun.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do not, and never will attach any amount of significance to the acquisition of<br/>\nitems THAT ARE NOT REAL. If I could play this game naked, without any inventory<br/>\nat all, I would. This is one of the reasons I choose the Monk class. I detest<br/>\nthe idea of running all over the universe begging to group with some other<br/>\nplayers, using each other to just get a new piece of armor. If I were forced to<br/>\ndo that, I would not be &quot;around too much longer&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs it stands now, I am having the most fun leveling my monk, attempting to reach<br/>\na point in the game where I can adventure with my friends who purchased the game<br/>\ntwo or three months before I did. I want to play with them, sitting in their<br/>\noffice till 3 am, playing on their T1, drinking beer, while we all are gaming<br/>\nTogether, not merely on the same server.<br/>\n<br/>\nStonedorn - Xegony - 15th Oval<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nJohn M.

That would solve a lot of those<br/>\n&gt; problems, but in my real opinion, I just really love this game, it may be<br/>\n&gt; because I am still so new, haven&#39;t even got past my first month and my 19th<br/>\n&gt; (almost 20th Level) Monk is my pride and joy. I really enjoy when people<br/>\n&gt; look at my gear and say nice spread, I worked damn hard for my stuff and it<br/>\n&gt; is my own personnel satisfaction I get from my character. If I see someone<br/>\n&gt; else who is twinked, I think that&#39;s good for them, I hope they enjoy that<br/>\n&gt; because I know they will enjoyment of the game for they have nothing to look<br/>\n&gt; forward too, so those people won&#39;t be around too much longer.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kaladiel<br/>\n&gt; 19th Season<br/>\n&gt; Brell Serilius<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Bennett, Brian [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:BRIAN.BENNETT@...\">BRIAN.BENNETT@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, September 15, 1999 6:04 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [EQ-Monks] Twinking thoughts, continued<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Bennett, Brian&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:BRIAN.BENNETT@...\">BRIAN.BENNETT@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have to agree with Praelor.  I don&#39;t know *why* twinking bothers me.  I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t deny it is perhaps partial jealousy.  Hell yes I would like level 40+<br/>\n&gt; armor to start out with!  I&#39;m level 20 and I&#39;d take it now!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But I think what really gets me is the unfair (And it is) advantage that the<br/>\n&gt; twinkers get over a non-twinked same level person.  Now perhaps that the<br/>\n&gt; advantage is more of a psycological thing.. i.e. I *think* they have a<br/>\n&gt; better chance than me.  But I feel that if I&#39;m standing beside a level 20<br/>\n&gt; monk with high level gear and me with my low level gear, I feel like the<br/>\n&gt; monk is going to be able to fight better and for longer without downtime<br/>\n&gt; because of his ill gotten gear.  I haven&#39;t seen any &quot;studies&quot; to back up my<br/>\n&gt; feelings, but it just makes sense to me :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And I don&#39;t want to open the &quot;If you want better gear go get it&quot; can of<br/>\n&gt; worms.  I get the best that me and my group can get.  In a group of 10-12<br/>\n&gt; people, we have to balance out quest items - it&#39;s only fair.  So that is not<br/>\n&gt; an option, so to speak.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Simple solution (And I like it no matter what anyone says)  Make gear start<br/>\n&gt; to have a level requirement.  If that &quot;Glowing Baseball cap of Might&quot; comes<br/>\n&gt; from a level 40 MoB, then only a level 35+ can wear it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think the thing that bothers me the most about EQ is the money situation.<br/>\n&gt; The greed factor has almost turned it into a UO-type situation.  I realize<br/>\n&gt; this is a total tangent, but how many of you have actually had to turn OFF<br/>\n&gt; the auction channel on a non-bazaar day?  I hate it.  I hate greed.  I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; level 20 and I have 15 pp to my name.  But that&#39;s just me and I could be<br/>\n&gt; stupid :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Back to the twinking issue, I see one more factor:  My over developed sense<br/>\n&gt; of injustice.  If I had to work so hard to get what I have, what gives Mr.<br/>\n&gt; Twinkee the right to get everything handed to him?  Actually, now that I<br/>\n&gt; think about it, it is the sense of injustice.  Jealousy is just a mitigating<br/>\n&gt; factor :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     GRAB THE GATOR!
