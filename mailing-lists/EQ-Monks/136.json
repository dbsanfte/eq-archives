I think monks really just start to come out around lvl 25.  Seems <br/>\nlike I quadruple hit about every 5 attacks, if it&#39;s a good one, each punch is <br/>\nover 20, plus a flying kick for around 50.  I have a friend who is 35, his <br/>\nmax dmg on a punch is close to 35 and can kick around 80.  Not to mention any <br/>\nduel with a fighter type is really easy, just disarm them, they can&#39;t do <br/>\nanything.  I&#39;ve seen one warrior able to do as much/more dmg than me a lvl <br/>\nabove me, but that&#39;s because he had an executioner&#39;s axe which is very rare.  <br/>\nSo keep fighting and you&#39;ll be able to see how we kick ass.  Oh, our hands <br/>\nalso become magical at 30, so you don&#39;t need to worry about netted/woven/mesh <br/>\ngloves, go for ones with bonuses to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nKanja Dragonfist<br/>\nRodcet Nife</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
