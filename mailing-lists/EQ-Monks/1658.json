Now i can move nearly safely trough all Freeport. Sure i have to \n  avoid the caster guild and the paladins LOL</font></div>\n  <div>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">But now i have a problem. I am dubious to the \n  Ashen Order (the Monks) and when sneaking indiff. I collected 60 times the \n  stuff for the white sash quest to increase faction with them, so that i can \n  train mz skills in Freeport too.<br>I got wolfform from a friend and was \n  indiff to them (no increasing when sneaking) and handed two deathfist scalps, \n  one bone chip and one snake fang (the scalps not stacked) and all i recieve as \n  answer was <br>&quot;i will not support anything like you&quot; (or something like that, \n  cant remeber exact)<br>How can i increase mz faction with them instead of \n  camping more and more orcs. I have read it should work with wolfform and the \n  white sash quest.<br>If you could please help me or give me some advice i \n  would really appreciate that</font></div>\n  <div>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Thanxs and greetings<br>Yuanshih<br>Level 18 \n  Iksar Monk</font></div></font></div></blockquote></span></blockquote></html> \n</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
