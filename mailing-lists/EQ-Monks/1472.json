But I&#39;ve already spent a while camping<br/>\nhim. He&#39;s meant to span every 72-80 minutes? cause I&#39;d NEVER seen him<br/>\nand i&#39;ve spent a couple of lvl&#39;s in there from 16-18 and now a while<br/>\nthere and he never seems to spawn! Also when you kill him does he<br/>\ndrop the humerus handled mace every time?<br/>\nWhat about the other mobs? Can you provide information for them liek<br/>\nthe where they spawn and the times and lvl&#39;s etc? Cause I haven&#39;t<br/>\nspent much time in misty or runneyeye. <br/>\nThanks again in advance,<br/>\n<br/>\nAedir Swiftstriker</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
