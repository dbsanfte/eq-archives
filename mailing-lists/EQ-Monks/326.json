The Qeynos monk&#39;s faction with them is usually<br/>\n&gt; too low to allow him to begin the quests. There are several quests in<br/>\n&gt; Qeynos that will allow a Freeport monk to increase their faction with<br/>\n&gt; the Silent Fist, but no such quests (that I&#39;m aware of) in Freeport to<br/>\n&gt; increase faction with the Ashen Order.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Workarounds for this have been the subject of much debate. Many<br/>\n&gt; solutions have been presented, however, it looks like Verant has<br/>\n&gt; &quot;fixed&quot; them all. I&#39;m going to list all the ones that don&#39;t work now,<br/>\n&gt; so that any starting monks won&#39;t fall into these traps...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1) Create a Freeport monk and get his guild note to turn in for<br/>\n&gt; instant faction.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Problem: The guild notes are now Lore items, and so are no-drop,<br/>\n&gt; no-trade.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 2) Do the Tomer and/or Konem Quests in Qeynos.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Problem: The only faction you increase with these now is with the<br/>\n&gt; Silent Fist, the Ashen Order does NOT show up anymore.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 3) Get a Freeport monk to give you their White Sash, and then carry on<br/>\n&gt; from there.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Problem: If you try to get the next sash by turning in your current<br/>\n&gt; sash (gotten from the Freeport monk) and the items, you lose all the<br/>\n&gt; items and the sash. The Ashen Guild member will give you a message<br/>\n&gt; like &quot;I will not help beings of your kind&quot;. This is especially vexing<br/>\n&gt; if you had a Freeport monk to give you the Orange sash, and tried to<br/>\n&gt; turn it in for the Red sash. The Red sash items are a little hard to<br/>\n&gt; come by, and having them go up in smoke would be frustrating.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In conclusion, it looks like the only way to truly do the quests now<br/>\n&gt; is to build your faction with the Freeport monks in some way. I have<br/>\n&gt; been noticing that they HAVE been starting to like me more, but, I am<br/>\n&gt; unsure as to why. I believe it is because I&#39;ve been killed so many<br/>\n&gt; orcs lately. If anyone has any ideas, they would be welcome.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The only possible workaround I see now, is to give the items for the<br/>\n&gt; later quests to a Freeport monk (one you create or another player) and<br/>\n&gt; have them give you the resulting sash. However, I think the later<br/>\n&gt; sashes are no-drop, no-trade, unlike the beginning sashes, which are<br/>\n&gt; Lore items, but can be traded.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Finally, the point of the Monk headbands/sashes is not that they are<br/>\n&gt; terribly powerful magical items, but that it&#39;s fun and challenging for<br/>\n&gt; a monk to complete a quest that is not really available to many other<br/>\n&gt; people. Sure there are lots of items that are better, but it&#39;s a nice<br/>\n&gt; part of you character when you can say that you are a Purple Headband,<br/>\n&gt; Purple Sash holder ;-)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; (If I&#39;ve made any glaring errors/omissions, I apologize, and would<br/>\n&gt; expect that I will be corrected asap &lt;grin&gt;)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ATTN ONELIST USERS: stay current on the latest activities,<br/>\n&gt; programs, & features at ONElist by joining our member newsletter at<br/>\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/onelist_announce\">http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/onelist_announce</a><br/>\n&gt; &quot;&gt;Click&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; -- </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
