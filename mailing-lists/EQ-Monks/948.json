How does this nerf prevent me from pummeling a single roaming mob for instance aviaks in SK and fding and letting a lowbie still kill it? I would only be aggroing one mob in the middle of nowhere. The memory of a mob has nothing to do with that. This change only greatly effects the dungeon pullers.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Kevin <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, November 16, 1999 6:59 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [EQ-Monks] Feign Death<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  This is from EQ_Clerics:<br/>\n<br/>\n  Monks have officially been nerfed, their feign death skill can no<br/>\n  longer be used to split mobs. We found this out the hard way in<br/>\n  the king area of Lower Guk, almost got us all killed. We did some<br/>\n  testing, and sure enough as soon as our monk would stand up all the<br/>\n  frogs would leave their post and come running. (we had a couple<br/>\n  good-factioned lookouts watching along their path.)<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think this was done to prevent Powerleveling.  A Monk could fight a MOB to very low health..FD..and anyone<br/>\n  else could come up..finish the MOB and get full exp.  I sure hope they find a different solution.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n    From: Tim Perkins <br/>\n    To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a> <br/>\n    Sent: Tuesday, November 16, 1999 11:22 AM<br/>\n    Subject: [EQ-Monks] Feign Death<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    I am suprised it hasn&#39;t started already. I just wanted to share with you my Post nerf FD experimentaion.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Sol A green Flame goblins. the goblins I was experimenting with were on the floor near the passage to where the Foreman spawns.  I succesfully feigned them at this point. they returned to thier spawn points . I stood up they immediatly came back.  so I feign again they return to thier points I get up and run all the way to the small bridge type thing near the sol b spawn point. I fd again.  I was several mins stand up wait a few and here they come a running at me. I fd again let them walk away. get up and they come back.<br/>\n<br/>\n    A fellow monk on my server experimented in Lguk with some Dar Undead frogs and had similar results even after 5 mins of feign time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    any other people doing experimentation out there?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    Kizmet Bayashi<br/>\n    Monk of the 45th .....<br/>\n    E-Marr<br/>\n    Da`Kor </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
