I think the stell shackle<br/>\n&gt;will be a perfect compliment ot my items, and I have a new found<br/>\n&gt;appreciation for Magic resistance since I obtained my bronze shackle.  <br/>\n&gt;Stats<br/>\n&gt;are great on the Steel one though.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Any info you can provide to easy my quest would be appreciated.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I was in my mid twenties when I finished the shackle of Bronze quest.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Indicus Velox<br/>\n&gt;35 rank SwiftTail Caste<br/>\n&gt;Saryrn<br/>\n&gt;----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt;From: Thomas Kirchner<br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@egroups.com\">EQ-Monks@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Sent: Thursday, January 25, 2001 3:18 PM<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [EQ-Monks] Monk Quests<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;All shackles are Iksar only, I have had all of them.  I currently sport a<br/>\n&gt;Shackle of Steel and Shackle of Bronze.<br/>\n&gt;Shackle of Bronze: 6 ac 5 vs magic 0.2 weight.<br/>\n&gt;Shackle of Steel: 9 ac 5 str 5 sta 5 vs magic 0.1 weight.<br/>\n&gt;The Shackle of Bronze quest can be done in your high 20&#39;s low 30&#39;s with a<br/>\n&gt;group I&#39;d say.  Mostly for safety, and the pieces in Permafrost and <br/>\n&gt;Frontier<br/>\n&gt;Mountains, the rest is foraging and an easy quest.<br/>\n&gt;The Shackle of Steel in your low to mid 40&#39;s with a group.  That Droga<br/>\n&gt;section can be tough.<br/>\n&gt;Fenedar<br/>\n&gt;Innoruuk<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If someone is going to do the shackle quests, and they have not finished <br/>\n&gt;all<br/>\n&gt;needed factions, but are going to use illlusions or wolf  form I suggest<br/>\n&gt;gathering all the items upto the shackle of Copper and getting the box for<br/>\n&gt;shackle of Bronze.  the actual shackle is givin out by Master Rinmark in<br/>\n&gt;Timourous Deep.  and he initiates the shackle of Steel aswell.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;______________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;FREE Personalized Email at Mail.com<br/>\n&gt;Sign up at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mail.com/?sr=signup\">http://www.mail.com/?sr=signup</a><br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com\">http://explorer.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
