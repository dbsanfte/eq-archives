It is about taking pride in actually earning the<br/>\ngear I wear and knowing that what I have, I got for myself, whether by<br/>\nearning coin enough to buy it or by venturing and slaying the beast that<br/>\ncarries it. I got it. I did not have it handed to me on a silver platter by<br/>\nsome high level friend who already has no problem getting as many as he<br/>\nwants.<br/>\n<br/>\nKind of like that spoiled rich kid in high school who was driving the<br/>\nCorvette. Sure he looks cool, but you know damn well he didn&#39;t pay for it or<br/>\nthe insurance that comes with it. Would I like to own a vette? you bet.<br/>\nWould I take one if my folks offered it to me? hell no. All a matter of self<br/>\npride vs. selfishness<br/>\n<br/>\nPraelor Dileasai<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Felizpunk@...\">Felizpunk@...</a> [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Felizpunk@...\">Felizpunk@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tTuesday, September 14, 1999 5:42 PM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject:\tRe: [EQ-Monks] Digest Number 66<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Felizpunk@...\">Felizpunk@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 9/14/99 2:20:19 PM Eastern Daylight Time, <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:smcneill@...\">smcneill@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt; i don&#39;t be caring how *hic* much you hunted mammoths.
