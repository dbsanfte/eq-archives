Just hang around the first inn and run to the <br/>\ngaurds if you need to... also you can kill those little spiders as well.  <br/>\nThe first big money item you want to buy is a set of netted or better gloves <br/>\n(the order goes netted, woven, mesh) plan on spending at least 2 plat maybe <br/>\nas much as 5 or 6 plat depending on the day. Also, i would not spend any <br/>\nmoney on netted armor except for the gloves.  Save you plat for at least <br/>\nwoven but buying netted gloves is fine.  these gloves will allow you to hit <br/>\nmagic critters likes wisps and stuff which you really dont need to worry <br/>\nabout till at least lvl 8 and most likly 10.  You really need a pair of <br/>\nmagic gloves so buy em even if your not ready to use em yet.  Then as you <br/>\nlvl up just start moving west through the commons and do a little grouping.  <br/>\nI went to befallen around lvl 7 (which is in West commons).  If you stay on <br/>\nthe first floor and steer clear of trains it will provide you with good exp <br/>\nand good loot.  Its kinda risky gettin there and staying alive in there so <br/>\nenter at your own risk. I fought in East and West Commons untill i hit lvl <br/>\n15 after that you kinda have to move on or really start grouping.  But the <br/>\ncommons can support you well from lvl 5 to 15<br/>\n<br/>\nQuaan lvl 17 Quellious<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ashaman@...\">ashaman@...</a><br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: [EQ-Monks] Newbie on Quellious Need info<br/>\n&gt;Date: 29 Aug 1999 17:53:51 -0000<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ashaman@...\">ashaman@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hey everyone.
