Do you<br/>\n </span></blockquote>know what happens now?  Even more of a cheat if you ask me.  Just takes<br/>\nlonger, cause now after FD, you just need to /exit and wait 3 min before<br/>\nloggin back into the server.  I have been lvl 50 for about 2 or 3 months<br/>\nnow, and this nerf has seriously hurt our skills.  We are pullers, that is<br/>\nour main contribution to a party after we get FD and hone our skills.<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t say it was. I don&#39;t think FD pulling is an exploit. It is handled<br/>\nwrong in the Gameplay Logic. Personally I think once you FD and a mob _sees_<br/>\nyou back on your feet again, it should never believe another oneo of you<br/>\nFDs. As I&#39;ve said before, Verant has a MUD mentality in which they balance<br/>\ngameplay at the expense of logic. This is bad design.<br/>\n<br/>\nGetting back to the point is the way in which two main incidents were<br/>\nhandled. The first being the new monk robe, which is marginally better than<br/>\na lockjaw vest AC 12 vs AC 9 vs and choice of which stat increases you think<br/>\nis most valuable. Personally, I&#39;ll take the AC at this point in my monks<br/>\ncareer. Introducing this item seemed to me a border line waste of time, not<br/>\nmine, but theirs. The second incident being the FD thing. My favorite<br/>\nexample being when you stand back up and everyone but the caboose of the<br/>\ntrain forgets you and he goes along re-aggroing the lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think what got everyone so worked up was the FD split-pull defined the<br/>\nmonk&#39;s role in the group. Now that role has changed, and its led to<br/>\nconfusion and no small amount of bitterness. Given the over-crowding issue<br/>\nin most dungeons though, (75 in lower guk? _shudder_) the split-pull was<br/>\nbecoming less important as &quot;just finding&quot; something to attack.<br/>\n<br/>\nStone</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
