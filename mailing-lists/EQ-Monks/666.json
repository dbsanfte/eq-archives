Sems two me dat a slite<br/>\ndebate be goin on while i be away.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m going to steer from my whole drunk arguement and go talk normal so<br/>\nevery here can be understanding of what i have to say.  That whole MY<br/>\nGAME, MY MONEY agruement is old and just an exscuse for someone to say<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;screw you....i don&#39;t care what you think...i&#39;ll do what I want and I<br/>\ndon&#39;t care about anyone else&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nthats what the whole MY MONEY, MY GAME arguement means...and if you<br/>\ndisagree with that you are wrong.  The whole reason people say that is so<br/>\nthey can justify what ever they do even when they are wrong.  This is a<br/>\nroleplaying game with many many people playing at one time.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA massive multiplayer game right?  Massively Multiplayer.....i think<br/>\neveryone can agree with that.  And wheather or not you realize it<br/>\neverything you do has an effect on the other people who play the game. <br/>\nEvery orc pawn you kill, every foraged piece of food you drop...it all has<br/>\nan effect on the other people on the server.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow that we have that understood....lets talk about twinking.  Everytime<br/>\nyou twink you take something away from someone who is at the right level<br/>\nto have that item.  At 19 or 17 or 22 or whatever level he was...he took<br/>\naway an executioners hood from some 45th+ level character.  He took the<br/>\nserpentine bracers away from some 40th+ level character who deserved it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it&#39;s not the fact that he can go and get another one...it&#39;s the fact<br/>\nthat he is just going to have to wait that much longer because there is<br/>\nsome chump monk who can&#39;t earn his own equipment...he has to have older<br/>\nfriends help him out or just use his own older character to get things for<br/>\nhim cause he can&#39;t play the game like it was meant to be played.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI hate twinking and i hate twinkers because you take things away from<br/>\npeople who rightfully deserve those items.  I don&#39;t care if your 48th<br/>\nlevel kill stealing wizard had to shoot down the hopes of a group of 45th<br/>\nlevels to get the item....you still took it from them and gave it to<br/>\nsomeone who is 1/2 their age...maybe younger.  Everytime you twink an item<br/>\nyou screw someone who REALLY AND TRULEY DESERVES THE ITEM.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI think the one thing that people don&#39;t realize about this game and any<br/>\nother game is that it is everyones responsibility to provide a roleplaying<br/>\nenvironment.  it is EVERYONES responsibility to PROVIDE a ROLEPLAYING<br/>\nENVIRONMENT....it is a massively multiplayer roleplaying game after<br/>\nall..... <br/>\n<br/>\nSligo <br/>\nCazic Thule</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
