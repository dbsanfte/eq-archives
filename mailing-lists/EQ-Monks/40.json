Finally hit 20 last night (well, technically it was this<br/>\nmorning, I guess :) ), and I got to thinking about what life&#39;ll be like<br/>\nonce I get all &#39;grown up&#39;.  At this level, I&#39;m able to handle myself fairly<br/>\nwell as long as I don&#39;t go overboard, but the thought struck me that it&#39;s<br/>\nunlikely that I&#39;ll be able to pull off some of the kills that I&#39;m seeing<br/>\nother like-leveled classes do all around me - or at least not until<br/>\nsignificantly higher levels.  I can deal with the fact that monks might not<br/>\nreally &#39;mature&#39; until level 30 or so, but that doesn&#39;t mean I have to like<br/>\nit...<br/>\n\tWhile dwelling on this, I began to consider options which might<br/>\nhelp me accomplish some of these same tasks.  This brought me to get down<br/>\nto one of the basic difference between ourselves and our closest cousin,<br/>\nthe warrior.  With the right equipment, etc. the two classes can do about<br/>\nequivilant damage, but while warriors can take a lot more than we can (by<br/>\nvirtue of their greater hit points), we can tank just as well as they can<br/>\nbecause our forte is to handle damage coming our way by simply NOT GETTING<br/>\nHIT.<br/>\n\tWith this realization in mind, the question becomes one of<br/>\nincreasing our AC and resistances without violating the Prime Weight<br/>\nDirective.  I&#39;ve been doing all right up to now with a full set of Woven<br/>\n(exceptions: LockJaw vest, Orange Sash, Orange Headband), but I suspect<br/>\nthat I&#39;m outgrowing these.  This is where I hit a bit of a roadblock:<br/>\nWhat&#39;s next on the ol&#39; armor menu, and what steps need ot be taken to<br/>\nacquire it?<br/>\n\tYes, I&#39;ve heard about some of the more exotic armor (Rubicite,<br/>\nGreen, etc.), but remember that I&#39;m only level 20, and as such cannot go<br/>\nafter level 30-50+ mobs to get these things or come anywhere CLOSE to<br/>\naffording to buy them from a fellow player willing to sell them (yeah, like<br/>\nTHAT happens so often).  I assume that I&#39;m not the first person to have<br/>\nthese thoughts, so I was wondering what others have done to address these<br/>\nconcerns.<br/>\n\tEagerly awaiting input...<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nAaron Braunstein<br/>\nPacific Data Management, Inc.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aaron_braunstein@...\">aaron_braunstein@...</a>&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
