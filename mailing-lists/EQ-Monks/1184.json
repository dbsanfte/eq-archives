My personal recommendation is that until you have<br/>\nreached a point where mend does not fail (around level 20) use it<br/>\nimmediately when you see a bubble and a half of your health expire.  Use it<br/>\nfor both of those reasons that brother Shelza indicates--faster recycling<br/>\nfor the next mend, save cleric mana--and also use it so that if you are in<br/>\na particularly close combat situation, you will have a better idea if you<br/>\nshould retreat or not (if it fails or worsens). When your mend skill<br/>\nreaches a point where it is successful every use (and yes, that time will<br/>\ncome). Then I would do as brother Dizzy recommends and save it for post<br/>\nbattle recuperation after you have applied your bind wound skill. In this<br/>\nlast example, by the time you have reached full health and begin the battle<br/>\nanew, your mend skill should refresh. You will then be able to repeat the<br/>\nprocess. I used this last technique to great effect battling fierce<br/>\ngargoyles in the Ocean of Tears from levels 22 to 25. To those that<br/>\nadvocate chasing noble Aviaks at this level range, just know this, Aviaks<br/>\ndo not attack unprovoked while the evil gargoyles have no qualms about<br/>\ndrawing human blood...<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Quellious&#39;s name,<br/>\n<br/>\nManjushri<br/>\nBearer of the Red Sash of the Ashen Order<br/>\n(Fennin Ro)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
