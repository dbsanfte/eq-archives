I have a regular hunting partner who is an enchanter, and while<br/>\nyes, she does have the pulling abilities you mentioned, we both agreed that<br/>\nis was far more beneficial for me to pull and her to save her mana for when<br/>\nI return with a couple friends. If she pulls two mobs, then both beasts are<br/>\nconcentrating on her. If I pull 2, only the mob she mez&#39;s will be<br/>\nconcentrating on her, and I can change that pretty quick by attacking it<br/>\nbefore the Mez wears off. This way, she takes no hits, she does not get<br/>\ninterrupted, and I do not worry about her being attacked. My personal goal<br/>\nin each and every fight is to not let whatever caster I am with get hit, so<br/>\nI really don&#39;t want her pulling. She is far more effective debuffing and<br/>\nbuffing as I come running back to her with critters in tow. The 2 of us<br/>\nregularly take out 2 even cons at a time and have taken out 2 yellows on<br/>\nrare occasions. And she is the ONLY class I would ever consider attempting 2<br/>\nyellows at once. Why? Because of her debuffs. The only 2 buffs she ever<br/>\ncasts on me are Alacrity and Cloud (weaker versions of Clarity and<br/>\nAugmentation I believe. Please correct me if I am wrong.) I don&#39;t know the<br/>\nnames of all the spells she casts on the critters, but they are simply<br/>\nawesome. Whirl, the one that slows the MoB&#39;s attack rate,  and Mez are just<br/>\n3 examples... all Debuffs. And that&#39;s what make this class special, in my<br/>\nown opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for their Travel spells, illusion is self only, invis from any class is<br/>\nfinicky at best (I find camo and superior camo to be more reliable), and I<br/>\nam not aware that they get Enduring Breath and Levitate. I do know that my<br/>\npartner, a lvl 27 enchanter, has never cast either one on me, so perhaps it<br/>\nis a higher level spell. Again, please correct me if I am mistaken. The<br/>\ndruid I hunt with has both, and the Wiz has Lev (and Evac for the first time<br/>\nlast night, whew!). While Evac is a great perk to the Wiz class, it is not<br/>\nthe reason I hunt with a Wizard. If we get into a situation that requires<br/>\nEvac, then something has gone very very wrong. To group with a Wiz because<br/>\nof Evac is expecting things to go very very wrong. That is not a group I<br/>\nwish to be a part of.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did not mean to belittle any class with my breakdown, and I apologize if<br/>\nit came across that way. I was merely pointing out the primary reasons<br/>\ndifferent classes are called upon in an average grouping situation (in my<br/>\nexperience, at least). I suppose that it boils down to the fact that<br/>\nrecently I have grown weary of some monks claiming that we have become<br/>\nuseless with this or that patch, and that we need x, y, and/or z to become a<br/>\nmore viable and useful class. I think we have it pretty damn good, and<br/>\npersonally don&#39;t see a need for gloves that proc or nunchukas that stun or<br/>\nanything else for that matter. The only thing I have a problem with is the<br/>\nvalue of the sashes and headbands when you compare them to the items we turn<br/>\nin to get them and the stats they provide. But that has been mentioned going<br/>\nway back to the Betas, so it is fairly obvious that nothing was ever planned<br/>\nto change in those regards. The monk is, in my own opinion, the class that<br/>\nhas the least amount of balancing issues. I stick by my assertion that the<br/>\ntwo most important things you can do when in a group situation is to 1)<br/>\nCommunicate efficiently and 2) know the strengths and weaknesses of your<br/>\nclass and play within your strengths.<br/>\n<br/>\nPraelor Dileasai<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\tDan Gilbert [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sykotic@...\">sykotic@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tTuesday, September 07, 1999 11:58 AM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject:\tRE: [EQ-Monks] Suggested monk improvements<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Dan Gilbert &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sykotic@...\">sykotic@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; At 10:08 AM 9/7/99 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: Robb Flynn &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:RobF@...\">RobF@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;All classes (except Druid and Shaman) have one thing they are outstanding<br/>\n&gt; &gt;at, and other things they do ok, and some things they just plain stink<br/>\n&gt; at.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Why is it bad to be sought after because we are the best pullers in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;lands?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;          Two points of contention here:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;          First, Enchanters have MANY things they are outstanding at. Buff <br/>\n&gt; (Clarity and Augmentation anyone?), Debuff (obvious), Travel (Illusions, <br/>\n&gt; Invis, Enduring Breath, Lev, etc.... ). Wizzies have duel roles too. They <br/>\n&gt; are bar none the best damage dealers and the best for getting a group out <br/>\n&gt; of a sticking situation (Evacs). The only class that I can think of that <br/>\n&gt; DOESN&#39;T have more than one role in a group is a Warrior. They are Tanks <br/>\n&gt; only. They don&#39;t do anything else well (and sometimes they don&#39;t even Tank<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; well).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;          Second, Enchanters are the best pullers in the game hands down. <br/>\n&gt; They RARELY perform this function, but they can do it better and safer<br/>\n&gt; than <br/>\n&gt; anyone else. Watch an Enchanter Lull all the Mobs and then pull the one <br/>\n&gt; they want (and ONLY the one they want) back to the group. Plus, if they do<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; pull too many, they just Mez everything and continue pulling the single <br/>\n&gt; they wanted. Once you have seen an Enchanter do this you will gain a new <br/>\n&gt; level of respect. Monks are the second best pullers though.   :-)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Torg - 18th Circle<br/>\n&gt; E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  your connection to online communities.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
