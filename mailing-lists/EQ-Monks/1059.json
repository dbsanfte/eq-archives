My advice is<br/>\nthat if you get someone that can sell for you if you have a friend you<br/>\ntrust enough to do this.  Some times also there is someone in the zone<br/>\nthat is doing ATM stuff and will buy things from you (bronze,etc.) The<br/>\naviaks will sell to wood elves fine.  The centaurs will sell to anyone<br/>\nbut they aren&#39;t too close.  I don&#39;t remember but I think that the<br/>\naviaks sell bandages...or there is usually lots of mages running<br/>\naround.   If worse comes to worst you can get a mage to summon you<br/>\nsome.  I have seen them sold in zone often.
