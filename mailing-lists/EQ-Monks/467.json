I don&#39;t think we should be<br/>\nout-damaging a warrior swinging a big 2h weapon or dual wielding, and I<br/>\ndon&#39;t want to. They have the ac and the hp to protect them from those 50+<br/>\ndamage blows that would chew us up in very little time. I have always been<br/>\nof the belief that the monk is NOT a tank. Our armor limitations prevent us<br/>\nfrom acting like one. With one MoB, we are fine as Dodge and Block will<br/>\nserve us well, but if we get hit, we get hit HARD. With 2 or more MoB&#39;s, our<br/>\nDodge and Block skill will not serve us nearly as well. We are more like an<br/>\nanimated DoT spell, inflicting a steady amount of damage throughout the<br/>\nduration of a fight. Few people can dish out the damage we can yet remain<br/>\nrelatively unmolested. A drawback is it is very difficult to pull a MoB off<br/>\na party member who is in trouble, and perhaps I would enjoy having a Taunt<br/>\nskill (no I don&#39;t think it is built into our special attacks), but I for one<br/>\nthink the Monk class on the whole is doing just fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nPraelor Dileasai<br/>\nlvl 27 Monk of the Ashen Order<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Felizpunk@...\">Felizpunk@...</a> [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Felizpunk@...\">Felizpunk@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tSaturday, September 04, 1999 2:58 AM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject:\tRe: [EQ-Monks] Suggested monk improvements<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Felizpunk@...\">Felizpunk@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  Lots of good points brought up in this discussion. <br/>\n&gt;  I agree completely that we should get some kind of stunning attack, and<br/>\n&gt; that <br/>\n&gt; our delay should beat most, if not all, weapons. As a very well-equipped<br/>\n&gt; monk <br/>\n&gt; at lvl 40, I am routinely outdamaged by Ogre and Troll warriors, to say <br/>\n&gt; nothing of casters. So, though we have some unique abilities, monks could <br/>\n&gt; certainly stand some improvement. On my server, monks are sought primarily<br/>\n&gt; as <br/>\n&gt; pullers rather than combatants, b/c of Feign pulling...<br/>\n&gt;  But until we get organized, and talk to Verant in some organized manner,<br/>\n&gt; we <br/>\n&gt; will get very little...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Catsup Bustardo<br/>\n&gt; Cazic-Thule<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;              Free Games & Cash Prizes!<br/>\n&gt; Gamesville - The World&#39;s Biggest & Best Game Show Site!<br/>\n&gt;         <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/ad/gamesville0\">http://www.onelist.com/ad/gamesville0</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
