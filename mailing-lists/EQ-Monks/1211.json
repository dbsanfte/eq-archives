Every other class as far as I know has<br/>\nsome means of stopping a runner.  Monks are the lone exception.<br/>\nWhether this is by design or the luck of the draw, or by design as<br/>\nyou imply, I can&#39;t say.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, your message seems to be an echo of Verant&#39;s message<br/>\nwhich I simply don&#39;t agree with.  They say they don&#39;t want to infringe on<br/>\ncertain classes&#39; abilities by offering the same spell/skill to another<br/>\nclass or in an item (eg clarity).  They do this to encourage grouping so<br/>\nthat every class has something to offer a group.  However, their design,<br/>\nand in fact their statements state that 1 group slot should be reserved for<br/>\nenchanters and 1 should be reserved for clerics and another slot should<br/>\nbe reserved for druids or rangers/wizards.  That is, any group must have<br/>\nan enchanter a cleric a snarer and an evacer to have a chance to do<br/>\nanything.  That leaves 10-11 classes to go for the other 2-3 slots.  This is<br/>\nnot much of an encouragement to group since it gets very hard to find<br/>\ngroups at high levels.  A monk with an item that procs a snare would not<br/>\nstop anyone from requiring a class that can actually cast snare to be in a<br/>\ngroup since relying on a procing item to keep runners from leaving is<br/>\nrisky at best.<br/>\n<br/>\nBesides, Verant stated that clerics are the only class that is suposed to<br/>\nbe able to cast exp rezzes, but there is an item that casts it and can be<br/>\nused by non-clerics.

Damage is not unbalancing regardless of how it<br/>\nis done (DOT or DD).<br/>\n        Alternative effects that come with that damage (such as root or snare<br/>\ncan be unbalancing). More often than not these secondary effects especially root<br/>\nand snare can be down right annoying, er go the ebony blade - great ranger<br/>\nweapon ruined by the proc.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe case of the rogue clinging darkness proc (is that the serrated bone dirk?) I<br/>\nthink this is something of a Powerfull advantage rogues have over other melee<br/>\nclasses.  Perhaps verant allowed it to help the rogue out a little bit (seeing<br/>\nas how most of their &quot;skills&quot; are useless).  You would have to agree that that<br/>\nclinging darkness line of spells is pretty darn powefull and make a duelweilding<br/>\nrogue quite a little damage/utility machine.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am still of the opinion that giving monks snare would hurt other classes and<br/>\ngive our class an unbalancing advantage.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the name &quot;treant fists&quot; goes - maybe it can proc a druid DOT or DD<br/>\nspell or perhaps a regen or damage shield?<br/>\n<br/>\n____________________Reply Separator____________________<br/>\nSubject:    Re: Re[2]: [EQ-Monks] Monks role:<br/>\nAuthor: &quot;Sheldon Jolson&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sheldon_Jolson@...\">Sheldon_Jolson@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate:       01/20/2000 11:03 AM<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Sheldon Jolson&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sheldon_Jolson@...\">Sheldon_Jolson@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nUnder this logic, why would a melee class such as a rogue<br/>\nor a warrior get weapons that proc darkness or DoT or even<br/>\nDD spells?

I have<br/>\nkilled the<br/>\n&gt; two goblin guards there till I am blue in the face.  Nothing has made that<br/>\n&gt; alchemist spawn.  Is there a trick to doing so?  Last night I spent about<br/>\n10<br/>\n&gt; hours at it (and I picked up the camp from a guy who had been there for 4<br/>\nhours<br/>\n&gt; before me and had to go to bed)  So if you think about it in 14 hours of<br/>\n&gt; non-stop camping he never showed.  Anyone who has done the quest can help<br/>\nme out<br/>\n&gt; with some advice?   I thought this guy was a 8-10 hour spawn?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ____________________Reply Separator____________________<br/>\n&gt; Subject:    Re: [EQ-Monks] Patch day is this wednesday!<br/>\n&gt; Author: &quot;RaceFace&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bean@...\">bean@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Date:       01/18/2000 8:04 PM<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;RaceFace&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bean@...\">bean@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Snare would be great.
