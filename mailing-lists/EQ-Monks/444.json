But anyone who has ever come up <br/>\nagainst a damage sheilded opponent knows why at that time it sucks being a <br/>\nmonk lol.  Can you say Quadruple hit?  Hitting a damage sheild over and over <br/>\nagain while the mob is attacking you at the same time is a sure way to die <br/>\nunless you just have more hit points.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo i for one think its alright for the things to stay the way they are.  Im <br/>\nfor a move into the more superficial areas of improvement like the proposed <br/>\ngraphic headbands.<br/>\n<br/>\nSkyCitadel<br/>\nSacred Knights of Yserbius<br/>\nRathe</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
