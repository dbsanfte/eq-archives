Now it rarely has more than 40.  Low<br/>\ntwenties is common.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWith a high number of players on a server, no new players will start there<br/>\n(maybe some).  Even with the slowest leveling players, the average character<br/>\nlevel will rise.  This is also having a tremendous impact on the economies.<br/>\nItems like shiny brass halberds, although great below level 20, are almost<br/>\nmediocre at higher levels, so the prices are dropping.<br/>\n<br/>\nCharles Lembke<br/>\naka, Raelph, Solusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Seamus McNeill [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:smcneill@...\">smcneill@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, September 20, 1999 5:00 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ-Monks] Digest Number 75<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Seamus McNeill &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:smcneill@...\">smcneill@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\ni have noticed at least on my server....alot of the 25th level and below<br/>\ndungeons are emptying out.
