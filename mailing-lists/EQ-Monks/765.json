Enchanter<br/>\n<br/>\n         The fight won&#39;t last long if everyone in the group knows how to <br/>\nuse /assist and the Enchanter does their job of crowd control. This is a <br/>\ngroup of 32+. The Bard will have Cassindra&#39;s Chorus of Clarity (The MANA <br/>\nsong) and the Enchanter has Clarity. Wizards should have little downtime. <br/>\nThey will play ping-pong with that Mob. Bard can juggle Hymn of Restoration <br/>\nif HPS are needed. Oh yeah, if it gets sticky you have 4 Wizzes, so Evacs <br/>\nshould be easy to get off.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 04:25 AM 10/7/99 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JnglSkyPWR@...\">JnglSkyPWR@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Here you go, the ultimate party, around lvl 40+<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;1- Monk<br/>\n&gt;2- Monk<br/>\n&gt;3- Monk<br/>\n&gt;4- Enchanter<br/>\n&gt;5- Druid<br/>\n&gt;6- Cleric<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;With fbss and the enchanter&#39;s celerity (39) or swift like wind (49) the monks<br/>\n&gt;can dish an AMAZING amount of dmg.  Enchanter can slow down mobs, and give<br/>\n&gt;all 3 caster types mana faster.  Cleric heals and buffs.  Druids have some<br/>\n&gt;nice DD and DOTS, snare and back up heal.  If you can think of a better group<br/>\n&gt;plz tell me cause I don&#39;t think there is.  No resisting and don&#39;t need a<br/>\n&gt;taunt as the casters more than likely aren&#39;t gonna get jumped.  Not to<br/>\n&gt;mention, if one of the monks is getting beaten too badly, FD and mob will<br/>\n&gt;jump to another of them.  If you have ever seen this kind of group in action,<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll agree with me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Kanja<br/>\n&gt;Rodcet Nife </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
