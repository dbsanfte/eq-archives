All the suggestions I have read so far are cool! And I think<br/>\nthey would go along way to improving the game in a meaningfull way.<br/>\n<br/>\nIdeas for nun-chucks:<br/>\n<br/>\nThey should use the hand to hand skill<br/>\nMonk only<br/>\nThere should be 3 levels of nunchucks:<br/>\n<br/>\nA high level variant would be 7dmg/16 delay proc dooming darkness level<br/>\n34 necro spell? (correct me if I am wrong) <br/>\n<br/>\nObtainablity:<br/>\nObtainable through a level 40+<br/>\nmulti group effort similar to the Soulfire or flesh ripper type require<br/>\nments.  I would locate this weapon somehwere in LOWER GUK or SOL B.<br/>\n<br/>\nBalance issues:<br/>\nBear in mind that with 7 base damge a level 40 will only hit for 21-25<br/>\nmax damage with these nunchucks vs 35+ with his fists, the DOT makes up<br/>\nfor the loss in damage, and I think that the 16 delay is faster than our<br/>\nfists?)<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMid level version should do 6dmg/17delay and proc stun<br/>\n<br/>\nObtainability:<br/>\nObtainable in a single level 30+ group.<br/>\nLocate this in some dungeon but at a reasonably accessible place in a<br/>\nlevel 35 critter? the depths of UPPER GUK or SOL A, or the front part of<br/>\nLOWER GUKS LIVE SIDE or SOL B are candidates, As Is NAJENA)<br/>\n<br/>\nBalance:<br/>\nStun is such a cool spell. <br/>\nIt is a great way to taunt a creature, and it saves SO much damage <br/>\n- at leve 30 mobs hit for around 70+ a pop and they double attack often!<br/>\nStun is just want a monk needs to help keep stuff off his groups casters<br/>\nand to save himself a good 140 to 420 points of damge!  Nothing to sneeze<br/>\nat.<br/>\nAt level 30 you will hitting for 18 a pop with this weapon vs 30+ with<br/>\nyour fists. but the delay is faster i think.  I say again anyone know the<br/>\ndelay on our fists?<br/>\n<br/>\n_____________________<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLow level variant should do 6 damge/20 delay and proc root?<br/>\n<br/>\nObtainability:<br/>\nGood level 15+ group<br/>\n Locate it in a dungeon like Crushbone or Befallen<br/>\n<br/>\nBalance issues: <br/>\nAt level 15 a monk will probably be better off using his fists<br/>\n except for the nifty root that these weapons cast, allowing him to tackle<br/>\ncreatures in dungeons. This weapon is not meant to be a be all or end all.<br/>\nJust a nifty looking addition to the players wardrobe.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you guys think?  what is the effect delay on our fist punches<br/>\nanyone know?<br/>\n<br/>\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~<br/>\n~ ~ ~ ~ <br/>\nI.J.A.
