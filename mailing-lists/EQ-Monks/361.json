All the suggestions I have read so far are cool! And I think<br/>\n&gt; they would go along way to improving the game in a meaningfull way.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ideas for nun-chucks:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; They should use the hand to hand skill<br/>\n&gt; Monk only<br/>\n&gt; There should be 3 levels of nunchucks:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A high level variant would be 7dmg/16 delay proc dooming darkness level<br/>\n&gt; 34 necro spell? (correct me if I am wrong) <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Obtainablity:<br/>\n&gt; Obtainable through a level 40+<br/>\n&gt; multi group effort similar to the Soulfire or flesh ripper type require<br/>\n&gt; ments.  I would locate this weapon somehwere in LOWER GUK or SOL B.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Balance issues:<br/>\n&gt; Bear in mind that with 7 base damge a level 40 will only hit for 21-25<br/>\n&gt; max damage with these nunchucks vs 35+ with his fists, the DOT makes up<br/>\n&gt; for the loss in damage, and I think that the 16 delay is faster than our<br/>\n&gt; fists?)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; _________________<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Mid level version should do 6dmg/17delay and proc stun<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Obtainability:<br/>\n&gt; Obtainable in a single level 30+ group.<br/>\n&gt; Locate this in some dungeon but at a reasonably accessible place in a<br/>\n&gt; level 35 critter? the depths of UPPER GUK or SOL A, or the front part of<br/>\n&gt; LOWER GUKS LIVE SIDE or SOL B are candidates, As Is NAJENA)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Balance:<br/>\n&gt; Stun is such a cool spell. <br/>\n&gt; It is a great way to taunt a creature, and it saves SO much damage <br/>\n&gt; - at leve 30 mobs hit for around 70+ a pop and they double attack often!<br/>\n&gt; Stun is just want a monk needs to help keep stuff off his groups casters<br/>\n&gt; and to save himself a good 140 to 420 points of damge!  Nothing to sneeze<br/>\n&gt; at.<br/>\n&gt; At level 30 you will hitting for 18 a pop with this weapon vs 30+ with<br/>\n&gt; your fists. but the delay is faster i think.  I say again anyone know the<br/>\n&gt; delay on our fists?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; _____________________<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Low level variant should do 6 damge/20 delay and proc root?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Obtainability:<br/>\n&gt; Good level 15+ group<br/>\n&gt;  Locate it in a dungeon like Crushbone or Befallen<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Balance issues: <br/>\n&gt; At level 15 a monk will probably be better off using his fists<br/>\n&gt;  except for the nifty root that these weapons cast, allowing him to tackle<br/>\n&gt; creatures in dungeons. This weapon is not meant to be a be all or end all.<br/>\n&gt; Just a nifty looking addition to the players wardrobe.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What do you guys think?  what is the effect delay on our fist punches<br/>\n&gt; anyone know?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~<br/>\n&gt; ~ ~ ~ ~ <br/>\n&gt; I.J.A.
