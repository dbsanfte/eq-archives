It<br/>\nheals 1 hitpoint for every 4 points of skill.  So at level 9 you&#39;ll max<br/>\nat skill 50, and get 12 points per bandage, easily counteracting the<br/>\npoison until it wears off.  Raising your skill to that level can be<br/>\nexpensive however.  It has saved me several times though, and later when<br/>\nyour level goes up and money is less and less of a problem, you can use<br/>\nit very effectively to heal quickly and decrease the time inbetween<br/>\nfights.  Alot of times I can fight several battles, then use bandage to<br/>\nget back up to 50%, then hit mend to get up to about 80%, then right to<br/>\nthe next monster.  If you&#39;re fighting monsters that take off a bubble of<br/>\nhealth each, by the time you&#39;re down to 20 or 30%, your mend will be<br/>\navailable again.  Of course if you&#39;re with any sort of healer, the whole<br/>\nbandage thing is pretty much a waste.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdam Hayek<br/>\nSeani on Veeshan<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:adam@...\">adam@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jeff@...\">jeff@...</a> [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jeff@...\">jeff@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tMonday, June 07, 1999 12:11 PM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject:\tRe: [EQ-Monks] Digest Number 2<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jeff@...\">jeff@...</a>&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jeff@...\">jeff@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am a 9th monk fighting Giant Spiders in the east commons.
