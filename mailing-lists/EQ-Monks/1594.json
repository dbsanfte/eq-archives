Oddly if I get a<br/>\nresponse (which is rarely) I get &quot;I haven&#39;t seen him since 2 patches<br/>\nago&quot; or &quot;I haven&#39;t seen him in over a week&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI spent 70 hours trying to get a gnome toy from Nilits Contraption (for<br/>\nthe kerran toy) before giving up, it was slightly better then skaranas<br/>\natleast I felt like I was increasing my chances by killing everything<br/>\nthat moved outside the mino caves. The really stupid thing is the guy<br/>\nyou talk to, to get the clue as to what to kill says &quot;Talk not now!
