I&#39;m not twinked, I have no JBoots, and I never get SoW while <br/>\nsoloing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI nuke from long range, root before they get to me and nuke some more.  When <br/>\nthey break root, I wait until after they attack and root again.  After some <br/>\npractice timing this, it this is very successful.<br/>\n<br/>\nI soloed crocs in the oasis from 12th to 20th.  Very easy 20% xp per hour.  Yes <br/>\nI did die a few times, but obviously by that xp rate it was rare.<br/>\n<br/>\nI solo easy blues, sometimes medium blues, anything beyond that is dangerous.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
