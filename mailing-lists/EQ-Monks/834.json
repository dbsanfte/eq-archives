Yes, the monk does <br/>\n&gt;fairly good melee, the warrior is average/above <br/>\n&gt;average.  Enchanter CAN do good, but then he&#39;s not <br/>\n&gt;doing what enchanters do best.  Cleric Shaman Druid<br/>\n&gt;all spend a majority of their time healing/buffing.  <br/>\n&gt;No big damage.  Fights last forever.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>With the enchanter there you&#39;re usually only fighting<br/>\none mob at a time.  Fights do last longer but <br/>\nwith less downtime you are *much* safer moving <br/>\nthrough a dungeon.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;The Wizzie group spends more &quot;down time&quot; sure, but <br/>\n&gt;that&#39;s only because the fights last 10 or 20 <br/>\n&gt;seconds.
