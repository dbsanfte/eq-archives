I use 3 beltpouches for my storange, <br/>\nand a large sewing kit.  And truthfully, I don&#39;t make most of my money from <br/>\nmy loot.  My looting policy is, if its not really expencive or really light, <br/>\nhopefully stackable, or most important of use to me, I usually just destroy <br/>\nit.  I figure let the casters and tanks and most importantly the healers <br/>\ntake most of the expensive heavy loot, as they need the money well more than <br/>\nI do.  I can make my money other ways...<br/>\n<br/>\nShelza 18th, Karana<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Under 9?  thats impressive... what backpacks/boxes do you use... if any?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I generally am at 14 or so... of course I carry an Sewn Evil Eye Pack<br/>\n&gt;(3wt) and a few Large bags which are 1 wt each<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I know its very un-monk of me but I have never abided by the 14 stone<br/>\n&gt;rule.  By this I mean that many monks will never loot past 14 stones but<br/>\n&gt;I think thats stupid and you will never make money.  Sure your losing AC<br/>\n&gt;and can potentially die faster but its a risk you take to actually make<br/>\n&gt;some money in the game.
