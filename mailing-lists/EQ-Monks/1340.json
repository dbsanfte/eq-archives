Is it<br/>\njust the level or their other factors involved?  It seems to me that only<br/>\nlevels are used to determine how any given NPC compares to a PC.  If PCs<br/>\nlevel is represented as X and an NPcs level is represented by Y.  If X=Y<br/>\nthen the NPc is Black/White to the PC.  If X&gt;Y the Npc is green or blue<br/>\ndepending by how much X&gt;Y.  If X&lt;Y then the NPc is yellow or red depending<br/>\non how much X&lt;Y.  If Verant wanted to really cut down on Twinking, they<br/>\ncould factor in  persons magic items, AC, buffs etc..  The PC may be X<br/>\nlevel, but with items and buffs they are in a situation where their<br/>\nrelative power level (Z) places them in X&gt;Y by a wide margin.  This allows<br/>\nthem to breeze through levels much easier than their non-twinked<br/>\ncounterparts.   &quot;Oh, look, here comes Fippy.  He cons red to me at 2nd<br/>\nlevel, but because I am twinked, I can take him with ease and get lots of<br/>\nXP.&quot;  If the cons and XP given  were based on the power level of the PC,<br/>\nthen the powergamers and twinkers would have to make a choice:  Do they<br/>\nkeep the really kewl stuff meant for higher level characters or do they<br/>\nplace the items in sotrage in order to level to the point where their items<br/>\ndon&#39;t matter as much?  &quot;I am a 5th level monk with a Vox and a Serpentine<br/>\nbracer, split paw gloves, etc...  I can kill anything in this zone, but I<br/>\ncan&#39;t get any XP.&quot;  (This e-mail was in response to a 5th level monk I saw<br/>\nin the Queynos hills who did have a Serpentine and a Vox bracer among high<br/>\nlevel items.)  It would solve some problems, I think.  Just my 2 cents worth.<br/>\n<br/>\nShando, 17th circle<br/>\nBertoxxulous</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
