Keep using it and the skill<br/>\nwill rise, once your skill goes over about 100 you won&#39;t see anymore<br/>\ncritical failures, they actually reduce your hit points instead of healing<br/>\nthem.<br/>\n<br/>\ndepending on your play style it can be very easy or quite hard to raise, if<br/>\nyou solo and use it as your main way of healing at lower levels it should<br/>\nraise quite fast. if you group it can be harder to raise as its easy to fall<br/>\ninto the cleric heals me I&#39;ll save mend for an emergency.<br/>\n<br/>\ni would use it whenever you can until it hits 100, a death at lower levels<br/>\nbecause of a failed mend is nothing compared to a death at higher level<br/>\nbecause you never trained the skill.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Epley, Jack [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Jack.Epley@...\">Jack.Epley@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: 14 June 2002 16:03<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@yahoogroups.com\">EQ-Monks@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: [EQ-Monks] Mend<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy is it that I fail like all the time with mend?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
