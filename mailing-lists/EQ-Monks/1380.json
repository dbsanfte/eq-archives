Over the course of it, you will receive several<br/>\nfaction changes raising Steel Warriors, Guards of Qeynos and Knights of<br/>\nTruth and Lowering Corrupt Qeynos Guards and Freeport Militia.  Go to<br/>\nBrin Stolunger in Warriors Guild S. Qeynos, tell him you are a [young<br/>\nsteel warrior]. He will give you a ten slot arena sack and tell you to<br/>\ncollect 5 bat wings and 5 snake scales and combine them inside to create<br/>\na full sack. When you give it back to him, you get a few copper, xp,<br/>\nfaction and a note that you are to take to Axe Broadsmith in Qeynos<br/>\nHills. (He&#39;s in the hut by the pond) When you give him the note, he will<br/>\ntell you to kill the [strange skeleton] across the pond. When you kill<br/>\nit, bring it&#39;s skull to him as proof, and you&#39;ll get more coppers, xp,<br/>\nfaction and a letter of recommendation to take back to Brin Stolunger.<br/>\nWhen you return to Qeynos and give the letter to Brin, you get MORE<br/>\ncoins, xp, faction, and another note. This one you take downstairs to<br/>\nthe animal pits below the arena, and give it to Grahan Rothkar who tells<br/>\nyou it&#39;s time for your Final Test. He will give you a key to open one of<br/>\nthe animal pens so you can enter and fight a young lion. When you kill<br/>\nthe young lion, bring it&#39;s pelt and meat to Grahan and you&#39;ll get MORE<br/>\ncopper, xp, faction and TADA... Strongbear Bracers.  And he welcomes you<br/>\nto the Steel Warriors! (Submitted by Mistabus).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it works it probably take 30 minutes to do and be enough faction to<br/>\nbe high amiable.  I&#39;m going to try tomorrow afternoon!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
