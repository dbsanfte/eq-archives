I know about the <br/>\n&#39;only at night&#39; restriction as well as the &#39;every other night&#39; <br/>\nrestriction to his spawn, and the only thing I&#39;ve ever seen spawn in <br/>\nhis spot are some NPCs that look like druids and con green to me at <br/>\nlevel 47.  The one I spend most of my time staring at is &quot;Voli <br/>\nGreenwhisper&quot;.<br/>\n\tIt seems to me that if Greenwhisper is hanging out in the <br/>\nmonk&#39;s spawn spot, then the monk can&#39;t pop and I can&#39;t continue with <br/>\nthe quest.  Problem is, I&#39;m concerned what taking this guy out might <br/>\ndo to my factions (REALLY don&#39;t wanna screw my druid faction, as a <br/>\ngroup gate out of a nasty spot in a dungeon at low health into the <br/>\narms of some pissed-off druids at the stones is not my idea of a fun <br/>\ntime.<br/>\n\tSo my question would be: Do I have to kill this guy to free <br/>\nup the space for the monk to pop when it&#39;s his time, and if so what <br/>\nhits will I take.  If not, what do I have to do to ensure that the <br/>\nmonk DOES pop?<br/>\n\tThanks for your time...<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.: Yes, I know that they had stopped the quest before, but a <br/>\nfriend of mine has performed the quest after yesterday&#39;s patch, so it <br/>\nseems to be in place.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nAaron Braunstein<br/>\nPacific Data Management, Inc.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aaron_braunstein@...\">aaron_braunstein@...</a>&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
