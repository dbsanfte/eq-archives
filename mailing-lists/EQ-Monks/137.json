I think monks should be able to because it is one <br/>\nof the skills we get, and it makes us who we are.  Why even give us the <br/>\nskill if we can&#39;t use it.  Also to the people that already have it, what <br/>\nhappens when you disarm?  Does the weapon go on the ground or in your <br/>\ninventory?  Thanks</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
