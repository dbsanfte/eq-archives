The alchemist, a<br/>\nveteran, sentry, or a lookout will spawn.  The alchemist is the rare spawn<br/>\nat that spawn point.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Misty, go to the single hut goblin camp.  He shares the spawn point with<br/>\nMooto.  It&#39;s the one just inside the hut.  This is generally a 2-4 hour<br/>\ncamp.  The goblin captain and gelatinous cube I think are on 20min spawns,<br/>\nbut I don&#39;t think they have placeholders.. i.e.: they always spawn.<br/>\nLocations, I&#39;m not too sure of, as they were pulled to the zone for me. :)<br/>\nAlchemist in Misty is about the same level as the one in Runny.  The goblin<br/>\ncaptain is around level 22 or 23 I think, and so is the goblin captain.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey always have the quest items.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Nick Gee&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nick_gee@...\">nick_gee@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; First I&#39;d like to thank everyone on responding to my post, you&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; been a great help all of you. But I&#39;ve already spent a while camping<br/>\n&gt; him. He&#39;s meant to span every 72-80 minutes? cause I&#39;d NEVER seen him<br/>\n&gt; and i&#39;ve spent a couple of lvl&#39;s in there from 16-18 and now a while<br/>\n&gt; there and he never seems to spawn! Also when you kill him does he<br/>\n&gt; drop the humerus handled mace every time?<br/>\n&gt; What about the other mobs? Can you provide information for them liek<br/>\n&gt; the where they spawn and the times and lvl&#39;s etc? Cause I haven&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; spent much time in misty or runneyeye.<br/>\n&gt; Thanks again in advance,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Aedir Swiftstriker<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; DON&#39;T HATE YOUR RATE!<br/>\n&gt; Get a NextCard Visa, in 30 seconds!
