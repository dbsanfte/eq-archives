Very high<br/>\nlevel mobs for the most part, but a full group of lvl 36-40 players can do<br/>\nok *if* they are very careful. Many groups of adventurers from levels 35-50<br/>\nare soon wandering around the new area, exploring, hunting, dying, killing<br/>\nthings, what have you. One group in particular, lvls 45-50, is concentrating<br/>\non killing things. Not a bad thing in and of itself, but upon exploring a<br/>\nlittle, they discover many pieces of no drop, class specific armor. Soon,<br/>\nthey have invited all of their lower level friends to come in and partake of<br/>\nthe loot that would otherwise remain on the corpses of the dead critters.<br/>\nNow there are low level characters running around in high level armor. This<br/>\npractice continues and escalates to such an extant, that Verant feels<br/>\ncompelled to say &quot;That&#39;s it...&quot; and place a level restriction of 45 on the<br/>\nzone in question, thus banning EVERYONE from lvls 35-44 who were hunting<br/>\nthere for the actions of a few.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow lets place a name on this new zone and call it The Plane of Fear. I saw<br/>\na lvl 19 Monk fully decked out in Shiverback and bp jewelry the other day.<br/>\nNo argument you come up with can justify his gear. It is players like him<br/>\nthat made Verant come to the decision they did about the level restriction<br/>\non PoF. So don&#39;t try to tell me that twinking has no affect on those around<br/>\nyou. For every piece of twinked armor someone wears, there is someone out<br/>\nthere who has been trying to get that piece for a long time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will apologize now for the tone of this note. But the more I think about<br/>\ntwinking and the ramifications it carriers, the angrier I get. I mean no<br/>\ndisrespect to anyone. Just realize that there ARE consequences to twinking<br/>\nthat affect everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nPraelor Dileasai<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\tImari J.

Let them twink!  How does that affect my<br/>\n&gt; play/enjoyment? Express anger/resentment at peopl who twink and those who<br/>\n&gt; allow themselves to be twinked. By this you are implying that if someone<br/>\n&gt; were to offer you a haste sash and 2 serpentine bracers you would turn<br/>\n&gt; them down (Nay, you would curse them out for trying to twink you!).  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Personally if someone offered me all that great stuff I would accept it<br/>\n&gt; happily and be thankfull to them.  So suppose my level 30 monk were to be<br/>\n&gt; walking around decked out in level 45-50 gear would your everquest gaming<br/>\n&gt; expereince be affected in teh least?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Seamus McNeill &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:smcneill@...\">smcneill@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; i don&#39;t be caring how *hic* much you hunted mammoths.  By your 22nd yeer<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you still *burp* canna afford an exe hood, serpentine bracers and hav<br/>\n&gt; &gt; mutliple black pearls....unless yer twinked or yer *hic* guild twinked<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; mudder loving hell out a ya.  Still either way....it&#39;s a friggin shame<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that peepol twink themselves or allow themselves to be *burp* twinked.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sligo<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Cazic Thule<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; p.s.  ill say this in plain ole english...not drunk speek.  I saw a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 17-19th level SK hunting in Oasis.  Full suit of rubi/carnal armor.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Purity Belt, Dark Reaver, BP Choker, Plantinum Silver Ruby Veil, Dwarven<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Work Boots and a White Wolf Hide Cloak.  Whats the fun at that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; point...when everything you want for your character you already have.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; There is just no point.  I wish twinking was a bannable offense.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; ONElist now has T-SHIRTS! <br/>\n&gt; &gt; For details and to order, go to: <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/tshirt1\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/tshirt1</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ONElist now has T-SHIRTS! <br/>\n&gt; For details and to order, go to: <br/>\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/tshirt1\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/tshirt1</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
