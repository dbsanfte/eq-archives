In my experience, based on an <br/>\ninitial strength of 80(my dex and agi are at 95, which seems to be very <br/>\ncommon), if my weight climbs above 14 then my ac definitely takes a <br/>\nsignificant dive. This will also be affected by any magical bonuses you get, <br/>\nas well as a piece of armor that, in your current configuration, the ac <br/>\npenalty is offset by the armor bonus. For example your weight drops your ac <br/>\nby 10, but the new armor adds 12, so you perceive a gain of 2. If your <br/>\nweight affects your atk number(I&#39;ve not looked that deeply, but it should be <br/>\neasy to check) that 2 ac gain is going to hurt a lot more than help. You&#39;ll <br/>\njust have to check it out. The general consensus is that netted/woven/mesh <br/>\narmor are what you are going to want for a long time to come(I think in that <br/>\norder), most of which can be had in Guk.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething else, and you&#39;ll be harassed to no end over this...<br/>\n<br/>\nSince you are still young, you might consider training up your one handed <br/>\nblunt skill. Monks(players) will treat you like you are some sort of war <br/>\ncriminal, but there is NO disadvantage in training up this skill. Your <br/>\nskills will advance very quickly after you level, you could even work on the <br/>\n2HB skill as well, there is more than enough time to raise all of them. The <br/>\nadvantage is that somewhere along the line you will find some weapon that <br/>\n(in fact much of the time) will allow you to hit for more damage, or some <br/>\nwhizzy magical effect. Seeings how your fists never get faster than <br/>\n30(that&#39;s Verant&#39;s number), for much of the middling levels this can be a <br/>\nsignificant advantage. Dress light(these weapons can be heavy), and go <br/>\nanonymous, and you will be happy with your new skills. And you&#39;ll be the <br/>\ncoolest looking &lt;anonomyous&gt; on the newbie field(or at the very least you&#39;ll <br/>\nlook different from everyone else).<br/>\n<br/>\nGrog<br/>\n<br/>\n-Linux, the free OS for those which time is invaluable.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Blizzard&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:blizzard15@...\">blizzard15@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Monk@onelist.com\">EQ_Monk@onelist.com</a>&gt;, &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: [EQ-Monks] Weight<br/>\n&gt;Date: Sun, 4 Jul 1999 11:02:42 -0500<br/>\n&gt;MIME-Version: 1.0<br/>\n&gt;From errors-200535-117-rmarll Sun Jul 04 16:54:10 1999<br/>\n&gt;Received: from [209.207.164.225] by hotmail.com (1.5) with SMTP id <br/>\n&gt;MHotMailB9493F2200B2D82197A6D1CFA4E138930; Sun Jul 04 16:54:10 1999<br/>\n&gt;Received: (qmail 11207 invoked by alias); 4 Jul 1999 16:02:07 -0000<br/>\n&gt;Received: (qmail 11193 invoked from network); 4 Jul 1999 16:02:05 -0000<br/>\n&gt;Received: from unknown (HELO smtp3.mindspring.com) (207.69.200.33) by <br/>\n&gt;pop.onelist.com with SMTP; 4 Jul 1999 16:02:05 -0000<br/>\n&gt;Received: from blizzard15mindspring (pool-207-205-141-166.rvdl.grid.net <br/>\n&gt;[207.205.141.166]) by smtp3.mindspring.com (8.8.5/8.8.5) with SMTP id <br/>\n&gt;MAA13467; Sun, 4 Jul 1999 12:01:36 -0400 (EDT)<br/>\n&gt;Message-ID: &lt;001601bec636$a70e04c0$a68dcdcf@com&gt;<br/>\n&gt;X-Priority: 3<br/>\n&gt;X-MSMail-Priority: Normal<br/>\n&gt;X-Mailer: Microsoft Outlook Express 5.00.2314.1300<br/>\n&gt;X-MimeOLE: Produced By Microsoft MimeOLE V5.00.2314.1300<br/>\n&gt;Mailing-List: list <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a>; contact <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks-owner@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks-owner@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Delivered-To: mailing list <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Precedence: bulk<br/>\n&gt;List-Unsubscribe: &lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks-unsubscribe@...\">EQ-Monks-unsubscribe@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I have heard many people say that weight affects my ac, then I have also <br/>\n&gt;heard many that say that weight affects my chance of hitting. I was just <br/>\n&gt;starting to get rid of my leather armor for light patchwork or maybe just <br/>\n&gt;spend all my money on netted when I saw a monk wearing leather. When I <br/>\n&gt;asked him he said that weight doesn&#39;t matter at all for monks. Now, I <br/>\n&gt;usually have more weight than 14 and I find myself missing more then my <br/>\n&gt;other less bulbous monk counterparts. So, what&#39;s the truth does weight <br/>\n&gt;matter for us?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I also was wondering, does ac and atk mean the damage we take and do, or <br/>\n&gt;the chance we have to get hit or hit.
