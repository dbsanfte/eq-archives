I am trying to complete the TREATN fist quest. I have<br/>\nall the ingredients except the cat skull cap form the gelatenous cube in<br/>\nRunning Eye.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am trying to find the exact location of the gelatenous cube in running<br/>\neye. If anyone here has any ideas as to whre it is (in relation to the<br/>\nthrone room an the captain spawn) please provide DETAILED explanation.<br/>\nEveryone tells  me behind the throne room but I just  spent all night<br/>\nkilling everything I could find behind the throne room and I managed to kill<br/>\ntwo captains in the time that no cube has shown its face.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk so as I enter the King  I face a door that leeads to the room where the<br/>\ncaptain spawns ( one of the elite guards is the captains place holder)  Now<br/>\ndoes the cube spawn in this &quot;captain room&quot; or  in the hall behind the door<br/>\nin the back of this &quot;captain room&quot;?  Or is he even farther back?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I am rambling excuse me but I just spent allnight on this damned quest<br/>\nwith no results... very frustrating....</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
