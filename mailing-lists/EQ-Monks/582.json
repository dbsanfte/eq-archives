Let them twink!  How does that affect my<br/>\nplay/enjoyment? Express anger/resentment at peopl who twink and those who<br/>\nallow themselves to be twinked. By this you are implying that if someone<br/>\nwere to offer you a haste sash and 2 serpentine bracers you would turn<br/>\nthem down (Nay, you would curse them out for trying to twink you!).  <br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally if someone offered me all that great stuff I would accept it<br/>\nhappily and be thankfull to them.  So suppose my level 30 monk were to be<br/>\nwalking around decked out in level 45-50 gear would your everquest gaming<br/>\nexpereince be affected in teh least?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Seamus McNeill &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:smcneill@...\">smcneill@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; i don&#39;t be caring how *hic* much you hunted mammoths.  By your 22nd yeer<br/>\n&gt; you still *burp* canna afford an exe hood, serpentine bracers and hav<br/>\n&gt; mutliple black pearls....unless yer twinked or yer *hic* guild twinked the<br/>\n&gt; mudder loving hell out a ya.  Still either way....it&#39;s a friggin shame<br/>\n&gt; that peepol twink themselves or allow themselves to be *burp* twinked.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sligo<br/>\n&gt; Cazic Thule<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; p.s.  ill say this in plain ole english...not drunk speek.  I saw a<br/>\n&gt; 17-19th level SK hunting in Oasis.  Full suit of rubi/carnal armor.<br/>\n&gt; Purity Belt, Dark Reaver, BP Choker, Plantinum Silver Ruby Veil, Dwarven<br/>\n&gt; Work Boots and a White Wolf Hide Cloak.  Whats the fun at that<br/>\n&gt; point...when everything you want for your character you already have.<br/>\n&gt; There is just no point.
