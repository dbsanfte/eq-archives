I honestly took the time and read this through - and<br/>\nperhaps mistakingly I did pick up on an anger vibe.  :)  I&#39;ve found when<br/>\npeople start shouting MY GAME MY MONEY MY TIME that some nerve has been hit.<br/>\nCamping is a sad fact of the online genre now.  UO, EQ and AC (From what<br/>\nlittle I&#39;ve been able to actually get in) all have spawn points.  People<br/>\nneeding money or items are going to find out where they are and camp the<br/>\nsite.

If you couldn&#39;t give a crap about ITEMS THAT ARE NOT REAL then why<br/>\nnot give me your Serp Bracers? :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd as far as the &quot;Working damn hard&quot; &quot;nice spread&quot; comments you made:  If<br/>\nthis is all just some mixed up little insignificant universe that matters<br/>\nnothing to you - go into the character selection screen, pick your Monk that<br/>\nhas all those ITEMS THAT ARE NOT REAL, and click &quot;Delete&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: John Carney [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jcarney@...\">jcarney@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, September 15, 1999 11:29 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ-Monks] Twinking thoughts (whatever)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: John Carney &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jcarney@...\">jcarney@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Nice spread&quot; - &quot;Worked damn hard&quot; - &quot;nothing to look forward too&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhatever.  These are all words and phrases that bother me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I&#39;m going to throw up all over my cloth shoes. I have a some twinked<br/>\nitems, no doubt about it. Among my favorites are the Serp Braces given to me<br/>\nby<br/>\na dear real life friend when I first broke level ten.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo not presume to tell me how to enjoy MY game paid for with MY MONEY. If<br/>\nyour<br/>\nidea of fun is waiting around, camping out a certain area for some piece of<br/>\nequipment, be my guest, but DO NOT ASSUME everyone else has that same sense<br/>\nof<br/>\nfun.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do not, and never will attach any amount of significance to the<br/>\nacquisition of<br/>\nitems THAT ARE NOT REAL. If I could play this game naked, without any<br/>\ninventory<br/>\nat all, I would. This is one of the reasons I choose the Monk class. I<br/>\ndetest<br/>\nthe idea of running all over the universe begging to group with some other<br/>\nplayers, using each other to just get a new piece of armor. If I were forced<br/>\nto<br/>\ndo that, I would not be &quot;around too much longer&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs it stands now, I am having the most fun leveling my monk, attempting to<br/>\nreach<br/>\na point in the game where I can adventure with my friends who purchased the<br/>\ngame<br/>\ntwo or three months before I did. I want to play with them, sitting in their<br/>\noffice till 3 am, playing on their T1, drinking beer, while we all are<br/>\ngaming<br/>\nTogether, not merely on the same server.<br/>\n<br/>\nStonedorn - Xegony - 15th Oval<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nJohn M.
