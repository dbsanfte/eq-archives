I would dare say that<br/>\na well equiped monk of level 50 will OUTDAMAGE any warrior or mele class<br/>\nin a fight - haste sash and what not.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think we are definitely one of the most damage dealing melee calsses out<br/>\nthere. But we are best because we need NO fancy EQ to do it.  A naked monk<br/>\nis *almost* as deadly as a one fully equipped.  This is usefull for corpse<br/>\nrecovery and rescue missions in dungeons.  What is a Pallie with no<br/>\nGHoulbane  or soulfire - a snivelling wimp thats what!  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ <br/>\nI.J.A.
