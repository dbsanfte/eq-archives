I<br/>\nspent a lot of time looking into the game before I<br/>\nbought and decided I would have the most fun playing a<br/>\nmonk.  I started a Monk character and have been<br/>\nimmensily satisfied, I am level 8. (I started in<br/>\nfreeport)<br/>\n<br/>\nOnto sashes.  I have had horrible experiences with<br/>\nsashes.  I got the white sash at Level 2, you would<br/>\nhave a hell of a time killing deathfist pawns at level<br/>\n1 so I think most ppl get it at 2.  Anyway... by 5 I<br/>\nwas out of the newbie area and began searching for the<br/>\nthings needed for the yellow headband, to refresh our<br/>\nmemory you need a Tarantula Chitin, a Deathfist<br/>\nSlashed Belt, and a Giant Snake Rattle.  I worked hard<br/>\nto get these items, and because I was trying at a<br/>\nlower level than I should it was very difficult.  I<br/>\nmanaged to kill a tarantula with a group of 4 people. <br/>\nI also found the  rattle and slashed belt this way. <br/>\nGreat I thought, I as level 6 and I was about to get<br/>\nsomething that most ppl can&#39;t get on their own till 7<br/>\nor 8.  I took the stuff back, turned it all in and I<br/>\ngot nothing.  I was so pissed.  I had to go back to<br/>\nnewbie area to find all the stuff I needed for white,<br/>\nthen I went back and I was so pissed that I bought the<br/>\ngiant snake rattle and chitin and managed to find<br/>\nsomeone to give me the slashed belt.  This time I<br/>\nturned it in and it worked.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not looking forward to Orange tho.  I need a<br/>\nGreater Lightstone, Legionaire&#39;s bracers, and a<br/>\nCutthroat insignia ring.  I have the latter and I can<br/>\nbuy the former if I have to but I don&#39;t have a clue<br/>\nwhat the legionare&#39;s bracers are... its probably not<br/>\nworth the effort <br/>\n<br/>\nWorlord<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:worlord99@...\">worlord99@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nHammeron<br/>\n8th Circle Monk<br/>\nKarana Server<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nBid and sell for free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://auctions.yahoo.com\">http://auctions.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
