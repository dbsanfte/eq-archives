Go to gobby<br/>\ncamp 1, the Mooto camp.  The Mooto spawn point at the tent entrance is where<br/>\nthe alchemist will spawn.  Something spawns in that spot every 20  minutes.<br/>\nSo kill what ever spawns there as soon as it spawns.  I tracked the spawn<br/>\ntimes there for 2 days as I waited for this alchemist.  (If you let the<br/>\nplaceholder live, then the next one comes 20 minutes after the place holder<br/>\ndies.)  Another point, if you stand close to the tent the spawn pattern does<br/>\nnot include the alchy.  If you stand farther away from the tent the pattern<br/>\nchanges immediately and the alchy is a part of that pattern, eventually.<br/>\nYou will hear rumors that this is a 12 hour spawn.  That is not true.  I<br/>\nknow of one time period where he came 3 times in 12 hours.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe captain is in the room behind the king room.  Kill him fast or he will<br/>\nget help from the gobbies in the king room.  I hear there are 3 elites in<br/>\nthe room with the captain.  (I am missing this piece.  It&#39;s camped every<br/>\ntime I&#39;m in a group that could take the room.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe gel is in the pool near the king room.    A level 35 monk killed this<br/>\ngel and it&#39;s friend (a high level gobby) for me.  She took Â½ damage.  Be<br/>\ncareful, the two of them are very tough.  I tried helping a lvl 24  monk (I<br/>\nwas lvl 21 at the time) kill both and we never could succeed.  We had to fd<br/>\neach attempt.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe maps on everlore will help you find your way there in RE.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck brother,<br/>\n<br/>\nThors Blazingfury, Tunare,,</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
