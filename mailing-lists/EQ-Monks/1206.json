To give us snare would weaken the ranger/druid role from<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; group some. Snare would be AWSOME, but it would mean we monks become to<br/>\n&gt; powerful. able to solo in dungeons and area we were never meant to solo.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; While on the subject of monk items:<br/>\n&gt; I have a question for all of you who did the treant fist quest.<br/>\n&gt; I have spent about 15hours (total in two marathon sessions) camping for<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; humorous handheld mace off the alchemist in the  Xorb gorge.  I have<br/>\nkilled the<br/>\n&gt; two goblin guards there till I am blue in the face.  Nothing has made that<br/>\n&gt; alchemist spawn.  Is there a trick to doing so?  Last night I spent about<br/>\n10<br/>\n&gt; hours at it (and I picked up the camp from a guy who had been there for 4<br/>\nhours<br/>\n&gt; before me and had to go to bed)  So if you think about it in 14 hours of<br/>\n&gt; non-stop camping he never showed.  Anyone who has done the quest can help<br/>\nme out<br/>\n&gt; with some advice?   I thought this guy was a 8-10 hour spawn?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ____________________Reply Separator____________________<br/>\n&gt; Subject:    Re: [EQ-Monks] Patch day is this wednesday!<br/>\n&gt; Author: &quot;RaceFace&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bean@...\">bean@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Date:       01/18/2000 8:04 PM<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;RaceFace&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bean@...\">bean@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Snare would be great.
