We do have <br/>\nas good AC as warriors.  At lvl 50, my AC is 824 base, and that&#39;s not with my <br/>\ntankin gear, I can easily bump it up to over 850.<br/>\n    Now for my lil rant.  HOW can you say using FD pulling was exploiting on <br/>\nthe planes??  Do you know what happens now?  Even more of a cheat if you ask <br/>\nme.  Just takes longer, cause now after FD, you just need to /exit and wait 3 <br/>\nmin before loggin back into the server.  I have been lvl 50 for about 2 or 3 <br/>\nmonths now, and this nerf has seriously hurt our skills.  We are pullers, <br/>\nthat is our main contribution to a party after we get FD and hone our skills. <br/>\n We can still do this job, but it makes it MUCH more difficult and time <br/>\ncomsuming.  Yes you can get around it, BUT, IMHO, I now think we have to use <br/>\nmore of a cheat to get around it.  There are other ways, yes, but WHY (and <br/>\nbelieve me, I&#39;ve sent in MANY feedbacks and petitions) did Verant change this <br/>\nskill.  Okay, I&#39;m done, thanks for listening all.<br/>\n<br/>\nKanja<br/>\nRodcet Nife</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
