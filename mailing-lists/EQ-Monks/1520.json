I&#39;ve heard they are KOS in every<br/>\n&quot;old&quot; city (not true; they&#39;re ok at least in PART of freeport, but so<br/>\nare DE&#39;s).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe 20% XP penalty is over _baseline_, and humans are 10% UNDER<br/>\nbaseline, so compared to humans, Iksar&#39;s have a 33 1/3% penalty, which<br/>\nis significant.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey can&#39;t wear some things humans can.  (But the reverse is true<br/>\nalso)<br/>\n<br/>\nThey have a slower delay in H2H, which I think is about 20% slower, if<br/>\nmemory serves.  Thats a big deal for monks.  Less so for other<br/>\nclasses, tanks included.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, the advantages are:<br/>\n- swimming  (nice, not necessary)<br/>\n- regen (HUGE!)<br/>\n- night vision (nice for some, deal maker for others)<br/>\n- higher natural AC/higher base AGI (nice for monks, less so for tanks<br/>\n                                     since they can&#39;t wear plate,<br/>\n                                     tanks have other issues.)<br/>\n- forage (nice, but getting nicer the more I use it)<br/>\n- awesome newbie zones, with decent quests<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, as *I* see it, they are certainly more well rounded for a monk;<br/>\nthey are less dependant on the outside world (they can heal/mend/bind<br/>\nwounds), get their own food/water, have better natural defenses, and<br/>\ncan see at night.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love tanks, and I love monks, so this was a natural fit for me.  I<br/>\nlove &#39;em.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nFrugguk, Frivyn, Fromiss: Xegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
