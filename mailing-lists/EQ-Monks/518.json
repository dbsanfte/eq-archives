Magical improvements<br/>\nin either of these skills will work to your advantage for those goals. You and<br/>\nI are quite nearly equals in study, so I imagine, like myself, you live a<br/>\nhumble and meek existence. Such jewels as those that will greatly improve us,<br/>\nare often prohibitive in cost, and you will find that light weight pieces of<br/>\narmor may afford you greater resistance to harm.

As we both mature in our adventures, I am certain that those<br/>\nmagically crafted jewels that will offer a noticeable improvement of our<br/>\ninnate<br/>\nabilities will be easier to acquire.
