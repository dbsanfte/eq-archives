THey zoned in, one at a<br/>\ntime or in small groups of 2 or 3.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTHere is a fact of life that you who play on pvp servers are well aware<br/>\nof:  when you zone your body &#39;pops&#39; in the new zone several seconds before<br/>\nyour client is aware of it. Well in the few seconds that it took their<br/>\nclients to register the change in zone, EVERY SINGEL ONE of the 20+ person<br/>\nteam was killed save afew wizzies and a cleric who had cast<br/>\ninvulnerability on himself. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow picture for a moment this scenario:  our level 7 monk binds in Grob<br/>\nand sneaks away for a night of adventure in guk.  The inevitable happens<br/>\nand he is trained  - he re-pops in Grobb.  When he re-pops he is spotted<br/>\nby a bouncer who charges him and kills him in 2 quick chops.  He pops<br/>\nagain, but before his client can even register the change in position, he<br/>\nis killed again.  This Loop of death continues untill our friend (the<br/>\nformerly level seven monk) shuts off his computer - I mean what else can<br/>\nhe do? He cant log ou....<br/>\n<br/>\nIt would be an UNMITIGATED disaster!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy advice: bind in FP.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Tue, 24 Aug 1999, Adam Hayek wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Adam Hayek &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Adam@...\">Adam@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well, at 35 a monk certainly has nothing to fear binding in grobb.<br/>\n&gt; Level 7 might be risky though, as you point out.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Imari J.
