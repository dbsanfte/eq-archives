Telepathy, thats not all... Here is what mobs/any npc does:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   They always know where you are.  There is no way to escape a mob without<br/>\n&gt;zoning.  Mobs are faster than PC&#39;s.  Mobs can hit a PC from a greater<br/>\n&gt;distance.  Mobs are more resistant to magic.  Mobs have more HP than the<br/>\n&gt;average PC of the same level.  Mobs do more damage than the average PC of<br/>\n&gt;the same level.  Mobs are impossible to capture when they are running away<br/>\n&gt;(Ever wonder why there are so many trains in some dungeons? Mobs run away<br/>\n&gt;and PC can&#39;t catch em, and the mob goes and gets 40 other mobs).  Mobs have<br/>\n&gt;twice as much mana as a PC of their level.  Mobs have faster casting times.<br/>\n&gt;MOBS HAVE MORE FRIENDS.  It is much harder to resist a mob&#39;s spell.  If a<br/>\n&gt;mob is using a fast weapon that does less damage then the mobs fists, it<br/>\n&gt;uses the SPEED of the weapon and does the damage of it&#39;s fist.  If the<br/>\n&gt;weapon is slower than its fists but does more damage, it uses the speed of<br/>\n&gt;its fists and the damage of the weapon.  The list goes on!  IS THIS FAIR?<br/>\n&gt;IS THIS RIGHT?  WE CAN&#39;T EVEN RUN AWAY! HELL, MOBS ARE THE SUPERIOR RACE!<br/>\n&gt;WHY DOESN&#39;T VERANT HAVE AN &quot;Uprising of the MOBS&quot; where THEY SPAWN 50 VOX&#39;S<br/>\n&gt;IN EVERY CITY!  Why doesn&#39;t verant just BAN us ALL and play with the MOBS?<br/>\n&gt;Heck, they don&#39;t complain!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Prehaps they are able to do this, to challenge us.  That is how we earn<br/>\nexperience.  The world is NPC vs PC.  If you wanted a game that you could<br/>\nwaltz through, play Doom, Diablo or one of the other shooter type games so<br/>\nyou just shoot at targets,  power up and use all the cheat codes in order<br/>\nto have every advantage against your opponents that you want. <br/>\n<br/>\nShando, 16th level Silent Fist Clan<br/>\nBertoxxolous</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
