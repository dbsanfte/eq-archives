I have never wanted to play anything but my druid until just<br/>\nrecently I was grouped with a monk...and omg he kicked ass.  I have<br/>\nshyed away from melee classes since I thought they would be boring but<br/>\nafter doing some research on monks in general sounds like they get new<br/>\nskills all the time and can be fun to play...So I made me a little monk<br/>\nnewbie.  Now I guess after all my babbling I am on to what I need to<br/>\nknow here.  First of all...equipment.  What kind of equipment should I<br/>\nbe looking for...like boots and gloves.  I am ashamed to admit it but I<br/>\nam a twink and would readily buy what ever I need for my monk...so tell<br/>\nme what should I be looking for....for just good basic stuff.  Right<br/>\nnow she is pretty decked out in mesh with a few things extras like a<br/>\nbracer of errolsi and some silver +agi rings that I had laying around. <br/>\nWhat I don&#39;t have for her is boots or gloves and I have fought<br/>\ncountless nights in guk looking for mesh gloves....to no avail.   Can<br/>\nanyone tell me where to get something that will work in their place and<br/>\nwhat kind of boots I should be looking for.   Anyway sorry for<br/>\nbabbling...any advice is useful here though!<br/>\n<br/>\nLeiah<br/>\ne&#39;ci<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nThousands of Stores.
