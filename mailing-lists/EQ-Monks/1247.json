I am trying to complete the TREATN fist quest. I<br/>\nhave<br/>\n&gt; &gt; all the ingredients except the cat skull cap form the gelatenous cube in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Running Eye.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I am trying to find the exact location of the gelatenous cube in running<br/>\n&gt; &gt; eye. If anyone here has any ideas as to whre it is (in relation to the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; throne room an the captain spawn) please provide DETAILED explanation.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Everyone tells  me behind the throne room but I just  spent all night<br/>\n&gt; &gt; killing everything I could find behind the throne room and I managed to<br/>\n&gt; kill<br/>\n&gt; &gt; two captains in the time that no cube has shown its face.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Ok so as I enter the King  I face a door that leeads to the room where<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; captain spawns ( one of the elite guards is the captains place holder)<br/>\n&gt; Now<br/>\n&gt; &gt; does the cube spawn in this &quot;captain room&quot; or  in the hall behind the<br/>\ndoor<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in the back of this &quot;captain room&quot;?  Or is he even farther back?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; If I am rambling excuse me but I just spent allnight on this damned<br/>\nquest<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with no results... very frustrating....<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Was the salesman clueless?
