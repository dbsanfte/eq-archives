You always have to ask that? <br/>\nOnce this group is sitting in a room you&#39;ll do <br/>\nfine...how you&#39;ll ever survive to get there is <br/>\nthe question. :)  More casters = more downtime <br/>\nfrom all that mana being used.  Now the Bard <br/>\nand Encanter help minimize that but essentially <br/>\nall your damage is from those wizzies dumping<br/>\non the poor beastie.  I had this same argument <br/>\nwith a friend and he took the above party <br/>\napproach exactly...until the saw it in action <br/>\nand realized how poorly it stacks up for dungeon <br/>\ncrawling to:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Monk (best puller in the game bar none)<br/>\n2. Warrior (best damage sponge bar none)<br/>\n3. Enchanter (amazing...simply amazing)<br/>\n4. Cleric (superior/complete heals and res&#39;s)<br/>\n5. Shaman (best friend of any tank...2nd healer :)<br/>\n6. Druid (Evacs, damage shields and 2nd healer)<br/>\n<br/>\nSome flexability there but this is pretty darn <br/>\ngood overall.<br/>\n<br/>\n=====</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
