I personally totally agree with this, treant fists are not<br/>\n&gt;something we need, they would make up way too powerful and totally throw off<br/>\n&gt;game balance.

They have removed the healing proc <br/>\ncompletely.  This makes them a much more reasonable item.

So it seems that the quest is back in place, but <br/>\nVoli is in the way of Oakfist spawning.
