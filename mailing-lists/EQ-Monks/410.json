I was from<br/>\nFreeport and at level 6 I went west to Qeynos (solo through HighHold without<br/>\nSow or Invis ;) hehe ) and found the frogloks in the Qeynos Aqueducts. The<br/>\nfrogloks are a little tough at level 6, but you can find someone else to<br/>\nhelp you out.  I got most of what i wanted in the first night there, and<br/>\nhelped out a lower level monk and finished my collection of netted on the<br/>\n2nd night.<br/>\n<br/>\nRight now I am level 12 and looking for players selling mesh in the freeport<br/>\narea once again, but i havent found anyone yet. In a couple of levels maybe<br/>\nI will head to Guk. Also, I picked up a LJ hide vest or whatever it was<br/>\ncalled for 30pp.<br/>\n<br/>\nSleet<br/>\nBrell Serilis</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
