I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t sign up to hear people bitch and moan about twinking and spell <br/>\nnerfing.  While I&#39;m not positive, I would think that most of you didn&#39;t <br/>\nsign up to hear about it either.  Yet that is what fills up my mailbox day <br/>\nin and day out now.  Please drop it and lets get back to monks before <br/>\nanyone else is alienated from what used to be a worthwhile list.  If it&#39;s <br/>\nreally an issue for you, just create EQ-Twinkers and EQ-Nerfs mailing lists <br/>\nand carry on there.<br/>\n<br/>\nDorath</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
