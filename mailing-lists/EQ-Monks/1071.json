Yes, excactly, not you in particular at all, you as in general, anyone. ... No bridge, but they should have played some tag, hide and seek, kickball, ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-697530958\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Goode, Jason&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JGoode@...\">JGoode@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Just for clarification, I&#39;ll assume when you say &quot;you&quot;, you mean the vauge,<br/>\n&gt; general, collective &quot;you&quot;, not me in particular, as you&#39;ve not once seen me<br/>\n&gt; complain, but rather, just this once, try to speculate as to exactly why so<br/>\n&gt; many are so upset.  Now, on to your points:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, excactly, not you in particular at all, you as in general, anyone.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What you say about the social evolution of games is true, but I&#39;ll wager<br/>\n&gt; most of the  EQ players about today didn&#39;t grow up with bridge night with<br/>\n&gt; the Jones&#39; from next door.  For them, this is largely a new phenomena.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No bridge, but they should have played some tag, hide and seek, kickball,<br/>\nhopscotch, monopoly...social contact in games is, I hope, not new at all.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Nor, do I recall that anyone has once stated that their existing friends<br/>\n&gt; deny them groups and interactions.  So, discard that paragraph.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sorry, I assumed by the statements I have previously read, like<br/>\n&quot;can&#39;t find any group at all&quot;, and &quot;no one wants monks now&quot; that they<br/>\nweren&#39;t exaggerating.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Look, if you want to help, stop further insulting them and making them feel<br/>\n&gt; worse.  Instead, do this:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1) Come up with examples and arguments demonstrating that they can still do<br/>\n&gt; everything they used to, or alternately propose new ways in which they can<br/>\n&gt; explore and express.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Monks can&#39;t.  Verant believes the ability of classes to pull so safely<br/>\nat high levels was simply too powerful, and thus they took it out of the<br/>\ngame.  Half the power of FD is gone; its time to learn to live with the<br/>\nchange.  There is no work around, monks need to suck it up and go on.<br/>\n<br/>\nFormal, well thought out complaints are fine, but I find statements like<br/>\n&quot;Its more than a game, gimmie FD back&quot; just plain silly.  How many<br/>\nweeks of venting do I have to endure?<br/>\n<br/>\nI play a wizard...I have watched them take away our easy root/nuke/nuke<br/>\nstrategy.  I watched them take away our escape tool, jboots.  I watched<br/>\nthem take away our toy, manastone.  Each time I suck it up.  I still<br/>\nhave friends, I still meet new people.  My power is greatly reduced<br/>\nstill.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBut The game is just a game.  Monks have been tuned (nerfed), life<br/>\nand game go on.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
