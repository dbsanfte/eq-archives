How rare is Qwinn ? it took me about 16 hours to get Br Z. more rare<br/>\n&gt; ? less rare ? good places to try and find him / spot him ? does he have<br/>\n&gt; placeholders ? basically anyone got any low down on him ?<br/>\n&gt; 2. Is there still a skill check against tailoring ? (I have 0 skill in<br/>\n&gt; tailoring or maybe 1)<br/>\n&gt; if there is, and it fails will a GM give me either all the items again<br/>\n&gt; or the robe ?<br/>\n&gt; and should I petition a GM before attempting ... just in case ?<br/>\n&gt; (I heard that this was fixed a few patches back but still I want to be<br/>\n&gt; sure, this is hundreds of hours worth of work, I don&#39;t want to lose it)<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; yay the ordeal is almost over ..... treant fists next 8(.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Answers:<br/>\n1) Qwinn is pretty common.

Watched him taked out a cyclops in 2 rounds...<br/>\n2) No skill check is needed for making the robe now.<br/>\n<br/>\nTreant fist..
