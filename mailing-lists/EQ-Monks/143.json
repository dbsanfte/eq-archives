I don&#39;t think that each and every monster performs an<br/>\nindividual check, that would be way too resource intensive in terms of cpu<br/>\ntime and would have to be re-executed for each new monster that spawns or<br/>\notherwise nears you.  Besides, when six or seven critters are on you and<br/>\nyou manage to Feign correctly, they all turn as one and leave.
