I realize<br/>\nthis is a total tangent, but how many of you have actually had to turn OFF<br/>\nthe auction channel on a non-bazaar day?  I hate it.  I hate greed.  I&#39;m<br/>\nlevel 20 and I have 15 pp to my name.  But that&#39;s just me and I could be<br/>\nstupid :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI play on The Tribunal, and I don&#39;t think we have this problem, there just<br/>\naren&#39;t that many items for sale. I am level 15 and have over 180plat in the<br/>\nbank.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would have more, but when I went (solo-)wisp hunting, I would give LS<br/>\naway, and sell GLS for 4pp which was around 2pp less than anyone else does.<br/>\nI recently sold my spare woven (tunic, cape, leggings, bracer) to a fellow<br/>\nmonk who was wearing full leather and had a weight of 34 for 7pp (which is<br/>\nwhat I had paid for some of it earlier in my career). Money just isn&#39;t a<br/>\nrequirement for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am looking for something to spend money on and cannot find anything -- I<br/>\nwould like some of the top-end jewellery, but I have not seen any jewellers<br/>\nof high enough skill offering anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan anyone suggest what I should be aiming for? I am wearing mostly woven<br/>\n(except for shoulders, feet (obviously), waist and head). I am still wearing<br/>\n2 Cutthroat Rings - I tried the +2Agi rings, but the Derv rings seemed to<br/>\nwork better for me - the 2AC and 4Dex appear to be better than 4Agi.<br/>\n<br/>\nWould love to hear suggestions from anyone!<br/>\n<br/>\nMartin<br/>\n<br/>\nNyrkl, Monk of the 15th circle, The Tribunal</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
