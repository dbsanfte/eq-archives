It&#39;s a different type of game than say, Heroes of Might and Magic,<br/>\nwhere this statement would be valid.  This type of game has a twist to it -<br/>\nthe human social element.  That, I think, more than anything else is what<br/>\nelevates it beyond a game to many.<br/>\n<br/>\nHumans are social creatures as a species.  We, as a species, have a deep and<br/>\nabiding need to interact with others.  In this way is how it (and any<br/>\nMMORPG) transcends being &quot;just a game&quot;.  It doesn&#39;t have anything to do with<br/>\nthe code or the virtual mobs that you virtually slay, but rather the people<br/>\nbeyond the icons with whom you will tend to build real relationships - often<br/>\nwithout realizing it.  Whether it&#39;s with your drinking buddies in a bar<br/>\nwatching the game, going out dancing with your girlfriends, or sitting in<br/>\nthe king room in Sol B, killing kobold and role-playing/BSing about your job<br/>\nin the down time, makes no difference.  Social interaction is still social<br/>\ninteraction, regardless of the arena it takes place in.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I had to speculate, I&#39;d say that the changes to feign death, or perhaps<br/>\nmore accurately now, non-monks perceptions of monks due to the changes in<br/>\nfeign death, negatively impact the ability of monks to continue to explore<br/>\nthe social aspect of the game, i.e., difficulty getting into groups of<br/>\nstrangers, thus not being able to share in a group activity and make new<br/>\nfriends, etc., that is the most damaging aspect of what has transpired and<br/>\nthe core root of the anger and outrage many monks express.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my thoughts...take them for that and nothing more.<br/>\n<br/>\nLeikung<br/>\nWarrior-Poet<br/>\nBristlebane<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Dave Gaines [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dave@...\">dave@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, December 16, 1999 9:09 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EQ-Monks] Digest Number 122<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Dave Gaines &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dave@...\">dave@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It should not be more than a game.
