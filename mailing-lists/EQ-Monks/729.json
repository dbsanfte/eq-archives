I have always gotten<br/>\n&gt;a Skull from one, but I have heard stories where this may not be the case.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;They are a level 20 mob from memory,  they only seem to appear at Dusk or<br/>\n&gt;Dawn, basically when the undead appears or disappears from the spawn<br/>\n&gt;locations.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The spawn at same locations as the Gnoll High Shamans and if you are not<br/>\n&gt;high enough level so that the other Gnolls are green, they will join in.<br/>\n&gt;Try and con all nearby gnolls before you attack, or even better get yourself<br/>\n&gt;a group.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;When the Embalmers appear,  if you can attack one early enough it will not<br/>\n&gt;have enough time to summon its pet.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Please be warned they are Necromancers and they can cast some nasty spells,<br/>\n&gt;DOTs and Fear.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The Embalmers also drop a plus 10 mana hoop, Crysknife plus other<br/>\n&gt;miscellaneous items on occasion.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The Skull is a lore item, so you can only really obtain one at a time.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
