Then be smart when you fight. Realize when the<br/>\nfight is turning against you and don&#39;t hang around until your party members<br/>\nstart dying. In my groups, and granted I am only lvl 22 and don&#39;t have<br/>\nimmediate access to Res or anything along those lines, it is standard<br/>\npractice to, when the fight is going badly for everyone, they back off, I<br/>\nget the critter(s) attention so they turn on me, and they take off. Now it&#39;s<br/>\ntime to feign. This has only not worked 1 time (Party lived, I died). Each<br/>\nother time, the party has escaped, our druid has come back to SoW me, or Wiz<br/>\ncome back to invis me, I pop up and head for the escape route.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I love my monk. I have played nearly every other class, and none<br/>\nof them give me the enjoyment of my monk. If you believe that we are a<br/>\nselfish class, then (and no problem with it btw &lt;g&gt;) that is the way you rp<br/>\nhim. Praelor is anything but selfish. I would rather take the death than<br/>\nhave our Paladin with 1000&#39;s of plat worth of armor and weapons take it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t care much about damage potential or tanking ability (gawd I do hate<br/>\nthat word tho... Wish people would realize we are NOT tanks. We are the guys<br/>\nin that little pill box with the machine gun. Tuff to hit, but when we do<br/>\nget hit, it usually hurts.). I know that a Ranger 2 lvls higher than me cant<br/>\npull a critter off me unless he casts. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe monk is as effective or as useless as you want him to be. And there is<br/>\nmore than just the constant drone of fighting to EQ. I think that if that is<br/>\nall you are concerned about, gaining levels, then the grass will always be<br/>\ngreener in someone else&#39;s yard no matter what class you play.<br/>\n<br/>\nPraelor Dileasai<br/>\n<br/>\nbtw... I am just stating my opinions here... it is not my intention to flame<br/>\nanyone or start a heated debate. I wish you all the best of luck with your<br/>\nmonks or whatever class you choose to play =)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\tCapps, Lee (EDS) [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lcapps@...\">lcapps@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tThursday, July 29, 1999 6:21 PM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject:\tRE: [EQ-Monks] Monk Armor and the short end of the stick<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Capps, Lee (EDS)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lcapps@...\">lcapps@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; yes... but we are a very selfish class...<br/>\n&gt; another words... what do we do when everyone in the party is dying..<br/>\n&gt; heal them?... no.<br/>\n&gt; taunt?... no<br/>\n&gt; wonder if feign death is gonna save our ass?... yes<br/>\n&gt; to me that kinda sucks...<br/>\n&gt; i like being able to help out in bad situations...<br/>\n&gt; yes.. it would be nice to have taunt...<br/>\n&gt; or maybe a death touch that does alot of dmg to get the mobs attention<br/>\n&gt; (could recycle once an hour or so.)<br/>\n&gt; or how about being able to use our mend on someone besides yourself...<br/>\n&gt; very<br/>\n&gt; minor but better than nothing.<br/>\n&gt; i like to help ppl out.. especially my party.<br/>\n&gt; i loan out money.. and give away items all the time...<br/>\n&gt; and i&#39;m thankfull i can @least do that.<br/>\n&gt; but sure would be nice to be able to save lives.<br/>\n&gt; almost every class with the exception of us and rogues can do something.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ranger, sk, warrior can taunt<br/>\n&gt; druid, wizzard can evac<br/>\n&gt; necro, enchanter can mez<br/>\n&gt; cleric can heal and res<br/>\n&gt; i&#39;m pretty sure mage pets can taunt or @they could blast a mob to get em<br/>\n&gt; off<br/>\n&gt; an evacer or cleric.<br/>\n&gt; hopefully one day rogues will be able to detect traps.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; if i left out a class i just couldn&#39;t think of it.<br/>\n&gt; ohh yeah... we got instill doubt... ohh boy.. but all i&#39;ve heard is that<br/>\n&gt; it<br/>\n&gt; sucks.<br/>\n&gt; from both rogues and bards.<br/>\n&gt; it hardly ever works and when it does it just causes trains.(&#39;<br/>\n&gt; and how the hell am i gonna fit it on my quick keys?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; i guess my whole point is i want a party to feel like i can help them out<br/>\n&gt; when things get bad.<br/>\n&gt; if you don&#39;t care about that then thats fine...<br/>\n&gt; but i don&#39;t think roleplaying is gonna make u feel any better when your<br/>\n&gt; whole party is dead and your lying on the floor feeling like crap because<br/>\n&gt; u<br/>\n&gt; couldn&#39;t taunt the mob off of your evacer or off your cleric.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Clint Mitchell [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mitche@...\">mitche@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, July 29, 1999 4:34 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EQ-Monks] Monk Armor and the short end of the stick<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Clint Mitchell &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mitche@...\">mitche@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; but if u think your gonna be able to start the best class in the game<br/>\n&gt; now<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and it be the best class by the time u hit 50... think again.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s the thing.  In EQ, there&#39;s not supposed to be a BEST class.  Each<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; every class will have its ups and downs, and, in the end, we all need each<br/>\n&gt; other.  Sure, there might be imbalances at times, but I don&#39;t think you&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; going<br/>\n&gt; to find a lot of groups refusing you just because you&#39;re a monk.  If they<br/>\n&gt; do,<br/>\n&gt; you probably didn&#39;t want to group with them anyway.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Personally, I love playing a monk.  Not because we&#39;re the BEST class in<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; game<br/>\n&gt; or do more melee damage than anyone else, but because the monk class is<br/>\n&gt; one<br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; the most unique classes in the game.  Who else dishes out as much damage<br/>\n&gt; as<br/>\n&gt; we<br/>\n&gt; do with their bare hands?  Who else has as much AC as we do while wearing<br/>\n&gt; plain<br/>\n&gt; looking clothes? (Yes, I _like_ looking ordinary.)  Who else has a cool<br/>\n&gt; flying<br/>\n&gt; kick?  Who else (besides rogues) can jump from Kelethin and survive?  For<br/>\n&gt; me, <br/>\n&gt; playing a monk is enjoyable not because I&#39;m the best figher in the game,<br/>\n&gt; but<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; because monks are unique and fun to roleplay.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But then, that&#39;s just my opinion.  Go forth, and form your own.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Faeaani<br/>\n&gt; Level 22<br/>\n&gt; Innoruuk<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ONElist members are using Shared Files in great ways!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Are you?
