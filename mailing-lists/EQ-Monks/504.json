You will begin to see significant <br/>\nimprovements soon, we get very nice dmg bonuses every 5 lvls, so you will see <br/>\nanother at lvl 30.  My guess is that the ranger and palidan had very good <br/>\nequipment for their lvls.  Either they have been twinked or had to spend a <br/>\nlot of time camping for their equipment.  I agree that there are a couple <br/>\nthings that need to be tweaked about monks, mainly a snare or stun.  And in <br/>\nhigher lvls, group will really love your FD pulling abilities.  I was <br/>\nrecently on a raid of Nagafen and who do you think pulled the FGs in the way? <br/>\n A monk, not me, but a lvl 49 and 50 monk.  Keep with it and you shall soon <br/>\nsee the benefits of monks.<br/>\n<br/>\n            Kanja Dragonfist</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
