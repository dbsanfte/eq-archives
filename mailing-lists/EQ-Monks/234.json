Now, the moral<br/>\n&gt;&gt; of the story is this. Having lied to us once already<br/>\n&gt;&gt; by stealing the armor, we did not trust him to ever<br/>\n&gt;&gt; give it back. Therefore, why would we help him? There<br/>\n&gt;&gt; would be many more chances to get Crush and his armor<br/>\n&gt;&gt; (which I plan to do for my new friend, btw) and we did<br/>\n&gt;&gt; not need his poor company.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Forgive my ramblings but in EQ ,as in life, you will<br/>\n&gt;&gt; get farther with honesty and loyalty than with<br/>\n&gt;&gt; mistrust and greed. If he had handed the armor over I<br/>\n&gt;&gt; would have been sure to help him since we would then<br/>\n&gt;&gt; have only needed the one BoB.
