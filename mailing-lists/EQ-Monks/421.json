There are only 3 frogloks that I&#39;ve ever seen and they spawn next to each other in a secluded section of the Aqueducts.  The quickest way to get to them is an entrance in the water just east of the Bank in South Qeynos (right next to the Office of the People).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe frogloks spawn in a underwater room nearby and dont wander around.  Once you get in the zone,  get out of the water and follow the path south and then west.  Jump in the water there and you will see them, if my directions are bad then swim around and they shouldnt be too hard to find.<br/>\n;)<br/>\n<br/>\nSleet<br/>\n[Brell Serilis]<br/>\n    -----Original Message-----<br/>\n    From: Kplatte &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:asmo@...\">asmo@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n    To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n    Date: Monday, August 30, 1999 9:07 PM<br/>\n    Subject: [EQ-Monks] froglocks<br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n    i hear people say there are froglocks in qeynos sewers?? been there but never seen one!
