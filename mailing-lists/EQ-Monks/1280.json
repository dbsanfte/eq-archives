A good deal is about 200pp (trust me you might get it for<br/>\nfree! They are fairly common drop - 2 or three are typically dropped in a 3 hour<br/>\nperiod in the music room).  Take these to Karg Icebear with 75pp (?? double<br/>\ncheck <br/>\nthat amount)  to earn yourself a pair of Lupine gauntlets.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) White wolf hide cloak:<br/>\nPersonally, I would trade the lupine cloak for a White wolfe hide cloak. <br/>\n(Better AC) Because of the coolness factor of the werewolf cloak you might get a<br/>\none for one deal (or even get some other goodies thrown in besides if the chap<br/>\nis gung ho about it).  But this is just my opinion.  The werewolf cloak is<br/>\ndefinitely cool to have and you should factor this in to the trade you make.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Platinum Fire Opal rings:  (55hp 5 ac)  <br/>\nReplace those jaggeds and give yourself a HUGE hp boost)<br/>\n Do you have a Jewel crafting buddy?  If he is a Good friend of yours or in your<br/>\nguild he might make you a pair of Platinum fire opal rings AT COST (which<br/>\nhappens to come to about 600pp).  Go to Genni in Solousek Ro temple bring 550<br/>\n*GOLD* pieces per fire opal you are going to buy.  I strongly recommend you  buy<br/>\n4 - 5 to give your enchanter friend a high probability of succeeding at making 2<br/>\nof these rings.   So take your 2750 in gold bullion, lug on over to Temple SOl<br/>\nand buy the rings.  It will cost your enchanter 105pp per Attempt to make the<br/>\nrings and the decent thing to do is to pay him his costs.  If he succeeds more<br/>\nthan twice take the extra ring and sell it for 500-600pp (now you see why<br/>\nenchanters have to charge so much for jewelry) and use that to finance the<br/>\nlupine gauntlets!  Keep the jaggeds handy though... I am an inspector gadget<br/>\ntype - I tend to walk around with spare equipment in my backpack so I can<br/>\n*optimize* for the various group situations, and there are times when the extra<br/>\n6str would be preferred to 110 hp. <br/>\n<br/>\n4)I am not certain but I think level 29 is high enough to CAMP for the runed<br/>\nlava pendant.  great monk neck 5ac 6 str and some fire resists too.  Even if you<br/>\nhang on to your agi necklace the runed lava pendant is good addition to both<br/>\nyour &quot;High AC&quot; and &quot;Human DOT&quot; equipment sets.  I want to get one of these<br/>\nmyself but I refuse to camp. *sigh*<br/>\n<br/>\n5)Vox bracer:<br/>\n Get a vox bracer to compliment the errolisi. 7 ac 0.3 wt is great! The resist<br/>\nare also great.  I like to think of resists as &quot;CASTER AC&quot;  and am proud of the<br/>\nfact that ALL of my resists are above 30 (and I can get em higher with<br/>\nspecialized equipment).  Vox bracers are cheap. Common drop of King in Perma. <br/>\n(100-200pp at the most)<br/>\n<br/>\n6) Diamodine earings<br/>\nIn the long run shoot for a pair of these babies.  Truly great monk items. +hp,<br/>\n+ac + str.  I love em.  But these are rare enough to be *trade only* or go for<br/>\nRIDICULOUS amounts of pp (2-3k or so) so just keep em in mind while you save.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n7) ON the subject of your foot gear:<br/>\nI would personally stick with the wolf fur.  Keep the 7 agi ( as you switch out<br/>\nthe serp bracers and possibly the necklace your agi will drop.  Even though it<br/>\nwas recently shown to be NOT *as* important as we thought, having an AGI ABOVE<br/>\n115 as a monk is a must IMHO.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is my two coppers.<br/>\nWell ok more like 2 plats worth.. (I get carried away when I get the opportunity<br/>\nto pontificate about equipment - its my pet thing)<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps!<br/>\n<br/>\nInno Blizardfist<br/>\nTarew Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n____________________Reply Separator____________________<br/>\nSubject:    Re: [EQ-Monks] What to buy?<br/>\nAuthor: Worlord &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:worlord@...\">worlord@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate:       02/02/2000 4:11 PM<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Worlord &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:worlord@...\">worlord@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy Equipment at level 29.
