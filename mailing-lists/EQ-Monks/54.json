I have been practicing non-stop <br/>\n&gt; since I got the skill and it is now at 50, but fighting crocodiles and <br/>\n&gt; caiman, not once has feigning death, whether i fell to the ground or not, <br/>\n&gt; stopped them from biting me. Is there something about the use of the skill <br/>\n&gt; that I am missing or is it just not that useful?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; _______________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Get Free Email and Do More On The Web.
