THis new patch only makes that habbit slightly harder<br/>\n DOT&#39;s do 66% damage while mob is running after you.  <br/>\n<br/>\n2)You may not beable to Kite BLOOD REDS anymore, but blues will be<br/>\nkiteable - by level 30 BLues are kicking any mele class player&#39;s butt, so<br/>\nKiters will still have a solo advantage over mele types.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Fighting in a group  your DOT&#39;s will do a good deal more damge now<br/>\nbecause Variant upped the duration by 18 seconds.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll this patch does is prevent players from choosing a character just so<br/>\nthey can Kite their way to level 50 ahead of everyone else.  If you seek<br/>\nto play a character that has an unfair levelling advantage over all others<br/>\nthen yes, this patch took a major chunk out of your behind!  But for those<br/>\nof us who are interested in enjoying the game, role-playing our chosen<br/>\nclass of character then this patch doesnt make any difference at all.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mon, 20 Sep 1999, Dizzy J. wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Dizzy J.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dizzyj@...\">dizzyj@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; with verant nerfing anything of interest in the game, I&#39;m starting to<br/>\n&gt; thing that the only way to play is to twink....rather pathetic<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Mon, 20 Sep 1999, Jeffrey Sue wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Jeffrey Sue &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jsue@...\">jsue@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Well the yield policy should help this somewhat.  as to the bibs... well<br/>\n&gt; &gt; i went to runnyeye the past 3 days in a row and no one was camping the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bibs while i was there.  i camped it once, the other 2 times i was just<br/>\n&gt; &gt; passing thru and checked on it.  (knight never spawned while i was there,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; heh.)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; At 10:57 PM 9/17/1999 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:IBNALNOOR@...\">IBNALNOOR@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;I would just like to say to the person that used the 26th level Bard to get <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;stuff that fine great if no one else wa around. I on the other hand have <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;walked into RE to try for a BIBS for a friend and found a 45th lvl Necro <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;sitting in the room. There he was taking away from us. I do not care if you <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;add to your character if it hurts no one else, but in the case of something <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;like a BIBS where it is a fairly rare drop your taking one might mean the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;difference from some poor appropriate level guy sitting there half an hour <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;our 3 to 4 hours. The Onyx Ear rings are a frequent drop, but some of the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;other items especially the items that started this whole debate are not. Can <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;anyone honestly say on this post that they have never  walked and saw<br/>\n&gt; &gt; someone <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;obviously not there for the hunting, but instead for the items? I have <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;absolutely no problem if someone gives there second character 1,000,000 plat <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;to buy everything in the game, but when they start having 45th lvl Necro&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;sitting in front of me and my friend trying to get a BIBS that becomes a <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;problem to me. If something drops maybe 3 or 4 times a day you have taken <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;something from someone else. For you to say that you did not is just plain <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;lieing to yourself. Again I have no problem with giving you character a leg <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;up. I am doing something like that woth my Monk. During the course of my <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;regular hunting if I find something that could be useful for the Druid I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; plan <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;on someday making I stick it in the bank. I will not though go out and camp <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;something for him. I will not make someone wait in line behind me while I go <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;for something that my current character does not need. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
