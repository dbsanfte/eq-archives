It is about taking pride in actually earning the<br/>\n gear I wear and knowing that what I have, I got for myself, whether by<br/>\n earning coin enough to buy it or by venturing and slaying the beast that<br/>\n carries it. I got it. I did not have it handed to me on a silver platter by<br/>\n some high level friend who already has no problem getting as many as he<br/>\n wants.<br/>\n <br/>\n Kind of like that spoiled rich kid in high school who was driving the<br/>\n Corvette. Sure he looks cool, but you know damn well he didn&#39;t pay for it or<br/>\n the insurance that comes with it. Would I like to own a vette? you bet.<br/>\n Would I take one if my folks offered it to me? hell no. All a matter of self<br/>\n pride vs. selfishness &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Jealousy. Who cares what else anyone has, simply because they had it handed <br/>\nto them? If you are essentially concerned with what you&#39;ve earned, then why <br/>\ndoes what others have bother you so much? It sounds like envy, and it at <br/>\nbest, reactive, rather than proactive. Bottled up ressentiment expressing <br/>\nitself.<br/>\n<br/>\n I am not twinked. Everything I have, I have earned. But the fact that <br/>\nsomeone else has not is irrelevant to me (unless I am harmed by it, as in the <br/>\nPoF example someone gave earlier.) Be proud of what you&#39;ve earned, and do <br/>\nyour best to have fun.<br/>\n<br/>\n Just my thoughts on this matter... And btw, Praelor, I have enjoyed many of <br/>\nyour thoughtful posts. I disagree with you about this, though.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
