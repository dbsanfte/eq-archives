Most of the other abilities that I can think of off-hand <br/>\nseem to have progressed beyond that except at an extremely slow rate <br/>\nof progress.  Speaking as a recent achiever of level 46, I can say <br/>\nthe following with some confidence:<br/>\n<br/>\n- After the last 30 hours of play, my Defense has gone up a single <br/>\npoint (to 211) - and I&#39;ve spent almost the entire time being the <br/>\nexclusive tank to a nearly endless parade of blues.<br/>\n- I don&#39;t remember the last time I saw Flying Kick go up.<br/>\n- Offense seems to keep going up at its normal rate of speed (now in the 220s).<br/>\n- The last number I saw out of Dual Wield was 252 - and that was some <br/>\ntime ago.  It&#39;s possible that it went higher (perhaps all the way to <br/>\n255) and I just didn&#39;t notice it, however.<br/>\n- Mend seems to still be progressing, but again is an extremely slow <br/>\nprogress so I may have capped that as well - not that it matters <br/>\nbecuase it&#39;s been over 20 levels since it&#39;s failed.<br/>\n- Progress on Feign Death continues, although I haven&#39;t been working <br/>\non it as much as I perhaps should lately so it still is languishing <br/>\nin the 190&#39;s.<br/>\n- Disarm is still moving into the 170s as well, but don&#39;t ask me why <br/>\nI bother - a disarmed opponent doesn&#39;t seem to be a whole lot less <br/>\ndangerous than an armed one.<br/>\n- Instill Doubt is the singularly most useless and dangerous (to us, <br/>\nthat is) skill in our arsenal and I haven&#39;t bothered to skill it up a <br/>\nsingle point since acquiring it at level 29 (which is where I was <br/>\nwhen the patch went in which supports it), so I can&#39;t really speak on <br/>\nthat one.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWhile my current rate of progress is annoying, it doesn&#39;t <br/>\nreally bother me.  However, I&#39;m becoming rather concerned about my <br/>\nDefense and Flying Kick.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve capped them, but the <br/>\nrate of progress is disturbingly slow.  I really don&#39;t want to <br/>\nout-level my skills and thereby be rendered useless in a group of <br/>\nlike-leveled people (as so many power-levelers have found).  Does <br/>\nanybody else have anything to say about this situation?<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nAaron Braunstein<br/>\nPacific Data Management, Inc.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aaron_braunstein@...\">aaron_braunstein@...</a>&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
