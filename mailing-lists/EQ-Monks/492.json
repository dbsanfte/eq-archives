One of my most vivid deaths as a Monk was <br/>\nin West Commons to a GREEN con Derv Erudite wiz. There were 2 Dervs, the <br/>\nwizzie and a rogue (didn&#39;t know it at the time). Both me (14th level Monk) <br/>\nand my partner (14th level Wizard) engaged the Melee and promptly got <br/>\nstomped by the Wiz. The Derv Wiz was hidden by a tent. After that first <br/>\nFire Bolt I ran back there to him and started hitting him. I lasted a total <br/>\nof 30 more seconds. The rogue got a single backstab in, but the Wiz just <br/>\ntore me to shreds. My Wiz partner did his job and dropped the Rogue on my <br/>\nback, but it was way too late. He ended up dying too when that Wiz finished <br/>\nme off and turned on him.<br/>\n<br/>\n         When I turned and ran at that Wiz and started hitting him, I was <br/>\nconnecting on most of my punches and strikes. He was getting hit, but he <br/>\nkept on casting. I hit him several times right in the middle of casting and <br/>\nit didn&#39;t faze him. There wasn&#39;t even a message about regaining <br/>\nconcentration; he just hammered me like I wasn&#39;t touching him. I have seen <br/>\nthis several times since then. After this fiasco though, I vowed to fight <br/>\nas few NPC wizards as possible. I now only take on Casters in a full group.<br/>\n<br/>\n         Interesting side note: The Derv Wiz was probably level 10. He <br/>\ndidn&#39;t get interrupted once. However, as any 10th level Pure Caster will <br/>\ntell you, getting pummeled like that by a Melee Mob that cons Yellow or <br/>\nbetter would cause EVERY spell they tried to cast to be interrupted. The <br/>\nrules of balance are definitely skewed towards the NPCs.<br/>\n<br/>\n         There are of course several items that will help with MR. If you <br/>\nknow you will be fighting Casters get your MR as high as possible. Get all <br/>\nthe latest and greatest equipment and wear it. Don&#39;t worry about AC that <br/>\nmuch. Wearing the following Jewelry and items will get you up to a total of <br/>\n70 vs. Magic (not to mention 39 vs. Disease/Poison and 44 vs. Fire/Cold):<br/>\n         (2) Platinum Diamond Rings (+7 vs. All)<br/>\n         (1) Gold Diamond Veil (+10 vs. Disease/Poison, +5 vs. Fire/Cold, <br/>\n+3 vs Magic)<br/>\n         (2) Gold Wolf&#39;s Eye Bracelets (+7 vs. Magic)<br/>\n         (1) Platinum Wolf&#39;s Eye Necklace (+9 vs. Magic)<br/>\n         Snakeskin Mask (+5 vs. Magic)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n         Getting a Diamond, much less 3, is a hard thing to accomplish, but <br/>\nthe Bracelets and Necklace are easily made by any skilled Jeweler. Total <br/>\nmaterials cost should be around 135p or so. Make friends with a Jeweler and <br/>\nyou should have no problems. If you don&#39;t have any Jeweler friends and are <br/>\nnot currently in a Guild, I would ask around and find out who the Master <br/>\nJewelers are on your server and then join the Guild they are in. It will <br/>\nsave you a ton of money in the long run and you get the benefit of having a <br/>\nhigh-lvl Enchanter to group with.<br/>\n<br/>\np.s. Fighting a Shaman and fighting a Pure Caster are two completely <br/>\ndifferent things. I could easily take Mooto (10th level Goblin Shaman in <br/>\nMisty Thicket) at 10th level and then got demolished by a 10th level Wizard <br/>\nwhen I was 14th level.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n���`�.�.�������.��.���`����`�.�.�������.��.���`�<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\tDan Gilbert, MCSE<br/>\n\tInternet Systems Engineer<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\tGGI Technologies<br/>\n\tP.O.
