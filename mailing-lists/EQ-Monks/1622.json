I just had to say though that when my STR is<br/>\nbuffed up I notice a dramatic increase in the number of times I hit and the<br/>\namount of damage I do. This is not strict scientific data not checked or<br/>\nanything but I do know that all my highs I have ever jotted down with flying<br/>\nkick and weapons attacks are all from when being buffed. If this is a<br/>\ncoincidence then so be it. I do know that the 110 hps more I get from<br/>\nwearing Plat FO rings as opposed to any of the better STR rings does not<br/>\nmean a whole lot to me. If one of the mobs in Seb decides it really wants to<br/>\nrip into me with my HPs I am a lost cause anyways.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt;      AC is the top dog but beyond that choose what you want.

I just feel that even if it<br/>\nboosts my chances to hit by one percent when I am wielding low delay low<br/>\ndamage weapons the more often I hit the more often I do my job which is<br/>\ndealing damage. Lord knows Monks do not have the HPs to be a meat wall.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ibnalnoor<br/>\n&gt; 53rd lvl Monk </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
