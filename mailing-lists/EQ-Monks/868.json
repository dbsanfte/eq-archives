I am of the 26th<br/>\nseason and I was wondering, when you solo the aviak guards in Lake Rathe if<br/>\nyou need to feign death you can, then you can stand right back up and<br/>\nbandage and continue on with the fight, my question is can you do the same<br/>\nto aviaks in the aviak village, I was wondering because if you can that<br/>\nmeans I can solo harriers instead of just rooks. Thank you for your time. Oh<br/>\nby the way I bought my BP Choker last night, and now I am broke, but I am a<br/>\nsatisfied broke hehehe, and I also traded for a Shralok Pack for my opal<br/>\nelectrum necklace too.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Steve Danuser [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:danu@...\">danu@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, October 12, 1999 7:49 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ-Monks] Digest Number 91<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Steve Danuser &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:danu@...\">danu@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;So who knows how to make these Gauntlets of Wu?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Just look around on EQ sites that talk about tailoring.<br/>\n<br/>\n_____________________________<br/>\nMoorgard, monk striving for Virtue<br/>\nPovar</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
