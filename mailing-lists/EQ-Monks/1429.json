Forget guk or everfrost, second you <br/>\nreally beat something up, it runs and gets more.  That is why I liked <br/>\nunrest, the dead didn&#39;t run as much.  Also gonna try Mistmoore Sooner or <br/>\nlater but I have never been there.  Birds in SK if you don&#39;t mind the crowd. <br/>\n  I soloed a bit in Rathe Mnts, but I decided to hold that off till I was a <br/>\nlittle higher level.  Anyway, that was my two cents  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nSister Shelza, Karana<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Currey, Mick&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mick_currey@...\">mick_currey@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: &quot;&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a>&#39;&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: [EQ-Monks] Hunting Guide?<br/>\n&gt;Date: Wed, 8 Mar 2000 09:07:20 -0600<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hail all you experienced monks out there.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;What recommendations does everyone have for places to hunt solo by levels?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My character is only level 21, but here were his favorites so far&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Level\tArea Hunted<br/>\n&gt;1-4\tFreeport<br/>\n&gt;5-10\tRivervale (with runnyeye bead quest)<br/>\n&gt;11-12\tBlack Burrow (with gnoll teeth quest)<br/>\n&gt;13-16\tWisp island (gls quest, good money and exp!)<br/>\n&gt;17-18\tEK (gnoll reavers)<br/>\n&gt;19-20\tHH (gnolls solo and orcs in a group)<br/>\n&gt;21-22?
