The<br/>\nmost boring levels of the game are the &quot;builder&quot; levels.

I&#39;m in it to look around,<br/>\nadventure.  Not have to deal with people wanting to kill me if I happen to<br/>\nget something cool for my chars.

But, I&#39;m<br/>\nnot gonna say I&#39;m better than people who DO use it.  I play the game my way,<br/>\nand I really don&#39;t care how anyone else does it (unless they&#39;re actually<br/>\nhacking the game, a la Diablo.)<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my 150 cents CDN (2 cents American.)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
