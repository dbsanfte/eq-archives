I&#39;d much rather move around and fight<br/>\ndifferent things.  As for how the game was meant to be played....  Well,<br/>\nthat speaks for itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nThink of that every time you get into a car, or a plane, or a boat.  You are<br/>\nequipped with boots or shoes or bare feet (maybe high heels, you never<br/>\nknow).  If you were &quot;meant&quot; to travel any other way than walking or running,<br/>\nyou&#39;d have wings, flippers, or wheels.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe idea that something must be done the way it was &quot;meant&quot; to be done is<br/>\nplain silly.  If we all thought that way, we&#39;d all be living in the trees<br/>\nstill and not speaking or writing, but that&#39;s not the way it&#39;s &quot;supposed&quot; to<br/>\nbe.<br/>\n<br/>\nKaelrei</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
