That s the thing.  In EQ, there s not supposed to be a BEST class.

In EQ, there&#39;s not supposed to be a BEST class.  Each and<br/>\nevery class will have its ups and downs, and, in the end, we all need each<br/>\nother.  Sure, there might be imbalances at times, but I don&#39;t think you&#39;re going<br/>\nto find a lot of groups refusing you just because you&#39;re a monk.  If they do,<br/>\nyou probably didn&#39;t want to group with them anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I love playing a monk.  Not because we&#39;re the BEST class in the game<br/>\nor do more melee damage than anyone else, but because the monk class is one of<br/>\nthe most unique classes in the game.  Who else dishes out as much damage as we<br/>\ndo with their bare hands?  Who else has as much AC as we do while wearing plain<br/>\nlooking clothes? (Yes, I _like_ looking ordinary.)  Who else has a cool flying<br/>\nkick?  Who else (besides rogues) can jump from Kelethin and survive?  For me, <br/>\nplaying a monk is enjoyable not because I&#39;m the best figher in the game, but <br/>\nbecause monks are unique and fun to roleplay.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut then, that&#39;s just my opinion.  Go forth, and form your own.<br/>\n<br/>\nFaeaani<br/>\nLevel 22<br/>\nInnoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
