I therefore expected to be needing two different inventory items.  I<br/>\nasked somebody on-line about this, and he showed me his own Red Sash and<br/>\ntold me that the whole wand is what he used.<br/>\n\tCan somebody confirm this for me?  I&#39;m a little (well, a lot) leery<br/>\nof gambling this whole wand as well as my sash (not to mention the<br/>\nstill-to-be-obtained saphire) when I turn them in for the Red sash.<br/>\n\tOh yeah, one more thing.  I&#39;ve recently put both my orange sash and<br/>\norange headband in the bank and wend with mesh articles in their stead.<br/>\nThe theory is that the AC (and damage dissipation) they offer more than<br/>\noffsets the small stat bonuses provided by the quest items - not to mention<br/>\nthe fact that we can&#39;t even proudly display these thins as we walk around.<br/>\nIs anybody else of this opinion as well?  At what point would the<br/>\nsash/headband properties outweigh mesh&#39;s?<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nAaron Braunstein<br/>\nPacific Data Management, Inc.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aaron_braunstein@...\">aaron_braunstein@...</a>&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
