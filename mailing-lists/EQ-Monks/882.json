I am of the<br/>\n26th<br/>\n&gt; season and I was wondering, when you solo the aviak guards in Lake Rathe<br/>\nif<br/>\n&gt; you need to feign death you can, then you can stand right back up and<br/>\n&gt; bandage and continue on with the fight, my question is can you do the same<br/>\n&gt; to aviaks in the aviak village, I was wondering because if you can that<br/>\n&gt; means I can solo harriers instead of just rooks. Thank you for your time.<br/>\nOh<br/>\n&gt; by the way I bought my BP Choker last night, and now I am broke, but I am<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; satisfied broke hehehe, and I also traded for a Shralok Pack for my opal<br/>\n&gt; electrum necklace too.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
