But its a 1 hand slashing<br/>\n&gt; weapon.  Really expensive, I think....  But still, something like that<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; had charges of poison or some other spell that could be refilled with a<br/>\n&gt; special item would be really interesting.. (For instance, serum of<br/>\nslowness,<br/>\n&gt; that would DOT and slow the creature down, and would require some item<br/>\n&gt; gained off a creature to replenish.)  Monks are indefinitely cool, but we<br/>\n&gt; could all use a refreshing new addition.  Maybe a cool graphic for our<br/>\n&gt; sashes/headbands would be good too.....  And a manuever that tosses your<br/>\n&gt; enemy back would be good for feigning.   Nail em away then walk off a few<br/>\n&gt; steps and feign.  You could get it at 15 or something and the distance you<br/>\n&gt; throw the enemy could be skill based...  And quite considerable at high<br/>\n&gt; levels. =)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;      Also....  Is there anyone out there who plays Xegony who is<br/>\nabsolutely<br/>\n&gt; swamped with spare platinum and has nothing to do with it?  I need armor<br/>\nso<br/>\n&gt; badly...   things that con white to me may as well con red..<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Darkanano, 8th circle monk, Newbie Of Eternity, of Xegony.....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Congratulations GENEVINCENT.
