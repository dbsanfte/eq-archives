His earring is well sought after so he doesn&#39;t live too long...<br/>\n<br/>\n*********** REPLY SEPARATOR  ***********<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 8/26/99 at 1:35 PM <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ahnorth@...\">ahnorth@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ahnorth@...\">ahnorth@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The Barbarian&#39;s name is &quot;Hadden&quot; and he is a very rare spawn near the Lake in Qeynos hills. Either that, or he takes a long time to respawn, since he is seldom there.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Be warned that the faction hit you take from killing him is VERY heavy. He also does not always have the Fishbone Earring, compounding the problem. The person I talked to who did kill him, said it took 3-4 times to get the earring, and many Merchants will still not sell to him.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;FYI the Fisbone Earring is a moderately useful item that grants unlimited water breating and +3 Dex. In my opinion, until there is another way to obtain this item, I would try and buy it from someone, rather than try for it myself. Obviously, though, most people will not want to part with it once they get it ;-( Expect to pay a premium price...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;             Free Games & Cash Prizes!<br/>\n&gt;Gamesville - The World&#39;s Biggest & Best Game Show Site!<br/>\n&gt;        <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/ad/gamesville0\">http://www.onelist.com/ad/gamesville0</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
