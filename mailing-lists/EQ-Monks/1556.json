The cap for human monk swimming is as you have<br/>\n&gt;stated. Lizards are better swimmers innately and begin with swimming<br/>\n&gt;mastery. The first poster is using some software package (ShowEQ or<br/>\n&gt;something similar) to display a numeric value for his skill. In answer to<br/>\n&gt;the first poster&#39;s question, you will not be able to improve your skill<br/>\n&gt;beyond 120 until you reach a level that allows you to progress beyond that<br/>\n&gt;skill (level 24 in this case).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Best,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;j<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
