A great place to buy things is either GFay<br/>\n(Kelethin) or at the bank in North Freeport.  A lot of high level folks sell<br/>\ntheir wares there.  The Bracers of Erollisi are a lore item, so you can only<br/>\nwear one.  I&#39;m probably going to buy one today.  I&#39;d considered getting<br/>\nanother Serp Bracer, but I think I&#39;d rather have the 5AC and 5 STR.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  &gt;Jagged bands (ac5 3str) 30-50pp from Unrest<br/>\n&gt; Not sure where Unrest is..<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Unrest is located in Dagnor&#39;s Cauldron, which you get to from the<br/>\nButcherblock Mountains on Faydwer.  It&#39;s a pretty good place for people all<br/>\nthe way from level 13-40 or so.
