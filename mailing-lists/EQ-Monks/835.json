The Monk <br/>\n&gt;is the 2nd best puller in the game. The best puller <br/>\n&gt;is one that no one has mentioned yet: The Bard. The <br/>\n&gt;reason the Bard is the best puller is because of <br/>\n&gt;Kelin`s Lugubrious Lament (Lull), Kelin`s Lucid <br/>\n&gt;Lullaby (AoE Lull), and Selo&#39;s Accelerando. Bards can<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;use the spells to pull EXACTLY one Mob and then <br/>\n&gt;hightail it back to the group. If they do pull more <br/>\n&gt;they can use Kelin&#39;s Lullaby to keep them occupied or<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;just haul ass to zone. All in all, if you have a Bard<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;that knows what he is doing, they are the best <br/>\n&gt;pullers.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Try this in sol b or lower guk...you end up with a <br/>\ndead party or if you&#39;re lucky one at a druid/wizard <br/>\nevac point. :)  Bard songs get resisted and most <br/>\nof their crowd control type songs have a hard level<br/>\nlevel cap that they don&#39;t work beyond.  (Charm for <br/>\nexample is capped at lvl 37 mobs...I forget the other <br/>\ncaps.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Bard songs are invaluable at higher levels though. I <br/>\n&gt;would choose a Bard (that knows what they are doing) <br/>\n&gt;over a Shaman/Druid/Paladin/Ranger if possible.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m operating under the assumption that the player <br/>\nknows what they&#39;re doing...if that&#39;s not the case <br/>\nthen no class works. :)  To be honest I have never <br/>\nseen a full 6 person party that I can&#39;t make *better* <br/>\nby taking out the bard.  They are basically weak <br/>\nenchanters when you get right down to it.  Enchanters <br/>\ndo what they do only better.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n=====</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
