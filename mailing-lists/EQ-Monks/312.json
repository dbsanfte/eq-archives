Try to get SOW <br/>\n&gt; &gt; from someone - offer a druid or shaman a few gold and say that you will <br/>\n&gt; &gt; come to them, or try and find one and ask while you are there... If you <br/>\n&gt; &gt; stay between the trail and the inn (directly west of where the trail is), <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Giants will rarely bother you. Kizdean Gix is mean, but never bothered my <br/>\n&gt; &gt; monk...  I usually roam around the hills surrounding the inn, and stay <br/>\n&gt; &gt; close enough to the zone to make a run...  Other than than, bind yourself <br/>\n&gt; &gt; to Qeynos and take the boat to Wisp (Kerra) Isle...  Find out where the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; wisps spawn and camp there with a few other people...
