You will probably be better off with leather at first, at least as far as ac goes.  By the time your level starts getting into the teens you should have","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-85105105\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt; Hail Fellow Monks,<br/>\n&gt; �� This is my first time as a monk and I have several questions.� Any<br/>\n&gt; help would be great appreciated.<br/>\n&gt; �<br/>\n&gt; 1. I know that will less weight we have a higher AC.� But where is the<br/>\n&gt; balance of weigh and armor.� Am I better off with all Leather because<br/>\n&gt; of its higher AC or and I better off with all cloth because of its<br/>\n&gt; lower weight?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>You will probably be better off with leather at first, at least as far<br/>\nas ac goes.  By the time your level starts getting into the teens you<br/>\nshould have replaced it all with mesh.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; �<br/>\n&gt; 2.� When I am ready to upgrade armor from either cloth or leather<br/>\n&gt; armor, depending� on the answers I get for number 1, what should I<br/>\n&gt; get?� I know there is netted, mesh, and woven but what is best to get<br/>\n&gt; first?� What are the advantages of each?� <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Mesh is best, woven second best, netted worst.  Only real difference is<br/>\nthe AC.  Get mesh whenever you can, either buy it from other players, or<br/>\nget it from the Gaz and higher frogloks in Guk.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; �<br/>\n&gt; 3. When I am ready where is the best place to get magic gloves?� <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Guk is the place, or buy netted, woven, or mesh gloves from a player.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; �<br/>\n&gt; 4. When I hit level 17 and get feign death how many points should I<br/>\n&gt; put into it?� Should I just put one and then start it and sit there<br/>\n&gt; till it maxes or won&#39;t that work?� <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>You probably dont need to train it at the guild, but on the other hand,<br/>\nyou&#39;ll probably not have anything else to do with the training points<br/>\nanyway.  I trained mine up until I thought the price wasn&#39;t worth it.<br/>\nThen sit somewhere and max it out.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; �<br/>\n&gt; 5.�What am I forgetting about?� What is important for me to remember<br/>\n&gt; or keep held back for later?� Should I save all my practice points for<br/>\n&gt; one thing?� Etc...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>I use my practice points on the new skills as I reach the necessary<br/>\nlevel, because there&#39;s nothing else i want to use them for.  You dont<br/>\nneed to though.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeani on Veeshan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
