The magnitude of this effect increases with level (at level 50 it<br/>\nwill be a 15% delay reduction). The haste effect STACKS with item and PC buffing<br/>\nspeed effects.  In essence a level 50 monk with a haste sash will be dual<br/>\nwielding 15dmge 25 delay puppies (in the form of his fists).  Monk fists<br/>\ncurrently are about 15dmge 36 delay weapons - at level 50.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) One handed blunt patch: call it Nunchuck patch:<br/>\nAbashi has also been quoted on the message board as saying that in the future<br/>\n(afew months down the line) monk only 1handed blunt weapons will be implemented<br/>\n: they should proc and offer us more diversity.  No word on whether the haste<br/>\neffect on our fists will carry over to one-handed blunt.  I doubt it will<br/>\nhowever.  I suspect that the 1handed blunt weapons will be implemented to give<br/>\nus more variety.  You know switch to &quot;nunchucks of stunning&quot; for extra<br/>\ninterrupts when fighting casters, or &quot;nunchucks of slowing&quot; for proc&#39;ing snare<br/>\nwhen in a dungeon.  Who knows there may introduce a godly nunchuck of<br/>\nASSWHOOPing that is a 10 dmage 12 delay type thingy... (of course it will only<br/>\nfound in the plains)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
