There is no way to escape a mob without<br/>\n&gt;zoning.  Mobs are faster than PC&#39;s.  Mobs can hit a PC from a greater<br/>\n&gt;distance.  Mobs are more resistant to magic.  Mobs have more HP than the<br/>\n&gt;average PC of the same level.  Mobs do more damage than the average PC of<br/>\n&gt;the same level. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>[yada yada yada]<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Mobs have<br/>\n&gt;twice as much mana as a PC of their level.  Mobs have faster casting times.<br/>\n&gt;MOBS HAVE MORE FRIENDS.  It is much harder to resist a mob&#39;s spell.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[yada yada yada]<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;IS THIS FAIR?<br/>\n&gt;IS THIS RIGHT?  WE CAN&#39;T EVEN RUN AWAY! HELL, MOBS ARE THE SUPERIOR RACE!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And yet, somehow, PC&#39;s always win. Always. There is not a single mob in the<br/>\ngame that players haven&#39;t beaten or will beat very soon. Not one.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust because you can&#39;t do it solo doesn&#39;t mean the game is unbalanced. If<br/>\nyou could solo Vox, teaming up with just one other person would make the<br/>\ngame completely boring.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo mobs have, in a roleplaying sense, unfair advantages? Sure. So what?<br/>\nPC&#39;s beat them anyway. Verant has had to make mobs tougher, in fact,<br/>\nbecause players were besting them too easily.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   Moving to a game like Shadowbane ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sb.drtwister.com\">http://sb.drtwister.com</a> )  , where he<br/>\n&gt;can CRUSH people instead of &quot;MOBS&quot; that are ridiculously more powerful than<br/>\n&gt;himself.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>In the mean time, why not play Ultima Online, power-level a character, and<br/>\nsit just outside of town and PK newbies? Or find a poplular teleport spot<br/>\nin a busy dungeon and &quot;Corp Por&quot; adventurers all day long. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll<br/>\nfind that much easier than fighting NPC mobs in EverQuest.<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------------------<br/>\nMoorgard Ghostfist of Povar<br/>\nSeeker of Virtue</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
