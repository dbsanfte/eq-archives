But I&#39;ve already spent a while camping<br/>\n&gt; &gt; him. He&#39;s meant to span every 72-80 minutes? cause I&#39;d NEVER seen him<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and i&#39;ve spent a couple of lvl&#39;s in there from 16-18 and now a while<br/>\n&gt; &gt; there and he never seems to spawn! Also when you kill him does he<br/>\n&gt; &gt; drop the humerus handled mace every time?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; What about the other mobs? Can you provide information for them liek<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the where they spawn and the times and lvl&#39;s etc? Cause I haven&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; spent much time in misty or runneyeye.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thanks again in advance,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Aedir Swiftstriker<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; DON&#39;T HATE YOUR RATE!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Get a NextCard Visa, in 30 seconds!
