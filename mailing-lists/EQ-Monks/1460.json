I&#39;ve seen a  couple<br/>\nhigher lvl monks solo a spectre very easily using ID, fearing it, then<br/>\nbeating on its back.  One monk of the karana server has claimed to solo<br/>\na hill giant using it. (just can&#39;t remember the name)  Though it is slow<br/>\nto increase I&#39;ve heard that ID can be rather helpful in hte right<br/>\nsituations.<br/>\n<br/>\nZhanjin<br/>\nInnoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Message: 1<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Sat, 18 Mar 2000 19:11:26 GMT<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Thom Green&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:thom_mg@...\">thom_mg@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Skills questions<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;From what I have read, and what I have experienced, FD goes up really slow,<br/>\n&gt; I mean CRAWLING slow.  I put one point in it at 18th (starting me at 18)and<br/>\n&gt; have been hitting it almost constantly, running, waiting, I mean anytime I<br/>\n&gt; remember to hit the thing, and I think it just hit 35.  I hear once it hits<br/>\n&gt; 50, it goes up a bit faster.  If you want to see it work, stand in front of<br/>\n&gt; a green mob that wont agro on you, and preferably won&#39;t move.  and hit ONLY<br/>\n&gt; the ID key, and just keep hitting it over and over and eventually it will go<br/>\n&gt; off on it.  At such a low level, this skill is not going to benifit you in<br/>\n&gt; combat in anyway, for a good while.  Ahh well I know people who have gotten<br/>\n&gt; it to the low 100s but I don&#39;t often hear that it is a great help.  Probably<br/>\n&gt; just as much of a help as a Spell Thrower&#39;s fear spell.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sister Shelza<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: Caza Gaming &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MeCaza@...\">MeCaza@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;Subject: Re: [EQ-Monks] Skills questions<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Date: Thu, 16 Mar 2000 16:49:52 -0800 (PST)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;My FD works great.. has saved my butt HEAPS.. just<br/>\n&gt; &gt;keep practicing like crazy...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Instill doubt.. well, I try to practice and practice..<br/>\n&gt; &gt;don&#39;t see it working.. don&#39;t see it improving either<br/>\n&gt; &gt;*shrugs hopelessly*  but then I said that with Safe<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Fall at early levels too :-))  Now THAT is maxxed<br/>\n&gt; &gt;within 5 mins of gaining a new level :-)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Sneak is very sneaky.. hehe...
