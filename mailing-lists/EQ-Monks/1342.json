Is<br/>\n&gt; it<br/>\n&gt; just the level or their other factors involved?  It seems to me that<br/>\n&gt; only<br/>\n&gt; levels are used to determine how any given NPC compares to a PC.  If<br/>\n&gt; PCs<br/>\n&gt; level is represented as X and an NPcs level is represented by Y.  If<br/>\n&gt; X=Y<br/>\n&gt; then the NPc is Black/White to the PC.  If X&gt;Y the Npc is green or<br/>\n&gt; blue<br/>\n&gt; depending by how much X&gt;Y.  If X&lt;Y then the NPc is yellow or red<br/>\n&gt; depending<br/>\n&gt; on how much X&lt;Y.  If Verant wanted to really cut down on Twinking,<br/>\n&gt; they<br/>\n&gt; could factor in  persons magic items, AC, buffs etc..  The PC may be X<br/>\n&gt; level, but with items and buffs they are in a situation where their<br/>\n&gt; relative power level (Z) places them in X&gt;Y by a wide margin.  This<br/>\n&gt; allows<br/>\n&gt; them to breeze through levels much easier than their non-twinked<br/>\n&gt; counterparts.   &quot;Oh, look, here comes Fippy.  He cons red to me at 2nd<br/>\n&gt; level, but because I am twinked, I can take him with ease and get lots<br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; XP.&quot;  If the cons and XP given  were based on the power level of the<br/>\n&gt; PC,<br/>\n&gt; then the powergamers and twinkers would have to make a choice:  Do<br/>\n&gt; they<br/>\n&gt; keep the really kewl stuff meant for higher level characters or do<br/>\n&gt; they<br/>\n&gt; place the items in sotrage in order to level to the point where their<br/>\n&gt; items<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t matter as much?  &quot;I am a 5th level monk with a Vox and a<br/>\n&gt; Serpentine<br/>\n&gt; bracer, split paw gloves, etc...  I can kill anything in this zone,<br/>\n&gt; but I<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t get any XP.&quot;  (This e-mail was in response to a 5th level monk I<br/>\n&gt; saw<br/>\n&gt; in the Queynos hills who did have a Serpentine and a Vox bracer among<br/>\n&gt; high<br/>\n&gt; level items.)  It would solve some problems, I think.

Equipment is not very helpful for us.  The only thing that would<br/>\nreally help at low levels is AC and hit points.  Getting an additional<br/>\n10 hit points at level 1 gives you about 20% more hp.  AC isn&#39;t that<br/>\nimportant anyway unless you do some MAJOR AC twinking.  For example,<br/>\nthat serp bracer would be worthless to a level 5 character.  The would<br/>\nhave an EXTREMELY minimal advantage over a monk with full cloth.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my thoughts... I had a friend who twinked his monk, level 1 he had<br/>\n2 serp bracers, azure sleeves, foremans, wolf fur slippers, jagged<br/>\nbands.  Still died just as often as without the stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<br/>\nHammeron<br/>\nMonk of Quellious<br/>\nKarana<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nWorlord<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:worlord@...\">worlord@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
