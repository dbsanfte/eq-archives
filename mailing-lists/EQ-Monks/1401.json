I know you can target a corpse<br/>\n&gt; and train ID.  I have set up my sidewinder precision pro, using its<br/>\nprofiler<br/>\n&gt; software, to press #s 1-6 (the skill hotkeys) by just pressing 1 button on<br/>\n&gt; the joystick.  Thing is, I can&#39;t figure out any way to get this button to<br/>\nbe<br/>\n&gt; pressed down over and over (if you hold it down with a rubberband or<br/>\n&gt; similar, it will work once, but wont keep pressing your hotkeys all<br/>\nnight).<br/>\n&gt; Sidewinder doesnt seem to have auto-fire.  I know that gravis makes a<br/>\n&gt; joystick (or is it gamepad?) with autofire but I&#39;d rather not spend a ton<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; money - I already pay 8 bucks a month for this game =P<br/>\n&gt; Has anyone put some thought into this?  Anyone ever created a<br/>\n&gt; button-presser?  Let me know what you folks think - I&#39;d rather not spend<br/>\nmy<br/>\n&gt; waking hours pressing hotkeys =)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kyeric </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
