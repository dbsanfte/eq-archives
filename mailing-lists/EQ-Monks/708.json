I <br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t sign up to hear people bitch and moan about twinking and spell <br/>\n&gt; nerfing.  While I&#39;m not positive, I would think that most of you didn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; sign up to hear about it either.  Yet that is what fills up my mailbox day <br/>\n&gt; in and day out now.  Please drop it and lets get back to monks before <br/>\n&gt; anyone else is alienated from what used to be a worthwhile list.  If it&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; really an issue for you, just create EQ-Twinkers and EQ-Nerfs mailing lists <br/>\n&gt; and carry on there.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Dorath<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
