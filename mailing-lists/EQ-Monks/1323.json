The bars would cost 10pp.<br/>\nIf you can assemble the materials and find a nice enchanter,<br/>\nthey might be willing to make these for you for very little.<br/>\nThey should end up costing you 30pp max.<br/>\n<br/>\nShort of the Diamondine Earrings (ac2 3agi 15hp), Obsidian<br/>\nHoops (ac2 3agi 3int) and Fishbone (waterbreathing),  these<br/>\nearrings are probably the best there is.  I&#39;m switching out<br/>\nof the amber ones I have now as soon as I can find a shop<br/>\nthat sells topaz.  Anyone know a shop??<br/>\n<br/>\nThe necklace is pretty good if you can&#39;t find or afford a<br/>\nCollar of Undead Protection.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nClarity Harvestmoon,<br/>\nKarana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
