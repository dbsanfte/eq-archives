But remember that most of your time spent grouping<br/>\ninvolves a monster pull, barsh some heads, you go down 40% life, the<br/>\ncleric heals you up, you go pull again.  The monk will lose roughly<br/>\nthe same amount of HP, (thus greater %HP), regen hp just as fast, and<br/>\nbe pulling again just as fast.  In times when the warriors full hp<br/>\nare needed for him to live, the monk can FD and live, and in<br/>\ngood steady groups, the greater warrior hp don&#39;t matter that much.<br/>\n<br/>\nFD pulling is slow, and its much more efficient to just bring them<br/>\nall and mez or just blast through the pack.  FD pulling is still very<br/>\ngood, but it is not the best way to gain xp fast, my opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Beandogy dog&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:beandogydog@...\">beandogydog@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am thinking of starting a monk or warrior.  The main deciding factors for <br/>\n&gt; me are how much hp each have and how many hits they can take.  Can monks <br/>\n&gt; take more hits than warriors if they use mend and have high agility?  Which <br/>\n&gt; can dish out more damage up until level 30 or so?  Thanx for any answers in <br/>\n&gt; advance.  i am kind of leaning towards warrior though since all the bad <br/>\n&gt; stuff i heard about FD now.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
