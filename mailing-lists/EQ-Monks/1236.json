Read further at your own<br/>\nrisk]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBrother Muhammed,<br/>\n<br/>\nA slight variation for your early hunting to consider. The advice presented by<br/>\nImari is very well thought out, and mirrors much of my hunting strategies. The<br/>\nvariations I would propose involve levels 12 through 14 and later Levels 22<br/>\nthrough 25. After your adventures in Misty Thicket up to level 12, take your<br/>\nhunt to either the rolling hills of the West Commons or explore the world and<br/>\nhead to Erud&#39;s Crossing. For the next three levels, try hunting willowisps<br/>\nexclusively; your hunt will require gloves that are magical in nature, so be<br/>\nsure to equip them before you proceed with slaying wisps. You will get a fare<br/>\namount of experience, and you will also receive plenty of platinum from the<br/>\nadventure. Lightstones, you can generally sell to other players for 1 pp.<br/>\nGreater Lightstones, you can take with you to North Karana. In that zone is a<br/>\ngypsy camp. If you talk to the right gypsy she will request these Greater<br/>\nLightstones in exchange for a book (it is a container, so make sure you have<br/>\n1st level inventory slots available). The books can then be resold to her<br/>\nfor 7<br/>\nto 8 pp or you can take them back to your home guild and assuming your faction<br/>\nis high enough, sell them for 9 pp. Other players will offer you from 5 to<br/>\n7 pp<br/>\nfor your Greater Lightstones. I would save them and exchange them en masse<br/>\nwith<br/>\nthis gypsy for the Concordance of Research (the book I mentioned). This quest<br/>\nwill also grant you substancial experience for these levels. Turning in<br/>\nLightstones will earn you experience as well, but the item you receive in<br/>\nexchange can only be resold for a few silvers, so it is far better to sell<br/>\nthem<br/>\nto other PCs when you find them. Greater Lightstones are not stackable, so you<br/>\nmay want to make sure you have plenty of back packs and room in the bank. You<br/>\ncan save the stones in your vault until the time has come to deliver them to<br/>\nNorth Karana. Again, the item you receive from turning in your stones is a<br/>\ncontainer, so I would recommend taking four backpacks full of stones and<br/>\nkeeping your other inventory slots free for the Concordance of Research. You<br/>\nwill have to exchange them four at a time, but each time you empty a backpack,<br/>\nyou can sell it to the same gypsy so that you have another inventory slot<br/>\nfor a<br/>\nConcordance.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other variation in the hunt involves the hunting of Aviaks. As many on<br/>\nthis<br/>\nlist know, I, as a follower of The Tranquil, am opposed to the hunting of any<br/>\ncivilized creature that does not first attack you unprovoked, many may<br/>\ndisagree<br/>\nwith this stance. It is up to each individual to decide how best to follow the<br/>\nway of Quellious. However, if during these levels, you are passionate about<br/>\nhunting solo, I would recommend the Ocean of Tears. There is an island there<br/>\noccupied by Greater Skeletons, Gargoyles and four Spectres. The Spectres keep<br/>\nto themselves at the top of the island, so they are usually not trouble unless<br/>\na druid is busy kiting them around (so be prepared to feign on a moments<br/>\nnotice<br/>\nif you are not alone on the island). The Gargoyles will provide you with an<br/>\nabundant prey for the hunt. The only problem is that they share the spawn with<br/>\nthe Greater Skels, so you will have to waste some time between engagements<br/>\nwith<br/>\nGargoyles removing these pesky skeletons. Also, the Gargoyles drop gargoyle<br/>\neyes as loot. These items are stackable, and if you should return them by the<br/>\nstack to your guild merchants and your faction is at its maximum for them, you<br/>\nshould receive just about 9 pp per eye. A stack of 20 then, will serve you<br/>\nwith<br/>\na tidy sum of 180 pp. Make sure that before you make the trip to the Ocean of<br/>\nTears, you load up on bandages. The Gargs have duel weild and double<br/>\nattack, so<br/>\nit is not uncommon to be hit three times in one round for up to 40 damage a<br/>\nhit. If you have not practice mend and bind wound religiously every level,<br/>\nthen<br/>\nyou will get plenty or practice here : ). I usually travel to any place with a<br/>\nsingle eight slot container. Half of which I fill with bandages. You may find<br/>\nother alternatives more to your benefit.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhatever you may choose for your hunt, I wish you well.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Quellious&#39;s name,<br/>\n<br/>\nManjushri<br/>\nBearer of the Red Sash of Quellious<br/>\n(Fennin Ro soon to be elsewhere)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------------------------<br/>\nJohn N.
