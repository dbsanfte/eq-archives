There are several ways to <br/>\n&gt;raise<br/>\n&gt;this:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;1)<br/>\n&gt;Increase your str.  I play a level 45 paladin aswel.  His melee skills <br/>\n&gt;capped at<br/>\n&gt;level 40, so his attack rating stopped going up EXCEPT when I got new <br/>\n&gt;equipment<br/>\n&gt;for him...Equipment that raised his STR. I like grouping with shamen or Druids<br/>\n&gt;because with then in the group I can get my ATTCK above 900 if I yalup.  THis<br/>\n&gt;DRASTICALLy reduces the amount of misses I get.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;2) Wolf form or any other state altering spells - enchanters get werewolf <br/>\n&gt;form -<br/>\n&gt;gives them 30 str! massive AC and HUGE attack rating buff (but of course they<br/>\n&gt;cant melee anyway).  The ONE time in my EQ life when I saw my attack <br/>\n&gt;rating hit<br/>\n&gt;999 I was grouped with a level 49 shaman, level 43 bard and 50 druid. wolf <br/>\n&gt;form,<br/>\n&gt;str, Bard song and yalup stacked and my attack when through the roof!!!  I <br/>\n&gt;loved<br/>\n&gt;it!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>note that it is just *part* of the ATK rating which helps your to hit <br/>\nroll.  gordon posted<br/>\nthat they combined the to hit portion of ATK with the max damage/chance to do<br/>\nmax damage portion back in beta.  so when your str goes up, you are really <br/>\nchanging<br/>\nyour max damage and chance to hit max damage.  altho i am thinking back to my<br/>\nad&d days where strength affected your to hit roll as well, heh.  oh well, <br/>\ni believe<br/>\ngordon says str does NOT affect to hit but i didn&#39;t save any of those old <br/>\nposts cuz<br/>\ni&#39;m not into min/maxing or being a roll player.  i&#39;d rather just hang out <br/>\nand have fun<br/>\nand meet people (although i&#39;m not a huge role player either, heh).</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
