I get bored to death with ICQ and chats and all that<br/>\nstupid crap!!  Its not even about talking...its about doing something<br/>\ntogether....the working together.  We don&#39;t have anything to do<br/>\ntogether besides talking about &quot;well so have you talked to dad lately? <br/>\nor how&#39;s mom doing?&quot;  BORING!!!  BUT when we are in EQ we fight mobs<br/>\ntogether and I trust him completely..he is my brother!  I love him more<br/>\nthan anyone.  We just don&#39;t have much to say and this way its like he<br/>\nlives near me and I can do things with him all the time.  Last time I<br/>\nsaw him...we sat and played diablo all day or something.  This is<br/>\nsomething we enjoy doing together!  And for your info..yes I have been<br/>\nin Lower guk fighting and carrying on a coversation with him....guess I<br/>\nam just multi-tasking...or something.  <br/>\n<br/>\n--- Robert Hillyer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:robhillyer@...\">robhillyer@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If the only reason you and your brother talk to each other is because<br/>\n&gt; you<br/>\n&gt; are both in EQ than you have a serious relationship problem. You<br/>\n&gt; could chat<br/>\n&gt; in e-mail or ICQ but you say you dont have the time. For your own<br/>\n&gt; brother?<br/>\n&gt; Yet you go ingame and use it like a chat room, doing nothing but<br/>\n&gt; sending<br/>\n&gt; messages back and forth. You can&#39;t tell me you are in Sol B fighting<br/>\n&gt; whatever while you chat with him. I&#39;ve tried carrying on<br/>\n&gt; conversations while<br/>\n&gt; fighting and it doesn&#39;t work real well. So you sit in game and chat<br/>\n&gt; but you<br/>\n&gt; have no time to sit out of game and chat. With your own family.....<br/>\n&gt; That<br/>\n&gt; doesnt make EQ more than a game, just a game with a chat<br/>\n&gt; feature......<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nThousands of Stores.
