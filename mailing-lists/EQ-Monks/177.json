Don&#39;t apologize!  This has been really on my mind <br/>\nfor the last several days.  One of the things I accepted when I <br/>\nbecame a monk was that I wouldn&#39;t really &#39;come into my own&#39; until <br/>\nlevel 30 when Flying Kick became available - at which point I could <br/>\nstart being a more serious contributor to how the party functions. <br/>\nWell, now that I&#39;m less than a bubble from that turning point, Verant <br/>\nupdates warriors in such a fashion so as to make monks a clearly <br/>\nsecond-class melee type.  Consider the following notes regarding some <br/>\nof the skills afforded each class:<br/>\n<br/>\nMend: Monks get it, warriors do not.  With a successful mend, we have <br/>\nabout as many HPs available to me as a warrior of a similar level. <br/>\nNeedless to say, we do not always have mend available, so we are <br/>\ntypically at a disadvantage in terms of hit points.  Result: Healers <br/>\nwould rather have warriors around because they don&#39;t have to heal <br/>\nthem as often (all else being equal).<br/>\n<br/>\nTaunt: Monks don&#39;t get it, warriors do.  Result: Casters would rather <br/>\nhave a warrior around when they are getting beat on.<br/>\n<br/>\nArmor: Monks don&#39;t get it, warriors do.  Result: All sorts of neat <br/>\nbonuses and stat boosters not available to us.<br/>\n<br/>\nWeapons: Don&#39;t get &#39;em (from a pracitical perspective).  Result: All <br/>\nsorts of interesting effects we don&#39;t get to throw around.<br/>\n<br/>\nExtra Magic Resistance: Monks don&#39;t get it, warriors do.  Result: We <br/>\nare far more vulnerable to magic attacks than warriors are.  Team <br/>\nmembers don&#39;t like this because they have to rush to your aid more <br/>\noften.<br/>\n<br/>\nCritical hit: Monks don&#39;t get it, warriors do.  Result: A warrior I <br/>\ngroup with  (who is lower level than I am) REGULARLY criticals in the <br/>\n70-90+ range.  I can&#39;t expect to hit in the 90s until I&#39;m level 45+ <br/>\n(16 levels from now) and even then, it&#39;ll be a rare occurrence off of <br/>\na special attack.  Where once we had a rough parity in the amount of <br/>\ndamage we could do, this has been completely destroyed with the last <br/>\npatch.<br/>\n<br/>\nMonks get more hits: I don&#39;t buy it.  A warrior and a ranger I often <br/>\ngroup with multi-hit just as often as I do and since they are using <br/>\ncool double-weilded weapons, they do much more damage per hit. <br/>\nBesides, the theory that more hits help break up a caster&#39;s <br/>\nconcentration also does not hold water.  Any decent NPC (level 25+) <br/>\nwill recover their concentration 9 times out of 10 and finish the job <br/>\nanyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThere is more, but I&#39;m running the danger of getting myself a <br/>\nlittle too worked up about this.  The bottom line is that I feel as <br/>\nif monks have been cheated by a too-generous tweaking of warriors. <br/>\nAm I way off-base here, or do others feel as I do?<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nAaron Braunstein<br/>\nPacific Data Management, Inc.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aaron_braunstein@...\">aaron_braunstein@...</a>&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
