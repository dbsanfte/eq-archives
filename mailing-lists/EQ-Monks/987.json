And if you think it makes the game too easy, I strongly <br/>\nencourage you to go to PoH and try to see what it would be like w/o monks <br/>\npulling.  Impossible.  Sure a group of maybe 50 lvl 50s could do it, but <br/>\nwhenever you get more than 24 ppl in an enclosed area fighting mobs, you <br/>\nnormally have 1/6 of the ppl goin ld. And it get worse as you add more ppl, <br/>\nso plz tell me how anybody could do it, I&#39;m more than willing to listen.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
