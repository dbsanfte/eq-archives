Skill and level are what its all<br/>\nabout.<br/>\n<br/>\nAC/MR/HP. PERIOD.  Dex gear helps when you get a weapon that procs (love<br/>\nthat wu trance stick!), but still its not that big of deal....  It won&#39;t be<br/>\nlong before you just cannot carry this extra stuff around. I&#39;m at 14 weight<br/>\nright now, with a box of abu-kar..... I really wish they&#39;d lossen that up at<br/>\nhigher levels. Adding 1hb weapons can push you over the edge pretty quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\nStonedorn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Cameron Oltmann [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Gremmik@...\">Gremmik@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, September 07, 2000 3:57 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@egroups.com\">EQ-Monks@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ-Monks] Crescent Armor<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy Groups | EQ-Monks Main Page | Start a new group!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re going to want two suits, at least.  For soloing, you want AC and<br/>\nresistances first, then str etc.  When you&#39;re in a group with good<br/>\ntanks/healers, you want strength first.  The reasoning behind this is<br/>\nsimple.  When soloing, you want to make it as hard as possible for them to<br/>\nhurt you.  When in a group, you can concentrate on damage rather than<br/>\ndefense since you won&#39;t be taking the hits if there are decent tanks in the<br/>\ngroup.<br/>\nMy defense gear includes things like ac rings/earrings, symbols of loyalty<br/>\nto vox, etc, all as light as possible.  My offense gear is strength<br/>\nrings/earrings, hero/erollisi bracers, etc.  Yes, it puts me over my weight<br/>\nlimit (the hero bracer is 4 weight all by itself), but it&#39;s not really a<br/>\nconcern if I&#39;m not getting hit.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: David Frascone<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq-monks@egroups.com\">eq-monks@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Thursday, September 07, 2000 8:45 AM<br/>\nSubject: [EQ-Monks] Crescent Armor<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I&#39;ve been fighting in Dalnir&#39;s for a while now (about two weeks, off<br/>\nand on), and yesterday, I stumbeled upon THREE pieces of Crescent:  Gi,<br/>\narms,<br/>\nand slippers.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe slipers are a no-brainer, since I had been wearing cured silk.
