Best thing for a monk to do would be to get <br/>\nthat cured silk or mesh, which ever is more redily available and then just <br/>\nsave and wait for good items to present themselves at good costs.

The best equipment he could save up for right now would be:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Onyx earrings (2 agi) 5pp or so from Blackburrow<br/>\n&gt;Spiked collar (ac3 3str) 5pp or so from Blackburrow<br/>\n&gt;Lockjaw vest (ac12 5sta) 20-30pp from Oasis<br/>\n&gt;Bracer of erolisi (ac5 5str) 25-30pp from Ocean of Tears<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The Wu&#39;s gauntlets is not worth the money for him right now.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;To be perfectly honest, Shelza, cured silk can stay in a lot of locations <br/>\n&gt;on a<br/>\n&gt;monk until he or she hits the planes.  Swap out to gear that gives you <br/>\n&gt;better<br/>\n&gt;AC/HP than cured as you can afford it, but it&#39;s only going to make a<br/>\n&gt;marginal improvement in combat performance for each piece of armor you<br/>\n&gt;trade out. Levels and skills are what this game is really about.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Clarity Harvestmoon,<br/>\n&gt;Karana<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
