I don&#39;t think<br/>\njust Kick is but you get Round Kick at such a low level (before you even<br/>\nneed to consider taking on magic-only enemies) that you don&#39;t really have to<br/>\nworry about your special attack being magical, just need to worry about your<br/>\nhands.  I also heard rumors about your attacks being magical at level 17 but<br/>\nI would think most would have looked for magic gloves by then anyway, so I<br/>\ndon&#39;t really know, and I suspect it&#39;s false.  If anyone knows this rumor to<br/>\nbe true or false, please reply :)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
