A. Dellimore&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ijad@...\">ijad@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I for one think that the issue of Monk balance is not as clear cut as<br/>\n&gt;improving the damage/dely of our fists.  i think there are other things<br/>\n&gt;you need to look at. Monks below level 35 are quite well balanced I think:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;1)DUEL WEILD/DOUBLE ATTACK:<br/>\n&gt;You must bear in mind that at for any level, monks have higher DW<br/>\n&gt;and DA skills than all other groups (even warriors).  Thus we get more<br/>\n&gt;attacks than they do in an average round.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;2)FLYING KICK IS COOL:<br/>\n&gt;Furthermore, our Flying kick a VERY deadly attack - hitting for more<br/>\n&gt;damage than most Warriors can muster even with BIG (slow hitting) 2Handed<br/>\n&gt;weapons.  I have seen level 35 monks Kicking for 90dmge or more.  Sure<br/>\n&gt;some of the new SUPER weapons weildable by warriors are 35dmg/45delay and<br/>\n&gt;could probably hit for 90 or more a pop in the hands of a good Ogre<br/>\n&gt;warrior, but think about that - there are only one or two of these weapons<br/>\n&gt;on MY SERVER - (tarrew marr) and no one lower that level 45 even has one<br/>\n&gt;of them!  I myself have only seen one of these things in all mytime in<br/>\n&gt;everquest.  I cannot be jealous of something that is that rare and suited<br/>\n&gt;for players that much higher level than me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;3) SUGGESTION???<br/>\n&gt;Let us be more scientific in our determination of the true class balance.<br/>\n&gt;Everyone should download and use the new eqlog_parser program<br/>\n&gt;(avaialable form  EQCVAULT -www.eqvault.com) and run a check<br/>\n&gt;on their damage dealt vs the damage dealt by all others in their group.<br/>\n&gt;(compare your damge to hybrids and warriors of comparable level to<br/>\n&gt;yourself) and see if you still think we need a damage upgrade.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;4)WHIRL WIND DAMAGE:<br/>\n&gt;Most people out there recognise that monks are a virtual wirlwind of<br/>\n&gt;flying fists and deadly kicks doing more damage during a fight than a well<br/>\n&gt;equipped warrior of our level.  I have a friend (non-monk) whose<br/>\n&gt;philosophy is that 2 monks ==one nuker in a group, and he is always<br/>\n&gt;encouraging me to group with him.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;5) EASY OF PLAY:<br/>\n&gt;Another consideration into monk balance is that after you collect your<br/>\n&gt;last item of mesh armor and perhaps an evil eye bag or box of abukar, you<br/>\n&gt;have no new items to collect - you dont have to worry about cash or<br/>\n&gt;camping as much as say paladins or other classes where items and LONG<br/>\n&gt;DREARY camps are needed just to get equipment to stay alive.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;THE ONLY BITING ISSUE AS I SEE IT:<br/>\n&gt;After level 35 however we monks see no new skills.  Of course we get<br/>\n&gt;better at our skills with each level - but unlike casters who have new<br/>\n&gt;spells, or hybrids who continue to get skills added into levle 40, leve 35<br/>\n&gt;is the last real improvement to our class.<br/>\n&gt;I am not sure what there is to look forward too after 35?<br/>\n&gt;What is there to drive me on to that next great level ?<br/>\n&gt;Where is the glory in being a level 45 monk when a level 35 monk can do<br/>\n&gt;everything you can (and probably even has the same equipment as you)?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Suggestions:<br/>\n&gt;To spice up monk life after level 35, I suggest doing the following:<br/>\n&gt;introduce a new monk only weapon like NUN-CHUCKS (just an example)<br/>\n&gt;Make them hard to get (like one or two groups of level 40 players), and<br/>\n&gt;NO-DROP. They should be the OUTRIGHT FASTEST (17 delay?) weapons in<br/>\n&gt;the game and duel weildable.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;A nice twist would be to give them a HANDY damage ratio such that they did<br/>\n&gt;slightly more max damage than a monk with his fists, but also had better<br/>\n&gt;delay.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Allow them to enhance our blocking ability - attacker takes 10-20 points<br/>\n&gt;of damage when we succesfully block thier attack (hey! being blaocked by<br/>\n&gt;some hard-wood nunchucks is going to HURT!)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;And lastly give them slight chance to STUN our opponent - like<br/>\n&gt;paladin bash only slightly longer lasting maybe?  It will not be a spell<br/>\n&gt;per say, just the shock of the damage dealt would cause disorientation in<br/>\n&gt;any opponent.  This will be good against casters and allround usefull for<br/>\n&gt;saving damage 9stunned opponents do not attack.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;This would give monks in the 35+ category something to look forward to and<br/>\n&gt;drool about. also anyplayer with a pair of these weapons will earn the<br/>\n&gt;respect and awe of all other players, monk and non-monk a like! Think of<br/>\n&gt;the damage dealt per round! think of the number of round you will get in!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;On Thu, 2 Sep 1999, Seamus McNeill wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Seamus McNeill &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:smcneill@...\">smcneill@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Yes it is silly that any weapon out there has a faster delay than our<br/>\n&gt; &gt; fist&#39;s.  Even if it is a lightweight weapon....the whole reason a blunt<br/>\n&gt; &gt; weapon or slashing weapon does damage is because of the windup and <br/>\n&gt;swing.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Fists however are just straight forward....no extra weight off any<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sort...unlike a weapon.  The only thing i can see maybe being faster is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; small piercing weapons such as dagger&#39;s, dirk&#39;s, stiletto&#39;s and so on.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sligo<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Cazic Thule<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;              Free Games & Cash Prizes!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Gamesville - The World&#39;s Biggest & Best Game Show Site!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;         <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/ad/gamesville0\">http://www.onelist.com/ad/gamesville0</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;              Free Games & Cash Prizes!<br/>\n&gt;Gamesville - The World&#39;s Biggest & Best Game Show Site!<br/>\n&gt;         <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/ad/gamesville0\">http://www.onelist.com/ad/gamesville0</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
