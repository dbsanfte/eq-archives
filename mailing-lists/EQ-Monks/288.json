In the Qeynos area you can<br/>\ntravel to BlackBurrow (&quot;BB&quot;), the entrance to which is on the Eastern side<br/>\nof the Qeynos Hills Zone. Gnolls there are good hunting from levels 7 to 15,<br/>\nmore or less. The area is famous, and justly so, for &quot;Trains&quot; so stay near<br/>\nthe zone border at first. Also, strongly suggest you NOT go in hollow tree<br/>\nto the left of cave exit as you go into BB, hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nGrimmoir<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; OK.  I am a 7th level monk travelling through the Qeynos area on the new<br/>\n&gt; Tribunal server.  I&#39;ve run into a stump, though.  It seems to me that<br/>\n&gt; everything in the area is now either conning green or conning yellow (few<br/>\n&gt; and far between).  However, if I go to different zones, it&#39;s instant red<br/>\n&gt; cons.  Any suggestions on getting over this level hump? </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
