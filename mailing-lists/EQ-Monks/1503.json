My camp times were <br/>\ndifferent than most though:<br/>\n<br/>\n1)\tGorge Alchamist, *no camp time*.  He spawned twice while I was<br/>\n\tfighing Gorge Minotaurs for exp.<br/>\n<br/>\n2)\tGelatinous cube, *no camp time*, but I had to have a friend invisi<br/>\n\tme so I could go get him.  At 24th, he was a risky blue, not too<br/>\n\tmuch trouble.  (but almost ran out of air!)<br/>\n<br/>\n3)\tMisty Alachamist: 10-12 hours camp time.  This little guy just<br/>\n\twould *not* spawn for me.  At first, I kept turnning in beads to try<br/>\n\tto get a squad ring, but eventually, that started getting as<br/>\n\ttedious as camping itself.  When he finally did spawn, he was <br/>\n\t*very* green.  I lost about a bubble of health killing him, without<br/>\n\tmending.<br/>\n<br/>\n4)\tGoblin Captian: 9 hourss camp time.  I could not believe this guy<br/>\n\ttook so long to spawn.  I lost two lives to Borxx, and had much <br/>\n\ttrouble with him.  At 24th, a full group of mid-low 20s would have<br/>\n\tno trouble holding the king/captian room, but all of my friends got<br/>\n\tvery tired of camping him.  So, eventually, I ended up feigned on<br/>\n\tthe floor benieth the captian . . . couldn&#39;t split him either . .<br/>\n\tfinally, a guild mate came along and split him for me.  He was<br/>\n\trisky blue (prolly 20-21) and went down fast.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, after much camping, I have the prized, but not worth the camp time, <br/>\nTreant Fists.  Now I just have to go kill another wisp for a light stone.<br/>\nOr, continue to carry my Wu&#39;s Gauntlets instead :)<br/>\n<br/>\nLater,<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLimberouch Wasabii<br/>\nRed Belt, Black Headband, 24th degree<br/>\nTarrew Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
