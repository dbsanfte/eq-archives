In EQ, there&#39;s not supposed to be a BEST class.  Each and<br/>\nevery class will have its ups and downs, and, in the end, we all need each<br/>\nother.  Sure, there might be imbalances at times, but I don&#39;t think you&#39;re<br/>\ngoing<br/>\nto find a lot of groups refusing you just because you&#39;re a monk.  If they<br/>\ndo,<br/>\nyou probably didn&#39;t want to group with them anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I love playing a monk.  Not because we&#39;re the BEST class in the<br/>\ngame<br/>\nor do more melee damage than anyone else, but because the monk class is one<br/>\nof<br/>\nthe most unique classes in the game.  Who else dishes out as much damage as<br/>\nwe<br/>\ndo with their bare hands?  Who else has as much AC as we do while wearing<br/>\nplain<br/>\nlooking clothes? (Yes, I _like_ looking ordinary.)  Who else has a cool<br/>\nflying<br/>\nkick?  Who else (besides rogues) can jump from Kelethin and survive?  For<br/>\nme, <br/>\nplaying a monk is enjoyable not because I&#39;m the best figher in the game, but<br/>\n<br/>\nbecause monks are unique and fun to roleplay.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut then, that&#39;s just my opinion.  Go forth, and form your own.<br/>\n<br/>\nFaeaani<br/>\nLevel 22<br/>\nInnoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nONElist members are using Shared Files in great ways!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nAre you?
