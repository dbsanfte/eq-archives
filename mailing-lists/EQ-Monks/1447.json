As far as instill <br/>\ndoubt goes, its the hardest skill I have ever had to raise.  I hit the <br/>\ninstill doubt button constantly, targeting anything I can, and I think mine <br/>\nis like 35th.  And the key to getting it to work is make sure the ONLY thing <br/>\nyou are doing to your target is auto attack, no special attacks, and your <br/>\nspecial attacks button has to be up (Tiger Claw, etc) and then hit your <br/>\ninstill doubt.  Now, chances are the next result you will see is it telling <br/>\nyou &quot;You aren&#39;t scaring anyone&quot;.  Hehe if you are REALLY lucky and get it to <br/>\nwork (I think I have gotten it to work like 3 or 4 times), it should have <br/>\nthe same effect as the 4th level necro spell, and make them start to run <br/>\naway for 10-30 seconds.  Only you don&#39;t get the nifty flying skulls.<br/>\n<br/>\nSister SHelza<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Currey, Mick&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mick_currey@...\">mick_currey@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: &quot;&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a>&#39;&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: RE: [EQ-Monks] Skills questions<br/>\n&gt;Date: Thu, 16 Mar 2000 12:03:36 -0600<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Make sure to stop attacking for a sec before you fd.  Then it should work a<br/>\n&gt;lot more than it fails at lvl 70 skill.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sneak is fantastic when you are the scout and mapping out a new dungeon.<br/>\n&gt;When other characters would get wiped out, you can sneak past guards.  <br/>\n&gt;Hehe,<br/>\n&gt;when that fails, you just fd.  Works out great.  (You haven&#39;t had fun till<br/>\n&gt;you scout out a dungeon full of red mob&#39;s with another monk.  You and the<br/>\n&gt;other monk can sneak around, fd when needed, then find lower level mobs to<br/>\n&gt;wipe out before the red ones find you.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Someone else will have to answer about instill doubt.
