The only &quot;campers&quot; we got were newbie magicians<br/>\nneeding something the fairie guards dropped.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou may complain these are both camped but nothing like I&#39;ve seen SK get<br/>\nbetween gnolls and aviaks - some nights it looks like Greater Faydark, over<br/>\n100 people and /ooc & /shout spamming, at least on Quellious.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd Highkeep is so.... small.  Plus, the KSing that runs rampant in HH pass<br/>\nseems to leak in to the hold the few times I was there.  The only good thing<br/>\n- guards and bank are just upstairs.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, for the bold and brave...  Get a group up and you can hunt inside the<br/>\ncave in Feerot, I gained 3 bubbles of experience killing spectres and<br/>\nCindrella in about 4 hours last night (At level 36)  Cindrella has a nasty<br/>\nDOT but we used the /duel trick to circumvent any experience loss. (The DOT<br/>\ndoes about 600 damage in 1 minute).  But if the specs don&#39;t con blue to your<br/>\nentire party, I would advise against this route.  It&#39;s a nice place if you<br/>\ncan get in there - the word is out more and more about it, but only one<br/>\ngroup showed up the entire time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know this started as a solo list...  But the exp and fun I can have in a<br/>\ngood group far outweighs anything I can do solo.  If I wanted to solo, I&#39;d<br/>\nplay Ultima Online.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnonymous Monk of Quellious<br/>\nQuellious<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Worlord [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:worlord@...\">worlord@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, March 08, 2000 4:27 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ-Monks] Hunting Guide?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Worlord &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:worlord@...\">worlord@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHere has been my hunting so far, when I find a place I like I tend to<br/>\nstay there!<br/>\n<br/>\n1-4\t\tWest Freeport<br/>\n4-6\t\tNorth Ro (Beetles around Inn)<br/>\n7-10\t\tNorth Ro (Spiders and Snakes)<br/>\n10-14\t\tEast/West Commons (Orcs and Dervs)<br/>\n14-17\t\tOasis (Crocs and Orcs)<br/>\n17-20\t\tEast Karana (Gnolls)<br/>\n20-25\t\tSouth Karana (Aviaks and Gnolls)<br/>\n25-30\t\tHigh Keep<br/>\n30-32\t\tSolusek&#39;s Eye A<br/>\n<br/>\nI will probably be staying in SolA until at least 35<br/>\n<br/>\nHigh Keep rules at 25 because a bank is so close, gets old quickly<br/>\nthough<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<br/>\nHammeron<br/>\nMonk of Quellious<br/>\nKarana<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nWorlord<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:worlord@...\">worlord@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nDON&#39;T HATE YOUR RATE!<br/>\nGet a NextCard Visa, in 30 seconds!
