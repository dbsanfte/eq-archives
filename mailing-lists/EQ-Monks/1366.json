Though I <br/>\nknow there is probably some people out there, that even if they didn&#39;t play <br/>\neverquest, the idea of Twinking would still keep them up at nights.  Arguing <br/>\nabout it, whether it is for or against, is counter productive.  So get on <br/>\nwith it, and instead of typing flames on the mailing lists, you should be in <br/>\nthe game playing your character.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nShelza, Karana<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: James W Hooper &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhooper@...\">jhooper@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: RE: Re[2]:[EQ-Monks] Experience and Twinking<br/>\n&gt;Date: Fri, 11 Feb 2000 09:01:18 -0500<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;At 08:21 AM 02/11/2000 -0500, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Bennett, Brian&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:BRIAN.BENNETT@...\">BRIAN.BENNETT@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;It&#39;s sorta funny to see morals are getting involved now.
