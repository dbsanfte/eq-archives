If your game is to run around and<br/>\nacquire items, it is a camp game.

You say the word &quot;fix&quot;, which implies something is broken (not<br/>\nworking as designed). Well, that simply is not the case, things are working as<br/>\ndesigned. I just choose not to be constrained by those choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, I did read your whole post, and I did not choose your words out of context,<br/>\nyour post is anti-twinking, I choose phrases to illustrate that.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvilJohn<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Lombard.Mikhael&quot; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Lombard.Mikhael&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Mikhael_Lombard@...\">Mikhael_Lombard@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That is what I am speaking of, and you should really read the whole thing<br/>\n&gt; before taking words out of context, I am not twinked I have received<br/>\n&gt; everything I have through my own hard work, and  but as for twinking I do not<br/>\n&gt; twink nor do I let it affect my enjoyment<br/>\n&gt; of my gaming experience. As for playing, I play with my roommate on our DSL<br/>\n&gt; line and we have a blast, plus we play with the same group of about 12<br/>\n&gt; people so I do not know where you feel your the only one who enjoys being<br/>\n&gt; with people that you have known for more than just the life of the game.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: John Carney [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jcarney@...\">jcarney@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, September 15, 1999 8:29 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EQ-Monks] Twinking thoughts (whatever)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: John Carney &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jcarney@...\">jcarney@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Nice spread&quot; - &quot;Worked damn hard&quot; - &quot;nothing to look forward too&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Whatever.  These are all words and phrases that bother me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think I&#39;m going to throw up all over my cloth shoes. I have a some twinked<br/>\n&gt; items, no doubt about it. Among my favorites are the Serp Braces given to me<br/>\n&gt; by<br/>\n&gt; a dear real life friend when I first broke level ten.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Do not presume to tell me how to enjoy MY game paid for with MY MONEY. If<br/>\n&gt; your<br/>\n&gt; idea of fun is waiting around, camping out a certain area for some piece of<br/>\n&gt; equipment, be my guest, but DO NOT ASSUME everyone else has that same sense<br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; fun.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I do not, and never will attach any amount of significance to the<br/>\n&gt; acquisition of<br/>\n&gt; items THAT ARE NOT REAL. If I could play this game naked, without any<br/>\n&gt; inventory<br/>\n&gt; at all, I would. This is one of the reasons I choose the Monk class. I<br/>\n&gt; detest<br/>\n&gt; the idea of running all over the universe begging to group with some other<br/>\n&gt; players, using each other to just get a new piece of armor. If I were forced<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; do that, I would not be &quot;around too much longer&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As it stands now, I am having the most fun leveling my monk, attempting to<br/>\n&gt; reach<br/>\n&gt; a point in the game where I can adventure with my friends who purchased the<br/>\n&gt; game<br/>\n&gt; two or three months before I did. I want to play with them, sitting in their<br/>\n&gt; office till 3 am, playing on their T1, drinking beer, while we all are<br/>\n&gt; gaming<br/>\n&gt; Together, not merely on the same server.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Stonedorn - Xegony - 15th Oval<br/>\n&gt; ---------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; John M.

That would solve a lot of<br/>\n&gt; those<br/>\n&gt; &gt; problems, but in my real opinion, I just really love this game, it may be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; because I am still so new, haven&#39;t even got past my first month and my<br/>\n&gt; 19th<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (almost 20th Level) Monk is my pride and joy. I really enjoy when people<br/>\n&gt; &gt; look at my gear and say nice spread, I worked damn hard for my stuff and<br/>\n&gt; it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is my own personnel satisfaction I get from my character. If I see someone<br/>\n&gt; &gt; else who is twinked, I think that&#39;s good for them, I hope they enjoy that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; because I know they will enjoyment of the game for they have nothing to<br/>\n&gt; look<br/>\n&gt; &gt; forward too, so those people won&#39;t be around too much longer.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Kaladiel<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 19th Season<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Brell Serilius<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Bennett, Brian [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:BRIAN.BENNETT@...\">BRIAN.BENNETT@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Wednesday, September 15, 1999 6:04 AM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [EQ-Monks] Twinking thoughts, continued<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Bennett, Brian&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:BRIAN.BENNETT@...\">BRIAN.BENNETT@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I have to agree with Praelor.  I don&#39;t know *why* twinking bothers me.  I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t deny it is perhaps partial jealousy.  Hell yes I would like level<br/>\n&gt; 40+<br/>\n&gt; &gt; armor to start out with!  I&#39;m level 20 and I&#39;d take it now!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; But I think what really gets me is the unfair (And it is) advantage that<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; twinkers get over a non-twinked same level person.  Now perhaps that the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; advantage is more of a psycological thing.. i.e. I *think* they have a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; better chance than me.  But I feel that if I&#39;m standing beside a level 20<br/>\n&gt; &gt; monk with high level gear and me with my low level gear, I feel like the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; monk is going to be able to fight better and for longer without downtime<br/>\n&gt; &gt; because of his ill gotten gear.  I haven&#39;t seen any &quot;studies&quot; to back up<br/>\n&gt; my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; feelings, but it just makes sense to me :)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; And I don&#39;t want to open the &quot;If you want better gear go get it&quot; can of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; worms.  I get the best that me and my group can get.  In a group of 10-12<br/>\n&gt; &gt; people, we have to balance out quest items - it&#39;s only fair.  So that is<br/>\n&gt; not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; an option, so to speak.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Simple solution (And I like it no matter what anyone says)  Make gear<br/>\n&gt; start<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to have a level requirement.  If that &quot;Glowing Baseball cap of Might&quot;<br/>\n&gt; comes<br/>\n&gt; &gt; from a level 40 MoB, then only a level 35+ can wear it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I think the thing that bothers me the most about EQ is the money<br/>\n&gt; situation.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The greed factor has almost turned it into a UO-type situation.  I realize<br/>\n&gt; &gt; this is a total tangent, but how many of you have actually had to turn OFF<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the auction channel on a non-bazaar day?  I hate it.  I hate greed.  I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; &gt; level 20 and I have 15 pp to my name.  But that&#39;s just me and I could be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; stupid :)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Back to the twinking issue, I see one more factor:  My over developed<br/>\n&gt; sense<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of injustice.  If I had to work so hard to get what I have, what gives Mr.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Twinkee the right to get everything handed to him?  Actually, now that I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; think about it, it is the sense of injustice.  Jealousy is just a<br/>\n&gt; mitigating<br/>\n&gt; &gt; factor :)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     GRAB THE GATOR!
