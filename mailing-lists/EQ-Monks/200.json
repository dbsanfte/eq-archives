It disturbs me too, because I&#39;d <br/>\nalways heard and believed that monks were supposed to be the melee machines, <br/>\nable to heap massive damage upon foes. And the price we paid was crappy hit <br/>\npoints, very few cool toys, bad armor, and a weight restriction. <br/>\n Now, however, warriors seem to do similar damage to us. At least at lvl 35, <br/>\nthat&#39;s what i&#39;ve seen. (Maybe past lvl 40, the balance shifts? I haven&#39;t been <br/>\nthere yet, so I can&#39;t say.) And with none of our weaknesses. Oh, sure, they <br/>\ncan&#39;t mend -- but so what? They have many more hp&#39;s than us to start; they <br/>\ndon&#39;t need a mend. And yes, we can fight with our bare hands -- big deal! <br/>\nWhat warrior ever has to? What advantage is it to fight without weapons (or <br/>\nto not need them), really? Monsters don&#39;t disarm!  It seems we pay a big <br/>\nprice for being monks, and as far as being useful to a party, don&#39;t get much <br/>\nof a return. <br/>\n Sure, being a monk might offer unique possibilities  -- but being able to <br/>\njump from Kelethin bank only carries so much novelty... i&#39;d much prefer being <br/>\nable to contribute something meaningful and unique to the game.<br/>\n Well, there&#39;s my rant on the subject. Sorry if it sounds a little bitter, <br/>\nbut I sometimes wonder why i&#39;ve put so much labor into a character (and <br/>\nclass) that Verant seems so willing to leave by the wayside...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCatsup,<br/>\nCazic Thule</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
