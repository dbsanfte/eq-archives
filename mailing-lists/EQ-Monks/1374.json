AS i am now bored of reading about twinking...i thought i would pose a question out to my higher level brothers and sisters.  This weekend, i competed in a guild scavenger hunt and won.  My prize was a Staff of Writhing and a Crested Helm.  My level is only 10 right now and i know this is kinda expensive/rare stuff, especially the helm.  My question is what do you think i should trade for? Because i have no clue.  Following is a list of my equipment that i already have:<br/>\n<br/>\nForeman Tunic (borrowed)<br/>\ncloth sandals<br/>\nmammoth leggings (borrowed)<br/>\ncloth cape<br/>\ncloth arms<br/>\nserp bracer (borrowed), mesh bracelet<br/>\nJagged band ( borrowed )<br/>\nBand of flesh<br/>\nmesh neck<br/>\ncloth cape<br/>\nWu&#39;s Gauntlets<br/>\ncloth shoulders<br/>\nSplitpaw mask<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess that is about it....i have a friend who is going to make me cured silk all i have to do is get the heady kiolas.  Hopefully you guys can lead me in the right direction. Thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nMuhammed<br/>\n10th level brother of the Ashen order<br/>\nXegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
