Most of the other abilities that I can think of off-hand<br/>\n&gt; seem to have progressed beyond that except at an extremely slow rate<br/>\n&gt; of progress.  Speaking as a recent achiever of level 46, I can say<br/>\n&gt; the following with some confidence:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - After the last 30 hours of play, my Defense has gone up a single<br/>\n&gt; point (to 211) - and I&#39;ve spent almost the entire time being the<br/>\n&gt; exclusive tank to a nearly endless parade of blues.<br/>\n&gt; - I don&#39;t remember the last time I saw Flying Kick go up.<br/>\n&gt; - Offense seems to keep going up at its normal rate of speed (now in the<br/>\n220s).<br/>\n&gt; - The last number I saw out of Dual Wield was 252 - and that was some<br/>\n&gt; time ago.  It&#39;s possible that it went higher (perhaps all the way to<br/>\n&gt; 255) and I just didn&#39;t notice it, however.<br/>\n&gt; - Mend seems to still be progressing, but again is an extremely slow<br/>\n&gt; progress so I may have capped that as well - not that it matters<br/>\n&gt; becuase it&#39;s been over 20 levels since it&#39;s failed.<br/>\n&gt; - Progress on Feign Death continues, although I haven&#39;t been working<br/>\n&gt; on it as much as I perhaps should lately so it still is languishing<br/>\n&gt; in the 190&#39;s.<br/>\n&gt; - Disarm is still moving into the 170s as well, but don&#39;t ask me why<br/>\n&gt; I bother - a disarmed opponent doesn&#39;t seem to be a whole lot less<br/>\n&gt; dangerous than an armed one.<br/>\n&gt; - Instill Doubt is the singularly most useless and dangerous (to us,<br/>\n&gt; that is) skill in our arsenal and I haven&#39;t bothered to skill it up a<br/>\n&gt; single point since acquiring it at level 29 (which is where I was<br/>\n&gt; when the patch went in which supports it), so I can&#39;t really speak on<br/>\n&gt; that one.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; While my current rate of progress is annoying, it doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; really bother me.  However, I&#39;m becoming rather concerned about my<br/>\n&gt; Defense and Flying Kick.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve capped them, but the<br/>\n&gt; rate of progress is disturbingly slow.  I really don&#39;t want to<br/>\n&gt; out-level my skills and thereby be rendered useless in a group of<br/>\n&gt; like-leveled people (as so many power-levelers have found).

That<br/>\n&gt; is GMT -5:00 for international monks. :)This will be an<br/>\n&gt; ongoing event until Sunday Night. Play as little or as<br/>\n&gt; much of that as you want to.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Story: An evil gnome wizard experimenting with cloning<br/>\n&gt; captured a lone human monk in Freeport, and tried to<br/>\n&gt; clone him. He inadvertently triggered a chain reaction<br/>\n&gt; and suddenly there spawns many many many monks. All<br/>\n&gt; identical. Being of one mind they are also all of one<br/>\n&gt; guild, &quot;The Armadillos of Norrath&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Naming: This is an event in which monks from all<br/>\n&gt; servers who may know each other from messageboards will<br/>\n&gt; participate. Therefore I think it is a great idea that<br/>\n&gt; we use the naming convention &#39;&quot;your real monk<br/>\n&gt; name&quot;dillo&#39;. Or a variation thereof. Such that I am<br/>\n&gt; going to be Ipnodillo on vallon zek for the weekend. ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Goal: Have fun. Group up with as many monks as you can<br/>\n&gt; and run around the zone punching everything in site. Go<br/>\n&gt; on suicide missions. We&#39;ll be like ants.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To participate, create a new monk on Vallon Zek Friday<br/>\n&gt; Night. The monk should be the male version with the<br/>\n&gt; Priest of Discord face. We&#39;re gonna try to create a<br/>\n&gt; guild for this as well, so look for a guild officer to<br/>\n&gt; invite you. Please try to keep your guild tunic on at<br/>\n&gt; all times so we have the monk &quot;look&quot; about us. Invite<br/>\n&gt; all your friends to attend. This is an event to have<br/>\n&gt; fun, not so heavy on the roleplaying, but lets just<br/>\n&gt; have a LOT of fun.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To clarify, your monk should look like this:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shada.com/pod.jpg\">http://www.shada.com/pod.jpg</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The guild has been submitted. Lets all hope verant<br/>\n&gt; approves it!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Invite your non monk friends who have always admired<br/>\n&gt; your monkness as well! Lets try and make this event a<br/>\n&gt; legend of it&#39;s own kind! :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Just think. Hundreds of Identical Newbie Monks...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ipno Ashen<br/>\n&gt; 20th Armadillo<br/>\n&gt; Brell Serilis<br/>\n&gt; &quot;The future just isn&#39;t what it used to be.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; This mail sent through newave.net webmail.
