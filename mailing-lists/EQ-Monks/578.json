These are generally not a <br/>\nthreat, but to weakened parties or individuals soloing (or getting their <br/>\ncorpses), they can constitute quite a problem. And, with the exception of the <br/>\nevil races, being attacked by the good frogs is entirely a problem of one&#39;s <br/>\nown creation. I enjoy the fact that, since I never killed the good frogs in <br/>\nupper guk, I can walk by them with impunity.<br/>\n Moreover, &quot;killing just one frog in lower&quot; does not automatically make you <br/>\nKOS. During some emergency situations, I have been forced to kill live frogs <br/>\nto help wounded party members who were being attacked by the lives near the <br/>\nzone (in lower.) I have never been other than dubious to them.<br/>\n And yes, the lives in Upper Guk aren&#39;t much of a threat anymore when you&#39;re <br/>\nable to go to Lower. But since we can&#39;t invis, it can still be a pain to have <br/>\na train of frogs all chasing you to the zone (even if most of them miss.... :)<br/>\n<br/>\nCatsup Bustardo,<br/>\nCazic-Thule</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
