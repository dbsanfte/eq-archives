I have a level 21 druid who<br/>\nbeen twinked.  I believe that I have the right to twink this character,<br/>\nhere is why:<br/>\n<br/>\n1)  The money I invested into this character was my own.  My money which<br/>\nI earned, therefore I have the right to *technically* spend it as I<br/>\nplease.  I chose to spend it to purchase items with the intent of<br/>\nstarting another character.<br/>\n<br/>\n2)  I did not camp any spawns to twink this character, all of his item&#39;s<br/>\nwere purchased through bazaar&#39;s or were items off my main character<br/>\nwhich I no longer needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are many ways to look at twinking.  My view is that there is<br/>\nnothing wrong with it.  Perhaps there is something wrong with camping<br/>\nitems for the sole purpose of twinking but I do not think this can be<br/>\navoided without removing a interesting part of the game.  Being able to<br/>\ntwink allowed me to start a character and be able to move quickly<br/>\nthrough the lower levels.  I had invested the time and effort into<br/>\nmaking a non-twink main character.  Why shouldn&#39;t I with the money I<br/>\nhave earned to start another character off with some pretty decent<br/>\nequipment.  Yes, it does remove some fun out of the game.  Your always<br/>\n&quot;twinked&quot; in that you never had the joy of earning that first pp or<br/>\nbuying those +2 wis rings out of your own money but thats a personal<br/>\ndecision.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only way that twinkers stop normal gameplay is by farming items. <br/>\nAside from that being twinked will only help you level faster.  You will<br/>\nnever see a group shout in the oasis: &quot;Highway Group looking for Tank<br/>\nlevel 14-17, TWINKS ONLY&quot;  It just doesn&#39;t happen, never will.  Unless<br/>\nyou do some SERIOUS twinking, like full crafted and mithril 2 hander on<br/>\na level 15 warrior won&#39;t be that much better than a non-twinked.  Sure<br/>\nyou WILL be better, but you are losing a certain part of the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe main reason I twinked my druid was because when my monk got boring I<br/>\nwould have another character I could play who is very different from my<br/>\nmonk and I would not have to earn all the money.  Call me wrong, flame<br/>\nme, do what you will but Verant will NOT stop twinking and there is not<br/>\nmuch we can do about it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGood day to you all<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<br/>\nHammeron<br/>\nMonk of Quellious<br/>\nKarana<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nWorlord<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:worlord@...\">worlord@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
