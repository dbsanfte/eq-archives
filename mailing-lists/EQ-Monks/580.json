The sneering are 24 up to 28-  (pretty<br/>\nsure) and the Flouting are 31 to 35 (not one green-all blue-to my level 42<br/>\ncleric- level 30s are green).<br/>\n<br/>\nMistmoore is know for it&#39;s trains.  Worst train tracks I&#39;ve ever seen- if you<br/>\nare 20s-30s pull to the top of the lake, 30-high 30s stick to the graveyard, 40+<br/>\ngo into the castle.  This way you are out of the range of most trains.  Most of<br/>\nthe trains come screaming out of the castle through the tunnel entrance because<br/>\nthe level 40+ PC jumped from the bridge that connects the from and back fo the<br/>\ncastle (by the lake).<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, if you are 30+, this zone has a lot of great items and great exp.  This<br/>\nis the one zone that I can say for sure has not been fully explored yet<br/>\n(although there are some parts of Sol A & B that are pretty untouched still<br/>\ntoo).  There are just so many hidden tunnels here.  The other thing is that<br/>\neverything is agro (unless you are in wolf form, then only a few are agro),<br/>\nunless you have not fought here and there is no racial/religion faction hits.<br/>\nI&#39;m sure a bunch of dark elves could walk through this whole zone without<br/>\ngetting attacked, but I&#39;ve never seen it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Flouting Gargs also appear in Lower Guk, btw.<br/>\n<br/>\nDaclawn<br/>\n8 lvl Monk<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;In reply to:<br/>\n&gt;From: &quot;Ezhar Montenegro&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Ezhar@...\">Ezhar@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: Nybright Sisters and taking the lives of our fellow man<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;Mistmoore gargoyles that I fought/saw when Level 26 (in group):<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;Grinning - blue-ish<br/>\n&gt;Sneering - white-ish<br/>\n&gt;Flouting - red, red, red...<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;Not sure of the Flouting level, but 2 were pulled to the zone line by a party<br/>\n </span></blockquote>of 40ish &gt;players, along with other Castle nasties.
