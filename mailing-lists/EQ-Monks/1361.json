As a monk this is really easy to do as monks dont have anything to spend money on but good armor.  By the time I was 10th level, I had over 100 plat saved, by the time I reached 18th I had bought and sold over 1000 plat worth of stuff, all done by money and items I have earned myself by selling loot or trade skills.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;Shelza, 18th, Karana.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sparx Dreamreaver<br/>\nLevel 36, Karana<br/>\n- Resists&#39;R&#39;Us -</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
