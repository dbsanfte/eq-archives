I think mobs<br/>\nin dungeons have a higher percentage chance of not returning (hence the fd<br/>\npull).<br/>\n<br/>\ntips for using it:<br/>\n1) wait till after your hit.  do hit fd right when a mob is swinging, if<br/>\nthey hit you, they will see past fd.<br/>\n2) wait till after a caster blasts you (same reason)<br/>\n3) turn off auto attack for a few seconds (so you dont hit them) before<br/>\nyou hit fd<br/>\n4) (I think I&#39;m the only one to do  this)  jump away from the mob right<br/>\nbefore you hit fd.  got to time it right.  this way, you are out of range,<br/>\nand so are they.<br/>\n<br/>\nwhen I first got it, it saved my life onece, then killed me.
