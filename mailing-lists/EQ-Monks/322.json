(Actually it<br/>\nwas extremely funny to watch, since he died after one punch, and he kept<br/>\nshowing up for more... :-)  Anyway, the only way he was able to establish a<br/>\nrapport with the guild again was to kill lots of orcs.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m a Ashen Order monk by birth.  When I travelled to Qeynos I killed lots<br/>\nof BlackBurrow gnolls and had no problem joining the Silent Fist.  I never<br/>\ndid the Tomer or Konem quests, I just showed up with a bunch of gnoll pelts<br/>\nand was on my way.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf these things I am sure of... However, I don&#39;t know what kind of<br/>\ndifference your religious beliefs may have.  I&#39;m a believer in Quellious and<br/>\nthat may make some difference...<br/>\n<br/>\n- Chris<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ahnorth@...\">ahnorth@...</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ahnorth@...\">ahnorth@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Wednesday, August 25, 1999 7:40 AM<br/>\nSubject: [EQ-Monks] No More Sash Cheats...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ahnorth@...\">ahnorth@...</a><br/>\n </span></blockquote>snip<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;In conclusion, it looks like the only way to truly do the quests now is to<br/>\n </span></blockquote>build your faction with the Freeport monks in some way.
