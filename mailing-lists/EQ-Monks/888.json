My exp has been that if the green <br/>\npets dont jump you then youll want to make it deep in where there are many <br/>\nsafe places to setup and pull to.  We like to setup by the ogre guard camp <br/>\nfire near where the undead frogloks.  We then camp that room and pull the <br/>\ngoblin wizards from around the way. If you go the other way towards <br/>\nbonecrusher etc. instead of going lft into his room go rihgt and down the <br/>\nhall and then take the T left. There are 2 magicians in there and 1 ogre <br/>\nofficer which is good to gang up on etc. Then you can stay there and camp <br/>\nfrom there. Hope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Dizzy J.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dizzyj@...\">dizzyj@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [EQ-Monks] Feign Pulling Yet Again<br/>\n&gt;Date: Fri, 15 Oct 1999 10:46:01 -0500 (CDT)<br/>\n&gt;MIME-Version: 1.0<br/>\n&gt;From errors-200535-886-courtlend Fri Oct 15 08:37:00 1999<br/>\n&gt;Received: from [209.207.164.243] by hotmail.com (3.2) with ESMTP id <br/>\n&gt;MHotMailB9D094F40089D820F3C1D1CFA4F30FA10; Fri Oct 15 08:36:27 1999<br/>\n&gt;Received: (qmail 16524 invoked by alias); 15 Oct 1999 15:36:22 -0000<br/>\n&gt;Received: (qmail 16500 invoked from network); 15 Oct 1999 15:36:21 -0000<br/>\n&gt;Received: from unknown (209.207.164.239) by pop4.onelist.com with QMQP; 15 <br/>\n&gt;Oct 1999 15:36:21 -0000<br/>\n&gt;Received: from unknown (HELO monkey.eliteware.com) (24.219.84.167) by <br/>\n&gt;mta1.onelist.com with SMTP; 15 Oct 1999 15:36:14 -0000<br/>\n&gt;Received: from localhost (dizzyj@localhost) by monkey.eliteware.com <br/>\n&gt;(8.9.2/8.8.7) with ESMTP id KAA00429 for &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a>&gt;; Fri, 15 <br/>\n&gt;Oct 1999 10:46:02 -0500 (CDT)<br/>\n&gt;X-Sender: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dizzyj@...\">dizzyj@...</a><br/>\n&gt;In-Reply-To: &lt;000c01bf16ad$a94e56a0$<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:81dc0218@...\">81dc0218@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Message-ID: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Pine.BSF.4.05.9910151042020.363-100000@...\">Pine.BSF.4.05.9910151042020.363-100000@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Mailing-List: list <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a>; contact <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks-owner@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks-owner@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Delivered-To: mailing list <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Precedence: bulk<br/>\n&gt;List-Unsubscribe: &lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks-unsubscribe@...\">EQ-Monks-unsubscribe@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Is there ANY way to separate mobs that stack one on top the other?
