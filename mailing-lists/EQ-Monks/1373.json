The<br/>\nwoman I think. She will ask you to bring back some gnoll teeth from<br/>\nBlackBurrow (no drop, but stackable). Then, after a lot of teeth, she will<br/>\nask you for some necklaces from ice gobs in Everfrost (was paying 2pp per<br/>\nmecklaces, it was a kind of mini quest for newbies :o)). Then you can go<br/>\nback to Qeynos and speak to another woman warrior in the Arena. She will ask<br/>\nto bring some kobold hide from Toxulia Forest. You can also kill the catman<br/>\nin Erud&#39;s Crossing for the key #17 that you have to bring back to the<br/>\nwarrior who gives the hero bracer quest, and don&#39;t forget to kill some<br/>\nzombies there too because you can loot a tattered map that is a quest for<br/>\nthe same woman warrior in Qeynos (you need a good faction with her first,<br/>\nwith the kobold hide quest). These quests will all give you faction with<br/>\nSteel Warriors.<br/>\nYou need to be high amiably with them. Took me many Dorn&#39;s death (til no<br/>\nmore faction hit, I have killed him my whole life for revenge each time I<br/>\nwas passing by :o)), 100 teeth from BB, 48 necklaces, 24 kobold hide, a key<br/>\n#17 and a tattered map !!! 2 day work.<br/>\n<br/>\nTsin Suchiko<br/>\n41th rank, Tunare.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
