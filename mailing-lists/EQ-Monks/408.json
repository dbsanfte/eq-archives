If you haven t ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-158725180\">Ok I assume you started in the city of freeport<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst you need to get your white training sash.  Level<br/>\n2 and 3 is the ideal time to get it.  If you haven&#39;t<br/>\ngotten it yet I won&#39;t ruin your first quest so you<br/>\nwill have to figure it out for yourself<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the time I was level five I pretty much had a full<br/>\nset of cloth armor.  Cloth is good for your level<br/>\nbecause it is light and fairly cheap, you can buy it<br/>\nin the Freeport Market, the shops near the bank.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou don&#39;t need to worry much about items until level<br/>\n4or5, then I would start heading out.  I would go to<br/>\nthrough east freeport to the desert of ro and fight<br/>\nnear the inn.  You won&#39;t have to worry about being<br/>\nkilled by madmen there and there is a good spawn of<br/>\nbeetle&#39;s and armadillos.   Once you get to 7 you can<br/>\nstart killing orcs and snakes and stuff<br/>\n===<br/>\n- Worlord<br/>\nNews Reporter<br/>\nStarCraft Gurus<br/>\nstacraft.gamegurus.net<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nBid and sell for free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://auctions.yahoo.com\">http://auctions.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
