That would solve a lot of<br/>\nthose<br/>\n&gt; &gt;problems, but in my real opinion, I just really love this game, it may be<br/>\n&gt; &gt;because I am still so new, haven&#39;t even got past my first month and my<br/>\n19th<br/>\n&gt; &gt;(almost 20th Level) Monk is my pride and joy. I really enjoy when people<br/>\n&gt; &gt;look at my gear and say nice spread, I worked damn hard for my stuff and<br/>\nit<br/>\n&gt; &gt;is my own personnel satisfaction I get from my character. If I see<br/>\nsomeone<br/>\n&gt; &gt;else who is twinked, I think that&#39;s good for them, I hope they enjoy that<br/>\n&gt; &gt;because I know they will enjoyment of the game for they have nothing to<br/>\nlook<br/>\n&gt; &gt;forward too, so those people won&#39;t be around too much longer.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Why do they have nothing to look forward to?  Maybe they are second<br/>\ncharacters<br/>\n&gt; trying to get to where his friends are so they can group together.  Maybe<br/>\n&gt; they are<br/>\n&gt; trying to get to places they haven&#39;t seen yet because they would die<br/>\nalmost<br/>\n&gt; instantly.  Some people don&#39;t play the game strictly to get cool items.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Kaladiel<br/>\n&gt; &gt;19th Season<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Brell Serilius<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   New!!
