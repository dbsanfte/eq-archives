I have been practicing non-stop<br/>\nsince I got the skill and it is now at 50, but fighting crocodiles and<br/>\ncaiman, not once has feigning death, whether i fell to the ground or not,<br/>\nstopped them from biting me. Is there something about the use of the skill<br/>\nthat I am missing or is it just not that useful?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
