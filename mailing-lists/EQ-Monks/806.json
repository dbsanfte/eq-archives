And a monk is <br/>\ndang near as good with FD pulling as the druid/ranger<br/>\nthere.  So we have what 3ish dungeons where a monk <br/>\nisn&#39;t the best puller, by a very small amount?  <br/>\nAnd let see: Perma, sol a, sol b, upper guk, lower <br/>\nguk where druid/ranger can&#39;t pull for squat?<br/>\n<br/>\nYes monk&#39;s are the best pullers bar none.  Ask any <br/>\ngroup of 35+s whether they want a monk pulling in <br/>\nsol b or lower guk or anyone else? :)<br/>\n<br/>\n-David<br/>\n<br/>\n=====</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
