Its not the twinking that is the problem<br/>\nhere, its the Kill stealing, spawn hogging Asshole who refuses to show other<br/>\nplayers respect.  Somehow making twinking impossible or difficult will not stop<br/>\nthis type of player.  He might just sell the item on Ebay, or use it to twink a<br/>\nfriends character instead, or &quot;Farm&quot; the spawn for in-game trading purposes. <br/>\nInfact I think 99.9% of the level 50&#39;s hanging out in low level camping spots<br/>\nare NOT doing so because of twinking.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost twinks are started when one character on an account reaches level 50 and<br/>\nthey get bored, or decide to spice up the monotony of their EQ life with a new<br/>\nrace/class selection.  Most of the time what happens is they happen to win a<br/>\nrandom on a class specific Uber item. Or take a look at all the mid - high level<br/>\njunk sitting in their bank account and realize that if they trade this so-and-so<br/>\nfor that so-and-so they could have a fully decked out Troll SK..etc etc.  What<br/>\nhappened with me is that I FINALLY won a random on a haste sash and then<br/>\nrealized that I didnt want it because I would rather have the AC and stat buffs<br/>\nfrom my PoF belt.  So I was going to trade the item then realized there was<br/>\nNOTHING *tradeable* that i wanted in the entire game (all that I needed was the<br/>\nno-drop stuff in the PoF/HATE/SKY)! (except maybe gauntlets of fiery might - and<br/>\nnoone will be trading those for a LOOOOONG time)  So I was faced with the<br/>\nrealization that I had a &quot;worthless&quot; sash sitting in my bank. I realized that I<br/>\nhad a good deal of additional monk uber items kicking around - diamondine<br/>\nearings, and some wolf fur slippers.  So I created inno ( I had always admired<br/>\nmonks) And here I am today.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFact is most of my friends (those who have twinks - and trust me, we ALL do, and<br/>\nI promise you you will too when you get to my level) started twninks in almost<br/>\nexactly the same way.  Ofcourse those people whose main characters were KSing<br/>\nASSHOLEs, will go about twinking in an ASSHOLE-like manner.  My point is that it<br/>\nis the ASSHOLE, and not the twinking that is the problem.  ASSHOLES will be<br/>\nASSHOLES even if they can no longer twink.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nA second way that twinks get started is that a character reaches the high 20&#39;s<br/>\nearly 30&#39;s and realizes they dont like thier class, or that they got their<br/>\nstarting stats all wrong.. and scraps that character donating all of his<br/>\nequipment to the new one they create.  Surely you cant argue that this is wrong,<br/>\neveryone makes mistakes, or changes their mind once in a while.  IF you have 2<br/>\nmonths invested in a character, how can you say it is fair to tell that person<br/>\nthat their new character cannot reap *some* of the benefits of their previous<br/>\nmonths work.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTwinkers RIGHTS!<br/>\n<br/>\nI would say that I have earned my right to twink. ALL of you playing the game<br/>\ntoday, owe me and all the other pioneers a debt of gratitude.  Who do you think<br/>\nwrites all those quest walk throughs?  How is that you came by that knowledge of<br/>\nexactly where that item is dropped?  You take for granted the fact that you can<br/>\nwalk into a dungeon, hang out by the zone and auction for a group, but when I<br/>\nhit level 30 ( and I was one of the first to do - way back in March! ) I spent<br/>\nlots and lots and lots of deaths figuring out the dungeons all over NOrrath. I<br/>\nwas in FuLL Bronze back then and VERY VERY VERY proud of it!  I weilded a Black<br/>\niron Bastard sword (Ghoulbane had not been found yet) and I thought I was DA<br/>\nBOMB! This is NEWBIE gear now a days, largely due to the deflationary influence<br/>\nof the pioneering players trading off their old equipment and discovering the<br/>\nspawns so that everyone knows how/where to camp the items. <br/>\n<br/>\nEvery player today, even the untwinked ones, owes a lot to the pioneers. You can<br/>\nBUY items at a trade bazaar at unbelievably cheap prices, these are the same<br/>\nitems I would have spent HOURS searching for the spawn, or xp dying while<br/>\nlearning how to pull the area.  YOu take for granted the fact that you can pick<br/>\nup a serp bracer for 200pp, a BIBS for 500pp, bronze armor at 6pp a peice! <br/>\nThese were once *status* items that would probably not have even been traded for<br/>\n6 or 7 months ago.<br/>\n<br/>\nExcuse me If I want to just take some of the excess items I have acccumulated<br/>\nover the months ( and once you start going to the PoF/HATE/etc you will start to<br/>\nPILE stuff up!) and creat a Uber character of my choosing!  I have invested 9<br/>\nmonths into my first character, I dont see it as fair to require me to invest<br/>\nANOTHER 9 months in a new one!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n____________________Reply Separator____________________<br/>\nSubject:    Re:[EQ-Monks] Experience and Twinking<br/>\nAuthor: James W Hooper &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhooper@...\">jhooper@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate:       02/10/2000 9:14 AM<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: James W Hooper &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhooper@...\">jhooper@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;____________________Reply Separator____________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Firstly:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;What makes you think &quot;twinking&quot; is a problem that verant wants to curtail.<br/>\n </span></blockquote> They<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;have never, not once made a post, comment editorial, patch or any other<br/>\n&gt;statement in any way about it.
