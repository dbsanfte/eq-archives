Brown&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dbrown5@...\">dbrown5@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Bards are extremely powerful, if they know what they are doing. Most dont.<br/>\n&gt; One of my characters is a 20th lvl bard. My friend plays a 20th lvl<br/>\n&gt; paladin. We dueled in arena the other night and at the end of the fight I<br/>\n&gt; was at full health. This was even after he used hands. He also blinded me<br/>\n&gt; and ran off and hid someplace and healed himself back to full a second<br/>\n&gt; time. It didn&#39;t save him. And yes, we stood toe to toe (except when he<br/>\n&gt; ran hehe) <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In any case, I find this whole thread of monks being master pullers<br/>\n&gt; discouraging. Is this all they are good for at high levels? Is pulling the<br/>\n&gt; only reason they are sought out for groups? Because that hardly sounds<br/>\n&gt; like a fun way to spend time. I play a monk now because I dont have the<br/>\n&gt; patients for long camps. Pulling things for other people to blast doesnt<br/>\n&gt; sound much better :(  Surely there are other things to look forward to as<br/>\n&gt; a high level monk?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -Bethorn<br/>\n&gt; 18th monk, erollisi marr<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Fri, 8 Oct 1999, Dan Gilbert wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; At 08:19 AM 10/8/99 -0700, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;From: &quot;Tim Perkins&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tperkins@...\">tperkins@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Ever wonder why parties always want a monk to pull? Because the Monk IS the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;best puler in the game Bar none.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;          Once again, I am going to have to disagree. The Monk is the 2nd <br/>\n&gt; &gt; best puller in the game. The best puller is one that no one has mentioned <br/>\n&gt; &gt; yet: The Bard. The reason the Bard is the best puller is because of Kelin`s <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Lugubrious Lament (Lull), Kelin`s Lucid Lullaby (AoE Lull), and Selo&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Accelerando. Bards can use the spells to pull EXACTLY one Mob and then <br/>\n&gt; &gt; hightail it back to the group. If they do pull more they can use Kelin&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Lullaby to keep them occupied or just haul ass to zone. All in all, if you <br/>\n&gt; &gt; have a Bard that knows what he is doing, they are the best pullers.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;          However, that all said and done, most Bards are not as adept at <br/>\n&gt; &gt; pulling as Monks are. Monks start honing their pulling skills early on. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Bards, for the most part, never really work on pulling. So, given the same <br/>\n&gt; &gt; skill level and knowledge, a Bard is a better class for pulling. I still <br/>\n&gt; &gt; like a Monk because of the damage they deal. Bard songs are invaluable at <br/>\n&gt; &gt; higher levels though. I would choose a Bard (that knows what they are <br/>\n&gt; &gt; doing) over a Shaman/Druid/Paladin/Ranger if possible.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; ���`�.�.�������.��.���`����`�.�.�������.��.���`�<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;          Dan Gilbert, MCSE<br/>\n&gt; &gt;          Internet Systems Engineer<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;          GGI Technologies<br/>\n&gt; &gt;          P.O.
