The best thing i ever used<br/>\nthem for was feign death, but I think it would have been a better choice<br/>\nto just sit somewhere for 3 hours and get it up.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDisarm i just got, and found that it can be raised quite easily by<br/>\ngiving a weapon to your nearest level 1 monster and then take it back,<br/>\nfeign, get up, then hand it right back, and repeat.  <br/>\n<br/>\nProbably the best use there could be is the trade skills, as someone<br/>\nelse mentioned.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Jacob Jensen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jacob@...\">jacob@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I am a level 7 monk and i have 20 points to spend. Would you<br/>\n&gt; recommend i spend them on offensive skills now, save them for later,<br/>\n&gt; use them on a skill to make money, or use them on throwing. If on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; throwing is it a really good skill to get, does it do any damage or<br/>\n&gt; is it just to attract animals as ive heard. Thanks for your time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; -Krazer, Level 7 Monk, Tunare<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; No matter what, dont use them on offensive skills. Your skills will<br/>\n&gt; max out at each level as you use them. Waste of points. I&#39;ve found<br/>\n&gt; Throwing to be a useless skill as well, only using it rarely to lure.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If I were you, I&#39;d save them for Feign Death at level 17.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyone but me that feels skill points are pretty useless for monks?<br/>\n&gt; Hehe, I mean, after you get feign death, how many skills are left? 4?<br/>\n&gt; 5? And most, if not all, monk skills are used in combat constantly, so<br/>\n&gt; they&#39;ll max out by themselfs.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; *shrug* Might just be me...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --Jake<br/>\n&gt; Aka Laintal Novacek, level 24 monk, Povar.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
