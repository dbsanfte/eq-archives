Try to get SOW <br/>\nfrom someone - offer a druid or shaman a few gold and say that you will <br/>\ncome to them, or try and find one and ask while you are there... If you <br/>\nstay between the trail and the inn (directly west of where the trail is), <br/>\nGiants will rarely bother you. Kizdean Gix is mean, but never bothered my <br/>\nmonk...  I usually roam around the hills surrounding the inn, and stay <br/>\nclose enough to the zone to make a run...  Other than than, bind yourself <br/>\nto Qeynos and take the boat to Wisp (Kerra) Isle...  Find out where the <br/>\nwisps spawn and camp there with a few other people... Good exp through <br/>\nlevel 15 and excellent money...<br/>\n<br/>\nJason<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom:\t%systemroot% [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tschultz1@...\">tschultz1@...</a>]<br/>\nSent:\tTuesday, August 24, 1999 11:11 AM<br/>\nTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject:\t[EQ-Monks] Hunting wisps<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;%systemroot%&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tschultz1@...\">tschultz1@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst post to this list, woo.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m 11th lvl on the Prexus server, and just recently obtained woven gloves.<br/>\nSince I can now actually hit them, I&#39;ve been searching for wisps in E<br/>\nCommonlands and finding maybe one per hour of real time (!).
