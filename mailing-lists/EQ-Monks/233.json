I play Moorgard, a lev 12 Freeport monk on the Povar server. I<br/>\ndon&#39;t have a lot of time to play these days, as I&#39;ve just switched jobs and<br/>\nam getting used to a new routine. As such, level 12 is taking me forever to<br/>\nget through. I hang out in N Ro and East/West Comm a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nI look forward to learning tips from you more experienced monks out there.<br/>\nRight now my main goals are gaining levels and trying to finish a set of<br/>\nmesh armor. Anything else I should be shooting for?<br/>\n<br/>\nI would appreciate any tips you guys have on good boots and where to get them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone else think it&#39;s a real shame that mesh armor looks just like leather<br/>\nwhen worn? If mesh had a grey/silver or black kind of look to it, I think<br/>\nmonks would have a much more unique appearance.<br/>\n<br/>\n___________________________________<br/>\nSteve Danuser       <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:danu@...\">danu@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
