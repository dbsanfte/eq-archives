Then last night, BAM!  Got it to 201, which now allows me to bandage anybody to 70% hps at 75 hps a bandage.  KICK ASS SKILL!  I can&#39;t emphasized this enough.  This means when soloing or grouping w/o a healer type, we can get MAX hps from 1 hp after a fight in at very most, 6 min.  Just bandage up to 70% (can get higher, just can&#39;t bandage after you&#39;ve past the 70% line) and then hit mend, tah dah, full hps.  Just wanted to let all you guys know what&#39;s in store for us  :o)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKanja<br/>\nRodcet Nife</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
