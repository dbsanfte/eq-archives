This came from ack can&#39;t remember his name its one of there<br/>\nprogrammers.    It will not happen that they change the colors until they<br/>\nupper the specs of the game though in order to get the most money and be the<br/>\nmost compatible with the most machine you have to let that guy with a Voodoo<br/>\n1 online as well as bleeding edge equipment.   Its a marketing thing<br/>\ntherefore until they phase out older video cards the color scheme they have<br/>\nis kinda stuck.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did hear someone talking about Ashron&#39;s Call to be honest with you the<br/>\ngame is in kinda over head side view.   The graphics are good but I feel<br/>\nlike they are missing the boat by not giving you the feel of being that<br/>\nactual person.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nTransfer your big list to ONElist and earn $500!<br/>\nFor program details, go to<br/>\n&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/biglist1\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/biglist1</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
