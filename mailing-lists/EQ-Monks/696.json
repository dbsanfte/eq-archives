YOu will see some cyclops and<br/>\nGiant skells mulling around in an area infront of you.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Turn LEFT, HUGGING the zone wall unless you want to get your level 8-20<br/>\nbutt WHoooped!<br/>\n<br/>\n3)You will pass a tent, and right after the tent you will see a<br/>\nmountain ridge.  It does quite reach all the way to teh Zone wall<br/>\nalong which you are sneaking creating something of a &quot;pass&quot; between the<br/>\ntwo &#39;walls&#39;.  YOu want to go through that pass and then cross it to hugg<br/>\nthe mountain ridge on your right  side. (Translation Turn Right after<br/>\ncrossing the pass and Hugg the wall again - This time it wont be the zone<br/>\nwall but the wall of the ridge that youw ill be clinging to)<br/>\n<br/>\n4) You will know you are on the right path if you come across an inn. Buy<br/>\nsells stuff and stock up on food.<br/>\n<br/>\n5) Continue on straight past the inn.  YOu should be coming up on a second<br/>\nmountain pass.  GO through this one and bear slightly left.  you will find<br/>\nyourself in a narrow valley or gully (sp?)<br/>\n<br/>\n6) You should see a Pillar with some bettles/scarabs around them.  THis<br/>\nwill let you konw youare  on the right path.  Continue on running,<br/>\nfollowing the narrow &quot;gully&quot; that you are in.<br/>\n<br/>\n7) Eventually you will see a change in the grennery of to your right - the<br/>\ngrass willl go from green to a mossy grean-brown color.  This is the<br/>\nmrking for the path to Ferrot.  <br/>\n<br/>\n8) NOTE: when you zone across to ferrot there is alot of danger - tehre is<br/>\na undead camp along the zone wall to teh right - You WILL NEED invis vs<br/>\nundead (and SOW) to get past that alive),  Following the path infront of<br/>\nyou leads to a bridge with paths leading to both OGGoK or the zone to<br/>\ninnothule.  BE WARY OF BOUNCERS!  THey are very mean to us goodly races<br/>\nand 2 of them roam the entire ZONE - *sigh I have died many times to that<br/>\ndamned BOUNCER FLERB! *I spit on his grave!*<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway consider yourself warned.<br/>\nGood Journeys to you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 18 Sep 1999 <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:phreddy@...\">phreddy@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:phreddy@...\">phreddy@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; can anyone give me a guide for getting through rathe mountains from the lake rathe side to the feerot side?  thanks<br/>\n&gt; rasmussen lvl 8 monk<br/>\n&gt; liet lvl 20 cleric<br/>\n&gt; gugbug lvl 11 tsk<br/>\n&gt; Velanor lvl 8 necro<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;    <br/>\n&gt; -------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Get personalized e-mail and a web address or your<br/>\n&gt; own free e-mail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.networksolutions.com\">http://www.networksolutions.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
