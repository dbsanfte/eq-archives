I<br/>\n&gt; was in<br/>\n&gt; Najena today trying to pull the Ogre Captain. I&#39;d hit him and run back<br/>\n&gt; out<br/>\n&gt; of the room. He would come along with one of his officers. But they<br/>\n&gt; were<br/>\n&gt; directly on top of each other and they would consistently leave<br/>\n&gt; together.<br/>\n&gt; What am I doing wrong?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks in advance<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s what works on the Ogre Captain, and other groups sometimes:<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, attack one of the monsters in the group and let them all come out<br/>\nafter you.  Fall back a little bit, then feign death.  Wait for all of<br/>\nthem to leave.  Of course, if one stays around so that you can stand up<br/>\nand pull him at this time, do so.  If they wont separate, wait for them<br/>\nall to go back, then get up.  Go back near them, to just inside throwing<br/>\nstar range.  Throw a star at the one you want.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNormally, just the one you throw a star at will come, after the group<br/>\nhas already been pulled out once.  I used this technique very often to<br/>\nseparate groups like the ogre captain, and the shin lord in upper guk.<br/>\nOften I used this process exclusively in upper guk, because i usually<br/>\ndidnt have to wait as long, because i wouldnt need to draw them out<br/>\nhardly at all it seemed to make it work.  I am noticing that recently,<br/>\nhowever, that the technique works less and less.  This might be due to<br/>\nthe fact that i&#39;m fighting different types/levels of monsters, or as a<br/>\nresult of an actual server-side code change.  As far as i can tell it<br/>\nwont work on anything in lower guk for instance.  If you get a group you<br/>\ncan&#39;t separate with a simple feign, give it a try.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
