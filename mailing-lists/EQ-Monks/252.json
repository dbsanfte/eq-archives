I didnt get the kobold boots because of weight, which I<br/>\nthink is 2.5.  However, i have no idea where those slippers came from.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; &gt;I would appreciate any tips you guys have on good boots and where to<br/>\n&gt; get them.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tHeh... I was stuck with Patchwork boots (leather weighed too <br/>\n&gt; much) until about level 27 when I finally got hold of some Kobold <br/>\n&gt; Hide Boots.  I&#39;ve gone through the equipment lists, and besides the <br/>\n&gt; Shiverback stuff, that&#39;s about as good as we&#39;re likely to get. <br/>\n&gt; (Possible exception of the JMan boots, but I&#39;m not going for them <br/>\n&gt; because the AC sucks and they&#39;re one of the most heavily camped items <br/>\n&gt; in the game.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -- <br/>\n&gt; Aaron Braunstein<br/>\n&gt; Pacific Data Management, Inc.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aaron_braunstein@...\">aaron_braunstein@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
