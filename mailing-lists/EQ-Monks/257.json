Burt&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:noahburt@...\">noahburt@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hey there,<br/>\n&gt; Brother Kingdok here again. I received a /tell<br/>\n&gt; yesterday from a concerned party on Erollisi Marr<br/>\n&gt; asking the name of the greedy monk I spoke of<br/>\n&gt; yesterday. I do not feel it is right to post his name<br/>\n&gt; on the lits but if you are on Erollisi Marr and wish<br/>\n&gt; to know his name, email me and I will tell you. I do<br/>\n&gt; not wish people to bother him, that is why I didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; post his name. HE does have the right to be a jerk<br/>\n&gt; even if i do not like it. So please ask only if you<br/>\n&gt; wish to know his name in case you are ever in party<br/>\n&gt; with him or have the chance to be. Please do not<br/>\n&gt; harass him. I do not wish him ill, but I do understand<br/>\n&gt; why people would want to know so that they would not<br/>\n&gt; have the misfortune of having an evening spoiled by<br/>\n&gt; his greed and poor sportsmanship.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; May truth guide you,<br/>\n&gt; Brother Kingdok<br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Bid and sell for free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://auctions.yahoo.com\">http://auctions.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Transfer your big list to ONElist and earn $500!<br/>\n&gt; For program details, go to<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/info/biglistbon_intro.html\">http://www.onelist.com/info/biglistbon_intro.html</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
