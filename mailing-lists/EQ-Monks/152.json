I had the unfortunate opportunity to do a little more experimentation<br/>\nwith FD last night, and have come to a couple conclusions. Perhaps someone<br/>\nout there can add to or refute my findings. Either way would be great!<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe that there are 2 conditions (aside from the &quot;in the middle of<br/>\nattacking/casting&quot; conditions). The first is the level of the MoB being<br/>\nfeigned against. A high level MoB (by that I mean one that con&#39;s red) has a<br/>\ngood chance of seeing thru a successful FD. I say this due to my *insert<br/>\nfoul language here* death against Droon. We had just killed Broon and were<br/>\nheading for the Zone with Droon hot on our tails. He caught up with our<br/>\nenchanter, so I doubled back to get his attention on me while the others<br/>\nkept going. I got his attention, he started hitting me. We had already<br/>\nworked out that if this should happen, the Wizard would cast, pulling Droons<br/>\nfocus, and I would FD, and then he would zone. Worked like a charm. Droon<br/>\nturned to go after the Wiz, I FD successfully (no message), the Wiz zones,<br/>\nDroon comes back and kills me while I am still FD&#39;d. It is my assumption<br/>\nthat he was not fooled due to the fact that he is Red... or perhaps because<br/>\nof my 2nd condition (which I actually find less likely in this case) which<br/>\nis an INT check vs. FD skill. I have noticed that MoBs I would consider<br/>\nsentient (i.e.. creatures that have formed a type of society such as Aviaks<br/>\nor Frogluks) are the ones that continually either return or I have failures<br/>\nagainst.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust for your info, I am 20th with all skills except weapons, kick, and<br/>\nround kick maxed.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny thoughts on this? It is really starting to bug me that the last 2 times<br/>\nI have tried FD, I have been killed by non-casting MoB&#39;s after a successful<br/>\nFD. The only saving grace is that at least the rest of my party was able to<br/>\nescape both times.<br/>\n<br/>\nPraelor Dileasai<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:IBNALNOOR@...\">IBNALNOOR@...</a> [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:IBNALNOOR@...\">IBNALNOOR@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tTuesday, July 13, 1999 10:55 PM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject:\tRe: [EQ-Monks] Feign Death vs. casters and anomolous<br/>\n&gt; failures<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:IBNALNOOR@...\">IBNALNOOR@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Here is my expierence, FD only works if the mobs have completely finished<br/>\n&gt; all <br/>\n&gt; their actions for the round. If you FD and one still has yet to hit you or<br/>\n&gt; a <br/>\n&gt; spell still has to go off against you it does not matter, it will fail. I<br/>\n&gt; do <br/>\n&gt; not know about against DoT and that is an interesting question. I do know<br/>\n&gt; I <br/>\n&gt; have fought the spiders in Guk several times and Feigned successfelly<br/>\n&gt; while <br/>\n&gt; poisoned. And rabies have never seemed to be a problem. I also like the<br/>\n&gt; range <br/>\n&gt; of aggression type suggestion as in my expierences this has proven to be <br/>\n&gt; true. In Guk I have almost always had the stupid frogs come running after<br/>\n&gt; me <br/>\n&gt; when I had Feigned, the spiders on the other hand depend how far away from<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; them I am. Even if I am just over into the next chamber they do not<br/>\n&gt; pursue. <br/>\n&gt; The same in Unrest, Dark Boned Skels to my great surprise did not come<br/>\n&gt; after <br/>\n&gt; me when I got up from a feign, but you can imagine my surprise when the <br/>\n&gt; Barbed Skel did not ignore me and came back and whoopped my rear. Well,<br/>\n&gt; this <br/>\n&gt; is my thoughts on it. I still do not think it is the awesome skill I had <br/>\n&gt; heard of before getting it. I would much prefer to have something that<br/>\n&gt; would <br/>\n&gt; help the rest of the party a little more and not be so much of a simple <br/>\n&gt; self-preservation thing. I know the responses about leading mobs away and<br/>\n&gt; I <br/>\n&gt; have done this, but still those situations are pretty rare. Usually it<br/>\n&gt; ends <br/>\n&gt; out with the call for run going out and me just hitting feign when<br/>\n&gt; everyone <br/>\n&gt; has minimal time to head out the nearest door before I die. As I am only<br/>\n&gt; 20th <br/>\n&gt; level I always looked forward to the views of more expierenced players. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Start a new ONElist list & you can WIN great prizes!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; See homepage for details on ONElist&#39;s new &quot;FRIENDS & FAMILY&quot; program.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
