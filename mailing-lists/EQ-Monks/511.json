I&#39;m a 15th level monk<br/>\nstarting to assemble a nice set of armor, but I&#39;m a bit naive when it comes<br/>\nto jewelry. Which stat is more valuable to raise with jewelry, DEX or AGI?<br/>\n<br/>\nI know agility affects hit points, and the earings I picked up are +2 AGI<br/>\nand that&#39;s great. But I also got a +2 AGI ring, and I was wondering if I<br/>\nshould use it to replace one of my trusty Derv rings which are +2 dexterity.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich affects attack and defense more, dexterity or agility?<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________<br/>\nMoorgard, monk striving for virtue</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
