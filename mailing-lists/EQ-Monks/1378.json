A level 39 necro could take him down solo<br/>\nwith<br/>\nsome difficulty.  Depending on the server you play on he could be camped and<br/>\nso<br/>\nyou might want to bring a good NUKE along to ensure you earn the kill.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first thing to do is raise qeynos warrior guild faction.  Wiat let me<br/>\ntake<br/>\nthat back... the first thing to do is go to www.gameznet.com and print out<br/>\nthe<br/>\nwalk through for the quest.  You have to do a silly quest to kerra isle<br/>\nbefore<br/>\nyou can get the hero bracer quest, and you have to con amiable before you<br/>\ncan<br/>\nget any quests at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nLastly one trick you wil want to know is *how do I make the mino hero<br/>\nspawn?*<br/>\nWell rumor has it that if you kill minos and skeleton by the skelie camp he<br/>\nwill<br/>\nspawn in a matter of minutes (people have gotten 2 spawns an hour with this<br/>\nmethod). <br/>\n<br/>\nTake the shakle off the mino + faction with the warrior guild + complete the<br/>\nfirst &quot;runaway gladiator&quot; quest, and you will get one hero bracers 9ac, 10<br/>\nstr,<br/>\n5 poison, 5 disease.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
