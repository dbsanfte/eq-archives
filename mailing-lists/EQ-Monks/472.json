A question tho... if this is the case, why then do many monks say<br/>\nwe need more damage dealing ability? Because they are not out-damaging<br/>\neveryone in sight? I have no problem with my role in group situations<br/>\nchanging as my abilities change.. Actually I think they should. I know I<br/>\nwould get fairly bored if my role from lvl 1-50 was static. It is the whole<br/>\nreason I dumped my lvl 18 warrior. I never saw any change in what would be<br/>\nexpected of the class. The original post I responded to said most groups<br/>\nseek monks for their pulling ability. Well, lets take a look at what the<br/>\nother classes are sought after for:<br/>\n<br/>\nCleric- healing<br/>\nDruid- ok.. bad example, they do alot of things<br/>\nShaman- buffing (and see druid)<br/>\nWiz- blasting<br/>\nWar- soaking and dealing damage<br/>\nRanger- dealing damage<br/>\nEnchanter- debuffing<br/>\nrogue- backstabbing<br/>\nMag- ummm never grouped with one so I am not sure.<br/>\nNecro- DoT<br/>\n<br/>\nAll classes (except Druid and Shaman) have one thing they are outstanding<br/>\nat, and other things they do ok, and some things they just plain stink at.<br/>\nWhy is it bad to be sought after because we are the best pullers in the<br/>\nlands? Should Rogues be upset that the only thing anyone ever expects of<br/>\nthem is to backstab? The point I am trying rather long-windedly to make is<br/>\nthat while there are many abilities we do not have, the ones we do have are<br/>\nvital in a group situation, which is how EQ was designed to be played (I<br/>\nwon&#39;t go into the whole solo vs group issue, as I am sure each of us has a<br/>\ndifferent opinion). Regardless of what class is played, if you know what<br/>\nyour strengths and weaknesses are and utilize them accordingly, you will be<br/>\na sought after party member.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut thanks for the info on the perception and ability change that comes with<br/>\n30. I look forward to finding yet another facet of the monk class.<br/>\n<br/>\nSafe travels<br/>\n<br/>\nPraelor Dileasai<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\tRed Eyes [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:puckhoog@...\">puckhoog@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tTuesday, September 07, 1999 10:01 AM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject:\tRe: [EQ-Monks] Suggested monk improvements<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Red Eyes&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:puckhoog@...\">puckhoog@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Your entire opinion will change once you hit 30th level.

I don&#39;t think we should be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; out-damaging a warrior swinging a big 2h weapon or dual wielding, and I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t want to. They have the ac and the hp to protect them from those<br/>\n&gt; 50+<br/>\n&gt; &gt; damage blows that would chew us up in very little time. I have always<br/>\n&gt; been<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of the belief that the monk is NOT a tank. Our armor limitations prevent<br/>\n&gt; us<br/>\n&gt; &gt; from acting like one. With one MoB, we are fine as Dodge and Block will<br/>\n&gt; &gt; serve us well, but if we get hit, we get hit HARD. With 2 or more MoB&#39;s,<br/>\n&gt; our<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Dodge and Block skill will not serve us nearly as well. We are more like<br/>\n&gt; an<br/>\n&gt; &gt; animated DoT spell, inflicting a steady amount of damage throughout the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; duration of a fight. Few people can dish out the damage we can yet<br/>\n&gt; remain<br/>\n&gt; &gt; relatively unmolested. A drawback is it is very difficult to pull a MoB<br/>\n&gt; off<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a party member who is in trouble, and perhaps I would enjoy having a<br/>\n&gt; Taunt<br/>\n&gt; &gt; skill (no I don&#39;t think it is built into our special attacks), but I for<br/>\n&gt; one<br/>\n&gt; &gt; think the Monk class on the whole is doing just fine.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Praelor Dileasai<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lvl 27 Monk of the Ashen Order<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Felizpunk@...\">Felizpunk@...</a> [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Felizpunk@...\">Felizpunk@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Saturday, September 04, 1999 2:58 AM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [EQ-Monks] Suggested monk improvements<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Felizpunk@...\">Felizpunk@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  Lots of good points brought up in this discussion.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  I agree completely that we should get some kind of stunning attack,<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; our delay should beat most, if not all, weapons. As a very<br/>\n&gt; well-equipped<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; monk<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; at lvl 40, I am routinely outdamaged by Ogre and Troll warriors, to<br/>\n&gt; say<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; nothing of casters. So, though we have some unique abilities, monks<br/>\n&gt; could<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; certainly stand some improvement.
