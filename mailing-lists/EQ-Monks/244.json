I know from<br/>\nInnoriel&#39;s numerous - and I do mean numerous- excursions into guk that<br/>\nmesh is so common in the lower regions that Innoriel sometimes destroys it<br/>\nor leaves it on the corpse!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I can get 2 other level 30 plus monks we can make the camp safe- I am<br/>\nvery good at controlling ths spawn in the Lord area.  But I figure it<br/>\nwould be more fun if I gathered 6 level 20-25 monks and lead them down<br/>\nthere - more the merrier - we can give each group an area of<br/>\nresponsibility. while I and one other higher level monk (level 28 at<br/>\nleast) watched for the Lord or his cronies.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy experience has been the the mesh will be dropped in quantities<br/>\nenough to grant every monk present one or two pieces each (assuming we get<br/>\n8 or more monks)  The xp at level 20 -25 will be Tremendous.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIts just an idea.  If there are any of you on Trew marr who are<br/>\ninterested give me email - no need to spam the whole list.  and we can set<br/>\nup a time for toinght or tomorrow.  BRING Friends!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
