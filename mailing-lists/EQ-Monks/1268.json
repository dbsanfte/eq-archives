In general the melee<br/>\nstats (Str/Sta/Agi/Dex) just don&#39;t affect combat much in any way.  The warriors<br/>\nare complaining about this as well.  However it does mean that initial choices<br/>\nlike what race to be or where to put bonus stats aren&#39;t very <br/>\nimportant.  It&#39;s levels<br/>\nand skills (and a good weapon) that really matter.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor monks, the best ordering of priorities I saw was<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Haste (swap ANYTHING to get a haste item... even that Girdle of +100 Str)<br/>\n2. AC/HP (those plat fire opal rings are awesome, especially now with the<br/>\nmonk upgrade meaning that we will be tanking more)<br/>\n3. Str/Agi (you&#39;re worrying about how to add +3Str when you regularly get<br/>\nbuffed by shaman/druids to +20/+30Str- ever noticed much difference between<br/>\na +20Str buff and a +30Str buff?)<br/>\n<br/>\nLook at monks at level 50, we have better AC and attack than warriors, cause<br/>\nmuch more damage, but our HP are 7-800 points below theirs.  With good gear<br/>\nyou can add 350hp or so to a monk. That gets you halfway to being a real<br/>\ntank.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood AC/HP gear:<br/>\nPlat fire opal rings- ac5 55hp  (cost 500pp+)<br/>\nGold fire opal rings- ac4 45hp  (cost 60-120pp)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nClarity Harvestmoon,<br/>\nKarana<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;So, folks, we all recently heard *with disappointment* about verant<br/>\n&gt;employees posting about DEX and AGI - they seem to be a lot less important<br/>\n&gt;than we hoped for.  In light of this new information - what do all you monks<br/>\n&gt;out there see as the most important stats for a monk, now? How would you<br/>\n&gt;focus your items (ie STR? AC? HPS? AGI? DEX? STA?)? And how would you<br/>\n&gt;distribute your starting points?  Maybe a few could name some equipment that<br/>\n&gt;backs up their opinions.<br/>\n&gt;Thanks in advance for everyone&#39;s input =)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Kyeric </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
