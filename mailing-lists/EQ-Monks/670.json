I know for me, the less camping i do the more<br/>\nfun the game is for me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;played and until they change the whole camping system I will continue to<br/>\n&gt;play it in that fashion.  Twinkers like you already screwed the<br/>\n&gt;PoF.....whats next....Lower Guk...permafrost.....<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t believe that the plane of fear was closed due to twinking.  you<br/>\nhave no<br/>\nproof of this, you are just making what happened fit your conclusions.  I did<br/>\nsee a post earlier on the list regarding a reason that was attributed to<br/>\nsomeone<br/>\nfrom Verant which i would tend to believe much more.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;you&#39;re just a bunch of jerks who don&#39;t give a shit about the rest of the<br/>\n&gt;people that play the game....so I can&#39;t wait until you get to 50th level<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ah, why do these discussions always turn into namecalling and swearing?<br/>\nWhy can&#39;t anyone have a rational discussion about these game issues without<br/>\nsaying i am right, you are wrong, and if you don&#39;t agree with me you are a<br/>\n*^$&^%&(%$%#%*&%$.  I don&#39;t expect a response to this question since<br/>\nyou have already dropped down to this level of discussion, of course.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;and leave the game cause you have nothing else to do.  maybe you can then<br/>\n&gt;go back to UO or whatever jerkoff game you played before you came and<br/>\n&gt;wrecked this one.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>To me, I enjoy exploring new areas of the world that I haven&#39;t seen before.<br/>\n If I am <br/>\nlevel 50 and have all kinds of cool stuff, that won&#39;t stop that<br/>\nexploration.  Heck<br/>\nmaybe i will create a new &lt;fill in class here&gt; and twink the heck out of<br/>\nhim/her,<br/>\nbwahahahahaha.
