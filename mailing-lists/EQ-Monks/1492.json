They probably take<br/>\na slight XP penalty for this.  Their high agility and Dex means taht you can<br/>\nIGNORE those stats and go for straight AC and STR gear - something that<br/>\nhuman monks cant do as easily.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo in a word, Yes, iksar are better at lower levels (1-40).  Beyond level<br/>\n40, the regen rate means squat cause you wont be soloing and you will have<br/>\nover 1000 hp.  The AGI and dex wont make &quot;all that much&quot; difference, cause<br/>\nhuman monks would have acquired good gear by this time to compensate them<br/>\nfor thier innate difficiency.  All in all I would have to say that an Iksar<br/>\nat level 50 and a Human at level 50 would be go about 50/50 in a series of<br/>\nduels, with prhaps a slight edge going to the Iksar.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do not intend to start an iksar monk.  But I think they will be great<br/>\nmonks to play and level from 1-35 or so.  Bear in mind they will not be<br/>\nliked everywhere they go and faction will be a problem for them.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:czubakaj@...\">czubakaj@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:czubakaj@...\">czubakaj@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, April 24, 2000 11:16 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@egroups.com\">EQ-Monks@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [EQ-Monks] Kunark is here!
