Last week, I was down <br/>\nin LG, helping ppl in my group get a guise of the deciever.  When we first <br/>\nzoned in we noticed there was a lvl 11 troll warrior down there with other <br/>\nppl from a certain guild.  Turns out they are twinking him a mask.  Well, I <br/>\nnor my group would have anything to do with this so we walked in and took the <br/>\nroom in the temple.  Because they had the lvl 11, they couldn&#39;t camp the <br/>\nroom, or at least hadn&#39;t gotten to it yet, so were forced to pull from the <br/>\nbridge.  Needless to say it rather pissed them off.  We said we would give <br/>\nthem the first mask IF it was for one of them, but it wasn&#39;t and they kept <br/>\nbitching about how we stole their camp.  Guilds got involved, a person quit <br/>\ntheir guild for camping NO DROP items to twink.  Point of the story is, you <br/>\ncan still twink ppl with NO DROP items.  Only think I can think of to change <br/>\nit is to put lvl limits on items.<br/>\n<br/>\n        Kanja Dragonfist</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
