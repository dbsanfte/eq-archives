Mr. McQuaid, I have just","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2036720173\">Just sent this off to Brad and Smedley... was hoping that if <br/>\nothers felt as I do, we could continue to work them in a similar <br/>\nmanner.<br/>\n<br/>\nMr. McQuaid,<br/>\n\tI have just finished reading your rather long and impassioned <br/>\neMail/Producer letter on the topic of Everquest&#39;s evolution.  I found <br/>\nit to be one of the most effective communications from any game <br/>\ncompany to its customers that I have ever read, and for that I <br/>\ncongratulate you.  I hope that people read it, think about it, and <br/>\ntake away from it that which you intended: that the EQ team cares <br/>\ndeeply about Norrath and its citizens.<br/>\n\tAs a software developer myself (although truthfully, I don&#39;t <br/>\ndo as much actual development as I&#39;d like any more - I tend to spend <br/>\nmore time in the design and management process these days), I also <br/>\nunderstand that there must be a primary focus to every project.  For <br/>\nme, this doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that the primary goal be &quot;create <br/>\nthe best possible system&quot;... it goes beyond that to a deeper goal: <br/>\n&quot;Make sure that the client is happy&quot;.  Sometimes this involves <br/>\ndifficult and painful decisions, Herculean efforts, and the ability <br/>\nto case aside profit considerations at times in order to fight for <br/>\nwhat is ultimately the best way to solve any given problem.<br/>\n\tI suspect that you and your team have a similar goal, except <br/>\nyours would be to keep your subscriber base happy and to attract new <br/>\nmembers to that subscriber base.  Another parallel between what we do <br/>\nis that our clients (or subscribers, in your case) don&#39;t always know <br/>\nwhat it is that will truly make them happy or are at loggerheads <br/>\nabout what any particular change might do to forward that goal <br/>\n(witness how many people cannot even agree on whether or not an item <br/>\non your recently released change list is a &quot;+&quot; or a &quot;-&quot;.)<br/>\n\tMost of us understand that tuning needs to take place.  If <br/>\nthings were too easy, then there would be no challenge to life in <br/>\nNorrath and therefore there would be little enjoyment of the <br/>\nsurmounting of those challenges.  If one class is too powerful, a <br/>\nsurfeit of players using that class results, just as a underpowered <br/>\nor less useful class suffers a dearth of interested participants. <br/>\nThe fact that it requires a group of people to do most worthwhile <br/>\nthings in EQ is one of the more attractive things about the game <br/>\n(although there are of course those who would argue that this is also <br/>\none of its greatest downfalls).  The fact that each and every class - <br/>\nonce it reaches maturity - can bring something unique to a group is a <br/>\nwonderful and fragile thing.  Adjusting the balance of the classes so <br/>\nthat their value to such a group is maintained is a task of <br/>\nmonumental delicacy, and your efforts at maintaining this balance <br/>\nshould be commended.<br/>\n\tUnfortunately, as people are by definition human, mistakes <br/>\nare occasionally made.  Over time, the development team has <br/>\nrecognized some of these mistakes and have made efforts to address <br/>\nthem.  By way of example, Warriors got some serious boosts some time <br/>\nago, and with the introduction of the expansion, the presence of a <br/>\nRogue in a well-rounded party will become very important indeed. <br/>\nThese were both well-considered and well-deserved changes, and the <br/>\nplayers of those classes have (or will have) reaped the rewards of <br/>\nthese changes over the course of time.<br/>\n\tOther classes who have been &#39;nerfed&#39; may complain <br/>\nvociferously about it, but if they go over those issues which <br/>\ngenerated the most complaints (kiting, pet damage, etc) I think that <br/>\npeople will realize that while these changes were made to the <br/>\npossible detriment of the solo player, they were certainly done to <br/>\nenhance the value and necessity of other classes in a group.  If this <br/>\nwas indeed your goal, then I must certainly say that your mission has <br/>\nbeen accomplished.<br/>\n\tWith this in mind, I am still at a loss to explain why the <br/>\nFeign Death skill for Monks was recently so seriously altered.  I <br/>\nunderstand your reasons for doing what you did, but the consequence <br/>\nis that the usefulness of a Monk in higher-level (40+) groups has <br/>\nbeen seriously compromised.  True, we can do the damage of a <br/>\ndecently-equipped warrior, but that&#39;s it.  The warrior offers so much <br/>\nmore to a group (stun, taunt, the ability to take huge amounts of <br/>\ndamage, etc) that the role of a monk has been diminished greatly. <br/>\nThe one thing that we could bring to a group - that of feign-pulling <br/>\n- has for all practical purposes been eliminated and replaced with a <br/>\nreputation for being the &quot;Master Train Engineers&quot;.  For this reason, <br/>\nmonks are beginning to be refused entry into impromptu groups because <br/>\nthey do not bring anything special and are often dangerous companions.<br/>\n\tAs a level 50 monk, I no longer use FD for fear that on those <br/>\noccasions where it is necessary, I&#39;ll end up wiping out half the zone <br/>\nas I get up to work my way back to a zone point.  I would far rather <br/>\ndie individually than wipe out other innocent players in a ploy to <br/>\nsave my own skin - and have now done so on a number of occasions.<br/>\n\tHow has this change made your player base happier?  How has <br/>\nit enhanced the role of a Monk in a group?  How has it positively <br/>\naffected group dynamics?  I really want to understand what the <br/>\ndesired affect of this change was... perhaps if I did, I could lose <br/>\nthe bitter taste in my mouth and not continually toy with the idea of <br/>\ndropping out of Norrath in disappointment.  As it is, I only stay so <br/>\nthat I can help twink up friends.<br/>\n\tDon&#39;t get me wrong, I am not saying that Norrath is an <br/>\nimpossible place to live in without Monks being able to Feign in <br/>\ntheir accustomed fashion.  Groups will just load up on more Warriors <br/>\nor Paladins in their stead, and the more difficult areas of Norrath <br/>\nthat could previously be handled by a single well-organized and <br/>\nbalanced group will now have to be taken by multiple groups just <br/>\ncharging in willy-nilly with no plan more sophisticated than &quot;kill <br/>\nthis one first, then that one, and if we&#39;re still left alive, we go <br/>\nfor that other one last.&quot;<br/>\n\tI understand that your decision is made and that further <br/>\nrevision to the Feign Death mechanics is unlikely.  I am not <br/>\ntherefore asking for you to do so - your team seems to be happy with <br/>\nFD in its current form, and we as players should respect that and <br/>\nmake our own decisions accordingly.  I just wanted to ask for a brief <br/>\nexplanation of the motivations behind this change and to also bring <br/>\nagain to your attention the fact that the balance you strive for is <br/>\nan exceedingly delicate thing that is all to easily thrown out of <br/>\nkilter by even the best-intentioned and well-discussed changes.<br/>\n\tThank you for your time.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nAaron Braunstein<br/>\nPacific Data Management, Inc.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aaron_braunstein@...\">aaron_braunstein@...</a>&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
