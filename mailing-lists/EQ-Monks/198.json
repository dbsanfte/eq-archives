Please speak up and give stories if your having a tough time with it.<br/>\n     <br/>\n    I am just very curious if Verant made a change in the ability to FD without stating it.  I bet they would call this an &quot;ENHANCEMENT&quot; wouldn&#39;t they.<br/>\n     <br/>\n    Oh, and the durations of Buff spells really really dissapoints me.  I thought they were good as is before the patch.  Have to rebuff after ever other fight. Very annoying to the casters in my group.  <br/>\n     <br/>\n    Axlon hooks up his mana sieve to Jhessa   (Very lovely Barbarian Shaman that she is)<br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n    And one rumor I heard..is that Clerics can not cast buffs on ya unless you are grouped with them. Can anyone confirm this?<br/>\n     <br/>\n    <br/>\n    Axlon Stormbringer</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
