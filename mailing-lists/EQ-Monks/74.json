Is there any reason<br/>\nto save this or can i destroy it. Someone told me it might<br/>\nbe needed later to finish a quest. Anyone know?<br/>\n<br/>\nSecondly - Is agility tantamount to our success? I have<br/>\nbeen using Dervish rings +2 dex and yesterday bought a<br/>\n+2 agility ring. Should i be looking into more agility<br/>\nitems?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nGhoti 7th circle monk of Povar.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
