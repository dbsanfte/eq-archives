You will notice that when shedding your carnelian ring, you<br/>\nlose, I believe, three units of armor (I could be mistaken tho&#39;, so I will<br/>\nreexamine this issue further when I manage to excape from work : ). The Jagged<br/>\nBand provides an additional five armor points. Your gain then is two with the<br/>\ntrade plus three strength points (improving your attack rating by a few<br/>\npoint).<br/>\nWith my current AGI of 131, I have noticed no dramatic improvement in the<br/>\nfrequency of Dodge, Block, etc. over my previous ~115 AGI. I do notice,<br/>\nhowever, that your opponent has a harder time landing blows as your AC rises.<br/>\nAGI serves as an additional source of AC, but when you find items like a<br/>\nJagged<br/>\nBand that give a greater AC bonus than a similar AGI improving item, go with<br/>\nthe AC improvement. I&#39;m not certain, but it may be that you do not see the AC<br/>\nbonus from AGI items until you add a full 10 point increase. In that case, it<br/>\nmay be more benificial to go with the AC boosting item. Again, I will take a<br/>\ncloser look at this later to make sure I am not just blowing smoke, or maybe<br/>\nour brothers and sisters have already looked into this and provided some<br/>\nanswers...<br/>\n<br/>\nMay Quellious guide you,<br/>\n<br/>\nManjushri<br/>\nBearer of the Red Sash of the Ashen Order<br/>\n(Fennin Ro)<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 05:59 PM 12/18/99 -0800, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Worlord &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:worlord99@...\">worlord99@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I recently managed to buy some Jagged Bands which I<br/>\n&gt;have used to replace my Gold Carnelian rings (+5 agi).<br/>\n&gt; was this a good choice?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I currently use onyx earrings (+2 agi).
