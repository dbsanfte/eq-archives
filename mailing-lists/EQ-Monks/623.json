That would solve a lot of those<br/>\n&gt;problems, but in my real opinion, I just really love this game, it may be<br/>\n&gt;because I am still so new, haven&#39;t even got past my first month and my 19th<br/>\n&gt;(almost 20th Level) Monk is my pride and joy. I really enjoy when people<br/>\n&gt;look at my gear and say nice spread, I worked damn hard for my stuff and it<br/>\n&gt;is my own personnel satisfaction I get from my character.

Maybe<br/>\nthey are<br/>\ntrying to get to places they haven&#39;t seen yet because they would die almost<br/>\ninstantly.
