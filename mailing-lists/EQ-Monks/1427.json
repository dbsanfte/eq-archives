Just across the first stop--sister island--from Freeport in<br/>\nOoT<br/>\nis the goblin island. To the immediate right of that island as you are facing<br/>\nit is an undead island featuring spectres that you can easily avoid, greater<br/>\nskeletons that you will have to kill in abundance, and gargoyles. You can hunt<br/>\nthem to level 25, and they yeild the best loot since wisps. Gargoyle eyes sell<br/>\nat inns for about 9pp, and they are stackable, so hunt to your hearts content<br/>\nand save the eyes until you are ready to return to Freeport. You will want to<br/>\ntake along plenty of bandages and insure that you have mend, bind wound, and<br/>\nfeign maxed for your level before taking these gargoyles on as they can be<br/>\nquite dangerous. Good luck. I can not advise you beyond that because after my<br/>\ngargoyle exploits, I have hunted almost exclusively in groups.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Quellious&#39;s Name,<br/>\n<br/>\nManjushri Bodhisattva<br/>\nBearer of the Red Sash of the Ashen Order<br/>\n(Fennin Ro)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
