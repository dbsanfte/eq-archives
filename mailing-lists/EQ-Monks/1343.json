Equipment is not very helpful for us.  The only thing that would<br/>\n&gt;really help at low levels is AC and hit points.  Getting an additional<br/>\n&gt;10 hit points at level 1 gives you about 20% more hp.  AC isn&#39;t that<br/>\n&gt;important anyway unless you do some MAJOR AC twinking.  For example,<br/>\n&gt;that serp bracer would be worthless to a level 5 character.  The would<br/>\n&gt;have an EXTREMELY minimal advantage over a monk with full cloth.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Just my thoughts... I had a friend who twinked his monk, level 1 he had<br/>\n&gt;2 serp bracers, azure sleeves, foremans, wolf fur slippers, jagged<br/>\n&gt;bands.  Still died just as often as without the stuff.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-- <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I wasn&#39;t speaking of monks in general.
