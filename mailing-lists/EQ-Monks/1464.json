No such luck.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I was told when trying to learn more about him, was that the<br/>\nplaceholders spawn every 70 minutes.  As you come out of RE into the gorge,<br/>\nthere are three gobbies that spawn.  The two on the right are supposed to be<br/>\nthe place holders.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSome people have told me they just find the spawn cycle time, then leave and<br/>\nreturn right before the next set spawns.  I always ck when I run thru the<br/>\ngorge.  Maybe someday I&#39;ll get lucky and run into it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe gobbies there are pretty low level, low teens I think.  I would guess<br/>\nthe alchy will be in the high teens or very low twenties.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck,<br/>\n<br/>\nThors Blazingfury, Tunare <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\tNick Gee [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nick_gee@...\">nick_gee@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tTuesday, March 21, 2000 11:31 AM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n\t\tSubject:\t[EQ-Monks] Goblin Alchemist<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFrom: &quot;Nick Gee&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nick_gee@...\">nick_gee@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tOk I think it&#39;s about time for me to hunt the goblin<br/>\nalchemistr in<br/>\n\t\tbeholder and do the treant fists quest.
