It appears to only be affecting me, but it is severe enough to<br/>\n&gt; bring to your attention as well, I think.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Last night, while zoning from South Keladim into North Keladim (where the<br/>\n&gt; bank is) I crashed. A drag, but nothing all that new. The twist is,<br/>\nhowever,<br/>\n&gt; I cannot log my monk, Praelor, back onto the server! I tried re-starting<br/>\nEQ,<br/>\n&gt; re-connecting my ISP, and re-booting my system, all to no avail. I brought<br/>\n&gt; in a lvl 2 druid and /petitioned, and spent the next 3 hours speaking with<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; guide and a gm. The GM said he would reset my character to a point prior<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; the disappearance, but could make no promises on when that would occur. So<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; logged and tried again this morning.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And there he was, right where I had started Last night. Everything<br/>\nappeared<br/>\n&gt; to be fine. I still needed to go to the bank, however, so off to Keladim I<br/>\n&gt; went, and upon zoning from S. Keladim into N. Keladim again, I crashed.<br/>\nWith<br/>\n&gt; the same results as last night. Well, it was 6:30 am EST, and no GM&#39;S were<br/>\n&gt; online, but I did speak with a guide who promised to forward my problem to<br/>\n&gt; then first GM who showed up, but it would not be for several hours.<br/>\n&gt; Understandable, given that it was 3:30 am in San Diego.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So now, with time to kill before work, I decided to experiment. I created<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; Dwarven Cleric and ran him into the zone and promptly crashed. So at least<br/>\n&gt; it is not a corrupt character file with Praelor. I then created a Dwarven<br/>\n&gt; Cleric on The Tribunal server and zoned with no problem. Now I know it is<br/>\n&gt; not a corrupt N. Keladim data file and that it is specific to Fenin Ro. A<br/>\n&gt; few of my guildmates then create characters on Fenin Ro and zone with no<br/>\n&gt; problem, so it is not a server-wide issue.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; All this leads me to believe that it is something specific with the link<br/>\n&gt; between my system and the Fenin Ro servers, but I just wanted to give<br/>\n&gt; everyone a heads up on this &quot;just in case&quot;. I am planning on re-installing<br/>\n&gt; EQ and running all the patches tonight, and will let you know the outcome.<br/>\n&gt; With any luck, that will solve everything and Praelor Dileasai will once<br/>\n&gt; again be running from all those nasty critters in Mistmoore (hehe). If<br/>\n&gt; not... well.. I just don&#39;t really want to think about the &quot;if not&quot;<br/>\nscenario<br/>\n&gt; yet.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Praelor Dileasai<br/>\n&gt; The Limbo Monk<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Congrats to our GROW TO GIVE winners, ZENtertainment & ROTInews!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Check out ONElist&#39;s latest program, FRIENDS & FAMILY.
