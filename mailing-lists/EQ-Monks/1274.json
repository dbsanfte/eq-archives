Some cheap stuff you could buy now or save up for:<br/>\n<br/>\nOnyx earrings (2agi ones) 5pp from Blackburrow<br/>\nSpiked collar (3ac 3str) 5pp from Blackburrow<br/>\n<br/>\nthen start saving up:<br/>\n<br/>\nBracer of Erolisi (ac5 5str) 30pp from OOT<br/>\nJagged bands (ac5 3str) 30-50pp from Unrest<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRaykwon:  Get rid of the serpentine bracer and buy a vox bracer (ac7).<br/>\nSpiked collar (ac3 3str) is hard to beat even though it is newbieish.<br/>\nCollar of undead protection (ac5) is good as well.  Get a mask with<br/>\nsome AC on it- leering mask (from Najena) is cheap or the lizard<br/>\ntribal mask from CT is really nice.  Finally get a real cloak-<br/>\nlizardscale cloak from CT (ac8 5dex) has great AC even if the dex is<br/>\nnext to useless.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso try to switch into cured silk for a lot of your extra equipment. For<br/>\nshoes I think the cured silk is better than fur lined and elsewhere it is<br/>\nlighter than mesh.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith all those changes, which shouldn&#39;t cost a lot if you can get a<br/>\ngood price on the serp bracers, you should go up about 20AC.  You<br/>\nwill notice a big difference in the melee damage you take- that&#39;s<br/>\nmore AC than you gain for going up a level.<br/>\n<br/>\nClarity Harvestmoon,<br/>\nKarana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
