If the Wizards use /assist they will be taking out what the Bard has<br/>\n&gt;targeted. Enchanter will use Mesmerization for AoE Crowd Control and there<br/>\n&gt;should only be 1 fighting at a time. You are quite mistaken about this<br/>\n&gt;group. This is the MOST powerful group that you can have. There is no other<br/>\n&gt;group that will do more damage in a shorter amount of time.
