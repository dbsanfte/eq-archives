Having<br/>\n250pp at your level is phenomenal. Serpentine bracers for 800pp a pair is a<br/>\nfine deal (I was shocked to get mine for 700pp).<br/>\n<br/>\nI assume you have either a full set of mesh or cured silk. What you should<br/>\ndo with that 250pp is look for good values - items that will provide the<br/>\nmost benefit for the lowest cost.<br/>\n<br/>\nExamples:<br/>\n<br/>\nJagged bands (5AC, +3 STR) - 25-60pp each<br/>\nGold carnelian rings (+5 AGI) - 30pp each<br/>\nGold amber earrings (+3 STR) - 30-40pp each<br/>\n<br/>\nDo the headband and sash quests at least up to red headband and orange<br/>\nsash. These aren&#39;t great stat boosting items, but they&#39;re easy to get<br/>\n(though you&#39;d better hurry and get the red headband before Infected Paw<br/>\ngoes wild).<br/>\n<br/>\nForget about buying anything that comes out of Guk, because everything from<br/>\nthere is pricey.<br/>\n<br/>\nBottom line: do the research, check the websites, and compile a list of<br/>\nitems in your price range. Then go look for them at the best prices you can<br/>\nfind. When you see a fair deal, go for it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I think it is sad, that if I am going to be a<br/>\n&gt;successful adventurer, I am going to have to be like the rest of the money<br/>\n&gt;grubbing classes:  Rogues, Shadow Knights,  Warriors, Druids, Shamans,<br/>\n&gt;Rangers, Bards,  Enchanters, Wizards, Magicians, Necromancers,  holy<br/>\n&gt;Clerics and pious Paladins.  Does anyone else see a problem with this?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Monks live in the same world as all the other classes, and are a part of<br/>\nthe same economy. There&#39;s nothing evil about that.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fact is that once you get into your 20&#39;s, money gets a lot easier to<br/>\ncome by. I&#39;m level 26 now, and a night in the Highkeep basement nets me<br/>\n10-20pp over a 3 hour period. Even more now that I&#39;m starting to join the<br/>\nwarrior room groups, as they drop fine steel weapons sometimes. Be patient.<br/>\nYou&#39;ll make money without having to lower yourself to the level of a<br/>\nshadowknight.<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------------------<br/>\nMoorgard Ghostfist of Povar<br/>\nSeeker of Virtue</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
