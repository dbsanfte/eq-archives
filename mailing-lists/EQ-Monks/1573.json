So, <br/>\nI was wondering if any of my sensei&#39;s out there could let me know what I<br/>\nshould be shopping for.  I&#39;m wearing cured silk, except the following:<br/>\n<br/>\nExecutioners&#39; Hood<br/>\nSpiked Collar (+3 STR, 3 AC)<br/>\nBracer of Erollisi (+5 STR, 5AC)<br/>\nSerpentine Bracer  (I&#39;ve got 2, but prefer the ac of the erollisi)<br/>\nTreant Fists<br/>\n2 Jagged Bands<br/>\nOnyx Earring (+2 AGI)<br/>\nEarring from the bartender in unrest (+5 cha, ? AC) -- wearing for the AC<br/>\nForeman&#39;s Tunic<br/>\n<br/>\nQuestions:  <br/>\n<br/>\nShould I sell the foreman&#39;s tunic, and get a lockjaw for 2 more AC?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen gatorscale stuff that drops in guk.  Looks like caster armor, mostly,<br/>\nbut we can wear it, and the AC is very high.  Should I save up and buy that one<br/>\npiece at a time?  (Leggings alone are around 700p)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat level should I consider trying for the Robe of the Lost Circle?  I have<br/>\nthe purple headband (and black, and blue), and the red sash already).<br/>\n<br/>\nAre there any *light* 1H blunt weapons that I can cary around to practice with?<br/>\nNormally, I just join a HK group and duel wield cracked staves, hoping no one<br/>\nwill notice that I&#39;m not doing much damage :)  But, when I&#39;m the only tank,<br/>\nI can&#39;t afford that much AC loss.<br/>\n<br/>\nShould I buy a weight reducing bag?  How much should I pay?  I don&#39;t normally<br/>\ncarry anything at all with weight, besides armor and maybe a couple of weapons<br/>\nthat will, when wielded, take me over 15 anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance!<br/>\n<br/>\nLimberouch<br/>\nRed Belt of the 25th degree<br/>\nTarrew Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
