(It took long enough to save up)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The thing is I don&#39;t have a clue what to buy next? The only better armour I<br/>\n&gt;know of is that Plane of Fear, Shiverback stuff.. At level 12, I think not.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So I guess that leaves earrings and rings? What should I go for? I<br/>\n&gt;currently have no earrings and two +2 dex rings, + 1 AC derv rings..<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Any suggestions welcomed!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;PS I have discovered a useful (bug?) Scarab (sand/Giant) carapaces weigh<br/>\n&gt;0.0kgs. You can solo these at about level 10, and since the loot doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;weigh anything it&#39;s all good! (Ok at higher levels 1.7gp per shell isn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;going to get anyone very excited is it!)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Cheers,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Herrick of Quellious [Champions of Justice]<br/>\n&gt;Bristlebane<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;Anyone who is not a socialist at 16 has no heart,<br/>\n&gt;but anyone who still is at 32 has no mind.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Mail me:        <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:andy.sands@...\">andy.sands@...</a><br/>\n&gt;Url:            <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.manipulative.com/\">http://www.manipulative.com/</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
