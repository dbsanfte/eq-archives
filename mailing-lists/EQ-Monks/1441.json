I mean<br/>\nover here we pay for the price of a local phone call, every minute<br/>\nwe&#39;re online. You guys have a flat rate fee a lot of you don&#39;t you?<br/>\nwell I have to pay A LOT of money to just play EQ, let alone camp<br/>\nstuff. My phone bil is about $250 a month and it&#39;s not cool, so<br/>\ncamping for these itmes is something pretty much impossible for me,<br/>\nwhen are Verant going to realise this and change quests so they can<br/>\nbe completed in a lot of very small bits?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd also when are they going to have some GM&#39;s deal with people who<br/>\nplay from Europe lie me? I mean I hate to log on at 3 in the mourning<br/>\njust to petition a GM for a name chnge which he never showed up for!<br/>\nThey should be bothered to employ just a COUPLE in Europe to help us<br/>\nwith our problems.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
