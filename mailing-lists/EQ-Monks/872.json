I am of<br/>\n&gt; the 26th<br/>\n&gt; season and I was wondering, when you solo the aviak guards in Lake<br/>\n&gt; Rathe if<br/>\n&gt; you need to feign death you can, then you can stand right back up and<br/>\n&gt; bandage and continue on with the fight, my question is can you do the<br/>\n&gt; same<br/>\n&gt; to aviaks in the aviak village, I was wondering because if you can<br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; means I can solo harriers instead of just rooks. Thank you for your<br/>\n&gt; time. Oh<br/>\n&gt; by the way I bought my BP Choker last night, and now I am broke, but I<br/>\n&gt; am a<br/>\n&gt; satisfied broke hehehe, and I also traded for a Shralok Pack for my<br/>\n&gt; opal<br/>\n&gt; electrum necklace too.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
