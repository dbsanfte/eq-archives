Then my question is this, why<br/>\nis there an equipment check everyday?  I realize the theory of the week has<br/>\neveryone swapping constantly, but so far, over a year of grouping with<br/>\ndifferent monks, I have noticed few changes (Pre Kunark) no matter what gear<br/>\nwas worn.  I have observed that the only constants in the monk community<br/>\nhave been HP, AC, Resists for the solo monk, and Resists, HP, AC for the<br/>\ngrouped monk.  I believe this reflects the creatures to be fought... a solo<br/>\nmonk would not fight a caster if given the choice, and a grouped monk<br/>\nexpects to be hit rarely, save for the casters that open up on the party.<br/>\nNow please tell me if I am wrong, but this is what I have observed.  Knowing<br/>\nthat agility really does nothing for your defensive skills, and adds little<br/>\nto your AC, Stamina adds little to your HP, and strength adds to the damage,<br/>\nbut not the chance to hit, it really does seem that a move to AC and HP<br/>\nwould be best.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA monk friend of mine told me that he concentrates on HPs mainly, then on<br/>\nwhatever AC gear he can get to fill non HP areas.  He says that most of the<br/>\nresist gear he has access to is either too heavy, or is too weak to be worth<br/>\ndropping more valuable HP gear for.  I assume this will change with items<br/>\nlike the crown he was talking about.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow for the real question... I have noticed a great number of monk weapons<br/>\nin Kunark.  I know that my friend has done no training in weapons, only Hand<br/>\nto Hand.  Are the new monk weapons worth the trouble?  I say they would be,<br/>\nand he still disagrees.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
