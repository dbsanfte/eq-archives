A few exceptions like<br/>\n&quot;solitaire&quot;...  Computers came along and let us play games<br/>\ncompletely by ourselves.  But we for the most part find most of these<br/>\ngames not nearly as fun as games with other people..  Thus games<br/>\nlike DOOM and Warcraft II and Diablo, now UO and EQ and AC let us<br/>\nagain have social contact.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your friends suddenly do not allow you into your group because you are<br/>\nnot quite as powerful as before, then maybe you should look<br/>\nat that friendship and see if thats what it is.  Not too many<br/>\nof the people I call friends online give a hoot about my game power.<br/>\nJust like I always invite Joe, the worlds worst golf player to go<br/>\nwith us to play golf, real friends shouldn&#39;t care if you walked up<br/>\nand said flying kick was removed, you should still be immediately<br/>\ngrouped.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow the monk isn&#39;t suddenly instantly accepted into the group.  Well<br/>\nguess what, neither are bards (pre level 32).  Neither are wizards <br/>\n(unless you&#39;re going to hate), neither are warriors, neither are ...<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom the way you talk, monks are social rejects now because feign death<br/>\nisn&#39;t as powerful, and that just isn&#39;t so.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes it is more difficult, as you are not as useful, but every class<br/>\nhas their power tuned (nerfed or enhanced) occasionally, and if you<br/>\ncan&#39;t cpe with these kinds of changes, then I suggest you stop<br/>\nplaying EQ and join chat rooms to meet friends.  Verant can&#39;t put your<br/>\nability to make friends easily above the need to balance the game.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Goode, Jason&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JGoode@...\">JGoode@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hrmmm...no, if you give it more of a bit of intropection, that&#39;s not<br/>\n </span></blockquote>really<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; true.
