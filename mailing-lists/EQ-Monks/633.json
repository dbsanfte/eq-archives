However, I need to find a place that<br/>\nhas a good spawn rate of them, close to a general merchant, and some<br/>\nplace that isn&#39;t overly camped.  I could stay in the oasis and solo<br/>\nblues easily.  But it is way overcamped to be good.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I think trying to solo in a dungeon is not the right way to<br/>\ngo about it.  You should instead find a place with non aggs or aggs spread<br/>\nout enough that you can pick one off safely and safely kill it without<br/>\nworrying about all the other creatures roaming about.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Jeffrey Sue &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jsue@...\">jsue@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I know this is gonna sound sarcastic with no tone being able to be conveyed,<br/>\n&gt; but try not to look at it this way.  The game was designed for groups.  Once<br/>\n&gt; you hit a certain level (different for different classes) it&#39;s just almost<br/>\n&gt; impossible<br/>\n&gt; to solo.  I know for my bard, he sucked at soloing from about 20-25 in unrest,<br/>\n&gt; but now at 27 i am able to solo blues again, thanks to fear song and chains<br/>\n&gt; song.  (This is the part that will sound nasty, but i really don&#39;t mean it<br/>\n&gt; that way)<br/>\n&gt; If you only have 10 or 15 minutes I would suggest just playing some other<br/>\n&gt; non eq game of which there are many good ones.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; At 02:24 PM 9/15/1999 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: Dave Gaines &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dave@...\">dave@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Hi everyone, I&#39;m new to the list, but my monk has hit level 20, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;has decided he has killed enough crocodiles.  I&#39;m looking for some<br/>\n&gt; &gt;place that I could solo from level 20-30 and maybe a place that even<br/>\n&gt; &gt;gives good monk loot.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Also, what kind of armor should I be looking for?
