As a monk this is really easy to do as monks dont have anything to <br/>\nspend money on but good armor.  By the time I was 10th level, I had over 100 <br/>\nplat saved, by the time I reached 18th I had bought and sold over 1000 plat <br/>\nworth of stuff, all done by money and items I have earned myself by selling <br/>\nloot or trade skills.  One good one is mesh.  Poke your head into Guk and <br/>\nyou can just about get that stuff free off of the people in there....they <br/>\nhave it comming out of thier ears.  I would also rather have things like a <br/>\nspiked collar (easily obtainable in Black Burrow) than the cured silk <br/>\ncounterpart.  Man, I give someone valuble information, such as the location <br/>\nto where he can find a list of just about EVERY item a monk can wear, what <br/>\nthe stats are and more importantly where he can get them and how much they <br/>\nusually sell for, so he can judge whether or not they are obtainable or not, <br/>\nand you jump me with an offensive letter like this?  Learn some manners.<br/>\nWhat I am tired is, people like you jumping to conclutions when you have <br/>\nabsolutely no idea what you are talking about.  The worst part is, I wasn&#39;t <br/>\ninsulting his armor, I was offering good, helpfull information.  I never <br/>\nsaid ANYTHING like &quot;oh well cure silk is crap compaired to Shiverback, you <br/>\nshould get a full suit of that&quot;.  If you knew anything, you yourself would <br/>\nknow there are little peices people can pick up here and there to improve <br/>\nover something as rudimentary as cured silk is.<br/>\nAnyway, do yourself a favor, think before you type...and maybe you should <br/>\ncheck on stomped, you might find there is a peice of armor you could easily <br/>\nreplace with something better.  Getting eq doesn&#39;t always involve camping <br/>\n45+ mobs.  Anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nShelza, 18th, Karana.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Clarity &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:roderick.duncan@...\">roderick.duncan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: [EQ-Monks] Re: What to buy?<br/>\n&gt;Date: Fri, 04 Feb 2000 11:42:10 -0500<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Shelza,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m sorry, but what are you talking about?  Herrick is a level 12 monk <br/>\n&gt;talking<br/>\n&gt;about saving up scarab carapaces for 1.7gp each!  Do you think this guy has<br/>\n&gt;30pp to go buy a bracer of erolisi? or 100pp to get a silver-plated bracer?<br/>\n&gt;Please tell me what armor better than cured even a level 18 can go get?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m just a little tired of people who are twinked telling new players what<br/>\n&gt;they<br/>\n&gt;should be wearing:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&quot;oh, man, that cured hat sucks, go get a froglock crown&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;There is a lot better stuff that Harrick can get, but he definitely<br/>\n&gt;shouldn&#39;t worry<br/>\n&gt;about it now.

Goto EQ Stomped and they have a special section on monk <br/>\n&gt;armor<br/>\n&gt; &gt;and you can compare and contrast them, and see what you want to hunt for<br/>\n&gt; &gt;next.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Shelza, 18th Karana<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;From: Andy Sands &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:andy.sands@...\">andy.sands@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Subject: [EQ-Monks] What to buy?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Date: Wed, 02 Feb 2000 01:47:59 +0000<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Hi all,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;I&#39;m a level 12 monk who now has a full set of cured and some wu&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;gauntlets. (It took long enough to save up)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;The thing is I don&#39;t have a clue what to buy next? The only better <br/>\n&gt;armour I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;know of is that Plane of Fear, Shiverback stuff.. At level 12, I think <br/>\n&gt;not.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;So I guess that leaves earrings and rings? What should I go for? I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;currently have no earrings and two +2 dex rings, + 1 AC derv rings..<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Any suggestions welcomed!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;PS I have discovered a useful (bug?) Scarab (sand/Giant) carapaces <br/>\n&gt;weigh<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;0.0kgs. You can solo these at about level 10, and since the loot <br/>\n&gt;doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;weigh anything it&#39;s all good! (Ok at higher levels 1.7gp per shell <br/>\n&gt;isn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;going to get anyone very excited is it!)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Cheers,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Herrick of Quellious [Champions of Justice]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Bristlebane<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;--<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Anyone who is not a socialist at 16 has no heart,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;but anyone who still is at 32 has no mind.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Mail me:        <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:andy.sands@...\">andy.sands@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Url:            <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.manipulative.com/\">http://www.manipulative.com/</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
