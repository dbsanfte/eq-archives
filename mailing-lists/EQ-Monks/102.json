My played time is now about 4 day, 6 hours.  Is this about right for a lvl 11 guy?  What are your played times for your lvl 32 monk?  I&#39;m just interested in knowning if I&#39;m behind the curve here.  I just dont have the patience to get to lvl 17!  It is frustrating.  Right now I&#39;m in Befallen, as a lvl 11.  Is there a more appropriate place that I should go perhaps?  Right now I&#39;m not worried about RPing too much, because I die way too much, so I guess that means I just want to lvl ASAP.  Where&#39;s a good place to get EXP at my level?  Grouping tips/anything would be appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Maerjyon &lt;The Keepers&gt;, E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I got a little discouraged around that level as well.  So, in hopes of finding grand adventure I went travaling.  The end result was steamfont mountains.  I had a great time there for about 3 levels.  The exp. is amazing there for a 10-14 character.  Minos, drakes, harpys, elementals, and those big robot-like spiders.  Not to mention the skeletons on steriods.  They&#39;ll give you a run for your money at level 12 even.  Just keep an eye out for the hero, he&#39;s a cranky sort of fellow.  I hope this helps a little. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
