I<br/>\nwas in Cazic, just chatting with some friends and messing around, and they<br/>\nasked me to pull a bit before I went off to bed.  They had a new guy with<br/>\nthem who had never heard of feign pulling and they wanted me to show him.<br/>\nNothing difficult, mind you, as it was mostly a demonstration.  I never<br/>\npulled anything tougher than Fanatic/Zealots/etc, but I had no trouble<br/>\nspliting them once they got out of line of sight.<br/>\n<br/>\nLei<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Tim Perkins [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tperkins@...\">tperkins@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, November 16, 1999 1:33 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EQ-Monks] Feign Death<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Tim Perkins&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tperkins@...\">tperkins@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sorry to disagree with you but the flame goblins I let go <br/>\n&gt; back to thier<br/>\n&gt; spots were in no way in line of sight and neither were the <br/>\n&gt; Dar froggies my<br/>\n&gt; friend experimented with. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
