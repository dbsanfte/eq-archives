I used those 3 songs with switching instruments<br/>\nand punches (1-4dmg :) After 18th bards are more powerful using just<br/>\nmusic. Had I tried fighting the paladin with my PGT and barbed whip, I<br/>\nwould have been thumped soundly. The problem is those songs are area<br/>\neffect. You wouldn&#39;t believe the hatred mobs feel for bards, but thats a<br/>\nrant for another list. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for bards pulling, all the songs are low level ones as already posted.<br/>\nIn fact only a handful of bard songs over 20 are any good, which is why I<br/>\ndont play him much these days. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-Bethorn</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
