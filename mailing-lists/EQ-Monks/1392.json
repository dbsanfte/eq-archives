You may have intercept them while they were wandering. But<br/>\nI am sure that the spawns are every 20 minutes, and it is not only Mooto,<br/>\nbut also a warrior or a shaman so you may have missed some place holders.<br/>\nI have never seen a place holder in the gorge outside the 72-85 min range.<br/>\nYou have to be very careful, because if people are fighting next to the<br/>\nzone, it can be very difficult to see the exact spawns and when they are<br/>\nkilled.<br/>\nOf course, everything I say is true if they have not changed anything about<br/>\nthe spawns. I have not read anything about it on the message boards, so I<br/>\nthink it is still true.<br/>\n<br/>\nTsin Suchiko<br/>\n42nd rank, Tunare.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:imari_dellimore@...\">imari_dellimore@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:imari_dellimore@...\">imari_dellimore@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, February 17, 2000 11:13 AM<br/>\nTo: Guillaume Voizard; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re:RE: [EQ-Monks] That darn goblin alchemist.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:imari_dellimore@...\">imari_dellimore@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nHmm Maybe they moved the spawn in Misty.  When I got the alchemist there (<br/>\nafter<br/>\nabout 2 hours of camping) I was at the camp right next to the running eye<br/>\nzone,<br/>\nand the alchemist spawned right ontop of me.  Also my experience there was<br/>\nthat<br/>\nmooto spawned only every hour or so<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI never moved to any of the otehr goblin camps.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as your info on the Gorge spawn goes.  It conforms to my experience. <br/>\nOnly thing I would add is that the 72-80 minte spawn seems to have a much<br/>\nwider<br/>\nrange than that - sometimes you wont get a double spawn for more than 2<br/>\nhours.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did the quest when I was levle 19, about 3 weeks ago.  Maybe your info is<br/>\nmore<br/>\nrecent. i dont know.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
