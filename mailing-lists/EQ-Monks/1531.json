I know some of the people on the list could have told me this<br/>\ninformation, so I&#39;m passing the results along to the rest that haven&#39;t done<br/>\nthis experiment before as an FYI.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery 5 points of Ag added increased AC by 1, for a max of 4 added AC if all<br/>\n20 went into it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout 80% of the points put into Str went into attk.  All 20 pts into Str<br/>\nimproved attk by 16 points.  The base was 10, then adding all 20 pts into<br/>\nstr almost tripled attk!  The difference in battles was very noticeable.<br/>\nPlus for some reason, my battle skills went up really fast compared to the<br/>\nother tests with this configuration.  Anyone know why?<br/>\n<br/>\nNothing for hp, ac or attk for dex.  (I guess you all knew that.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI started this exp to see what would happen with stamina.  The results were<br/>\ndisappointing.  It took 9 extra points of sta to increase hp by 1.  20 pts<br/>\ninto stamina still only increased hp by 1.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI know some of you have done this for human monks before.  Were the results<br/>\nsimilar, with the exception of better ac results for ag?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
