Don&#39;t you remember that silly weight restriction<br/>\nthing?  it gets more and more effective each level, and slowly your AC<br/>\ncreeps behind that of a warrior.   Monks are a very nimble tank, and they<br/>\npack a hell of a punch (excuse the pun).  We definately outdamage any silly<br/>\nwarrior whom decides to use a 2h, but the dual wielders that get heavy procs<br/>\nand awesome delay.. well they own us..<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe rest of your article basically reinstates yoru beliefs.. Monks very much<br/>\nso are tanks, more so then rogues, rangers, bards.  Monks were made at first<br/>\nto be the &quot;ultimate melee machien&quot; it&#39;s in our description!  But with the<br/>\nThulian Claws (at mid lvls) and those hard weps to get like Painbringer and<br/>\nsuch, a monks  built in ability to hit fast and hard is thwarted.. since a<br/>\nwarrior will outhit you (round wise) and in the long run out dmg you.<br/>\n<br/>\nMonks in no stretch of the imagination shoudl get mor HP, but we should get<br/>\na taunt since all other so called tanks, and real tanks get them.  Or<br/>\natleast let us use mend on our buddies... i hate seeing people die, when we<br/>\nhave so much at our disposal to save ourselves (mend, FD)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nwow a rant, sorry; i am a little mad and wound up today : )<br/>\nBroy</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
