Perhaps it is<br/>\nbecause I learn zones quickly and generally always<br/>\nknow where I am.  Buy a greater lightstone, memorize<br/>\nthe zone you are in, max out sense heading and always<br/>\nknow which way to run.  Thats the best advice I can<br/>\ngive.  I have a druid with infravision and it doesn&#39;t<br/>\nseem to be much of an improvement (still can&#39;t see<br/>\nanything in Misty Thicket)<br/>\n<br/>\nJust live with it<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond... I am level 17, i&#39;ve been hunt in oasis for 3<br/>\nlevels and I want to go somewhere else.  I was<br/>\nthinking of East Karana.
