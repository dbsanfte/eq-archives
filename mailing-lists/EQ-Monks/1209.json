Monks<br/>\nrole<br/>\nin a group is to do massive melee damge (reducing the  load on the casters<br/>\nmana<br/>\nat high levels).  To give us snare would weaken the ranger/druid role from<br/>\nthe<br/>\ngroup some. Snare would be AWSOME, but it would mean we monks become to<br/>\npowerful. able to solo in dungeons and area we were never meant to solo.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile on the subject of monk items:<br/>\nI have a question for all of you who did the treant fist quest.<br/>\nI have spent about 15hours (total in two marathon sessions) camping for the<br/>\nhumorous handheld mace off the alchemist in the  Xorb gorge.  I have killed<br/>\nthe<br/>\ntwo goblin guards there till I am blue in the face.  Nothing has made that<br/>\nalchemist spawn.  Is there a trick to doing so?  Last night I spent about 10<br/>\nhours at it (and I picked up the camp from a guy who had been there for 4<br/>\nhours<br/>\nbefore me and had to go to bed)  So if you think about it in 14 hours of<br/>\nnon-stop camping he never showed.  Anyone who has done the quest can help me<br/>\nout<br/>\nwith some advice?   I thought this guy was a 8-10 hour spawn?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n____________________Reply Separator____________________<br/>\nSubject:    Re: [EQ-Monks] Patch day is this wednesday!<br/>\nAuthor: &quot;RaceFace&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bean@...\">bean@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate:       01/18/2000 8:04 PM<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;RaceFace&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bean@...\">bean@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSnare would be great.
