Different grouyps are ideal for<br/>\ndifferent things  and in differrent environments.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example:<br/>\nMonks pull the best in dungeons(fein death).  I thinkg Bards do better<br/>\ninthe outdoors (with soothe and speedsong).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a Dungeon crawler myself Ihave come to develop an affinity for a group<br/>\nwith a certain KEY classes.<br/>\n<br/>\n1)  ENCHANTER - any group with an enchater ROCKS!! NO iffs and or butts.<br/>\nEnchanters make evacs obsolete (well almost almost)<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Cleric is a very NICE to-have but there are work arounds, like extra<br/>\nnukers ( to make the fight shorter) a druid and multiple hybrids<br/>\n(rangers and paladins, bards) to replace healing.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) It is always good to have a specialist puller. (usually thats me) Level<br/>\n36 monks have decnt hp, fein death and mend all of which, when combined<br/>\nwith an intricate knowledge of the dugeon mean they make excellent<br/>\npullers.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my opinion ther is no sustitute for coordination.  No matter what your<br/>\ngroup is composed of  - if the tanks start attacking the mob the enchater<br/>\njust mezzed or no one pays attention while the cleric is bashed to<br/>\ndeath... ther is going to be alot of bodies to collect.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA well organized group of players who know and appreciate teh skills of<br/>\nevery other player in their group, who have worked out exactly what each<br/>\nperson in the  group needs to do in any given situation is better off than<br/>\nany of the &quot;IDEAL&quot; groups described here without such planning.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have gone into the depths of lower guk with no healer no wizz and no<br/>\nenchanter - just 3 pallies, a rnager, a rogue and myself: we CLEANED up! -<br/>\nno deaths, plenty of exp.  All I am saying is the best groups are made by<br/>\nORGANIZATION and team work - not by any specific combination of classes<br/>\nand levels...<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my 2 coppers.<br/>\n<br/>\nHumbly submitted in Quellios name,<br/>\nAslam G&#39;Slamm,<br/>\nTarew marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
