By then you&#39;ll be able <br/>\nto camp a few things (by yourself) that can make you some money.<br/>\n<br/>\nRyugen<br/>\nBertoxxulous<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Steve Danuser &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:danu@...\">danu@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;CC: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:stats@...\">stats@...</a>, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:and@...\">and@...</a>, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:such@...\">such@...</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [EQ-Monks] Digest Number 62<br/>\n&gt;Date: Sat, 11 Sep 1999 14:44:24 -0500<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: Steve Danuser &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:danu@...\">danu@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;First off, let me say this list is great, and very informative.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I guess my best course of action at level 15 is to simply buy the best stat<br/>\n&gt;enhancing stuff I can as it comes available. Bottom line is to increase<br/>\n&gt;your stats as much as possible.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Which brings me to another question... when will I be able to afford this<br/>\n&gt;stuff? At what level do we start being able to get the big kills that earn<br/>\n&gt;us hundreds of plat? It&#39;s only recently that I&#39;ve been able to start having<br/>\n&gt;about 50pp in the bank at any time, and paying 35pp for a +5 AGI ring was a<br/>\n&gt;major investment for me. My main cash cow has been wisp hunting, but the<br/>\n&gt;experience I get killing them has started to diminish a lot. Killing Dervs<br/>\n&gt;is still okay, but doesn&#39;t get me much cash unless they have bronze.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I love not having to buy expensive armor and weapons all the time, but it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;getting to the point where I will need lots of cash to buy jewelry, rare<br/>\n&gt;items, etc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;By the way, how much should one pay for serpentine bracers?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;And at what level can I realistically hope to get journeyman&#39;s boots?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;_____________________________<br/>\n&gt;Moorgard, monk striving for Virtue<br/>\n&gt;Povar<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;ONElist:  your connection to people who share your interests.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
