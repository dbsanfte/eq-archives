This, however, is not suggested, as the ogre bouncers <br/>\n(guards) tend to roam all over, and it&#39;s very easy to get lost.  Also the <br/>\nswamp is very dangerous, because there are a few higher level mobs in the <br/>\narea, namely Jojongua the kobold.  That, and it&#39;s pretty easy to gather <br/>\nquite a crowd of frogs while you&#39;re fighting one.  Another idea, though, is <br/>\nto simply go to the swamp and auction to buy it.  There should be plenty of <br/>\nlow level trolls with some to sell.  Don&#39;t pay too much for it tho, as the <br/>\nprotection is equivalent to cloth.<br/>\n<br/>\nGetting to Qeynos isn&#39;t that difficult, and is definitely possible at your <br/>\nlevel.

What I need to know though is, is this armor somthing <br/>\n&gt;that I will actualy &quot;make&quot; (ex. making patch work armor out of hides) and <br/>\n&gt;if so, what do I need to do this? just a sewing kit, or do I need to use <br/>\n&gt;some of my traing ponits in a certain skill area?. I am now on the cusp of <br/>\n&gt;tenth LvL, Is that high enough to start hunting what ever creatures will <br/>\n&gt;&quot;give&quot; me netted/mesh?. Also, I am a Freeport monk, I hear much talk about <br/>\n&gt;the sewers of Qeynos (think that is the place) But nothing of were to hunt <br/>\n&gt;for the creatures I am looking for in my area. (Here is a VERY New&#39;b Q, If <br/>\n&gt;i do need to go to Qeynos, how do i get there, by boat or try it overland?)<br/>\n&gt;I thank you all in advance for your time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Zarvitz, monk of the 9th circle.<br/>\n&gt;&quot;May Quellios guide your mind so that you may guide your fists&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Show your ONElist SPIRIT!<br/>\n&gt;&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/tshirt2\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/tshirt2</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt;With a new ONElist SHIRT available through our website.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
