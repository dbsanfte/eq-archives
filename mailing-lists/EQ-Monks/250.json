I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; spent a lot of time looking into the game before I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bought and decided I would have the most fun playing a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; monk.  I started a Monk character and have been<br/>\n&gt; &gt; immensily satisfied, I am level 8. (I started in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; freeport)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Onto sashes.  I have had horrible experiences with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sashes.  I got the white sash at Level 2, you would<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have a hell of a time killing deathfist pawns at level<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 1 so I think most ppl get it at 2.  Anyway... by 5 I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; was out of the newbie area and began searching for the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; things needed for the yellow headband, to refresh our<br/>\n&gt; &gt; memory you need a Tarantula Chitin, a Deathfist<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Slashed Belt, and a Giant Snake Rattle.  I worked hard<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to get these items, and because I was trying at a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lower level than I should it was very difficult.  I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; managed to kill a tarantula with a group of 4 people.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I also found the  rattle and slashed belt this way.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Great I thought, I as level 6 and I was about to get<br/>\n&gt; &gt; something that most ppl can&#39;t get on their own till 7<br/>\n&gt; &gt; or 8.  I took the stuff back, turned it all in and I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; got nothing.  I was so pissed.  I had to go back to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; newbie area to find all the stuff I needed for white,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; then I went back and I was so pissed that I bought the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; giant snake rattle and chitin and managed to find<br/>\n&gt; &gt; someone to give me the slashed belt.  This time I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; turned it in and it worked.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m not looking forward to Orange tho.  I need a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Greater Lightstone, Legionaire&#39;s bracers, and a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Cutthroat insignia ring.  I have the latter and I can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; buy the former if I have to but I don&#39;t have a clue<br/>\n&gt; &gt; what the legionare&#39;s bracers are... its probably not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; worth the effort<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Worlord<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:worlord99@...\">worlord99@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ---<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hammeron<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 8th Circle Monk<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Karana Server<br/>\n&gt; &gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Bid and sell for free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://auctions.yahoo.com\">http://auctions.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Congrats to our GROW TO GIVE winners, ZENtertainment & ROTInews!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Check out ONElist&#39;s latest program, FRIENDS & FAMILY.
