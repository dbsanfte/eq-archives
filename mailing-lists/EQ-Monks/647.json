Instant level 4 and plenty of skill points to play with.  Not by<br/>\nhalf.  I have since abandoned the character because he can&#39;t pull his own<br/>\nweight in combat or spells as his skills are way underdeveloped and a<br/>\nmonster that /cons blue still whups him hard enough that he has to sit for<br/>\n20 minutes to regain hp & mana.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy new character is less than a week (RL) old, nearly reached level 7,<br/>\nhasn&#39;t twinked a thing and really kicks ass.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t recommend speed twinking to anyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nGenane<br/>\nCazic Thule<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Imari J.
