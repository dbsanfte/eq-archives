I<br/>\nwould LOVE to be in this but didn&#39;t read it til the 30th.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it WAS the 29th, can we have another THIS friday?<br/>\n<br/>\nSounds like an absoulute hoot )<br/>\n<br/>\nBorix (not a dillo)<br/>\nlvl 29 Karana<br/>\n___________________________________________________<br/>\nMessage: 4<br/>\n   Date: Fri, 29 Oct 1999 01:50:01 -0400<br/>\n   From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ablair@...\">ablair@...</a><br/>\nSubject: All Monk Event - Please Read<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been posting this on the message board at:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://server3.ezboard.com/beverquestmonks\">http://server3.ezboard.com/beverquestmonks</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I thought I&#39;d also post it here, as this is turning <br/>\nout to be a lot of fun and so far I&#39;ve had a lot of <br/>\nsupport.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvent: Monk Madness <br/>\n<br/>\nServer: Vallon Zek <br/>\n<br/>\nTime: Starting this Friday at 9PM eastern US time. That <br/>\nis GMT -5:00 for international monks. :)This will be an <br/>\nongoing event until Sunday Night. Play as little or as <br/>\nmuch of that as you want to. <br/>\n<br/>\nStory: An evil gnome wizard experimenting with cloning <br/>\ncaptured a lone human monk in Freeport, and tried to <br/>\nclone him. He inadvertently triggered a chain reaction <br/>\nand suddenly there spawns many many many monks. All <br/>\nidentical. Being of one mind they are also all of one <br/>\nguild, &quot;The Armadillos of Norrath&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nNaming: This is an event in which monks from all <br/>\nservers who may know each other from messageboards will <br/>\nparticipate. Therefore I think it is a great idea that <br/>\nwe use the naming convention &#39;&quot;your real monk <br/>\nname&quot;dillo&#39;. Or a variation thereof. Such that I am <br/>\ngoing to be Ipnodillo on vallon zek for the weekend. ;) <br/>\n<br/>\nGoal: Have fun. Group up with as many monks as you can <br/>\nand run around the zone punching everything in site. Go <br/>\non suicide missions. We&#39;ll be like ants. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo participate, create a new monk on Vallon Zek Friday <br/>\nNight. The monk should be the male version with the <br/>\nPriest of Discord face. We&#39;re gonna try to create a <br/>\nguild for this as well, so look for a guild officer to <br/>\ninvite you. Please try to keep your guild tunic on at <br/>\nall times so we have the monk &quot;look&quot; about us. Invite <br/>\nall your friends to attend. This is an event to have <br/>\nfun, not so heavy on the roleplaying, but lets just <br/>\nhave a LOT of fun. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo clarify, your monk should look like this: <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shada.com/pod.jpg\">http://www.shada.com/pod.jpg</a><br/>\n <br/>\nThe guild has been submitted. Lets all hope verant <br/>\napproves it! <br/>\n<br/>\nInvite your non monk friends who have always admired <br/>\nyour monkness as well! Lets try and make this event a <br/>\nlegend of it&#39;s own kind! :) <br/>\n<br/>\nJust think. Hundreds of Identical Newbie Monks... <br/>\n<br/>\nIpno Ashen<br/>\n20th Armadillo<br/>\nBrell Serilis<br/>\n&quot;The future just isn&#39;t what it used to be.&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
