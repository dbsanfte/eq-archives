YOU will<br/>\nneed a group.  <br/>\n<br/>\n1) Dungeons have better xp than outdoors - I think it is about 25% more<br/>\nfor killing the same level mob<br/>\n<br/>\n2)Dungeons have great loot - cashwise and item wise.  at 15 you are not<br/>\nready to camp for any good items yet but you can find mesh<br/>\neasily in guk.  also hangin out there you will see mesh and other cool<br/>\nthings auctioned at low prices often.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGo there with your group - you will need a Good group to get the most out<br/>\nof guk - healer and someone who can root are important.<br/>\n<br/>\njust some advice.<br/>\n<br/>\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ <br/>\nI.J.A.
