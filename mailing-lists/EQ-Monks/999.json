In the<br/>\ninterest<br/>\n&gt; of fairness, doesn&#39;t every PC in the game already have telepathy?  WIth<br/>\n&gt; group say, auction, OOC, Tell, and Sohut, Pcs are able to talk to<br/>\neachother<br/>\n&gt; over a large area.  I know that I have been in the hills of Queynos and<br/>\n&gt; have been talking to a friend of mine in Freeport.  Why should it be any<br/>\n&gt; different from the NPcs.
