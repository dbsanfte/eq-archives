A lot of it depends<br/>\nupon your typical role in a group. I usually hunt with a ranger and paladin,<br/>\nwho both taunt and we can spread the damage out rather nicely among our<br/>\ngroup. When outdoors, the ranger like to harmonize and do the pulling. When<br/>\nindoors, the job is usually mine.<br/>\n<br/>\nPraelor Dileasai<br/>\nMonk of The Forgotten Order<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: James [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wsjames@...\">wsjames@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, January 31, 2000 10:31 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [EQ-Monks] Monk Creation / Stats<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;James&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wsjames@...\">wsjames@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, folks, we all recently heard *with disappointment* about verant<br/>\nemployees posting about DEX and AGI - they seem to be a lot less important<br/>\nthan we hoped for.  In light of this new information - what do all you monks<br/>\nout there see as the most important stats for a monk, now? How would you<br/>\nfocus your items (ie STR? AC? HPS? AGI? DEX? STA?)? And how would you<br/>\ndistribute your starting points?  Maybe a few could name some equipment that<br/>\nbacks up their opinions.<br/>\nThanks in advance for everyone&#39;s input =)<br/>\n<br/>\nKyeric<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nFREE ADVICE FROM REAL PEOPLE!
