To get it to work, when the mob runs away, you need to run away too, <br/>\nhaving SOW or jboots works best, and you really need to be in an outside <br/>\nzone.  Run away and turn around so you can see the mob, if you are far enough <br/>\naway, you&#39;ll see it runnin back for you, that&#39;s when you FD.  Then whoever <br/>\nkills it will get exp.  If it&#39;s a mob that doesn&#39;t run away, just make sure <br/>\nwhen you FD, it stops attacking you.  If it doesn&#39;t then you didn&#39;t clear <br/>\nyour dmg.<br/>\n<br/>\nKanja<br/>\n50 monk<br/>\nRodcet Nife</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
