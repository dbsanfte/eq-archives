I went through the same thing at low levels.<br/>\nWhen I switched leather for mesh armor, which has the same ac but very<br/>\nlow weight, my AC went up over 40 points.  You could try swapping cloth<br/>\nfor patchwork.  If you swap any given piece and your AC stays the same<br/>\nor goes up, keep the cloth.  Then go get mesh as soon as you can.  It<br/>\nmight be hard on the PvP server, though, cause it&#39;s found in Guk, right<br/>\nin the middle of Troll territory.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\tSteve Hamner [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shamner@...\">shamner@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tTuesday, June 15, 1999 10:17 AM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq-monks@onelist.com\">eq-monks@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject:\t[EQ-Monks] Pls explain AC<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Steve Hamner&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shamner@...\">shamner@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am not sure where anyone got the 15 weight is the best for<br/>\n&gt; monks...can<br/>\n&gt; someone please explain this...My AC does not change when i drop down<br/>\n&gt; to or<br/>\n&gt; below 15, if anything it gets worse as I take my patchwork armor off.<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t believe this nonsense about the super low weight unless you are<br/>\n&gt; talking about encumbering weight.
