I have died a few times, but mostly because I get<br/>\ngreedy and think I can finish one off when I get low on hps.  You can always<br/>\nfeign if you get in trouble.  You should be able to solo them at lvl 22<br/>\n(just make sure you are full of hp&#39;s and have a mend available).  As far as<br/>\nspawns, you have to kill the greater skels to get gargoyles to spawn.  When<br/>\nyou leave try to leave one garg on the island since they do attack and kill<br/>\nthe skels, so the next person will come and have a few gargs already on<br/>\nisland.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can get there by taking ship from freeport and get off at first stop. I<br/>\nthink it is called sister isle.  Swim straight out from the dock until you<br/>\ncame to another island.  Follow that island around to right a little way and<br/>\nyou will see another island in the distance. That is garg island.  Hope this<br/>\nhelps.<br/>\n<br/>\nGeraden 22nd circle from Ashen Order<br/>\nQuellious.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Jeff Bleich &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dolph@...\">dolph@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Monks@onelist.com\">EQ-Monks@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, September 13, 1999 12:44 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ-Monks] Nybright Sisters and taking the lives of our fellow<br/>\nman<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Jeff Bleich&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dolph@...\">dolph@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Dornn, Level 17 Monk (Feign Death! Yeah, baby!), Brell Serilis, currently<br/>\n&gt;  hunting Gargoyles in the Ocean of Tears.&lt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thank god you mentioned gargoyles.  I&#39;m level 22nd monk from cazic thule<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; was wondering where I should hunt.  I&#39;ve hunted gorge hounds for the last<br/>\n3<br/>\n&gt; levels and I do not want to hunt avaiks due to the over crowded<br/>\npopulation.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m fully decked out with serpentines/exe hoods/black pearl so i&#39;m rather<br/>\n&gt; strong for my level.  I guess what I&#39;m asking is that What level are<br/>\n&gt; gargoyles and what island are they on? and do they respawn fast? any<br/>\ntrains?<br/>\n&gt; Can I solo?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Does anyone recomend Cazic thule? I friend of mine said it took her 2<br/>\nhours<br/>\n&gt; to find a group(24thmage) and died/zoned many of times.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Another question.  I have no boots. Leather is too heavy. They don&#39;t make<br/>\n&gt; mesh.  Anyone know where i can get good boots with low wieght?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks for your time,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Bismatal Bumrusher 22nd Circle<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;                Free Games & Cash Prizes!<br/>\n&gt;  Gamesville - The World&#39;s Biggest & Best Game Show Site!<br/>\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/gamesville2\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/gamesville2</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
