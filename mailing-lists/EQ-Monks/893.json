I&#39;m <br/>\ngonna guess that most mobs in upper guk are green for you, or close to it.  <br/>\nWhen you are above the lvl of the mob by a certain amount, then you won&#39;t <br/>\nalways pull all of them if don&#39;t see you.  At lvl 50, I can pull single <br/>\nsolusek kobolds because some are green, and even when they are low blue, most <br/>\nevery time, I can just stand and wait for one to see me, then yell and run at <br/>\nme, but the other won&#39;t come because I&#39;m too high lvl for them.  So this is <br/>\nwhy your throwing a star or knife at them works on easier mobs, but not on <br/>\nthe harder ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nKanja <br/>\n50 monk<br/>\nRodcet Nife</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
