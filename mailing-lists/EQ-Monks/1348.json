Equating Twinking with kill stealing is wrong.  KSing is anti-social and directly harms others.  Twinking, while it can be argued of an indirect ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-626873451\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;I am sorry, but is this discussion about twinking or the fact that you<br/>\n&gt;started playing the game before I did?  It sounds like you have some issues<br/>\n&gt;to deal with here and are very hostile about this discussion.  I started<br/>\n&gt;this thread as an intelleuctual discussion, not a flame war.  Twinkers have<br/>\n&gt;no more rights than Kill stealers in my estimation.  Do you feel that we<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Equating Twinking with kill stealing is wrong.  KSing is anti-social and<br/>\ndirectly &quot;harms&quot; others.  Twinking, while it can be argued of an indirect<br/>\napproach, does not.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;who started after you automatically owe you repsect because you have played<br/>\n&gt;a GAME longer than we have?  I don&#39;t think so.  I, too, spend my time in<br/>\n&gt;dungeons, dying and dying again, in the search for elusive  items and<br/>\n&gt;experience.  Items and experience are becoming harder and harder to find<br/>\n&gt;due to server overcrowding and spawn camping.  To me, you were lucky that<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What&#39;s with respect?  So I&#39;ve been playing for a year - I&#39;ve put in more<br/>\ntime, I&#39;ve paid more money, I&#39;ve seen more things - does that mean you owe<br/>\nme respect?  Hardly.  Sorta a life metaphor...  My parents have more money<br/>\nthan me, have more possessions, have more everything it seems - I&#39;m scraping<br/>\nby and trying to buy a crappy home and they&#39;re cruising the states,<br/>\nretirement style.  So if they have a kid, they&#39;ll probably give that kid a<br/>\nlot more than they gave me... they have the resources for it.  Not fair?<br/>\nSure.  Does it really change my life or actions?  Hell no.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;you didn&#39;t have to deal with people camping spawning points early in the<br/>\n&gt;ife of the game.  It was probably easier for you to find creatures of the<br/>\n&gt;appropriate level.  When I go out looking, I often find that people will<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yea.  Obviously next time a new server goes up, create a monk in Freeport<br/>\nand see how long it takes you to get to level 2.  This is neither here nor<br/>\nthere, but this is a serious case of &quot;The Grass Is Greener....&quot;   Contrary<br/>\nto popular belief, it gets much harder to get exp at higher levels, because<br/>\nthe load of exp bearing creatures that don&#39;t require 17 groups to hold down<br/>\ngets smaller and smaller.  Like I said, not really on topic.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;jump on monsters, yelling &quot;Mine!  Mine&quot;, like some 2 year old, because they<br/>\n&gt;need the XP or the items.  Do not make assupmtions about me.  I do not take<br/>\n&gt;for granted that I can buy serp bracers for 200pp or any of the other<br/>\n&gt;things.  Why?  Because I play this game for adventuring purposes.  At 17th<br/>\n&gt;level, I figured that the 200 pp I had stashed away would last me quite a<br/>\n&gt;while.  That is 200pp I earned the hard way.  No one gave it to me.  It is<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Get off the cross, we need the wood.  99% of all players have gone through<br/>\nthis.  And by the way, I didn&#39;t have my first 200 pp until I was well into<br/>\nmy 20&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;twinking that is one of the causes of the drop in prices for items.  If<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Bull - absolute bull.  Twinkers aren&#39;t selling the items they&#39;re wearing.<br/>\nLower prices, more supply.  Less Supply, higher prices.  Perhaps you&#39;ve<br/>\nheard of it?  The ole &quot;Supply and Demand&quot; theory.  I just can&#39;t figure out<br/>\nwhy a glowing stein is still selling for 250 pp on Quell.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;every 6th level character has access ti items intended for a 20th level<br/>\n&gt;character, those items will decrease in value.  As for the fact that you<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So by your theory...  if there was a magic level limit and such...  the<br/>\nprices would go up???  No, you&#39;ve created a higher inventory with a smaller<br/>\nconsumer base.  In other words, you&#39;ve made a bad situation worse.   Again,<br/>\nthis is part of my revolutionary &quot;With greater supply comes cheaper prices&quot;<br/>\ntheory.  Twinkers cause prices to fall?  Puh-lease.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;shouldn&#39;t have to invest 9 months into a new character:  Why not?  Are you<br/>\n&gt;afraid that you will get bored?  You already have intimate knowledge of<br/>\n&gt;most of the areas of the world that you can use to your advantage.  Why<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The fact that it was his 9 months and his items means he can do any damn<br/>\nthing he wants to.  Including, but not limited to, creating a Troll<br/>\nEnchanter and trying to twink it&#39;s INT up to 500.<br/>\n<br/>\nshould you add the capability of walking around with items that your<br/>\ncharacter would never have had to chance to obtain?  To be honest, I do not<br/>\nhave a problem with a character getting a sword or a piece of armor from<br/>\nsomeone, even another of the PCs that a player owns..  There are plenty of<br/>\nhistorical and fantasy based accounts of this, but when someone steps onto<br/>\nthe stage, a new character, decked out in itmes that should belong to a<br/>\n10th level or 20th level or 30th level characters, it really cheeses those<br/>\nof us who are trying to earn the items legitimately.  Every item that goes<br/>\ninto a twinkers hands, is one less that I or another honest player can earn.<br/>\n<br/>\nBUZZ!!!!  Thank you for playing!  Except for the MASSIVELY rare spawns,<br/>\nthere are several holes in your theory.  First, most of the ultra-rare items<br/>\nare on very very high level creatures.  So honest player #1 that is level 18<br/>\n- sorry, you would never legitimately get this item.  Secondly, most of the<br/>\nservers that have been around for a while... there&#39;s at least 2,000 of<br/>\neverything it seems, except as I said, the ultra rares, that honest players<br/>\nhave no chance of getting while they&#39;re young.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwink used to really mean something.  Now all it means is someone who has<br/>\nbetter stuff than you do.<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nGET A NEXTCARD VISA, in 30 seconds.
