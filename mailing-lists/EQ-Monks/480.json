Monk BY FAR outdamage any other melee <br/>\nclass.  My lvl 50 magician has an earth elemental pet, and nobody can come <br/>\nclose to outdamaging it other than a lvl 50 monk.  The reason we don&#39;t make <br/>\ngreat tanks is one, hit points.  We don&#39;t get nearly as many as warrriors, <br/>\nbut our AC is fairly close if we choose to wear AC type armor.  I myself <br/>\ndon&#39;t, I choose to go with stat increasing items, dex and agl.  Right now at <br/>\nlvl 40, I can outdamage any other melee class with very decent equipment.  I <br/>\ncan hardly wait to get my sash and up past 45, I&#39;ve seen what my friends can <br/>\ndo and it is amazing.<br/>\n<br/>\n        Kanja Dragonfist<br/>\n        40th monk<br/>\n        Rodcet Nife</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
