I thought I would add my two coppers from my experience.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nQ: Please tell me if I&#39;ve just got to insist this way or if wisps in other zones will carry greater lightstones more often? \r<br/>\nA: Greater lightstones are not more common on different wisps in different places.  It is totaly random.  I have hunted wisps in Gr Fay, Misty Thicket, Karanas, Q Hills and Kerra Isle.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nQ: Are there zones with more wisps?\r<br/>\nA: In my opinion, the best zone is Kerra Isle.  Have to watch for campers, though.  Try to either group with some campers or see if you can join up with a ranger for tracking.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nGantork &lt;Clan Cathar&gt; of the Povar Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
