As the moderator, I was getting <br/>\na little worried. Well, some of the early inactivity is due to the fact that <br/>\nI haven&#39;t been on AOL in over a month because I switched to another service. <br/>\nAlso, probably the bigger reason (this will really seem like backstabbing on <br/>\nthis list, but....) I&#39;ve switched to Rallos Zek. I find it DOES offer a <br/>\nbetter role playing enviroment and it really adds to the fun of the game when <br/>\na huge swarm of trolls/ogres/DEs attacks Freeport and whatnot. People can&#39;t <br/>\njust go around being jerks, or people will kill them. Most people say, &quot;Oh, <br/>\nZek, that&#39;s where everyone gets randomly PKed.&quot; Well, that&#39;s simply not true, <br/>\nI live in Grobb and Nek Forest, and I hear about maybe one or two instances a <br/>\nday, mostly RPing. In case you haven&#39;t picked up on it, I recommend this <br/>\nserver highly! I really can&#39;t even think about going back to the other <br/>\nservers now, they just seem so dry. I don&#39;t really know what onelist will <br/>\nthink if the moderator deletes his E-Mail account, so I&#39;d like to see about <br/>\npassing that position to someone else who is still active on Cazic. So, <br/>\nE-Mail me if you would like to take over that bare-bones position. There&#39;s <br/>\nreally very little to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br/>\n\t\t\t-Adam<br/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br/>\n\t\t\tAKA Grolm, Ralel, and Railz\t\t\t\t<br/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ton <br/>\nZek (give me a tell!)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
