They can heal, do damge, tank so so, levitate, invis, track, <br/>\nsneak, safe fall, teleport, charm,run damn fast, mez,...the list goes on and <br/>\non. If there were some sort of obstacle course lets say, a stretch of <br/>\nnothing, then water, then many low level agro&#39;s, some more water, then the <br/>\nneed to find someone in a crowd quickly, then a decent sized fall, followed <br/>\nup by killing some sort of monster. What class would win? The bard of course, <br/>\nhe can do all that and more easily (im thinking of say a 40 bard and 40 other <br/>\nclasess). All the classes that can lev have to swim in the water, all the <br/>\nclasses that cant run fast lose time during the runs, those that cant invis <br/>\nget beat on by the lil mobbies; See what im going at here?<br/>\nAnyways, just my lil thoughts<br/>\n<br/>\nRenaldo Rallentando (who in no way lets the fact that he&#39;s a bard bias any <br/>\noppinions :P )</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
