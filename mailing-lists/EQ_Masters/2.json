A VERY effective way of hunting wisps is to pair a<br/>\ncombine-wielding ranger with a cleric. The ranger can be the tank, cleric<br/>\ncan heal, attack with spirit hammer and burn the wisps.  The advantage of a<br/>\nranger is even in zones where wisps are not common, he can track them.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI like hunting wisps at night, where you can pick and choose those<br/>\nwisps that give off light vs. the ones that dont.  I personally get about 1<br/>\ngreater lightstone to 4 lessers when hunting wisps.  You can also tell if a<br/>\nwisp has a lesser or greater lightstone by the radius of the light.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tLago the Wisp-Hunting Bard of Bertoxxulos(sp.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMessage: 1<br/>\n\t   Date: 28 Apr 1999 00:30:58 -0000<br/>\n\t   From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:thormael@...\">thormael@...</a><br/>\n\tSubject: Hunting wisps<br/>\n<br/>\n\tHi,<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI have a question for you masters out there.
