<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-857437286">When I drink a little, my strength goes up and my intelligence goes down. When I drink a lot my strength goes up and my agility, dexterity, and intelligence go down.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I have heard that drinking increases some stats and decreases others?<br/>
  Does anyone know what stats and how much?<br/>
  Does the alcolhol tolerance skill offset any of the penalties if so how much?<br/>
  What is a good drink for raising skill and a good drink for actual use when going into combat?<br/>
