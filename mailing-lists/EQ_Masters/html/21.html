<div id="ygrps-yiv-1865814488">Im going to interpret most powerful as most versatile :)<br/>
Bards of course. They can heal, do damge, tank so so, levitate, invis, track, <br/>
sneak, safe fall, teleport, charm,run damn fast, mez,...the list goes on and <br/>
on. If there were some sort of obstacle course lets say, a stretch of <br/>
nothing, then water, then many low level agro&#39;s, some more water, then the <br/>
need to find someone in a crowd quickly, then a decent sized fall, followed <br/>
up by killing some sort of monster. What class would win? The bard of course, <br/>
he can do all that and more easily (im thinking of say a 40 bard and 40 other <br/>
clasess). All the classes that can lev have to swim in the water, all the <br/>
classes that cant run fast lose time during the runs, those that cant invis <br/>
get beat on by the lil mobbies; See what im going at here?<br/>
Anyways, just my lil thoughts<br/>
<br/>
Renaldo Rallentando (who in no way lets the fact that he&#39;s a bard bias any <br/>
oppinions :P )</div>
