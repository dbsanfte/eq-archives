<div id="ygrps-yiv-308667094">Hmm, glad to see this list is getting active. As the moderator, I was getting <br/>
a little worried. Well, some of the early inactivity is due to the fact that <br/>
I haven&#39;t been on AOL in over a month because I switched to another service. <br/>
Also, probably the bigger reason (this will really seem like backstabbing on <br/>
this list, but....) I&#39;ve switched to Rallos Zek. I find it DOES offer a <br/>
better role playing enviroment and it really adds to the fun of the game when <br/>
a huge swarm of trolls/ogres/DEs attacks Freeport and whatnot. People can&#39;t <br/>
just go around being jerks, or people will kill them. Most people say, &quot;Oh, <br/>
Zek, that&#39;s where everyone gets randomly PKed.&quot; Well, that&#39;s simply not true, <br/>
I live in Grobb and Nek Forest, and I hear about maybe one or two instances a <br/>
day, mostly RPing. In case you haven&#39;t picked up on it, I recommend this <br/>
server highly! I really can&#39;t even think about going back to the other <br/>
servers now, they just seem so dry. I don&#39;t really know what onelist will <br/>
think if the moderator deletes his E-Mail account, so I&#39;d like to see about <br/>
passing that position to someone else who is still active on Cazic. So, <br/>
E-Mail me if you would like to take over that bare-bones position. There&#39;s <br/>
really very little to do.<br/>
