<div id="ygrps-yiv-366970588">There are definitely more wisps in some zones than in others.  <br/>
<br/>
	On Antonica the zones I know contain wisps:<br/>
<br/>
	Misty Thicket (infrequent)<br/>
	West Commonlands (frequent, but one dangerous place to hunt)<br/>
	East Commonlands (frequent)<br/>
	West Karena (frequent but scattered)<br/>
	Qeynos Hills (infrequent)<br/>
<br/>
	I am sure there are more, but these are the ones that immediately<br/>
come to mind.  A VERY effective way of hunting wisps is to pair a<br/>
combine-wielding ranger with a cleric. The ranger can be the tank, cleric<br/>
can heal, attack with spirit hammer and burn the wisps.  The advantage of a<br/>
ranger is even in zones where wisps are not common, he can track them.<br/>
<br/>
	I like hunting wisps at night, where you can pick and choose those<br/>
wisps that give off light vs. the ones that dont.  I personally get about 1<br/>
greater lightstone to 4 lessers when hunting wisps.  You can also tell if a<br/>
wisp has a lesser or greater lightstone by the radius of the light.<br/>

<br/>
	Hi,<br/>
<br/>
	I have a question for you masters out there. I&#39;m currently in the<br/>
process of hunting willowisps in greater faydark and barely found a couple<br/>
regular lighstones on them. Please tell me if I&#39;ve just got to insist this<br/>
way or if wisps in other zones will carry greater lightstones more often?<br/>
Are there zones with more wisps?<br/>
<br/>
