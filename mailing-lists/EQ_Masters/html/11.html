<div id="ygrps-yiv-1060934765">I just joined the list and I saw the message about wisps posted by Thormael early on.  I thought I would add my two coppers from my experience.<br/>
<br/>
Q: Please tell me if I&#39;ve just got to insist this way or if wisps in other zones will carry greater lightstones more often? <br/>
A: Greater lightstones are not more common on different wisps in different places.  It is totaly random.  I have hunted wisps in Gr Fay, Misty Thicket, Karanas, Q Hills and Kerra Isle.<br/>
<br/>
Q: Are there zones with more wisps?<br/>
A: In my opinion, the best zone is Kerra Isle.  Have to watch for campers, though.  Try to either group with some campers or see if you can join up with a ranger for tracking.<br/>
