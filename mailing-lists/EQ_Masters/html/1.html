<div id="ygrps-yiv-1782978869">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I have a question for you masters out there. I&#39;m currently in the process of hunting willowisps in greater faydark and barely found a couple regular lighstones on them. Please tell me if I&#39;ve just got to insist this way or if wisps in other zones will carry greater lightstones more often? Are there zones with more wisps?<br/>
