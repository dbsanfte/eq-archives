<div id="ygrps-yiv-1879419112">I am currently a level 8 ranger in Qeynos and I was wondering what and where I should hunt for money! I am practicing Fletching and after crafting my first elm bow I only have about 2pp in bank. Lots of people say I need to get some armor better than patchwork, but I can&#39;t afford it! So please, if ye know of a good area around here for me (other than BB) please tell me!<br/>
