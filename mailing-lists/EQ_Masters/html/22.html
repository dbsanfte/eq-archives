&lt;&lt; Which class, in your opinion, is the most <br/>
 powerful overall? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
i&#39;m going to have to dissagree with the answer of a bard... look at the class <br/>
that no one complains about... thats how you tell which is most powerfull... <br/>
and of course.. its the magician... We can solo easily up to mid 30&#39;s and are <br/>
completly self sufficient... i can go on an island somewhere in oot and hunt <br/>
there for 20 levels strait never having to leave except for spells... A <br/>
magician is basically a wizzard with a built in tank... as well as a few <br/>
other features such as summoning some very powerfull weapons... no we can&#39;t <br/>
kite... and no we can&#39;t heal... but we sure can kill... i&#39;ve been soloing <br/>
reds and yellows for my entier 29 levels as a magician... now thats <br/>
powerfull...</div>
