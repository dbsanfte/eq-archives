Seems like the lined ones are too expensive or their skill isn&#39;t<br/>\nhigh enough to create a demand.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do pretty good begging.  But still it is a worthless skill.  I usually<br/>\nonly get &quot;1 copper&quot;, occasionally (maybe 1 out of 100 tries) get 1 silver.<br/>\nThe only difference is that the frequency of getting anything has increased.<br/>\nAnd I&#39;m much more confident now to beg &quot;reds&quot;, and get money from them as<br/>\nwell.  I have never had any faction problems with it.  That only happens if<br/>\nyou attack it and they die.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again!<br/>\nTanana - Bristlebane<br/>\nMaster Brewer<br/>\nMaster Potter<br/>\nExcellent Beggar (soon to be master)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Xillitil of Povar&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:xillitil@...\">xillitil@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nstill never heard anything definite on deities...was rumors a while back <br/>\nthat the cookie cutter sketches were involved, but no luck with anything  <br/>\ntried...<br/>\nas far as i know, skill maxes at 168 with lined poison vials.<br/>\nwas selling around 1 - 1.5 for normal vials before, but prices may rise a <br/>\nbit since enchanters will need them too once the new spells work...sold 40 <br/>\nfor 2pp each yesterday to one...<br/>\nthink i was asking 2-3 for lined, but not much luck selling them...still got<br/>\n<br/>\n80 left from maxing my skill...<br/>\n<br/>\nalso how is begging? haven&#39;t met too many who have built up that skill...and<br/>\n<br/>\nhave heard rumors of faction problems with it?<br/>\n<br/>\nXillitil/Povar<br/>\n(Master potter,cook,brewer,smith,fletcher, learning jeweler and <br/>\ntailor...skills are fun :)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
