I just have one question...<br/>\n&gt;I have a 120 currently in pottery and have tried to make mixing bowls. I <br/>\n&gt;made them with no problems, but having 7 backpacks on me for materials, when <br/>\n&gt;i successfully fired the bowl, it droped to the ground because a container <br/>\n&gt;can&#39;t be stored in another container..... now, how in the world are you <br/>\n&gt;doing this efficiently? As it is, I have a better/faster time making pie <br/>\n&gt;tins..... any help would be greatly appreciated!!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I feel your pain --- the same thing happened to me when I first got into<br/>\npottery using jars.  Here&#39;s what I ended up doing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPut the unfinished bowls into backpacks.  It&#39;s not a container until after<br/>\nyou&#39;ve fired it in a kiln.  Get another backpack full of firing sheets.<br/>\nPut everything else into the bank, and just carry a backpack of unfinished<br/>\nbowls and a backpack of firing sheets.  Fire bowls until you fill up your<br/>\nremaining inventory, and then go sell.  Repeat as required.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Pennaggolan, Baker, Brewer, Potter - who does the occasional bit of<br/>\nwizard-work on the side.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
