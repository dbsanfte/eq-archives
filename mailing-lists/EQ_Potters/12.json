He is not in<br/>\nthe first 3 single buildings (no Inn, just buildings) so I continued<br/>\non.  There is then an Inn on the left side of path where there is<br/>\nusually a single guard.  He was not in the two single buildings<br/>\nnext to the inn, so I tried the Inn itself.  Two merchants were there,<br/>\nnot with that name or firing sheets, and one was on top of the<br/>\nbuilding.  The one on top of the building did not have that name<br/>\nthough (some generic name like Innkeep Frank).<br/>\n<br/>\nAm I missing something or is this not the right Inn?  ALL I WANT<br/>\nARE SOME FIRING SHEETS...seems like it should be simple.<br/>\nWhy would Verant make it so hard to do trade skills?  It&#39;s not like<br/>\nyou can make much money from them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again for the help.<br/>\n<br/>\n                                                    A frustrated wanna-be<br/>\npotter,<br/>\n<br/>\n                                                                Soren<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:BobbiS7@...\">BobbiS7@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:BobbiS7@...\">BobbiS7@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 5/25/1999 5:43:23 AM Pacific Daylight Time,<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Potters@onelist.com\">EQ_Potters@onelist.com</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    From: Donald Taber &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dtaber@...\">dtaber@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well Met Soren<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  Where can I get firing sheets around Freeport?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; East Commonlands at the first INN.
