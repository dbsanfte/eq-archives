The <br/>\nkiln and pottery wheel is right next to a pottery supplier. Although you <br/>\nhave to buy the sketches at Kelethin or Freeport, these are stackable and <br/>\ntake minimal space. I mastered pottery in no time (making pie tins galore) <br/>\nat Kaladim. Water can be purchased at one of the guardhouses just outside <br/>\nKaladim.<br/>\n<br/>\nKelethin is also a reasonable place to do pottery, since the whole city is <br/>\none zone, you don&#39;t have to load anything to get all your supplies and to <br/>\nget to the equipment. You might get lost tho )<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso a question, anyone know how to make a small deity?<br/>\nAlso where might i purchase a mixing bowl and pot sketch?<br/>\n<br/>\nYati of Povar<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
