I got a few customers from advertising on message boards.<br/>\nOthers I&#39;ve gotten in game.  At first I used to keep vials in stock and<br/>\noccasionally check /w rogue and ask any rogue of high enough level if they<br/>\nwere interested in buying or if they have any friends that were interested.<br/>\nIf I find a good customer I put them on my friends list.  Now I just give<br/>\nthem a tell and see if they want any and what kind (I only have about 3<br/>\nregular customers).  I never have stock anymore because they usually buy<br/>\nwhat ever I make.  I sell the vials for a reasonable price to keep good<br/>\ncustomers.  I also try to save items they may need to make poison.  Poison<br/>\nskill is so time consuming as it is, they may as well save some time & buy<br/>\nthe vials as oppose to making them.  Don&#39;t let anyone convince you that<br/>\npottery is not profitable.  It is, just need to be a good merchant.<br/>\n<br/>\nTanana<br/>\nMaster Brewer, Potter, Beggar<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:alliani@...\">alliani@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:alliani@...\">alliani@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: April 30, 2000 8:52 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Potters@egroups.com\">EQ_Potters@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [EQ_Potters] General question:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGetting a bit discouraged here....<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve only recently taken up pottery, I reached level 48 just today.<br/>\nInformation online is sketchy and inconsistent but I&#39;ve been doing<br/>\npretty good at piecing things together by going through this list&#39;s<br/>\narchives, using the Guide in the game or, when all else fails, trial<br/>\nand error.  All in all I&#39;ve found it&#39;s fun and I&#39;ve only &quot;lost&quot; around<br/>\n4pp (was less than that but my (lack of) success rate with bowls<br/>\ntotally screwed up my profit/loss numbers).  However, when I asked a<br/>\nRogue/Potter friend of mine about the medium bowls (wondering if there<br/>\nwere something a little easier I should be making at this time) all I<br/>\ngot was &quot;Pottery is a pretty useless skill unless you&#39;re a Rogue.  Why<br/>\ndo you want to take up pottery?&quot;  ... Well, cuz I want to, dangit,<br/>\nthat&#39;s why! ...  But since his question this afternoon, two other<br/>\nfolks asked me just about the same thing - &quot;Why?&quot;...  I don&#39;t have<br/>\nvisions of becoming independantly wealthy from the skill though I<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t mind if it brought in a little coin.  Is this &quot;just a hobby&quot;<br/>\nthat&#39;s going to always cost more than it makes me?  Or is it possible<br/>\nto actually profit (or at least break even) in the future?<br/>\n<br/>\nTIA!!<br/>\n<br/>\nLliani<br/>\nKarana Server<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nNow the best and coolest websites come right to you based on your <br/>\nunique interests. eTour.com is surfing without searching. <br/>\nAnd, it&#39;s FREE!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/3013/0/_/444581/_/957153283/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/3013/0/_/444581/_/957153283/</a><br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
