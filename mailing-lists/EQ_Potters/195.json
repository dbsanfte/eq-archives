My server is not up yet so I<br/>\ncannot say what the SELL price is. As soon as I can I will repost.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther prices generally lower with the lowest around 1sp. I assume they want<br/>\npeople to still be able to gain skill ... up until the high level it appears.<br/>\n<br/>\n2 new sketches:<br/>\nVial<br/>\nSealed Vial?<br/>\n<br/>\nFor poison maybe??? This is from memory as i am not logged on. There may have<br/>\nbeen three vial sketches instead of 2.
