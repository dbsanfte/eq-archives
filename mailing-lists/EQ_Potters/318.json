I thought I&#39;d stop by and lend a hand. <br/>\n<br/>\nSealed vials are currently not craftable by players, despite the sketch being available on a vendor. Our craft designer is currently looking at poison and pottery, and they&#39;ll be getting an update after the New Year. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the sealed vial does become craftable, you&#39;ll see the recipe listed in your book. <br/>\n<br/>\n-Gordon<br/>\n<br/>\nI found this on the safe house message board.  I know no one answered my sealed vial post, but in case you were thinking about it.  I guess don&#39;t bother.  I wonder how much this applies to brewing.<br/>\n<br/>\nTanana (Bristlebane)<br/>\nMaster Brewer, Potter, Beggar</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
