Some of the ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1035661059\">I recently started in pottery, but I started to make items to work with<br/>\nmy baking skill.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have heard of people able to make money from pottery.  Some of the<br/>\nitems you can make (such as the pie tin) can be sold to the store for a<br/>\nfew gold over the cost of the parts.  While this isn&#39;t the massive amounts<br/>\nof platinum I have heard of people making off of smithing, I have only spent<br/>\na few plat raising my skill and it seems to go up very quickly.  I put only<br/>\none training point into pottery and now have a 30 or so while only spending<br/>\na few plat (assuming you can make some items you can sell back to the<br/>\nstores).<br/>\n<br/>\nYou may be able to make more off of some of the higher level pottery<br/>\nitems, but as I said I only have a 30 skill or so.  I would guess if you are<br/>\njust looking to make money, you can make a little with pottery, but this<br/>\nshould not be your first choice.  Do it for role-playing or to support<br/>\nanother trade skill.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSoren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nkale usi wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: kale usi &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kaleusi@...\">kaleusi@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Not sure what the benefits are for this skill. I can say, that seems like<br/>\n&gt; everyone has taken the more popular/profitable skills - smithing,<br/>\n&gt; bowyer/fletching, jeweler and a few have taken cooking and/or brewing. I can<br/>\n&gt; tell you this much about the other skills, they take a ton of cash to<br/>\n&gt; improve them. If anyone could enlighten us all, I&#39;d be much abliged.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; _______________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Get Free Email and Do More On The Web.
