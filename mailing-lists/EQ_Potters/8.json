Could you","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1934434111\">Howdy Chefs<br/>\n<br/>\nOn EQ_Potters I uploaded a screen capture of Kiln and Pottery Wheel.<br/>\nOvens seem to be plentiful in Freeport, but as anyone used a SPIT?<br/>\nCould you screenprint (Saves as .bmp) and by request convert to JPG.<br/>\nUpload into the shared files.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have seen baking as a nickle and dime profit if is stick with Rat ears<br/>\nand Firebeetle Eyes for Edible Goo.  You get an average of 2s2c.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith Wolf/Bear Meat - Spices (3c) - Short Beer (varies 1s ish). <br/>\nYou can make fine braised steaks.   Candied Spider legs also<br/>\nare foragable if you have Frosting and Spices.   <br/>\nThe problem I&#39;ve had is saving a Large Sack just for <br/>\ncooking ingredients and Backpack for the Pottery/Smithing supplies.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn army fights on it&#39;s stomach, so not having to buy rations helps.<br/>\nI havn&#39;t been able to afford out right buying a mixing bowl in<br/>\nWest Freeport - 1P2g5s.   The sketches available to potters does <br/>\nnot include a mixing bowl.  Any clues?<br/>\n<br/>\nI see Baking deserts with the right tins and pans as potentially<br/>\nprofitable in the field or during an event with Flea market wares.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just recently was able to make pottery skewers after several <br/>\nattempts.  Haven&#39;t baked anything with them yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems that baking is an &#39;after&#39; skill of Smithing and Pottery.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nCleric Taven (Veeshan)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
