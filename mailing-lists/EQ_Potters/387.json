I&#39;ve still got a fair bit of work to do.  Zombie skins are not as<br/>\ncommon as they used to seem to be.  I seem to remember that every merchant<br/>\nunder the sun would have a few zombie skins in their inventory no matter how<br/>\nfar zombies were to them.  Now, I&#39;m lucky to find more than a few in the<br/>\nzone!<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Lots of us Mud Slingers are hanging out at the Trader&#39;s Corner<br/>\n&gt; www.eqtraders.com<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There is a 3rd Wisdom Diety made from the Sands of Ro.<br/>\n&gt; Currently /Bugged since it does fit in Off-Hand, but not the<br/>\n&gt; Ranged weapons slot as well excludes Shamans.<br/>\n<br/>\nYakatazima (sp?) has promised that it&#39;ll be fixed in the next major patch.<br/>\nHuzzah!  I&#39;ve had quite the success so far vending my Prot & Res deities,<br/>\nbut I&#39;ve noticed its starting to taper off already.  I&#39;d gotten up to the<br/>\npoint where I was carrying a backpack of each, but I&#39;m cutting back down to<br/>\none again.<br/>\n/em sighs.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Curious: Backstabbing Babe<br/>\n&gt; Have you stopped by www.thesafehouse.org yet?<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, yes!  An invaluable resource for us roguelings.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Niami has Poison Vendors on her site as well.<br/>\n&gt; I usually make my own vials, but Toxdilla in West Freeport tunnels.<br/>\n&gt; Head right out of the West Gate to the hidden wall.<br/>\n<br/>\nI found him last night.  I&#39;d found the hidden entrance to the *left* of the<br/>\ngate, but had missed Toxdil&#39;s entrance.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; And another vendor out in West Karana close to the North Karana borders.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Even if you haven&#39;t hit your 20th season... you COULD be<br/>\n&gt; making poisions right now.  My Bar Wench on Morrell-Thule is<br/>\n&gt; still too young to apply her toxins, but has disproved the notion<br/>\n&gt; that she had to wait until her 20th to use a Mortar & Pestal to<br/>\n&gt; make spider and snake poisons!<br/>\n<br/>\nI had the adventure last night of Sneak/Hiding my way to the merchant in<br/>\nDragnor&#39;s Cauldron last night.  Got to him, bought my mortor and a stack of<br/>\nplain suspensions, and got attacked.  Luckily, another NPC was around and<br/>\ndismissed the skel & gob that found me together.  I re-S/H and started out<br/>\nto BB when a Gob Mariner saw through and pulpified me.  I got everything<br/>\nrecovered and I&#39;ve re-settled back in Freeport  :-)<br/>\nQuestion:  Is Make Poisons a skill that requires a skill point to be used to<br/>\n&quot;prime&quot; it, like some of the skills (Backstab) or is it along the lines of<br/>\nthe true trade skills and will go up by itself?  At approximately 2-3pp per<br/>\nattempt (1p+ vial, 6g+ suspension, plus value of venom sacs), it&#39;s a bit<br/>\nexpensive to practice on.  I might take a few attempts at it, but depending<br/>\non whether I get skill increases, may let it go till I can invest points<br/>\ninto it.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; EverFaithful<br/>\n&gt; Cleric Taven </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
