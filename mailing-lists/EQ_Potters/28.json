I only found this since I was<br/>\nmaking fillets to raise to (82).  This is basically the same as Turgims<br/>\nFierce Brew in brewing, which I have found will make about the same<br/>\nplat if you want it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m looking for what to bake to raise my skill and what items may have<br/>\nbenefits to them.  The reason I don&#39;t care about telling people there<br/>\nis profit to be made is, it really doesn&#39;t hurt anyone, at least some<br/>\npeople will camp the ovens instead of MOB camps.  8)<br/>\n<br/>\nBesides you will tire of it after about 10-20 plat hehe,<br/>\nSamiba Craftsman<br/>\n<br/>\n--- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:makaspro@...\">makaspro@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:makaspro@...\">makaspro@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From an earlier post, OT<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;If all you want to do is a trade to make money,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;pottery is not the one.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Baking is a good one, up to 30 plat an hour <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What do you bake to make 30p an hour?  I started<br/>\n&gt; pottery to make pie tins and pots for my baking<br/>\n&gt; skills.
