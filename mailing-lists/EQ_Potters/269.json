Pottery was completely nerfed in the last<br/>\npatch.  For awhile, I made some of the poison vials (pottery&#39;s new role in<br/>\nthe &quot;player based economy&quot; lie).  I ran across an NPC in Freeport<br/>\nmarket that sells them for less than I can make them for.  Like it mattered.<br/>\nI found the rogues on E.

When they discover they can simply buy the<br/>\nvials for FAR less, they won&#39;t even do this.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
