Pot till you drop because it<br/>\n&gt; will be everywhere on Tuesday.  The second thing is the mystical word<br/>\n&gt; SPECULATION.  You heard it right just like the big time investors do on TV.<br/>\n&gt; When you get ready to log off for the last time before the patch fill your<br/>\n&gt; inventory with those beautiful sketches that cost a little over a silver.<br/>\n&gt; Since you can usually sell items back for about half of the store price and<br/>\n&gt; the store price is now over a plat you should be able to sell each sketch<br/>\n&gt; for about a 5G profit.  Assume that you fill the bank and your personal<br/>\n&gt; inventory with sketches.  8 bank slots 8 personal slots each with a<br/>\n&gt; backpack.  That is 128 available slots to fill with stacks of 20 sketches<br/>\n&gt; for a total of 2560 sketches each with a 5G profit.  Surprise, Surprise that<br/>\n&gt; is over 1000P in one night with no effort on your part : )  Enjoy it.  It<br/>\n&gt; may be the last profit you will see with pottery.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;Message: 4<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Date: Sat, 24 Jul 1999 14:38:07 -0500<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   From: Ascii &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:in@...\">in@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Subject: Re: Well tiime to get POed pottery buffs....<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  What are you talking about?  1225c per sketch?
