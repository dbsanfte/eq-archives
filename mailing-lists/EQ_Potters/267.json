For me\r<br/>\nit was enlightentment.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAs a naive Smith, I learned two separate ore + flask of water.\r<br/>\nMetal Bits.  \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI was stuck with Sharpening Stones and Rusty blades to increase my skill.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nCLAY... Can be combined to get a similar Skill\r<br/>\nboost early.   I&#39;m still failing, but it costs\r<br/>\nless than failed Skewer sketches and components.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nCombine on wheel.\r<br/>\n3 SMALL blocks + Flask of water to get 1 Clay Block.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nCombine 3 Clay Blocks + Flask to get 1 LARGE clay block.  Simple.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe opposite effect can be applied.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nBlock of Clay + Flask yields a SMALL block of clay.  (Doh).\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nEnjoy\r<br/>\nCleric Taven [Veeshan]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
