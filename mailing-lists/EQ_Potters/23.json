For all you budding<br/>\npotters out there here&#39;s what I know....<br/>\n<br/>\nI started in Kelethin where there are all the ingredients I need at various<br/>\nvendors, but of a mission travelling back and forth between platforms, but<br/>\nanyway...<br/>\n<br/>\nI started raising my skill first by making small and medium jars, it rose<br/>\nfairly steadily to the 20&#39;s, then I branched out to ceramic linings and<br/>\nskewers becuase they were a bit harder and worth more in the long run. I<br/>\nhave got my skill up to the forties and am experimenting with medium bowls<br/>\nand trying to work out the recipe for a small deity.<br/>\n<br/>\nSmall bowl recipe may still be broken so try at your own peril :)<br/>\n<br/>\nPie tins are next on my list to try.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those that want a basic run down:<br/>\n<br/>\nTake the required sketch and required amount of clay (not stacked) and with<br/>\na flask of water combine on the pottery wheel, if successful put unfinished<br/>\nitem in the kiln with the required firing sheet and combine..voila!<br/>\n<br/>\nGoodluck with your Pottering ;)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
