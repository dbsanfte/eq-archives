You&#39;re a baker.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom what I&#39;ve found there no market selling pottery items to any of the<br/>\nthree people above, as anyone can become a master potter for an outlay of<br/>\nonly 20pp. Hopefully they&#39;ll expand it a little so that there is a point to<br/>\nsome pottery items besides being used for other trade skills - if you could<br/>\nmake something that people would actually use, rather than something they<br/>\njust use as a component to make something else, then there would be a<br/>\nmarket for it. I&#39;d like to see 10 slot clay jars, so we could finally stop<br/>\nthose tailors gouging the market for 100-150pp a backpack :)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
