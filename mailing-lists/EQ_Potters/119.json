The last<br/>\ntime i<br/>\nwas potting was about 3pm (EST) Tuesday, and the profit margin was still the<br/>\nsame.  However, the word was around the potters in Bertoxx in Kelethin (we<br/>\nall<br/>\nknow each other, lines at the wheel), was that we were going down tonight.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow stupid.  It seems they are forcing you to be a &quot;/auction i am the<br/>\n10000th<br/>\nperson selling jewelry&quot; kind of trader if you want to make a profit.  I find<br/>\npottery nice and relaxing, and a welcome change.  No reason to do it if i&#39;m<br/>\nnot<br/>\ngoing to make at least some money, however.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Nikolita, Floating Merchant<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nAttention ONElist list owners!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/info/news.html\">http://www.onelist.com/info/news.html</a><br/>\nCheck out the new &quot;DEFAULT MODERATED STATUS&quot; option.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
