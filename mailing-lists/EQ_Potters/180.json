Pot till you drop because it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; will be everywhere on Tuesday.  The second thing is the mystical word<br/>\n&gt; &gt; SPECULATION.  You heard it right just like the big time investors do on<br/>\nTV.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; When you get ready to log off for the last time before the patch fill<br/>\nyour<br/>\n&gt; &gt; inventory with those beautiful sketches that cost a little over a<br/>\nsilver.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Since you can usually sell items back for about half of the store price<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the store price is now over a plat you should be able to sell each<br/>\nsketch<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for about a 5G profit.  Assume that you fill the bank and your personal<br/>\n&gt; &gt; inventory with sketches.  8 bank slots 8 personal slots each with a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; backpack.  That is 128 available slots to fill with stacks of 20<br/>\nsketches<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for a total of 2560 sketches each with a 5G profit.
