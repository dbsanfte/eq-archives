The Resist one how ever, at the time I tried, did not work. \nThis was over a month ago so they may have fixed the other one by \nnow.</font></div>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote\n style=\"BORDER-LEFT:#000000 2px solid;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;PADDING-RIGHT:0px;\">\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\">----- Original Message ----- </div>\n  <div\n style=\"BACKGROUND:#e4e4e4;FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>From:</b> \n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:khazade@...\"\n title=\"khazade@...\">khazade@...</a> </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>To:</b> <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Potters@egroups.com\"\n title=\"EQ_Potters@egroups.com\">EQ_Potters@egroups.com</a> </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Sent:</b> Tuesday, September 05, 2000 3:33 \n  PM</div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Subject:</b> [EQ_Potters] Clay Dieties</div>\n  <div><br></div><br>\n  <p><tt>I know that there was some discussion on this back in February, and 2 \n  <br>recipes were posted (small protection and small resistance).
