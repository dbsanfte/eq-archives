She&#39;s only lvl 5<br/>\nand her pottery skill is up to 96.  She can make poison vials, and all<br/>\nkinds of cooking equipment.  She has a full stack of poison vials, and<br/>\nno one to give them to.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d like to auction them - what is a reasonable price to ask?  I&#39;m on<br/>\nthe Prexus server.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpeaking of zombie skins - I make regular runs of the markets and<br/>\ncollect quite a lot of skins.  All 3 inns (all vendors) will have zombie<br/>\nskins at various times, the vendors in the tunnel, the Fishing village<br/>\nof NRo, and the Gypsy camp in Oasis (I only do this in daylight running<br/>\nvery fast).  While &quot;shopping&quot; I also pick up specialty meats (gator,<br/>\nwolf, bear, lion) whenever I see them for hubby&#39;s  baker.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your help.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJeanne Mitchell, Austin, TX<br/>\n&quot;You can tell the quality of a person by how<br/>\nthey treat people they don&#39;t need.&quot; My Dad</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
