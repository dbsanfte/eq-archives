I was reading about them on the eqvault trade board and <br/>\n&gt;it<br/>\n&gt;seems that several people have found weapon sketches for pottery that were<br/>\n&gt;implemented with the new pottery changes.  From what I&#39;ve heard, they were<br/>\n&gt;found on an npc on a remote island in the Ocean of Tears.  Seems there are <br/>\n&gt;a<br/>\n&gt;good variety of different sketchs...all weapons.  Nobody that i know of has<br/>\n&gt;successfully made the items that the sketches fashion yet, because the<br/>\n&gt;materials are unknown as of yet.  It is also not known whether they <br/>\n&gt;actually<br/>\n&gt;make weapons themselves or that they make molds that can then be used for<br/>\n&gt;blacksmithing (which seems more likely of the two).  I&#39;d love to hear any<br/>\n&gt;additional information anyone may have!
