You had to buy your stuff<br/>\nbefore hand.  I had some tins that I stockpiled so that I could pot after<br/>\nthe patch.  But the profit margin is much better on just the tins.<br/>\n<br/>\nI seriously doubt it is a bannable offense.  If they would have not changed<br/>\nthe sell back cost of the sketches (it is able to be set by Verant), I would<br/>\nhave still been a happy camper making my tins.  But as it is I made a nice<br/>\ntotal (wasn&#39;t full of sketches, but had several).  It isn&#39;t an exploit as<br/>\nVerant changed the game.  About 2 months ago they changed what DVinn<br/>\ndropped.  It went from a throw away dagger to one that is highly sought<br/>\nafter and sold for over 100 plat the next day (now down to 30 or so on my<br/>\nserver.)  But if you had the dagger on you during the patch, your net worth<br/>\nincreased dramatically.  It isn&#39;t a bug, and had Verant not changed their<br/>\ngame, the kind of money wouldn&#39;t have been generated.  Considering the<br/>\nlanguage that we have to agree to before entering the game, anybody could be<br/>\nbanned for any kind of behavior that annoys Verant.  As long as we aren&#39;t<br/>\nall going around saying what we did and how much we made, there should be no<br/>\nproblem.  Where problems take place is when people are so giddy that they<br/>\ncan&#39;t keep their mouths shut.  Had Verrant not mentioned it before they<br/>\nnerfed it, it wouldn&#39;t have happened.  That is what happened to Brewing.  It<br/>\nwas profitable, but then it wasn&#39;t after the last patch, but there was never<br/>\nanything mentioned about it before or after.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, I never saw the new sketches in Freeport.  I do not know about anywhere<br/>\nelse.<br/>\n<br/>\ndwh<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: T.J.
