I have<br/>\n&gt;my skill up to almost 100 now and am wondering a couple things:<br/>\n&gt;First of all, what does the Diety sketch do.<br/>\n&gt;Second, I have seen magical clay statues - how are these made? It HAS to be<br/>\n&gt;with pottery, they are clay. Anyone know about updates for new enchanter<br/>\n&gt;spells???<br/>\n&gt;Third, How far will pie tins get me? I know that I am making some pretty<br/>\n&gt;good money at it but what can I do to REALLY make money? I hear of people<br/>\n&gt;making 30+ plat an hour of doing it, but what are you making? Any details<br/>\n&gt;will be appreciated and a list of when things become trivial would help to!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks guys!!!<br/>\n&gt;May pottery live on forever!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s how I make 30 plat an hour in Freeport<br/>\nI now have a skill of 120 something, (where mixing<br/>\nbowls become trivial) but these numbers were done<br/>\n@ a skill of 115 (where pie tins become trivial)<br/>\nwith a Cha of 90 I pay<br/>\n<br/>\n4s2c      Block of Clay<br/>\n4s2c      Block of Clay<br/>\n1s1c      Sketch (pie tin)<br/>\n1s1c      Water<br/>\n--------<br/>\n8s6c      per unfired bowl attempt.<br/>\n<br/>\nwith a success rate of 80.3 % at 115 ( this is over 158 attempts)<br/>\nyou get a cost per unfired bowl of<br/>\n1/.803 * 8.6 = 10s1c per unfired bowl<br/>\n<br/>\n10s1c    per unfired bowl<br/>\n  4s2c    per High Quality Firing Sheet<br/>\n--------<br/>\n14s3c    per fired tin attempt<br/>\n<br/>\nwith a success rate of 96.1%<br/>\n<br/>\n1/.961 * 14.3 = 14s9c cost per pie tin<br/>\n<br/>\nI then sell them for 6g3s (63s)<br/>\n(this was to alec greenglade, but<br/>\n I discovered I get 6g5s at Galio in<br/>\n the in next to the wheel)<br/>\n<br/>\n63s - 15s =48s or 4.8g per pie tin for profit.<br/>\n(Now I have a higher success + higher resale<br/>\n so it&#39;s probably 5.1 or better)<br/>\n<br/>\nI make a single run to Merra Clayfinger to<br/>\nstart off the session, and buy 64 firing sheets.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat minimizes the number of times I have to<br/>\nmake the 2 zone run for firing sheets.<br/>\n<br/>\nfor each of these sessions then I average about<br/>\n30pp profit.<br/>\n(a bit more now)<br/>\n<br/>\nI takes just over an hour to use up the 64 firing<br/>\nsheets, plus however long I have to sit and wait<br/>\nfor someone at the wheel</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
