(maybe even better) Most of us rogues will not take up the skill now because ofthe cost and time that would be involed being masters at 2 trade skills.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are 2 know locations of the poison book but it does not tell about how to make vials.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is what some of our better potters have come up with as far as a good possibility. This formula was tried and they did not get the msg these Items do not combine to create anything. They simply got you do not have enough skill.<br/>\n<br/>\nWARNING ***SPOILER***<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n1 small clay <br/>\n1 water flask <br/>\n1 poison vial sketch <br/>\nand<br/>\n1 polar bear skin! <br/>\nother skins have been tried and the same not enough skill msg has been recieved.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps I would love to see potters yelling POISON VIALS for sale!<br/>\n<br/>\nGood Journeys<br/>\n<br/>\nDenali<br/>\n19 rogue Povar</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
