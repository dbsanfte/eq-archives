I have<br/>\nmy skill up to almost 100 now and am wondering a couple things:<br/>\nFirst of all, what does the Diety sketch do.<br/>\nSecond, I have seen magical clay statues - how are these made? It HAS to be<br/>\nwith pottery, they are clay. Anyone know about updates for new enchanter<br/>\nspells???<br/>\nThird, How far will pie tins get me? I know that I am making some pretty<br/>\ngood money at it but what can I do to REALLY make money? I hear of people<br/>\nmaking 30+ plat an hour of doing it, but what are you making? Any details<br/>\nwill be appreciated and a list of when things become trivial would help to!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks guys!!!<br/>\nMay pottery live on forever!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nONElist:  your connection to online communities.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
