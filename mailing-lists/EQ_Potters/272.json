I busted my hump to be one of the<br/>\n&gt; first to figure out the &#39;ever elusive&#39; vial recipes. Found it, made them<br/>\n&gt; and guess what....there they sit in my bank collecting dust. Many rogues<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t even know the recipes for poison on my server therefore rendering the<br/>\n&gt; vials pointless. The ones who do either hopped on pottery quickly and can<br/>\n&gt; make their own vials (great! ;/) or as you said have bought them cheaply<br/>\n&gt; from other places. (now I know WHERE!!!) I can understand verant wishing to<br/>\n&gt; change pottery so that ppl couldn&#39;t walk away with 1000 plat in a day<br/>\n&gt; ...however their desire to make it a &quot;player based economy&quot; for potters is<br/>\n&gt; absolutely NIL!!! There is not a damn thing I can sell to ANY  player which<br/>\n&gt; they can&#39;t either buy cheaper from a damn merchant somewhere or which they<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t take a bit of money and an hour or two and work on their own pottery<br/>\n&gt; and become self sufficient. So much for this trade skill!!! It has been<br/>\n&gt; totally spun into the ground now. *sighs* Ah well...I enjoyed the skill<br/>\n&gt; while it lasted..time to move on to something else I guess.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; At 04:12 AM 8/14/99 -0500, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Bonecrkr&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bonecrkr@...\">bonecrkr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; What vendor, where??? Another potter may have sold the vials to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the vendor,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; but I do not think that there is a vendor who sells these on a regular<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; basis!!!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I have been making/selling 100&#39;s of poison vials to the small rogue<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; community on my server (to see how small on yours type /who all rogue 20<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; 50), and doubling my investment (on supplies) with every sale.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;This is not the case.  They have all the vials and always have the vials<br/>\n&gt; &gt;every time I check.  They are cheap and easy to find.  The case with the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;rogues simply doesn&#39;t exist on my server.  The results of my attempt to sell<br/>\n&gt; &gt;vials ranged from grim amusement to outright antagonsim.  This could change<br/>\n&gt; &gt;but I highly doubt it once the word gets out about the vendors (at least in<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Freeport marketplace).  I WISH the market for it was on E. Marr but it<br/>\n&gt; &gt;ain&#39;t.  I have also complained bitterly about the vials in Freeport (perhaps<br/>\n&gt; &gt;a market could develop).  The silence has been deafening.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;             Free Games & Cash Prizes!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Gamesville - The World&#39;s Biggest & Best Game Show Site!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;        <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/ad/gamesville0\">http://www.onelist.com/ad/gamesville0</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;              Free Games & Cash Prizes!<br/>\n&gt; Gamesville - The World&#39;s Biggest & Best Game Show Site!<br/>\n&gt;         <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/ad/gamesville0\">http://www.onelist.com/ad/gamesville0</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
