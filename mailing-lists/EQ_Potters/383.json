I&#39;d never seen them <br/>\nauctioned before and my customers have ranged from 5 to 51st level.  <br/>\nI sell them, though, as &quot;TOTEMS&quot; since that&#39;s a word that most of <br/>\nthem recognize.  I sell Protection for 10pp and Resistance for 20pp.  <br/>\nAfter my last sellout, I&#39;m carrying a backpack of each type!<br/>\nI made enough in a short time to repay what I&#39;d spent on pottery, and <br/>\nto buy my 7th level rogue a Stilletto of Bloodclaw (100pp).<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve, of course, had dumb moments where I&#39;d put the unfinished deity <br/>\nand the firing sheet into the potter wheel, or put the unfinished <br/>\ndiety (can&#39;t tell which is which at that point) into the kiln with <br/>\nthe wrong firing sheet.  I may have lost over 30pp this way.<br/>\n<br/>\nLannella, Backstabbing Babe of Druzzil Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
