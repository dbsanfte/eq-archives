Some of the<br/>\n&gt; items you can make (such as the pie tin) can be sold<br/>\n&gt; to the store for a<br/>\n&gt; few gold over the cost of the parts.  While this<br/>\n&gt; isn&#39;t the massive amounts<br/>\n&gt; of platinum I have heard of people making off of<br/>\n&gt; smithing, I have only spent<br/>\n&gt; a few plat raising my skill and it seems to go up<br/>\n&gt; very quickly.  I put only<br/>\n&gt; one training point into pottery and now have a 30 or<br/>\n&gt; so while only spending<br/>\n&gt; a few plat (assuming you can make some items you can<br/>\n&gt; sell back to the<br/>\n&gt; stores).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You may be able to make more off of some of the<br/>\n&gt; higher level pottery<br/>\n&gt; items, but as I said I only have a 30 skill or so. <br/>\n&gt; I would guess if you are<br/>\n&gt; just looking to make money, you can make a little<br/>\n&gt; with pottery, but this<br/>\n&gt; should not be your first choice.  Do it for<br/>\n&gt; role-playing or to support<br/>\n&gt; another trade skill.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Soren<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; kale usi wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: kale usi &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kaleusi@...\">kaleusi@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Not sure what the benefits are for this skill. I<br/>\n&gt; can say, that seems like<br/>\n&gt; &gt; everyone has taken the more popular/profitable<br/>\n&gt; skills - smithing,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bowyer/fletching, jeweler and a few have taken<br/>\n&gt; cooking and/or brewing. I can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tell you this much about the other skills, they<br/>\n&gt; take a ton of cash to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; improve them. If anyone could enlighten us all,<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d be much abliged.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; _______________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Get Free Email and Do More On The Web.
