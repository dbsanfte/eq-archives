All in all I&#39;ve found it&#39;s fun and I&#39;ve only &quot;lost&quot; around<br/>\n4pp (was less than that but my (lack of) success rate with bowls<br/>\ntotally screwed up my profit/loss numbers).  However, when I asked a<br/>\nRogue/Potter friend of mine about the medium bowls (wondering if there<br/>\nwere something a little easier I should be making at this time) all I<br/>\ngot was &quot;Pottery is a pretty useless skill unless you&#39;re a Rogue.  Why<br/>\ndo you want to take up pottery?&quot;  ... Well, cuz I want to, dangit,<br/>\nthat&#39;s why! ...  But since his question this afternoon, two other<br/>\nfolks asked me just about the same thing - &quot;Why?&quot;...  I don&#39;t have<br/>\nvisions of becoming independantly wealthy from the skill though I<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t mind if it brought in a little coin.  Is this &quot;just a hobby&quot;<br/>\nthat&#39;s going to always cost more than it makes me?  Or is it possible<br/>\nto actually profit (or at least break even) in the future?<br/>\n<br/>\nTIA!!<br/>\n<br/>\nLliani<br/>\nKarana Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
