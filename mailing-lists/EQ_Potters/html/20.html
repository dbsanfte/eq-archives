<div id="ygrps-yiv-408260685">Well, folks I have been on this list for a while and well not much has really <br/>
happened and I am wondering why?  I kinda joined this list so I could learn <br/>
how to do it.  Could any one tell me like what to do to gain skill?  What are <br/>
the obvious benefits of learning this trade skill compared to tailoring or <br/>
smithing?  Just anything about pottery knowledge would be great.  Or if any <br/>
one knows anything like a website I could go to or something it would be <br/>
great.<br/>
