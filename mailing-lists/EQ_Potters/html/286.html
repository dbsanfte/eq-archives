<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2043297391">Does anyone have a definitive list of the locations where I can buy supplies?  I located the pottery sketches in North Freeport next to the bank, and clay in North Freeport in Groflath&#39;s Forge shop (by the Bard guild).  I can&#39;t seem to find High Quality Firing Sheets anywhere?  Does anyone know?  Thanks.</div>
