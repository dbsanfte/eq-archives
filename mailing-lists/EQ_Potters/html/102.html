<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2096154782">Okay this is probably going to kill the monopoly I have on the MM server<br/>
but...<br/>
<br/>
I found that the best thing to make when first starting out is the clay jar.<br/>
2 blocks of clay, a flask of water, and a sketch...simple. I&#39;d grab about 20<br/>
sketches and 20 flasks of water, and get 40 blocks of clay and start working<br/>
at the wheel. After I finished I ran to get firing sheets so I could take<br/>
them to the kiln. I didn&#39;t make much money off of this, but my skill flew up<br/>
quick and stopped at 40 something.<br/>
<br/>
Next I switched to Pie Tins. Same deal as before. 2 Blocks, a sketch, and a<br/>
flask of water. The money I make off of this one is amazing though. It costs<br/>
me the following amount to make them:<br/>
<br/>
2 blocks of clay:   9 silver<br/>
1 Sketch          :   1 silver<br/>
1 flask              :   1 silver<br/>
<br/>
That gives me my unfired tin<br/>
<br/>
1 high quality sheet   : 4 silver 5 copper<br/>
<br/>
Total of: around 1.5gp to make<br/>
<br/>
I sell them for 6.15gp<br/>
<br/>
I can do a batch in about 15 minutes, and I usually make about 7-10 plat a<br/>
batch.<br/>
<br/>
The Pie Tin skill has gotten me up to 118 where I stopped tonight.<br/>
<br/>
A few other notes...<br/>
<br/>
A.) In my opinion Halas is by far the best place to take up pottery. It has<br/>
everything, and I mean everything you need, and did I mention that the<br/>
buildings (Save for the merchant by the dock that sells the sketches) are<br/>
right next to each other?<br/>
<br/>
B.) When I first started I tried to use summoned water, and (duh!) you<br/>
can&#39;t. Summoned water is called &#39;Water Globes&#39;, and the book specifically<br/>
asks for Water Flasks...AKA the bought kind. =)<br/>
<br/>
C.) The other thing that confused me is that damn conversion chart. Don&#39;t<br/>
even look at it. Every time I do it confuses me again. Just read what the<br/>
pottery book says a specific item needs.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>

&gt; I am new to the mailing list and new to pottery. I spent many, many hours<br/>
&gt; trying our pottery as well as many plats. I still have yet to learn how to<br/>
&gt; make it profitable. It was somewhat fun at first, but I rapidly grew<br/>
&gt; frustrated. I have a few questions that I hope someone could help me with,<br/>
&gt; as I sense that pottery can be both fun and profitable.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1. Where is a good pottery guide?<br/>
&gt; 2. What is the most profitable item to make.<br/>
&gt; 3. Is the bowl sketch the same as the mixing bowl sketch? I tried it with<br/>
&gt; the mixing bowl recipe<br/>
&gt;     and got the, &quot;Thes items don&#39;t combine to make anything.&quot; message.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>
&gt; Erick<br/>
