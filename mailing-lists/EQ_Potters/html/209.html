<b>Subject:</b> RE: New Sketches <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-642331154">&lt;&lt;The new (vial) sketches are at the merchant(s) that sells the blocks of clay<br/>
and firing sheets. Has anyone else seen any other new sketches out and<br/>
about?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The sketch seller in Halas has all three Vial sketches, as well as Ceramic<br/>
Lining (don&#39;t remember if that was there before, but as a Ranger this interests<br/>
me as people are looking for Ceramic Bows and Staves).<br/>
<br/>
I thought the 3 &quot;Vengeful&quot; Skeletons in Everfrost are a quest to get a new<br/>
Brewer&#39;s recipe: perhaps there is a new way to get the Vial formula?<br/>
