&gt;Gator Meat and have the recipe, but not the jar.<br/>
&gt;Meat+Vinegar+Sauces in Jar.<br/>

&gt;Question is, what size Jar?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>     Okay, the recipe for Pickled Gator (or any pickled product, for that <br/>
matter) in the cookbook is wrong.  It does not work.  What you do is put <br/>
meat, vinegar, and sauce in a spit and hit combine.  No jar is needed.  <br/>
Strange I know, but that&#39;s how the recipe works now ^_^.  Go figure.<br/>
