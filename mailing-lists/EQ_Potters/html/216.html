<div id="ygrps-yiv-1260326169">I would assume the vials will be used to hold poison.  With the new patch,<br/>
Rogues are now able to apply poison to their weapon.  So what&#39;s to stop all<br/>
the Rogues from now taking up the pottery skill and making their own vials?<br/>
This makes little or no sense to me.  I don&#39;t see how this &#39;enhancement&#39;<br/>
will help us potters in any way.   Just my two cents worth.<br/>

&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;The new (vial) sketches are at the merchant(s) that sells the blocks of<br/>
&gt;clay<br/>
&gt;&gt;and firing sheets. Has anyone else seen any other new sketches out and<br/>
&gt;&gt;about?&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;The sketch seller in Halas has all three Vial sketches, as well as Ceramic<br/>
&gt;&gt;Lining (don&#39;t remember if that was there before, but as a Ranger this<br/>
&gt;interests<br/>
&gt;&gt;me as people are looking for Ceramic Bows and Staves).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Does anyone know what these vials are used for?  And how they&#39;re supposed<br/>
&gt;to help potters play a part in player/player eq economy?  &quot;Vials&quot; makes me<br/>
&gt;think of potions, and thus Alchemy.  So... they took away our profit and<br/>
&gt;gave us new sketches that are only useful to one race?  In the name of<br/>
&gt;player-based economy?  Tell me it&#39;s not so, and vials do have some other<br/>
&gt;function....please?<br/>

&gt;than hinder them.<br/>
