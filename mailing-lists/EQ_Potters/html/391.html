<b>Subject:</b> virus warning <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1950068470">A while ago (maybe a month) I received a strange email from one of my<br/>
mailing list. I accidentally ran the attached file, which had a .scr<br/>
extension. It popped up an error box that didn&#39;t look right so caused me<br/>
some concern. I checked the file name with the McAfee site but didn&#39;t find<br/>
anything.<br/>
<br/>
This morning I installed a new virus scanner and found 2 different viruses.<br/>
I am told that both are forms of Back Orafice. The scanning software is<br/>
called Command Antivirus. My system works after removing the infected files,<br/>
but I plan to update my operating system, just in case.<br/>
<br/>
This virus waits until the next time your system is rebooted and then mails<br/>
itself to everyone in your address book. Back Orafice is a nasty trojan that<br/>
effectively allows other people to control your computer remotely. If you<br/>
have received any odd email from me in the last month I heartily recommend<br/>
that you scan your system and apologize if I caused anyone to be infected.<br/>
