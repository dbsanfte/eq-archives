<div id="ygrps-yiv-63773284">A couple questions here. I have made both &quot;Resisting&quot; and &quot;Protection&quot;<br/>
Deities but I find I cannot ready either.  I am a druid and should be able<br/>
to ready at least the &quot;Protection&quot; Deity.  Also what is the use for lined<br/>
vials?  I know rogues use the regular ones for poison and enchanters use<br/>
them for Viscous Mana.<br/>

&gt;meddled with the pie tins and made it a loss making<br/>
&gt;matter.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;But now I can make vials, and sell them cheap, like<br/>
&gt;2pp per poison vial, and 3pp per lined vial. I think I<br/>
&gt;have been staying in Unrest for 6 months straight,<br/>
&gt;which practically gives me the advantage of killing<br/>
&gt;pestering tormented dead like nobody&#39;s business.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;And I&#39;d say I have a new incentive for taking pottery.<br/>
&gt;Making protection deities and laying blessings on<br/>
&gt;friends and lovers (I am a priestess of the Phoenix<br/>
&gt;and conduct wedding ceremonies). So pottery isn&#39;t all<br/>
&gt;that bad. It really depends on whether you have a<br/>
&gt;vivid imagination. ^_^<br/>

&gt; From what I&#39;ve found there no market selling pottery<br/>
&gt; items to any of the<br/>
&gt; three people above, as anyone can become a master<br/>
&gt; potter for an outlay of<br/>
&gt; only 20pp. Hopefully they&#39;ll expand it a little so<br/>
&gt; that there is a point to<br/>
&gt; some pottery items besides being used for other<br/>
&gt; trade skills - if you could<br/>
&gt; make something that people would actually use,<br/>
&gt; rather than something they<br/>
&gt; just use as a component to make something else, then<br/>
&gt; there would be a<br/>
&gt; market for it. I&#39;d like to see 10 slot clay jars, so<br/>
&gt; we could finally stop<br/>
&gt; those tailors gouging the market for 100-150pp a<br/>
&gt; backpack :)<br/>
