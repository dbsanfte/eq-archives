<div id="ygrps-yiv-1666235662">IMO pottery and most other &quot;trade skills&quot; are have simply become an amusment<br/>
for high lvl characters to sink their extra plat into.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;vials ranged from grim amusement to outright antagonsim.  This could change<br/>
&gt;but I highly doubt it once the word gets out about the vendors (at least in<br/>
&gt;Freeport marketplace<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Aye, sadly I have to agree with you. I busted my hump to be one of the<br/>
&gt;first to figure out the &#39;ever elusive&#39; vial recipes. Found it, made them<br/>
&gt;and guess what....there they sit in my bank collecting dust. Many rogues<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t even know the recipes for poison on my server therefore rendering the<br/>
&gt;vials pointless.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;There is not a damn thing I can sell to ANY  player which<br/>
&gt;they can&#39;t either buy cheaper from a damn merchant somewhere or which they<br/>
&gt;can&#39;t take a bit of money and an hour or two and work on their own pottery<br/>
&gt;and become self sufficient. So much for this trade skill!!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;True Pottery is dead, they dont even have to make poison, they can just<br/>
&gt;go to W.Karana and have<br/>
&gt;the NPC rogue make it for them, (Spider poison) or the Dwarf NPC in Dagnors<br/>
&gt;Cauldron (Snake Poison) Verants way of &quot;Enhancing&quot; trade skills. </span></blockquote></div>
