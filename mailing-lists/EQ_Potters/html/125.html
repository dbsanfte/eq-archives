<div id="ygrps-yiv-884384362">nope...pottery makes cookies, completely different from cookie <br/>
cutters...looks sorta like fishcakes or something.<br/>
It&#39;s annoying too, since i am in halas and want some cookie cutters to try <br/>
baking cookies :) guess i need to head to highpass for ore.<br/>

&gt;talking about the same thing?  Are these cookie cutters similar to<br/>
&gt;the cookie cutters that the blacksmiths make?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Has anyone ever tried to use the blacksmith&#39;s cookie cutter or the<br/>
&gt;pottery cookie cutter as a component in .... say the deity<br/>
&gt;construction?<br/>
