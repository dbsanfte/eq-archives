&gt;Hail<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Here is what some of our better potters have come up with as far as a good <br/>
&gt;possibility. This formula was tried and they did not get the msg these <br/>
&gt;Items do not combine to create anything. They simply got you do not have <br/>
&gt;enough skill.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;WARNING ***SPOILER***<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1 small clay<br/>
&gt;1 water flask<br/>
&gt;1 poison vial sketch<br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;1 polar bear skin!<br/>
&gt;other skins have been tried and the same not enough skill msg has been <br/>
&gt;recieved.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hope this helps I would love to see potters yelling POISON VIALS for sale!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Good Journeys<br/>

 </span></blockquote>also verified black wolf skin and puma skin for vials and lined vials<br/>
sealed does not use same recipe, also tried replacing small clay with med <br/>
clay, large clay, and 2 small clay...with no luck<br/>
poison vials are trivial at 148, will post again when i max with lined <br/>
vials...<br/>
<br/>
Will be selling them on Povar at least until i max my skill, mebbe longer if <br/>
they are profitable...<br/>
