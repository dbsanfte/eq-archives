<div id="ygrps-yiv-605987334">While I realize that much of this will be old news to some, I&#39;ve just <br/>
signed up and I&#39;ll add it just in case....<br/>
<br/>
The two dieties (Protection and Resistance) both work and I&#39;ve been <br/>
selling them for the last week on Druzzil Ro.  I&#39;d never seen them <br/>
auctioned before and my customers have ranged from 5 to 51st level.  <br/>
I sell them, though, as &quot;TOTEMS&quot; since that&#39;s a word that most of <br/>
them recognize.  I sell Protection for 10pp and Resistance for 20pp.  <br/>
After my last sellout, I&#39;m carrying a backpack of each type!<br/>
I made enough in a short time to repay what I&#39;d spent on pottery, and <br/>
to buy my 7th level rogue a Stilletto of Bloodclaw (100pp).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve, of course, had dumb moments where I&#39;d put the unfinished deity <br/>
and the firing sheet into the potter wheel, or put the unfinished <br/>
diety (can&#39;t tell which is which at that point) into the kiln with <br/>
the wrong firing sheet.  I may have lost over 30pp this way.<br/>
