<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2009766395">Does anyone know of a really good potter site?  I was wondering or have been <br/>
asked how to make small dieties.  I&#39;m certain I&#39;ve met one person who has made <br/>
them before (but I wasn&#39;t a potter back then).  Does someone have the recipe <br/>
for that?  Also what is the highest skill level achieved at pottery so far? <br/>
 Any suggestions for pricing poison vials?  I&#39;m waivering between 1pp and 2pp <br/>
for regular ones.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks - Tanana, Bristlebane<br/>
