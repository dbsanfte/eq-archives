<b>Subject:</b> Pickled Gator and Lizard  and jars <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-174453657">Ok, I collected 20 or so &quot;gator meats&quot; from DW crocs and camains in S.RO,<br/>
and picked up some lizard meat from various vendors. I finally get back to<br/>
Neriak with visions preparing some pickled gator to let soak for a little<br/>
while..  Put the gator meat and viniger in the oven, and BAM! Items do not<br/>
combine !   Same with lizard.<br/>
<br/>
Tried adding water to the mix, no luck..<br/>
<br/>
the recipe book says to use a jar, but have heard otherwise in the mailing<br/>
list, was wondering if they changed this with the new patch?  I didn&#39;t get a<br/>
chance to actually make a jar to experiment, since Neriak doesn&#39;t have<br/>
sketches, and didn&#39;t feel like walking to east commons..<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas?  I got all this gator meat rotting in the bank, and don&#39;t want to<br/>
make steaks from it, since they are trivial..    Not sure if the pickled<br/>
stuff is or not, but sure sounds tasty.. :)</div>
