<div id="ygrps-yiv-1043268762">Actually, Abashi stated (paraphrased and reposted to the Guide board) that <br/>
they receive about 10,000 /feedback and /bug reports a day.  They do not go <br/>
to Guides.  I don&#39;t know about GM&#39;s but I doubt it.  I was told (as a Guide) <br/>
that they went directly to Verant.  Due to the volume of reports, they were <br/>
simply ignored.</div>
