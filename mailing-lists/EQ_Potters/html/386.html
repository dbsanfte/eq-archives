Lots of us Mud Slingers are hanging out at the Trader&#39;s Corner<br/>

There is a 3rd Wisdom Diety made from the Sands of Ro.<br/>
<br/>
Currently /Bugged since it does fit in Off-Hand, but not the<br/>
Ranged weapons slot as well excludes Shamans.<br/>

Have you stopped by www.thesafehouse.org yet?<br/>
<br/>
Niami has Poison Vendors on her site as well.<br/>
I usually make my own vials, but Toxdilla in West Freeport tunnels.<br/>
Head right out of the West Gate to the hidden wall.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Even if you haven&#39;t hit your 20th season... you COULD be <br/>
making poisions right now.  My Bar Wench on Morrell-Thule is <br/>
still too young to apply her toxins, but has disproved the notion <br/>
that she had to wait until her 20th to use a Mortar & Pestal to <br/>
make spider and snake poisons!<br/>
