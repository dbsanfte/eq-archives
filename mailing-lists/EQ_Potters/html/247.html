<b>Subject:</b> Damn Vials!  Very Long Post <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-680336147">I&#39;ve included a very long post below from the rogue forum re poison and vials.  I had hoped, with the introduction of vials, pottery would become a money maker again.  Last night I made my first vial at a cost of about 570 with a sell back price of 465.  I thought that would be ok, if I could sell them to rogues for 1-2 plat.  <br/>
<br/>
The difficulty with this is two fold.  One, you need a pelt.  There just isn&#39;t a reasonable source for these things in one place - you have to deal with low level plays who are collecting them, which greatly slows down the process.   Two, if the price of the vial is too high, I thought the rogues might take up pottery themselves, putting me out of business.  I thought we were safe from this because it would cost too much to get up to mastery now.  <br/>
<br/>
The attachment below explains how one rogue mastered pottery in a couple hours with an investment of 17pp!  Well, that&#39;s it.  If I have to buy from players, sell to players, and (in competitive analysis terms) the barriers to entry into the trade are low, it&#39;s a bum business.  I can&#39;t understand how with 17 pp you can master a trade when with fletching it costs me that much to go from 104 to 108!  <br/>
<br/>
These trades are screwed up in a major way!  I think I&#39;ll use up the 1000 pie tin sketches I have left and hang up my potter&#39;s apron.  Thanks for listening.<br/>

Well, in case anyone missed it, poisoning has been added to the game.<br/>
<br/>
The trick is, the components are pretty hard to find.<br/>
<br/>
Regardless, here is my experience.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a 25 gnome rogue, with lots of faction (from quests) in halas, currently.<br/>
<br/>
To make poison, you need poison components (they vary) suspension (a base<br/>
gel-like fluid) a vial (either regular or lined) and a mortar and pestle.<br/>
<br/>
Once you get a vial of poison, it apparently has 10 applications if you are<br/>
successfull, and one if you aren&#39;t. (yes, that sucks, i agree).<br/>
<br/>
So, in less than 2 hours, with 100INT and 17plat, I went from 0 in pottery<br/>
up to 104.  Why pottery you ask?  because this is what is needed to make<br/>
vials.<br/>
<br/>
So, I made small jars up to 40, then medium bowls up to 104.  After that I<br/>
switched to regular vials, and they have taken me to 125.  In any case,<br/>
here&#39;s some component pricing for vials and pottery;<br/>
<br/>
2g5s5c - polar bear skin from vendor<br/>
1s3c - flask of water<br/>
3g8s2c - vial sketch<br/>
5s1c - Hight Quality firing sheet<br/>
1s9c - small block of clay<br/>
<br/>
if you were one hundred percent successfull you would consume all those<br/>
resources every time you made a vial.  So that puts the cost to 5g20s20c or<br/>
7g2s.  If someone sells you a vial for more than that, they are making a<br/>
profit.  I was offered vials last night for one plat each.  that&#39;s not a<br/>
bad price, EXCEPT that I can get my own skins from wolves and bears, so the<br/>
cost is reduced to 5g and change, so they&#39;re making good money if all they<br/>
do is pottery and sell poison vials for one plat.  Nevertheless, this will<br/>
likely stimulate the lowbies to make alot of vials.  I now have 40 vials in<br/>
the bank, and some suspension, but no poison-bearing components.<br/>

Vidlos,<br/>
<br/>
As promised I acquired the information you wanted.  I am hated in my own<br/>
land now and you will compensate me for it.  The information is as follows:<br/>
There are many poisons that do not need to be made.  Examples are the Vial<br/>
of Rabid Froth and the CrookStinger Poison.  To make poisons use the mortar<br/>
and pestle.  Before battle apply the poison to a piercing weapon.<br/>
<br/>

Now you will deliver to me the map and the money I wish.  The price we<br/>
decided on was 5pp;  I know want 40pp.  If I do not hear from you within<br/>
two days, I will steal your herd.  If I do not hear from you in three days,<br/>
I will burn your property.  If I do not hear from you in four days, I will<br/>
kill you family.  You will live.  Your life will not.  Pay back your debt<br/>
to me.  You will always owe me,<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Ok, so Huysim is a little deranged, but whatever.  There you have it folks.<br/>
 I don&#39;t imagine this is TOO much of a spoiler, actually, as the book is<br/>
only 2 plat and change, and is easily read by anyone who knows thieves<br/>
cant.  The really wierd thing is that there are only TWO poisons in the<br/>
book that use normal vials.  The rest use lined vials.  This means you must<br/>
be a master potter (like 150+ skill) to effectively become a stand-alone<br/>
poisoner.  Ah well, I will enjoy trying out my new skill today.<br/>
<br/>
It seems that poisoning is centered either in freeport (for the desert) and<br/>
halas (for the snow)  I don&#39;t know anything about the fire..<br/>
