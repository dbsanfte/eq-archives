Hi all.<br/>
<br/>
I have been monitoring for awhile now and have been making pie tins. I have<br/>
my skill up to almost 100 now and am wondering a couple things:<br/>
First of all, what does the Diety sketch do.<br/>
Second, I have seen magical clay statues - how are these made? It HAS to be<br/>
with pottery, they are clay. Anyone know about updates for new enchanter<br/>
spells???<br/>
Third, How far will pie tins get me? I know that I am making some pretty<br/>
good money at it but what can I do to REALLY make money? I hear of people<br/>
making 30+ plat an hour of doing it, but what are you making? Any details<br/>
will be appreciated and a list of when things become trivial would help to!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks guys!!!<br/>
May pottery live on forever!<br/>
<br/>
