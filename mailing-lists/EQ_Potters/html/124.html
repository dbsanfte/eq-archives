<div id="ygrps-yiv-1331205517">When people say these make cookies or cookie cutters are they <br/>
talking about the same thing?  Are these cookie cutters similar to <br/>
the cookie cutters that the blacksmiths make?<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone ever tried to use the blacksmith&#39;s cookie cutter or the <br/>
pottery cookie cutter as a component in .... say the deity <br/>
construction?</div>
