&gt; Ok, I collected 20 or so &quot;gator meats&quot; from DW crocs and camains in S.RO,<br/>
&gt; and picked up some lizard meat from various vendors. I finally get back to<br/>
&gt; Neriak with visions preparing some pickled gator to let soak for a little<br/>
&gt; while..  Put the gator meat and viniger in the oven, and BAM! Items do not<br/>
&gt; combine !   Same with lizard.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Tried adding water to the mix, no luck..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; the recipe book says to use a jar, but have heard otherwise in the mailing<br/>
&gt; list, was wondering if they changed this with the new patch?  I didn&#39;t get<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; chance to actually make a jar to experiment, since Neriak doesn&#39;t have<br/>
&gt; sketches, and didn&#39;t feel like walking to east commons..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Any ideas?  I got all this gator meat rotting in the bank, and don&#39;t want<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; make steaks from it, since they are trivial..    Not sure if the pickled<br/>
&gt; stuff is or not, but sure sounds tasty.. :)<br/>
