&gt; Any of you guys have any information about the new Pottery weapon sketches<br/>
&gt; that were found?  I was reading about them on the eqvault trade board and it<br/>
&gt; seems that several people have found weapon sketches for pottery that were<br/>
&gt; implemented with the new pottery changes.  From what I&#39;ve heard, they were<br/>
&gt; found on an npc on a remote island in the Ocean of Tears.  Seems there are a<br/>
&gt; good variety of different sketchs...all weapons.  Nobody that i know of has<br/>
&gt; successfully made the items that the sketches fashion yet, because the<br/>
&gt; materials are unknown as of yet.  It is also not known whether they actually<br/>
&gt; make weapons themselves or that they make molds that can then be used for<br/>
&gt; blacksmithing (which seems more likely of the two).  I&#39;d love to hear any<br/>
&gt; additional information anyone may have!  This could be a breakthrough for us<br/>
