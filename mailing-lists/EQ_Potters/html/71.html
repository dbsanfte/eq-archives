form.  :D<br/>
<br/>
Dekard asked about a comprehensive list of locations for pottery supplies, <br/>
and while I can&#39;t guarantee it is comprehensive until I have time to explore <br/>
every single zone again to verify everything, I&#39;ve probably got something <br/>
close.<br/>

Wander over to Find Trade Supplies, and then click select pottery.  Please, <br/>
let me know if you have any corrections of additions to this.  Exploration <br/>
(and subsequent web page editing) is a huge time eater, and in my impatience <br/>
to also play the game, I know I&#39;ve missed things.  :D<br/>
