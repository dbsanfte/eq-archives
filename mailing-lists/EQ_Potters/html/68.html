<div id="ygrps-yiv-1782782069">It is possible to make twice or even three times the profits of brewing, <br/>
simply because the pie tins have such a high resale value.<br/>
<br/>
My dwarf with a charisma of 55 (pathetic I know) buys the raw ingredients for <br/>
182 cp and sells the finished product for 593 cp in Kelethin<br/>
<br/>
My wood elf with 105 charisma (made specifically for pottery) buys the raw <br/>
stuff for 125 and sells for 653 cp.<br/>
<br/>
Before I started I scoured the city and found the merchants that sold best to <br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
But for the wood elf that is 528 cp (or 5 gold 2 silver 8 copper) PROFIT on <br/>
each tin!<br/>
<br/>
The only way you could not make 70 pp an hour is if you have you share the <br/>
wheel and klin with more than one person.</div>
