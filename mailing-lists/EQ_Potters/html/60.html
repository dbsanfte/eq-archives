<div id="ygrps-yiv-650926446">How I make 60pp an hour in Halas (as a barbarian shaman with 71 cha):<br/>
<br/>
2 large blocks of clay = 1gp 1sp 7cp * 2 = 2gp 3sp 4cp<br/>
1 large bowl sketch = 1sp 2cp<br/>
1 water flask = 1sp 2cp<br/>
<br/>
total cost for unfished mixing bowl (no pie tins here) = 2gp 5sp 8cp<br/>
<br/>
1 firing sheet ~ 1sp 2cp (I don&#39;t remember this figure, exactly)<br/>
<br/>
total cost for finished mixing bowl = 2gp 7sp<br/>
<br/>
Average selling price to NPC in Halas ~ 8gp 5sp<br/>
<br/>
Net profit per mixing bowl ~ 5gp 8sp<br/>
<br/>
On average (no exageration) I can make 20 attempts at mixing bowls and<br/>
achieve 19 successes in under 10 minutes (with 148 skill).  Let&#39;s say that<br/>
it takes me 10 minutes because I&#39;m working slowly.<br/>
<br/>
19 bowls * 5.8gp = 110.2gp<br/>
<br/>
About 11 pp.  This makes about 66pp per hour.  That&#39;s if I&#39;m not working at<br/>
peak speed... but to be fair, if there&#39;s a line for the wheel or kiln, or if<br/>
I&#39;m talking to a friend at the same time, that figures not going to be that<br/>
high.  Most of the time, though, I do this at non peak hours, which means no<br/>
line _or_ friends... :)<br/>
<br/>
I go mixing bowls all the way.  I&#39;m only level 9, but I almost never have<br/>
less than 30pp on me any more.<br/>
