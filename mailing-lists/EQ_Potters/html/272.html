&gt; Aye, sadly I have to agree with you. I busted my hump to be one of the<br/>
&gt; first to figure out the &#39;ever elusive&#39; vial recipes. Found it, made them<br/>
&gt; and guess what....there they sit in my bank collecting dust. Many rogues<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t even know the recipes for poison on my server therefore rendering the<br/>
&gt; vials pointless. The ones who do either hopped on pottery quickly and can<br/>
&gt; make their own vials (great! ;/) or as you said have bought them cheaply<br/>
&gt; from other places. (now I know WHERE!!!) I can understand verant wishing to<br/>
&gt; change pottery so that ppl couldn&#39;t walk away with 1000 plat in a day<br/>
&gt; ...however their desire to make it a &quot;player based economy&quot; for potters is<br/>
&gt; absolutely NIL!!! There is not a damn thing I can sell to ANY  player which<br/>
&gt; they can&#39;t either buy cheaper from a damn merchant somewhere or which they<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t take a bit of money and an hour or two and work on their own pottery<br/>
&gt; and become self sufficient. So much for this trade skill!!! It has been<br/>
&gt; totally spun into the ground now. *sighs* Ah well...I enjoyed the skill<br/>
&gt; while it lasted..time to move on to something else I guess.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; What vendor, where??? Another potter may have sold the vials to<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; the vendor,<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; but I do not think that there is a vendor who sells these on a regular<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; basis!!!<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; I have been making/selling 100&#39;s of poison vials to the small rogue<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; community on my server (to see how small on yours type /who all rogue 20<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; 50), and doubling my investment (on supplies) with every sale.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;This is not the case.  They have all the vials and always have the vials<br/>
&gt; &gt;every time I check.  They are cheap and easy to find.  The case with the<br/>
&gt; &gt;rogues simply doesn&#39;t exist on my server.  The results of my attempt to sell<br/>
&gt; &gt;vials ranged from grim amusement to outright antagonsim.  This could change<br/>
&gt; &gt;but I highly doubt it once the word gets out about the vendors (at least in<br/>
&gt; &gt;Freeport marketplace).  I WISH the market for it was on E. Marr but it<br/>
&gt; &gt;ain&#39;t.  I have also complained bitterly about the vials in Freeport (perhaps<br/>
&gt; &gt;a market could develop).  The silence has been deafening.<br/>
