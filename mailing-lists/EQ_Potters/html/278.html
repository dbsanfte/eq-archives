<b>Subject:</b> Sealed poison vials <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1097149319">I have been making the two poison vials for a while now building up my<br/>
skill, I have made lined poison vials but they are getting to the point I<br/>
get very little training on them.  I moved to sealed Poison vials, and the<br/>
recipe seems to have changed.  I used:  one water, one sealed poison vial<br/>
sketch, one small block of clay, and a zombie skin, combine, and this did<br/>
not work.<br/>
<br/>
I have used Zombie skins for all the other vials so it should work, do I<br/>
need a cork or something for the &#39;Sealed&#39; part?<br/>
