<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2034063632">I was informed by a rogue who was taking up pottery(only found one<br/>
who would buy vials, the rest decided they would learn to make their<br/>
own&lt;grumble&gt;) that their aren&#39;t any poison recipes using the sealed vial<br/>
yet, so that I shouldn&#39;t bother trying to make one.  Could anyone confirm this?</div>
