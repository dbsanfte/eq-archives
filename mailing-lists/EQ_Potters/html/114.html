<b>Subject:</b> Re: mixing bowls <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-651093795">2 backpacks in the top 2 slots, 18 water and 18 large bowl sketches in the<br/>
slots directly below them. Keep your own food and water in the top two slots of<br/>
the left backpack. Fill up on large clay. Make as many mixing bowls as you can,<br/>
store them all on the left sides with an empty spot to the right of them. Any<br/>
empty spaces (besides ones to the right of unfired mixing bowls) should be at<br/>
the bottom of the right backpack. Go buy sheets until there is a firing sheet<br/>
opposite every unfired bowl. Go fire 4 bowls, sell, 4 more, sell, 1 more, sell<br/>
(if 100% success which isn&#39;t too rare). Buy clay, make unfired bowls, buy<br/>
sheets, make 6 bowls, sell, make 3 more, sell. For me, that gains about 9 plat<br/>
profit and that&#39;s with a low charisma and low faction. You can make a lot more<br/>
as a barbarian shaman with a naturally high charisma (adding cha jewelry and<br/>
your cha buff, you&#39;d be rich QUICK!)<br/>

&gt; i heard  many ppl talking about making mixing bowl for money. But from my<br/>
&gt; experience..it&#39;s a container when u fired it up and for ppl like me who has<br/>
&gt; 6 backpakcs on them , that means i have to run to merchant (although it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; not far) for every 2 successful mixing bowls...how can that be efficient?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; thx<br/>
