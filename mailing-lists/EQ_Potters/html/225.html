<div id="ygrps-yiv-782757554">I got a friend w/ levitate and ran all over the OOT last night, and all I<br/>
succeeded in doing was almost getting hammered by a lev 53 mob on Lizard<br/>
island.  Does anyone seem to have any specifics????<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance.<br/>

&gt;Any of you guys have any information about the new Pottery weapon sketches<br/>
&gt;that were found?  I was reading about them on the eqvault trade board and<br/>
&gt;it<br/>
&gt;seems that several people have found weapon sketches for pottery that were<br/>
&gt;implemented with the new pottery changes.  From what I&#39;ve heard, they were<br/>
&gt;found on an npc on a remote island in the Ocean of Tears.  Seems there are<br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt;good variety of different sketchs...all weapons.  Nobody that i know of has<br/>
&gt;successfully made the items that the sketches fashion yet, because the<br/>
&gt;materials are unknown as of yet.  It is also not known whether they<br/>
&gt;actually<br/>
&gt;make weapons themselves or that they make molds that can then be used for<br/>
&gt;blacksmithing (which seems more likely of the two).  I&#39;d love to hear any<br/>
&gt;additional information anyone may have!  This could be a breakthrough for<br/>
&gt;us<br/>
&gt;potters =)<br/>
