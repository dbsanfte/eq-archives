<div id="ygrps-yiv-367516777">Not sure what the benefits are for this skill. I can say, that seems like <br/>
everyone has taken the more popular/profitable skills - smithing, <br/>
bowyer/fletching, jeweler and a few have taken cooking and/or brewing. I can <br/>
tell you this much about the other skills, they take a ton of cash to <br/>
improve them. If anyone could enlighten us all, I&#39;d be much abliged.<br/>
