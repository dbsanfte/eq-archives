<div id="ygrps-yiv-2139281712">Woo hoo!  Well, I have been one of those that had a moral argument against <br/>
exploiting pottery for a long time.  I actually was one of the first to <br/>
discover that it was profitable (long before there was a guide on EQvault).  <br/>
I exploited it for one day (the day I learned about it) then quit because it <br/>
was too boring.  Last night, I thought that I would try it once more just for <br/>
the heck of it.  I went to HH (the best place to brew and pot, in case you <br/>
did not know) and spent two hours making about 25p an hour.  There were at <br/>
least three other people there doing the same thing hehe.  I also decided to <br/>
stock up on pie tins.  AND I AM GLAD I DID!  Pie tins as you all know sell <br/>
for a few silver.  Well, after this patch, they sold for over 4g!  I made 80p <br/>
in 25 seconds selling back the sketches hehe.  Now if I just would have <br/>
bought more ;-)<br/>

:hopes for another &quot;enhancement&quot; so he can make 200p in 50 seconds next time <br/>
