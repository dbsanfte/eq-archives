<b>Subject:</b> Firing Sheets near Freeport <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1111209893">The merchant that sells firing sheets is located<br/>
at the first &quot;Inn&quot; along the path (the second set<br/>
of buildings).  If you face the front of the inn<br/>
he is in the hut to the left of the inn.  Often<br/>
times he will be on the roof or wandering nearby<br/>
(yet another bug, err.. &quot;feature&quot; from Verant).<br/>
If he is in this state you are basically out of<br/>
luck since since he won&#39;t sell.  You will have to<br/>
wait until a server reset which will put him back<br/>
in his hut or try someplace else like Kaladim or<br/>
Rivervale.  His last name is Clayfinger.</div>
