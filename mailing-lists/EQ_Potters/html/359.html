<b>Subject:</b> RE: [EQ_Potters] Selling vials <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-12845528">I&#39;ve heard all sorts of prices for vials.  Regular 1pp-5pp, and Lined<br/>
2pp-6pp.  It costs around 6gp for Regular & 1pp for Lined to make.  It is<br/>
really up to you what you wanna sell them for.  I&#39;ve maxed out this skill so<br/>
my prices tend to be on the low side.  And I think the high side is kind of<br/>
ridiculous if you want to keep any customers.  I&#39;ve found about 3 rogues<br/>
that I sell to regularly.  When I collect enough zombie skins & think that<br/>
I&#39;ll make a round of vials I give them a tell and see if they are interested<br/>
in buying and find out how many & what kind they want.  To find my customers<br/>
I usually check /w rogue in the zones and ask high level rogues if they are<br/>
interested.  The market for vials is so small you&#39;ll be wasting your breath<br/>
auctioning them over the zones.  Though you may pick up an enchanter or two<br/>
that way.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

<br/>
I am very proud of my little halfling cleric, Feanu.  She&#39;s only lvl 5<br/>
and her pottery skill is up to 96.  She can make poison vials, and all<br/>
kinds of cooking equipment.  She has a full stack of poison vials, and<br/>
no one to give them to.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to auction them - what is a reasonable price to ask?  I&#39;m on<br/>
the Prexus server.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of zombie skins - I make regular runs of the markets and<br/>
collect quite a lot of skins.  All 3 inns (all vendors) will have zombie<br/>
skins at various times, the vendors in the tunnel, the Fishing village<br/>
of NRo, and the Gypsy camp in Oasis (I only do this in daylight running<br/>
very fast).  While &quot;shopping&quot; I also pick up specialty meats (gator,<br/>
wolf, bear, lion) whenever I see them for hubby&#39;s  baker.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help.<br/>
