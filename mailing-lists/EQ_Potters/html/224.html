There seems to be a lot of questions about all this and I have done a lot of research on these topics so I will try to answer as many as I can.( I am a rogue and want to start creating posions ASAP &gt;8) <br/>
 <br/>
Yes poison requires vials that can only be made by potters.<br/>
<br/>
This will make your skill profitable and drive the player driven economy because this skill is now extremly expensive to increase now and it takes a master potter to make vials. (maybe even better) Most of us rogues will not take up the skill now because ofthe cost and time that would be involed being masters at 2 trade skills.<br/>
<br/>
There are 2 know locations of the poison book but it does not tell about how to make vials.<br/>
<br/>
Here is what some of our better potters have come up with as far as a good possibility. This formula was tried and they did not get the msg these Items do not combine to create anything. They simply got you do not have enough skill.<br/>
<br/>
WARNING ***SPOILER***<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1 small clay <br/>
1 water flask <br/>
1 poison vial sketch <br/>
and<br/>
1 polar bear skin! <br/>
other skins have been tried and the same not enough skill msg has been recieved.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps I would love to see potters yelling POISON VIALS for sale!<br/>
<br/>
Good Journeys<br/>
