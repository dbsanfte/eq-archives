<div id="ygrps-yiv-2040776156"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Greetings all.  Tis my first time to post here, but I wanted to hit a couple notes I saw in the digest.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>#1)  Pie sketches sell in North Freeport just outside the bank (when facing out from bank take left and open that door).<br/>
#2)  I only saw the vial sketches, nothing else as new.<br/>
#3)  Making that big profit a bannable offense?  Possibly, but as one stated, they would have to figure out when you purchased the sketches.  Or, if they track what sells to merchants, then just sell a few a day and see how that goes.  BUT, I&#39;m nervous about that, because they<br/>
might decide to decrease the price on the pie tin sketches instead of increasing the price on pie tins.  With Verant, you just never know.<br/>
<br/>
As for something else, I would expect that pottery will get another update.  Why?  Well, because it costs 1pp plus to buy the pie tin sketch, but the merchant sells the pie tin itself for 8gp.  Why spend the time to make pie tins when you can just buy them (unless of course,<br/>
you want to increase pottery skill and lose lots of pp in the process)?  So, I expect the price of pie tins to jump to about 2pp shortly (which my gnome tinkerer is really dreading).<br/>
<br/>
Thank ye,<br/>
  Brian.</div>
