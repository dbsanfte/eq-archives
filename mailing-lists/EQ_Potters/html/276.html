Was it just a good night on Veeshan or did<br/>
someone give the merchants in North Freeport<br/>
Firing sheets to sell?<br/>
<br/>
Found at the INN next to the Pottery Wheel<br/>
and even the Clay merchant at the Armory.<br/>
<br/>
Looking for other Potters to confirm.<br/>

That is one thing I miss from the old Message boards.<br/>
The occasional RED GM post to show US that Verant is listening to us rant. <br/>
I&#39;d prefer to see an official NetRep assigned the task of monitoring these <br/>
message boards specfically as well as encourage the <br/>
Server assigned GMs to watch their named server&#39;s MB here.<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;m equally curious about, were the economic changes for<br/>
sketches the only nerf? Has throwing clay gotten any easier?<br/>
<br/>
NPCs:<br/>
At least for those of us near Freeport EAST Commonlands.<br/>
If Merra Clayfinger isn&#39;t up on his Roof dancing, <br/>
he&#39;s hanging out by the first huts and doesn&#39;t want<br/>
to be bothered. So much for fetching firing sheets.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to see at least ONE merchant in town<br/>
who will also offer firing sheets. <br/>
<br/>
Likewise, Prather is ALWAYS available when I need<br/>
to reload my baking supplies.</div>
