Was wondering, how is it possible that some claim to make as much as 70 P in <br/>
an hour? By following the previous posting, I&#39;d still be making as much per <br/>
hour brewing as I would if I did pottery. I&#39;m not being greedy mind you, I <br/>
just need to earn enough cash to replace the cumbersome bronze armor I&#39;m <br/>
wearing (my encumberances is 60 out of 72 due to the armor and my basic <br/>
equipment).</div>
