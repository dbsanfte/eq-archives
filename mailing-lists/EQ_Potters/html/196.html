&gt; OK, has anybody found out the situation in regards to our beloved craft and<br/>
&gt; the latest patches?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just curious about pricing, selling, etc.  The questions I have are:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; How much has the cost gone up on the sketches?  Give a before and after<br/>
&gt; please<br/>
&gt; How much has the sell back value of sketches been altered?  Once again<br/>
&gt; before and after<br/>
&gt; Has the success rate been modified any?<br/>
&gt; Has the sale prices of finished products been altered?<br/>
&gt; Has there been any versioning of the sketches?  Meaning do the old sketches<br/>
&gt; sell for one price (back to merchants) and the new ones sell for a higher<br/>
&gt; price.<br/>
&gt; Are there any new sketches and additions to the pottery books?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
