<div id="ygrps-yiv-729151252">Okay this is with a 110 charisma enchanter ....<br/>
<br/>
Large bowl sketch 15gp<br/>
Cake rounds - 1pp, 2sp<br/>
Pie Tins - 1pp, 2sp<br/>
Muffin Tins - 1pp, 2sp<br/>
<br/>
I sure hope everyone bought sketches last night. My server is not up yet so I<br/>
cannot say what the SELL price is. As soon as I can I will repost.<br/>
<br/>
Other prices generally lower with the lowest around 1sp. I assume they want<br/>
people to still be able to gain skill ... up until the high level it appears.<br/>
<br/>
2 new sketches:<br/>
Vial<br/>
Sealed Vial?<br/>
<br/>
For poison maybe??? This is from memory as i am not logged on. There may have<br/>
been three vial sketches instead of 2. I did not check my pottery book for new<br/>
recipes.<br/>

&gt; OK, has anybody found out the situation in regards to our beloved craft and<br/>
&gt; the latest patches?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just curious about pricing, selling, etc.  The questions I have are:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; How much has the cost gone up on the sketches?  Give a before and after<br/>
&gt; please<br/>
&gt; How much has the sell back value of sketches been altered?  Once again<br/>
&gt; before and after<br/>
&gt; Has the success rate been modified any?<br/>
&gt; Has the sale prices of finished products been altered?<br/>
&gt; Has there been any versioning of the sketches?  Meaning do the old sketches<br/>
&gt; sell for one price (back to merchants) and the new ones sell for a higher<br/>
&gt; price.<br/>
&gt; Are there any new sketches and additions to the pottery books?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
