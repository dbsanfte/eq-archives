<div id="ygrps-yiv-1411249034">I am new to the mailing list and new to pottery. I spent many, many hours<br/>
trying our pottery as well as many plats. I still have yet to learn how to<br/>
make it profitable. It was somewhat fun at first, but I rapidly grew<br/>
frustrated. I have a few questions that I hope someone could help me with,<br/>
as I sense that pottery can be both fun and profitable.<br/>
<br/>
1. Where is a good pottery guide?<br/>
2. What is the most profitable item to make.<br/>
3. Is the bowl sketch the same as the mixing bowl sketch? I tried it with<br/>
the mixing bowl recipe<br/>
    and got the, &quot;Thes items don&#39;t combine to make anything.&quot; message.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
