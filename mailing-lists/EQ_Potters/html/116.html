&gt;Heard Brewing was nerfed, is pottery still profitable as of this morning?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Haven&#39;t tried today.  Probably.  I read a message from<br/>
someone on the bard&#39;s list that was level 12 and had<br/>
a full suit of bronze armor, and 250pp in bank.  That&#39;s<br/>
just nuts.  Of course, if they want to sit there doing<br/>
nothing but pottery for the time it takes to accomplish<br/>
that, then that&#39;s their business.  I only made a char<br/>
to take it up because I lost everything to a bug.  It was<br/>
the fastest way to recover enough money to re-equip.</div>
