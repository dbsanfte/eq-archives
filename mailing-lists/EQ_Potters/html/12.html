<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-53228757">Thanks for the info, but I still couldn&#39;t find the firing sheets.<br/>
<br/>
I went to East Commonlands and followed the path.  He is not in<br/>
the first 3 single buildings (no Inn, just buildings) so I continued<br/>
on.  There is then an Inn on the left side of path where there is<br/>
usually a single guard.  He was not in the two single buildings<br/>
next to the inn, so I tried the Inn itself.  Two merchants were there,<br/>
not with that name or firing sheets, and one was on top of the<br/>
building.  The one on top of the building did not have that name<br/>
though (some generic name like Innkeep Frank).<br/>
<br/>
Am I missing something or is this not the right Inn?  ALL I WANT<br/>
ARE SOME FIRING SHEETS...seems like it should be simple.<br/>
Why would Verant make it so hard to do trade skills?  It&#39;s not like<br/>
you can make much money from them.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for the help.<br/>

&gt; Well Met Soren<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;  Where can I get firing sheets around Freeport?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; East Commonlands at the first INN.  Look for Martin Clayfinger.<br/>
&gt; At night, he seems like to fix his roof - alot.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I also managed to find a new supply of clay at the Dwarven<br/>
&gt; Armory in North Freeport, but they don&#39;t have firing sheets.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;  I have been doing baking and wanted to<br/>
&gt; &gt;  start pottery to help out the baking.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I find they kinda go hand & hand... there is an EQ_Bakers list too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I finally after many trys (low skill), got a set of skewers made.<br/>
