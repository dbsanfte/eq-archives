<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I need to fire ceramic linings to make any Pie, Muffin & Bread Tins.  <br/>
&gt;Any guesses?  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I tried the obvious: <br/>
&gt;Flask of Water, Block of Clay, Ceramic Lining Sketch.<br/>
&gt;[These components don&#39;t combine].<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>heh...they are QUITE confusing ...all these different pottery<br/>
components...what you need is a SMALL block of clay...a &quot;block of clay&quot; is<br/>
a medium block though they never tell you that...I failed at many things<br/>
doing trial and error ..not to mention I have STILL yet to figure out WHICH<br/>
sketch will give me a blasted mixing bowl and all I see are bowl<br/>
sketch,large bowl sketch etc ..ahh well ;) ..hope I at least helped with<br/>
the ceramic linings ;) ....btw... is baking even worth it? is it any kind<br/>
of money maker...or do you simply use it to supply yourself with food<br/>
instead of having to buy it?? sorry for rambling..I&quot;m off now ;)	<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;Also could someone please explain metal bits vs block of ore.<br/>
&gt;As I&#39;ve read, two ore can be used to substitute for metal bits, <br/>
&gt;but I have yet to be successful.   Stacked or unstacked.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>DO NOT listen to such and such &quot;+&quot; such &quot;=&quot; blah blah...SUPPOSEDLY two<br/>
small bricks of ore equals one large brick or whatevert the book<br/>
said...well that may be ..however they will NOT work if you try to use two<br/>
smalls instead of one large to make whatever item requires a large<br/>
brick....i tried many of those different equivelants just to see and got<br/>
&quot;these items do not combine in this quanity to make anything&quot; EVERY<br/>
time...stick to the exact recipes I found and you&#39;ll be okay.<br/>
