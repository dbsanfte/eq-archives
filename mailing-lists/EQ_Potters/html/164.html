&gt;<br/>
&gt;I witnessed the demise of pottery in the EQ General Chat channel.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I dropped in there on Thursday night, and Aradune (Brad) was there.  <br/>
&gt;Someone<br/>
&gt;asked<br/>
&gt;something like &quot;What can you do in the game to make money?&quot;  and some idiot<br/>
&gt;replied<br/>
&gt;to him &quot;I make 80p per day with pottery&quot;.  A few moments later Aradune said<br/>
&gt;&quot;80p per day???&quot;.<br/>
&gt;After that nothing more about pottery was said.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And now we have the patch, cuz some idiot couldn&#39;t keep his trap shut.  The<br/>
&gt;link between<br/>
&gt;this incident and the patch is quite clear.<br/>
