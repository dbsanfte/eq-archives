<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-404394254">Lliani,<br/>
I play a little hafling cleric who is only lvl 5, but has her pottery<br/>
skill up to 101.  As you can see, I&#39;ve been spending more time potting<br/>
than fighting :-D<br/>
<br/>
I like it - it&#39;s fun.  I don&#39;t have any other reason for doing it than<br/>
that.  It will never make me money.  Never.  But, I made a dozen poison<br/>
vials that I keep on me, and when I play, I auction the vials at 1pp<br/>
each.  I only sold one, but I did sell one.  The 1pp is twice what it<br/>
cost me to make it, not counting losses from lack of skill.<br/>
<br/>
My skill increases happened fairly rapidly.  I didn&#39;t waste money firing<br/>
the medium bowls because you can&#39;t make enough in selling it  to pay for<br/>
the firing sheet.<br/>
<br/>
Rogues aren&#39;t the only ones that need potters.  Enchanters need a vial<br/>
to make viscous mana for tailors to make Wu&#39;s Fighting Gauntlets.  I<br/>
have an ogre friend who is a baker.  I made her a smoker, cookie<br/>
cutters, skewers and a pie tin.  She has lost these things when she<br/>
combined the wrong ingredients, so now I have some extras for her that I<br/>
keep in the bank.  I made ceramic liners for a blacksmith who wanted to<br/>
make some baking things.  I don&#39;t charge for these things - making them<br/>
brought up my skill and it was fun.<br/>
<br/>
I did discover that it&#39;s easier for a potter to make baking items than<br/>
for a blacksmith.  And my skill has increased faster than hers, too.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to try to make some idols, but I don&#39;t know what they are good<br/>
for.<br/>
Have fun.  Have lots of fun. :-D<br/>
