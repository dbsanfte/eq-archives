<div id="ygrps-yiv-1183478345">as far as i can tell, the 2 bowl sketches are the same, since they stack <br/>
with each other...<br/>
also pretty sure i made both large bowls and mixing bowls from the same <br/>
sketch last time i tried, just depends on the other components...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;hehe okay ...check THIS out then...at the merchant in Kelethin who sells<br/>
&gt;the sketches...he sells TWO &#39;large bowl&#39; sketches....exact same<br/>
&gt;name...exact same price...one at top of inv and one NEAR bottom (its NOT a<br/>
&gt;sell back he ALWAYS has them) And I remember at least ONCE trying the large<br/>
&gt;bowl sketch and said quanities don&#39;t combine or whatever...so hmm maybe I<br/>
&gt;got the wrong &quot;large bowl sketch&quot; (hope this is a big mistake to have both<br/>
&gt;named the same though lol otherwise shame on Verant for being so mean hehe)<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ll buy one of each and see what each says and try that. Thanks for giving<br/>
&gt;me the correct sketch name at least heh now I just gotta find the right<br/>
&gt;one!! ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;well, to alleviate your troubles :) use the large bowl sketch to make <br/>
&gt;mixing<br/>
&gt; &gt;bowls:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;so the recipe goes like this - large bowl sketch, water, two large blocks <br/>
&gt;of<br/>
&gt; &gt;clay, combine :&#92;)<br/>
