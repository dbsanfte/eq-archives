<div id="ygrps-yiv-2051498656">I&#39;m a master of brewing, blacksmithing, cooking, potting, and am currently<br/>
working on tailoring :) Can never have enough skills IMHO. The most profitable<br/>
seems to be a close race between cooking and potting. Cooking returns 2.5 times<br/>
what you put in if you&#39;re making fish fillets at 100% success (not too tough,<br/>
they are trivial at 82). So, sinking 20 plat into fish fillets makes you quite<br/>
the little bundle of plat :) Problem being it takes a LONG time to combine that<br/>
many items. We&#39;re talking 4 silver per try, selling for 1 gold each success :)<br/>
Now, potting returns 4 times as much when you make mixing bowls. Spend approx. 2<br/>
gold to make one, returns over 8 gold. Problem is there is a LOT more running<br/>
around than in cooking, the best potting places are always crowded (2 or 3<br/>
people waiting to use the wheel), and anywhere else requires so much zoning it&#39;s<br/>
entirely impractical. So, even though you get a better return rate and it&#39;s<br/>
technically faster, you wind up taking about as long as cooking depending on the<br/>
wait times. Given no wait times, you would surely be making more than in<br/>
cooking.<br/>
<br/>
Fish fillets triv out at 82<br/>
Mixing bowls (I hear) triv out at 128.<br/>
<br/>
My cooking is 82 (haven&#39;t started on fish rolls... been potting =P) and my<br/>
potting is 148 (from large bowls). Hope this helps you decide :)<br/>

&gt; &gt;I&#39;m out here :) Guess us potters aren&#39;t too popular, but we&#39;re the ones<br/>
&gt; &gt;that<br/>
&gt; &gt;get the money =P You should see the EQBrewers list... they&#39;re excited about<br/>
&gt; &gt;new items (understandable) and are hoping to make more than 30 plat an hour<br/>
&gt; &gt;with it. I can make at least twice that with my lovely potting skill :)<br/>
&gt; &gt;Gotta love it<br/>

&gt; Was wondering what level your skill is in ordered to make decent money like<br/>
&gt; that? I&#39;m a master brewer by the way, and am looking to expand into other<br/>
&gt; skills.<br/>
