&gt;  I&#39;m trying desperately to find a pot sketch.  Any suggestions?<br/>

Try the Trader&#39;s Holiday in East Freeport.  The merchant<br/>
also sells the spits (scroll down), but has cooking item <br/>
molds including cookie cutters, pot & smoker.<br/>
<br/>
I am not a smith, nor very successful throwing clay.  <br/>
Happy that I have my clay skewers rather than metal.  <br/>
I think it helps the Rat flavor a tad.<br/>
<br/>
Now that dough is working, yeah!  <br/>
I need to fire ceramic linings to make any Pie, Muffin & Bread Tins.  <br/>
Any guesses?  <br/>
<br/>
I tried the obvious: <br/>
Flask of Water, Block of Clay, Ceramic Lining Sketch.<br/>
[These components don&#39;t combine].<br/>
<br/>
Also could someone please explain metal bits vs block of ore.<br/>
As I&#39;ve read, two ore can be used to substitute for metal bits, <br/>
but I have yet to be successful.   Stacked or unstacked.<br/>
