&gt; still never heard anything definite on deities...was<br/>
&gt; rumors a while back <br/>

&gt; no luck with anything  <br/>
&gt; tried...<br/>
&gt; as far as i know, skill maxes at 168 with lined<br/>
&gt; poison vials.<br/>
&gt; was selling around 1 - 1.5 for normal vials before,<br/>
&gt; but prices may rise a <br/>
&gt; bit since enchanters will need them too once the new<br/>
&gt; spells work...sold 40 <br/>
&gt; for 2pp each yesterday to one...<br/>
&gt; think i was asking 2-3 for lined, but not much luck<br/>
&gt; selling them...still got<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 80 left from maxing my skill...<br/>

There are so few people playing rogues in this game<br/>
that I normally just do a /w all rogue, and you have a<br/>
good list to choose from. But this is maybe what you<br/>
do already... I donï¿½t think most rogues who is in need<br/>
for lined vials would hesitate to buy for 3p.<br/>
