<div id="ygrps-yiv-726115194">Howdy all...<br/>
<br/>
I spent the Thanksgiving weeking throwing clay up in High Pass.<br/>
Got my skill up to making at least pots, cookie molds and <br/>
even Kiln firing is trivial.<br/>
<br/>
I am curious about Jars and Pickling (Baking).<br/>
<br/>
I was able to fire a Medium size jar (4 pockets), <br/>
turned around and sold it to make room for another<br/>
clay run.<br/>
<br/>
Now that I&#39;m back in Freeport, I came across some <br/>
Gator Meat and have the recipe, but not the jar.<br/>
Meat+Vinegar+Sauces in Jar.<br/>
<br/>
Question is, what size Jar?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t believe I can put my &quot;Jar&quot; into a &quot;Spit&quot; <br/>
since both count as containers.  nFreeport isn&#39;t <br/>
a bad spot to fire off some jars and them have <br/>
them melt in the Oven, getting more gator meat<br/>
sounds like a trip to Oasis.<br/>
<br/>
Does a LARGE JAR like a Mixing Bowl yield a COMBINE?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks <br/>
