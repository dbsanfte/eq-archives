<div id="ygrps-yiv-1123634091">I managed to make the &quot;small protection deity&quot; but was unable to equip it<br/>
anywhere.  It says it is usable by Druids, Clerics, and Shamen and I am a<br/>
druid.  It does not go into the shield slot as I expected.  Is this still<br/>
&quot;broken&quot; in that it cannot be equipped?<br/>
<br/>
My other question is where can I buy Wolf&#39;s Eye Agates outside Neraik?<br/>
