<div id="ygrps-yiv-2063855071">Greetings all, thought I&#39;d put in my two coppers worth. For all you budding<br/>
potters out there here&#39;s what I know....<br/>
<br/>
I started in Kelethin where there are all the ingredients I need at various<br/>
vendors, but of a mission travelling back and forth between platforms, but<br/>
anyway...<br/>
<br/>
I started raising my skill first by making small and medium jars, it rose<br/>
fairly steadily to the 20&#39;s, then I branched out to ceramic linings and<br/>
skewers becuase they were a bit harder and worth more in the long run. I<br/>
have got my skill up to the forties and am experimenting with medium bowls<br/>
and trying to work out the recipe for a small deity.<br/>
<br/>
Small bowl recipe may still be broken so try at your own peril :)<br/>
<br/>
Pie tins are next on my list to try.<br/>
<br/>
For those that want a basic run down:<br/>
<br/>
Take the required sketch and required amount of clay (not stacked) and with<br/>
a flask of water combine on the pottery wheel, if successful put unfinished<br/>
item in the kiln with the required firing sheet and combine..voila!<br/>
<br/>
Goodluck with your Pottering ;)</div>
