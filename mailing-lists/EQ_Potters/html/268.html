<b>Subject:</b> Why bother with pottery? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1643943859"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I came across a great Pottery reference page. The content of it<br/>
&gt; wasn&#39;t anything that most of you haven&#39;t already learned.  For me<br/>
&gt; it was enlightentment.  As a naive Smith, I learned two separate<br/>
&gt; ore + flask of water. Metal Bits.    I was stuck with Sharpening<br/>
&gt; Stones and Rusty blades to increase my skill.  CLAY... Can be<br/>
&gt; combined to get a similar Skill boost early.   I&#39;m still failing,<br/>
&gt; but it costs less than failed Skewer sketches and components.<br/>
&gt; Combine on wheel. 3 SMALL blocks + Flask of water to get 1 Clay<br/>
&gt; Block.  Combine 3 Clay Blocks + Flask to get 1 LARGE clay block.<br/>
&gt; Simple.  The opposite effect can be applied.  Block of Clay +<br/>
&gt; Flask yields a SMALL block of clay.  (Doh).  Enjoy Cleric Taven [Veeshan]<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Why are you bothering to do this?  Pottery was completely nerfed in the last<br/>
patch.  For awhile, I made some of the poison vials (pottery&#39;s new role in<br/>
the &quot;player based economy&quot; lie).  Then I ran across an NPC in Freeport<br/>
market that sells them for less than I can make them for.  Like it mattered.<br/>
I found the rogues on E. Marr at least, to be completely uninterested in<br/>
buying vials from me (even when I dropped the price to cost).  Instead, they<br/>
would simply develop pottery.  When they discover they can simply buy the<br/>
vials for FAR less, they won&#39;t even do this.</div>
