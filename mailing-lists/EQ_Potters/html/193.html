<div id="ygrps-yiv-1034250254">&lt;&lt;Yes you are right about speculation, and who is to say that the cost of<br/>
the sketches are going to go up? what if the pie tin price goes down<br/>
instead?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, this is at least partially known thats why: on the test server, which is<br/>
usually the &#39;harbinger&#39; of things to come, pie tins sketches DID go up, to 1 pp<br/>
each.<br/>
<br/>
Since updates are usually Tues morn, i suspect we&#39;ll find out shortly.  I bought<br/>
200 sketches before i logged last night: i figured it was worth a 2 pp<br/>
investment to see what happens.<br/>
