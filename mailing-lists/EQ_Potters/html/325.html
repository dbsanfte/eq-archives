<div id="ygrps-yiv-1759816639">Well, I just got out of game from having tried to make those deities <br/>
... and yes indeed, the recipes do work ^_^.  Woohoo!  ^_^<br/>
<br/>
     However, I have one question ... has anyone actually gotten the  <br/>
deities themselves to work?  See, after handing them out for over an hour to <br/>
any newbie shaman, druid, or cleric I could find between Qeynos and East <br/>
Karana, I was informed by a shaman that he couldn&#39;t get it to work.  Not in <br/>
a weapons slot, not in a general slot, no where.  So has anyone found where <br/>
you are supposed to put these things?  In a jewelry slot perhaps?  I don&#39;t <br/>
know ... that&#39;s what I get for being a ranger and not being able to test my <br/>
own wares ^_^;;.<br/>
<br/>
    But anyway, if anyone can figure out where these puppies are supposed to <br/>
go ... or if the item is just broken ... then please, do tell ^_^.<br/>
