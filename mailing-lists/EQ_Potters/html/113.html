<b>Subject:</b> mixing bowls <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1705409656">i heard  many ppl talking about making mixing bowl for money. But from my<br/>
experience..it&#39;s a container when u fired it up and for ppl like me who has<br/>
6 backpakcs on them , that means i have to run to merchant (although it&#39;s<br/>
not far) for every 2 successful mixing bowls...how can that be efficient?<br/>
<br/>
thx</div>
