<b>Subject:</b> RE: Why bother with pottery? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-838907754"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; What vendor, where??? Another potter may have sold the vials to<br/>
&gt; the vendor,<br/>
&gt; but I do not think that there is a vendor who sells these on a regular<br/>
&gt; basis!!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have been making/selling 100&#39;s of poison vials to the small rogue<br/>
&gt; community on my server (to see how small on yours type /who all rogue 20<br/>
&gt; 50), and doubling my investment (on supplies) with every sale.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is not the case.  They have all the vials and always have the vials<br/>
every time I check.  They are cheap and easy to find.  The case with the<br/>
rogues simply doesn&#39;t exist on my server.  The results of my attempt to sell<br/>
vials ranged from grim amusement to outright antagonsim.  This could change<br/>
but I highly doubt it once the word gets out about the vendors (at least in<br/>
Freeport marketplace).  I WISH the market for it was on E. Marr but it<br/>
ain&#39;t.  I have also complained bitterly about the vials in Freeport (perhaps<br/>
a market could develop).  The silence has been deafening.</div>
