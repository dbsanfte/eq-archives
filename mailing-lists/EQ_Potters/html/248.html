&gt;Someone might have already sent this in, but the eqvault board that<br/>
&gt;had the messages about the weapon/weapon-mold sketches, now has <br/>
&gt; &gt;messagesindicating it was a hoax, including an apparent confession to <br/>
&gt; &gt;the hoax.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t know what to believe at this point. Personally, they could very well <br/>
exist. After all, if they did and everyone suddenly took an interest in <br/>
finding them, I&#39;d admit it was a hoax to, to eliminate any competition. <br/>
Personally, I&#39;ll have a look for myself to verify the case either way.</div>
