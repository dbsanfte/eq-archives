<div id="ygrps-yiv-1061087400">Hello<br/>
<br/>
the merchant who sells the sketches in Kelethin is located by the orc lift <br/>
(ask any elf for the direction). The orc lift is the lift nearest to the orc <br/>
camps and CB. There are 2 merchants (outside-type merchants) up the lift. <br/>
One of them has the sketches.<br/>

I have heard that to buy sketches I have to go to Kelethin, but I have been <br/>
unsuccessful in finding the appropriate vendor there.  Can somebody be so <br/>
kind as to pinpoint who or what I am looking for?  Maybe a loc or <br/>
directions.  I have made a 2nd character to pursue some of the things my <br/>
poor little misunderstood Gnome Necro can not do in the world of Norath.<br/>
