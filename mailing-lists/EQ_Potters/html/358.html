<b>Subject:</b> Selling vials <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1291903811">I am very proud of my little halfling cleric, Feanu.  She&#39;s only lvl 5<br/>
and her pottery skill is up to 96.  She can make poison vials, and all<br/>
kinds of cooking equipment.  She has a full stack of poison vials, and<br/>
no one to give them to.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to auction them - what is a reasonable price to ask?  I&#39;m on<br/>
the Prexus server.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of zombie skins - I make regular runs of the markets and<br/>
collect quite a lot of skins.  All 3 inns (all vendors) will have zombie<br/>
skins at various times, the vendors in the tunnel, the Fishing village<br/>
of NRo, and the Gypsy camp in Oasis (I only do this in daylight running<br/>
very fast).  While &quot;shopping&quot; I also pick up specialty meats (gator,<br/>
wolf, bear, lion) whenever I see them for hubby&#39;s  baker.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help.<br/>
<br/>
