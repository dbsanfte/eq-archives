<div id="ygrps-yiv-1419342649">I, for one, can not believe that they didn&#39;t create another object (i.e. new<br/>
sketch, old sketch), and just trash the old one... I mean, if they had<br/>
anyone in their employ reading any of the forums on the popular sites they<br/>
would have know this was going to happen.<br/>
<br/>
I know of people who were not even potters who bought 10-16 backpacks full<br/>
of sketches....  Talk about too much cash in the economy...<br/>

&lt;&lt; one question.  is this a bannable exploit?  will Verant take away all the<br/>
 plat we made in selling these sketches?  i know that they monitor all<br/>
 purchases, which is how they know if potions are being bought or not. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t understand how this can be a bannable exploit...I call it...an<br/>
investment.  It was a risk...it wasn&#39;t a 100% guarantee that it would work.<br/>
Would you feel guilty to find out that tomorrow each sheet of toilet paper<br/>
in<br/>
your house was worth 100 dollars?  Would you sell it or use it? heh...</div>
