<div id="ygrps-yiv-37183699">I haven&#39;t seen a wish list in a while so here are mine.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;disclaimer: I am not a potter. I was considering it once and this list has<br/>
so little traffic I never unsubscribed&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Some sort of clay pot as a requirement for some alchemy.<br/>
<br/>
Molotov cocktail: requires clay pot, fire water, vodka. One charge of<br/>
area-of-effect fire.<br/>
<br/>
Portable still. Lets you brew on the road. Kind of like the spit for baking.<br/>
Any time you use the still there is a 1% chance it breaks.<br/>
<br/>
clay bulb arrow tip. Filled with magical powder lets fletchers make a few<br/>
new kinds of arrows. Blindness, snare, and some small debuff would work<br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
clay golem. 1st level pet. I think Verant has reasons for not wanting pets<br/>
useable by everyone (hence they removed clockwork pets) but I still think<br/>
its a worthy idea.<br/>
<br/>
soul protector. Very expensive. Maybe needs to be enchanted by a high level<br/>
enchanter or necromancer. One charge of &quot;soul protection&quot; which lasts for<br/>
maybe an hour real time. When you die while under the effect of Soul<br/>
Protection you don&#39;t lose any experience. I know this really isn&#39;t feasible<br/>
but I can dream.<br/>
<br/>
caltrops. essentially an area-of-effect snare.<br/>
<br/>
clay mask. When worn makes your faction indifferent with some groups (maybe<br/>
all merchants, or human merchants, or MerchantsOfQeynos).<br/>
<br/>
ceremonial armor. No AC bonus but looks cool. Available in different<br/>
colors - bronze, steel. Might be limited to non-planes armor that already<br/>
exists. Would be perfect for those special events when you want to look<br/>
good, and not your silly piecemeal self.<br/>
<br/>
blank tablets of scripture. Can only be used by a cleric. When used, the<br/>
cleric loses 1% of his experience and gets an item called &quot;tablets of<br/>
scripture&quot;. It can only be used by someone of lower level of the same faith.<br/>
Using it boosts that persons experience by 1%. So if a 32nd level cleric of<br/>
Tunare used it he would get a &quot;tablets of Tunare XXXI&quot;. Clerics would make a<br/>
fortune from twinkers, especially once they hit 60th level and didn&#39;t have<br/>
anything better to do with their xp.<br/>
<br/>
OK, back to work.<br/>
<br/>
Rudo the cleric (what a surprise!)</div>
