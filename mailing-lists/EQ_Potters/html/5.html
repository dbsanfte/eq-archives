<div id="ygrps-yiv-863504440">Hello<br/>
I have a couple pottery questions. I am a new<br/>
potter, skill around 20 or so and I have been<br/>
 trying to make skewers to compliment my baking.<br/>
<br/>
I am having trouble firing them in a kiln. I keep getting &quot;these items dont combine in the quantities given&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I put one unfired skewers and one quality firing sheet in the kiln as per the directions.<br/>
<br/>
Any help would be appreciated.<br/>
