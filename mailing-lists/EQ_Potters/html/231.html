<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-182531331">They are not on the sisters island. I am looking for the island w/ the<br/>
merchant that sells the sketches. I did find one other island near sisters<br/>
island (Gornet&#39;s maybe?? the one w/ the Cyclops) with a merchant, but she is<br/>
the one selling the summoning spells.<br/>
<br/>
I also stopped at the island on the way back from Kaladim (my map shows it<br/>
as boring island or something like that. I don&#39;t have the name here at<br/>
work), but there weren&#39;t any sketches being sold on that island either.<br/>
<br/>
As for Allizwesaur, yes, that&#39;s who I saw, but I have no interest in him,<br/>
other than not being killed by him ;)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

&gt;About the sketches or the Lizard?  I can tell you that that was the<br/>
&gt; &gt;Allizwesaur, a dinosaur who is the sole resident of that island.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt;don&#39;t know if he&#39;s ever been killed, but he can double attack for &gt;about<br/>
&gt;200 pts each.  Ouch.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am guessing that either Zach Reigh&#39;s isle or the Sisters are the &gt;sellers<br/>
&gt;of the sketches.  I haven&#39;t found out yet, as i&#39;m in &gt;Everfrost and more<br/>
&gt;interested in the Poison Vials right now anyway.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t think it&#39;s on the Isle of Sisterhood. Been all over that island, and<br/>
haven&#39;t found them yet. Never been to Zach Reigh&#39;s island though. Anyone<br/>
have the locs of this island?</div>
