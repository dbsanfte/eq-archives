<div id="ygrps-yiv-1452728690">Getting a bit discouraged here....<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve only recently taken up pottery, I reached level 48 just today.<br/>
Information online is sketchy and inconsistent but I&#39;ve been doing<br/>
pretty good at piecing things together by going through this list&#39;s<br/>
archives, using the Guide in the game or, when all else fails, trial<br/>
and error.  All in all I&#39;ve found it&#39;s fun and I&#39;ve only &quot;lost&quot; around<br/>
4pp (was less than that but my (lack of) success rate with bowls<br/>
totally screwed up my profit/loss numbers).  However, when I asked a<br/>
Rogue/Potter friend of mine about the medium bowls (wondering if there<br/>
were something a little easier I should be making at this time) all I<br/>
got was &quot;Pottery is a pretty useless skill unless you&#39;re a Rogue.  Why<br/>
do you want to take up pottery?&quot;  ... Well, cuz I want to, dangit,<br/>
that&#39;s why! ...  But since his question this afternoon, two other<br/>
folks asked me just about the same thing - &quot;Why?&quot;...  I don&#39;t have<br/>
visions of becoming independantly wealthy from the skill though I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t mind if it brought in a little coin.  Is this &quot;just a hobby&quot;<br/>
that&#39;s going to always cost more than it makes me?  Or is it possible<br/>
to actually profit (or at least break even) in the future?<br/>
<br/>
TIA!!<br/>
