<div id="ygrps-yiv-433649556">I am currently playing (3am PDT) on Mon 26th and I am making pottery in High Hold. I am getting the same rates of return as always, with one or two copper difference (first time in this city). But I am still buying:<br/>
sketch  11c<br/>
water   15c<br/>
block of clay 44c (x2=88c)<br/>
High quaality Firing Sheet   44c<br/>
Selling finished pie tin-   630c<br/>
Not the best i have done, but still profitable. And I made 17 of 20 successfully.<br/>
