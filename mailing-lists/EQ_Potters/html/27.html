<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;If all you want to do is a trade to make money, &gt;pottery is not the one.<br/>
&gt;Baking is a good one, up to 30 plat an hour <br/>

 </span></blockquote>What do you bake to make 30p an hour?  I started pottery to make pie tins and pots for my baking skills.  But so far with baking the most complicated stuff I&#39;ve made are fish rolls, and they don&#39;t have much profit.<br/>
