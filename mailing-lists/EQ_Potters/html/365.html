Getting a bit discouraged here....<br/>

Pretty much theres only three reasons to take up pottery at the moment<br/>
1. You&#39;re a rogue<br/>
2. You&#39;re a tailor<br/>
3. You&#39;re a baker.<br/>
<br/>
From what I&#39;ve found there no market selling pottery items to any of the<br/>
three people above, as anyone can become a master potter for an outlay of<br/>
only 20pp. Hopefully they&#39;ll expand it a little so that there is a point to<br/>
some pottery items besides being used for other trade skills - if you could<br/>
make something that people would actually use, rather than something they<br/>
just use as a component to make something else, then there would be a<br/>
market for it. I&#39;d like to see 10 slot clay jars, so we could finally stop<br/>
those tailors gouging the market for 100-150pp a backpack :)</div>
