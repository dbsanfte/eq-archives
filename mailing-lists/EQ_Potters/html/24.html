<div id="ygrps-yiv-1227934075">If all you want to do is a trade to make money, pottery is not the one.<br/>
 Usually there is some item that is missing from an area, sketches of<br/>
firing sheets.<br/>
<br/>
Baking is a good one, up to 30 plat an hour around Rivervale<br/>
Brewing also nets around 30 plat an hour in West freeport with the<br/>
benefit of never having to zone<br/>
<br/>
The other thing is you don&#39;t have to find customers, which for Smithing<br/>
are VERY scarce these days<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I recently started in pottery, but I started to make<br/>
&gt; items to work with<br/>
&gt; my baking skill.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have heard of people able to make money from<br/>
&gt; pottery.  Some of the<br/>
&gt; items you can make (such as the pie tin) can be sold<br/>
&gt; to the store for a<br/>
&gt; few gold over the cost of the parts.  While this<br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t the massive amounts<br/>
&gt; of platinum I have heard of people making off of<br/>
&gt; smithing, I have only spent<br/>
&gt; a few plat raising my skill and it seems to go up<br/>
&gt; very quickly.  I put only<br/>
&gt; one training point into pottery and now have a 30 or<br/>
&gt; so while only spending<br/>
&gt; a few plat (assuming you can make some items you can<br/>
&gt; sell back to the<br/>
&gt; stores).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You may be able to make more off of some of the<br/>
&gt; higher level pottery<br/>
&gt; items, but as I said I only have a 30 skill or so. <br/>
&gt; I would guess if you are<br/>
&gt; just looking to make money, you can make a little<br/>
&gt; with pottery, but this<br/>
&gt; should not be your first choice.  Do it for<br/>
&gt; role-playing or to support<br/>
&gt; another trade skill.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Not sure what the benefits are for this skill. I<br/>
&gt; can say, that seems like<br/>
&gt; &gt; everyone has taken the more popular/profitable<br/>
&gt; skills - smithing,<br/>
&gt; &gt; bowyer/fletching, jeweler and a few have taken<br/>
&gt; cooking and/or brewing. I can<br/>
&gt; &gt; tell you this much about the other skills, they<br/>
&gt; take a ton of cash to<br/>
&gt; &gt; improve them. If anyone could enlighten us all,<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d be much abliged.<br/>
