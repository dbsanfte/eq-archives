<div id="ygrps-yiv-516448035">It&#39;s nice to see that this list is not totally dead.<br/>

Probably everyone knows this already, but supposedly someone in Verant is<br/>
busily working to revamp all the trade skills, including pottery.  There<br/>
were some recent improvements to Tailoring and Blacksmithing, so I think<br/>
it&#39;s safe to say we should see some real improvment to the Pottery skill<br/>
sometime fairly soon.</div>
