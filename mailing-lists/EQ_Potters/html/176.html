<div id="ygrps-yiv-1659917880">Yes you are right about speculation, and who is to say that the cost of<br/>
the sketches are going to go up? what if the pie tin price goes down<br/>
instead?<br/>

&gt; Well we knew it would be coming I haven&#39;t checked yet but if it is only on<br/>
&gt; the test server this is my recommendation.  Pot till you drop because it<br/>
&gt; will be everywhere on Tuesday.  The second thing is the mystical word<br/>
&gt; SPECULATION.  You heard it right just like the big time investors do on TV.<br/>
&gt; When you get ready to log off for the last time before the patch fill your<br/>
&gt; inventory with those beautiful sketches that cost a little over a silver.<br/>
&gt; Since you can usually sell items back for about half of the store price and<br/>
&gt; the store price is now over a plat you should be able to sell each sketch<br/>
&gt; for about a 5G profit.  Assume that you fill the bank and your personal<br/>
&gt; inventory with sketches.  8 bank slots 8 personal slots each with a<br/>
&gt; backpack.  That is 128 available slots to fill with stacks of 20 sketches<br/>
&gt; for a total of 2560 sketches each with a 5G profit.  Surprise, Surprise that<br/>
&gt; is over 1000P in one night with no effort on your part : )  Enjoy it.  It<br/>
&gt; may be the last profit you will see with pottery.<br/>

&gt; &gt;  What are you talking about?  1225c per sketch?  Last night I made my<br/>
&gt; usual<br/>
&gt; &gt;batch of pie tins and made the same 5 plat profit I usually make.  Or are<br/>
&gt; you<br/>
&gt; &gt;talking about the upcoming changes on the test server?<br/>
