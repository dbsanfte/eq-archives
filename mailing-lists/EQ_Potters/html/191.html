&gt;&gt;They come to a server near you on Tuesday.  So up until TUESDAY you can<br/>
&gt;&gt;make pie tins at the normal profit rate.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyone know if they are adjusting pie tin prices to match?  I mean, nerfing<br/>
&gt;the sketch price so you can&#39;t make a profit selling to merchants is one thing,<br/>
&gt;but nerfing the price so you can&#39;t sell to players is just stupid.  If the<br/>
&gt;intent is to provide incentive to sell to players, keeping the merchant price<br/>
&gt;of pie tins at around 7g (to buy) and raising our price to create them above a<br/>
&gt;plat is just mean.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
You lose 8g per attempt when you succeed (as the sketch cost 1100cp)<br/>
