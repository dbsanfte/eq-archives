<div id="ygrps-yiv-760086352">I am a master potter in Halas.  This morning I logged on and went to make my usual 15 pie tins.  Out of the 15, I had 7 misses.  I am thinking it has been nerfed, as brewing was.  Would anyone else try and let me know if you&#39;ve had the same experience, please?  Thanks.<br/>
