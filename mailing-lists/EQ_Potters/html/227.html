<div id="ygrps-yiv-943098892">&lt;&lt;I got a friend w/ levitate and ran all over the OOT last night, and all I<br/>
succeeded in doing was almost getting hammered by a lev 53 mob on Lizard<br/>
island.  Does anyone seem to have any specifics????<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>About the sketches or the Lizard?  I can tell you that that was the Allizwesaur,<br/>
a dinosaur who is the sole resident of that island.  I don&#39;t know if he&#39;s ever<br/>
been killed, but he can double attack for about 200 pts each.  Ouch.<br/>
<br/>
I am guessing that either Zach Reigh&#39;s isle or the Sisters are the sellers of<br/>
the sketches.  I haven&#39;t found out yet, as i&#39;m in Everfrost and more interested<br/>
in the Poison Vials right now anyway.<br/>
