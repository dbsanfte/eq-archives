<div id="ygrps-yiv-2030233512">You have to loot them, buy them from other PCs, or buy them from merchants<br/>
that PCs have sold them too.  It is a pain getting them.  There are several<br/>
undead pyramids or something like that which are good places to hunt them.<br/>
My favorite is the one south of the centaur camp in South Karana.  Save the<br/>
skeleton bones and auction them in zone.  There are always a lot of necros<br/>
in the area.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck! And if you find a better place let me know.<br/>

I dont know if this was asked before but........<br/>
<br/>
I know you can buy fish scales and batwings at the merchant in EC. Is there<br/>
a place where you can buy zombie skins (used to make vials)? or do you have<br/>
to get them as loot?<br/>
