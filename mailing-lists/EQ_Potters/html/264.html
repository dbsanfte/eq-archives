<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1097536799">so far, have sold 3 of each at about these prices, and found 1 person who <br/>
decided to wait on a potter fried, and another who said good prices, but <br/>
none needed at the time....<br/>
not much of a market at the moment it seems....<br/>
<br/>
doesn&#39;t help that noone has any idea where to get poison making supplies or <br/>
instructions.<br/>
<br/>
currently thinking about selling at 2pp for normal, 5pp for lined, with 10% <br/>
off per 5, up to 40% off...tho i may give up on it when i max my pottery <br/>
again if the market doesn&#39;t improve...<br/>
<br/>
skill is at 153, and lined is still not trivial<br/>

&gt;high<br/>

&gt;Here&#39;s the problem with this.  A friend of mine started from scratch since<br/>
&gt;the patch and started pottery.  He made master level in about 30 plat.  If<br/>
&gt;you charge 2p per vial, why would he not just become a potter himself?  I<br/>
&gt;mean, for the cost of 15 vials, he can make his own, never have to auction,<br/>
&gt;never have a shortage.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The problem is, I consider 2p a perfectly reasonable price considering the<br/>
&gt;costs of making the vials.  The problem is that EQ trade skills are messed<br/>
&gt;up and this is just another example if it.<br/>
