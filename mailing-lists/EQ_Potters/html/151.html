&gt;Ok, I love this list!! I just have one question...<br/>
&gt;I have a 120 currently in pottery and have tried to make mixing bowls. I <br/>
&gt;made them with no problems, but having 7 backpacks on me for materials, when <br/>
&gt;i successfully fired the bowl, it droped to the ground because a container <br/>
&gt;can&#39;t be stored in another container..... now, how in the world are you <br/>
&gt;doing this efficiently? As it is, I have a better/faster time making pie <br/>
&gt;tins..... any help would be greatly appreciated!!<br/>

pottery using jars.  Here&#39;s what I ended up doing.  <br/>
<br/>
Put the unfinished bowls into backpacks.  It&#39;s not a container until after<br/>
you&#39;ve fired it in a kiln.  Get another backpack full of firing sheets.<br/>
Put everything else into the bank, and just carry a backpack of unfinished<br/>
bowls and a backpack of firing sheets.  Fire bowls until you fill up your<br/>
remaining inventory, and then go sell.  Repeat as required.<br/>
