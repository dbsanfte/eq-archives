<div id="ygrps-yiv-1738445823">Someone in the last digest asked about spit sketches.  At last check, there <br/>
is no such thing. Spits were added to the game a few weeks back for cooks.  <br/>
Already made, they cost 3 gold (or less, based on charisma), and are sold by <br/>
the same merchants who sell the smithing molds for baking (pie tins, etc.)<br/>

For *other* pottery sketch locations, you can check out <br/>
