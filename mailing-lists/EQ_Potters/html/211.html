&lt;&lt; That is what happened to Brewing.  It<br/>
 was profitable, but then it wasn&#39;t after the last patch, but there was never<br/>
 anything mentioned about it before or after. &gt;&gt;<br/>

Nah...it wouldn&#39;t have happend to brewing that way...they changed the way the <br/>
skill worked...not the price of components...no way to make a &#39;quick&#39; buck <br/>
off it like with the pie tins...</div>
