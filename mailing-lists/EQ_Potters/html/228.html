<div id="ygrps-yiv-2004610130">&lt;&lt;Here is what some of our better potters have come up with as far as a good<br/>
possibility. This formula was tried and they did not get the msg these Items do<br/>
not combine to create anything. They simply got you do not have enough skill.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Denali, can you give us an estimate of what skill level these folks were at?<br/>
Most &quot;Master&quot; Potters i know are varying between 115 (the highest, i believe,<br/>
you can get with just Pie Tins) and 148 (the highest, i believe, you can get<br/>
with Large Bowls).  I myself and a 133, and conveniently currently in Everfrost.<br/>
I&#39;ll try to pick up some of the items mentioned tonight.<br/>
