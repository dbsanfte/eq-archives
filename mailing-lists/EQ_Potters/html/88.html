<div id="ygrps-yiv-652062226">Here&#39;s my method...<br/>
<br/>
You need 42 free slots (20 sketches, 20 flasks of water, 40 blocks of clay =<br/>
42 slots.) 2 regular inventory slots are used for flasks and sketches. the<br/>
other slots are my 6 packs (total 48 free slots). I add my pottery book and<br/>
7 different types of food, including water (being a ranger that&#39;s usually<br/>
berries, grapes, vegetables, roots, pig meat, pods of water, fishing grubs<br/>
and muffins). Leaving 40 slots for clay.<br/>
<br/>
That way I can buy clay with impunity and not have to worry about buying too<br/>
much.<br/>

All,<br/>
<br/>
I am a halfling who has spent most of his potting days in Halas.  I am a<br/>
master with a skill of 113 and have been spending most of my time on pie<br/>
tins.  At the best, I can make 15-20 pp an hour.  Do you have any tips on<br/>
how many of each item you buy per round, etc?  I can&#39;t fathom being able<br/>
to make that much pp in an hour.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any help,<br/>
<br/>
