<div id="ygrps-yiv-1530640960">The prices of pie tins and mixing bowls have gone up on the new patch.  HOWEVER there are 3 new sketches available.  All are vial sketches.  No where in Halas could I find the recipe.  I even bought the book again, and it&#39;s the same old one.  Anyone have any ideas?  Thanks <br/>
