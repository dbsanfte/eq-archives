<div id="ygrps-yiv-1825824560">I&#39;ve totally maxed my skill in pottery.  And I do make decent profit on<br/>
pottery vials.  I got a few customers from advertising on message boards.<br/>
Others I&#39;ve gotten in game.  At first I used to keep vials in stock and<br/>
occasionally check /w rogue and ask any rogue of high enough level if they<br/>
were interested in buying or if they have any friends that were interested.<br/>
If I find a good customer I put them on my friends list.  Now I just give<br/>
them a tell and see if they want any and what kind (I only have about 3<br/>
regular customers).  I never have stock anymore because they usually buy<br/>
what ever I make.  I sell the vials for a reasonable price to keep good<br/>
customers.  I also try to save items they may need to make poison.  Poison<br/>
skill is so time consuming as it is, they may as well save some time & buy<br/>
the vials as oppose to making them.  Don&#39;t let anyone convince you that<br/>
pottery is not profitable.  It is, just need to be a good merchant.<br/>

<br/>
Getting a bit discouraged here....<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve only recently taken up pottery, I reached level 48 just today.<br/>
Information online is sketchy and inconsistent but I&#39;ve been doing<br/>
pretty good at piecing things together by going through this list&#39;s<br/>
archives, using the Guide in the game or, when all else fails, trial<br/>
and error.  All in all I&#39;ve found it&#39;s fun and I&#39;ve only &quot;lost&quot; around<br/>
4pp (was less than that but my (lack of) success rate with bowls<br/>
totally screwed up my profit/loss numbers).  However, when I asked a<br/>
Rogue/Potter friend of mine about the medium bowls (wondering if there<br/>
were something a little easier I should be making at this time) all I<br/>
got was &quot;Pottery is a pretty useless skill unless you&#39;re a Rogue.  Why<br/>
do you want to take up pottery?&quot;  ... Well, cuz I want to, dangit,<br/>
that&#39;s why! ...  But since his question this afternoon, two other<br/>
folks asked me just about the same thing - &quot;Why?&quot;...  I don&#39;t have<br/>
visions of becoming independantly wealthy from the skill though I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t mind if it brought in a little coin.  Is this &quot;just a hobby&quot;<br/>
that&#39;s going to always cost more than it makes me?  Or is it possible<br/>
to actually profit (or at least break even) in the future?<br/>
<br/>
TIA!!<br/>
