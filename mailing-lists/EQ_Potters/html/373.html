<div id="ygrps-yiv-853777643">I know that there was some discussion on this back in February, and 2 <br/>
recipes were posted (small protection and small resistance). Were any <br/>
more discovered?<br/>
<br/>
Has Verant done anything to fix the equipping problem, or did we just <br/>
never figure out how to use them properly? I know that race and diety <br/>
worship was tried and nothing resolved.<br/>
