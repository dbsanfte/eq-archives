<b>Subject:</b> mixing bowls <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-697539138">Ok, I love this list!! I just have one question...<br/>
I have a 120 currently in pottery and have tried to make mixing bowls. I <br/>
made them with no problems, but having 7 backpacks on me for materials, when <br/>
i successfully fired the bowl, it droped to the ground because a container <br/>
can&#39;t be stored in another container..... now, how in the world are you <br/>
doing this efficiently? As it is, I have a better/faster time making pie <br/>
tins..... any help would be greatly appreciated!!</div>
