<div id="ygrps-yiv-1041987352">Well, it was fun while it lasted.  I was able to buy a Dragoon Dirk, a<br/>
Gossimer Robe, and all of my spells to date via pottery. I am level 17 now,<br/>
so the money is rolling in good enough from loot that I can almost afford to<br/>
give up pottery, but still - it was nice to be able to make money without<br/>
risk.<br/>
<br/>
I think we all knew (but didn&#39;t want to accept) that the remainder of trade<br/>
skills were going to be nerfed when they nerfed brewing. I honestly can&#39;t<br/>
believe that they waited this long....<br/>
<br/>
Buying hordes of sketches isn&#39;t going to be the answer either - since they<br/>
max you can buy and horde is 80 (if you have 10 position containers in the<br/>
bank) stacks of 20, how long can that last someone???<br/>
<br/>
I think tonight calls for one last &quot;run&quot; on pottery - but I can only imagine<br/>
how long the lines are going to be at the wheel...<br/>
