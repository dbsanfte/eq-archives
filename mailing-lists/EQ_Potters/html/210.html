&lt;&lt; one question.  is this a bannable exploit?  will Verant take away all the<br/>
 plat we made in selling these sketches?  i know that they monitor all<br/>
 purchases, which is how they know if potions are being bought or not. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t understand how this can be a bannable exploit...I call it...an <br/>
investment.  It was a risk...it wasn&#39;t a 100% guarantee that it would work.  <br/>
Would you feel guilty to find out that tomorrow each sheet of toilet paper in <br/>
your house was worth 100 dollars?  Would you sell it or use it? heh...</div>
