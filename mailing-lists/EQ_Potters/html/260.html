<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-858777848"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;This is second hand, but one of the posts, said the image of the &gt;molds was <br/>
&gt;visibly altered, and that the three people who posted that &gt;they found them <br/>
&gt;were all from the same small rural isp.  I haven&#39;t &gt;verified it, and I <br/>
&gt;probably won&#39;t I&#39;m not in a big hurry to make &gt;weapons.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Didn&#39;t check on the sketches, but I can vouch that it was a hoax. The IP #&#39;s <br/>
were almost identical - meaning that all the posts about the mold were <br/>
nothing more than one person logging in multiple times (perhaps multiple <br/>
accounts?) and posting the messages to make it look legit. Also, if you had <br/>
a way to look at the &quot;screenshot&quot; closely, you could see a number of things <br/>
didn&#39;t match meaning the &quot;screenshot&quot; had been doctored.</div>
