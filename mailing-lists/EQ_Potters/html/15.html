<div id="ygrps-yiv-214407032">First, thanks to everyone for the help on finding firing sheets around<br/>
Freeport, I finally found them!<br/>
<br/>
Next, is there somewhere to find a sketch for a pot around Freeport?  I<br/>
tried the store next to the bank, but they do not have a sketch for a<br/>
pot.  Is there somewhere else around to try?<br/>
<br/>
                                                    Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
                                                                Soren</div>
