<div id="ygrps-yiv-137783586">On the Test server with a Barbarian shaman, 55cha, a pie tin costs 1p 2g<br/>
2s 5c.  Now my question is will this pie tin be considered version 1? or<br/>
version 2?<br/>
<br/>
If it is considered version 1, then we have made a boat load of cash,<br/>
otherwise we should still be able to make some cash from makeing the pie<br/>
tins, unless they raise the price of clay and firing sheets also, didn&#39;t<br/>
check that when i was looged into the test server. Will try to check other<br/>
ones later.<br/>

&gt; &gt; That is 128 available slots to fill with stacks of 20 sketches<br/>
&gt; &gt;  for a total of 2560 sketches each with a 5G profit.  Surprise, Surprise <br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt;  is over 1000P in one night with no effort on your part : )<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	Can someone that has played on the test server give the exact price <br/>
&gt; the new sketches sell for?  I don&#39;t want to go out and buy a ton then end up <br/>
&gt; having them be worth a few copper.  But I could always just use them for the <br/>
&gt; pie tins, right?  They still sell for the same price as they used to, or was <br/>
&gt; that nerfed to?  Oh well... <br/>
