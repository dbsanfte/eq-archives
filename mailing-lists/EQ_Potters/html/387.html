&gt; Well Met Lannella<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.  I&#39;ve still got a fair bit of work to do.  Zombie skins are not as<br/>
common as they used to seem to be.  I seem to remember that every merchant<br/>
under the sun would have a few zombie skins in their inventory no matter how<br/>
far zombies were to them.  Now, I&#39;m lucky to find more than a few in the<br/>
zone!<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Lots of us Mud Slingers are hanging out at the Trader&#39;s Corner<br/>
&gt; www.eqtraders.com<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There is a 3rd Wisdom Diety made from the Sands of Ro.<br/>
&gt; Currently /Bugged since it does fit in Off-Hand, but not the<br/>
&gt; Ranged weapons slot as well excludes Shamans.<br/>
<br/>
Yakatazima (sp?) has promised that it&#39;ll be fixed in the next major patch.<br/>
Huzzah!  I&#39;ve had quite the success so far vending my Prot & Res deities,<br/>
but I&#39;ve noticed its starting to taper off already.  I&#39;d gotten up to the<br/>
point where I was carrying a backpack of each, but I&#39;m cutting back down to<br/>
one again.<br/>
/em sighs.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Curious: Backstabbing Babe<br/>
&gt; Have you stopped by www.thesafehouse.org yet?<br/>
<br/>
Oh, yes!  An invaluable resource for us roguelings.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Niami has Poison Vendors on her site as well.<br/>
&gt; I usually make my own vials, but Toxdilla in West Freeport tunnels.<br/>
&gt; Head right out of the West Gate to the hidden wall.<br/>
<br/>
I found him last night.  I&#39;d found the hidden entrance to the *left* of the<br/>
gate, but had missed Toxdil&#39;s entrance.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; And another vendor out in West Karana close to the North Karana borders.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Even if you haven&#39;t hit your 20th season... you COULD be<br/>
&gt; making poisions right now.  My Bar Wench on Morrell-Thule is<br/>
&gt; still too young to apply her toxins, but has disproved the notion<br/>
&gt; that she had to wait until her 20th to use a Mortar & Pestal to<br/>
&gt; make spider and snake poisons!<br/>
<br/>
I had the adventure last night of Sneak/Hiding my way to the merchant in<br/>
Dragnor&#39;s Cauldron last night.  Got to him, bought my mortor and a stack of<br/>
plain suspensions, and got attacked.  Luckily, another NPC was around and<br/>
dismissed the skel & gob that found me together.  I re-S/H and started out<br/>
to BB when a Gob Mariner saw through and pulpified me.  I got everything<br/>
recovered and I&#39;ve re-settled back in Freeport  :-)<br/>
Question:  Is Make Poisons a skill that requires a skill point to be used to<br/>
&quot;prime&quot; it, like some of the skills (Backstab) or is it along the lines of<br/>
the true trade skills and will go up by itself?  At approximately 2-3pp per<br/>
attempt (1p+ vial, 6g+ suspension, plus value of venom sacs), it&#39;s a bit<br/>
expensive to practice on.  I might take a few attempts at it, but depending<br/>
on whether I get skill increases, may let it go till I can invest points<br/>
into it.<br/>
