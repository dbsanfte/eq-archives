<div id="ygrps-yiv-480718066">Ok..actually there is a NPC rogue who makes poison if you supply the ingridients.<br/>
After that if you are a rogue all you have to do is apply the poison.<br/>
2 spider venom sacks<br/>
20gp<br/>
1 bottle of Crow&#39;s brew<br/>
I know that there are more recipes in the poison book, but this is the simplest.<br/>
Its easy to get it.<br/>

&gt;         I was informed by a rogue who was taking up pottery(only found one<br/>
&gt; who would buy vials, the rest decided they would learn to make their<br/>
&gt; own&lt;grumble&gt;) that their aren&#39;t any poison recipes using the sealed vial<br/>
&gt; yet, so that I shouldn&#39;t bother trying to make one.  Could anyone confirm this?<br/>
