&gt;         I was informed by a rogue who was taking up pottery(only found one<br/>
&gt; who would buy vials, the rest decided they would learn to make their<br/>
&gt; own&lt;grumble&gt;) that their aren&#39;t any poison recipes using the sealed vial<br/>
&gt; yet, so that I shouldn&#39;t bother trying to make one.  Could anyone confirm this?<br/>
