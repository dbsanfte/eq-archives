<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-707821308">I too wondered about buying the sketches and selling<br/>
them back. I bought all my poor encumbered wood<br/>
elf could hold (and would fit in the bank) thinking <br/>
 I would simply make pie<br/>
tins after the patch.  Well, I found I had enough <br/>
space to carry some water, two lumps of clay and <br/>
a firing sheet, just enough to see if they still<br/>
worked.<br/>
<br/>
I decided to sell several of the backpacks full<br/>
at auction.  This was easy and I got 40pp per<br/>
backpack full.  It was fun answering the jerks <br/>
that yelled &quot;Rip-off!  They sell for 1s each!&quot;  <br/>
I have begun making pie tins <br/>
with the remainder, and expect to spend a very<br/>
long time at the wheel<br/>
<br/>
Verant specifically lists buying an item from a <br/>
vendor and selling it back at a higher price as<br/>
a bannable offense.  I didn&#39;t want to take the <br/>
chance.  <br/>
