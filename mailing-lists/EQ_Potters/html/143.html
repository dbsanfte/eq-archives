<div id="ygrps-yiv-2103771566">As of late, the failure rate has been MUCH higher. On saturday after 5<br/>
batches of 20 attempts, I was average 5-6 fails per 20. Then, on Sunday I<br/>
hit 20 for 20. Go figure. I think it will get nerfed soon. I think this<br/>
filure rate is an interim fix until they can adjust the price of the sketch.<br/>

  Subject: [EQ_Potters] Pottery Nerfed?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I am a master potter in Halas.  This morning I logged on and went to make<br/>
my usual 15 pie tins.  Out of the 15, I had 7 misses.  I am thinking it has<br/>
been nerfed, as brewing was.  Would anyone else try and let me know if<br/>
you&#39;ve had the same experience, please?  Thanks.<br/>
