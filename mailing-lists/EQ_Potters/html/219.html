<b>Subject:</b> New Weapon Sketches! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-474808190">Any of you guys have any information about the new Pottery weapon sketches <br/>
that were found?  I was reading about them on the eqvault trade board and it <br/>
seems that several people have found weapon sketches for pottery that were <br/>
implemented with the new pottery changes.  From what I&#39;ve heard, they were <br/>
found on an npc on a remote island in the Ocean of Tears.  Seems there are a <br/>
good variety of different sketchs...all weapons.  Nobody that i know of has <br/>
successfully made the items that the sketches fashion yet, because the <br/>
materials are unknown as of yet.  It is also not known whether they actually <br/>
make weapons themselves or that they make molds that can then be used for <br/>
blacksmithing (which seems more likely of the two).  I&#39;d love to hear any <br/>
additional information anyone may have!  This could be a breakthrough for us <br/>
potters =)<br/>
