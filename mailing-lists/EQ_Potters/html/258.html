<div id="ygrps-yiv-1206807056"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;Someone might have already sent this in, but the eqvault board that<br/>
&gt;&gt;had the messages about the weapon/weapon-mold sketches, now has <br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;messagesindicating it was a hoax, including an apparent confession to <br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;the hoax.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Don&#39;t know what to believe at this point. Personally, they could very well <br/>
&gt;exist. After all, if they did and everyone suddenly took an interest in <br/>
&gt;finding them, I&#39;d admit it was a hoax to, to eliminate any competition. <br/>
&gt;Personally, I&#39;ll have a look for myself to verify the case either way.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is second hand, but one of the posts, said the image of the molds was<br/>
visibly altered, and that the three people who posted that they found them<br/>
were all from the same small rural isp.  I haven&#39;t verified it, and I<br/>
probably won&#39;t I&#39;m not in a big hurry to make weapons.</div>
