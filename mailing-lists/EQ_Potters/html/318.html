<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1148992967">Hello all, <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve received a few requests for information regarding the craftability of sealed vials in the game. I thought I&#39;d stop by and lend a hand. <br/>
<br/>
Sealed vials are currently not craftable by players, despite the sketch being available on a vendor. Our craft designer is currently looking at poison and pottery, and they&#39;ll be getting an update after the New Year. <br/>
<br/>
When the sealed vial does become craftable, you&#39;ll see the recipe listed in your book. <br/>

I found this on the safe house message board.  I know no one answered my sealed vial post, but in case you were thinking about it.  I guess don&#39;t bother.  I wonder how much this applies to brewing.<br/>
