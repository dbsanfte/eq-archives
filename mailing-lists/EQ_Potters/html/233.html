<b>Subject:</b> SPOILER - VIAL RECIPE <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1060342568">OK, since people who announce they know something but are not telling annoy<br/>
me, I will send out the formula for everyone.  I made multiple vials and will<br/>
list<br/>
my skill levels below:<br/>
<br/>
Vial<br/>
<br/>
Small Block of Clay<br/>
Any non-ruined pelt - I have succeeded with Black Wolf Skin,<br/>
                Puma Skin, Grizzley Skin, Low Qual Bear Pelt,<br/>
                Med Qual Cat Pelt, High Qual Cat Pelt<br/>
Vial Sketch<br/>
High Quality Firing Sheet<br/>
<br/>
Lined Vial<br/>
<br/>
Small Block of Clay<br/>
Any non-ruined pelt<br/>
Lined Vial sketch<br/>
High Quality Firing Sheet (?)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
With a skill of 120, I was successful on making 6 of 7 vial attempts.<br/>
My rate with lined vial attempts was 0 of 9, although I was received<br/>
the &quot;Lack Skill&quot; message and not the &quot;Does not Combine&quot; message.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>
<br/>
                                                                Soren<br/>
                                                                Master Potter<br/>
                                                                New friend to<br/>
rogues...<br/>

&gt; Well, boys and girls I have the Vial formula.... I will announce this to the<br/>
&gt; board shortly however I would like to get the formula to a Small Diety<br/>
&gt; sketch as a trade, so if anyone has it please e-mail me or reply to this<br/>
&gt; group.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The Poison Vial when completely made is::::<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Stackable<br/>
&gt; costs 4g 5s to make<br/>
&gt; sells for 5g 2s to NPC&#39;s<br/>
&gt; needs a high pottery skill  (mine was 129 and it went up when i was making<br/>
&gt; the vials)<br/>
&gt; the recipe uses 4 of the wheel slots.....Clay water sketch and the mystery<br/>
&gt; component ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As I said i&#39;ll give the whole thing prob on Sat or Sun but I wanted to give<br/>
&gt; a heads up in advance to anyone who has the Small Diety Formula..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Torii Druid 12th Season  Povar<br/>
&gt; Rolletta Shaman 16th Season  Povar<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Wish i was smart enough to stock up on the sketches and sell em....   :(<br/>
