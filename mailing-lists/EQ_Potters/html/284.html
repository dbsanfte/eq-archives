<div id="ygrps-yiv-1869175647">Thanks for your reply.<br/>
<br/>
Seems like somebody must know about how to make deities.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the info on pricing the vials, sounds like my pricing is about<br/>
right.  Seems like the lined ones are too expensive or their skill isn&#39;t<br/>
high enough to create a demand.<br/>
<br/>
I do pretty good begging.  But still it is a worthless skill.  I usually<br/>
only get &quot;1 copper&quot;, occasionally (maybe 1 out of 100 tries) get 1 silver.<br/>
The only difference is that the frequency of getting anything has increased.<br/>
And I&#39;m much more confident now to beg &quot;reds&quot;, and get money from them as<br/>
well.  I have never had any faction problems with it.  That only happens if<br/>
you attack it and they die.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!<br/>

<br/>
still never heard anything definite on deities...was rumors a while back <br/>
that the cookie cutter sketches were involved, but no luck with anything  <br/>
tried...<br/>
as far as i know, skill maxes at 168 with lined poison vials.<br/>
was selling around 1 - 1.5 for normal vials before, but prices may rise a <br/>
bit since enchanters will need them too once the new spells work...sold 40 <br/>
for 2pp each yesterday to one...<br/>
think i was asking 2-3 for lined, but not much luck selling them...still got<br/>
<br/>
80 left from maxing my skill...<br/>
<br/>
also how is begging? haven&#39;t met too many who have built up that skill...and<br/>
<br/>
have heard rumors of faction problems with it?<br/>
