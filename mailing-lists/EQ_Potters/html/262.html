 </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s the problem with this.  A friend of mine started from scratch since<br/>
the patch and started pottery.  He made master level in about 30 plat.  If<br/>
you charge 2p per vial, why would he not just become a potter himself?  I<br/>
mean, for the cost of 15 vials, he can make his own, never have to auction,<br/>
never have a shortage.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is, I consider 2p a perfectly reasonable price considering the<br/>
costs of making the vials.  The problem is that EQ trade skills are messed<br/>
up and this is just another example if it.<br/>
