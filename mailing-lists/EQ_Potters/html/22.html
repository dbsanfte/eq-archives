<b>Subject:</b> Re: Looking for item <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1035661059">I recently started in pottery, but I started to make items to work with<br/>
my baking skill.<br/>
<br/>
I have heard of people able to make money from pottery.  Some of the<br/>
items you can make (such as the pie tin) can be sold to the store for a<br/>
few gold over the cost of the parts.  While this isn&#39;t the massive amounts<br/>
of platinum I have heard of people making off of smithing, I have only spent<br/>
a few plat raising my skill and it seems to go up very quickly.  I put only<br/>
one training point into pottery and now have a 30 or so while only spending<br/>
a few plat (assuming you can make some items you can sell back to the<br/>
stores).<br/>
<br/>
You may be able to make more off of some of the higher level pottery<br/>
items, but as I said I only have a 30 skill or so.  I would guess if you are<br/>
just looking to make money, you can make a little with pottery, but this<br/>
should not be your first choice.  Do it for role-playing or to support<br/>
another trade skill.<br/>

&gt; Not sure what the benefits are for this skill. I can say, that seems like<br/>
&gt; everyone has taken the more popular/profitable skills - smithing,<br/>
&gt; bowyer/fletching, jeweler and a few have taken cooking and/or brewing. I can<br/>
&gt; tell you this much about the other skills, they take a ton of cash to<br/>
&gt; improve them. If anyone could enlighten us all, I&#39;d be much abliged.<br/>
