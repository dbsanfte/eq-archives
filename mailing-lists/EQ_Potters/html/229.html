&gt;About the sketches or the Lizard?  I can tell you that that was the <br/>
&gt; &gt;Allizwesaur, a dinosaur who is the sole resident of that island.  I <br/>
&gt; &gt;don&#39;t know if he&#39;s ever been killed, but he can double attack for &gt;about <br/>
&gt;200 pts each.  Ouch.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am guessing that either Zach Reigh&#39;s isle or the Sisters are the &gt;sellers <br/>
&gt;of the sketches.  I haven&#39;t found out yet, as i&#39;m in &gt;Everfrost and more <br/>
&gt;interested in the Poison Vials right now anyway.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t think it&#39;s on the Isle of Sisterhood. Been all over that island, and <br/>
haven&#39;t found them yet. Never been to Zach Reigh&#39;s island though. Anyone <br/>
have the locs of this island?</div>
