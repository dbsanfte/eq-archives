newbies - +3AC isn&#39;t bad at all. Pre-Kunark the best range slot item for a 
cleric (and a druid, I believe) is a Kerran Toy: +3AC, +2AGI. But it&#39;s nodrop 
and requires a quest that takes you from Steamfont to Kerra Isle which is just 
about the longest run you can imagine.</font></span></div>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Yes they did fix one of them that I know of. The 
Proctection Diety can now fit in the Range slot. I did not spread this around 
because I was afread they would Nerf it. It does go in the Range slot though 
&amp; that 3 AC is nice for lower level Players. I was the first one that I know 
of to figure this out. I went around selling them for 5pp each all night one 
night to newbies. The Resist one how ever, at the time I tried, did not work. 
This was over a month ago so they may have fixed the other one by 
now.</font></div>
