<b>Subject:</b> Best place to do pottery <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2006813400">Hello<br/>
<br/>
I dunno about Halas but i think the best place to do pottery is Kaladim. The <br/>
kiln and pottery wheel is right next to a pottery supplier. Although you <br/>
have to buy the sketches at Kelethin or Freeport, these are stackable and <br/>
take minimal space. I mastered pottery in no time (making pie tins galore) <br/>
at Kaladim. Water can be purchased at one of the guardhouses just outside <br/>
Kaladim.<br/>
<br/>
Kelethin is also a reasonable place to do pottery, since the whole city is <br/>
one zone, you don&#39;t have to load anything to get all your supplies and to <br/>
get to the equipment. You might get lost tho )<br/>
<br/>
Also a question, anyone know how to make a small deity?<br/>
Also where might i purchase a mixing bowl and pot sketch?<br/>
