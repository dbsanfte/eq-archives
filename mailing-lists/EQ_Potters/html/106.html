&gt;Hi all.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have been monitoring for awhile now and have been making pie tins. I have<br/>
&gt;my skill up to almost 100 now and am wondering a couple things:<br/>
&gt;First of all, what does the Diety sketch do.<br/>
&gt;Second, I have seen magical clay statues - how are these made? It HAS to be<br/>
&gt;with pottery, they are clay. Anyone know about updates for new enchanter<br/>
&gt;spells???<br/>
&gt;Third, How far will pie tins get me? I know that I am making some pretty<br/>
&gt;good money at it but what can I do to REALLY make money? I hear of people<br/>
&gt;making 30+ plat an hour of doing it, but what are you making? Any details<br/>
&gt;will be appreciated and a list of when things become trivial would help to!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks guys!!!<br/>
&gt;May pottery live on forever!<br/>
&gt;<br/>

I now have a skill of 120 something, (where mixing<br/>
bowls become trivial) but these numbers were done<br/>
@ a skill of 115 (where pie tins become trivial)<br/>
with a Cha of 90 I pay<br/>
<br/>
4s2c      Block of Clay<br/>
4s2c      Block of Clay<br/>
1s1c      Sketch (pie tin)<br/>
1s1c      Water<br/>
--------<br/>
8s6c      per unfired bowl attempt.<br/>
<br/>
with a success rate of 80.3 % at 115 ( this is over 158 attempts)<br/>
you get a cost per unfired bowl of<br/>
1/.803 * 8.6 = 10s1c per unfired bowl<br/>
<br/>
10s1c    per unfired bowl<br/>
  4s2c    per High Quality Firing Sheet<br/>
--------<br/>
14s3c    per fired tin attempt<br/>
<br/>
with a success rate of 96.1%<br/>
<br/>
1/.961 * 14.3 = 14s9c cost per pie tin<br/>
<br/>
I then sell them for 6g3s (63s)<br/>
(this was to alec greenglade, but<br/>
 I discovered I get 6g5s at Galio in<br/>
 the in next to the wheel)<br/>
<br/>
63s - 15s =48s or 4.8g per pie tin for profit.<br/>
(Now I have a higher success + higher resale<br/>
 so it&#39;s probably 5.1 or better)<br/>
<br/>
I make a single run to Merra Clayfinger to<br/>
start off the session, and buy 64 firing sheets.<br/>
<br/>
That minimizes the number of times I have to<br/>
make the 2 zone run for firing sheets.<br/>
<br/>
for each of these sessions then I average about<br/>
30pp profit.<br/>
(a bit more now)<br/>
<br/>
I takes just over an hour to use up the 64 firing<br/>
sheets, plus however long I have to sit and wait<br/>
for someone at the wheel</div>
