I have been making/selling 100&#39;s of poison vials to the small rogue<br/>
community on my server (to see how small on yours type /who all rogue 20<br/>
50), and doubling my investment (on supplies) with every sale.<br/>

Why are you bothering to do this?  Pottery was completely nerfed in the last<br/>
patch.  For awhile, I made some of the poison vials (pottery&#39;s new role in<br/>
the &quot;player based economy&quot; lie).  I ran across an NPC in Freeport<br/>
market that sells them for less than I can make them for.  Like it mattered.<br/>
I found the rogues on E. Marr at least, to be completely uninterested in<br/>
buying vials from me (even when I dropped the price to cost).  Instead, they<br/>
would simply develop pottery.  When they discover they can simply buy the<br/>
vials for FAR less, they won&#39;t even do this.</div>
