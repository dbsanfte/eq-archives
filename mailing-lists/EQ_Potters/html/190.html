<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-385113165">OK, has anybody found out the situation in regards to our beloved craft and<br/>
the latest patches?<br/>
<br/>
Just curious about pricing, selling, etc.  The questions I have are:<br/>
<br/>
How much has the cost gone up on the sketches?  Give a before and after<br/>
please<br/>
How much has the sell back value of sketches been altered?  Once again<br/>
before and after<br/>
Has the success rate been modified any?<br/>
Has the sale prices of finished products been altered?<br/>
Has there been any versioning of the sketches?  Meaning do the old sketches<br/>
sell for one price (back to merchants) and the new ones sell for a higher<br/>
price.<br/>
Are there any new sketches and additions to the pottery books?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
