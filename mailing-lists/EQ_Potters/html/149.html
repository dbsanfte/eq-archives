<div id="ygrps-yiv-877423817">I have no idea, the levels at which various items become trivial is<br/>
different for different people, and I can&#39;t figure out what it depends on,<br/>
pie tins became trivial for me at 115, and for a fellow bard with the same<br/>
int wis char agi and dex (not sure about str or sta, but why would they<br/>
affect it?) they became trivial at 105.  I am currently at one hundred and<br/>
thirty something in pottery, and using large bowls to increase my skill, but<br/>

mixing bowls, but they are containers.</div>
