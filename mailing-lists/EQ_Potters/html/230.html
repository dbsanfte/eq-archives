Keep in mind that the boat trip mapped was before the inclusion of the<br/>
SirensBane, though.  I have the two boats<br/>
mapped at home, though: From FP to BB, the boat stops at the Sisters and doesn&#39;t<br/>
 make the southern dip to stop at<br/>
Zach&#39;s; from BB to FP, it stops at Zach and then stay south of the 5 islands to<br/>
the other side.<br/>
