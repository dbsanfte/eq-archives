<div id="ygrps-yiv-478944852">Hi all.<br/>
<br/>
I have been monitoring for awhile now and have been making pie tins. I have <br/>
my skill up to almost 100 now and am wondering a couple things:<br/>
First of all, what does the Diety sketch do.<br/>
Second, I have seen magical clay statues - how are these made? It HAS to be <br/>
with pottery, they are clay. Anyone know about updates for new enchanter <br/>
spells???<br/>
Third, How far will pie tins get me? I know that I am making some pretty <br/>
good money at it but what can I do to REALLY make money? I hear of people <br/>
making 30+ plat an hour of doing it, but what are you making? Any details <br/>
will be appreciated and a list of when things become trivial would help to!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks guys!!!<br/>
May pottery live on forever!</div>
