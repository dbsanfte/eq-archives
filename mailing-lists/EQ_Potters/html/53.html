<div id="ygrps-yiv-527715047">If you can, the easiest place to do pottery near Qeynos is Halas, because<br/>
all the supplies are in the same zone.  Halas is not that far away, and<br/>
the trip through Blackburrow is probably very safe since there are often<br/>
so many players there.  That&#39;s my advice.<br/>

&gt; Does anyone know where I can get potters supplies (clay, scrolls, etc.) in<br/>
&gt; and around Queynos?  Or does anyone have a comprehensive list of pottery<br/>
&gt; merchants?<br/>
