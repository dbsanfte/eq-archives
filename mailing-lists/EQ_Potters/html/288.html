You can find everything you need here for all trade skills.  But seeing how<br/>
it appears you are potting at FP, firing sheets are located at the hut left<br/>
of the first inn in East Commons.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck! And if you ever figure out how to make deities be sure to let us<br/>
know.<br/>

Does anyone have a definitive list of the locations where I can buy<br/>
supplies?  I located the pottery sketches in North Freeport next to the<br/>
bank, and clay in North Freeport in Groflath&#39;s Forge shop (by the Bard<br/>
guild).  I can&#39;t seem to find High Quality Firing Sheets anywhere?  Does<br/>
anyone know?  Thanks.</div>
