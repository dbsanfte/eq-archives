<div id="ygrps-yiv-1257078719">still never heard anything definite on deities...was rumors a while back <br/>
that the cookie cutter sketches were involved, but no luck with anything  <br/>
tried...<br/>
as far as i know, skill maxes at 168 with lined poison vials.<br/>
was selling around 1 - 1.5 for normal vials before, but prices may rise a <br/>
bit since enchanters will need them too once the new spells work...sold 40 <br/>
for 2pp each yesterday to one...<br/>
think i was asking 2-3 for lined, but not much luck selling them...still got <br/>
80 left from maxing my skill...<br/>
<br/>
also how is begging? haven&#39;t met too many who have built up that skill...and <br/>
have heard rumors of faction problems with it?<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Does anyone know of a really good potter site?  I was wondering or have <br/>
&gt;been<br/>
&gt;asked how to make small dieties.  I&#39;m certain I&#39;ve met one person who has <br/>
&gt;made<br/>
&gt;them before (but I wasn&#39;t a potter back then).  Does someone have the <br/>
&gt;recipe<br/>
&gt;for that?  Also what is the highest skill level achieved at pottery so far?<br/>
&gt;  Any suggestions for pricing poison vials?  I&#39;m waivering between 1pp and <br/>
&gt;2pp<br/>
&gt;for regular ones.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
