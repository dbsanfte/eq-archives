<br/>
On EQ_Potters I uploaded a screen capture of Kiln and Pottery Wheel.<br/>
Ovens seem to be plentiful in Freeport, but as anyone used a SPIT?<br/>
Could you screenprint (Saves as .bmp) and by request convert to JPG.<br/>
Upload into the shared files.<br/>

I have seen baking as a nickle and dime profit if is stick with Rat ears<br/>
and Firebeetle Eyes for Edible Goo.  You get an average of 2s2c.<br/>
<br/>
With Wolf/Bear Meat - Spices (3c) - Short Beer (varies 1s ish). <br/>
You can make fine braised steaks.   Candied Spider legs also<br/>
are foragable if you have Frosting and Spices.   <br/>
The problem I&#39;ve had is saving a Large Sack just for <br/>
cooking ingredients and Backpack for the Pottery/Smithing supplies.<br/>
<br/>
An army fights on it&#39;s stomach, so not having to buy rations helps.<br/>
I havn&#39;t been able to afford out right buying a mixing bowl in<br/>
West Freeport - 1P2g5s.   The sketches available to potters does <br/>
not include a mixing bowl.  Any clues?<br/>
<br/>
I see Baking deserts with the right tins and pans as potentially<br/>
profitable in the field or during an event with Flea market wares.<br/>
<br/>
I just recently was able to make pottery skewers after several <br/>
attempts.  Haven&#39;t baked anything with them yet.<br/>
<br/>
It seems that baking is an &#39;after&#39; skill of Smithing and Pottery.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
