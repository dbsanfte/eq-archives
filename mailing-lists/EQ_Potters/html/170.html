<div id="ygrps-yiv-1658322339">Well we knew it would be coming I haven&#39;t checked yet but if it is only on<br/>
the test server this is my recommendation.  Pot till you drop because it<br/>
will be everywhere on Tuesday.  The second thing is the mystical word<br/>
SPECULATION.  You heard it right just like the big time investors do on TV.<br/>
When you get ready to log off for the last time before the patch fill your<br/>
inventory with those beautiful sketches that cost a little over a silver.<br/>
Since you can usually sell items back for about half of the store price and<br/>
the store price is now over a plat you should be able to sell each sketch<br/>
for about a 5G profit.  Assume that you fill the bank and your personal<br/>
inventory with sketches.  8 bank slots 8 personal slots each with a<br/>
backpack.  That is 128 available slots to fill with stacks of 20 sketches<br/>
for a total of 2560 sketches each with a 5G profit.  Surprise, Surprise that<br/>
is over 1000P in one night with no effort on your part : )  Enjoy it.  It<br/>
may be the last profit you will see with pottery.<br/>
