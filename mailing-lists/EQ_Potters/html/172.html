the sketch price so you can&#39;t make a profit selling to merchants is one thing,<br/>
but nerfing the price so you can&#39;t sell to players is just stupid.  If the<br/>
intent is to provide incentive to sell to players, keeping the merchant price<br/>
of pie tins at around 7g (to buy) and raising our price to create them above a<br/>
plat is just mean.<br/>
