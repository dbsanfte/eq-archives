&gt; Well, boys and girls I have the Vial formula.... I will announce this to the<br/>
&gt; board shortly however I would like to get the formula to a Small Diety<br/>
&gt; sketch as a trade, so if anyone has it please e-mail me or reply to this<br/>
&gt; group.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The Poison Vial when completely made is::::<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Stackable<br/>
&gt; costs 4g 5s to make<br/>
&gt; sells for 5g 2s to NPC&#39;s<br/>
&gt; needs a high pottery skill  (mine was 129 and it went up when i was making<br/>
&gt; the vials)<br/>
&gt; the recipe uses 4 of the wheel slots.....Clay water sketch and the mystery<br/>
&gt; component ;)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As I said i&#39;ll give the whole thing prob on Sat or Sun but I wanted to give<br/>
&gt; a heads up in advance to anyone who has the Small Diety Formula..<br/>
&gt; <br/>
