<div id="ygrps-yiv-1874532860">I came across a great Pottery reference page.<br/>
The content of it wasn&#39;t anything that most<br/>
of you haven&#39;t already learned.  For me<br/>
it was enlightentment.<br/>
<br/>
As a naive Smith, I learned two separate ore + flask of water.<br/>
Metal Bits.  <br/>
<br/>
I was stuck with Sharpening Stones and Rusty blades to increase my skill.<br/>
<br/>
CLAY... Can be combined to get a similar Skill<br/>
boost early.   I&#39;m still failing, but it costs<br/>
less than failed Skewer sketches and components.<br/>
<br/>
Combine on wheel.<br/>
3 SMALL blocks + Flask of water to get 1 Clay Block.<br/>
<br/>
Combine 3 Clay Blocks + Flask to get 1 LARGE clay block.  Simple.<br/>
<br/>
The opposite effect can be applied.<br/>
<br/>
Block of Clay + Flask yields a SMALL block of clay.  (Doh).<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy<br/>
