<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  I have just started with pottery as a way of using up all the clay I<br/>
&gt;  find in Beholder. <br/>
&gt;  I found a pottery wheel but have been unsuccessful in<br/>
&gt;  doing anything so far. Can someone fill me in on the basics?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It took me quite a few attempts to get anything to work.<br/>
You&#39;ll need a sketch and flask of water.   Some things require different<br/>
amounts of clay.   Block, Large Block etc...<br/>
<br/>
Review the Archived messages left previously and ask your question<br/>
again.  I can help give you the formula for some sketches.<br/>
<br/>
Also, the www.gameguides.com - unOfficial Everquest Guide is invaluable tome.<br/>
