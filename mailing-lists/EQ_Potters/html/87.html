<b>Subject:</b> Mechanics of making 60 pp an hour. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-650509818">All,<br/>
<br/>
I am a halfling who has spent most of his potting days in Halas.  I am a <br/>
master with a skill of 113 and have been spending most of my time on pie <br/>
tins.  At the best, I can make 15-20 pp an hour.  Do you have any tips on <br/>
how many of each item you buy per round, etc?  I can&#39;t fathom being able <br/>
to make that much pp in an hour.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any help, <br/>
<br/>
