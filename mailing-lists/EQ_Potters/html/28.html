<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1036963709">Depending on your skill, charisma, faction and mousing ability you can<br/>
churn out fish fillets and make money.  I only found this since I was<br/>
making fillets to raise to (82).  This is basically the same as Turgims<br/>
Fierce Brew in brewing, which I have found will make about the same<br/>
plat if you want it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m looking for what to bake to raise my skill and what items may have<br/>
benefits to them.  The reason I don&#39;t care about telling people there<br/>
is profit to be made is, it really doesn&#39;t hurt anyone, at least some<br/>
people will camp the ovens instead of MOB camps.  8)<br/>
<br/>
Besides you will tire of it after about 10-20 plat hehe,<br/>

&gt; From an earlier post, OT<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;If all you want to do is a trade to make money,<br/>
&gt; &gt;pottery is not the one.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Baking is a good one, up to 30 plat an hour <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What do you bake to make 30p an hour?  I started<br/>
&gt; pottery to make pie tins and pots for my baking<br/>
&gt; skills.  But so far with baking the most complicated<br/>
&gt; stuff I&#39;ve made are fish rolls, and they don&#39;t have<br/>
&gt; much profit.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sorry I know this is kinda off topic.<br/>
