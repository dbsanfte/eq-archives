<b>Subject:</b> location of sketches in or around Kaladim <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1162335195">I have heard that to buy sketches I have to go to Kelethin, but I have been unsuccessful in finding the appropriate vendor there.  Can somebody be so kind as to pinpoint who or what I am looking for?  Maybe a loc or directions.  I have made a 2nd character to pursue some of the things my poor little misunderstood Gnome Necro can not do in the world of Norath.</div>
