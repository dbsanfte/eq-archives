<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Yes they did fix one of them that I know of. The 
Proctection Diety can now fit in the Range slot. I did not spread this around 
because I was afread they would Nerf it. It does go in the Range slot though 
&amp; that 3 AC is nice for lower level Players. I was the first one that I know 
of to figure this out. I went around selling them for 5pp each all night one 
night to newbies. The Resist one how ever, at the time I tried, did not work. 
This was over a month ago so they may have fixed the other one by 
now.</font></div>

  <p><tt>I know that there was some discussion on this back in February, and 2 
  <br>recipes were posted (small protection and small resistance). Were any 
  <br>more discovered?<br><br>Has Verant done anything to fix the equipping 
  problem, or did we just <br>never figure out how to use them properly? I know 
  that race and diety <br>worship was tried and nothing 
  resolved.<br><br><br>-Khazade<br>Dwarf Paladin<br>Master Potter, Blacksmith,
