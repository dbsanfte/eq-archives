<b>Subject:</b> Re: mixing bowls <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2009127027">2 backpacks in the top slots (upper left has my food and water). Sketches and<br/>
Water in the middle two slots. Fill the rest with clay. Make your unfired bowls,<br/>
get your firing sheets. Then you&#39;ll have 4 open spots to put mixing bowls in. If<br/>
you buy 18 sketches and water instead of 20, you&#39;ll have 6 open slots the second<br/>
time on each run-through. I do this in Halas where I don&#39;t have to travel far.<br/>
Unfortunately, the lines are too long to make this profitable anymore. Well,<br/>
compared to anything else anyway =P<br/>

&gt; Ok, I love this list!! I just have one question...<br/>
&gt; I have a 120 currently in pottery and have tried to make mixing bowls. I<br/>
&gt; made them with no problems, but having 7 backpacks on me for materials, when<br/>
&gt; i successfully fired the bowl, it droped to the ground because a container<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t be stored in another container..... now, how in the world are you<br/>
&gt; doing this efficiently? As it is, I have a better/faster time making pie<br/>
&gt; tins..... any help would be greatly appreciated!!<br/>
