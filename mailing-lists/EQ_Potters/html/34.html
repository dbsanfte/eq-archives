<b>Subject:</b> Re: Where can I buy pottery sketches as a Dark Elf? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-313360919">Well.... There is supposedly a merchant in the middle of South Ro that sells<br/>
sketches and sells to evil races.  I haven&#39;t gone there yet because so far I<br/>
have been able to get friends of mine to buy the sketches for my in<br/>
Freeport.   If this merchant does exist I would like to know also and if<br/>
there are any other evil merchants out there who sell sketches I would like<br/>
to know that.<br/>

Are there any evil potters out there that can tell<br/>
me where to find pottery sketches? I have access<br/>
to all other items in Neriak but unless I missed<br/>
it, none of the evil cities have the sketches.</div>
