<div id="ygrps-yiv-1268680725">&lt;&lt;Remember the good old days back when patches used to help players and fix<br/>
problems instead of cause them?  What ever happened to those days? =)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
From what i understand, and guesses that i&#39;m making based on the REST of the<br/>
patch, there seems to be one way for the Potter to still make a profit:<br/>
<br/>
Befriend a Rogue.<br/>
<br/>
Seems that one of the new sketches we get are Vials, which i would suspect are<br/>
necessary for Rogues to make and apply poison.<br/>
<br/>
Well, they wanted it that you need another player to make a profit; there&#39;s the<br/>
only thing *i* can see that is our saving grace.<br/>
