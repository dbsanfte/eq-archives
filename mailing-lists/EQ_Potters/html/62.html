<div id="ygrps-yiv-1180480634">My main stay is the pie-tin.  It sells for 5.6 gp.  My Bard buddy sells the <br/>
same for 6.2 gp, but his Cha is much higer than mine.  I have a question.  <br/>
My skill is currently stalled at 114.  What do any of ya&#39;ll suggest as a <br/>
reasonably cost efficient item to make that will still provide skill <br/>
increases?<br/>
<br/>

&lt;&lt;Also..what the most lucrative potter product??&gt;&gt;</div>
