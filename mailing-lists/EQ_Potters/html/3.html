<b>Subject:</b> Pottery Wheel & Kiln found - Repost <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1416585144">Howdy to all my friends over at the Pub <br/>
<br/>
It seems that Pottery is a prerequist to being a successful chef.  <br/>
I have acquired clay supplies and picked up a simple bowl sketch<br/>
in Freeport, as Cleric Taven.   My frustration, was not from trying <br/>
to find a Kiln, there are plenty around, but I had no clue what <br/>
a pottery wheel looked like.   Clay Merchant is in the East Commons<br/>
beyond the first set of Huts.  Look for the INN on the right.<br/>
<br/>
My goal is to make skewers for Rat kabobs and some Soups.<br/>
<br/>
For making Rat sandwich and &#39;sushi&#39; rolls with Fish & Bat Wings, <br/>
a Mixing bowl is the only component required.   <br/>
I would say a very handy item for living off of Roadkill.<br/>
<br/>
I realize with blacksmithing, skewers can be pounded out, <br/>
but there are more pottery items needed in baking, <br/>
may as well increase pottery skill.    <br/>
<br/>
Eventually, I see a return of investment marketing <br/>
the handmade wares and tasty treats.  We&#39;ve discussed about <br/>
the poor return from resale of brewed items on EQ_Brewers.  <br/>
Bascially, existing merchants will buy them for less then <br/>
the cost of the combined ingredients and each Tavern<br/>
sells finish product.  <br/>
We are still trying to find more potent recipes.<br/>
Stop by the Pub and pick up Jaxe&#39;s fine newsletter.<br/>
<br/>
Now -try to find any finished pottery items, nada.   <br/>
Brewmeisters maybe folks won&#39;t buy your homemade <br/>
Mead alone, but add in a muffin pan or pie tin and up the <br/>
cost to cover and still make a profit!   <br/>
If you would rather smith, sell skewers & brewsky.<br/>
<br/>
While playing a new Dwarf on Test, I stumbled upon <br/>
both kiln and wheel next to each other!<br/>
<br/>
Wannabe Bakers - Consider joining EQ_Pottery and <br/>
for those interested, go check the files section for a screen <br/>
shot, this should help everyone.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t thrown any clay bowls yet, but time for that later.<br/>
I have seen only a couple of messages from EQ_Pottery.<br/>
<br/>
I am still looking for both Pot sketch and &quot;Mixing Bowl&quot;. <br/>
Any location help, drop me or the the list a note please. <br/>
<br/>
I can pick up other various bowl size sketches in Freeport,<br/>
but needing Two Large blocks of clay is more than any of <br/>
the other bowls available from the ladies in North Market <br/>
Square.<br/>
<br/>
With the www.gameguides.com unOfficial Everquest guide<br/>
in hand, bowls come in different sizes and require different<br/>
amounts of clay and quality of firing sheets.  It might appear<br/>
for some a spoiler and shameless plug, but it has been <br/>
a valuable tome.<br/>
