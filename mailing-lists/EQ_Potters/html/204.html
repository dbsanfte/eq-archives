<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1815772182">If you didn&#39;t already do it, it is too late.  You had to buy your stuff<br/>
before hand.  I had some tins that I stockpiled so that I could pot after<br/>
the patch.  But the profit margin is much better on just the tins.<br/>
<br/>
I seriously doubt it is a bannable offense.  If they would have not changed<br/>
the sell back cost of the sketches (it is able to be set by Verant), I would<br/>
have still been a happy camper making my tins.  But as it is I made a nice<br/>
total (wasn&#39;t full of sketches, but had several).  It isn&#39;t an exploit as<br/>
Verant changed the game.  About 2 months ago they changed what DVinn<br/>
dropped.  It went from a throw away dagger to one that is highly sought<br/>
after and sold for over 100 plat the next day (now down to 30 or so on my<br/>
server.)  But if you had the dagger on you during the patch, your net worth<br/>
increased dramatically.  It isn&#39;t a bug, and had Verant not changed their<br/>
game, the kind of money wouldn&#39;t have been generated.  Considering the<br/>
language that we have to agree to before entering the game, anybody could be<br/>
banned for any kind of behavior that annoys Verant.  As long as we aren&#39;t<br/>
all going around saying what we did and how much we made, there should be no<br/>
problem.  Where problems take place is when people are so giddy that they<br/>
can&#39;t keep their mouths shut.  Had Verrant not mentioned it before they<br/>
nerfed it, it wouldn&#39;t have happened.  That is what happened to Brewing.  It<br/>
was profitable, but then it wasn&#39;t after the last patch, but there was never<br/>
anything mentioned about it before or after.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I never saw the new sketches in Freeport.  I do not know about anywhere<br/>
else.<br/>
