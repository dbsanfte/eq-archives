<br/>
I dropped in there on Thursday night, and Aradune (Brad) was there.  Someone<br/>
asked<br/>
something like &quot;What can you do in the game to make money?&quot;  and some idiot<br/>
replied<br/>
to him &quot;I make 80p per day with pottery&quot;.  A few moments later Aradune said<br/>
&quot;80p per day???&quot;.<br/>
After that nothing more about pottery was said.<br/>
<br/>
And now we have the patch, cuz some idiot couldn&#39;t keep his trap shut.  The<br/>
link between<br/>
this incident and the patch is quite clear.</div>
