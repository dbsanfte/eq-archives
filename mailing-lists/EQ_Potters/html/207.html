<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-114097905"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Verant specifically lists buying an item from a<br/>
&gt; vendor and selling it back at a higher price as<br/>
&gt; a bannable offense.  I didn&#39;t want to take the<br/>
&gt; chance.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It could be,  but not in this case.  I tried to buy a pie sketch and it<br/>
cost me 1100cp to do so.  So I just sold the ones I had stored up.<br/>
<br/>
The profit from doing this is not bannable BECAUSE they cannot trace<br/>
exactly when you purchased the sketch.<br/>
<br/>
Second they made the pricing change,  well warned of the consequences<br/>
yet the anti-player bigots at Verant went ahead anyway with their price<br/>
change (if they wanted to do it right - nerf the resale price of tins)<br/>
<br/>
Ban me?  Quiting is a more likely end result for me,  after all I had<br/>
only about 30 minutes during weekdays to play EQ and pottery/smithing<br/>
were a good waste for those 30 minutes.</div>
