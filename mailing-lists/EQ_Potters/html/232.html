<div id="ygrps-yiv-696051576">Well, boys and girls I have the Vial formula.... I will announce this to the<br/>
board shortly however I would like to get the formula to a Small Diety<br/>
sketch as a trade, so if anyone has it please e-mail me or reply to this<br/>
group.<br/>
<br/>
The Poison Vial when completely made is::::<br/>
<br/>
Stackable<br/>
costs 4g 5s to make<br/>
sells for 5g 2s to NPC&#39;s<br/>
needs a high pottery skill  (mine was 129 and it went up when i was making<br/>
the vials)<br/>
the recipe uses 4 of the wheel slots.....Clay water sketch and the mystery<br/>
component ;)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As I said i&#39;ll give the whole thing prob on Sat or Sun but I wanted to give<br/>
a heads up in advance to anyone who has the Small Diety Formula..<br/>
<br/>
