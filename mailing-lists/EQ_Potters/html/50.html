<b>Subject:</b> Raw deal - need help! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1995371731">I feel as though I&#39;m getting the raw end of the deal from Verant. I lost 10 <br/>
P and an Opalline earring (paid 25 P for it) off an alt character, due to <br/>
yet another bug/glitch with the boat. I&#39;ve done everything I can possibly <br/>
think of, (/tell, /shout, /petition, /bug, /feedback, and email directly to <br/>
a GM at the suggestion of a Guide) to get this equipment restored. And I&#39;ve <br/>
done them all numerous times and still nothing!<br/>
<br/>
One Guide told me that a request to have my equipment restored had been <br/>
forwarded, and that it would take 2 days at most to get it restored (now <br/>
going onto day 4); quite truthfully, I&#39;m more upset at losing the opalline <br/>
earring than any of the other gear (it being the hardest and most expensive <br/>
to replace); and still nothing has been said or done about it - no email, no <br/>
/tell&#39;s, no nothing in any way shape or form to explain what the holdup is.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, all I keep getting from most of the Guides about anything, is that <br/>
&quot;I&#39;m too busy right now. Please /petition it.&quot; If I petition one more time <br/>
and get no response, I&#39;m going to scream! As a matter of fact, I still have <br/>
a petition in queue right now in the queue of my primary character and the <br/>
alt that lost the equipment, and guess what, it&#39;s still not answered!<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;d like, is for any Verant employee/cohort to sit up and take notice, <br/>
or for anyone who has an idea about how to get this situation taken care of <br/>
to submit their suggestions via post or email, so that I can get this <br/>
straightened out once and for all!!! I&#39;m sick to death of hearing &quot;I&#39;m too <br/>
busy&quot; or &quot;It&#39;s not our policy&quot; or &quot;Sorry. It&#39;s against policy to do that&quot;. <br/>
I&#39;ve done everything I can short of calling Verant&#39;s support hotline, like <br/>
I&#39;m supposed to! Are you GM&#39;s and Guides there just to create lag? Or for <br/>
once will you do what it is that you&#39;re s there to do? Customer support! <br/>
****(I&#39;m not holding my breath!!!!!!!!!!!)****</div>
