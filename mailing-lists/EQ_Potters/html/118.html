Heard Brewing was nerfed, is pottery still profitable as of this morning?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The word on my Ranger list is that Pottery was screwed as well.  The last time i<br/>
was potting was about 3pm (EST) Tuesday, and the profit margin was still the<br/>
same.  However, the word was around the potters in Bertoxx in Kelethin (we all<br/>
know each other, lines at the wheel), was that we were going down tonight.<br/>
<br/>
How stupid.  It seems they are forcing you to be a &quot;/auction i am the 10000th<br/>
person selling jewelry&quot; kind of trader if you want to make a profit.  I find<br/>
pottery nice and relaxing, and a welcome change.  No reason to do it if i&#39;m not<br/>
going to make at least some money, however.<br/>
