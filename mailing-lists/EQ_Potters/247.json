I had hoped, with the introduction of vials, pottery would become a money maker again.  Last night I made my first vial at a cost of about 570 with a sell back price of 465.  I thought that would be ok, if I could sell them to rogues for 1-2 plat.  \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe difficulty with this is two fold.  One, you need a pelt.  There just isn&#39;t a reasonable source for these things in one place - you have to deal with low level plays who are collecting them, which greatly slows down the process.   Two, if the price of the vial is too high, I thought the rogues might take up pottery themselves, putting me out of business.  I thought we were safe from this because it would cost too much to get up to mastery now.  \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe attachment below explains how one rogue mastered pottery in a couple hours with an investment of 17pp!  Well, that&#39;s it.  If I have to buy from players, sell to players, and (in competitive analysis terms) the barriers to entry into the trade are low, it&#39;s a bum business.  I can&#39;t understand how with 17 pp you can master a trade when with fletching it costs me that much to go from 104 to 108!  \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThese trades are screwed up in a major way!  I think I&#39;ll use up the 1000 pie tin sketches I have left and hang up my potter&#39;s apron.  Thanks for listening.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nRamalama - Master Fletcher and Potter, Mithanial Marr\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe rogue post follows . . .\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nFrom: dp &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:agra@...\">agra@...</a>&gt;\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWell, in case anyone missed it, poisoning has been added to the game.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe trick is, the components are pretty hard to find.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nRegardless, here is my experience.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI&#39;m a 25 gnome rogue, with lots of faction (from quests) in halas, currently.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nTo make poison, you need poison components (they vary) suspension (a base\r<br/>\ngel-like fluid) a vial (either regular or lined) and a mortar and pestle.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nOnce you get a vial of poison, it apparently has 10 applications if you are\r<br/>\nsuccessfull, and one if you aren&#39;t. (yes, that sucks, i agree).\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSo, in less than 2 hours, with 100INT and 17plat, I went from 0 in pottery\r<br/>\nup to 104.  Why pottery you ask?  because this is what is needed to make\r<br/>\nvials.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSo, I made small jars up to 40, then medium bowls up to 104.  After that I\r<br/>\nswitched to regular vials, and they have taken me to 125.  In any case,\r<br/>\nhere&#39;s some component pricing for vials and pottery;\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n2g5s5c - polar bear skin from vendor\r<br/>\n1s3c - flask of water\r<br/>\n3g8s2c - vial sketch\r<br/>\n5s1c - Hight Quality firing sheet\r<br/>\n1s9c - small block of clay\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nif you were one hundred percent successfull you would consume all those\r<br/>\nresources every time you made a vial.  So that puts the cost to 5g20s20c or\r<br/>\n7g2s.  If someone sells you a vial for more than that, they are making a\r<br/>\nprofit.  I was offered vials last night for one plat each.  that&#39;s not a\r<br/>\nbad price, EXCEPT that I can get my own skins from wolves and bears, so the\r<br/>\ncost is reduced to 5g and change, so they&#39;re making good money if all they\r<br/>\ndo is pottery and sell poison vials for one plat.  Nevertheless, this will\r<br/>\nlikely stimulate the lowbies to make alot of vials.  I now have 40 vials in\r<br/>\nthe bank, and some suspension, but no poison-bearing components.\r<br/>\n(ichor/bile/sacs/etc)\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWhat follows is the full text of the book for poisoning:\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER\r<br/>\nSPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER\r<br/>\nSPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER\r<br/>\nSPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER\r<br/>\nSPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER\r<br/>\nSPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER\r<br/>\nSPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER\r<br/>\nSPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER\r<br/>\nSPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER\r<br/>\nSPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER\r<br/>\nSPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER\r<br/>\nSPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER\r<br/>\nSPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER\r<br/>\nSPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER\r<br/>\nSPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER\r<br/>\nSPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER\r<br/>\nSPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER\r<br/>\nSPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER\r<br/>\nSPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER\r<br/>\nSPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER\r<br/>\nSPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER\r<br/>\nSPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER\r<br/>\nSPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER\r<br/>\nSPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER\r<br/>\nSPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER\r<br/>\nSPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER\r<br/>\nSPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br/>\nVidlos,\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAs promised I acquired the information you wanted.  I am hated in my own\r<br/>\nland now and you will compensate me for it.  The information is as follows:\r<br/>\nThere are many poisons that do not need to be made.  Examples are the Vial\r<br/>\nof Rabid Froth and the CrookStinger Poison.  To make poisons use the mortar\r<br/>\nand pestle.

There you have it folks.\r<br/>\n I don&#39;t imagine this is TOO much of a spoiler, actually, as the book is\r<br/>\nonly 2 plat and change, and is easily read by anyone who knows thieves\r<br/>\ncant.  The really wierd thing is that there are only TWO poisons in the\r<br/>\nbook that use normal vials.  The rest use lined vials.  This means you must\r<br/>\nbe a master potter (like 150+ skill) to effectively become a stand-alone\r<br/>\npoisoner.  Ah well, I will enjoy trying out my new skill today.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIt seems that poisoning is centered either in freeport (for the desert) and\r<br/>\nhalas (for the snow)  I don&#39;t know anything about the fire..\r<br/>\n(neriak/lavastorm?)\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\ndp</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
