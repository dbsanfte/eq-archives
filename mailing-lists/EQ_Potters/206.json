I bought all my poor encumbered wood\r<br/>\nelf could hold (and would fit in the bank) thinking \r<br/>\n I would simply make pie\r<br/>\ntins after the patch.  Well, I found I had enough \r<br/>\nspace to carry some water, two lumps of clay and \r<br/>\na firing sheet, just enough to see if they still\r<br/>\nworked.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI decided to sell several of the backpacks full\r<br/>\nat auction.  This was easy and I got 40pp per\r<br/>\nbackpack full.  It was fun answering the jerks \r<br/>\nthat yelled &quot;Rip-off!  They sell for 1s each!&quot;  \r<br/>\nI have begun making pie tins \r<br/>\nwith the remainder, and expect to spend a very\r<br/>\nlong time at the wheel\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nVerant specifically lists buying an item from a \r<br/>\nvendor and selling it back at a higher price as\r<br/>\na bannable offense.
