The most profitable<br/>\nseems to be a close race between cooking and potting. Cooking returns 2.5 times<br/>\nwhat you put in if you&#39;re making fish fillets at 100% success (not too tough,<br/>\nthey are trivial at 82). So, sinking 20 plat into fish fillets makes you quite<br/>\nthe little bundle of plat :) Problem being it takes a LONG time to combine that<br/>\nmany items. We&#39;re talking 4 silver per try, selling for 1 gold each success :)<br/>\nNow, potting returns 4 times as much when you make mixing bowls. Spend approx. 2<br/>\ngold to make one, returns over 8 gold. Problem is there is a LOT more running<br/>\naround than in cooking, the best potting places are always crowded (2 or 3<br/>\npeople waiting to use the wheel), and anywhere else requires so much zoning it&#39;s<br/>\nentirely impractical. So, even though you get a better return rate and it&#39;s<br/>\ntechnically faster, you wind up taking about as long as cooking depending on the<br/>\nwait times. Given no wait times, you would surely be making more than in<br/>\ncooking.<br/>\n<br/>\nFish fillets triv out at 82<br/>\nMixing bowls (I hear) triv out at 128.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy cooking is 82 (haven&#39;t started on fish rolls... been potting =P) and my<br/>\npotting is 148 (from large bowls). Hope this helps you decide :)<br/>\n-Rennin of E&#39;Ci<br/>\nTrade Council GM<br/>\n<br/>\nkale usi wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: kale usi &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kaleusi@...\">kaleusi@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: Nick Emmerich &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:seorin@...\">seorin@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I&#39;m out here :) Guess us potters aren&#39;t too popular, but we&#39;re the ones<br/>\n&gt; &gt;that<br/>\n&gt; &gt;get the money =P You should see the EQBrewers list... they&#39;re excited about<br/>\n&gt; &gt;new items (understandable) and are hoping to make more than 30 plat an hour<br/>\n&gt; &gt;with it.
