Now my question is will this pie tin be considered version 1? or<br/>\nversion 2?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it is considered version 1, then we have made a boat load of cash,<br/>\notherwise we should still be able to make some cash from makeing the pie<br/>\ntins, unless they raise the price of clay and firing sheets also, didn&#39;t<br/>\ncheck that when i was looged into the test server. Will try to check other<br/>\nones later.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mon, 26 Jul 1999 <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Droch220@...\">Droch220@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Droch220@...\">Droch220@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 7/26/1999 7:35:19 AM Central Daylight Time, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:love@...\">love@...</a> <br/>\n&gt; writes:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; That is 128 available slots to fill with stacks of 20 sketches<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  for a total of 2560 sketches each with a 5G profit.
