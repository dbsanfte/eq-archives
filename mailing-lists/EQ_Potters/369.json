","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-37183699\">I haven&#39;t seen a wish list in a while so here are mine.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;disclaimer: I am not a potter. I was considering it once and this list has<br/>\nso little traffic I never unsubscribed&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSome sort of clay pot as a requirement for some alchemy.<br/>\n<br/>\nMolotov cocktail: requires clay pot, fire water, vodka. One charge of<br/>\narea-of-effect fire.<br/>\n<br/>\nPortable still. Lets you brew on the road. Kind of like the spit for baking.<br/>\nAny time you use the still there is a 1% chance it breaks.<br/>\n<br/>\nclay bulb arrow tip. Filled with magical powder lets fletchers make a few<br/>\nnew kinds of arrows. Blindness, snare, and some small debuff would work<br/>\nwell.<br/>\n<br/>\nclay golem. 1st level pet. I think Verant has reasons for not wanting pets<br/>\nuseable by everyone (hence they removed clockwork pets) but I still think<br/>\nits a worthy idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nsoul protector. Very expensive. Maybe needs to be enchanted by a high level<br/>\nenchanter or necromancer. One charge of &quot;soul protection&quot; which lasts for<br/>\nmaybe an hour real time. When you die while under the effect of Soul<br/>\nProtection you don&#39;t lose any experience. I know this really isn&#39;t feasible<br/>\nbut I can dream.<br/>\n<br/>\ncaltrops. essentially an area-of-effect snare.<br/>\n<br/>\nclay mask. When worn makes your faction indifferent with some groups (maybe<br/>\nall merchants, or human merchants, or MerchantsOfQeynos).<br/>\n<br/>\nceremonial armor. No AC bonus but looks cool. Available in different<br/>\ncolors - bronze, steel. Might be limited to non-planes armor that already<br/>\nexists. Would be perfect for those special events when you want to look<br/>\ngood, and not your silly piecemeal self.<br/>\n<br/>\nblank tablets of scripture. Can only be used by a cleric. When used, the<br/>\ncleric loses 1% of his experience and gets an item called &quot;tablets of<br/>\nscripture&quot;. It can only be used by someone of lower level of the same faith.<br/>\nUsing it boosts that persons experience by 1%. So if a 32nd level cleric of<br/>\nTunare used it he would get a &quot;tablets of Tunare XXXI&quot;. Clerics would make a<br/>\nfortune from twinkers, especially once they hit 60th level and didn&#39;t have<br/>\nanything better to do with their xp.<br/>\n<br/>\nOK, back to work.<br/>\n<br/>\nRudo the cleric (what a surprise!)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
