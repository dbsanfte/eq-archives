I&#39;d grab about 20<br/>\nsketches and 20 flasks of water, and get 40 blocks of clay and start working<br/>\nat the wheel. After I finished I ran to get firing sheets so I could take<br/>\nthem to the kiln. I didn&#39;t make much money off of this, but my skill flew up<br/>\nquick and stopped at 40 something.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext I switched to Pie Tins. Same deal as before. 2 Blocks, a sketch, and a<br/>\nflask of water. The money I make off of this one is amazing though. It costs<br/>\nme the following amount to make them:<br/>\n<br/>\n2 blocks of clay:   9 silver<br/>\n1 Sketch          :   1 silver<br/>\n1 flask              :   1 silver<br/>\n<br/>\nThat gives me my unfired tin<br/>\n<br/>\n1 high quality sheet   : 4 silver 5 copper<br/>\n<br/>\nTotal of: around 1.5gp to make<br/>\n<br/>\nI sell them for 6.15gp<br/>\n<br/>\nI can do a batch in about 15 minutes, and I usually make about 7-10 plat a<br/>\nbatch.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Pie Tin skill has gotten me up to 118 where I stopped tonight.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few other notes...<br/>\n<br/>\nA.) In my opinion Halas is by far the best place to take up pottery. It has<br/>\neverything, and I mean everything you need, and did I mention that the<br/>\nbuildings (Save for the merchant by the dock that sells the sketches) are<br/>\nright next to each other?<br/>\n<br/>\nB.) When I first started I tried to use summoned water, and (duh!) you<br/>\ncan&#39;t. Summoned water is called &#39;Water Globes&#39;, and the book specifically<br/>\nasks for Water Flasks...AKA the bought kind. =)<br/>\n<br/>\nC.) The other thing that confused me is that damn conversion chart. Don&#39;t<br/>\neven look at it. Every time I do it confuses me again. Just read what the<br/>\npottery book says a specific item needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nFalgaar<br/>\nBarbarian Shaman on Mithaniel Marr<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Erick Wingate &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:andorallen@...\">andorallen@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Potters@onelist.com\">EQ_Potters@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, July 08, 1999 8:36 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ_Potters] Digest Number 20<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Erick Wingate&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:andorallen@...\">andorallen@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am new to the mailing list and new to pottery. I spent many, many hours<br/>\n&gt; trying our pottery as well as many plats. I still have yet to learn how to<br/>\n&gt; make it profitable. It was somewhat fun at first, but I rapidly grew<br/>\n&gt; frustrated. I have a few questions that I hope someone could help me with,<br/>\n&gt; as I sense that pottery can be both fun and profitable.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1. Where is a good pottery guide?<br/>\n&gt; 2. What is the most profitable item to make.<br/>\n&gt; 3. Is the bowl sketch the same as the mixing bowl sketch? I tried it with<br/>\n&gt; the mixing bowl recipe<br/>\n&gt;     and got the, &quot;Thes items don&#39;t combine to make anything.&quot; message.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; Erick<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Attention ONElist list owners.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; We&#39;ve just added a &quot;NO ATTACHMENTS&quot; option.
