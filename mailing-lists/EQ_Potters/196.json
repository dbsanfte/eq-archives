Give a before and after<br/>\n&gt; please<br/>\n&gt; How much has the sell back value of sketches been altered?  Once again<br/>\n&gt; before and after<br/>\n&gt; Has the success rate been modified any?<br/>\n&gt; Has the sale prices of finished products been altered?<br/>\n&gt; Has there been any versioning of the sketches?  Meaning do the old sketches<br/>\n&gt; sell for one price (back to merchants) and the new ones sell for a higher<br/>\n&gt; price.<br/>\n&gt; Are there any new sketches and additions to the pottery books?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; dwh<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ONElist users:  YOU can win a $100 gift certificate to Amazon.com.<br/>\n&gt; Check out the FRIENDS & FAMILY program to find out how.<br/>\n&gt; For details, go to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html\">http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
