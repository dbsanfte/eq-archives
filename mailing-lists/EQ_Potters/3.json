My frustration, was not from trying <br/>\nto find a Kiln, there are plenty around, but I had no clue what <br/>\na pottery wheel looked like.   Clay Merchant is in the East Commons<br/>\nbeyond the first set of Huts.  Look for the INN on the right.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy goal is to make skewers for Rat kabobs and some Soups.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor making Rat sandwich and &#39;sushi&#39; rolls with Fish & Bat Wings, <br/>\na Mixing bowl is the only component required.   <br/>\nI would say a very handy item for living off of Roadkill.<br/>\n<br/>\nI realize with blacksmithing, skewers can be pounded out, <br/>\nbut there are more pottery items needed in baking, <br/>\nmay as well increase pottery skill.    <br/>\n<br/>\nEventually, I see a return of investment marketing <br/>\nthe handmade wares and tasty treats.  We&#39;ve discussed about <br/>\nthe poor return from resale of brewed items on EQ_Brewers.  <br/>\nBascially, existing merchants will buy them for less then <br/>\nthe cost of the combined ingredients and each Tavern<br/>\nsells finish product.  <br/>\nWe are still trying to find more potent recipes.<br/>\nStop by the Pub and pick up Jaxe&#39;s fine newsletter.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow -try to find any finished pottery items, nada.   <br/>\nBrewmeisters maybe folks won&#39;t buy your homemade <br/>\nMead alone, but add in a muffin pan or pie tin and up the <br/>\ncost to cover and still make a profit!   <br/>\nIf you would rather smith, sell skewers & brewsky.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile playing a new Dwarf on Test, I stumbled upon <br/>\nboth kiln and wheel next to each other!<br/>\n<br/>\nWannabe Bakers - Consider joining EQ_Pottery and <br/>\nfor those interested, go check the files section for a screen <br/>\nshot, this should help everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t thrown any clay bowls yet, but time for that later.<br/>\nI have seen only a couple of messages from EQ_Pottery.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am still looking for both Pot sketch and &quot;Mixing Bowl&quot;. <br/>\nAny location help, drop me or the the list a note please. <br/>\n<br/>\nI can pick up other various bowl size sketches in Freeport,<br/>\nbut needing Two Large blocks of clay is more than any of <br/>\nthe other bowls available from the ladies in North Market <br/>\nSquare.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith the www.gameguides.com unOfficial Everquest guide<br/>\nin hand, bowls come in different sizes and require different<br/>\namounts of clay and quality of firing sheets.  It might appear<br/>\nfor some a spoiler and shameless plug, but it has been <br/>\na valuable tome.<br/>\n<br/>\nCleric Taven (Veeshan)<br/>\nPaladin Nevat (Test)<br/>\nSK Maxilar (Test)<br/>\nRouge Freelag (Test)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
