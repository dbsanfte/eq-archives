I was reading about them on the eqvault trade board and it<br/>\n&gt; seems that several people have found weapon sketches for pottery that were<br/>\n&gt; implemented with the new pottery changes.  From what I&#39;ve heard, they were<br/>\n&gt; found on an npc on a remote island in the Ocean of Tears.  Seems there are a<br/>\n&gt; good variety of different sketchs...all weapons.  Nobody that i know of has<br/>\n&gt; successfully made the items that the sketches fashion yet, because the<br/>\n&gt; materials are unknown as of yet.  It is also not known whether they actually<br/>\n&gt; make weapons themselves or that they make molds that can then be used for<br/>\n&gt; blacksmithing (which seems more likely of the two).  I&#39;d love to hear any<br/>\n&gt; additional information anyone may have!  This could be a breakthrough for us<br/>\n&gt; potters =)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ---- Greiger Matheson<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; How do you enter ONElistï¿½s WEEKLY DRAWING for $100?<br/>\n&gt; By joining the FRIENDS & FAMILY program.
