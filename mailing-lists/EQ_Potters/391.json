I accidentally ran the attached file, which had a .scr<br/>\nextension. It popped up an error box that didn&#39;t look right so caused me<br/>\nsome concern. I checked the file name with the McAfee site but didn&#39;t find<br/>\nanything.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis morning I installed a new virus scanner and found 2 different viruses.<br/>\nI am told that both are forms of Back Orafice. The scanning software is<br/>\ncalled Command Antivirus. My system works after removing the infected files,<br/>\nbut I plan to update my operating system, just in case.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis virus waits until the next time your system is rebooted and then mails<br/>\nitself to everyone in your address book. Back Orafice is a nasty trojan that<br/>\neffectively allows other people to control your computer remotely. If you<br/>\nhave received any odd email from me in the last month I heartily recommend<br/>\nthat you scan your system and apologize if I caused anyone to be infected.<br/>\n<br/>\nDave</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
