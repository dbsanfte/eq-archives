I was able to buy a Dragoon Dirk, a<br/>\nGossimer Robe, and all of my spells to date via pottery. I am level 17 now,<br/>\nso the money is rolling in good enough from loot that I can almost afford to<br/>\ngive up pottery, but still - it was nice to be able to make money without<br/>\nrisk.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think we all knew (but didn&#39;t want to accept) that the remainder of trade<br/>\nskills were going to be nerfed when they nerfed brewing. I honestly can&#39;t<br/>\nbelieve that they waited this long....<br/>\n<br/>\nBuying hordes of sketches isn&#39;t going to be the answer either - since they<br/>\nmax you can buy and horde is 80 (if you have 10 position containers in the<br/>\nbank) stacks of 20, how long can that last someone???<br/>\n<br/>\nI think tonight calls for one last &quot;run&quot; on pottery - but I can only imagine<br/>\nhow long the lines are going to be at the wheel...<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Z.M.
