I have <br/>\nmy skill up to almost 100 now and am wondering a couple things:<br/>\nFirst of all, what does the Diety sketch do.<br/>\nSecond, I have seen magical clay statues - how are these made? It HAS to be <br/>\nwith pottery, they are clay. Anyone know about updates for new enchanter <br/>\nspells???<br/>\nThird, How far will pie tins get me? I know that I am making some pretty <br/>\ngood money at it but what can I do to REALLY make money? I hear of people <br/>\nmaking 30+ plat an hour of doing it, but what are you making? Any details <br/>\nwill be appreciated and a list of when things become trivial would help to!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks guys!!!<br/>\nMay pottery live on forever!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
