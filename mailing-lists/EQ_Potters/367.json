I took up pottery before Verant<br/>\nmeddled with the pie tins and made it a loss making<br/>\nmatter.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut now I can make vials, and sell them cheap, like<br/>\n2pp per poison vial, and 3pp per lined vial. I think I<br/>\nhave been staying in Unrest for 6 months straight,<br/>\nwhich practically gives me the advantage of killing<br/>\npestering tormented dead like nobody&#39;s business.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I&#39;d say I have a new incentive for taking pottery.<br/>\nMaking protection deities and laying blessings on<br/>\nfriends and lovers (I am a priestess of the Phoenix<br/>\nand conduct wedding ceremonies). So pottery isn&#39;t all<br/>\nthat bad. It really depends on whether you have a<br/>\nvivid imagination. ^_^<br/>\n<br/>\nAnnabelle Prettily<br/>\nPriestess of the Phoenix<br/>\nPhoenix Dragoons<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From what I&#39;ve found there no market selling pottery<br/>\n&gt; items to any of the<br/>\n&gt; three people above, as anyone can become a master<br/>\n&gt; potter for an outlay of<br/>\n&gt; only 20pp. Hopefully they&#39;ll expand it a little so<br/>\n&gt; that there is a point to<br/>\n&gt; some pottery items besides being used for other<br/>\n&gt; trade skills - if you could<br/>\n&gt; make something that people would actually use,<br/>\n&gt; rather than something they<br/>\n&gt; just use as a component to make something else, then<br/>\n&gt; there would be a<br/>\n&gt; market for it. I&#39;d like to see 10 slot clay jars, so<br/>\n&gt; we could finally stop<br/>\n&gt; those tailors gouging the market for 100-150pp a<br/>\n&gt; backpack :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nSend instant messages & get email alerts with Yahoo!
