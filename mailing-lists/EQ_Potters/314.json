I finally get back to<br/>\nNeriak with visions preparing some pickled gator to let soak for a little<br/>\nwhile..  Put the gator meat and viniger in the oven, and BAM! Items do not<br/>\ncombine !   Same with lizard.<br/>\n<br/>\nTried adding water to the mix, no luck..<br/>\n<br/>\nthe recipe book says to use a jar, but have heard otherwise in the mailing<br/>\nlist, was wondering if they changed this with the new patch?  I didn&#39;t get a<br/>\nchance to actually make a jar to experiment, since Neriak doesn&#39;t have<br/>\nsketches, and didn&#39;t feel like walking to east commons..<br/>\n<br/>\nAny ideas?  I got all this gator meat rotting in the bank, and don&#39;t want to<br/>\nmake steaks from it, since they are trivial..    Not sure if the pickled<br/>\nstuff is or not, but sure sounds tasty.. :)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
