Pot till you drop because it<br/>\nwill be everywhere on Tuesday.  The second thing is the mystical word<br/>\nSPECULATION.  You heard it right just like the big time investors do on TV.<br/>\nWhen you get ready to log off for the last time before the patch fill your<br/>\ninventory with those beautiful sketches that cost a little over a silver.<br/>\nSince you can usually sell items back for about half of the store price and<br/>\nthe store price is now over a plat you should be able to sell each sketch<br/>\nfor about a 5G profit.  Assume that you fill the bank and your personal<br/>\ninventory with sketches.  8 bank slots 8 personal slots each with a<br/>\nbackpack.  That is 128 available slots to fill with stacks of 20 sketches<br/>\nfor a total of 2560 sketches each with a 5G profit.  Surprise, Surprise that<br/>\nis over 1000P in one night with no effort on your part : )  Enjoy it.
