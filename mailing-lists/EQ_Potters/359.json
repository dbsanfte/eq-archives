Regular 1pp-5pp, and Lined<br/>\n2pp-6pp.  It costs around 6gp for Regular & 1pp for Lined to make.  It is<br/>\nreally up to you what you wanna sell them for.  I&#39;ve maxed out this skill so<br/>\nmy prices tend to be on the low side.  And I think the high side is kind of<br/>\nridiculous if you want to keep any customers.  I&#39;ve found about 3 rogues<br/>\nthat I sell to regularly.  When I collect enough zombie skins & think that<br/>\nI&#39;ll make a round of vials I give them a tell and see if they are interested<br/>\nin buying and find out how many & what kind they want.  To find my customers<br/>\nI usually check /w rogue in the zones and ask high level rogues if they are<br/>\ninterested.  The market for vials is so small you&#39;ll be wasting your breath<br/>\nauctioning them over the zones.  Though you may pick up an enchanter or two<br/>\nthat way.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\nTanana - Bristlebane<br/>\nMaster Brewer, Potter, Beggar<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Jeanne Mitchell [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Blossom@...\">Blossom@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: April 19, 2000 4:07 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Potters@egroups.com\">EQ_Potters@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [EQ_Potters] Selling vials <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI am very proud of my little halfling cleric, Feanu.  She&#39;s only lvl 5<br/>\nand her pottery skill is up to 96.  She can make poison vials, and all<br/>\nkinds of cooking equipment.  She has a full stack of poison vials, and<br/>\nno one to give them to.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d like to auction them - what is a reasonable price to ask?  I&#39;m on<br/>\nthe Prexus server.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpeaking of zombie skins - I make regular runs of the markets and<br/>\ncollect quite a lot of skins.  All 3 inns (all vendors) will have zombie<br/>\nskins at various times, the vendors in the tunnel, the Fishing village<br/>\nof NRo, and the Gypsy camp in Oasis (I only do this in daylight running<br/>\nvery fast).  While &quot;shopping&quot; I also pick up specialty meats (gator,<br/>\nwolf, bear, lion) whenever I see them for hubby&#39;s  baker.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your help.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJeanne Mitchell, Austin, TX<br/>\n&quot;You can tell the quality of a person by how<br/>\nthey treat people they don&#39;t need.&quot; My Dad</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
