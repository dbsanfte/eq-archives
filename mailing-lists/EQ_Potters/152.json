I just have one question...<br/>\n&gt; I have a 120 currently in pottery and have tried to make mixing bowls. I<br/>\n&gt; made them with no problems, but having 7 backpacks on me for materials, when<br/>\n&gt; i successfully fired the bowl, it droped to the ground because a container<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t be stored in another container..... now, how in the world are you<br/>\n&gt; doing this efficiently? As it is, I have a better/faster time making pie<br/>\n&gt; tins..... any help would be greatly appreciated!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ONElist now has T-SHIRTS!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Check out homepage for details.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
