They have all the vials and always have the vials<br/>\nevery time I check.  They are cheap and easy to find.  The case with the<br/>\nrogues simply doesn&#39;t exist on my server.  The results of my attempt to sell<br/>\nvials ranged from grim amusement to outright antagonsim.  This could change<br/>\nbut I highly doubt it once the word gets out about the vendors (at least in<br/>\nFreeport marketplace).  I WISH the market for it was on E. Marr but it<br/>\nain&#39;t.  I have also complained bitterly about the vials in Freeport (perhaps<br/>\na market could develop).  The silence has been deafening.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
