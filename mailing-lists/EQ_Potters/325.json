Woohoo!  ^_^<br/>\n<br/>\n     However, I have one question ... has anyone actually gotten the  <br/>\ndeities themselves to work?  See, after handing them out for over an hour to <br/>\nany newbie shaman, druid, or cleric I could find between Qeynos and East <br/>\nKarana, I was informed by a shaman that he couldn&#39;t get it to work.  Not in <br/>\na weapons slot, not in a general slot, no where.  So has anyone found where <br/>\nyou are supposed to put these things?  In a jewelry slot perhaps?  I don&#39;t <br/>\nknow ... that&#39;s what I get for being a ranger and not being able to test my <br/>\nown wares ^_^;;.<br/>\n<br/>\n    But anyway, if anyone can figure out where these puppies are supposed to <br/>\ngo ... or if the item is just broken ... then please, do tell ^_^.<br/>\n<br/>\nKishu Arashi<br/>\n25th cycle Wood Elf Ranger<br/>\nXegony<br/>\n&quot;Hmm, my dolls are defective ... should I hold a recall?&quot;<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
