As you can see, I&#39;ve been spending more time potting<br/>\nthan fighting :-D<br/>\n<br/>\nI like it - it&#39;s fun.  I don&#39;t have any other reason for doing it than<br/>\nthat.  It will never make me money.  Never.  But, I made a dozen poison<br/>\nvials that I keep on me, and when I play, I auction the vials at 1pp<br/>\neach.  I only sold one, but I did sell one.  The 1pp is twice what it<br/>\ncost me to make it, not counting losses from lack of skill.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy skill increases happened fairly rapidly.  I didn&#39;t waste money firing<br/>\nthe medium bowls because you can&#39;t make enough in selling it  to pay for<br/>\nthe firing sheet.<br/>\n<br/>\nRogues aren&#39;t the only ones that need potters.  Enchanters need a vial<br/>\nto make viscous mana for tailors to make Wu&#39;s Fighting Gauntlets.  I<br/>\nhave an ogre friend who is a baker.  I made her a smoker, cookie<br/>\ncutters, skewers and a pie tin.  She has lost these things when she<br/>\ncombined the wrong ingredients, so now I have some extras for her that I<br/>\nkeep in the bank.  I made ceramic liners for a blacksmith who wanted to<br/>\nmake some baking things.  I don&#39;t charge for these things - making them<br/>\nbrought up my skill and it was fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did discover that it&#39;s easier for a potter to make baking items than<br/>\nfor a blacksmith.  And my skill has increased faster than hers, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m going to try to make some idols, but I don&#39;t know what they are good<br/>\nfor.<br/>\nHave fun.  Have lots of fun. :-D<br/>\nFeanu, Prexus<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJeanne Mitchell, Austin, TX<br/>\n&quot;You can tell the quality of a person by how<br/>\nthey treat people they don&#39;t need.&quot; My Dad</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
