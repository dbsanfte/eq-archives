The last time i<br/>\nwas potting was about 3pm (EST) Tuesday, and the profit margin was still the<br/>\nsame.  However, the word was around the potters in Bertoxx in Kelethin (we all<br/>\nknow each other, lines at the wheel), was that we were going down tonight.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow stupid.  It seems they are forcing you to be a &quot;/auction i am the 10000th<br/>\nperson selling jewelry&quot; kind of trader if you want to make a profit.  I find<br/>\npottery nice and relaxing, and a welcome change.
