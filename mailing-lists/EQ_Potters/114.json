Keep your own food and water in the top two slots of<br/>\nthe left backpack. Fill up on large clay. Make as many mixing bowls as you can,<br/>\nstore them all on the left sides with an empty spot to the right of them. Any<br/>\nempty spaces (besides ones to the right of unfired mixing bowls) should be at<br/>\nthe bottom of the right backpack. Go buy sheets until there is a firing sheet<br/>\nopposite every unfired bowl. Go fire 4 bowls, sell, 4 more, sell, 1 more, sell<br/>\n(if 100% success which isn&#39;t too rare). Buy clay, make unfired bowls, buy<br/>\nsheets, make 6 bowls, sell, make 3 more, sell. For me, that gains about 9 plat<br/>\nprofit and that&#39;s with a low charisma and low faction. You can make a lot more<br/>\nas a barbarian shaman with a naturally high charisma (adding cha jewelry and<br/>\nyour cha buff, you&#39;d be rich QUICK!)<br/>\n-Rennin of E&#39;Ci<br/>\n Trade Council GM<br/>\n<br/>\nDennis Chan wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Dennis Chan&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dchan17@...\">dchan17@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; i heard  many ppl talking about making mixing bowl for money.
