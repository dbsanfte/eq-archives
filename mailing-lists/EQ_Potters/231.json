I am looking for the island w/ the<br/>\nmerchant that sells the sketches. I did find one other island near sisters<br/>\nisland (Gornet&#39;s maybe?? the one w/ the Cyclops) with a merchant, but she is<br/>\nthe one selling the summoning spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also stopped at the island on the way back from Kaladim (my map shows it<br/>\nas boring island or something like that. I don&#39;t have the name here at<br/>\nwork), but there weren&#39;t any sketches being sold on that island either.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for Allizwesaur, yes, that&#39;s who I saw, but I have no interest in him,<br/>\nother than not being killed by him ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: kale usi [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kaleusi@...\">kaleusi@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, July 29, 1999 11:02 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Potters@onelist.com\">EQ_Potters@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [EQ_Potters] New Weapon Sketches!<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;kale usi&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kaleusi@...\">kaleusi@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Mitchell Okun&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Mitchell_Okun@...\">Mitchell_Okun@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;About the sketches or the Lizard?  I can tell you that that was the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Allizwesaur, a dinosaur who is the sole resident of that island.
