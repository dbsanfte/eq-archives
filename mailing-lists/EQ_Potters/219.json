I was reading about them on the eqvault trade board and it <br/>\nseems that several people have found weapon sketches for pottery that were <br/>\nimplemented with the new pottery changes.  From what I&#39;ve heard, they were <br/>\nfound on an npc on a remote island in the Ocean of Tears.  Seems there are a <br/>\ngood variety of different sketchs...all weapons.  Nobody that i know of has <br/>\nsuccessfully made the items that the sketches fashion yet, because the <br/>\nmaterials are unknown as of yet.  It is also not known whether they actually <br/>\nmake weapons themselves or that they make molds that can then be used for <br/>\nblacksmithing (which seems more likely of the two).  I&#39;d love to hear any <br/>\nadditional information anyone may have!  This could be a breakthrough for us <br/>\npotters =)<br/>\n<br/>\n---- Greiger Matheson</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
