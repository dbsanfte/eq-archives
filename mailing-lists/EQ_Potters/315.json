I finally get back to<br/>\n&gt; Neriak with visions preparing some pickled gator to let soak for a little<br/>\n&gt; while..  Put the gator meat and viniger in the oven, and BAM! Items do not<br/>\n&gt; combine !   Same with lizard.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Tried adding water to the mix, no luck..<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; the recipe book says to use a jar, but have heard otherwise in the mailing<br/>\n&gt; list, was wondering if they changed this with the new patch?  I didn&#39;t get<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; chance to actually make a jar to experiment, since Neriak doesn&#39;t have<br/>\n&gt; sketches, and didn&#39;t feel like walking to east commons..<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Any ideas?  I got all this gator meat rotting in the bank, and don&#39;t want<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; make steaks from it, since they are trivial..    Not sure if the pickled<br/>\n&gt; stuff is or not, but sure sounds tasty.. :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
