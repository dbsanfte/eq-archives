A friend of mine started from scratch since<br/>\nthe patch and started pottery.  He made master level in about 30 plat.  If<br/>\nyou charge 2p per vial, why would he not just become a potter himself?  I<br/>\nmean, for the cost of 15 vials, he can make his own, never have to auction,<br/>\nnever have a shortage.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is, I consider 2p a perfectly reasonable price considering the<br/>\ncosts of making the vials.  The problem is that EQ trade skills are messed<br/>\nup and this is just another example if it.<br/>\n<br/>\nCedrick</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
