If you read the postings on various sites about the <br/>\nnew eq edition coming out the first quarter of next year its adding swaying <br/>\nleaves(using less pixels!) and tons of other great additions including the <br/>\nnew continent it will be more than enough to match asheron&#39;s call.  The one <br/>\nthing though that I did read about asheron&#39;s call is about discovering new <br/>\nspells( kind of like research but better) and the advantages to keeping the <br/>\nspells secret so there arent a lot of spoilers. That would definately add a <br/>\nnew angle on spell casting in eq if they added something similar to that. <br/>\n<br/>\n~Dracor on Erollisi Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
