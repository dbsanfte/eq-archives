First thing to purchase<br/>\nwas Convoke Shadow, the new pet spell -- imagine my suprise when the<br/>\nfirst pet I summoned coned green to me!!!  What gives, I though pets<br/>\nwere supposed to range 11-13, but my green pet was lvl 8.  Initially I<br/>\nthought it was due to my conjuration skill being low, around 45, but<br/>\nI&#39;ve raised it up to around 65 and still had cast a green one.  I was<br/>\nsucessfull in casting a lvl 12 pet twice and few 10-11, but I&#39;m yet to<br/>\ncast a lvl 13.  Does anyone know if we just get weaker pets at this<br/>\nlevel or what is going on?<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks<br/>\n<br/>\nNoriamus of Povar</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
