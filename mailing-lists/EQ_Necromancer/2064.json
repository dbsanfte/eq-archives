The &quot;volunteer&quot; just inside the gate past the orc camp still scowls at me ready to attack. How many orcs must I annihilate before they view me a little more friendly in there? Is there some kind of shortcut to better faction here?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have spent the bulk of my time in North Ro, Oasis, Befallen, Lavastorm and of course the dark wood outside Neriak. <br/>\n<br/>\nAny help on improving my faction would be appreciated!<br/>\n<br/>\nWyrmy, 18 lvl DE Necro, Bristlebane</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
