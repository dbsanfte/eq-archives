I&#39;m putting it here for other necros to read and<br/>\ncomment on. This post makes me think necros can do fine _if_ they know how<br/>\nto use their spells (the same is true of any casting class).

Shamans have extremely bad DoT compared to the masters<br/>\nof the DoTs, the necromansers.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet&#39;s just look at a few simple DoTs that the necros get.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, the pure damage DoTs. HB and BB falls under this catigory. They are<br/>\nrarely resisted, and have mroe than 2 vs 1 damage vs mana ratio. Yes, DoTs<br/>\ntake time, as a necro we can MAKE that time, while a shaman or druid just<br/>\nkite with SoW. How to make the time you ask? Necros get Fear, a pet, and<br/>\nthe Darkness line of DoTs slows target 50%, and stops them from moving<br/>\nwhen they ahve less than 30% life.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoT ALWAYS do the damage they do, there is NO chance of taking less damage<br/>\nafter it&#39;s cast. DD IS better in terms that you do the damage in 1 sec,<br/>\ninstead of minuts, however DDs can be resisted, or partially resisted.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe main problem with your assumptions is that you are using your<br/>\nexperience playing a Shaman, who is ranked 4th in term so DoT power, to<br/>\ncompared to the Necros, who are ranked #1. The list goes Necro, druid,<br/>\nenchanter, and shamans. Yes,t he shaman DoTs get resisted a lot, but don&#39;t<br/>\nassume the same for other classes.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the necro who started this string, here&#39;s a tip. We necros get then<br/>\nentire line of Fear spells for a reason. And Darkness is MUCH better than<br/>\nHF to use on critters, look up to see why. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne more thing that the DoTs have over DD is that it DOESN&#39;T do the damage<br/>\nup front, therefore the critter will NOT charge after you when you cast.<br/>\nBB does 405 damage, but the critter stays on pet after you cast it. Force<br/>\nShock does 200, yet the critter charges straight at the wizard who casted<br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nDD and DoTs both have pluses and minuses, yet both are incredibly<br/>\npowerful. Learn to use it, then you will see.<br/>\n<br/>\nMortican Soulblighter<br/>\n--------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
