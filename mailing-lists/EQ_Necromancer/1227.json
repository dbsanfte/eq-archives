Feel kinda stupid casting it all<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  time for the last few weeks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; then they took away charm and gave us a worthless spell (screaming<br/>\nterror),<br/>\n&gt; not only is it a &#39;why go to the train when you can bring the train to you&#39;<br/>\n&gt; spell, but it only works indoors!  at least if it worked outdoors, when<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; wipe failed it wouldnt really be as dangerous.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; and what were they thinking when they made voice graft?  i dont think any<br/>\n&gt; class has a more useless spell.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; oh well, thats my rant =)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Also had a general question about experience and which is better to do.<br/>\nIs<br/>\n&gt; &gt;it better to solo a yellow spawn every other time it comes up (lets say<br/>\n&gt; &gt;alternating with an equal level friend) or group with your friend and<br/>\nkill<br/>\n&gt; &gt;each one and split the exp?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; you are better off getting 50% of two kills than 100% of one, there is<br/>\nless<br/>\n&gt; work involved, and more safety.  also, you get some form of grouping<br/>\nbonus.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; belphenor<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Show your ONElist SPIRIT!<br/>\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/tshirt2\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/tshirt2</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt; With a new ONElist SHIRT available through our website.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; This list is basically unmoderated.
