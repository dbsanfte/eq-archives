I did not care<br/>\nfor Lavastorm at all. The Shadowmen there are on top of a hill and you<br/>\nconstantly have to move around to see if any have spawned. Also I know for a<br/>\nfact that the Shadowmen in WC have dropped anything that anyone has ever<br/>\nneeded at some point or another. My observations... All Shadowmen camps vary<br/>\nwith the number of spawns. Sometimes they spawn just 2 or 3, other times a<br/>\nfull camp of 5. The &quot;Clerics&quot; are holding the orbs and constantly heal<br/>\nthemselves if not interrupted. Make sure you have plenty of mana and<br/>\nIntensify / Augment your pet. They either go down real quick or put up a<br/>\nhelluva fight. At lvl 36 or 37 the majority of the Shadowmen can be pulled<br/>\none at a time with a few exceptions. At lvl 25, you will need a FULL group<br/>\nthat knows how to handle themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso at times the WC Shadowmen camped are pretty heavily camped, I have<br/>\nhelped plenty a number of younger Necros by looting them loot corpses of<br/>\nitems that I didn&#39;t need. Maybe if you ask nicely and respectfully, another<br/>\ngroup might do the same for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nManbik Prodo&#39;Lues<br/>\n45th Level Gnome Necromancer (Tunare)<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.
