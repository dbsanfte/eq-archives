I was in Qeynos and<br/>\n  everything there is ready to attack.  I was trying to raise faction, so i<br/>\n  was doing the quest where you give 2 gold to Den Magason by the docks.<br/>\n  After I gave him the money I got some blank scrolls that I didn&#39;t need<br/>\n  because I was only doing the quest for faction.  I had a friend with me that<br/>\n  was hailing him to keep him from wandering away.  My friend said that after<br/>\n  I gave the NPC the 2 gold the first time that I became visible.  I still had<br/>\n  the gather Shadows icon and no one was rushing over to kill me.  Other PC&#39;s<br/>\n  could see me, but the NPC&#39;s couldn&#39;t.  I was able to sit there and give him<br/>\n  enough to get to threateningly before my Invis finally did wear off.  The<br/>\n  odd part was that I did NOT get the warning that I was about to appear and<br/>\n  thus I had no time to run away and I did die.  But the point is that I WAS<br/>\n  able to give gold and receive quest items back while invis.  This was about<br/>\n  1 month ago.  Since I was visible to PC&#39;s and didn&#39;t get a warning, it seems<br/>\n  to me that they intend for you to become visible and because of that, it may<br/>\n  have been fixed in any one of the patches since then.  I will try to do<br/>\n  another quest invis and let you all know if it still works.<br/>\n<br/>\n  -----Original Message-----<br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Aazen1@...\">Aazen1@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Aazen1@...\">Aazen1@...</a>]<br/>\n  Sent: Thursday, November 04, 1999 10:13 PM<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a><br/>\n  Subject: Re: [EQ_Necromancer] Digest Number 173<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Aazen1@...\">Aazen1@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  I think that initiating in a trade will remove your invisibility.But it may<br/>\n  be possible that being invisible will allow you to complete a quest.For<br/>\n  instance, if you have the Hide skill, going hidden will change an NPCs<br/>\n  faction with you to indifferent.Maybe the same works with Invisibility.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sorry if this was sent twice,<br/>\n  Aazen SyVex<br/>\n<br/>\n  In a message dated 11/3/99 4:34:40 AM Pacific Standard Time,<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt; Has anybody else attempted to complete this quest ?<br/>\n   or does anyone have confirmation if quests can be completed<br/>\n   while invis ? pls email me directly as I dont always get the time<br/>\n   to read all this list mails... &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  This list is basically unmoderated.
