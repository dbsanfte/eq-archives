Originally, I ruled<br/>\nout playing evil characters because the group of characters I will be<br/>\nplaying with the most frequently are all good races and entering towns<br/>\nwith them would be impossible. Can a necromancer of a good race enter<br/>\nthe town of other good races without fear of death? If not, it might not<br/>\n<br/>\nbe as bad as I had originally thought to play an evil necromancer,<br/>\nspecifically a dark elf.<br/>\n   What the pros and cons are of playing an erudite necromancer? or a<br/>\ngnomish necromancer? or a dark elf necromancer?<br/>\nI would appreciates anyone&#39;s input on this subject.<br/>\nThanks</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
