I have bought Cavorting Bones(I<br/>\n </span></blockquote>think that is the name of the level 4 pet spell), Clinging Darkness, and<br/>\nLifespike. Are tehre any other spells I should buy at this level. I am not<br/>\ngoing to buy Gate until level 8, because I will not be travelling far until<br/>\nlevel 8(when I get Gather Shadows). At level 8, what spells should I buy?<br/>\nRight now, I am thinking Gather Shadows -&gt; Pet -&gt; Gate -&gt; Ward Undead. Are<br/>\nthere any other spells I should buy at this level? And should I change this<br/>\norder?&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAs has been mentioned, Poison Bolt isn&#39;t too bad. It&#39;s a conjuration spell,<br/>\nwhich is also nice. Do get that Gate spell soon (before level 8) - it&#39;ll<br/>\nsave your but a couple of times. Its usefulness isn&#39;t so much for travel, as<br/>\nit is one of the few spells that can really take you out of trouble. You<br/>\ncan&#39;t outrun any enemies, but if you get attack by a superior enemy let your<br/>\npet attack him to give you some time. Cast Gate, Zone, and you&#39;re safe. Numb<br/>\nthe Dead can be useful - if you&#39;re at a spawning site for undead you can<br/>\ncast this on one undead (like a zombie) and then attack the other, and not<br/>\nhave to worry about two attacking you. Grim Aura helps a bit, and as a rule<br/>\nany enhancement spell is useful. Fear is difficult to use at lower levels,<br/>\nsimply because of its cost. But you can combine it with Poison BOlt and<br/>\nEngulfing Darkness to have your enemy run around while taking damage over<br/>\ntime.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt level 8, if you can afford it get your Pet right away. If not, get Ward<br/>\nUndead first. Those are perhaps the two most important spells there. Gather<br/>\nshadows is nice for travelling, but you can get that later. A warning about<br/>\nWard Undead - when you level up put at least 1 of your skill points into the<br/>\nEvocation spell. Ward Undead is the only Evocation spell you get until level<br/>\n16. Because of this, while your other spell skills are 30-40 points,<br/>\nEvocation is 0. This spell will fizzle out a lot until you can increase that<br/>\nskill. But its worth it. At 8th with some practice, you can take out mummies<br/>\nand zombies with this spell and your pet.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrad Cossette - <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cossettb@...\">cossettb@...</a><br/>\nSabbaoth (Dark Elf Necro 9) - Bertoxxulous<br/>\n&quot;My advice to you is to get married.
