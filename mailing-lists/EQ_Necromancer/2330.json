However, the side<br/>\n&gt; effect of that is that now<br/>\n&gt; you can also use your sword and produce decent<br/>\n&gt; damage with it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In order to be able to use polearm and be able to<br/>\n&gt; switch to sword and board<br/>\n&gt; you need to spec four skills, which spreads can<br/>\n&gt; spread you somewhat thin.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Slash<br/>\n&gt; Polearm<br/>\n&gt; Shield<br/>\n&gt; Parry(and if you use the polearm chances are you&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; want parry)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Eventhough you get LEVEL x 2.0 skill points per<br/>\n&gt; level after level 5, it can<br/>\n&gt; still spread you a little thin in some areas.<br/>\n&gt; Personally, I would suggest<br/>\n&gt; picking a style, sticking with it and then pump the<br/>\n&gt; extra points in the<br/>\n&gt; other areas.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; For those that are not familiar with specialising or<br/>\n&gt; spec&#39;ing in a skill,<br/>\n&gt; what it does is this..<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; After putting raising a spec skill to a certain<br/>\n&gt; level you are given styles<br/>\n&gt; (and in the case of magic users...spells), in<br/>\n&gt; addition to getting combat<br/>\n&gt; styles (they do lots of need things like taunt,<br/>\n&gt; detaunt, bleed which is<br/>\n&gt; kinda like a small dot, etc, etc) increasing a spec<br/>\n&gt; skill such as blades<br/>\n&gt; will increase the minimum damage that you will do,<br/>\n&gt; in addition it also<br/>\n&gt; decreases damage variance on spells. So increasing a<br/>\n&gt; spec line is a good<br/>\n&gt; thing.  As you might imagine there is a LOT more to<br/>\n&gt; this and somethings are<br/>\n&gt; different for different classes in different realms.<br/>\n&gt;  An example would be<br/>\n&gt; the assassin classes. (They are more assassin then<br/>\n&gt; thief, since we can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; really steal ;-) )  You may increase your pierce<br/>\n&gt; skill, which increases the<br/>\n&gt; minimum damage you can do, but you would also<br/>\n&gt; increase your critical strike<br/>\n&gt; skill which would increase the MAX damage you can<br/>\n&gt; do. There are a TON of<br/>\n&gt; things you can do with your character in this game.<br/>\n&gt; While not everything is<br/>\n&gt; totally balanced and its far from perfect, I feel<br/>\n&gt; that its the best system<br/>\n&gt; that I&#39;ve played to date.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Just my two coppers.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Oskar<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Marlon Clark&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:marlonclark@...\">marlonclark@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@yahoogroups.com\">EQ_Necromancer@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Saturday, February 22, 2003 1:55 PM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EQ_Necromancer] just joined<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hi,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I used to play a DE necro to 20 in EQ. Gave it up<br/>\n&gt; very long ago,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; like maybe a year before Luclin came out. I&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; never go back.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Corpse runs? Three day camps to complete a quest?<br/>\n&gt; Not for me.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;d like to 2nd what Howler said about the tanks<br/>\n&gt; in DAoC.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; They are not the primary damage dealers. They are<br/>\n&gt; meant to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; absorb, block, parry damage. They also get a skill<br/>\n&gt; called<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;protect&quot;, which acts as a detaunt on the person<br/>\n&gt; they place it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; on. This keeps the Mobs smacking the guy in plate<br/>\n&gt; armor, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; not the caster or cleric in cloth or chain.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Armsman in Albion do get a polearm ability which<br/>\n&gt; does tremendous<br/>\n&gt; &gt; damage, but I don&#39;t see very many players going<br/>\n&gt; that route<br/>\n&gt; &gt; currently.  Polearms are slow, and you give up<br/>\n&gt; shields to do this.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The thief type classes in DAoC are extremely fun<br/>\n&gt; to play. The<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Infiltrator class in Albion can do quite a bit of<br/>\n&gt; damage. In fact<br/>\n&gt; &gt; so much so, the clerics can have a full time job<br/>\n&gt; keeping them<br/>\n&gt; &gt; alive. I have a 45th level Armsman, and my friend<br/>\n&gt; plays a 49th<br/>\n&gt; &gt; level Inf, so I&#39;ve seen this personally. I can<br/>\n&gt; also put Guard on the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Inf, and block shots on him. This has saved his<br/>\n&gt; butt several times.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Some Infs do spec in Dual Wield, they get several<br/>\n&gt; nice styles from<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the skill.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I haven&#39;t had much fun in RvR, so I&#39;m waiting for<br/>\n&gt; 50th to really<br/>\n&gt; &gt; give it a good try.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Another good site is www.classesofcamelot.com<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Keltan<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 45th armsman, Iseult.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Howler D.

They<br/>\n&gt; &gt; are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not meant to be MEGA damage dealers, they are<br/>\n&gt; meant to<br/>\n&gt; absorb/block/parry<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; damage.  There are other classes that are REALLY<br/>\n&gt; good at laying the<br/>\n&gt; smack<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; down, but at the cost of giving up some<br/>\n&gt; defensive capability.<br/>\n&gt; Beserkers,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mercenaries and Blademasters are REALLY good at<br/>\n&gt; smacking the living tar<br/>\n&gt; &gt; out<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of something, but they also will take more<br/>\n&gt; damage by default.  These<br/>\n&gt; &gt; classes<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; are also known as dual wielding classes. While<br/>\n&gt; other classes like the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nightshade, Infiltrator, Shadowblade, Ranger and<br/>\n&gt; Scout get a form of<br/>\n&gt; dual<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wield, they typically do not spec in it. The<br/>\n&gt; exception being the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Shadowblade<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (I LOVE this class after my bard)  Instead of<br/>\n&gt; getting dual wield,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Shadowblades get a skill called leftaxe or LA<br/>\n&gt; for short. Dual Wield<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (Albion)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and Celtic Dual (Hibernia) work differently than<br/>\n&gt; LA.  Dual wield has a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; chance to trigger, when it does trigger and it<br/>\n&gt; does hit, it hits for max<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; damage. With LA, it swings EVERYTIME, when it<br/>\n&gt; hits it does a percentage<br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the max damage. So while you swing all the time<br/>\n&gt; when you hit its partial<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; damage...which is still VERY good.  Its usually<br/>\n&gt; only a few points off of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; main weapon damage, because I keep it pretty<br/>\n&gt; high.  Midgard is the only<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; realm that gets LA. Shadowblades, and Beserkers<br/>\n&gt; get LA.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; So as you can see it depends on how you wish to<br/>\n&gt; play.  There are other<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tank<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; classes that you should also look at.  I really<br/>\n&gt; like the Midgard Thane.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; thane gets a nice AOE DD spell that smacks big<br/>\n&gt; ole hammers on thy<br/>\n&gt; enemies,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>=== message truncated ===</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
