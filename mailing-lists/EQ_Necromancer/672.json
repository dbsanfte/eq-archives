Lavastorm, where<br/>\n&gt;I am right now requires a bit of a specialized spell list, since all the<br/>\n&gt;mobs resist heat blood consistantly.  I find an engulfing darkness/disease<br/>\n&gt;cloud/poison bolt combo handles them nicely.  I can step in to take the <br/>\n&gt;heat<br/>\n&gt;off my pet if need be.  Also one of the keys to success is <br/>\n&gt;casting/recasting<br/>\n&gt;your pet until you have the highest level skele available to you.  I<br/>\n&gt;generally keep fear mem&#39;d for emergencies as I find gate to be very<br/>\n&gt;unreliable for getting me out of trouble.

Eight spells is just not enough to cover many<br/>\n&gt; &gt; situations, and definitely offers very little flexiblity.  another thing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that would be useful is some sort of &#39;quick spell&#39; slot, where you can<br/>\n&gt;keep<br/>\n&gt; &gt; one spell to cast.  i usually use my top slot for this, where i can <br/>\n&gt;place<br/>\n&gt;a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; spell that i can do without if i need to quickly memorize a different<br/>\n&gt;spell-<br/>\n&gt; &gt; but i would be estatic if we could get to memorize 16 spells.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; while we&#39;ve all heard many tweaks that are far fetched an definitely<br/>\n&gt; &gt; unbalanced, i think this is rather important, and would add a great deal<br/>\n&gt;of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; flexibility to spell casters, especially at higher levels where we get a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; staggering array of various spells.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; belphenor<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;From: &quot;Murphy, Kenneth E.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MurphyK@...\">MurphyK@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Hail fellow necromancers<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;I am lev 14th and already finding it hard to pick exactly which 8 <br/>\n&gt;spells<br/>\n&gt;to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;keep memorized. I currently don&#39;t keep shielding and grim aura <br/>\n&gt;memorized,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;rather I cast and delete them, then repeat later when they wear off.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;When I&#39;m in a large group that is killing fast, I tend to use the low<br/>\n&gt;mana<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;spells like siphon str and disease so I can do this to all MOBS. I like<br/>\n&gt;to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;keep gate memorized for emergencies, my best life suck spell, my ward<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;undead, and my best darkness spell as it slows the MOBs down if they <br/>\n&gt;are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;fleeing or if I need to flee. I also find dark empathy handy to <br/>\n&gt;emergency<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;heal passerby&#39;s that are dying. I make a lot of friends that way. I <br/>\n&gt;also<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;find mend bones quite handy esp when I&#39;m soloing or in a group of 2 <br/>\n&gt;where<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;the other person is a wizard or other spell type. I also like the<br/>\n&gt;vampiric<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;embrace as I can tank at the beginning of a fight longer, back out and<br/>\n&gt;life<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;drain, then tank again. That extra 25 tap 2 or 3 times some fights has<br/>\n&gt;made<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;a big difference a few times.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;So I have at lev 14 something like this memorized.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;1)Best Life Drain<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;2)Vampiric Embrace<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;3)Englufing Darkness<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;4)Heat Blood (or if in lavastorm or big group Disease)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;5)Dark Empathy<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;6)Mend Bones (or if in group with tanks siphon str or posion bolt)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;7)Gate<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;8)Ward Undead<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;I wish I had slots for fear and shadow step but I don&#39;t usually.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;At lev 16 I see a lot of new neat spells. A new DOT. Feign Death. A <br/>\n&gt;spell<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;make you immune to damage for a short time ect. I am at a loss as to <br/>\n&gt;how<br/>\n&gt;to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;fit all the fun spells in. I&#39;m happy in the sence there are so many <br/>\n&gt;cool<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;spells I can sorta mix and match for the situation but its much more<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;difficult living with 8 spells at a time then when I play my lev 17<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;magician. I can mem and forget all my summon spells. My combat ones are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;always less then 8. IE DD, AE, Gate, Damage Shield and I&#39;m about done<br/>\n&gt;with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;important spells.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;I was wanting advice from higher lev necromancers about what spells <br/>\n&gt;they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;tend to load and for what situations.
