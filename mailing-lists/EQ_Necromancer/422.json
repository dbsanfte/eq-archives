There is<br/>\nsupposed to be a City of Necromancers -- it is a _integeral_ part of the<br/>\nstory of Norrat (before the time of us players) -- and, considering that the<br/>\nrace on this island is also going to be an evil race including Necromancer,<br/>\nand they are still in the process of adding this continent, what better<br/>\nplace and time to add the City of Necromancers ?<br/>\n<br/>\n        It is simple to write feedback about this.  During gameplay, simply<br/>\ntype the command /feedback .  Make sure you&#39;re not in an area where you&#39;re<br/>\ngoing to be attacked, and please request that our city be added, and be sure<br/>\nto mention what a prestine opportunity this is to add it!  They&#39;re added<br/>\nbetter graphics -- more colorful, better sprites, animated trees in wind<br/>\n(which was an example) -- the Necromancer city will offer a WONDERFUL<br/>\nopportunity to create and use new sprites!<br/>\n<br/>\n    Thanks folks!<br/>\n~Mysk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
