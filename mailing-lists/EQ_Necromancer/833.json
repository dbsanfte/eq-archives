(that is if you don&#39;t mind pissing off the Indigo Brotherhood)<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso Unrest is really good eps and loot.   At 24th you could get in a party w/ ease.   <br/>\nUnrest can get crowded though.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso if unrest is just packed, try the goblin camp (and roaming goblins) in D. Cauldron just outside unrest.   The Tidal lords are all gonna be good eps for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night on Eci Cobbie (L22 necro human) and I (Gnome Necro L18) and a Cleric held our own in the goblin camp, but it was tough for us at times.   At 24th you and 1 other about your lvl should be ok, but summon your pet for sure.  Cobbie and I both had our pets go for a tidal lord and we&#39;d DoT and melee (Grim Aura, Vampiric Embrace) the others w/ the cleric until we could help our pets.<br/>\n<br/>\nI DoT the Tidal lord too while pets beat on him.  If nothing else it is really fun to kill goblins in large numbers. hehe  I am 1 bubble from 19th now.  I want 20th so bad.  ;-)  <br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.  Most of the goblins we fought were conning red to me.  (all the tidal lords were red)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
