From what he<br/>\ngathered it is based on height and visible area so for<br/>\ninstance in a dungeon you arent going to go to far but<br/>\noutside on a hill you will teleport a greater distance<br/>\nand be careful around water you can teleport<br/>\nunderwater as well. Shadowstep casts very quickly the<br/>\nlittle combo most people do is shadow step - gate<br/>\ncombo if you have enough mana. From my experience with<br/>\nmy Wizard I tried this and its true you go much<br/>\nfurther the higher up you are. But you can&#39;t go up<br/>\nonly down and one guy reported of actually zoning<br/>\nafter a shadowstep. So next time your in a fight with<br/>\na baddie take it to a little hill or mountain and if<br/>\nyou get in trouble do the step gate shuffle.<br/>\n<br/>\nSumelar<br/>\nDark Elf Necromancer<br/>\nVeeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I&#39;ve a question about Shadow Step.  I know it&#39;s a<br/>\n&gt;mini random<br/>\n&gt;teleport,<br/>\n&gt;but.. I have some misgivings about it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  I watched another mage, while invisible, casting<br/>\n&gt;their Shadow Step<br/>\n&gt;outside.  It was sad, they hardly went a few feet<br/>\n&gt;away from their<br/>\n&gt;original<br/>\n&gt;spot, and if they were being attacked, they could<br/>\n&gt;still get hit by<br/>\n&gt;whatever it was from where they went.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Though I guess, in a dungeon, it would be more<br/>\n&gt;helpful, or is that<br/>\n&gt;just<br/>\n&gt;wishful thinking?  Also, how long does it take to<br/>\n&gt;cast?  Faster than<br/>\n&gt;Gate<br/>\n&gt;does, or the same?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    Thanks for the info folks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;~Myskyra / Tunare<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
