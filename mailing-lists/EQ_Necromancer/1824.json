Thats basically<br/>\nNeriak Merchant faction.  Its an easy thing to do if your a Dark elf, as<br/>\nyou can do some of the quests.  Unfortunately I am a gnome (it has its<br/>\nadvantages (non kos in North Freeport)).  However I don&#39;t currently have<br/>\nenough Dark Barginers faction to do quests with them.  I can still buy bank<br/>\nand sell in Neriak but I am trying to get some better pricing.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone know of any Mobs that will provide a positive bonus to Dark<br/>\nBarginers faction?<br/>\n<br/>\nLomack, Knight Defender of the BCK<br/>\nMaster of Recruiting<br/>\nwww.bck.org<br/>\n&quot;The Crimson Knights&quot;<br/>\nFennin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
