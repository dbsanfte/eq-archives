I dont know if its because of all the recent nerfs or what, but my pet is trying to kill me I tell you.  I was in lowerguk camping assasin, when all of a sudden my pet pulls a bunch of green mobs from downstairs.  Not only that, but he starts cackling like a maniac as 4 wan ghoul knights rush up to kill us.  As I try to do some crowd control with screaming terror, my pet stops attacking the one he&#39;s fighting and starts hitting the ST&#39;d one, thus breaking the mez.<br/>\n    -----Original Message-----<br/>\n    From: Dicey &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shonn@...\">shonn@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n    To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n    Date: Thursday, February 24, 2000 1:49 PM<br/>\n    Subject: RE: [EQ_Necromancer] Who is the pet?<br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n    From: &quot;Dicey&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shonn@...\">shonn@...</a>&gt; <br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n    Ever feel like you&#39;re the pet and Gobantik is the real PC.  I mean you pull for Gobantik, you buff Gobantik, you heal Gobantik, you furnish Gobantik with weapons, you make it easy for Gobantik to kill the mob with things like DoT&#39;s and Fear and Root.  Gobantik doesn&#39;t have to waste time running all over Norrath, you carry him safely in your backpack until its time to kill something.
