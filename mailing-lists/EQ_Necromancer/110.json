I am currently playing a gnome magician on<br/>\nmythannial marr named Veneficus and I have reached 15th level so far. I am<br/>\nenjoying my time for the most part. As with any class/race combo there are<br/>\nproblems, but I can mostly live with them. The Olympic jump I need to make<br/>\nto get onto the boat between freeport and butcherblock is a Pain, and not<br/>\nhaving the research components in the game for 24+ level pets is a pain (but<br/>\nby the time I&#39;m there it&#39;ll most likely be fixed). We&#39;ll enough rambling and<br/>\nback to my point.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am thinking of playing a different char to give myself a break from time<br/>\nto time from my main one. I have seriously considered a halfling warrior but<br/>\nI think I&#39;d get board of any warrior type FAST as you just stand there with<br/>\nalmost no strategy involved. The only real classes that seem to be worth a<br/>\nsecond character are druids and necromancers.<br/>\n<br/>\nDruids seem very well rounded and but i&#39;m concerned they will be too<br/>\ncrippled in a dungeon, and I think dungeons can be a blast to fight in. I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t take a Necromancer in the beginning as I was VERY afraid of the KOS<br/>\nin most places. However, now that I have a basic feel for the game I&#39;m not<br/>\nso afraid of that and I&#39;d be a dark elf so my home town will like me. It<br/>\nseems that necromancers fight their own way with their pet so it wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nfeel like my magician feels. Also I&#39;d be tall for a change hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you all think. Are necromancers and magicians soo close together<br/>\nthat I&#39;d feel like I&#39;m playing the same character? Should I thus take the<br/>\ndruid for a different feel? Are they any MAJOR short falls to being a<br/>\nnecromancer due to things in the game still being broken?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems that necromancers are stronger characters then some other classes<br/>\nwith the balance coming in terms of difficulty with faction. Is that true?<br/>\nAlso, what level would I have to take my necromancer too in order to get a<br/>\nfeel for what its like. it was a minimum of 8th better 12th to get a feel<br/>\nfor what a magician is like. <br/>\n<br/>\nAny help is welcome.<br/>\n<br/>\nVeneficus - The Way -<br/>\nMythannial Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n...
