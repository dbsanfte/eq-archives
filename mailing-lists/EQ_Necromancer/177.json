I first cast it, then<br/>\nhit the spell book and begin meditating and memorizing spells.  The mana<br/>\ngoes back up and I find that I can cast other spells such as Dark Eye and<br/>\nGather Shadows and the wait isn&#39;t quite as bad, thus leaving time for the<br/>\nspells to be active during play.<br/>\n<br/>\n    There was a time I was attacked by an Undead while resting and still had<br/>\nmy Dark Pact active.  It seemed to me I got off an extra Ward Undead because<br/>\nof it (an extra 39pts of dam isn&#39;t a bad thing at all), spacing the castings<br/>\na bit further than usual of course.  But then again, if my pet would&#39;ve<br/>\nfallen and I had to go had-to-hand, I&#39;d have been in a worse situation due<br/>\nto less HP.  I think I was almost half-way down..bubble and a half.<br/>\nSomething like that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I am interested in this or other fighting styles?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>    I just do what every other Necromancer does.  Pet tank, Poisen (or other<br/>\nDoT spell), pop off a few other spells maybe (LifeSpike or whatever), take a<br/>\nfew hits & deal my own, etc.  That, or I send the pet in, poisen the<br/>\ncreature, then target my pet and watch its HP&#39;s.  If they get down to almost<br/>\nhalf, I use Mend Bones to heal it (considering that by the time it actually<br/>\ncasts, it usually _is_ down half its HP&#39;s), and the rest of the time I&#39;m<br/>\nmeditating.  The only pain to this is the wondering animals and such.  The<br/>\nones that usually leave you alone see you as an easy target when you&#39;re<br/>\nsitting, and may attack you or your pet.  Mend bones doesn&#39;t cast fast<br/>\nenough to keep up with two, three things pounding on your pet at once for<br/>\n12+pts of dam.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Sincerely a curious young necromancer<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>    That&#39;s why we&#39;re Necromancers. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n~Myskyra / Tunare</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
