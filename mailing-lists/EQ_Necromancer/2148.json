Where in OOT can I find the goblin<br/>\nheadmaster?  Is he soloable at 30?<br/>\n<br/>\nAny thoughts on shadow men?  Do all the items drop randomly off all the<br/>\nshadow men, or are there better places than others to find the shadowed<br/>\nscythe and eye/hand/mask of shadow.  Are there any camps that are<br/>\nsoloable or takable by a pair/trio, or will I need a full group?<br/>\n<br/>\n2) where&#39;s good hunting (and good groups) at L30?  Sarnaks, goblins, and<br/>\nforest giants in Warsliks and Lake of Ill Omen have been great from 20-29,<br/>\nand it was always easy to find or start a decent group. Now those spots<br/>\nare starting to green out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI came back to the old world at 30 to try some of my old haunts, but both<br/>\ncazic-thule and unrest have been very disappointing.  The unrest basement<br/>\nwasn&#39;t bad except for the powerlevellers (2 different L50+ druids<br/>\nlevelling L20-L25 people) pulling past us and causing havoc.  Cazic would<br/>\nbe nice, except the three groups I found all had at least one complete<br/>\nidiot in them, and we spent more time zoning/dieing than fighting.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny advice appreciated.  I don&#39;t like soloing very much (too much<br/>\ndowntime, not enough interaction, and no chance to use our best abilities<br/>\nlike shadow compact and screaming terror), but I&#39;ll consider it since<br/>\ndowntime in a bad group is worse than soloing.<br/>\n--<br/>\nMark Rafn    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dagon@...\">dagon@...</a>    &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.dagon.net/\">http://www.dagon.net/</a>&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
