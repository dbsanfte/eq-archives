(especially with just one <br/>\noccurrence)<br/>\n<br/>\nOne other reason is screaming terror... if the pet really was no longer <br/>\nhis... why did it attack the NPC again...  screaming terror would make it <br/>\nforget it was mad at the NPC and not attack the NPC to defend its master...  <br/>\nit would attack again if it was defending its master, not if it had no <br/>\nmaster...<br/>\n<br/>\nOf coarse most of this is just hypothesis :)  But none of us really know what <br/>\nhappened.<br/>\n<br/>\nSonoroud Tomebinder</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
