Does anyone know how to correctly use the Vampiric Embrace <br/>\n&gt;spell?<br/>\n&gt;I mean I thought it was like lifetap or lifespike (where you target your<br/>\n&gt;opponent and you steal his HP) but with this spell when I target a monster,<br/>\n&gt;I see I hand icon appear on my display and nothing else happens. Now I have<br/>\n&gt;tried to attack a creature and sometimes when the thing dies I get some <br/>\n&gt;HP&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;back but not all the time....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Do I have to be bare handed for it to work or is there something I am doing<br/>\n&gt;wrong?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Any help with this spell would be appreciated.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;thanks in advance.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Cilten<br/>\n&gt;Level 10 Gnome Necromancer<br/>\n&gt;Cazic-Thule Server<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Looking for a new hobby?
