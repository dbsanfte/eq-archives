You can have<br/>\npartial resists and full resists.  You can turn around and cast it on the<br/>\nexact same mob and get full effect.  These changes went into EQ over a year<br/>\nago.  They are well documented by many necros (I had it happen a couple<br/>\ntimes).  Its just that its rare.  I think the main thing is that Necros got<br/>\nmany more spells today than they used to.  The Drain line is simply not used<br/>\nto the extent it was before, therefore the resists are even more rare.<br/>\n<br/>\nJames<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Mark Rafn&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dagon@...\">dagon@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@egroups.com\">EQ_Necromancer@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, September 28, 2000 12:43 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ_Necromancer] Re: Particle Weapon for Necro&#39;s<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:faelen@...\">faelen@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt; Ummmm....
