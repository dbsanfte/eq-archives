Some of my friends want me to go there but<br/>\nso far I have declined because of this faction loss.  This is for both<br/>\nrole-playing reasons (I want to be a loyal subject of my Queen) and I also<br/>\ndon&#39;t want to screw up my faction for quests that Verant may implement in<br/>\nthe future.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, any information is appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAzerin D&#39;Tsalaroth of Brell</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
