I am a DE; therefore, I have no real desire to<br/>\ngo to Faydwer.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition, what spell casting strategies do you guys use?<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you,<br/>\nAzerin who can&#39;t play EQ right now so he wants to plan what he will do once<br/>\nhe can play again</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
