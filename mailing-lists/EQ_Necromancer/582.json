The trick is that all people in town are not the same faction (though <br/>\nall guards in the same zone are the same faction).<br/>\n<br/>\nmost of the mages guilds HATE necros... so hopefully there is a place where <br/>\nyou can see a wizard first... and con them from a distance while invisible to <br/>\nsee.  I cannot speak for felweith... I only know freeport.<br/>\n<br/>\nA good example of the variation on factions within a town is Qeynos.  I am a <br/>\nDark Elf Necromancer, I have killed enough in Black Burrow and Paw that I am <br/>\nnow Dubious to the guards, and human merchants...  so I wandered to the bank, <br/>\nthen went in a building out of the way... when all of a sudden an Elf <br/>\nmerchant from the middle of nowhere came and sluaghered me (Double attack fo <br/>\n100 each, and a bash for 68... and another hit before I could get of feign <br/>\ndeath...)<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a side not for you.  If you have killed enough Orcs in crushbone to change <br/>\nyour faction with Felwith... you are probably KOS in the Neriak and Nectulos <br/>\nforest (Dark Elf Zones)<br/>\n<br/>\nSonoroud</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
