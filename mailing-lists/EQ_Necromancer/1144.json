I need to know<br/>\na level recommendation for the area & her, as well.  It&#39;s been awhile since<br/>\nI&#39;ve heard much about them.<br/>\n<br/>\n    On a seperate subject.  I&#39;m 14th level and still wearing the Sr.<br/>\nApprentice robe.  The rest of my armour, which isn&#39;t much at that, are only<br/>\ncloth items.  Greens can hit for 15, 20pts of damage, it&#39;s pretty sad.  I<br/>\nknow casters don&#39;t get much, but I know we get better than this.  Could you<br/>\ngive robe & armour idea, where one may find them, level VS item (such as<br/>\n25th being typical for full Bronze), etc?  I&#39;m half naked, and I&#39;m supposed<br/>\nto be a scary Necromancer. LoL  Nothing all too impressive about this. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n    Thanks for the help.  I don&#39;t focus on leveling much, obviously, but I&#39;d<br/>\nenjoy some new stuff.  Finally, at 13th level, I got my Runed Totem Staff<br/>\n(for a higher price than I could&#39;ve I later learned, but oh well).<br/>\n<br/>\n    Thanks folks.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Currently, I&#39;m in the Qeynos area, but semi-soon heading back towards<br/>\nNeriak.  Anything in these two areas would be nice to hear about.  I know<br/>\nthe Flowing Black Robe is in Najena in Lavastorm, but at my level I&#39;m pretty<br/>\nsure this is a weeeee above me. ;-)  However, I would still like it.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Thanks for any info folks. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n~Shadow</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
