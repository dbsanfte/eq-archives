It&#39;s pretty much<br/>\nthe same with all the other Necro quests too.  They&#39;re designed to make you<br/>\nwaste the time you otherwise would have spent leveling, inching closer to<br/>\n50. (Verant doesn&#39;t want you to hit 50 for fear that you&#39;ll leave and take<br/>\nyour money with you.)  Most of the items are there only for vanity&#39;s sake,<br/>\nalthough I&#39;ve gotten addicted to permenantly being able to see invis.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI used screaming terror last night, and I love it.  People in my guild are<br/>\nALREADY asking me to join groups because of it.  It&#39;s a great spell, though<br/>\nI haven&#39;t played with it on any yellows or evens yet.  If you&#39;re soloing<br/>\nwith a pet, use it, stacked with Shadow Vortex, and then a Darkness (which<br/>\nwill pull the mob as soon as the first tick of the DoT hits).  Bottom line<br/>\nis, it makes us more useful/wanted in a group, which is something we&#39;ve been<br/>\nlacking in.  And once you get to higher levels, you&#39;ll realize that if<br/>\nyou&#39;re not wanted in a group, you&#39;ll have a hard time getting anything good<br/>\nwithout buying it.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
