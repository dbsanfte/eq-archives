Who<br/>\nwouldnt.. I was thinking maybe have some special item even that would hold<br/>\nmore spells. Like a staff that can hold 3 spell stots. so its not just every<br/>\none get more. Thats just to vage in my book.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; i would really just like to be able to have spells ready in case of<br/>\n&gt;&gt; emergencies, without hurting my ordinary ability to dish out damage.  for<br/>\n&gt;&gt; example, i almost always have ward undead, even if there are only a few<br/>\n&gt;&gt; undead around.  resting after a battle and getting attack by a zombie is<br/>\n&gt;no<br/>\n&gt;&gt; fun, even though they are rather weak opponents.  even a high level,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; ordinary skeleton can do some damage if you dont have a pet and/or ward.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; just for comparison, i got trained by 3 skels, without a pet, and i was<br/>\n&gt;able<br/>\n&gt;&gt; to kill them all.  by the time i finished i was severly low on hp, and<br/>\n&gt;just<br/>\n&gt;&gt; about out of mana (enough for gather shadows).  if i wouldnt have had<br/>\n&gt;ward,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; i would have been dark elf pot pie.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; i also like to keep either gather shadows or gate on hand, but it would<br/>\n </span></blockquote>be<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; nice to have access to both.  also, i almost always use dark pact, and<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;&gt; extra mana has saved my buns many a time.  it would just be nice to have<br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; ability to use a good portion of the spells i have, instead of needing to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; choose a small handful.  im sure any spellcaster can agree with that, but<br/>\n&gt;&gt; since we are already limited in our ability to take damage, i think the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; versatility would help, even if it doesnt really make us all that much<br/>\n&gt;more<br/>\n&gt;&gt; powerful.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; belphenor<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
