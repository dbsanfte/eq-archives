I have accidentally<br/>\n  messed up my factions with Dark Bargainers so that they are apprehensive.<br/>\nI<br/>\n  don&#39;t know how this happened, but I went from amiable to apprehensive<br/>\n  without even being indifferent!!!  But anyway, is there ANY way to get<br/>\n  factions higher with Dark Bargainers that anybody can think of?  I tried<br/>\n  Wine quest...  won&#39;t give it to ya unless you are indiff or better.  I<br/>\ntried<br/>\n  slaves in Crushbone...  the woodelf slaves gave me good factions towards<br/>\n  Indigo Brotherhood, but none to Dark Bargainers.  Tried the GLS and LS<br/>\nquest<br/>\n  in South Ro to Smith Tv&#39;ysa but she wouldn&#39;t take them or talk to me<br/>\n  either...  must have to be indiff here as well.  So I finally got a lvl 50<br/>\n  druid (39 - 50 can do this) cast wolf form on me in S. Ro and this made no<br/>\n  difference.  She still hated me!  So is there any quests anyone can think<br/>\nof<br/>\n  that would possibly help me here?  I am really getting desperate and have<br/>\n  spent hours trying these other things.  Thanks a lot!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Really paying for this stupid mistake!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n  - Xinuilt<br/>\n    lvl 20 DE on Quillious<br/>\n<br/>\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n--<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n--<br/>\n  This list is basically unmoderated.
