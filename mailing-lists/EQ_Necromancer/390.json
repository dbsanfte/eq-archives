I&#39;m truly looking forward to trompting about the lands of EverQuest as a skeleton. :-)  I can imagine the other players who aren&#39;t familiar with the spell, thinking you&#39;re some wondering NPC or whatever.  Especially if you have a last name.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Though... this makes me wonder.  When we change into the form of a skeleton, does this make us susceptible to the Ward Undead line of spells?  Ouch, beware if you&#39;re +pvp, if so!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Mysk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Juan Custer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JuanC@...\">JuanC@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A weird one, I got rid of it.  Note that AoD used to turn you into a<br/>\n&gt; skeleton, but no longers does that.  The next level of this spell is at<br/>\n&gt; level 34 or 39 I believe and it WILL turn you into a skeleton or change some<br/>\n&gt; features or something. ;)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Malark </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
