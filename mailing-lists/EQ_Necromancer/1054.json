While I am making good xp and cant complain, I am beginning to reach the point where the XP out there is low.  Does anyone have any suggestions where a Human Necromancer can go to level from 6-8, 8-12, 12-16, and 16-20?  I know BB is a good source of XP and loot, but it is usually crowded and there are trains which is never good for a caster, especially in such a small area (running room wise).  Are the Karanas available at that level?  With where I placed myself, am I stuck there till a later level?  How can we change our factions so, while the guards can sneer at us and call us names, they will leave us alone in other towns such as Rivervale or Freeport or even Halas?  While I am sure this is something that has been covered time and again on this list and I apologize for redundency, any info would be greatly appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Dalthor<br/>\n  Level 6 Necromancer<br/>\n  TestServer </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
