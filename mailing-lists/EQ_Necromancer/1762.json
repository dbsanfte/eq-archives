By killing goblins and Dwarven Bandits I have got<br/>\nmy faction that I am dubious to everyone, merchants and guards alike.  Now<br/>\nGuards won&#39;t kill me, but Merchants won&#39;t sell to me, and worse the BANKER<br/>\nlooks at me threatenly (I assume he will kill me if I try and bank).  How<br/>\ncan I increase merchant and banker faction?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I heard that anywhere there is a necro guild I can enter the city and<br/>\nnot be KOS, Freeport, Qeynos, & Ak&#39;Anon, is this true?<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone have a faction list of what we can do to be liked (if not for<br/>\nreal, enough that they sell to us).  I heard that we can actually enter 3rd<br/>\nGate (invis to ghouls) and be able to buy SOME spells there from some<br/>\nmerchants. <br/>\n<br/>\nAny help to a new Gnome Necro would be great...<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your time,<br/>\nAbra</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
