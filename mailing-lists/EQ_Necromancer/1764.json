Most other cities, you won&#39;t be allowed in the non-necro<br/>\nmagic or cleric guild, but they&#39;re indifferent in Neriak.

I heard that we can actually enter<br/>\n3rd<br/>\n&gt; Gate (invis to ghouls) and be able to buy SOME spells there from some<br/>\n&gt; merchants. <br/>\n<br/>\nYup.  Most merchants (including the bank) outside of the necro guild are<br/>\nindifferent to you, and guards are dubious. Invis to undead to pass the<br/>\nghouls, and buy from about half of the necro vendors.<br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://users.net1inc.net/mr_boffo/faction.htm has some info on raising<br/>\nvarious factions, and AllaKhazam (http://everquest.allakhazam.com) has a<br/>\nfaction section that&#39;s mostly complete.<br/>\n--<br/>\nMark Rafn    dagon@...    &lt;http://www.dagon.net/&gt;   !G<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nFREE ADVICE FROM REAL PEOPLE!
