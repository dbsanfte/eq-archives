Generally synonymous to PvP.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor most servers in DAoC, the world is split into<br/>\n3 kingdoms or realms: Hibernia, Albion and Midgard.<br/>\nPlayer vs player combat is 99.9% limited to combat<br/>\nbetween the realms. For example, Hibs cannot attack<br/>\nother Hibs or Hib npcs or guards, and likewise for<br/>\nAlbion and Midgard. If you want to fight other players,<br/>\nyou go to the frontier zones and fight against the<br/>\nother realms. Hence, Realm vs Realm.<br/>\n<br/>\nRecently a duel feature was implemented, but you gain<br/>\nno xp or cash for winning a duel and lose nothing for<br/>\ndying in a duel. (If a Mob kills you when you are wounded<br/>\nfrom a duel, that does count as a real death.) So far,<br/>\nI&#39;ve only seen duels done between friends for fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are two PvP servers in DAoC - Mordred and Andred.<br/>\nI skimmed the PvP rules once and they seemed pretty brutal,<br/>\nbut I&#39;ve never played or talked to someone who has played<br/>\non the PvP servers.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarlon<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: KAZ [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kazvorpal@...\">kazvorpal@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, February 24, 2003 8:43 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@yahoogroups.com\">EQ_Necromancer@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ_Necromancer] just joined<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- &quot;Howler D.
