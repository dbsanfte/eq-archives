Your attack speed is N, his attack speed<br/>\nis X, and they intertwine randomly. The only difference between that and not<br/>\nhaving an auto-attack is that you can&#39;t /hesitate/ easily in attacking. Even<br/>\nif you had no auto-attack, you could only swing so fast, and would probably<br/>\ntry to emulate auto-attack with your blows.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; Are you on drugs? These are ALL first person shooter perspective.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I did misuse the word &quot;persepective&quot; here. However, the point I was trying<br/>\n&gt; to convery was that in my opinion something like SWG should not be turn<br/>\n&gt; based. It should be more in line with Unreal Touney, Quake 3, Doom 3, etc.<br/>\n&gt; Aiming a weapon at point blank range and letting the computer basically<br/>\n&gt; roll<br/>\n&gt; a die to see if it hit you sucks. It sounds like they have the right idea<br/>\n&gt; for the space flight expansion however.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hopefully you won&#39;t auto-attack with a blaster, anyway. You&#39;ll at least have<br/>\nto fire manually, like range weapons in EQ.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And to answer the first part of your question, the answer is no. I never<br/>\n&gt; have and never will. You can&#39;t expect to do well in these games if you kill<br/>\n&gt; half of your freakin brain cells.  I am a professional software developer<br/>\n&gt; and you can&#39;t expect to be a doper, write good code and keep your job when<br/>\n&gt; you are stoned.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>True, which is part of why I don&#39;t. I certainly did experiment with them at<br/>\none time, though, which I consider helpful in one&#39;s overall intellectual<br/>\nevolution. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; What, by the way, does RvR mean?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Realm vs. Realm combat. I believe Marlon answered that one in another post<br/>\n&gt; so I won&#39;t give you the gory details.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>One thing I /hated/ about Anarchy Online was the ridiculous, narrow<br/>\nCorporation vs Rebellion nonsense, where you&#39;re trapped into this bi-partisan<br/>\nstruggle, which is so absolutely not like real life outside of politics...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; EQ2 uses the same engine as Star Wars Galaxies, which you were just<br/>\n&gt; dissing.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Um, not in the slightest. Try reading the FAQ from each game sometime. They<br/>\n&gt; have created TWO totally seperate engines. The EQ2 engine is still VERY<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That certainly wasn&#39;t the original plan. They were to use the same graphics<br/>\nengine, but that was a year ago...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; Nope, their lack of foresight&#39;s probably losing them this player. I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have the resources nowadays to spend ANY money &quot;just in case I like it<br/>\n&gt; more<br/>\n&gt; &gt; than the game I enjoy playing now&quot;. Even when I was annoyed with EQ a<br/>\n&gt; year<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ago, there were plenty of MMORPGs out there who would let me try them<br/>\n&gt; free.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well, that of course is entirely up to you.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Actually, it&#39;s them. Most companies have enough sense to offer demos of good<br/>\nproducts. In the case of MMORPGs the percentage of income from actually<br/>\nselling the title is vanishing, so it&#39;s just plain dumb to not encourage<br/>\npeople to try it (and thus subscribe) at the cost of risking a little in game sales.<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\nThere are things in the Constitution that have been overtaken by events, by time...Inappropriate, anachronistic, it isn&#39;t done anymore...<br/>\n -- Chairman Henry Hyde, who doesn&#39;t believe the Constitution needs to be followed or legally changed, just ignored.<br/>\n<br/>\nAIM/Yahoo/AOL Instant Messenger: KazVorpal    <br/>\nICQ#: 1912557 MSN Messenger: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:KazVorpal@...\">KazVorpal@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
