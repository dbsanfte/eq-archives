But it&#39;s always camped and bad faction hits with Queynos <br/>\nGuards and druids/treants in general.<br/>\n2) The Hermit (unkept druid) in SK also give good exp plus the occasional FS <br/>\nweapon, that too is often camped. GOOD faction with druids, bad with Unkept <br/>\nones.<br/>\n<br/>\nGrouping:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Stone skeleton tower in Lake Rathe. The tower is situated close to the <br/>\nRathe Mountain zone. You will need to swim to it and it&#39;s a double spawn of <br/>\na mage (level 25) in skeleton form and his pet. Get a ranger and/or a druid <br/>\nto harmony.<br/>\n2) Icy orcs at Everfrost. 5 spawns plus a nasty caster Orc named Redwind. <br/>\nAgain harmony works wonders and requires a full balanced group.<br/>\n3) My favorite, Estate of Unrest. Group must consist of at least one cleric <br/>\nand preferably one person who can SOW. Camp the Hand room for fast exp and <br/>\neasy escape route, Magi or Bar room for fast spawns, or Tower for the BS <br/>\nTunic! One word of warning, keep your pet under a tight leash here as he can <br/>\npull massive trains back to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nUtendar of Veeshan<br/>\nDE Necromancer 34th Level</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
