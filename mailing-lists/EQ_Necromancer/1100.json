I don&#39;t mean to waist level .... I mean swim out a bit. The<br/>\nsisters can&#39;t/don&#39;t swim and will only follow you until the swim point. You can then<br/>\nsafely gate, or even summon a new pet. I&#39;ve even memorized a pet spell, sent him up to<br/>\nfight, then another until the coast was clear. =) Call it what you will but at least it<br/>\nkept me from dying.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome other tips would be to gamble a little and bind to Freeport. You will cut your<br/>\ntravel time to sell belts IMMENSELY. Yes if you die it will be a pain but it is sooooo<br/>\nworth it to be able to gate back and sell things in a minute or two instead of about<br/>\n30. Also, at level 12 several of the sisters will be in the blue range for you. Pay<br/>\nattention to the clothing type since sisters of the same level range dress the same.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Haytred<br/>\n<br/>\nHeath Barker wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Heath Barker&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Merxion@...\">Merxion@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Actually like all places in EQ there is a risk Reward.  stay away con and be<br/>\n&gt; smart.  worst mistake you could make is to get greedy.  What I usually do is<br/>\n&gt; watch for the island once it comes into sight is to swim to it.  This puts<br/>\n&gt; me on a little outcropping that has a pretty good spawn rate of the lower<br/>\n&gt; level Sisters.  Keep an eye out for them and dont be affraid of sacking your<br/>\n&gt; pet and gating.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Jon Fiedler &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fiedler@...\">fiedler@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Date: Monday, August 02, 1999 7:03 AM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [EQ_Necromancer] Thank you Aarkon.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Jon Fiedler&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fiedler@...\">fiedler@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I have a couple questions about the island... I&#39;m almost 12 (on a new<br/>\n&gt; &gt;server) and was thinking about checking it out.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I know there are some high level sisters (red to my old char at 17)... do<br/>\n&gt; &gt;you have to worry about them wandering by?   The one I know I saw was<br/>\n&gt; &gt;standing out in the water a little ways from the island.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Where is a good place to hunt on the island?  I&#39;ve never really been there<br/>\n&gt; &gt;(seen it from the boat many times) and since I believe they will be agro to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;my DE Necro (they are wood elves) I won&#39;t be able to really explore.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Any other general advise/tips about the island?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;The darkness be with you,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Azerin now of Brell<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Aarkon,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I read your post the other day about being able to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; handle Sister Isle from level 12+.
