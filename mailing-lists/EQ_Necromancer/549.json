I was worried when I first<br/>\nread about it, as mage-class is usually a very popular class. But when you<br/>\nthink &#39;bout it, it&#39;ll definately add an air of mystery, and I think the<br/>\nclass will level itself out. :-)  I also like how you find your spells and<br/>\nsuch, with the phrases, gestures, and reagents and can experiment to create<br/>\nyour own.  I think it pulls you into the world better along with how the<br/>\nmagic system works out.<br/>\n<br/>\n    The major draw back I see to Asheron&#39;s Call is the world.  First, I<br/>\nthink Dereth is a silly name for a Fantasy world (Norath is certainly much<br/>\nbetter a name:), and then there&#39;s the size.  The size of road island, they<br/>\nsay.  Well great, Antonica is probably bigger than that in and of itself.<br/>\n:-)  I hope they&#39;ll add more.  Just so you folks know I&#39;m not trashing EQ.<br/>\n;)<br/>\n<br/>\n    As for the graphics...from what I&#39;ve seen in the videos it&#39;s smoother,<br/>\nbut then they always use spiffy 3D cards for things like that.  With the<br/>\nleaves and all, the impression I got from the A&#39;sC website was that the<br/>\nfallen leaves would blow across the ground, whereas in EQ it&#39;s the leaves in<br/>\nthe trees.<br/>\n<br/>\n    I&#39;m going to have to look into this a bit more.  EQ may have some<br/>\ncompetition. ;) But I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll hurt EQ by a long shot.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Mysk<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Patrickje1@...\">Patrickje1@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Im not sure of the exact date that asheron&#39;s call is going to be out but I<br/>\n&gt; know its not real soon.
