Upon<br/>\nturning in a shadowed scythe to Vurgo, he hands you a note and asks for a<br/>\nshadowed knife from the goblin headmaster in OOT, this was relatively<br/>\nsimple, the headmaster spawns on the far side of oracle island.  His spot is<br/>\non the left of a hut that spawns 2 goblins, once I found him he seemed to be<br/>\na pretty common spawn.  The next item I needed was a mortuary fungus eye<br/>\nfrom unrest.  This was a pain in the ass...I got to unrest at about 2am CST<br/>\nand there were a total of 6 people there and I was the highest level by 15<br/>\n(39)  Needless to say...I was the only one going anywhere near the basement<br/>\n:(  my suggestion unless you&#39;re level 50 is to go during peak hours when the<br/>\nhouse is totally camped and bring a couple friends anyway.  The fungus spawn<br/>\npretty much near the end of the basement, near the ghost, in a couple pit<br/>\ntraps in the floor.  The eye is a rare drop, and it took me a good 3 hrs to<br/>\nget one...maybe I was just unlucky.  As far as shadowed men go, once you hit<br/>\nlevel 36 or so, you can generally pull singles from the camp, and once you<br/>\nhit 39, your pet can solo them ;) (one at a time of course) unless it&#39;s a<br/>\ncleric...then he might need a little nuke push at the end.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis list is basically unmoderated.  However abusive language will not be<br/>\ntolerated</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
