As<br/>\n&gt;for hunting grounds I would suggest sticking to Oasis until 20 or at 18 or so<br/>\n&gt;you could move to Lake Rathe and hunt the undead at night and gnolls in the<br/>\n&gt;day.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I thought killing the undead at Lake Rathe would cause some horrible faction<br/>\nchange and get you banished from the guild or something? I&#39;m a Dark Elf, maybe<br/>\nit only applies to DE&#39;s? Can someone confirm or debunk this? Thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\njspectre @ innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
