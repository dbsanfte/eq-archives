Does anyone use wave enfeeblement?  Its an area effect spell that i was thinking of buying for use on skele and orc mobs.  Noone has it that I know of and was just wondering what it does and how potent it is.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAlso have some questions on robes.  What would be better to go for:  the gossamer (white) robe found in befallen or the black flowing robe in Najena?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAlso, should I make the runed totem staff my goal for a new weapon or is there something else out there for a necro?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAlso, If I were to buy these items, anybody have an idea of a fair price?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nGrymspine</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
