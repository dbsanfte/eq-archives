There are also skeletal monks and a<br/>\nbarbed bones skeletons, both can drop small bronze armor and offer a little<br/>\nmore challenge than the giant skeletons. The rune is to the left as you<br/>\nenter the zone from the Feerrott, just past the tower with undead in it<br/>\n(avoid that tower). There are a few spot that are guaranteed solo pulls. If<br/>\nyou are facing the rune, the spawn that is furthest right will come solo<br/>\nalways, and the best tactic to use for the rest is to separate the spawn<br/>\npoints by leaving a normal zombie or skeleton there, as those wont come when<br/>\nyou pull the higher level mobs. There are also ice bone and dry bone<br/>\nskeletons that sometimes ring in experience, but are mostly a pain in the<br/>\nbutt at level 24+. This is a little known sweet spot for a necromancer if it<br/>\nis worked correctly. You will get good cash from the sale of the bronze<br/>\narmor that drops, you will have a stack of bone chips up to your chin, and<br/>\nthe zone line is close if you get in trouble. The last piece of advice I can<br/>\noffer is, play around with the /pet no taunt, it was not available when I<br/>\nwas there, and I think that is would have kept me and my pet safer since you<br/>\ncan kite the skeletons around the area with little chance of being attacked<br/>\nby other mobs. Take care and good hunting.<br/>\n<br/>\nDresa D&#39;Ashire<br/>\n50th Necromancer<br/>\nRallos Zek</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
