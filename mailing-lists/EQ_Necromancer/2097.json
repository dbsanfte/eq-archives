ALWAYS. Ok a DSL is a \nstatic connection to the internet. You do not deal with anyone else sucking \nbandwidth from you. It is all dependent on your own connectivity. I have a 384kb \nDSL this is a low end one. I always connect at that regardless if it is 1am or \n6pm. If you go DSL you get the best DSL that&nbsp; are coming out right now \nreach speeds of 1.5mb this is faster then Cable Modem and is actually faster \nthen ISDN and is almost as fast as a T-1 which rates at 1.55mb. But I only pay \n50 dollars a month for mine as where T-1 is about 600 or so. So DSL is better in \na lot of ways. One when you turn your computer on you are connected. You share \nnothing with anyone. It is a completely independent connection per user. And \nlast but not least Affordable. If you can get one go DSL it is better. If you do \nnot believe me then check out DSL.com. Or hell Check out Bellsouth.net that is \nwho I will be using and the DSL is 1.5mb. Right now I use Gulftel.net and \nconnect at 384kb. I never experience lag unless caused by the server I am \nconnecting to.</span></font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Rockwell\"><span\n class=\"ygrps-yiv-484239501590122313-10052000\"></span></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Rockwell\"><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-484239501590122313-10052000\">Cable modem was the next \nbest thing after ISDN, until ADSL came out. Actually depending on the DSL you \nget you can ever surpass T-1 a VDSL can connect at about 2.5mb and cost about \n230 a month but is a lot faster then T-1 static and is better then anything \nother then a T-3 or greater.</span></font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Rockwell\"><span\n class=\"ygrps-yiv-484239501590122313-10052000\"></span></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Rockwell\"><span\n class=\"ygrps-yiv-484239501590122313-10052000\"></span></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Rockwell\"><span\n class=\"ygrps-yiv-484239501590122313-10052000\"></span></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Rockwell\"><span\n class=\"ygrps-yiv-484239501590122313-10052000\"></span></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Rockwell\"><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-484239501590122313-10052000\">\n<div><strong>&quot;Yes one day I will return.</strong></div>\n<div><strong>There must be no sadness no regrets.</strong></div>\n<div><strong>Jus go forth in all your beliefs and prove to me</strong></div>\n<div><strong>I am not wrong in mine.&quot;</strong></div></span></font></div>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote>\n  <div align=\"left\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-484239501OutlookMessageHeader\" dir=\"ltr\"><font face=\"Tahoma\"\n size=\"2\">-----Original Message-----<br><b>From:</b> Niomar \n  [mailto:Niomar@...]<br><b>Sent:</b> Tuesday, May 09, 2000 9:05 \n  PM<br><b>To:</b> EQ_Necromancer@egroups.com<br><b>Subject:</b> Re: \n  [EQ_Necromancer] Cable Modem question<br><br></font></div><tt>Cable is ALMOST \n  always faster.<br><br>Telikas Recedas, Dark Elven Mage of Xegony.<br><br>----- \n  Original Message -----<br>From: &quot;Clint Magnuson&quot; \n  &lt;blizzard15@...&gt;<br>To: \n  &lt;EQ_Necromancer@egroups.com&gt;<br>Sent: Tuesday, May 09, 2000 9:03 \n  PM<br>Subject: Re: [EQ_Necromancer] Cable Modem question<br><br><br>&gt; I \n  have recently gotten the availability of cable and DSL in my area for<br>&gt; \n  about the same price.
