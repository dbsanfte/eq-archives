I&#39;ve died and lost it <br/>\n&gt;4<br/>\n&gt;times now and can&#39;t seem to get above one bubble of exp before I lose it.<br/>\n&gt;Hunting<br/>\n&gt;in the forest seems to be worthless, only an occasional skeleton gives me <br/>\n&gt;any<br/>\n&gt;exp (or a kodiak if I can find one), the haflings eat me for lunch. I&#39;ve <br/>\n&gt;been<br/>\n&gt;to<br/>\n&gt;east commons a few times but I die as much as I make experience. Befallen<br/>\n&gt;seems to be too hard (and I die) or too easy (and no exp). Am I doing<br/>\n&gt;something wrong? Should I be hunting elsewhere? I&#39;ve about had it with my<br/>\n&gt;necro character, I&#39;ve recently started a human mage in Freeport (eech) and<br/>\n&gt;he&#39;s having a much easier time. I don&#39;t mind slow going but I like to see <br/>\n&gt;some<br/>\n&gt;character advancement.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Any suggestions? Any help?
