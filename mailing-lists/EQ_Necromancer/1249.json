I am only level 15, however one of the reasons that<br/>\nthis does not bother me is that it takes me a long time to level. At<br/>\nthe rate I am going, I should hit level 30 right around christmas. I<br/>\nsuppose then I will see problems. *grin* Of course, thats several more<br/>\nmonths of enjoying the game. By then, who knows what will hold my<br/>\ninterest. Perhaps I will start playin AC, or maybe take up underwater<br/>\nbasket weaving. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nTrizzen 15th level necromancer<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  Actually the extra ticks mean nothing in a group<br/>\n&gt; since you rarely get a dot<br/>\n&gt; to even do more then 3/4 damage before the patch<br/>\n&gt; since the creature was<br/>\n&gt; taken out so quickly. Believe me you can have a lot<br/>\n&gt; of friends but you&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; find that there not on all the time. Friends help<br/>\n&gt; but it doesn&#39;t solve the<br/>\n&gt; problem.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Naeeldar<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nBid and sell for free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://auctions.yahoo.com\">http://auctions.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
