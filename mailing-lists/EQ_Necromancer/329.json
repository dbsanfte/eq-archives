At later levels bone chips aren&#39;t a problem because of all<br/>\nthe newbies getting bone chips in the Forest.  I pay well for them too.  I<br/>\nusually stock up to 60 to 80 chips.  I&#39;ll summon, get a green one, reclaim,<br/>\nsummon for blue risky, reclaim, summon for green, reclaim, rest, summon for<br/>\nblue dangerous or white and be satisfied with that.  Maybe I&#39;m being picky,<br/>\nbut with a new circle of summon I like to get what I pay for.  Summoning a<br/>\n16th level pet takes 160 mana MINIMUM.  That&#39;s roughly about a third of my<br/>\nmana.  Summoning a good pet usually cause me to sit back down and med a full<br/>\nchunk again.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAlright, perhaps its better to describe what I do now.  When I hunt,<br/>\nI hunt for the long haul, at least a good two hours or more.  I&#39;ll stock up<br/>\non 20 food/water and many bone chips.  When I get to the place (LAvastorm<br/>\ncurrently) I summon a pet, med to full mana, then cast Shielding and Spirit<br/>\narmor on me and my pet (well, Shielding and SA for me, SA for the pet), the<br/>\nmed AGAIN.  Then I go out and use magic as sparingly as possible.  Usually<br/>\nagainst lava crawlers and nastier basilisks I&#39;ll hit them with both HEart<br/>\nFlutter and Engulfing Darkness with other assorted stuff (SS, PB, etc) then<br/>\nget in down and dirty till I lose a bubble or two, then get back out and<br/>\ndrain.  Then if my skel is at less than 75% and I am at less than 75% mana<br/>\nI&#39;ll go rest, otherwise I&#39;ll find something lighter like an elemental or<br/>\nweaker basilisk.  When I hit 50% mana I stop hunting period and go rest.  I<br/>\nMend Bones a lot on my skel too.  Repeat for two hours and barring horrible<br/>\nmistakes or extra stuff jumping in, I&#39;m 10-30 platinum richer and maybe a<br/>\nbubble or two.<br/>\n<br/>\nMalark on Karana<br/>\n<br/>\nPS - Fear is useful too when you get it off, but its expensive.  It lets<br/>\nyour pet get in free hits while the monster is forced to run and can&#39;t hit<br/>\nback.  I&#39;ve found though that it works 50-75% of the time on yellows and<br/>\n75-90% of the time on whites.  I don&#39;t see any reds in Lavastorm anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Jaded [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jaded@...\">jaded@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, May 10, 1999 10:01 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EQ_Necromancer] Fw: [EQMagicians] Just a thought..<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Jaded&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jaded@...\">jaded@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Just curious, what does it take to summon a pet that makes <br/>\n&gt; them expensive at<br/>\n&gt; higher levels? Guess you need more than just bone chips, eh? <br/>\n&gt; I -knew- it was<br/>\n&gt; too good to last!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Its not cost effective at higher levels.  Later on your pets<br/>\n&gt; &gt; start costing a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; BUNCH and why run real far away and re summon when you can <br/>\n&gt; cast DoT spells<br/>\n&gt; &gt; right there and heal your pet at maximum range?  Abandoning your<br/>\n&gt; &gt; pet is only<br/>\n&gt; &gt; useful if you are running, otherwise its just better to <br/>\n&gt; stick around and<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; Congratulations to &quot;Trail Rider,&quot; our latest ONElist of the Week.  <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Visit our homepage and share with us how ONElist is changing <br/>\n&gt; YOUR life!<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; This list is basically unmoderated.
