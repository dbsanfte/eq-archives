I was going to just keep my 56K dialup connection, but due to<br/>\nthe phone wiring in the neighborhood (paired-back copper more than 15000<br/>\nfeet from a substation) the highest connection speed I can get is 26.4K.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy question is this:  Other than the fact that a cable modem connection<br/>\nslows down with each additional person logged in, are there any known issues<br/>\nwith running a cable modem and playing Everquest?<br/>\n<br/>\nSecondly, will this faster connection actually benefit me in any way (with<br/>\nregard to playing Everquest)?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance for the info.<br/>\n<br/>\nMujahid  26 Necro  Solusek Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
