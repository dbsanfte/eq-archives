You have to zone into the hills (just up the path<br/>\nfrom Qeynos) and take a right until you&#39;re at the &quot;wall&quot; of the zone.<br/>\nFollow this forward.  You&#39;ll come to a guard tower and a path leading right<br/>\nbetween two hills.  Pass this up and keep going straight.  It&#39;s a wee bit of<br/>\na walk (kinda/sorda), but Black Burrow will be the cave in the shape of the<br/>\nmouth that you come upon.  Oh, you&#39;ll have to walk left around some hills if<br/>\nyou keep following right next to the &quot;edge&quot; of the zone, as  even though it<br/>\nlooks like you can walk over it you can&#39;t.  It&#39;s a very small spot, though.<br/>\n<br/>\n    If you can&#39;t group, then I suggest sticking by the entrance, having some<br/>\nbone chips, and whacking away at near by Scrawny Gnolls if there&#39;s any left.<br/>\nThat way, you can run into the little cave that leads back out, and zone if<br/>\nyou have to to stop from dying.  Dying Sucks.  hehe.. I&#39;ve been told I<br/>\nshould make that a bumper sticker..<br/>\n<br/>\n    Anyways, the going gets much much slower at that point.  Once you reach<br/>\n8th level, then you get to go into the Karans -- as long as you have Bone<br/>\nWalk -- and pick on the beasties there.  Just keep this in mind:  The guards<br/>\nwill _NOT_ protect you against the lions.  At least, not the &quot;a lioness&quot;.<br/>\nFound that out the fun way as the guards just watched it maul the heck out<br/>\nof me. =/<br/>\n<br/>\n    To get to the Karanas, go the same way as if you were going to Black<br/>\nBurrow, but take a right on the path at the guard tower going between the<br/>\ntwo hills.  Don&#39;t go here unless you&#39;re 8th level with Bone Walk, though.<br/>\nAlso, while in the Qeynos hills you&#39;ll want to keep a _very_ keen eye out<br/>\nfor two NPC&#39;s called Holly Windstalker and Cross Treewind.  They are instant<br/>\ndeath to you.  Avoid at all cost -- I almost quit the game as I was so d***<br/>\ntired of dying so many times in a row by her.  Your faction standing doesn&#39;t<br/>\nmatter with these two, at least I know for sure with Holly.  They&#39;ll attack<br/>\nand kill you, anyway.  Stay off the paths, but that doesn&#39;t guarantee your<br/>\nsafety.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Once you go in there, use a little tactic when fighting the creatures<br/>\nand make sure you _know_ the way back to the guard tower.  Tell your Bone<br/>\nWalk skelly to attack the creature, then cast fear on it to make it run away<br/>\nand give your skelly free hits.  You can follow behind and whack away at it<br/>\ntoo, but be prepared to back off when the Fear spell wears off and its<br/>\nsuddenly facing you again.  Also, don&#39;t hunt in the Karanas like this unless<br/>\nyou have a big weapon (Pike or some other two-handed weapon) to give to<br/>\nskelly so he does some good damage.  Oh, and beware the Treant.  It&#39;s about<br/>\nthe height of a guard tower.  You&#39;ll know it when you see it.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Anything above Cavorting Bones takes two bone chips to cast, by the way.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnjoy,<br/>\n<br/>\n    ~Myskyra / Tunare<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Jason Kean &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jk211495@...\">jk211495@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Sunday, April 18, 1999 10:20 PM<br/>\nSubject: [EQ_Necromancer] lowbie necro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Jason Kean&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jk211495@...\">jk211495@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hiya, I&#39;m playing a lowbie necro based in quenos, and am running into a<br/>\nbig<br/>\n&gt; slowdown around level 6, any suggestions as for what i should be killing<br/>\nfor<br/>\n&gt; decent XP?
