Im <br/>\nnot maxed out,  I spent skill points on jewelcraft and others. <br/>\n    For reseach I do 3 things.  One, have as a high intel as possible mine is <br/>\n164 with my silver rune book.  2nd  Have as high wisdom as possible (in the <br/>\nchoice of wisdom or intel I go with wisdom), for thoose that don&#39;t know <br/>\nwisdom is what makes you suceed even if your skill fails. I believe mine is <br/>\nat 99 after i put on stat jewelry.  Last is someone else&#39;s hint, sorry dont <br/>\nknow where i got it, but it is to wait one lvl above the spell your attemping <br/>\nto make .. I made the Vampiric curse (29th spell)  at 30 with a skill of 70 <br/>\nand gained one point in skill.<br/>\n<br/>\n Good luck all <br/>\nAlso I&#39;m sitting on an extra harmshield (20th) lvl spell it is for trade for <br/>\nthe incorporeal word on Tunare server (please dont ask for it I had 2 copies <br/>\nof this and one was gift to a younger necro so this one will not be :)<br/>\n<br/>\nZakrell Lu&#39;Dan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
