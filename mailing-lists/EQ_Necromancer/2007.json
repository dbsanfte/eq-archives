Reason I ask is this:  last night I&#39;m camping<br/>\nRatraz in Neriak.  I summon my top pet, which hits for a max of 22.  My<br/>\nfriend dings into level 24 and summons his new, sexy :), dark-boned<br/>\nskeleton.  It conned a higher blue to me than my top pet......but it never<br/>\nhit for more than 22!  What gives?  Did he just happen to summon a sucky<br/>\none?<br/>\n<br/>\nNext question, deals with weapons for pets.  I know that recently our pets<br/>\nwere nerfed in this department.  I know we have to give our level 29 pets 2<br/>\nweapons in order to duel wield.  What type of weapons do you recommend?<br/>\nAnd, should I NOT give my level 24 pet a weapon?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance,<br/>\nMujahid  23 Necro Sol Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
