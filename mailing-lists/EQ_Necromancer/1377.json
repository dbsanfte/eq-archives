Necros are<br/>\nprobably the best class in a duel if, next to enchanters(never duel high<br/>\nlevel enchanters btw, they can get you killed with exp loss).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen dueling other casting classes shadowstep isn&#39;t really necessary.  The<br/>\nfirst and foremost spell you should try to get off is fear.  Once fear<br/>\nsticks, the outcome of the battle is already yours.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor melee classes shadowstep is a must.  Dot, shadowstep, dot, etc.  The<br/>\nhealing ones such as rangers and paladins are a bit harder.  So I like to<br/>\nuse fear on them while they try to heal.<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Trizzen Do&#39;Trevan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:trizzen@...\">trizzen@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Wednesday, October 20, 1999 8:05 AM<br/>\nSubject: [EQ_Necromancer] Help in dueling<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Trizzen Do&#39;Trevan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:trizzen@...\">trizzen@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Last night, I watched a level 26 necromancer with a<br/>\n&gt;pet, get wiped off of the face of Norrath by a 24th<br/>\n&gt;level ogre warrior. I have some strategies for necro<br/>\n&gt;against caster, but how do you fight a warrior? The<br/>\n&gt;necro could not get any of his spells of as the<br/>\n&gt;warrior bashed/kicked/slashed him to death. The fight<br/>\n&gt;took a while as the necro ran around without much<br/>\n&gt;effect. End result, one dead necro, ogre at half<br/>\n&gt;health. They only thing I could think of was sic pet,<br/>\n&gt;shadow step, cast darkness, then proceed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I guess I have two questions:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;What strategy do you all use for necro vs warrior<br/>\n&gt;type?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;What strategy do you all use for necro vs caster type?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I am really curious to see what everyone says to this.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Darkmoon Somberlight<br/>\n&gt;24th level necromancer Quellious<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;=====<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;This list is basically unmoderated.
