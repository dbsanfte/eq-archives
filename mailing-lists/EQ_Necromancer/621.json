All my friends are in<br/>\nthe human territories unforunately, and I am stuck in Erudin.  I did<br/>\ntake the boat from Erudin to Quetos (however you spell it) but they<br/>\nkilled as soon as I got off the boat instantly.  It was quite nerve<br/>\nwracking.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m going to try to meet up with them again, but I&#39;ve gotta be quick<br/>\nand get heck outta Quetos real fast..as soon as I land without runing<br/>\ninto NPCs.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAre there and Erudin Necros here?  I&#39;d just like to discuss a few<br/>\ntips, like where do you get water from in Erudin?  I&#39;m gonna hopefully<br/>\ntalk to one of the wizards around there to pick up a fishing rod for<br/>\nme, so food is not going to be a problem soon I hope.<br/>\n<br/>\nProblem with Erudin (hopefully there are some from Erudin here) it<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t seem too busy.  There&#39;s like an average of 6 - 8 people on the<br/>\nVeeshan server.  They are all wizards, so getting a nicely mixed party<br/>\ntogether is impossible.  <br/>\n<br/>\n===<br/>\n     ,,<br/>\nShaithis<br/>\n  ,,</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
