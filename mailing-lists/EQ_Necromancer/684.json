Its not as bad as the hellish <br/>\n&gt;level 7 (I was there for 16 days) but it is still bad! I tried Lrodd.... I <br/>\n&gt;am NOT doing that again. I beat him ONE TIME out of the several times I <br/>\n&gt;fought him, and for that one time I lost a pet with a twohanded sword, had <br/>\n&gt;no mana, and was at less than a bar of health. For all this, I got SO <br/>\n&gt;LITTLE XP THE BAR DIDN&quot;T CHANGE! And this was solo without a pet! The other <br/>\n&gt;times Lrodd just kicked my ass.  I&#39;ve tried WC but Kodies jump me and kill <br/>\n&gt;me while I fight YKs. I&#39;ve tried Kithicor, but the Ghouls jump me and kill <br/>\n&gt;me. I&#39;ve tried Nro and the xp is sooo bad there. Guk is a joke. Either too <br/>\n&gt;hard or too easy. Innothule is worse, its ALL green there. The orc camps <br/>\n&gt;are worthless. I can&#39;t find a group to hunt with, so the Dervishes are out. <br/>\n&gt;  EC I tried (again) and while fighting a lion a Cent jumped me. I ran past <br/>\n&gt;4 people macroing &quot;HELP ME!! HELP ME!!&quot; and they did nothing. The cent got <br/>\n&gt;me. I went back out, fought a blue lion, and an even one came up and <br/>\n&gt;attacked my pet. I gated away and logged, utterly frustrated at having lost <br/>\n&gt;a bar and a half of xp in two days. If I keep up like this, I am going to <br/>\n&gt;be level 9 AGAIN. Please, someone help me! Where can I hunt solo w/pet at <br/>\n&gt;level 10?!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Vaelthek<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
