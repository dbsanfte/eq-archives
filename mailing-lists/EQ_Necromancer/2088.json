She <br/>\nsells to evil races, and is usually on the <br/>\neast side.  Recently she has moved to the <br/>\nwest side, and farther north near the zone<br/>\n to E. Freeport.  More importantly she <br/>\nwon&#39;t sell to me anymore.  Says she is busy.<br/>\nHas anybody seen this before?  She cons <br/>\napprehensive to me.  She&#39;s been like this <br/>\nfor several days, so its not that she just <br/>\nchased somebody to the zone. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, over the weekend, Dorn changed from <br/>\n&#39;amiable&#39; to me, to &#39;ready to attack&#39;.  <br/>\nHas anybody noticed this before?  Does he <br/>\nget nasty from time to time. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am DE Necromancer.  I haven&#39;t been killing <br/>\nDervs.  This is happening on the Fennin Ro <br/>\nserver. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems to rain a lot more too, but that <br/>\ncould just be the seasons.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJust curious.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMarlon</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
