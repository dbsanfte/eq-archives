Boy was I <br/>\nwasting my time in the commons.. spent the morning there and here&#39;s what I<br/>\nfound..<br/>\n<br/>\nI can take lower elementals with a little difficulty, but honestly, not worth<br/>\nthe effort. When they pack they really can hurt (ie, I died a few times).<br/>\n<br/>\nDrakes are easier for me, probably the best things for me to kill..<br/>\n<br/>\nHaven&#39;t tried the snakes, was warned to stay away from them..<br/>\n<br/>\nImps, are risky, if I&#39;m at full hp/sp I can take one, usually, but barely.<br/>\nAgain, not worth the effort really.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe gypsy&#39;s hate me, so I can&#39;t sell to them and have to go back to Neriak to<br/>\nsell. Does anyone know if you can improve faction with them?<br/>\n<br/>\nThere aren&#39;t many people in the zone, and they&#39;re not very friendly/chatty<br/>\n(unlike people in the commons) so I had to learn a lot on my own..<br/>\n<br/>\nOh and the one thing I _do_ like is there is a lot more loot here. I was<br/>\nmaking maybe 2-5pp a day in the commons, I made that much in a few hours in<br/>\nLavastorm..<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks again everyone!<br/>\n<br/>\njspectre @ innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
