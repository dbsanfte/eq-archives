The above spell won&#39;t do squat for me<br/>\nso it looks like I have no L8 offensive spells at all except for Ward<br/>\nUndead, leaving me nothing but my pet for real help with non-dead<br/>\ntargets.  Can one of you instruct me how to use the VE spell and what to<br/>\nexpect from it?  I have cast it with no weapon, etc and all I see is<br/>\nblue gas and lots of wasted mana!  Also where do you direct complaints<br/>\nfor fixes where someone actually sees them and responds?  Or is this<br/>\nlike UO where one has little hope of success?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
