Basically you&#39;re summoning a<br/>\ndecaying skeleton, and you know how easily they die, right? Push on to level<br/>\n4 and you&#39;ll find your new pet much more useful.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; *********** REPLY SEPARATOR ***********<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On 5/18/99, at 7:27 AM, Mata wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Mata&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mata_eq@...\">mata_eq@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;So I have a problem,  every pet I have summoned has been L1!
