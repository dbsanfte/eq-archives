Does anyone know how to correctly use the Vampiric Embrace spell?<br/>\nI mean I thought it was like lifetap or lifespike (where you target your<br/>\nopponent and you steal his HP) but with this spell when I target a monster,<br/>\nI see I hand icon appear on my display and nothing else happens. Now I have<br/>\ntried to attack a creature and sometimes when the thing dies I get some HP&#39;s<br/>\nback but not all the time....<br/>\n<br/>\nDo I have to be bare handed for it to work or is there something I am doing<br/>\nwrong?<br/>\n<br/>\nAny help with this spell would be appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks in advance.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCilten<br/>\nLevel 10 Gnome Necromancer<br/>\nCazic-Thule Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
