Im <br/>\na DE in Neriak, well now bound in the FP necro guild so not as many zones. I <br/>\njust reached level 8 and am not completely happy with my spell selection. I <br/>\nam hoping my new pet can take a bit more damage since I got tired of taking <br/>\nmost of the beating up to this level. I use the /assist hotkey when I send a <br/>\npet into battle so I can easily swap back and forth from the mob to my pet <br/>\nto see when I need to jump in.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really really just need to know where/how I can get lesser shielding since <br/>\nI was looking forward to it. One person said its in the necro guild, well I <br/>\nlooked, another said its in the wiz guild, I looked there, heck I looked in <br/>\nevery guild in Neriak and nothing. Another person told me I needed a Paladin <br/>\nto get it for me, but if spells are lore items you cant trade them. Grr, I <br/>\nam just hoping someone can/will tell me where to get this and end my misery! <br/>\n:-)<br/>\n<br/>\nDarzi - Dark Elf on Veeshan of the 8th circle.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
