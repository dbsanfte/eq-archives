Load up on purity belts bind<br/>\nyourself to the docks sell them in Freeport(for 5pp or so), I sold them in<br/>\ngfay, had better luck selling them to PC&#39;s there at 5pp, or just sell them<br/>\nto NPC&#39;s in the Freeport Necro Guild. They sell for about 1pp a peice to the<br/>\nmerchants there, at least for my gnome necro. Those belts funded my FBR!<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps,<br/>\n-Araxen 24 Gnome Necro on Tunare<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: Trizzen Do&#39;Trevan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:trizzen@...\">trizzen@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am a level 16 necromancer, and I am completely<br/>\n&gt; broke. As of last night, I am worth 3pp and some<br/>\n&gt; change. Could you all please give me some ideas on<br/>\n&gt; getting money? Killing wisps is extremely boring to me<br/>\n&gt; since they take forever to track down, don&#39;t get exp,<br/>\n&gt; and with my luck I get a non-burned out lightstone<br/>\n&gt; once out of 10 times. Lavastorm is boring too since<br/>\n&gt; that is where i spent level 10-12, and dervishes are<br/>\n&gt; the same story since that was 12-14.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Any ideas, please? :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Darkmoon 16th circle necromancer.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; This list is basically unmoderated.
