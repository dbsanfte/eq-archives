I can accept <br/>\nthat if that is what it is, I guess I just expected more. There is not a <br/>\nsingle item I can think of that in the Planes for me that would make this <br/>\nenjoyable. Yes, my best items are there, but I would rather not have the best <br/>\nand just have fun I guess. I can get to 200 wisdom without, I just will have <br/>\nto hurt other stats and I wont be the most efficient druid as far as stats go <br/>\nor have the some of the things I have desired for a long time.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe basically spent 2 hours to get organized and ported, 1 more hour inside <br/>\nbefore first pull. Pulled to a corner for a few hours and supplied members <br/>\nwith a few nice items. It was just anticlimatic. I feel kind of cheated. Is <br/>\nthis pull to a corner it? I just don&#39;t find that fun. I felt like a bunch of <br/>\ncowards zone fighting without a zone ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess the best analogy I can make is its like getting a notice saying YOU <br/>\nMADE IT - YOU WON A MIILLION FOR MAKING IT THIS FAR! Then cashing in the <br/>\nvoucher and finding out it was pesos not dollars.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not trying to complain I just felt like it was a huge let down and <br/>\nexpected to be able to come to work today and tell my bard friend and <br/>\ncoworker &quot;oh my god we need to get you to 46, it was a blast&quot;. I cant do that.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
