It has been awhile since I was level 9 on my old server so what I<br/>\n&gt; did to get through those horrible levels 10 and especially 11 is a little<br/>\n&gt; hazy.  I know a lot of people say Skel Llrod; however, I do remember<br/>\ntrying<br/>\n&gt; to do that and remember him being camped, having lots of problems with my<br/>\n&gt; pet, and getting attacked by 20 giant rats and skels every time I tried to<br/>\n&gt; med.  So I have a couple questions:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1) Any other suggestions for levels 10 and 11<br/>\n&gt; 2) Is there some trick to pets and medding in Befallen or do I need a REAL<br/>\n&gt; tank<br/>\n&gt; 3) Are fire drakes in lava storm doable at 10 and 11 and more importantly<br/>\n&gt; are they good exp?... I went to lavastorm for the first time when I was 12<br/>\n&gt; and I remember all the drakes were blue to me then... Since they have a<br/>\nfire<br/>\n&gt; attack I&#39;m not sure if my pet and I could hold up for long.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks everyone ,<br/>\n&gt; Azerin<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; P.S. I know these kind of posts come along all the time... maybe we should<br/>\n&gt; make a Necro guide :)<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
