Basically live through the hell that<br/>\n&gt; is getting to backstab, then find another rogue.  I swear I&#39;ve seen two<br/>\n&gt; rogues on Karana do this and simply SHOOT up the charts.  They<br/>\n&gt; hit a yellow,<br/>\n&gt; sometimes a lower red mob from both sides and take turns backstabbing.<br/>\n&gt; Almost always the monster will switch targets between backstabs.  Its<br/>\n&gt; absolutely astounding to see this.  Granted it doesn&#39;t work all the time,<br/>\n&gt; but dual rogues (or multiple rogues even) is a sight to behold.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; \tI still think necromancers are the best soloing class (again, this<br/>\n&gt; without playing a druid, the class which comprises 90% of the people over<br/>\n&gt; level 30 on Karana, I really have to try it sometime).  They can<br/>\n&gt; do it all,<br/>\n&gt; they even have an okay healing spell (heal friend, drain enemy to regain<br/>\n&gt; hits, repeat).  At level 20 we just take off.  We get Expulse Undead (94<br/>\n&gt; points of damage to undead) and drybones and exhumed gnolls just start<br/>\n&gt; dropping like flies.  At 16 you can live very well in the Lavastorm<br/>\n&gt; Mountains killing elementals, rock dervishes, and lava crawlers<br/>\n&gt; till around<br/>\n&gt; 18 or so, then moving on to nastier undead.  After that?  Dunno, I&#39;ve only<br/>\n&gt; seen one level 25 necromancer and he&#39;s a KewlD00d powergamer thus doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; talk much.  I think things just get scary after that though.<br/>\n&gt; Research will<br/>\n&gt; be a primal pain in the rear, but it shouldn&#39;t be too bad.  They&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; increased the frequency of the component drops and I&#39;ve actually<br/>\n&gt; saved up a<br/>\n&gt; good 9 words/runes already onver this weekend.  I can use some of them but<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ll probably just start trading them for the spells I can&#39;t get.<br/>\n&gt;  My worry<br/>\n&gt; is beyond the 30th level fro Necromancers.  There are only two research<br/>\n&gt; books I know of and they only go to level 29 or something for spells to<br/>\n&gt; create.  After that there&#39;s this empty zone.  Oh well, we shall live in<br/>\n&gt; interesting times.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Malark on Karana </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
