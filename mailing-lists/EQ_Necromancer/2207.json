I could usually get him to<br/>\nfollow me with out sticking on my pet, and used my pet<br/>\nas a very effective dot, and would fear as needed. At<br/>\n22 any necro worth his salt should try to take the<br/>\nTreant in WK at the solo spawn, VERY good money and<br/>\neasy to risk to kill.  But great exp up to 26, and<br/>\nstill good at 27.  eqnecro.com is a good resource<br/>\n<br/>\nXiven Dryblood<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
