Could someone please share where they are to be found in<br/>\nsuch large quantities? I was told that the lava crawlers in lavastorm<br/>\noccasionally have them, out of 50 or so kills I found a single rune. I was<br/>\nalso told crocs in Oasis have them, out of about 25 or so killed I never found<br/>\none. Someone suggested I go to Lake Rathetear but suggested it might be hard<br/>\nfor me at level 18.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, would someone be willing to share where they find basic words in large<br/>\nquantities so I can practice my skills? Or is it simply my very bad luck to<br/>\nhave not found one yet (I don&#39;t even know what they look like..)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\njspectre @ innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
