I currently don&#39;t keep shielding and grim aura memorized,<br/>\nrather I cast and delete them, then repeat later when they wear off.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I&#39;m in a large group that is killing fast, I tend to use the low mana<br/>\nspells like siphon str and disease so I can do this to all MOBS. I like to<br/>\nkeep gate memorized for emergencies, my best life suck spell, my ward<br/>\nundead, and my best darkness spell as it slows the MOBs down if they are<br/>\nfleeing or if I need to flee. I also find dark empathy handy to emergency<br/>\nheal passerby&#39;s that are dying. I make a lot of friends that way. I also<br/>\nfind mend bones quite handy esp when I&#39;m soloing or in a group of 2 where<br/>\nthe other person is a wizard or other spell type. I also like the vampiric<br/>\nembrace as I can tank at the beginning of a fight longer, back out and life<br/>\ndrain, then tank again. That extra 25 tap 2 or 3 times some fights has made<br/>\na big difference a few times.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I have at lev 14 something like this memorized.<br/>\n<br/>\n1)Best Life Drain<br/>\n2)Vampiric Embrace<br/>\n3)Englufing Darkness<br/>\n4)Heat Blood (or if in lavastorm or big group Disease)<br/>\n5)Dark Empathy<br/>\n6)Mend Bones (or if in group with tanks siphon str or posion bolt)<br/>\n7)Gate<br/>\n8)Ward Undead<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish I had slots for fear and shadow step but I don&#39;t usually.<br/>\nAt lev 16 I see a lot of new neat spells. A new DOT. Feign Death. A spell to<br/>\nmake you immune to damage for a short time ect. I am at a loss as to how to<br/>\nfit all the fun spells in. I&#39;m happy in the sence there are so many cool<br/>\nspells I can sorta mix and match for the situation but its much more<br/>\ndifficult living with 8 spells at a time then when I play my lev 17<br/>\nmagician. I can mem and forget all my summon spells. My combat ones are<br/>\nalways less then 8. IE DD, AE, Gate, Damage Shield and I&#39;m about done with<br/>\nimportant spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was wanting advice from higher lev necromancers about what spells they<br/>\ntend to load and for what situations. Esp for the lev 16 and the 20th<br/>\nspells.<br/>\n<br/>\nSincerely,<br/>\nEloric Rank 4 Necomancer<br/>\nVeneficus Rank 5 Magician<br/>\n<br/>\nHumble Knight - MoltenLava - Mithannial Marr <br/>\n<br/>\n...
