I use it<br/>\n&gt;constantly while I&#39;m fighting. When you accidentally get two creatures<br/>\n&gt;instead of one, you need to be able to help your pet from taking some<br/>\n&gt;damage. I DOT the badguys, then step in so that when the mob faces me, my<br/>\n&gt;pet is striking their backs.

Your pet is dealing the serious damage at up to 46<br/>\n&gt;magical damage per round (I&#39;m level 18) but, my own 18 damage hitting 2 out<br/>\n&gt;of three times is nothing to laugh at either. In the course of a fight, I<br/>\n&gt;will dish out over 100 damage to the creature, which is significant, and my<br/>\n&gt;pet will hit harder and more often with the back attack bonuses. The<br/>\n&gt;vampiric embrace flare that happens about one in 5 hits is a godsend, and<br/>\n&gt;sometimes it flares so often that my health doesn&#39;t drop much at all.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Losing<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;health is nothing to worry about, either.

Combined with the occasional Life drain,<br/>\n&gt;there&#39;s nothing I enjoy more than good hand to hand combat. And on a final<br/>\n&gt;note, when my pet does die through poor tactics on my part, it&#39;s nice to be<br/>\n&gt;able to stand toe to toe with the beast and finish him off because I have<br/>\n&gt;good defence, offence, and 2HB skills.

Basically as far as anyone knows, the only<br/>\n&gt;&gt; thing DEX does is increase your ability to recover while spellcasting,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; THAT&#39;S IT.  How important is this?  No clue, I haven&#39;t researched this<br/>\n&gt;&gt; extensively.  Basically if this is the case then you probably don&#39;t need<br/>\n&gt;&gt; much DEX.  The REAL primary attribute is INT, through and through.  INT<br/>\n&gt;&gt; directly affects how much mana you have, thus how much longer you stay in<br/>\n&gt;&gt; the field before meditating.  We&#39;ve discussed this before, but basically<br/>\n&gt;&gt; having as much INT as possible is probably the best way to go.  After<br/>\n&gt;that,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; dumping your remaining points is up to you.  You aren&#39;t a fighter, so<br/>\n&gt;&gt; putting points into Agility seems useless, most monsters will be hitting<br/>\n&gt;you<br/>\n&gt;&gt; and hitting you hard anyway.  Same goes for Stamina, you&#39;ll never have<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; hitpoints of even a Rogue, so seriously what&#39;s another hitpoint per<br/>\n </span></blockquote>level?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; Say you&#39;re level 25 and have 25 extra hitpoints?  Well sadly level 25<br/>\n&gt;&gt; monsters are probably doing close to 40-90 points of damage per hit<br/>\n&gt;anyway,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; so MAYBE one more hit.  Don&#39;t get hit.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I might say its more important for wizards as they don&#39;t have pets,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; but they should be in groups anyway.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Basically I know one solid thing.  Multiples of 5 in your INT is<br/>\n&gt;&gt; good and the more you can get the better you are.
