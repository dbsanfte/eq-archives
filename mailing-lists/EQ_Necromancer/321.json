The one thing I want topoint out is<br/>\nthat. This is a pianear game. The first of its kind. They have nothing to go<br/>\nby. They are learing as they go. So as I se it. They are slowly makeing it<br/>\nbetter. It&#39;s been around for over a year know. But you have to rember it<br/>\nrealy only been out a little over a mounth. Its a baby. It will only get<br/>\nbetter. Have you ever boten a game and you liked it a little but it didnt<br/>\nmeet your standers. Well think how cool it is that the bugs in this game are<br/>\nslowly getting fixed. Also most roll playing games. I put about 40 hours to<br/>\n60 in them and they are done. God we havent even scratched the thing to<br/>\ncome. So use the # one vertue... we all know what that is, and wait.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
