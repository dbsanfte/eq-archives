Bah! he is my <br/>\npet I aint wasting no mana on him during a fight and my style of play is <br/>\nusualy to jump in and go some melee to so he doesnt take all the much damage. <br/>\n  I&#39;m now 22 and been playing in unrest were I cant go melee to well, they <br/>\nhit to hard, but your always in a group so again pet doesnt get hit to much.  <br/>\n<br/>\n    My Dark Brother Im surprized you didnt guess this one you had to have <br/>\nbought gate in the clerics guild.  Check near the bank in mage guild, first <br/>\nguy on the right he has are sheild line of spells.   Remeber unlike weaker <br/>\nraces in Neriak we are royalty and they would not dare strike you.
