There are guards all over the place. You&#39;ll never make it<br/>\nabove ground (you&#39;ve got 2 zones worth of Queynos to get through above<br/>\nground).<br/>\n<br/>\nI suggest you do this:<br/>\n<br/>\nGet off the boat and go left into an open marketplace (tho there are guards<br/>\nthere that guard the entrance) then turn to the right to leave the<br/>\nmarketplace. You&#39;ll see a smith on the left and a large structure straight<br/>\nahead and to the right. Enter that. Its the arena and its a PvP area. Work<br/>\nyour way down into the tunnels under that, and you&#39;ll find a grate with a<br/>\nguard behind it. He should be friendly to you (unless he hates Erudites). Go<br/>\nthrough there and you&#39;ll come to a large room with a bunch of doorways. A<br/>\ntrail of bones leads to one. Follow the bones into an area with a false wall<br/>\n(there&#39;s a bone arrow there) and you&#39;ll find yourself zoning into the<br/>\nQueynos Aquaducts. In there is the Necro/Shadow Knight Guild. After visiting<br/>\nthem, you can find your way through the aquaducts to a &quot;secret&quot; passage<br/>\n(everyone that lives in Q knows about it, of course) that leads outside the<br/>\ncity. Then you&#39;re safe!<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
