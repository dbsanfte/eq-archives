Upon<br/>\n&gt;turning in a shadowed scythe to Vurgo, he hands you a note and asks for a<br/>\n&gt;shadowed knife from the goblin headmaster in OOT, this was relatively<br/>\n&gt;simple, the headmaster spawns on the far side of oracle island.  His spot<br/>\n </span></blockquote>is<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;on the left of a hut that spawns 2 goblins, once I found him he seemed to<br/>\n </span></blockquote>be<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;a pretty common spawn.  The next item I needed was a mortuary fungus eye<br/>\n&gt;from unrest.  This was a pain in the ass...I got to unrest at about 2am CST<br/>\n&gt;and there were a total of 6 people there and I was the highest level by 15<br/>\n&gt;(39)  Needless to say...I was the only one going anywhere near the basement<br/>\n&gt;:(  my suggestion unless you&#39;re level 50 is to go during peak hours when<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;house is totally camped and bring a couple friends anyway.  The fungus<br/>\n </span></blockquote>spawn<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;pretty much near the end of the basement, near the ghost, in a couple pit<br/>\n&gt;traps in the floor.  The eye is a rare drop, and it took me a good 3 hrs to<br/>\n&gt;get one...maybe I was just unlucky.  As far as shadowed men go, once you<br/>\n </span></blockquote>hit<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;level 36 or so, you can generally pull singles from the camp, and once you<br/>\n&gt;hit 39, your pet can solo them ;) (one at a time of course) unless it&#39;s a<br/>\n&gt;cleric...then he might need a little nuke push at the end.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;This list is basically unmoderated.
