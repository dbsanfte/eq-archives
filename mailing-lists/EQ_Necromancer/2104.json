This is <br/>\na more an ultrarare drop than a rare one. The &quot;I can see it in their hands&quot; <br/>\nis not correct. I wish it were.  No reason to hail anyone to get the quest <br/>\nstarted that I know of, just go see him after you get the book. I saw the <br/>\nmost drop in WC, but last I heard the shadowman behind the tomb in MM Castle <br/>\ndrops it more often than anyone. Bad part is this is a hit on Temple of Ro <br/>\nfaction and a plus to Shadowmen faction so you should make sure your Temple <br/>\nfaction is great before you go this route. He is also the guy that gives <br/>\nanother quest piece, sorry its early I forget which, for giving him the <br/>\nflower you find in the tomb. Maybe youc an keep doing the flower quest over <br/>\nand over as you kill him and keep Temple faction alive. Yeah this is cheesy, <br/>\nbut I feel being a necro is no different than a car salesman. Get what you <br/>\nwant, lie cheat and steal as needed.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
