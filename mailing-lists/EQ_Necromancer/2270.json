Their","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-866757078\">Just wanted to point out, because it wasn&#39;t directly mentioned.  Giving<br/>\nyour pet fast 1h weapons won&#39;t do anything for you anymore, besides look<br/>\ncool.  Their delay is fixed, and their damage has a minimum.  So you can&#39;t<br/>\nmake them any faster (except with buffs) but you can make them hit harder<br/>\nby giving them the big 2h weapons.  The advantage pretty much falls off<br/>\nonce your pet starts to bash and kick.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is one other benifit of hunting down a magician for weapons at low<br/>\nlevel.  I &#39;believe&#39; if your under 12th level your pet will not be able to<br/>\nhit magicial only creatures.  While most magic only creatures will probably<br/>\nkick a solo necro&#39;s butt under 12th level.  If your in a group and want<br/>\nyour pet to provide additional damage killing wisps and such, you might<br/>\nwant to find a mage to get some summoned daggers for your pet.<br/>\n<br/>\nLomack<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;I would also like to point out that starting at lvl 39 pets will <br/>\n&gt;automatically dual weild so you don&#39;t have to give them weapons for <br/>\n&gt;this.  Basically, giving your pets weapons after 39 is wasting cash <br/>\n&gt;and weight.  However, there are certain circumstances where a weapon <br/>\n&gt;is very beneficial.  Procing weapons can add a bit to the damage your <br/>\n&gt;pet produces.  My favorite is the vellium weapons dropped by giants, <br/>\n&gt;dwarves and such in velious.  Since delay doesn&#39;t matter and after <br/>\n&gt;about lvl 16 dmg is irrelevant you equip your pet for effect on the <br/>\n&gt;proc.  If you are hunting in nejena or the hole get a couple of <br/>\n&gt;swords from your friendly mage as the ward summoned proc is a nice <br/>\n&gt;little bit of additional damage (about 41pts).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The thing is, at least for necro&#39;s, your pet is very effective <br/>\n&gt;without a weapon. So why waste the time, energy and cash on getting <br/>\n&gt;it weapons?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From levels 1 through 12 it&#39;s a good thing to get the biggest meanest <br/>\n&gt;2 hander you can loot.  This can dramatically increase your pets <br/>\n&gt;damage output.  At 16 you really need the high end 2handers like fine <br/>\n&gt;steel to even get a marginal improvement in damage.  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;/pet attack &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Maldain Demorte <br/>\n&gt;Level 55 Necromancer </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
