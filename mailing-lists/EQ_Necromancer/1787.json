The problem that I have with the spells are that they take <br/>\n&gt;strength<br/>\n&gt;away from you.  My outtings last a very long time before I go back to town<br/>\n&gt;and sell, so weight was a huge factor only having a str of 65, so when you<br/>\n&gt;take away 10, I would become encumbered and lose some agi as well, so I <br/>\n&gt;quit<br/>\n&gt;using the spell.  You are probably meleeing at this level too, so if you <br/>\n&gt;did<br/>\n&gt;want to use this spell, use siphon strength with it so that you are back up<br/>\n&gt;to your potential, but that takes 2 spells slots away from a lot of other<br/>\n&gt;more useful spells.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Vanelin Blackheart<br/>\n&gt;35th lvl DE Nec - Povar<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;From: Nat Russo [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nrusso@...\">nrusso@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;Sent: Friday, February 11, 2000 10:24 AM<br/>\n&gt;To: EQ_Necromancers<br/>\n&gt;Subject: [EQ_Necromancer] Question about Impart Strength<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: &quot;Nat Russo&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nrusso@...\">nrusso@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hi Folks,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I have a lvl 13 Necromancer on Solusek Ro (Mujahid).  My question deals <br/>\n&gt;with<br/>\n&gt;buffing your pet.  Has anyone here had any experience with &quot;Impart<br/>\n&gt;Strength&quot;?  Is it worth casting it on your pet to give him an extra 10<br/>\n&gt;strength?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks in advance,<br/>\n&gt;Mujahid<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;GET A NEXTCARD VISA, in 30 seconds!
