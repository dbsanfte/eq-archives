First, the<br/>\nsimple fact that when your computer is on, your always on the Internet (no<br/>\ndialing, no busy signals, etc.).  Secondly, it is a LOT more<br/>\nfaster...whether you are surfing the web, downloading programs, or playing<br/>\nEverQuest; you will notice a difference.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, with Road Runner, it does vary depending on number of people online in<br/>\nyour area (However, I don&#39;t find this to be a current problem), but Road<br/>\nRunner is under-going MAJOR changes right now.  Just recently they increased<br/>\ntheir bandwidth in Kansas City by 300% and other areas with other upgrades.<br/>\nSome of the best techs available for all your problems too.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo say the least...make the switch.

I was going to just keep my 56K dialup connection, but due to<br/>\n&gt; the phone wiring in the neighborhood (paired-back copper more than 15000<br/>\n&gt; feet from a substation) the highest connection speed I can get is 26.4K.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My question is this:  Other than the fact that a cable modem connection<br/>\n&gt; slows down with each additional person logged in, are there any known<br/>\nissues<br/>\n&gt; with running a cable modem and playing Everquest?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Secondly, will this faster connection actually benefit me in any way (with<br/>\n&gt; regard to playing Everquest)?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks in advance for the info.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Mujahid  26 Necro  Solusek Ro<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Get your money connected @ OnMoney.com - the first Web site that lets<br/>\n&gt; you see and manage all of your finances all in one place.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/3012/10/_/451101/_/957906364/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/3012/10/_/451101/_/957906364/</a><br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This list is basically unmoderated.
