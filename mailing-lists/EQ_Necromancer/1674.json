I have<br/>\n&gt;recieved several suggestions and basically narrowed it down two - skarana<br/>\n&gt;treants are cordelia minister (bard at nkarana wizard spires). I was<br/>\n&gt;wondering what yur guys opinions where? I think perhaps its a good idea to<br/>\n&gt;hunt cordelia until lvl 22 and then head to the treants in south karana-<br/>\n&gt;does that seem sensible, or should i just go ahead and do the treants - and<br/>\n&gt;if so does anyone have any tips for hunting cordelia and/or the treants?<br/>\n&gt;Now, onto questions about research - all ahs been going fine up until now<br/>\n&gt;and i have been researching many spells (infact I have several lvl 16 and<br/>\n&gt;20 nes for sale - any suggestins n where to market them?) but I am having<br/>\n&gt;problems with harmshield which i have failed 4 times! I have trained into<br/>\n&gt;research as much as possible at lvl 20, I have also practiced lt by making<br/>\n&gt;spells and seen no rise so I am guessing it is as high as it will go for my<br/>\n&gt;lvl - why shoudl i fail this spell so often? especially as many ther lvl 20<br/>\n&gt;ones are trivial to me. Also I am finding the words needed fr it difficult<br/>\n&gt;to get - words of refuge are quite common but I have no more words of<br/>\n&gt;absorbtion, they seem t be very rare, and was wondering where the best<br/>\n&gt;place to get lvl 20 and lvl 24 research words (i need the ones for my lvl<br/>\n&gt;24 pet etc.)? Finally, does anyoen have any inf on what the cap is for<br/>\n&gt;research at different lvl&#39;s? If nay of you higher lvl necros on solusek ro<br/>\n&gt;could give me a hand getting my spells etc. i would really appreciate it -<br/>\n&gt;thanks in advance - Malados soulkeeper lvl 20 gnomish necro on the Solusek<br/>\n&gt;Ro server.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;p.s. please excuse any typos especially those invlving an o r a missing o<br/>\n&gt;as the o key on my keyboard is screwing up<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;This list is basically unmoderated.
