Bah, I wont take this part to the message list.  Though<br/>\nit&#39;s interesting to note I&#39;m &quot;a prick&quot; because I don&#39;t like the game or<br/>\nvarant, and say so.<br/>\n<br/>\n        As for the game, I loved it at first, sure.  I read all the hype,<br/>\nlooked at all the screen shots, etc.  Had allot planned out, too, and all of<br/>\nit being role-play.  I dealt with all of the plans being squashed because of<br/>\nsome idiotic limitation or another, got burned a bit further when I found I<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t stand back and plan fights out and just had to rush in and start<br/>\nswinging (why are we magic classes?), or do the same with the pet.  But I<br/>\ndealt with it.  Then there&#39;s the problems with the spells, variant&#39;s general<br/>\nattitude towards the Necro class, and a ton of other problems.  Just makes<br/>\nme think they&#39;ve got  a big head about &#39;em and they don&#39;t really give a<br/>\nstink &#39;bout us players.  That&#39;s what ticks me off the most, not being free<br/>\nto come up with our own strategy or using our class to their full potential<br/>\nbecause of deliberate restrictions comes in a very fast second.<br/>\n<br/>\n        As for why it&#39;s important to see the number of your mana.  I&#39;m the<br/>\ntype of person who likes to plan ahead, _way_ ahead.  Deciding which spells<br/>\nto memorize, in what order to cast them, which to buy and not to buy, and so<br/>\non and so on.  The amount you have plays allot in this.  Say, for<br/>\ninstance... You have a total of 200 mana and you have 50 left.  Cost 45 to<br/>\ncast a certain spell.  You can either use a spell to get out of there and<br/>\nsurvive or cast that one and leave you with only 5mana left, and thus,<br/>\ntotally open.  Not knowing how much you have left, just a silly bar graph,<br/>\nyou go ahead and cast it.  Whoops, you just peeved out the mob, it&#39;s<br/>\nfrenzying you, and you&#39;ve no way to get the heaven&#39;s out of there.  I know,<br/>\nGate and such takes way more mana than that, but for an example it&#39;ll do.<br/>\nIf you&#39;d known precisely what you had, along with knowing how much a spell<br/>\ntakes (as we do, at least), you&#39;d have been able to very quickly figure that<br/>\nthe escape, was the way to go.  Besides, I like knowing.  The least they<br/>\ncould do is make it an option.<br/>\n<br/>\n        As for ruining play, I make it a point to be very helpful to others<br/>\nin the game, especialy to newbies and such.  I figure players have it hard<br/>\nenough without somebody making it a pain for &#39;em, may as well help.  I don&#39;t<br/>\nsee where that&#39;s ruining play. :-)  Just simply, I don&#39;t like Varant.  I<br/>\nthink I&#39;ll leave EQ, soon as somebody else comes out with 3D fantasy world.<br/>\nIt&#39;ll happen soon enough, but until, it&#39;ll &quot;have to do&quot;.  As much as I don&#39;t<br/>\nlike &#39;em, and as much as the world peeves me off at times, it _is_ a very<br/>\nnice chance to role-play (if you can find somebody to do so with) and I&#39;ve<br/>\nwaited a very long time for at least somebody to _attempt_ a real fantasy<br/>\nworld for your charecter to live in.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Mysk<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:XxKommiexX@...\">XxKommiexX@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Why do they have to put the actual number of how much mana you have? if<br/>\n </span></blockquote>you<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; can&#39;t cast the spell then you can&#39;t cast it. You know by testing, and if<br/>\n </span></blockquote>you<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; are any good then you already know about how much you can cast before you<br/>\n </span></blockquote>run<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; out. I think you need to just calm down, and then think about what you<br/>\n&gt; posted. The slogan is cool, and you obviously liked the game for atleast a<br/>\n&gt; little bit otherwise you wouldn&#39;t have bought it. Oh ya, if you don&#39;t like<br/>\n&gt; the game, quit. We don&#39;t need pricks like you ruining the play of others.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sarn, Veeshan </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
