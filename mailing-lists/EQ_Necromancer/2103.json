","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1239110602\">Thought I would just throw in some more opinion based on fact.  I <br/>\nhave DSL and wouldnt change it to cable for anything, but here are <br/>\nsome base facts on both.<br/>\n<br/>\nDSL - You get a dedicated MINIMUM bandwidth.  If you are closer to a <br/>\nthe switch, it will be higher.  (eg.  I have a 512K DSL connect, but <br/>\nactually my router trained at 640K down, 570K up)  Nobody else shares <br/>\nthat bandwidth with you and it can be used for anything (at least in <br/>\nmy case).  I can run any servers I want (web, Quake III, UT, <br/>\nwhatever) and my provided couldnt care less, because I pay for the <br/>\nfull bw usage 24/7.  I have also found that DSL is much easier to <br/>\nconnect more than 1 machine (at least with my service) because I use <br/>\na router rather than a &quot;modem&quot;.  The router takes care of the DHCP to <br/>\nall the boxes and just plugs into a hub.<br/>\n<br/>\nCable - You get a faster downspeed than DSL usually (unless you start <br/>\ntalking the 1.5 to 7Mb range that DSL can support), for a lower <br/>\nprice.  However, you are not guaranteed any minimum data rate because <br/>\nit is a shared connect.  Also, 90% of all cable carriers are now <br/>\nlimiting your upspeed to 128K with a X GB limit on outgoing data <br/>\n(depends on company...  eg. AT&T is where I am and they allow 3GB <br/>\ndata upstream).  Most cable companys wont tell you this outright.  <br/>\nYou have to ask.  Also, those same companies do not allow you to run <br/>\na server on your line...they all have a separate product line for <br/>\nthat for businesses and is quite expensive.  To run multiple <br/>\ncomputers on this setup, you usually have to buy extra IP addresses <br/>\nfor them or have one system proxy for the others.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, for techno geeks like me, DSL is better, but if you are just <br/>\nsurfing, downloading files, and playing MMPORPG&#39;s, cable would do the <br/>\ntrick.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Xurt Redbones / 34 Gnome Necro / Tribunal<br/>\n-Frobins / 14 Halfling Warrior / Tribunal<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@egroups.com\">EQ_Necromancer@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Cory Burns&quot; &lt;coryb@t...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; I agree.

When my<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; friends<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; are over on weekends I easily support 5 people<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; zoning, etc. at the same<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; time.  However I use comcast cable out of the<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; Detroit area, it may be<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; different depending on the company.  I believe<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; comcast has a very large<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; pipe<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; to the inet supporting their users. (Multiple T3&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; i believe)<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; I personally will try to avoid playing eq on a<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; dial up after playing on my<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; cable modem and friends DSL.  I can literally see<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; friends on a modem keep<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; backstepping while there connection catches up,<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; etc.  I have 1 friend that<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; has a key to my apartment and brings his computer<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; over to play rather than<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; deal with dial up.  :)  These are my experiences.<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; Don&#39;t think that you won&#39;t ever get lag though.<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; Sometimes it is just<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; server<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; side lag  (i.e.  Verant)<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; Talk to your friends online with Yahoo!
