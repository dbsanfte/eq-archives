The SCS comes off a named Evil Eye in<br/>\nBeholder though I do not remember its name either.<br/>\n<br/>\nI bought my WCS for 80pp while I was hunting Aviaks in S. Karana, awhile ago<br/>\nit was one the items of the week so they might be less now.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast week I was lucky and traded a Glowing Stein for a Staff of Writhing & a<br/>\nShield of the Slain Unicorn. I think the Staff is the best 1h blunt you are<br/>\ngoing to find (9/33 & 48pt Chaotic Feedback).  However it seems my 24th<br/>\nlevel wizard is not high enough to get the chaotic feedback to work<br/>\nproperly. I receive a message that my will is not sufficient to command the<br/>\nstaff. So for the short term I have banked it and switch to the WCS until I<br/>\ngain a few levels.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAljernon<br/>\n24th Level Wizard<br/>\n<br/>\nDrahkoth<br/>\n8th Level Necromancer<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Jon Fiedler [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fiedler@...\">fiedler@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, August 17, 1999 1:05 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [EQ_Necromancer] Questions about the Water Crystal Staff<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Jon Fiedler&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fiedler@...\">fiedler@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDo any of you know what MOB has the Water Crystal staff?
