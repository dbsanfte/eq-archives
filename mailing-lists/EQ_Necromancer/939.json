The first","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-71800992\">In a message dated 7/13/99 7:13:12 AM Eastern Daylight Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lachdanan@...\">lachdanan@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: wolfie &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lachdanan@...\">lachdanan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  I find that I must do my own Necro research.  I am L16, Gnome. Could<br/>\n&gt;  someone share the basic approach to research wirh me? <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Collect lots of words :) and then try research! :)<br/>\nYou also need to learn languages.<br/>\nThe first book is written in either Elder Tier&#39;Dal (Kobold) Or Old Erudian<br/>\nSecond Book is in Combine<br/>\nThird Book is in Dragon<br/>\nFourth Book is in Elder Dragon<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I know of one site<br/>\n&gt;  (URL) that has information on what words make what spell.  Would anyone<br/>\n&gt;  share any others?  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Only know of the one.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have access to lots of words.  I think I spend 1<br/>\n&gt;  training point in research (all that is permitted) , buy some book or<br/>\n&gt;  container, put words in it, and do some kind of action to make a spell.  If<br/>\n&gt;  it fails ( and I imagine they all do) words are gone? <br/>\n </span></blockquote>There is the book that the &quot;combining&quot; is done in.  Then there are 4 books <br/>\nwith spell components in them.  Each in a different language.  You will want <br/>\nto buy these (Or cheat and get the lists at the research site...)<br/>\n<br/>\nYou will have a list of 2 to 4 components that you put in the research book, <br/>\nthen click combine.  If you succeed, you get a spell.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; How do you store<br/>\n&gt;  same words (stackable like fish) ? <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Many words are stackable.  Some are not.  Some words come in both stackable <br/>\nand non-stackable.  It does not seem to make a difference which you use when <br/>\nmaking a spell.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  Where are best places, and mobs, to get<br/>\n&gt;  words?  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>I seem to find a lot on Aviaks.  BUT... you can find them on ANY level 16 or <br/>\nhigher mob, with a higher chance to find on casters.  You MAY find on some <br/>\nlower level mobs, but the chances are much higher on 16 and higher.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Do I have to be successful at making L1-L15 spells before I have a<br/>\n&gt;  hope of making L16 ones?  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>It only starts at level 16 spells :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Can I make L24 spells before I am L24?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You can, but your chances are not necessarily good.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  I need Restless Bones, Feign Death, and Aura Banshee.  Some say at least<br/>\n&gt;  the 1st and 3d can be bought from vendors but I have no idea where?  Is L16<br/>\n&gt;  way to low to make L16 spells?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Banshee aura is no longer available at a vendor (not that I know of at least) <br/>\n It used to be at the troll shadowknight vender, but is no longer.  The level <br/>\n16, 20, and 24 pet area available at the Troll Shadownight vendor in their <br/>\nhome city.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
