I thought they were<br/>\n&gt;higher level than that.  Playing a dark elf necro and binding yourself in<br/>\n&gt;Freeport is not something I would do, even if I killed &quot;one MILLION&quot; orcs.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My 2 cents as I am also search for a place to hunt at 14.  Lavasotrm is <br/>\n&gt;good-<br/>\n&gt;even killed several fire elementals and rock dervs.  But the place that I <br/>\n&gt;camped<br/>\n&gt;I kept getting trained by everything- Fire ele&#39;s, Imps, and even that <br/>\n&gt;paladin.<br/>\n&gt;Anyone know what level he is?  Anyway, I was zoning too much to make and <br/>\n&gt;good,<br/>\n&gt;consistent exp gains.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;By far sister island is the best place to hunt for xp and money &lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;BTW you would be killing sisters or Eroslilli or<br/>\n&gt;something like that.  a good thing to keep in mind is to bind yourself to<br/>\n&gt;Freeport in front of the vendor on the dock because you will be so loaded<br/>\n&gt;down you will hardly be able to move.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Show your ONElist SPIRIT!<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;With a new ONElist SHIRT available through our website.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;This list is basically unmoderated.
