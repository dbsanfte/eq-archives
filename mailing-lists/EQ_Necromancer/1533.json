It depends on your resources really: how","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1354829359\">I just blasted the guys on the EQ_Spoiler&#39;s list for asking this question,<br/>\nbut this list is the perfect place for it.  It depends on your resources<br/>\nreally: how twinked you are, or if you could even get some help from a druid<br/>\nfriend (My wife has her own account and is a lv 30 druid, damage shield on<br/>\nthe pet and a few heals and I could take a character from 1-35 in about 3<br/>\nweeks). <br/>\n<br/>\nHere is my plan to get you up to the mid 30&#39;s.  As a necro, up until you hit<br/>\nthe upper 20&#39;s you should be hitting yellow con mobs.  Starting at lv 9-10,<br/>\nto avoid spiders and  snakes because of the poison and the increased<br/>\ndowntime due to it.  At lv 10, you should be hitting Lions, Lionesses, YK&#39;s<br/>\nand Plains Cats, all in East or West Commons.  Once you get lv 13, Head out<br/>\nto OOT and start murdering the nuns (Sisters) there.  It&#39;ll be kind of hard<br/>\nto get there, and resting is tough because they roam a lot, but if you can<br/>\ndo this successfully, you&#39;ll work up to about 16-17 where you can move to<br/>\nlake rathe.  To get to the single spawn point, Zone in from Rathe mountains,<br/>\nand follow the cliffs left.  After a ways you&#39;ll see an open area with some<br/>\ntrees.  The single pirch is all the way at the end of the grass where it<br/>\nmeets the cliff. It&#39;s about a 5 min spawn.  Bring LOTS of bonechips.  You<br/>\nWILL lose a few pets if you are under level 18.  Use Clinging/Engulfing<br/>\nDarkness and Fear to stack your DoT&#39;s with impunity if you start to get<br/>\nweak.  Fear sometimes makes them run to the water, and they suicide, so only<br/>\nuse that if you have to.  Once you hit about 23 you can move to &quot;Thousand<br/>\nIsland&quot; (loc 1000, 1000) and take both the birds there, depending on how<br/>\ncrowded your server is.  Do this &#39;til 25.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people suggest doing the Hermit in south karana from 25-27, and that&#39;s<br/>\ngood if you can get in line for the guy, but I&#39;d suggest getting in the<br/>\ntreant group/s &#39;til you hit 30.  You will rake in enough cash to equip<br/>\nyourself pretty well if you&#39;re not already twinked.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 30, with your lv 34 spells in your pack, make a trip back to OOT.  This<br/>\ntime, kill either the named sisters, one by the tree, and one by the docks.<br/>\nStay along the shore and you&#39;ll be safe from the sisters in the buildings.<br/>\nThere is also a pair of dwarves by a gravestone (you will have seen these if<br/>\nyou hunted here from 13-18).  You can pull them solo.  Use darkness and fear<br/>\na lot on these, same as with the chickens in LR.  Once you hit 34, assuming<br/>\nyou weren&#39;t a total bone-head and forgot to specialize in alteration, start<br/>\nrooting the sisters.  DoTs now work about 50% better if the MoB is<br/>\nstationary, and your root will make sure they are. Start taking on sisters<br/>\nas fast as your mana will allow.  Done right, you&#39;ll go from 30-35 in about<br/>\n5 days.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not going to tell you where to go after 35, as I&#39;m there now and don&#39;t<br/>\ncare for hordes of necros showing up at my spots (nothing personal). But<br/>\nonce you get 35, if you&#39;d like to take a break from the monotony of Level,<br/>\nLoot, Repeat, then I&#39;d suggest worming into a group in SolB or Lower Guk.<br/>\nIf you don&#39;t have any good friendships built up when you get to that level,<br/>\nyour life will be hard, or you will just be under equipped.  It&#39;s all about<br/>\nthe group when you get in the 40&#39;s, and it helps if people know you&#39;re a<br/>\ncompetent party member.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nPhrost Icewraith, The ORIGINAL &quot;Wraith&quot; &lt;Disciples of Innoruuk&gt;<br/>\nLv 35 Necromancer, Cazic-Thule<br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n___<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 7<br/>\n   Date: Tue, 23 Nov 1999 10:36:02 -0700<br/>\n   From: Kevin Neal &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kevin@...\">kevin@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: A question<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere did you hunt at 9th lvl?  10th?  11th?
