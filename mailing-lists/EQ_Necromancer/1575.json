If everyone took what they<br/>\nhad found wrong with the game and did some kinda sit-in about it then think<br/>\nno one would do anything until the game was how they wanted it not how it is<br/>\nmade. This game is constantly going through changes, you knew that when you<br/>\nbought it, at least I did. If we push Verant to do something instead of<br/>\nasking them, they will most likely become upset and not do anything<br/>\npetitions are a good start. I don&#39;t know about you I felt that are nerfs are<br/>\nunfair maybe to balance us out I don&#39;t know there thought process. But I<br/>\nenjoy the game yes it needs work but also so do a lot of things. I say if we<br/>\nare going to be heard then lets do it civilly not like some barbarian. Well<br/>\nI get of my bone box and let you think about it. Anyone has anything at All<br/>\nthen email this list and we will go to the source outside the game and lets<br/>\ntry to make a difference.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Fletcher, Neal L SGT 224 MI BN<br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:FletcherNL@...\">FletcherNL@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, December 03, 1999 5:54 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [EQ_Necromancer] About Sit-Ins<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Fletcher, Neal L SGT 224 MI BN&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:FletcherNL@...\">FletcherNL@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, so a huge gnome showed up at the first organized sit in.  Now EVERYONE<br/>\nwants to have one.  Do you honestly think Smed is going to show up to hear<br/>\nANOTHER group of whining players, regardless of whether or not their<br/>\ncomplaints were valid?  No, he won&#39;t.  This would encourage people to hold a<br/>\nsit in for every damn complaint they had (Monsters attacking through<br/>\nwalls=Sit-in! Price for bonechips on vendors too high=Sit in!).  The more<br/>\nyou use a tactic like this, the less impact it has.  Smed was wrong to even<br/>\nshow up to the first one.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour best tools for getting something changed are phone calls and mail.  Not<br/>\nEmail, that&#39;s easy to just delete,  good old-fashioned U.S.P.S.. Which would<br/>\nyou pay attention to more, a bunch of messages in your Inbox, or 10 50lb<br/>\nsacks of mail being dumped on your desk?  /Feedback works well to.  It takes<br/>\neffort, not drama.  I play a necro, a high level one, and I don&#39;t feel that<br/>\nthis warrants a sit in anyway.  But it does need to be un-nerfed.  All a<br/>\nmassive newbie death fest will do is piss off everyone that&#39;s not a necro,<br/>\nVerant included.<br/>\n<br/>\nIMNSFHO<br/>\n<br/>\nThis list is basically unmoderated.  However abusive language will not be<br/>\ntolerated</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
