It is not that fast of a healing method.  Not unless they can<br/>\nbandage with bandages while they are lying dead too which I doubt.  At high<br/>\nlevels with Feign Death, Monks and Shadow Knights who also get the skill<br/>\nbecome some of the best pullers in the game.<br/>\nFeign Death also allows them not to die alot because they can feign death<br/>\nif trained, or if they are on the loosing side of any battel.  I hear the<br/>\nskill works fairly well at high levels.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;can anyone give me a guide for getting through rathe mountains from the lake <br/>\n&gt;rathe side to the feerot side?  thanks<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I am not sure of the most direct route.  I have seen a map of the zone<br/>\nbefore so that may work best.  My only recomendation is that if your going<br/>\nto follow a zone wall.  Make it the left zone wall instead of the right side.<br/>\nJust watch out for the sphynx that is along this wall.  However, I believe<br/>\nthe one on this side is the good sphynx.<br/>\nI went through this area a few times with Invis on.  Never had a problem.<br/>\nHere is the link to the map.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://members.door.net/enigma/EQ/antonica_imap.htm\">http://members.door.net/enigma/EQ/antonica_imap.htm</a><br/>\nJust click on the map you want.<br/>\n<br/>\nLomack, Knight Defender of the BCK<br/>\nMaster of Recruiting<br/>\nwww.bck.org<br/>\n&quot;The Crimson Knights&quot;<br/>\nFennin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
