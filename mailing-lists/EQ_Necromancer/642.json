Underwater around the dock, there<br/>\nis an entrance to the aqua ducts. Find that, and you&#39;ll be in the lovely home of the<br/>\nBloodsabers. Finding the shrine of Bertoxxulous shouldn&#39;t be too hard once you are down<br/>\nthere. Finding your way out is a little harder.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Lord Faileas<br/>\n<br/>\nJaded wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Jaded&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jaded@...\">jaded@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m going to try to meet up with them again, but I&#39;ve gotta be quick<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and get heck outta Quetos real fast..as soon as I land without runing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; into NPCs.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This&#39;ll be tough. There are guards all over the place. You&#39;ll never make it<br/>\n&gt; above ground (you&#39;ve got 2 zones worth of Queynos to get through above<br/>\n&gt; ground).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I suggest you do this:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Get off the boat and go left into an open marketplace (tho there are guards<br/>\n&gt; there that guard the entrance) then turn to the right to leave the<br/>\n&gt; marketplace. You&#39;ll see a smith on the left and a large structure straight<br/>\n&gt; ahead and to the right. Enter that. Its the arena and its a PvP area. Work<br/>\n&gt; your way down into the tunnels under that, and you&#39;ll find a grate with a<br/>\n&gt; guard behind it. He should be friendly to you (unless he hates Erudites). Go<br/>\n&gt; through there and you&#39;ll come to a large room with a bunch of doorways. A<br/>\n&gt; trail of bones leads to one. Follow the bones into an area with a false wall<br/>\n&gt; (there&#39;s a bone arrow there) and you&#39;ll find yourself zoning into the<br/>\n&gt; Queynos Aquaducts. In there is the Necro/Shadow Knight Guild. After visiting<br/>\n&gt; them, you can find your way through the aquaducts to a &quot;secret&quot; passage<br/>\n&gt; (everyone that lives in Q knows about it, of course) that leads outside the<br/>\n&gt; city. Then you&#39;re safe!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Good luck.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Where do some of the Internet&#39;s largest email lists reside?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; At ONElist - the most scalable and reliable service on the Internet.<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; This list is basically unmoderated.
