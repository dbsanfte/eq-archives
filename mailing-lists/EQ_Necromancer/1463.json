It was a 52 min spawn and more<br/>\n&gt; often than not spawns a regular Ghoul as a placeholder (PH).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; After 16 long hours of waiting in line (only 2 spawned) and getting<br/>\n&gt; the component off the Priest i made off to Najena to complete part<br/>\n&gt; 1 of the quest . unfortunately when i tried to give it to the NPC while<br/>\n&gt; invis , it broke the invisibility and i was charmed and killed by the NPC<br/>\n&gt; (who is a High Elf Enchanter btw) .<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Has anybody else attempted to complete this quest ?<br/>\n&gt; or does anyone have confirmation if quests can be completed<br/>\n&gt; while invis ? pls email me directly as I dont always get the time<br/>\n&gt; to read all this list mails...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; regards,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; KAEN<br/>\n&gt; Necromancer of the 30th circle<br/>\n&gt; on Erollisi Marr .<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; This list is basically unmoderated.
