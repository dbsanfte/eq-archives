Anything that gets the beast of you for a few seconds allows the<br/>\ntanks to attempt to drag it back on them.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAs for PvP, players respond much slower than mobs (probably because<br/>\nthey don&#39;t always know where you are all the time).  If you are duelling and<br/>\nthe nasty tank is in your face, you can cast this and usually get enough<br/>\ntime to cast another spell while he reorients, all the while getting beat on<br/>\nby your pet.<br/>\n<br/>\nMalark, Karana<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Shadow Panther [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shdwpanther@...\">shdwpanther@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, May 03, 1999 5:17 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [EQ_Necromancer] Shadow Step<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Shadow Panther&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shdwpanther@...\">shdwpanther@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;     I&#39;ve a question about Shadow Step.  I know it&#39;s a mini <br/>\n&gt; random teleport,<br/>\n&gt; but.. I have some misgivings about it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   I watched another mage, while invisible, casting their Shadow Step<br/>\n&gt; outside.  It was sad, they hardly went a few feet away from <br/>\n&gt; their original<br/>\n&gt; spot, and if they were being attacked, they could still get hit by<br/>\n&gt; whatever it was from where they went.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Though I guess, in a dungeon, it would be more helpful, or <br/>\n&gt; is that just<br/>\n&gt; wishful thinking?  Also, how long does it take to cast?  <br/>\n&gt; Faster than Gate<br/>\n&gt; does, or the same?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;     Thanks for the info folks.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ~Myskyra / Tunare<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; Tired of empty chat rooms and out of date bulletin boards?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a> <br/>\n&gt; ONElist: Making the Internet Intimate<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; This list is basically unmoderated.
