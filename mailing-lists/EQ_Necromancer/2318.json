I started a highlander and I&#39;ve only played it for a couple<br/>\nof hours but it seemed very slow going. Dont know if it&#39;s just the<br/>\ntown(Hamburton) I started in but there didn&#39;t seem to be much going on in<br/>\nthe area, monster wise. Suffice to say I&#39;ve only just started so I&#39;ll keep<br/>\ngoing and see how it goes.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome more questions for you<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Whats the best thing to do to level up quick, just hunt local monsters?<br/>\n2. My friend should be joining me in daoc soon to you get bonus xp for<br/>\ngrouping?<br/>\n3.

In DAoC even hybrids can make<br/>\ngood tanks. It also depends on your play style.  One thing that is really<br/>\ncool is that tanks can spec in shields. This not only increases the tanks<br/>\nchances to block, but also include shield styles. Its really cool to put<br/>\nyour block skill on a buddy that is close by and take shots for him, then<br/>\nturn around and use a shield style that may stun or have some other effect<br/>\non the person/critter.<br/>\n<br/>\nI play a bard in Hibernia, but my buddy places a Firbolg Hero (a pretty good<br/>\ntank) and he always puts guard, protect and block on me. Each of those<br/>\nserves a purpose. Guard basically allows the Hero/warrior type to intercept<br/>\narrows that were meant for another player so long as the player being<br/>\nguarded is close to the tank. Protect is VERY useful when placed on healers<br/>\nsince it basically transfers aggro to the tank. Block is as I stated above,<br/>\nyou use your shield to block shots for people.  Block and guard are REALLY<br/>\nuseful in RvR as well as PvE.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne VERY important thing to know about warriors and tanks in DAoC. They are<br/>\nnot meant to be MEGA damage dealers, they are meant to absorb/block/parry<br/>\ndamage.  There are other classes that are REALLY good at laying the smack<br/>\ndown, but at the cost of giving up some defensive capability.  Beserkers,<br/>\nMercenaries and Blademasters are REALLY good at smacking the living tar out<br/>\nof something, but they also will take more damage by default.  These classes<br/>\nare also known as dual wielding classes. While other classes like the<br/>\nNightshade, Infiltrator, Shadowblade, Ranger and Scout get a form of dual<br/>\nwield, they typically do not spec in it. The exception being the Shadowblade<br/>\n(I LOVE this class after my bard)  Instead of getting dual wield,<br/>\nShadowblades get a skill called leftaxe or LA for short. Dual Wield (Albion)<br/>\nand Celtic Dual (Hibernia) work differently than LA.  Dual wield has a<br/>\nchance to trigger, when it does trigger and it does hit, it hits for max<br/>\ndamage. With LA, it swings EVERYTIME, when it hits it does a percentage of<br/>\nthe max damage. So while you swing all the time when you hit its partial<br/>\ndamage...which is still VERY good.  Its usually only a few points off of my<br/>\nmain weapon damage, because I keep it pretty high.  Midgard is the only<br/>\nrealm that gets LA. Shadowblades, and Beserkers get LA.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo as you can see it depends on how you wish to play.  There are other tank<br/>\nclasses that you should also look at.  I really like the Midgard Thane. The<br/>\nthane gets a nice AOE DD spell that smacks big ole hammers on thy enemies,<br/>\nas well as a point blank AOE instant on a 20 second timer, a single DD<br/>\ninstant on a 20second timer, a castable DD and a STR/CON buff.  The weakside<br/>\nis they are a bit light on the HP, but are a TON of fun to play.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou may also want to checkout a Champion in Hibernia. I have a Lurikeen<br/>\nlarge weapon champ and he is soooooo cool. He is similar to the thane yet<br/>\ndifferent. Instead of DD he gets some nasty debuffs and a nasty DD instant.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically what you may want to do is to go to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://daoc.catacombs.com\">http://daoc.catacombs.com</a> and<br/>\ncheckout the spell lists and style lists for the classes you wish to<br/>\ncheckout. They also have some decent class discussion forums there. I read<br/>\nthem quite often.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know this is a bit of a long winded E-mail, but there is a lot to know<br/>\nabout the various classes. I&#39;ve personally found something to like in every<br/>\nclass as well as something not to like.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you would like to know more about a certain class and specing please let<br/>\nme know.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nOskar<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Stuart Thomson&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Stuart@...\">Stuart@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@yahoogroups.com\">EQ_Necromancer@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, February 20, 2003 4:52 AM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [EQ_Necromancer] just joined<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Howler,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I ordered it yesterday with the expansion and should get it Friday :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Just one question, Whats the best warrior type class to play?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Howler D.

I quit EQ well over a year ago.  Personally, I REALLY like<br/>\nit.<br/>\n&gt; I will be honest and say that I&#39;m not really fond of the dungeons that<br/>\n&gt; originally came with DAoC. They were weak at best. However, the new<br/>\ndungeons<br/>\n&gt; in the expansion are much better and much more EQ like. I always felt that<br/>\n&gt; EQ&#39;s dungeons were fairly well designed and they only got better with the<br/>\n&gt; expansions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; With that said, the main attraction for me is the Realm vs. Realm combat.<br/>\n&gt; Taking keeps and jacking relics is a total blast!  I have noticed that my<br/>\n&gt; friends that have tried DAoC have started on what we call the &quot;Co-op&quot;<br/>\n&gt; server. Basically, these are like EQ style servers and are PvE<br/>\nonly...pretty<br/>\n&gt; boring if you ask me.  Give a regular server a chance and I think you will<br/>\n&gt; like the way RvR is done. You won&#39;t have someone in your home town gank<br/>\nyou<br/>\n&gt; or people from other realms raiding newbie areas. Its just not setup that<br/>\n&gt; way.  If you play on a PvP server its a different story.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; RvR in my book is just awesome.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you have any questions please feel free to ask. I will be glad to help<br/>\n&gt; you out as much as I can. DAoC isnt perfect by any stretch, but it really<br/>\n&gt; suits me and my play style.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -Oskar<br/>\n&gt; 44th Level Hibernian Bard Extrordinare<br/>\n&gt; Gathering of Ancients<br/>\n&gt; Palomides<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Stuart Thomson&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Stuart@...\">Stuart@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@yahoogroups.com\">EQ_Necromancer@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, February 19, 2003 5:13 AM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [EQ_Necromancer] just joined<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Anyone know if Dark age of Camelot is any good?
