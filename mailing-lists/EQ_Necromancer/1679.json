Basilisks are white to<br/>\nred, and I can solo the easier ones and take any of them if I have a<br/>\npartner.  It&#39;s fabulous experience and mediocre loot (occasional bronze<br/>\nweapon), and never crowded that I&#39;ve seen.  The only downside is there<br/>\naren&#39;t many skeletons to donate bone chips.  I&#39;m down to my last 10, but<br/>\nhave another 100 or so in the bank, and I&#39;m also getting bogged down by<br/>\ncopper and silver coins.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I&#39;m hoping to avoid the run to Freeport (though I can gate back, so<br/>\nit&#39;s not that big a deal) As a height-challenged Bertoxx-worshipping<br/>\nnecromancer, I&#39;ve been pleased that I am (barely) accepted in Akanon,<br/>\nFreeport, and Neriak.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m KOS to the bouncers (but not the merchants) ouside the Ogre and Troll<br/>\ncities, so I presume it would be dangerous to go in.  Is it possible to<br/>\nuse a banker while invis?  If not, is is possible the bankers will not KOS<br/>\nme and the guards will be far enough that I could gather shadows, go in,<br/>\nbank, gather shadows, and leave quietly?  Has anyone done this?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf this is as bad an idea as it sounds, is there anything I should be<br/>\nkilling to increase faction in one of those towns?  It would be very handy<br/>\nto have a usable bank in the south part of Antonica.<br/>\n--<br/>\nMark Rafn    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dagon@...\">dagon@...</a>    &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.dagon.net/\">http://www.dagon.net/</a>&gt;   !G</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
