People say, they&#39;re <br/>\n&gt; breaking new ground.<br/>\n&gt; When you think about it, they&#39;re really not.  Take, for <br/>\n&gt; instance, Quake.<br/>\n&gt; Now, before you freak out and trash me on this one, they&#39;re <br/>\n&gt; really not all<br/>\n&gt; that differant.  They&#39;re both (able to be) played online, <br/>\n&gt; both have walls,<br/>\n&gt; both have water and land areas, weapons for swinging close or <br/>\n&gt; attacking from<br/>\n&gt; afar, etc.  Quake creatures, however, do not walk through <br/>\n&gt; walls, strike<br/>\n&gt; through walls, or any of that jive, and nor do other players, <br/>\n&gt; when playing<br/>\n&gt; over the &#39;net.  And they&#39;re both full 3D worlds.  I know, I <br/>\n&gt; know, EQ is a<br/>\n&gt; &quot;fantasy role-playing&quot; game, and quake is just a shooter, but <br/>\n&gt; the same basic<br/>\n&gt; concept is there.  Why does EQ have to treat water areas a differant<br/>\n&gt; &quot;world&quot;, or at least not have interaction between the two?  <br/>\n&gt; Differant engin,<br/>\n&gt; but learn from others, I&#39;m sure they could &quot;easily&quot; allow this.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>\tITs how games are made, things are always different.  Why does<br/>\nTribes have an issue with TNT OpenGl cards and their outside textures?<br/>\nDescent 3 doesn&#39;t?  Developers don&#39;t share all that much, thus you make do<br/>\nwith what you have.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;     True, however they need a distance limitation on it or <br/>\n&gt; something.  I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t want everybody walking around in plate and all carring <br/>\n&gt; 999 of all coin<br/>\n&gt; type, but let&#39;s not be paranoid about it..  This is <br/>\n&gt; especially troublesome<br/>\n&gt; for us Necros, with types like Holly Windstalker and such.  <br/>\n&gt; Hell, I was just<br/>\n&gt; walking through the zone and she apparently ran clear across <br/>\n&gt; the zone to get<br/>\n&gt; me. I never seen her, how&#39;d she even know I was there?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>\tDunno what happened there, did you attack her before?  I know if you<br/>\nkill a Neriak guard as a Dark Elf they HAVE to kill you once before they go<br/>\nback to being unagg.  This happens even if you zone.  Was she chasing<br/>\nsomeone else who just happened to train her into you?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n view though.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt;     I love the other views, but ironically I hardly ever use <br/>\n&gt; them.  The only<br/>\n&gt; duel I&#39;ve done is with a friend I know here in person, still <br/>\n&gt; both at very<br/>\n&gt; low levels but him about four or so levels lower.  Hehe.. <br/>\n&gt; poor guy, didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; stand a chance..<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;     As for using the pet as a shield, I do, and nor do I go <br/>\n&gt; nuts with the<br/>\n&gt; spell.  I hate being frenzied (*cough*befallen*cough*) by <br/>\n&gt; really big mobs,<br/>\n&gt; but that doesn&#39;t work quite so well.  I also trade hits with <br/>\n&gt; my skeleton,<br/>\n&gt; stop and life tap, etc.  I just don&#39;t have the mana to last, <br/>\n&gt; though.  My<br/>\n&gt; char&#39;s Int is 90.  At the time, I thought that was a big <br/>\n&gt; number.  Heh, yet<br/>\n&gt; again been bit by the instruction-booklet blues.. Too much <br/>\n&gt; work into the<br/>\n&gt; char, though, to start over.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>\tI&#39;m not a powergamer, but I would DEFINITELY start over.  Really.  A<br/>\nfriend of mine has an intelligence of 109 and he&#39;s level 21 and being hurt<br/>\nby it already.  At an INT of 90 you would have at level 20 400 mana while I<br/>\nwould have (INT 127) 540.  A 140 point difference.  Things start costing a<br/>\nLOT more too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt;     I&#39;ve yet to see any &quot;words&quot; or &quot;runes&quot;.  Perhaps I&#39;m just <br/>\n&gt; not killing<br/>\n&gt; the right creatures.  I&#39;ve thought about killing Lanshune <br/>\n&gt; Novashine (sp?) in<br/>\n&gt; Qeynos, as he walks around outside and I hear NPC spell-casters and<br/>\n&gt; intelligent mobs & such will have them, but I really don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; need the faction<br/>\n&gt; hit..<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>\tI get them from pretty much anything above level 12 creatures.<br/>\nEles, orcs, rock dervishes, lava crawlers.  Look for inherently magic<br/>\ncreatures.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;     So why have spells that can only be obtained there?  How <br/>\n&gt; are we supposed<br/>\n&gt; to get to them?  Have somebody buy them for us?  I don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; think so, they then<br/>\n&gt; want a cut of the money and you never know if they&#39;re really <br/>\n&gt; going to go in<br/>\n&gt; and buy it for you, or not, especially with evil charecters.  <br/>\n&gt; Supposed to be<br/>\n&gt; solo, but yet they make us rely on somebody else. ;)  I <br/>\n&gt; wonder, what with<br/>\n&gt; the griffens in the newbie area around Freeport and this, if <br/>\n&gt; the developers<br/>\n&gt; at varant just have that twisted a since of humor. *grin*<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>\tThey are there to keep people on their toes mostly.  I think one<br/>\nwould have been enough for that though.  If its one thing that&#39;s been<br/>\ndrilled into me since Day One, its being evil is hard.  Good guys get along.<br/>\nEvil guys do not.  Why should we let humans into our guild?  They suck!<br/>\nTheir paleskins, they should be killed on site for even attempting to<br/>\nimitate us in their pathetic way.  Sure they have their uses, but... ;)  See<br/>\nhow it works?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;     We can deal with the guild, btw, I&#39;ve heard others <br/>\n&gt; mention that they&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; been to the merchants once they got past the ghouls.  And I <br/>\n&gt; know I have Invs<br/>\n&gt; VS Undead, but I don&#39;t see why we&#39;d have to do that.  It&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; the Necro guild..<br/>\n&gt; *shrug* oh well.   For that matter, there&#39;s the shadow knight guild<br/>\n&gt; in..err..Oggok?..that there&#39;s a problem getting into, as well...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>\tSame problem.  Most Trolls are KOS in Oggok too I think.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt;     Yeah, you do, but don&#39;t forget the obvious things, or the <br/>\n&gt; point of the<br/>\n&gt; game; to have fun.  They seemed to have brushed the latter a <br/>\n&gt; bit under the<br/>\n&gt; rug in favor of &#39;knowing when to quit&#39;.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>\tAbsolutely.<br/>\n<br/>\nMalark on Karana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
