At 20th I put as many points as I could into it and researched my<br/>\n16th level spells at 24th I maxed my skill and did the 20th level spells.<br/>\nOnce I hit 29th, I looked for higher levels necros, usually around the next<br/>\nspell level to see if they had the spells and if I could buy them or if I<br/>\nhad the words, would they research them for me. I also max my research out,<br/>\nso that when I had all the current spells for that level , I would try and<br/>\nresearch them myself and give them out to younger nec&#39;s for free.  I have<br/>\nheard of too many horror stories of higher level necs trying to research the<br/>\nhard to find words only to fail and still have to work with a pet a spell<br/>\nlevel or 2 below them.  When I hit 34th, I found a 39th level nec that was<br/>\nwilling to combine the words for my 34th level pet and they also had COB and<br/>\nwave of enfeeblement.  For that I gave the nec 100PP as a donation, well<br/>\nworth it to be able to use my 34th level pet and cob at 34th level.  I am<br/>\nonly 35th right now, but already have all the words for my 39th level<br/>\nspells, so when I hit 39th, I&#39;ll find a high level nec to combine them for<br/>\nme and pay them quite nicely to make my spells for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nVanelin Blackheart\t<br/>\n35th level DE Nefromancer, oooops I mean Necromancer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Nat Russo [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nrusso@...\">nrusso@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, February 15, 2000 10:44 AM<br/>\nTo: EQ_Necromancers<br/>\nSubject: [EQ_Necromancer] Raising Research Skill<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Nat Russo&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nrusso@...\">nrusso@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHi folks,<br/>\n<br/>\nI am very rapidly approaching level 16 (about 2 bubbles away.....I&#39;ll get<br/>\nthere as soon as I get home from work today :) ), and am wondering about<br/>\nResearch.  I would very much like to do all or most of my own research.<br/>\nHowever, I also play a level 22 Wiz who has NEVER been able to successfully<br/>\nresearch ANYTHING.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there any way to practice your research without having to use the actual<br/>\nwords that we come across?  It seems like they are pretty hard to find (my<br/>\nWizard finds runes all the time, but they are rarely the ones he needs).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I&#39;m looking for any and all advice as to the best way of raising<br/>\nyour research skill.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance,<br/>\nMujahid  15 Necro  Sol Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nFREE ADVICE FROM REAL PEOPLE!
