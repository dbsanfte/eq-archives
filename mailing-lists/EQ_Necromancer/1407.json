Can an L28 and a<br/>\nL25 take the 4 together?<br/>\nCan we pull one at a time?   Thanks<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you zone in from EC, head northwest, the /loc I *think* is<br/>\naround -1600,500 or thereabouts.  They&#39;re down in a bit of a valley by a<br/>\nmonolith structure.  I highly doubt that a L28 and L25 could clear that<br/>\nspawn...I was soloing it for a while, basically target the highest /con send<br/>\nmy pet and dot the heck out of him...wait for him to die then gate,<br/>\nhopefully before the other 3 finish the pet and come after me.  I was<br/>\nsuccessful twice, died once, called for help :)  With a L35 nec, L35 warrior<br/>\nand L35 rogue, we cleared the spawn and all had about 2 bubbles of health<br/>\nremaining.  These guys are *tough* and way undercon&#39;d  Best to get a full<br/>\ngroup, with at least one primary healer, preferably 2, shaman buffs are nice<br/>\ntoo. :)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
