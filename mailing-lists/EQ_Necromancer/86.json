I finally just said screwit and waited until I hit<br/>\n8th so I would have the benefit of gather shadows.  The way I went from 7th<br/>\nto 8 rather quickly was basically soloing blackburrow.  There&#39;s so many<br/>\npeople in there it can be difficult to actually get a kill, but this also<br/>\nworks for you in that trains are pretty rare now, and when there is one,<br/>\nthere are many targets for them to focus on, allowing a hasty retreat.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Mark<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Brian G. &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bwgogol@...\">bwgogol@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Saturday, April 24, 1999 7:20 AM<br/>\nSubject: [EQ_Necromancer] Re: Level 7<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Brian G.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bwgogol@...\">bwgogol@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s *exactly* the reason I started Kagon, and haven&#39;t played my<br/>\n&gt; ranger since (except once, I feel kinda ..guilty and stuff..). I read<br/>\n&gt; your post and was mildly concerned since I was nearing 7 myself. Well,<br/>\n&gt; when I hit 7 last night...there was barely anything to fight! Ok, I<br/>\n&gt; may be overexagerating, but kodiak&#39;s were still yellow (I got<br/>\n&gt; slaughtered by one, thinking I was smart, but I was just<br/>\n&gt; ill-prepared), and now almost all black bears and shadow wolves are<br/>\n&gt; green. The only whites I saw the rest of the night was a tree snake<br/>\n&gt; and a skel near the ruins, which are camped like mad anyway. I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; thinking of taking a trip over to the Freeport area, maybe more stuff<br/>\n&gt; over there? Personally, I think Kagon would enjoy flaying a halfling<br/>\n&gt; or two, but the 2 locations he has been to so far are not suitable<br/>\n&gt; yet. =P *shudders at the memory of being burned to death by 3 halfling<br/>\n&gt; spellcasters and bludgeoned by 4 skels at the same time*<br/>\n&gt; Good luck!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kagon - Fennin<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: Pete Holmes &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:peh2000@...\">peh2000@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks to all for the responses.   I&#39;m looking forward to playing and<br/>\n&gt; getting to 8 and above.   It&#39;s funny, I started this Necromancer just<br/>\n&gt; on a whim when I got a little bored with my Ranger and I haven&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; played<br/>\n&gt; my Ranger since.   My friends in Kelethin are not pleased...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Saga-Mith.Marr<br/>\n&gt; _<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; _______________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Get Free Email and Do More On The Web.
