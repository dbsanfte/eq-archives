Before I go off and<br/>\nwaste money on spells that don&#39;t work, I was hoping to get some feedback<br/>\nfrom people on the list as to the best spells at level 8 to purchase and<br/>\nwhy.  Also perhaps if anyone could clue me in as to where in my area is a<br/>\ngood place to kill and how to apply the old and new spells to gaining xp and<br/>\nloot I would greatly appreciate it.  Thank you ahead of time!<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.<br/>\nDon&#39;t die twice right when you make a level.  I had made 8 and lost it just<br/>\nas quickly as I got it.  Didn&#39;t even have time to enjoy it before I was<br/>\nstruggling to get back to it :)<br/>\n<br/>\nDalthor<br/>\nLevel 8 Necromancer<br/>\nTestServer</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
