Though I think it would<br/>\nbe easier and faster to go with the first option.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, unlike the average race, Dark Elves like necromancers alot, so you are<br/>\nvery welcome in the city. This make early levels of being a necromancer<br/>\neasier. However, being both a necromancer and a dark elf will not make you<br/>\npopular outside of Neriak. Thus, I have elected not to go into ANY other<br/>\ncitys but instead hire people to do my shopping.<br/>\n<br/>\nEloric DE Necromancer (Rank 3)<br/>\n<br/>\n...
