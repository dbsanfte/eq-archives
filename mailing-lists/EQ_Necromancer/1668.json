Gorge hounds, Carrion Spiders, and Crag Spiders.  Crag Spiders<br/>\nhave a nasty venom.  If you use a pet, watch his HP after the fight.  Stay<br/>\non the north end of the zone.  I pulled to my pet sitting on the slope of<br/>\nthe border between the bandit camp and the Gorge zone.  I spent a lot of<br/>\ntime there and I was never bothered by anything there except once Droon<br/>\nkilled my pet while I was away pulling.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Also in EK is Milea Clothspinner who is never camped, but she doesn&#39;t<br/>\nspawn as fast as you would like.  Milea can be found on the valley floor on<br/>\nthe way to High Hold.  She spawns in a short tunnel and doesn&#39;t wander.<br/>\n<br/>\n  When you get a few levels, you can try Squire Wimbley.  You can take him<br/>\nwhen he cons yellow, but he hangs out with Sir Morgan who is 30th.  If you<br/>\nsee someone camping Sir Morgan, or you see a griff kill Sir Morgan, go for<br/>\nWimbley, he is pretty easy for a Yellow and great XP.  Squire Wimbley spawns<br/>\nby the bridge and waits a couple minutes before walking over to join Sir<br/>\nMorgan, this is a good time to kite him along the beach.  Wimbley has a very<br/>\nfast spawn rate.  You probably wont have enough down time to control his<br/>\nspawn before he walks over to Morgan.  2 necros can control Wimbleys spawn<br/>\nif you can get someone to give you a head start by killing Morgan once.<br/>\n<br/>\nDicey (Lived in EK for 4 levels)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
