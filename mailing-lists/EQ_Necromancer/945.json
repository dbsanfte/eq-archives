I am L16, Gnome. Could<br/>\n&gt; someone share the basic approach to research wirh me?  I know of one site<br/>\n&gt; (URL) that has information on what words make what spell.  Would anyone<br/>\n&gt; share any others?  I have access to lots of words.  I think I spend 1<br/>\n&gt; training point in research (all that is permitted) , buy some book or<br/>\n&gt; container, put words in it, and do some kind of action to make a spell.<br/>\nIf<br/>\n&gt; it fails ( and I imagine they all do) words are gone?  How do you store<br/>\n&gt; same words (stackable like fish) ?  Where are best places, and mobs, to<br/>\nget<br/>\n&gt; words?  Do I have to be successful at making L1-L15 spells before I have a<br/>\n&gt; hope of making L16 ones?  Can I make L24 spells before I am L24?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I need Restless Bones, Feign Death, and Aura Banshee.  Some say at least<br/>\n&gt; the 1st and 3d can be bought from vendors but I have no idea where?  Is<br/>\nL16<br/>\n&gt; way to low to make L16 spells?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Campaign 2000 is here!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Discuss your thoughts; get informed at ONElist.
