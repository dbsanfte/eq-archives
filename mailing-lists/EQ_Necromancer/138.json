Having recently acquired the the<br/>\n16th rank, I am experiencing some difficulty in finding the spells required<br/>\nfor my trade. I am a gnome necromancer who was born and raised in Akanon. I<br/>\nhave just returned from travels to Qeynos to purchase all of the level 16<br/>\nspells. The guild had:<br/>\nCure Disease<br/>\nCancel Magic<br/>\nShielding<br/>\nHeart Flutter<br/>\nShieldskin<br/>\nSpirit Armour<br/>\n<br/>\nRegretfully, the guild does not have<br/>\nResltess Bones!!!<br/>\nBanshee Aura<br/>\nFeign Death<br/>\nHungry Earth.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone knows where these spells can be found, please let me know. I have<br/>\nsearched all of Akanon and am losing the life that once drove me. My undying<br/>\ngratitude to any who answer the call.<br/>\n<br/>\nShaopaul</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
