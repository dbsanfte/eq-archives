The teleport is line of sight, so you wont go into or through a wall.<br/>\nSometimes it teleports 1 foot, sometimes 30, its a rather random spell, and<br/>\nbetter than nothing when a monster is raping you. It is best to use in<br/>\nconjunction with gate: Cast shadow step to get a bit away from enemy and<br/>\nimmediately start gate and it should get off before enemy can run you over :)<br/>\n<br/>\n----<br/>\n    I&#39;ve a question about Shadow Step.  I know it&#39;s a mini random teleport,<br/>\nbut.. I have some misgivings about it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I watched another mage, while invisible, casting their Shadow Step<br/>\noutside.  It was sad, they hardly went a few feet away from their original<br/>\nspot, and if they were being attacked, they could still get hit by<br/>\nwhatever it was from where they went.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Though I guess, in a dungeon, it would be more helpful, or is that just<br/>\nwishful thinking?  Also, how long does it take to cast?  Faster than Gate<br/>\ndoes, or the same?<br/>\n<br/>\n    Thanks for the info folks.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Myskyra / Tunare<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n____________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your own FREE, personal Netscape WebMail account today at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://webmail.netscape.com\">http://webmail.netscape.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
