When you talk to the guard and he tells you about his daughter Lucie.  Is this one of the myraid of broken quests?  I went into the area of the Aquaducts that they were speaking about, but just walked in circles and got annoyed.  I checked the walls for any that were illusions but didn&#39;t find any, though I guess I could&#39;ve missed a section.  Any idea about this one?<br/>\n<br/>\n    If the message is going to give any thing about a quest away, then the author can just add [Quest Info] or [Q.Info] in the subject.  That&#39;ll let people know who don&#39;t want to have anything given away, that they shouldn&#39;t read that particuler message.  Just an idea.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Enjoy folks, like the list.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Myskyra / Tunare<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Heath Barker <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Monday, April 19, 1999 10:07 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [EQ_Necromancer] (no subject)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Wow as the subscriber count climbs I would like to take this chance to welcome all to the list.<br/>\n  Is anyone against the sharing of Quest information in this list?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Heath <br/>\n  Aarkon Erudite on Povar </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
