Maybe you can make a trip to <br/>\nnectulos to bank (it is off the East commonlands)  but then.... the guards <br/>\nthere tend to kill humans, so I would check first (you may be excused being a <br/>\nnecro)  The bank there is in the Neriak Commons.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd a previous post mentioned the necro guild being in east freeport in an <br/>\nruined building.<br/>\n<br/>\nSonoroud</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
