At level 11 he shouldn&#39;t be<br/>\nmuch of a problem.  Make as good a pet as you can and just camp there and at<br/>\nthe SK site.  Very quickly you&#39;ll hit level 12 with a minimum of fuss.  That<br/>\nor head to Feerrott and go to three skeleton runes that are right next to<br/>\neach other, just watch out for trains.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAs for a guild I would be more picky, there are a lot of loser<br/>\nguilds out there.  I suggest making friends and playing a lot with them,<br/>\nmaybe even form your own guild or make friends with a good guild.  Do a lot<br/>\nof research, don&#39;t jump at the first chance you see.<br/>\n<br/>\nMalark on Karana<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: James [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:manickd@...\">manickd@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, May 17, 1999 9:37 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [EQ_Necromancer] level 11 loking for a guild!!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;James&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:manickd@...\">manickd@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Im at that dreaded level 11.
