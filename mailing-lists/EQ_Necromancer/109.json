I love this site totally.  Definitely spend an hour or<br/>\ntwo looking through all the information they have here.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAlso, followers of Innoruuk (most necromancers and stuff) are KOS<br/>\nonly in North Freeport where the guards are actually paladins.  Everywhere<br/>\nelse (cept don&#39;t go IN the fighter&#39;s guild, oh yeah, and necromancers are<br/>\nKOS at the Academy of the Arcane) you should be fine but most/all merchants<br/>\nwill not do business with you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAs for the quests, they are mostly lame.  The beetle eye quest gives<br/>\nyou a smidgeon of experience and a few coppers (wherea 8 beetle eyes will<br/>\nfetch you almost 2 gold).  The elephant horn and kerra isle beetle eye quest<br/>\nalso give less than useful stuff, but maybe I did them at a later level.<br/>\nAfter that I don&#39;t know... personally I found them all to be a waste of time<br/>\nunless you happen to be of an appropriate level (that level being anything<br/>\nless than 4, maybe 8 for Kerra Isle).<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI recommend staying on home ground till level 8, then heading to<br/>\nBefallen (or Unrest for Gnomes, but be CAREFUL there) and leveling to 12<br/>\nthere...<br/>\n<br/>\nMalark, Karana<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nmajsa@...\">nmajsa@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nmajsa@...\">nmajsa@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, April 27, 1999 3:27 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [EQ_Necromancer] Re: Necro Spells..?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nmajsa@...\">nmajsa@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Ok I am off to free port to try my guild task for Neriak. I <br/>\n&gt; have to deliver<br/>\n&gt; a message and get one to give to my guild master. Ok I know <br/>\n&gt; that I might get<br/>\n&gt; slaughtered on sight if I go the wrong places, but I need to <br/>\n&gt; know how well<br/>\n&gt; Gather shadows invis works. Also does anyone know where this <br/>\n&gt; guy is I am<br/>\n&gt; looking for?&lt;&lt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Let us know how it goes... I left Neriak as a 4th level Necro <br/>\n&gt; and have not<br/>\n&gt; returned (I&#39;ve been in Feydark).  Fortunately, I found the <br/>\n&gt; Human Necromancer<br/>\n&gt; Guildmaster underneath Freeport and have been able to buy <br/>\n&gt; spells or train when<br/>\n&gt; needed.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am curious about the quests out of Neriak and may head home <br/>\n&gt; if they are worth<br/>\n&gt; it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As far as the spell list I posted earlier, apparently it got <br/>\n&gt; cut off (onelist<br/>\n&gt; has a size limit), regardless, eq.stratics.com has a real <br/>\n&gt; nice list they just<br/>\n&gt; posted of Necromancer skills.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Are there any more decent Necromancer pages out there?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; Has ONElist changed your life?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Visit our homepage and share with us your experiences at <br/>\n&gt; ONElist of the Week!<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; This list is basically unmoderated.
