In places like most","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1381438922\">You won&#39;t see it yet because you are still in the newbie area, but<br/>\nthere are areas where your pet will have trouble standing still.  In places<br/>\nlike most dungeons (Unrest, Befallen, Cazic-Thule, etc) and a few open areas<br/>\nyour pet will... uhm... wander.  Basically there&#39;s something where it<br/>\n&quot;paces&quot; meaning it will move back and forth around you like a sick yoyo.  In<br/>\nsome places the pathfinding paths are so bad you can move five feet to your<br/>\nleft and your skeleton will make this LONG circle to get to you, often<br/>\nbringing back &quot;presents&quot; in the form of bloodmad mobs.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWant an example?  Go to Befallen and summon a skeleton, the front is<br/>\nrelatively safe.   You should see almost instantly what I mean.  Want a<br/>\ndeadly example?  If you somehow manage to get to the third floor at the<br/>\nbottom of the stairs you&#39;ll fight and elf skeleton and see a long corridor.<br/>\nIf you go down it and go into the left door you will find the deadliest of<br/>\nall pathfinding areas.  You can step into the room, but if your pet is<br/>\nplaying catchup (and believe me it will be) when you decide to move left<br/>\nnear the broken up area, it will take a brutal turn to the right, go through<br/>\nANOTHER door, down a passageway, right by Gynok Moltar&#39;s room, UP another<br/>\npassage, then come right back to you.  And thus the MONSTER TRAIN OF<br/>\nDOOM(tm) was born.  When I was level 9 to 12 I would get pissed at 3rd floor<br/>\nparties for dragging up trains that they couldn&#39;t handle.  Its only now that<br/>\nI realize that often its not their problem, its the game&#39;s.  Many a time<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen my skeleton pet take a hundred foot detour and manage to dredge up<br/>\na dozen nasty undead and spellcasters and I&#39;ve had to run to the exit,<br/>\nbelieve me, Feigning Death is not an option on the 3rd floor. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBut off that tangent, its also useful if you want to scout ahead as<br/>\nwell or maybe you want your pet to guard an area and you drag monsters back<br/>\nor whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBE VERY CAREFUL IN ORDERing GUARD MODE.  It applies to ALL NPCs.<br/>\nMeaning if you are near a city entrance and you tell your pet to guard it<br/>\nwill most likely decide you meant the guard and get itself slaughtered.<br/>\nalso remember that HERE is a relative term, meaning that if it attacks<br/>\nsomething and the victim tries to runaway, it will follow it then make a NEW<br/>\nguard spot wherever the victim died.  In my early days it was often I&#39;d<br/>\nbring back a wee beastie only to find my pet had chased a moss snake across<br/>\nthe zone, then picked a fight with a young kodiak or elite guard.  After a<br/>\nwhile if you see the &quot;TAUNTING ATTACKER MASTER&quot; message and you don&#39;t see a<br/>\nskeleton it was often time to run to the zone.<br/>\n<br/>\nMalark on Karana<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Mata [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mata_eq@...\">mata_eq@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, May 18, 1999 7:34 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EQ_Necromancer] Pet Question . ..<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Mata&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mata_eq@...\">mata_eq@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks Peter . . .      Does anyone know why I would want my <br/>\n&gt; skel to sit<br/>\n&gt; down?
