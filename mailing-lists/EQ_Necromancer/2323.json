Dont know if it&#39;s just the<br/>\n&gt; town(Hamburton) I started in but there didn&#39;t seem to be much going on in<br/>\n&gt; the area, monster wise. Suffice to say I&#39;ve only just started so I&#39;ll keep<br/>\n&gt; going and see how it goes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not very familiar with Albion as I mentioned earlier, I think if you go<br/>\nup the hill from humberton you will see a little pig farm that is good to<br/>\nhunt until you are level 5, its pretty slow though. I wish I had more Alb<br/>\nexperience but I don&#39;t. I know Hibernia the best followed by Midgard.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry I can&#39;t be much help to you there :-(<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Some more questions for you<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1. Whats the best thing to do to level up quick, just hunt local monsters?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The first thing you want to do is to hit level 5 so you can chose your<br/>\nprofession. Hunting the noob mobs is usually the best way, there are also<br/>\ntasks that you can do as well. Simply find a named guard, and say TASK with<br/>\nhim targeted. If he has a task for your level he will tell you what to do.<br/>\nIf not he wont give you one. You may have to find a few guards to get the<br/>\ntasks.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeep in mind, you need to see a named guard. Merchants have tasks too, but<br/>\nthey are usually Fedex tasks...take this to person in another town type<br/>\nsutff.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are limited to the number of tasks you can perform per level. Usually<br/>\nyou can get about 75% of a level via tasks. You will get money and exp for<br/>\nthem so doing them is usually a good thing. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 2. My friend should be joining me in daoc soon to you get bonus xp for<br/>\n&gt; grouping?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Not quite in the same way that you are used to in EQ.  Typically when you<br/>\ngroup there is the potential to pull more than one mob (as is the case in<br/>\nmost games) If you pull a mob that is linked to another mob(s) and you<br/>\nsuccessfully kill them all you get what is known as a &quot;group bonus&quot;. Its not<br/>\nbecause you are in a group its because you pulled a &quot;group&quot; of mobs. If you<br/>\nsolo and kill a group of mobs you still get the bonus exp.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a few more things about mobs in DAoC that you need to know,<br/>\nbecause I dont think they have an equivlent in EQ. (I could be wrong) Mobs<br/>\nin DAoC have what are called &quot;scout&quot; mobs. Basically these guys will see you<br/>\n(and you may or may not see them) and go off and get some buddies only to<br/>\njump you at the most in opportune time.  They will also do what is known as<br/>\n&quot;bring a friend&quot; or BAF.  Basically they tell their buddies to come with<br/>\nthem to kick your butt.  They also may not BAF in the beginning but as they<br/>\nget low on health they may, &quot;yell for help&quot; and then if any mobs are in the<br/>\narea they come running to help the mob you are beating on. This happens a<br/>\nlot in Hibernia with the water beetles (low levels) and its pretty much a<br/>\nnewbies first bad experience with BAF. All in all its not too bad. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 3. What sort of weapons and armour should I be looking to get?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If I were you and I was a full Alb Armsman tank, the answer is simple.<br/>\nPLATEMAIL. VERY COOL LOOKING. Just make sure you dont come across a Mid<br/>\n&#39;Zerker or a Hibbie Blademaster with dual wielding  blunt weapons. They are<br/>\nlikely to totally ruin your day. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is a REALLY good site with message boards for EVERY class. It may help<br/>\nto read up on what experienced people are doing with their Alb tin<br/>\ncans..er...armsman. (Sorry I can&#39;t help meself. I&#39;m a Hibbie ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Any help you can give would be great<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Cheers<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck...well at least until we meet on the battlefield then I will mezz<br/>\nyour sorry butt and let my tanks kill you! hehe<br/>\n<br/>\n-Oskar<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Howler D.

One thing that is really<br/>\n&gt; cool is that tanks can spec in shields. This not only increases the tanks<br/>\n&gt; chances to block, but also include shield styles. Its really cool to put<br/>\n&gt; your block skill on a buddy that is close by and take shots for him, then<br/>\n&gt; turn around and use a shield style that may stun or have some other effect<br/>\n&gt; on the person/critter.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I play a bard in Hibernia, but my buddy places a Firbolg Hero (a pretty<br/>\n </span></blockquote>good<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; tank) and he always puts guard, protect and block on me.

Block and guard are REALLY<br/>\n&gt; useful in RvR as well as PvE.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; One VERY important thing to know about warriors and tanks in DAoC. They<br/>\n </span></blockquote>are<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; not meant to be MEGA damage dealers, they are meant to absorb/block/parry<br/>\n&gt; damage.  There are other classes that are REALLY good at laying the smack<br/>\n&gt; down, but at the cost of giving up some defensive capability.  Beserkers,<br/>\n&gt; Mercenaries and Blademasters are REALLY good at smacking the living tar<br/>\n </span></blockquote>out<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; of something, but they also will take more damage by default.  These<br/>\n </span></blockquote>classes<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; are also known as dual wielding classes. While other classes like the<br/>\n&gt; Nightshade, Infiltrator, Shadowblade, Ranger and Scout get a form of dual<br/>\n&gt; wield, they typically do not spec in it. The exception being the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Shadowblade<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; (I LOVE this class after my bard)  Instead of getting dual wield,<br/>\n&gt; Shadowblades get a skill called leftaxe or LA for short. Dual Wield<br/>\n </span></blockquote>(Albion)<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and Celtic Dual (Hibernia) work differently than LA.  Dual wield has a<br/>\n&gt; chance to trigger, when it does trigger and it does hit, it hits for max<br/>\n&gt; damage. With LA, it swings EVERYTIME, when it hits it does a percentage of<br/>\n&gt; the max damage. So while you swing all the time when you hit its partial<br/>\n&gt; damage...which is still VERY good.  Its usually only a few points off of<br/>\n </span></blockquote>my<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; main weapon damage, because I keep it pretty high.  Midgard is the only<br/>\n&gt; realm that gets LA. Shadowblades, and Beserkers get LA.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So as you can see it depends on how you wish to play.  There are other<br/>\n </span></blockquote>tank<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; classes that you should also look at.
