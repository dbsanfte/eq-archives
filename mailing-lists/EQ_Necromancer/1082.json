Last night I was hunting at the Aviak<br/>\n&gt;Village (also on Karana Server), and suddenly a wizard was trying to steal<br/>\n&gt;my kill. Once he started casting on it I looked around for him and saw<br/>\n&gt;flashes in the distance. He hit the bird enough times for it to charge <br/>\n&gt;after<br/>\n&gt;him, so I followed the bird to his position. When I got there all I saw was<br/>\n&gt;the colorful effects of someone weaving a spell, but he was invis! The bird<br/>\n&gt;was also trying to swat something that was there, but it never seemed to<br/>\n&gt;connect. I was standing right in front of him watching this. I tried to<br/>\n&gt;target him - nothing. I tried to See Invis - nothing. No message at the<br/>\n&gt;bottom saying &quot;XXXXX casts a spell.&quot; Anyone seen this bug? I lost the kill<br/>\n&gt;and didn&#39;t even have someone to bitch at for it....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;From: Kent Anderson [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wart1@...\">wart1@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;Sent: Wednesday, July 28, 1999 4:49 PM<br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: [EQ_Necromancer] problem with leering corpse<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: Kent Anderson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wart1@...\">wart1@...</a>.&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Logged on today after last patch, used 40 bone chips and not one pet hit<br/>\n&gt;over 10dmg.  Yes it was leering corpse I was using. I&#39;m level 15 on the<br/>\n&gt;karana server.  I tried rememming the spell and I even cast the previous<br/>\n&gt;pet spell.  So my question is have necros&#39; been screwed again, is it a<br/>\n&gt;bug on all servers, a bug on Karana, or is my Char bugged?  Any help<br/>\n&gt;would be appreciated before I close the account and tell Verant where to<br/>\n&gt;stick it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Slortar,<br/>\n&gt;Karana<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Congratulations DALMATIANRESCUE.
