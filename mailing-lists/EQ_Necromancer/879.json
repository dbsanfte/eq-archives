So its easy exp. Then at 15 I went to<br/>\nthe lake and soloed Aviak guards. On a island that is know as the cave<br/>\nisland or the arina is land. There is a little tactic to kill them at level<br/>\n15 but if you sit in the cave for a bit you will see some one soon enough<br/>\ndoing the hide behind the corner and not get hit while you spell them to<br/>\ndeath trick. good luck!<br/>\n<br/>\nManick Deathbringer of The Necromancer Enclave<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: johnathan spectre &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jspectre@...\">jspectre@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Monday, July 05, 1999 8:39 PM<br/>\nSubject: [EQ_Necromancer] Hunting at 14..<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;johnathan spectre&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jspectre@...\">jspectre@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Arrgh..
