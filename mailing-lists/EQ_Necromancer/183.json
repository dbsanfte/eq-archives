If you haven&#39;t got the patch yet, you&#39;ll get a new EverQuest<br/>\nExecutuable and one other file.. and possibly the new manual.<br/>\n<br/>\n  When you get the next update, which will be tonight, the changes to the<br/>\nVampiric Embrace will be listed in the manual*.* file.  All I know at this<br/>\npoint is it says:<br/>\n<br/>\n===<br/>\n        &quot;9) Vampiric Embrace has been modified from it&#39;s original design to<br/>\nimprove game play.<br/>\n<br/>\n            ...<br/>\n<br/>\n        Tomorrow night, a revised version of the EverQuest Manual will be<br/>\npatched.  The revision will include a new section which outlines the spells<br/>\nand skills that have been modified from their original design to enhance<br/>\ngame play.&quot;<br/>\n===<br/>\n<br/>\n    That&#39;s 9 of 10 things fixed/changed.  Anyhoo, thought I&#39;d give you folks<br/>\na note about it.  Time for me to go play. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n~Myskyra / Tunare<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hoping the change has been worth it.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
