Directions to Guk: From the East","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1726241778\">Shadow .... here&#39;s a little info. Use it as you need. Please note this is info from MY<br/>\nserver, your&#39;s may be different.<br/>\n<br/>\nDirections to Guk:<br/>\nFrom the East Freeport map, zone into North Ro (or come through the tunnel from east<br/>\ncommons). Stick to the water side of the map (the left as you exit Freeport). Follow<br/>\nthe water until you zone. You will be in the Oasis of Marr. Again follow the water,<br/>\nstop to avoid Sand Gaints if they are nearby. Just wait ... they will move. Follow the<br/>\nwater all the way to the opposite end of the map. Run up the wall there until you<br/>\ncannot go any higher. Turn right and follow around the wall, then down behind those orc<br/>\ntents, then along the zone edge until you pass a large part of the mountain sticking<br/>\nout. There will be an open area between two mountains here that is the zone into South<br/>\nRo. Zone in. In south Ro, watch out for high level undead or madmen wandering the<br/>\ndesert. Follow the left hand wall ALL THE WAY around the zone. You will have to avoid<br/>\none Derv camp, and one Orc camp. Just go around them. You will eventually come to the<br/>\nother side of the zone where there is a valley leading to the Innothule Swamp zone.<br/>\nZone in to Innothule. Leave the small valley and walk along the left zone edge again<br/>\nalong the water. If you follow the edge you will eventually come to a large cave<br/>\nopening. This is Guk dungeon. If you pass that you will follow the wall around a bit<br/>\nmore and find the Grobb entrance (marked by Troll guards outside near tents and a<br/>\nfire.) Check your faction by conning them as soon as you see them. Bind any<br/>\nnon-spellcaster that is not killed on sight inside Grobb. Bind the spellcasters outside<br/>\nof Guk.<br/>\n<br/>\nTips on Guk:<br/>\nDon&#39;t leave the first two rooms until you know whats going on ... after that, don&#39;t<br/>\nleave an area more than about 5 rooms away. It gets very high level ... very quickly.<br/>\nIf you hear &quot;train!!!&quot; either hide, invis, gate, or run. Trains here are NOT to be<br/>\nmessed with. Don&#39;t use a pet. And for god sakes don&#39;t let any run away from you during<br/>\nbattle. If you see high level Froglok shaman, run ... don&#39;t even look back. It sucks to<br/>\nbe charmed. And that&#39;s all I have to say about that.<br/>\n<br/>\nTips on Equipment:<br/>\nGet as much woven here as you can, netted if you can&#39;t. Sell any mesh armor to monks in<br/>\nthe Freeport area. Netted is about 5 gold per AC point, woven is about 1 plat per AC<br/>\npoint, Mesh is about 1.5 plat per ac point.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes people coming from the Qeynos area will sell wolfhide armor pieces (only a<br/>\nbelt, boots, and a cape). Try to pick up all three pieces for around 10-18pp.<br/>\n<br/>\nTry to get a full set of woven except for a robe. Stick to your senior apprentice robe,<br/>\nor Thaumaturgist robe (from Befallen I believe). You can get a Flowing Black Robe later<br/>\nfrom Najena dungeon. Buy any +int player made rings, golden studs (+3 int earrings from<br/>\nQeynos), and a +int necklace. Why?? They give you direct mana ... the higher your<br/>\nlevel, the more you get.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are many nice specialized pieces for spellcasters ... Bracers, capes, gloves ...<br/>\netc. Look and watch for these. They can be quite expensive unless you can get them on<br/>\nyour own later.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor your ranged weapon (although please, please never throw it ...), you&#39;ll want a<br/>\ndagger of Marnek. The going rate is 15-20pp.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor your held slot if you use a one handed weapon you will want a Skull of Jhen&#39; Tra.<br/>\nThe going rate is 20-25pp.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor your main weapon if you have a piercing you will want a Dragoon Dirk, or later on a<br/>\nBloodclaw Stilletto. Dirk&#39;s go for 20-35pp, Stilletto&#39;s go for 140-200pp.<br/>\nIf you use one handed blunt or two handed blunt there are appropriate weapons ... but I<br/>\ndon&#39;t use them so I cannot help you.<br/>\n<br/>\nTips on getting money:<br/>\nYou might be thinking ... how can I afford this? For a DE necro ... two words, Sister<br/>\nIsland. Take the boat in Freeport to the first stop. Get off in the water and swim<br/>\nashore. Kill lots of sisters one at a time. Loot only belts until you can barely walk.<br/>\nGate back. Sell. Repeat as necessary.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck on your eqipment and your leveling. Please don&#39;t be afraid to post here for<br/>\nmore information if you need it.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Haytred, Erollisi Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nShadow Panther wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Shadow Panther&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shdwpanther@...\">shdwpanther@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     Ah, good.
