They may con the <br/>\nsame as HGs but are not nearly as hard. (Btw, anyone knows what level are <br/>\nthe Griffins in the Commons?) Cyclops in Rath Mountain can be done pretty <br/>\neasy too, but watch out for the wandering giant skeletons and other cyclops.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would wait on Hill Giants though simply because they have a huge amount of <br/>\nHPs and hit/stun really hard. A ranger friend and I are hunting them with <br/>\nrelative ease (both of us are level 35) as long as we get SOW before the <br/>\nfight. The tactic we use is ranger track and snare, I send pet in and Invoke <br/>\nFear, Boil Blood, VoS, CoB, VC, and reapply fear as necessary while the <br/>\nranger slash it from behind and reapply snare.<br/>\n<br/>\nNone of the above give much exp bec of the down time involved. But it is <br/>\nexciting to be able to extract revenge and HGs routinely drop upwards of 30 <br/>\npps plus the occasional FS weapon and Lambent Stone.<br/>\n<br/>\nUtendar of Veeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;so at what lvl can a necro begin to solo spectres? ive got some payback to<br/>\n&gt;hand out (oh yes, i remember every time i died... i have a long list of<br/>\n&gt;paybacks.  i still mutilate the occasional shadow wolf; im sure they like<br/>\n&gt;the shock of poison)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;also, there is payback coming soon for hill giants, sand giants, and<br/>\n&gt;cyclopses.  what are solo levels for those?  oh ya, and my major payback--<br/>\n&gt;Griffons!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;belphenor<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;From: &quot;Fraal&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mata_eq@...\">mata_eq@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Subject: Re: [EQ_Necromancer] Got to 34<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Date: Wed, 29 Dec 1999 11:52:51 -0500<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt; text2.html &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt; text3.html &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;This list is basically unmoderated.
