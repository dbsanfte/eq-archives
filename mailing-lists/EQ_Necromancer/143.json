Your trip from Nektulos to Inothule: Nectulos Forest (you know this) ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1234241756\">In a message dated 4/30/99 12:51:35 PM Eastern Daylight Time, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wgr@...\">wgr@...</a> <br/>\nwrites:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  Specifically what is the trip from Innothule Swamp to Freeport/Nektulos <br/>\n </span></blockquote>like <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and at what level is it safe to attempt..?  Also which zones will be better <br/>\n&gt; to explore as we go up in level (not planning to try and meet until we&#39;re <br/>\n&gt; about 5th so we both have gate spells)..<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Your trip from Nektulos to Inothule:<br/>\nNectulos Forest (you know this)<br/>\n<br/>\nEast Commonlands.  Low level area... if you make a LEFT out of nectulous (1-4 <br/>\nlevel monsters), Medium level if you make a right (5-12 level monsters).  And <br/>\nyou have to watch out for Griffons (level 34!!!)  There is some mixing... but <br/>\nGENERALLY if you stay by the road... you will be ok.<br/>\nDarkElf Necro.  you are KOS to merchants, guards will leave you alone<br/>\nOgre... not sure about the guards, you can assume the merchants are KOS<br/>\n<br/>\nNorth Ro.  (A tunnel in the desert wall of East commons leads to this)<br/>\nLow to medium.  You start out in the medium area, level 6 to 15 criters.  <br/>\nPlus the rare Giant (HIGH level)<br/>\nGuards leave the Dark Elves alone, merchants are KOS.<br/>\n<br/>\nOasis.  (Take a right as you leave the tunnel from east commons to North Ro.  <br/>\nGo all the way to the water, and take a right...)<br/>\nHigh Medum to Low High level.  Level 14 to 25 critters.  Rather dangerous <br/>\nplace, but if you runa nd are lucky... you will make it.  Watch out for <br/>\nGiants and Dry Bone Skeletons.<br/>\n<br/>\nSouth Ro.  (keep following the waterline to desert wall, then follow it)<br/>\nI have no info...  as you enter keep to the right... you will find the chasm <br/>\nthat leasd to Innothule<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd there you are, in innothule.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;      Ok.. Ramble aside what it boils down to is.. Which is better.. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Befallen <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; or Guk? Why? and what level should we hit the area?<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Befallen is better for low level players, but has the risk of high level <br/>\ntrains...  There are decaying, and plain skeletons on the upper level.  The <br/>\nsecond level you need to be much higher.  (about 12th)<br/>\nGuk Starts at a higher level (need to be 6 or 7) and trains badly also.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother reason is this.  Befallen is closer to Nektulos.  And In Neriak the <br/>\nOgre can get Shadow night spells, and train(I think... I know he can get <br/>\nspells at least).  In the ogre starting city, I do not know of a place to <br/>\ntrain or get spells for a necro.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  Thanks..<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sonoroud</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
