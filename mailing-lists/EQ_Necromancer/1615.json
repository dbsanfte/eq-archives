It stuns a creature for about 10-20 seconds.  Sometimes<br/>\nyou can stack 2 DoT&#39;s, sometimes you barely have enough time to get darkness<br/>\noff on them.  Still it&#39;s great for fighting casters since it stops their<br/>\nspells cold every time.  I actually prefer it to Root now.  Use ST, then<br/>\nDarkness, then VoS if you can get it off, then use Invoke Fear, and you own<br/>\njust about anything that doesn&#39;t resist the spells.<br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n__<br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n___<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 6<br/>\n   Date: Mon, 6 Dec 1999 19:18:33 EST<br/>\n   From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Aazen1@...\">Aazen1@...</a><br/>\nSubject: Screaming Terror-New effects<br/>\n<br/>\nSince ST is now a mez type spell, can you pile all your DOTs onto a<br/>\ncreature, <br/>\nthen mez it and let it just sit there frying?Can&#39;t test myself yet, cause I <br/>\ndon&#39;t get the spell for 3 more levels . . .<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance!<br/>\nAazen Sy&#39;Vex</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
