Essentially you have to fight level 8 monsters to<br/>\nget XP but you are using FOURTH Circle spells to fight.  At 8th though is<br/>\nkind of pissy too because basically you are relegated to fighting undead<br/>\nonly.  From 8 to 12 you are STILL using 4th circle spells for combat (which<br/>\nis absurd, but then Vampiric Embrace sucks) on normal monsters.  Once you<br/>\ndrag past 7th (I think I basically killed stuff south of the bridge in<br/>\nNektulos, running from kodiaks and halflings and just killing skels, large<br/>\nspiders, shadow wolves, and black bears), the first two spells you should<br/>\nget are Bone Walk and Ward Undead.  Ward is cheap because Clerics get it a<br/>\ncircle less, but Bone Walk will be a good 5pp I believe.  Once you have<br/>\nthose you HAVE to go to Befallen or camp at skeleton runes and temples.<br/>\nMost of the 10-12 monsters will shrug off your crappy 4th circle spells<br/>\n(except Poison Bolt) and eat you alive.  Go to Befallen and just work the<br/>\n1st floor till level 12.  Read my previous post about Befallen conditions.<br/>\n<br/>\nMalark Zaren&#39;Tul, Karana Server<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Pete Holmes [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:peh2000@...\">peh2000@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Friday, April 23, 1999 9:25 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [EQ_Necromancer] Level 7<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Pete Holmes &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:peh2000@...\">peh2000@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Just looking for a little encouragement, was Level 7 the most <br/>\n&gt; difficult<br/>\n&gt; for everyone?   I&#39;m struggling to get to 8, my pet doesn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; seem to help<br/>\n&gt; much and my Mana regeneration is very slow, even with <br/>\n&gt; meditate.  I know<br/>\n&gt; things get better at 8 but will every level like this (11,15,19 etc.)<br/>\n&gt; be this difficult?  Or is just me?  My ranger character <br/>\n&gt; advanced easily<br/>\n&gt; until he hit the teens so this has been frustrating.   Is grouping the<br/>\n&gt; only solution to problems like these?  Not my first choice....<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; Saga-Mith.Marr<br/>\n&gt; _________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Get your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; Looking for a new hobby?
