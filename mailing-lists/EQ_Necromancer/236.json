She&#39;s been slain by a<br/>\n&gt; merchant once, in her existance and that was just me being sloppy. (always<br/>\n&gt; always /con if you&#39;re a necromancer :) never know when some merchant is<br/>\n&gt; going to develop morals on you.)  So necro&#39;s are not necessarily KOS, they<br/>\n&gt; just have to be a little more wary.  The funny thing is, I made<br/>\n&gt; the journey<br/>\n&gt; to Freeport at level 8, and the guards there look upon her more favorably<br/>\n&gt; than the Qeynos guards, I suppose her evil reputation hasn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; spread that far<br/>\n&gt; just yet.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thank you<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Did you know ONElist has over 300 Star Wars lists?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Join one today!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; This list is basically unmoderated.
