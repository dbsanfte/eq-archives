Well, I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt;in a little bit of a bind.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I just started out and died when I finally reached my Guild house.<br/>\n&gt;Unfortunately I couldn&#39;t get my corpse and have lost my note I was<br/>\n&gt;supposed to hand to the necromancer there.  I hear from my friends<br/>\n&gt;that I should get a robe or something, but I don&#39;t have the note.  Is<br/>\n&gt;there any way to get a new note or something?  None of the stores<br/>\n&gt;nearby will sell me anything because I&#39;m a necromancer, so I&#39;d like to<br/>\n&gt;get this one.    Also is there anything else I am missing out on by<br/>\n&gt;not completing this quest?  I mean,  I&#39;m sure I can eventually find a<br/>\n&gt;robe somewhere,  I just don&#39;t want to miss out on a bunch of stuff.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanx<br/>\n&gt;===<br/>\n&gt;      ,,<br/>\n&gt;Shaithis<br/>\n&gt;   ,,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;ONElist:  where the world talks!<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Join a new list today.<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;This list is basically unmoderated.
