This will keep him<br/>\nfrom wandering off or &quot;guarding&quot; an area.<br/>\nMy problem with having a pet sit down is that they will not defend you if you<br/>\nare attacked (especially nice when your meditating).  If he is standing, he will<br/>\ndefend you.  Just watch out though, if you fight somewhere and he comes running<br/>\nto help, when the fight is over, you have to give the command &quot;/pet follow me&quot;<br/>\nto get him back to your spot or he will continue to stand in the spot that the<br/>\nlast action took place.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Kenneth Patierno &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kpatierno@...\">kpatierno@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n My favorate hunting tactic is to tell my pet to sit down<br/>\nthen I go out and &quot;tag&quot; a mob with engulfing darkness. I start running to my<br/>\npet about half way back i stop and cast heat blood then run to my pet<br/>\ngive the attack command and wait. When the mob finaly gets tehr it is down to<br/>\n1/3 health.<br/>\n             Trinnes level 16 necro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
