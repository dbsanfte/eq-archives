I would very much like to do all or most of my own research.<br/>\n&gt; However, I also play a level 22 Wiz who has NEVER been able to<br/>\nsuccessfully<br/>\n&gt; research ANYTHING.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Is there any way to practice your research without having to use the<br/>\nactual<br/>\n&gt; words that we come across?  It seems like they are pretty hard to find (my<br/>\n&gt; Wizard finds runes all the time, but they are rarely the ones he needs).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyway, I&#39;m looking for any and all advice as to the best way of raising<br/>\n&gt; your research skill.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks in advance,<br/>\n&gt; Mujahid  15 Necro  Sol Ro<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; FREE ADVICE FROM REAL PEOPLE!
