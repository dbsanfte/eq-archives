We had four necros with pets, and witnessed a<br/>\nmassive spawn. 2 clerics, necro and two warriors. They<br/>\nwiped us out pretty quickly. We made the mistake of<br/>\ntakeing out the necro first thinking he was the most<br/>\npowerful. The clerics kept him alive while the<br/>\nwarriors shredder our pets and ourselves.
