Can a level 16 necro<br/>\nwith a level 16 Druid hunt there, and what should we hunt for each<br/>\nsection of levels .. 16 -20, 20 - 24, 24 - 28.  I&#39;m interested in power<br/>\nleveling to 25 or so then heading to unrest to get savant cap and bs<br/>\ngloves. (and practicing my charm undead).  I realize this has been<br/>\nposted here often but my necro has been a secondary character until last<br/>\nnight when I got tired of heal med heal med die.  (Clerics are useless<br/>\nonce a  mob attacks them.)<br/>\nThanks<br/>\n<br/>\nSlortar,<br/>\nKarana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
