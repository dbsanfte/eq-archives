There are a few ones at the lower levels you will still use from time to time, line the invis lines, locate corpse, and some dots from the mid high 30&#39;s like scourge at times as well.  I&#39;d make a chart of the damage spells how much they do over what time, mana<br/>\ncost.  Also get a list of the pet commands.  Read up on necro strategies on that site and experiment yourself a little on some safe things.  There are probably more or better things you could do as well, but that is some advice of the top of my head.<br/>\n<br/>\n     -Jahet<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hiya all, my friend just quit the game and gave me his account. It has a 51 nec, that I don&#39;t know how to play hehe. He said he might consider coming back sometime in the future, so I want to try and get his necro to 60 by then =) I&#39;m totally new to a necro, but I do have a 49 druid. Any tips on the necro would be greatly appreciated. Thanks! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
