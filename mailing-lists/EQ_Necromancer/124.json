I call him the porta-tank. :)  If you get<br/>\ntired of these guys you can usually take down a white/yellow dervish<br/>\ncutthroat, and the occasional shriveled mummy.<br/>\n<br/>\n(this is all solo btw, if you add just one other person you can be a north<br/>\nro wrecking crew and take on darn near anything but the ghouls, sand giants<br/>\nand dervish thugs)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Mark</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
