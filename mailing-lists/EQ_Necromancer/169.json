At 12 you should be able to take a kodiak with<br/>\nsome difficulty, piece of cake with two necros, and there&#39;s DOZENS of them<br/>\nsurrounding the druid&#39;s mesa.  Once you start hitting 15 and 16 the<br/>\npreservers start conning yellow to you.  Be very wary of their stinging<br/>\nswarms and stuff.  They will help each other too and they are constantly<br/>\nrunning around so make sure you train one to a wall before totally engaging<br/>\n(though chances are he&#39;s cast a spell on you already and your pet is beating<br/>\non him)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSince I&#39;m not past 16 I&#39;m not sure what else is good after that.  I<br/>\navoid the super druid NPCs on the mesa but I don&#39;t know their level.<br/>\n<br/>\nMalark, Karana<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nmajsa@...\">nmajsa@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nmajsa@...\">nmajsa@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, May 03, 1999 11:09 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [EQ_Necromancer] Re: Necro at level 16<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nmajsa@...\">nmajsa@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;I just got level 16.
