I am L16, Gnome. Could<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  someone share the basic approach to research wirh me? <br/>\n&gt;Collect lots of words :) and then try research! :)<br/>\n&gt;You also need to learn languages.<br/>\n&gt;The first book is written in either Elder Tier&#39;Dal (Kobold) Or Old Erudian<br/>\n&gt;Second Book is in Combine<br/>\n&gt;Third Book is in Dragon<br/>\n&gt;Fourth Book is in Elder Dragon<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I know of one site<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  (URL) that has information on what words make what spell.  Would anyone<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  share any others?  <br/>\n&gt;Only know of the one.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I have access to lots of words.  I think I spend 1<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  training point in research (all that is permitted) , buy some book or<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  container, put words in it, and do some kind of action to make a spell.  If<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  it fails ( and I imagine they all do) words are gone? <br/>\n&gt;There is the book that the &quot;combining&quot; is done in.  Then there are 4 books <br/>\n&gt;with spell components in them.  Each in a different language.  You will want <br/>\n&gt;to buy these (Or cheat and get the lists at the research site...)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;You will have a list of 2 to 4 components that you put in the research book, <br/>\n&gt;then click combine.  If you succeed, you get a spell.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; How do you store<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  same words (stackable like fish) ? <br/>\n&gt;Many words are stackable.  Some are not.  Some words come in both stackable <br/>\n&gt;and non-stackable.  It does not seem to make a difference which you use when <br/>\n&gt;making a spell.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  Where are best places, and mobs, to get<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  words?  <br/>\n&gt;I seem to find a lot on Aviaks.  BUT... you can find them on ANY level 16 or <br/>\n&gt;higher mob, with a higher chance to find on casters.  You MAY find on some <br/>\n&gt;lower level mobs, but the chances are much higher on 16 and higher.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Do I have to be successful at making L1-L15 spells before I have a<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  hope of making L16 ones?  <br/>\n&gt;It only starts at level 16 spells :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Can I make L24 spells before I am L24?<br/>\n&gt;You can, but your chances are not necessarily good.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;&gt;  I need Restless Bones, Feign Death, and Aura Banshee.  Some say at least<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  the 1st and 3d can be bought from vendors but I have no idea where?  Is L16<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  way to low to make L16 spells?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Banshee aura is no longer available at a vendor (not that I know of at least) <br/>\n&gt; It used to be at the troll shadowknight vender, but is no longer.  The level <br/>\n&gt;16, 20, and 24 pet area available at the Troll Shadownight vendor in their <br/>\n&gt;home city.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;What is &quot;FRIENDS & FAMILY?&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;It∩┐╜s a new program at ONElist.
