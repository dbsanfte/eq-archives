When I got to 5 I left Steamfont. You CAN still find rogue clockworks outside the newbie area, but you have to constantly dodge young ebony drakes and things.<br/>\n   <br/>\n    -----Original Message-----<br/>\n    From: Mata [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mata_eq@...\">mata_eq@...</a>]<br/>\n    Sent: Friday, May 21, 1999 9:39 AM<br/>\n    To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a><br/>\n    Subject: [EQ_Necromancer] where do I hunt at 5th lvl?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    I made 5th lvl last night and my little gnome necro is doing fine, but I can see now I am starting to get too powerful w/ my big Skeleton buddy for the kolbolds.  They CON Black and when I was 4th I was taking on 2 yellows and winning! I love being a necromancer.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    Anyway where can I go to find L5-9 MOBs in STEAMFONT???<br/>\n<br/>\n    Thanks! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
