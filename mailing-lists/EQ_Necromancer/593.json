Dont ever tell your pet to Guard me unless you are 10 levels above everything<br/>\nin the dungeon.  By default, it is allways guarding you and if you are inside<br/>\nits &quot;range&quot; and you are attacked, it will defend you if you are hit.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. I prefer to just tell my pet to /stand up instead of Sit.  When you have it<br/>\nsit, it will take it a second or so to get up and start fighting... and a few of<br/>\nmy fights, that second is life or death.  Stand up does the same thing as /pet<br/>\nsit (which keeps it from following you).<br/>\n<br/>\nI do believe there is a difference in guard area from sitting and standing but I<br/>\ncould be wrong...</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
