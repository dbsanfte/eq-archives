I waited until level 8<br/>\nfor this reason specifically.  The guards in Freeport actually look at me<br/>\n&quot;apprehensively&quot; which I *think* is better than the dubious looks I got in<br/>\nQeynos, though I could be mistaken.  There are the odd shop keepers who will<br/>\nlook threateningly, I just make it a habit of conning every npc I come close<br/>\ntoo.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe necro guild in Freeport is in a condemned building in East Freeport,<br/>\nthrough (what else) a false wall.  There are nice maps of the 3 sections of<br/>\nFreeport on Eqvault under city guiles that I&#39;ve had open during my first few<br/>\ndays in this new city.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Mark<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Jason Kean &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jk211495@...\">jk211495@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, April 23, 1999 10:49 AM<br/>\nSubject: [EQ_Necromancer] befallen fun<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Jason Kean&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jk211495@...\">jk211495@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; hrmn....so off to freeport i&#39;ll be going it seems...where is befallen from<br/>\n&gt; freeport, never had a char there, always chose queynos ;-P  also, the<br/>\n&gt; townies there going to kill me on sight, or are necros at least remotely<br/>\n&gt; tolerated?  &lt;wondering if i should by the invis spell first&gt; and finally,<br/>\n&gt; whereabouts is the necro guild in the city?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Have you visited the new ONElist home page lately?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; ONElist: The Leading e-mail list and community service on the Internet!<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; This list is basically unmoderated.
