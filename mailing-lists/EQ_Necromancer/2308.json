I think if you are comming from the PC<br/>\n&gt; version of EQ, even if its been a while since you last played, that you<br/>\nwill<br/>\n&gt; probably be a little disappointed.  The graphics are ok, but the game play<br/>\n&gt; mechanics were just not my cup of tea.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Then again, I&#39;m sure they&#39;ve made huge strides since I last played the PS2<br/>\n&gt; BETA, so its probably worth it to try it out for yourself and make your<br/>\nown<br/>\n&gt; conclusions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I know its not much info, but its really all I have. I hope this helped<br/>\nyou<br/>\n&gt; in some way. :-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -Oskar<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;       Yahoo!
