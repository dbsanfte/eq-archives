Im level 17 now and it hit<br/>\nfor 23 or so hit points.  Ive only had it hit once per fight but I have a level<br/>\n16 wizard with me and we tend to kill things fairly quickly.  I tend to melee<br/>\nvery little and when I do, its only to pull something off my pet for a moment so<br/>\nhe can finish it off.  I see myself using the spell very rarely as I get higher<br/>\nsince the monsters are begining to hit rather hard and the lack of hit points<br/>\nand AC for the necromancer makes it tough.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
