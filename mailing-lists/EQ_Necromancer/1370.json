I have some strategies for necro<br/>\n  against caster, but how do you fight a warrior? The<br/>\n  necro could not get any of his spells of as the<br/>\n  warrior bashed/kicked/slashed him to death. The fight<br/>\n  took a while as the necro ran around without much<br/>\n  effect. End result, one dead necro, ogre at half<br/>\n  health. They only thing I could think of was sic pet,<br/>\n  shadow step, cast darkness, then proceed.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I guess I have two questions:<br/>\n<br/>\n  What strategy do you all use for necro vs warrior<br/>\n  type?<br/>\n<br/>\n  What strategy do you all use for necro vs caster type?<br/>\n<br/>\n  I am really curious to see what everyone says to this.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Thanks!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Darkmoon Somberlight<br/>\n  24th level necromancer Quellious<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  =====<br/>\n<br/>\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n  This list is basically unmoderated.
