You are told about<br/>\nit once you return the full box of fire beetle eyes.  This quest includes assembling<br/>\nmore beetle eyes, but from beetles that are only found on Kerra Island, you only need 4<br/>\nof those.  You&#39;re told that population of Kerra Isle is protective of those beetles,<br/>\nalso you&#39;re requested to bring a tusk of some elephant creature which roams the plains<br/>\nof west of Qeynos.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, there is a low-level (similar to menial tasks) quest in Freeport.  Don&#39;t remember<br/>\nthe details, but they are given once you hail the Necro guild master NPC underneath<br/>\nfreeport.  You really don&#39;t get much for it either.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:TkAdam@...\">TkAdam@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:TkAdam@...\">TkAdam@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I know of none in your lands.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There are two quests in Neriak<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Fire beetle eyes... which is only worth favor and experience, as the money<br/>\n&gt; given is less than the value of the 10 fire beetle eyes you have to gather.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Courier Duty... have not totally figured this one out yet, it entails travel<br/>\n&gt; :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sonoroud<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Show mom you love her.
