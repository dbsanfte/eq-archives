I tank more with my necro since I can heal myself and go in<br/>\nagain for more tanking.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever mages get NO self defense spells or skills. I am wondering which<br/>\nones are best and if you all have any tips for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nDark Elf Necromancers get to at some point or another.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Hide skill - Is this just press and pray? if something is charging me can<br/>\nI still HIDE from it? IE a sand giant attacks my skeleton can I press hide<br/>\nto try to survive?<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Root - At high levels we get root. Is it resisted by everything by that<br/>\nhigh level?<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Shadow step - How good is casting this then trying for a gate?<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Feign Death - Seems this could be great. Does this cast fast enough to<br/>\nuse in an emergency? Is it dependable enough to use to save the party by<br/>\ntaking on the monster why group flees then cast this and let the train<br/>\ndissolve? How long does it last?<br/>\n<br/>\n5. Gate - This is the only 1 of the list I&#39;m used to as magicians have his<br/>\nspell but it&#39;s cast time is slow.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre there any other survival skills I&#39;ve missed? Seems Necromancers may have<br/>\nan easier time of getting out of trouble then magicians do assuming the<br/>\nabove skills/spells are nice.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny help is appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nEloric<br/>\nNecromancer (Rank 2) Mythannial Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
