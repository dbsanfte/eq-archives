Also Gnomes just look neat most people see a DE and think evil, <br/>\nan erudin and thing Hmm what&#39;s he like, but a Gnome everyone thinks they <br/>\nare these little cuddly things till they turn around and become masters of <br/>\ndeath :).  One problem with factions though is it seems some guards will <br/>\nhave no problem with you and some will.  As a gnome necro in grob the <br/>\nguards on the left like me but ones on the right KOS me.
