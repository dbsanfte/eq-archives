Somewhere around level 20-24 due to bugs,<br/>\nincomplete projects, and other assorted crap the magician becomes utterly<br/>\nunable to advance after that.  For more information I would suggest signing<br/>\nup to the magician&#39;s list.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tIn other regards, being a necro isn&#39;t terribly bad.  Basically you<br/>\nshould beat on moss snakes and SAVE SAVE SAVE.  If you run out of food<br/>\nbefore level 4 I suggest you suicide someplace you can find again (or have<br/>\nLocate Corpse).  You don&#39;t lose XP before level 6 and you always get newbie<br/>\nfood at level 4 and under.  Eventually you&#39;ll grub up a couple gold and a<br/>\nbone chip or two (from decaying skeletons) and be able to buy Cavorting<br/>\nBones.  This will definitely hold you till LEvel 4 though the weak first<br/>\nlevel skel will sometimes frustrate you with it totally variable hitpoints (<br/>\nI think I once had a skel that took one hit from a beetle and died.).  Share<br/>\ndamage with your skel and double-team monsters.  Use your magic sparingly<br/>\nand rest often.  BE CAREFUL of reinfrocements.  Spiderlings and beetles are<br/>\nATROCIOUS for this behavior.  I recall many a time where I was beating down<br/>\na spiderling only to have 1, 2, or more join in and beat the crap out of<br/>\nyou.  NEVER attack anything floating.  Sometimes the spawning process gets<br/>\nscrewed up and more than one monster will spawn in the same place.  You&#39;ll<br/>\ncome across a beetle or skeleton floatin in the air.  This usually means<br/>\nthere are two there, though this is variable as well, since I&#39;ve gotten<br/>\nkilled by four wisps in West Commons since I thought there would only be<br/>\ntwo.  So, leave those alone.<br/>\n\tAfter that its a natural progression.  Try not to waste all your<br/>\nmana, spread it out, take hits for your skeleton and when you aren&#39;t<br/>\nactively hitting the target LOOK AROUND all the time to avoid trains and<br/>\nambushes from mobs.<br/>\n<br/>\nMalark Zaren&#39;Tul, Karana<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Murphy, Kenneth E.

I&#39;m a<br/>\n&gt; whole lev 2 at this point. I haven&#39;t trained any skills yet <br/>\n&gt; at the guild<br/>\n&gt; hall. Can I get some advice as to what spells to focus on? Is <br/>\n&gt; 2H staffs the<br/>\n&gt; weapon I should be using?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also at what level will I start to get a good feel for being <br/>\n&gt; a necromancer<br/>\n&gt; and start coming into my own? Are there any levels I should <br/>\n&gt; just gut out?<br/>\n&gt; For example my lev 15 magician had a very rough time at lev7 <br/>\n&gt; but at lev8<br/>\n&gt; things were MUCH easier. When I get lev 16 with my magician <br/>\n&gt; tomorrow or the<br/>\n&gt; next day I&#39;ll again see a HUGE increase in power. I&#39;m <br/>\n&gt; assuming Necromancers<br/>\n&gt; work the same way?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Any tips would be appreciated.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Eloric Lev2 Necro - Mythannial Marr -<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ...
