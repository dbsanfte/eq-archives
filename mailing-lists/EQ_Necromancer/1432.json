I did the boot quest<br/>\nthe other night with no problems. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs long as the robe quest is not screwed up, I&#39;ll be happy.  Breaking into<br/>\nthe area with the nokta shaman for a couple of 31 level necros is kinda hard<br/>\nfor the globe of shadows.  Luckily we found a high level nec to help after a<br/>\ncouple of hours.  It still took a few hours though to get 3 globes for me<br/>\nand the 2 other necs in the group.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow if the shadowmen would drop our items a little more, dropped 1 eye in<br/>\nabout 3 or 4 hours, and a couple of scythes.  They dropped quite a bit more<br/>\nfor other quests in that time; gloves or something for enchanters, rapiers,<br/>\nglowing stones or something like, wizard patch?? etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Trizzen Do&#39;Trevan [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:trizzen@...\">trizzen@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, October 27, 1999 10:13 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [EQ_Necromancer] Boots/glove soluske quest<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Trizzen Do&#39;Trevan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:trizzen@...\">trizzen@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone actually figured out the problems with<br/>\nthese quests?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd why in the world, when I identify the spectre from<br/>\nmistmoore, does it say spectre of sorrow when the NPC<br/>\nsays get the spectre of tears from mist and spectre of<br/>\nshadows from guk?<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkmoon Somberlight<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\n<br/>\nThis list is basically unmoderated.
