It&#39;s down in Innothule swamp next to the troll city.  There you&#39;ll<br/>\nfind tons of little froggies just dying (sorry for the pun, couldn&#39;t resist)<br/>\nto give you their woven armor.<br/>\n<br/>\nA warning, though.  Don&#39;t do it solo and check your pet with the coat girl<br/>\nat the door unless you&#39;re extremely talented at keeping it under control.<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen so many pet related train deaths in that dungeon that those cute<br/>\nlittle skeletons ought to come with a warning label from the surgeon<br/>\ngeneral.<br/>\n<br/>\nKaelrie (The Crimson Knights), DE necro on Fennin Ro.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Shadow Panther&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shdwpanther@...\">shdwpanther@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Greets,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   I am curious if they&#39;ve changed how you get Journyman Boots such as they<br/>\n&gt; changed the Oracle Robe to a quest (speaking of which, does he attack DE<br/>\n&gt; Necros?)?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     Also, if so how do I get started?<br/>\n&gt;     And if not, what dungeon is she in & where&#39;s it located?
