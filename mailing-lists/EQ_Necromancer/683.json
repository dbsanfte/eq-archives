All I have to offer is that you bounce around to much. If you saty in one place make friends that quest there and rely on eachother then you wil go further. This game was made to make friends. Sure at lower levels you it was a breez to solo. I hear people talk about the dreded level 7 and taking 2 weeks to do or more! Me it took 2 days. Level 11... 3 days. I could have done it ion 2 but I did a couple of dumb things... hehe. At level 13 I was killing dry bones with 2 other necro&#39;s. Oh ya and Ghouls. I allready have a pile of spell conponents. Also you have to find people that are trust worthy. So that the loot is split fairly. I got slaurted in guk also... but I spent enough time there because I wanted woven so badly. That I made alot of troll friends, and I know guk not so bad now. I have gone up the past few level just in there, and I am covered in woven from head to toe... ok not my toes.... no such thing as woven boots that i have seen. You need to find out what in a new aria you can kill.. and what will make you into necro meat pie....and theonly way to do that is to stickj around and learn the zone well over time. Hell I even married a trol on line because she is such a sweetie... and one hell of a warrior!!! Thats my 2 coppers....<br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n    I&#39;ve been stuck at level 10 for a week now! Its not as bad as the hellish level 7 (I was there for 16 days) but it is still bad! I tried Lrodd.... I am NOT doing that again. I beat him ONE TIME out of the several times I fought him, and for that one time I lost a pet with a twohanded sword, had no mana, and was at less than a bar of health. For all this, I got SO LITTLE XP THE BAR DIDN&quot;T CHANGE! And this was solo without a pet! The other times Lrodd just kicked my ass.  I&#39;ve tried WC but Kodies jump me and kill me while I fight YKs. I&#39;ve tried Kithicor, but the Ghouls jump me and kill me. I&#39;ve tried Nro and the xp is sooo bad there. Guk is a joke. Either too hard or too easy. Innothule is worse, its ALL green there. The orc camps are worthless. I can&#39;t find a group to hunt with, so the Dervishes are out.  EC I tried (again) and while fighting a lion a Cent jumped me. I ran past 4 people macroing &quot;HELP ME!! HELP ME!!&quot; and they did nothing. The cent got me. I went back out, fought a blue lion, and an even one came up and attacked my pet. I gated away and logged, utterly frustrated at having lost a bar and a half of xp in two days. If I keep up like this, I am going to be level 9 AGAIN. Please, someone help me! Where can I hunt solo w/pet at level 10?!<br/>\n     <br/>\n    Vaelthek</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
