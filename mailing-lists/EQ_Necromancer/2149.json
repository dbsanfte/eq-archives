The mutant eye fungus<br/>\nthing was also pretty easily attainable for my ranger, especially since I<br/>\nwas being escorted by a lvl50 druid.  As far as the shadowed scythe, I just<br/>\nhappened upon a group that was camping them and they were kind enough to<br/>\nallow me that 1 particular loot.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to where to find the goblin headmaster, I stumbled upon his island after<br/>\na cyc camping session.  If I remember correctly, the island isn&#39;t too far<br/>\nfrom the sister isle, it&#39;s easily recognized as it&#39;s 1 of the few goblin<br/>\nislands in OOT.<br/>\n<br/>\nZ<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Mark Rafn &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dagon@...\">dagon@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@egroups.com\">EQ_Necromancer@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, June 12, 2000 2:29 PM<br/>\nSubject: [EQ_Necromancer] L30, now what?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Made L30 this weekend, have a few questions:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1) any hints on the SolRo quests beyond what&#39;s on Allakhazam&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://everquest.allakhazam.com/quests/Q_Temple_Solusek.htm)\">http://everquest.allakhazam.com/quests/Q_Temple_Solusek.htm)</a>?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; For the Harvester, I need a shadowed knife, which is from a goblin in OOT<br/>\n&gt; rather than a shadowed man.  Where in OOT can I find the goblin<br/>\n&gt; headmaster?  Is he soloable at 30?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Any thoughts on shadow men?  Do all the items drop randomly off all the<br/>\n&gt; shadow men, or are there better places than others to find the shadowed<br/>\n&gt; scythe and eye/hand/mask of shadow.  Are there any camps that are<br/>\n&gt; soloable or takable by a pair/trio, or will I need a full group?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 2) where&#39;s good hunting (and good groups) at L30?  Sarnaks, goblins, and<br/>\n&gt; forest giants in Warsliks and Lake of Ill Omen have been great from 20-29,<br/>\n&gt; and it was always easy to find or start a decent group. Now those spots<br/>\n&gt; are starting to green out.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I came back to the old world at 30 to try some of my old haunts, but both<br/>\n&gt; cazic-thule and unrest have been very disappointing.  The unrest basement<br/>\n&gt; wasn&#39;t bad except for the powerlevellers (2 different L50+ druids<br/>\n&gt; levelling L20-L25 people) pulling past us and causing havoc.  Cazic would<br/>\n&gt; be nice, except the three groups I found all had at least one complete<br/>\n&gt; idiot in them, and we spent more time zoning/dieing than fighting.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Any advice appreciated.  I don&#39;t like soloing very much (too much<br/>\n&gt; downtime, not enough interaction, and no chance to use our best abilities<br/>\n&gt; like shadow compact and screaming terror), but I&#39;ll consider it since<br/>\n&gt; downtime in a bad group is worse than soloing.<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Mark Rafn    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dagon@...\">dagon@...</a>    &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.dagon.net/\">http://www.dagon.net/</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Get a NextCard Visa, in 30 seconds!<br/>\n&gt; 1.
