In order for the game to be playable whenever I&#39;m in<br/>\n&gt; Kunark, I have to COMPLETELY lower the clipping plane, and change some of<br/>\n&gt; the other settings (like particle density, etc).

The old continent is no speed demon, but is somewhat better.<br/>\nOther 3D games (Quake, half-life) display well over 50fps at 1024x768x32,<br/>\nbut Kunark has noticeable refresh delay - my guess is 10fps at 800x600 in<br/>\nan open area, and no more than 5 in Warsliks with the clipping slider at<br/>\nhalf and 640x480.  These are guesses, as there&#39;s no timedemo function for<br/>\nEQ.  I think I can get it below 1 frame per second at 1024x768 with the<br/>\nclipping plane all the way out.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is strictly rendering (and perhaps memory-to-graphics) speed - the hard<br/>\ndrive isn&#39;t getting used during this time and network traffic is pretty<br/>\nlow over my DSL line while doing these tests in a near-empty zone.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So tell me...did Verant just COMPLETELY drop the ball on the minimum system<br/>\n&gt; requirements?

The only real<br/>\nevidence I have is that half the features (gamma, mipmapping) don&#39;t work<br/>\nexcept in Glide mode, and the fact that Voodoo owners seem to complain<br/>\nless than TNT owners about speed.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSomeday I&#39;ll have to take my Banshee card out of my Linux box to try EQ on<br/>\nit.  My fear is it&#39;ll be faster than the TNT2 card for EQ, and much slower<br/>\nfor every other game on the planet.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone have any more concrete data on Glide vs DirectX speed in EQ?  I&#39;d<br/>\nlove to hear that it&#39;s just something I&#39;ve set up wrong.  Alternately, I&#39;d<br/>\nperhaps be willing to go buy a Voodoo3 card if I knew for sure it would<br/>\nmake Kunark a lot better.<br/>\n--<br/>\nMark Rafn    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dagon@...\">dagon@...</a>    &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.dagon.net/\">http://www.dagon.net/</a>&gt;   !G</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
