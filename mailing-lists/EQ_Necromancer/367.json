My Necro certainly <br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t know where<br/>\n&gt; that creature went, he just knows.. he smacked it with a <br/>\n&gt; spell and suddenly<br/>\n&gt; it ducked behind a wall. Is it coming around from behind? Or <br/>\n&gt; maybe it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; rushing at him through the shadows..  certainly, if the <br/>\n&gt; creature took off<br/>\n&gt; running to the other side of the zone, I&#39;d have to do some <br/>\n&gt; serious looking<br/>\n&gt; to find it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;     So, I think it&#39;d be a good idea to only have certain <br/>\n&gt; creatures have the<br/>\n&gt; ability to track their opponent.  Or like it was said, give <br/>\n&gt; them a certain<br/>\n&gt; time limit that they follow/track a player.  It&#39;s just plain <br/>\n&gt; silly that the<br/>\n&gt; thing knows, from several miles away, that you just sat down <br/>\n&gt; and now you&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; an easy target..<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>\tThat&#39;s the part.  I DOESN&#39;T KNOW that.  It has a list of people it<br/>\nhas to kill and you are on it.  Depending on that list you could be next or<br/>\nit has to kill two other people first.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tIts not a pretty picture, but there are too many problems with<br/>\ngameplay to consider.  People will find a way to cheat, and the best way to<br/>\nprevent that is make sure that if you start a fight that it gets finished<br/>\none way or another.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tHuman players have a disadvantage of knowledge in a sense, but they<br/>\nare also smarter.  IMHO, I think training is a natural and exciting part of<br/>\nthe game.  Sure its damn irritating and very unsettling, but sometimes its<br/>\nactually quite exciting and fun.  You eventually learn to stay away from<br/>\n&quot;train tracks&quot; and to avoid people running around.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tIt would take a signficant amount of dev time to come up with a<br/>\nbetter solution and it would definitely be a lot more processor heavy (think<br/>\nabout all the delays, aging factors, and whatnot that EVERY monster would<br/>\nhave to have in EVERY zone).  Its not pretty really, which is why the closer<br/>\nyou get to reality the hard it is to implement. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nMalark on Karana, not really arguing anymore more than accepting the<br/>\ninevitable.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ~Mysk<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I think you can keep track of a monster from across the zone, then<br/>\n&gt; &gt; so can they.  I don&#39;t see a problem with this since it helps avoid<br/>\n&gt; cheating.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Rangers can track any monster or player they want in a zone <br/>\n&gt; from anywhere<br/>\n&gt; &gt; regardless of if they actually passed by there or not.  If <br/>\n&gt; the monsters<br/>\n&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t know where everything was it would lead to a lot of <br/>\n&gt; AI problems and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; issues.  AI just isn&#39;t that good yet in games.  I think <br/>\n&gt; Verant has done an<br/>\n&gt; &gt; alright job so far.  There&#39;s obvious bugs, but at least <br/>\n&gt; monsters help each<br/>\n&gt; &gt; other out, cast spells right, and do a myriad of other <br/>\n&gt; things.  In just<br/>\n&gt; &gt; about every other game the computer ALWAYS has a complete <br/>\n&gt; knowledge base<br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the area to work with (like RTS games) but it just <br/>\n&gt; &quot;pretends&quot; it doesn&#39;t.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Those of you who played Red Alert saw this alot when your <br/>\n&gt; secret assault<br/>\n&gt; &gt; force of tanks that were going to flank the base while the <br/>\n&gt; AI opponent<br/>\n&gt; &gt; attacked yours was suddenly attacked BY the enemy force.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Again, if I had to choose between more realism and more gameplay, I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; would always choose more gameplay.  You want realism?
