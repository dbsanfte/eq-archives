I now<br/>\nhave everyhting I need after shopping in Freeport. I was not able to find<br/>\nBanshee Aura. I am told this is a spell that must be researched.<br/>\nI have some questions about research.<br/>\n<br/>\nI made level 16 and went to my guild. I was only able to train one point<br/>\ninto research. Is this normal? If so, why do I have 50 practice points saved<br/>\nup.... Nevertheless, I do have some questions. How do I research? I think<br/>\nthere is a book I&#39;m supposed to buy, but don&#39;t know the title. Will it tell<br/>\nme how to research spells? Is research like smithing where I will be<br/>\ncombining things in attempts to get a success? Does each spell have a<br/>\nseparate &quot;recipe&quot; or do I just combine the same things and see what happens?<br/>\nAnd lastly, I saw a whole bunch of books for sale which I suspect are<br/>\nrelated to research, With titles like Calling Forth the Darkness. How do I<br/>\nknow these books are for necromancers or not? Any help would be great.<br/>\nThanks....<br/>\n<br/>\nDave<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nmajsa@...\">nmajsa@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, May 03, 1999 12:13 PM<br/>\nSubject: [EQ_Necromancer] Re: Spell Search<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nmajsa@...\">nmajsa@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;If anyone knows where these spells can be found, please let me know.

You have to<br/>\ncheck<br/>\n&gt; a lot of different vendors (theres about 8 of them) under the city but<br/>\nmost of<br/>\n&gt; them are there...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Has ONElist changed your life?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Visit our homepage and share with us your experiences at ONElist of the<br/>\nWeek!<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; This list is basically unmoderated.
