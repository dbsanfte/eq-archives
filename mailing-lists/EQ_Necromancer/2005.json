However, I do wish you<br/>\nwould consider the Troll race over the ogre... it is true that on paper, the<br/>\nogre is superior to the troll as an SK, but you do not play on paper.  The<br/>\ntroll is far superior to the ogre in any gameplay situation.  Get your<br/>\nstrength to 125-130 and then put the rest into int for 70-75... And regen is<br/>\noften written off as impractical in the later game... I can not tell you the<br/>\nnumber of times you will be jumped while killing frogz and Lizziez an tings,<br/>\nand all dem ograys wid be ded, but da trolliez all lib cuz dey tougher dan<br/>\nde ograyz.  An ebberbody noz dat onlee da trolliez iz da real shady<br/>\nknights... ograys gud basherrz cuz dey no smart, lik marines.  Den da<br/>\ntrolliez can take wat da ded ograys wuz fightun.  An da dark elfiez is gud<br/>\ntu!  Dey tough ifun you fry dem, but dey boil gud!  An ifun you grab dem on<br/>\nda neck, dey mak gud clubz!  But no be dum ogray...</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
