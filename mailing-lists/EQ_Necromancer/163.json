I have some misgivings about it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I watched another mage, while invisible, casting their Shadow Step<br/>\noutside.  It was sad, they hardly went a few feet away from their original<br/>\nspot, and if they were being attacked, they could still get hit by<br/>\nwhatever it was from where they went.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Though I guess, in a dungeon, it would be more helpful, or is that just<br/>\nwishful thinking?  Also, how long does it take to cast?  Faster than Gate<br/>\ndoes, or the same?<br/>\n<br/>\n    Thanks for the info folks.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Myskyra / Tunare</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
