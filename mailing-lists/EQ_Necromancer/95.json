Well, if you happen to be a nonevil race this isn&#39;t too bad.<br/>\n&gt;If you are a troll, dark elf, or ogre though, you&#39;ll either need a human<br/>\n&gt;liaison or an illusion.

The real<br/>\n </span></blockquote>problem<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;is raising the skill is so hit or miss.  Sometimes you can make three<br/>\n&gt;skewers and gain 3 points in the smithing, and the next thing you know<br/>\n&gt;you&#39;ve blown through 30 skewers and raised maybe a point.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  So what am I saying?  Have a huge bankroll ready, we&#39;re talking a good<br/>\n&gt;60-100 platinum just to practice your way up to a decent level.  You can<br/>\n&gt;still make banded armor at skill 20, but the success rate is so low you&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt;have to charge way high to make any kind of turnover.  I know people that<br/>\n&gt;refuse to make the tunics and leggings (hardest parts) at skill 90 because<br/>\n&gt;the turnover is so poor.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  As for a spellcaster, there are rumors flying about that high<br/>\n </span></blockquote>dex,stamina,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;and strength make a difference too, I have no idea, but your saved up<br/>\n&gt;practice points are best saved up in other area.  Spellcasters have two<br/>\n&gt;fields which are quite useful, Specialization and Research.  Specialization<br/>\n&gt;isn&#39;t implemented yet (whee) but basically you sink practice points into a<br/>\n&gt;field (and it doesn&#39;t grow with practice) of magic and all spells in that<br/>\n&gt;field become cheaper, more effective, etc etc.  Research is the big one.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;appears to be partially implemented but I can&#39;t get a straight answers<br/>\n </span></blockquote>(some<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;GMs say no, some say Maybe, some say partial, yet some high levels can make<br/>\n&gt;spells).  After level 16 some spells become rare.  Sometimes you have to<br/>\n&gt;travel to far off guilds to get the spells, sometimes they can&#39;t be found<br/>\n&gt;anywhere on Norrath.  So you need to develop Research so you can MAKE the<br/>\n&gt;spells you are missing.  From what I&#39;ve heard this is a total pain in the<br/>\n&gt;ass, but hey, you need your spells right?  Basically you first sink some<br/>\n&gt;points into many different languages (this is another pain), one mainly<br/>\n&gt;being old Erudin.  Then you start grabbing Runes and Words of (insert<br/>\n&gt;magical phrase here) off of NPC spellcasters)  put them in a lexicon and<br/>\n </span></blockquote>add<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;pen and paper and Combine just like a blacksmith.

The only real thing you can do<br/>\n&gt;is tailoring and that isn&#39;t terribly lucrative, especially since the step<br/>\n&gt;after patchwork armor is massive and almost as painful as smithing (nobody<br/>\n&gt;seems to have created studded leather armor YET).  Any skill will require<br/>\n&gt;loads of money and time before you can even set foot down the journey.  I<br/>\n&gt;like that, because it doesn&#39;t allow insta-merchants, but I think maybe some<br/>\n&gt;steps are just way too hard.  Also evil races are even worse off because<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;evil cities often don&#39;t sell the necessary parts for any skill (other than<br/>\n&gt;tailoring).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My advice to you is to not worry about trade skills yet.
