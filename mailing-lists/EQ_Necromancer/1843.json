I have a 22 Erudite Wiz who began the<br/>\nStein of Moggok quest (an enchanter friend was going to finish the quest for<br/>\nhim).  There comes a time in that quest when you need to travel to Rivervale<br/>\nto get a bottle of Honeyjum.  My wizard was dubious to the npc giving out<br/>\nthe honeyjum. Whenever he hailed the npc, the npc REFUSED to talk to him.<br/>\nHowever,  he could give the npc the 3 honeycombs and 30 gold pieces and get<br/>\nthe honeyjum!  Even though he couldn&#39;t initiate the quest through dialogue<br/>\n(due to very bad faction) he could STILL complete the quest just by turning<br/>\nin the items.<br/>\n<br/>\nI realize you may have already tried this, so just take this message as an<br/>\n&quot;in case you haven&#39;t already...&quot; type of deal.<br/>\n<br/>\nMujahid  17 Necro  Sol Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Fottral, Mayo [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mayof@...\">mayof@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, February 23, 2000 2:08 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [EQ_Necromancer] Dark Bargainers Faction<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Fottral, Mayo&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mayof@...\">mayof@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To all telling me to do the Red Wine quest, I have tried (and tried, and<br/>\n&gt; tried, and tried) but you CAN&#39;T do it unless you are indifferent<br/>\n&gt; or better.<br/>\n&gt; I am one notch down from indifferent at apprehensive, and at apprehensive<br/>\n&gt; (or dubious I assume) you cannot do the red wine quest OR the<br/>\n&gt; Lightstone/Research quest with the DE merchant in S.
