My druid is lvl 61 and it was never this hard to <br/>\nget my spells. My druid gets EXP easy to by &quot;snare, root, and triple <br/>\ndotting&quot;... where as with my Necromancer I have to either snare/dot <br/>\nand gain agro off my pet and run it around chasing me or fear kite <br/>\nit. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s almost as if EQ is creating characters for each person&#39;s <br/>\npersonality. Bards for those who when fighting love to key many keys. <br/>\nNecromancer for the quest type lovers, and Druid for those who love <br/>\nthe easy way and to chat more than play. plus, Clerics for those who <br/>\nwant to simply help group members but spend more time sitting <br/>\naround... amoung other classes. Even Monks for karate loving people!<br/>\n<br/>\nAlexandrah (Druid)<br/>\nJustene (Necromancer)<br/>\nAlexis (Bard)<br/>\nBeverly (BeastLord)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n._.~*~._.~*~.Beverly R._.~*~._.~*~.<br/>\n<br/>\nP.O.
