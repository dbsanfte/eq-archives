<div id="ygrps-yiv-1277512977">OK, granted, grouping changes everything. I tend not to group, tho, since I<br/>
play in 15 or 20 minutes chunks when I have some free time. When I do group<br/>
(on weekends or whatever), the shaman rocks. &lt;g&gt; And I&#39;ve heard the rogue<br/>
will be much better if I coax him to level 10. He&#39;s 7 now, and it just gets<br/>
so tedious... kill a blue (and fighting is just a matter of hitting a key<br/>
and standing there...with no spells and no pets its pretty straightforward),<br/>
then sit and heal for 5 minutes. Repeat until your brain dissolves and runs<br/>
out your ears... *g*<br/>
<br/>
Necros are a lot more fun, and with the DoT spells and pet and curious<br/>
&#39;healing&#39; spells, combat with them is complex and interesting... I told my<br/>
friends that a necro is the way to go for folks who generally play strategy<br/>
games.<br/>

&gt; 	I don&#39;t think so, in a group.  Basically live through the hell that<br/>
&gt; is getting to backstab, then find another rogue.  I swear I&#39;ve seen two<br/>
&gt; rogues on Karana do this and simply SHOOT up the charts.  They<br/>
&gt; hit a yellow,<br/>
&gt; sometimes a lower red mob from both sides and take turns backstabbing.<br/>
&gt; Almost always the monster will switch targets between backstabs.  Its<br/>
&gt; absolutely astounding to see this.  Granted it doesn&#39;t work all the time,<br/>
&gt; but dual rogues (or multiple rogues even) is a sight to behold.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 	I still think necromancers are the best soloing class (again, this<br/>
&gt; without playing a druid, the class which comprises 90% of the people over<br/>
&gt; level 30 on Karana, I really have to try it sometime).  They can<br/>
&gt; do it all,<br/>
&gt; they even have an okay healing spell (heal friend, drain enemy to regain<br/>
&gt; hits, repeat).  At level 20 we just take off.  We get Expulse Undead (94<br/>
&gt; points of damage to undead) and drybones and exhumed gnolls just start<br/>
&gt; dropping like flies.  At 16 you can live very well in the Lavastorm<br/>
&gt; Mountains killing elementals, rock dervishes, and lava crawlers<br/>
&gt; till around<br/>
&gt; 18 or so, then moving on to nastier undead.  After that?  Dunno, I&#39;ve only<br/>
&gt; seen one level 25 necromancer and he&#39;s a KewlD00d powergamer thus doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; talk much.  I think things just get scary after that though.<br/>
&gt; Research will<br/>
&gt; be a primal pain in the rear, but it shouldn&#39;t be too bad.  They&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; increased the frequency of the component drops and I&#39;ve actually<br/>
&gt; saved up a<br/>
&gt; good 9 words/runes already onver this weekend.  I can use some of them but<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll probably just start trading them for the spells I can&#39;t get.<br/>
&gt;  My worry<br/>
&gt; is beyond the 30th level fro Necromancers.  There are only two research<br/>
&gt; books I know of and they only go to level 29 or something for spells to<br/>
&gt; create.  After that there&#39;s this empty zone.  Oh well, we shall live in<br/>
&gt; interesting times.<br/>
