<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-544910102">&lt;&lt; Where do you go to  collect your chips? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
best spots <br/>
<br/>
In Feerrott in the NW corner is three sets of ruins with 10 spawn points with <br/>
skeletons that spawn every 5 minutes. You can fill a back ack full of bones <br/>
in a short time.  <br/>
 If you want a little more adventure you can go into the back of spectre cave <br/>
in feerrott, right by the fear portal and do drybones and if your above lvl <br/>
40 you can take on cyndi a 40th lvl necro she spawns with dagger everytime <br/>
and great exp till 50. <br/>
Both spots are great for bones and hardly every camped.  Well cyndi is <br/>
becomming popular so she might be. <br/>
<br/>
In fayder you cant beat Unrest <br/>
<br/>
In qeynos hills the ruins <br/>
<br/>
My top picks <br/>
If your in freeport or Neriak and need em just buy from the players I only <br/>
pay 2-5 pp per stack depending on how bad I need them and usually only buy a <br/>
stack till i get to one of my spots. <br/>
