&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  I&#39;d just like to say I finally bought EQ after everyone at my work,<br/>
&gt;  and all my friends have made me sick about raving about it.  Well, I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;  in a little bit of a bind.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  I just started out and died when I finally reached my Guild house. <br/>
&gt;  Unfortunately I couldn&#39;t get my corpse and have lost my note I was<br/>
&gt;  supposed to hand to the necromancer there.  I hear from my friends<br/>
&gt;  that I should get a robe or something, but I don&#39;t have the note.  Is<br/>
&gt;  there any way to get a new note or something?  None of the stores<br/>
&gt;  nearby will sell me anything because I&#39;m a necromancer, so I&#39;d like to<br/>
&gt;  get this one.    Also is there anything else I am missing out on by<br/>
&gt;  not completing this quest?  I mean,  I&#39;m sure I can eventually find a<br/>
&gt;  robe somewhere,  I just don&#39;t want to miss out on a bunch of stuff.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>If you are still first level... Delete and restart your character.  It is the <br/>
simplest way.<br/>
<br/>
All you miss is the robe (2AC) and some experience.<br/>
<br/>
I expect you died by hitting the a key when talking to him (not hitting the <br/>
enter key first)...<br/>
<br/>
Change the attack key from a to 0 (zero) or some other NON character key not <br/>
used by EQ.  Since I have done that... I have never attacked an NPC by <br/>
accident.<br/>
