<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-865850862">i just have a few questions about hunting in the various zones.  i havent <br/>
played for a while, so i just want to see if my info is still relevant...<br/>
<br/>
a. can a 24 necro solo a giant skel (from rathe mtns)?  if not, what lvl?<br/>
<br/>
b. ive heard there have been changes to the lvls of the unkempt druids.  is <br/>
it too dangerous to hunt them at L24?<br/>
<br/>
c. is paw somewhere i should avoid for a while?<br/>
<br/>
d. have any other areas become good to hunt?  i was at the treants, and it <br/>
was rather boring.  i also only gained about one bubble of xp.<br/>
