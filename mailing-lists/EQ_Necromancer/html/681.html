<div id="ygrps-yiv-1105672946">Whats 6 ac.. well for one you are going to drop them one ac class. Ac<br/>
class&#39;s go up by 5 just like your stats. In some casses thats like lossing<br/>
there tunic. Also it follows the necro style. You dran them. So you lose<br/>
some ac as well. Your pet still has its ac. So I think thats a wicked spell.<br/>
Makes it easyer for your pet to damage them and your spells hit them harder.<br/>

&gt;it must be in your first spell slot.  Then you suck your target&#39;s AC.<br/>
&gt;Still, what&#39;s 6 AC really gonna do?<br/>
