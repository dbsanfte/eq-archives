<b>Subject:</b> queynos and gate <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1672155000">I&#39;m a necro in queynos, and none of the lovelies in my guild or the other<br/>
guilds in my temple sell that gate spell.  I like the gate spell, it&#39;s a<br/>
pretty darn usefull piece of work, and the happy mages and enchanters and<br/>
wizards in the surface guild...well..they don&#39;t like necros that much, and<br/>
of course won&#39;t sell to me.  Anyone have any ideas where to get the spell?<br/>
I know doing the drosco quest can get you a random spell somtimes, but after<br/>
6 tries of it, I still have yet to get the gate spell.  Anyhow, any imput<br/>
would be appreciated.<br/>
