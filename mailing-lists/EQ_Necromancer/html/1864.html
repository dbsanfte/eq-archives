<div id="ygrps-yiv-1756668687">Do Not go to Glide mode. That is for 3dfx chips only. as for mipmaping i<br/>
think (and feel free to correct me) that has something to do with texture<br/>
bluring, but not sure.<br/>

&gt; Hi Folks,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Since we&#39;re on this topic...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have a Diamond Viper V770D Ultra (Riva TnT2 chipset) with 32 megs of<br/>
video<br/>
&gt; ram.  That said:  I have been playing EQ for several months now, but have<br/>
&gt; never turned the &quot;Mipmapping&quot; feature on (although my clip plan is set all<br/>
&gt; the way out).  I&#39;ve always hesitated, because I don&#39;t know much about<br/>
video<br/>
&gt; cards, and it says that it would have to restart in Glide mode (which I<br/>
have<br/>
&gt; no idea what that means).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; With my video card, would I benefit from turning that option on?  If so,<br/>
&gt; why?  What the heck is mipmapping and what the heck is Glide mode?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sorry for the flood of questions, but I&#39;m a real hardware newbie.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks in advance for your help,<br/>
