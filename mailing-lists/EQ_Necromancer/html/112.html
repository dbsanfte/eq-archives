<div id="ygrps-yiv-66656185">Hello, folks,<br/>
<br/>
        I&#39;ve tried to get my Necro off to Free port about two, three times<br/>
now.  I get completely lost in High Hold Keep and end up wondering the same<br/>
halls and turns for about an hour or so before I gate back.  Could any of<br/>
you give the directions to go, to get _out_ the other side of that flaming<br/>
place?<br/>
<br/>
        Also, do the guards kill you on sight?  I&#39;m constantly invis or<br/>
finding a room to recast it before it runs out, just in case. :)<br/>
<br/>
    Thanks for any help,<br/>
<br/>
