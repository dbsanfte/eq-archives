<div id="ygrps-yiv-505414304">Ok if you are level 6 here is a scale for you. Rank 1 is level 1 to 4 as we<br/>
all know. Each rank is made up of 4 levels. The first 2 levels in a rank you<br/>
can take a yellow.. most times. But then the last 2 levels in a rank you<br/>
have to be careful. Yellow&#39;s are now red for your pet. So now the third<br/>
level in a rank a black ranking is realy yellow. then in the last level in a<br/>
rank blue in some cases are realy yellow. If you dont under stand what I am<br/>
saying.. Just tell me. I will  try and explan this agian. The main reason<br/>
for this is the stenth of your pet. Most necros that have a hard time is<br/>
because they for get to look at what they are going to fight threw there<br/>
pets eyes.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s my 2 cents.<br/>

&gt;character by far. I can take on a yellow monster with a bit of luck, and<br/>
&gt;whites are a no brainer. My shaman (lvl 11) has been slain by blue<br/>
 </span></blockquote>critters,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;can take a white only if the gods are smiling on him and then will finish<br/>
&gt;the battle at zero mana and almost no health, and yellow is a death wish.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Magician is a bit better, but his run-ins with yellows have been horrific.<br/>
&gt;Rogue is worst of all, of course. So (in MY experience, anyway), of these 4<br/>
&gt;classes, necro is the strongest. You want weak? try a rogue... heh<br/>
