<div id="ygrps-yiv-1253997178">An alternative idea to the current Feign Death &#39;nerf&#39; is being discussed on<br/>
the message board of <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eqnecro.com">http://www.eqnecro.com</a><br/>

Simply put, the idea (as described by Chiggy), would be when the 15 minute<br/>
time limit was hit, the pet (if present) would commit suicide.<br/>
<br/>
To me, this seems MUCH more reasonable then making us stand up, risking death,<br/>
especially if your group hasn&#39;t re-broken their way back in to where you are<br/>
feigning.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;m sure the necro comunity at large would benefit from the input of<br/>
this list, with perhaps even better ideas, or support of this one.<br/>

PS.  I am interested in buying Words of Dissemination, Parasitism,<br/>
     Incorporeal, or Purification.  Or, Vampiric Curse and Renew Bones.<br/>
     I have (1) Intensify Death for any interested lvl 24ish necros as well.</div>
