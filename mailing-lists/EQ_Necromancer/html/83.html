<div id="ygrps-yiv-1939842504">That&#39;s *exactly* the reason I started Kagon, and haven&#39;t played my<br/>
ranger since (except once, I feel kinda ..guilty and stuff..). I read<br/>
your post and was mildly concerned since I was nearing 7 myself. Well,<br/>
when I hit 7 last night...there was barely anything to fight! Ok, I<br/>
may be overexagerating, but kodiak&#39;s were still yellow (I got<br/>
slaughtered by one, thinking I was smart, but I was just<br/>
ill-prepared), and now almost all black bears and shadow wolves are<br/>
green. The only whites I saw the rest of the night was a tree snake<br/>
and a skel near the ruins, which are camped like mad anyway. I&#39;m<br/>
thinking of taking a trip over to the Freeport area, maybe more stuff<br/>
over there? Personally, I think Kagon would enjoy flaying a halfling<br/>
or two, but the 2 locations he has been to so far are not suitable<br/>
yet. =P *shudders at the memory of being burned to death by 3 halfling<br/>
spellcasters and bludgeoned by 4 skels at the same time*<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

Thanks to all for the responses.   I&#39;m looking forward to playing and<br/>
getting to 8 and above.   It&#39;s funny, I started this Necromancer just<br/>
on a whim when I got a little bored with my Ranger and I haven&#39;t<br/>
played<br/>
my Ranger since.   My friends in Kelethin are not pleased...<br/>
