<b>Subject:</b> Re: Curious on 8 memorized spells for lev 16 through 23 rd level play ers ? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1849905081">im only L11, but looking at my impending set of spells, and considering im <br/>
already feeling a crunch, i really think that pure spell caster classes NEED <br/>
another spell bar.  Eight spells is just not enough to cover many <br/>
situations, and definitely offers very little flexiblity.  another thing <br/>
that would be useful is some sort of &#39;quick spell&#39; slot, where you can keep <br/>
one spell to cast.  i usually use my top slot for this, where i can place a <br/>
spell that i can do without if i need to quickly memorize a different spell- <br/>
but i would be estatic if we could get to memorize 16 spells.<br/>
<br/>
while we&#39;ve all heard many tweaks that are far fetched an definitely <br/>
unbalanced, i think this is rather important, and would add a great deal of <br/>
flexibility to spell casters, especially at higher levels where we get a <br/>
staggering array of various spells.<br/>

&gt;Hail fellow necromancers<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am lev 14th and already finding it hard to pick exactly which 8 spells to<br/>
&gt;keep memorized. I currently don&#39;t keep shielding and grim aura memorized,<br/>
&gt;rather I cast and delete them, then repeat later when they wear off.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;When I&#39;m in a large group that is killing fast, I tend to use the low mana<br/>
&gt;spells like siphon str and disease so I can do this to all MOBS. I like to<br/>
&gt;keep gate memorized for emergencies, my best life suck spell, my ward<br/>
&gt;undead, and my best darkness spell as it slows the MOBs down if they are<br/>
&gt;fleeing or if I need to flee. I also find dark empathy handy to emergency<br/>
&gt;heal passerby&#39;s that are dying. I make a lot of friends that way. I also<br/>
&gt;find mend bones quite handy esp when I&#39;m soloing or in a group of 2 where<br/>
&gt;the other person is a wizard or other spell type. I also like the vampiric<br/>
&gt;embrace as I can tank at the beginning of a fight longer, back out and life<br/>
&gt;drain, then tank again. That extra 25 tap 2 or 3 times some fights has made<br/>
&gt;a big difference a few times.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So I have at lev 14 something like this memorized.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1)Best Life Drain<br/>
&gt;2)Vampiric Embrace<br/>
&gt;3)Englufing Darkness<br/>
&gt;4)Heat Blood (or if in lavastorm or big group Disease)<br/>
&gt;5)Dark Empathy<br/>
&gt;6)Mend Bones (or if in group with tanks siphon str or posion bolt)<br/>
&gt;7)Gate<br/>
&gt;8)Ward Undead<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I wish I had slots for fear and shadow step but I don&#39;t usually.<br/>
&gt;At lev 16 I see a lot of new neat spells. A new DOT. Feign Death. A spell <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;make you immune to damage for a short time ect. I am at a loss as to how to<br/>
&gt;fit all the fun spells in. I&#39;m happy in the sence there are so many cool<br/>
&gt;spells I can sorta mix and match for the situation but its much more<br/>
&gt;difficult living with 8 spells at a time then when I play my lev 17<br/>
&gt;magician. I can mem and forget all my summon spells. My combat ones are<br/>
&gt;always less then 8. IE DD, AE, Gate, Damage Shield and I&#39;m about done with<br/>
&gt;important spells.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I was wanting advice from higher lev necromancers about what spells they<br/>
&gt;tend to load and for what situations. Esp for the lev 16 and the 20th<br/>
&gt;spells.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sincerely,<br/>
