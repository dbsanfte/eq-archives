<b>Subject:</b> Permafrost? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1342924393">I have heard some people claiming they&#39;ve had great success in Permafrost with groups in the 15-22 level range.  Does anyone out there have any experiences in Permafrost they would like to share that either confirm or contradict this claim.  If confirming, could you please describe the strategy used for a group in the 15-22 level range?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
