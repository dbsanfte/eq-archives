 </span></blockquote>Lag is a different issue.  It&#39;s a pain as well, but unrelated to<br/>
framerate.  Neither SHOULD be effected by moving trees, except the CPU<br/>
consumption of calculating where the branches have moved between<br/>
refreshes.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, that would be a good test - run a CPU monitoring program and see<br/>
what the load is like in the slow-frame zones versus the fast-frame zones<br/>
on Antonica.  It wouldn&#39;t surprise me to learn that having the client<br/>
calculate the position of 10000 moving branches is wasting a lot of<br/>
cycles, even though it doesn&#39;t mean more data to render nor more traffic<br/>
to the server.<br/>
<br/>
I kind of like the moving trees - it makes it a lot harder to spot MoBs,<br/>
which adds to the sense of danger and exploration.  However if it&#39;s<br/>
killing my framerate I will happily do without.<br/>
