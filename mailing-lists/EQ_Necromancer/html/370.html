I&#39;ve been toying with the possibility as well, but I&#39;m waiting on a couple<br/>
things first.<br/>
∩┐╜<br/>
A)∩┐╜ DoT spells are illegal.∩┐╜ Actually anywhere where you can kill your<br/>
opponent indirectly (like ROOTing someone underwater) is illegal because<br/>
they don&#39;t classify that damage or something.∩┐╜ What does this mean?∩┐╜ A<br/>
necromancer is virtually castrated.∩┐╜ NO DoT means no Darkness Spells, No<br/>
Blood, Bo Heart Flutter, etc.∩┐╜ Its sucks really bad.<br/>
∩┐╜<br/>
B) Faction on inter-racial PKing.∩┐╜ Basically this is player enforced.∩┐╜ You<br/>
get a bad mark on your through players only but often this doesn&#39;t mean<br/>
anything.<br/>
∩┐╜<br/>
∩┐╜<br/>
Some things I&#39;ve noticed or heard about.∩┐╜ Essentially the only place you are<br/>
mostly safe is your own newbie area outside home, even then not much.∩┐╜ But<br/>
in most open areas there&#39;s mostly an unspoken peace.∩┐╜ It is NOT the<br/>
nightmare ambush world a lot of people are afraid of where you can&#39;t rest<br/>
anywhere or anything.∩┐╜ Its bad sometimes, but for the most part you&#39;ll just<br/>
see people giving each other a WIDE berth, with some groups of vigilantes<br/>
running around.∩┐╜ Things are definitely more exciting, and advancing in the<br/>
higher teens is often more difficult simply because your access to other<br/>
areas is somewhat more difficult.∩┐╜ This is mostly on Antonica though.∩┐╜ If<br/>
you start in Faydwer there&#39;s this nasty stuff going on between the Gnomes<br/>
and Elves, but for the most part you are as safe as in nonPvP.∩┐╜ Erud is<br/>
still as crappy as it ever is.∩┐╜ Most of the cool PvP stuff happens on<br/>
Antonica.∩┐╜ It gnaws at me more and more to try out Rallos Zek, but I don&#39;t<br/>
want to do it till they fix DoT spells and other assorted screwups.<br/>

Does anyone play on Rallos Zek?∩┐╜ I was thinking of starting a character<br/>
there, but I have heard both positive and negative things about the server.∩┐╜<br/>
Does it differ a lot from the regular servers, besides anyone can kill you<br/>
within 4 levels?∩┐╜ Do you still have the evil races grouping with the good<br/>
races or do they tend to group among their own race?∩┐╜ How is the rampant Pk<br/>
situation, human killing other humans etc..??∩┐╜ Sorry for all the questions<br/>
but I&#39;m getting bored with fighting NPCs on E&#39;ci and I think being able to<br/>
fight the goodie goodies would spice it up a lot.∩┐╜ <br/>
∩┐╜<br/>
I was also thinking of joining a guild and participating in guildwars but I<br/>
haven&#39;t heard of any guilds doing that and what I see, all the guilds are<br/>
letting every race/class in.∩┐╜ Which, IMHO isn&#39;t RP at all.∩┐╜ Even if the<br/>
&quot;evil&quot; character claims that he has turned good.<br/>
