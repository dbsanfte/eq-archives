<div id="ygrps-yiv-1960709456">I don&#39;t think so, in a group.  Basically live through the hell that<br/>
is getting to backstab, then find another rogue.  I swear I&#39;ve seen two<br/>
rogues on Karana do this and simply SHOOT up the charts.  They hit a yellow,<br/>
sometimes a lower red mob from both sides and take turns backstabbing.<br/>
Almost always the monster will switch targets between backstabs.  Its<br/>
absolutely astounding to see this.  Granted it doesn&#39;t work all the time,<br/>
but dual rogues (or multiple rogues even) is a sight to behold.<br/>
<br/>
	I still think necromancers are the best soloing class (again, this<br/>
without playing a druid, the class which comprises 90% of the people over<br/>
level 30 on Karana, I really have to try it sometime).  They can do it all,<br/>
they even have an okay healing spell (heal friend, drain enemy to regain<br/>
hits, repeat).  At level 20 we just take off.  We get Expulse Undead (94<br/>
points of damage to undead) and drybones and exhumed gnolls just start<br/>
dropping like flies.  At 16 you can live very well in the Lavastorm<br/>
Mountains killing elementals, rock dervishes, and lava crawlers till around<br/>
18 or so, then moving on to nastier undead.  After that?  Dunno, I&#39;ve only<br/>
seen one level 25 necromancer and he&#39;s a KewlD00d powergamer thus doesn&#39;t<br/>
talk much.  I think things just get scary after that though.  Research will<br/>
be a primal pain in the rear, but it shouldn&#39;t be too bad.  They&#39;ve<br/>
increased the frequency of the component drops and I&#39;ve actually saved up a<br/>
good 9 words/runes already onver this weekend.  I can use some of them but<br/>
I&#39;ll probably just start trading them for the spells I can&#39;t get.  My worry<br/>
is beyond the 30th level fro Necromancers.  There are only two research<br/>
books I know of and they only go to level 29 or something for spells to<br/>
create.  After that there&#39;s this empty zone.  Oh well, we shall live in<br/>
interesting times.<br/>

&gt; &gt; 	So if you can make a list of things that you are pissed <br/>
&gt; off about<br/>
&gt; &gt; the Necromancer, I think we can discuss them and maybe <br/>
&gt; understand each<br/>
&gt; &gt; other&#39;s position better.  PErsonally I think we&#39;re one of <br/>
&gt; the best of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; lot.  Just about everyone I know has a MUCH harder time <br/>
&gt; with just about<br/>
&gt; &gt; everything else (except druids, DAMN, what&#39;s up with these <br/>
&gt; guys that allow<br/>
&gt; &gt; them to frikkin jump into the high end in like weeks?!?! That&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; what I want<br/>
&gt; &gt; to know!)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have rogue, magician, and shaman (my primary) characters in <br/>
&gt; addition to my<br/>
&gt; necro. Now granted I&#39;m only at level 6, but so far this has <br/>
&gt; been my easiest<br/>
&gt; character by far. I can take on a yellow monster with a bit <br/>
&gt; of luck, and<br/>
&gt; whites are a no brainer. My shaman (lvl 11) has been slain by <br/>
&gt; blue critters,<br/>
&gt; can take a white only if the gods are smiling on him and then <br/>
&gt; will finish<br/>
&gt; the battle at zero mana and almost no health, and yellow is a <br/>
&gt; death wish.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Magician is a bit better, but his run-ins with yellows have <br/>
&gt; been horrific.<br/>
&gt; Rogue is worst of all, of course. So (in MY experience, <br/>
&gt; anyway), of these 4<br/>
&gt; classes, necro is the strongest. You want weak? try a rogue... heh<br/>
