<div id="ygrps-yiv-1994281020">First off, I think I&#39;ve heard that pretty much all higher level<br/>
magicians are pissed off.  Somewhere around level 20-24 due to bugs,<br/>
incomplete projects, and other assorted crap the magician becomes utterly<br/>
unable to advance after that.  For more information I would suggest signing<br/>
up to the magician&#39;s list.<br/>
<br/>
	In other regards, being a necro isn&#39;t terribly bad.  Basically you<br/>
should beat on moss snakes and SAVE SAVE SAVE.  If you run out of food<br/>
before level 4 I suggest you suicide someplace you can find again (or have<br/>
Locate Corpse).  You don&#39;t lose XP before level 6 and you always get newbie<br/>
food at level 4 and under.  Eventually you&#39;ll grub up a couple gold and a<br/>
bone chip or two (from decaying skeletons) and be able to buy Cavorting<br/>
Bones.  This will definitely hold you till LEvel 4 though the weak first<br/>
level skel will sometimes frustrate you with it totally variable hitpoints (<br/>
I think I once had a skel that took one hit from a beetle and died.).  Share<br/>
damage with your skel and double-team monsters.  Use your magic sparingly<br/>
and rest often.  BE CAREFUL of reinfrocements.  Spiderlings and beetles are<br/>
ATROCIOUS for this behavior.  I recall many a time where I was beating down<br/>
a spiderling only to have 1, 2, or more join in and beat the crap out of<br/>
you.  NEVER attack anything floating.  Sometimes the spawning process gets<br/>
screwed up and more than one monster will spawn in the same place.  You&#39;ll<br/>
come across a beetle or skeleton floatin in the air.  This usually means<br/>
there are two there, though this is variable as well, since I&#39;ve gotten<br/>
killed by four wisps in West Commons since I thought there would only be<br/>
two.  So, leave those alone.<br/>
	After that its a natural progression.  Try not to waste all your<br/>
mana, spread it out, take hits for your skeleton and when you aren&#39;t<br/>
actively hitting the target LOOK AROUND all the time to avoid trains and<br/>
ambushes from mobs.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hello.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I recently started a new dark elf necromancer on Mythannial <br/>
&gt; Marr. I&#39;m a<br/>
&gt; whole lev 2 at this point. I haven&#39;t trained any skills yet <br/>
&gt; at the guild<br/>
&gt; hall. Can I get some advice as to what spells to focus on? Is <br/>
&gt; 2H staffs the<br/>
&gt; weapon I should be using?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also at what level will I start to get a good feel for being <br/>
&gt; a necromancer<br/>
&gt; and start coming into my own? Are there any levels I should <br/>
&gt; just gut out?<br/>
&gt; For example my lev 15 magician had a very rough time at lev7 <br/>
&gt; but at lev8<br/>
&gt; things were MUCH easier. When I get lev 16 with my magician <br/>
&gt; tomorrow or the<br/>
&gt; next day I&#39;ll again see a HUGE increase in power. I&#39;m <br/>
&gt; assuming Necromancers<br/>
&gt; work the same way?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Any tips would be appreciated.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
