<div id="ygrps-yiv-1987798927">Hi!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I seem to remember someone posting about an NPC in Lake Rathe named John<br/>
&gt; Buckler or something and he was good to kill from like 16 up to 19th<br/>
&gt; then there was another island w/ a double Aviak Guard spawn in that zone<br/>
&gt; that not many people went to, but I forget where in the zone it was.  Can<br/>
&gt; anyone help me on locateing these 2 places in Lake Rathe . ..  thanks<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Island with 2 aviak spawns have loc around +1000, +1000. Never seen any<br/>
John Bucker in zone, i have seen only 2 named goblins (aqua goblins?),<br/>
bunch of vendors, 2 guards and alot of regular monsters (aviaks,<br/>
bandits, orc, ogres, gnolls, undeads). Maybe he is a vendor or a rare<br/>
spawn in one of camps.</div>
