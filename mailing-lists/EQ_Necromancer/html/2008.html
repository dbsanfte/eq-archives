<b>Subject:</b> Re: [EQ_Necromancer] Level 24 Pet, and related questions <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-43208122"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; First off, what level of pet is it possible to<br/>
&gt; summon with the level 24 pet<br/>
&gt; spell (Haunting Corpse).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I really don&#39;t remember the levels per say...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Reason I ask is this: <br/>
&gt; last night I&#39;m camping<br/>
&gt; Ratraz in Neriak.  I summon my top pet, which hits<br/>
&gt; for a max of 22.  My<br/>
&gt; friend dings into level 24 and summons his new, sexy<br/>
&gt; :), dark-boned<br/>
&gt; skeleton.  It conned a higher blue to me than my top<br/>
&gt; pet......but it never<br/>
&gt; hit for more than 22!  What gives?  Did he just<br/>
&gt; happen to summon a sucky<br/>
&gt; one?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Exactly. He had a bad summon. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Next question, deals with weapons for pets.  I know<br/>
&gt; that recently our pets<br/>
&gt; were nerfed in this department.  I know we have to<br/>
&gt; give our level 29 pets 2<br/>
&gt; weapons in order to duel wield.  What type of<br/>
&gt; weapons do you recommend?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are two types to give to pets. Weapons that<br/>
process, and weapons that do not. If you give a pet a<br/>
weapons that processes(dnoll hide lariat, mage<br/>
summoned sword), then the pet will process in battle<br/>
and do extra damage. Any other weapon makes no<br/>
difference what so ever. Rusty, low damage, high<br/>
damae, low speed, high speed, it makes no difference<br/>
what so ever. However, with the recent weapon change,<br/>
the pet will sometimes &quot;eat&quot; a weapon. You give it a<br/>
weapon, and it does not show up as a graphic, and pet<br/>
does not double hit. You need to give the pet another<br/>
weapon.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And, should I NOT give my level 24 pet a weapon?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>At that level, unless you give it a gigantic<br/>
zweihander or something along those lines, I would not<br/>
bother giving the pet a weapon. Unless you want to go<br/>
for looks. A pet with a shield makes a nice &quot;bonk&quot;<br/>
sound when bashing. :)<br/>
