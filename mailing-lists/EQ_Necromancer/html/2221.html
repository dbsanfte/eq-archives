<div id="ygrps-yiv-239624283">Actually, lifetap is resistable.  It is just RARELY resisted.  You can have<br/>
partial resists and full resists.  You can turn around and cast it on the<br/>
exact same mob and get full effect.  These changes went into EQ over a year<br/>
ago.  They are well documented by many necros (I had it happen a couple<br/>
times).  Its just that its rare.  I think the main thing is that Necros got<br/>
many more spells today than they used to.  The Drain line is simply not used<br/>
to the extent it was before, therefore the resists are even more rare.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt; Ummmm.... Lifetap is unresistable. Atleast I have NEVER had it<br/>
&gt; &gt; resisted. Check that... the EXG in Sol A is the only thing to ever<br/>
&gt; &gt; resist my Lifetap&#39;s &gt;&gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt; It is resistable - they made it so about 9 months ago - its a level cap.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The word &quot;resist&quot; can have different meanings.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Lifetap is not resistable in that the normal magic resistance of a critter<br/>
&gt; is ignored.  You&#39;ll never get a resist, cast again and have it stick.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Lifetap IS resistable in that there are some critters you can&#39;t cast it<br/>
&gt; on.  Anything over 6 levels higher than you, or totally immune to magic,<br/>
&gt; and perhaps some that are immune to lifetap and not other magic.<br/>
