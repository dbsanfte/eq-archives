<div id="ygrps-yiv-313184201">Dear Mr/Mrs/Dr/Rev/Lord/Lady ZARBON sr/jr/I/II/III/IV/ad nauseum<br/>
BA/MA/PHD/SJ/OFM/OB/MD/CPA/DD<br/>
<br/>
As a representative of &quot;The Bossman&quot; at EQ Slackers Inc., allow me to assure<br/>
you that we are doing everything we can to address the self-destruct issue.<br/>
At this time we have hired a consulting firm called &quot;Verant Consulting&quot; to<br/>
look at the problem, fix the problem where applicable, and/or recommend<br/>
implementation solutions as necessary.<br/>
<br/>
Verant Consulting has delivered a preliminary report with the following<br/>
suggestions:<br/>
1)  To make up for the ability of of some workers to have their pets tend to<br/>
the phone lines, it is recommended that you simply REMOVE all phone lines<br/>
from the building.  And/or, make current phones no longer usable by workers,<br/>
and eliminate any useful information from being passed on through the pet,<br/>
via a &quot;Filter Unwanted Call Knowledge Utility&quot;, also known as the<br/>
&quot;F.U.C.K.-U.&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
2)  Make all office phones &quot;NO DROP&quot;.  This way, when a worker answers the<br/>
phone for the first time, NO ONE ELSE can answer that phone.  A secondary<br/>
effect is that if the worker&#39;s pet answers the phone, the pet will not be<br/>
able to pass the phone back to the worker when said worker returns from<br/>
lunch/break.  A tertiary effect is that one random item that the worker is<br/>
carrying will disappear upon attempting to retrieve the phone from the pet.<br/>
<br/>
3)  Another possible solution is to remove the &quot;efficiency&quot; effect that<br/>
comes along with a pet answering the phone for the worker.  We do this by<br/>
making the pet unable to understand anyone that he/she talks to over the<br/>
phone.  However, since this is likely to agitate some workers more than the<br/>
above suggestions, we will give more advanced pets the ability to understand<br/>
two languages.  However, those pets will need to be given TWO phones to<br/>
accomplish this feat.  It doesn&#39;t matter what kind of phones they are, and<br/>
in fact need not function at all.  The problem lies in the fact that all<br/>
phones are soon to be implemented as LORE items, so we&#39;re thinking about<br/>
replacing the second phone with a hairbrush.  (Note:  EQ Slackers reminded<br/>
Verant Consulting that skeletons do not have hair.  Verant Consulting<br/>
replied &quot;We&#39;ll bring that up in Tuning.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, as lunches of all kinds are soon to be implemented as NO DROP<br/>
items, your question about self-destructing, lunch-gathering pets is a moot<br/>
issue.<br/>
<br/>
We are attempting to address the &quot;compensation&quot; issue.  Here is what &quot;Verant<br/>
Consulting&quot; has come up with:<br/>
1)  Allow the most advanced pets to leave said gathered lunches on their<br/>
corpses upon destructing.  To retrieve your lunch, simply cause your pet to<br/>
destruct.  Loot the pet&#39;s corpse and retrieve your lunch.  &quot;Verant<br/>
Consulting&quot; feels that this is more than enough compensation.  EQ Slackers<br/>
Inc. made the comment &quot;but the worker PAID FOR that lunch!  You&#39;re not<br/>
compensating them in any way!&quot;  to which &quot;Verant Consulting&quot; responded  &quot;it<br/>
is a highly complicated issue of class balance that your simple mind<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be able to wrap itself around anyway.  Therefore, no explanation is<br/>
required.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
2)  An alternative to #1 is to give the pet exactly 2 minutes to retrieve<br/>
the lunch.  If the lunch has not been retrieved in 2 minutes, said pet will<br/>
self-destruct.  EQ Slackers reminded &quot;Verant Consulting&quot; that the nearest<br/>
restaurant is 15 minutes away.  &quot;Verant Consulting&quot; responded by saying: &quot;If<br/>
you need 15 minutes to get to lunch, then you are approaching the whole<br/>
lunch issue from the wrong perspective.  Suffice it to say that MANY workers<br/>
are completely capable of retrieving their lunch in less than 2 minutes, so<br/>
we feel that 2 minutes is MORE than enough time!&quot;  When pressed further on<br/>
this issue, Verant Consulting retorted &quot;All right already!!  This is what<br/>
we&#39;re going to do!  We&#39;re going to make lunch a non-issue by making it less<br/>
nutritious!  There!  Now you happy?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, please be advised that ALL of the above solutions will require<br/>
random item dropping from all worker&#39;s inventories.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerly,<br/>
Mujahid,   &quot;That Guy&quot;<br/>

&gt; Boss Muller<br/>
&gt; EQ Slackers Inc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Dear Mr. Muller,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It has come to my attention that from now on our pets auto self<br/>
&gt; destruct as<br/>
&gt; we go to lunch.  Please consider the following concerns before<br/>
&gt; implementing<br/>
&gt; this solution.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1) Many workers, including myself, tend to send our pets to pick<br/>
&gt; up lunch as<br/>
&gt; we continue to work.  Will the auto destruct affect this?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2) Seeing as EQ Slackers Inc. doesn&#39;t compensate us for resources<br/>
&gt; needed to<br/>
&gt; summon pets, the amount of money taken from our pockets to<br/>
&gt; continue working<br/>
&gt; up to par will be increased.  Does EQ Slackers Inc. intend to repay us in<br/>
&gt; any shape, form or fashion?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks for your time and consideration to this matter.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Zarbon<br/>

&gt; &gt; It has come to our attention that some necromancers were parking their<br/>
&gt; pets<br/>
&gt; &gt; at the phones then taking a long lunch.  Thus from now on<br/>
&gt; whenever you go<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; lunch, your pet will self destruct.<br/>
