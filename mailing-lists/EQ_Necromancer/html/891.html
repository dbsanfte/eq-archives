<div id="ygrps-yiv-858516527">yeah, losing heat blood was at first devastating to my normal strategy, but<br/>
I adapted, and here&#39;s what I learned (I went from 12 to 16 in about 2<br/>
realtime days) :<br/>
<br/>
As you come into the zone, and make that first right turn to face the actual<br/>
zone proper, off to your left is a little rock and a tree, in a niche just<br/>
before the zone expands out.  This spot is &quot;safe&quot; in that trains will pass<br/>
you by as long as the mob isn&#39;t ticked at you personally, and you can sit<br/>
and med there in relative peace.  It&#39;s not safe if : 1) someone trains<br/>
something right through there and the mob notices you...it may not jump off<br/>
who it&#39;s chasing, but it will come back for you once said person zones, I<br/>
only experienced this once, and needless to say, i had words with the fellow<br/>
that did it, usually not a problem.  2) you are training something to the<br/>
zone, it&#39;s not an exploit spot where mobs can&#39;t reach you, just a relatively<br/>
safe place to rest up for your next fight.  Getting down to business, my<br/>
usual routine for lavastorm consisted of this:  enter zone, go to my safe<br/>
spot and cast my pet, buff/med etc to get ready to fight.  do a /pet guard<br/>
here.  Then I wander out and find something I think I can kill.  Once I spot<br/>
my prey I would cast darkness on it then hightail it back to my pet.  Once<br/>
back, the mob would be a ways back (unless he resisted the darkness, which<br/>
as you know happens about half the time) tell my pet to attack, hit it with<br/>
disease cloud to stop healing and then hit it with a poison bolt.  Then if<br/>
the mob wasn&#39;t ticked off at me by then I would med, otherwise engage in<br/>
melee until the pet did more damage and I could step back.  Then I would<br/>
just monitor my pets health (boy do I wish /pet report health had been<br/>
implemented then...) If he started getting dangerously low, I would stand<br/>
back up and melee some more.  During down time I would use dark pact, unless<br/>
I was really messed up healthwise, this spell I overlooked at first, it<br/>
didn&#39;t seem very useful.  But for the solo necro (or even the group minded)<br/>
it can be a real downtime killer.  This formula worked for me very well as I<br/>
said, I got to lvl 16 rather quickly.  You can stay after lvl 16, but I had<br/>
become weary of the area and moved on in search of new thrills.   As always,<br/>
the strategies here may give you mixed results, just passing on the<br/>
knowledge that took me a while to figure out in hopes that someone else can<br/>
put it to good use, or improve upon it.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the gypsies are concerned, I have no idea what faction element<br/>
they are, but if someone knows (if they have faction at all...) I&#39;d *love*<br/>
to hear it, as I&#39;m in S Karana right now, and going to Ogguk to get<br/>
food/water and dump my loot is getting pretty tedious.  (I pretty much hosed<br/>
my Qeynos faction the other day when I decided I wanted revenge on Holly<br/>
Windstalker more than I wanted good Qeynos faction...but that&#39;s another<br/>
story) ;)<br/>

&gt; Something else I noticed about Lavastorm, everything resists heat blood.<br/>
Which<br/>
&gt; is too bad. I guess because it&#39;s fire based (?). My best DOT and I can&#39;t<br/>
use<br/>
&gt; it.. So I have to stick with Engulfing Darkness (resisted 50% of the time)<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; Poison Bolt (resisted 20% of the time). Also started using Vampiric<br/>
Embrace<br/>
&gt; because I&#39;m always getting into melee, but I have only seen it go off once<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; like 20 battles. Finally bought Lifedraw too (now that I&#39;m making money)<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; what a great spell over the lower one. 41pts of damage makes a big<br/>
difference<br/>
&gt; in this zone.<br/>
