<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2064990700">Harvester: If you don&#39;t have either the backing of high level guildmembers<br/>
or friends that are willing to blow a few hours/days on helping you get it,<br/>
don&#39;t worry about the harvester &#39;til you&#39;re in your 30&#39;s.  It&#39;s pretty much<br/>
the same with all the other Necro quests too.  They&#39;re designed to make you<br/>
waste the time you otherwise would have spent leveling, inching closer to<br/>
50. (Verant doesn&#39;t want you to hit 50 for fear that you&#39;ll leave and take<br/>
your money with you.)  Most of the items are there only for vanity&#39;s sake,<br/>
although I&#39;ve gotten addicted to permenantly being able to see invis.  <br/>
<br/>
I used screaming terror last night, and I love it.  People in my guild are<br/>
ALREADY asking me to join groups because of it.  It&#39;s a great spell, though<br/>
I haven&#39;t played with it on any yellows or evens yet.  If you&#39;re soloing<br/>
with a pet, use it, stacked with Shadow Vortex, and then a Darkness (which<br/>
will pull the mob as soon as the first tick of the DoT hits).  Bottom line<br/>
is, it makes us more useful/wanted in a group, which is something we&#39;ve been<br/>
lacking in.  And once you get to higher levels, you&#39;ll realize that if<br/>
you&#39;re not wanted in a group, you&#39;ll have a hard time getting anything good<br/>
without buying it.</div>
