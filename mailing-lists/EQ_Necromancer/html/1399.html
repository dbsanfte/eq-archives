<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-665318354">Starting with the level 16 pet your pet can both kick and bash, but can&#39;t do <br/>
both in one round, the same as any melee class.So I was wondering, how does <br/>
your pet determine which to use?Kick or Bash?I see him do both, but I never <br/>
checked to see if maybe it was in order.Like Kick, Bash, Kick, Bash, etc. Any <br/>
info on this?</div>
