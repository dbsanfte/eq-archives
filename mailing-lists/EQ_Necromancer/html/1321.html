<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1809696187">Unfortunately no. You may find bone chips on vendors,<br/>
but its only because players have sold some back. This<br/>
is one of the complaints that is being petitioned<br/>
about all the time by necros, since every other pet<br/>
class has unlimited supply vendors, while we don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;Is there any vendor in EQ with a unlimited supply of<br/>
&gt;bone chips.<br/>
&gt;I have found vendors with unlimited supply&#39;s of<br/>
&gt;batwings and other<br/>
&gt;components. </span></blockquote></div>
