<b>Subject:</b> RE: Hunting at 14 <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1751627037">You kill the NPC vendors on the sister island in OOT?  I thought they were<br/>
higher level than that.  Playing a dark elf necro and binding yourself in<br/>
Freeport is not something I would do, even if I killed &quot;one MILLION&quot; orcs.<br/>
<br/>
My 2 cents as I am also search for a place to hunt at 14.  Lavasotrm is good-<br/>
even killed several fire elementals and rock dervs.  But the place that I camped<br/>
I kept getting trained by everything- Fire ele&#39;s, Imps, and even that paladin.<br/>
Anyone know what level he is?  Anyway, I was zoning too much to make and good,<br/>
consistent exp gains.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;By far sister island is the best place to hunt for xp and money &lt;snip&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;BTW you would be killing sisters or Eroslilli or<br/>
 </span></blockquote>something like that.  a good thing to keep in mind is to bind yourself to<br/>
Freeport in front of the vendor on the dock because you will be so loaded<br/>
down you will hardly be able to move.</div>
