<div id="ygrps-yiv-202138951">Fear can be quite useful in the open but its very deadly in<br/>
dungeons.  However it has a long cast time.  As a necro I would suggest<br/>
using a Heart Flutter, then using Fear while your pet is wailing on it, then<br/>
hitting it with an Engulf or Heat Blood.  Repeat or go at it the normal way.<br/>
there&#39;s no good way to call off your pet, the mob will just follow it or<br/>
come after you.<br/>

&gt; Hello.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am curious to know if there are any tricks you can use to <br/>
&gt; get your pet to<br/>
&gt; last longer in a fight via use of the pet commands. For <br/>
&gt; example by backing<br/>
&gt; it off just before MOB swings ect? Seems both my necromancer <br/>
&gt; and my magician<br/>
&gt; can benefit from any such techniques that may work.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Besides the obvious healing your pet, I have found that <br/>
&gt; fearing the monster<br/>
&gt; gives your pet some free attacks. With my magician I have <br/>
&gt; found if I burn<br/>
&gt; the mob just right I can get it to strip off my pet and come <br/>
&gt; chasing me, but<br/>
&gt; not at full speed. The MOB sorta takes a few steps, then my <br/>
&gt; pet whacks its<br/>
&gt; back and it turns around and swings at my pet before coming <br/>
&gt; for me again. I<br/>
&gt; find that in this special condition my pet does much better <br/>
&gt; as its getting<br/>
&gt; some cheap attacks, the MOB is slowly moving towards me but I <br/>
&gt; can easily<br/>
&gt; walk back between casts, and the MOB seems less effective at <br/>
&gt; attacking my<br/>
&gt; pet over the time its walking to me. If I over burn the MOB <br/>
&gt; coming screaming<br/>
&gt; towards me in full frenzy and I&#39;m in trouble.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would love to hear any and all tricks for getting your pet <br/>
&gt; vs MOB to last<br/>
&gt; longer. Esp any tips regarding using pet commands during battle.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also, I am curious to know if anyone has tried to use GATE as <br/>
&gt; a way to buy<br/>
&gt; time in a fight. IE some form of the following. Bind yourself <br/>
&gt; near a zone<br/>
&gt; wall or some semi safe place. Then you go out and DOT a MOB <br/>
&gt; then gate (note<br/>
&gt; your staying in same zone). Mob runs to you while you run <br/>
&gt; from your gate<br/>
&gt; spot. When you see monster DOT again and gate. Repeat. Sorta <br/>
&gt; super kiting<br/>
&gt; using gate instead of SOW? This is very lame for sure, but from a pure<br/>
&gt; strategy point of view it interests me. Though I admit I <br/>
&gt; haven&#39;t tried it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for any help.<br/>
