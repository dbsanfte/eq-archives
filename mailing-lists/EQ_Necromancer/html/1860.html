<div id="ygrps-yiv-1649722215">to add to the confusion:<br/>
my pc is a PII 450mhz, 128MB ram, EIDE hard drive, STB Riva TNT 16mb card.<br/>
I have always had slow zoning compared to most people. usually 5 secs or<br/>
more slower.<br/>
Until last week i had a 56k dial up.<br/>
Last week i got 1megabit ADSL.<br/>
I have seen NO (ZERO) zoning time improvement. I have no idea why. sometimes<br/>
(earlier with 56k) i would zone quickly, but very rarely.<br/>
I would LOVE to know the real cause. My thought is I/O rates of your<br/>
subsystem. SCSI would be faster tha EIDE, but i can&#39;t test that. <br/>
<br/>
All I know now is that DSL is NOT making me zone fast despite that 60ms ping<br/>
i get to quake servers and 500kb/s download rates i get..<br/>

Hey, <br/>
<br/>
Question for the masses:<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m level 14 and about 2 bubbs from 15. I&#39;m in green pet hell. I had<br/>
heard the 12 level pet spell, well sucked. Do I get a reprieve at 16?<br/>
Can I look forward to yellow pets again?<br/>
