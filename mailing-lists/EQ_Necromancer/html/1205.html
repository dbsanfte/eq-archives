 </span></blockquote>You can kill them as you kill mobs. Start with pet to disrupt their<br/>
casting, than 2-3 dots, than lifetap till he&#39;s dead. Use fear if get in<br/>
difficult situation, while victim now can sit/stand to remove fear/charm<br/>
effects. Im playing de wizard, and even green to me human necromacers<br/>
were able to fear me with 100% success. One problem with it with great<br/>
probability you will not find corpse to loot :)</div>
