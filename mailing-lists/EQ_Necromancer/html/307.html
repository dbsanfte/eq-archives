&gt;  loot. I recently tried this again and found that my pet would no longer <br/>
&gt; attack<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have found that it is actually  not always true.  It depends on the <br/>
aggressiveness of the mob and its level to you.  Once your level difference <br/>
between monsters is too high, your pet will ignore it.  Basically, the fight <br/>
has to be a bit of a challenge.<br/>
<br/>
Also sometimes the monsters are aggressive enough to attack your pet, making <br/>
the fight happen.<br/>
