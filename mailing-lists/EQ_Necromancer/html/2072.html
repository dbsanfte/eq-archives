<div id="ygrps-yiv-420803348">&lt;&lt; I play a Errudite Necro....level 6 now on the Tallon Zek pvp teams server.<br/>
 Can someone give me a few ideas for the next few<br/>
 levels &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately this is the worst lvls for a Necro. Not much to tell you but <br/>
find a safe spot that has blue creatures and don&#39;t look at exp bar.  8th is <br/>
very tuff to get and slow, I went thru this lvl fighting black bears in Nek <br/>
forest. On your side of the world I&#39;d say everfrost or BB. If it was me I&#39;d <br/>
suffer in tox forest at least you be a litle safer as noone really hunts <br/>
there. <br/>
