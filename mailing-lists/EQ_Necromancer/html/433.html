<div id="ygrps-yiv-985480472">I&#39;m not looking for a spoiler, really, at least not too much of one.  Well, I suppose it depends on personal morals an-<br/>
&lt;voice in backround&gt;   &quot;Get on with it!&quot;<br/>
Anyways, Where is Hubard L&#39;rodd, who I&#39;m supposed to give this note to?  I think he is in Befallen.  BTW, this is NOT the skeleton Lrodd, I have tried giving him the note many times under many different circumstances, but the trade window doesn&#39;t pop up.  Kizdean Gix told me to contact him for more information.<br/>
Other question:  What monster holds the Mallet Mold?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,<br/>
