<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2091603167">i just bought the dagger of marnek =)  hehe, im so happy about it.  as a <br/>
main weapon im still using a giant snake fang tho, since the dagger is <br/>
mainly good for the bonuses (and, of course, if i need a magic weapon).  the <br/>
great thing about it is i can keep it in a thrown slot.  im pretty sure i <br/>
got a really great deal on it too (25pp)<br/>
has anyone run across a crook stinger?  i spent a week (real time) in lesser <br/>
faydark looking for a damn named wasp, but didnt find him.  in fact, a few <br/>
druids/rangers said they have been looking for it since after beta, and <br/>
still havent seen it.  perhaps it&#39;s gone?<br/>

&gt;Ok I like to keep up on al my weapon skills so I am maxed out in 1hb and <br/>
&gt;2hb<br/>
&gt;and pircing. Now that I am level 13 what do I get for a good weapon. I am<br/>
&gt;told a totem staff is good. But its seem slow to me. If you could tell me<br/>
&gt;what you sugets and where I an get the weapon of your choice I would be<br/>
&gt;thanksfull.<br/>
