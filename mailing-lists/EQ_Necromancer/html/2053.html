<b>Subject:</b> Collecting Bone Chips <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-508261892">I have a question that I think will benefit every single person on this list. <br/>
As you all know, once our supply of bone chips runs low, we then often times <br/>
have to spend a large amount of platinum buying a fresh supply from younger <br/>
players or spend several hours gathering them ourselves. In the hopes of <br/>
making this burden easier on all of us, I come asking : Where do you go to <br/>
collect your chips? I ask that anyone who knows of a good place to go when <br/>
seeking bone chips shares it with this list. Any and all replies are <br/>
appreciated.<br/>
