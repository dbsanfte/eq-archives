<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1258144855">Just looking for a little encouragement, was Level 7 the most difficult<br/>
for everyone?   I&#39;m struggling to get to 8, my pet doesn&#39;t seem to help<br/>
much and my Mana regeneration is very slow, even with meditate.  I know<br/>
things get better at 8 but will every level like this (11,15,19 etc.)<br/>
be this difficult?  Or is just me?  My ranger character advanced easily<br/>
until he hit the teens so this has been frustrating.   Is grouping the<br/>
only solution to problems like these?  Not my first choice....<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
