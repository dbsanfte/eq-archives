Mahomet made the people believe that he would call a hill to him, and<br/>
from the top of it offer up his prayers for the observers of his law.<br/>
The people assembled. Mahomet called the hill to come to him, again and<br/>
again; and when the hill stood still he was never a whit abashed, but<br/>
said, &quot;If the hill will not come to Mahomet, Mahomet will go to the hill.<br/>
