  Where in the Forest are the Shadowmen?  what lvl are they?  Can an L28 and a<br/>
  L25 take the 4 together?<br/>
  Can we pull one at a time?   Thanks<br/>
<br/>
  When you zone in from EC, head northwest, the /loc I *think* is<br/>
  around -1600,500 or thereabouts.  They&#39;re down in a bit of a valley by a<br/>
  monolith structure.  I highly doubt that a L28 and L25 could clear that<br/>
  spawn...I was soloing it for a while, basically target the highest /con send<br/>
  my pet and dot the heck out of him...wait for him to die then gate,<br/>
  hopefully before the other 3 finish the pet and come after me.  I was<br/>
  successful twice, died once, called for help :)  With a L35 nec, L35 warrior<br/>
  and L35 rogue, we cleared the spawn and all had about 2 bubbles of health<br/>
  remaining.  These guys are *tough* and way undercon&#39;d  Best to get a full<br/>
  group, with at least one primary healer, preferably 2, shaman buffs are nice<br/>
  too. :)<br/>
