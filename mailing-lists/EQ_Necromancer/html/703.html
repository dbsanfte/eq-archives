<div id="ygrps-yiv-1894792196">As a Human necro, I could get to the bank no problems.  As a Darkelf necro,<br/>
I can go to west and south Freeport without any nastiness (avoiding<br/>
merchants of course) but north freeport guards are KOS.  Never played a<br/>
gnome, perhaps one of our other dark brothers and sisters can shed some<br/>
insight.  There are secret doors in the city walls outside both gates, just<br/>
hug the wall until you pop into a tunnel, you&#39;ll eventually hear<br/>
spellcasting and end up in the guild.<br/>

Subject: [EQ_Necromancer] FREEPORT NECRO guild is where?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2 questions . . .   I am a gnome necromancer . ..<br/>
<br/>
1) Can I go to the bank in freeport and get money for necro guild or will I<br/>
be KOS in bank zone.   (Ins&#39;t the bank in North Freeport?)<br/>
<br/>
2) If I wanted to play it safe, get my money from Akkanon bank then take<br/>
boat to Freeport, HOW DO I GET to the NECROGUILD from the outside.  So guy<br/>
told me there is a passage from the wall in west free port that goes into<br/>
the necro guild from outside and I was wondering if anyone could give me<br/>
specifics on oing this. </span></blockquote></div>
