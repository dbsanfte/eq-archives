<b>Subject:</b> Vendor selling necro spells in wkarana <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1376964040">I was speakign to a lvl 50 necro on my server anad apparently it is<br/>
possible to buy harmshield on a female barbarian near qhills, by the water<br/>
or somewhere aroudn there in wkarana. I was wondering if anyone could<br/>
confirm/try this. Maybe she also has soem other spells, hopefully the lvl<br/>
24 pet one, which seems to have dissappeared everywhere. I though sk&#39;s got<br/>
the lvl 24 pet spell in which case it must be buyable somewhere, if anyone<br/>
knows please could you tell me. Thanks in advance, malados</div>
