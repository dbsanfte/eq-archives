<div id="ygrps-yiv-120417601">Hello<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m in a bit of a delima. I am currently playing a gnome magician on<br/>
mythannial marr named Veneficus and I have reached 15th level so far. I am<br/>
enjoying my time for the most part. As with any class/race combo there are<br/>
problems, but I can mostly live with them. The Olympic jump I need to make<br/>
to get onto the boat between freeport and butcherblock is a Pain, and not<br/>
having the research components in the game for 24+ level pets is a pain (but<br/>
by the time I&#39;m there it&#39;ll most likely be fixed). We&#39;ll enough rambling and<br/>
back to my point.<br/>
<br/>
I am thinking of playing a different char to give myself a break from time<br/>
to time from my main one. I have seriously considered a halfling warrior but<br/>
I think I&#39;d get board of any warrior type FAST as you just stand there with<br/>
almost no strategy involved. The only real classes that seem to be worth a<br/>
second character are druids and necromancers.<br/>
<br/>
Druids seem very well rounded and but i&#39;m concerned they will be too<br/>
crippled in a dungeon, and I think dungeons can be a blast to fight in. I<br/>
didn&#39;t take a Necromancer in the beginning as I was VERY afraid of the KOS<br/>
in most places. However, now that I have a basic feel for the game I&#39;m not<br/>
so afraid of that and I&#39;d be a dark elf so my home town will like me. It<br/>
seems that necromancers fight their own way with their pet so it wouldn&#39;t<br/>
feel like my magician feels. Also I&#39;d be tall for a change hehe.<br/>
<br/>
What do you all think. Are necromancers and magicians soo close together<br/>
that I&#39;d feel like I&#39;m playing the same character? Should I thus take the<br/>
druid for a different feel? Are they any MAJOR short falls to being a<br/>
necromancer due to things in the game still being broken?<br/>
<br/>
It seems that necromancers are stronger characters then some other classes<br/>
with the balance coming in terms of difficulty with faction. Is that true?<br/>
Also, what level would I have to take my necromancer too in order to get a<br/>
feel for what its like. it was a minimum of 8th better 12th to get a feel<br/>
for what a magician is like. <br/>
<br/>
Any help is welcome.<br/>
