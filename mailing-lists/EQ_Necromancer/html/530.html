<b>Subject:</b> where do I hunt at 5th lvl? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1361819235">I made 5th lvl last night and my little gnome necro is doing fine, but I can see now I am starting to get too powerful w/ my big Skeleton buddy for the kolbolds.  They CON Black and when I was 4th I was taking on 2 yellows and winning! I love being a necromancer.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway where can I go to find L5-9 MOBs in STEAMFONT???<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!</div>
