<div id="ygrps-yiv-1016100512">Same thing happened to me and my 22 wiz.  I just couldn&#39;t take it anymore,<br/>
so I started a DE Necro.  Around the same time, a friend of mine was getting<br/>
tired of his 24 warrior, and did the same thing.  We haven&#39;t looked back<br/>
since, and have now outlevelled our original characters.  Best choice we<br/>
ever made.<br/>
<br/>
Faction is NOT a problem, so don&#39;t let that discourage you.  You just learn<br/>
to pack a lot with you when you go on extended travels.  I&#39;m about to hit<br/>
lvl 24 and haven&#39;t even needed to set foot in North Freeport or Feydwer in<br/>
all this time.  There are always ways to raise faction, some of which are<br/>
much easier than you might think.  I did the &quot;Note for Rebby&quot; and &quot;Note for<br/>
Janam&quot; quests simultaneously for about 2 hours.  I went from barly tolerated<br/>
to &quot;warmly&quot; in East and West freeport.<br/>

&gt; Ok, Thanks for the info.  Thanks to you also, Cory.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; On a side note.  I started Alazzar because I got discouraged with my level<br/>
&gt; 23 bard.  I just got tired of dieing all the time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well last night I made 2 1/2 bubbles of xp in 2 1/2 hours.  My bard never<br/>
&gt; did this in his life.  I was amazed at how quickly my pet and I<br/>
&gt; were mowing<br/>
&gt; thru mobs with no downtime at all.  I am looking forward to<br/>
&gt; playing Alazzar,<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m just going to have to get used to the faction thing.  I haven&#39;t had to<br/>
&gt; deal with it yet.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Good hunting,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Alazzar<br/>
