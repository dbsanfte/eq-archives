<div id="ygrps-yiv-1923387366">I&#39;ve been looking at some .mpg&#39;s of the up-coming Asheron&#39;s Call, and<br/>
have been wondering people&#39;s thoughts and opinions of this new online rpg<br/>
is?  I know lots of you are die-hard EQ fans and I&#39;m not meaning to step on<br/>
your toes with this, but Asheron&#39;s Call looks mighty decent and sports<br/>
better graphics -- to an extent, at least, with things such as blowing<br/>
leaves.  But the thing I&#39;m mostly interested in is the world.  I&#39;ve been to<br/>
the web sites, but of course they&#39;re only going to give you a one-sided view<br/>
of things.<br/>
<br/>
    Thanks folks,<br/>

Oh, and... Impart Strength is a good idea with your skelly.  I gives an okay<br/>
boost to strength and it certainly does help to counter the weak pets.  Just<br/>
remember to click on it and cancel if your pet falls and you have to go hand<br/>
to hand.  No sense in going at it weaker than  you already are. :-)</div>
