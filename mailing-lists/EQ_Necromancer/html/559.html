<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1129581341">I am a lvl 13 necro adventuring in lavastorm and the first part of Najena and I have a few questions on the level 12 spells.  Does anyone use wave enfeeblement?  Its an area effect spell that i was thinking of buying for use on skele and orc mobs.  Noone has it that I know of and was just wondering what it does and how potent it is.<br/>
<br/>
Also have some questions on robes.  What would be better to go for:  the gossamer (white) robe found in befallen or the black flowing robe in Najena?<br/>
<br/>
Also, should I make the runed totem staff my goal for a new weapon or is there something else out there for a necro?<br/>
<br/>
Also, If I were to buy these items, anybody have an idea of a fair price?<br/>
