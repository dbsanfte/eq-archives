<div id="ygrps-yiv-900589497">Yep the Druids are lossing it over this one, I have a High level Druid as well and if they do go through with this then that class will be pretty much worthless, However on a Side note, they are trying to weaken the Necro pets as well, I see this as equaly nuts, Granted our DOT&#39;s are great but our DD&#39;s are kinda Blah, Nerf the pet and we die easy, you may want to include the pet Issue as well.<br/>

  Subject: [EQ_Necromancer] Petition....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I pulled this off a druid list I think everybody should sign it.<br/>
   <br/>
  &quot;I am going to send an email to the eqdruids.com webmaster and ask him to start a<br/>
  petition to STOP the anti-kiting patch.  PLEASE, everyone who is a druid player go<br/>
  to the website and sign the petition.  Verant has many more much more important<br/>
  things to fix than this.  I will post here when the petition is up at eqdruids.com.<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks to one and all.<br/>
