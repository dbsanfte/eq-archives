<div id="ygrps-yiv-1495131305">I have a Viper V550 and will continue to use it for some time.  I also have<br/>
a VooDoo3 3000 in a second PC that is great too.  If you have the cash<br/>
though ($300)  get the new Ge-Force card that is out.  I can&#39;t remember the<br/>
name, but it has a 400 mhz processor on the card and 32 mb of DSDRAM (runs<br/>
at 200 mhz bus speed on the card).  You would not believe what it does for a<br/>
PC.</div>
