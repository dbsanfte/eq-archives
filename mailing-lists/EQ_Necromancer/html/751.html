&gt; The Dagger can be found on Priest Amiaz in Befallen on the Third<br/>
&gt; Floor.  It is a rare spawn, but not as bad as the BBC or Gossimer Robe I<br/>
&gt; think.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As for Pending Lore, I do not know.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been a lore item all along. :)<br/>
<br/>
as far as being rare, my monk friend got 6 of them in the time he was<br/>
looking for barbed leggings for a cleric.  definitely not as rare as the<br/>
robe/bbc.<br/>
<br/>
one of the cool things about it is, you can put it in your ranged weapon<br/>
slot, and still carry your glowing crook/runed totem or what have you.<br/>
Since the dagger is only 3 dmg it&#39;s mostly sought after for the magical<br/>
additions to your stats. (+5 int and some mana I believe, I&#39;ll have to check<br/>
next time I&#39;m in game) by carrying it in the ranged slot, you still get<br/>
those benefits, without having to downgrade your melee damage severely.  Of<br/>
course if you aren&#39;t using a magical weapon already, by all means put it in<br/>
the primary melee slot. </span></blockquote></div>
