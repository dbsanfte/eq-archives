<div id="ygrps-yiv-1746968440">I am planning on starting a Necromancer today and I have had no<br/>
experience using pets. I was wondering what hot buttons I should<br/>
configure in terms of Pet Commands and how and when I should use them in<br/>
<br/>
order to use them effectively? I also plan on grouping regularly<br/>
(unfortunately, mostly with good races) and I was wondering if this has<br/>
any impact on my pet and how? Any tips you would be willing to give a<br/>
young first time DE Necromancer on BB would be appreciated.</div>
