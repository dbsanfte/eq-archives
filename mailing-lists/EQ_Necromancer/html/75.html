<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-823254551">Well for me levels 5 6 7 8 were the hardest to get.  At level 8 with new<br/>
spells i grabed new summon spell and ward undead and soloed a dwarf skeleton<br/>
spawn that spawned 4 skels and got level 9 in hours. Then i soloed<br/>
chessboard to level 12, level once a day.  Then I killed orcs from 12 to 16<br/>
solo and got 1 level per day.  6-7 hours.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;Just looking for a little encouragement, was Level 7 the most difficult<br/>
&gt;for everyone?   I&#39;m struggling to get to 8, my pet doesn&#39;t seem to help<br/>
&gt;much and my Mana regeneration is very slow, even with meditate.  I know<br/>
&gt;things get better at 8 but will every level like this (11,15,19 etc.)<br/>
&gt;be this difficult?  Or is just me?  My ranger character advanced easily<br/>
&gt;until he hit the teens so this has been frustrating.   Is grouping the<br/>
&gt;only solution to problems like these?  Not my first choice....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks,<br/>
