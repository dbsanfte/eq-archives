<div id="ygrps-yiv-1345836203">Which evil eye was it?  At 29th, I could solo them with my pet.  And close<br/>
without.  They were almost always green to me, except the Lords.  They were<br/>
barely blue.  All you need to cast to kill it is your DD spell twice.  The<br/>
only thing is, they like to knock you back with their spells, effectively<br/>
interupting your spell.  If it was the King, then I&#39;m not sure.  Didn&#39;t see<br/>
him spawn while I was there.<br/>
<br/>
In a group of 3 I know that lvl 20&#39;s can take them out.  The only real<br/>
danger is if they concentrate on one.  They have pretty hefty DD spells, and<br/>
the Lords love to charm (resisted 3 of them while my pet beat them down).<br/>
