They are mean critters, and if your first darkness/fear spell does not <br/>
stick, you may not get another chance.<br/>
<br/>
You are far better off soloing Vhalen at the well in SK.<br/>

&gt; &gt; lastnight I made 34 :)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Spectres and SG are now even or yellow, and I was hoping someone here has<br/>
&gt; &gt; solo&#39;d spectres in oasis before... and could tell me a couple of tips :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Congrats! :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As far as specs in Oasis go, you should be able to solo one...however you<br/>
&gt;can&#39;t pull singles off the island until you hit 46 or so.  So until you can<br/>
&gt;do that safely, avoid being the only one fighting them as it&#39;s rather rude<br/>
&gt;to kite one then train the rest of the island to zone everytime ;) a nice<br/>
&gt;darkness/fear/pet combo will finish one off easily, as with any outdoor mob.<br/>
&gt;Just get one to yourself and keep him feared  and slowed while your pet does<br/>
&gt;the dirty work.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;This list is basically unmoderated.  However abusive language will not be <br/>
&gt;tolerated<br/>

The demon is a liar. He will lie to confuse us. But he will also mix lies <br/>
with the truth to attack us. The attack is psychological, but powerful. So <br/>
don&#39;t listen, remember that, do not listen.<br/>
