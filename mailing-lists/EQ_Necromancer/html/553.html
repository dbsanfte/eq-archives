<div id="ygrps-yiv-1605241793">I don&#39;t have a full answer, but here&#39;s a partial anyway --<br/>
<br/>
As far as trade skills go, they all start at 0.  Even when you train<br/>
at level 50 finally, you start at 0.  The most points your guild will<br/>
train you for is the first 20 points of any particular trade skill.<br/>
(Sometimes I&#39;ve been able to squeeze in 21, but close enough)<br/>
<br/>
After that it tells you, that you must practice the skill in the real<br/>
world.<br/>
<br/>
Other skills work the same way, except that after the initial 20 (again,<br/>
this number seems to vary a tad depending on the skill) but then you will<br/>
have to pay money to practice.<br/>
<br/>
There are also those skills that you get because of your particular class<br/>
or race, that are given an initial &#39;boost&#39;.  This includes examples like<br/>
the necro&#39;s Hide skill.  It&#39;s initially at Below Average, meaning you&#39;ve<br/>
got a 40&#39;ish skill in it already.<br/>
<br/>
Skills that you aquire, like Dodge, Dual Wield (for other classes) start<br/>
out at a higher skill value than 0.  This is diffrent for all the skills<br/>
as far as i&#39;ve been able to tell.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; when doing trades, is 25 the maximum level your guide can train ? or is 25<br/>
&gt; the maximaum skill points u can put into it?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; i heard if u are , for example level 15, and u put one skill point into a<br/>
&gt; trade..your skill automatically become 15 as oppose to 1.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; i know it isn&#39;t a necro question but i would appreciated it if someone can<br/>
&gt; answer it for me . </span></blockquote></div>
