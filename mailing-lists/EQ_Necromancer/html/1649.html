the pirahna in the lake there.  They are great xp up through level 10 and<br/>
they spawn quickly.  They also drop a tooth that you can turn into Fiddy<br/>
Bobeck right there for another big chunk of xp, a gold, and some RV factions<br/>
(RV merchant faction which is hard to get), and sometimes an additional item<br/>
like a pouch, food, or beverage.  You only have to be dubious to turn in the<br/>
teeth.  While your waiting for the Pirahna to spawn, you can kill the trout.<br/>
All added up you can make 4 plat an hour if you can keep up with the spawn<br/>
rate.<br/>
<br/>
Great xp, good faction, excellent money maker, and unlimited food, its a<br/>
great place to go at your level.  The only downside is that this place is<br/>
slowly catching on, but isn&#39;t a problem yet.<br/>

P.S. Beware of the cleric guild near the Kith zone, I have never been able<br/>
to fix my faction with them.  you may want to plan on going here at 8th<br/>
level when you get gather Shadows.  That will give you time to kill some<br/>
Deathfist orcs to get enough faction to walk safely in RV.</div>
