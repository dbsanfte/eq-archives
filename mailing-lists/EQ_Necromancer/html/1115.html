<div id="ygrps-yiv-1243876648">Does anyone have the loc for Tib? I&#39;m level 26, and heard this wasn&#39;t the<br/>
best place to solo (unkempt druids), but the two treants and the aviak city<br/>
are sooooo over camped on my server. Even at 4 in the morning when only 550<br/>
are on the server, at least 65 are in S. Karana. If anyone has better ideas<br/>
of what to solo at this level, I&#39;d be very interested in hearing from you. I<br/>
really don&#39;t like the idea of wandering mobs sneaking up on me - but its<br/>
better than waiting 2 hours for a damn aviak....<br/>
