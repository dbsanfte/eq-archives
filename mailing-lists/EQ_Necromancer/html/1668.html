have a nasty venom.  If you use a pet, watch his HP after the fight.  Stay<br/>
on the north end of the zone.  I pulled to my pet sitting on the slope of<br/>
the border between the bandit camp and the Gorge zone.  I spent a lot of<br/>
time there and I was never bothered by anything there except once Droon<br/>
killed my pet while I was away pulling.<br/>
<br/>
  Also in EK is Milea Clothspinner who is never camped, but she doesn&#39;t<br/>
spawn as fast as you would like.  Milea can be found on the valley floor on<br/>
the way to High Hold.  She spawns in a short tunnel and doesn&#39;t wander.<br/>
<br/>
  When you get a few levels, you can try Squire Wimbley.  You can take him<br/>
when he cons yellow, but he hangs out with Sir Morgan who is 30th.  If you<br/>
see someone camping Sir Morgan, or you see a griff kill Sir Morgan, go for<br/>
Wimbley, he is pretty easy for a Yellow and great XP.  Squire Wimbley spawns<br/>
by the bridge and waits a couple minutes before walking over to join Sir<br/>
Morgan, this is a good time to kite him along the beach.  Wimbley has a very<br/>
fast spawn rate.  You probably wont have enough down time to control his<br/>
spawn before he walks over to Morgan.  2 necros can control Wimbleys spawn<br/>
if you can get someone to give you a head start by killing Morgan once.<br/>
