<br/>
What it is (and I have tested and seen this...) is that when you are <br/>
invisible... EVERYTHING cons indifferent... whether they are KOS or they love <br/>
you.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>So if you were visible when you conned, then in general you are safe around <br/>
town.  The trick is that all people in town are not the same faction (though <br/>
all guards in the same zone are the same faction).<br/>
<br/>
most of the mages guilds HATE necros... so hopefully there is a place where <br/>
you can see a wizard first... and con them from a distance while invisible to <br/>
see.  I cannot speak for felweith... I only know freeport.<br/>
<br/>
A good example of the variation on factions within a town is Qeynos.  I am a <br/>
Dark Elf Necromancer, I have killed enough in Black Burrow and Paw that I am <br/>
now Dubious to the guards, and human merchants...  so I wandered to the bank, <br/>
then went in a building out of the way... when all of a sudden an Elf <br/>
merchant from the middle of nowhere came and sluaghered me (Double attack fo <br/>
100 each, and a bash for 68... and another hit before I could get of feign <br/>
death...)<br/>
<br/>
On a side not for you.  If you have killed enough Orcs in crushbone to change <br/>
your faction with Felwith... you are probably KOS in the Neriak and Nectulos <br/>
forest (Dark Elf Zones)<br/>
