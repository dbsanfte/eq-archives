<div id="ygrps-yiv-350535957">Well the spell has a short distance associated with it, you might not be<br/>
able to go over a hill but maybe hide behind a tree.<br/>
<br/>
Before they &quot;fixed&quot; it, you were able to bring up a pet, cast the spell on<br/>
him, then destroy the pet. The spell would still be up though. You then<br/>
could make yourself invisible and say run up to Orcs while people were<br/>
hunting them and make the Orc say &#39;Please don&#39;t kill me, I&#39;m not bad, I&#39;m<br/>
just misunderstood.&#39;. You could make any NPC say something as long as you<br/>
were standing close to him and that NPC targeted.<br/>

Seems so, but could be fun nonetheless.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Was cool before they nerfed it way back... fun for<br/>
&gt; gags and such, but not anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Hmm.  Maybe I&#39;m confused on what it does.  I figured I&#39;d be able to park<br/>
my pet, go over a hill, cast the spell, and have Slim make lewd comments<br/>
at passerby.  <br/>
<br/>
What was the nerf, and what does it do now?<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and regardless, where can I find it?<br/>
