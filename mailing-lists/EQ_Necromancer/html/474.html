&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m frustrated. I&#39;ve got a level 9 Necro DElf, based in Nekk Forest. I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;got 2 problems: a lack of cash and difficulty in gaining exp.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve been in in Nekk Forest, and I prefer to solo for the most part. The<br/>
&gt;problem is finding targets to hunt. In Nekk forest, the only mobs that give<br/>
&gt;me experience are Kodiaks and some skeletons. Mummies and zombies too, but<br/>
&gt;those are even more rare, plus there&#39;s usually 3-4 other PC&#39;s camped at the<br/>
&gt;spawn sites. The Lava zone seems to be too high-level for me (from reports<br/>
&gt;from others), and while Eastern commons isn&#39;t too bad the Griffins are<br/>
&gt;murder and getting poisoned by an asp has killed me twice. Last time I went<br/>
&gt;through the commons I died enough that I lost all the exp. gained.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;On top of this is cash flow problems. Since the rank 3 spells each cost 4.5<br/>
&gt;pp, it&#39;s bloody expensive getting them. I picked up tailoring as a trade to<br/>
&gt;hopefully help get extra money, but my skill is maxed at 30 from patchwork<br/>
&gt;armor, and I don&#39;t know that I want to take up smithing to increase it some<br/>
&gt;more (by making studded and re-inforced etc.). I&#39;ve considered maybe taking<br/>
&gt;up another trade to help with getting extra money. Any suggestions?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Desperately waiting to hit 12th level and get some decent offensive spells<br/>
