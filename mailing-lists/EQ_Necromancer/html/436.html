<b>Subject:</b> Re Gnomes in Neriak(or other non DE) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2108319363">As I understand it all necros regardless of race can visit the guild in<br/>
Neriak.  Thats the GUILD, however, guards may still KOS ceretain races<br/>
so conn them.  The guild is guarded by Ghouls who will KOS most non DE<br/>
who try and enter there, as well as the wandering pets who may take<br/>
exception to other races.  Use invis to enter, conn guards from a<br/>
distance, if they aren&#39;t immdiately hostile cast invis to undead once<br/>
you enter the third gate of neriak and you should be able to get past<br/>
the Ghouls.  Just remember to recast it after you visit the guild when<br/>
trying to go past the ghouls again.  THe secret here is to conn<br/>
everything before getting within attack range.  Also, if you&#39;ve been<br/>
killing Crushbone Orc don&#39;t even go into Nektulous forest, the Indigo<br/>
Brotherhood is the Dark Elves so your faction is probably in the KOS<br/>
range.<br/>
