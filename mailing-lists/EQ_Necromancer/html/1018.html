<div id="ygrps-yiv-1864407164">I don&#39;t think this is a bug. When the game originally opened, the decaying<br/>
gnome skeletons didn&#39;t give you a faction hit. They changed that when they<br/>
moved the necromancer guild down into the mines. I believe the said<br/>
skeletons affect your faction because Verant decided they were summoned by<br/>
the gnome necro guild. If you con them, they are amiable to you. Originally,<br/>
they were aggressive.<br/>
    If in doubt about a skeleton, con him. Any of the ones that will affect<br/>
your faction with the Dark Reflection won&#39;t be aggressive to you, I don&#39;t<br/>
believe. That is the way with some of the regular gnome skeletons. Some are<br/>
aggressive to you, and carry no faction penalty to kill them, while others<br/>
are amiable, and DO affect faction. ALL of the decaying gnome skels are off<br/>
limits, however, if you value your faction.<br/>
    As far as the Dwarf skeletons in Butcherblock, none of them affect your<br/>
faction with Dark Reflection.<br/>

&gt; Decaying Gnome Skeletons for some reason give you a faction hit in the<br/>
Gnome<br/>
&gt; Necro Guild personally I think this is a bug because it&#39;s not like that<br/>
for<br/>
&gt; any other newbie areas.<br/>
