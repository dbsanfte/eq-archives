for Guk.  It&#39;s down in Innothule swamp next to the troll city.  There you&#39;ll<br/>
find tons of little froggies just dying (sorry for the pun, couldn&#39;t resist)<br/>
to give you their woven armor.<br/>
<br/>
A warning, though.  Don&#39;t do it solo and check your pet with the coat girl<br/>
at the door unless you&#39;re extremely talented at keeping it under control.<br/>
I&#39;ve seen so many pet related train deaths in that dungeon that those cute<br/>
little skeletons ought to come with a warning label from the surgeon<br/>
general.<br/>

&gt;   I am curious if they&#39;ve changed how you get Journyman Boots such as they<br/>
&gt; changed the Oracle Robe to a quest (speaking of which, does he attack DE<br/>
&gt; Necros?)?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     Also, if so how do I get started?<br/>
&gt;     And if not, what dungeon is she in & where&#39;s it located?  I need to<br/>
