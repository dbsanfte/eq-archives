<b>Subject:</b> Mipmapping question <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-566252433">Hi Folks,<br/>
<br/>
Since we&#39;re on this topic...<br/>
<br/>
I have a Diamond Viper V770D Ultra (Riva TnT2 chipset) with 32 megs of video<br/>
ram.  That said:  I have been playing EQ for several months now, but have<br/>
never turned the &quot;Mipmapping&quot; feature on (although my clip plan is set all<br/>
the way out).  I&#39;ve always hesitated, because I don&#39;t know much about video<br/>
cards, and it says that it would have to restart in Glide mode (which I have<br/>
no idea what that means).<br/>
<br/>
With my video card, would I benefit from turning that option on?  If so,<br/>
why?  What the heck is mipmapping and what the heck is Glide mode?<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the flood of questions, but I&#39;m a real hardware newbie.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for your help,<br/>
