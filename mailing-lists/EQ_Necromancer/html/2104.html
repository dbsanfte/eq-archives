a more an ultrarare drop than a rare one. The &quot;I can see it in their hands&quot; <br/>
is not correct. I wish it were.  No reason to hail anyone to get the quest <br/>
started that I know of, just go see him after you get the book. I saw the <br/>
most drop in WC, but last I heard the shadowman behind the tomb in MM Castle <br/>
drops it more often than anyone. Bad part is this is a hit on Temple of Ro <br/>
faction and a plus to Shadowmen faction so you should make sure your Temple <br/>
faction is great before you go this route. He is also the guy that gives <br/>
another quest piece, sorry its early I forget which, for giving him the <br/>
flower you find in the tomb. Maybe youc an keep doing the flower quest over <br/>
and over as you kill him and keep Temple faction alive. Yeah this is cheesy, <br/>
but I feel being a necro is no different than a car salesman. Get what you <br/>
want, lie cheat and steal as needed.</div>
