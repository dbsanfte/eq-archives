<div id="ygrps-yiv-78939452">From one of the other post, it looks like the evil eyes in runnyeye are low<br/>
30 wiz&#39;s which would make sense since the evil eye took me down in 3 casts.<br/>
I have 620hp and there is no 20 level enchanter spell that can do that much<br/>
damage in so little time.  Looking at the 29level wiz spells there is an<br/>
inferno shock that does 237 + 1 per level dmg, so 3 of those and I&#39;m toast<br/>
so thats what it looks like I was hit with<br/>
<br/>
All I know is he got off 3 spells and I got off 3 spells (1 VOS and 2 SOP)<br/>
and he was standing and I wasn&#39;t.  His spells were fire based since I<br/>
remember something about my skin igniting.  <br/>

Oh, one thing that I forgot to mention was that Evil Eyes have VERY few <br/>
hitpoints for there level.As was earlier stated just blast them with your <br/>
Shock of Poison as quickly as you can.Should go down fast<br/>

 Which evil eye was it?  At 29th, I could solo them with my pet.  And close<br/>
 without.  They were almost always green to me, except the Lords.  They were<br/>
 barely blue.  All you need to cast to kill it is your DD spell twice.  The<br/>
 only thing is, they like to knock you back with their spells, effectively<br/>
 interupting your spell.  If it was the King, then I&#39;m not sure.  Didn&#39;t see<br/>
 him spawn while I was there.<br/>
 <br/>
 In a group of 3 I know that lvl 20&#39;s can take them out.  The only real<br/>
 danger is if they concentrate on one.  They have pretty hefty DD spells,<br/>
and<br/>
 the Lords love to charm (resisted 3 of them while my pet beat them down).<br/>
