<div id="ygrps-yiv-1347558344">My guy went to... Butcherblock? The zone outside of Kaladim, the dwarven<br/>
city. But he wasn&#39;t a necro so didn&#39;t need to worry about guards. Good<br/>
hunting there for him.<br/>

    I had a gnome magician once. When I got to 5 I left Steamfont. You CAN<br/>
still find rogue clockworks outside the newbie area, but you have to<br/>
constantly dodge young ebony drakes and things.<br/>

      I made 5th lvl last night and my little gnome necro is doing fine, but<br/>
I can see now I am starting to get too powerful w/ my big Skeleton buddy for<br/>
the kolbolds.  They CON Black and when I was 4th I was taking on 2 yellows<br/>
and winning! I love being a necromancer.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
      Anyway where can I go to find L5-9 MOBs in STEAMFONT???<br/>
<br/>
      Thanks! </span></blockquote></div>
