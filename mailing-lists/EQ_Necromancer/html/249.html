&gt; I&#39;m a Dark Elf in Neriak, and I can&#39;t find the Lesser <br/>
&gt; Shielding spell for<br/>
&gt; the life of me. Does anyone know who sells it? This is frustrating.<br/>

<br/>
As a general rule of thumb, most multi class spells are located on a COMMON<br/>
vendor that is positioned between the other classes in a guild. This is<br/>
usually stuff like gate and bind, and the shielding spells ect.<br/>
<br/>
The gate and lesser shielding spells are sold in Neriak in the Middle zone<br/>
in the building that has the wizard/enchanter/magician vendors. When you go<br/>
to the building I think it is the first vendor on the right.<br/>
<br/>
I know for sure its not in the necromancer&#39;s guild.<br/>
