&gt; Its not cost effective at higher levels.  Later on your pets start costing a<br/>
&gt; BUNCH and why run real far away and re summon when you can cast DoT spells<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>   What do pets start costing? I heard they went as high as 3<br/>
chips/summon, but levelled off (ie., never went to 4chips/summon or<br/>
higher). This is beta info though, so I don&#39;t know what they cost now.<br/>
