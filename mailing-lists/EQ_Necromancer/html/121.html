<div id="ygrps-yiv-1850095527">I think there&#39;s quite a slow setup in the level or two before you<br/>
get your new suite of spells every fourth level.  I am currently punishing<br/>
myself to get to level 16, and I really can&#39;t find any one good source of<br/>
XP, though the Oasis is doing alright for now.<br/>
<br/>
	I think that 8 to 12 is worse than 7th to 8th.  You are basically<br/>
relegated to killing only undead monsters.  All of your other offensive<br/>
spells are 1st and 4th level spells (Vampiric Embrace either doesn&#39;t work or<br/>
just plain sucks) thus most monsters you would face to gain experience in<br/>
the 8-12 range will shrug all of those off.  If we didn&#39;t get Ward Undead at<br/>
8th I would say Necromancers would be totally screwed.  But we do have it,<br/>
and it works wonders once you get it up to a decent level.  I just don&#39;t<br/>
like the fact that you HAVE to hunt Undead from 8th to 12th.<br/>
<br/>
	I also think its only really these lower levels that REALLY suck,<br/>
because after that you should be grouping up anyway and your new circle<br/>
spells are never TWO circles out of date from then on.<br/>
<br/>
	7th to 8th is the hardest by far due to many things, mostly being<br/>
lack of decent soloing monsters or security as well as underpowered spells.<br/>
I would say 8th to 12th is the most boring because its always camping at the<br/>
skeleton rune or going to Befallen/Unrest for days on end.  Again, without<br/>
Ward Undead, 8th to 12th would probably have been the point where I gave up<br/>
on being a Necromancer and became something else.<br/>
<br/>
	After that you&#39;ll start fidgeting whenever you hit that level before<br/>
your new spells, but it will never be as bad as those first several levels.<br/>

&gt; This is a question for experienced folks, and some advice for newbies.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 7th level as a Necro to date was the most frustrating level <br/>
&gt; for me (Dark<br/>
&gt; Elf, not sure if that makes a difference). Probably the main <br/>
&gt; reason is that<br/>
&gt; a lot of the creatures you used to fight for good EXP now <br/>
&gt; /con green to you.<br/>
&gt; Almost all large spiders, quite a few shadow wolfs, and a <br/>
&gt; number of bears<br/>
&gt; /con green and don&#39;t give you any EXP when you kill them. <br/>
&gt; This leaves skels<br/>
&gt; and tree snakes (Nek Forest) as the only reliable EXP you can <br/>
&gt; find. To top<br/>
&gt; it off, since you&#39;re maxed out in spells and armor at this point, you<br/>
&gt; usually don&#39;t have much reason to kill except to gain EXP to <br/>
&gt; level up, which<br/>
&gt; just makes it more monotonous. So, any newbie players to the Monks, be<br/>
&gt; warned that the 7th level will make you want to quit the <br/>
&gt; class (It almost<br/>
&gt; did me), if you can tough it out 8th level has some nice benefits.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The question for experienced players is: is this common for <br/>
&gt; anylevel before<br/>
&gt; a new spell rank? I.E. does level 11, 15, etc. seem to take <br/>
&gt; forever? Or is<br/>
&gt; it just level 7?<br/>
