<div id="ygrps-yiv-436627614">Druids in Rathe Mountains are harder now, at 27th they were all RED and<br/>
GREEN , no blue even or yellow<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I had my 38th Gnome Wiz out that way just this past week, after the most<br/>
recent patch.  2 of the druids were green to me.  Three of them were red to<br/>
me and one was yellow.  The only one that was yellow was the one that moves<br/>
around a bit.  The Unkept druids that wander in the area were all still<br/>
green and gave the same faction as before<br/>
<br/>
Of the three Red Druids, all three were red to the 45th warrior that was in<br/>
my group.  So yeah, I would say they got a slight level increase, since the<br/>
woman wood elf was blue to me at 30, now being red at 45th.<br/>
