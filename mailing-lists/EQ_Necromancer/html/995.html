<div id="ygrps-yiv-1023517907">The 16th level pet can also be found in Neriak.. it is in the merchant room<br/>
on the other side of the lodge (Make a right when you come in instead a<br/>
left)... I bought it there last night.<br/>

(Actually if you (or anyone for that matter) are on The Rathe I have an<br/>

    The level 16th pet and 20pet are found in the Grobb Shadow Knight guild.<br/>
As for hunting grounds I would suggest sticking to Oasis until 20 or at 18<br/>
or so you could move to Lake Rathe and hunt the undead at night and gnolls<br/>
in the day.</div>
