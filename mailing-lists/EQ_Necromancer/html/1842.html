<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1171972201">To all telling me to do the Red Wine quest, I have tried (and tried, and<br/>
tried, and tried) but you CAN&#39;T do it unless you are indifferent or better.<br/>
I am one notch down from indifferent at apprehensive, and at apprehensive<br/>
(or dubious I assume) you cannot do the red wine quest OR the<br/>
Lightstone/Research quest with the DE merchant in S. Ro.  So if anyone has<br/>
any other quest that is possible to do at apprehensive that gives good<br/>
factions towards the Dark Bargainers, I would be extremely grateful.  Thanks<br/>
again!<br/>
