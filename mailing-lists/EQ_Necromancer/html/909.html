<div id="ygrps-yiv-817359848">the int addition is while the item is equipped, it is not a permanent <br/>
increase.  nothing in this game will grant a permanent increase to stats.<br/>
the bonuses granted by the int bonus increases the higher your lvl is- your <br/>
mana total is calculated by lvl and int, plus any +mana items<br/>

&gt;does the mana you have get increased immediately when you<br/>
&gt;add +int equipment, or does it only increase it after you<br/>
&gt;level?  what i mean is, do you get the same increase for<br/>
&gt;getting a +2 int earing and first wearing it at level 15,<br/>
&gt;as you would if you have had it since level 1? </span></blockquote></div>
