&gt; Subject: [EQ_Necromancer] Hunting spots<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I am currently level 20 and I am hunting Gorge<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hounds in EK. Are there any<br/>
&gt; &gt; suggestions as to where and what I should be hunting<br/>
&gt; &gt; to level somewhat<br/>
&gt; &gt; quickly. Speed is NOT of the essence, I guess I am<br/>
&gt; &gt; looking for a somewhat<br/>
&gt; &gt; safe yet efficient spot.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Couple places not often camped...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1) 19 shamen orc in Kithcor... zone from HH and turn<br/>
&gt; to your right then run till you get to corner. I never<br/>
&gt; died there, dont fear cause there are a few lower lvl<br/>
&gt; orc near by that could kill you... Dark.. (make sure<br/>
&gt; pets taunt it off) sic pet.. Dot... run... life tap...<br/>
&gt; run (I ran backwards) along the wall till mob is dead.<br/>
&gt; Dies realtivly guickly.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2) Lars McManuss is lvl 20 barb in WK kinda tough but<br/>
&gt; if your carful you wont die.. wouldnt try unless you<br/>
&gt; have atleast 150 int though.  I like to turn pets<br/>
&gt; tuant off... dark till it sticks...  DOT and LT till<br/>
&gt; dead with a fear thrown in on occasstion.  Good new is<br/>
&gt; a lot fo druids camp the area and with a sow i never<br/>
&gt; once died :-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 3) Cordelia Minister in NK is very tough but do able<br/>
&gt; but be prepared to zone a lot cuase on occasion you<br/>
&gt; will pull a guard by accident. she is lvl 18-22<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 4) In Lesser Faydark there is a GREAT npc that is<br/>
&gt; rarely camped. Forget the name.  Very near the zone to<br/>
&gt; Steamfont is some cottages.  She is in the one  to the<br/>
&gt; far southwest. Very safe as the zone is right there, i<br/>
&gt; got killed like 1 time in 2 lvls here i beleieve.<br/>
&gt; belive mob to be 20-22 in lvl.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway.. theres a few places.<br/>
