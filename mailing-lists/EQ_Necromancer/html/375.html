&gt;personally, i feel there are two reasons for becoming lvl 8, and that is<br/>
&gt;ward undead and bone walk.  there are a lot of other really food spells,<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;those should be your first two (and ward is so cheap there really is no<br/>
&gt;excuse for not getting it soon).  imagine turning L8 and automatically<br/>
 </span></blockquote>being<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;able to do 38 damage to undead!  per casting!  bear in mind, tho, that this<br/>
&gt;is the necro&#39;s first evocation spell.  i camped out at a ruin in nektulos<br/>
&gt;and just casted it on everything that showed up, even if it wasnt my kill<br/>
&gt;(one hit wont steal the kill), just to cap out my evocation.  once you have<br/>
&gt;it capped you can easily take 2-3 skeletons with your pet, and ive even<br/>
&gt;easily solo&#39;d two skels w/o a pet, just from having that spell.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;another spell that i have found is under-used by our class is Dark Pact.  i<br/>
&gt;cannot go on about how useful this spell is.  ok- seems simple... it takes<br/>
&gt;your hp and gives you mana.  but now imagine this- you have just spent all<br/>
&gt;your mana, and are safe (and at full hp, or close).  so just find a safe<br/>
&gt;spot, cast Dk Pact, and hide/gather shadows-  you&#39;ll be back to full mana<br/>
&gt;faster than any other spell caster class.<br/>
&gt;how about this- you are in a group or hunting with your pet.  you are<br/>
&gt;fighting a pretty tough monster, if you cast this at the beginning of the<br/>
&gt;battle you will have extra mana to cast longer (im sure there are times we<br/>
&gt;all wished we had more mana- now you can).  be careful not to get too wild<br/>
&gt;with the dark empathy if you are in a group, and if you get poisoned, good<br/>
&gt;luck to you.  but nobody ever said death magic was easy =)<br/>
