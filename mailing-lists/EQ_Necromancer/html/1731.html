<div id="ygrps-yiv-878503340">1) There is no easy spot. ALL shadowmen spots spawn<br/>
between 3 and 6 shadowmen, some you can&#39;t see. You<br/>
will have to have a group to take them. <br/>
<br/>
2) Good guards were recently upgraded in magic<br/>
resistance. There really are no good guards to pull<br/>
anymore. Rivervale wall guards are a maybe example,<br/>
east common guards are another maybe example. Find<br/>
corrupt guards to hunt.<br/>
<br/>
3) honestly, I would recommnend 29 and the new spells<br/>
with a group to do the quests. I did them at 28 solo<br/>
on a young server and died 11 times doing all of the<br/>
quests. It will be easier on an established<br/>
server...but.... :)<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1. i was looking at the temple/ro quests.  where is<br/>
&gt; a good place to pull <br/>
&gt; shadowed men from?  i know there are 5 in lavastorm,<br/>
&gt; but ive been having <br/>
&gt; trouble getting enough ppl to take the camp<br/>
&gt; (especially with sol calling to <br/>
&gt; them so nearby).  is there a single spawn anywhere? <br/>
&gt; im L25, btw, i believe <br/>
&gt; that is sufficient.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2. guards- is there somewhere to pull guards?  being<br/>
&gt; evil and all, i would <br/>
&gt; like to get some payback, but i got wasted looking<br/>
&gt; around for something in <br/>
&gt; RV yesterday.  there were three guards that werent<br/>
&gt; red, and one was green.  <br/>
&gt; the others were blue, but they were too close to the<br/>
&gt; reds to attack- oh <br/>
&gt; well.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 3. what lvls does one need to be to take on the<br/>
&gt; temple quests?  i read an <br/>
&gt; old post for the harvester, mentioning the writer<br/>
&gt; was L35 at the time.  is <br/>
&gt; 25 high enough?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; thats it for now!<br/>
