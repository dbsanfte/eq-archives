<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1916002105">Hi guys/gals,<br/>
<br/>
A friend of mine (another necro) and I recently hit level 30.  We decided <br/>
to pay good old Ulrich McMannus a visit in WK to try and get through &quot;Hell&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
The strategy on EQNecro makes use of our &quot;Screaming Terror&quot; spell, but I <br/>
just can&#39;t figure it out.  When it actually sticks, it seems to stick for <br/>
no more than 2 seconds, tops.  Am I doing something wrong?<br/>
<br/>
What we&#39;ve been doing is opening with Darkness (dooming), then running him <br/>
back to our ambush point on the zone wall.  Once there, we send the pets in <br/>
and fear him.  This strategy has worked well for us, as Screaming Terror <br/>
appears next to useless.<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts or comments about Screaming Terror would be <br/>
appreciated.  Success stories?  Failures?  Advice?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,<br/>
Mujahid, 30 Necro</div>
