<div id="ygrps-yiv-2065576631">Everquest will have a strong competition and also you must think that a<br/>
Asherons call will go gold 1 year after wverquest and that they will try to<br/>
exploit all mistakes wich everquest team done.<br/>
<br/>
Also asheron call have interesting idea of heritage sistem with passing exp<br/>
to higer lv and spell sistem can be interesting.<br/>
<br/>
Everquest will try to take this advantages down with future remake of trade<br/>
skills and with new better graphic in new addon.<br/>
<br/>
But everquest is long from its maturity as we have seen online games start<br/>
to be god only after some time after relase 6 months to 1 year is my opinion. <br/>
<br/>
Also Ultima online will get new remake in a new 3D look as ultima 9 if i<br/>
understand god some lord british intervieus<br/>
