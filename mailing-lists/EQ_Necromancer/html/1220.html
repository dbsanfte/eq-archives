<div id="ygrps-yiv-1111875492">i think what you need to look at is if his dmg average goes up.  ive noticed <br/>
there is a cap to what they hit for, but (usually with a better pet) they <br/>
will hit for max dmg more often.  also, check the damage he takes, and how <br/>
often he is hit.  i think the spell adds ac and hp mainly.<br/>

&gt;I was able to make the spell.  But when using it I fail to see any real<br/>
&gt;improvement in the max damage the pet does, nor unusual amounts of hitting<br/>
&gt;for extra times per round, and also there seems to be no way to tell how<br/>
&gt;long the spell works, or when it ends?  The pet  had no weapons just hands<br/>
&gt;and feet. At the time I was L28, and the pet spell was L24, and the max<br/>
&gt;damage the pet did, with or w/o the spell, was 22 a hit.<br/>
