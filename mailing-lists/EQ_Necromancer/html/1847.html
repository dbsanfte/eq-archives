<div id="ygrps-yiv-451779612">oh ya, in my previous posting i should have given more info.  you will want <br/>
the ddr (double data rate) card rather than the cheaper sdr (single etc) <br/>
card, as the ddr is (obviously) twice the speed in most cases.  in 3d cards <br/>
the memory is a bottleneck, and the ddr is a simple change in the memory <br/>
that resolves this.<br/>
<br/>
in that respect alone it is worth the extra money, as the card will have a <br/>
longer life in your computer.  i still have a tnt, and it still looks good. <br/>
i plan on building a new pc soon, and will put in all the good toys at that <br/>
time (hehe. i dont upgrade, i just build another. you can never have enough <br/>
computers, as i like to say).<br/>

&gt;I have a Viper V550 and will continue to use it for some time.  I also have<br/>
&gt;a VooDoo3 3000 in a second PC that is great too.  If you have the cash<br/>
&gt;though ($300)  get the new Ge-Force card that is out.  I can&#39;t remember the<br/>
&gt;name, but it has a 400 mhz processor on the card and 32 mb of DSDRAM (runs<br/>
&gt;at 200 mhz bus speed on the card).  You would not believe what it does for <br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt;PC.<br/>
