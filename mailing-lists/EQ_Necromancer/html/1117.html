<div id="ygrps-yiv-679048415">I&#39;ve spent the last 2 levels killing Guards at the guard towers. Problem is<br/>
they are covered by HGs and griffons at all times. Also the ones I&#39;ve found<br/>
are around level 22 - not much XP. One positive thing about them - they<br/>
spawn fast! I&#39;m sure there are guards around my level, I just haven&#39;t found<br/>
them yet....<br/>
<br/>
Damn those Qeynos kite shields are heavy....<br/>

No clue about the Rathe mountains, but as for things to kill at level 26, be<br/>
creative! or more importantly...be EVIL :) people kill darkelf guards all<br/>
the time...why not spread some of that love back to the good races, don&#39;t<br/>
stop with guards either, there are plenty of goodly npc&#39;s just waiting to be<br/>
slaughtered for xp and loot. :)<br/>
