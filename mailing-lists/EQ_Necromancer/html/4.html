<div id="ygrps-yiv-1727851992">I hear it does 38(+1/level) dam to undead.  In other words, a base<br/>
damage of 38, and + 1 for each level after eight. Say,  you get 40 dam to<br/>
undead once you reach 10th level. Something like that.<br/>
<br/>
    That may not be 100% correct, but it&#39;s what I&#39;ve been told at least.<br/>
And it is doing 38pts of dam for me at level eight at the moment. Nice<br/>
spell.  Looking forward to Dominate Undead.  Going to have fun with some<br/>
Dreads....Just have a long way to go.<br/>

&gt; What does that spell do?  How does it work as you cast it on yourself,<br/>
&gt; but no icon shows like aura, unless it replaces it?  Play on Povar, a<br/>
&gt; Gnome, and need some player friends. </span></blockquote></div>
