<div id="ygrps-yiv-1006856372">i often hunt with a lev 54 ogre warrior and we usually have a 2npc spawn<br/>
that we kill when we&#39;re not dungeon crawling, boring as hell but good xp.<br/>
one is a 6 minute spawn and the other is a 10 or so. when we get stuck with<br/>
2 spawns, i often screaming terror one of them, i dunno what it is with<br/>
these 2 npcs, but they have a very high level of determination, they REALLY<br/>
hate me and he&#39;s killed them tons more times then i have. I&#39;ve had my pet<br/>
kill one to 90% while it was bashing on my buddy while he was killing the<br/>
second one, it never turned to kill my pet.  Anyways, i often turn into a<br/>
chanter and mez em with ST when we have 2 of em spawn since it often saves<br/>
my butt since these buggers hit hard.  its a very quick casting spell and on<br/>
these blue mobs, very rarely resisted (unlike root!) <br/>

ST is usually used to break up a spawn.  Like to 2 sisters in the hut in<br/>
OOT.  Cast ST on one the other follows.  Usually if you get out of sight the<br/>
second will not come after you and you can break the spawn.<br/>

&gt; Hi guys/gals,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A friend of mine (another necro) and I recently hit level 30.  We decided<br/>
&gt; to pay good old Ulrich McMannus a visit in WK to try and get through<br/>
&quot;Hell&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The strategy on EQNecro makes use of our &quot;Screaming Terror&quot; spell, but I<br/>
&gt; just can&#39;t figure it out.  When it actually sticks, it seems to stick for<br/>
&gt; no more than 2 seconds, tops.  Am I doing something wrong?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What we&#39;ve been doing is opening with Darkness (dooming), then running him<br/>
&gt; back to our ambush point on the zone wall.  Once there, we send the pets<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; and fear him.  This strategy has worked well for us, as Screaming Terror<br/>
&gt; appears next to useless.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Any thoughts or comments about Screaming Terror would be<br/>
&gt; appreciated.  Success stories?  Failures?  Advice?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks in advance,<br/>
&gt; Mujahid, 30 Necro<br/>
