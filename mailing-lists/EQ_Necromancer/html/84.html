<div id="ygrps-yiv-1062292060">Well one  more time, since I received no usefull responses at all- maybe<br/>
I&#39;m not hitting the list right?   The above spell won&#39;t do squat for me<br/>
so it looks like I have no L8 offensive spells at all except for Ward<br/>
Undead, leaving me nothing but my pet for real help with non-dead<br/>
targets.  Can one of you instruct me how to use the VE spell and what to<br/>
expect from it?  I have cast it with no weapon, etc and all I see is<br/>
blue gas and lots of wasted mana!  Also where do you direct complaints<br/>
for fixes where someone actually sees them and responds?  Or is this<br/>
like UO where one has little hope of success?</div>
