&gt;  In the north part of Northern Ro, in the <br/>
&gt;  desert near the city is a merchant.  She <br/>
&gt;  sells to evil races, and is usually on the <br/>
&gt;  east side.  Recently she has moved to the <br/>
&gt;  west side, and farther north near the zone<br/>
&gt;   to E. Freeport.  More importantly she <br/>
&gt;  won&#39;t sell to me anymore.  Says she is busy.<br/>
&gt;  Has anybody seen this before?  She cons <br/>
&gt;  apprehensive to me.  She&#39;s been like this <br/>
&gt;  for several days, so its not that she just <br/>
&gt;  chased somebody to the zone. <br/>

&gt;  I am DE Necromancer.  I haven&#39;t been killing <br/>
&gt;  Dervs.  This is happening on the Fennin Ro <br/>
&gt;  server. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Dervs dont hurt his faction as he gives bad hits to the typical DE factions,<br/>
<br/>
or he used to. Pluses for Steel and Emerald Warriors. If your faction is ok <br/>
at home I might report this one too, but something sounds fishy there. <br/>
