<div id="ygrps-yiv-514548500">Not sure too much about the dots on pvp, I have started playing a DE enc on<br/>
Tallon to screw with peoples minds though, just hit 9th and will probably<br/>
start waxing the lighties at 16th : )<br/>
<br/>
The sister island should be good at about 12th for you.  What I did on Povar<br/>
at 12th was bind to the freeport docks so that if I got into any trouble, I<br/>
could just gate or if I died, I was ready for the next boat.  Being a DE<br/>
though, everybody else will want to kill you (pc&#39;s) if you bind on the dock,<br/>
so I would recommend binding under the docks to play it safe.<br/>

Hello all<br/>
<br/>
I play a magician, but i have transfered over to the dark side, hehehehe.<br/>
<br/>
I now am playing a necro full time on Vallon Zek.  I am still very very<br/>
<br/>
young, level 10.  Anyways, my question is when you pk and you use a dot<br/>
<br/>
if the dot kills the pc that you are pking you don&#39;t get to loot, correct?<br/>
<br/>
Is there anyway around this?  One more question also, What level should i <br/>
<br/>
before I head to OOT, and will it give me any faction hits for going there?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks all,<br/>
<br/>
Mlitin level 10 necro<br/>
