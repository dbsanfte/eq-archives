<b>Subject:</b> Re: FREEPORT NECRO guild is where? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-252967908">My gnome necro can go into North Free port, and it sure is nice to have a<br/>
bank there.   I didn&#39;t know about the dark elf eps bonus thing.  I wish I&#39;d<br/>
have played a dark elf now, but how was I to know about that.   My Gnome is<br/>
ZOOMING up though he mae 15th lvl in 3 days of play /played = 3days IE: 72<br/>
hours of play . . .<br/>
<br/>
not too bad, also I like the fact that I can go into good cities.<br/>
<br/>
(Elves excluded) hehe</div>
