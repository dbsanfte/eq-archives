<b>Subject:</b> Gnomes and their faction problem <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1869660335">Any gnomes out there that  can help me with this? Does killing gnome<br/>
skeletons really hurt your faction with your guild that much? I sure as<br/>
hell don&#39;t wanna buy my bone chips and not just kill them myself. Also,<br/>
does the faction hit only work on the decaying gnome skeletons in the<br/>
Ak&#39;anon area, or is it all over Norrath?  I hope this faction hit<br/>
doesn&#39;t make getting items harder than it already is. If anyone can<br/>
help me with this, please drop me a line.<br/>
