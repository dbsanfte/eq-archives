<div id="ygrps-yiv-1839634784">Im in Povar, New L16 Gnome necro, and cannot locate two spells; Banshee<br/>
Aura and Restless Bones.  Gnome guild doesn&#39;t have these.  Where can I find<br/>
them? How best to and get them?<br/>
<br/>
How best to control a pet, such as in Unrest?  While in the Castle in CB it<br/>
ran away and I lost 2 pets that way.  Would not respond to commands even<br/>
tho alive.  I found a L16 spell not familiar with; Spirit Armor?  And<br/>
lastly, with Heat Blood, Engulf Darkness, and Heart Flutter, if all stacked<br/>
about how much damage done?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any help!<br/>
<br/>
PS<br/>
<br/>
As I go up it appears its better strategy to make max use of pet and not do<br/>
much melee;  if so, how best to heal pet, and do I med, if possible, while<br/>
he fites (keeping a chk on health), then heal him up?</div>
