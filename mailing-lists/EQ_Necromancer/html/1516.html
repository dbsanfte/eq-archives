&gt;HI all, i have recently started my necro and am about to buy my lvl 16<br/>
&gt;spells I was wondering is infectious cloud worth buying?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Can&#39;t answer this, I never buy aoe&#39;s cause there necro death IMHO<br/>
<br/>
i know its area<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;effect and stops regen but what is the damage? I have read conflicting<br/>
&gt;reports, some saying it is only DD and some saying it is alos 100 dmg DOT,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It is a disease dot. Dunno the damage tho, prolly just enough to know off <br/>
natural healing<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;can anyoen clarify which it is? Also where should i hunt at lvl 13 to get<br/>
&gt;to 16 fast - i will usually hunt wiht either a lvl 12 monk or druid as my<br/>
&gt;partner - i hear oasis is good is that right?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oasis is where I went from 12-20, would goto Lavastorm mtns to get money for <br/>
my lvl 16 spells. Oasis is great xp, but the loot just plain sucks, If you <br/>
stick to low yellow/white cons and lower, you can solo Oasis<br/>
<br/>
FInally I hear i can buy my<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;lvl 16 pet spell in efreeport in some kind of cave, rather than research -<br/>
&gt;is that correct and if so where is this cave? -<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You can also buy it in Neriak, You can buy all the pets up to lvl 29, the <br/>
cave is by the entrence to freeport. When you zone into the sandy newbie <br/>
area between freeport and the commons follow the right wall walking towards <br/>
the wall and you will walk thru an invisible walkk... The necro vendors are <br/>
in there...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance, sorry<br/>
