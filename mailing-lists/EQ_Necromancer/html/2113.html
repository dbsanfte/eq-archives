Other 3D games (Quake, half-life) display well over 50fps at 1024x768x32,<br/>
but Kunark has noticeable refresh delay - my guess is 10fps at 800x600 in<br/>
an open area, and no more than 5 in Warsliks with the clipping slider at<br/>
half and 640x480.  These are guesses, as there&#39;s no timedemo function for<br/>
EQ.  I think I can get it below 1 frame per second at 1024x768 with the<br/>
clipping plane all the way out.<br/>
<br/>
It is strictly rendering (and perhaps memory-to-graphics) speed - the hard<br/>
drive isn&#39;t getting used during this time and network traffic is pretty<br/>
low over my DSL line while doing these tests in a near-empty zone.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My suspicion is the dev team was very 3dfx-centric.  The only real<br/>
evidence I have is that half the features (gamma, mipmapping) don&#39;t work<br/>
except in Glide mode, and the fact that Voodoo owners seem to complain<br/>
less than TNT owners about speed.  <br/>
<br/>
Someday I&#39;ll have to take my Banshee card out of my Linux box to try EQ on<br/>
it.  My fear is it&#39;ll be faster than the TNT2 card for EQ, and much slower<br/>
for every other game on the planet.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone have any more concrete data on Glide vs DirectX speed in EQ?  I&#39;d<br/>
love to hear that it&#39;s just something I&#39;ve set up wrong.  Alternately, I&#39;d<br/>
perhaps be willing to go buy a Voodoo3 card if I knew for sure it would<br/>
make Kunark a lot better.<br/>
