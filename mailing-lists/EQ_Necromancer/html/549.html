<div id="ygrps-yiv-440295002">Definately, I agree with the magic system.  I was worried when I first<br/>
read about it, as mage-class is usually a very popular class. But when you<br/>
think &#39;bout it, it&#39;ll definately add an air of mystery, and I think the<br/>
class will level itself out. :-)  I also like how you find your spells and<br/>
such, with the phrases, gestures, and reagents and can experiment to create<br/>
your own.  I think it pulls you into the world better along with how the<br/>
magic system works out.<br/>
<br/>
    The major draw back I see to Asheron&#39;s Call is the world.  First, I<br/>
think Dereth is a silly name for a Fantasy world (Norath is certainly much<br/>
better a name:), and then there&#39;s the size.  The size of road island, they<br/>
say.  Well great, Antonica is probably bigger than that in and of itself.<br/>
:-)  I hope they&#39;ll add more.  Just so you folks know I&#39;m not trashing EQ.<br/>
;)<br/>
<br/>
    As for the graphics...from what I&#39;ve seen in the videos it&#39;s smoother,<br/>
but then they always use spiffy 3D cards for things like that.  With the<br/>
leaves and all, the impression I got from the A&#39;sC website was that the<br/>
fallen leaves would blow across the ground, whereas in EQ it&#39;s the leaves in<br/>
the trees.<br/>
<br/>
    I&#39;m going to have to look into this a bit more.  EQ may have some<br/>
competition. ;) But I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll hurt EQ by a long shot.<br/>
