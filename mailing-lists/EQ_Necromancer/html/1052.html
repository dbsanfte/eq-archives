<div id="ygrps-yiv-1025323987">Well, you can go to west karana, you will get nice xp there for your level,<br/>
but the place is crowded, and tends to get quite boring. I suggest that you<br/>
go to the freeport area when you are around level 10, the qeynos area is<br/>
rather boring. Around freeport you can hunt in north ro, east commons,<br/>
lavastorm and in south ro and oasis.<br/>

Theory is when you know something but it doesn&#39;t work.<br/>
Practice is when something works but you don&#39;t know why.<br/>
Usually we combine theory and practice: <br/>
nothing works and we don&#39;t know why.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am a level 6 necro playing in the Qeynos Hills outside of BB.  While I<br/>
&gt; am making good xp and cant complain, I am beginning to reach the point<br/>
&gt; where the XP out there is low.  Does anyone have any suggestions where a<br/>
&gt; Human Necromancer can go to level from 6-8, 8-12, 12-16, and 16-20?  I<br/>
&gt; know BB is a good source of XP and loot, but it is usually crowded and<br/>
&gt; there are trains which is never good for a caster, especially in such a<br/>
&gt; small area (running room wise).  Are the Karanas available at that level?<br/>
&gt; With where I placed myself, am I stuck there till a later level?  How can<br/>
&gt; we change our factions so, while the guards can sneer at us and call us<br/>
&gt; names, they will leave us alone in other towns such as Rivervale or<br/>
&gt; Freeport or even Halas?  While I am sure this is something that has been<br/>
&gt; covered time and again on this list and I apologize for redundency, any<br/>
&gt; info would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
