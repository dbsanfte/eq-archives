<div id="ygrps-yiv-594241668">This could be a hot topic for you hardline RPers, but we&#39;ll see. I am<br/>
interested in researching new spells. I am not interested in learning new<br/>
languages. I find that performing an action repetitively, as is required to<br/>
learn Old Erudian, is not my idea of time well spent. While I can appreciate<br/>
the role it plays in creating a cohesive environment, I don&#39;t want to have<br/>
to do it. I work during the day. People give me money. I play at night. I<br/>
give people money. Sounds fair. But not when I need to perform an action<br/>
that is not interesting or fun in pursuit of further happiness. While I am<br/>
completely OK with the option being available and even encourage it, I don&#39;t<br/>
want to be forced to spend my online time blabbering away with others when I<br/>
could be out getting slain repeatedly by elf skeletons. That being said,<br/>
here is my request: Does anybody have a listing of research combinations for<br/>
the necromancer class or know where I might find such a list? I have fought<br/>
and struggled through every other aspect of this game, and it was enjoyable.<br/>
But this is where I personally draw the line. I love this game, but I only<br/>
have so much free time. Thanks for any help you can offer.<br/>
