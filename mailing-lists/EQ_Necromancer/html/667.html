<div id="ygrps-yiv-1481266753">Well Unfortunately my Necromancer isn&#39;t quite that high level yet, however,<br/>
I do have other spell casting characters that run into this problem.<br/>
Actually I already have the problem a bit at level 10 with my Necromancer.<br/>
<br/>
Generally if I am in a group Gate is not memorized.  If something comes<br/>
along that will waste the party, we start running and my pet holds it off<br/>
so we can get a head start.  This tactic can be used when fighting solo too<br/>
and frees up a spell slot for one of those other spells that are more critical.<br/>
<br/>
The only time I keep Ward Undead in memory is if I am in an area that I<br/>
know will have undead, and I don&#39;t mean just decaying skeletons.  Currently<br/>
I fight in South Ro alot.  If I am killing orcs I don&#39;t bother with Ward<br/>
Undead, There just aren&#39;t enough undead in that area.  If I move to the<br/>
sand part yes it becomes a great spell to have.<br/>
<br/>
I trade off and on between Siphon str (in a group) and Impart Str when<br/>
soloing.  Though I will probably end up needing to drop this to fit in the<br/>
Heat Blood line.<br/>
<br/>
If I am in a group I am usually not in melee that much.  Hence I don&#39;t<br/>
bother to keep my Grim Aura going.  I do leave my lesser Shielding in<br/>
place.  Its just a pain to let it wear off.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t bother wish shadow step.  It may have its uses in PvP or if you<br/>
want to get to the bottom of a high wall and not take any damage, but mobs<br/>
target too well for this to really be that effective.<br/>
<br/>
I guess we can always hope that when they release the expansion in about 6+<br/>
months that they will redo the interface and make those spell icons a bit<br/>
smaller so we can fit more in the same space.<br/>

&gt;Subject: Curious on 8 memorized spells for lev 16 through 23 rd level play <br/>
&gt;ers ?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hail fellow necromancers<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am lev 14th and already finding it hard to pick exactly which 8 spells to<br/>
&gt;keep memorized. I currently don&#39;t keep shielding and grim aura memorized,<br/>
&gt;rather I cast and delete them, then repeat later when they wear off.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;When I&#39;m in a large group that is killing fast, I tend to use the low mana<br/>
&gt;spells like siphon str and disease so I can do this to all MOBS. I like to<br/>
&gt;keep gate memorized for emergencies, my best life suck spell, my ward<br/>
&gt;undead, and my best darkness spell as it slows the MOBs down if they are<br/>
&gt;fleeing or if I need to flee. I also find dark empathy handy to emergency<br/>
&gt;heal passerby&#39;s that are dying. I make a lot of friends that way. I also<br/>
&gt;find mend bones quite handy esp when I&#39;m soloing or in a group of 2 where<br/>
&gt;the other person is a wizard or other spell type. I also like the vampiric<br/>
&gt;embrace as I can tank at the beginning of a fight longer, back out and life<br/>
&gt;drain, then tank again. That extra 25 tap 2 or 3 times some fights has made<br/>
&gt;a big difference a few times.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So I have at lev 14 something like this memorized.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1)Best Life Drain<br/>
&gt;2)Vampiric Embrace<br/>
&gt;3)Englufing Darkness<br/>
&gt;4)Heat Blood (or if in lavastorm or big group Disease)<br/>
&gt;5)Dark Empathy<br/>
&gt;6)Mend Bones (or if in group with tanks siphon str or posion bolt)<br/>
&gt;7)Gate<br/>
&gt;8)Ward Undead<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I wish I had slots for fear and shadow step but I don&#39;t usually.<br/>
&gt;At lev 16 I see a lot of new neat spells. A new DOT. Feign Death. A spell to<br/>
&gt;make you immune to damage for a short time ect. I am at a loss as to how to<br/>
&gt;fit all the fun spells in. I&#39;m happy in the sence there are so many cool<br/>
&gt;spells I can sorta mix and match for the situation but its much more<br/>
&gt;difficult living with 8 spells at a time then when I play my lev 17<br/>
&gt;magician. I can mem and forget all my summon spells. My combat ones are<br/>
&gt;always less then 8. IE DD, AE, Gate, Damage Shield and I&#39;m about done with<br/>
&gt;important spells.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I was wanting advice from higher lev necromancers about what spells they<br/>
&gt;tend to load and for what situations. Esp for the lev 16 and the 20th<br/>
&gt;spells.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sincerely,<br/>
