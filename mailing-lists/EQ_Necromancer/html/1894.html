<div id="ygrps-yiv-113719800">So, if GLide is a strictly 3dfx technology:  Am I having less of a visual<br/>
  experience with my Diamond Viper V770D Ultra?  In other words am I missing<br/>
  something because I can&#39;t run in GLide mode?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  YES, but it isn&#39;t THAT much of a difference.   (I have both a 3dfx and a nvidia card in my computer and have run both)<br/>
<br/>
  It IS a noticable increase running in glide mode though... and a cheap voodoo2 card would be a good deal.   <br/>
  HOWEVER Windows 2000 DOES NOT support the voodoo2 cards. They DO support the voodoo3 cards.  I was pissed when I read the HCL . . .GRRRRRRR       Now I need to dual boot my computer again, SIGH  will there ever be 1 OS for me!?!?!?!  Sadly probably not in my life time.</div>
