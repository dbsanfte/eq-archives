<div id="ygrps-yiv-1450066650">Anyone know a vendor in Queynos who&#39;ll sell to a young Necro? I need Gate.<br/>
Can&#39;t find anyone in the PlagueBringer&#39;s Temple, and none of the above<br/>
ground mages will sell to me. I didn&#39;t try the Temple of Light honestly,<br/>
since I assumed I&#39;d be KOS in there.<br/>
<br/>
Loving this class. I took a Gnoll Watcher at level 4. Both my shaman and<br/>
rogue characters would&#39;ve been chewed up and spit out if they tried to do<br/>
that...</div>
