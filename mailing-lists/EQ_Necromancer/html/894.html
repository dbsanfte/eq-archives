<div id="ygrps-yiv-730967756">ya, i guess we forgot to mention that everything in lavastorm will resist <br/>
heat blood =)<br/>
as far as lifedraw, i always make the top 3 spells my new pet spell, new <br/>
ward spell, and new lifetap spell.  damn i love that lifedraw!  it was worth <br/>
turning L12 just for that.  and it is more mana efficient than lifespike, <br/>
but its a bigger chunk.  at L15 it doesnt really hurt the mana tho.<br/>
btw, are there any +int earings, or just the aged ones from before they <br/>
changed jewelcraft?  and what are they worth around?<br/>

&gt;Something else I noticed about Lavastorm, everything resists heat blood. <br/>
&gt;Which<br/>
&gt;is too bad. I guess because it&#39;s fire based (?). My best DOT and I can&#39;t <br/>
&gt;use<br/>
&gt;it.. So I have to stick with Engulfing Darkness (resisted 50% of the time) <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;Poison Bolt (resisted 20% of the time). Also started using Vampiric Embrace<br/>
&gt;because I&#39;m always getting into melee, but I have only seen it go off once <br/>
&gt;in<br/>
&gt;like 20 battles. Finally bought Lifedraw too (now that I&#39;m making money) <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;what a great spell over the lower one. 41pts of damage makes a big <br/>
&gt;difference<br/>
&gt;in this zone.<br/>
