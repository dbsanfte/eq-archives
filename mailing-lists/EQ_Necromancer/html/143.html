&gt;  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Your trip from Nektulos to Inothule:<br/>
Nectulos Forest (you know this)<br/>
<br/>
East Commonlands.  Low level area... if you make a LEFT out of nectulous (1-4 <br/>
level monsters), Medium level if you make a right (5-12 level monsters).  And <br/>
you have to watch out for Griffons (level 34!!!)  There is some mixing... but <br/>
GENERALLY if you stay by the road... you will be ok.<br/>
DarkElf Necro.  you are KOS to merchants, guards will leave you alone<br/>
Ogre... not sure about the guards, you can assume the merchants are KOS<br/>
<br/>
North Ro.  (A tunnel in the desert wall of East commons leads to this)<br/>
Low to medium.  You start out in the medium area, level 6 to 15 criters.  <br/>
Plus the rare Giant (HIGH level)<br/>
Guards leave the Dark Elves alone, merchants are KOS.<br/>
<br/>
Oasis.  (Take a right as you leave the tunnel from east commons to North Ro.  <br/>
Go all the way to the water, and take a right...)<br/>
High Medum to Low High level.  Level 14 to 25 critters.  Rather dangerous <br/>
place, but if you runa nd are lucky... you will make it.  Watch out for <br/>
Giants and Dry Bone Skeletons.<br/>
<br/>
South Ro.  (keep following the waterline to desert wall, then follow it)<br/>
I have no info...  as you enter keep to the right... you will find the chasm <br/>
that leasd to Innothule<br/>
<br/>
And there you are, in innothule.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Befallen <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; or Guk? Why? and what level should we hit the area?<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Befallen is better for low level players, but has the risk of high level <br/>
trains...  There are decaying, and plain skeletons on the upper level.  The <br/>
second level you need to be much higher.  (about 12th)<br/>
Guk Starts at a higher level (need to be 6 or 7) and trains badly also.<br/>
<br/>
Another reason is this.  Befallen is closer to Nektulos.  And In Neriak the <br/>
Ogre can get Shadow night spells, and train(I think... I know he can get <br/>
spells at least).  In the ogre starting city, I do not know of a place to <br/>
train or get spells for a necro.<br/>
