<div id="ygrps-yiv-1775343993">First off I&#39;m a Dark Elf Necro 14th lvl<br/>
1. I am looking for a place to make 16th? <br/>
2. And a place to go from 16th to 20th?<br/>
3.  And a place to go from 20th to 24th?<br/>
4. I got half cloth/half netted, two CT rings, and two electrum jaded bracelets. What else should I have for my lvl and one or two lvls away in the armor department.</div>
