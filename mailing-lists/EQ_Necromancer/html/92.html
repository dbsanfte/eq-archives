<b>Subject:</b> Ok now what trad? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2066902405">I am at level 8 and I am about to dump 20 skill points into a trad. I<br/>
thought I was going to be a black smithing for sure, but now I am not sure.<br/>
There might be good money there but the trad wont benifit me much. Also not<br/>
to mention I dont have very high strenth, but then agian what is there out<br/>
there that would be good for a necro? Or is my negitiveity of the black<br/>
smith trad missplaced. Pleas someone give me some tips. If you are a necro<br/>
and a black smith I would really love to hear how its going for you, or if<br/>
any of you are in another trad and its doing you good pleas tell me.</div>
