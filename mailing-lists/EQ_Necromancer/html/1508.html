<div id="ygrps-yiv-476871770">HI all, i have recently started my necro and am about to buy my lvl 16<br/>
spells I was wondering is infectious cloud worth buying? i know its area<br/>
effect and stops regen but what is the damage? I have read conflicting<br/>
reports, some saying it is only DD and some saying it is alos 100 dmg DOT,<br/>
can anyoen clarify which it is? Also where should i hunt at lvl 13 to get<br/>
to 16 fast - i will usually hunt wiht either a lvl 12 monk or druid as my<br/>
partner - i hear oasis is good is that right? FInally I hear i can buy my<br/>
lvl 16 pet spell in efreeport in some kind of cave, rather than research -<br/>
is that correct and if so where is this cave? - Thanks in advance, sorry<br/>
for all the questions, just loving my necro! - Malados on SOlusek Ro<br/>
