<div id="ygrps-yiv-172158610">I&#39;ve never been to this area, but I&#39;ve thought of this before non the<br/>
less.  I finally decided that by the time varent (or varant or whatever the<br/>
heck ever) gets around to putting one in, if they ever do for that matter, I<br/>
wont care one way or the other.  At least, not with my current charecter.<br/>
He&#39;ll already be whatever the level limit is at the time and have all of the<br/>
best stuff, etc. LoL So why bother?<br/>
<br/>
    If it&#39;s something very important, start a new charecter.  By then,<br/>
you&#39;ll likely be bored with your high level and want to anyway. :)  Seeing<br/>
their track record with quests and stuff, though, I don&#39;t think it&#39;d be<br/>
worth it.<br/>
