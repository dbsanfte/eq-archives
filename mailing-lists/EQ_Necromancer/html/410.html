&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have a wizard who is 14th and I just started a necro and am 2nd lvl. ..<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think Necromancer may be the way to go but I would like to hear your<br/>
&gt; opinions,  how is the high lvl Necro stuff going?  Can you hold your own???<br/>
&gt; I like my 14th lvl wizard and I think I might just use both classes but I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; like to hear input . . .<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I have not played either class past 6th level yet, so understand that<br/>
I&#39;m going by what I&#39;ve heard from higher level wizzes and necros. <br/>
First of all, necros are evil, and hated by most. Their compensation for<br/>
this is that they _are_ the best soloers. If soloing is important,<br/>
straight from 1 to 50, then necro is a great choice. <br/>
Second, wizzes _can_ solo. But it is hard... MUCH harder than the necro. A<br/>
wiz is usually limited to killing blue after blue solo, while the necro<br/>
can take on the occasional yellow without too much fear. Thus, the necro<br/>
will seem easier. What I&#39;ve heard though, is that the balance of power in<br/>
favor of the necro shrinks to some extent at each spell circle. At lvl 34<br/>
(way up there!) I&#39;ve heard that the wiz becomes just as efficient at<br/>
soloing as the necro. Not necessarily _more_ efficient, just _as_<br/>
efficient. Things get more unclear in this area just because there aren&#39;t<br/>
enough high level people to ask.<br/>
<br/>
   Now, one thing to consider (and this is the reason I favor the wiz)...<br/>
when playing a necro, half your power is your pet. With a pet thought, if<br/>
you zone/hide/go invis, you lose the pet. Not a big deal, but it _does_<br/>
take time to scrounge up bone chips (or money...). If you have time to<br/>
play for long stretches, this is of very little to no concern at all.<br/>
Personally, I have a wife and a baby due in the next week, so I need to be<br/>
able to go AFK at a moments notice to tend to both of them. This can get<br/>
annoying if everytime I stand up from the keyboard I either have to lose<br/>
my pet (to hide) or risk dying while I sit around in an unsafe area. Yeah,<br/>
this is a strange situation that not many share... and if it wasn&#39;t for<br/>
this reason alone I&#39;d _certainly_ play the necro. <br/>
  If you really enjoy soloing rather than constantly being grouped, this<br/>
is the only way to go :) The wiz path is MUCH more tedious and the rewards<br/>
come at lvl 24 and above rather than at lvl 1!<br/>
