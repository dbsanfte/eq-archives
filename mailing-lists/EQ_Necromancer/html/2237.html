<b>Subject:</b> Re: [EQ_Necromancer] Should pets be given weapons above level 20? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-531716600">This has been argued on may forums and if you will try it yourself you will <br/>
see that this is correct: Weapon Delay and Damage has absolutely no effect <br/>
whatsoever. Only thing that will count is if you get a Sword of runes from <br/>
a magician which will proc on anything in the hands of a pet. but dly/dmg <br/>
makes absolutely no difference at all. At the lowest levels a single weapon <br/>
in the hands of a pet will make him hit a bit harder but that is the only <br/>
benefit. Here is what I do. I gather rusty daggers when something drops <br/>
them or I go to East Freeport and enter Hallards Resales. You can buy rusty <br/>
daggers there very cheap and save the time of hunting for them. I usually <br/>
buy 2 backpacks full and put one in the vault for later.<br/>
