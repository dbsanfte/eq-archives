  The Kunark expansion supposedly has better 3d and 3d support.  Since the Riva chipsets are the market leader, let&#39;s hope Verant decides to support them.<br/>

    Yeah EQ doesn&#39;t support the NVIDIA chip sets like 3DFX . . .<br/>
     <br/>
    I was sadly dissapointed when my brand spanking new GeForce256 looked worse than my VOODOO2<br/>
     <br/>
    I emailed <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:support@...">support@...</a> and I will let you know what turns up.<br/>
     <br/>
    now outside of EQ the cards rocks!  I mean I did this 3D benchmark and it was about 3 times faster than my VOODOO2 .. .   really smokin&#39;<br/>
     <br/>
    I changed my CPU speeds and FSB too and there was a noteable increase in performance of the video card when the CPU overall Mhz and FSB was increased so if you have a newer system I&#39;d get one.  I think EQ will support it soon.  &lt;/e crosses his fingers&gt;<br/>

      really? From the previous threads, I was going to go<br/>
      online and buy one since I still use a banshee<br/>
      card....now this is making me do a double take.<br/>
<br/>
      Anymore input? Please?!?!<br/>

      &gt; I have a GeForece256 DDR and EQ has told me they<br/>
      &gt; don&#39;t offically support it, it isn&#39;t as good as my<br/>
      &gt; VOODOO2, my friend had the same experience.   GRRRR<br/>
      &gt; EQ makes me mad sometimes.<br/>
      &gt; Hopefully they will fix it.<br/>

      &gt;   have to agree with Tony B on that. had a tnt2<br/>
      &gt; ultra, and decided to try one<br/>
      &gt;   out. (didnt really think it would make that big a<br/>
      &gt; difference) There isnt<br/>
      &gt;   much difference in it, Untill you go above<br/>
      &gt; 1024X768, and then it really<br/>
      &gt;   starts to shine.  (about 20fps faster)<br/>

      &gt;   &gt; get an nvidia geforce 256 with ddr.  they are<br/>
      &gt; the best cards out now (high<br/>
      &gt;   &gt; res, works with everything).  also, nvidia has<br/>
      &gt; always had stable drivers.<br/>
