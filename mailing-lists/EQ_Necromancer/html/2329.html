&gt; Actually a corporate accountant might reply something like<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;Giving the game away as a demo has its merits in building<br/>
&gt; market share and enticing customers to regularly subscribe.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; However, given that most customers have already spent an<br/>
&gt; average of $1200 on a PC, and $40 a month on DSL, the additional<br/>
&gt;  investment of $20 is minimal.<br/>

understand markets or economics.<br/>

The reason the mere two hundred million Microsoft gave Apple saved the latter<br/>
company&#39;s butt is that even though Apple was worth billions, most of that was<br/>
tied up in existing projects and expectations, so that any windfall gave them<br/>
a dramatic boost.<br/>

An actual economist would point out that the marginal costs are often the<br/>
most important, when looking across a broad marketplace. When the Fed<br/>
increases one of several minor interest rate facors by a mere quarter point,<br/>
not a single family in the entire US says &quot;that&#39;s it...I heard the Fed raised<br/>
interest rates twenty five basis points, so I&#39;m not going to buy a house<br/>
because my interest costs may increase by a tenth of a percent per year&quot;. Yet<br/>
tens of thousands, or more, fewer houses will be purchased in the next<br/>
eighteen to thirty six months because of it.<br/>

&gt; Additionally, the equipment and personnel to support 10,000<br/>
&gt; customers a month downloading 600 MB of data is extremely<br/>
&gt; expensive. Since the downloads are not spread evenly over the<br/>
&gt; course of the day, extra equipment is needed that is idle<br/>
&gt; during non peak hours.&quot;<br/>

making hardcopies of the product. That is why Sony sold its most recent<br/>
expansion as a download, and only when demand was ridiculously high did they<br/>
consider even a very limited distribution of CDs.<br/>
