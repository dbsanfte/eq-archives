<div id="ygrps-yiv-999012006">As long as I am at it.  What is the benefit of attacking quicker?  It seem<br/>
to be important to everyone, but I don&#39;t understand why.  The combat system<br/>
seems to go by rounds, so having a faster weapon would not mean more hits.<br/>
The only benefit I can see is that your pet is more likely to do damage<br/>
before it dies rather than dying before it get to hit for that round.<br/>
Getting in one more hit doesn&#39;t seem like a good enough reason for everyone<br/>
to go through so much effort to give their pet a weapon with a small delay.<br/>
What am I missing?<br/>

Well, you should not give your pet say a rusty halberd, or some other slow<br/>
weapon after this as yes it will only slow him down.But I would DEFINITELY<br/>
advise you to give your pet a dagger of some kind (FS are best if you are<br/>
high enough lvl to be giving them to a pet).Why?Because, daggers will make<br/>
your pet attack quite a bit faster than with his bare fist and it does not<br/>
lower his damage.So it&#39;s hitting for the same amount of damage, but a good<br/>
deal quicker.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I thought that at 16th level and above you should not give your pet a<br/>
weapon<br/>
 because he did more damage barehanded.  Am I wrong about this? &gt;&gt;<br/>
