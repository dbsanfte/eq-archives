<div id="ygrps-yiv-1791232478">That guy should not be playing the necro class at all then.  Necros are<br/>
probably the best class in a duel if, next to enchanters(never duel high<br/>
level enchanters btw, they can get you killed with exp loss).<br/>
<br/>
When dueling other casting classes shadowstep isn&#39;t really necessary.  The<br/>
first and foremost spell you should try to get off is fear.  Once fear<br/>
sticks, the outcome of the battle is already yours.<br/>
<br/>
For melee classes shadowstep is a must.  Dot, shadowstep, dot, etc.  The<br/>
healing ones such as rangers and paladins are a bit harder.  So I like to<br/>
use fear on them while they try to heal.<br/>

&gt;Last night, I watched a level 26 necromancer with a<br/>
&gt;pet, get wiped off of the face of Norrath by a 24th<br/>
&gt;level ogre warrior. I have some strategies for necro<br/>
&gt;against caster, but how do you fight a warrior? The<br/>
&gt;necro could not get any of his spells of as the<br/>
&gt;warrior bashed/kicked/slashed him to death. The fight<br/>
&gt;took a while as the necro ran around without much<br/>
&gt;effect. End result, one dead necro, ogre at half<br/>
&gt;health. They only thing I could think of was sic pet,<br/>
&gt;shadow step, cast darkness, then proceed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I guess I have two questions:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What strategy do you all use for necro vs warrior<br/>
&gt;type?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What strategy do you all use for necro vs caster type?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am really curious to see what everyone says to this.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks!<br/>
