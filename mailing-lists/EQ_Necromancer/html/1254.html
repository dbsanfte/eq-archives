<div id="ygrps-yiv-211554195">Out of curiosity, Has anyone tried to stack DoT&#39;s then feign death.<br/>
Should that not do the extra damage since the monster would be withing<br/>
melee range for more then 18 seconds and not moving. <br/>
I was thinking something like DoT&#39;s feign death, wait, get up, shadow<br/>
step, DoT&#39; feign death, critter dead. <br/>
Now, does DoT make the critter see through feign death?? <br/>

Just trying to think of new strategies for using my spells from level<br/>
16. Besides, what else am I going to do at work. ;)<br/>
