<b>Subject:</b> RE: terrible terrible bug with pets :( (DOT bug not pet?) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-445758003">Well, unless the DoT bug has gotten worse I would not think that was the<br/>
culprit.  In my experience (which I admit isn&#39;t as great as many others) and<br/>
what I have heard from many others the DoT bug only occurs while grouped.<br/>
In addition, he said after the battle he could no longer control his pet...<br/>
it had been depetified  so I think this is a new problem (or at least one I<br/>
have never heard mentioned before)<br/>

It was probably not your pet...  but the Good old fashioned DOT bug.<br/>
<br/>
I think that more likely than it dying from your pet.<br/>
