 </span></blockquote>No... the Gods of fickle fate (OK, the designers with evil thoughts) put <br/>
griffins in the low level (5-15 level range) hunting area.  Sure... why NOT <br/>
put a 34th level monster in that mix!<br/>

Sonoroud.  Who vows revenge on griffins when he makes 35th or so...</div>
