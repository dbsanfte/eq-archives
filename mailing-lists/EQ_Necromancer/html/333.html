&gt; f course, we know Necro&#39;s don&#39;t get anything of the sort.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;     As for the problems that somebody asked for me to list, <br/>
&gt; most of them are<br/>
&gt; not Necromancer specific, but general spell-caster/other <br/>
&gt; limitations and/or<br/>
&gt; annoyances that, after some time, just really started to rub <br/>
&gt; me raw. =/<br/>
&gt; Take for instance, the MOBs apparently have no sense of UP, <br/>
&gt; but apparently<br/>
&gt; just horizontal line of sight.  Black Burrow is an excellent <br/>
&gt; example.  You<br/>
&gt; can stand up on top of the square block that the jaw is <br/>
&gt; attached to, or even<br/>
&gt; climb up the wall further -- which would make you a good 30ft <br/>
&gt; or more up --<br/>
&gt; and they can still hit you, from the ground, through the <br/>
&gt; not-so solid rock,<br/>
&gt; from _inside_ of the cave.  Ridicules.  Not to mention their <br/>
&gt; ability to run<br/>
&gt; through walls and doors.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>	That&#39;s area specific.  I especially love In SplitPaw slaw rooms with<br/>
the five shamans?  Stand in the middle of the paw and cast, they all get<br/>
pissed, but the pathfinding messes up and they have to run ALL THE WAY<br/>
AROUND THE PAW TABLE (which is large) in order to hit you.  What do you do?<br/>
Before they get there, move three feet to the right, THEN they have to RUN<br/>
ALL THE WAY BACK!  I&#39;ve bugged it but its probably one of those level design<br/>
things that plays hell with the pathfinding for the AI.  I also get<br/>
irritated at the griffins that can hit through walls and houses as well as<br/>
other things.  I do know that its up to the area.  Sometimes your skel will<br/>
run this massively laong route to get to you and end up bringing a train<br/>
with it.  Sometimes the nasty red creature will walk through lava and four<br/>
obstacles as well as a myriad of other characters to kill you.  There are<br/>
reasons for some of it, but nothing is perfect.  More on this later.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;     Another annoying thing that peeved me off was not being <br/>
&gt; able to attack<br/>
&gt; things in water.  Sure,  you can cast  your spells at them, <br/>
&gt; but it has no<br/>
&gt; effect at all.  If you tell your pet to attack the thing, he <br/>
&gt; says that it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; an illegal target.  You actually have to get _into_ the water <br/>
&gt; before you can<br/>
&gt; attack the thing.  Unless your channeling is 70-something, <br/>
&gt; you can&#39;t cast a<br/>
&gt; spell  until you sink to the bottom and stop moving, and by <br/>
&gt; then you&#39;re ate<br/>
&gt; up anyway.   This is an iffy example, though, as I realize <br/>
&gt; there&#39;s some<br/>
&gt; cases in which it could be &#39;taken advantage of&#39;, but it works for an<br/>
&gt; example.  But then, why not kill the shark before you hop <br/>
&gt; into the water?<br/>
&gt; What &quot;mage&quot; in their right mind would deliberately go feed <br/>
&gt; the fishies?<br/>
&gt; Heh..<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>	EQ treats underwater and over water as two different worlds.  Wanna<br/>
see underwater like you do in the day?  Slowly move out little by little<br/>
until the water &quot;top&quot; graphic gets thinner and thinner as you slowly sink<br/>
lower.  Boom, get it as small as possible and you can see underwater<br/>
perfectly.  You can&#39;t target anything still, and you can&#39;t affect anything<br/>
until you breach that line and everything goes dark again.  What you should<br/>
do is go underwater just barely enough, then run out.  You don&#39;t have to<br/>
fight underwater.  Go underwater, cast, then run out.  The monster WILL<br/>
follow you.  Again not sure of the reasoning for this, but everyone has this<br/>
problem not just us, and its not a big problem at all, just stay close to<br/>
shore.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;     Something else is their apparent psychic connection with <br/>
&gt; the planet.  I<br/>
&gt; mean, seriously, you&#39;re completely across the zone from the <br/>
&gt; thing and it<br/>
&gt; will still....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;             ...know where you&#39;re at, even if you&#39;re far under <br/>
&gt; ground and<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s top side _and_ all the way on the other side of the zone...<br/>
&gt;             ...make its way to you through maze or &#39;high water&#39;...<br/>
&gt;             ...and begin pounding the snot out of you...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;     Blah!  That seriously needs to be changed.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>	Why?  You know how easy it would be to abuse things?  Check out<br/>
Feign Death.  A lot of people complain about the monsters coming back to<br/>
kill you as soon as you get up even if they are half a zone away.  What<br/>
stops us from waiting for them to get a decent range away, cast another DoT,<br/>
then Feign Death again right there?  The point is in order to make it so<br/>
people can&#39;t use bad terrain or other things to cheat kills.  Hell people do<br/>
it now.  Check out Najena.  You see little cheater wizzies and clerics do it<br/>
all the time.  In Lavastorm there are those double doors to Najena.  Train a<br/>
monster up the left of the door wall then just barely fall into the door at<br/>
the top.  The monster will continue to try to go THROUGH the wall higher<br/>
than the door, which it can&#39;t.  Now you in the doorway can turn around and<br/>
cast spells at it all day, killing multiple ultra red elementals all the<br/>
time.  Everytime I see that I peition and take screenshots.  One person had<br/>
the balls to tell me it wasn&#39;t cheating but strategy.  The point is there<br/>
would be infinitely more ways to cheat if the monsters didn&#39;t have total<br/>
zone knowledge and a hatelist that doesn&#39;t go away till it dies or you zone.<br/>
You might argue that Verant didn&#39;t do a good job with the AI or something,<br/>
but seriously, it had to come out SOMETIME.  As a developer I understand a<br/>
bit more that you want to add everything but eventually you have to put out<br/>
SOMETHING.  And I&#39;d rather err on the less cheating side than the more<br/>
realistic side.<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;     We&#39;re spell-casters, not fighters.  It seems like varant <br/>
&gt; is doing their<br/>
&gt; best to stop us from being so.  It&#39;s not like we could make our selves<br/>
&gt; untouchable, as our spells have a certain range and if we can get &quot;up<br/>
&gt; there&quot;, so possibly can they.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>	There are several ways.  Use your pet as a shield, use others as<br/>
shields, don&#39;t go nuts with spellcasting, conserve!  I think the current way<br/>
is quite good and that spellcasters have a definite advantage over fighters,<br/>
especially in PvP.  I dueled an 18th level Shadowknight and won because all<br/>
I had to do was move forward and turn around, and move around a lot.  He<br/>
could only hit me when I was in front of him, and he spent a lot of time<br/>
reorienting on me.  Now that SUCKS.  It might have gone different had he<br/>
been in 3rd person view though.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;     Just a bunch of the stupid little things like that which <br/>
&gt; really, really<br/>
&gt; peeves me off &#39;bout the game.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;         There are Necro problems as well, though.  Varant <br/>
&gt; seems bent on<br/>
&gt; making Necromancers research their spells, to the distance of <br/>
&gt; not giving the<br/>
&gt; player any choice.  Sure, if you want to do that then the <br/>
&gt; option&#39;s cool,<br/>
&gt; but incredibly annoying to us folks who don&#39;t.  Most of our <br/>
&gt; 20-ish or better<br/>
&gt; spells are not only on NPC&#39;s on ridiculously out of the way <br/>
&gt; places (on an<br/>
&gt; island, from an island, which you have to swim out to), but <br/>
&gt; on NPC&#39;s that<br/>
&gt; kill us on sight.  Deliberately putting _our_ spells on incredibly<br/>
&gt; aggressive NPC&#39;s/magician vendors that are near impossible to <br/>
&gt; find.  That&#39;s<br/>
&gt; just plain stupid.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>	You think WE have problems?  We at least get our pets to the 34th<br/>
level I believe.  Mages have their 24th level pet in the middle of nowhere<br/>
and after that its straight research.  Believe me that every other<br/>
spellcaster class has the same if not worse problem that we do.  Besides,<br/>
its not as bad as you think.  The frequency of component drops was increased<br/>
by 300% and believe me I can see the difference.  I get Words of Tyranny and<br/>
words of Elemental all the tiem off green elementals in Lavastorm, and Runes<br/>
of lava crawlers.  Trading will be necessary but I don&#39;t think its all that<br/>
difficult as you make it out to be.  I&#39;m confident that it should work out<br/>
alright.  Might be annoying, but I don&#39;t see it getting impossible till<br/>
somewhere after level 34 when even our second book doesn&#39;t contain the<br/>
spells.<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;         Then there&#39;s the Necro guild in Neriak.  Why, oh why <br/>
&gt; do the ghouls<br/>
&gt; attack us?  Different deity?  Big deal, they&#39;re both evil <br/>
&gt; deities and I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t remember reading anywhere where they hated each other.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>	Yer lucky you even get that far.  I know just about everything isn&#39;t<br/>
allowed into Third Gate.  I&#39;ll bet that&#39;s a bug anyway but I think you HAVE<br/>
to server Innoruuk to get into The Lodge of the Dead.  Most guards are<br/>
agnostic so they don&#39;t have a problem, but all Dark Elf Necros HAVE to serve<br/>
Innoruuk, and if you aren&#39;t with us, you&#39;re against us.  Its that simple.  I<br/>
think you&#39;ll probably find yourself KOS in the lodge itself too, but you<br/>
never know.  Besides, Invis to Undead is like a 2nd Circle spell, you should<br/>
have this already.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
	Yer done.  In my opinion you have some valid arguements.  EQ is<br/>
definitely buggy and the complaints you had about buggy things were valid.<br/>
You have to look at it from a business perspective and a developer<br/>
perspective as well too though.  The more realistic you make a world and the<br/>
harder it gets to implement.  You HAVE to stop somewhere.  They are working<br/>
on a lot of these problems too.  I think the longer you stick around the<br/>
better it will get.  I already think they&#39;ve done ten times better than<br/>
Ultima Online did. ;)<br/>
