<div id="ygrps-yiv-1474683991">I am 32nd now and have most of my spells (I think the only one I&#39;m missing <br/>
is incorporeal for renew bones ..hint hint anyone on Tunare :) <br/>
  I have never failed at research and I believe my skill is at a 76 now.  Im <br/>
not maxed out,  I spent skill points on jewelcraft and others. <br/>
    For reseach I do 3 things.  One, have as a high intel as possible mine is <br/>
164 with my silver rune book.  2nd  Have as high wisdom as possible (in the <br/>
choice of wisdom or intel I go with wisdom), for thoose that don&#39;t know <br/>
wisdom is what makes you suceed even if your skill fails. I believe mine is <br/>
at 99 after i put on stat jewelry.  Last is someone else&#39;s hint, sorry dont <br/>
know where i got it, but it is to wait one lvl above the spell your attemping <br/>
to make .. I made the Vampiric curse (29th spell)  at 30 with a skill of 70 <br/>
and gained one point in skill.<br/>
<br/>
 Good luck all <br/>
Also I&#39;m sitting on an extra harmshield (20th) lvl spell it is for trade for <br/>
the incorporeal word on Tunare server (please dont ask for it I had 2 copies <br/>
of this and one was gift to a younger necro so this one will not be :)<br/>
