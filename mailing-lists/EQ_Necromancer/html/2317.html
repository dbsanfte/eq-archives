<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It does sound like it. In fact, almost exactly a year ago I downloaded the<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; turned out to be inferior, as far as I could tell, so I stayed. It sounds<br/>
&gt; like I should have tried DAoC instead, and might have switched.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have this interesting theory, and that is that turn based games like EQ<br/>
and DAoC work due to the very genre of the game. They are fantasy games and<br/>
as such the turn based style lends itself to a very good and smooth play<br/>
style. However, for something like AO (I was in the BETA on that as well as<br/>
many other games) and the new Star Wars Galaxies (SWG) the turn based system<br/>
SHOULD NEVER be used. Seriously, in my opinion its just not cool to see two<br/>
tough guys with big blasters and kick ass rifles standing toe-to-toe at<br/>
point blank range shooting at each other like a 18th Century soldiers firing<br/>
muskets. NOT COOL. (unless of course its a MMOG based on 18th Century<br/>
soldiers firing muskets. ;-P )<br/>
<br/>
For something like SWG you need to have some sort of first person shooter<br/>
perspective. I think the game that is going to get this right is another<br/>
game from Sony that some of you may or may not be aware of and that is<br/>
called &quot;Planetside&quot;. This looks to be a very COOL game and will be the game<br/>
I choose to play rather than SWG simply because it will take real skill to<br/>
shoot another player rather than a die roll.  As I said earlier, its my<br/>
opinion that turn based gun style combat simply does not work. For swords,<br/>
maces, bows and arrows and magic spells its a good system, but not for gun<br/>
combat.<br/>
<br/>
Thats basically what killed it for me with AO and I hope that SWG has a<br/>
better system if its not an FPS style.<br/>
<br/>
With regards to trying out DAoC instead...its possible you may have stayed,<br/>
but like many new games there are problems. Some were class glitches,<br/>
balancing issues, RvR problems and simply lack of content. Its kind of hard<br/>
to perform a relic raid when the relic is stuck to the floor and you can&#39;t<br/>
pick it up. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I also think you would have been disappointed at the lack of content and how<br/>
lame and small the original dungeons were when you compared them to the<br/>
pretty large, complex and vast dungeons in EQ.  I know I was, but I hung in<br/>
there and the new Shrouded Isles expansion has greatly improved the dungeon<br/>
situation.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But in the last year the /amount/ of change has been as breathtaking as<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; changes themselves, and other than a single bug which makes my machine<br/>
&gt; hesitate for several seconds every once in a while, sometimes getting me<br/>
&gt; killed (and all MMORPGs have occasional graphics bugs), I&#39;ve turned around<br/>
&gt; and grown really happy with EQ again. Sony seems to have made its<br/>
&gt; development, improvement, and stability a very high priority.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Its this kind of new attitude from Sony and the efforts that they have made<br/>
to make EQ even better that will probably drive me to play EQ2 when its<br/>
released. I am really looking forward to EQ2 as well as Planetside. If you<br/>
ask me, it looks like Sony will be the numero uno MMORPG game company out<br/>
there. And believe me, companies love nothing more than a continuous revenue<br/>
stream, especially from loyal and dedicated fans.<br/>
<br/>
I have taken advantage of Sonys 30day account reactivation for EQ.  I<br/>
installed Kunark and Velious. Thats all I own, and I must say the new<br/>
interface is very nice. However, after being away from EQ for over a year it<br/>
all felt pretty alien to me. Since I don&#39;t have Luclin, the graphics were<br/>
obviously VERY dated. I would have liked to have tried EQ with updated<br/>
graphics. They look pretty good from what I&#39;ve seen.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; On the other hand, I&#39;m curious enough that if there were a demo of DAoC,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; download it. But a quick perusal of the site doesn&#39;t reveal one, and I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; certainly not going to pay money for the game at a store &quot;just in case&quot; I<br/>
&gt; might like it more.<br/>
&gt; Do they not have a way to demo it free? Even EQ gave out free registration<br/>
&gt; keys to all existing accounts so that people could share/demo the game to<br/>
&gt; their friends...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think there is a demo of DAoC, which is quite unfortunate. The<br/>
classic DAoC sells in most stores for about $20 w/1month free access. So its<br/>
not too bad to check it out. If you happen to have a friend who had it that<br/>
would be the most ideal situation.<br/>
