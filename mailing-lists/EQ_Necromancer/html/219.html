<div id="ygrps-yiv-1655182225"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; If you give a pet a shield and it dies, does the shield disappear?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>   Yep...anything you give to a pet is lost when it dies. I&#39;ve heard that<br/>
if _you_ kill the pet though, you can reclaim the items. This was true in<br/>
beta, might not be true now.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Is it true that pets get a full share of experience, as if they&#39;re a party<br/>
&gt; member?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  If you are playing alone, yes, they will take a chunk of experience. If<br/>
you are in a group, the pet will only take experience if it makes the<br/>
killing blow. So just make sure you do a /pet back off before that point.<br/>
