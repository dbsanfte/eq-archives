<div id="ygrps-yiv-565728538">Hi Y&#39;all !<br/>
<br/>
Just thought  I&#39;d show you how I Solo with ST . =)<br/>
Try to raise your charisma to a decent level to get a better success<br/>
rate<br/>
and more consistant mez timing .<br/>
We all know that damage will break ST (once they fix the random stun bug<br/>
anyway)<br/>
But did u know that ST is still an amazing solo/kiting spell ?<br/>
Here&#39;s how u use it ...<br/>
<br/>
Imagine you are soloing the Bard Valen Nostrolo in South Karana at lvl<br/>
29.<br/>
He is a lvl 31 or 32 mob who has accelerado on so he runs pretty fast.<br/>
I always start fights with the allure of death/call of bones series on .<br/>
<br/>
1) Cast Screaming Terror  (Of coz!)<br/>
If it doesnt stick run for a few secs till u can recast ST ... If it<br/>
sticks ...<br/>
<br/>
2) Apply Darkness onto him .<br/>
You should have between 2-4 casts depending on your charisma<br/>
so darkness failing/resisting isnt a problem anymore , and we all<br/>
know how good the darkness success rates are dont we ? =)<br/>
<br/>
3) If Darkness Sticks on first or second try , Apply Boil Blood as well<br/>
.<br/>
you should have plenty of time to cast it if Darkness sticks 1st cast.<br/>
If darkness was resisted 4 or more times , cast Harmshield and head to<br/>
zone =)<br/>
or cast Feign Death and start praying .=/<br/>
you might not have enough mana at lvl 30 to take him down.<br/>
For those willing to put their balls on the line and have jboots/sow .<br/>
Put get to max distance and recast darkness .<br/>
<br/>
4) If you are using a pet , Apply Fear . If without pet Apply Vampiric<br/>
curse to get back some HP . Whatever the case , 3-5 Shock of Poison<br/>
normally settles it .<br/>
<br/>
5) Loot , Rinse , Repeat ad Infinitum .<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All of You probably know how its done already .<br/>
Most of u have been doing the exact same thing<br/>
without screaming terror for ages . Except that now<br/>
you have a chance at recasting darkness MANY<br/>
times . We know how crutial darkness is at soloing/kiting<br/>
and with the kind of success rates it has it just wont do.<br/>
Using screaming terror along with your normal tactics<br/>
really gives us more consistant kills .<br/>
<br/>
Since Mezmerize is Charisma based , You should use<br/>
items to buff your charisma to 85 or higher for better<br/>
success with ST . I swopped my weapon for a crude stein.<br/>
<br/>
Havent tried ST -&gt; Beguile Undead on Spectres yet .<br/>
If someone tries it please let us know . Not sure if<br/>
the Charm breaks ST yet .<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanx for reading this far !<br/>
This is just how &quot;I&quot; do it ...<br/>
No , &quot;YOU SUCK&quot; , &quot;DO IT MY WAY&quot; flames please .<br/>
I&#39;d love some criticism on how to improve the strategy<br/>
though so lets get this thread going . =)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
