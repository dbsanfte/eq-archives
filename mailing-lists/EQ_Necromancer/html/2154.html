<div id="ygrps-yiv-767235302">Goblin Headmaster is on the Oracle Island. The Oracle island is right off<br/>
the end of the dock on Sister&#39;s Island. Sister&#39;s island is the one stop the<br/>
boat makes FROM Freeport.<br/>
<br/>
Run around the edge of the island until you find a &quot;Y&quot; looking oblisk. The<br/>
Headmaster spawns between the Oblisk and a Goblin camp with a ten in it. He<br/>
spawns closer to the tent though.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  For the Harvester, I need a shadowed knife, which is from a goblin in OOT<br/>
&gt;  rather than a shadowed man.  Where in OOT can I find the goblin<br/>
&gt;  headmaster?  Is he soloable at 30?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The island across from gargoyles. He is a semi rare spawn.<br/>
<br/>
  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  Any thoughts on shadow men?  Do all the items drop randomly off all the<br/>
&gt;  shadow men, or are there better places than others to find the shadowed<br/>
&gt;  scythe and eye/hand/mask of shadow.  Are there any camps that are<br/>
&gt;  soloable or takable by a pair/trio, or will I need a full group?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Bring a druid and use Harmony. We got most everything we ever wanted from<br/>
the <br/>
WC camps for all our friends this way. We also did the SK ones a bit. The <br/>
clerics suck - I hate healers, the necros do like to use fear but arent too <br/>
bad. The tanks are wimps. A good druid can single pull that camp all day <br/>
long. A bad druid will get you killed. Shadowmen are faster than SoW if you <br/>
were not aware.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry cant help much on the 30 hunting grounds. My personal necro is 20 and <br/>
my main druid is 50 so I am not sure where to send you...<br/>
