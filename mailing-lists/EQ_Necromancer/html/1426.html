<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; shining gems and some enchanter quest stuff, but as you can see, very rare<br/>
&gt; for other nec stuff.  Does each zone spawn drop the items more frequently<br/>
&gt; like the camp in commons drop the componant for the robe and the ones in<br/>
&gt; innoth drop the componants for the gloves?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think I got lucky...my first kill dropped the mask for the robe...I havn&#39;t<br/>
