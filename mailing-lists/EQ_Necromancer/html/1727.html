<div id="ygrps-yiv-18174993">ok, here are some random issues-<br/>
<br/>
1. i was looking at the temple/ro quests.  where is a good place to pull <br/>
shadowed men from?  i know there are 5 in lavastorm, but ive been having <br/>
trouble getting enough ppl to take the camp (especially with sol calling to <br/>
them so nearby).  is there a single spawn anywhere?  im L25, btw, i believe <br/>
that is sufficient.<br/>
<br/>
2. guards- is there somewhere to pull guards?  being evil and all, i would <br/>
like to get some payback, but i got wasted looking around for something in <br/>
RV yesterday.  there were three guards that werent red, and one was green.  <br/>
the others were blue, but they were too close to the reds to attack- oh <br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
3. what lvls does one need to be to take on the temple quests?  i read an <br/>
old post for the harvester, mentioning the writer was L35 at the time.  is <br/>
25 high enough?<br/>
<br/>
thats it for now!<br/>
