<b>Subject:</b> shadowmen drops <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1192600144">How often do the shadowmen drop the nec items, besides the scythe?  I hunted<br/>
them for a few hours killing at least 50 in nek last night and got a few<br/>
scythe drops and the shadowmen item for the boots (only one though, luckily<br/>
the other nec i was with already had the boots).  They did drop quite a few<br/>
shining gems and some enchanter quest stuff, but as you can see, very rare<br/>
for other nec stuff.  Does each zone spawn drop the items more frequently<br/>
like the camp in commons drop the componant for the robe and the ones in<br/>
innoth drop the componants for the gloves?<br/>
<br/>
thanks</div>
