&gt; &gt; I can kill nearly all fire elementals in Lavastorm at level 13, most <br/>
&gt;near<br/>
&gt; &gt; the entrance /con blue to me... And they give quite a good amount of <br/>
&gt;exp.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Lava basilisks are good targets as well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I went back to lavastorm at level 22, and found a fire elemental that was<br/>
&gt;blue ;) that&#39;s why I said he should stay away from them.  There are some<br/>
&gt;that are *very* tough.  Plus the fact that their fire shields will more<br/>
&gt;often than not, kill your pet.  I figure if someone is confident enough in<br/>
&gt;their abilities, they will eventually try everything in a zone, I just like<br/>
&gt;to tell peeps what the easiest mobs are, and which ones can potentially<br/>
&gt;destroy you in an instant.<br/>
