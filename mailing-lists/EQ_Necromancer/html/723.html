<div id="ygrps-yiv-1752317618">Hello all...<br/>
<br/>
New to the necro world (lev 8), and I was wondering if I was missing something (this could be an old issue).  For all intents and purposes, a necro is &quot;grouped&quot; with his/her pet.  You fight together, tank for each other, and share experience.  But despite your mastery of the undead, you are not attuned to your pets current health.  Seems to me necro&#39;s should be able to view their pet&#39;s HP bar at all times, as they can with any other group member.  Obviously, this would help us decide when its time to absorb some punishment to save our pet.  Currently I have to back off and target my pet, which can be nearly impossible if fighting several skeletons (they all look alike, you know).<br/>
<br/>
So is this feature implemented and I havent found it yet, or shall we let the feedback begin.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the assistance.<br/>
