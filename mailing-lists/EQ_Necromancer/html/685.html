<b>Subject:</b> Where o&#39; where is Lesser Shielding spell??? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1796366439">I am looking for the location at which Lesser Shielding can be purchased? Im <br/>
a DE in Neriak, well now bound in the FP necro guild so not as many zones. I <br/>
just reached level 8 and am not completely happy with my spell selection. I <br/>
am hoping my new pet can take a bit more damage since I got tired of taking <br/>
most of the beating up to this level. I use the /assist hotkey when I send a <br/>
pet into battle so I can easily swap back and forth from the mob to my pet <br/>
to see when I need to jump in.<br/>
<br/>
I really really just need to know where/how I can get lesser shielding since <br/>
I was looking forward to it. One person said its in the necro guild, well I <br/>
looked, another said its in the wiz guild, I looked there, heck I looked in <br/>
every guild in Neriak and nothing. Another person told me I needed a Paladin <br/>
to get it for me, but if spells are lore items you cant trade them. Grr, I <br/>
am just hoping someone can/will tell me where to get this and end my misery! <br/>
