&gt;<br/>
&gt;My main question about Mistmoore deals with faction.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have heard and this has been confirmed by friends that when you kill MOBs<br/>
&gt;in Mistmoore you lose faction with the same Queen that I gain faction with<br/>
&gt;when I complete the Teir&#39;Dal Necro Quests.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This would seem to indicate that fighting in Mistmoore would be a BAD thing<br/>
&gt;for a Tier&#39;Dal Necromancer to do; however, I see some of the pet component<br/>
&gt;quests require items from Mistmoore.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So should I fight in Mistmoore?  Some of my friends want me to go there but<br/>
&gt;so far I have declined because of this faction loss.  This is for both<br/>
&gt;role-playing reasons (I want to be a loyal subject of my Queen) and I also<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t want to screw up my faction for quests that Verant may implement in<br/>
&gt;the future.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyway, any information is appreciated.<br/>
