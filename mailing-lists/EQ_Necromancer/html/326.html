<div id="ygrps-yiv-1704821410">Just curious, what does it take to summon a pet that makes them expensive at<br/>
higher levels? Guess you need more than just bone chips, eh? I -knew- it was<br/>
too good to last!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Its not cost effective at higher levels.  Later on your pets<br/>
&gt; start costing a<br/>
&gt; BUNCH and why run real far away and re summon when you can cast DoT spells<br/>
&gt; right there and heal your pet at maximum range?  Abandoning your<br/>
&gt; pet is only<br/>
&gt; useful if you are running, otherwise its just better to stick around and </span></blockquote></div>
