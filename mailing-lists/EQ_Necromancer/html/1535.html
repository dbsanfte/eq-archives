<div id="ygrps-yiv-56594975">I have a level 50 wizard. I can&#39;t remember for sure, but I think I have<br/>
766 hit points unbuffed.  Nagafen&#39;s AoE can kill me in one or two<br/>
rounds... :P<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Have never been on a dragon raid, so I don&#39;t know the actualy AOE of the <br/>
&gt; spell, but I would think the AOE damage spell they cast would eat the necros <br/>
&gt; up and if not well the fear running you around would.. Plus 1 summon and <br/>
&gt; byebye necro and pet... I could be wrong, but I really don&#39;t think it would <br/>
&gt; work.. Hope to go on a dragon raid soon and find out for myself exactly what <br/>
&gt; the dragons are like. </span></blockquote></div>
