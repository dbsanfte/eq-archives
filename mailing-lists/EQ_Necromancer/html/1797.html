<div id="ygrps-yiv-70110292">Jeeeeez.  Now I understand why everyone&#39;s pissed off (I am now in that<br/>
number, myself).<br/>
<br/>
Ok, so if the pet doesn&#39;t benefit from a reduced delay weapon.......is he<br/>
HARMED by an INCREASED delay weapon?  In other words, if I give him<br/>
something with a delay over 30, will it slow him down?<br/>
<br/>
If the answer to this question is yes, I&#39;ll be even more pissed.....<br/>

&gt; In the past:<br/>
&gt; You would want to give your pet anything under a 30 attack delay. Anything<br/>
&gt; slower than that would actually slow your pet down, where as FS<br/>
&gt; Dagger with<br/>
&gt; a delay of 19 would make your pet hit more often. As a side note, your pet<br/>
&gt; would hit for maximum damage of what he is capable of, no matter what the<br/>
&gt; damage rating of the weapon was.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now:<br/>
&gt; Neither delay nor damage does anything beneficial, but you need<br/>
&gt; to give your<br/>
&gt; pet 2 weapons of ANY kind so he will get the correct double attacks.<br/>
