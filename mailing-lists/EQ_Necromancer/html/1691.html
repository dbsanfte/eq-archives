<div id="ygrps-yiv-936467">I agree the managers of Verant love to confuse and confound.  But I don&#39;t <br/>
know if it is by design.  Maybe even they don&#39;t know how the XP <br/>
works.  Anyone one of us who have been exposed to large enterprise software <br/>
can tell you that it can take a life of its own in a very short time.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t believe anything they say about the game.  I go by direct experience.<br/>
<br/>
And of course the ultimate XP will be better when grouping.  But doesn&#39;t <br/>
this take one big FAT assumption - that there will be plenty of mobs to <br/>
fight with all that additional time you gain by grouping?<br/>
<br/>
Imagine fighting Vhalen at the well in SK - solo is the only way to <br/>
go.  You will sit on your butt six minutes between spawns no matter what <br/>
you do.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Quote from Gordon or Brad, &quot;You get 100xp from a mob,<br/>
&gt; &gt; it&#39;s up to you to enhance your exp.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I love these guys.  Anything they can do to obfuscate a topic and retain<br/>
&gt;the &quot;mystery of the game&quot; they&#39;ll gladly undertake.  How does one<br/>
&gt;&quot;enhance&quot; 100xp?  Does the 1% number they&#39;ve given for pet xp in a group<br/>
&gt;mean 1% of each fight or 2% of the time the pet will do enough damage to<br/>
&gt;take half?  Does it matter if my pet is 3 levels lower than me?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; (Shevil: Pet takes much more exp when soloing &#39;Unless&#39;<br/>
&gt; &gt; the caster gets the killing blow when solo.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This is clearly not correct.  The killing blow is irrelevant.<br/>

&gt;[snip Gordon&#39;s example of warriors splitting damage and reducing downtime]<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Yup.  It&#39;s definitely clear that you should be in a larger group if it<br/>
&gt;will speed up your hunting or if you&#39;ll take bigger foes. Grouping is good<br/>
&gt;for xp.  That&#39;s not news.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; 1:<br/>
&gt; &gt; Pet attacks Travis.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I use very few spells to kill Travis.<br/>
&gt; &gt; He does not cause any or much damage to me.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Killing blow by me or pet.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Equals: Little to no exp registered.<br/>
&gt; &gt; 2:<br/>
&gt; &gt; Pet attacks Travis.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I use many spells to kill Travis.<br/>
&gt; &gt; He causes 50% or more damage to me.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Killing blow by the pet.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Equals: Ok exp 1/16th to 1/8th of a bub.<br/>
&gt; &gt; 3:<br/>
&gt; &gt; Pet attacks Travis<br/>
&gt; &gt; I use many spells to kill Travis.<br/>
&gt; &gt; He causes 50% or more damage to me.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Killing blow by me.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Equals: 1/4th to 1/3 a bub of EXP.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Interesting.  The difference between 1 and 2 can be explained by whether<br/>
&gt;your pet does over half the damage.  The difference between 2 and 3 is<br/>
&gt;either the killing blow or the damage taken (or something we haven&#39;t<br/>
&gt;considered yet).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m definitely going to have to do some experiments and see if I can<br/>
&gt;confirm or disprove the &quot;taking damage increases exp&quot; theory.  Others,<br/>
&gt;please do the same.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks for posting your experiences.  I hope eventually we&#39;ll actually<br/>
&gt;know how the XP system works.<br/>

The demon is a liar. He will lie to confuse us. But he will also mix lies <br/>
with the truth to attack us. The attack is psychological, but powerful. So <br/>
don&#39;t listen, remember that, do not listen.<br/>
