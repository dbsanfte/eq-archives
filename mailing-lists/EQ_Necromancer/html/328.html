<div id="ygrps-yiv-1468595141">I suppose so, but I don&#39;t powergame, I just plan everything ahead.<br/>
Think of my character as one who spends 99.9% of his time in thought or<br/>
exploring, and the rest fighting and still prefers to think out the fights<br/>
he&#39;s in, rather than going at it.  If I could, I&#39;d knock a creature off of a<br/>
cliff with a lightening bolt, instead of fighting it out.  That&#39;s just an<br/>
example, of course, we know Necro&#39;s don&#39;t get anything of the sort.<br/>
<br/>
    As for the problems that somebody asked for me to list, most of them are<br/>
not Necromancer specific, but general spell-caster/other limitations and/or<br/>
annoyances that, after some time, just really started to rub me raw. =/<br/>
Take for instance, the MOBs apparently have no sense of UP, but apparently<br/>
just horizontal line of sight.  Black Burrow is an excellent example.  You<br/>
can stand up on top of the square block that the jaw is attached to, or even<br/>
climb up the wall further -- which would make you a good 30ft or more up --<br/>
and they can still hit you, from the ground, through the not-so solid rock,<br/>
from _inside_ of the cave.  Ridicules.  Not to mention their ability to run<br/>
through walls and doors.<br/>
<br/>
    Another annoying thing that peeved me off was not being able to attack<br/>
things in water.  Sure,  you can cast  your spells at them, but it has no<br/>
effect at all.  If you tell your pet to attack the thing, he says that it&#39;s<br/>
an illegal target.  You actually have to get _into_ the water before you can<br/>
attack the thing.  Unless your channeling is 70-something, you can&#39;t cast a<br/>
spell  until you sink to the bottom and stop moving, and by then you&#39;re ate<br/>
up anyway.   This is an iffy example, though, as I realize there&#39;s some<br/>
cases in which it could be &#39;taken advantage of&#39;, but it works for an<br/>
example.  But then, why not kill the shark before you hop into the water?<br/>
What &quot;mage&quot; in their right mind would deliberately go feed the fishies?<br/>
Heh..<br/>
<br/>
    Something else is their apparent psychic connection with the planet.  I<br/>
mean, seriously, you&#39;re completely across the zone from the thing and it<br/>
will still....<br/>
<br/>
            ...know where you&#39;re at, even if you&#39;re far under ground and<br/>
it&#39;s top side _and_ all the way on the other side of the zone...<br/>
            ...make its way to you through maze or &#39;high water&#39;...<br/>
            ...and begin pounding the snot out of you...<br/>
<br/>
    Blah!  That seriously needs to be changed.<br/>
<br/>
    We&#39;re spell-casters, not fighters.  It seems like varant is doing their<br/>
best to stop us from being so.  It&#39;s not like we could make our selves<br/>
untouchable, as our spells have a certain range and if we can get &quot;up<br/>
there&quot;, so possibly can they.<br/>
<br/>
    Just a bunch of the stupid little things like that which really, really<br/>
peeves me off &#39;bout the game.<br/>
<br/>
        There are Necro problems as well, though.  Varant seems bent on<br/>
making Necromancers research their spells, to the distance of not giving the<br/>
player any choice.  Sure, if you want to do that then the option&#39;s cool,<br/>
but incredibly annoying to us folks who don&#39;t.  Most of our 20-ish or better<br/>
spells are not only on NPC&#39;s on ridiculously out of the way places (on an<br/>
island, from an island, which you have to swim out to), but on NPC&#39;s that<br/>
kill us on sight.  Deliberately putting _our_ spells on incredibly<br/>
aggressive NPC&#39;s/magician vendors that are near impossible to find.  That&#39;s<br/>
just plain stupid.<br/>
<br/>
        Then there&#39;s the Necro guild in Neriak.  Why, oh why do the ghouls<br/>
attack us?  Different deity?  Big deal, they&#39;re both evil deities and I<br/>
don&#39;t remember reading anywhere where they hated each other.<br/>
<br/>
    Well it was asked, there&#39;s a few.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;    Ahh, but here&#39;s the thing: this is exactly what they were trying to<br/>
&gt; _avoid_. They don&#39;t want people out there crunching numbers and playing<br/>
&gt; from a pure power-gaming aspect. Otherwise, why not just reveal to us<br/>
&gt; every formula in the game? The lack of numbers is to promote a sense of<br/>
&gt; mystery and to encourage roleplaying...not roll-playing. It doesn&#39;t always<br/>
&gt; work (formulas are still found, &#39;optimal&#39; race/class/spell combinations<br/>
&gt; are still discovered), but it helps.<br/>
