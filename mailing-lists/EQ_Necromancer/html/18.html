    The one I&#39;m a bit peeved about is the Drosco quest the guy in the Qeynos<br/>
(actually the Aquaducts) guild area tells you about.  You can go in the<br/>
conversation up until he says &quot;[compromise the shrines location].&quot;  You can<br/>
not get the SOB to respond to that phrase no matter how you word it.  If you<br/>
can prove me wrong, please do so.  I finally got Drosco, darn near died<br/>
(left over poisen, what a pain), and then had to sweat my way into the<br/>
Temple of Thunder to do anything.<br/>
<br/>
    What do you do with the Sealed Letter, any of you know?<br/>

          has anyone heard anything about patching the broken spells? Also<br/>
the quest where your supposed to get Trumpys Irontoes head is broke, I spent<br/>
2 hrs on this quest today, finally killed the dwarf and gated before the<br/>
guards got me just to give the head[actually it was meat] to the guildmaster<br/>
for him to say &quot;ah your giving me dwarf meat, Thank you&quot;, well needless to<br/>
say at that point I was about to loose my mind, So I called a GM and told<br/>
him about the Spells [Vamp Embrace and Sum Shadows] just for him to say that<br/>
he will report it and hopefully it will be addressed in a upcoming<br/>
patch.......so in a nut shell were SOL! personally I think we should start<br/>
making alot of noise about this, it seems to 989 that making the sun set and<br/>
the moon rise is more important than getting our class&#39;s spells fixed! also<br/>
If you would like the screen shots of the talk I had with this GM I would be<br/>
happy to send them to you.....<br/>
<br/>
  P.S. Im sure Im gonna get back some feed back from other class&#39;s in the<br/>
game, all I can say is for you to try to take on 10+ level monsters with a<br/>
4th level damage spell and tell me how long you last when you have 3 of them<br/>
on you...<br/>
