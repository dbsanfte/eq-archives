<div id="ygrps-yiv-1747045945">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone else feel that the fact that there is no hot-key for selecting<br/>
your pet is just VERY annoying?<br/>
On numerous times, especially when fighting big critters, i found myself<br/>
clicking in frenzy on my pet, wishing that i would catch<br/>
the pixel that belongs to him, and then switching back to the critter etc<br/>
etc etc.<br/>
Has someone found any efficient way for selecting your pet while in combat?<br/>
Why not have those hot-keys that select the nearest npcs point to your pet<br/>
first? i think we should demand this from verant, as i find it to be highly<br/>
annoying.<br/>
<br/>
death to all,<br/>

If we aren&#39;t supposed to eat animals , why are they made of meat?</div>
