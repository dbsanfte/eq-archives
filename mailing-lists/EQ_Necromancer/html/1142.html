<div id="ygrps-yiv-1275199421">Actually I have steins for both my characters. I had two other friends an<br/>
enchanter and a ranger start collecting material at the beginning of last<br/>
week. We proceeded to do the quest several times and sold 13 steins before<br/>
we were done. By Friday of last week you couldn&#39;t give a stein away. Just<br/>
glad we got in on the ground floor. We have things we wouldn&#39;t expect to see<br/>
for another 10 or 15 levels.<br/>
<br/>
I know it may be an exploit and that some people may feel we cheapened the<br/>
quest but, trading is a part of the game and the only way to trade up is to<br/>
have something a higher level character wants and doesn&#39;t know how or where<br/>
to get it.  Of course after the quest was posted that all changed, the<br/>
beauty of the internet.<br/>
<br/>
People do say at higher levels a weapon will no longer be needed and you<br/>
rely on your spells and mana.  I however it will make me feel better knowing<br/>
I have a weapon with me that one time I really need it.<br/>

Heh I hope you can get another glowing stein because I&#39;m currently Level 34<br/>
and I don&#39;t even carry a weapon anymore except for my Stilleto of the<br/>
BloodClaw which I&#39;m currently trying to sell. That intell from the stein is<br/>
so important, the staff while good is not very useful since you never melee<br/>
anymore it just doesn&#39;t happen. Anyway thought I&#39;d throw in my 2 cents.<br/>
