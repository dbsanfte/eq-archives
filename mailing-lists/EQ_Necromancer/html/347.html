<div id="ygrps-yiv-651070628">This is odd, as I actually remember being told that Druids were one of<br/>
the most worthless classes and were only good for traveling.  *grin*<br/>
<br/>
            I have no idea.  I do know they get some pretty nifty illusion<br/>
spells.  I&#39;ve see one as a (very big) tree, and one as a wolf.  If anything<br/>
else, that&#39;s pretty darn cool.<br/>
<br/>
            &#39;Course, if we ever make it up there, we get to turn into a<br/>
skeleton.  Gee, I bet the guards _really_ love us then. :-)  Actually, I<br/>
wont be surprised to see my Charisma drop down to 1 upon casting that spell,<br/>
but boy am I going to have fun drompting about the world in the form of a<br/>
skeleton.<br/>
<br/>
        That brings something else up, too.  Does anybody know if we _ever_<br/>
get to summon anything besides a  plain&#39;ol boring looking yellow skeleton?<br/>
I mean, they have skins for Zombies, Ghouls, and differant sized skeletons<br/>
that I&#39;ve seen thus far, and I&#39;ve seen more than one skin for a Zombie.  Why<br/>
couldn&#39;t they make the Necromancer spells summon a differant undead?  Sure,<br/>
maybe not a Ghoul -- at least not until almost or at level 50 -- but<br/>
something else other than a skel, please!  :-)<br/>
<br/>
        Maybe if we used differant spell components.  After all, the<br/>
elemental pets for the Magi all look differant, and all have their own<br/>
reagents.  Then again, each has its own spell, too.  *big sigh*<br/>
<br/>
        I dunno.  Maybe in some future update. :-)<br/>

        P.S.  The Necro in the Qeynos guild _does_ say that he turned Drosco<br/>
into a zombie to roam the sewers...... who knows, maybe at a higher level,<br/>
or one we research....or maybe not.<br/>

&gt; What exactly is it with Druids?  I never really see anything but the<br/>
&gt; receiving end, so I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s the big deal.  Are their spells<br/>
&gt; overpowered?  Do they have awesome abilities?  What exactly is up with<br/>
