<div id="ygrps-yiv-1589809924">Well personally I&#39;d stay in Nro doing dervs paticular camp 3 since more<br/>
thugs spawn there until 16. Once you hit 16 head for Lake R and do Aviaks.<br/>

&gt;Hi, I am a level 15 DE Necro and I was wondering if anyone had any<br/>
&gt;suggestions as to where I could hunt?I am currently doing Dervs in NRo, but<br/>
&gt;even if I have the entire Dorn camp to myself, the experience isn&#39;t that<br/>
&gt;good(great loot though) cause they all con blue or green.I was wondering if<br/>
&gt;anyone could recommend anywhere else to hunt?Also, could anyone recommend<br/>
&gt;anywhere to hunt at lvl 16 as well?It&#39;ll soon come and I would like to<br/>
&gt;already have an idea of where I want to go-besides crocs and camains(sp) in<br/>
&gt;Oasis.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks in advance!<br/>
