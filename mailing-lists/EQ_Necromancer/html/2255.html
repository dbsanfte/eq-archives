<br>If your on a new server then do aviaks... Fastest way i know is in lake rathe <br>the two aviak spawn right by arena.... I never died there and I was the <br>second level 50 necro and the first one was my hunting partner and we hunted <br>all the same shit...Aviaks are only really good fro necros if you got the <br>spawn alone though. &nbsp;SO it works good on a new server.
