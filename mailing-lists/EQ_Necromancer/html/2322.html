<div id="ygrps-yiv-992865463">RvR = Realm vs Realm. Generally synonymous to PvP.<br/>
<br/>
For most servers in DAoC, the world is split into<br/>
3 kingdoms or realms: Hibernia, Albion and Midgard.<br/>
Player vs player combat is 99.9% limited to combat<br/>
between the realms. For example, Hibs cannot attack<br/>
other Hibs or Hib npcs or guards, and likewise for<br/>
Albion and Midgard. If you want to fight other players,<br/>
you go to the frontier zones and fight against the<br/>
other realms. Hence, Realm vs Realm.<br/>
<br/>
Recently a duel feature was implemented, but you gain<br/>
no xp or cash for winning a duel and lose nothing for<br/>
dying in a duel. (If a Mob kills you when you are wounded<br/>
from a duel, that does count as a real death.) So far,<br/>
I&#39;ve only seen duels done between friends for fun.<br/>
<br/>
There are two PvP servers in DAoC - Mordred and Andred.<br/>
I skimmed the PvP rules once and they seemed pretty brutal,<br/>
but I&#39;ve never played or talked to someone who has played<br/>
on the PvP servers.<br/>

What, by the way, does RvR mean?</div>
