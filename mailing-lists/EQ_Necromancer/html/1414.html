<div id="ygrps-yiv-456210678">Ok, let&#39;s see...<br/>
Yes, you are KOS to all the other guards on Faydwer, other than gnomes. That includes the <br/>
Felwithe (actually, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever been to the wood elves with my gnome necro, but <br/>
I&#39;m sure they are KOS too...) and the dwarves. Across the water, things are a bit better. You <br/>
are fine wandering around Freeport, Qeynos and Neriak. Oggok and Grobb are off limits. <br/>
The guards in both places will mop the floor with you on sight. Rivervale is also not an option. <br/>
You are also KOS in Highpass Hold, BTW. Gather Shadows isn&#39;t  must before travelling to <br/>
Freeport, but you must sneak around the guards at the docks by going around the wall and <br/>
swimming into the dock area. There used to be a dwarf guard swimming around in there, but <br/>
haven&#39;t seen him lately. Luck.<br/>

&gt; Just started a Necromancer, now L4.  Will likely hit L8 this week and be<br/>
&gt; ready (with Gather Shadows) to travel a bit if I don&#39;t choose to wander<br/>
&gt; sooner, and perhaps hook up with some Troll friends.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So - What cities am I likely to be tolerated well enough to be able to get<br/>
&gt; to the bank and vendors?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I know Ak&#39;Anon is fine.  Nobody outside the Mines of Malfunction likes me,<br/>
&gt; but neither do they hate me.  I&#39;ve been told that it&#39;s instant death to<br/>
&gt; get anywhere near the dwarf guards in Butcherblock, so Kaladim is out.  I<br/>
&gt; presume Kelethin and Felwithe are likewise verboten - can anyone confirm?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On Antonica, I know I can get out of the docks in the tunnel that has the<br/>
&gt; Necro guild, and presumably sell there as well.  Can I get to the bank in<br/>
&gt; N Freeport?  Innothule is likely my first destination - can I go into<br/>
&gt; Grobb or Oggok to get bound or is E Freeport the closest place?  Will the<br/>
&gt; DE vendors in S Ro or any of the vendors in Innothule, Feerott, or Rathe<br/>
&gt; Mountains talk to me?  How about the rest of the continent?  Can I walk<br/>
&gt; into Neriak?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Your thoughts, please.  I tried searching the archives with no luck; If<br/>
&gt; this is a FAQ, please feel free to reply directly instead of to the list,<br/>
&gt; or just point to a site with the information.  I&#39;ve looked at all the<br/>
&gt; sites linked from <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://everquest.gamestats.com/Classes.htm">http://everquest.gamestats.com/Classes.htm</a> but didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; see any specific data listed.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks much! <br/>
