<div id="ygrps-yiv-1327455949">Well first off I definitly wouldn&#39;t even attempting her until level 47+.<br/>
Second don&#39;t attempt her if you don&#39;t have 44 pet plain and simple you will<br/>
lose to her. I&#39;ve fought her and the main problem with her is the fear spell<br/>
she casts your pet needs to be 44 so hopefully while you running around<br/>
thespectre cave he will last until youget back. It&#39;s good exp but it&#39;s not<br/>
something you can tell somebody how to do if you can&#39;t figure it out<br/>
chanches are you&#39;ll die if somebody else tells you.<br/>

&gt;Hmm, I an going to have to go check this one out, playing on the PvP server<br/>
&gt;I might get rocked every time someone comes through to go into Fear. Ask<br/>
&gt;your friend what he does about all of the pets and other crap that hangs<br/>

&gt;&gt;BTW I am only 41, but my wiz friend went from 45-50 killing Cynderella in<br/>
&gt;&gt;the Spec cave. Supposedly good xp<br/>
