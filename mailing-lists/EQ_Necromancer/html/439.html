<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-19094271">Basically its like a tentacle whip.  Whenever you hit there is a slim chance<br/>
that you will automatically LifeDrain the victim.  This happens whether you<br/>
are equipped with a weapon or not.  In reality this is obviously more useful<br/>
to the shadowknights as they attack a LOT more than Necromancers (and<br/>
believe me, if you are fighting monsters solo above level 16 with yourself<br/>
as a primary fighter, you are thinking the WRONG way).  Its results are<br/>
variable but I suggest attacking with a dagger to maximize the number of<br/>
times you attack (ie get more chances to use Vamp Embrace).<br/>
<br/>
Basically I don&#39;t really use this at all.  At my level getting in there in<br/>
melee is rare (except to save my skel so it can get more hits in, I seem to<br/>
do that a LOT nowadays) and usually quite fatal.  Think your pet will save<br/>
you?  Obviously you haven&#39;t tried fighting the smarter NPCs.  Head to Lake<br/>
Rathetear and fight some Aviak Guards if you don&#39;t believe me.  I cast like<br/>
once and they frenzy on me, and that&#39;s after I&#39;ve let one beat on my pet<br/>
till its half dead.  Then its time to jump into the water and use my<br/>
superior swimming skills (in the 90s woohoo!) to get away.<br/>
<br/>
Also if you group with a Bard a lot I highly suggest using Dark Pact or<br/>
Allure of Death, its QUITE nice.  Good bards can keep up with AoD&#39;s HP loss<br/>
rather easily and the mana regen is EXCELLENT.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hello all,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am a proud level 10 Gnome Necro in Freeport and I have a <br/>
&gt; question about<br/>
&gt; one spell. Does anyone know how to correctly use the Vampiric <br/>
&gt; Embrace spell?<br/>
&gt; I mean I thought it was like lifetap or lifespike (where you <br/>
&gt; target your<br/>
&gt; opponent and you steal his HP) but with this spell when I <br/>
&gt; target a monster,<br/>
&gt; I see I hand icon appear on my display and nothing else <br/>
&gt; happens. Now I have<br/>
&gt; tried to attack a creature and sometimes when the thing dies <br/>
&gt; I get some HP&#39;s<br/>
&gt; back but not all the time....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Do I have to be bare handed for it to work or is there <br/>
&gt; something I am doing<br/>
&gt; wrong?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Any help with this spell would be appreciated.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; thanks in advance.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
