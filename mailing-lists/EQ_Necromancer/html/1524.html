<div id="ygrps-yiv-1577052632">The resists on life taps do stink, but I think they were coming no matter<br/>
what. I was 45 level on a dragon hunt this week and was completely able to<br/>
cast on Vox with life taps. I never tried any other spells because others<br/>
were using more powerful versions. A necromancer will always be helpful on<br/>
Dragon runs because we have pets, plain and simple.<br/>
