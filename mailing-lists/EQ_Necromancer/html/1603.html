<div id="ygrps-yiv-784069882">&lt;&lt; Where do you get the warbone chips from? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Warbone chips come off skels in Unrest I belive off knight and barbed <br/>
bones.  They sell for 3 gold (so let everyone give them to you in unrest) <br/>
just smile say thank you.<br/>
   The bones will do NOTHING for your pets , they are a shaman alchemy <br/>
componets.<br/>
  I have tested this back when I was a youngin like this :  Drop all your <br/>
bones in bank, put warbone in inventory, cast pet,  nothing but a message, <br/>
you dont have bone chips.<br/>
  It nice thought to collect them and people feel in unrest they must give us <br/>
all bones.<br/>
I had 2 backpacks full of bones after a marathon basement camp (30-35  this <br/>
place rocks in a group you own basement) so many bones i was destroying them <br/>
by the 20&#39;s.  No other necro in Unrest and I didnt have the heart to tell <br/>
party to stop giving me bones. <br/>
