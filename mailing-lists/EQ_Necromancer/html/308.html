<div id="ygrps-yiv-2050600954">Wait, what problems?  The only thing I&#39;m kind of getting irritated<br/>
at is that we can&#39;t use DoT spells in duels or PvP yet, essentially<br/>
castrating the powerful Necromancer class.  I can still take an Enchanter of<br/>
equal level 80% of the time (I love Shield and its bonus to magic<br/>
resistance).<br/>
	Other than that I believe its a powerful class.  I thought it was<br/>
annoying that your pet was a variable level pet, but you&#39;ll see as you level<br/>
that this doesn&#39;t make as big a deal as you think.  In the early levels yes<br/>
because the hitpoints are so key (level 1 skel has like 10hp, level 2 would<br/>
have 20-30, which adds its effectiveness a LOT), but later a couple levels<br/>
difference isn&#39;t as BIG a difference.  I&#39;m 16th now and I never get a yellow<br/>
pet.  I think Restless Bones (16th level summoning) summons a level 13-16<br/>
pet, because I can&#39;t get green (yet) ones.  I don&#39;t see any other glaring<br/>
problems with it (aside from an annoying frequency that Heart Flutter gets<br/>
resisted by blue dangerous monsters, but then I know Enchanters and Wizards<br/>
have it worse so I don&#39;t have a problem with that).<br/>
<br/>
	I can kill white and yellow monsters that most people wouldn&#39;t DREAM<br/>
of attacking, or I can swing my way through a field of blues.  I also love<br/>
Feign Death, and you will too.  Very fast casting time and almost always<br/>
successful.  When things look dim always remember to keep 60 mana (again,<br/>
you don&#39;t need to know your exact mana, and if you are hardcore you can<br/>
calculate it with the mana calculator and divide it by five to see how much<br/>
mana you have per bubble.  Do this once per level and keep the numbers in a<br/>
useful place and you&#39;re pretty much covered your mana count rather well.)<br/>
and then switch to 3rd person and wait for the pissed off monsters to get<br/>
far enough away for you to Gate or get a good start for the zone.<br/>
<br/>
	So if you can make a list of things that you are pissed off about<br/>
the Necromancer, I think we can discuss them and maybe understand each<br/>
other&#39;s position better.  PErsonally I think we&#39;re one of the best of the<br/>
lot.  Just about everyone I know has a MUCH harder time with just about<br/>
everything else (except druids, DAMN, what&#39;s up with these guys that allow<br/>
them to frikkin jump into the high end in like weeks?!?! That&#39;s what I want<br/>
to know!)<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt;     Pricks like me? Bah, I wont take this part to the message <br/>
&gt; list.  Though<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s interesting to note I&#39;m &quot;a prick&quot; because I don&#39;t like <br/>
&gt; the game or<br/>
&gt; varant, and say so.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;         As for the game, I loved it at first, sure.  I read <br/>
&gt; all the hype,<br/>
&gt; looked at all the screen shots, etc.  Had allot planned out, <br/>
&gt; too, and all of<br/>
&gt; it being role-play.  I dealt with all of the plans being <br/>
&gt; squashed because of<br/>
&gt; some idiotic limitation or another, got burned a bit further <br/>
&gt; when I found I<br/>
&gt; couldn&#39;t stand back and plan fights out and just had to rush <br/>
&gt; in and start<br/>
&gt; swinging (why are we magic classes?), or do the same with the <br/>
&gt; pet.  But I<br/>
&gt; dealt with it.  Then there&#39;s the problems with the spells, <br/>
&gt; variant&#39;s general<br/>
&gt; attitude towards the Necro class, and a ton of other <br/>
&gt; problems.  Just makes<br/>
&gt; me think they&#39;ve got  a big head about &#39;em and they don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; really give a<br/>
&gt; stink &#39;bout us players.  That&#39;s what ticks me off the most, <br/>
&gt; not being free<br/>
&gt; to come up with our own strategy or using our class to their <br/>
&gt; full potential<br/>
&gt; because of deliberate restrictions comes in a very fast second.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;         As for why it&#39;s important to see the number of your <br/>
&gt; mana.  I&#39;m the<br/>
&gt; type of person who likes to plan ahead, _way_ ahead.  <br/>
&gt; Deciding which spells<br/>
&gt; to memorize, in what order to cast them, which to buy and not <br/>
&gt; to buy, and so<br/>
&gt; on and so on.  The amount you have plays allot in this.  Say, for<br/>
&gt; instance... You have a total of 200 mana and you have 50 <br/>
&gt; left.  Cost 45 to<br/>
&gt; cast a certain spell.  You can either use a spell to get out <br/>
&gt; of there and<br/>
&gt; survive or cast that one and leave you with only 5mana left, and thus,<br/>
&gt; totally open.  Not knowing how much you have left, just a <br/>
&gt; silly bar graph,<br/>
&gt; you go ahead and cast it.  Whoops, you just peeved out the mob, it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; frenzying you, and you&#39;ve no way to get the heaven&#39;s out of <br/>
&gt; there.  I know,<br/>
&gt; Gate and such takes way more mana than that, but for an <br/>
&gt; example it&#39;ll do.<br/>
&gt; If you&#39;d known precisely what you had, along with knowing how <br/>
&gt; much a spell<br/>
&gt; takes (as we do, at least), you&#39;d have been able to very <br/>
&gt; quickly figure that<br/>
&gt; the escape, was the way to go.  Besides, I like knowing.  The <br/>
&gt; least they<br/>
&gt; could do is make it an option.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;         As for ruining play, I make it a point to be very <br/>
&gt; helpful to others<br/>
&gt; in the game, especialy to newbies and such.  I figure players <br/>
&gt; have it hard<br/>
&gt; enough without somebody making it a pain for &#39;em, may as well <br/>
&gt; help.  I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; see where that&#39;s ruining play. :-)  Just simply, I don&#39;t like <br/>
&gt; Varant.  I<br/>
&gt; think I&#39;ll leave EQ, soon as somebody else comes out with 3D <br/>
&gt; fantasy world.<br/>
&gt; It&#39;ll happen soon enough, but until, it&#39;ll &quot;have to do&quot;.  As <br/>
&gt; much as I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; like &#39;em, and as much as the world peeves me off at times, it <br/>
&gt; _is_ a very<br/>
&gt; nice chance to role-play (if you can find somebody to do so <br/>
&gt; with) and I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; waited a very long time for at least somebody to _attempt_ a <br/>
&gt; real fantasy<br/>
&gt; world for your charecter to live in.<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Why do they have to put the actual number of how much mana <br/>
&gt; you have? if<br/>
&gt; you<br/>
&gt; &gt; can&#39;t cast the spell then you can&#39;t cast it. You know by <br/>
&gt; testing, and if<br/>
&gt; you<br/>
&gt; &gt; are any good then you already know about how much you can <br/>
&gt; cast before you<br/>
&gt; run<br/>
&gt; &gt; out. I think you need to just calm down, and then think <br/>
&gt; about what you<br/>
&gt; &gt; posted. The slogan is cool, and you obviously liked the <br/>
&gt; game for atleast a<br/>
&gt; &gt; little bit otherwise you wouldn&#39;t have bought it. Oh ya, if <br/>
&gt; you don&#39;t like<br/>
&gt; &gt; the game, quit. We don&#39;t need pricks like you ruining the <br/>
&gt; play of others.<br/>
