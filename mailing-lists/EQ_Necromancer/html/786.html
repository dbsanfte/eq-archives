<div id="ygrps-yiv-418759057">Its on the 3rd floor as you enter 3rd floor look for a fake wall on the <br/>
right (it has some little holes in it, You could also take the quick route <br/>
and drop down well. <br/>
    As for getting it at 21 that wont be a problem but you really need a <br/>
group here because the room constantly spawns and you must kill all as it <br/>
does.   Grouping here is usaually not a problem the robe and dagger spawn in <br/>
the two little alcoves on the left and straight as you enter fake wall but in <br/>
the right alcove is the famous BBC spawn.  Good news is the robe and dagger <br/>
spawn more frequent than the shadowknight.  I got my goss robe and dagger off <br/>
same necro theur.<br/>
