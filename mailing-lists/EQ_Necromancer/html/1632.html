 </span></blockquote>just dont get too nosy, especially around the bars.  there is a bar on the <br/>
dock where an ogre paladin (?!) is, and he has gladly ripped me a new one <br/>
before.  there is also a bard and (i think) a ranger in another bar, and a <br/>
dwarf warrior in another... the point is, just dont go to bars in freeport.<br/>
