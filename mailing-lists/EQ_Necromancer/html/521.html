<div id="ygrps-yiv-2037043778">I keep wondering why more people aren&#39;t using vampiric embrace. I use it<br/>
constantly while I&#39;m fighting. When you accidentally get two creatures<br/>
instead of one, you need to be able to help your pet from taking some<br/>
damage. I DOT the badguys, then step in so that when the mob faces me, my<br/>
pet is striking their backs. With vampiric embrace running, sucking in 30 HP<br/>
every now and then, I can stand and fight much longer than I would have been<br/>
able to without it. Your pet is dealing the serious damage at up to 46<br/>
magical damage per round (I&#39;m level 18) but, my own 18 damage hitting 2 out<br/>
of three times is nothing to laugh at either. In the course of a fight, I<br/>
will dish out over 100 damage to the creature, which is significant, and my<br/>
pet will hit harder and more often with the back attack bonuses. The<br/>
vampiric embrace flare that happens about one in 5 hits is a godsend, and<br/>
sometimes it flares so often that my health doesn&#39;t drop much at all. Losing<br/>
health is nothing to worry about, either. I have 350 HP after I buff myself,<br/>
and I can handle a lot of abuse. Combined with the occasional Life drain,<br/>
there&#39;s nothing I enjoy more than good hand to hand combat. And on a final<br/>
note, when my pet does die through poor tactics on my part, it&#39;s nice to be<br/>
able to stand toe to toe with the beast and finish him off because I have<br/>
good defence, offence, and 2HB skills. Necromancers are made to fight and we<br/>
can be very effective at it. Give it a try. To those of you who ask &quot;Who<br/>
wants to stand toe to toe with a level (whatever) mob?&quot; The answer is &quot;I<br/>
do.&quot; And I&#39;ll be beaming a smile while I do it.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;     Its still hotly debated.  Basically as far as anyone knows, the only<br/>
&gt; thing DEX does is increase your ability to recover while spellcasting, and<br/>
&gt; THAT&#39;S IT.  How important is this?  No clue, I haven&#39;t researched this<br/>
&gt; extensively.  Basically if this is the case then you probably don&#39;t need<br/>
&gt; much DEX.  The REAL primary attribute is INT, through and through.  INT<br/>
&gt; directly affects how much mana you have, thus how much longer you stay in<br/>
&gt; the field before meditating.  We&#39;ve discussed this before, but basically<br/>
&gt; having as much INT as possible is probably the best way to go.  After<br/>
that,<br/>
&gt; dumping your remaining points is up to you.  You aren&#39;t a fighter, so<br/>
&gt; putting points into Agility seems useless, most monsters will be hitting<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; and hitting you hard anyway.  Same goes for Stamina, you&#39;ll never have the<br/>
&gt; hitpoints of even a Rogue, so seriously what&#39;s another hitpoint per level?<br/>
&gt; Say you&#39;re level 25 and have 25 extra hitpoints?  Well sadly level 25<br/>
&gt; monsters are probably doing close to 40-90 points of damage per hit<br/>
anyway,<br/>
&gt; so MAYBE one more hit.  Don&#39;t get hit.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I might say its more important for wizards as they don&#39;t have pets,<br/>
&gt; but they should be in groups anyway.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Basically I know one solid thing.  Multiples of 5 in your INT is<br/>
&gt; good and the more you can get the better you are.  If you are looking at a<br/>
&gt; choice between a +3 AGI item and a +1 INT item you should take the INT<br/>
item.<br/>
&gt; There are many  INT increasing items in the game for virtually all armor<br/>
&gt; slots garnering you probably more than 20 more INT points, which is 4 more<br/>
&gt; mana per level (and at level 25, that would equate to having another 100<br/>
&gt; mana to play with)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hit the INT hard, then dump whatever you have left somewhere, heck,<br/>
&gt; maybe in STRENGTH so you can carry more.<br/>

&gt; Why is dex our main attrib beside INT if we rarely go hand to hand?<br/>
&gt; (I know we have a touch spell, but most people say that is more for<br/>
&gt; shadowknights)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am mad I put my extra (after maxing int) points into dex now when I read<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; million posts now that say Dex is useless.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I mean from all I&#39;ve read AGILITY is 100 times better for any caster!!!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Please say it ain&#39;t so, and that my 100 dex (gnome) isn&#39;t a big frekin&#39;<br/>
&gt; waste . . .<br/>
