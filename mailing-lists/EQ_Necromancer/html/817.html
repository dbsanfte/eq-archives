<div id="ygrps-yiv-943547977">You want to hunt Jonah Bucker in Lake Rathe.  He is in the South West corner in an inlet.  You will see an inlet that has a small island sitting in the middle of the entrance.  If you follow this inlet it is going to split.  On one side is a double Aviak Guard spawn.  On the other side is JB.  You will see a shack, thats JB house.  He is good for 17 and 18th lvl then hit the single Aviak Guard on the SE side of the lake until 21st or 22nd.  Decent money and great exp.<br/>

             Two major problems with camping oasis and killing caimens and crocs:<br/>
             1.  Absolutely no loot, none at all except for meat.  As a level 17 necro i <br/>
<br/>
             can solo almost anything there (the deepwaters are almost all yellow to me <br/>
             but are still fairly easy to kill) but I will have no resources to buy <br/>
             spells and upgrade equipment if I stay here.<br/>
<br/>
             2.  Oasis is incredibly boring, for some reason, killing crocadilles is mind <br/>
<br/>
             numbingly boring for me.<br/>
<br/>
             I don&#39;t have any great alternatives though.  I&#39;ve been to Lake Ratheter and <br/>
<br/>
             South Karanna to hunt Aviaks and most con red to me (except darters) and <br/>
             NOONE in that area seems interested in grouping with dark elf necromancers. <br/>
              <br/>
             I have taken to hunting in Najena of late which is dangerous but quite fun. <br/>
              <br/>
             If anyone has suggestions on huntings spots which have good exp, are fun, <br/>
             and give at least adequate loot I would be thrilled to here from you.<br/>

             &gt;N. Ro ==&gt; All the different mummies (crypt mummies one at a time)<br/>
             &gt;Oasis ==&gt; Start with caimans, then crocs, then deep water caimans, and <br/>
             &gt;finally deep water crocs this should take you to 21 lvl. </span></blockquote></div>
