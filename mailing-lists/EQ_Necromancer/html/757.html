<b>Subject:</b> Qeynos Faction for DE Necros <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-88300372">Not sure if this has come up here or not, but I spent the last 2 days<br/>
*slaughtering* gnolls in Blackburrow. probably about 6-8 hrs of pure<br/>
carnage.  Mostly concentrating on the commanders/elite guards in the top<br/>
rooms.  After all this, I decided to check my faction, and I&#39;m happy to say<br/>
that I just successfully banked in the fair city of Qeynos.  Those human<br/>
types aren&#39;t so bad afterall...just have to clean up their vermin first :)<br/>
