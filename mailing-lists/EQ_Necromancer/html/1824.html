<div id="ygrps-yiv-1606070788">Ok its not specifically a Necro topic but since probably more Dark elves<br/>
hang around this email list than any other I figured I would ask here.<br/>
<br/>
I am currently trying to raise my Dark Barginers Faction.  Thats basically<br/>
Neriak Merchant faction.  Its an easy thing to do if your a Dark elf, as<br/>
you can do some of the quests.  Unfortunately I am a gnome (it has its<br/>
advantages (non kos in North Freeport)).  However I don&#39;t currently have<br/>
enough Dark Barginers faction to do quests with them.  I can still buy bank<br/>
and sell in Neriak but I am trying to get some better pricing.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know of any Mobs that will provide a positive bonus to Dark<br/>
Barginers faction?<br/>
