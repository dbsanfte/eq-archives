<div id="ygrps-yiv-1274604590">Well I have been one and my gnome got to 16th faster than the DE and I <br/>
played the DE more.  Intact have had 4 people switch to gnome because of <br/>
it.  May be it is the creatures we are killing or the fact that I have more <br/>
mana so can fight a bit more (145 int).  But the big plus of being well <br/>
liked in &quot;Evil&quot; towns including your own is good, since there are VERY few <br/>
ways to get factions with the evil cities.<br/>

He meant in general, Dark elf necros get exp bonuses.<br/>
As far as I understand it, there are class/race combinations that do give <br/>
penalties to<br/>
experience, for example a dwarven paladin needs more exp than almost any <br/>
other<br/>
combination of race and class to gain levels. Furthermore, supposedly there <br/>
are also<br/>
certain combinations that give experience bonuses. The example that was <br/>
suggested was a<br/>
dark elven necromancer. Apparently, the rumor that DE necros get an exp <br/>
bonus (any and<br/>
all times exp is gained) has been confirmed by at least one GM.<br/>
This, is what I have read and heard from fellow players.<br/>

&gt; Bonuses on WHAT, I know clerics get them for undead, also when fighting<br/>
&gt; undead I seem to go up faster too.  Maybe he is talking about race <br/>
