<div id="ygrps-yiv-315881759">I stopped playing my necro at 30 a long time ago. Since then I have leveled up a Druid to 53 but wishing I had a high level group character, I am working on one now a low level enchanter that may not even make it to 20 but who knows<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I am also looking forward to Star Wars Galaxies, looks like alot of fun.</div>
