<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-953637370">Ok vamp embrace is not worth the money still after the u grade in my book.<br/>
They made it so you can use weapons with it. There is a 50% chance that you<br/>
will get a life tap effect, and then is does only a little bit. This spell<br/>
is better for sk. As they can take up frount battle. SO avoid this spell and<br/>
stick with grim aura.</div>
