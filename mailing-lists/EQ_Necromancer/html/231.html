<div id="ygrps-yiv-1562795515">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I have a question for all you long time Necromancers...<br/>
<br/>
My first (non-beta) EQ persona is a level 17 Wood Elf Ranger; however, I<br/>
recently started an Erudite Necromancer.  I like playing as a Necro so far<br/>
(only level 3) and want to start putting more time into him; however, I have<br/>
a question.  Should I keep playing as an Erudite or should I change to a<br/>
Dark Elf?  The main problem that I have with Erudites is that no one will<br/>
sell to you in your own city except your guild.  I am also under the<br/>
impression that because you are a Necro you are KOS pretty much everywhere<br/>
(is this correct?).  If this is true then it would seem that a Dark Elf is<br/>
better since you have a whole starting city to operate from and since a<br/>
Necro is KOS anyway being a Dark Elf wouldn&#39;t be any more of a disadvantage.<br/>
The only advantage that I see with Erudites is a slightly higher starting<br/>
INT but this can be offset by putting almost all your extra points into INT<br/>
(or is there some other stat you really need to be higher?).  As another<br/>
question can an Erudite necro travel safely through the evil race cities or<br/>
are they KOS everywhere (basically are they considered to be part of an evil<br/>
race even though they are Erudites)?<br/>
<br/>
As I said I haven&#39;t invested a lot of time in my Necro yet so if I&#39;m going<br/>
to change I want to do it soon.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you</div>
