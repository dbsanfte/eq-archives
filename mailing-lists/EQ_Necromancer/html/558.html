<div id="ygrps-yiv-749998817">The Hide Skill is a ratial skill I believe.  Dark Elves and Wood Elves<br/>
have it.  I&#39;m sure others have it too, not sure though.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, if you successfully hide, just like turning invisible, your pet will<br/>
slay itself.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am a gnome L8 necro and was just wondering, thanks<br/>
&gt; and does the &quot;HIDE&quot; skill kill your pet?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t have a full answer, but here&#39;s a partial anyway --<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; As far as trade skills go, they all start at 0.  Even when you train<br/>
&gt; &gt; at level 50 finally, you start at 0.  The most points your guild will<br/>
&gt; &gt; train you for is the first 20 points of any particular trade skill.<br/>
&gt; &gt; (Sometimes I&#39;ve been able to squeeze in 21, but close enough)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; After that it tells you, that you must practice the skill in the real<br/>
&gt; &gt; world.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Other skills work the same way, except that after the initial 20 (again,<br/>
&gt; &gt; this number seems to vary a tad depending on the skill) but then you will<br/>
&gt; &gt; have to pay money to practice.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; There are also those skills that you get because of your particular class<br/>
&gt; &gt; or race, that are given an initial &#39;boost&#39;.  This includes examples like<br/>
&gt; &gt; the necro&#39;s Hide skill.  It&#39;s initially at Below Average, meaning you&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; &gt; got a 40&#39;ish skill in it already.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Skills that you aquire, like Dodge, Dual Wield (for other classes) start<br/>
&gt; &gt; out at a higher skill value than 0.  This is diffrent for all the skills<br/>
&gt; &gt; as far as i&#39;ve been able to tell.<br/>
