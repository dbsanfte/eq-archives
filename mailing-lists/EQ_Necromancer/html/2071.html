<div id="ygrps-yiv-1678323521">Hehe...<br/>
I also play a Troll SK.....<br/>
First time I was ever PK&#39;d as the necro....I was in Blackburrow....and had a<br/>
train about half a mile long on me.  I yelled for help, and an Troll chopped<br/>
thru the train like it was warm butter.  I said thanks, he said no thanks<br/>
needed.....He didnt want to see the train to kill me, he would much rather<br/>
do it himself.  He did.<br/>
