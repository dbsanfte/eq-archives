<div id="ygrps-yiv-1429694789">I would say this makes us able to work longer, as in time between<br/>
resting, but eventually we will need to sit down and rest.  These spells<br/>
(combine AoD with LifeDrain) were made to make us more powerful, but not<br/>
eternally fighting.  We can last longer draining and getting faster mana and<br/>
draining our victims, but it does give us less options.  We HAVE to drain<br/>
our victims, we can&#39;t just sit back and let the DoT do its work, this means<br/>
the monsters get more pissed at us, which leads to obvious consequences.  I<br/>
would say not to get overzealous with this, but try to find some happy<br/>
medium.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hello all<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have been looking over some site&#39;s spell lists for the <br/>
&gt; necromancer. I have<br/>
&gt; recently created one as a 2nd char and am up to lev 5.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I noticed we get some spells that erode our hps while <br/>
&gt; regenerating our mana<br/>
&gt; at the same time. Does that imply we can use the enemy MOB as <br/>
&gt; a hp battery<br/>
&gt; to solo with minimal net loss of hps or manna?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here&#39;s what I mean. Can I cast &quot;dark pack&quot; (name might be <br/>
&gt; wrong) or &quot;allure<br/>
&gt; of death&quot; on myself. Thus my hps start to fall. Then I engage <br/>
&gt; the enemy with<br/>
&gt; the classic 3 DOT spells plus send my pet in. By this time <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m out half my<br/>
&gt; manna from the DOT and my hps are falling from the &quot;Allure of <br/>
&gt; death&quot; or<br/>
&gt; whatever. My manna is comming back faster then normal as <br/>
&gt; well. Can I now<br/>
&gt; life drain the enemy for hps that will turn to manna to use <br/>
&gt; to life drain<br/>
&gt; enemy again? Will this hold up in a fight? IE. The fight ends <br/>
&gt; and I still<br/>
&gt; have most my hps and half my manna? As the life drains ended <br/>
&gt; up being free<br/>
&gt; as they were from the monsters hps converted to my hps <br/>
&gt; converted to manna?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am interested in this or other fighting styles?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sincerely a curious young necromancer<br/>
