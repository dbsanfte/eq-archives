<b>Subject:</b> Re: Fw: [EQMagicians] Just a thought.. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1197126458">Yup, this makes sense, but I&#39;m not a very good pet owner, I guess. Mine die<br/>
all the time *g*. I figure since bone chips are free, and mana is free...<br/>
who cares? If I get a strong pet I&#39;ll take pains to keep it around, but<br/>
otherwise I figure the pet is expendable. Magicians have to buy malochite so<br/>
I can see being careful there.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never tried this, but could you sic your pet on a monster, run a goodly<br/>
distance away, then when your pet dies summon a second one to send after the<br/>
beast?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Ok if you are level 6 here is a scale for you. Rank 1 is level 1<br/>
&gt; to 4 as we<br/>
&gt; all know. Each rank is made up of 4 levels. The first 2 levels in<br/>
&gt; a rank you<br/>
&gt; can take a yellow.. most times. But then the last 2 levels in a rank you<br/>
&gt; have to be careful. Yellow&#39;s are now red for your pet. So now the third<br/>
&gt; level in a rank a black ranking is realy yellow. then in the last<br/>
&gt; level in a<br/>
&gt; rank blue in some cases are realy yellow. If you dont under stand<br/>
&gt; what I am<br/>
&gt; saying.. Just tell me. I will  try and explan this agian. The main reason<br/>
&gt; for this is the stenth of your pet. Most necros that have a hard time is<br/>
&gt; because they for get to look at what they are going to fight threw there<br/>
&gt; pets eyes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There&#39;s my 2 cents. </span></blockquote></div>
