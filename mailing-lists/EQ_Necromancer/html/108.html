<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-296402351"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;Ok I am off to free port to try my guild task for Neriak. I have to deliver<br/>
 </span></blockquote>a message and get one to give to my guild master. Ok I know that I might get<br/>
slaughtered on sight if I go the wrong places, but I need to know how well<br/>
Gather shadows invis works. Also does anyone know where this guy is I am<br/>
looking for?&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Let us know how it goes... I left Neriak as a 4th level Necro and have not<br/>
returned (I&#39;ve been in Feydark).  Fortunately, I found the Human Necromancer<br/>
Guildmaster underneath Freeport and have been able to buy spells or train when<br/>
needed.<br/>
<br/>
I am curious about the quests out of Neriak and may head home if they are worth<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the spell list I posted earlier, apparently it got cut off (onelist<br/>
has a size limit), regardless, eq.stratics.com has a real nice list they just<br/>
posted of Necromancer skills.<br/>
<br/>
Are there any more decent Necromancer pages out there?</div>
