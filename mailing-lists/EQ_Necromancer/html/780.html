<div id="ygrps-yiv-152016370"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Question, Where is a good place for a LvL 22 DE Necro to fight?  Pls<br/>
 </span></blockquote>don&#39;t<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;  say Cazic Thule cuz I HATE the PING in there and my frame rate sucks in<br/>
&gt;&gt;  there and its so crowded.  Anywhere but there, any suggestions?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;South Karan The Aviacs are good to hunt.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The big thing about being a necro is the abilty to be ablie to solo huge<br/>
yellow and sometimes reds. I fought the aviak guards at level 16 and thats<br/>
what they were for me. I went from 16 frighting red guards and yellows. to<br/>
being 21 in 3 days. At that point I see a yellow once in a blue moon. Time<br/>
to move on!!!! Go kill somewhere else where you can get better exp. I moved<br/>
on to treant in kartana. The staff is worth 13 pp in the store alon. HEHE<br/>
and the aviaks are broke mo fos.. Good luck..</div>
