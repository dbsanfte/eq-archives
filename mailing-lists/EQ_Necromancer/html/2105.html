 </span></blockquote>Welcome and umm you know I am pulling my hair out to come up with a jewel of <br/>
wisdom and I cant. I also have played many classes, 45 druid is the highest <br/>
and I have had a blast with my two primary secondarys enchanter and necro.<br/>
<br/>
One thing that I did find frustrating was all the &quot;necros are gods&quot; <br/>
information I was reading. I tried to be that god and died more often than <br/>
not until I learned my way. A really nice site is eqnecro.com</div>
