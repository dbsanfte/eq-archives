&gt;     True, but I think I&#39;ll kind of go with your idea and say...not all<br/>
&gt; player classes can keep track of the creatures, so why can all of the<br/>
&gt; creatures keep track of the players?  My Necro certainly <br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t know where<br/>
&gt; that creature went, he just knows.. he smacked it with a <br/>
&gt; spell and suddenly<br/>
&gt; it ducked behind a wall. Is it coming around from behind? Or <br/>
&gt; maybe it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; rushing at him through the shadows..  certainly, if the <br/>
&gt; creature took off<br/>
&gt; running to the other side of the zone, I&#39;d have to do some <br/>
&gt; serious looking<br/>
&gt; to find it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;     So, I think it&#39;d be a good idea to only have certain <br/>
&gt; creatures have the<br/>
&gt; ability to track their opponent.  Or like it was said, give <br/>
&gt; them a certain<br/>
&gt; time limit that they follow/track a player.  It&#39;s just plain <br/>
&gt; silly that the<br/>
&gt; thing knows, from several miles away, that you just sat down <br/>
&gt; and now you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; an easy target..<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>	That&#39;s the part.  I DOESN&#39;T KNOW that.  It has a list of people it<br/>
has to kill and you are on it.  Depending on that list you could be next or<br/>
it has to kill two other people first.<br/>
<br/>
	Its not a pretty picture, but there are too many problems with<br/>
gameplay to consider.  People will find a way to cheat, and the best way to<br/>
prevent that is make sure that if you start a fight that it gets finished<br/>
one way or another.<br/>
<br/>
	Human players have a disadvantage of knowledge in a sense, but they<br/>
are also smarter.  IMHO, I think training is a natural and exciting part of<br/>
the game.  Sure its damn irritating and very unsettling, but sometimes its<br/>
actually quite exciting and fun.  You eventually learn to stay away from<br/>
&quot;train tracks&quot; and to avoid people running around.<br/>
<br/>
	It would take a signficant amount of dev time to come up with a<br/>
better solution and it would definitely be a lot more processor heavy (think<br/>
about all the delays, aging factors, and whatnot that EVERY monster would<br/>
have to have in EVERY zone).  Its not pretty really, which is why the closer<br/>
you get to reality the hard it is to implement. ;)<br/>

&gt; &gt; I think you can keep track of a monster from across the zone, then<br/>
&gt; &gt; so can they.  I don&#39;t see a problem with this since it helps avoid<br/>
&gt; cheating.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Rangers can track any monster or player they want in a zone <br/>
&gt; from anywhere<br/>
&gt; &gt; regardless of if they actually passed by there or not.  If <br/>
&gt; the monsters<br/>
&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t know where everything was it would lead to a lot of <br/>
&gt; AI problems and<br/>
&gt; &gt; issues.  AI just isn&#39;t that good yet in games.  I think <br/>
&gt; Verant has done an<br/>
&gt; &gt; alright job so far.  There&#39;s obvious bugs, but at least <br/>
&gt; monsters help each<br/>
&gt; &gt; other out, cast spells right, and do a myriad of other <br/>
&gt; things.  In just<br/>
&gt; &gt; about every other game the computer ALWAYS has a complete <br/>
&gt; knowledge base<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; the area to work with (like RTS games) but it just <br/>
&gt; &quot;pretends&quot; it doesn&#39;t.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Those of you who played Red Alert saw this alot when your <br/>
&gt; secret assault<br/>
&gt; &gt; force of tanks that were going to flank the base while the <br/>
&gt; AI opponent<br/>
&gt; &gt; attacked yours was suddenly attacked BY the enemy force.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Again, if I had to choose between more realism and more gameplay, I<br/>
&gt; &gt; would always choose more gameplay.  You want realism?  Go play Close<br/>
&gt; Combat<br/>
&gt; &gt; III.<br/>
