<div id="ygrps-yiv-1330743336"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; 	So if you can make a list of things that you are pissed off about<br/>
&gt; the Necromancer, I think we can discuss them and maybe understand each<br/>
&gt; other&#39;s position better.  PErsonally I think we&#39;re one of the best of the<br/>
&gt; lot.  Just about everyone I know has a MUCH harder time with just about<br/>
&gt; everything else (except druids, DAMN, what&#39;s up with these guys that allow<br/>
&gt; them to frikkin jump into the high end in like weeks?!?! That&#39;s<br/>
&gt; what I want<br/>
&gt; to know!)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have rogue, magician, and shaman (my primary) characters in addition to my<br/>
necro. Now granted I&#39;m only at level 6, but so far this has been my easiest<br/>
character by far. I can take on a yellow monster with a bit of luck, and<br/>
whites are a no brainer. My shaman (lvl 11) has been slain by blue critters,<br/>
can take a white only if the gods are smiling on him and then will finish<br/>
the battle at zero mana and almost no health, and yellow is a death wish.<br/>
<br/>
Magician is a bit better, but his run-ins with yellows have been horrific.<br/>
Rogue is worst of all, of course. So (in MY experience, anyway), of these 4<br/>
classes, necro is the strongest. You want weak? try a rogue... heh</div>
