<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-496384965">Has anyone on the list found Levant and cast it?<br/>
<br/>
I was reading the spell description on EQNecro.  Sounds like a cool spell, <br/>
but the description was somewhat ambiguous.  Are there fixed points within <br/>
a zone that it teleports you to, or does it just take you from one zone <br/>
line to another?<br/>
<br/>
Just curious, as if it does what I think it does I can&#39;t wait to get high <br/>
enough to use it, hehe :)<br/>
