<div id="ygrps-yiv-639622207">I would check out the Necromonitor... don&#39;t have the bookmark on me<br/>
immediately but there&#39;s a link from www.eqvault.com<br/>
<br/>
	There are other places... if you want a FULL list of necromancer<br/>
spells with basic details check out the EQ&#39;Lizer at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://gameznet.com/eq/">http://gameznet.com/eq/</a><br/>
<br/>
	This is also the DEFINITIVE place to learn about monsters, items,<br/>
quests, and zones.  I love this site totally.  Definitely spend an hour or<br/>
two looking through all the information they have here.<br/>
<br/>
	Also, followers of Innoruuk (most necromancers and stuff) are KOS<br/>
only in North Freeport where the guards are actually paladins.  Everywhere<br/>
else (cept don&#39;t go IN the fighter&#39;s guild, oh yeah, and necromancers are<br/>
KOS at the Academy of the Arcane) you should be fine but most/all merchants<br/>
will not do business with you.<br/>
<br/>
	As for the quests, they are mostly lame.  The beetle eye quest gives<br/>
you a smidgeon of experience and a few coppers (wherea 8 beetle eyes will<br/>
fetch you almost 2 gold).  The elephant horn and kerra isle beetle eye quest<br/>
also give less than useful stuff, but maybe I did them at a later level.<br/>
After that I don&#39;t know... personally I found them all to be a waste of time<br/>
unless you happen to be of an appropriate level (that level being anything<br/>
less than 4, maybe 8 for Kerra Isle).<br/>
<br/>
	I recommend staying on home ground till level 8, then heading to<br/>
Befallen (or Unrest for Gnomes, but be CAREFUL there) and leveling to 12<br/>
there...<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;Ok I am off to free port to try my guild task for Neriak. I <br/>
&gt; have to deliver<br/>
&gt; a message and get one to give to my guild master. Ok I know <br/>
&gt; that I might get<br/>
&gt; slaughtered on sight if I go the wrong places, but I need to <br/>
&gt; know how well<br/>
&gt; Gather shadows invis works. Also does anyone know where this <br/>
&gt; guy is I am<br/>
&gt; looking for?&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Let us know how it goes... I left Neriak as a 4th level Necro <br/>
&gt; and have not<br/>
&gt; returned (I&#39;ve been in Feydark).  Fortunately, I found the <br/>
&gt; Human Necromancer<br/>
&gt; Guildmaster underneath Freeport and have been able to buy <br/>
&gt; spells or train when<br/>
&gt; needed.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am curious about the quests out of Neriak and may head home <br/>
&gt; if they are worth<br/>
&gt; it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As far as the spell list I posted earlier, apparently it got <br/>
&gt; cut off (onelist<br/>
&gt; has a size limit), regardless, eq.stratics.com has a real <br/>
&gt; nice list they just<br/>
&gt; posted of Necromancer skills.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Are there any more decent Necromancer pages out there?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
