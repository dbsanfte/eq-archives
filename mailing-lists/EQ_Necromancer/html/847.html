<div id="ygrps-yiv-1482483741">first I&#39;ve heard about it, but I think I experienced it once before...a<br/>
friend and I were taking down Lockjaw, and at the end of the fight, he<br/>
simply vanished...very disconcerting, considering we&#39;re both spellcasters,<br/>
which made the fight pretty scary at times.<br/>

&gt; Can anyone tell me more about this bug?   I had this happen to me a few<br/>
&gt; times and was not sure what the hell was happening when the MOB just<br/>
&gt; vanished into thin air.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I do<br/>
&gt; &gt; not use my DoTs on high-level item-carrying mobs however, the risk that<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; bug will strike and vanish the mob along with the xp gained is too<br/>
great.<br/>
&gt; &gt; It happens too often on regular mobs anyway.<br/>
