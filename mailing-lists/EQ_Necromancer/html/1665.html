<div id="ygrps-yiv-630655955">It&#39;s easy actually. Specs first of have pretty low magic resist and secondly<br/>
our dots are easy to get on any red mob. A necro could easily kill specs at<br/>
that level they are probably the easiest high lvel mob in the game right<br/>
now. I remember when I was leevel 24 on my way to CT i ran into one without<br/>
sow and I still made it halfway across the zone to ct with only losing 1 bub<br/>
of life.<br/>

&gt;The specs can go as high as lvl. 37, so I can only guess that the feerott<br/>
&gt;specs were not as high a level when you were soloing them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Otherwise, I can&#39;t imagine how you could get any spells to stick on a mob 5<br/>
&gt;levels above yourself.<br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt; I would not solo specs until you are at least 2 shades of blue over<br/>

&gt;The demon is a liar. He will lie to confuse us. But he will also mix lies<br/>
