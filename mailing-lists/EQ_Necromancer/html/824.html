<div id="ygrps-yiv-2026705218"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
&gt;Does anyone know why we need a quill and paper or do we even need them?<br/>
&gt; what are they for?  i have found the book of binding for the necro but<br/>
&gt;what are the other books ie diabluque   do they give spell ingredients?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>At this point no one knows what they are for. I am at level 58 in making my<br/>
own spells. I have made a bunch. Never used them!!! If you find out pleas<br/>
tell me :)</div>
