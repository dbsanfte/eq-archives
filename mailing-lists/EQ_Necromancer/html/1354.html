<b>Subject:</b> Where to hunt? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1584141611">Hi, I am a level 15 DE Necro and I was wondering if anyone had any <br/>
suggestions as to where I could hunt?I am currently doing Dervs in NRo, but <br/>
even if I have the entire Dorn camp to myself, the experience isn&#39;t that <br/>
good(great loot though) cause they all con blue or green.I was wondering if <br/>
anyone could recommend anywhere else to hunt?Also, could anyone recommend <br/>
anywhere to hunt at lvl 16 as well?It&#39;ll soon come and I would like to <br/>
already have an idea of where I want to go-besides crocs and camains(sp) in <br/>
Oasis.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance!<br/>
Aazen, lvl 15(soon to be 16) DE Necromancer</div>
