<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can safely say it wasn&#39;t the DOT bug..I&#39;ve *never* experienced that bug<br/>
while not grouped, and when I did experience it in the group, it was always<br/>
in a group with a 2nd necromancer (I think that the mob would die in one<br/>
tick from 2 different dot&#39;s from 2 different casters, thus not knowing who<br/>
to credit with the kill, so it just plain disappears)  I did hit the guy<br/>
late with the DOT&#39;s but he was practically at full health.  Also, screaming<br/>
terror was fixed to not work properly outdoors...which Qeynos Hills<br/>
definitely is.  Yet another bug :) mobs can use it outside but we can&#39;t?<br/>
C&#39;mon!  The combination of xp/corpse loss on both the enchanter by the lake<br/>
and Undying Varsoon, I&#39;m 90% sure that this bug is caused by pets becoming<br/>
mobs for all intents and purposes.  Whatever it is, I really hope they fix<br/>
it soon, because I&#39;m not leaving Qeynos Hills until I have that stone.<br/>
Though killing guards, poachers, rangers and druids is great xp, I&#39;d like to<br/>
move on to something with a bit better loot than bronze weapons ;)</div>
