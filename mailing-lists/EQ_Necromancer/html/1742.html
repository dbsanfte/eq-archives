<b>Subject:</b> L16 - where to buy voice graft <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1943193382">Woo - made L16, stopped in at Neriak (I&#39;m a gnome, but figured they&#39;d be<br/>
more complete than Freeport) and bought 8 of my spells.  I was told by<br/>
someone that Voice Graft is available in some cities, but it&#39;s either on a<br/>
vendor that won&#39;t talk to me (about 1/3 of them) or not there.  Also<br/>
checked Freeport Necro/SK guild with no luck.<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone provide a city that they know for certian carries this spell?<br/>
Vendor name and location would be great, but knowing it&#39;s in the city is<br/>
sufficient.<br/>
<br/>
Also, for the research-only spells, what&#39;s the best way to get the<br/>
components?  Do you just auction in every zone you enter?  Is there<br/>
normally a strong presence of people selling words at the Bazaar (this is<br/>
Quellious, if it matters).<br/>
