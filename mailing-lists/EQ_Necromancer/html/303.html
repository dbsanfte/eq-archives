<b>Subject:</b> CONCERNING LEVELS OF A PET <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2138403851">Ok, I am tired of hearing this. Ok I ALWAYS know what level of pet I have. A general rule is the higher the level then they have all of the skills.  Ok first off we all understand that black/white is even and same level. Ok well then you learn the second step is that yellow is one level above you. But in actuallity when you get level 16ish or so yellow can mean 2 levels. But at 16 I never get a yellow pet. I usually just get an even pet. Err when I was 16. Well then I turned 17. So I know this. As you notice things con blue when they are lower. Well in the lower levels there are pretty much 2 basic blues<br/>
<br/>
risky but upper hand<br/>
and risky but worth a try<br/>
<br/>
Well upper hand means 2 levels below you and worth a try means one level below you.<br/>
<br/>
Now when I was level 15. My goal was this, to summon a upper hand pet. Other stuff was green. Simple as that. Then I knew my pet was going to be a level 12 pet. Simple. Now at level 16 it changes a bit. They add one more blue and it goes like this..from lowest to highest..this is blue conning..err 2 more..pardon me<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
risky but upper hand 3 levels below<br/>
risky but worth a try 2 levels below<br/>
risky but dangerous one level below<br/>
<br/>
Now risky but dangerous is one level below and so forth. Though I believe that insteafd of upper hand it says something &quot;you should be able to..but not certain&quot; but ti is blue. I haven&#39;t paid much attnetion. I just always know what my target con is. So you all people want a high level pet. Well that is how to do it. I personally think it would be a waste of time to have a spell to do it when they give us a way already. I don&#39;t need a spell to con my pet. Well that is my 2 cents.</div>
