<div id="ygrps-yiv-889317242">1. you can solo giant skels at your level pretty easy, only problem is that<br/>
there isn&#39;t a whole lot of them in the mountains :(    I spent a lot of time<br/>
just wandering around looking for them at your level or moving on to number<br/>
#2<br/>
<br/>
2. The levels have changed on the named unkempt druids (near the ring), but<br/>
I don&#39;t think they changed the wandering ones.  But if I remember correctly,<br/>
there were either a lot of green unkempts or red ones that were really<br/>
nasty, so I just worked on Tinbrinn(sp?) which has been up&#39;d in level.<br/>
<br/>
3. Actually the outside of paw may be sweet for your level.  I hear they are<br/>
around the 26th level, so you should be able to fear kite and if you get in<br/>
trouble run for zone.  I&#39;m at 34th now, so I&#39;ll probably head into paw when<br/>
things slow down a bit<br/>

i just have a few questions about hunting in the various zones.  i havent <br/>
played for a while, so i just want to see if my info is still relevant...<br/>
<br/>
a. can a 24 necro solo a giant skel (from rathe mtns)?  if not, what lvl?<br/>
<br/>
b. ive heard there have been changes to the lvls of the unkempt druids.  is <br/>
it too dangerous to hunt them at L24?<br/>
<br/>
c. is paw somewhere i should avoid for a while?<br/>
<br/>
d. have any other areas become good to hunt?  i was at the treants, and it <br/>
was rather boring.  i also only gained about one bubble of xp.<br/>
