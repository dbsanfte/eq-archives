<div id="ygrps-yiv-1732258839">I just wanted to introduce myself to the list.  My main character is a 4th<br/>
level Human Necromancer on Solusek Ro (Craelius), and I also have a 6th<br/>
Level Erudite Necro on Fennin Ro (Noklaus) whom I don&#39;t use often anymore.<br/>
Noklaus just wasn&#39;t turning out to be the character I wanted, so I started<br/>
over and think that Craelius has a long, evil life ahead of him.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefull when the time comes we will meet in Norrath and destroy all<br/>
do-gooders in the land.<br/>
