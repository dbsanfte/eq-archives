is great for 20-25 or so.  Lots of dark blue to yellow targets.  Likewise<br/>
the goblin ruins in the north part of the zone.  At 24 you can take forest<br/>
giants from the fort (before that you&#39;re still ok taking white or easier<br/>
wanderers). Warsliks sucks badly if your framerate doesn&#39;t keep up, but<br/>
other Kunark zones aren&#39;t as bad.<br/>
<br/>
Sarnaks in Lake of Ill Omen are probably too tough to solo well, but you<br/>
can likely take goblins from the caves there.  Sometimes hard to get<br/>
singles though.  <br/>
<br/>
Kurn&#39;s tower in Field of Bone is perfect as well - tons of L15-19 or so<br/>
skellies and buryani.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t found any good darkness/fear spots in Kunark - your strategy is<br/>
mostly dark/dot/heal pet, or sometimes dark/dot/dot/run such that you can<br/>
control the path of the MoB (but then DoT&#39;s only do 2/3 damage).<br/>
<br/>
In the old world, Unrest was great for me at L18-L20 or so, but only in a<br/>
group that can take a room inside.  There are some good spots in Cazic in<br/>
the maze where you can fight safely and pull singles most of the time.<br/>
Better with a partner, but still doable.<br/>
<br/>
Permafrost is absolutely wonderful - if solo, fight the light blue stuff<br/>
in the tunnel before the flag room.  If you get 2-4 friends, you&#39;re ok<br/>
pretty deep in.  <br/>
<br/>
SK and Highkeep are hellholes.  avoid them unless you have a lot of<br/>
patience for 12-year-olds.  <br/>
