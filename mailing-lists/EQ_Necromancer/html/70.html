<div id="ygrps-yiv-918858588">I&#39;ve also been told not to go to North Freeport, because you will be<br/>
KOS. The guards are all paladins... Don&#39;t know if it&#39;s true or not,<br/>
never been there. But the question still remains from the original<br/>
post: Where is the necro guild in Freeport, if there is one?<br/>
<br/>
Also, I&#39;m new to the list, here is a little bio info..<br/>
Playing a Dark Elven Necro named Kagon currently level 6 on Fennin<br/>
(yes, I try to roleplay), who hasn&#39;t even been over the other side of<br/>
the bridge yet in Nektulos Forest, nevermind outside the zone =P<br/>
Necros just level too quick! I also have a Wood Elven Ranger (who<br/>
doesn&#39;t) that I&#39;ve been neglecting since I started the necro this past<br/>
weekend. Just havin too much fun, I love being able to take on whites<br/>
and yellows consistently. <br/>

	In Freeport necros are barely tolerated... but a lot of merchants<br/>
will just look and spit on you.  A good thing to do is go to the East<br/>
and<br/>
West Commons and slaughter orc pawns and centurions wholesale.  They<br/>
improve<br/>
faction little by little, but as a necromancer some of your options<br/>
will<br/>
always be limited.  However if you follow Innoruuk you should be able<br/>
to get<br/>
anything you want in Neriak.<br/>
<br/>
	From Freeport head into the East Commonlands and then head west to<br/>
the West Commonlands.  One of the zone walls is a desert wall, stay on<br/>
it<br/>
and follow it till you get to the Befallen entrance.<br/>
