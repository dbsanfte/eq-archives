<div id="ygrps-yiv-644311983">Pet&#39;s do not help in normal duels a least on the normal servers. As for strategies you needs to dot him up and then move back and forth behind them. Basically you run by the warrior or any melee class then when he turns around you run backwards by him. This keeps him from getting any solid hits in. Then later dot him again if need be or lifetap him and you have it won. Not to mention you also have the level 24 dd spell which is good to use if you can get it off, but all you really need is to dot and run back and forth. I beat a paladin who while fighting in freeport one of the passing cleric&#39;s decided to heal him. If you do this right you should not lose.<br/>

        <br/>
        Last night, I watched a level 26 necromancer with a<br/>
        pet, get wiped off of the face of Norrath by a 24th<br/>
        level ogre warrior. I have some strategies for necro<br/>
        against caster, but how do you fight a warrior? The<br/>
        necro could not get any of his spells of as the<br/>
        warrior bashed/kicked/slashed him to death. The fight<br/>
        took a while as the necro ran around without much<br/>
        effect. End result, one dead necro, ogre at half<br/>
        health. They only thing I could think of was sic pet,<br/>
        shadow step, cast darkness, then proceed.<br/>
        <br/>
        I guess I have two questions:<br/>
        <br/>
        What strategy do you all use for necro vs warrior<br/>
        type?<br/>
        <br/>
        What strategy do you all use for necro vs caster type?<br/>
        <br/>
        I am really curious to see what everyone says to this.<br/>
        <br/>
        Thanks!<br/>
