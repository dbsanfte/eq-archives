Griffins are about the same lvl as giants but have about half the HP&#39;s, but<br/>
they hit a bit harder than giants...not really an issue with fear.  However<br/>
if you&#39;re going after uber-mobs you might as well do giants, as the loot is<br/>
infinitely better (griffs drop like 6p tops, and the occasional feather/eye)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>At 34 you should be able to solo a giant with the following strat:<br/>
<br/>
1) buff up your pet and hand him some daggers.<br/>
2) approach your target and lead off with a darkness, if resisted, send pet<br/>
to delay him and recast darkness until it sticks.  If you go down 2 bubbles<br/>
of mana and still havn&#39;t successfully darknessed...gate :)<br/>
3) invoke fear<br/>
4) apply dot&#39;s as you see fit<br/>
5) recast darkness until it sticks, make sure the giant stays darknessed<br/>
unless your pet has SOW.<br/>
6) reapply fear as needed<br/>
<br/>
As stated above, this isn&#39;t an xp generator so much as good loot, you&#39;ll be<br/>
medding for quite some time after a fight, but with the number of people<br/>
hunting HG&#39;s in the rathe mtns etc, this isn&#39;t so bad as it lets the giants<br/>
repopulate.  I&#39;ve come to find with regards to outdoor mobs, if you&#39;ve got<br/>
room to let them run, and you can stick a darkness on them...you can kill<br/>
them, sure it might take some time and effort, but nothing is safe from your<br/>
wrath :) If the creature has massive amounts of HP, sometimes it&#39;s best to<br/>
just keep them darknessed and feared, let the pet do all the damage, this<br/>
way you save on mana, and have some room to breath (if you cast all your<br/>
DOT&#39;s and the giant breaks fear/darkness before he&#39;s dead...you better have<br/>
jboots/sow and a bit of a headstart) Sometimes I keep a real low lvl<br/>
darkness mem&#39;d just for emergencies, if the mob speeds up and decides to<br/>
chase you down, the quick casting time comes in handy.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Specs can be solo&#39;d at 35 as well, they have moderate HP&#39;s and hit pretty<br/>
hard, but they only double attack with that big scythe of theirs, once<br/>
again, not a factor with fear. :)  The trick with these guys is to get them<br/>
one at a time.  The tree in Feerott is nice for this, but he&#39;s *heavily*<br/>
camped.  You can&#39;t pull solo specs reliably from oasis until about 45+ but<br/>
if you find a nice highbie who&#39;s killing time in oasis sometimes they&#39;ll<br/>
pull a single for you to play with, rather than have you pull the whole<br/>
island and have to do cleanup for you.  I know I&#39;ll always pull a single for<br/>
peeps rather than listen to the massive amounts of newbie shouts when one of<br/>
those buggers goes tearing down the beach.<br/>
<br/>
Once you hit your 40&#39;s it&#39;s trivial to do Seafuries in the OOT with the same<br/>
basic strategy.  The key to SF cycs is to pull them over to the island<br/>
between sister isle and their island.  That way when you fear them, they<br/>
stay on that island, instead of rampaging across seafury island and getting<br/>
you in deep doodoo.  The only problem with doing this before 44 and DMF is<br/>
pulling the cyc across the water can be dangerous... but there&#39;s almost<br/>
always someone in the zone that can hand you a levitate...just bring some<br/>
batwings with you and ask around.<br/>
