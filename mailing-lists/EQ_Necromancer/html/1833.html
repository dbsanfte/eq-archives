<div id="ygrps-yiv-1116933504">This may work...its from the ranger list a long time ago.....but group with someone and have them hand in items that effect the bargainers faction...just stand very close to them...and as long as you are not KOS you will find out if this still works....even if you just get a newbie to do it if they get xp and you don&#39;t i think it is a good tradeoff...just my 2 cents and hope it still works..<br/>

  Please if anyone can help me, I am VERY desperate.  I have accidentally<br/>
  messed up my factions with Dark Bargainers so that they are apprehensive.  I<br/>
  don&#39;t know how this happened, but I went from amiable to apprehensive<br/>
  without even being indifferent!!!  But anyway, is there ANY way to get<br/>
  factions higher with Dark Bargainers that anybody can think of? <br/>
<br/>
