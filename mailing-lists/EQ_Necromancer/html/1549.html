<b>Subject:</b> RE: Screaming Terror gets an overhaul! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-195500672">All I can say is... WOW... if this actually works and isn&#39;t resisted by<br/>
greens 50% of the time this is one sweet change.  Actually have something<br/>
really useful to contribute to a group.  Unfortunately I am going away on<br/>
vacation tomorrow morning so I won&#39;t have much time to play with it until<br/>
next week =(<br/>
<br/>
Also from patch msg:<br/>
<br/>
Pact of Shadow (Necromancer) now has a 12 second recast time<br/>
<br/>
Guess this is to stop people from casting it on multiple people and only<br/>
taking the damage once??  I don&#39;t know.. don&#39;t have the spell yet... soon..<br/>
but not yet =)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;From the patch message!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Screaming Terror (Necromancer) has changed. It is no longer a &quot;Run Away&quot;<br/>
Fear spell - instead the targeted creature will cower in terror until it<br/>
takes damage (similar to the Enchanter&#39;s Mesmerize spell). The Environment<br/>
limit (Dungeons only) has been removed.<br/>
<br/>
This rocks!!</div>
