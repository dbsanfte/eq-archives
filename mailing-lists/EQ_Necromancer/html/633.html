<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-797985033">Ok I am catching up on some back issues of my digest.  Damn I wish I had<br/>
more time to play letalone do email.  Anyway...<br/>
<br/>
In Lavastorm there are no undead.  Atleast none that I have ever seen.<br/>
Undead are in Najena, mainly large skeletons inside the entrance that were<br/>
green to me at 15th but still felt that they had to try to bash my head in.<br/>
 Of corse there are some dark bone skeletons and such farther in.<br/>
Lavastorm is a zone just like its name.  Everything is resistant to fire.<br/>
The Fire elementals, Fire Drakes, Fire goblins, Fire Imps, Lava Crawlers<br/>
(only can be hit by magic)  I&#39;ve never made it around to explore the other<br/>
parts of the zone.  I think I would want to get someone to cast levitate on<br/>
me before I got that brave.  Your body will be unretrievable if you fall<br/>
into the lava and die there.<br/>
<br/>
RTS is a Runed Totem Staff.<br/>
<br/>
Also I was skimming through some back digests and I could have swarn I saw<br/>
someone talk about setting up a spell page on the web to list mana and<br/>
damage for spells as well as descriptions and general locations of where<br/>
they can be purchased.  I think this would be a vey nice idea, and I would<br/>
be happy to contribute data for such a project.  My Gnome wiz is 18th and I<br/>
just got my necro to 9th,  Not to mention my 10th Druid, or 7th Bard :)<br/>
Just as an Idea, instead of working on your completely own page you might<br/>
consider trying to work with one of the more popular EQ information web<br/>
sites that are out there.  EQ&#39;Lizer comes to mind when thinking of good<br/>
spell lists. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/">http://www.gameznet.com/eq/</a><br/>
<br/>
Anyway if your looking for a list of pet commands and general help like<br/>
that.  I have a friend that has been putting useful info on his page as<br/>
well as has links to most of the major EQ based websites.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://members.door.net/enigma/EQInfo.htm">http://members.door.net/enigma/EQInfo.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always herd that your pet will heal faster if its sitting down.  I<br/>
have never really had much chance to experiment with this since my pet<br/>
usually heals up pretty quick anyway.<br/>
<br/>
If your casting 3rd rank or lower pet summoning spells.  Weapons can be<br/>
handy.  I believe it adds to their attack value.  I usually carry one rusty<br/>
weapon around with me for the next pet that I know I will need to summon.<br/>
I usually sell them for the money, but once a friend gave my pet a rusty<br/>
halbard.  My white con pet at 9th was hitting for 20 damage more often than<br/>
not.  He was taking about as well as the 10th level sk I was grouped with.<br/>
Once you get the 4th rank of pet spells I don&#39;t recomend giving your pet a<br/>
weapon.  Most pets of the 4th rank can start hitting magical cratures and<br/>
some can get double attacks if they con high.  It defets the pets better<br/>
skills to give them a weapon at these levels.  They will loose their better<br/>
attacks.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to add that I think adding a line that says &quot;You have summones<br/>
a week, average, above average, strong pet would be very nice to see<br/>
implemented in the game.  I think the Magicians would also enjoy this if it<br/>
were added to the game.<br/>

PS.  For those of you looking for a guild.  No I am not plugging mine.  But<br/>
as the Master of Recruiting for my guild I can&#39;t tell you how important I<br/>
believe it is to adventure with persons of a guild for a while before<br/>
considering joining.<br/>
1. You get to learn about the ways and tendencies of the guild you are<br/>
considering joining before your expected to live by their rules.<br/>
2.  The members of the guild get to meet you.  Not every guild just takes<br/>
members off the street.  Many of them are looking for nice solid players.<br/>
Its always best to make sure that a perticular guild will fit in with your<br/>
type of play before you consider joining.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for letting me rant :)<br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt;I would definately go to Lavastorm, and you can stay there for the next 4<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;levels, at least.  The experience is great, the loot is wonderful, there<br/>
&gt;&gt; are<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;words to be found here, and it is grossly underpopulated.  Just make sure<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;you either have a summoned dagger for your skeleton or it is level 12,<br/>
&gt;&gt; since<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;there are many magical creatures here.  It also helps to have a RTS with<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;vampiric embrace.<br/>
