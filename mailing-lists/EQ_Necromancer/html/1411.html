<b>Subject:</b> Gnome Gnecromancer - where can I bank? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-728664029">Just started a Necromancer, now L4.  Will likely hit L8 this week and be<br/>
ready (with Gather Shadows) to travel a bit if I don&#39;t choose to wander<br/>
sooner, and perhaps hook up with some Troll friends.<br/>
<br/>
So - What cities am I likely to be tolerated well enough to be able to get<br/>
to the bank and vendors?<br/>
<br/>
I know Ak&#39;Anon is fine.  Nobody outside the Mines of Malfunction likes me,<br/>
but neither do they hate me.  I&#39;ve been told that it&#39;s instant death to<br/>
get anywhere near the dwarf guards in Butcherblock, so Kaladim is out.  I<br/>
presume Kelethin and Felwithe are likewise verboten - can anyone confirm?<br/>
<br/>
On Antonica, I know I can get out of the docks in the tunnel that has the<br/>
Necro guild, and presumably sell there as well.  Can I get to the bank in<br/>
N Freeport?  Innothule is likely my first destination - can I go into<br/>
Grobb or Oggok to get bound or is E Freeport the closest place?  Will the<br/>
DE vendors in S Ro or any of the vendors in Innothule, Feerott, or Rathe<br/>
Mountains talk to me?  How about the rest of the continent?  Can I walk<br/>
into Neriak?<br/>
<br/>
Your thoughts, please.  I tried searching the archives with no luck; If<br/>
this is a FAQ, please feel free to reply directly instead of to the list,<br/>
or just point to a site with the information.  I&#39;ve looked at all the<br/>
sites linked from <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://everquest.gamestats.com/Classes.htm">http://everquest.gamestats.com/Classes.htm</a> but didn&#39;t<br/>
see any specific data listed.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks much! <br/>
