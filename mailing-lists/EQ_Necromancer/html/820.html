<b>Subject:</b> Re: Where to hunt at 12? Answer <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1820548741">heck, i hate n ro.  i went from L11 to (so far) 14 just from grouping in S <br/>
ro.  i am now a total group convert.  if you can get one or more people in a <br/>
group, it relieves so much of the burdens you have playing solo.  and it is <br/>
really a more effective use of your time.<br/>
for example, at L14 i can kill a L16 ghoul, or a L15 or so Dry Bone Skel if <br/>
i have a good pet, but i will be in VERY bad condition after the fight (low <br/>
mana, low hp).  now with a good group, it would get killed faster, everyone <br/>
would be hurt less, and i wouldnt be out of mana (most important).  and if <br/>
something else attacked us during the fight, great! its extra experience, <br/>
not run for the zone and pray.<br/>

&gt;Oasis ==&gt; Start with caimans, then crocs, then deep water caimans, and <br/>
&gt;finally deep water crocs this should take you to 21 lvl. </span></blockquote></div>
