<b>Subject:</b> Hunting at 26 and looking to hit 29th fast..... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-216360171">What else can I hunt solo to go from 26-29 fast ? I am now hunting the Millers in the Hills: very good exp and loot but it is a pain in the butt to keep their spawn apart and they rip my pet big time..... Is the new darkness and heat blood at 29th that much better??</div>
