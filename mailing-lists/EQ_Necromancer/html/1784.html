You hit the nail right on the head, when it comes to meleeing.<br/>
<br/>
When I fight, I typically open the battle with Darkness, then send the pet<br/>
in.  I DoT the mob again, then take a quick assessment of my pet&#39;s health.<br/>
Typically, I immediately step in to melee the mob on the OPPOSITE side of my<br/>
pet.  In other words, I step in from behind and make the mob do a 180 to<br/>
have to hit me.  I try to have Vampiric Embrace on while doing this so that<br/>
I get a free lifetap or two in.<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s a high yellow mob I usually always need to fear it in order for my<br/>
pet and I to live (and win).<br/>
<br/>
Using this method I&#39;m able to solo high yellow mobs (and the occasional low<br/>
red, as long as fear and darkness stick).<br/>

&gt; I buffed my pet a few times this way, and did notice that he hit for more<br/>
&gt; damage.  The problem that I have with the spells are that they<br/>
&gt; take strength<br/>
&gt; away from you.  My outtings last a very long time before I go back to town<br/>
&gt; and sell, so weight was a huge factor only having a str of 65, so when you<br/>
&gt; take away 10, I would become encumbered and lose some agi as<br/>
&gt; well, so I quit<br/>
&gt; using the spell.  You are probably meleeing at this level too, so<br/>
&gt; if you did<br/>
&gt; want to use this spell, use siphon strength with it so that you<br/>
&gt; are back up<br/>
&gt; to your potential, but that takes 2 spells slots away from a lot of other<br/>
&gt; more useful spells.<br/>
