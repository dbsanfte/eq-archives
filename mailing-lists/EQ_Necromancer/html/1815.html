&gt; Hi folks,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am very rapidly approaching level 16 (about 2 bubbles away.....I&#39;ll get<br/>
&gt; there as soon as I get home from work today :) ), and am wondering about<br/>
&gt; Research.  I would very much like to do all or most of my own research.<br/>
&gt; However, I also play a level 22 Wiz who has NEVER been able to<br/>
successfully<br/>
&gt; research ANYTHING.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Is there any way to practice your research without having to use the<br/>
actual<br/>
&gt; words that we come across?  It seems like they are pretty hard to find (my<br/>
&gt; Wizard finds runes all the time, but they are rarely the ones he needs).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway, I&#39;m looking for any and all advice as to the best way of raising<br/>
&gt; your research skill.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks in advance,<br/>
