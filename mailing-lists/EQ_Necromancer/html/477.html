<div id="ygrps-yiv-936672265">The level one pet spell is fairly useless. Basically you&#39;re summoning a decaying skeleton, and you know how easily they die, right? Push on to level 4 and you&#39;ll find your new pet much more useful.<br/>

&gt;So I have a problem,  every pet I have summoned has been L1!  I made it to<br/>
&gt;level 2 yesterday and I summoned 13 skeletons thus far and every single one<br/>
&gt;was L1 (coned black while I was 1 and blue while I was 2)<br/>
&gt;I read several places that at low lvls we should be able to summon a pet<br/>
&gt;that could be above our lvl, I&#39;d be happy w/ a Skel that WAS my lvl.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Does it matter what type of bone chips are used to summon????<br/>
