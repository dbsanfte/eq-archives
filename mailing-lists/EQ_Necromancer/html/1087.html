<br/>
 </span></blockquote>well... it seems to happen more when the DOT has not been on the target for <br/>
very long (which is more likely to happen in a group...)  but he cast the <br/>
spells on his target late... so the DOT&#39;s were still relatively new...<br/>
<br/>
Just a guess :)<br/>
<br/>
I had an enchanter in a group once in Nejena, charm the pets of the mages.... <br/>
as soon as the charm on the charmed pets ended, they suicided... so maybe the <br/>
pet was no longer his as was guessed...  but I am not sure at this time <br/>
weather we can blame the pet, or the DOT bug.  (especially with just one <br/>
occurrence)<br/>
<br/>
One other reason is screaming terror... if the pet really was no longer <br/>
his... why did it attack the NPC again...  screaming terror would make it <br/>
forget it was mad at the NPC and not attack the NPC to defend its master...  <br/>
it would attack again if it was defending its master, not if it had no <br/>
master...<br/>
<br/>
Of coarse most of this is just hypothesis :)  But none of us really know what <br/>
happened.<br/>
