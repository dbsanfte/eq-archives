<div id="ygrps-yiv-470421636">The dwarves in oot can be pulled 1 at a time and are good exp if you fight<br/>
them by yourself, but lately it seems as though this is a very popular area<br/>
so I decided to leave and go elsewhere (still looking too at 32nd)∩┐╜ I<br/>
started fighting the dwarves at 28th and worked on them off and on to 32nd.∩┐╜<br/>
I&#39;m currently in Kithcor killing undead but would love to kill the little<br/>
halfling guards at the wall in misty thickett, just a matter of dividing and<br/>
conquering : )<br/>
