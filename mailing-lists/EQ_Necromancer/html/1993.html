  my first thought to was try on yourself but if you aren&#39;t the adventurist <br/>
type you can watch your spells.  You will get a message &quot;mob blood begins to <br/>
boil&quot;  or you&#39;ll get a message saying&quot; your spell does not take hold&quot; .   <br/>
Usually  the spells will stack as long as not the same type IE clinging <br/>
darkness will not stack with engulfing darkness .   As with every rule there <br/>
are exceptions IE if rooted you cant get darkness to stick .. you&#39;ll see <br/>
message &quot;your spell does not take hold&quot; .<br/>
<br/>
 It just takes some practice and depends on which casters your grouping with <br/>
on what spells you can use, Especialy with other necros, who are spells do <br/>
not stack with very well. <br/>
