<div id="ygrps-yiv-685257732">Hello,<br/>
I&#39;m a DE Necro who is frustrated with the 9th level. I&#39;ve died and lost it 4<br/>
times now and can&#39;t seem to get above one bubble of exp before I lose it.<br/>
Hunting<br/>
in the forest seems to be worthless, only an occasional skeleton gives me any<br/>
exp (or a kodiak if I can find one), the haflings eat me for lunch. I&#39;ve been<br/>
to<br/>
east commons a few times but I die as much as I make experience. Befallen<br/>
seems to be too hard (and I die) or too easy (and no exp). Am I doing<br/>
something wrong? Should I be hunting elsewhere? I&#39;ve about had it with my<br/>
necro character, I&#39;ve recently started a human mage in Freeport (eech) and<br/>
he&#39;s having a much easier time. I don&#39;t mind slow going but I like to see some<br/>
character advancement.<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions? Any help? I&#39;m about to give up..</div>
