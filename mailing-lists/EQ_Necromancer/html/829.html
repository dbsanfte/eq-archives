When you first enter the forest from east commons ... there is a guard that <br/>
wanders right to the edge of the chasm that is the zone...  if you wait until <br/>
he comes by that direction you can con him...  he is not a real high level <br/>
guard... but still tough enough...  his CON should be what you get throughout <br/>
Neriak.<br/>
<br/>
Remember to cast invis to undead though since the ghouls guarding the necro <br/>
guild will always hate you.<br/>
