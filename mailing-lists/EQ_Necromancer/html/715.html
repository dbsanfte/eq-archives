<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-720261577">Here are the pros and cons that I know of so far.<br/>
<br/>
I play a dark elf necromancer, so I&#39;ll start there.<br/>
Pros:<br/>
<br/>
1) Everything in Neriak is amiable to me.<br/>
2) I&#39;m welcomed in Grobb and Ogguk.<br/>
3) I&#39;m not kos in Freeport and I raised my faction so everything there is<br/>
amiable to me as well (with the exception of the guards in north Freeport).<br/>
4) The nightvision is truly something to see, if you think dwarves and elves<br/>
can see in the dark, then you&#39;ve never seen real nightvision.<br/>
<br/>
Cons:<br/>
<br/>
1) Lots of racial hatred.  I get insults all the time, but at least they&#39;re<br/>
too afraid to duel me constantly so I can get some peace.<br/>
2) I can&#39;t figure out how to get faction in Felwithe and Kelethin without<br/>
hurting my faction with my own race.<br/>
3) Until you do some faction adjustment, you are kos in most places.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the stuff I know,<br/>

&gt;gnomish necromancer? or a dark elf necromancer?<br/>
&gt;I would appreciates anyone&#39;s input on this subject.<br/>
&gt;Thanks<br/>
