Not only will the beasties try to do you in, but many of the NPC farmers<br/>
will chase after you.  I finally just said screwit and waited until I hit<br/>
8th so I would have the benefit of gather shadows.  The way I went from 7th<br/>
to 8 rather quickly was basically soloing blackburrow.  There&#39;s so many<br/>
people in there it can be difficult to actually get a kill, but this also<br/>
works for you in that trains are pretty rare now, and when there is one,<br/>
there are many targets for them to focus on, allowing a hasty retreat.<br/>

&gt; That&#39;s *exactly* the reason I started Kagon, and haven&#39;t played my<br/>
&gt; ranger since (except once, I feel kinda ..guilty and stuff..). I read<br/>
&gt; your post and was mildly concerned since I was nearing 7 myself. Well,<br/>
&gt; when I hit 7 last night...there was barely anything to fight! Ok, I<br/>
&gt; may be overexagerating, but kodiak&#39;s were still yellow (I got<br/>
&gt; slaughtered by one, thinking I was smart, but I was just<br/>
&gt; ill-prepared), and now almost all black bears and shadow wolves are<br/>
&gt; green. The only whites I saw the rest of the night was a tree snake<br/>
&gt; and a skel near the ruins, which are camped like mad anyway. I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; thinking of taking a trip over to the Freeport area, maybe more stuff<br/>
&gt; over there? Personally, I think Kagon would enjoy flaying a halfling<br/>
&gt; or two, but the 2 locations he has been to so far are not suitable<br/>
&gt; yet. =P *shudders at the memory of being burned to death by 3 halfling<br/>
&gt; spellcasters and bludgeoned by 4 skels at the same time*<br/>
&gt; Good luck!<br/>

&gt; Thanks to all for the responses.   I&#39;m looking forward to playing and<br/>
&gt; getting to 8 and above.   It&#39;s funny, I started this Necromancer just<br/>
&gt; on a whim when I got a little bored with my Ranger and I haven&#39;t<br/>
&gt; played<br/>
&gt; my Ranger since.   My friends in Kelethin are not pleased...<br/>
