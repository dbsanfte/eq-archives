<div id="ygrps-yiv-164130707">&#39;fraid you wont find much around Qeynos.  The best thing for you to do<br/>
is make a trek to Freeport.  That&#39;s undead haven there, I swear.  You&#39;ve got<br/>
numerous little ruins outside, plus Befallen (watch out for horrible trains<br/>
& that damn Ghoul & Ice Boned) you can put that Ward Undead to use.  Beware<br/>
of fizzles, however.<br/>
<br/>
    As for around Qeynos.. eh.. Karanas is the best place.  Just kill the<br/>
grizzlies and spidies.  It&#39;ll take longer, but you&#39;re almost guranteed the<br/>
experiance from them so long as you&#39;re not double timed.  Just remember to<br/>
smack &#39;em with poisen, maybe Clinging Darkness and/or Fear, and leave enough<br/>
mana for a Mend Bones or Gate. :-)  You&#39;re not going to get much more around<br/>
Qeynos.  I left the place at level 10 for Freeport, got 56 gold in three<br/>
days there, a greater light stone, two magical (Cut-Throat Insignia)<br/>
rings..... and lost level 10. *grin*  Even the Orc Centurian around the<br/>
entrance to the city of Freeport carries leggings at times, which you can<br/>
sell for gold.<br/>
<br/>
    Freeport is nice, but very dangerous.  Those damn young kodiaks hate you<br/>
and will attack you on sight.  They&#39;re pretty tough at this level,<br/>
especially with a giant spider or two in tow.  Both of which roam around the<br/>
immediate area of Freeport, one zone from the city.  Good exp, just watch<br/>
your back.  Also, just because a zombie /con`s blue doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s an<br/>
easy kill.  I made it out of a fight against two of those with a sliver of<br/>
mana and life.  Granted, I had no pet at the time, but geeze they hurt.<br/>
<br/>
    Ghouls and the Ice Boned Skeleton takes magical weapons & spells to hurt<br/>
it.  Your ward undead can kill it the Ice Boned if somebody else is<br/>
distracting it so you can get all of them off, but not face-to-face as it<br/>
will stun you repeatedly.  Ward Undead on the Ghoul is a waste of mana.<br/>
It&#39;ll resist virtually every one of them.  Don&#39;t -- Fight -- The -- Ghoul<br/>
:-)<br/>
<br/>
    Also, the desert is a great place.  The Giant Scarab Beetles are very<br/>
easy kills -- I can sit and meditate while my skeleton beats the snot out of<br/>
them (just remember to poisen them & keep a watch on your skelly&#39;s life) --<br/>
and gives okay experiance.  Zombies roam the desert, as well as skeletons.<br/>
/con _everything_ first, especially the skeletons.  Many of them will /con<br/>
red to you.<br/>
<br/>
    Good luck.  Qeynos at level 10 is incredibly boring...<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Can anyone give some recommendations about  where to go on 10th lvl, as a<br/>
&gt; human necro in qeynos?<br/>
&gt; For the last 3 levels i&#39;ve been in west karana, and i&#39;m looking for better<br/>
&gt; places to hunt, as the xp and the loot i get in karana<br/>
&gt; from the creatures i can handle there ( mostly giant spiders, giant<br/>
&gt; beetles,lions , the occasional grizzly ) , is quite bad.<br/>
&gt; &gt;From the times i&#39;ve been to black burrow, it looks that place is just<br/>
&gt; impossible, because of all of the people that hang around there all of the<br/>
&gt; time, pulling train after train..<br/>
&gt; Is there any undead hunting site near qeynos, besides the ruins in the<br/>
&gt; hills? I realy want to put my ward-undead to use..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; death to all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Trenzorian/Tunare<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If we aren&#39;t supposed to eat animals , why are they made of meat?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
