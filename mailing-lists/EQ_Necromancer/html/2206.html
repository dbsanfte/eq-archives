but not profitable.<br/>

Fortunately, I hate soloing.  I was able to do well with partners up to<br/>
full groups in Warsliks Woods (goblin ruins, outside of giant fort, and<br/>
the tunnel to Dalnir) and Lake of Ill Omen (goblin and sarnak groups) at<br/>
L22-29, then move into Overthere.<br/>
<br/>
MistMoore courtyard and various rooms in Unrest are good in the low 20s,<br/>
and upper Guk is fabulous if you have a group, but you&#39;ll never find a<br/>
pickup group there.<br/>
<br/>
People say good things about sisters in OOT, but I never used them.<br/>
You&#39;re still in a good range for OOT gargoyles and aviaks though.<br/>
