<div id="ygrps-yiv-1673019132">Well... I had different experiences with Spectres.  I solo&#39;d the one on the<br/>
hill in Feerott at 32nd level quite easily.  The only problem is finding it<br/>
uncamped. If you&#39;re lucky, a group of high levels might be there pulling the<br/>
cave and all.  While this sounds like an unfortunate situation, I was able<br/>
to convince them to let me have the lone hill spawn a few times (since they<br/>
had the entire cave).  As for strategy, I think Spectres are one of the most<br/>
susceptible mobs in the game to Darkness... which makes them totally pud.  I<br/>
didn&#39;t use my pet, but it was also before the kiting patch.  I suppose a<br/>
darkness + fear + pet would work pretty well.  I found that they didn&#39;t root<br/>
very well, tho.  Especially with the undead root.. so beware of that.  Oh..<br/>
another tip.. if you do root with the undead root, sometimes you can&#39;t use<br/>
the other normal root right afterwards (it says &#39;Your spell did not take<br/>
hold&#39;).  I think it is some kind of bug with the undead one.. thinking that<br/>
the mob is still rooted with a higher level root (since that one is a 16th<br/>
level including damage and the other one is a 4th level wizzie root).<br/>

&gt; I would not solo specs until you are at least 2 shades of blue over them.<br/>
&gt; They are mean critters, and if your first darkness/fear spell does not<br/>
&gt; stick, you may not get another chance.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You are far better off soloing Vhalen at the well in SK.<br/>
