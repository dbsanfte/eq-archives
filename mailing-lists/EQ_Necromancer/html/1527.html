<div id="ygrps-yiv-1655259952">:)  This would be hard!  You should also have a bard in the group to play mana song.<br/>
Also an enchanter to tashani, and stun if it isn&#39;t resisted.  You would also have to<br/>
have plenty of FS daggers and a mage to summon his dagger since a pet can&#39;t duel wield<br/>
two weapons of the same kind.<br/>

&gt; Actually, they capped the LT at about 5-6 levels above you. Since Vox/Naggy<br/>
&gt; are &quot;Officially&quot; lv 53, a necro would have no problem sucking them dry.  In<br/>
&gt; fact, I have a theory about this.  Get 6 lv 50 Necro&#39;s with pets, and 6 lv<br/>
&gt; 50 clerics, and once the giants are taken care of, I think with the clerics<br/>
&gt; healing the pets (I&#39;d give them some nice, cheap, fast weapons,<br/>
&gt; bloodclaw&#39;s.. etc) the dragons could be taken with only a few deaths.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; This list is basically unmoderated.  However abusive language will not be tolerated<br/>
