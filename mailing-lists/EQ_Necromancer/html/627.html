<div id="ygrps-yiv-1563853491">I have seen it in LF, and that was a while ago, but a Ranger was w/ me in<br/>
lesser fay and the Named Wasp came up on his tracking, so I suspect that it<br/>
only spawns every X hours real time and when it does it is probably killed<br/>
FAST by any &quot;trackers&quot; in the area, becuase they will be aware of its<br/>
presence long before people who rely on sight.<br/>
<br/>
P.S. What are the stats on the magic dagger you bought?   Is it possible to<br/>
get it at 12th lvl ish?<br/>

&gt; i just bought the dagger of marnek =)  hehe, im so happy about it.  as a<br/>
&gt; main weapon im still using a giant snake fang tho, since the dagger is<br/>
&gt; mainly good for the bonuses (and, of course, if i need a magic weapon).<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; great thing about it is i can keep it in a thrown slot.  im pretty sure i<br/>
&gt; got a really great deal on it too (25pp)<br/>
&gt; has anyone run across a crook stinger?  i spent a week (real time) in<br/>
lesser<br/>
&gt; faydark looking for a damn named wasp, but didnt find him.  in fact, a few<br/>
&gt; druids/rangers said they have been looking for it since after beta, and<br/>
&gt; still havent seen it.  perhaps it&#39;s gone?<br/>

&gt; &gt;Ok I like to keep up on al my weapon skills so I am maxed out in 1hb and<br/>
&gt; &gt;2hb<br/>
&gt; &gt;and pircing. Now that I am level 13 what do I get for a good weapon. I am<br/>
&gt; &gt;told a totem staff is good. But its seem slow to me. If you could tell me<br/>
&gt; &gt;what you sugets and where I an get the weapon of your choice I would be<br/>
&gt; &gt;thanksfull.<br/>
