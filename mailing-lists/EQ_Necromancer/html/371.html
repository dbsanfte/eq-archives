    I&#39;ve been toying with the possibility as well, but I&#39;m waiting on a couple things first.<br/>
     <br/>
    A)  DoT spells are illegal.  Actually anywhere where you can kill your opponent indirectly (like ROOTing someone underwater) is illegal because they don&#39;t classify that damage or something.  What does this mean?  A necromancer is virtually castrated.  NO DoT means no Darkness Spells, No Blood, Bo Heart Flutter, etc.  Its sucks really bad.<br/>
     <br/>
    B) Faction on inter-racial PKing.  Basically this is player enforced.  You get a bad mark on your through players only but often this doesn&#39;t mean anything.<br/>
     <br/>
    <br/>
    Some things I&#39;ve noticed or heard about.  Essentially the only place you are mostly safe is your own newbie area outside home, even then not much.  But in most open areas there&#39;s mostly an unspoken peace.  It is NOT the nightmare ambush world a lot of people are afraid of where you can&#39;t rest anywhere or anything.  Its bad sometimes, but for the most part you&#39;ll just see people giving each other a WIDE berth, with some groups of vigilantes running around.  Things are definitely more exciting, and advancing in the higher teens is often more difficult simply because your access to other areas is somewhat more difficult.  This is mostly on Antonica though.  If you start in Faydwer there&#39;s this nasty stuff going on between the Gnomes and Elves, but for the most part you are as safe as in nonPvP.  Erud is still as crappy as it ever is.  Most of the cool PvP stuff happens on Antonica.  It gnaws at me more and more to try out Rallos Zek, but I don&#39;t want to do it till they fix DoT spells and other assorted screwups.<br/>

        Does anyone play on Rallos Zek?  I was thinking of starting a character there, but I have heard both positive and negative things about the server.  Does it differ a lot from the regular servers, besides anyone can kill you within 4 levels?  Do you still have the evil races grouping with the good races or do they tend to group among their own race?  How is the rampant Pk situation, human killing other humans etc..??  Sorry for all the questions but I&#39;m getting bored with fighting NPCs on E&#39;ci and I think being able to fight the goodie goodies would spice it up a lot.  <br/>
        <br/>
        I was also thinking of joining a guild and participating in guildwars but I haven&#39;t heard of any guilds doing that and what I see, all the guilds are letting every race/class in.  Which, IMHO isn&#39;t RP at all.  Even if the &quot;evil&quot; character claims that he has turned good.<br/>
