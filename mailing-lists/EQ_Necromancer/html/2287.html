&gt; Greetings. My colleague and I are making a documentary about the<br/>
&gt; phenomenon of Everquest. We have have become fascinated with all<br/>
&gt; aspects of the game. The role-playing, the building up of characters,<br/>
&gt; the economy of the game, the way people interact online, etc... We<br/>
&gt; hope to explore all these areas of the game by interviewing players,<br/>
&gt; spouses, children, parents and even the EQ developers.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We plan on shooting over the next couple of months. We live in Los<br/>
&gt; Angeles and are prepared to travel around the country to conduct our<br/>
&gt; interviews.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If interested, pease reply to our email eqdocfilm&lt;at&gt;yahoo&lt;dot&gt;com<br/>
&gt; and provide us with your age and location (city/state), level and<br/>
&gt; guild affiliation, and how long you&#39;ve been playing the game.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Regards,<br/>
&gt; Nina and Andy<br/>
