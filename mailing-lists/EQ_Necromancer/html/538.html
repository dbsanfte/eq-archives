 It is not a bug...<br/>
 <br/>
 It is intentional<br/>
 <br/>
 From level 12 and up... the pets range fromn 4 levels bellow you to the <br/>
spell <br/>
 level...<br/>
 <br/>
 so that is 8 to 12, the next is 12 to 16 (the spell I currently have) etc.<br/>
 <br/>
 Supposedly a game balance thing :(<br/>

I disagree.  I can summon at least 5 different levels of pets with my 12th <br/>
level summon pet spell....I am a 14th rank necromancer.  I summon (green) <br/>
skellies that start at doing 10 points of damage, (green) skellies that do 12 <br/>
points of damage, (blue) skellies that do 14 points, (blue) skellies that do <br/>
16 points, and finally (blue) skellies that do 18 points of damage per main <br/>
attack.  If I remember correctly, they all can bash attack as well though not <br/>
as well for the weaker skellies.  I know the tougher skellies can hit ghouls <br/>
(which require a magical attack).  I haven&#39;t tried attacking a ghoul with a <br/>
weak skellie as I don&#39;t wanna chance fate....Ghouls frezy too easily when you <br/>
keep striking them with ward undead.  <br/>
<br/>
On a separate question, will lull undead keep the undead target from <br/>
frenzying as yo cast ward undead on them from a distance?  I haven&#39;t used <br/>
lull at all yet and was wondering what others think about the spell&#39;s use...<br/>
