&lt;&lt; I was planning a trip to Unrest tonight and was wondering if anyone had<br/>
 any info on it that may be useful. Is it decent for a lvl 23 to solo? I<br/>
 heard that there&#39;s usually alot of people there, so the risk of getting hit<br/>
 by more than one MOB is low. Also, is there anywhere in Faydwer for a DE to<br/>
 sell? As an outcast I was pretty sure there wasn&#39;t..... &gt;&gt;<br/>

Unrest is not a solo spot you&#39;ll do alot better getting in a group.....as for <br/>
selling try the druid ring in BB near the crossroads (hard to find  you may <br/>
want to look at a map first )&gt;     No where to bank though so 2 days is max I <br/>
could stay without heading home to neriak.<br/>
