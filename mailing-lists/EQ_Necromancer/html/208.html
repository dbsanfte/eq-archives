<div id="ygrps-yiv-188412156">I&#39;ll just paste the last few spell-list updates from the .txt files.<br/>
Some of you folks may have other spell-caster types.  I&#39;ll just say, I&#39;m<br/>
rather disapointed that Umbral Messenger was removed.  I was somewhat<br/>
looking forward to that.  Ah wells, besides that, pets respond to commands<br/>
at double the distance of before now, as it states.  I post this for future<br/>
reference, and, you&#39;d be surprised how many people are not aware of the<br/>
manual.* files.  Here you go folks:<br/>
<br/>
==========<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Recent Spell Changes<br/>
<br/>
Sentinel (Enchanter Spell) - the duration has been increased.<br/>
<br/>
Minor Illusion (Enchanter Spell) - a maximum size has been placed on objects<br/>
that your illusion will copy.<br/>
<br/>
Melanie&#39;s Mellifluous Motion (Bard) - this song will now effect your entire<br/>
party, not just you.<br/>
<br/>
Divine Barrier (Cleric) - This spell will no longer reverse your movement<br/>
commands.<br/>
<br/>
The range at which a pet will respond to your commands has been doubled.<br/>
**********<br/>
<br/>
Misty Gate (Druid) has been added to the appropriate Druid Vendor.<br/>
<br/>
The Clinging Darkness Series (Necromancer) will last longer on targets.<br/>
**********<br/>
<br/>
Shadow Knights have had two changes made to their spell list.  The 39th<br/>
level Banshee Aura has been<br/>
changed to Shield Skin, and the 49th level Boil Blood has been replaced with<br/>
Dooming Darkness.<br/>
<br/>
The recasting time on many Enchanter spells has been reduced.<br/>
<br/>
Research components - the % frequency of research components found in the<br/>
game has been increased by<br/>
300%.<br/>
<br/>
Vampiric Embrace (Necromancer and Shadow Knight) - Once cast, this spell<br/>
gives you a chance of<br/>
draining HP from your target every time you attack.  Formally, this spell<br/>
added to your attack roll.  *********<br/>
<br/>
==========<br/>
<br/>
    I&#39;m wondering if I waisted my three plat on V.Embrace.  It doesn&#39;t last<br/>
long and this doesn&#39;t say anything about it being usable with weapons as I&#39;d<br/>
heard in-game.<br/>
