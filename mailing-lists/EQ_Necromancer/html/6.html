<div id="ygrps-yiv-1981442927">OK I undersand that but how does it come into play? You cast it on yourself so how do<br/>
you damage the undead? By striking them?  Explain how you use it please.  And one other<br/>
thing; Being a Gnome I bought my key L8 spells from Merchants in my guild area.  I paid<br/>
4.5 P ea for Lessor Shielding, Bone Walk, and Vampiric Embrace.  Is this normal? Man<br/>
took all the $ I had.<br/>

&gt;     I hear it does 38(+1/level) dam to undead.  In other words, a base<br/>
&gt; damage of 38, and + 1 for each level after eight. Say,  you get 40 dam to<br/>
&gt; undead once you reach 10th level. Something like that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     That may not be 100% correct, but it&#39;s what I&#39;ve been told at least.<br/>
&gt; And it is doing 38pts of dam for me at level eight at the moment. Nice<br/>
&gt; spell.  Looking forward to Dominate Undead.  Going to have fun with some<br/>
&gt; Dreads....Just have a long way to go.<br/>

&gt; &gt; What does that spell do?  How does it work as you cast it on yourself,<br/>
&gt; &gt; but no icon shows like aura, unless it replaces it?  Play on Povar, a<br/>
&gt; &gt; Gnome, and need some player friends.<br/>
