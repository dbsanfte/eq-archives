 </span></blockquote>What will probably happen if you write it to your spell book, is that you <br/>
will get shadow vortex in your book (I had umbral messenger scroll from <br/>
before they made the change, they made the change then I got 20th level, <br/>
scribed umbral messenger, and got shadow vortex.  If you already have shadow <br/>
vortex it will tell you you already have that spell so can&#39;t scribe it.<br/>
