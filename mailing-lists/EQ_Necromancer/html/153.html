<div id="ygrps-yiv-256586873">Actually you have a much better chance of finding words and such on NPC<br/>
spell casters..or as he said, Intelligent critters...I have found many words<br/>
on fire elementals and lava crawlers, which are both spell casters (well<br/>
fight mainly but they cast spells too).<br/>

&gt; Re: Anyone know what language a lot of those books that have spell<br/>
recipies<br/>
&gt; are in? Is it High Erudian? Anyone know of any monsters that give words<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; so forth??<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The books are all different languages.  Each one a different one.  So ...<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; will need to learn them all.  There seem to be Old Erudian, Ancient<br/>
Elvish,<br/>
&gt; Elder Tir&#39;Dal.  There is also Lizardman and Gnoll.  I have 4 books, and it<br/>
&gt; looks like each is a different language.  I believe that my first one is<br/>
&gt; Ancient Eleven ... only because I am average in this skill, and I can<br/>
almost<br/>
&gt; make it out.  (I am A Dark Elf Necro)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And I have found words/runes on Orc, Fungi Men, Frogloks, and Goblins.<br/>
They<br/>
&gt; tend to be on the &quot;intelligent&quot; critters.  Randomly.<br/>
