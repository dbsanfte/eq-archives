<b>Subject:</b> question about guild and research <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1493119948">I found the guild in Freeport, but I read somewhere that somewhere under the docks is an entrance, can anyone confirm this?<br/>
<br/>
Also, where can I buy books to tell me recipes for making spells?  Can I buy them from my guild in Necro guild in freeport?</div>
