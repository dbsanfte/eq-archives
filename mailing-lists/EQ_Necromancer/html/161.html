<div id="ygrps-yiv-1101915343">Once again, all this talk is making me want to go back to my necro. But <br/>
recently I got full banded for my Troll Warrior. He is only level 8. Has full <br/>
banded and a tunic that has same AC as a 1200 plat plate tunic. Very <br/>
interesting and cool. I can solo reds because of my armor. That is way to <br/>
good to pass up. Maybe at another time my necromancer will once again feed <br/>
off the skels of Nektulos Forrest.<br/>
