<div id="ygrps-yiv-1433719492">Hey Kaz,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the interesting info on EQ.  After getting a small taste of RvR<br/>
its lead to something more akin to bloodlust! hehe.  EQ is simply not a game<br/>
that I think that I could go back to. Many of the features that you&#39;ve<br/>
mentioned sound like they&#39;re getting their act together, but good bit of<br/>
those features are already present in DAoC.<br/>
<br/>
The dungeon design in EQ was really good. I did like that about the game.  I<br/>
left EQ due to a REALLY high frustration level with it.  While some of it<br/>
was the game mechanics and the poor attitude that Verant had with customers,<br/>
and the jerks that ran around (all games have them) I just decided it simply<br/>
was not worth my time anymore to play.  I have some friends who I see quite<br/>
often that still love the game and have the uber level 60 characters with<br/>
all the goodies, but when it comes down to it, I just prefer DAoC.  I played<br/>
EQ since BETA and thought it was great. I still think its a great game. Its<br/>
just a great game thats not for me.  I&#39;ll re-evaluate that when EQ2 is out.<br/>
<br/>
I just enjoy the RvR aspect of DAoC too much.   I never understood why a<br/>
Highelf would group with a character that was supposed to be his sworn<br/>
enemy. Anyhoo, I&#39;ll give EQ2 a try, but until then I am a DAoC player...well<br/>
ok, I&#39;ll play Planetside as well. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for all the interesting info its really good to know that Sony<br/>
is catering to the customers. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure, but would my characters still be there if I decided to try the<br/>
free 30thing? Would I still have my stuff too?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

&gt; &gt; I play DAoC. I quit EQ well over a year ago.  Personally, I REALLY<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You should log into EQ and see how much it&#39;s changed in the last<br/>
&gt; year.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The interface has gone from one of the worst in online gaming to one<br/>
&gt; of the best. Windows can be transparent, you can move them and<br/>
&gt; configure them easily, you can have multiple chat windows and<br/>
&gt; configure them to each serve specific purposes. Pets no longer take<br/>
&gt; experience, even if they do the kill alone. You can quickly and<br/>
&gt; easily get around if you have Planes of Power, as there are Plane of<br/>
&gt; Knowledge teleport books in every semi-civilized zone. There are<br/>
&gt; soulbinders, so no hunting for someone to bind you in a new zone.<br/>
&gt; Raids can now share experience cross-groups. Actually, the number of<br/>
&gt; changes is so huge that I can&#39;t even begin to think of everything.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Oh, and I think the hot spell of the day is only a year old or<br/>
&gt; so...it&#39;s called Kodiak&#39;s Endless Intellect, or KEI, and it gives<br/>
&gt; you sixteen mana per tick plus like 30 INT and WIS. A lower-level<br/>
&gt; character cannot run out of mana, a mid level character never faces<br/>
&gt; downtime at all if he&#39;s careful, even soloing, and an uber character<br/>
&gt; has his downtime cut to a fraction, or none if in an effective group.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I dunno if KEI was around more than a year ago, but nowadays there<br/>
&gt; is /always/ someone casting it for donations in Nexus, so it&#39;s at<br/>
&gt; least gone from nearly unknown to something anyone can get with a<br/>
&gt; little effort...and it lasts over two hours.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What&#39;s more, with the all-download expansion (Legacy of Ykesha)<br/>
&gt; coming out in a few weeks, you can be a Frogluk, you have SIXTEEN<br/>
&gt; slots in the bank, there is an automatic (and a manual) mapping<br/>
&gt; system, you can dye armor SLOTS so that any armor put in it will be<br/>
&gt; the color you like to wear. There is a new item slot called Charms,<br/>
&gt; and a charm is a special kind of magic item which changes according<br/>
&gt; to circumstances, like growing more powerful for each of a certain<br/>
&gt; kind of armor you wear (like gaining HP for each piece of plate you<br/>
&gt; equip), or other things like growing more powerful the more PP you<br/>
&gt; are carrying.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Lee&#39;s see...you were around for Luclin, which probably is what drove<br/>
&gt; you away, but they fixed every single bug from back then. Zoning is<br/>
&gt; faster, and messages are never lost during zone, they queue up and<br/>
&gt; you see them after you get through.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; They&#39;ve put out two stable, very useful expansions in just four<br/>
&gt; months, too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In effect, once Verant ceased to exist and it became officially<br/>
&gt; Sony, it seems they got ten times the development quality and funds,<br/>
&gt; and it&#39;s gone from an annoying game to being as good as anything out<br/>
&gt; there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But for the coming expansion, the Frogluks have taken over my<br/>
&gt; original home town of Grobb, now known as Gukta, and the Trolls have<br/>
&gt; been relegated to hanging out in the foreign quarter of Neriak until<br/>
&gt; the new Troll city is built with the new expansion. That one thing<br/>
&gt; really annoys me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
