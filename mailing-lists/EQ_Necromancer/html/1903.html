<div id="ygrps-yiv-461827699">Well folks, I&#39;m far from being a professional comedian, but I was bored at<br/>
work today so I came up with the following.  Enjoy :)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Top 10 signs you&#39;ve played a Dark Elf Necromancer too long:<br/>
<br/>
10.  You wish you could cast &quot;Darkness&quot; on people passing you on the<br/>
freeway.<br/>
<br/>
9.  When a colleague asks for your assistance, you respond with &quot;Embrace the<br/>
hatred of Innoruuk and we shall discuss it,  worthless human!&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
8.  You begin to have a strange appreciation for neon signs.<br/>
<br/>
7.  You&#39;ve been caught trying to Lifetap the neighbor&#39;s cat for extra<br/>
energy.<br/>
<br/>
6.  You start buying all of your meat with the &quot;bone in&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
5.  There isn&#39;t a single candle in your house during storm season.<br/>
<br/>
4.  You start worrying that you don&#39;t have good enough faction to enter<br/>
McDonald&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
3.  Whenever a policeman pulls in behind you, you seriously consider<br/>
&quot;fearing&quot; him.<br/>
<br/>
2.  You get the terms &quot;Cemetery&quot; and &quot;Candy Store&quot; confused all the time.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And the number 1 sign you&#39;ve played a Dark Elf Necromancer for WAY too long<br/>
is:<br/>
*<br/>
*<br/>
*<br/>
*<br/>
*<br/>
*<br/>
*<br/>
*<br/>
*<br/>
*<br/>
*<br/>
*<br/>
*<br/>
*<br/>
1.	You can&#39;t walk past your boss without yelling &quot;/PET ATTACK!   /PET<br/>
ATTACK!&quot;<br/>
