<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1553152873">There are two Bloodclaw effects the first is a 20 point dd spell and the second is roughly a 80 point damage dot. I know th dot is there because first I tried it out on some low level creatures like Pumas and as they ran they kept losing life I&#39;ve also managed to kill a few lizzies in Cazic with the bloodclaw effect as they ran for help.<br/>
