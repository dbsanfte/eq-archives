<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-726538435">Well I made the elusive level 20 last night, made the trek from the Karanas<br/>
to Neriak to purchase my new spells, and lo...Animate dead wasn&#39;t there.  I<br/>
did a quick search and found another level 20 necro, and he tells me that<br/>
the spell is in Oggok...hooray! :) before I make this long journey I wanted<br/>
to check with you folks and make sure no one had found it closer to the<br/>
homeland.<br/>
