<div id="ygrps-yiv-58283169">Well... i would suggest to buy Bone walk(lvl 8 pet), Gather shadows(invisibility) , mend bones(heal your pet) and dark pact(faster mana regen) first... and because your a human i would pick up dead eye(infravisioln) also... when you got cash also pick up dark empathy(a spell that drains your life and gives to others) get ward undead also if your going to hunt undead<br/>
<br/>
Its still pretty much thesame way to kill non undead creatures.... clinging darkness send in pet , poison bolt , fear , repeat until dead... thats atleast the strat i use.... dont know where might be good to hunt as i am a darkelf<br/>

&gt; I am a human in Qeynos and I just hit level 8 tonight.  Before I go off and<br/>
&gt; waste money on spells that don&#39;t work, I was hoping to get some feedback<br/>
&gt; from people on the list as to the best spells at level 8 to purchase and<br/>
&gt; why.  Also perhaps if anyone could clue me in as to where in my area is a<br/>
&gt; good place to kill and how to apply the old and new spells to gaining xp and<br/>
&gt; loot I would greatly appreciate it.  Thank you ahead of time!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; P.S.<br/>
&gt; Don&#39;t die twice right when you make a level.  I had made 8 and lost it just<br/>
&gt; as quickly as I got it.  Didn&#39;t even have time to enjoy it before I was<br/>
&gt; struggling to get back to it :)<br/>
