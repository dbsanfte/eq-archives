<div id="ygrps-yiv-594518692">Go to Black Burrow.   You have to zone into the hills (just up the path<br/>
from Qeynos) and take a right until you&#39;re at the &quot;wall&quot; of the zone.<br/>
Follow this forward.  You&#39;ll come to a guard tower and a path leading right<br/>
between two hills.  Pass this up and keep going straight.  It&#39;s a wee bit of<br/>
a walk (kinda/sorda), but Black Burrow will be the cave in the shape of the<br/>
mouth that you come upon.  Oh, you&#39;ll have to walk left around some hills if<br/>
you keep following right next to the &quot;edge&quot; of the zone, as  even though it<br/>
looks like you can walk over it you can&#39;t.  It&#39;s a very small spot, though.<br/>
<br/>
    If you can&#39;t group, then I suggest sticking by the entrance, having some<br/>
bone chips, and whacking away at near by Scrawny Gnolls if there&#39;s any left.<br/>
That way, you can run into the little cave that leads back out, and zone if<br/>
you have to to stop from dying.  Dying Sucks.  hehe.. I&#39;ve been told I<br/>
should make that a bumper sticker..<br/>
<br/>
    Anyways, the going gets much much slower at that point.  Once you reach<br/>
8th level, then you get to go into the Karans -- as long as you have Bone<br/>
Walk -- and pick on the beasties there.  Just keep this in mind:  The guards<br/>
will _NOT_ protect you against the lions.  At least, not the &quot;a lioness&quot;.<br/>
Found that out the fun way as the guards just watched it maul the heck out<br/>
of me. =/<br/>
<br/>
    To get to the Karanas, go the same way as if you were going to Black<br/>
Burrow, but take a right on the path at the guard tower going between the<br/>
two hills.  Don&#39;t go here unless you&#39;re 8th level with Bone Walk, though.<br/>
Also, while in the Qeynos hills you&#39;ll want to keep a _very_ keen eye out<br/>
for two NPC&#39;s called Holly Windstalker and Cross Treewind.  They are instant<br/>
death to you.  Avoid at all cost -- I almost quit the game as I was so d***<br/>
tired of dying so many times in a row by her.  Your faction standing doesn&#39;t<br/>
matter with these two, at least I know for sure with Holly.  They&#39;ll attack<br/>
and kill you, anyway.  Stay off the paths, but that doesn&#39;t guarantee your<br/>
safety.<br/>
<br/>
    Once you go in there, use a little tactic when fighting the creatures<br/>
and make sure you _know_ the way back to the guard tower.  Tell your Bone<br/>
Walk skelly to attack the creature, then cast fear on it to make it run away<br/>
and give your skelly free hits.  You can follow behind and whack away at it<br/>
too, but be prepared to back off when the Fear spell wears off and its<br/>
suddenly facing you again.  Also, don&#39;t hunt in the Karanas like this unless<br/>
you have a big weapon (Pike or some other two-handed weapon) to give to<br/>
skelly so he does some good damage.  Oh, and beware the Treant.  It&#39;s about<br/>
the height of a guard tower.  You&#39;ll know it when you see it.<br/>
<br/>
    Anything above Cavorting Bones takes two bone chips to cast, by the way.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy,<br/>
