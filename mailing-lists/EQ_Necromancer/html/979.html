<b>Subject:</b> Re: Hunting at 16 <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-251902918">as per the suggestion of someone on this list, i spent about an hour an a <br/>
half killing Jonah Buckler in Lake Rathetear.  got me the last half of L15 <br/>
(man that was a crappy lvl to be).  i would suggest buying all your spells <br/>
first and stashing them in the bank to save yourself the trip to neriak (or <br/>
wherever).  if this is your first time in the area, find a map site and <br/>
print out the maps of lake rathetear and rathe mtns (mtns especially).<br/>

&gt;I am almost 16 (should get it tonight) and I have spent most of my last few<br/>
&gt;levels in Oasis and South Ro... with some time spent in Lavastorm.  While I<br/>
&gt;know I can continue hunting crocs and stuff in Oasis it is getting really<br/>
&gt;boring.  Anyone have suggestions on where to go hunt?  I am primarily<br/>
&gt;interested in exp... there are a couple of people I am trying to catch up<br/>
&gt;to.  Thank you in advance.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Yours in hate,<br/>
