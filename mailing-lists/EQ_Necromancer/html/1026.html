<b>Subject:</b> Bug with Dark Empathy text? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-295779936">Hi all,<br/>
I would like to post a change that should be made<br/>
for our beneficial spells that I didn&#39;t really pay<br/>
attention to until last night. The text messages<br/>
we give while buffing or healing are very<br/>
misleading to people who don&#39;t know what they<br/>
mean.<br/>
<br/>
I was in the Freeport arena having fun dueling<br/>
different classes. A warrior was wanting to duel a<br/>
friend of mine but needed a small hit point gain<br/>
before he was fully healed. Both a paladin and I<br/>
cast spells on him, mine was Dark Empathy, the<br/>
paladin&#39;s spell was, by mistake, Lull. Now I&#39;m<br/>
sure that had the warrior ever gotten Dark Empathy<br/>
cast on him before he would know that the text<br/>
messages sound strange, specifically the fact that<br/>
the caster says, &quot;Ahhh, I feel much better now,&quot;<br/>
when in fact he is giving his health to that<br/>
person. However, the warrior didn&#39;t know any<br/>
better so he saw the Lull, heard my words, and<br/>
promptly attacked me.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t play on PvP servers but I was looking<br/>
forward to one. I wouldn&#39;t want this to happen<br/>
again in a PvP environment though. So my question<br/>
is this, will the text of this spell ever be<br/>
modifed to reflect the fact that the caster is<br/>
hurting himself??<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the gripe but it kind of bothered me<br/>
last night.<br/>
