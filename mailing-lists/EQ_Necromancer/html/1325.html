<div id="ygrps-yiv-360338878">This makes me wonder again what they&#39;ll have in Paineel, if / when they<br/>
ever finish the thing. :)  I wonder if they&#39;re going to have a merchant<br/>
there with bone chips? It would make sense.<br/>
<br/>
    Not to mention spells.  I don&#39;t know about you folks, perhaps you like<br/>
it, but I don&#39;t like the thought of having to &quot;research&quot; all of the good<br/>
spells.  Figured I could buy &#39;em from you other players. :)<br/>
<br/>
    Oh!  This is just a bit of a side note.  Perhaps all of you have already<br/>
done this, but awhile back I went to Odus and checked the location that&#39;s<br/>
supposed to lead to Paineel.  There&#39;s a nice entry way to it, and a tunnel<br/>
going back into the rock.  A couple of talking skeletons are in there that<br/>
complain &quot;a skeleton&#39;s work is never done&quot;, and suggests you pick up a pick<br/>
and help them out if you hail &#39;em.  Instead of loading, you find yourself<br/>
back several steps towards the entrance of the tunnel.<br/>
<br/>
    Heck, while I&#39;m at it, I may as well ask here too.  I&#39;m looking for<br/>
people to tell me what the price is for the Thaumaturgist (sp?) robe.  I<br/>
hear it goes for 70 to 80 plat.  I&#39;ll be needing to know soon and I&#39;m just<br/>
trying to verify this.  Thanks!<br/>
