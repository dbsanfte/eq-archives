I personally, started my necro in neriak and just ran straight to Freeport.<br/>
Less hassle and i leveled to about 7 in about 12 hours. Now i form with<br/>
others for derv hunting in Ro, but that gets a bit crowded. Once you hit 10<br/>
to 12 you can kill very small stuff in oasis as long as you don&#39;t venture to<br/>
far in and watch for the Sand Giants. Ro is a good place to level until<br/>
about 12. Easy to solo there for a necro.<br/>
