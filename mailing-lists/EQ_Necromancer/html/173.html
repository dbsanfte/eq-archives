<div id="ygrps-yiv-1600204538">Here are some answers:<br/>
<br/>
Your Research skill goes up REAL fast... as in like somewhere around 10-20<br/>
points per PRACTICE POINT (either that or every point you put it in<br/>
increases it a circle (ie at level 24 four point would put you at... uh...<br/>
120?)  Basically one practice point does NOT equal one skill point, it<br/>
equals many.<br/>
<br/>
What should you use your points in?  I would save about half for the magical<br/>
day when Specialization becomes a reality.  And dump the other half in one<br/>
language, find a buddy who will dumpe their&#39;s in a different language...<br/>
then spam each other.<br/>
<br/>
Other than that it works just like any other trade.  You get components and<br/>
COMBINE them in a container, called a Lexicon or or Grimoire or something...<br/>
they don&#39;t sell most of our components in stores, they must be taken from<br/>
NPC spellcasters or inherently magic creatures.  There are also LEVELS of<br/>
containers.  Like the first book costs like a platinum piece and has four<br/>
slots, but a greater book has six slots and costs ten platinum (or<br/>
something).  Generally each spell has its own recipe.  Necromancers I<br/>
believe use a book called... uh... crap I lost it (I&#39;m pretty sure it had<br/>
the word &quot;Diablerie&quot; in somewhere), basically in the guild there&#39;s a lady in<br/>
the back that sells all the common components and she has our book of<br/>
Research.<br/>
<br/>
does it work?  Yes, is it hard?  YES.  Make sure your Research is maxxed out<br/>
and the spell you are making is not above your level, because losing spell<br/>
components to failures REALLY sucks.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks to all who answered my questions about where to find <br/>
&gt; spells. I now<br/>
&gt; have everyhting I need after shopping in Freeport. I was not <br/>
&gt; able to find<br/>
&gt; Banshee Aura. I am told this is a spell that must be researched.<br/>
&gt; I have some questions about research.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I made level 16 and went to my guild. I was only able to <br/>
&gt; train one point<br/>
&gt; into research. Is this normal? If so, why do I have 50 <br/>
&gt; practice points saved<br/>
&gt; up.... Nevertheless, I do have some questions. How do I <br/>
&gt; research? I think<br/>
&gt; there is a book I&#39;m supposed to buy, but don&#39;t know the <br/>
&gt; title. Will it tell<br/>
&gt; me how to research spells? Is research like smithing where I will be<br/>
&gt; combining things in attempts to get a success? Does each spell have a<br/>
&gt; separate &quot;recipe&quot; or do I just combine the same things and <br/>
&gt; see what happens?<br/>
&gt; And lastly, I saw a whole bunch of books for sale which I suspect are<br/>
&gt; related to research, With titles like Calling Forth the <br/>
&gt; Darkness. How do I<br/>
&gt; know these books are for necromancers or not? Any help would be great.<br/>
&gt; Thanks....<br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;If anyone knows where these spells can be found, please <br/>
&gt; let me know. I<br/>
&gt; have<br/>
&gt; &gt; searched all of Akanon and am losing the life that once drove me. My<br/>
&gt; undying<br/>
&gt; &gt; gratitude to any who answer the call.&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I found the majority of the 16th level spells in <br/>
&gt; Freeport...  You have to<br/>
&gt; check<br/>
&gt; &gt; a lot of different vendors (theres about 8 of them) under <br/>
&gt; the city but<br/>
&gt; most of<br/>
&gt; &gt; them are there...<br/>
