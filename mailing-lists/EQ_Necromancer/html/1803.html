<div id="ygrps-yiv-1989828928">I think even finding rusty weapons is a PIA.  I have not seen daylight from<br/>
sola for quite a long time and I can&#39;t always find a gob with a weapon let<br/>
alone finding 2 gobs with weapons.  What even tops it all off is that<br/>
sometimes it takes me 3 pets to break into a spot so I can hunt.  So if I am<br/>
lucky I have 6 fs steel daggers just so that I can maximize my pets<br/>
potential and thats if I&#39;m lucky.  But 9 times out of 10 if I find a weapon,<br/>
it&#39;s heavier then a fs dagger and what verant wants me to be is be<br/>
encumbered with the craptacular str that they give us casters because we<br/>
have to carry around lots of weapons to get their broken pets working right.<br/>
<br/>
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh<br/>
<br/>
I feel better now.<br/>

&gt; Jeeeeez.  Now I understand why everyone&#39;s pissed off (I am now in that<br/>
&gt; number, myself).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ok, so if the pet doesn&#39;t benefit from a reduced delay weapon.......is he<br/>
&gt; HARMED by an INCREASED delay weapon?  In other words, if I give him<br/>
&gt; something with a delay over 30, will it slow him down?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If the answer to this question is yes, I&#39;ll be even more pissed.....<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, he is not.  (that would be *far* too complicated for the Verant<br/>
&quot;engineers&quot; to code) ;)<br/>
<br/>
I saw a lvl 44 necromancer pet dual wielding spectre scythes the other<br/>
night.  Probably the funniest thing I&#39;ve seen in EQ.  The upside to the<br/>
whole thing, is if you need a weapon for your pet, any rusty POS will do.<br/>
Hardly compensation for the loss of power, but look for the silver lining I<br/>
always say.<br/>
