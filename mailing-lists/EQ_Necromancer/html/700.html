<b>Subject:</b> FREEPORT NECRO guild is where? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1141215034">2 questions . . .   I am a gnome necromancer . .. <br/>
<br/>
1) Can I go to the bank in freeport and get money for necro guild or will I be KOS in bank zone.   (Ins&#39;t the bank in North Freeport?)  <br/>
<br/>
2) If I wanted to play it safe, get my money from Akkanon bank then take boat to Freeport, HOW DO I GET to the NECROGUILD from the outside.  So guy told me there is a passage from the wall in west free port that goes into the necro guild from outside and I was wondering if anyone could give me specifics on oing this.</div>
