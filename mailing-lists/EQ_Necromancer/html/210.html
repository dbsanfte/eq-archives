<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It works with weapons and is completely automatic.  Im level 17 now and it hit<br/>
for 23 or so hit points.  Ive only had it hit once per fight but I have a level<br/>
16 wizard with me and we tend to kill things fairly quickly.  I tend to melee<br/>
very little and when I do, its only to pull something off my pet for a moment so<br/>
he can finish it off.  I see myself using the spell very rarely as I get higher<br/>
since the monsters are begining to hit rather hard and the lack of hit points<br/>
and AC for the necromancer makes it tough.</div>
