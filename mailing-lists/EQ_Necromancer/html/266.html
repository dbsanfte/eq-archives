<div id="ygrps-yiv-962969146">Sorry, black con?  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen one of those.  What<br/>
does that mean?  The only things I&#39;ve seen were<br/>
<br/>
	Green, green risky, blue, blue risky, white, yellow, red.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never seen a black con I don&#39;t think.<br/>
<br/>
	Skeletons gain levels just like monsters do (though they certainly<br/>
don&#39;t do the same damage).  Meaning they eventually get kick, bash, hit<br/>
magically, probably double attack and dual wield as well.  Whenever I get a<br/>
lvl 12 skeleton with Convoke Shadow He can bash and hit magically, level 11<br/>
he can&#39;t hit magically but can still bash.  I&#39;ve seen a level 16 pet kick so<br/>
I know that&#39;s what they get at level 16.<br/>
<br/>
	Where would I gain XP?  At level 9?  Grab a fellow Necromancer and<br/>
camp Skeleton Lrodd at Befallen.  He&#39;s often overlooked by the higher levels<br/>
because he&#39;s in a lame place.  He&#39;s tough single, but you could do it if you<br/>
were lucky.  I would just hammer him then run around and kill all the first<br/>
level skels for loot and bone chips, then meditate and kill him again.  I<br/>
would also steer clear of trains, but sometimes try to drag off a mummy or<br/>
zombie.  This is done by watching the train go past (but stay away), select<br/>
a monster, hit it with Ward, then run into an unused room away from the<br/>
returning train.  Almost always just the monster you pissed off will come<br/>
after you unless you cast too close to the group.<br/>
<br/>
	Befallen was basically the thing that moved me from 8 to 12 with<br/>
hard work.  With your crappy 4th level spells pretty much anything else just<br/>
laughs at you, though I still use Poison Bolt as a small damage spell.<br/>

&gt; ive been going to najena (sp?) and picking off large and <br/>
&gt; greater skeletons <br/>
&gt; (beware the trains and rushes).  if you can get a good party <br/>
&gt; lavastorm is a <br/>
&gt; good place to kill fire drakes and dervishes, and even fire <br/>
&gt; elementals if <br/>
&gt; you have some spell casters and&#92;or tanks with magic weapons.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; another good place is n ro, and using your detect undead <br/>
&gt; spell.  since <br/>
&gt; lesser mummies and zombies are good to kill now that you have <br/>
&gt; ward undead, i <br/>
&gt; have been focusing more on finding quality undead (i can <br/>
&gt; sometimes take <br/>
&gt; yellow-red undead if i have a good pet).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; on a side note, does anyone think pets gain from exp?  <br/>
&gt; personally, ive kept <br/>
&gt; a blue pet and had a good run of kills (a few young kodiaks, <br/>
&gt; a halfling, <br/>
&gt; bunch of skels) and i noticed that he was hitting faster, and <br/>
&gt; stunning <br/>
&gt; creatures.  i conned him, and low and behold he conned black! <br/>
&gt;  maybe i was <br/>
&gt; on crack, but im going to try it again to verify it for myself.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Hello,<br/>
&gt; &gt;I&#39;m a DE Necro who is frustrated with the 9th level. I&#39;ve <br/>
&gt; died and lost it <br/>
&gt; &gt;4<br/>
&gt; &gt;times now and can&#39;t seem to get above one bubble of exp <br/>
&gt; before I lose it.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Hunting<br/>
&gt; &gt;in the forest seems to be worthless, only an occasional <br/>
&gt; skeleton gives me <br/>
&gt; &gt;any<br/>
&gt; &gt;exp (or a kodiak if I can find one), the haflings eat me for <br/>
&gt; lunch. I&#39;ve <br/>
&gt; &gt;been<br/>
&gt; &gt;to<br/>
&gt; &gt;east commons a few times but I die as much as I make <br/>
&gt; experience. Befallen<br/>
&gt; &gt;seems to be too hard (and I die) or too easy (and no exp). Am I doing<br/>
&gt; &gt;something wrong? Should I be hunting elsewhere? I&#39;ve about <br/>
&gt; had it with my<br/>
&gt; &gt;necro character, I&#39;ve recently started a human mage in <br/>
&gt; Freeport (eech) and<br/>
&gt; &gt;he&#39;s having a much easier time. I don&#39;t mind slow going but <br/>
&gt; I like to see <br/>
&gt; &gt;some<br/>
&gt; &gt;character advancement.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Any suggestions? Any help? I&#39;m about to give up..<br/>
