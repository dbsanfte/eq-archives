<div id="ygrps-yiv-621121939">You don&#39;t even have to go that  deep into the city. Underwater around the dock, there<br/>
is an entrance to the aqua ducts. Find that, and you&#39;ll be in the lovely home of the<br/>
Bloodsabers. Finding the shrine of Bertoxxulous shouldn&#39;t be too hard once you are down<br/>
there. Finding your way out is a little harder.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I&#39;m going to try to meet up with them again, but I&#39;ve gotta be quick<br/>
&gt; &gt; and get heck outta Quetos real fast..as soon as I land without runing<br/>
&gt; &gt; into NPCs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This&#39;ll be tough. There are guards all over the place. You&#39;ll never make it<br/>
&gt; above ground (you&#39;ve got 2 zones worth of Queynos to get through above<br/>
&gt; ground).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I suggest you do this:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Get off the boat and go left into an open marketplace (tho there are guards<br/>
&gt; there that guard the entrance) then turn to the right to leave the<br/>
&gt; marketplace. You&#39;ll see a smith on the left and a large structure straight<br/>
&gt; ahead and to the right. Enter that. Its the arena and its a PvP area. Work<br/>
&gt; your way down into the tunnels under that, and you&#39;ll find a grate with a<br/>
&gt; guard behind it. He should be friendly to you (unless he hates Erudites). Go<br/>
&gt; through there and you&#39;ll come to a large room with a bunch of doorways. A<br/>
&gt; trail of bones leads to one. Follow the bones into an area with a false wall<br/>
&gt; (there&#39;s a bone arrow there) and you&#39;ll find yourself zoning into the<br/>
&gt; Queynos Aquaducts. In there is the Necro/Shadow Knight Guild. After visiting<br/>
&gt; them, you can find your way through the aquaducts to a &quot;secret&quot; passage<br/>
&gt; (everyone that lives in Q knows about it, of course) that leads outside the<br/>
&gt; city. Then you&#39;re safe!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Good luck.<br/>
