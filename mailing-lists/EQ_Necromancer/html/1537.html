<div id="ygrps-yiv-1700184865">Not neccisarily.  Why put buffs on a character that doesn&#39;t need them?  I<br/>
mean, wouldn&#39;t you save mana to buff those who need it?  Like tanks and<br/>
such?  However, you could get someone to buff you, letting them know that<br/>
means you can work much more efficiently with the nice lifetap, manastone,<br/>
lifetap, manastone process.  Well....that was till we got nerfed :(-.<br/>

&gt; If you were to go on a Dragon raid, I am sure you would have so many buffs<br/>
&gt; piled up that you would have much much more than 766 HP.<br/>

&gt; I have a level 50 wizard. I can&#39;t remember for sure, but I think I have<br/>
&gt; 766 hit points unbuffed.  Nagafen&#39;s AoE can kill me in one or two<br/>
&gt; rounds... :P<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Have never been on a dragon raid, so I don&#39;t know the actualy AOE of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; spell, but I would think the AOE damage spell they cast would eat the<br/>
&gt; necros<br/>
&gt; &gt; up and if not well the fear running you around would.. Plus 1 summon and<br/>
&gt; &gt; byebye necro and pet... I could be wrong, but I really don&#39;t think it<br/>
&gt; would<br/>
&gt; &gt; work.. Hope to go on a dragon raid soon and find out for myself exactly<br/>
&gt; what<br/>
&gt; &gt; the dragons are like.<br/>
