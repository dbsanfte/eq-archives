I wonder if call of bones resets your faction to base skeleton faction.<br/>
But even if it does, that won&#39;t help a DE that has destroyed his faction<br/>
(for the same reason shared wolf form didn&#39;t work - illusions only change<br/>
your base racial faction, not religion-based faction changes or<br/>
adjustments due to kills or quests).<br/>
<br/>
I couldn&#39;t find any reference to another way to increase dark bargainer<br/>
faction.  Rumor has it that some quests can be done invis - you might try<br/>
giving 4 stacks of 4 red wines while invis, the re-casting and repeating.<br/>
<br/>
Or you may be SOL.  Perhaps it&#39;s time to start cultivating freeport<br/>
faction.<br/>
