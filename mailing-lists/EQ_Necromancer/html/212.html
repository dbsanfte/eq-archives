   I read the same post and got quite scared, but I don&#39;t think you saw<br/>
one of the replies. I&#39;m putting it here for other necros to read and<br/>
comment on. This post makes me think necros can do fine _if_ they know how<br/>
to use their spells (the same is true of any casting class). Enjoy :)<br/>

<br/>
First of all, you are not a necro, therefore you ahve NO idea how powerful<br/>
the necro DoTs are. Shamans have extremely bad DoT compared to the masters<br/>
of the DoTs, the necromansers.<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s just look at a few simple DoTs that the necros get.<br/>
<br/>
First, the pure damage DoTs. HB and BB falls under this catigory. They are<br/>
rarely resisted, and have mroe than 2 vs 1 damage vs mana ratio. Yes, DoTs<br/>
take time, as a necro we can MAKE that time, while a shaman or druid just<br/>
kite with SoW. How to make the time you ask? Necros get Fear, a pet, and<br/>
the Darkness line of DoTs slows target 50%, and stops them from moving<br/>
when they ahve less than 30% life.<br/>
<br/>
DoT ALWAYS do the damage they do, there is NO chance of taking less damage<br/>
after it&#39;s cast. DD IS better in terms that you do the damage in 1 sec,<br/>
instead of minuts, however DDs can be resisted, or partially resisted.<br/>
<br/>
The main problem with your assumptions is that you are using your<br/>
experience playing a Shaman, who is ranked 4th in term so DoT power, to<br/>
compared to the Necros, who are ranked #1. The list goes Necro, druid,<br/>
enchanter, and shamans. Yes,t he shaman DoTs get resisted a lot, but don&#39;t<br/>
assume the same for other classes.<br/>
<br/>
As for the necro who started this string, here&#39;s a tip. We necros get then<br/>
entire line of Fear spells for a reason. And Darkness is MUCH better than<br/>
HF to use on critters, look up to see why. <br/>
<br/>
One more thing that the DoTs have over DD is that it DOESN&#39;T do the damage<br/>
up front, therefore the critter will NOT charge after you when you cast.<br/>
BB does 405 damage, but the critter stays on pet after you cast it. Force<br/>
Shock does 200, yet the critter charges straight at the wizard who casted<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
DD and DoTs both have pluses and minuses, yet both are incredibly<br/>
powerful. Learn to use it, then you will see.<br/>
