&lt;&lt; Is it possible to get a DE Necromancer&#39;s faction up high enough in <br/>
rivervale<br/>
 to bank? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have heard of A dark elf say on a message board he was able to get his <br/>
faction to the point he could bank he saids he was still unable to seel or <br/>
buy but could bank.  I beta I know there was a Troll shadowknight who did the <br/>
same.<br/>

ps a GM told me it was possible even for a Dark Elf to enter the high elf <br/>
city hehhee now thats a faction adjustment :)</div>
