most factions, but don&#39;t know about dark bargainers specifically.<br/>

Gnip (L18 Gnome Necro, Bertoxx follower) was indifferent to the merchants<br/>
at level 4.  At level 9, I could afford a packfull of red wine for the guy<br/>
in the 3rd gate library, and am now warmly viewed by most merchants.<br/>

Lightstones and greater lightstones to the DE smith in S Ro helps this<br/>
faction as well.<br/>
