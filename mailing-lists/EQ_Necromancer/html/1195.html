<div id="ygrps-yiv-1144069676">Holy Schnikes!  I have a Shaman as well as a Necro and you should see the SPAMMING in my inbox here from people on the Shaman list talking about necros.  It is out of control!   Basically a huge discussion on the DOT nerfing thing. You might want to subscribe to it, if you don&#39;t mind a schload of email!  :-)<br/>
