<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-612160526">I&#39;m no video expert, but Brad made a statement a while<br/>
back stating that the trees moving is not what causes<br/>
the problem.  It is the fact taht there is layers of<br/>
trees.  i.e.  tree behind tree behind tree, etc.  that<br/>
is why the clipping adjustment can help.  The older<br/>
zones simply didn&#39;t have the detail or depth that<br/>
kunark has.  Just thinking 3 dimensionally, the trees<br/>
would have be redrawn as you move around regardless,<br/>
since if the tree&#39;s aren&#39;t moving, you are, and<br/>
therefore their position is changing.  Maybe someone<br/>
can clarify.  However I have the voodoo 3000 and i get<br/>
bad lag too.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It doesnt.  I have a Vodoo3000, and I feel like I<br/>
&gt; lag in Kunark more then<br/>
&gt; anybody.  I think a GOOD part of the issue with lag<br/>
&gt; and frame rates<br/>
&gt; there....the damn trees move....all the time.  That<br/>
&gt; has to wreak hell on the<br/>
&gt; graphics end of a system.  If not, well, why do we<br/>
&gt; need to see the leaves<br/>
&gt; blowing in the breeze...??<br/>
