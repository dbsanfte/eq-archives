<div id="ygrps-yiv-1252101489">I thought I&#39;d post this for any up and coming necros, like myself.<br/>
After playing a bit more, I found what&#39;s improved in the lvl 16 pet.  It&#39;s<br/>
gained dodge, reposte (sp?), and parry.  This isn&#39;t very common, but it<br/>
happens. Also, it seems to have a very nice ammount of HPs. :)<br/>
<br/>
    Anyway, this is sort of a follow up remark I made in my response to the<br/>
&quot;weather&quot; post.<br/>
