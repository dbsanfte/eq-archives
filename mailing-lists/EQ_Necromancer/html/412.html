&gt; Well I am only 2nd lvl and I wanted a opinion on race too, I am a dark elf<br/>
&gt; and yeah KOS sucks, but I can get that better through work right?  I might<br/>
&gt; restart the char after hearing from you.   I have 130 int and I put the rest<br/>
&gt; in dex . . .     is the Euidite or  Gnome a better choice?  And how KOS<br/>
&gt; prone are Gnome Necromancers or Euridites?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Race is really a personal preference. I chose Dark Elf myself, but that<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean Gnome or Erudite isn&#39;t a good choice. Many people like<br/>
playing things other than Dark Elf simply because they feel the Dark Elf<br/>
necro is too cliche&#39;. <br/>
  The way you put stats is perfect... 130 int and the rest in dex is<br/>
exactly what you should do.  Erudite suffers from a bad starting area, and<br/>
lack of ultravision. They do get a bit higher INT, but that only<br/>
translates to 100 mana at level 50.  Hardly a concern. Gnomes are a good<br/>
choice as well as DE. They have similar stats, have infravision, and a<br/>
better starting area. However, it is a tad harder to buy things around<br/>
there since many more merchants hate you. Neriak typically doesn&#39;t have<br/>
that problem.<br/>
  Of all the necromancers I have talked to that have gotten higher level<br/>
than me, they have all been very happy with their choice of race,<br/>
regardless of what race that was. I don&#39;t mention human simply because I<br/>
don&#39;t feel that is the wisest choice unless you wish to play one for<br/>
roleplay reasons. <br/>

&gt; Thanks . ..<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; P.S.  any gnome necros get KOS by dwarves or high elves wood elves or<br/>
&gt; humans?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; personally ive liked even the idea of the necro when i heard about it<br/>
&gt; while<br/>
&gt; &gt; eq was still in development.  i have to say i like the class, and we<br/>
&gt; really<br/>
&gt; &gt; do have many advantages that other classes dont get.  the ability to heal<br/>
&gt; &gt; ourselves in combat while doing DD is very good, as is having a pet skel.<br/>
&gt; &gt; our mastery over the undead is great too. the only bad thing is getting<br/>
&gt; KOS<br/>
&gt; &gt; by a great deal of npc&#39;s, but there has to be a trade-off somewhere.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; other classes i was looking at for a second character was either a druid<br/>
&gt; or<br/>
&gt; &gt; a shaman- both seem to have a pretty broad base of spells.  an enchanter<br/>
&gt; may<br/>
&gt; &gt; also be good, but i havent decided =)<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;I have a wizard who is 14th and I just started a necro and am 2nd lvl. ..<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;I think Necromancer may be the way to go but I would like to hear your<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;opinions,  how is the high lvl Necro stuff going?  Can you hold your<br/>
&gt; own???<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;I like my 14th lvl wizard and I think I might just use both classes but<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;like to hear input . . .<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Thanks!<br/>
