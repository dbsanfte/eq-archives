<div id="ygrps-yiv-1331330697">Hi everyone.....I&#39;m a 30 Iksar Necro on the Antonius Bayle Server. <br/>
I&#39;ve been 30 for over a week now, but I still don&#39;t have Animate Dead <br/>
(pet spell) or Renew Bones (heal pet spell), both level 29, &#39;cause I <br/>
don&#39;t have the right Words, my Research isn&#39;t good enough anyway, and <br/>
they are defintely Research-only (unless I&#39;m lucky enough to find a <br/>
fellow Necro who&#39;ll sell me them for a good price) &#39;cause none of the <br/>
merchants in Cabilis have them. Bah....<br/>
So, what sort of stuff you talking about here at the moment? Maybe I <br/>
can jump in the conversation and join in?</div>
