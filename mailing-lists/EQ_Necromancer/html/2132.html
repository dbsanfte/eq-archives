<div>Hiya all, my friend just quit the game and gave me his account. It has a 51 
nec, that I don&#39;t know how to play hehe. He said he might consider coming back 
sometime in the future, so I want to try and get his necro to 60 by then =) I&#39;m 
totally new to a necro, but I do&nbsp;have a 49 druid. Any tips on the necro 
would be greatly appreciated.<font size="2"> </font><font
 size="3">Thanks!</font></div></html></div>
