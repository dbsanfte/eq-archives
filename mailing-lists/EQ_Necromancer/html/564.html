<div id="ygrps-yiv-1067562611">Can you use Zobie skin to summon your pet?  And I thought I read somewhere that someone got a shade as a pet from summoning.<br/>
<br/>
Also Does anyone know how the humans will view my Gnome Necro?   I got my faction up to indifferent w/ the dwarves by killing orcs in CB, but I don&#39;t know if I can take the boat yet.</div>
