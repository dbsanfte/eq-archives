&gt;  hopefully help get extra money, but my skill is maxed at 30 from patchwork<br/>
&gt;  armor, and I don&#39;t know that I want to take up smithing to increase it some<br/>
&gt;  more (by making studded and re-inforced etc.). I&#39;ve considered maybe taking<br/>
&gt;  up another trade to help with getting extra money. Any suggestions?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well... I long left nerick (at 6) and have grouped nice then... so I cannot <br/>
help you with that...  but as for money...<br/>
<br/>
It is not learning... but hunt orc pawns...  They will sometimes have weapons <br/>
and armor pieces.  When you have covered yourself with the armor piece ... <br/>
then sell for 1 to 4 gold a piece.  This starts to add up.  If you want a <br/>
place close by to sell... find the way to the necro guild in freeport.  (in <br/>
east freeport... don&#39;t go to north freeport until you have hunted orcs intil <br/>
you were sick of it... then hunted more orcs untill your dog, cat, kids, <br/>
wife, mom, dad, and the rest of your neghborhood are sick of you hunting <br/>
orcs... than maybee you can get into north freeport without being killed.) <br/>
While the prices are not as good as Neriak... it is a shorter trip.  You will <br/>
still have to periodically go back to Neriak to bank.  (the bank in freeport <br/>
is in North Freeport...)<br/>
