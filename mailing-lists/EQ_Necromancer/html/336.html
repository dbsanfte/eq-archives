&gt; the five shamans?  Stand in the middle of the paw and cast, they all get<br/>

&gt; irritated at the griffins that can hit through walls and houses as well as<br/>
&gt; other things.  I do know that its up to the area.  Sometimes your skel<br/>

&gt; reasons for some of it, but nothing is perfect.  More on this later.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    I&#39;ve noticed that happen in Befallen, with the rubble laying in the<br/>
middle of the floor, first floor immediately down the steps.  Great way to<br/>
get rid of big nasties.  If you&#39;re quick enough, you can jump up on to the<br/>
rubble, climb over, and make it run around as you cast.  &#39;Course, if you get<br/>
stuck between the celing and the rubble.... *cringe*<br/>

&gt; lower.  Boom, get it as small as possible and you can see underwater<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; problem not just us, and its not a big problem at all, just stay close to<br/>
&gt; shore.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    I&#39;ve noticed that, it&#39;s how I see if there&#39;s any piranah or what not.<br/>
Which are usually too quick to get back out of the water from, considering<br/>
if they hit ya, you&#39;re stunned, ate alive, stunned, repeat...<br/>
<br/>
    It doesn&#39;t have to treat it as two worlds, though, and none of these<br/>
clipping problems have to happen.  People say, they&#39;re breaking new ground.<br/>
When you think about it, they&#39;re really not.  Take, for instance, Quake.<br/>
Now, before you freak out and trash me on this one, they&#39;re really not all<br/>
that differant.  They&#39;re both (able to be) played online, both have walls,<br/>
both have water and land areas, weapons for swinging close or attacking from<br/>
afar, etc.  Quake creatures, however, do not walk through walls, strike<br/>
through walls, or any of that jive, and nor do other players, when playing<br/>
over the &#39;net.  And they&#39;re both full 3D worlds.  I know, I know, EQ is a<br/>
&quot;fantasy role-playing&quot; game, and quake is just a shooter, but the same basic<br/>
concept is there.  Why does EQ have to treat water areas a differant<br/>
&quot;world&quot;, or at least not have interaction between the two?  Differant engin,<br/>
but learn from others, I&#39;m sure they could &quot;easily&quot; allow this.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Why?  You know how easy it would be to abuse things?  Check out<br/>
&gt; Feign Death.  A lot of people complain about the monsters coming back to<br/>
&gt; kill you as soon as you get up even if they are half a zone away.  What<br/>
&gt; stops us from waiting for them to get a decent range away, cast another<br/>
 </span></blockquote>DoT,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; then Feign Death again right there?  The point is in order to make it so<br/>
&gt; people can&#39;t use bad terrain or other things to cheat kills.<br/>

<br/>
    True, however they need a distance limitation on it or something.  I<br/>
don&#39;t want everybody walking around in plate and all carring 999 of all coin<br/>
type, but let&#39;s not be paranoid about it..  This is especially troublesome<br/>
for us Necros, with types like Holly Windstalker and such.  Hell, I was just<br/>
walking through the zone and she apparently ran clear across the zone to get<br/>
me. I never seen her, how&#39;d she even know I was there?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; There are several ways.  Use your pet as a shield, use others as<br/>
&gt; shields, don&#39;t go nuts with spellcasting, conserve!  I think the current<br/>
 </span></blockquote>way<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; is quite good and that spellcasters have a definite advantage over<br/>
 </span></blockquote>fighters,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; especially in PvP.  I dueled an 18th level Shadowknight and won because<br/>
 </span></blockquote>all<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I had to do was move forward and turn around, and move around a lot.  He<br/>
&gt; could only hit me when I was in front of him, and he spent a lot of time<br/>
&gt; reorienting on me.  Now that SUCKS.  It might have gone different had he<br/>
&gt; been in 3rd person view though.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    I love the other views, but ironically I hardly ever use them.  The only<br/>
duel I&#39;ve done is with a friend I know here in person, still both at very<br/>
low levels but him about four or so levels lower.  Hehe.. poor guy, didn&#39;t<br/>
stand a chance..<br/>
<br/>
    As for using the pet as a shield, I do, and nor do I go nuts with the<br/>
spell.  I hate being frenzied (*cough*befallen*cough*) by really big mobs,<br/>
but that doesn&#39;t work quite so well.  I also trade hits with my skeleton,<br/>
stop and life tap, etc.  I just don&#39;t have the mana to last, though.  My<br/>
char&#39;s Int is 90.  At the time, I thought that was a big number.  Heh, yet<br/>
again been bit by the instruction-booklet blues.. Too much work into the<br/>
char, though, to start over.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; You think WE have problems?  We at least get our pets to the 34th<br/>
&gt; level I believe.  Mages have their 24th level pet in the middle of nowhere<br/>
&gt; and after that its straight research.  Believe me that every other<br/>
&gt; spellcaster class has the same if not worse problem that we do.  Besides,<br/>
&gt; its not as bad as you think.  The frequency of component drops was<br/>
 </span></blockquote>increased<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; by 300% and believe me I can see the difference.  I get Words of Tyranny<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; words of Elemental all the tiem off green elementals in Lavastorm, and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Runes<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; of lava crawlers.  Trading will be necessary but I don&#39;t think its all<br/>
 </span></blockquote>that<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; difficult as you make it out to be.  I&#39;m confident that it should work out<br/>
&gt; alright.  Might be annoying, but I don&#39;t see it getting impossible till<br/>
&gt; somewhere after level 34 when even our second book doesn&#39;t contain the<br/>
&gt; spells.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    I&#39;ve yet to see any &quot;words&quot; or &quot;runes&quot;.  Perhaps I&#39;m just not killing<br/>
the right creatures.  I&#39;ve thought about killing Lanshune Novashine (sp?) in<br/>
Qeynos, as he walks around outside and I hear NPC spell-casters and<br/>
intelligent mobs & such will have them, but I really don&#39;t need the faction<br/>
hit..<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Yer lucky you even get that far.  I know just about everything isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; allowed into Third Gate.  I&#39;ll bet that&#39;s a bug anyway but I think you<br/>
 </span></blockquote>HAVE<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; to server Innoruuk to get into The Lodge of the Dead.  Most guards are<br/>
&gt; agnostic so they don&#39;t have a problem, but all Dark Elf Necros HAVE to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>serve<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Innoruuk, and if you aren&#39;t with us, you&#39;re against us.  Its that simple.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; think you&#39;ll probably find yourself KOS in the lodge itself too, but you<br/>
&gt; never know.  Besides, Invis to Undead is like a 2nd Circle spell, you<br/>
 </span></blockquote>should<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; have this already.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    So why have spells that can only be obtained there?  How are we supposed<br/>
to get to them?  Have somebody buy them for us?  I don&#39;t think so, they then<br/>
want a cut of the money and you never know if they&#39;re really going to go in<br/>
and buy it for you, or not, especially with evil charecters.  Supposed to be<br/>
solo, but yet they make us rely on somebody else. ;)  I wonder, what with<br/>
the griffens in the newbie area around Freeport and this, if the developers<br/>
at varant just have that twisted a since of humor. *grin*<br/>
<br/>
    We can deal with the guild, btw, I&#39;ve heard others mention that they&#39;ve<br/>
been to the merchants once they got past the ghouls.  And I know I have Invs<br/>
VS Undead, but I don&#39;t see why we&#39;d have to do that.  It&#39;s the Necro guild..<br/>
*shrug* oh well.   For that matter, there&#39;s the shadow knight guild<br/>
in..err..Oggok?..that there&#39;s a problem getting into, as well...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Yer done.  In my opinion you have some valid arguements.  EQ is<br/>
&gt; definitely buggy and the complaints you had about buggy things were valid.<br/>
&gt; You have to look at it from a business perspective and a developer<br/>
&gt; perspective as well too though.  The more realistic you make a world and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; harder it gets to implement.  You HAVE to stop somewhere.  They are<br/>
 </span></blockquote>working<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; on a lot of these problems too.  I think the longer you stick around the<br/>
&gt; better it will get.  I already think they&#39;ve done ten times better than<br/>
&gt; Ultima Online did. ;)<br/>

&gt; MAlark on Karana<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    Yeah, you do, but don&#39;t forget the obvious things, or the point of the<br/>
game; to have fun.  They seemed to have brushed the latter a bit under the<br/>
rug in favor of &#39;knowing when to quit&#39;.<br/>
