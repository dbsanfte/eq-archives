&gt; Hello.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have recently started a dark elf necromancer and am quickly <br/>
&gt; up to lev 5.<br/>
&gt; The combat strategy seems fairly similar to that of my 16th <br/>
&gt; level magician<br/>
&gt; except there I use DD burn and with my necro I am more <br/>
&gt; patient and use my<br/>
&gt; DOT spells. I tank more with my necro since I can heal myself <br/>
&gt; and go in<br/>
&gt; again for more tanking.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; However mages get NO self defense spells or skills. I am <br/>
&gt; wondering which<br/>
&gt; ones are best and if you all have any tips for them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Dark Elf Necromancers get to at some point or another.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1. Hide skill - Is this just press and pray? if something is <br/>
&gt; charging me can<br/>
&gt; I still HIDE from it? IE a sand giant attacks my skeleton can <br/>
&gt; I press hide<br/>
&gt; to try to survive?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>	Hide works like this, you become invisible but can&#39;t move.  People<br/>
who can see invis (undead, Deadeye, etc) can see you, but nobody else can.<br/>
So if you see an SG walking up to you you can hide IF YOU HAVEN&#39;T PISSED IT<br/>
OFF.  Once a monster has locked on to you it will always know where you<br/>
are... invis or not.  So no, HIDE will not help you if your skel picks a<br/>
fight with an SG.  It will help you if you see someone bringing a train to<br/>
the dungeon exit and hitting one button is quicker than trying to get out of<br/>
the way.  I use it a lot when I don&#39;t have a skel on me and I want to<br/>
meditate, I also have it hotkeyed when trains show up or surprises appear.<br/>
I once had a Sand Giant stand on my head for five minutes while hiding, so<br/>
don&#39;t worry about touch.<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 2. Root - At high levels we get root. Is it resisted by <br/>
&gt; everything by that<br/>
&gt; high level?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>	Sort of, but not quit.  It&#39;ll still work, but probably not on yellow<br/>
or reds.  Eventually it will stop being effective except to stop runners of<br/>
lower level creatures.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 3. Shadow step - How good is casting this then trying for a gate?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>	Again, depends on where you are.  If you have a lot of room,<br/>
probably, I usually use it for duelling with melee types or getting some<br/>
kind of headstart on a blood mad monster.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 4. Feign Death - Seems this could be great. Does this cast <br/>
&gt; fast enough to<br/>
&gt; use in an emergency? Is it dependable enough to use to save <br/>
&gt; the party by<br/>
&gt; taking on the monster why group flees then cast this and let the train<br/>
&gt; dissolve? How long does it last?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>	Yes, no, as long as you want... he he... basically It casts fast and<br/>
the monster &quot;forgets about you&quot;... but not permanently.  Basically its like<br/>
you&#39;re being skpped over when it goes through its hate list.  This is KEY.<br/>
Once you &quot;wake up&quot;, the monster instantly knows it and starts to come back<br/>
for you.  This is a good idea since otherwise you could cast something on a<br/>
monster, Feign, cast again, Feign, a lame tactic indeed.  Make sure (3rd<br/>
person) that the monster is FAR away, then get up and run.  Basically it<br/>
lasts until you decide its time to get up.  Also note that this does NOT<br/>
work in PvP (I think they don&#39;t get the corpse look, plus they can&#39;t loot<br/>
you...)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; 5. Gate - This is the only 1 of the list I&#39;m used to as <br/>
&gt; magicians have his<br/>
&gt; spell but it&#39;s cast time is slow.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>	Yes, slow... I don&#39;t recommend it for an escape spell unless your<br/>
skel is healthy.  I usually just RUN, if you have a headstart and you keep<br/>
going straight most things can&#39;t catch you.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Are there any other survival skills I&#39;ve missed? Seems <br/>
&gt; Necromancers may have<br/>
&gt; an easier time of getting out of trouble then magicians do <br/>
&gt; assuming the<br/>
&gt; above skills/spells are nice.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Your DoT spells should be first off, always, so they get their full effect.<br/>
Don&#39;t be afraid to step in there and take a few hits for your skel, don&#39;t<br/>
forget to heal your skel when you DO get the spells to do so.  Uhm, keep up<br/>
on your weak skills (fighting, swimming, especially SWIMMING).<br/>
