<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1289169742">The level 29 pet spell will always be in game somewhere. On some servers it&#39;s found in the High Elf City, why there I don&#39;t know. The second area and where I bought mine on E&#39;ci is in OOT. The problem is with both those locations is no Necromancer of any race can go buy the spells. So you need a mule or a friend to get those spells. I would try and get the spell right now though as on my server all the Necromancer levels 34-50 are all using the level 29 pet spell except for two who have the level 34 pet spell. Necromancer words are just too rare.<br/>
