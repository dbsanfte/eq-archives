<div id="ygrps-yiv-424855606">Aye, it gives no bonus after 12 and -- with some mobs -- doesn&#39;t really<br/>
add on to dam before 12 either, as they&#39;ll still hit for 13, 14 points of<br/>
dam.  However, this depends on the creature&#39;s AC so giving your skelly a<br/>
fast weapon is usually a good idea. :-)<br/>
<br/>
    What I&#39;ve wondered, is... if you give your skelly armour does it show?<br/>
I know the shield shows up (and I&#39;m wondering if the skelly will get an AC<br/>
bonus for it even after 12th level).  I&#39;ve always wanted to deck my skelly<br/>
out in full plate, and a two handed sword or a good spiffy looking weapon<br/>
and a large shield.  &#39;Course, I&#39;d have to do this at 50th level as money<br/>
probably wouldn&#39;t mean anything by then, but.. the thought just strikes me<br/>
as amusing.  =)<br/>
<br/>
    Ah wells, enough rambling from me.  Enjoy folks.<br/>

&gt; No there is not a way and it is done on purpose so you WON&#39;T give them<br/>
