&gt;&gt; We have always had a high level healing spell, now verant is putting<br/>
&gt;&gt; more of these types of spells in for the lower level nec&#39;s<br/>

Dark Empathy is a L8 spell.  It&#39;s a 30 point reverse lifetap for 20 mana.  <br/>
It&#39;s actually pretty effective if you don&#39;t have a healer and are below<br/>
L20.  Just bandage everyone to 50%, then use bandages to keep your health<br/>
at 50% as you heal others well past the halfway mark. Next combat, a few<br/>
lifetaps and you&#39;re well again.  Shadow compact is L20 and a much better<br/>
version.  10 mana, 20 points per tick reverse lifetap for 4 ticks.<br/>
Between this and allure of death, prepare to use a lot of bandages.<br/>
<br/>
Neither of these are new.  The new spells are a L12 lifetap DOT, a L44<br/>
heart flutter upgrade, and a couple of very inefficient mana-giveaway<br/>
spells.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and to make up for the 33% decrease in pet damage throughout your<br/>
entire career, the L44 and L49 pets cast a wimpy lifetap.<br/>
