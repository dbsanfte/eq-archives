&gt;This weekend, I finally finished the necro quests in the temple, by getting<br/>
&gt;the Harvester...this item was by far the hardest of the 4 available.  Upon<br/>
&gt;turning in a shadowed scythe to Vurgo, he hands you a note and asks for a<br/>
&gt;shadowed knife from the goblin headmaster in OOT, this was relatively<br/>
&gt;simple, the headmaster spawns on the far side of oracle island.  His spot<br/>

&gt;from unrest.  This was a pain in the ass...I got to unrest at about 2am CST<br/>
&gt;and there were a total of 6 people there and I was the highest level by 15<br/>
