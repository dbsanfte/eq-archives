<div id="ygrps-yiv-2024427485">The spells in question can all be cound in Nerriak.  What other spells do<br/>
you *need*?  Well it all depends on how you want to play your character I<br/>
suppose.  Either way, there&#39;s spell lists and descriptions on<br/>
eq.stratics.com and all spells are in Nerriak.<br/>
<br/>
Good hunting places include Ro, East & West Commons, and once you get a<br/>
little higher, Highold pass and beyond are all open to your reign.<br/>
<br/>
With your pet getting stronger and stronger, and the monsters hitting<br/>
harder and harder from here on in, you&#39;ll be doing less of the tanking,<br/>
but you&#39;ll figure that out soon enough :)<br/>
