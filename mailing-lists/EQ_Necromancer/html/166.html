<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-301340081">I&#39;m on the EQ Wizards list as well and a guy on there<br/>
had done some experimenting with it. From what he<br/>
gathered it is based on height and visible area so for<br/>
instance in a dungeon you arent going to go to far but<br/>
outside on a hill you will teleport a greater distance<br/>
and be careful around water you can teleport<br/>
underwater as well. Shadowstep casts very quickly the<br/>
little combo most people do is shadow step - gate<br/>
combo if you have enough mana. From my experience with<br/>
my Wizard I tried this and its true you go much<br/>
further the higher up you are. But you can&#39;t go up<br/>
only down and one guy reported of actually zoning<br/>
after a shadowstep. So next time your in a fight with<br/>
a baddie take it to a little hill or mountain and if<br/>
you get in trouble do the step gate shuffle.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I&#39;ve a question about Shadow Step.  I know it&#39;s a<br/>
&gt;mini random<br/>
&gt;teleport,<br/>
&gt;but.. I have some misgivings about it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  I watched another mage, while invisible, casting<br/>
&gt;their Shadow Step<br/>
&gt;outside.  It was sad, they hardly went a few feet<br/>
&gt;away from their<br/>
&gt;original<br/>
&gt;spot, and if they were being attacked, they could<br/>
&gt;still get hit by<br/>
&gt;whatever it was from where they went.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Though I guess, in a dungeon, it would be more<br/>
&gt;helpful, or is that<br/>
&gt;just<br/>
&gt;wishful thinking?  Also, how long does it take to<br/>
&gt;cast?  Faster than<br/>
&gt;Gate<br/>
&gt;does, or the same?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    Thanks for the info folks.<br/>
