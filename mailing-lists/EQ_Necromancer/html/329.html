<div id="ygrps-yiv-2006738385">Nope, still two bone chips, but often it takes me 6 to 8 simply to<br/>
get one I want.  At later levels bone chips aren&#39;t a problem because of all<br/>
the newbies getting bone chips in the Forest.  I pay well for them too.  I<br/>
usually stock up to 60 to 80 chips.  I&#39;ll summon, get a green one, reclaim,<br/>
summon for blue risky, reclaim, summon for green, reclaim, rest, summon for<br/>
blue dangerous or white and be satisfied with that.  Maybe I&#39;m being picky,<br/>
but with a new circle of summon I like to get what I pay for.  Summoning a<br/>
16th level pet takes 160 mana MINIMUM.  That&#39;s roughly about a third of my<br/>
mana.  Summoning a good pet usually cause me to sit back down and med a full<br/>
chunk again.<br/>
<br/>
	Alright, perhaps its better to describe what I do now.  When I hunt,<br/>
I hunt for the long haul, at least a good two hours or more.  I&#39;ll stock up<br/>
on 20 food/water and many bone chips.  When I get to the place (LAvastorm<br/>
currently) I summon a pet, med to full mana, then cast Shielding and Spirit<br/>
armor on me and my pet (well, Shielding and SA for me, SA for the pet), the<br/>
med AGAIN.  Then I go out and use magic as sparingly as possible.  Usually<br/>
against lava crawlers and nastier basilisks I&#39;ll hit them with both HEart<br/>
Flutter and Engulfing Darkness with other assorted stuff (SS, PB, etc) then<br/>
get in down and dirty till I lose a bubble or two, then get back out and<br/>
drain.  Then if my skel is at less than 75% and I am at less than 75% mana<br/>
I&#39;ll go rest, otherwise I&#39;ll find something lighter like an elemental or<br/>
weaker basilisk.  When I hit 50% mana I stop hunting period and go rest.  I<br/>
Mend Bones a lot on my skel too.  Repeat for two hours and barring horrible<br/>
mistakes or extra stuff jumping in, I&#39;m 10-30 platinum richer and maybe a<br/>
bubble or two.<br/>

PS - Fear is useful too when you get it off, but its expensive.  It lets<br/>
your pet get in free hits while the monster is forced to run and can&#39;t hit<br/>
back.  I&#39;ve found though that it works 50-75% of the time on yellows and<br/>
75-90% of the time on whites.  I don&#39;t see any reds in Lavastorm anymore.<br/>

&gt; Just curious, what does it take to summon a pet that makes <br/>
&gt; them expensive at<br/>
&gt; higher levels? Guess you need more than just bone chips, eh? <br/>
&gt; I -knew- it was<br/>
&gt; too good to last!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Its not cost effective at higher levels.  Later on your pets<br/>
&gt; &gt; start costing a<br/>
&gt; &gt; BUNCH and why run real far away and re summon when you can <br/>
&gt; cast DoT spells<br/>
&gt; &gt; right there and heal your pet at maximum range?  Abandoning your<br/>
&gt; &gt; pet is only<br/>
&gt; &gt; useful if you are running, otherwise its just better to <br/>
&gt; stick around and<br/>
