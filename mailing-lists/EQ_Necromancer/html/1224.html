<div id="ygrps-yiv-1511099442">Verant is going to tweak Screaming Terror so that it&#39;s all or nothing which<br/>
will make it a very good spell. As for charm that&#39;s fine it&#39;s a useless<br/>
spell since it&#39;s a low level charm spell, and charm overall is pretty<br/>
useless unless your a enchanter or bard.<br/>

&gt;wtf?  i think necros have the largest percentage of broken and useless<br/>
&gt;spells of any class.  not only that, but we have a huge gap in the number<br/>
 </span></blockquote>of<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;quests we can do, and too many items mimic our spells.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;BTW, is intensify death really broken. Feel kinda stupid casting it all<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;  time for the last few weeks.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;then they took away charm and gave us a worthless spell (screaming terror),<br/>
&gt;not only is it a &#39;why go to the train when you can bring the train to you&#39;<br/>
&gt;spell, but it only works indoors!  at least if it worked outdoors, when the<br/>
&gt;wipe failed it wouldnt really be as dangerous.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;and what were they thinking when they made voice graft?  i dont think any<br/>
&gt;class has a more useless spell.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;oh well, thats my rant =)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Also had a general question about experience and which is better to do.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;it better to solo a yellow spawn every other time it comes up (lets say<br/>
&gt;&gt;alternating with an equal level friend) or group with your friend and kill<br/>
&gt;&gt;each one and split the exp?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;you are better off getting 50% of two kills than 100% of one, there is less<br/>
&gt;work involved, and more safety.  also, you get some form of grouping bonus.<br/>
