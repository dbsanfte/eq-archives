<b>Subject:</b> dervish rings in south ro <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-323187752">Does any one know about the quest in south ro.. and the dervish<br/>
rings??????and what do you get for the quest? Is it worth it?<br/>
<br/>
I have learned a net trick. It only works some times. If you cast fear on<br/>
one member in a group the others dont att. but then when the fear runs out.<br/>
you only have the one come after you. It only work about 50% of the time. I<br/>
dont know why. Has any one else ran into that?</div>
