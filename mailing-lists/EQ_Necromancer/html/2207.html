<div id="ygrps-yiv-1297480189">Chief Gan&#39;Shralok is S A F E as you can get, but<br/>
little slow in Kithcor,  Cordelia Minster in NK is<br/>
good, but if you time it right you might pull a gaurd<br/>
and have to zone, but really good exp and the zone is<br/>
so close it is well worth it, and WHAT did was Lars<br/>
and Juhn McMannus, well actullaly just Lars, which you<br/>
can take solo pretty easy even if McMannus is not<br/>
begin camped, just pull him to the side with the cliff<br/>
and away from the barb lady merchant with  the armour,<br/>
and btw you can sell to her, pull with dark, run DOT,<br/>
turn you pets taunt off, sic your pet on him, then<br/>
Life Tap or SoP as needed.  I could usually get him to<br/>
follow me with out sticking on my pet, and used my pet<br/>
as a very effective dot, and would fear as needed. At<br/>
22 any necro worth his salt should try to take the<br/>
Treant in WK at the solo spawn, VERY good money and<br/>
easy to risk to kill.  But great exp up to 26, and<br/>
still good at 27.  eqnecro.com is a good resource<br/>
