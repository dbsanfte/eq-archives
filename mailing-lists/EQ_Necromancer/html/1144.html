  I am curious if they&#39;ve changed how you get Journyman Boots such as they<br/>
changed the Oracle Robe to a quest (speaking of which, does he attack DE<br/>
Necros?)?<br/>
<br/>
    Also, if so how do I get started?<br/>
    And if not, what dungeon is she in & where&#39;s it located?  I need to know<br/>
a level recommendation for the area & her, as well.  It&#39;s been awhile since<br/>
I&#39;ve heard much about them.<br/>
<br/>
    On a seperate subject.  I&#39;m 14th level and still wearing the Sr.<br/>
Apprentice robe.  The rest of my armour, which isn&#39;t much at that, are only<br/>
cloth items.  Greens can hit for 15, 20pts of damage, it&#39;s pretty sad.  I<br/>
know casters don&#39;t get much, but I know we get better than this.  Could you<br/>
give robe & armour idea, where one may find them, level VS item (such as<br/>
25th being typical for full Bronze), etc?  I&#39;m half naked, and I&#39;m supposed<br/>
to be a scary Necromancer. LoL  Nothing all too impressive about this. :-)<br/>
<br/>
    Thanks for the help.  I don&#39;t focus on leveling much, obviously, but I&#39;d<br/>
enjoy some new stuff.  Finally, at 13th level, I got my Runed Totem Staff<br/>
(for a higher price than I could&#39;ve I later learned, but oh well).<br/>
<br/>
    Thanks folks.<br/>
<br/>
    Currently, I&#39;m in the Qeynos area, but semi-soon heading back towards<br/>
Neriak.  Anything in these two areas would be nice to hear about.  I know<br/>
the Flowing Black Robe is in Najena in Lavastorm, but at my level I&#39;m pretty<br/>
sure this is a weeeee above me. ;-)  However, I would still like it.<br/>
<br/>
    Thanks for any info folks. :-)<br/>
