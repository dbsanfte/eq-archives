<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1854834907">Hello all, I recently came of my 24th seasons and I was wondering if hunting <br/>
the grown mammoths in Everfrost would be a good idea for my level? Also, do <br/>
you know if DEs are KOS to the Barbarian guards and roaming Barb NPCs-I would <br/>
think so, but you never know . . .</div>
