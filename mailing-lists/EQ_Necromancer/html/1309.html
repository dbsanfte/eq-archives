<div id="ygrps-yiv-2000381363">This is a bit off topic, but I can&#39;t seem to find the<br/>
answer.<br/>
<br/>
I recently killed the named gnoll in splitpaw that you<br/>
get to by swimming through the underwater tunnel. I<br/>
know lots of higher levels kill him, but for what? The<br/>
only unusual thing I got was a ruby pendant with a<br/>
meager +1int and no ac. What am i missing? Oh yeah, my<br/>
dark elven brother Nixx, proceeded to kill me very<br/>
quickly after I looted the gnoll. ;)<br/>

Thanks!<br/>
