<div id="ygrps-yiv-2051504073"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Im in Povar, New L16 Gnome necro, and cannot locate two spells; &gt;Banshee <br/>
&gt;Aura and Restless Bones.  Gnome guild doesn&#39;t have these.  &gt;Where can I <br/>
&gt;find them? How best to and get them?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>you get the words for them and either research them yourself or have a <br/>
higher lvl necro do it for you.  im L15, can anyone tell me how reliable <br/>
research is, and some tips to getting the most out of it?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;How best to control a pet, such as in Unrest?  While in the Castle &gt;in CB <br/>
&gt;it ran away and I lost 2 pets that way.  Would not respond to &gt;commands <br/>
&gt;even tho alive.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i hate my pets in dungeons; groups are much more reliable. pets tend to <br/>
wander off and bring every damn mob in the dungeon back with them if they <br/>
eventually find you.  if you dont see your pet, and it doesnt respond to <br/>
follow, its probably a good time to zone.  also, if you see the &#39;taunting <br/>
attacker master&#39; message come up, and dont know where he is, that is a sure <br/>
sign that once your pet gets killed you will have at least one mob gunning <br/>
for your little necro butt.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I found a L16 spell not familiar with; Spirit Armor?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>spirit armor is our first buff that doesnt hurt us =)  you can cast it on <br/>
your pet and others.  it has a +ac effect.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;And lastly, with Heat Blood, Engulf Darkness, and Heart Flutter, if &gt;all <br/>
&gt;stacked about how much damage done?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>dont know.  im not into exact numbers.<br/>
