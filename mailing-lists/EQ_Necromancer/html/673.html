<b>Subject:</b> Re: Curious on 8 memorized spells for lev 16 through 23 rd level play ers ? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-601636138">ah, but it would make us much more powerful, the 8 spells at a time is a<br/>
balancing effect, not a lack of proper interface.  I like to think that the<br/>
strategy involved in memorizing spells is what sets us appart from the big<br/>
dumb warriors :) I&#39;m not saying I wouldn&#39;t like to be able to mem *all* my<br/>
spells, or even 8 more, just that I think it would seriously give casters an<br/>
advantage, and reduce the need for tanks etc, especially for necros, who<br/>
already have the skeleton porta-tank.<br/>

&gt; i would really just like to be able to have spells ready in case of<br/>
&gt; emergencies, without hurting my ordinary ability to dish out damage.  for<br/>
&gt; example, i almost always have ward undead, even if there are only a few<br/>
&gt; undead around.  resting after a battle and getting attack by a zombie is<br/>

&gt; i also like to keep either gather shadows or gate on hand, but it would be<br/>
&gt; nice to have access to both.  also, i almost always use dark pact, and the<br/>
&gt; extra mana has saved my buns many a time.  it would just be nice to have<br/>

&gt; since we are already limited in our ability to take damage, i think the<br/>
&gt; versatility would help, even if it doesnt really make us all that much<br/>
