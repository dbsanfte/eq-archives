<b>Subject:</b> Can I get into Oggok or Grobb? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1617680884">I just made L13 killing lizardmen and basilisks in Rathe Mountains.  <br/>
Lizardmen are dark blue to yellow, and pretty easy. Basilisks are white to<br/>
red, and I can solo the easier ones and take any of them if I have a<br/>
partner.  It&#39;s fabulous experience and mediocre loot (occasional bronze<br/>
weapon), and never crowded that I&#39;ve seen.  The only downside is there<br/>
aren&#39;t many skeletons to donate bone chips.  I&#39;m down to my last 10, but<br/>
have another 100 or so in the bank, and I&#39;m also getting bogged down by<br/>
copper and silver coins.<br/>
<br/>
So, I&#39;m hoping to avoid the run to Freeport (though I can gate back, so<br/>
it&#39;s not that big a deal) As a height-challenged Bertoxx-worshipping<br/>
necromancer, I&#39;ve been pleased that I am (barely) accepted in Akanon,<br/>
Freeport, and Neriak.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m KOS to the bouncers (but not the merchants) ouside the Ogre and Troll<br/>
cities, so I presume it would be dangerous to go in.  Is it possible to<br/>
use a banker while invis?  If not, is is possible the bankers will not KOS<br/>
me and the guards will be far enough that I could gather shadows, go in,<br/>
bank, gather shadows, and leave quietly?  Has anyone done this?<br/>
<br/>
If this is as bad an idea as it sounds, is there anything I should be<br/>
killing to increase faction in one of those towns?  It would be very handy<br/>
to have a usable bank in the south part of Antonica.<br/>
