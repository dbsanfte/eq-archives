<div id="ygrps-yiv-1314265630">You shouldn&#39;t have any problem there although you you&#39;ll want to head over<br/>
to SK during the day to kill some birdies since the daylight spawns gnolls<br/>
that probably won&#39;t give you much exp if any at all.<br/>
<br/>
At your level, I spent a ton of time in Rathe Mountains killing tibrinn<br/>
ember (although he is too buffed now for anyone below 40 from what I hear),<br/>
unkempt preservers, giant skels, and ebon drakes<br/>

Can someone please give me the approximate levels of the undead at the camp <br/>
in Lake Rathe?I am interested in hunting here, but would not want to run all<br/>
<br/>
the way to LR just to find out that I couldn&#39;t fight there.BTW, I am level<br/>
20.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance!<br/>
