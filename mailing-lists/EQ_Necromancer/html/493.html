<br/>
There are about 8 Ghouls in befallen, MANY ice boned, and three Elf <br/>
skeletons.  Plus the assorted necromancers, their pets at their level, and <br/>
the Shadow Knights...<br/>
<br/>
At 10... NEVER go to the third level ... and think real hard about going to <br/>
the second.  (at 11th level with a 5 person party i died, then died 8 more <br/>
times trying to get my body back.... not pretty place)  <br/>
