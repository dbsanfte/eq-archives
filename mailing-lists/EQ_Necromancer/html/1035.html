<div id="ygrps-yiv-1592665727">James, this will sound strange but the mages are complaining about the same thing.<br/>
Their gripe is that other people are getting their components as loot, but not them.<br/>
<br/>
I can verify the fact that I have not yet gotten something for our class as loot. I<br/>
have pulled both Mage and Wizard components now though. Maybe this was intentional? Or<br/>
even more likely a possible mistake in who should get what in the programming. Who<br/>
knows really.<br/>

&gt; If could all of you send in a feed back in the game and also email varent.<br/>
&gt; That we would like to have something done about this shortage of words.<br/>
&gt; There should be some sort of system where if a necro is looting there is a<br/>
&gt; word, and if a wizard loots a ruin is there. Most of my friends are necro&#39;s<br/>
&gt; in the game so we are all fighting for the same words. Or heaven for bid<br/>
&gt; they might put words on vendors and just make the trade harder. I could live<br/>
&gt; with that. If we could all put are heads together and do this as a group it<br/>
&gt; could make a difference.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also I am level 33 now and not very sure what to hunt again. hehehehe I have<br/>
&gt; been kill druids for the past few levels. Now I am at a loss. Any one out<br/>
&gt; there have a clue at all. All I really want is my new spells.<br/>
