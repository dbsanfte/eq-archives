&gt; Jeeeeez.  Now I understand why everyone&#39;s pissed off (I am now in that<br/>
&gt; number, myself).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ok, so if the pet doesn&#39;t benefit from a reduced delay weapon.......is he<br/>
&gt; HARMED by an INCREASED delay weapon?  In other words, if I give him<br/>
&gt; something with a delay over 30, will it slow him down?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If the answer to this question is yes, I&#39;ll be even more pissed.....<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, he is not.  (that would be *far* too complicated for the Verant<br/>
&quot;engineers&quot; to code) ;)<br/>
<br/>
I saw a lvl 44 necromancer pet dual wielding spectre scythes the other<br/>
night.  Probably the funniest thing I&#39;ve seen in EQ.  The upside to the<br/>
whole thing, is if you need a weapon for your pet, any rusty POS will do.<br/>
Hardly compensation for the loss of power, but look for the silver lining I<br/>
always say.</div>
