<b>Subject:</b> weapons for your pet <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2035405977">Ok, the consensus seems to be:<br/>
Below 16, give your pet a high-damage weapon<br/>
16-23 (maybe 28) give your pet a low-delay weapon<br/>
24 (maybe 29) and up give your pet two different low-delay weapons<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen some pets wandering about with shields - is this ever<br/>
recommended over 2 weapons or a 2H weapon?<br/>
<br/>
More importantly to me, doesn&#39;t it get expensive to equip your pet every<br/>
time you summon him?  Ok, for those of you over L25, the cost of a few<br/>
dozen FS daggers is irrelevant I suppose.  However, I&#39;m seriously sweating<br/>
the 60pp it&#39;s going to cost to get my L8 spells (ok, 35 if I ignore the<br/>
less-useful ones, but still...) and giving up a 3gp rusty scythe is worth<br/>
it only because it looks so good.  Rusties are valuable loot for me - is<br/>
it really worth the expense to arm my L4 friend?<br/>
