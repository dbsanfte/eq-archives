<b>Subject:</b> Question about the Vampiric Embrace Spell <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1122242099">Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
I am a proud level 10 Gnome Necro in Freeport and I have a question about<br/>
one spell. Does anyone know how to correctly use the Vampiric Embrace spell?<br/>
I mean I thought it was like lifetap or lifespike (where you target your<br/>
opponent and you steal his HP) but with this spell when I target a monster,<br/>
I see I hand icon appear on my display and nothing else happens. Now I have<br/>
tried to attack a creature and sometimes when the thing dies I get some HP&#39;s<br/>
back but not all the time....<br/>
<br/>
Do I have to be bare handed for it to work or is there something I am doing<br/>
wrong?<br/>
<br/>
Any help with this spell would be appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
thanks in advance.<br/>
