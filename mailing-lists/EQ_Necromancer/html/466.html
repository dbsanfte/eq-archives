        /pet<br/>
            sit down<br/>
            stand up<br/>
            attack<br/>
            back off<br/>
            guard me<br/>
            guard here<br/>
            as you where     &lt;- I&#39;ve never noticed that do anything.<br/>
<br/>
    be _sure_ you /pet follow me after you tell it to sit, as it will not get up and follow you unless you do.  Thus, you could lose your pet, especially in a big zone.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
  Does anyone know a good web site or where I can find a list of the commands for your Skeleton???  and how do you make them use a weapon?  Just give it to them???   Is it better to give them a weapon for damage purposes? </span></blockquote></div>
