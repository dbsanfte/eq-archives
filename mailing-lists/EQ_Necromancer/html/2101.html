<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-749319749">Firstly, G&#39;day, just joined the list.<br/>
<br/>
Secondly I just wondering if you had one piece of advice for a young<br/>
necro what would it be ?<br/>
<br/>
Also, just a little background on me. I have been playing since March<br/>
last year, and have tried many classes some more seriously then others<br/>
(ranger 20, shaman 19, cleric 51, monk 35 and many others to around 12),<br/>
but after even a little taste of the necro it is a very enjoyable and<br/>
powerful class to play. Most of my chars are on Tarew Marr, but I have<br/>
played on a number of other servers including some of the Red ones.</div>
