Scowls at you, ready to attack is the KOS all the time message.  If you are<br/>
too high a level and they are smart enough they&#39;ll still leave you alone<br/>
though undead and elementals have a VERY low morale loss rating (undead in<br/>
fact never run I think) so they almost always attack.<br/>
<br/>
Glares at you threateningly is sort of KOS, meaning I think they have a<br/>
lower agg range.  In Rathe Mountains I can get close to preservers that con<br/>
this to me, but if I attack a bear or something while they are nearby or I<br/>
get TOO close they go into agg mode.  I think basically their agg range is<br/>
reduced and if you do anything other than walk/run by they attack.<br/>
<br/>
Glowers at you dubiously is non KOS but non vending.  They don&#39;t jump you,<br/>
they don&#39;t get mad when you beat on stuff (unless they are assigned to<br/>
protect whatever you are beating on) but they won&#39;t buy/sell anything and<br/>
they won&#39;t do questy type things either.<br/>
<br/>
Looks at you indifferently, nonKOS and will do vending and quests<br/>
<br/>
Lokks at you warmly is non KOS and vending and questing and means you are in<br/>
good standing.<br/>
<br/>
Looks at you amiably is the same only better.  I think this also means you<br/>
get discounts at vendors and stuff, but I don&#39;t know for sure.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m wondering when I con something what are the messages that <br/>
&gt; mean I will be<br/>
&gt; KOS by the NPC?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Scowls at you, ready to attack is kinda obvious... :)<br/>
