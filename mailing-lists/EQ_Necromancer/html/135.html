<div id="ygrps-yiv-1387767010"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Well... you can.  It depends on what god you are :)  There is a necro<br/>
 </span></blockquote>guild<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; there...  well hidden in a building in the slums.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    Hmph.  I didn&#39;t see the choice in the list, but then, I stuck with<br/>
Bertoxxulous.  Sheesh.  Couldn&#39;t they have spelled that some _other_ way?<br/>
It&#39;s not even in the instruction book (ha! big surprise, eh?), had to take a<br/>
note from the guild for the spelling.. anyways, I ramble.<br/>
<br/>
    But, I found the guild.  I also found a secret entrance to it from<br/>
outside of the city, through -- drum roll -- a false wall in the side of the<br/>
outter city wall.  You go in, and basically take any path that goes down.<br/>
You&#39;ll end up in the guild.  In case you&#39;re wondering where the entrance is,<br/>
I don&#39;t know exactly.  I just walked against the wall until I slipped it,<br/>
figured it&#39;d be there.  If you were coming out of the city, it&#39;ll be to your<br/>
left, and down quite a ways (after a corner or two, if I remember right).<br/>
You&#39;ll look a bit sillly, but if you really want to find it just do what I<br/>
done and walk against the wall until you&#39;re in.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; put a 34th level monster in that mix!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    Heh.  Yes.  After I lost my level to a giant spider (okay, so I got a<br/>
little too cocky but hey, the other giant spider and young kodiak didn&#39;t<br/>
help me any, either) and getting my cor, a Griffen thought I&#39;d make a nice,<br/>
if not somewhat thin, quick snack.  Of course, I _quickly_ offered myself to<br/>
the great beast (heh)....<br/>
<br/>
    I wonder if they were not somewhat pressured to put them in there, or<br/>
just plain demented.  In Qeynos, it rains, _allot_.  &#39;Course, as somebody<br/>
pointed out the Temple of Karana&#39;s there.  However, I sometimes wonder if<br/>
they&#39;re playing on first impressions (oh cool, look at that griffen,<br/>
awsome!) to make people immediatly go out and brag and bring in more sales.<br/>
;)<br/>
