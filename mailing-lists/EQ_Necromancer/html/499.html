I think that pets have the same level of knowledge than a warrior of the<br/>
same level. So you can give him any weapon you want, but you must know that<br/>
it will be lost for you. So if you have a huge amount of hundreds of<br/>
platinum, may be you can waste some dwarven battle axes for your pets.∩┐╜ :o)<br/>
About dmg, think about your pet as a warrior who maxed his skills. No weapon<br/>
-&gt; hand to hand, weapon -&gt; more dmg (but what about the delay ?)<br/>

Has anyone given any swords or anything to your pets?∩┐╜∩┐╜ I was thinking about<br/>
trying to save up for a Mino Axe if you can get the axe back after your skel<br/>
is killed.∩┐╜∩┐╜ Otherwise I don&#39;t think I will use weapons.∩┐╜ Or is it more<br/>
damage??<br/>
∩┐╜<br/>
Any info on weapons for your pets would be GREAT! Thanks!<br/>
