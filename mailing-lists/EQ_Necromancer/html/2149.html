<div id="ygrps-yiv-366519495">Re: The Harvester, at lvl 32, my ranger was able to easily solo him, so for<br/>
my necro, it prolly could&#39;ve been done at 29 or so.  The mutant eye fungus<br/>
thing was also pretty easily attainable for my ranger, especially since I<br/>
was being escorted by a lvl50 druid.  As far as the shadowed scythe, I just<br/>
happened upon a group that was camping them and they were kind enough to<br/>
allow me that 1 particular loot.<br/>
<br/>
As to where to find the goblin headmaster, I stumbled upon his island after<br/>
a cyc camping session.  If I remember correctly, the island isn&#39;t too far<br/>
from the sister isle, it&#39;s easily recognized as it&#39;s 1 of the few goblin<br/>
islands in OOT.<br/>

Subject: [EQ_Necromancer] L30, now what?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Made L30 this weekend, have a few questions:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1) any hints on the SolRo quests beyond what&#39;s on Allakhazam&#39;s<br/>
&gt; (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/quests/Q_Temple_Solusek.htm)">http://everquest.allakhazam.com/quests/Q_Temple_Solusek.htm)</a>?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For the Harvester, I need a shadowed knife, which is from a goblin in OOT<br/>
&gt; rather than a shadowed man.  Where in OOT can I find the goblin<br/>
&gt; headmaster?  Is he soloable at 30?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Any thoughts on shadow men?  Do all the items drop randomly off all the<br/>
&gt; shadow men, or are there better places than others to find the shadowed<br/>
&gt; scythe and eye/hand/mask of shadow.  Are there any camps that are<br/>
&gt; soloable or takable by a pair/trio, or will I need a full group?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2) where&#39;s good hunting (and good groups) at L30?  Sarnaks, goblins, and<br/>
&gt; forest giants in Warsliks and Lake of Ill Omen have been great from 20-29,<br/>
&gt; and it was always easy to find or start a decent group. Now those spots<br/>
&gt; are starting to green out.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I came back to the old world at 30 to try some of my old haunts, but both<br/>
&gt; cazic-thule and unrest have been very disappointing.  The unrest basement<br/>
&gt; wasn&#39;t bad except for the powerlevellers (2 different L50+ druids<br/>
&gt; levelling L20-L25 people) pulling past us and causing havoc.  Cazic would<br/>
&gt; be nice, except the three groups I found all had at least one complete<br/>
&gt; idiot in them, and we spent more time zoning/dieing than fighting.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Any advice appreciated.  I don&#39;t like soloing very much (too much<br/>
&gt; downtime, not enough interaction, and no chance to use our best abilities<br/>
&gt; like shadow compact and screaming terror), but I&#39;ll consider it since<br/>
&gt; downtime in a bad group is worse than soloing.<br/>
