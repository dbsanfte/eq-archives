<b>Subject:</b> Advice for a new Necromancer <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1210965344">Hello.<br/>
<br/>
I recently started a new dark elf necromancer on Mythannial Marr. I&#39;m a<br/>
whole lev 2 at this point. I haven&#39;t trained any skills yet at the guild<br/>
hall. Can I get some advice as to what spells to focus on? Is 2H staffs the<br/>
weapon I should be using?<br/>
<br/>
Also at what level will I start to get a good feel for being a necromancer<br/>
and start coming into my own? Are there any levels I should just gut out?<br/>
For example my lev 15 magician had a very rough time at lev7 but at lev8<br/>
things were MUCH easier. When I get lev 16 with my magician tomorrow or the<br/>
next day I&#39;ll again see a HUGE increase in power. I&#39;m assuming Necromancers<br/>
work the same way?<br/>
<br/>
Any tips would be appreciated.<br/>
