<div id="ygrps-yiv-1759690477">Actually, they capped the LT at about 5-6 levels above you. Since Vox/Naggy<br/>
are &quot;Officially&quot; lv 53, a necro would have no problem sucking them dry.  In<br/>
fact, I have a theory about this.  Get 6 lv 50 Necro&#39;s with pets, and 6 lv<br/>
50 clerics, and once the giants are taken care of, I think with the clerics<br/>
healing the pets (I&#39;d give them some nice, cheap, fast weapons,<br/>
bloodclaw&#39;s.. etc) the dragons could be taken with only a few deaths.</div>
