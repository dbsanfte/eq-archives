<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-866757078">Just wanted to point out, because it wasn&#39;t directly mentioned.  Giving<br/>
your pet fast 1h weapons won&#39;t do anything for you anymore, besides look<br/>
cool.  Their delay is fixed, and their damage has a minimum.  So you can&#39;t<br/>
make them any faster (except with buffs) but you can make them hit harder<br/>
by giving them the big 2h weapons.  The advantage pretty much falls off<br/>
once your pet starts to bash and kick.<br/>
<br/>
There is one other benifit of hunting down a magician for weapons at low<br/>
level.  I &#39;believe&#39; if your under 12th level your pet will not be able to<br/>
hit magicial only creatures.  While most magic only creatures will probably<br/>
kick a solo necro&#39;s butt under 12th level.  If your in a group and want<br/>
your pet to provide additional damage killing wisps and such, you might<br/>
want to find a mage to get some summoned daggers for your pet.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;I would also like to point out that starting at lvl 39 pets will <br/>
&gt;automatically dual weild so you don&#39;t have to give them weapons for <br/>
&gt;this.  Basically, giving your pets weapons after 39 is wasting cash <br/>
&gt;and weight.  However, there are certain circumstances where a weapon <br/>
&gt;is very beneficial.  Procing weapons can add a bit to the damage your <br/>
&gt;pet produces.  My favorite is the vellium weapons dropped by giants, <br/>
&gt;dwarves and such in velious.  Since delay doesn&#39;t matter and after <br/>
&gt;about lvl 16 dmg is irrelevant you equip your pet for effect on the <br/>
&gt;proc.  If you are hunting in nejena or the hole get a couple of <br/>
&gt;swords from your friendly mage as the ward summoned proc is a nice <br/>
&gt;little bit of additional damage (about 41pts).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The thing is, at least for necro&#39;s, your pet is very effective <br/>
&gt;without a weapon. So why waste the time, energy and cash on getting <br/>
&gt;it weapons?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;From levels 1 through 12 it&#39;s a good thing to get the biggest meanest <br/>
&gt;2 hander you can loot.  This can dramatically increase your pets <br/>
&gt;damage output.  At 16 you really need the high end 2handers like fine <br/>
&gt;steel to even get a marginal improvement in damage.  <br/>

&gt;/pet attack &lt;G&gt;<br/>
