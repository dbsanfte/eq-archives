<div id="ygrps-yiv-1802597956">Hehe, well, yes it works on KoS creatures as well.  Many halflings have banked in Oggok<br/>

&gt; Does it work with threatening or scowling creatures then?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And no, I wouldn&#39;t ready to attack you if you were sneaking behind me...but<br/>
&gt; I would certainly withdraw my offer to sell you my goods if I didn&#39;t like<br/>
&gt; you :)<br/>
