<div id="ygrps-yiv-350239155">I was able to make the spell.  But when using it I fail to see any real<br/>
improvement in the max damage the pet does, nor unusual amounts of hitting<br/>
for extra times per round, and also there seems to be no way to tell how<br/>
long the spell works, or when it ends?  The pet  had no weapons just hands<br/>
and feet. At the time I was L28, and the pet spell was L24, and the max<br/>
damage the pet did, with or w/o the spell, was 22 a hit.<br/>
