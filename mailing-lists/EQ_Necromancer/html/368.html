<div id="ygrps-yiv-714092830"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;imagine turning L8 and automatically being<br/>
&gt;able to do 38 damage to undead!  per casting!  bear in mind, tho, that this<br/>
&gt;is the necro&#39;s first evocation spell.  i camped out at a ruin in nektulos<br/>
&gt;and just casted it on everything that showed up, even if it wasnt my kill<br/>
&gt;(one hit wont steal the kill), just to cap out my evocation.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s a great trick I discovered: cast your spells on your pet to build up<br/>
your skill!  As long as you are not PvP, your pet will take it without<br/>
complaint.  I built up my evocation this way while waiting on the boat.  It<br/>
works for conjuration too. Just keep hitting your pet with disease cloud.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;another spell that i have found is under-used by our class is Dark Pact.  i<br/>
&gt;cannot go on about how useful this spell is.  ok- seems simple... it takes<br/>
&gt;your hp and gives you mana.  but now imagine this- you have just spent all<br/>
&gt;your mana, and are safe (and at full hp, or close).  so just find a safe<br/>
&gt;spot, cast Dk Pact, and hide/gather shadows-  you&#39;ll be back to full mana<br/>
&gt;faster than any other spell caster class.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here is another use I found for dark pact to increase combat effectiveness.<br/>
Wait until you are down a little in mana during a fight then cast.  Once<br/>
cast, start hitting with life spikes or whatever you have to do damage/give<br/>
life.  If you do this right, you can keep it up indefinately.  The damage<br/>
you take from the pact is repaired by the spikes while the mana for the<br/>
spikes is replentished by the pact.  It lets you get out a lot more spell<br/>
attacks this way.</div>
