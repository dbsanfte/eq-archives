to load as the servers move NPC and as players move around and have to be <br/>
relocated will cause some issues.<br/>

Ram and connection in my eyes are the 2 most important things. I am on a <br/>
modem but connect realistically between 45-50k avg. Sometimes I get some bad <br/>
areas of lag, like everyone, and FV suck big time! It is always always always <br/>
laggy and choppy, but move out of here and all is better.</div>
