<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-975629969"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I am planning on starting a Necromancer today and I have had no<br/>
&gt;experience using pets. I was wondering what hot buttons I should<br/>
&gt;configure in terms of Pet Commands and how and when I should use them in<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;order to use them effectively? I also plan on grouping regularly<br/>
&gt;(unfortunately, mostly with good races) and I was wondering if this has<br/>
&gt;any impact on my pet and how? Any tips you would be willing to give a<br/>
&gt;young first time DE Necromancer on BB would be appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Another pet command I like it /pet guard here  That one can get bad, because<br/>
your pet wont help you unless you tell it to. The reason I like this is for<br/>
when you want to pull monster to a very certain spot. As you are running<br/>
back you pet will run after it and engage it where you dont want it too.<br/>
When you get back to where you want it to fight you hot key /pet attack with<br/>
the monster targeted. This has worked well for me.<br/>
<br/>
 /pet sit is importain. For you pet heals faster siting.<br/>
<br/>
/pet follow me to make it come. /pet guard me is another dangerous one. Any<br/>
thing it think is going to attack you. It will jump when it get close to<br/>
you. Weather you are meditating or ready for a fight. Fighting oban Drakes<br/>
you never use that command for you will be fighting 10 or more of them at<br/>
once.<br/>
<br/>
/pet settle down stops your pet from fighting. Unless you or your pet is<br/>
getting hit.<br/>
<br/>
/pet report health very good hot key to have. &quot;I have 12 % of my health<br/>
left&quot; thats when you know you have no choice but to stay in battle and pray.<br/>
hehehe<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
now being a new necro you also need to know some tatics. I have made it to<br/>
level 24 this way. Stand far from your opponent. Dot them first with your<br/>
biggest dot you have then sick your pet on it as it get close. hit it<br/>
onemore time with another dot other then the one you just hit it with then<br/>
get in battle. hit it for a bit. When you are low. Step back and Drain some<br/>
hp. Then get back in battle again. Keep doing the engage.....  disengage<br/>
drain hp till it falls dead. Now dont try and kill it too fast. Alot of<br/>
necros make that mistake. If you dish too much damage too fast your pets<br/>
taunt just wont work, and you wont be ablie to step out of battle to drain<br/>
hp. but dont make the battle linger too long or yore pet is dead as well.<br/>
You will get the feel for this over time. Welcome to the world of the undead<br/>
and there master&#39;s US!!!</div>
