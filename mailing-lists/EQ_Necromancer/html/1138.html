<b>Subject:</b> Questions about the Water Crystal Staff <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-50815072">Do any of you know what MOB has the Water Crystal staff?  Or the Slime<br/>
Crystal Staff?<br/>
<br/>
I have heard that the WCS is found in Lake Rathe on a level 20ish MOB... is<br/>
this correct?  Does anyone have additional info like where he can be found?<br/>
<br/>
I know nothing about the Slime Crystal Staff so any info you have would be<br/>
helpful.<br/>
<br/>
I want to get a decent 1hd staff that looks interesting.<br/>
<br/>
Are there any other different looking 1hd staff(or any good ones for that<br/>
matter) that a level 20 Necro (with some similar level friends if needed)<br/>
could obtain... not that I&#39;m positive I could get either of these.<br/>
<br/>
Yours in hate,<br/>
