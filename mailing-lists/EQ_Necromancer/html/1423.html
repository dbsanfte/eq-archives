<div id="ygrps-yiv-1466791078">Your pet can make you rich.  Use it to kill mass amounts of greenies and<br/>
loot til your hearts content.  Try for high resale and stackable stuff.  If<br/>
you have the faction to walk into RV, then goto the lake and kill tons of<br/>
trout and the occaisional Pirhrana.  Without a pet I can make 2 plat an hour<br/>
easy and all the food you can eat.  RV lake is good for 6th.  You can even<br/>
turn in the pirhrana teeth for xp if you have the faction to talk to Fiddy.<br/>
Each trout usually give 2 fish as loot and scales.  They sell for almost 2<br/>
silver each.  Turning in the Pirhrana teeth gives you almost 2 gold each.<br/>
I&#39;m sure there are many areas where you can make fast money off loot.  If<br/>
you pick a good area, you will have trouble looting as fast as you pet kills<br/>
stuff.<br/>

Heh at low levels it&#39;s not required were talking more like 30+ where fs<br/>
weapons are common loot and people have at least 1000pp in the bank. This is<br/>
not somethig you have to worry about for awhile.<br/>

&gt;Ok, the consensus seems to be:<br/>
&gt;Below 16, give your pet a high-damage weapon<br/>
&gt;16-23 (maybe 28) give your pet a low-delay weapon<br/>
&gt;24 (maybe 29) and up give your pet two different low-delay weapons<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve seen some pets wandering about with shields - is this ever<br/>
&gt;recommended over 2 weapons or a 2H weapon?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;More importantly to me, doesn&#39;t it get expensive to equip your pet every<br/>
&gt;time you summon him?  Ok, for those of you over L25, the cost of a few<br/>
&gt;dozen FS daggers is irrelevant I suppose.  However, I&#39;m seriously sweating<br/>
&gt;the 60pp it&#39;s going to cost to get my L8 spells (ok, 35 if I ignore the<br/>
&gt;less-useful ones, but still...) and giving up a 3gp rusty scythe is worth<br/>
&gt;it only because it looks so good.  Rusties are valuable loot for me - is<br/>
&gt;it really worth the expense to arm my L4 friend?<br/>
