<div id="ygrps-yiv-1119307144">Well, before the lifetap line was unresistable by ANYTHING, but now since <br/>
they have added in the resistance factor, unless you have a lvl 50 ENC with <br/>
the highest version of the Tishan spell (quest one) Necros are basically <br/>
useless on a dragon raid.Heat Blood line is heat-based so thats never gonna <br/>
get off on Nagafen, half the time the Darkness line is resisted by BLUES, so <br/>
thats a no go, and since the Dragons are lvl 53, it would be pretty hard to <br/>
get off a lifetap on then.Just my 2 copper<br/>

PS-Some of my replies will be to some older topics as my computer was in the <br/>
shop for over 2 weeks!&lt;shudder&gt;Those were 2 very boring weeks, btw :)<br/>
