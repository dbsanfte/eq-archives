<div id="ygrps-yiv-1893974434"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; You might say that because humans get a 20-30% bonus to their<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; levels you are hurting yourself when you approach the level limit.  I<br/>
&gt; haven&#39;t even touched Gnomes yet, and there&#39;s no way to calculate the bonus<br/>
&gt; that having Ultravision fulltime is, as well as several other things<br/>
&gt; (location, locality, faction)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ultravision is pretty much negated at level 8, deadeye is the coolest spell<br/>
in my arsenal, all my human character friends are quite envious of that one<br/>
:)<br/>
<br/>
On an unrelated note, there seems to be enough of us on this list to make a<br/>
pretty well stocked irc channel, is anyone interested in starting one?<br/>
Putting up with public EQ chans isn&#39;t exactly my idea of fun, but realtime<br/>
necro chat would be quite interesting I&#39;m sure, plus just being able to get<br/>
to know one another.<br/>
