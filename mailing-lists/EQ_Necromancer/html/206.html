<div id="ygrps-yiv-1497023992">Ok concerning Runed Staves. There are Totem Runed Staffs found in paw off of<br/>
two monsters. Err or two spawns. On Spawn is like some Rexxon Rex or<br/>
something like that. He is a high shaman I beleive. You drop down at the<br/>
first bridge and he is up some stairs there. However beware of the gnoll<br/>
commanders and nobles. Rex is level 16. Next is near the five shaman spawn.<br/>
There is a door kind of behind it. In there spawns 2 nobles and inside that<br/>
little room are 2 more doors. The door on the left spawns gnoll captain and<br/>
a gnoll shaman. The captain is generally level 16. Then in the right door is<br/>
a named Shaman spawn plus a normal shaman and a noble spawn. The named<br/>
shaman has the runed totem Staff. They only appear once in a whiole. I spent<br/>
like 4 hours and only got 2. And those two were right in a row. This was<br/>
from the named shaman spawn. Occasionally a High Shaman Grisk will spawn. He<br/>
is level 17 I believe. But usually is is a level 16 spawn. These guys have<br/>
Runed Totem Staves. +3 int (I think) +30 mana (I think the bonuses I am not<br/>
sure on..only stats) it is a 9 dam 37 speed AND magical. That is same speed<br/>
but more damage then a minotaur axe but it is also double handed. Well that<br/>
is a good staff. They should sell from 20 pp to 30 pp. 25 pp is fair. I have<br/>
seen them go for 40pp which is a rip off. Go to the Karana plains and you<br/>
can get them for from 25pp to 30pp. I have seen level 25 wizards coming in<br/>
trying to get these staves. They are pretty decent.<br/>

&gt;     I hear some of the MOBs in the Karanas carry runed staffs, but they&#39;re<br/>
&gt; level 20 or better.  I&#39;m not sure which part of the Karanas they&#39;re in or<br/>
&gt; which mobs they&#39;re on.. somebody else will have to inform us on this.<br/>
Sorry<br/>
&gt; my info&#39;s so draft.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     Have a good one,<br/>
