<div id="ygrps-yiv-849025669">Griffon/Griffene are a viable solo option at early 30s. They may con the <br/>
same as HGs but are not nearly as hard. (Btw, anyone knows what level are <br/>
the Griffins in the Commons?) Cyclops in Rath Mountain can be done pretty <br/>
easy too, but watch out for the wandering giant skeletons and other cyclops.<br/>
<br/>
I would wait on Hill Giants though simply because they have a huge amount of <br/>
HPs and hit/stun really hard. A ranger friend and I are hunting them with <br/>
relative ease (both of us are level 35) as long as we get SOW before the <br/>
fight. The tactic we use is ranger track and snare, I send pet in and Invoke <br/>
Fear, Boil Blood, VoS, CoB, VC, and reapply fear as necessary while the <br/>
ranger slash it from behind and reapply snare.<br/>
<br/>
None of the above give much exp bec of the down time involved. But it is <br/>
exciting to be able to extract revenge and HGs routinely drop upwards of 30 <br/>
pps plus the occasional FS weapon and Lambent Stone.<br/>

&gt;hand out (oh yes, i remember every time i died... i have a long list of<br/>
&gt;paybacks.  i still mutilate the occasional shadow wolf; im sure they like<br/>
&gt;the shock of poison)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;also, there is payback coming soon for hill giants, sand giants, and<br/>
&gt;cyclopses.  what are solo levels for those?  oh ya, and my major payback--<br/>
&gt;Griffons!<br/>
