<div id="ygrps-yiv-2176096"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;i just have a few questions about hunting in the various zones.  i havent<br/>
&gt;played for a while, so i just want to see if my info is still relevant...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;a. can a 24 necro solo a giant skel (from rathe mtns)?  if not, what lvl?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Possibly, but I&#39;d get a sow to be safe. Would suck to get a clops on ya <br/>
while yer skel bashing<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;b. ive heard there have been changes to the lvls of the unkempt druids.  is <br/>
&gt;it too dangerous to hunt them at L24?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not sure what lvl they have become, but I think I read somewhere that there <br/>
red to a 40. Wouldn&#39;t recommend it<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;c. is paw somewhere i should avoid for a while?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Up to you, but I hear theentrance is tuned to a 30, and deeper in back where <br/>
you get summon corpse the mobs are about lvl 40 and some 50&#39;s have gotten <br/>
floored by them.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;d. have any other areas become good to hunt?  i was at the treants, and it<br/>
&gt;was rather boring.  i also only gained about one bubble of xp.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Treants slow? Man at that lvl they were the best xp I had ever seen, got <br/>
from 26-30 over a single weekend<br/>
