<div id="ygrps-yiv-81253681">DE&#39;s are indeed KOS in Everfrost.  Even though you MAY be able to solo some <br/>
of the lower level Mama Mammoths, Tundra Jack and Iceburg will bump into <br/>
you sooner or later and end you rather quickly.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry.<br/>

&gt;Hello all, I recently came of my 24th seasons and I was wondering if hunting<br/>
&gt;the grown mammoths in Everfrost would be a good idea for my level? Also, do<br/>
&gt;you know if DEs are KOS to the Barbarian guards and roaming Barb NPCs-I would<br/>
&gt;think so, but you never know . . .<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;This list is basically unmoderated.  However abusive language will not be <br/>
&gt;tolerated<br/>

The demon is a liar. He will lie to confuse us. But he will also mix lies <br/>
with the truth to attack us. The attack is psychological, but powerful. So <br/>
don&#39;t listen, remember that, do not listen.<br/>
