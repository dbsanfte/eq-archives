<div id="ygrps-yiv-525328355">Sorry if this topic has been beat to death, but my Specialization <br/>
in Alteration just went over 50 and I was wondering if that was<br/>
good or bad. I figured it should be either Alteration or Conjuration.<br/>
I really like the Darkness line and they seem to be mostly<br/>
Conjuration based.<br/>
