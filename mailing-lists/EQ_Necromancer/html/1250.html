&gt;all your characters are drawn from the same list.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The only trick I have managed to use is to create a social that basically says:<br/>
Friend2<br/>
/who all &lt;name&gt;<br/>
/who all &lt;name&gt;<br/>
/who all &lt;name&gt;<br/>
/who all &lt;name&gt;<br/>
/who all &lt;name&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It gives you an extra five friends to keep an eye on.  I suppose if you<br/>
have enough social space you could make a Friend3 social as well.<br/>
<br/>
What really annoys me is that if you start up on a 2nd server, your friends<br/>
list carries over.  How many friends do you have on the 2nd server that use<br/>
the same name as that of the first server.  Personally I wish the friends<br/>
list was specific to each server, however verant dosen&#39;t appear to think so<br/>
as I did a feedback on this quite a few months ago.<br/>
