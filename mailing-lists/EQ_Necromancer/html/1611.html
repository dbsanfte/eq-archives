<div id="ygrps-yiv-658729530">I haven&#39;t tested that either.  I have just assumed that it wouldn&#39;t work<br/>
since the patch said that they sit until they take damage.  Has anyone<br/>
tested it?  I want to try the disease type spells.  Since they stop the<br/>
healing, maybe we can use Disease and ST to keep them status quo while we<br/>
med back up.<br/>

Since ST is now a mez type spell, can you pile all your DOTs onto a<br/>
creature,<br/>
then mez it and let it just sit there frying?Can&#39;t test myself yet, cause I<br/>
don&#39;t get the spell for 3 more levels . . .<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance!<br/>
