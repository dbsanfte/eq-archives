depending on the Speed you get for DSL it is faster. ALWAYS. Ok a DSL is a 
static connection to the internet. You do not deal with anyone else sucking 
bandwidth from you. It is all dependent on your own connectivity. I have a 384kb 
DSL this is a low end one. I always connect at that regardless if it is 1am or 
6pm. If you go DSL you get the best DSL that&nbsp; are coming out right now 
reach speeds of 1.5mb this is faster then Cable Modem and is actually faster 
then ISDN and is almost as fast as a T-1 which rates at 1.55mb. But I only pay 
50 dollars a month for mine as where T-1 is about 600 or so. So DSL is better in 
a lot of ways. One when you turn your computer on you are connected. You share 
nothing with anyone. It is a completely independent connection per user. And 
last but not least Affordable. If you can get one go DSL it is better. If you do 
not believe me then check out DSL.com. Or hell Check out Bellsouth.net that is 
who I will be using and the DSL is 1.5mb. Right now I use Gulftel.net and 
connect at 384kb. I never experience lag unless caused by the server I am 
connecting to.</span></font></div>

best thing after ISDN, until ADSL came out. Actually depending on the DSL you 
get you can ever surpass T-1 a VDSL can connect at about 2.5mb and cost about 
230 a month but is a lot faster then T-1 static and is better then anything 
other then a T-3 or greater.</span></font></div>

  PM<br>Subject: Re: [EQ_Necromancer] Cable Modem question<br><br><br>&gt; I 
  have recently gotten the availability of cable and DSL in my area for<br>&gt; 
  about the same price. Cable advertises as being faster at peak times, 
  but<br>&gt; there is that &quot;slow down&quot; thing. I was just wondering what you all 
  think<br>&gt; would be better for EQ, cable or dsl. Thanks in advance

  question<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; FYI I use a cable modem and the &quot;slow 
  down&quot; experience of multiple users<br>&gt; &gt; being on is still MUCH better 
  than any dial up connection.&nbsp; When my<br>&gt; friends<br>&gt; &gt; are 
  over on weekends I easily support 5 people zoning, etc. at the same<br>&gt; 
  &gt; time.&nbsp; However I use comcast cable out of the Detroit area, it may 
  be<br>&gt; &gt; different depending on the company.&nbsp; I believe comcast 
  has a very large<br>&gt; pipe<br>&gt; &gt; to the inet supporting their users. 
  (Multiple T3&#39;s i believe)<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; I personally will try to 
  avoid playing eq on a dial up after playing on<br>my<br>&gt; &gt; cable modem 
  and friends DSL.&nbsp; I can literally see friends on a modem<br>keep<br>&gt; 
  &gt; backstepping while there connection catches up, etc.&nbsp; I have 1 
  friend<br>that<br>&gt; &gt; has a key to my apartment and brings his computer 
  over to play rather<br>than<br>&gt; &gt; deal with dial up.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; 
  These are my experiences.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Don&#39;t think that you won&#39;t 
  ever get lag though.&nbsp; Sometimes it is just<br>&gt; server<br>&gt; &gt; 
  side lag&nbsp; (i.e.&nbsp; Verant)<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;
