I gave up on my Necro and EQ. hehe I forgot I was still on this list.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve traded in my skellie pet for a lute, flute and drum in DAoC. <br/>
Been playing it in BETA since August and simply love it. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not trolling, just stating that I REALLY enjoy the game and <br/>
prefer it over EQ.<br/>
<br/>
I have played EQ since BETA 4 and have played a few characters. <br/>
A Rogue (when it was totally broke!), a Wizzie (That seemed to be <br/>
out damaged by mages all the time), and a Necro.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some of the problems that I had encountered with each.<br/>
<br/>
Rogue:  When I started you could not sneak AND hide at the same <br/>
time. People did not want to group with me because, they thought <br/>
that I would automatically pick-pocket during battle. While it was <br/>
possible then to do so and not see any messages, I personally did <br/>
not do this, but I got lumped in with the rest of the rogues anyhow.<br/>
<br/>
Wizard: Decided to play a Wizzie, this particular wizzie became <br/>
pretty popular since I like to help out.  However, I had to time my <br/>
blasts during battle or it was insta-death for me. But I took the time <br/>
to properly play a wizzie and I got good at it. I knew when to stun <br/>
and when to blast and when to nuke the hell out of something.<br/>
However, once I hit level 34, it was getting harder to find groups <br/>
again. At the time, groups prefered mages because their DD was <br/>
close to mine AND they had pets and damage shields. <br/>
Somehow they thought that those were more important that portals <br/>
and evacs. hmmpf, go figure. Up to this point I had saved many a <br/>
characters from exp loss with a properly timed EVAC, and I must <br/>
say that I NEVER left ANYONE behind.<br/>
<br/>
So basically the bottom line to this point is that I chose classes <br/>
that interested me, yet were never particularly good with groups or <br/>
solo.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhoo, I had made it to the mid level game of EQ, level 34, with <br/>
my Necro, I had all my pet spells and what not. I too found it <br/>
difficult to find groups that could appreciate what I could do. Part of <br/>
the problem was, that once I did get into a group, I really couldn&#39;t <br/>
DOT anything because they would take it down so fast. And if my <br/>
only role when I got to the higher levels was to only be a mana <br/>
battery for someone else, well that pretty much bites. <br/>
<br/>
Lets face it Necros typically will not get asked to join a raid unless <br/>
they just need someone to fill out a group. The bottom line is, that <br/>
if you are not a cleric, enchanter, tank, or blaster you are not going <br/>
on a lot of raids.<br/>
<br/>
Necros do ok solo, and ok in group, its just no one really wants us.<br/>
<br/>
I will say that I had REALLY enjoyed playing the Wizzie. Maybe <br/>
because it was at the height of my EQ playing career. This is <br/>
because that on the Bristlebane server before the onslaught of high <br/>
level characters (and I was on track to being one of them and made <br/>
MANY friends who later hit 60) that the name Naff Fyndhorn was <br/>
quite well known. But since abandoning the character, it has been <br/>
forgotton by all but a few old friends.<br/>
<br/>
Just my two coppers<br/>
<br/>
Nefrit D&#39;Pogrom<br/>
Honored member of the Teir&#39;Dal<br/>
34th Circle of Innoruuk&#39;s Chosen<br/>
Ill-Tempered Sea Bass Guild<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oskar<br/>
15th Order bard, Hibernia<br/>
Great One Guild<br/>
Palomides server<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Well, I haven&#39;t ever been on a raid myself, but as far as I know a <br/>
&gt; Necro&#39;s main role seems to be as mana battery, from what I hear.<br/>
&gt; Bah....when will people ever wake up and realise how good a Necro is? <br/>
&gt; We&#39;re low-maintenance &#39;cause we can heal ourselves and have spells of <br/>
&gt; our own that are better than the Chanter&#39;s Breeze line. We also kick <br/>
&gt; arse with our DOTs and to a lesser extent our DDs (SOP is awesome, <br/>
&gt; and the DD vs Undead line is cool too). And I consider the pet as <br/>
&gt; half a Tank. Yet when I go into a zone LFG, there&#39;s loads of other <br/>
&gt; people LFG too, yet they all seem to get groups and I don&#39;t. Once I <br/>
&gt; waited 5 hours in OT for a group and didn&#39;t get one. I know Necros <br/>
&gt; are apparantly so good at soloing but it does get boring and even we <br/>
&gt; have to med for some time if we use all our mana. And we go down <br/>
&gt; quick if we&#39;re being hit and FD doesn&#39;t work or we&#39;re oom.<br/>
&gt; Ah, just pouring out what I think here. What does everyone else think?<br/>
