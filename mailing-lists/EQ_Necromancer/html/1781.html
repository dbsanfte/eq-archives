<b>Subject:</b> Lvl 12 pet spell question <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1851954108">What is the deal with the lvl 12 pet spell?  I have a necro guide (from<br/>
Allakhazam&#39;s) that says the lvl 12 pet spell is supposed to summon a pet<br/>
from lvl 11 - 13.  I&#39;ve lost count of how many times I cast that spell at<br/>
lvl 12 and I was NEVER able to get anything other than a blue-conning pet!<br/>
<br/>
Have you all had the same experience, or have I not sacrificed the right<br/>
kind of chicken to the Verant gods?<br/>
