<div id="ygrps-yiv-1330495689">I am almost 16 (should get it tonight) and I have spent most of my last few<br/>
levels in Oasis and South Ro... with some time spent in Lavastorm.  While I<br/>
know I can continue hunting crocs and stuff in Oasis it is getting really<br/>
boring.  Anyone have suggestions on where to go hunt?  I am primarily<br/>
interested in exp... there are a couple of people I am trying to catch up<br/>
to.  Thank you in advance.<br/>

Yours in hate,<br/>
