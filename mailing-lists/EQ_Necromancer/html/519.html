<div id="ygrps-yiv-167955116">Its still hotly debated.  Basically as far as anyone knows, the only<br/>
thing DEX does is increase your ability to recover while spellcasting, and<br/>
THAT&#39;S IT.  How important is this?  No clue, I haven&#39;t researched this<br/>
extensively.  Basically if this is the case then you probably don&#39;t need<br/>
much DEX.  The REAL primary attribute is INT, through and through.  INT<br/>
directly affects how much mana you have, thus how much longer you stay in<br/>
the field before meditating.  We&#39;ve discussed this before, but basically<br/>
having as much INT as possible is probably the best way to go.  After that,<br/>
dumping your remaining points is up to you.  You aren&#39;t a fighter, so<br/>
putting points into Agility seems useless, most monsters will be hitting you<br/>
and hitting you hard anyway.  Same goes for Stamina, you&#39;ll never have the<br/>
hitpoints of even a Rogue, so seriously what&#39;s another hitpoint per level?<br/>
Say you&#39;re level 25 and have 25 extra hitpoints?  Well sadly level 25<br/>
monsters are probably doing close to 40-90 points of damage per hit anyway,<br/>
so MAYBE one more hit.  Don&#39;t get hit.<br/>
<br/>
	I might say its more important for wizards as they don&#39;t have pets,<br/>
but they should be in groups anyway.<br/>
<br/>
	Basically I know one solid thing.  Multiples of 5 in your INT is<br/>
good and the more you can get the better you are.  If you are looking at a<br/>
choice between a +3 AGI item and a +1 INT item you should take the INT item.<br/>
There are many  INT increasing items in the game for virtually all armor<br/>
slots garnering you probably more than 20 more INT points, which is 4 more<br/>
mana per level (and at level 25, that would equate to having another 100<br/>
mana to play with)<br/>
<br/>
	Hit the INT hard, then dump whatever you have left somewhere, heck,<br/>
maybe in STRENGTH so you can carry more.<br/>

<br/>
Why is dex our main attrib beside INT if we rarely go hand to hand?<br/>
(I know we have a touch spell, but most people say that is more for<br/>
shadowknights)<br/>
<br/>
I am mad I put my extra (after maxing int) points into dex now when I read a<br/>
million posts now that say Dex is useless.<br/>
<br/>
I mean from all I&#39;ve read AGILITY is 100 times better for any caster!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Please say it ain&#39;t so, and that my 100 dex (gnome) isn&#39;t a big frekin&#39;<br/>
waste . . .</div>
