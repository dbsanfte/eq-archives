<div id="ygrps-yiv-355412662">I agree with Fletcher, he makes a good point. If everyone took what they<br/>
had found wrong with the game and did some kinda sit-in about it then think<br/>
no one would do anything until the game was how they wanted it not how it is<br/>
made. This game is constantly going through changes, you knew that when you<br/>
bought it, at least I did. If we push Verant to do something instead of<br/>
asking them, they will most likely become upset and not do anything<br/>
petitions are a good start. I don&#39;t know about you I felt that are nerfs are<br/>
unfair maybe to balance us out I don&#39;t know there thought process. But I<br/>
enjoy the game yes it needs work but also so do a lot of things. I say if we<br/>
are going to be heard then lets do it civilly not like some barbarian. Well<br/>
I get of my bone box and let you think about it. Anyone has anything at All<br/>
then email this list and we will go to the source outside the game and lets<br/>
try to make a difference.<br/>

Ok, so a huge gnome showed up at the first organized sit in.  Now EVERYONE<br/>
wants to have one.  Do you honestly think Smed is going to show up to hear<br/>
ANOTHER group of whining players, regardless of whether or not their<br/>
complaints were valid?  No, he won&#39;t.  This would encourage people to hold a<br/>
sit in for every damn complaint they had (Monsters attacking through<br/>
walls=Sit-in! Price for bonechips on vendors too high=Sit in!).  The more<br/>
you use a tactic like this, the less impact it has.  Smed was wrong to even<br/>
show up to the first one.<br/>
<br/>
Your best tools for getting something changed are phone calls and mail.  Not<br/>
Email, that&#39;s easy to just delete,  good old-fashioned U.S.P.S.. Which would<br/>
you pay attention to more, a bunch of messages in your Inbox, or 10 50lb<br/>
sacks of mail being dumped on your desk?  /Feedback works well to.  It takes<br/>
effort, not drama.  I play a necro, a high level one, and I don&#39;t feel that<br/>
this warrants a sit in anyway.  But it does need to be un-nerfed.  All a<br/>
massive newbie death fest will do is piss off everyone that&#39;s not a necro,<br/>
Verant included.<br/>

This list is basically unmoderated.  However abusive language will not be<br/>
