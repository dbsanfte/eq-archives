<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Good Evening (well for me at least) My Dark 
Brethren,</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I have decided I want to do the quest for the Words 
of Darkness.&nbsp; I was wondering; 1) Do I have to begin (by hailing Vurgo) the 
quest before I camp the Shadowmen for the Book of Shadow? and 2) Where is the 
best place to camp the shadowmen for this specific drop?</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I know it is a rare drop and I have heard that if 
it is going to drop you will see it in the hands of the MOB but, I was camping 
shdaowmen this evening prior to beginning the quest and we killed 10 or 12 that 
had what appeared to be a book in their hands, yet when the MOB died the book 
disappeared and was not on the corpse.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Any help would be appreciated.</font></div>
