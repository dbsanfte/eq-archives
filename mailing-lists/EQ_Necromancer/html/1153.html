<div id="ygrps-yiv-1726241778">Shadow .... here&#39;s a little info. Use it as you need. Please note this is info from MY<br/>
server, your&#39;s may be different.<br/>
<br/>
Directions to Guk:<br/>
From the East Freeport map, zone into North Ro (or come through the tunnel from east<br/>
commons). Stick to the water side of the map (the left as you exit Freeport). Follow<br/>
the water until you zone. You will be in the Oasis of Marr. Again follow the water,<br/>
stop to avoid Sand Gaints if they are nearby. Just wait ... they will move. Follow the<br/>
water all the way to the opposite end of the map. Run up the wall there until you<br/>
cannot go any higher. Turn right and follow around the wall, then down behind those orc<br/>
tents, then along the zone edge until you pass a large part of the mountain sticking<br/>
out. There will be an open area between two mountains here that is the zone into South<br/>
Ro. Zone in. In south Ro, watch out for high level undead or madmen wandering the<br/>
desert. Follow the left hand wall ALL THE WAY around the zone. You will have to avoid<br/>
one Derv camp, and one Orc camp. Just go around them. You will eventually come to the<br/>
other side of the zone where there is a valley leading to the Innothule Swamp zone.<br/>
Zone in to Innothule. Leave the small valley and walk along the left zone edge again<br/>
along the water. If you follow the edge you will eventually come to a large cave<br/>
opening. This is Guk dungeon. If you pass that you will follow the wall around a bit<br/>
more and find the Grobb entrance (marked by Troll guards outside near tents and a<br/>
fire.) Check your faction by conning them as soon as you see them. Bind any<br/>
non-spellcaster that is not killed on sight inside Grobb. Bind the spellcasters outside<br/>
of Guk.<br/>
<br/>
Tips on Guk:<br/>
Don&#39;t leave the first two rooms until you know whats going on ... after that, don&#39;t<br/>
leave an area more than about 5 rooms away. It gets very high level ... very quickly.<br/>
If you hear &quot;train!!!&quot; either hide, invis, gate, or run. Trains here are NOT to be<br/>
messed with. Don&#39;t use a pet. And for god sakes don&#39;t let any run away from you during<br/>
battle. If you see high level Froglok shaman, run ... don&#39;t even look back. It sucks to<br/>
be charmed. And that&#39;s all I have to say about that.<br/>
<br/>
Tips on Equipment:<br/>
Get as much woven here as you can, netted if you can&#39;t. Sell any mesh armor to monks in<br/>
the Freeport area. Netted is about 5 gold per AC point, woven is about 1 plat per AC<br/>
point, Mesh is about 1.5 plat per ac point.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes people coming from the Qeynos area will sell wolfhide armor pieces (only a<br/>
belt, boots, and a cape). Try to pick up all three pieces for around 10-18pp.<br/>
<br/>
Try to get a full set of woven except for a robe. Stick to your senior apprentice robe,<br/>
or Thaumaturgist robe (from Befallen I believe). You can get a Flowing Black Robe later<br/>
from Najena dungeon. Buy any +int player made rings, golden studs (+3 int earrings from<br/>
Qeynos), and a +int necklace. Why?? They give you direct mana ... the higher your<br/>
level, the more you get.<br/>
<br/>
There are many nice specialized pieces for spellcasters ... Bracers, capes, gloves ...<br/>
etc. Look and watch for these. They can be quite expensive unless you can get them on<br/>
your own later.<br/>
<br/>
For your ranged weapon (although please, please never throw it ...), you&#39;ll want a<br/>
dagger of Marnek. The going rate is 15-20pp.<br/>
<br/>
For your held slot if you use a one handed weapon you will want a Skull of Jhen&#39; Tra.<br/>
The going rate is 20-25pp.<br/>
<br/>
For your main weapon if you have a piercing you will want a Dragoon Dirk, or later on a<br/>
Bloodclaw Stilletto. Dirk&#39;s go for 20-35pp, Stilletto&#39;s go for 140-200pp.<br/>
If you use one handed blunt or two handed blunt there are appropriate weapons ... but I<br/>
don&#39;t use them so I cannot help you.<br/>
<br/>
Tips on getting money:<br/>
You might be thinking ... how can I afford this? For a DE necro ... two words, Sister<br/>
Island. Take the boat in Freeport to the first stop. Get off in the water and swim<br/>
ashore. Kill lots of sisters one at a time. Loot only belts until you can barely walk.<br/>
Gate back. Sell. Repeat as necessary.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck on your eqipment and your leveling. Please don&#39;t be afraid to post here for<br/>
more information if you need it.<br/>

&gt;     Ah, good.  I&#39;m going with a Shadow Knight. Though possibly a gnome<br/>
&gt; enchanter, too, however not too sure about that.  Besides, she can probably<br/>
&gt; bind herself by now.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     I just dred the stinking run between Qeynos & Freeport.  There really<br/>
&gt; has to be a better way. =/<br/>
