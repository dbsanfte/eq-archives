<div id="ygrps-yiv-247497574">There&#39;s no good answer to that.∩┐╜ Basically any race that is a necromancer<br/>
besides a Dark Elf Necromancer will have problems anywhere.∩┐╜ The good thing<br/>
is usually you aren&#39;t KOS everywhere (cept mage&#39;s guilds and whatnot)∩┐╜ Dark<br/>
Elves are KOS in a lot of places and Dark Elf Necromancers have prices on<br/>
their heads in almost all places.∩┐╜ The good thing about being a Dark Elf<br/>
Necromancer is that you are fine in your city and the Troll and Ogre<br/>
cities.∩┐╜ Everyone will do business with you and no one is KOS.<br/>
∩┐╜<br/>
Personally I think its a matter of preference.∩┐╜ Non Dark Elf Necromancers<br/>
have access to a LOT more areas, but generally have a harder time dealing<br/>
with EVERYONE whereas Dark Elves are totally blocked out of some areas but<br/>
in South Antonica they have NO problems.∩┐╜ And believe me, there is plenty of<br/>
zones and leveling areas in South Antonica so you can level high enough so<br/>
worrying about guards becomes less and less a problem.<br/>
