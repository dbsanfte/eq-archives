<div id="ygrps-yiv-1622389125">****************************************<br/>
/pet guard me<br/>
/pet sit<br/>
&lt;run off and cast a DoT&gt;<br/>
&lt;run back and Pet should have stood up to come to my rescure already&gt;<br/>

1. Dont ever tell your pet to Guard me unless you are 10 levels above everything<br/>
in the dungeon.  By default, it is allways guarding you and if you are inside<br/>
its &quot;range&quot; and you are attacked, it will defend you if you are hit.<br/>
<br/>
2. I prefer to just tell my pet to /stand up instead of Sit.  When you have it<br/>
sit, it will take it a second or so to get up and start fighting... and a few of<br/>
my fights, that second is life or death.  Stand up does the same thing as /pet<br/>
sit (which keeps it from following you).<br/>
<br/>
I do believe there is a difference in guard area from sitting and standing but I<br/>
could be wrong...</div>
