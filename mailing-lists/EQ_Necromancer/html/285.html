<b>Subject:</b> Re: gnome necro in Neriak? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-222933475">As to who is welcome in Neriak:<br/>
<br/>
I know that I am quite welcome, even in the 3rd gate, and I am Human.  In<br/>
fact, the guards in 3rd gate are friendlier to me than the ones in the<br/>
foreign quarter!  I am a human necro who follows Innoruuk, so the other<br/>
human necros, I don&#39;t know about.<br/>
<br/>
There is one place I am KoS&#39;d in 3rd gate.  The ghouls guarding the Hall of<br/>
the Dead don&#39;t like me very much.  So, I go invis to undead to getr past<br/>
them.  In the Hall proper, I am very welcome and have done a number of<br/>
quests, trained, and even bought one of those cool gray necro robes the dark<br/>
elves wear.</div>
