&gt;  or can I melee w/ dagger and just cast it???   <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  If I need to unarmed attack to deliver this spell should I start fighting <br/>
&gt; unarmed to get that skill up???   Can ANYONE tell me how this spell works, <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>ANY melee (hand to hand, piercing, two handed blunt, or one handed blunt) <br/>
attack is useful for that spell.  It will RANDOMLY flare and do about 28 <br/>
points of lifetap.  (it will not go off every time you hit... just randomly)<br/>

&gt;  does the high Dex help to hit in hand to hand combat???<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It is RUMORED (no confirmation) to help with being interupted in spellcasting.<br/>
<br/>
why specifically they made it a prime for Necros is unknown to me.<br/>
