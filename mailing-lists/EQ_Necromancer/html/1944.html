<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1347206342">OK I&#39;ve started combining word into spells.<br/>
I&#39;m hanging around a 2/3 success rate so far.<br/>
I&#39;m lvl 20 & put all practice into it at lvl 20 that I could.<br/>
<br/>
I have a ton of words from a high lvl character I play.<br/>
<br/>
Here is my question:<br/>
How can we make &quot;practice words&quot; or runes etc ?<br/>
<br/>
A teammate told me to save the undead froglok tongues<br/>
from LGuk, and I could create practice runes with them ?<br/>
Then use the practice runes to help my research skill raise ?<br/>
<br/>
OK<br/>
I have 60 undead frog tongues.<br/>
Now what ?<br/>
How to turn the tongues into a practice rune or word ?<br/>
Any other items that I can use to create &quot;practice&quot; stuff ?<br/>
Any website that explains this ?<br/>
<br/>
Any further info on this is appreciated.<br/>
I hate to waste words.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you</div>
