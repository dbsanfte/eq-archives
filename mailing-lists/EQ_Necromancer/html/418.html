<div id="ygrps-yiv-396664368"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Where is a good place for a level 5 Gnomish necro to fight at?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>dont know about that part.  you are accepted in neriak, but dying may be a <br/>
big down point. i would get bound to the area if i were in your position <br/>
trying that.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Are Gnome necros accepted in Neriak to buy spells and whatnot?  what about <br/>
&gt;In the Necro guildhouse in Freeport?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i THINK they are accepted in neriak.  ive heard in third gate (the deepest <br/>
zone in neriak) non-tier&#39;dal might get attacked by guards; also there are <br/>
3-4 ghouls guarding the lodge of the dead (our guild house) that may KoS you <br/>
also.  im not sure- being a tier&#39;dal, these are just things ive heard/read.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Gnome necros arent KoS in Freeport are they?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i would stay far away from the wizard guild there, ive been KoS there a few <br/>
times (i didnt know the city and turned the wrong corner.  check the map in <br/>
the manual, and dont go near the T intersection closest to it).  also, stay <br/>
out of N freeport. ive been KoS there also, and that is where the <br/>
goody-goodies hang out (paladins and their type).<br/>
