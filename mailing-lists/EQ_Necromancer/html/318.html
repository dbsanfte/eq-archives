<div id="ygrps-yiv-280183068"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;     What reasons have they given for this, not giving us numerical values<br/>
&gt; for our mana ?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>   I believe their original intention ws to have as few numbers in the<br/>
game as possible. This meant not seeing your actual HPs, AC, ATK, etc etc.<br/>
However, in beta these numbers were all present for testing purposes and<br/>
when Verant made some comments about going to a non-numerical based system<br/>
people whined and moaned so they left things as they were. Thus, we see<br/>
some numbers and not others making things totally inconsistent.<br/>
Personally, I think they should take all numbers out, but I don&#39;t think<br/>
things are going to change. Too many people on either side would bitch and<br/>
moan at any little change. <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;         Maybe it&#39;s just the mood I&#39;m in, but do they strike you as pricks?<br/>
&gt; I mean, honestly.. they give us, in the spell&#39;s info, how much mana it takes<br/>
&gt; to cast it, but they&#39;re out-right refusing to give us numbers showing how<br/>
&gt; much mana we have?  They&#39;re just being pricks about it, or at least, that&#39;s<br/>
&gt; how it seems to me.  What basis would they have for not?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    See above.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;         Not to mention all of the other limitations, and the &quot;you&#39;re in our<br/>
&gt; world now&quot; that I thought was just a cool slogan, but now seems to be more<br/>
&gt; of another way to say, &quot;this is our world, we&#39;re in control, we think for<br/>
&gt; you, we decide how you play, where you go, what you see, and if you don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; like it _leave_ because it&#39;s _MINE_&quot; .  That&#39;s B.S., we pay for this...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>   Hmm... would you rather that we have the situation in UO where everyone<br/>
is a master tank/mage, can wear plate in under a weak, and there is no<br/>
difference between anyone? Verant has done an amazing job with balance...<br/>
look how hard Blizzard had to work to balance 3 races. Verant had a TON<br/>
more to deal with, and has done a very commendable job. Is it perfect? No,<br/>
probably not. But they are fixing things as they go along. Just give<br/>
reasonable /feedbacks without incessant whining and they&#39;ll be more<br/>
inclined to listen. Just remember, they are _not_ going to &#39;upgrade&#39; any<br/>
class/race in _any_ way unless it is a proven imbalance.<br/>
