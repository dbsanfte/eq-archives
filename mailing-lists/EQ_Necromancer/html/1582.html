&gt;  30 wiz&#39;s which would make sense since the evil eye took me down in 3 casts.<br/>
&gt;  I have 620hp and there is no 20 level enchanter spell that can do that much<br/>
&gt;  damage in so little time.  Looking at the 29level wiz spells there is an<br/>
&gt;  inferno shock that does 237 + 1 per level dmg, so 3 of those and I&#39;m toast<br/>
&gt;  so thats what it looks like I was hit with<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  All I know is he got off 3 spells and I got off 3 spells (1 VOS and 2 SOP)<br/>
&gt;  and he was standing and I wasn&#39;t.  His spells were fire based since I<br/>
&gt;  remember something about my skin igniting.  <br/>

used Ignite on you.  At 30, my wizard does 240... (so the formula is probably <br/>
239 +1/level over 29)</div>
