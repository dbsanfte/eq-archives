I&#39;m about halfway through L20, and I&#39;ve been in Unrest playing with<br/>
Dominate Undead in situations where it seems reasonable (indoors, pathing<br/>
bugs seem to make Slim run off and create a train for us fairly often, and<br/>
in groups without crowd control the charm seems to add more value than the<br/>
pet).<br/>
<br/>
Things I&#39;ve learned:<br/>
<br/>
Yellow/red Carrion Ghouls, Barbed Bone Skeletons, and Skeletal Monks make<br/>
fabulous pets. For about 15 seconds.  Then they and their friends pound<br/>
you to dust.<br/>
<br/>
Dark blue things (drybones work well)  seem about optimum as far as<br/>
getting good hits (much better than a normal summoned pet) without<br/>
instadeath waiting for you when it breaks.<br/>
<br/>
100 mana is expensive when you have to cast it over and over, and 200 mana<br/>
is cheap when you only cast it if your pet dies.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t bother with Dominate unless you have managed to research Hungry<br/>
Earth.  You&#39;ll need it when charm breaks.<br/>
<br/>
Things I wonder:<br/>
<br/>
Are there any good charm strategies I&#39;m missing?  So far what seems best<br/>
is to pick a dark blue thing from a multiple-pull, /assist the puller, and<br/>
send it in.  I don&#39;t keep pets between pulls - the group kills it once the<br/>
combat&#39;s otherwise over.  Should I be thinking fancier?<br/>
<br/>
It seems that in most situations, Slim is far superior to a temporary pet.<br/>
Is this other people&#39;s opinion as well?  Any clever places charm can get<br/>
you into that a pet can&#39;t?<br/>
<br/>
Is there any better way to break charm when we&#39;re ready to kill my former<br/>
pet?  Currently I use gather shadows, which costs 35 mana or feign death,<br/>
which costs 60 but I&#39;m no longer the first target.  /pet get lost doesn&#39;t<br/>
seem to do anything - is there a cheaper or better way to release a<br/>
charmed pet?<br/>
