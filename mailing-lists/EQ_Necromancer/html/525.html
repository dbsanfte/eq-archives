<div id="ygrps-yiv-346782208">Hello.<br/>
<br/>
I am curious to know if there are any tricks you can use to get your pet to<br/>
last longer in a fight via use of the pet commands. For example by backing<br/>
it off just before MOB swings ect? Seems both my necromancer and my magician<br/>
can benefit from any such techniques that may work.<br/>
<br/>
Besides the obvious healing your pet, I have found that fearing the monster<br/>
gives your pet some free attacks. With my magician I have found if I burn<br/>
the mob just right I can get it to strip off my pet and come chasing me, but<br/>
not at full speed. The MOB sorta takes a few steps, then my pet whacks its<br/>
back and it turns around and swings at my pet before coming for me again. I<br/>
find that in this special condition my pet does much better as its getting<br/>
some cheap attacks, the MOB is slowly moving towards me but I can easily<br/>
walk back between casts, and the MOB seems less effective at attacking my<br/>
pet over the time its walking to me. If I over burn the MOB coming screaming<br/>
towards me in full frenzy and I&#39;m in trouble.<br/>
<br/>
I would love to hear any and all tricks for getting your pet vs MOB to last<br/>
longer. Esp any tips regarding using pet commands during battle.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I am curious to know if anyone has tried to use GATE as a way to buy<br/>
time in a fight. IE some form of the following. Bind yourself near a zone<br/>
wall or some semi safe place. Then you go out and DOT a MOB then gate (note<br/>
your staying in same zone). Mob runs to you while you run from your gate<br/>
spot. When you see monster DOT again and gate. Repeat. Sorta super kiting<br/>
using gate instead of SOW? This is very lame for sure, but from a pure<br/>
strategy point of view it interests me. Though I admit I haven&#39;t tried it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any help.<br/>
