&gt;I was in SK and con&#39;ed a Treant he con&#39;ed yellow at 22nd now 23rd I have <br/>
&gt;not con&#39;ed any yet. But what lvl can a necro solo this GOODIE  LOSERS. And <br/>
&gt;maybe some tactics to fighting them. And also what lvl are the Millers in <br/>
&gt;Q. hills my gnome necro friend told me that he went from 24th to 29th <br/>
&gt;fighting them only (only problem he had was to get there spawn separated. I <br/>
&gt;am a no wimpy necro I love to fght yellows and reds (SOLO).<br/>
