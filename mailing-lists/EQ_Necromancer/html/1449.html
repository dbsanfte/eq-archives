<b>Subject:</b> approaching 20 <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2084377383">Well, my DE necro had just hit 19 yesterday and a short while later should<br/>
be approaching 20 -- would&#39;ve been much closer now if it wasn&#39;t for dying<br/>
twice during yesterdays war.  I think I&#39;ll be able to hit 20 quite esily via<br/>
DW crocks in Oasis, but after that I&#39;m hoping to move on.  Any suggestions<br/>
or advice?  Also I could use some info on the lvl 20 spells, which ones are<br/>
worth the plat, where they are and what I&#39;ll need to research.  So far I&#39;ve<br/>
only been successfull in researching one spell, and my research had gone up<br/>
only once so I do not put too much faith into it yet.  One last thing --<br/>
what would be some inexpensive +int earings good for a necro?<br/>
