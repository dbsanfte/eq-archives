&gt;Is the only way to make a pet attack to click on the pet and then say &quot;kill<br/>

<br/>
    You can use the command /pet attack , to make it attack your current<br/>
target. :-)  You can also bind it to a key.  Take Social (such as wave, but<br/>
not nessacarly that one), and right click on it.  A screen comes up that<br/>
lets you edit it.  Make the command in there /pet attack<br/>
<br/>
    Then all you have to do is click the button. :-)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;2) I saw some necromancer in Unrest and he had this skeleton w/ him and the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>skeleton would fall into a pile of bones after saying something like &quot;Taking<br/>
new form &gt;master&quot;   Then later the pile of bones would float back into a<br/>
full skeleton.   HOW WAS HE DOING THAT????<br/>
<br/>
    /pet sit down<br/>
<br/>
            Just be very, very careful to tell it /pet follow me , before<br/>
you start walking again.  If you don&#39;t, the pet will stay there where it<br/>
&quot;sat&quot;.  You don&#39;t have to tell it to /pet stand up , just /pet follow me ,<br/>
which will make it stand up and begin following once you&#39;re a certain<br/>
distance from it.<br/>
