<div id="ygrps-yiv-789032197">Why do they have to put the actual number of how much mana you have? if you <br/>
can&#39;t cast the spell then you can&#39;t cast it. You know by testing, and if you <br/>
are any good then you already know about how much you can cast before you run <br/>
out. I think you need to just calm down, and then think about what you <br/>
posted. The slogan is cool, and you obviously liked the game for atleast a <br/>
little bit otherwise you wouldn&#39;t have bought it. Oh ya, if you don&#39;t like <br/>
the game, quit. We don&#39;t need pricks like you ruining the play of others.<br/>
