<div id="ygrps-yiv-73756117">I have a lvl 24 Erudite Necromancer buddy.  He was first KOS in Qeynos for a<br/>
little while, but after spending about 4 lvls in BB killing nothing but<br/>
gnolls the guards and vendors accepted him and they even sold and bought<br/>
from him.  He used Gather Shadows to get past the guards at lvl 8 to get to<br/>
BB (note: the Corporal guard can see thru invis and he will whack ya, that<br/>
is until your faction changes.).  Now with the Drow Necro, i do not know if<br/>
it is possible to have a town accept ya or not, i shall find out, hvaen&#39;t<br/>
been to any town really besides the evil ones with my necro.  I shall be<br/>
posting again with my results.<br/>
<br/>
I shall consume all that is living and feed off of its energy.  Death is but<br/>
my follower.<br/>

&gt;Hi all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have a question for all you long time Necromancers...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My first (non-beta) EQ persona is a level 17 Wood Elf Ranger; however, I<br/>
&gt;recently started an Erudite Necromancer.  I like playing as a Necro so far<br/>
&gt;(only level 3) and want to start putting more time into him; however, I<br/>
 </span></blockquote>have<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;a question.  Should I keep playing as an Erudite or should I change to a<br/>
&gt;Dark Elf?  The main problem that I have with Erudites is that no one will<br/>
&gt;sell to you in your own city except your guild.  I am also under the<br/>
&gt;impression that because you are a Necro you are KOS pretty much everywhere<br/>
&gt;(is this correct?).  If this is true then it would seem that a Dark Elf is<br/>
&gt;better since you have a whole starting city to operate from and since a<br/>
&gt;Necro is KOS anyway being a Dark Elf wouldn&#39;t be any more of a<br/>
 </span></blockquote>disadvantage.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;The only advantage that I see with Erudites is a slightly higher starting<br/>
&gt;INT but this can be offset by putting almost all your extra points into INT<br/>
&gt;(or is there some other stat you really need to be higher?).  As another<br/>
&gt;question can an Erudite necro travel safely through the evil race cities or<br/>
&gt;are they KOS everywhere (basically are they considered to be part of an<br/>
 </span></blockquote>evil<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;race even though they are Erudites)?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As I said I haven&#39;t invested a lot of time in my Necro yet so if I&#39;m going<br/>
&gt;to change I want to do it soon.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thank you<br/>
&gt;<br/>
