Here it goes:<br/>
<br/>
Quote from Gordon or Brad, &quot;You get 100xp from a mob,<br/>
it&#39;s up to you to enhance your exp.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Pets always get a share of the experience. If the pet<br/>
owner is in a group, they take up to 1% of the group<br/>
experience. If the pet owner is solo, they take much<br/>
much more. In other words, don&#39;t tell that magician<br/>
&quot;Axe the pet&quot; if all you are worried about is<br/>
experience. <br/>
<br/>
-Gordon&quot;<br/>
<br/>
(Shevil: Pet takes much more exp when soloing &#39;Unless&#39;<br/>
the caster gets the killing blow when solo.)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;There is a bonus to experience given depending on how<br/>
many in your group, but that bonus is linear. You<br/>
don&#39;t receive an extra kick of XP for having 6 people<br/>
as opposed to 5, other than the straight linear bonus.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But I would like to take this opportunity to see if I<br/>
can explain exactly how grouping is more efficient.<br/>
This will take a few assumptions, but I think you&#39;ll<br/>
see that it&#39;s valid in the end. My figures here are<br/>
very round, but are applicable in any situation. <br/>
<br/>
Suppose you have a warrior with 100HP, who can deal<br/>
damage at 50HP per minute. Furthermore, you are<br/>
fighting gnolls with 100HP, who can deal 25HP&#39;s damage<br/>
per minute, and pay 100XP points. Let&#39;s say your rule<br/>
is that you fight until 50% health then heal to full<br/>
before fighting again. <br/>
<br/>
Ok, fight 1. It takes you two minutes to kill the<br/>
gnoll. After the fight you have 100XP points, and are<br/>
down to 50HP health. Since you decided to rest to full<br/>
health when reaching 50%, you&#39;ll have to rest 150<br/>
seconds (2.5 minutes) before you can kill again. Let&#39;s<br/>
just suppose that you don&#39;t heal while in combat to<br/>
make the math easier. Your total yield is 100XP/4.5<br/>
minutes, or 22XP/Min. <br/>
<br/>
Now, let&#39;s try two warriors, same rules, same level,<br/>
damage spread equally. <br/>
<br/>
Fight 1: <br/>
<br/>
You and your partner take down the gnoll in 1 minute<br/>
instead of two, since there are two of you. The gnoll<br/>
only was able to deal 25 pts of damage during this<br/>
time, which, spread between the two of you, puts you<br/>
each at 87 health. Since you are now in a group, the<br/>
gnoll gave 110 XP instead of 100, but it&#39;s split<br/>
between the two of you, so you get 60 each. Here&#39;s the<br/>
outcome after fight 1: <br/>
<br/>
Health Remaining: 87 <br/>
XP Earned: 60 <br/>
Time Elapsed: 1 Minutes  <br/>
<br/>
After Fight 2: <br/>
<br/>
Health Remaining: 75 <br/>
XP Earned: 120 <br/>
Time Elapsed: 2 Minutes  <br/>
<br/>
After Fight 3: <br/>
<br/>
Health Remaining: 63 <br/>
XP Earned: 180 <br/>
Time Elapsed: 3 Minutes  <br/>
<br/>
After Fight 4: <br/>
<br/>
Health Remaining: 50 <br/>
XP Earned: 240 <br/>
Time Elapsed: 4 Minutes  <br/>
<br/>
Now, since you are both at half health, it will take<br/>
2.5 minutes to rest to full health, giving you a total<br/>
yield of 240XP/6.5 minutes, or 37XP/Min. <br/>
<br/>
Of course the actual figures will differ according to<br/>
class and level, but the principle still applies. If<br/>
you group, you get more experience, providing you take<br/>
things harder and/or faster than you could solo. <br/>
<br/>
All of that said, yes, some people like to group,<br/>
others don&#39;t. Regardless, EQ is and will remain a<br/>
group-oriented game. Some classes have been made to be<br/>
more suited to soloing than others, and if you want to<br/>
get by through soloing exclusively, you&#39;ll have to be<br/>
one of those. <br/>
<br/>

I&#39;ll give 3 models concerning my experiences with<br/>
Travis Two Tone in Nek.<br/>
<br/>
1: <br/>
<br/>
Pet attacks Travis.<br/>
I use very few spells to kill Travis.<br/>
He does not cause any or much damage to me.<br/>
Killing blow by me or pet.<br/>
<br/>
Equals: Little to no exp registered. <br/>
<br/>
2:<br/>
<br/>
Pet attacks Travis.<br/>
I use many spells to kill Travis.<br/>
He causes 50% or more damage to me.<br/>
Killing blow by the pet.<br/>
<br/>
Equals: Ok exp 1/16th to 1/8th of a bub.<br/>
<br/>
3:<br/>
<br/>
Pet attacks Travis<br/>
I use many spells to kill Travis.<br/>
He causes 50% or more damage to me.<br/>
Killing blow by me.<br/>
<br/>
Equals: 1/4th to 1/3 a bub of EXP.<br/>
<br/>
Thoes are the facts from a them 23rd lvl Necro.<br/>
<br/>
And I think he&#39;s a Monk... he doesn&#39;t throw and songs<br/>
about to buff himself, and he hits like a tank.<br/>

&gt; Are you saying you HAVE to do over half the damage<br/>
&gt; to get the max <br/>
&gt; experience?  I have never ever heard of this, and it<br/>
&gt; has not been my <br/>
&gt; experience after months of playing this game.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It may or may not be true (no matter what casters<br/>
&gt; realm says) that using a <br/>
&gt; pet reduces the ep you get from a kill.  But it is<br/>
&gt; certainly not true that <br/>
&gt; you get even less ep if your pet does over half the<br/>
&gt; damage.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Or, are you saying that the bard has to do a little<br/>
&gt; damage to you to get <br/>
&gt; the max. ep?  If so, that is another new one on me.<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;That is exactly what I&#39;m saying.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;If I kill him quick with my pet and spells, not<br/>
&gt; &gt;letting him touch me (much), I&#39;ll only get a<br/>
&gt; fraction<br/>
&gt; &gt;of a bub(miniscule exp).  If I take a good amount<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt;damage I get one fourth to one third a bub of<br/>
&gt; &gt;EXPERIENCE.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;This making him more desirable to hunt.  for the<br/>
&gt; long<br/>
&gt; &gt;spawn time...however this was an incidental thing<br/>
&gt; &gt;where Verant is concerned.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;This is all academic as eq casters has put out a<br/>
&gt; &gt;damage vs. exp formula.  You can now &#39;enhance&#39; your<br/>
&gt; &gt;exp if you know what you&#39;re doing.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;At lvl 23 I camped him for 4 hours, (Any one on<br/>
&gt; &gt;bertoxx in NEK will testify) : ), I got 3+ bubs out<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt;his day dwelling butt about 2 days ago to make lvl<br/>
&gt; 24.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Let me know if that didn&#39;t make sense I&#39;ll try to<br/>
&gt; &gt;clear it up further.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m not sure I follow this.  You&#39;re saying you<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; 1/4 to 1/3 of a bubble<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; if you let him beat on you a bit before you<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; him off, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; significantly less if you kill him quickly?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; This is the first I&#39;ve heard of this particular<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; piece of lore, and I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; quite suspicious.  Is it possible that the times<br/>
&gt; you<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; take the hits you<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; (and your DOTs) do more than 1/2 the damage and<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; times you kill him<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; more quickly your pet does more than 1/2?<br/>
