<b>Subject:</b> RE: Question about Mistmoore <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-763022858">Well, according to some friends that went there (and from other things I<br/>
have heard) at least some things give a negative faction hit against<br/>
queencristothex (or something like that)... Whatever it actually is I<br/>
believe this is the same faction(unless there is a very slight spelling<br/>
difference) that goes UP when you do the Tier&#39;Dal Necro quests (in addition<br/>
to thedead and maybe some others).  Also I remember when speaking to various<br/>
NPCs in the Lodge, them talking about being faithful servants of our queen.<br/>
This leads me to believe that Queen whatshername is the Queen of the<br/>
Tier&#39;Dal.<br/>
<br/>
Now you may never notice a difference in how the people in the Lodge regard<br/>
you after taking lots of hits to the queen faction (since they are part of<br/>
the dead faction).  Currently the Tier&#39;Dal King and Queen are not in the<br/>
game (as far as I know at least); however, since we are supposed to be her<br/>
servants it would seem to be a bad idea to have bad faction with her at<br/>
least as far as role playing goes.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, just because she isn&#39;t around now doesn&#39;t mean she won&#39;t be in<br/>
the future (or at least that faction) and I really don&#39;t want to screw up<br/>
one of my few good factions since that might screw me over in the future<br/>
(i.e. Friend: Hey look they just added the Tier&#39;Dal queen and she gives some<br/>
great quests for high level items Me: well I&#39;m KoS to the queen now cause I<br/>
spent time in Mistmoore... guess I can&#39;t do the quests... or I have to get<br/>
10000000 fire beetle eyes)<br/>
<br/>
Now most of this is just guessing from little pieces of information picked<br/>
up in the game.  This leads me to a rant:  Why don&#39;t we KNOW this stuff???<br/>
If I&#39;m a Tier&#39;Dal Necromancer I sure as hell should know who my queen is,<br/>
who are our allies, and who are our enemies and not have to make guesses as<br/>
to all this information.  Some of this is obvious but far too much of it<br/>
isn&#39;t.  The only way to figure out what something is aligned to is to kill<br/>
it and see the faction hits it gives.. then you have to know what those<br/>
factions are.. most of which aren&#39;t obvious.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, any more information would be appreciated.<br/>

I don&#39;t know where you heard this but I have never been affected by hunting<br/>
in mistmoore. Of course the choice is yours but I don&#39;t know anybody who has<br/>
been affected by hunting there.<br/>
