<div id="ygrps-yiv-1947061155">Well first off, you are not kos in all of freeport, i think it is just near<br/>
the paladin and cleric guild.  I always go the nro to freeport way to get on<br/>
boat and never have had a problem, but you can stand on the dock all day<br/>
long and no npc will bother you. DE&#39;s have a deal with the freeport militia<br/>
that is why we can walk freely around (for the most part).<br/>
<br/>
Once you get on the boat, sister island is the first stop.  I hunted there a<br/>
lot at your level and made quite a bit of money :)  My favorite spot to set<br/>
up on the island looks like a little tear drop coming off the island where<br/>
none of the sisters go, so I could always med or pull to this area with no<br/>
problem.  As soon as the boat turns and is lined up the edge of the island<br/>
on the right, I would jump off the boat and swim to this point and commence<br/>
with the slaughtering.  You are kos to the people at the dock, so stay away.<br/>

I am a lvl 13 DE necro and was wanting to make a trip to the Sister Ise in<br/>
OOT.  My question is how hard of a trip is this for a DE to make,  am I KOS<br/>
in Freeport etc.  Also is the isle the first one that the boat stops at or<br/>
will I have to swim?  Any other advice will also be welcomed :)<br/>
