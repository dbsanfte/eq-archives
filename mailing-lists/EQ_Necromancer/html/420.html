&gt;&gt;Where is a good place for a level 5 Gnomish necro to fight at?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I headed for grobb at level 5. its awsome. The froglocks in guk there have<br/>
woven and nettled armor. You cant take then right away, but there are alot<br/>
of thing there that you can that are good ex. Also trolls are fun to be<br/>
with. Also there isnt much fighting for bone chips so its easy to get them.<br/>
Not meny pets there so your sence undead works well.<br/>
<br/>
I have saved 85 plat in a very short time and gone up 6 levels in just over<br/>
a week. Hope this helps! Good luck.</div>
