<div id="ygrps-yiv-554240667">I know that Screaming Terror could now be used in a mezmerize/run away type <br/>
of tactic, and if you pulled two MOBs you could mez one and try and kill the <br/>
other as quickly as possible, but I was wondering if someone could give up <br/>
any additional uses for this spell now that it has changed?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance!<br/>

&lt;&lt; &gt;Screaming Terror (Necromancer) has changed. It is no longer a &quot;Run Away&quot;<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply">  &gt;Fear spell - instead the targeted creature will cower in terror until it<br/>
 &gt;takes damage (similar to the Enchanter&#39;s Mesmerize spell). The Environment<br/>
 &gt;limit (Dungeons only) has been removed.<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt;This rocks!! &gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>
