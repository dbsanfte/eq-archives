 </span></blockquote>Well, you picked a race/class combo thats a little harder to play but it can be done.<br/>
First there are two ways you can do:<br/>
- Stay until lvl 8 in odus, get invis spell<br/>
- or if you want to explore go to queynos but beware ! If the ship docks jump into the<br/>
water there should be a secret entrance to the sewers (i dont know where exactlly)<br/>
Theres a little town in the sewers where you can get all necessary things.<br/>
Further you should find somebody to bind you in the north queynos area.<br/>
To get your faction up with the queynos guards you should go to BlackBurrow and kill<br/>
some gnolls (a lot) also dont forget to cast that steal strength spell on other gnolls<br/>
that are killed by others. (help them and get a good faction hit, for the little mana<br/>
use a good deal)<br/>
The Necro quests i hear and tried are crap. Dont waste your time on them.<br/>
Armor ? you are kidding ? hehe well try some cloth armor or when you are better get<br/>
some woven or netted armor.<br/>
Weapon ? If you are lucky someone sells a giant snake fang in your area (good piercing<br/>
weapon in the beginning) Or you can try to get your hands on a 2 h blunt weapon. (most<br/>
of the better weapons are 2 h blunt)<br/>
You can also try to train all weapon skills you can use. They go up pretty fast because<br/>
of your high int.<br/>
<br/>
Other thing you should consider: You will be allways killed on sight.<br/>
<br/>
bye</div>
