<div id="ygrps-yiv-468772040">It&#39;s great to see this list finally taking off. <br/>
<br/>
On a separate note, seems like there is a few Quellious necromancers in<br/>
the teen levels. Perhaps we should join up one day and form a &quot;super<br/>
group&quot;? I&#39;d love to see what 6 necros with 6 pets and lifedrains could<br/>
do.<br/>

&gt; I have noticed that there are currently 163 members<br/>
&gt; on this list.  For this amount of people we should<br/>
&gt; be seeing a lot more activity.  Lets try to keep<br/>
&gt; this list going by helping each other out.  Even if<br/>
&gt; you don&#39;t have a question, just let us know how<br/>
&gt; things are going in game or let us know how your<br/>
&gt; gaming has been going so far.  I think one way to do<br/>
&gt; this is everyone should send in a mail with their<br/>
&gt; characters info (Name, Level, Race, Server, etc.). <br/>
&gt; This would help the rest of us to see who all is on<br/>
&gt; our individual servers and hopefully make friends to<br/>
&gt; adventure with.  I guess I will start this off since<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s my idea.<br/>
