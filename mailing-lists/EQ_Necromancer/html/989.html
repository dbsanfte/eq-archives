<div id="ygrps-yiv-888218087">Actually you can bind in East Freeport without worrying aout being killed that is the corrupt guard side of freeport and even without raising faction you can walk right on in. As for NPC Vendors they could not be merchants as killing merchants in game results in the dissapearance of the vendor&#39;s corpse and no exp just a faction cut. Any merchant in the game is worthless to kill.<br/>

You kill the NPC vendors on the sister island in OOT?  I thought they were<br/>
higher level than that.  Playing a dark elf necro and binding yourself in<br/>
Freeport is not something I would do, even if I killed &quot;one MILLION&quot; orcs.<br/>
<br/>
My 2 cents as I am also search for a place to hunt at 14.  Lavasotrm is good-<br/>
even killed several fire elementals and rock dervs.  But the place that I camped<br/>
I kept getting trained by everything- Fire ele&#39;s, Imps, and even that paladin.<br/>
Anyone know what level he is?  Anyway, I was zoning too much to make and good,<br/>
consistent exp gains.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;By far sister island is the best place to hunt for xp and money &lt;snip&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;BTW you would be killing sisters or Eroslilli or<br/>
 </span></blockquote>something like that.  a good thing to keep in mind is to bind yourself to<br/>
Freeport in front of the vendor on the dock because you will be so loaded<br/>
down you will hardly be able to move.</div>
