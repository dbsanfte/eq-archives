<b>Subject:</b> Lvl 12 Pet <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1082306305">I&#39;ve just made lvl12 as a DE Necro last night.  First thing to purchase<br/>
was Convoke Shadow, the new pet spell -- imagine my suprise when the<br/>
first pet I summoned coned green to me!!!  What gives, I though pets<br/>
were supposed to range 11-13, but my green pet was lvl 8.  Initially I<br/>
thought it was due to my conjuration skill being low, around 45, but<br/>
I&#39;ve raised it up to around 65 and still had cast a green one.  I was<br/>
sucessfull in casting a lvl 12 pet twice and few 10-11, but I&#39;m yet to<br/>
cast a lvl 13.  Does anyone know if we just get weaker pets at this<br/>
level or what is going on?<br/>
<br/>
thanks<br/>
