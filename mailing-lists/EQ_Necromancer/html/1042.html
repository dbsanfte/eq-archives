<div id="ygrps-yiv-720716286">Some idiot is busy using multiple characters to rip people off.  He has<br/>
made claims that his main Character is Gathaway BaneFlare - Leader of<br/>
the Titan&#39;s Tribunal guild.  He makes a partial trade and says he will<br/>
get Gath and finish the trade, then he disappears.  I can&#39;t find the 2<br/>
names I have written down but will post them as soon as I can get them.<br/>
Gathaway has 3 other Characters but won&#39;t trade in this way, if his<br/>
characters  don&#39;t have the money on them, he&#39;d use Gath for the full<br/>
trade.<br/>
Before anyone says &quot;If you&#39;r that stupid serves you right&quot; please<br/>
consider some people do still trust others, in this case it cost a girl<br/>
500pp.  Anyone who claims to represent any guild but doesn&#39;t have a<br/>
guild tag is lying.  /who all titan  will find you some members who<br/>
aren&#39;t anon too question if U need too.<br/>
Anyways I thought I&#39;d drop a note, Gathaway is a friend who doesn&#39;t<br/>
cheat others, and I&#39;d like anyone else on karana who may have heard of<br/>
this guy to post all characters he uses so we can warn our friends.<br/>
