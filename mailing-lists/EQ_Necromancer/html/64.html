&gt;  be this difficult?  Or is just me?  My ranger character advanced easily<br/>

<br/>
Level 11 was also rather difficult, though I was grouping so it was not too <br/>
bad.<br/>
<br/>
The bad thing is, Verant changed the pet spell.  The rank 4 (level 12) pet <br/>
spell summons a pet that ranges from 8 to 12, not 11 to 13 like it should...  <br/>
So you can STILL often get useless pets.  (the last time I summoned I had to <br/>
cast 6 times to get a pet that did not con green to me)<br/>
