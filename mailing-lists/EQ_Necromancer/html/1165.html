<div id="ygrps-yiv-1703534220">there really isnt a whole lot you can do if you had been killing cb orcs.  <br/>
that kills your faction with the indigo brotherhood (basically the guards of <br/>
the evil cities).  you may be able to build with the ogres from some things <br/>
ive heard, but even me, a dark elf, can just barely trade in grobb and <br/>
ogguk.   i also know you can build faction with certain quests, but you have <br/>
to be welcome to complete them.  there are no &#39;friends kills&#39; that i know <br/>
of.  someone did mention killing slaves in cb, but im not sure of that (i <br/>
can imagine it would kill your faction with the slave&#39;s race).<br/>
