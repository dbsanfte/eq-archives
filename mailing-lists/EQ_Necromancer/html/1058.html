&gt;I am a level 6 necro playing in the Qeynos Hills outside of BB.  While I am <br/>
&gt;making good xp and cant complain, I am beginning to reach the point where <br/>
&gt;the XP out there is low.  Does anyone have any suggestions where a Human <br/>
&gt;Necromancer can go to level from 6-8, 8-12, 12-16, and 16-20?  I know BB is <br/>
&gt;a good source of XP and loot, but it is usually crowded and there are <br/>
&gt;trains which is never good for a caster, especially in such a small area <br/>
&gt;(running room wise).  Are the Karanas available at that level?  With where <br/>
&gt;I placed myself, am I stuck there till a later level?  How can we change <br/>
&gt;our factions so, while the guards can sneer at us and call us names, they <br/>
&gt;will leave us alone in other towns such as Rivervale or Freeport or even <br/>
&gt;Halas?  While I am sure this is something that has been covered time and <br/>
&gt;again on this list and I apologize for redundency, any info would be <br/>
&gt;greatly appreciated.<br/>
