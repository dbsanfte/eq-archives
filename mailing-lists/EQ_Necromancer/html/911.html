<div id="ygrps-yiv-1522563400">OK this made me think of a question.  Does anyone know what lvl Amanda<br/>
Brightblaze (or Something Brightblaze) in Butcherblock is?  She is at the 2<br/>
little buildings right before the GF zeon.    She doesn&#39;t like Gnome Necros<br/>
I&#39;ll tell you that, did 118 dmg to me in 1 freakin hit!!!!    I made it to<br/>
zone w/ 30 HP LEFT! and thanks GOD for Shieldskin.  hehe   anyway  I want to<br/>
come back someday and SLAY HER!  She pissed me off killed me once when I was<br/>
8th and the most recent time I was about to zone and someone had pulled her<br/>
to the GF zone!  DOH!<br/>
SHE MUST DIE!!?!?  Anyone know what lvl she is?<br/>
