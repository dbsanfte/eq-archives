<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-389709564">I have a level 10 necro and I have found that the resist is only true of<br/>
deep reds basically they just put a resist cap on our lifetap spells similar<br/>
to all other caster resist cap.  So it you try to life tap a sand giant it<br/>
will be resisted but if you life tap something say only 5 levels above you<br/>
it will not be resisted.  I have lifespiked many red and yellows that others<br/>
were fight and never got resisted except if it was a deep red and I was<br/>
resisted everytime.  basically it will prevent exp twinking that nercos had<br/>
and could really exploit.  It does not effect much else except the deal that<br/>
all other caster types have with there resist caps only our is unresistable<br/>
to the cap.<br/>
