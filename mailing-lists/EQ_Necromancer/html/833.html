<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-906486723">I am only 18th, but my higher lvl friends seemed to really like Mistmoore zone between 20-26ish<br/>
<br/>
At 24th I&#39;d get a small party and go there and kill the Drow guards.    (that is if you don&#39;t mind pissing off the Indigo Brotherhood)<br/>
<br/>
Also Unrest is really good eps and loot.   At 24th you could get in a party w/ ease.   <br/>
Unrest can get crowded though.<br/>
<br/>
Also if unrest is just packed, try the goblin camp (and roaming goblins) in D. Cauldron just outside unrest.   The Tidal lords are all gonna be good eps for you.<br/>
<br/>
Last night on Eci Cobbie (L22 necro human) and I (Gnome Necro L18) and a Cleric held our own in the goblin camp, but it was tough for us at times.   At 24th you and 1 other about your lvl should be ok, but summon your pet for sure.  Cobbie and I both had our pets go for a tidal lord and we&#39;d DoT and melee (Grim Aura, Vampiric Embrace) the others w/ the cleric until we could help our pets.<br/>
<br/>
I DoT the Tidal lord too while pets beat on him.  If nothing else it is really fun to kill goblins in large numbers. hehe  I am 1 bubble from 19th now.  I want 20th so bad.  ;-)  <br/>
<br/>
P.S.  Most of the goblins we fought were conning red to me.  (all the tidal lords were red)</div>
