<b>Subject:</b> 2 more pet questions <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2073190395">1)<br/>
Is the only way to make a pet attack to click on the pet and then say &quot;kill a large rat&quot;<br/>
because I would like to select the creature that I want him to attack and say PET KILL or PET ATTACK and that did not work.<br/>
<br/>
2) I saw some necromancer in Unrest and he had this skeleton w/ him and the skeleton would fall into a pile of bones after saying something like &quot;Taking new form master&quot;   Then later the pile of bones would float back into a full skeleton.   HOW WAS HE DOING THAT????<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!  :-)</div>
