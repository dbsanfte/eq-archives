<div id="ygrps-yiv-1926087311">Not true.. they dont suck. you just need to use your head and plan things out. Now mend bones in my book is not the best spell. I use dark empethy on my pet then cast my drain life a few times then drak empethy agian. This worked for me well.. right up to level 12. Good luck!!<br/>

    yup sucks most of the 8th level spells do<br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Does anyone else find this spell pretty useless?  I feel so cheated I paid 4 PP + for it and it hardly heals my skel at all takes a long time to cast and takes a decent amt of mana, what gives . . .</div>
