<div id="ygrps-yiv-920500127">wtf?  i think necros have the largest percentage of broken and useless <br/>
spells of any class.  not only that, but we have a huge gap in the number of <br/>
quests we can do, and too many items mimic our spells.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;BTW, is intensify death really broken. Feel kinda stupid casting it all the <br/>
&gt;  time for the last few weeks.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>then they took away charm and gave us a worthless spell (screaming terror), <br/>
not only is it a &#39;why go to the train when you can bring the train to you&#39; <br/>
spell, but it only works indoors!  at least if it worked outdoors, when the <br/>
wipe failed it wouldnt really be as dangerous.<br/>
<br/>
and what were they thinking when they made voice graft?  i dont think any <br/>
class has a more useless spell.<br/>
<br/>
oh well, thats my rant =)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Also had a general question about experience and which is better to do.  Is<br/>
&gt;it better to solo a yellow spawn every other time it comes up (lets say<br/>
&gt;alternating with an equal level friend) or group with your friend and kill<br/>
&gt;each one and split the exp?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>you are better off getting 50% of two kills than 100% of one, there is less <br/>
work involved, and more safety.  also, you get some form of grouping bonus.<br/>
