<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1139251005">I believe the WCS is off a Froglock/Goblin (can&#39;t remember) of about 25ish<br/>
in Lake Rathe near the Aviak Village.  The SCS comes off a named Evil Eye in<br/>
Beholder though I do not remember its name either.<br/>
<br/>
I bought my WCS for 80pp while I was hunting Aviaks in S. Karana, awhile ago<br/>
it was one the items of the week so they might be less now.<br/>
<br/>
Last week I was lucky and traded a Glowing Stein for a Staff of Writhing & a<br/>
Shield of the Slain Unicorn. I think the Staff is the best 1h blunt you are<br/>
going to find (9/33 & 48pt Chaotic Feedback).  However it seems my 24th<br/>
level wizard is not high enough to get the chaotic feedback to work<br/>
properly. I receive a message that my will is not sufficient to command the<br/>
staff. So for the short term I have banked it and switch to the WCS until I<br/>
gain a few levels.<br/>

Do any of you know what MOB has the Water Crystal staff?  Or the Slime<br/>
Crystal Staff?<br/>
<br/>
I have heard that the WCS is found in Lake Rathe on a level 20ish MOB... is<br/>
this correct?  Does anyone have additional info like where he can be found?<br/>
<br/>
I know nothing about the Slime Crystal Staff so any info you have would be<br/>
helpful.<br/>
<br/>
I want to get a decent 1hd staff that looks interesting.<br/>
<br/>
Are there any other different looking 1hd staff(or any good ones for that<br/>
matter) that a level 20 Necro (with some similar level friends if needed)<br/>
could obtain... not that I&#39;m positive I could get either of these.<br/>
<br/>
