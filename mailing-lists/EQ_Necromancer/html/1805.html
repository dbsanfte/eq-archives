I hear ya :)  My guildmates always ask &quot;why do you still give it daggers? it<br/>
doesn&#39;t matter now!&quot;  my reply of course is &quot;look at the weight on a dagger,<br/>
and then look at the weight on a short sword...which of those would you want<br/>
to carry 8 of around with you?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My evil eye bag is dedicated to carrying pet weapons, sad really. :P some<br/>
day I&#39;ll get a tinger bag to compliment it, and perhaps I&#39;ll be able to<br/>
actually keep stuff to sell.</div>
