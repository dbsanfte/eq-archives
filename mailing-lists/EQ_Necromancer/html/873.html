<div id="ygrps-yiv-1320972923">Arrgh.. Does anyone have good suggestions where a 14th level Dark Elf <br/>
Necromancer can go hunting and make some exp (hopefully enough to 16)? I&#39;ve<br/>
tried east and west commons, most of the things con green to me (90%) and<br/>
don&#39;t give exp, the rest just kick my ___. I tried Befallen but all that<br/>
resulted in was a trip back to 13th level twice.<br/>
<br/>
Help?<br/>
