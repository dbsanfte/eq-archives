<div id="ygrps-yiv-1283511823">No clue about the Rathe mountains, but as for things to kill at level 26, be<br/>
creative! or more importantly...be EVIL :) people kill darkelf guards all<br/>
the time...why not spread some of that love back to the good races, don&#39;t<br/>
stop with guards either, there are plenty of goodly npc&#39;s just waiting to be<br/>
slaughtered for xp and loot. :)<br/>
