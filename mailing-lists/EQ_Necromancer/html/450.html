<div id="ygrps-yiv-402539511">personally, i love being a de necro.  sure there is some risk, but you get <br/>
used to it.  now i only get kos when i get sloppy (not having gather shadows <br/>
on).  and we are very welcome in the dark cities.  also, i am now on faydwer <br/>
and you wouldnt believe how many people there help me!  many have never seen <br/>
a de, much less a de necro.  they tell me i look like dvinn =)  also, i <br/>
wandered thru crushbone w/o getting attacked by a single orc =) that was <br/>
kinda cool.<br/>

&gt;   There&#39;s no good answer to that.  Basically any race that is a <br/>
&gt;necromancer besides a Dark Elf Necromancer will have problems anywhere.  <br/>
&gt;The good thing is usually you aren&#39;t KOS everywhere (cept mage&#39;s guilds and <br/>
&gt;whatnot)  Dark Elves are KOS in a lot of places and Dark Elf Necromancers <br/>
&gt;have prices on their heads in almost all places.  The good thing about <br/>
&gt;being a Dark Elf Necromancer is that you are fine in your city and the <br/>
&gt;Troll and Ogre cities.  Everyone will do business with you and no one is <br/>
&gt;KOS.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Personally I think its a matter of preference.  Non Dark Elf <br/>
&gt;Necromancers have access to a LOT more areas, but generally have a harder <br/>
&gt;time dealing with EVERYONE whereas Dark Elves are totally blocked out of <br/>
&gt;some areas but in South Antonica they have NO problems.  And believe me, <br/>
&gt;there is plenty of zones and leveling areas in South Antonica so you can <br/>
&gt;level high enough so worrying about guards becomes less and less a problem.<br/>
