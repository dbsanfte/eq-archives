<div id="ygrps-yiv-2140492648">If could all of you send in a feed back in the game and also email varent.<br/>
That we would like to have something done about this shortage of words.<br/>
There should be some sort of system where if a necro is looting there is a<br/>
word, and if a wizard loots a ruin is there. Most of my friends are necro&#39;s<br/>
in the game so we are all fighting for the same words. Or heaven for bid<br/>
they might put words on vendors and just make the trade harder. I could live<br/>
with that. If we could all put are heads together and do this as a group it<br/>
could make a difference.<br/>
<br/>
Also I am level 33 now and not very sure what to hunt again. hehehehe I have<br/>
been kill druids for the past few levels. Now I am at a loss. Any one out<br/>
there have a clue at all. All I really want is my new spells.</div>
