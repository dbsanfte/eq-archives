I know there is a bug that can reset you factions to their beginning levels,<br/>
but I don&#39;t know how to trigger it.  A 50th level DE Necro in my guild<br/>
triggered it once, but he doesn&#39;t know how he did it either.<br/>

  Please if anyone can help me, I am VERY desperate.  I have accidentally<br/>
  messed up my factions with Dark Bargainers so that they are apprehensive.<br/>
I<br/>
  don&#39;t know how this happened, but I went from amiable to apprehensive<br/>
  without even being indifferent!!!  But anyway, is there ANY way to get<br/>
  factions higher with Dark Bargainers that anybody can think of?  I tried<br/>
  Wine quest...  won&#39;t give it to ya unless you are indiff or better.  I<br/>
tried<br/>
  slaves in Crushbone...  the woodelf slaves gave me good factions towards<br/>
  Indigo Brotherhood, but none to Dark Bargainers.  Tried the GLS and LS<br/>
quest<br/>
  in South Ro to Smith Tv&#39;ysa but she wouldn&#39;t take them or talk to me<br/>
  either...  must have to be indiff here as well.  So I finally got a lvl 50<br/>
  druid (39 - 50 can do this) cast wolf form on me in S. Ro and this made no<br/>
  difference.  She still hated me!  So is there any quests anyone can think<br/>
of<br/>
  that would possibly help me here?  I am really getting desperate and have<br/>
  spent hours trying these other things.  Thanks a lot!!!<br/>
<br/>
  Really paying for this stupid mistake!!!<br/>
