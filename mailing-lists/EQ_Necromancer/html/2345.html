Even with the Fear nerf, they&#39;re also the best for surviving on PvP<br/>
servers...most of the cowardly Player Killers have a much harder time<br/>
sneak-attacking Necromancers successfully. They&#39;ve one of the best pets, and<br/>
can kill an attacking player faster with their DoTs than even a wizard with<br/>
his mana-hogging DDs.<br/>
