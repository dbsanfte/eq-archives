<div id="ygrps-yiv-1893890763">i know you WERE able to sometimes (glowing stein comes to mind) but i think <br/>
if you are KOS to them it will break the invis.  im not sure if this was a <br/>
feature or a bug.  for example, in the glowing stein you had to talk to the <br/>
bartender.  i wasnt kos to him, but the ogre paladin in the bar did enjoy <br/>
killing me (several times, actually).  also, he could see invis (i suppose <br/>
all ogre paladins can see invis...) so it made this rather difficult to <br/>
complete.  the crucial fact, if you turned the book into the ogre barkeep in <br/>
ogguk while not invis, you wont complete the quest (he doesnt like dark <br/>
elves enough).  but you could have done it while invis (cons indifferent).<br/>
<br/>
i do know for a fact that if you are kos to them, they will attack- i tried <br/>
some minor quests to test this out a while ago (the muffin quest in freeport <br/>
for example)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;hi !<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I heard from some sources (not sure where since i already deleted the mail) <br/>
&gt;that<br/>
&gt;quests are able to be completed while under Invisibility .<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;They stated examples by completing the Mystic Cloak quest<br/>
&gt;(8ac +5int +5sv magic 10 charges SteelSkin) .<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;A few days later i attempted to try this out myself by camping<br/>
&gt;the Priest of Najena in Unrest . It was a 52 min spawn and more<br/>
&gt;often than not spawns a regular Ghoul as a placeholder (PH).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;After 16 long hours of waiting in line (only 2 spawned) and getting<br/>
&gt;the component off the Priest i made off to Najena to complete part<br/>
&gt;1 of the quest . unfortunately when i tried to give it to the NPC while<br/>
&gt;invis , it broke the invisibility and i was charmed and killed by the NPC<br/>
&gt;(who is a High Elf Enchanter btw) .<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Has anybody else attempted to complete this quest ?<br/>
&gt;or does anyone have confirmation if quests can be completed<br/>
&gt;while invis ? pls email me directly as I dont always get the time<br/>
&gt;to read all this list mails...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;regards,<br/>
