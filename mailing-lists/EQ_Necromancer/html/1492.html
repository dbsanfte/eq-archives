<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1189504677">hehe i thought the globe was the worst.  I camped for 3 hours just to get 3<br/>
globes for myself and 2 other necros, but it was a pain in the butt breaking<br/>
into the area since it was just me and another necro (i was 30 he was 32)<br/>
when the task began.  We were finally able to get a high level nec to come<br/>
in and break the spawn for us and he left and another nec joined in.  <br/>
<br/>
I just hung around unrest and asked if i could loot the items i needed for<br/>
the quest, matter of fact, there was a high level nec in there killing<br/>
fungus, and was shouting that anyone could loot the eyes.  The werebat was a<br/>
piece of cake. <br/>

In nek, the scythe was easy :) it was the mortuary fungus that was a<br/>
pain...much more difficult than the globe for the robe in guk.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Where were you hunting the shadowmen at?  I hunted in nek and I would get<br/>
&gt; about 3 to 4 scythes a night, and everything else was hard to find, but I<br/>
&gt; did find it all and I must say I look like a bad ass dressed in all black<br/>
&gt; running around with a scythe in 1 hand and dirk in the other :)<br/>
