<b>Subject:</b> Re: Dual Wield and pet weapons <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-999794548">This is the way it works:<br/>
<br/>
A skeleton has two values that it uses when attacking,<br/>
speed and damage. It&#39;s fists have a natural speed of<br/>
30, and the natural damage obviously goes up as you<br/>
get higher level skeletons. Verant chose to make the<br/>
pets have a huge advantage when wielding weapons. The<br/>
game looks at the both the natural speed/damage and<br/>
the weapon speed/damage and uses the better values.<br/>
Thus, if you give a level 1 skeleton that does 4 pts<br/>
of damage a scythe with damage 12 and delay of 50, it<br/>
will attack at speed 30 with damage of 12. If you give<br/>
a level 49 skeleton a damage 3 fs dagger of delay 21,<br/>
it will attack at speed of 21 with the natural damage<br/>
of 50. Level 12-16 is when the skeleton does more<br/>
damage with its fists then with large weapons. This is<br/>
when you start giving it daggers so it attacks faster.<br/>
Bottom line:<br/>
Level 12 and below pets, give them 2h weapons so their<br/>
damage is much greater while attacking at delay of 30.<br/>
Level 16 and above pets you give any weapon that has a<br/>
delay of less then 30 to speed it up while keeping the<br/>
great natural damage.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Also, dual wielding, you can not give two of the same<br/>
weapon to a pet. The pet will think it has only one<br/>
weapon. So you give it a rusty dagger and a tarnished<br/>
dagger. Also, dual wielding skeletons come at level 29<br/>
and above. <br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I thought that at 16th level and above you should<br/>
&gt; not give your pet a weapon<br/>
&gt; &gt;  because he did more damage barehanded.  Am I<br/>
&gt; wrong about this?<br/>
&gt; &gt;  <br/>
&gt; I had originally thought that....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But it seems that if you put something like a dagger<br/>
&gt; in their hand (the <br/>
&gt; faster the better) then they will do the same amount<br/>
&gt; of damage, AND attack <br/>
&gt; faster, AND still be able to hit magic.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Of course, this sounds like one of the &quot;features&quot;<br/>
&gt; that may be &quot;fixed&quot; in the <br/>
&gt; future, but for now, it is a nice thing to use.<br/>
