<div id="ygrps-yiv-1961539958">i havent tried that, but it should work, because monks can kite with feign <br/>
death.  be sure you dont have autoattack on, however.  on a side note, i <br/>
know my experience may be different than others, but i have always found <br/>
feign death to be a worthless spell, as the creatures are never fooled by <br/>
it, and then i cant even run or cast(click walk, get up, turn around, and <br/>
creep away because you have 3hp left).  also, it has a rather high mana cost <br/>
for a lower lvl caster.<br/>

&gt;Out of curiosity, Has anyone tried to stack DoT&#39;s then feign death.<br/>
&gt;Should that not do the extra damage since the monster would be withing<br/>
&gt;melee range for more then 18 seconds and not moving.<br/>
&gt;I was thinking something like DoT&#39;s feign death, wait, get up, shadow<br/>
&gt;step, DoT&#39; feign death, critter dead.<br/>
&gt;Now, does DoT make the critter see through feign death??<br/>

&gt;16. Besides, what else am I going to do at work. ;)<br/>
