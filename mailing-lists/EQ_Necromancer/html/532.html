  I had a gnome magician once. When I got to 5 I left Steamfont. You CAN still find rogue clockworks outside the newbie area, but you have to constantly dodge young ebony drakes and things.<br/>

    I made 5th lvl last night and my little gnome necro is doing fine, but I can see now I am starting to get too powerful w/ my big Skeleton buddy for the kolbolds.  They CON Black and when I was 4th I was taking on 2 yellows and winning! I love being a necromancer.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
    Anyway where can I go to find L5-9 MOBs in STEAMFONT???<br/>
<br/>
    Thanks! </span></blockquote></div>
