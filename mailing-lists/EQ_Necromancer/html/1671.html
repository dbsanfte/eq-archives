Karanas Aviaks.  Just as crowded, just as annoying, and just as boring as<br/>
Oasis.<br/>
<br/>
15 or so is where groups or partners get really handy.  Spiders, snakes,<br/>
and puppies in N Karanas are plentiful, but a poison curer is just about <br/>
required.  Minos and muddites in the Gorge are good, but probably require<br/>
a partner or small group as well.<br/>
<br/>
Kodiaks (non-young) in W Commons are probably about right for you and you<br/>
can solo them in all likelihood.<br/>

Everfrost is going to have orcs and ice-boned skellies for you.  Rathe<br/>
mountains has a couple of options.  You can pick up ice- and dark-boned<br/>
skeletons if there&#39;s a group at the ruin taking the big skeletons.  In the<br/>
south of the zone there&#39;s a bunch of drakes and basilisks that should be<br/>
very good (but don&#39;t get too close to the sphinx).  <br/>
<br/>
Unrest is actually very good if you have a decent group (at least 4 people<br/>
recommended, including one tank and one wis-based caster).  Yard trash<br/>
will still be blue, and pulling ghouls and mummies from the first floor is<br/>
easy.  Pull to the back wall and you&#39;ll almost never get trained on.<br/>
