&gt; &gt;I was wondering if anybody has any<br/>
&gt; &gt;recommendations on which weapon a dark elven<br/>
&gt; &gt;necromancer should use.  I&#39;ve used dagger<br/>
&gt; &gt;so far, but have tried the 1H staff and<br/>
&gt; &gt;like the better damage.<br/>

I second this.  At L1-7 or so a cracked staff is the best thing you&#39;re<br/>
going to find.  But a worn great staff doesn&#39;t suck, and lets you stay<br/>
current in 2H blunt. At around L10 it&#39;s going to become important to find<br/>
a magic weapon, and on most servers a Runed Totem Staff (2H blunt) is<br/>
likely available for 10-15pp.  You can often get mages to summon magic<br/>
daggers or staves for your pet.  If you and your pet have a magic weapon,<br/>
you can kill wisps at L8 if you&#39;re lucky and L10 without worry.<br/>
<br/>
When you&#39;re not fighting magic-only critters, you&#39;ll probably want to go<br/>
back to your cracked staff (or other 1H weapon if you&#39;ve found/bought<br/>
one), because then you can equip your stein (crude steins available free<br/>
outside Oggok on servers with lots of guard killers) or Skull (J&#39;hen Tra<br/>
should be about 15pp) in your off-hand.<br/>
<br/>
By L20 in a group, you&#39;d almost always rather be medding than swinging, so<br/>
equip whatever gives you bonuses.  Soloing, you may still need to get in a<br/>
whack or two but it won&#39;t matter much what weapon you choose for it.<br/>
