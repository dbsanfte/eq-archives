<div id="ygrps-yiv-1266241691">I&#39;m level 30, I started my reign of terror in the Qeynos Hills off and on at<br/>
about level 26, killing Holly, and the Millers and the 2 guards by Surefall.<br/>
At level 29 I could take Cros Treewind about half the time, I can take him 2<br/>
out of 3 now, still not worth the risk though :)  Those damn Druid DD spells<br/>
*hurt* I&#39;m just thankful that I have these mobs to kill while I wait on<br/>
Varsoon, I pity the goodly races that have to sit in this zone doing<br/>
*nothing* while they wait on his daily spawn.  Some things to watch out for<br/>
if you plan on doing this.  Guards Nash and Leopold wander, and are still<br/>
red to me (does anyone know what level they are?) And Cros and Holly have<br/>
this obscene tendency to cross paths while I&#39;m fighting the other one. :)<br/>
<br/>
On a seperate note, big thanks to those who recommended I pursue Vampiric<br/>
Curse, this spell just plain *rocks* I was able to separate the Millers<br/>
spawns and keep taking them one at a time by alternating between allure of<br/>
death and vampiric curse.  These 2 are about level 25 or 6 and spawn every 5<br/>
minutes, a veritable xp fountain for evil races.  PLUS, Verant finally fixed<br/>
it so you only receive KaranasResidents Faction hits for killing them,<br/>
rather than Qeynos guards (the 2 of them are poachers and are hated by the<br/>
surefall residents, it didn&#39;t make sense to lose faction from the<br/>
surrounding area by killing so called villains)  They both drop Bronze<br/>
weapons, great roleplaying fodder.  I tend to give them away to the first<br/>
level 5 or below that runs up and shouts &quot;HAIL THE PRINCE OF HATE&quot; or some<br/>
such evil nastiness. :)<br/>

&gt; BTW, what level are you?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I would love to terrorize the goody goody NPCs in Qeynos Hills... I know<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; will be a while but I&#39;m curious what level I will need to be to do this.<br/>

&gt; Though killing guards, poachers, rangers and druids is great xp, I&#39;d like<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; move on to something with a bit better loot than bronze weapons ;) </span></blockquote></div>
