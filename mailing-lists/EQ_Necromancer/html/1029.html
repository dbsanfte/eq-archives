<div id="ygrps-yiv-1863326582">WHO: &quot;Skel&quot;    the 21th lvl Gnome necromancer<br/>
WHERE:Eci<br/>
WHEN: 8pm-1130pm est<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am an L21 Gnome Necromancer looking for a group to adventure with.  I have been soloing for a long time and advanceing fast.   But as everyone knows, it gets harder at higher lvls, and it is not as much fun alone either.<br/>
<br/>
My characters name is Skel<br/>
<br/>
If you are in the 20-28th lvl range and could use another person to group with give me a /tell  I am a team player and most of my good friends are way high lvl because they play tons more.  I don&#39;t know where they get the time.  If you want to just try me in the group that is fine too!  :-)  Give me a /tell<br/>
<br/>
I play from 8Eastern until about midnight everynight. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks</div>
