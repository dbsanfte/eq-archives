<div id="ygrps-yiv-1168354351">In my opinion any aoe spell means a very certain death for you, so I stay<br/>
away from them.  But from what I remember, when I first got it, it did about<br/>
70 pts dmg per mob, it has been a while though and has been moved to the<br/>
back of my spell book gathering dust since.<br/>
<br/>
Oasis is good, usually crowded since everyone is killing crocs, but i hunted<br/>
at a couple of good places killing everything but crocs there.<br/>

I think you still should be able to buy your pets in neriak nec guild at<br/>
your level.  The pets may also be in the nec guild in freeport, it may be<br/>
easier to ask someone to show you where it is since there are quite a few<br/>
turns that you take.<br/>

HI all, i have recently started my necro and am about to buy my lvl 16<br/>
spells I was wondering is infectious cloud worth buying? i know its area<br/>
effect and stops regen but what is the damage? I have read conflicting<br/>
reports, some saying it is only DD and some saying it is alos 100 dmg DOT,<br/>
can anyoen clarify which it is? Also where should i hunt at lvl 13 to get<br/>
to 16 fast - i will usually hunt wiht either a lvl 12 monk or druid as my<br/>
partner - i hear oasis is good is that right? FInally I hear i can buy my<br/>
lvl 16 pet spell in efreeport in some kind of cave, rather than research -<br/>
is that correct and if so where is this cave? - Thanks in advance, sorry<br/>
for all the questions, just loving my necro! - Malados on SOlusek Ro<br/>
