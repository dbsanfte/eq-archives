&gt;As long as I am at it.  What is the benefit of attacking quicker?  It seem<br/>
&gt;to be important to everyone, but I don&#39;t understand why.  The combat system<br/>
&gt;seems to go by rounds, so having a faster weapon would not mean more hits.<br/>
&gt;The only benefit I can see is that your pet is more likely to do damage<br/>
&gt;before it dies rather than dying before it get to hit for that round.<br/>
&gt;Getting in one more hit doesn&#39;t seem like a good enough reason for everyone<br/>
&gt;to go through so much effort to give their pet a weapon with a small delay.<br/>
&gt;What am I missing?<br/>

&gt;Well, you should not give your pet say a rusty halberd, or some other slow<br/>
&gt;weapon after this as yes it will only slow him down.But I would DEFINITELY<br/>
&gt;advise you to give your pet a dagger of some kind (FS are best if you are<br/>
&gt;high enough lvl to be giving them to a pet).Why?Because, daggers will make<br/>
&gt;your pet attack quite a bit faster than with his bare fist and it does not<br/>
&gt;lower his damage.So it&#39;s hitting for the same amount of damage, but a good<br/>
&gt;deal quicker.<br/>

&gt;&lt;&lt; I thought that at 16th level and above you should not give your pet a<br/>
&gt;weapon<br/>
&gt;  because he did more damage barehanded.  Am I wrong about this? &gt;&gt;<br/>
