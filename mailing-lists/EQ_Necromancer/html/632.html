<div id="ygrps-yiv-1696106762">I had Crookstinger with another character on another server, very nice<br/>
dagger (magical, 4 dmg, 21 dly, plus the occasional minor poison effect<br/>
depending on your DEX). I found it in Lesser Faydark, near the brownie<br/>
village. It is a VERY rare spawn, and I only heard of one other person on<br/>
the entire server that had the dagger. I think if you took a ranger with<br/>
you and used his/her tracking ability that would help a lot.<br/>

&gt;faydark looking for a damn named wasp, but didnt find him.  in fact, a few <br/>
&gt;druids/rangers said they have been looking for it since after beta, and <br/>
&gt;still havent seen it.  perhaps it&#39;s gone? </span></blockquote></div>
