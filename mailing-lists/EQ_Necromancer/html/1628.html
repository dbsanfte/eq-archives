<div id="ygrps-yiv-475548361">I am a lvl 13 DE necro and was wanting to make a trip to the Sister Ise in<br/>
OOT.  My question is how hard of a trip is this for a DE to make,  am I KOS<br/>
in Freeport etc.  Also is the isle the first one that the boat stops at or<br/>
will I have to swim?  Any other advice will also be welcomed :)<br/>
