&gt; Hi Xurtin,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was in all three BETAs for EQOA. I think if you are comming from the PC<br/>
&gt; version of EQ, even if its been a while since you last played, that you<br/>
will<br/>
&gt; probably be a little disappointed.  The graphics are ok, but the game play<br/>
&gt; mechanics were just not my cup of tea.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Then again, I&#39;m sure they&#39;ve made huge strides since I last played the PS2<br/>
&gt; BETA, so its probably worth it to try it out for yourself and make your<br/>
own<br/>
&gt; conclusions.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I know its not much info, but its really all I have. I hope this helped<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; in some way. :-)<br/>
