<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Well I made the elusive level 20 last night, made the trek from the Karanas<br/>
&gt;  to Neriak to purchase my new spells, and lo...Animate dead wasn&#39;t there.  I<br/>
&gt;  did a quick search and found another level 20 necro, and he tells me that<br/>
&gt;  the spell is in Oggok...hooray! :) before I make this long journey I wanted<br/>
&gt;  to check with you folks and make sure no one had found it closer to the<br/>
&gt;  homeland.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The only place I was able to find it was Grobb (the TROLL city, not the Ogre <br/>
City) ... though it may be in the Ogre City also...<br/>
<br/>
The 24th is there also ... so get it while you are there ... and a few other <br/>
of the hard to find 20 and 24th spells...<br/>
