        Also, I&#39;m wondering... since we&#39;re talking about quests here.  When you talk to the guard and he tells you about his daughter Lucie.  Is this one of the myraid of broken quests?  I went into the area of the Aquaducts that they were speaking about, but just walked in circles and got annoyed.  I checked the walls for any that were illusions but didn&#39;t find any, though I guess I could&#39;ve missed a section.  Any idea about this one?<br/>
<br/>
    If the message is going to give any thing about a quest away, then the author can just add [Quest Info] or [Q.Info] in the subject.  That&#39;ll let people know who don&#39;t want to have anything given away, that they shouldn&#39;t read that particuler message.  Just an idea.<br/>
<br/>
    Enjoy folks, like the list.<br/>

  Wow as the subscriber count climbs I would like to take this chance to welcome all to the list.<br/>
  Is anyone against the sharing of Quest information in this list?<br/>
