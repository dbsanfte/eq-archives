<br/>
&gt; Level 7 is very difficult, the pet is not very useful at that level.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Level 11 was also rather difficult, though I was grouping so <br/>
&gt; it was not too <br/>
&gt; bad.<br/>

working Befallen 2nd floor a lot with five other guys.  It still took a long<br/>
time because I died often, but it was better then camping at Lrodd or<br/>
attempting to work the West Commons.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The bad thing is, Verant changed the pet spell.  The rank 4 <br/>
&gt; (level 12) pet <br/>
&gt; spell summons a pet that ranges from 8 to 12, not 11 to 13 <br/>
&gt; like it should...  <br/>
&gt; So you can STILL often get useless pets.  (the last time I <br/>
&gt; summoned I had to <br/>
&gt; cast 6 times to get a pet that did not con green to me)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>	Oh yes, this was most surprising.  At level 12 I rarely saw a white<br/>
conned skeleton, and now as 13 I rarely get a blue dangerous.  This is<br/>
irritating as well because apparently your pet can only hit magically IF it<br/>
is of higher level than the monster it is hitting... thus your level 8-10<br/>
skeleton can&#39;t hit a level 11 wisp.  Whoops! <br/>
