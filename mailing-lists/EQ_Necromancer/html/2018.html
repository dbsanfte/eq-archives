  <br><br><tt>Same thing happened to me and my 22 wiz.&nbsp; I just couldn&#39;t 
  take it anymore,<br>so I started a DE Necro.&nbsp; Around the same time, a 
  friend of mine was getting<br>tired of his 24 warrior, and did the same 
  thing.&nbsp; We haven&#39;t looked back<br>since, and have now outlevelled our 
  original characters.&nbsp; Best choice we<br>ever made.<br><br>Faction is NOT 
  a problem, so don&#39;t let that discourage you.&nbsp; You just learn<br>to pack a 
  lot with you when you go on extended travels.&nbsp; I&#39;m about to hit<br>lvl 24 
  and haven&#39;t even needed to set foot in North Freeport or Feydwer in<br>all 
  this time.&nbsp; There are always ways to raise faction, some of which 
  are<br>much easier than you might think.&nbsp; I did the &quot;Note for Rebby&quot; and 
  &quot;Note for<br>Janam&quot; quests simultaneously for about 2 hours.&nbsp; I went from 
  barly tolerated<br>to &quot;warmly&quot; in East and West freeport.<br><br>Mujahid&nbsp;

  From: Peck White &lt;pwhite@...&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Ok, Thanks for 
  the info.&nbsp; Thanks to you also, Cory.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; On a side 
  note.&nbsp; I started Alazzar because I got discouraged with my level<br>&gt; 
  23 bard.&nbsp; I just got tired of dieing all the time.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Well 
  last night I made 2 1/2 bubbles of xp in 2 1/2 hours.&nbsp; My bard 
  never<br>&gt; did this in his life.&nbsp; I was amazed at how quickly my pet 
  and I<br>&gt; were mowing<br>&gt; thru mobs with no downtime at all.&nbsp; I 
  am looking forward to<br>&gt; playing Alazzar,<br>&gt; I&#39;m just going to have 
  to get used to the faction thing.&nbsp; I haven&#39;t had to<br>&gt; deal with it 
  yet.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Good hunting,<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 
  Alazzar<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br><br></tt>
