<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1642270813">Currently?  There&#39;s probably no &quot;good&quot; race.  I&#39;ll put it in a power<br/>
gamer&#39;s perspective though since you shouldn&#39;t judge by race.  I chose Dark<br/>
Elf simply because I liked being evil.  I don&#39;t even have an ultra<br/>
intelligence either, which will most likey hurt me later on compared to<br/>
other powergamers.<br/>
<br/>
	There&#39;s a lot of jibber jabber about how Dex is useful and so is<br/>
Agility and which is more important Agility or Stamina... but the real point<br/>
of fact is, later on, if the monster is on you, you are simply dead, 10<br/>
points in Agility will not help you when you are level 30 hunting griffins.<br/>
As for Dex it says it helps with channeling and spellcasting, but let&#39;s say<br/>
it again, if the monster is on you hitting you, you are probably dead.  I&#39;m<br/>
sure a lot of people have had close calls and stuff (if I hadn&#39;t gotten that<br/>
spell of I would&#39;ve been toast, etc etc), but really, 95% of my deaths were<br/>
simply horrible horrible deaths involving me pissing off the monster too<br/>
much and I just got slaughtered no matter what happened or some other bad<br/>
misfortune.<br/>
<br/>
	So, pick a race with high Int and Dex already.  Most people say<br/>
Erudites are the best necromancers because they can have the highest<br/>
Intelligence.  This is true, in the long run an Erudite who put all his<br/>
points into Intelligence (making like an Int of 145 or something), at the<br/>
later levels he will probably be supreme.  My problem is the Eridute Necro&#39;s<br/>
faction problems make early level stuff pretty tortuous unless you serve<br/>
Innoruuk and go to Neriak.  That still won&#39;t help you in Grobb or Oggok.<br/>
That&#39;s why I would choose a Dark Elf.  Nice above average Dexterity and high<br/>
Intelligence, not as high as an Erudite, but the fact that you are accepted<br/>
in all three evil cities gives you that leeway so you can do a lot of what<br/>
you want.  But again, at the far later levels (30+), it won&#39;t really matter,<br/>
and the Erudite necro will start to overtake him.<br/>
<br/>
	INT does make a big difference.  The current formula I believe is:<br/>
<br/>
((INT/5)+2) * level + item bonuses = current mana.<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m a level 15 Dark Elf necro with an INT of 124 (DAMMIT! If I&#39;d have<br/>
known they do it by 5&#39;s I would have put another point in INT!)<br/>
<br/>
((124/5)+2) * 15 = 26*15 = 390 mana<br/>
<br/>
Say I was an Erudite with an INT of 140<br/>
<br/>
((140/5)+2) * 15 = 28*15 = 420 mana<br/>
<br/>
Okay, not a big difference at level 15, that&#39;s not the point.  Let&#39;s go up<br/>
hardcore, level 30...<br/>
<br/>
26*30 = 780 mana<br/>
<br/>
28*30 = 840 mana<br/>
<br/>
Now the difference is up to 60 mana, and the gap widens with every level.<br/>
The difference is even bigger with a human necromancer who can only get a<br/>
max of 85+30 if he ignores all his other attributes.<br/>
<br/>
((115/5)+2) * 30 = 750 facing two races who aren&#39;t even using all their<br/>
ability points to put into INT.<br/>
<br/>
	You might say that because humans get a 20-30% bonus to their<br/>
experience and they level faster... well, that&#39;s great, except that at later<br/>
levels you are hurting yourself when you approach the level limit.  I<br/>
haven&#39;t even touched Gnomes yet, and there&#39;s no way to calculate the bonus<br/>
that having Ultravision fulltime is, as well as several other things<br/>
(location, locality, faction)<br/>
<br/>
	So, which race is best?  I don&#39;t think it really matters all that<br/>
much in the end.  As long as you put the lion&#39;s share of your points into<br/>
Intelligence you should be pretty good at what you do no matter what.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; From: &quot;Jon L. Fiedler II&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:fiedler@...">fiedler@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hi all,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have a question for all you long time Necromancers...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My first (non-beta) EQ persona is a level 17 Wood Elf Ranger; <br/>
&gt; however, I<br/>
&gt; recently started an Erudite Necromancer.  I like playing as a <br/>
&gt; Necro so far<br/>
&gt; (only level 3) and want to start putting more time into him; <br/>
&gt; however, I have<br/>
&gt; a question.  Should I keep playing as an Erudite or should I <br/>
&gt; change to a<br/>
&gt; Dark Elf?  The main problem that I have with Erudites is that <br/>
&gt; no one will<br/>
&gt; sell to you in your own city except your guild.  I am also under the<br/>
&gt; impression that because you are a Necro you are KOS pretty <br/>
&gt; much everywhere<br/>
&gt; (is this correct?).  If this is true then it would seem that <br/>
&gt; a Dark Elf is<br/>
&gt; better since you have a whole starting city to operate from <br/>
&gt; and since a<br/>
&gt; Necro is KOS anyway being a Dark Elf wouldn&#39;t be any more of <br/>
&gt; a disadvantage.<br/>
&gt; The only advantage that I see with Erudites is a slightly <br/>
&gt; higher starting<br/>
&gt; INT but this can be offset by putting almost all your extra <br/>
&gt; points into INT<br/>
&gt; (or is there some other stat you really need to be higher?).  <br/>
&gt; As another<br/>
&gt; question can an Erudite necro travel safely through the evil <br/>
&gt; race cities or<br/>
&gt; are they KOS everywhere (basically are they considered to be <br/>
&gt; part of an evil<br/>
&gt; race even though they are Erudites)?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As I said I haven&#39;t invested a lot of time in my Necro yet so <br/>
&gt; if I&#39;m going<br/>
&gt; to change I want to do it soon.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thank you<br/>
&gt; <br/>
