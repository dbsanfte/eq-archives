<div id="ygrps-yiv-1902382407">I bought both of those in Neriak...pretty certain that Freeport will have<br/>
what you need though, they seem to carry at least up to 16th lvl, and<br/>
probably quite a few past that, though not all.  On a related note...does<br/>
anyone have an up to date list of spell components needed for necro<br/>
research?  The necromonitor has an older one, but it&#39;s very incomplete.<br/>
Learning languages is not my way of having fun, not to mention I solo almost<br/>
exclusively so my opportunities to get spammed by gibberish are pretty few<br/>
and far between.<br/>

Subject: [EQ_Necromancer] where is feign death and L16 summon pet spell . ..<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ok thanks for info on how to find Freeport guild...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone confirm that the L16 summon pet spell is in Freeport and Feign<br/>
Death?<br/>
<br/>
Are Freeport and Ak&#39;kanon my only options?   I have killed a few CB-Orcs . .<br/>
. (prolly 200 or so) so I think Darkelves will KOS me.<br/>
<br/>
I hope can get all the spell I need for a while from those 2 places.  :-) </span></blockquote></div>
