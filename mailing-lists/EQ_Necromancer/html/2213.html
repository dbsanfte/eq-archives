<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1471943377">Ok,  anyone know what it up with the uber weapon for Necro&#39;s?   I&#39;ve seen<br/>
some on one chat list...<br/>
<br/>
This is a Snip from the last thing I found...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1. head to Nektulos Forest and find the female NPC by the river<br/>
loc -1000 -700<br/>
<br/>
2. head to Lake Rathe and find Kazen Facae loc 340 -1600<br/>
<br/>
3. Kill Sir Edwin Motte (level 33 paladin). He is easiest to catch in tavern<br/>
by the docks in EFp where he is on a rotation with the bard and some others<br/>
<br/>
4. Bring head of Motte to Kazen and recieve a symbol<br/>
<br/>
5. Bring symbol to the chick in Nektulos Forest<br/>
<br/>
6. Go to Najena and camp FBR and when you get it go to Nektulos Forest and<br/>
give FBR to chick and get a symbol and some moss<br/>
<br/>
7. Give moss and symbol to Kazens apprentice in Lake Rathe then say symbol<br/>
of the serpent<br/>
<br/>
8. go to Swamp of No Hope and find Ssessthrass loc 3800 1600 give him symbol<br/>
(the one you get from Kazens apprentice)<br/>
<br/>
This is how far I got and as far as I will get in a long time because next<br/>
step involves venturing deep into Chardok which I can&#39;t do at my level :(<br/>

<br/>
Does anyone have any more info on this... ?   I havent had a chance to even<br/>
start it yet but am really curious as to what they are gonna give us<br/>
necro&#39;s...<br/>
<br/>
My personal choice ?<br/>
<br/>
It gives us back Unresistable lifetap and removes all Nerfs back to start of<br/>
Game ! ! !! ! !<br/>
