<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What is the deal with the lvl 12 pet spell?  I have a necro guide (from<br/>
&gt;  Allakhazam&#39;s) that says the lvl 12 pet spell is supposed to summon a pet<br/>
&gt;  from lvl 11 - 13.  I&#39;ve lost count of how many times I cast that spell at<br/>
&gt;  lvl 12 and I was NEVER able to get anything other than a blue-conning pet!<br/>

&gt;  Have you all had the same experience, or have I not sacrificed the right<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Allakazam&#39;s is wrong...<br/>
<br/>
at 12 you get an 8-12 pet, not 11-13 :(<br/>
At some point the scale gets even worse...<br/>
<br/>
The rational is the the pet is an NPC and the levels do not scale the same <br/>
way...</div>
