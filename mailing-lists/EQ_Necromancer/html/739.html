As a Dark Elf Necromance, I got my faction high enough to bank in North <br/>
Freeport.  and I am sure the Paladins started hating me just as much as the <br/>
Halflings started hating me.<br/>

I would kill Goblins and Orcs in kithicor and Runneyeye until all you see is <br/>
little green crouching things in your sleep, and then kill them until you see <br/>
little green crouching things when you drive down the road, then keep killing <br/>
them until your Parents (dead, or alive, whether you are 16 or 80 <br/>
yourself...) see little green crouching things.... then you can probably get <br/>
in and bank :)<br/>
<br/>
I speak in orc sometimes ... that is how many of them I had to kill to get <br/>
into north Freeport.<br/>
