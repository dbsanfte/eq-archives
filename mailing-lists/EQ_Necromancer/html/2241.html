<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2138454549">People people DELAY DOES NOT MATTER.  No matter what weapon the delay of any <br/>
npc is 30 so say at level 24 your pet hits for 22 but if you give it a fs 2h <br/>
and it hits for 24 but has a delay of 40 it doesnt matter the delay is <br/>
automatically 30.  They had to do this a while ago cause necros used to get <br/>
there pets delay down to like 9 with augment death and a fs dagger thats 3 19 <br/>
cause if the damage is lower then then what your pet does it doesnt matter <br/>
either you cant have a negative effect from giving your pet a weapon so go <br/>
nuts.<br/>
