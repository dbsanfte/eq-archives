<div id="ygrps-yiv-840959093">Personally?  Probably never.  I have personally lead the slaughter of<br/>
the Deathfist Orcs and cleaned out all Commonlands camps MULTIPLE times,<br/>
I&#39;d even go far as to say I&#39;ve killed over a thousand orcs in an attempt to<br/>
get goody goody with Freeport.  Hasn&#39;t happened yet.  I would just suck up<br/>
and deal with it.  I know I have.  As a Gnome Necromancer you can still get<br/>
into places Dark Elves can&#39;t, but I don&#39;t see the factions as too much of a<br/>
difference because Dark elf Necromancers are treated fairly by all three<br/>
evil cities which is a large area to be liked in, wherea Gnome Necros are<br/>
sort of disliked everywhere but not totally hated.  Take your pick.<br/>
