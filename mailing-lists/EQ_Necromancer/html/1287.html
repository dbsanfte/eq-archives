<div id="ygrps-yiv-545782683">Killing Sisters of Erroliss(sp?) in the OOT(first stop going to BB on the<br/>
boat)  is a realy good place to go for money. Load up on purity belts bind<br/>
yourself to the docks sell them in Freeport(for 5pp or so), I sold them in<br/>
gfay, had better luck selling them to PC&#39;s there at 5pp, or just sell them<br/>
to NPC&#39;s in the Freeport Necro Guild. They sell for about 1pp a peice to the<br/>
merchants there, at least for my gnome necro. Those belts funded my FBR!<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps,<br/>

&gt; I am a level 16 necromancer, and I am completely<br/>
&gt; broke. As of last night, I am worth 3pp and some<br/>
&gt; change. Could you all please give me some ideas on<br/>
&gt; getting money? Killing wisps is extremely boring to me<br/>
&gt; since they take forever to track down, don&#39;t get exp,<br/>
&gt; and with my luck I get a non-burned out lightstone<br/>
&gt; once out of 10 times. Lavastorm is boring too since<br/>
&gt; that is where i spent level 10-12, and dervishes are<br/>
&gt; the same story since that was 12-14.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Any ideas, please? :)<br/>
