<div id="ygrps-yiv-1188893563">The undead rune that is in the Rathe Mountains is a great spot for a 24th to<br/>
27th necromancer, with careful use of numb the dead or rest the dead you can<br/>
pull solo skeletons very consistently. There are also skeletal monks and a<br/>
barbed bones skeletons, both can drop small bronze armor and offer a little<br/>
more challenge than the giant skeletons. The rune is to the left as you<br/>
enter the zone from the Feerrott, just past the tower with undead in it<br/>
(avoid that tower). There are a few spot that are guaranteed solo pulls. If<br/>
you are facing the rune, the spawn that is furthest right will come solo<br/>
always, and the best tactic to use for the rest is to separate the spawn<br/>
points by leaving a normal zombie or skeleton there, as those wont come when<br/>
you pull the higher level mobs. There are also ice bone and dry bone<br/>
skeletons that sometimes ring in experience, but are mostly a pain in the<br/>
butt at level 24+. This is a little known sweet spot for a necromancer if it<br/>
is worked correctly. You will get good cash from the sale of the bronze<br/>
armor that drops, you will have a stack of bone chips up to your chin, and<br/>
the zone line is close if you get in trouble. The last piece of advice I can<br/>
offer is, play around with the /pet no taunt, it was not available when I<br/>
was there, and I think that is would have kept me and my pet safer since you<br/>
can kite the skeletons around the area with little chance of being attacked<br/>
by other mobs. Take care and good hunting.<br/>
