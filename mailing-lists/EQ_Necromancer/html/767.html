&gt;  *slaughtering* gnolls in Blackburrow. probably about 6-8 hrs of pure<br/>
&gt;  carnage.  Mostly concentrating on the commanders/elite guards in the top<br/>
&gt;  rooms.  After all this, I decided to check my faction, and I&#39;m happy to say<br/>
&gt;  that I just successfully banked in the fair city of Qeynos.  Those human<br/>
&gt;  types aren&#39;t so bad afterall...just have to clean up their vermin first :)<br/>

<br/>
I am also able to bank... but I decided to go to a nearby building to wait <br/>
for my group, and a High Elf merchant wandered INTO the building I was in and <br/>
killed me...  (each hit for like 160 points of damage!!!)  So don&#39;t be <br/>
overconfident in Qeynos.<br/>
