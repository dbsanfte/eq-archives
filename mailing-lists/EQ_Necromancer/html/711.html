<div id="ygrps-yiv-1337365637">Hello all.<br/>
<br/>
Is it possible to research grim aura. IE has anyone done it successfully?<br/>
Also can you buy it? I heard it was for sale in either grobb or oggok at the<br/>
SK guild but a friend told me that the heard the spell was removed from the<br/>
vendor.<br/>
<br/>
Is grim aura still a working spell and can I currently research or buy it?<br/>
Anyone with recent experience please respond.<br/>
<br/>
I have one of the required components but am lacking the words of<br/>
divination.<br/>
<br/>
I have successfully made feign death and restless bones so I know how the<br/>
research works, just not sure if the grim aura spell is researching<br/>
correctly or not and if it is still for sale or not.<br/>
