  I was planning a trip to Unrest tonight and was wondering if anyone had<br/>
any info on it that may be useful. Is it decent for a lvl 23 to solo? I<br/>
heard that there&#39;s usually alot of people there, so the risk of getting hit<br/>
by more than one MOB is low. Also, is there anywhere in Faydwer for a DE to<br/>
sell? As an outcast I was pretty sure there wasn&#39;t.....<br/>
