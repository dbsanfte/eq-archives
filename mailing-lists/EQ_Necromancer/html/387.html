<div id="ygrps-yiv-1851082578">I just started a Dark Elven Necro on Rallos this weekend, for the very same <br/>
reasons, and got him up to 6. A few things of note:<br/>
<br/>
Dark Elves do not tolerate same-race killers. Ex. one certain level 5 Wizard <br/>
(Nuitari is the name, how original) constantly kills newbies (for money he <br/>
says). I have made it a point to kill him on sight, and so have about 8 <br/>
other people I saw last night.<br/>
The first time I encountered him, I sent my pet and cast Poison Bolt, which <br/>
is DoT as we all know. He ran like a little girl, trying to cast gate all <br/>
the way...As far as I could tell, my pet never got a hit in before he went <br/>
invis or gated. The next time I saw him was just inside the city, and he was <br/>
at half health. It would seem to me this is because of my DoT spell (?) I&#39;ve <br/>
never heard of these types of spells not working, and I&#39;ve even heard of <br/>
stories from beta, so I&#39;d assume they worked then... I&#39;ll cast it on myself <br/>
tonight to be sure.<br/>
<br/>
It is rumored that this &quot;racial unity&quot; is unique to the evil races. I have <br/>
heard this in-game and also on message boards. Humans tend to slaughter each <br/>
other, and when parties of Trolls or whatnot attack Freeport, not many unite <br/>
to defend it. On the flip side, last night a level 4 Human Enchanter dared <br/>
enter our sacred forest (oops, sorry it&#39;s catching, heh). He had invis, so <br/>
it was a scramble for everyone in-zone to switch languages to Dark Speech, <br/>
gather the people who could detect invis near the bottlenecks like the <br/>
bridge or the zone entrance, and find him. I&#39;ve never witnessed this kind of <br/>
organization/cooperation on other servers (Fennin, Solusek).<br/>
<br/>
I have yet to travel out of Nektulos, so I can&#39;t help there. I&#39;m waiting for <br/>
level 8, for the invis of course. I also can&#39;t say I&#39;ve witnessed this <br/>
racial untiy type thing as a wood elf either. I started a ranger for the <br/>
heck of it, and while I was in the orc camp I was murdered. Beware taking on <br/>
tough mobs and getting low on health, cause that is a temptation some cannot <br/>
resist. I was killed in two shots by an 8th level erudite wizard, while two <br/>
other wood elves watched. I&#39;m sure there are some instances of it with other <br/>
races, I&#39;ve just never seen it or been a part of it. In fact, I&#39;ve seen more <br/>
instances of people helping and healing others than I have of mindless <br/>
slaughter. I was scared at first, but it is very exciting, and a little fear <br/>
is healthy on Rallos. =)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been toying with the possibility as well, but I&#39;m waiting on a couple<br/>
things first.<br/>
<br/>
A)  DoT spells are illegal.  Actually anywhere where you can kill your<br/>
opponent indirectly (like ROOTing someone underwater) is illegal because<br/>
they don&#39;t classify that damage or something.  What does this mean?  A<br/>
necromancer is virtually castrated.  NO DoT means no Darkness Spells, No<br/>
Blood, Bo Heart Flutter, etc.  Its sucks really bad.<br/>
<br/>
B) Faction on inter-racial PKing.  Basically this is player enforced.  You<br/>
get a bad mark on your through players only but often this doesn&#39;t mean<br/>
anything.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Some things I&#39;ve noticed or heard about.  Essentially the only place you are<br/>
mostly safe is your own newbie area outside home, even then not much.  But<br/>
in most open areas there&#39;s mostly an unspoken peace.  It is NOT the<br/>
nightmare ambush world a lot of people are afraid of where you can&#39;t rest<br/>
anywhere or anything.  Its bad sometimes, but for the most part you&#39;ll just<br/>
see people giving each other a WIDE berth, with some groups of vigilantes<br/>
running around.  Things are definitely more exciting, and advancing in the<br/>
higher teens is often more difficult simply because your access to other<br/>
areas is somewhat more difficult.  This is mostly on Antonica though.  If<br/>
you start in Faydwer there&#39;s this nasty stuff going on between the Gnomes<br/>
and Elves, but for the most part you are as safe as in nonPvP.  Erud is<br/>
still as crappy as it ever is.  Most of the cool PvP stuff happens on<br/>
Antonica.  It gnaws at me more and more to try out Rallos Zek, but I don&#39;t<br/>
want to do it till they fix DoT spells and other assorted screwups.<br/>

Does anyone play on Rallos Zek?  I was thinking of starting a character<br/>
there, but I have heard both positive and negative things about the server.<br/>
Does it differ a lot from the regular servers, besides anyone can kill you<br/>
within 4 levels?  Do you still have the evil races grouping with the good<br/>
races or do they tend to group among their own race?  How is the rampant Pk<br/>
situation, human killing other humans etc..??  Sorry for all the questions<br/>
but I&#39;m getting bored with fighting NPCs on E&#39;ci and I think being able to<br/>
fight the goodie goodies would spice it up a lot.<br/>
<br/>
I was also thinking of joining a guild and participating in guildwars but I<br/>
haven&#39;t heard of any guilds doing that and what I see, all the guilds are<br/>
letting every race/class in.  Which, IMHO isn&#39;t RP at all.  Even if the<br/>
&quot;evil&quot; character claims that he has turned good.<br/>
