<div id="ygrps-yiv-1085108279">That&#39;s good!  Hire people to do their shopping.  All my friends are in<br/>
the human territories unforunately, and I am stuck in Erudin.  I did<br/>
take the boat from Erudin to Quetos (however you spell it) but they<br/>
killed as soon as I got off the boat instantly.  It was quite nerve<br/>
wracking.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to try to meet up with them again, but I&#39;ve gotta be quick<br/>
and get heck outta Quetos real fast..as soon as I land without runing<br/>
into NPCs.  <br/>
<br/>
Are there and Erudin Necros here?  I&#39;d just like to discuss a few<br/>
tips, like where do you get water from in Erudin?  I&#39;m gonna hopefully<br/>
talk to one of the wizards around there to pick up a fishing rod for<br/>
me, so food is not going to be a problem soon I hope.<br/>
<br/>
Problem with Erudin (hopefully there are some from Erudin here) it<br/>
doesn&#39;t seem too busy.  There&#39;s like an average of 6 - 8 people on the<br/>
Veeshan server.  They are all wizards, so getting a nicely mixed party<br/>
together is impossible.  <br/>
