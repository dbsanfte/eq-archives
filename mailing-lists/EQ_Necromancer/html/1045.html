<div id="ygrps-yiv-612211260">I made the trip the other night, and it wasn&#39;t nearly as nerve wracking as<br/>
I&#39;d expected.  The guards are very easy to avoid, gather shadows is your<br/>
friend :)  I did however die to a rather unfortunate pathing bug.  There was<br/>
a guard IN the water under the docks in Faydwer...imagine my surprise when<br/>
my invis wore off at the end of the dock and some guard hit me for 110dmg<br/>
from under the water :)<br/>

&gt; harowing trip.  If you make it though, it ids a good place to learn :)<br/>
