&gt; If you believe the man who takes care of the spells (ie. <br/>
&gt; summon elemental,<br/>
&gt; skels) for the game, The Magician has the best pets.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Check out the news abt magicians on eq.stratics.com and eqvault<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; We get better pets overall than mages, we get a huge line <br/>

better then ALOT of other classes. It can be better to be 2nd best in<br/>
several things then best in one and worst in another.<br/>
<br/>
More specifically, and the post by GZ even says as much, the necro&#39;s pet has<br/>
more hitpoints then a fire, air or water elemental but less then an earth<br/>
elemental. They also have better AC then a earth, fire or water elemental<br/>
but less then an AIR elemental. GZ even says that magi should use a Air<br/>
elemental to SOLO as value of high AC becomes more and more important at<br/>
higher levels as it causes the MOBS to hit for less damage and miss more.<br/>
Since an Earth elemental has the worst AC of any pet it gets mauled at higer<br/>
levels for max damage just about every swing. This means a dead earth<br/>
elemental. Since the necromancer&#39;s pet has 2nd best HPS and 2nd best AC that<br/>
COMBINATION makes them much better over all at higher levels then a mage<br/>
pet.<br/>
<br/>
I am not very high level yet but so far my lev 7 necromancer has had it far<br/>
easier with his pet then my lev 16 magician ever did at the same levels.<br/>
