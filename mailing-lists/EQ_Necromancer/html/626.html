<div id="ygrps-yiv-655527530">I have an Erudite Necromancer on Bertoxxulous. I aquire food, water, and<br/>
spells all from the Necromancers guild. As far as joining a party, well I<br/>
have made it to level four with out joining a party.. such is the life of<br/>
Asmoden. Wait until you can make yourself invisible to get out of Erudite,<br/>
unless some one knows a secret way..<br/>

&gt;That&#39;s good!  Hire people to do their shopping.  All my friends are in<br/>
&gt;the human territories unforunately, and I am stuck in Erudin.  I did<br/>
&gt;take the boat from Erudin to Quetos (however you spell it) but they<br/>
&gt;killed as soon as I got off the boat instantly.  It was quite nerve<br/>
&gt;wracking.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m going to try to meet up with them again, but I&#39;ve gotta be quick<br/>
&gt;and get heck outta Quetos real fast..as soon as I land without runing<br/>
&gt;into NPCs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Are there and Erudin Necros here?  I&#39;d just like to discuss a few<br/>
&gt;tips, like where do you get water from in Erudin?  I&#39;m gonna hopefully<br/>
&gt;talk to one of the wizards around there to pick up a fishing rod for<br/>
&gt;me, so food is not going to be a problem soon I hope.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Problem with Erudin (hopefully there are some from Erudin here) it<br/>
&gt;doesn&#39;t seem too busy.  There&#39;s like an average of 6 - 8 people on the<br/>
&gt;Veeshan server.  They are all wizards, so getting a nicely mixed party<br/>
&gt;together is impossible.<br/>
