<div id="ygrps-yiv-240958015">Banshee AUra can occasionally be found in Grobb, although you usually have to research that spell. Restless Bones can be found in Grobb, although Verant changes spells locations around and it&#39;s been awhile since I was level 20. Spirit  Armor simply adds armor to your class and is a pretty good spell.  The 3 dots do roughly 450-500 damage. As for the pet the best way to use one in dungeons is not to use one :).<br/>
