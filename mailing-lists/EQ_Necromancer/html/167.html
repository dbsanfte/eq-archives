<div id="ygrps-yiv-1484059082"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;I just got level 16.  Wih all the new spells i have i know i can take more<br/>
 </span></blockquote>than just barely blue orcs that spawn, so where can I fight?  What zone.. what<br/>
mobs etc..&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I personally try and fight yellow only.  I adventure almost exclusively with an<br/>
Erudin Wizard and we regularly take on reds (that we know are not TOO high).<br/>
<br/>
I hit 16 yesterday and we went to the Southern Desert of Ro and have been<br/>
killing dry monk skeletons (con yellow or red) and anything else that pops up.<br/>
<br/>
One of the biggest hidden zones that Ive found is the Rathe Mountains.<br/>
Excellent zone for characters 9-35.</div>
