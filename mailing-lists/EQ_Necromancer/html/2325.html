&gt; &gt; Alright Oskar,<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Got the game at the weekend, eventually got my account registered and<br/>
&gt; &gt; started playing. I started a highlander and I&#39;ve only played it for a<br/>
&gt; couple<br/>
&gt; &gt; of hours but it seemed very slow going. Dont know if it&#39;s just the<br/>
&gt; &gt; town(Hamburton) I started in but there didn&#39;t seem to be much going on<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; &gt; the area, monster wise. Suffice to say I&#39;ve only just started so I&#39;ll<br/>
keep<br/>
&gt; &gt; going and see how it goes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Just kill every yellow, blue or green you see.  You don&#39;t lose xp, so dying<br/>
is<br/>
only inconvenient. I think not dying and fighting lots of blues is better<br/>
than dying<br/>
while trying to kill yellows. Group up if you can. You can fight yellows and<br/>
oranges<br/>
and get much better xp.<br/>
<br/>
I thought Tasks (mentioned by Howler) are only available to 5th level or<br/>
higher.<br/>
You start losing con when you die at 5th, and losing xp at 6th. They are<br/>
great<br/>
xp when you are soloing, because most of the monsters are blue, but killing<br/>
them<br/>
as a Task gives you extra xp. I generally use the command /whisper task.<br/>
<br/>
Armor and equipment: These have con levels just like the monsters. You will<br/>
go up pretty fast so try to buy orange or red stuff. Money will be very<br/>
tight for<br/>
awhile. Armsman get a weapon at 5th level, so save the money for armor.<br/>
<br/>
Armor is not created equal. Your torso and leg armor count for more of your<br/>
armor factor than the other pieces. Buy these first if you can.<br/>
<br/>
Getting player crafted armor.<br/>
<br/>
Surf around the internet and you can find various price sheets and<br/>
spreadsheets<br/>
for playercrafted armor.  Visit the merchants and find some armor that cons<br/>
orange or red, then find the kinds you can afford on the price sheets. Go to<br/>
the<br/>
forge and just politely ask around for an armorcrafter and then negotiate<br/>
the<br/>
deal. For low level armor, the armorcrafter may just give it to you, but of<br/>
course you have to wait for him or her to make that offer. </span></blockquote></div>
