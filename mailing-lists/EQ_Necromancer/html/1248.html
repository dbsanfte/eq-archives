<div id="ygrps-yiv-2018271818">Hey, congrats on level 16.  I just reached there last night, myself, and<br/>
was very eager to try out the new pet.  I&#39;d heard it was allot better.  I<br/>
don&#39;t really see any improvements, but I think I should tell you that if you<br/>
get a blue &quot;looks kind of risky, but might be worth a try&quot; con - or<br/>
something like that - recast for another. LoL I used one of those, and the<br/>
most damage it did was a six!  If you see any improvements over the last,<br/>
please give me a /tell or an E-Mail, can you?<br/>
<br/>
    I&#39;m in North Karana currently, and it seems like a very good place.  If<br/>
not dangerous.  The griffawns (I believe that&#39;s the spelling) can be blue or<br/>
white - more typically blue - and the borer beetles are usually white con or<br/>
sometimes yellow, and pincer beetles typically come up as blue.  If you want<br/>
a challenge, there&#39;s the lovely Sycthe Beetles, that will typically be<br/>
yellow or red, more often red.  They hit for about 32 pts, twice in a row.<br/>
So you&#39;ll want to be careful of them.  Oh, and if you take on a griffawn, be<br/>
sure you&#39;re near a zone point. LoL  They seem to have a rather fast attack,<br/>
and multiples at that...<br/>
<br/>
    If you&#39;ve worked out your faction in Black Burrow, you can run to the<br/>
guards.  The first tower coming from Qeynos isn&#39;t too far away.  But be<br/>
warned, I was there last night, and that tower seems like a virtual griffawn<br/>
magnet.  The poor guards, one right after another, then a hill giant came by<br/>
and finished them off.  Fun to see, at least. hehe.<br/>
<br/>
    You&#39;ll also encounter the occasional blue grizzly, and green &quot;not sure&quot;<br/>
(still gives a tiny bit of exp) silvermist wolf.  Careful of them wolves,<br/>
they&#39;ve hit me for 22 or so. ;)<br/>
<br/>
    Hm, all of that, and I&#39;ve hardly ventured out into the zone.  LoL<br/>
Taking little baby steps, I don&#39;t want to lose the level.  I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll<br/>
find more.  Oh, watch out for treants. ;)<br/>
<br/>
Have fun!<br/>

&gt;  Greetings Dark friends,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I just made level 16 today and I am very excited about testing it out.  I<br/>
&gt; wanted some suggestions on where to hunt between level 16 and 20. I have<br/>
&gt; heard from you all saying that the Karanas and Lake Rathe are good.<br/>
Please,<br/>
&gt; any advise would be appreciated.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Oh, and the stormy weather? Well I live in Myrtle Beach and Hurricane<br/>
Floyd<br/>
&gt; is dropping in to say hello=(<br/>
