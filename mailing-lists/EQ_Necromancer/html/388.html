<div id="ygrps-yiv-803601248">at low levels disease cloud is pretty effective, mainly because it prevents <br/>
normal healing for the course of the disease.  it is worthless to care if a <br/>
darkweed snake regens 10 pts of damage when you are L8, but if you are L2 <br/>
and fighting a spiderling, it could mean the difference between killing or <br/>
being killed.<br/>

&gt;I&#39;m 4th lvl right now.. I&#39;ve used the disease cloud, but it seems a little <br/>
&gt;ineffectual in regards to the time it takes something to wallop you. <br/>
&gt;Perhaps that is because it is such a low spell though.<br/>

&gt;     As a Necro you should know this.  Its stands for Damage Over Time.  <br/>
&gt;Spells like all your Darkness spells, Heat Blood, Blood Boil, Poison Bolt, <br/>
&gt;pretty much everything in our offensive category except LifeDrain spells <br/>
&gt;can be classified under DoT.  LifeDrain is a DD spell, which stands for <br/>
&gt;Direct Damage.<br/>

&gt;             I&#39;ve been toying with the possibility as well, but I&#39;m waiting <br/>
&gt;on a couple things first.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;             A)  DoT spells are illegal.  Actually anywhere where you can <br/>
&gt;kill your opponent indirectly (like ROOTing someone underwater) is illegal <br/>
&gt;because they don&#39;t classify that damage or something.  What does this mean? <br/>
&gt;  A necromancer is virtually castrated.  NO DoT means no Darkness Spells, <br/>
&gt;No Blood, Bo Heart Flutter, etc.  Its sucks really bad.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;             B) Faction on inter-racial PKing.  Basically this is player <br/>
&gt;enforced.  You get a bad mark on your through players only but often this <br/>
&gt;doesn&#39;t mean anything.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;             Some things I&#39;ve noticed or heard about.  Essentially the only <br/>
&gt;place you are mostly safe is your own newbie area outside home, even then <br/>
&gt;not much.  But in most open areas there&#39;s mostly an unspoken peace.  It is <br/>
&gt;NOT the nightmare ambush world a lot of people are afraid of where you <br/>
&gt;can&#39;t rest anywhere or anything.  Its bad sometimes, but for the most part <br/>
&gt;you&#39;ll just see people giving each other a WIDE berth, with some groups of <br/>
&gt;vigilantes running around.  Things are definitely more exciting, and <br/>
&gt;advancing in the higher teens is often more difficult simply because your <br/>
&gt;access to other areas is somewhat more difficult.  This is mostly on <br/>
&gt;Antonica though.  If you start in Faydwer there&#39;s this nasty stuff going on <br/>
&gt;between the Gnomes and Elves, but for the most part you are as safe as in <br/>
&gt;nonPvP.  Erud is still as crappy as it ever is.  Most of the cool PvP stuff <br/>
&gt;happens on Antonica.  It gnaws at me more and more to try out Rallos Zek, <br/>
&gt;but I don&#39;t want to do it till they fix DoT spells and other assorted <br/>
&gt;screwups.<br/>

&gt;                 Does anyone play on Rallos Zek?  I was thinking of <br/>
&gt;starting a character there, but I have heard both positive and negative <br/>
&gt;things about the server.  Does it differ a lot from the regular servers, <br/>
&gt;besides anyone can kill you within 4 levels?  Do you still have the evil <br/>
&gt;races grouping with the good races or do they tend to group among their own <br/>
&gt;race?  How is the rampant Pk situation, human killing other humans etc..??  <br/>
&gt;Sorry for all the questions but I&#39;m getting bored with fighting NPCs on <br/>
&gt;E&#39;ci and I think being able to fight the goodie goodies would spice it up a <br/>
&gt;lot.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;                 I was also thinking of joining a guild and participating <br/>
&gt;in guildwars but I haven&#39;t heard of any guilds doing that and what I see, <br/>
&gt;all the guilds are letting every race/class in.  Which, IMHO isn&#39;t RP at <br/>
&gt;all.  Even if the &quot;evil&quot; character claims that he has turned good.<br/>
