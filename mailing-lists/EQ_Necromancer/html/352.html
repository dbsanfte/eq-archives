<div id="ygrps-yiv-284201527">i think they want to keep some stuff mysterious so it&#39;s more interesting.<br/>
WHen they give u every number, eq will become pretty mechanical.  power<br/>
players can figure out a formula to do stuff and ruin the game fun IMO.<br/>
<br/>
as for mana..i think i heard a formula somewhere   mana=(int or wis/5 +2)*<br/>
levels<br/>
<br/>
not too sure though<br/>

&gt;    Pricks like me? Bah, I wont take this part to the message list.  Though<br/>
&gt;it&#39;s interesting to note I&#39;m &quot;a prick&quot; because I don&#39;t like the game or<br/>
&gt;varant, and say so.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;        As for the game, I loved it at first, sure.  I read all the hype,<br/>
&gt;looked at all the screen shots, etc.  Had allot planned out, too, and all<br/>

 </span></blockquote>of<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;some idiotic limitation or another, got burned a bit further when I found I<br/>
&gt;couldn&#39;t stand back and plan fights out and just had to rush in and start<br/>
&gt;swinging (why are we magic classes?), or do the same with the pet.  But I<br/>
&gt;dealt with it.  Then there&#39;s the problems with the spells, variant&#39;s<br/>
 </span></blockquote>general<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;attitude towards the Necro class, and a ton of other problems.  Just makes<br/>
&gt;me think they&#39;ve got  a big head about &#39;em and they don&#39;t really give a<br/>
&gt;stink &#39;bout us players.  That&#39;s what ticks me off the most, not being free<br/>
&gt;to come up with our own strategy or using our class to their full potential<br/>
&gt;because of deliberate restrictions comes in a very fast second.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;        As for why it&#39;s important to see the number of your mana.  I&#39;m the<br/>
&gt;type of person who likes to plan ahead, _way_ ahead.  Deciding which spells<br/>
&gt;to memorize, in what order to cast them, which to buy and not to buy, and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>so<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;on and so on.  The amount you have plays allot in this.  Say, for<br/>
&gt;instance... You have a total of 200 mana and you have 50 left.  Cost 45 to<br/>
&gt;cast a certain spell.  You can either use a spell to get out of there and<br/>
&gt;survive or cast that one and leave you with only 5mana left, and thus,<br/>
&gt;totally open.  Not knowing how much you have left, just a silly bar graph,<br/>
&gt;you go ahead and cast it.  Whoops, you just peeved out the mob, it&#39;s<br/>
&gt;frenzying you, and you&#39;ve no way to get the heaven&#39;s out of there.  I know,<br/>
&gt;Gate and such takes way more mana than that, but for an example it&#39;ll do.<br/>
&gt;If you&#39;d known precisely what you had, along with knowing how much a spell<br/>
&gt;takes (as we do, at least), you&#39;d have been able to very quickly figure<br/>
 </span></blockquote>that<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;the escape, was the way to go.  Besides, I like knowing.  The least they<br/>
&gt;could do is make it an option.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;        As for ruining play, I make it a point to be very helpful to others<br/>
&gt;in the game, especialy to newbies and such.  I figure players have it hard<br/>
&gt;enough without somebody making it a pain for &#39;em, may as well help.  I<br/>
 </span></blockquote>don&#39;t<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;see where that&#39;s ruining play. :-)  Just simply, I don&#39;t like Varant.  I<br/>
&gt;think I&#39;ll leave EQ, soon as somebody else comes out with 3D fantasy world.<br/>
&gt;It&#39;ll happen soon enough, but until, it&#39;ll &quot;have to do&quot;.  As much as I<br/>

&gt;nice chance to role-play (if you can find somebody to do so with) and I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;waited a very long time for at least somebody to _attempt_ a real fantasy<br/>
&gt;world for your charecter to live in.<br/>

&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Why do they have to put the actual number of how much mana you have? if<br/>
&gt;you<br/>
&gt;&gt; can&#39;t cast the spell then you can&#39;t cast it. You know by testing, and if<br/>
&gt;you<br/>
&gt;&gt; are any good then you already know about how much you can cast before you<br/>
&gt;run<br/>
&gt;&gt; out. I think you need to just calm down, and then think about what you<br/>
&gt;&gt; posted. The slogan is cool, and you obviously liked the game for atleast<br/>
