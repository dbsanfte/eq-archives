&gt; What else can I hunt solo to go from 26-29 fast ? I am now hunting the<br/>

keep their spawn apart and they rip my pet big time..... Is the new darkness<br/>
and heat blood at 29th that much better??<br/>

I did the Millers to 29 as well, but that was before the DOT patch, and I<br/>
had jboots...you might want to try a darkness/blood/fear combo, *then* send<br/>
the pet...<br/>

Yes, the lvl 29th darkness and blood are *awesome* darkness will slow the<br/>
mob to a walk at best, add in venom of the snake and invoke fear at 34 and<br/>
you&#39;ve got a *nasty* dot/fear combo that will let you solo whites.</div>
