∩┐╜∩┐╜∩┐╜ Personally if I were you, I would not attempt the trip till you have<br/>
Spirit of the Wolf for your shaman.∩┐╜ The trip IS possible before hand, but<br/>
there are so many sand giants, drybones skeletons and desert madmen (not<br/>
counting the roaming orc warriors) out there that sometimes I even have<br/>
trouble WITH SOW.∩┐╜ South Ro will be easy if you stay on the West side (ie<br/>
the side without all the orc camps... err.. maybe its the east side, dammit,<br/>
if you see an orc camp you are on the wrong side).∩┐╜ Oasis is the nasty<br/>
part.∩┐╜ There&#39;s no GOOD way to get through there.∩┐╜ My usual tactics is with<br/>
SOW hug the water, dodge crocs and SGs but keep running.∩┐╜ With SOW you&#39;ll be<br/>
fine no matter how many monsters you train, just don&#39;t STOP!∩┐╜ Without it I<br/>
would say go slower.∩┐╜ Dark Elves have an easier time because they are faster<br/>
and can hide at a moment&#39;s notice.∩┐╜ Sand Giant bearing down on you?∩┐╜ Hotkey<br/>
HIDE and patiently wait for him to stop stepping on you.∩┐╜ Plus not<br/>
everything is agg to you.∩┐╜ The Innkeepers in Oasis don&#39;t seem to be KOS for<br/>
Dark Elves but they have an extreme distaste for Ogres and Trolls, plus they<br/>
all have that ultra-commando level 50 combat training that makes them deadly<br/>
in round one.∩┐╜ North Ro is fine as is East commonlands if you hug the zone<br/>
walls.∩┐╜ Oasis is what kills you.∩┐╜ I would recommend the Dark Elf coming to<br/>
the Innothule before level 8, and the Ogre coming to Neriak after 8 (with<br/>
SOW).<br/>

Subject: [EQ_Necromancer] Newbie Questions..<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
∩┐╜∩┐╜∩┐╜ Having grown dissatisfied with the &quot;good&quot; side of EQ life.. A friend and<br/>
I decided we wanted to try our hands at Evil..<br/>
∩┐╜<br/>
∩┐╜∩┐╜∩┐╜ Having decided that we next sat down and tried to figure what would be<br/>
the best combination for a 2 man team..<br/>
∩┐╜<br/>
∩┐╜∩┐╜∩┐╜ I&#39;ve always loved the pet classes.. And knowing that Necros are possibly<br/>
the best solo class in the game.. I quickly set up Ahiru.. Dark Elf<br/>
Necromancer and half sister of my Erudite Wizard character Uhira..∩┐╜ <br/>
∩┐╜<br/>
∩┐╜∩┐╜∩┐╜ My friend, who has always gone between liking to beat stuff to death and<br/>
liking to cast spells (previous 2 characters a Druid and a Barb Warrior)..∩┐╜<br/>
Settled on an Ogre Shaman..∩┐╜ We were surprised after all the stories about<br/>
how bad a shaman ogres make to find that he was readily able to get his<br/>
Wisdom up to 102 (not great, but not terrible by any standards..)∩┐╜ Combined<br/>
with ogres natural brutishness and great range of spells (heals, buffs,<br/>
damage, and utils like SoW) we thought this would be a pretty wicked<br/>
combination..<br/>
∩┐╜<br/>
∩┐╜∩┐╜∩┐╜ First question of course is is there any reason why this combination is<br/>
a BAD choice?<br/>
∩┐╜∩┐╜∩┐╜ Second had to do with the regions..∩┐╜ Nektulos and Innothule are nice<br/>
newbie zones (a tad rougher than their &quot;good&quot; equivalents, but giving them<br/>
better range..∩┐╜ Outside of these zones we&#39;re wondering what life is like..<br/>
∩┐╜<br/>
Specifically what is the trip from Innothule Swamp to Freeport/Nektulos like<br/>
and at what level is it safe to attempt..?∩┐╜ Also which zones will be better<br/>
to explore as we go up in level (not planning to try and meet until we&#39;re<br/>
about 5th so we both have gate spells)..<br/>
∩┐╜<br/>
∩┐╜∩┐╜∩┐╜ Ok.. Ramble aside what it boils down to is.. Which is better.. Befallen<br/>
or Guk? Why? and what level should we hit the area?<br/>
∩┐╜<br/>
Thanks..<br/>
