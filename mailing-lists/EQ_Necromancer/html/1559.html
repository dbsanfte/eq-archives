<div id="ygrps-yiv-1106427968">I know that in the beginning of this quest you need to get a shadowed <br/>
scythe.Once you turn that in you get a note asking for the additional 3 <br/>
needed items.My question is, if you already know the other 3 items needed, do <br/>
you even have to do the shadowed scythe part?Also, can someone please give me <br/>
the approximate level of the goblin in OOT who drops the shadowed knife?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance!<br/>
