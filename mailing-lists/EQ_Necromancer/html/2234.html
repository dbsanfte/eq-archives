<b>Subject:</b> Re: [EQ_Necromancer] Should pets be given weapons above level 20? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-745840797">It is my understanding and my experience that says weapons to pets from 16 <br/>
to 28 are just a waste of pp. At 29 your pet will begin to dual wield and <br/>
will require 2, 1 hand weapons. As for the AC flag I have been told by many <br/>
long time Necro&#39;s that a single piece of armor will help your pet with AC. <br/>
How much I don&#39;t know.<br/>
