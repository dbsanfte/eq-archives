<div id="ygrps-yiv-1914911644">So no one had anything to say about the DOT nurf?   I thought I would see tons of email.  Maybe everyone is playing since the servers were down for so stinking long.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway I like the way they did the DOT nurf, I usually finght in a group so it HELPED me cus DAM was increased if they run less then 18 seconds.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
