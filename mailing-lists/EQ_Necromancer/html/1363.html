<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1075756873">Greetings everybody,<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to let everyone know, that my server,<br/>
Quellious, now has a necromancer only guild called the<br/>
Lords of the Undead. It is relatively small still,<br/>
about 15 members, but growing decently well. If you<br/>
are interested, give me a tell in game, or give<br/>
Bramdar/Smegoul a tell as well.<br/>
<br/>
Good hunting!<br/>
<br/>
Darkmoon Somberlight level 24 Necromancer<br/>
<br/>
P.S. Just got shock of poison, and the wait was well<br/>
worth it. Nothing like seeing a treant fall in four<br/>
shots. :)<br/>
