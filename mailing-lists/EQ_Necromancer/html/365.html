<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1961124695">Simple question about this one.  When is it effective and when is it<br/>
not?  I cast it on some skeletons that were attacking others in Befallen,<br/>
and it said that it appeared...well, I forget the word that it uses, but it<br/>
was successful.  However the creature continued to smack the player around.<br/>
<br/>
    So.. does it slow the attacks, or just not work while it&#39;s fighting and<br/>
just needs to be cast on the creature while it&#39;s still just standing or<br/>
wandering around?  Or would it have been something else that immediatly<br/>
ticked it off again?  The player, in one instance, was just running and not<br/>
swinging back.  I didn&#39;t have enough for a Ward nor wanted to chance ticking<br/>
it off and being smacked around myself.  Thanks folks.<br/>
