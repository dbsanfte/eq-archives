<div id="ygrps-yiv-2101195936">I used to give my Bone Walk and less pets weapons, they are quite<br/>
useful.  Shields also when you are wellfunded.  After that I don&#39;t see a<br/>
reason, but there&#39;s a large debate on whether or not this is good or not.<br/>
Basically if you have spares and don&#39;t need the cash, go ahead. Just<br/>
remember on nonPvP (and usually very difficult on PvP) that you won&#39;t be<br/>
getting your weapon back, so don&#39;t be giving your skel a Combine Dagger or<br/>
anything expensive.<br/>

<br/>
Has anyone given any swords or anything to your pets?   I was thinking about<br/>
trying to save up for a Mino Axe if you can get the axe back after your skel<br/>
is killed.   Otherwise I don&#39;t think I will use weapons.  Or is it more<br/>
damage??<br/>
<br/>
Any info on weapons for your pets would be GREAT! Thanks!<br/>
