then it was only to kill a wandering skeleton when I didn&#39;t feel like<br/>
getting a pet).<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Writhing has a nice dmg/delay even if it doesn&#39;t proc.  I kept mine in an<br/>
evil eye bag for 12 levels or so, and only took it out on the rare<br/>
occasion I was meleeing.  -9 CHA sucks for dominate undead, screaming<br/>
terror, and fear, but otherwise isn&#39;t a big deal.  <br/>
<br/>
Dragoon dirk can go in range weapon slot, but be careful not to throw it<br/>
(or get charmed, I&#39;ve heard tales of thrown weapons being used that way).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; sell the dragoon dirk, as the staff is slightly better; what&#39;s its<br/>
&gt; current value (I&#39;m on Innoruuk)?  guessing-- 50pp?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t know innoruuk prices, you could get 50 in minutes, 75 with patience<br/>
and 125 if you got very very lucky on quellious.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; sell the staff, as I can (probably) get more money for it; what&#39;s its<br/>
&gt; current value?  guessing--200pp?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>People are realizing that it&#39;s not that good a staff, and the temple of<br/>
sol ro quests are giving L25+ people much better choices, so price has<br/>
dropped a lot.  Somewhere 100-200 is about right.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; second, what&#39;s the best way to get another stein?  I&#39;ve heard people<br/>
&gt; hunting bouncers often give them away; what zone are they in?  <br/>
&gt; Ferrott?  Oggok?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Feerott, outside or inside oggok.  Used to be they were left to rot or<br/>
sold to ogre vendors (10pp or so to buy them back), but I don&#39;t know if<br/>
the recent guard buff/nerf has changed this.<br/>
