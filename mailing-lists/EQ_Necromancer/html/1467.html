<div id="ygrps-yiv-2041224946">It&#39;s not a bug.  It&#39;s a feature.  Tell me, would you be ready to attack me if I were<br/>
sneaking behind your back?  There is only 1 class that can purchase from anybody.  That<br/>
is a rogue, with their sneak.<br/>

&gt; There is a &quot;bug&quot; where if you sneak, you can use merchants/bankers that are<br/>
&gt; dubious, not sure about threatening or scowling though...you have to be<br/>
&gt; standing *behind* them for it to work and I&#39;ve never tested it with invis<br/>
&gt; but I&#39;m pretty sure the target creature has to be dubious.  *but* Even if<br/>
&gt; you could get the cloak off the enchanter in najena...are you about to<br/>
&gt; attempt infiltrating Felwithe while invis?  Sounds like suicide to me, not<br/>
&gt; to mention a nightmare of a corpse recovery mission.  Get a molten cloak ;)<br/>
&gt; and make up the 1 int somewhere else.<br/>

&gt; &gt; hi !<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I heard from some sources (not sure where since i already deleted the<br/>
&gt; mail) that<br/>
&gt; &gt; quests are able to be completed while under Invisibility .<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; They stated examples by completing the Mystic Cloak quest<br/>
&gt; &gt; (8ac +5int +5sv magic 10 charges SteelSkin) .<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; A few days later i attempted to try this out myself by camping<br/>
&gt; &gt; the Priest of Najena in Unrest . It was a 52 min spawn and more<br/>
&gt; &gt; often than not spawns a regular Ghoul as a placeholder (PH).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; After 16 long hours of waiting in line (only 2 spawned) and getting<br/>
&gt; &gt; the component off the Priest i made off to Najena to complete part<br/>
&gt; &gt; 1 of the quest . unfortunately when i tried to give it to the NPC while<br/>
&gt; &gt; invis , it broke the invisibility and i was charmed and killed by the NPC<br/>
&gt; &gt; (who is a High Elf Enchanter btw) .<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Has anybody else attempted to complete this quest ?<br/>
&gt; &gt; or does anyone have confirmation if quests can be completed<br/>
&gt; &gt; while invis ? pls email me directly as I dont always get the time<br/>
&gt; &gt; to read all this list mails...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; regards,<br/>
