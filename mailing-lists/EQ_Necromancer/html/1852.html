&gt; really? From the previous threads, I was going to go<br/>
&gt; online and buy one since I still use a banshee<br/>
&gt; card....now this is making me do a double take.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anymore input? Please?!?!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have both a Voodoo3 3500 and a Geforce DDR, I prefer the Voodoo.  The<br/>
geforce won&#39;t do mipmapping, so if you extend your clipplane at all you get<br/>
some pretty disgusting texture swimming problems, that and the fact that I<br/>
started crashing anytime there were more than 30 people present (fire<br/>
giants, planes...basically places you definitely don&#39;t want to crash) caused<br/>
me to switch back to my Voodoo for EQ.  Other than those 2 problems, the<br/>
Geforce was *definitely* faster.</div>
