<div id="ygrps-yiv-422714170">What reasons have they given for this, not giving us numerical values<br/>
for our mana ?<br/>
<br/>
        Maybe it&#39;s just the mood I&#39;m in, but do they strike you as pricks?<br/>
I mean, honestly.. they give us, in the spell&#39;s info, how much mana it takes<br/>
to cast it, but they&#39;re out-right refusing to give us numbers showing how<br/>
much mana we have?  They&#39;re just being pricks about it, or at least, that&#39;s<br/>
how it seems to me.  What basis would they have for not?<br/>
<br/>
        Not to mention all of the other limitations, and the &quot;you&#39;re in our<br/>
world now&quot; that I thought was just a cool slogan, but now seems to be more<br/>
of another way to say, &quot;this is our world, we&#39;re in control, we think for<br/>
you, we decide how you play, where you go, what you see, and if you don&#39;t<br/>
like it _leave_ because it&#39;s _MINE_&quot; .  That&#39;s B.S., we pay for this...<br/>
<br/>
    I dunno, I think I&#39;ll keep EQ until another company comes out with a<br/>
full 3D fantasy role-playing world.  You know it&#39;ll happen, and maybe<br/>
they&#39;ll have their stuff straight.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;    While the idea is a good one, Verant is very very very skeptical of<br/>
&gt; putting in any numbers beyond what they have already given. If they were<br/>
&gt; willing to give us this type of spell, they should also be willing to give<br/>
&gt; us a numerical value for our mana -- something they have repeatedly stated<br/>
&gt; that they will not do. Your best bet is to ask for a spell that determines<br/>
&gt; their lvl/abilities in non-numerical ways, otherwise I&#39;m afraid you&#39;ll be<br/>
&gt; talking into a void.<br/>
