<b>Subject:</b> Dark Elves and Necromancer Survival Tactics? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-191036695">Hello.<br/>
<br/>
I have recently started a dark elf necromancer and am quickly up to lev 5.<br/>
The combat strategy seems fairly similar to that of my 16th level magician<br/>
except there I use DD burn and with my necro I am more patient and use my<br/>
DOT spells. I tank more with my necro since I can heal myself and go in<br/>
again for more tanking.<br/>
<br/>
However mages get NO self defense spells or skills. I am wondering which<br/>
ones are best and if you all have any tips for them.<br/>
<br/>
Dark Elf Necromancers get to at some point or another.<br/>
<br/>
1. Hide skill - Is this just press and pray? if something is charging me can<br/>
I still HIDE from it? IE a sand giant attacks my skeleton can I press hide<br/>
to try to survive?<br/>
<br/>
2. Root - At high levels we get root. Is it resisted by everything by that<br/>
high level?<br/>
<br/>
3. Shadow step - How good is casting this then trying for a gate?<br/>
<br/>
4. Feign Death - Seems this could be great. Does this cast fast enough to<br/>
use in an emergency? Is it dependable enough to use to save the party by<br/>
taking on the monster why group flees then cast this and let the train<br/>
dissolve? How long does it last?<br/>
<br/>
5. Gate - This is the only 1 of the list I&#39;m used to as magicians have his<br/>
spell but it&#39;s cast time is slow.<br/>
<br/>
Are there any other survival skills I&#39;ve missed? Seems Necromancers may have<br/>
an easier time of getting out of trouble then magicians do assuming the<br/>
above skills/spells are nice.<br/>
<br/>
Any help is appreciated.<br/>
