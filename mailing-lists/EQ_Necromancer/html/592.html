<div id="ygrps-yiv-821450574">Does anyone know if I am KOS from Fairies or Pixies in Lesser Fay?   Cus I<br/>
wanted to go to the bandit camps there and din&#39;t want to have a RED CONING<br/>
Fairy beat the tar out of me.  I am a gnome Necromancer and I killed many<br/>
orcs in CB but it didn&#39;t seem to help much w/ other races.    I have done<br/>
nothing to affect my fairy faction that I know of and was just wondering.</div>
