lastnight I made 34 :)<br/>
<br/>
Spectres and SG are now even or yellow, and I was hoping someone here has<br/>
solo&#39;d spectres in oasis before... and could tell me a couple of tips :)<br/>
<br/>
Also anyone on E Marr that doesn&#39;t have JBoots yet, or just wants to say<br/>
they&#39;ve done it :) I will be camping S Ro for the ancient cyclops on Sunday,<br/>
most of the day, and company is always appreciated.<br/>
