<div id="ygrps-yiv-748103138">You will have a couple of choices that you can take on at your level which<br/>
are close by, either the commons or you can move to NRo.  Both places should<br/>
have enough spawns to keep you busy at your level (although east commons<br/>
tends to get quite a bit crowded sometimes).  I hunted in w commons solo<br/>
until i hit 12th then moved on.  You should be able to take on yellows at<br/>
your level with no problem now too, so don&#39;t be too afraid of taking on the<br/>
young kodiak in the commons, just be prepared to run if you get into<br/>
trouble.<br/>
<br/>
You start research at 16th level with certain words that are dropped when<br/>
you kill certain level mobs.  If you kill mobs between 16 and 20 they&#39;ll<br/>
sometimes drop words that make up Banshee Aura(which is a 16th level spell)<br/>
or other spells and the same goes for higher level mobs. Luckily you won&#39;t<br/>
have to research your first pet until 34th (unless this has been changed,<br/>
but I don&#39;t think so).  The best thing to do at higher levels for research<br/>
is look for a higher level necro who is close by that wouldn&#39;t mind giving<br/>
you a hand.  I did this when I 34th this weekend and sent a tell to a fellow<br/>
nec who was 39 if they would combine the words and make my pet for me.  Well<br/>
she not only made my pet for me, but also had COB and Surge of Enfeeblement<br/>
that I bought too, so I didn&#39;t have to look for those words now.<br/>
<br/>
The Harvester is a nec quest item that I did at 30/31 (I kept bouncing back<br/>
and forth while killing the shadowmen getting the harverster and other quest<br/>
items that were needed).  The harvester is not a weapon, basically there for<br/>
it&#39;s stat bonuses (something like +8str, deadeye and maybe some int, I don&#39;t<br/>
remember since I&#39;m at work) and looks.  There are about 5 quests in the<br/>
Temple of Ro for nec&#39;s that you could almost do without killing the people<br/>
necessary, like items from unrest, where you can shout to see if you could<br/>
loot a fungus eye or a werebat wings for some of the kills since not every<br/>
class needs or even cares about these items.  Some of the other quest items<br/>
are easy enough, with gather shadows that you can walk right into the zone<br/>
and pick up the item that you need and get out.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck<br/>

	I have a couple questions. I just turned level 7 last night I am<br/>
Tarew Marr<br/>
Server. I am DE and in Neriak or actually Nektulos Forrest. It is slow<br/>
Advancement I played for about 1 1/2 hours, solong taking anything that<br/>
wasn&#39;t yello or higher. I was wondering if there was a better place for this<br/>
other then Nektulos Forrest also. At what level do you actually have to<br/>
research your first pet spell and above all else this one I want to know<br/>
more then anything Else. What is the Harvester. It is a Scythe which is<br/>
slashing and one handed none the less because the person eho had it had a<br/>
Stien in his hand he was being stuck up and wouldn&#39;t talk to me. I wanted to<br/>
know what the Harvester is and where can I get it. I know it wont be for<br/>
awhile but it looks cool and it just says Grim Reaper All over So if you can<br/>
help I would be much appriciated. Also how about Robe of enshroudment. hehe<br/>
just curious thanks all.<br/>
