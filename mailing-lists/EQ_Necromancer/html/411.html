<div id="ygrps-yiv-1369887257">Well I am only 2nd lvl and I wanted a opinion on race too, I am a dark elf<br/>
and yeah KOS sucks, but I can get that better through work right?  I might<br/>
restart the char after hearing from you.   I have 130 int and I put the rest<br/>
in dex . . .     is the Euidite or  Gnome a better choice?  And how KOS<br/>
prone are Gnome Necromancers or Euridites?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks . ..<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  any gnome necros get KOS by dwarves or high elves wood elves or<br/>
humans?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
