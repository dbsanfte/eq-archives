<div id="ygrps-yiv-874480358">Unless you have raided crushbone you can enter neriak... Once you get near <br/>
the Necro guild you will have to invis to undead... There are 3 ghouls there <br/>
an if they attack you so will the other guild vendors/trainers... and they <br/>
will be aggro to you... Once past them you are safe... If you have killed <br/>
crushbone orcs... Forget it... They hurt faction with neraik guards and by <br/>
default you will be apprenhensive to them...<br/>

&gt;As A L16 Gnome nec can I enter the home city of Dark Elves and proceed to <br/>
&gt;3d<br/>
&gt;gate and purchase spells w/o being KOS?  Also, is the book Dark Binding, <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;one used for research in Necro spells, if not what is its name?  To get <br/>
&gt;there I<br/>
&gt;assume its the boat, get off at human port, and head North to Dark Elf <br/>
&gt;city?<br/>

&gt; &gt; Banshee AUra can occasionally be found in Grobb, although you usually <br/>
&gt;have to<br/>
&gt; &gt; research that spell. Restless Bones can be found in Grobb, although <br/>
&gt;Verant<br/>
&gt; &gt; changes spells locations around and it&#39;s been awhile since I was level <br/>
&gt;20.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Spirit  Armor simply adds armor to your class and is a pretty good <br/>
&gt;spell.<br/>
&gt; &gt; The 3 dots do roughly 450-500 damage. As for the pet the best way to use <br/>
&gt;one<br/>
&gt; &gt; in dungeons is not to use one :).<br/>
