 </span></blockquote>It does sound like it. In fact, almost exactly a year ago I downloaded the<br/>
Anarchy Online demo, willing to consider leaving EQ for another game. But AO<br/>
turned out to be inferior, as far as I could tell, so I stayed. It sounds<br/>
like I should have tried DAoC instead, and might have switched.<br/>
<br/>
But in the last year the /amount/ of change has been as breathtaking as the<br/>
changes themselves, and other than a single bug which makes my machine<br/>
hesitate for several seconds every once in a while, sometimes getting me<br/>
killed (and all MMORPGs have occasional graphics bugs), I&#39;ve turned around<br/>
and grown really happy with EQ again. Sony seems to have made its<br/>
development, improvement, and stability a very high priority.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, I&#39;m curious enough that if there were a demo of DAoC, I&#39;d<br/>
download it. But a quick perusal of the site doesn&#39;t reveal one, and I&#39;m<br/>
certainly not going to pay money for the game at a store &quot;just in case&quot; I<br/>
might like it more. <br/>
<br/>
Do they not have a way to demo it free? Even EQ gave out free registration<br/>
keys to all existing accounts so that people could share/demo the game to<br/>
their friends...<br/>
