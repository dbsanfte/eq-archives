<div id="ygrps-yiv-2115953420">As A L16 Gnome nec can I enter the home city of Dark Elves and proceed to 3d<br/>
gate and purchase spells w/o being KOS?  Also, is the book Dark Binding, the<br/>
one used for research in Necro spells, if not what is its name?  To get there I<br/>
assume its the boat, get off at human port, and head North to Dark Elf city?<br/>

&gt; Banshee AUra can occasionally be found in Grobb, although you usually have to<br/>
&gt; research that spell. Restless Bones can be found in Grobb, although Verant<br/>
&gt; changes spells locations around and it&#39;s been awhile since I was level 20.<br/>
&gt; Spirit  Armor simply adds armor to your class and is a pretty good spell. <br/>
&gt; The 3 dots do roughly 450-500 damage. As for the pet the best way to use one<br/>
&gt; in dungeons is not to use one :).<br/>
