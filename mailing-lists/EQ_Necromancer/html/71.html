&gt; I&#39;ve also been told not to go to North Freeport, because you will be<br/>
&gt; KOS. The guards are all paladins... Don&#39;t know if it&#39;s true or not,<br/>
&gt; never been there. But the question still remains from the original<br/>
&gt; post: Where is the necro guild in Freeport, if there is one?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll try to be more specific this time :)<br/>
In East Freeport, there is a slum area, with building marked as &quot;condemned&quot;<br/>
if you enter this building through the upstairs door, you should find a<br/>
stair way which leads to a small room.  There is a false wall in this room<br/>
which leads to another stairway.  Keep going down until you hear the<br/>
familiar sounds of necro spellcasting :)<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also, I&#39;m new to the list, here is a little bio info..<br/>
&gt; Playing a Dark Elven Necro named Kagon currently level 6 on Fennin<br/>
&gt; (yes, I try to roleplay), who hasn&#39;t even been over the other side of<br/>
&gt; the bridge yet in Nektulos Forest, nevermind outside the zone =P<br/>
&gt; Necros just level too quick! I also have a Wood Elven Ranger (who<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t) that I&#39;ve been neglecting since I started the necro this past<br/>
&gt; weekend. Just havin too much fun, I love being able to take on whites<br/>
&gt; and yellows consistently.<br/>
<br/>
Amen, I have a 6th level ranger that took me a good 3 weeks to build up, my<br/>
Human Necromancer is now level 9, killing things that conn red and I&#39;ve got<br/>
maybe a day of play time in it (1.5 realtime weeks.)  Being a drow probably<br/>
makes things a bit more difficult, I know there&#39;s an entrance to the sewers<br/>
outside the city, near the south gate along that large wall, but the exact<br/>
route to take to get to the guild escapes me (I only navigated this tunnel<br/>
once, and it&#39;s *long* and *twisty*)  I know I&#39;d be more than happy to help<br/>
out a fellow necro by getting spells etc, but that doesn&#39;t help much come<br/>
training time, and earning people&#39;s trust when it comes to 5-6pp for spells<br/>
takes a long time.<br/>
