<div id="ygrps-yiv-952356489">True, pretty simple system. :)  But I&#39;ve read in web discussions about<br/>
some sort of &quot;other&quot; system that the monster uses and when you con a monster<br/>
green, and thus your pet cons green, it&#39;s the same level or some sort of<br/>
stuff like that.  I don&#39;t know.  Which I don&#39;t mind, I think it makes sense.<br/>
But this is the kind of stuff they should&#39;ve put in an instruction booklet.<br/>
It makes it hard to know if our pet is really beneath our level, or if the<br/>
green con is truly our same level... as so many have got from their pets.<br/>
If anybody has any more info on this, it&#39;d be much more helpful. :-)<br/>

Consider your. Pet that all the info you need. Green lower then you. Blue...<br/>
1 level lower then you. Black same level as you. yellow 1 higher then you.<br/>
red... not like thats going to happen... 2 or more levels higher then you .<br/>
thats al there is to it!!! :)</div>
