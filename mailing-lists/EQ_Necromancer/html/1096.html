<div id="ygrps-yiv-1776595487">I have a couple questions about the island... I&#39;m almost 12 (on a new<br/>
server) and was thinking about checking it out.<br/>
<br/>
I know there are some high level sisters (red to my old char at 17)... do<br/>
you have to worry about them wandering by?   The one I know I saw was<br/>
standing out in the water a little ways from the island.<br/>
<br/>
Where is a good place to hunt on the island?  I&#39;ve never really been there<br/>
(seen it from the boat many times) and since I believe they will be agro to<br/>
my DE Necro (they are wood elves) I won&#39;t be able to really explore.<br/>
<br/>
Any other general advise/tips about the island?<br/>
<br/>
The darkness be with you,<br/>

&gt; I read your post the other day about being able to<br/>
&gt; handle Sister Isle from level 12+. Being level 12<br/>
&gt; myself I decided to try it last night. I&#39;m now<br/>
&gt; level 13 and having a blast. Thank you.<br/>
