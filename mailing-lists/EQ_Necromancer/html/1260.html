<div id="ygrps-yiv-364295347"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;i havent tried that, but it should work, because monks can kite with feign<br/>
&gt;&gt;death.  be sure you dont have autoattack on, however.  on a side note, i<br/>
&gt;&gt;know my experience may be different than others, but i have always found<br/>
&gt;&gt;feign death to be a worthless spell, as the creatures are never fooled by<br/>
&gt;&gt;it, and then i cant even run or cast(click walk, get up, turn around, and<br/>
&gt;&gt;creep away because you have 3hp left).  also, it has a rather high mana<br/>
&gt;cost<br/>
&gt;&gt;for a lower lvl caster.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>While Monks may be able to heal a bit faster than some using their Bind<br/>
skill.  It is not that fast of a healing method.  Not unless they can<br/>
bandage with bandages while they are lying dead too which I doubt.  At high<br/>
levels with Feign Death, Monks and Shadow Knights who also get the skill<br/>
become some of the best pullers in the game.<br/>
Feign Death also allows them not to die alot because they can feign death<br/>
if trained, or if they are on the loosing side of any battel.  I hear the<br/>
skill works fairly well at high levels.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;can anyone give me a guide for getting through rathe mountains from the lake <br/>
&gt;rathe side to the feerot side?  thanks<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am not sure of the most direct route.  I have seen a map of the zone<br/>
before so that may work best.  My only recomendation is that if your going<br/>
to follow a zone wall.  Make it the left zone wall instead of the right side.<br/>
Just watch out for the sphynx that is along this wall.  However, I believe<br/>
the one on this side is the good sphynx.<br/>
I went through this area a few times with Invis on.  Never had a problem.<br/>
Here is the link to the map.<br/>

Just click on the map you want.<br/>
