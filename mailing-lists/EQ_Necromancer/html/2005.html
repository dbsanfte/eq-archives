<div id="ygrps-yiv-2059538996">I highly recommend a SK for your tank character... and while not as powerful<br/>
as some others, It is the most fun to roleplay.  However, I do wish you<br/>
would consider the Troll race over the ogre... it is true that on paper, the<br/>
ogre is superior to the troll as an SK, but you do not play on paper.  The<br/>
troll is far superior to the ogre in any gameplay situation.  Get your<br/>
strength to 125-130 and then put the rest into int for 70-75... And regen is<br/>
often written off as impractical in the later game... I can not tell you the<br/>
number of times you will be jumped while killing frogz and Lizziez an tings,<br/>
and all dem ograys wid be ded, but da trolliez all lib cuz dey tougher dan<br/>
de ograyz.  An ebberbody noz dat onlee da trolliez iz da real shady<br/>
knights... ograys gud basherrz cuz dey no smart, lik marines.  Den da<br/>
trolliez can take wat da ded ograys wuz fightun.  An da dark elfiez is gud<br/>
tu!  Dey tough ifun you fry dem, but dey boil gud!  An ifun you grab dem on<br/>
da neck, dey mak gud clubz!  But no be dum ogray...</div>
