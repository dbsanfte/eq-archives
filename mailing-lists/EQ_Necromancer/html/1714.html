<div id="ygrps-yiv-1785209555">Rathe Mountains and kill Giant Skeletons!  they are soooo plentiful!!  All you have to do is have your pet kill the yardtrash (lizardmen and bears) and they will POP up all over.   Just be careful of Cyclopses and stay near Lake Rathe zone to run if ya have to.  Also don&#39;t be afraid to /YELL for help lots of people killing cyclopses will help if you need it.  I would prolly get a partner, it is so much more fun to group w/ 1 person than soloing.   Soloing is boring IMHO<br/>
