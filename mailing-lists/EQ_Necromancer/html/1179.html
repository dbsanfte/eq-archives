<div id="ygrps-yiv-864887765">I have noticed that there are currently 163 members on this list.  For this amount of people we should be seeing a lot more activity.  Lets try to keep this list going by helping each other out.  Even if you don&#39;t have a question, just let us know how things are going in game or let us know how your gaming has been going so far.  I think one way to do this is everyone should send in a mail with their characters info (Name, Level, Race, Server, etc.).  This would help the rest of us to see who all is on our individual servers and hopefully make friends to adventure with.  I guess I will start this off since it&#39;s my idea.<br/>
