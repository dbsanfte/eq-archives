<div id="ygrps-yiv-761127939"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; 	So if you can make a list of things that you are pissed off about<br/>
&gt; the Necromancer, I think we can discuss them and maybe understand each<br/>
&gt; other&#39;s position better.  PErsonally I think we&#39;re one of the best of the<br/>
&gt; lot.  Just about everyone I know has a MUCH harder time with just about<br/>
&gt; everything else (except druids, DAMN, what&#39;s up with these guys that allow<br/>
&gt; them to frikkin jump into the high end in like weeks?!?! That&#39;s what I want<br/>
&gt; to know!)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>   I would love to see other complaints about the class. The Necromancer<br/>
was designed from the start to be one of the only _truly_ soloable<br/>
classes. I believe the fact that wizards and druids can solo so well is a<br/>
game imbalance (this is not fact... pure opinion on my part!). But a<br/>
necromancer soloing _is_ supposed to be possible, right on up to lvl 50.<br/>
We get better pets overall than mages, we get a huge line of DoT spells,<br/>
we get the full line of darkness and anti-undead spells, and to round<br/>
things out we get some of the best utility spells (feign death, locate<br/>
corpse, etc). Our price, of course, is to be hated by everyone. Is this<br/>
such a problem though? We tend to solo, so we don&#39;t _need_ others. We are<br/>
almost totally self-sufficient. <br/>
   What all the muble-jumble amounts to is that I feel the necro is most<br/>
certainly _not_ neglected by Verant in any way. We were designed as a solo<br/>
class, and have spells that over time can nearly equal the destructive<br/>
force of a wizard without suffering some of their downfalls. Not to say<br/>
that we are in anyway overpowered... we have our share of hardships,<br/>
especially that level right before a spell circle when our pets are<br/>
worthless! But then, something has to hold us back :)<br/>
