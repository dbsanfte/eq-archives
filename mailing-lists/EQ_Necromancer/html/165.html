<div id="ygrps-yiv-1370182555">IT can get ouy out of some nasty situations sometimes, but mostly I<br/>
think its for PvP and at least a fighting chance to get away, especially in<br/>
a group.  Anything that gets the beast of you for a few seconds allows the<br/>
tanks to attempt to drag it back on them.<br/>
<br/>
	As for PvP, players respond much slower than mobs (probably because<br/>
they don&#39;t always know where you are all the time).  If you are duelling and<br/>
the nasty tank is in your face, you can cast this and usually get enough<br/>
time to cast another spell while he reorients, all the while getting beat on<br/>
by your pet.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt;     I&#39;ve a question about Shadow Step.  I know it&#39;s a mini <br/>
&gt; random teleport,<br/>
&gt; but.. I have some misgivings about it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I watched another mage, while invisible, casting their Shadow Step<br/>
&gt; outside.  It was sad, they hardly went a few feet away from <br/>
&gt; their original<br/>
&gt; spot, and if they were being attacked, they could still get hit by<br/>
&gt; whatever it was from where they went.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Though I guess, in a dungeon, it would be more helpful, or <br/>
&gt; is that just<br/>
&gt; wishful thinking?  Also, how long does it take to cast?  <br/>
&gt; Faster than Gate<br/>
&gt; does, or the same?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;     Thanks for the info folks.<br/>
