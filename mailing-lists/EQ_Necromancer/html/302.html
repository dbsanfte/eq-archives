<div id="ygrps-yiv-66379836">The problem with that is that there is an eliment of real life in the game. When you walk down the street does it tell you the strenth and power of the guy with you to back you up. No you need to get a feel for whats going on around you. Same with the game. You have to get a feal for it.... As you play more you start do that... and thats where real fun starts. If they gave us a # for every stat that every one wanted to see and emplamented in to the game it would be boring and dull and cumbersome. Also think of it as a chlange. The level befor a rank is all ways hard, but the first 2 levels when you hit a new rank are a breez.. I dont hear any one conplaining about that. every thing blances out.. <br/>

    Ok..  It was pointed out that Verant probably wouldn&#39;t go for a spell that gives out a numerical indication of a creature&#39;s power..  But this gave me another idea..  What if, when you cast you summon.. When the creature appears a text message pops up stating the equivalent of a /con but using the spell&#39;s level of power as a reference instead of your level..<br/>
    <br/>
        What I mean is.. Say you case a 4th level summon..<br/>
    You can get a critter that ranged from 3-5th level (AFAIK)..  That being the case.. A message that says.. The spell summons a weak/average/powerful elemental would work perfectly without giving anything away, and would be as useful as /conning it when you get the level, and continue to be useful when you get above the creature&#39;s level later on..<br/>
