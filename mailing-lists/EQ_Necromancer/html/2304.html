<div id="ygrps-yiv-1177022644">Hi Stuart,<br/>
<br/>
The best warrior class is kind of subjective. In DAoC even hybrids can make<br/>
good tanks. It also depends on your play style.  One thing that is really<br/>
cool is that tanks can spec in shields. This not only increases the tanks<br/>
chances to block, but also include shield styles. Its really cool to put<br/>
your block skill on a buddy that is close by and take shots for him, then<br/>
turn around and use a shield style that may stun or have some other effect<br/>
on the person/critter.<br/>
<br/>
I play a bard in Hibernia, but my buddy places a Firbolg Hero (a pretty good<br/>
tank) and he always puts guard, protect and block on me. Each of those<br/>
serves a purpose. Guard basically allows the Hero/warrior type to intercept<br/>
arrows that were meant for another player so long as the player being<br/>
guarded is close to the tank. Protect is VERY useful when placed on healers<br/>
since it basically transfers aggro to the tank. Block is as I stated above,<br/>
you use your shield to block shots for people.  Block and guard are REALLY<br/>
useful in RvR as well as PvE.<br/>
<br/>
One VERY important thing to know about warriors and tanks in DAoC. They are<br/>
not meant to be MEGA damage dealers, they are meant to absorb/block/parry<br/>
damage.  There are other classes that are REALLY good at laying the smack<br/>
down, but at the cost of giving up some defensive capability.  Beserkers,<br/>
Mercenaries and Blademasters are REALLY good at smacking the living tar out<br/>
of something, but they also will take more damage by default.  These classes<br/>
are also known as dual wielding classes. While other classes like the<br/>
Nightshade, Infiltrator, Shadowblade, Ranger and Scout get a form of dual<br/>
wield, they typically do not spec in it. The exception being the Shadowblade<br/>
(I LOVE this class after my bard)  Instead of getting dual wield,<br/>
Shadowblades get a skill called leftaxe or LA for short. Dual Wield (Albion)<br/>
and Celtic Dual (Hibernia) work differently than LA.  Dual wield has a<br/>
chance to trigger, when it does trigger and it does hit, it hits for max<br/>
damage. With LA, it swings EVERYTIME, when it hits it does a percentage of<br/>
the max damage. So while you swing all the time when you hit its partial<br/>
damage...which is still VERY good.  Its usually only a few points off of my<br/>
main weapon damage, because I keep it pretty high.  Midgard is the only<br/>
realm that gets LA. Shadowblades, and Beserkers get LA.<br/>
<br/>
So as you can see it depends on how you wish to play.  There are other tank<br/>
classes that you should also look at.  I really like the Midgard Thane. The<br/>
thane gets a nice AOE DD spell that smacks big ole hammers on thy enemies,<br/>
as well as a point blank AOE instant on a 20 second timer, a single DD<br/>
instant on a 20second timer, a castable DD and a STR/CON buff.  The weakside<br/>
is they are a bit light on the HP, but are a TON of fun to play.<br/>
<br/>
You may also want to checkout a Champion in Hibernia. I have a Lurikeen<br/>
large weapon champ and he is soooooo cool. He is similar to the thane yet<br/>
different. Instead of DD he gets some nasty debuffs and a nasty DD instant.<br/>
<br/>
Basically what you may want to do is to go to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://daoc.catacombs.com">http://daoc.catacombs.com</a> and<br/>
checkout the spell lists and style lists for the classes you wish to<br/>
checkout. They also have some decent class discussion forums there. I read<br/>
them quite often.<br/>
<br/>
I know this is a bit of a long winded E-mail, but there is a lot to know<br/>
about the various classes. I&#39;ve personally found something to like in every<br/>
class as well as something not to like.<br/>
<br/>
If you would like to know more about a certain class and specing please let<br/>
me know.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

&gt; Stuart,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I play DAoC. I quit EQ well over a year ago.  Personally, I REALLY like<br/>
it.<br/>
&gt; I will be honest and say that I&#39;m not really fond of the dungeons that<br/>
&gt; originally came with DAoC. They were weak at best. However, the new<br/>
dungeons<br/>
&gt; in the expansion are much better and much more EQ like. I always felt that<br/>
&gt; EQ&#39;s dungeons were fairly well designed and they only got better with the<br/>
&gt; expansions.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; With that said, the main attraction for me is the Realm vs. Realm combat.<br/>
&gt; Taking keeps and jacking relics is a total blast!  I have noticed that my<br/>
&gt; friends that have tried DAoC have started on what we call the &quot;Co-op&quot;<br/>
&gt; server. Basically, these are like EQ style servers and are PvE<br/>
only...pretty<br/>
&gt; boring if you ask me.  Give a regular server a chance and I think you will<br/>
&gt; like the way RvR is done. You won&#39;t have someone in your home town gank<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; or people from other realms raiding newbie areas. Its just not setup that<br/>
&gt; way.  If you play on a PvP server its a different story.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; RvR in my book is just awesome.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you have any questions please feel free to ask. I will be glad to help<br/>
&gt; you out as much as I can. DAoC isnt perfect by any stretch, but it really<br/>
&gt; suits me and my play style.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I stopped playing my necro at 30 a long time ago. Since then I have<br/>
&gt; leveled<br/>
&gt; &gt; up a Druid to 53 but wishing I had a high level group character, I am<br/>
&gt; &gt; working on one now a low level enchanter that may not even make it to 20<br/>
&gt; but<br/>
&gt; &gt; who knows<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; BTW, I am also looking forward to Star Wars Galaxies, looks like alot of<br/>
&gt; &gt; fun.<br/>
