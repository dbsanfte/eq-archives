<b>Subject:</b> Where to hunt at 21? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1483100798">Hello all.  After having spent two and a half weeks at 20 (is this a hell level or what?) I have finally made 21st level.  I made most the exp from 20 out in Oasis killing DW but the exp is getting a bit thin.  I was wondering if anyone can give me a good idea on where to solo w/pet at 21 and get good exp (yes, I would like to powerlevel to 24).  I know all the obvious spots like Treants and Aviak Tower in SK, but I am looking for someplace not so camped.  Any help would be appreciated.  Thanks in advance.<br/>
