<div id="ygrps-yiv-116298599">ive been going to najena (sp?) and picking off large and greater skeletons <br/>
(beware the trains and rushes).  if you can get a good party lavastorm is a <br/>
good place to kill fire drakes and dervishes, and even fire elementals if <br/>
you have some spell casters and&#92;or tanks with magic weapons.<br/>
<br/>
another good place is n ro, and using your detect undead spell.  since <br/>
lesser mummies and zombies are good to kill now that you have ward undead, i <br/>
have been focusing more on finding quality undead (i can sometimes take <br/>
yellow-red undead if i have a good pet).<br/>
<br/>
on a side note, does anyone think pets gain from exp?  personally, ive kept <br/>
a blue pet and had a good run of kills (a few young kodiaks, a halfling, <br/>
bunch of skels) and i noticed that he was hitting faster, and stunning <br/>
creatures.  i conned him, and low and behold he conned black!  maybe i was <br/>
on crack, but im going to try it again to verify it for myself.<br/>

&gt;Hello,<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m a DE Necro who is frustrated with the 9th level. I&#39;ve died and lost it <br/>
&gt;4<br/>
&gt;times now and can&#39;t seem to get above one bubble of exp before I lose it.<br/>
&gt;Hunting<br/>
&gt;in the forest seems to be worthless, only an occasional skeleton gives me <br/>
&gt;any<br/>
&gt;exp (or a kodiak if I can find one), the haflings eat me for lunch. I&#39;ve <br/>
&gt;been<br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;east commons a few times but I die as much as I make experience. Befallen<br/>
&gt;seems to be too hard (and I die) or too easy (and no exp). Am I doing<br/>
&gt;something wrong? Should I be hunting elsewhere? I&#39;ve about had it with my<br/>
&gt;necro character, I&#39;ve recently started a human mage in Freeport (eech) and<br/>
&gt;he&#39;s having a much easier time. I don&#39;t mind slow going but I like to see <br/>
&gt;some<br/>
&gt;character advancement.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Any suggestions? Any help? I&#39;m about to give up..<br/>
