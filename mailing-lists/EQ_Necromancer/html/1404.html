 </span></blockquote>Last night, I finished the quest for the Robe of Enshroudment (necro only<br/>
robe from the sol ro temple) It basically took me all weekend, I got the<br/>
werebat wing from Unrest first, by simply zoning in and auctioning that I&#39;d<br/>
pay 5p to loot it off someone&#39;s kill, got one in about 2 minutes (the<br/>
easiest component by far)  Next on my list was the globe of shadow, from the<br/>
Nokta shaman in upper guk.  This fellow spawns just past the Nok Shaman, by<br/>
the ancient croc and he is accompanied by 2 shin knights which were blue to<br/>
me at 35 and it took about 4 kills to get the globe.  The large shadow silk<br/>
was a pain in the butt, as shadow wolf pelts are a bit difficult to come by<br/>
quickly...what I did was zone into East Commons and shout &quot;20p for each<br/>
shadow wolf pelt brought to me&quot;  the newbies went nuts and I don&#39;t think<br/>
there was a wolf standing for more than 5 seconds.  Got my pelts in short<br/>
order.  Luckily our guild has a decent tailor so he made the shadow silk and<br/>
it was time to get the mask of shadow from the shadowed men.  I picked the<br/>
spawn in Nektulous, since it was close to the temple and I knew there<br/>
weren&#39;t any big beasties that would come interrupt me.  There were usually 4<br/>
of them at the spawn, they repop quickly and it took about 3 spawns before<br/>
one dropped what I needed.  In all, a relatively easy quest for a pretty<br/>
decent item (9AC, +4int, +4agi, +4 sv fire, +4 sv cold) and it looks very<br/>
cool, pure black...almost looks like your character is missing a texture. :)<br/>
I&#39;ve already had numerous comments on how good it looks.  That and it&#39;s nice<br/>
to not be one of the FBR/Oracle clones running around.<br/>
