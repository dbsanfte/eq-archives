<div id="ygrps-yiv-158242733">My wizard friend swears by the Everfrost zone. At<br/>
your level you will have moved up to the goblin<br/>
scouts and will soon be in the mammoth calf range<br/>
(with a large group). However, check your faction<br/>
with the barbarian guards. It would be impossible<br/>
to have any fun there if you are KOS.<br/>
<br/>
Other ideas would include BB and west Karana. In<br/>
BB you are up to gnoll level (say away from<br/>
patrolling, burly, guards, guardsmen, elites and<br/>
commanders ... but move up from left to right on<br/>
that list as you gain levels). By level 9, start<br/>
hitting the giant snakes. You and your pet should<br/>
just be able to solo one. These will take you to<br/>
level 12 or more. By that time, either group for<br/>
the bigger BB kills or move to Splitpaw in South<br/>
Karana. It&#39;s the same old gnoll thing but the<br/>
nobles have nice loot, as well as the gnoll<br/>
shamans. I found west Karana way too boring and if<br/>
you aren&#39;t a tailor ... what&#39;s the point of<br/>
killing the bears and lions? The loot stinks.<br/>
<br/>
You CAN make levels over there and keep hanging<br/>
with friends, but the post about going to Freeport<br/>
is correct. It&#39;s a little easier and there is a<br/>
better monster per person ratio there. Don&#39;t even<br/>
think of it until level 8 unless you&#39;ve made the<br/>
trip before, or you have a guide. At level 8 at<br/>
least you can use gather shadows and wander<br/>
somewhat in order to find the zone points. When<br/>
you reach 8th, make a post here I&#39;ll be glad to<br/>
give you directions for a trip across should you<br/>
want to do it.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck either way.<br/>

&gt; cant complain, I am beginning to reach the point<br/>
&gt; where the XP out there is low.  Does anyone have<br/>
&gt; any suggestions where a Human Necromancer can go<br/>
&gt; to level from 6-8, 8-12, 12-16, and 16-20?  I<br/>
&gt; know BB is a good source of XP and loot, but it<br/>
&gt; is usually crowded and there are trains which is<br/>
&gt; never good for a caster, especially in such a<br/>
&gt; small area (running room wise).  Are the Karanas<br/>
&gt; available at that level?  With where I placed<br/>
&gt; myself, am I stuck there till a later level?<br/>
&gt; How can we change our factions so, while the<br/>
&gt; guards can sneer at us and call us names, they<br/>
&gt; will leave us alone in other towns such as<br/>
&gt; Rivervale or Freeport or even Halas?  While I am<br/>
&gt; sure this is something that has been covered<br/>
&gt; time and again on this list and I apologize for<br/>
&gt; redundency, any info would be greatly<br/>
&gt; appreciated.  DalthorLevel 6<br/>
