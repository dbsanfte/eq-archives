<div id="ygrps-yiv-1063006891">for those that do not know, instead of having your pet sit, you can give the<br/>
command /pet stand up (even though he is allready standing).  This will keep him<br/>
from wandering off or &quot;guarding&quot; an area.<br/>
My problem with having a pet sit down is that they will not defend you if you<br/>
are attacked (especially nice when your meditating).  If he is standing, he will<br/>
defend you.  Just watch out though, if you fight somewhere and he comes running<br/>
to help, when the fight is over, you have to give the command &quot;/pet follow me&quot;<br/>
to get him back to your spot or he will continue to stand in the spot that the<br/>
last action took place.<br/>

 My favorate hunting tactic is to tell my pet to sit down<br/>
then I go out and &quot;tag&quot; a mob with engulfing darkness. I start running to my<br/>
pet about half way back i stop and cast heat blood then run to my pet<br/>
give the attack command and wait. When the mob finaly gets tehr it is down to<br/>
1/3 health.<br/>
