&gt; :)  This would be hard!  You should also have a bard in the group to play<br/>
mana song.<br/>
&gt; Also an enchanter to tashani, and stun if it isn&#39;t resisted.  You would<br/>
also have to<br/>
&gt; have plenty of FS daggers and a mage to summon his dagger since a pet<br/>
can&#39;t duel wield<br/>
&gt; two weapons of the same kind.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Actually, they capped the LT at about 5-6 levels above you. Since<br/>
Vox/Naggy<br/>
&gt; &gt; are &quot;Officially&quot; lv 53, a necro would have no problem sucking them dry.<br/>
In<br/>
&gt; &gt; fact, I have a theory about this.  Get 6 lv 50 Necro&#39;s with pets, and 6<br/>
lv<br/>
&gt; &gt; 50 clerics, and once the giants are taken care of, I think with the<br/>
clerics<br/>
&gt; &gt; healing the pets (I&#39;d give them some nice, cheap, fast weapons,<br/>
&gt; &gt; bloodclaw&#39;s.. etc) the dragons could be taken with only a few deaths.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; This list is basically unmoderated.  However abusive language will not<br/>
be tolerated<br/>
<br/>
That was actually done on Solusek Ro, it took only 6 Necro/Magicians.  A few<br/>
patches later, the Dragons summon pet owners. </span></blockquote></div>
