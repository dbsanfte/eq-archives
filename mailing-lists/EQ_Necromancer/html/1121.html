<div id="ygrps-yiv-1257874322">Anyone know a good spot to solo a lvl 37 necro? I was thinking of trying <br/>
spectres as they con blue to me usually, but I do not have JBoots, so I <br/>
pretty much have to kill or be killed. Was thinking I could do the root, <br/>
dot, root, dot, root, dot method with my pet bashing on them as well, but <br/>
haven&#39;t actually tried it to see how effective it is.<br/>

&gt;No clue about the Rathe mountains, but as for things to kill at level 26, <br/>
&gt;be<br/>
&gt;creative! or more importantly...be EVIL :) people kill darkelf guards all<br/>
&gt;the time...why not spread some of that love back to the good races, don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;stop with guards either, there are plenty of goodly npc&#39;s just waiting to <br/>
&gt;be<br/>
&gt;slaughtered for xp and loot. :)<br/>

&gt; &gt; Does anyone have the loc for Tib? I&#39;m level 26, and heard this wasn&#39;t <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt; best place to solo (unkempt druids), but the two treants and the aviak<br/>
&gt;city<br/>
&gt; &gt; are sooooo over camped on my server. Even at 4 in the morning when only<br/>
&gt;550<br/>
&gt; &gt; are on the server, at least 65 are in S. Karana. If anyone has better<br/>
&gt;ideas<br/>
&gt; &gt; of what to solo at this level, I&#39;d be very interested in hearing from <br/>
&gt;you.<br/>
&gt;I<br/>
&gt; &gt; really don&#39;t like the idea of wandering mobs sneaking up on me - but its<br/>
&gt; &gt; better than waiting 2 hours for a damn aviak....<br/>
