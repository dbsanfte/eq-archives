<div id="ygrps-yiv-1185279699">just follow the shore line at the first stop and you see the man and then up<br/>
to the left you&#39;ll see a stone and that is where the woman is, they aren&#39;t<br/>
linked either.  They can hit up to 100 pts per round (50 per punch), maybe<br/>
more if kick would max out too.  Usually they only hit you for 50 max<br/>
though.  If your on povar they are mine for a while :)<br/>

Cool Blue at 28th hmmm I think the 2 of us could take one of them.  He is<br/>
almost 18th and I am almost 21st.. .  maybe then we try.   Now these dwarves<br/>
are on the first stop from Freeport to BB right???<br/>
<br/>
And I just go right from the dock to find the dwarves?<br/>
