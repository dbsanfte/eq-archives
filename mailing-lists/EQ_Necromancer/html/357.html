<b>Subject:</b> Re: Level 4 and 8 spells <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-785394840">personally, i feel there are two reasons for becoming lvl 8, and that is <br/>
ward undead and bone walk.  there are a lot of other really food spells, but <br/>
those should be your first two (and ward is so cheap there really is no <br/>
excuse for not getting it soon).  imagine turning L8 and automatically being <br/>
able to do 38 damage to undead!  per casting!  bear in mind, tho, that this <br/>
is the necro&#39;s first evocation spell.  i camped out at a ruin in nektulos <br/>
and just casted it on everything that showed up, even if it wasnt my kill <br/>
(one hit wont steal the kill), just to cap out my evocation.  once you have <br/>
it capped you can easily take 2-3 skeletons with your pet, and ive even <br/>
easily solo&#39;d two skels w/o a pet, just from having that spell.<br/>
<br/>
another spell that i have found is under-used by our class is Dark Pact.  i <br/>
cannot go on about how useful this spell is.  ok- seems simple... it takes <br/>
your hp and gives you mana.  but now imagine this- you have just spent all <br/>
your mana, and are safe (and at full hp, or close).  so just find a safe <br/>
spot, cast Dk Pact, and hide/gather shadows-  you&#39;ll be back to full mana <br/>
faster than any other spell caster class.<br/>
how about this- you are in a group or hunting with your pet.  you are <br/>
fighting a pretty tough monster, if you cast this at the beginning of the <br/>
battle you will have extra mana to cast longer (im sure there are times we <br/>
all wished we had more mana- now you can).  be careful not to get too wild <br/>
with the dark empathy if you are in a group, and if you get poisoned, good <br/>
luck to you.  but nobody ever said death magic was easy =)<br/>

&gt;Right now, I am a level 5 Necromancer. I have bought Cavorting Bones(I <br/>
&gt;think that is the name of the level 4 pet spell), Clinging Darkness, and <br/>
&gt;Lifespike. Are tehre any other spells I should buy at this level. I am not <br/>
&gt;going to buy Gate until level 8, because I will not be travelling far until <br/>
&gt;level 8(when I get Gather Shadows). At level 8, what spells should I buy? <br/>
&gt;Right now, I am thinking Gather Shadows -&gt; Pet -&gt; Gate -&gt; Ward Undead. Are <br/>
&gt;there any other spells I should buy at this level? And should I change this <br/>
&gt;order?<br/>
