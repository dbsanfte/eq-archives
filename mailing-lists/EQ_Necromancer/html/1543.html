<div id="ygrps-yiv-392213463">Hi all, I am nearing lvl 16 and I was wondering if anyone could give me a<br/>
bit of info about research? i&#39;m collecting wors for the important spells<br/>
but am unsure how I have to train research, what skill are needed to<br/>
research what spells etc. I also have a great lightstone, which i believe I<br/>
use to get some concordonance book from a gypsy in south ro to train<br/>
research - is this coorect? Also will they deal with me, as i am a gnome<br/>
not a dark elf? ANy general and more specific info would be appreciated -<br/>
