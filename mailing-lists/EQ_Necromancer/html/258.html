<div id="ygrps-yiv-626922651">Lvl 9 is very annoying, the lvl 8 to 12 shot is the worst because you are<br/>
stuck with the lvl 4 hp sapping spell and others.  Even though vamp embrace<br/>
has been modified it still isn&#39;t all that great.  I would suggest you fight<br/>
in Nek forest or go to East Commonlands and fight the Lions and Young Kodis.<br/>
But stay near the zone and be careful for the griffins.  Let me know how it<br/>
goes.<br/>

I shall consume all that is living and live off of its energy.  Death is my<br/>
nothing but my follower.<br/>
