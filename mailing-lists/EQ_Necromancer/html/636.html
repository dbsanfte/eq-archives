<div id="ygrps-yiv-556843385">Hi All..<br/>
<br/>
A few days ago I read on one of the web servers about an &quot;invisible gnome<br/>
warrior guild.&quot; Basically one low level gnome warrior was struggling when a<br/>
higher level one came by and gave him some very good (for his level)<br/>
equipment. His parting words were to return the favor to another gnome when he<br/>
was able to, which he swore he would do.<br/>
<br/>
After reading some messages in this list a few days ago about travelling to<br/>
the Innothule Swamp and Grobb I thought I&#39;d take a wander down and see what it<br/>
was like down there. I traveled in shadow fearing the monsters I&#39;d encounter<br/>
on the way, little did I know a fellow Necromancer was in a zone along my<br/>
journey and happened to see me pass by. He inquired about my journey and<br/>
offered to lead me the rest of the way and bind me to Grobb which he did (my<br/>
first binding from home, yeah!) and even refused my offer of payment. If<br/>
hunger (in the real world) didn&#39;t pull me away from EverQuest I would have<br/>
taken him up on his offer for a tour of the zone.<br/>
<br/>
For someone who was twice threatened and harassed by characters &quot;roleplaying&quot;<br/>
I am happy to see other friendly characters out there looking out for others.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to propose the creation of an invisible necromancer guild.. I&#39;ll<br/>
certainly remember the kind actions of a fellow necromancer and hope to return<br/>
the favor some day to another necromancer in need. Our Guild isn&#39;t easy and<br/>
certainly those of the Dark Elf race have an even harder time. Sharing of<br/>
knowledge on forums like this one is a good thing and helpful to all,<br/>
hopefully kind actions is another thing we can start doing for each other.<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks go out to Manick @ Innoruuk for his help and assistance.<br/>
