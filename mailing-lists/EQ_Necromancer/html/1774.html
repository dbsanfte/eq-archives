<b>Subject:</b> in my opinion the best thing to kill 22-24 <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-248551664">I stumbled across a very very very good kill that is about lvl 20, and <br/>
drops up to 10plat a loot (i got 9plat 12gold 4silver 2copper as highest <br/>
loot).  This is a paladin in erudin, named Ton Nicelot.  his only faction <br/>
hits are with Erudite paladins and the high council of erudin, not even <br/>
guards.  He is a great kill and spawns once every 5-8 minutes, giving plenty <br/>
of time to med.  <br/>
    He spawns in the great library, at the top floor. You will not get <br/>
attacked by guards if they see you pulling him.  There is a way to exploit <br/>
him but id rather not say, seeing as if everyone does it the GMs will fix it. <br/>
    Suppossedly there are very few who know about this paladin, and seeing as <br/>
it is not well known, its not very camped.  I made 150plat at the average of <br/>
6plat a kill (sometimes you get 10 gold loot).<br/>
    Hopefully this will help everyone who does not know about this guy, and <br/>
maybe we all level up faster :0)<br/>
