<b>Subject:</b> Level 49 Pet Spell <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-347253319">Strange, but last night on the Innorruuk server I found the level 49 pet spell<br/>
in the Dark Elf Necro Guild.  It was in the top spot that the vendor sells, so I<br/>
don&#39;t think anyone sold it to them (why would they- its so rare!).  Did Verrant<br/>
start answering the Necro petition about making our pets more easily<br/>
available???<br/>

(and way too young for the 49th level pet spell)</div>
