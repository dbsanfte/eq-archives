 </span></blockquote>29th level pet.  I am desperately looking for the 24th pet spell now or word<br/>
of &gt;detchment, if anybody has them for sale on Innoruuk please tell me!  I&#39;m<br/>
only 21 so I have 3 levels before I need it.<br/>
<br/>
This would explain the constant requests for me to research that pet...I<br/>
wondered why, but I figured they had obtained the words already and figured<br/>
they could save a few plat.  Don&#39;t Shadowknights get that pet?  If they<br/>
do...it must be for sale *somewhere* they sure aren&#39;t going to research<br/>
it...</div>
