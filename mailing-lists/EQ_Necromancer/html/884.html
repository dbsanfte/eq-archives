<div id="ygrps-yiv-607923323">Someone asked what lvl you should be to &quot;research&quot; this spell.<br/>
<br/>
Well I successfully &quot;researched this spell whan I was L20&quot;  and I had only tried to make a spell 1 other time and when I failed the first time my skill went up to 18, then I tried the harmshield and it work!!! plus I have a 19 now, sweet!!!<br/>
