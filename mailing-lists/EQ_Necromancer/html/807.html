<div id="ygrps-yiv-463225849">I do have to disagree with this. I started out truly KOS with the high<br/>
elves. (Full Scowl ready to Attack.) However, after killing about 380 orcs<br/>
in crush bone (I kept a tally sheet) they now are down to Glares<br/>
Threateningly. Still not where I want it to be, but it&#39;s a start.<br/>
I didn&#39;t just stay there and kill orcs all in one straight shot. What I did<br/>
was stop off in CB when I hit 12, and killed 150 of them, then another<br/>
hundred at 14, and the rest at 16.<br/>
Just for reference sake, you get the same faction adjustment not matter if<br/>
you get credit for the kill, or even how much damage you do. (I verified<br/>
this with Dunnik on Veshaan.) So I walk around with my level one Life Tap<br/>
memorized in a spare slot, and just tap everything that people are fighting.<br/>
(I do an OOC first and occasionally explaining what I am doing, just so<br/>
folks don&#39;t think I am kill stealing.) This allows me to hit very high<br/>
numbers of faction very very quickly.<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

took me about 3 days of gnoll slaughtering to get my faction with merchants<br/>
down to indifferent, but it&#39;s well worth it to have a haven for<br/>
selling/buying on the western coast.  Be ever vigilant though, I was killed<br/>
in the bank by an npc erudite enchanter, basic rule of thumb, if it scowls<br/>
at you, it will *never* like you.  Threateningly however can be improved.<br/>
