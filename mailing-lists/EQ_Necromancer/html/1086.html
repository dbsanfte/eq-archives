<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1208824232">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I very recently changed servers and I just got to level 9 with my new DE<br/>
Necro.  It has been awhile since I was level 9 on my old server so what I<br/>
did to get through those horrible levels 10 and especially 11 is a little<br/>
hazy.  I know a lot of people say Skel Llrod; however, I do remember trying<br/>
to do that and remember him being camped, having lots of problems with my<br/>
pet, and getting attacked by 20 giant rats and skels every time I tried to<br/>
med.  So I have a couple questions:<br/>
<br/>
1) Any other suggestions for levels 10 and 11<br/>
2) Is there some trick to pets and medding in Befallen or do I need a REAL<br/>
tank<br/>
3) Are fire drakes in lava storm doable at 10 and 11 and more importantly<br/>
are they good exp?... I went to lavastorm for the first time when I was 12<br/>
and I remember all the drakes were blue to me then... Since they have a fire<br/>
attack I&#39;m not sure if my pet and I could hold up for long.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks everyone ,<br/>
Azerin<br/>
<br/>
P.S. I know these kind of posts come along all the time... maybe we should<br/>
make a Necro guide :)</div>
