&gt;Basically at skill 20 the only thing you&#39;ll really do is sharpen weapons<br/>

&gt;If you are a troll, dark elf, or ogre though, you&#39;ll either need a human<br/>
&gt;liaison or an illusion.  To have ANY reasonable chance at making banded<br/>
&gt;armor and better you&#39;ll be wanting a skill of at least 80.  The real<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;is raising the skill is so hit or miss.  Sometimes you can make three<br/>
&gt;skewers and gain 3 points in the smithing, and the next thing you know<br/>
&gt;you&#39;ve blown through 30 skewers and raised maybe a point.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  So what am I saying?  Have a huge bankroll ready, we&#39;re talking a good<br/>
&gt;60-100 platinum just to practice your way up to a decent level.  You can<br/>
&gt;still make banded armor at skill 20, but the success rate is so low you&#39;ll<br/>
&gt;have to charge way high to make any kind of turnover.  I know people that<br/>
&gt;refuse to make the tunics and leggings (hardest parts) at skill 90 because<br/>
&gt;the turnover is so poor.<br/>

&gt;fields which are quite useful, Specialization and Research.  Specialization<br/>
&gt;isn&#39;t implemented yet (whee) but basically you sink practice points into a<br/>
&gt;field (and it doesn&#39;t grow with practice) of magic and all spells in that<br/>
&gt;field become cheaper, more effective, etc etc.  Research is the big one.<br/>

&gt;spells).  After level 16 some spells become rare.  Sometimes you have to<br/>
&gt;travel to far off guilds to get the spells, sometimes they can&#39;t be found<br/>
&gt;anywhere on Norrath.  So you need to develop Research so you can MAKE the<br/>
&gt;spells you are missing.  From what I&#39;ve heard this is a total pain in the<br/>
&gt;ass, but hey, you need your spells right?  Basically you first sink some<br/>
&gt;points into many different languages (this is another pain), one mainly<br/>

&gt;I would say keep saving those spell points.  The only real thing you can do<br/>
&gt;is tailoring and that isn&#39;t terribly lucrative, especially since the step<br/>
&gt;after patchwork armor is massive and almost as painful as smithing (nobody<br/>

&gt;loads of money and time before you can even set foot down the journey.  I<br/>

&gt;I am at level 8 and I am about to dump 20 skill points into a trad. I<br/>
&gt;thought I was going to be a black smithing for sure, but now I am not<br/>
&gt;sure.<br/>
&gt;There might be good money there but the trad wont benifit me much. Also<br/>
&gt;not<br/>
&gt;to mention I dont have very high strenth, but then agian what is there<br/>
&gt;out<br/>
&gt;there that would be good for a necro? Or is my negitiveity of the black<br/>
&gt;smith trad missplaced. Pleas someone give me some tips. If you are a<br/>
&gt;necro<br/>
&gt;and a black smith I would really love to hear how its going for you, or<br/>
&gt;if<br/>
&gt;any of you are in another trad and its doing you good pleas tell me.<br/>
