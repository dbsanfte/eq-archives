<div id="ygrps-yiv-1180099188">What is the web address for  &quot;The Necromonitor&quot;<br/>
Can any higher up tell us what we should start looking for as far as spells<br/>
go?<br/>
I am worried that life will be very hard when I get higher lvl and need<br/>
certain spells but can&#39;t find them or learn how to make them.<br/>

&gt; I bought both of those in Neriak...pretty certain that Freeport will have<br/>
&gt; what you need though, they seem to carry at least up to 16th lvl, and<br/>
&gt; probably quite a few past that, though not all.  On a related note...does<br/>
&gt; anyone have an up to date list of spell components needed for necro<br/>
&gt; research?  The necromonitor has an older one, but it&#39;s very incomplete.<br/>
&gt; Learning languages is not my way of having fun, not to mention I solo<br/>
almost<br/>
&gt; exclusively so my opportunities to get spammed by gibberish are pretty few<br/>
&gt; and far between.<br/>
