<div id="ygrps-yiv-573137406">Well at level 9, I would recommend the skeletons in Ak Anon. I made all the<br/>
way up to level 12 there. Level nine is still a newbie groundish level.<br/>
Maybe CB. I also made a couple levels there fighting primarily the slavers<br/>
and taskmaster. I would recommend when summoning a pet. What you look for is<br/>
what it cons to you. If it cons blue but risky. It is fairly good. blue but<br/>
upper hand, is less then the risky. You will notice differences in the<br/>
con&#39;ing of your pet. I would recommend using those differences and finding<br/>
out which pet is stronger. That is the key to success as you near the next<br/>
rank. You want to fight iwth your most powerful pet so that youd on&#39;t have a<br/>
problem.<br/>

&gt; Hello,<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m a DE Necro who is frustrated with the 9th level. I&#39;ve died and lost it<br/>
4<br/>
&gt; times now and can&#39;t seem to get above one bubble of exp before I lose it.<br/>
&gt; Hunting<br/>
&gt; in the forest seems to be worthless, only an occasional skeleton gives me<br/>
any<br/>
&gt; exp (or a kodiak if I can find one), the haflings eat me for lunch. I&#39;ve<br/>
been<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; east commons a few times but I die as much as I make experience. Befallen<br/>
&gt; seems to be too hard (and I die) or too easy (and no exp). Am I doing<br/>
&gt; something wrong? Should I be hunting elsewhere? I&#39;ve about had it with my<br/>
&gt; necro character, I&#39;ve recently started a human mage in Freeport (eech) and<br/>
&gt; he&#39;s having a much easier time. I don&#39;t mind slow going but I like to see<br/>
some<br/>
&gt; character advancement.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Any suggestions? Any help? I&#39;m about to give up..<br/>
