<b>Subject:</b> Re: Vendor selling necro spells in wkarana <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-189551320"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I was speakign to a lvl 50 necro on my server anad apparently it is<br/>
&gt; possible to buy harmshield on a female barbarian near qhills, by the water<br/>
&gt; or somewhere aroudn there in wkarana. I was wondering if anyone could<br/>
&gt; confirm/try this. Maybe she also has soem other spells, hopefully the lvl<br/>
&gt; 24 pet one, which seems to have dissappeared everywhere. I though sk&#39;s got<br/>
&gt; the lvl 24 pet spell in which case it must be buyable somewhere, if anyone<br/>
&gt; knows please could you tell me. Thanks in advance, malados<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I had heard the SK&#39;s got the 29 pet instead now, which is why the 29 pet is<br/>
now sold in Grobb, instead of the 24...can anyone confirm this?</div>
