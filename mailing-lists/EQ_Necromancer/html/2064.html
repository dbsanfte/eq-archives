<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-141632188">I have raised a dark elf necro up to level 18 and am visiting High Pass. The &quot;volunteer&quot; just inside the gate past the orc camp still scowls at me ready to attack. How many orcs must I annihilate before they view me a little more friendly in there? Is there some kind of shortcut to better faction here?<br/>
<br/>
I have spent the bulk of my time in North Ro, Oasis, Befallen, Lavastorm and of course the dark wood outside Neriak. <br/>
<br/>
Any help on improving my faction would be appreciated!<br/>

Wyrmy, 18 lvl DE Necro, Bristlebane</div>
