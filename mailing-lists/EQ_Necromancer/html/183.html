<div id="ygrps-yiv-1112058368">For those of you who, for some odd reason or another, haven&#39;t logged in<br/>
after last night&#39;s patch (May 04th), Vampiric Embrace has been &quot;modified&quot;,<br/>
finally.  If you haven&#39;t got the patch yet, you&#39;ll get a new EverQuest<br/>
Executuable and one other file.. and possibly the new manual.<br/>
<br/>
  When you get the next update, which will be tonight, the changes to the<br/>
Vampiric Embrace will be listed in the manual*.* file.  All I know at this<br/>
point is it says:<br/>
<br/>
===<br/>
        &quot;9) Vampiric Embrace has been modified from it&#39;s original design to<br/>
improve game play.<br/>
<br/>
            ...<br/>
<br/>
        Tomorrow night, a revised version of the EverQuest Manual will be<br/>
patched.  The revision will include a new section which outlines the spells<br/>
and skills that have been modified from their original design to enhance<br/>
game play.&quot;<br/>
===<br/>
<br/>
    That&#39;s 9 of 10 things fixed/changed.  Anyhoo, thought I&#39;d give you folks<br/>
a note about it.  Time for me to go play. :-)<br/>

  Hoping the change has been worth it.</div>
