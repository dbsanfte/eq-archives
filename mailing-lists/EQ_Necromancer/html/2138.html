<div id="ygrps-yiv-1748624686">Well I have lots and lots of questions after my first Planes trip last night, <br/>
but before I bother asking things answered 150 times is there any good links <br/>
or places with information I can go read... again.<br/>
<br/>
I have read lots of stuff over the last year but now having been there I have <br/>
a different set of eyes with which to read with again.<br/>
<br/>
I will say this much it was very anticlimatic for me. It was Hate and I am <br/>
going to get stuff for my enchanter and cleric perma partners and as always <br/>
will go to the ends of the earth for them, but after 47 levels to get there I <br/>
just had the feeling the entire time of &quot;wow all that for this?&quot; It was a <br/>
Highpass for high levels, pull and FFA, pull and FFA.<br/>
<br/>
Is Fear like this too? Any guides out there you can point me to would be <br/>
appreciated so I can go read again now having been there.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
I apologize if you get this multiple times as I am sending it to the 4 class <br/>
list servs I am on.</div>
