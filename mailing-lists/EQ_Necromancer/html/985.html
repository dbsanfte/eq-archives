&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am almost 16 (should get it tonight) and I have spent most of my last few<br/>
&gt;levels in Oasis and South Ro... with some time spent in Lavastorm.  While I<br/>
&gt;know I can continue hunting crocs and stuff in Oasis it is getting really<br/>
&gt;boring.  Anyone have suggestions on where to go hunt?  I am primarily<br/>
&gt;interested in exp... there are a couple of people I am trying to catch up<br/>
&gt;to.  Thank you in advance.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well you have done the same as me. I hunted in so ro till level 15. Then I<br/>
was dieing for something new. Well I found it. Lake rath. Its near the ogre<br/>
home land. You hunt Aviak Guards. Look for the island that has a cave to a<br/>
zone called the arina. Just out side the cave is 2 towers with solo Aviak<br/>
guards on them. You pull one down with a big dot and fight inside the cave.<br/>
If you run into trouble you zone to the arina. Its allot of fun and you make<br/>
some good cash as well. Then just go left out side of the cave to the next<br/>
island and at night there is undead spawns. You get rts and skulls and gold<br/>
stud earrings off the gnoll embalmers, high shaman&#39;s. Look out this place<br/>
gets really hard but the loot is wicked.<br/>
<br/>
P.S. You will need gather shadows for this trip.<br/>
