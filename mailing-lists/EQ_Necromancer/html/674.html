&gt; i would really just like to be able to have spells ready in case of<br/>
&gt; emergencies, without hurting my ordinary ability to dish out damage.  for<br/>
&gt; example, i almost always have ward undead, even if there are only a few<br/>
&gt; undead around.  resting after a battle and getting attack by a zombie is<br/>
no<br/>
&gt; fun, even though they are rather weak opponents.  even a high level,<br/>
&gt; ordinary skeleton can do some damage if you dont have a pet and/or ward.<br/>
&gt; just for comparison, i got trained by 3 skels, without a pet, and i was<br/>
able<br/>
&gt; to kill them all.  by the time i finished i was severly low on hp, and<br/>
just<br/>
&gt; about out of mana (enough for gather shadows).  if i wouldnt have had<br/>
ward,<br/>
&gt; i would have been dark elf pot pie.<br/>
&gt; i also like to keep either gather shadows or gate on hand, but it would be<br/>
&gt; nice to have access to both.  also, i almost always use dark pact, and the<br/>
&gt; extra mana has saved my buns many a time.  it would just be nice to have<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; ability to use a good portion of the spells i have, instead of needing to<br/>
&gt; choose a small handful.  im sure any spellcaster can agree with that, but<br/>
&gt; since we are already limited in our ability to take damage, i think the<br/>
&gt; versatility would help, even if it doesnt really make us all that much<br/>
more<br/>
&gt; powerful.<br/>

My personal thought on this is for the number of slots for spells to<br/>
increase based on level. This would reflect the characters increase in<br/>
knowledge and ability to retain spells. And give adequate explination for<br/>
why lower lvls don&#39;t have as many slots. Though i&#39;m sure verant made limited<br/>
slots for balancing purposes. If magic-users had access to all their spells<br/>
or the greater majority of them at all the time magic users would be<br/>
significantly more powerful than most character classes. It makes you think<br/>
about what you should cast and prepare accordingly. It does get tedious<br/>
though, to constantly sit and mem spells as they wear off.<br/>
