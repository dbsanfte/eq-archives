<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1106692229">Please if anyone can help me, I am VERY desperate.  I have accidentally<br/>
messed up my factions with Dark Bargainers so that they are apprehensive.  I<br/>
don&#39;t know how this happened, but I went from amiable to apprehensive<br/>
without even being indifferent!!!  But anyway, is there ANY way to get<br/>
factions higher with Dark Bargainers that anybody can think of?  I tried<br/>
Wine quest...  won&#39;t give it to ya unless you are indiff or better.  I tried<br/>
slaves in Crushbone...  the woodelf slaves gave me good factions towards<br/>
Indigo Brotherhood, but none to Dark Bargainers.  Tried the GLS and LS quest<br/>
in South Ro to Smith Tv&#39;ysa but she wouldn&#39;t take them or talk to me<br/>
either...  must have to be indiff here as well.  So I finally got a lvl 50<br/>
druid (39 - 50 can do this) cast wolf form on me in S. Ro and this made no<br/>
difference.  She still hated me!  So is there any quests anyone can think of<br/>
that would possibly help me here?  I am really getting desperate and have<br/>
spent hours trying these other things.  Thanks a lot!!!<br/>
 <br/>
Really paying for this stupid mistake!!!<br/>
