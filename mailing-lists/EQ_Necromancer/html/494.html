<div id="ygrps-yiv-1249992813">Has anyone given any swords or anything to your pets?   I was thinking about trying to save up for a Mino Axe if you can get the axe back after your skel is killed.   Otherwise I don&#39;t think I will use weapons.  Or is it more damage??<br/>
<br/>
Any info on weapons for your pets would be GREAT! Thanks!<br/>
