<div id="ygrps-yiv-1748471480">you need a book of dark bindings for a necro.  i believe the books for those <br/>
quests are for wizards and mages (or enchanters), not necros.<br/>
<br/>
a few things ive learned about research-<br/>
<br/>
1. you will very rarely succeed at creating a spell for a group you have <br/>
just obtained (i havent since 16, anyway).<br/>
2. words are a pain in the butt to aquire, so always be on the lookout for <br/>
words you need or will want in the future. even if you have one already, get <br/>
more in case of failure- dont be cheap, you are saving lots for plat by not <br/>
buying the spell in a store (altho the agravation more than makes up for it)<br/>
3. if you are like me, and never use your training points, you should have <br/>
enough to max out research for your level!  always do this before you <br/>
attempt a new spell. (the only other thing ive spent training on is <br/>
specialize)<br/>
<br/>
thats about all the wisdom i can think of for now<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hi all, I am nearing lvl 16 and I was wondering if anyone could give me a<br/>
&gt;bit of info about research? i&#39;m collecting wors for the important spells<br/>
&gt;but am unsure how I have to train research, what skill are needed to<br/>
&gt;research what spells etc. I also have a great lightstone, which i believe I<br/>
&gt;use to get some concordonance book from a gypsy in south ro to train<br/>
&gt;research - is this coorect? Also will they deal with me, as i am a gnome<br/>
&gt;not a dark elf? ANy general and more specific info would be appreciated -<br/>
&gt;Malados lvl 15 gnoem necro on solusek ro server<br/>
