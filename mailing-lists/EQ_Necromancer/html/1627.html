<div id="ygrps-yiv-729922732">I spent a lot of time between lvl 30 and 31 getting all my quest items<br/>
(except for book which I never have seen).∩┐╜ 2 or 3 of us could usually hold<br/>
a spawn which consisted of 2 nec&#39;s, me 30/31 and 32 level nec, and possibly<br/>
1 level 30 enc.∩┐╜ If there were cleric shadowmen that usually spelled<br/>
trouble.<br/>
∩┐╜<br/>
All items disappear on logout that you get from shadowmen, so you want them<br/>
to be the last thing you go for except for the scythe and the book, which<br/>
you can turn in to get notes stating that you have already turned them in.<br/>
∩┐╜<br/>
I did have 1 scare as far as going link dead, knowing that the items<br/>
disappear on logout.∩┐╜ I had finally gotten the last item from the shadowmen,<br/>
I believe it was the mask.∩┐╜ It took many nights of camping until I was<br/>
finally able to loot this item and∩┐╜just as I was heading to the temple from<br/>
nektulos, I went LD.∩┐╜ Luckily the item was maintained and I got my quest<br/>
item :)<br/>

What level should I be before trying this quest?∩┐╜ Also, do any of the items<br/>
disappear when I log out?<br/>

Last night, I finished the quest for the Robe of Enshroudment (necro only<br/>
robe from the sol ro temple) It basically took me all weekend, I got the<br/>
werebat wing from Unrest first, by simply zoning in and auctioning that I&#39;d<br/>
pay 5p to loot it off someone&#39;s kill, got one in about 2 minutes (the<br/>
easiest component by far)∩┐╜ Next on my list was the globe of shadow, from the<br/>
Nokta shaman in upper guk.∩┐╜ This fellow spawns just past the Nok Shaman, by<br/>
the ancient croc and he is accompanied by 2 shin knights which were blue to<br/>
me at 35 and it took about 4 kills to get the globe.∩┐╜ The large shadow silk<br/>
was a pain in the butt, as shadow wolf pelts are a bit difficult to come by<br/>
quickly...what I did was zone into East Commons and shout &quot;20p for each<br/>
shadow wolf pelt brought to me&quot;∩┐╜ the newbies went nuts and I don&#39;t think<br/>
there was a wolf standing for more than 5 seconds.∩┐╜ Got my pelts in short<br/>
order.∩┐╜ Luckily our guild has a decent tailor so he made the shadow silk and<br/>
it was time to get the mask of shadow from the shadowed men.∩┐╜ I picked the<br/>
spawn in Nektulous, since it was close to the temple and I knew there<br/>
weren&#39;t any big beasties that would come interrupt me.∩┐╜ There were usually 4<br/>
of them at the spawn, they repop quickly and it took about 3 spawns before<br/>
one dropped what I needed.∩┐╜ In all, a relatively easy quest for a pretty<br/>
decent item (9AC, +4int, +4agi, +4 sv fire, +4 sv cold) and it looks very<br/>
cool, pure black...almost looks like your character is missing a texture. :)<br/>
I&#39;ve already had numerous comments on how good it looks.∩┐╜ That and it&#39;s nice<br/>
to not be one of the FBR/Oracle clones running around.<br/>
