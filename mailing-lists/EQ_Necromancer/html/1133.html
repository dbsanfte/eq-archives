<div id="ygrps-yiv-1025034946">I took alteration as my main specialization, that way lifetap type spells<br/>
are quicker to cast and not as easy to interrupt...it&#39;s saved my butt on<br/>
several occasions.  My other choice would be conjuration, as pets and the<br/>
darkness line would cast faster and take less mana, but those aren&#39;t as<br/>
emergency related, so I went with alter.<br/>
