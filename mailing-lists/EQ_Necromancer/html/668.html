Maybe its just sort of tactic to make our life harder :)<br/>
I have the same problem with my shaman and hell he has a lot of spells he needs.<br/>
If i want to buff one fully up i need to remem all spells because of its numbers.<br/>
After that when combat comes in i need to remem all my combat spells (poison, disease,<br/>
dd, debuff, heal, ...) thats pain ! :)<br/>
oh well i should stop rambling<br/>
<br/>
bye</div>
