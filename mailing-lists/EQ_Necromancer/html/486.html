<b>Subject:</b> any human necromancers out there? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1254373374">Can anyone give some recommendations about  where to go on 10th lvl, as a<br/>
human necro in qeynos? <br/>
For the last 3 levels i&#39;ve been in west karana, and i&#39;m looking for better<br/>
places to hunt, as the xp and the loot i get in karana<br/>
from the creatures i can handle there ( mostly giant spiders, giant<br/>
beetles,lions , the occasional grizzly ) , is quite bad.<br/>
From the times i&#39;ve been to black burrow, it looks that place is just<br/>
impossible, because of all of the people that hang around there all of the<br/>
time, pulling train after train..<br/>
Is there any undead hunting site near qeynos, besides the ruins in the<br/>
hills? I realy want to put my ward-undead to use..<br/>
<br/>
death to all,<br/>

If we aren&#39;t supposed to eat animals , why are they made of meat?</div>
