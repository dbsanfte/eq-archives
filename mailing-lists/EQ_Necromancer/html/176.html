<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1656039075">Shadow step is rather quick to cast(way less than an attack round), costs<br/>
little mana, and teleports you a random distance and direction from where you<br/>
are. The teleport is line of sight, so you wont go into or through a wall.<br/>
Sometimes it teleports 1 foot, sometimes 30, its a rather random spell, and<br/>
better than nothing when a monster is raping you. It is best to use in<br/>
conjunction with gate: Cast shadow step to get a bit away from enemy and<br/>
immediately start gate and it should get off before enemy can run you over :)<br/>
<br/>

    I&#39;ve a question about Shadow Step.  I know it&#39;s a mini random teleport,<br/>
but.. I have some misgivings about it.<br/>
<br/>
  I watched another mage, while invisible, casting their Shadow Step<br/>
outside.  It was sad, they hardly went a few feet away from their original<br/>
spot, and if they were being attacked, they could still get hit by<br/>
whatever it was from where they went.<br/>
<br/>
  Though I guess, in a dungeon, it would be more helpful, or is that just<br/>
wishful thinking?  Also, how long does it take to cast?  Faster than Gate<br/>
does, or the same?<br/>
<br/>
    Thanks for the info folks.<br/>
