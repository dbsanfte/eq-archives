<div id="ygrps-yiv-1530554483">Hello.<br/>
<br/>
I am eloric Necromancer of the 2nd Rank. When I obtain the 3rd Rank I am<br/>
planning to venture out from my homeland. However, Being a worshipper of<br/>
Innoruke (sp) and being a dark elf and a necromancer give me large negative<br/>
standing with most peoples of the world.<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone tell me if this is possible to overcome and to what degree? IE.<br/>
Can I complete overcome this by killing things and getting the faction<br/>
adjustments or is there a cap. For example will I always be hated by the<br/>
north freeport paladins even if I kill 100s of corrupt guards?<br/>
<br/>
Has any fellow dark elf necromancers had any success with raising their<br/>
faction to an acceptable level outside of home? If so which groups?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the help.<br/>
