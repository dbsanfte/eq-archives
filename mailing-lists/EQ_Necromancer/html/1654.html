<b>Subject:</b> Question About Qeynos Necro Guild <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1791079050">I&#39;m a DE Necro of 13 lvl and have been hangin around the Qeynos area a lot<br/>
lately because of group participation.  When I first got to Qeynos, I was<br/>
able to buy and sell in the Necro guild in the catacombs.  This was at level<br/>
12 or so.  I also started killing LOTS of gnolls in BB so I could hopefully<br/>
get into Qeynos someday.  Well, I finally made it into Qeynos killing<br/>
gnolls, and also lvled to 13.  However, now it seems I can&#39;t buy or sell in<br/>
the necro guild anymore!  I&#39;m not KOS, but everyone down there says how bad<br/>
I am.  First, what did I do to make this happen?  I never killed anything<br/>
that gave me bad factions against the Blood Sabers.  Second, how do I<br/>
reverse it?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a lot!  Appreciate any help I can get!<br/>
