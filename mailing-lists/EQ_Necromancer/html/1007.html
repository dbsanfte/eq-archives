Subject: Re: Re: 16th Pet and 20pet<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;The level 16th pet and 20pet are found in the Grobb Shadow Knight guild. As<br/>
&gt;for hunting grounds I would suggest sticking to Oasis until 20 or at 18 or so<br/>
&gt;you could move to Lake Rathe and hunt the undead at night and gnolls in the<br/>
&gt;day.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I thought killing the undead at Lake Rathe would cause some horrible faction<br/>
change and get you banished from the guild or something? I&#39;m a Dark Elf, maybe<br/>
it only applies to DE&#39;s? Can someone confirm or debunk this? Thanks.<br/>
