 </span></blockquote>it&#39;s much faster than gate and I&#39;ve had gate fizzle a lot. Shadow Step is<br/>
pretty quick, pretty cheap and basically just gets you out of the way to run<br/>
or cast Gate (though keeping both memorized is a big price). I&#39;ve only used it<br/>
outdoors, no idea about what it would do in a dungeon, but if it could put you<br/>
on the other side of a wall from a mob that would be great.<br/>
