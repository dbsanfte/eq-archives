  Cory.<br><br>On a side note.&nbsp; I started Alazzar because I got discouraged 
  with my level<br>23 bard.&nbsp; I just got tired of dieing all the 
  time.<br><br>Well last night I made 2 1/2 bubbles of xp in 2 1/2 hours.&nbsp; 
  My bard never<br>did this in his life.&nbsp; I was amazed at how quickly my 
  pet and I were mowing<br>thru mobs with no downtime at all.&nbsp; I am looking 
  forward to playing Alazzar,<br>I&#39;m just going to have to get used to the 
  faction thing.&nbsp; I haven&#39;t had to<br>deal with it yet.<br><br>Good
