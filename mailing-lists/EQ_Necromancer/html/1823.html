<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1080464397">as a necro I never failed at one spell ever I guess I was lucky I dunno how <br/>
it rolls it.  at level 1 I put one point and then I was able to research <br/>
banshee aura a coupla times and get a few skill point not many then I sortsa <br/>
just forgot about research up till about level 24 because then you start to <br/>
get research spells worth researchin hehe i dumped all my points into <br/>
research untill I couldnt dump more in....( i had saved every single <br/>
experience point from level 1) so it was maxxed and didnt fail on any <br/>
research from taht point on.<br/>
