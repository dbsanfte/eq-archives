<b>Subject:</b> How viable is our class past lev 30? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1325902088">Hello.<br/>
<br/>
I am a very novice Rank 2 Necromancer and am trying to determine what the<br/>
future holds for my decision to be one.<br/>
<br/>
I have recently read some web posts claiming that the Necromancer is not a<br/>
viable class after level 30. It had the following to say about the<br/>
Necromancer.<br/>
<br/>
1. The pet gets chewed up way to fast to solo at all past 30.<br/>
2. The DOT&#39;s that in theory are awesome to stack will only result in the MOB<br/>
frenzied on you and your death if you try to use those spell combinations in<br/>
a group.<br/>
3. Even if you COULD get in your DOT&#39;s the MOBS are killed so fast by the<br/>
Wizard types that they don&#39;t take full effect.<br/>
<br/>
Can some Lev 30(+) necromancers give me some feedback on how they feel about<br/>
this class at the upper levels? I sure hope the game isn&#39;t such that<br/>
everyone is going to wish they were a wizard or druid at high levels. I had<br/>
heard the Necromancer was possibly the most powerful high level class in the<br/>
game and that this extra power was offset by being KOS in so much of<br/>
Norrath? But based on many posts I have read I&#39;m being to wonder if all the<br/>
social penalties are worth it if the class is not even in the top half of<br/>
power at the higher levels.<br/>
<br/>
Your thoughts are welcome.<br/>
