<div id="ygrps-yiv-367324407">Actually, the only problem I had in Freeport was the northern sectors, those<br/>
pesky paladins didn&#39;t care for me too much, unfortunately that&#39;s where the<br/>
bank is as well, and there isn&#39;t a blackburrow type area in which to quickly<br/>
raise faction..slaying orc pawns in the newbie zone isn&#39;t my idea of a good<br/>
time :)<br/>

Actually Dark Elves aren&#39;t hated near as much on the Qeynos side of the<br/>
continent. Not to mention Dark Elf Necros can go into East Freeport without<br/>
being attacked.<br/>
