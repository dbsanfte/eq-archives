<div id="ygrps-yiv-778901393">I&#39;ve been stuck at level 10 for a week now! Its not as bad as the hellish level 7 (I was there for 16 days) but it is still bad! I tried Lrodd.... I am NOT doing that again. I beat him ONE TIME out of the several times I fought him, and for that one time I lost a pet with a twohanded sword, had no mana, and was at less than a bar of health. For all this, I got SO LITTLE XP THE BAR DIDN&quot;T CHANGE! And this was solo without a pet! The other times Lrodd just kicked my ass.  I&#39;ve tried WC but Kodies jump me and kill me while I fight YKs. I&#39;ve tried Kithicor, but the Ghouls jump me and kill me. I&#39;ve tried Nro and the xp is sooo bad there. Guk is a joke. Either too hard or too easy. Innothule is worse, its ALL green there. The orc camps are worthless. I can&#39;t find a group to hunt with, so the Dervishes are out.  EC I tried (again) and while fighting a lion a Cent jumped me. I ran past 4 people macroing &quot;HELP ME!! HELP ME!!&quot; and they did nothing. The cent got me. I went back out, fought a blue lion, and an even one came up and attacked my pet. I gated away and logged, utterly frustrated at having lost a bar and a half of xp in two days. If I keep up like this, I am going to be level 9 AGAIN. Please, someone help me! Where can I hunt solo w/pet at level 10?!<br/>
