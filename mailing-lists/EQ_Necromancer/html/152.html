<div id="ygrps-yiv-1873374103">Re: Anyone know what language a lot of those books that have spell recipies <br/>
are in? Is it High Erudian? Anyone know of any monsters that give words and <br/>
so forth??<br/>
<br/>
The books are all different languages.  Each one a different one.  So ... you <br/>
will need to learn them all.  There seem to be Old Erudian, Ancient Elvish, <br/>
Elder Tir&#39;Dal.  There is also Lizardman and Gnoll.  I have 4 books, and it <br/>
looks like each is a different language.  I believe that my first one is <br/>
Ancient Eleven ... only because I am average in this skill, and I can almost <br/>
make it out.  (I am A Dark Elf Necro)<br/>
<br/>
And I have found words/runes on Orc, Fungi Men, Frogloks, and Goblins.  They <br/>
tend to be on the &quot;intelligent&quot; critters.  Randomly.</div>
