<div id="ygrps-yiv-695319564">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
Does anybody know if there is a way for you to take back a weapon you give<br/>
to your pet to wield? after i give some weapon to my pet, i cant take it<br/>
back when i want to zone, so the weapon gets lost.<br/>
Does anyone else think that the current system where when your pet dies all<br/>
of the stuff you gave it just vanish, is not too good? For me at least, it<br/>
causes not to hand out expensive weapons to my pet, because i know i will<br/>
not be able to get it back, so i prefer to sell it in the shop, and but<br/>
something less expensive as a &quot;disposable&quot; weapon.<br/>
Opinions?<br/>
