<div id="ygrps-yiv-1546782866">A new strategy I started using at about level 20, where engaging a mob in<br/>
melee means taking hits for one bubble of hp at a time, (translation: don&#39;t<br/>
do it!)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve read many a guide that say necros can&#39;t fight yellow/red mobs solo<br/>
after level 20 anymore (several reasons, one being you&#39;re never going to<br/>
summon better than a blue pet after 20) I use a method of kiting.  Since<br/>
necromancers don&#39;t have a spirit of the wolf type spell, many people think<br/>
they can&#39;t kite, this is incorrect.  You may not be able to speed yourself<br/>
up, but you can definitely slow the mob down, the darkness line of spells<br/>
are imho the best line of spells the necromancer gets.  Picture this, you<br/>
hit the yellow/red (make sure it&#39;s a *low* red, high reds will resist<br/>
everything you chuck at them and you&#39;ll end up a necro grease spot) with<br/>
engulfing darkness, pulling it onto you.  run a ways out, hit the mob with<br/>
heat blood, run a ways further then hit with heart flutter, disease cloud is<br/>
nice to throw in as well, it speeds up the process.  A few more seconds and<br/>
the mob is nearing half health...this is when you send the pet after it.  At<br/>
this point the mob should be so ticked at you, it will ignore your pet<br/>
beating on it from behind (generally)  Now is a good time to renew that<br/>
engulfing darkness spell! You don&#39;t want the mob speeding up and chasing you<br/>
down.<br/>
Keep running away, keep track of the mob&#39;s health.  If it turns on your pet,<br/>
let them melee a bit, then smack it with a siphon life to get it nice and<br/>
ticked at you again, keep it up and the mob will fall over dead...nice chunk<br/>
of xp, and generally better loot than those measly blues you were picking on<br/>
before.  I use this tactic when I&#39;m unable to find a decent group, as it&#39;s<br/>
quite boring, and not exactly the best way to see the world.  Also for<br/>
obvious reasons it&#39;s useless in a dungeon environment, but it lets you get<br/>
revenge on some of those high level beasties that used to smack you down a<br/>
bit earlier in the life of your character.  (I plan on paying Holly<br/>
Windstalker a visit soon, and let me tell you, there&#39;s no better sound than<br/>
a treant&#39;s scream.)<br/>

&gt; &gt; So don&#39;t do the 3 DoT combo on it while your pet tanks?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   You can do the 3 DoT combo, just do it slowly, making sure the pet<br/>
&gt;   gets sufficient whacks in on the mob.<br/>
