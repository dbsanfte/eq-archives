<div id="ygrps-yiv-590429982">So invis until about to zone to 3rd gate then invis vs undead to get past<br/>
ghouls?<br/>
Should I still assume that SK guild in neriak is still KOS? Not that they<br/>
necessarily have the pet spells we need there (def not the 20th lev pet).<br/>
Bah, little point for me anyway.. i am on a racewar server 8)<br/>
<br/>
I would love to finda good resource for necro factions and how to alter<br/>
them... I suppose slaying the woodelf rangers alot hasnt really helped my<br/>
Kelethin and felwith factions much... 8)<br/>

<br/>
You&#39;re tolerated in Freeport, Ak&#39;Anon (your home town), and Neriak, though<br/>
not all merchants will sell to you, and there are sometimes a few people<br/>
to stay away from.  You start out KoS to the guards in Grobb and Oggok<br/>
(which have shadowknight guilds you could buy spells at if they didn&#39;t<br/>
kill you).  Not sure about Qeynos or Erudin, both of which have necro<br/>
guilds.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, as a Gnecro myself, Neriak has been the easist place for me to<br/>
buy those spells shared with another class that aren&#39;t available at the<br/>
Freeport necro guild (shielding, gate, bind affinity, cancel magic, cure<br/>
disease, etc). Most other cities, you won&#39;t be allowed in the non-necro<br/>
magic or cleric guild, but they&#39;re indifferent in Neriak.  Oddly, the<br/>
necro guild has some indifferent and a lot of dubious (won&#39;t sell)<br/>
merchants.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Does anyone have a faction list of what we can do to be liked (if not for<br/>
&gt; real, enough that they sell to us).  I heard that we can actually enter<br/>
3rd<br/>
&gt; Gate (invis to ghouls) and be able to buy SOME spells there from some<br/>
&gt; merchants. <br/>
<br/>
Yup.  Most merchants (including the bank) outside of the necro guild are<br/>
indifferent to you, and guards are dubious. Invis to undead to pass the<br/>
ghouls, and buy from about half of the necro vendors.<br/>
<br/>
http://users.net1inc.net/mr_boffo/faction.htm has some info on raising<br/>
various factions, and AllaKhazam (http://everquest.allakhazam.com) has a<br/>
faction section that&#39;s mostly complete.<br/>
