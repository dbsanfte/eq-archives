<b>Subject:</b> L30, now what? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-364930257">Made L30 this weekend, have a few questions:<br/>
<br/>
1) any hints on the SolRo quests beyond what&#39;s on Allakhazam&#39;s<br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/quests/Q_Temple_Solusek.htm)">http://everquest.allakhazam.com/quests/Q_Temple_Solusek.htm)</a>?<br/>
<br/>
For the Harvester, I need a shadowed knife, which is from a goblin in OOT<br/>
rather than a shadowed man.  Where in OOT can I find the goblin<br/>
headmaster?  Is he soloable at 30?<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts on shadow men?  Do all the items drop randomly off all the<br/>
shadow men, or are there better places than others to find the shadowed<br/>
scythe and eye/hand/mask of shadow.  Are there any camps that are<br/>
soloable or takable by a pair/trio, or will I need a full group?<br/>
<br/>
2) where&#39;s good hunting (and good groups) at L30?  Sarnaks, goblins, and<br/>
forest giants in Warsliks and Lake of Ill Omen have been great from 20-29,<br/>
and it was always easy to find or start a decent group. Now those spots<br/>
are starting to green out.<br/>
<br/>
I came back to the old world at 30 to try some of my old haunts, but both<br/>
cazic-thule and unrest have been very disappointing.  The unrest basement<br/>
wasn&#39;t bad except for the powerlevellers (2 different L50+ druids<br/>
levelling L20-L25 people) pulling past us and causing havoc.  Cazic would<br/>
be nice, except the three groups I found all had at least one complete<br/>
idiot in them, and we spent more time zoning/dieing than fighting.<br/>
<br/>
Any advice appreciated.  I don&#39;t like soloing very much (too much<br/>
downtime, not enough interaction, and no chance to use our best abilities<br/>
like shadow compact and screaming terror), but I&#39;ll consider it since<br/>
downtime in a bad group is worse than soloing.<br/>
