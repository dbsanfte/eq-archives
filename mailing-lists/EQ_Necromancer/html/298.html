&gt;    What reasons have they given for this, not giving us numerical values<br/>
&gt;for our mana ?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;        Maybe it&#39;s just the mood I&#39;m in, but do they strike you as pricks?<br/>
&gt;I mean, honestly.. they give us, in the spell&#39;s info, how much mana it<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;to cast it, but they&#39;re out-right refusing to give us numbers showing how<br/>
&gt;much mana we have?  They&#39;re just being pricks about it, or at least, that&#39;s<br/>
&gt;how it seems to me.  What basis would they have for not?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;        Not to mention all of the other limitations, and the &quot;you&#39;re in our<br/>
&gt;world now&quot; that I thought was just a cool slogan, but now seems to be more<br/>
&gt;of another way to say, &quot;this is our world, we&#39;re in control, we think for<br/>
&gt;you, we decide how you play, where you go, what you see, and if you don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;like it _leave_ because it&#39;s _MINE_&quot; .  That&#39;s B.S., we pay for this...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    I dunno, I think I&#39;ll keep EQ until another company comes out with a<br/>
&gt;full 3D fantasy role-playing world.  You know it&#39;ll happen, and maybe<br/>
&gt;they&#39;ll have their stuff straight.<br/>

&gt;&gt;    While the idea is a good one, Verant is very very very skeptical of<br/>
&gt;&gt; putting in any numbers beyond what they have already given. If they were<br/>
&gt;&gt; willing to give us this type of spell, they should also be willing to<br/>
