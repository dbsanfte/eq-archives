<div id="ygrps-yiv-1798051119"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; DD and DoTs both have pluses and minuses, yet both are incredibly<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have to agree with this strategy, I&#39;m already seeing how it will work, and<br/>
if you do in fact cause the mob to frenzy on you and ignore your pet, more<br/>
power to ya, if you hit the baddie with a darkness spell you can easily walk<br/>
backwards and stay ahead of it, while your DoT spells do their work, and<br/>
your pet bashes him from behind, I&#39;ve killed countless nro mobs using this<br/>
technique since making level 12.</div>
