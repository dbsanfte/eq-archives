<div id="ygrps-yiv-1135358080">Cable modem is superior to dial-up in every aspect imaginable.  First, the<br/>
simple fact that when your computer is on, your always on the Internet (no<br/>
dialing, no busy signals, etc.).  Secondly, it is a LOT more<br/>
faster...whether you are surfing the web, downloading programs, or playing<br/>
EverQuest; you will notice a difference.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, with Road Runner, it does vary depending on number of people online in<br/>
your area (However, I don&#39;t find this to be a current problem), but Road<br/>
Runner is under-going MAJOR changes right now.  Just recently they increased<br/>
their bandwidth in Kansas City by 300% and other areas with other upgrades.<br/>
Some of the best techs available for all your problems too.<br/>
<br/>
To say the least...make the switch.  You won&#39;t regret it.<br/>

Subject: [EQ_Necromancer] Cable Modem question<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Hi folks,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I recently moved to a neighborhood where Roadrunner Cable Modem service is<br/>
&gt; available.  I was going to just keep my 56K dialup connection, but due to<br/>
&gt; the phone wiring in the neighborhood (paired-back copper more than 15000<br/>
&gt; feet from a substation) the highest connection speed I can get is 26.4K.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My question is this:  Other than the fact that a cable modem connection<br/>
&gt; slows down with each additional person logged in, are there any known<br/>
issues<br/>
&gt; with running a cable modem and playing Everquest?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Secondly, will this faster connection actually benefit me in any way (with<br/>
&gt; regard to playing Everquest)?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks in advance for the info.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
