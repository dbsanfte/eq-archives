<b>Subject:</b> Gnome Necro Faction <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1807978678">I am a Gnome Necro trying to increase my faction in some key locations,<br/>
currently Butcherblock.  By killing goblins and Dwarven Bandits I have got<br/>
my faction that I am dubious to everyone, merchants and guards alike.  Now<br/>
Guards won&#39;t kill me, but Merchants won&#39;t sell to me, and worse the BANKER<br/>
looks at me threatenly (I assume he will kill me if I try and bank).  How<br/>
can I increase merchant and banker faction?<br/>
<br/>
Also, I heard that anywhere there is a necro guild I can enter the city and<br/>
not be KOS, Freeport, Qeynos, & Ak&#39;Anon, is this true?<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have a faction list of what we can do to be liked (if not for<br/>
real, enough that they sell to us).  I heard that we can actually enter 3rd<br/>
Gate (invis to ghouls) and be able to buy SOME spells there from some<br/>
merchants. <br/>
<br/>
Any help to a new Gnome Necro would be great...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your time,<br/>
Abra</div>
