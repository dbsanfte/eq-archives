<div id="ygrps-yiv-2135006168"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt;&gt;Something else is their apparent psychic connection with the planet.  I<br/>
&gt; mean, seriously, you&#39;re completely across the zone from the thing and it<br/>
&gt; will still know where you&#39;re at, even if you&#39;re far under ground and it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; top side _and_ all the way on the other side of the zone make its<br/>
&gt; way to you<br/>
&gt; through maze or &#39;high water&#39; and begin pounding the snot out of you&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If there&#39;s one thing that does need to be fixed, it is this. You can&#39;t run<br/>
&gt; away from anyone unless you&#39;ve cast some spell that slows your enemy down.<br/>
&gt; On top of that, they don&#39;t stop unless you zone or they&#39;re killed by<br/>
&gt; somebody. It&#39;d be nice if the game had a LOS variable for monsters that<br/>
&gt; figured whether or not they knew where you were at any given point.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>In Everfrost, my shaman character can outrun Ice Boned Skeletons and &#39;break<br/>
their lock&#39; so they can&#39;t find/attack me. Of course, this is easier with<br/>
SoW, but even without you can get away. OTOH, mammoths NEVER forget you....<br/>
so maybe it depends on the creature?<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to apply shaman experience in the necro mailing list, but I have more<br/>
experience in that world.</div>
