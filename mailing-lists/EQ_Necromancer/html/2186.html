<div id="ygrps-yiv-763074161">I have heard of a quest in Karnor&#39;s that will raise your Venril Sathir, but<br/>
it is broken.  What I want to know is, if it is broken how do they know what<br/>
faction it raises?  Unfortunately, that is all I know about it.  I&#39;m sure<br/>
that there are more than just these 2 quests to raise your Venril faction,<br/>
but they have to be found.<br/>
