<div id="ygrps-yiv-1202697150">I&#39;d be more than happy to help you out with info.  Perhaps the most accurate<br/>
way to find out how much damage spell x does is to try it on the PVP<br/>
server...that way you can have a friend that you cast on relay exact numbers<br/>
back.  Of course this requires an active PVP necro, do we have any of those<br/>
on the list?  Also, I believe the damage is not static, it depends on the<br/>
level of the mob/player you cast on and their resistance levels to said<br/>
magic.<br/>

&gt; Hello All<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am currently running both a magician and a necromancer. I personally am<br/>
&gt; the type of person that would rather know where to go and how-to do things<br/>
&gt; rather then taking months to figure it all out myself. This is mostly<br/>
&gt; because I&#39;m busy in my RL with work, marriage etc, etc ... Thus, for me,<br/>
&gt; just keeping up in levels near my friends is hard enough, much less<br/>
running<br/>
&gt; around everywhere trying to find everything myself.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There are a few things I find lacking in the main stream web sites info.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A. The spell lists are out dated and don&#39;t provide the info I want. IE<br/>
they<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t say this spell does this damage for this manna, here is the ratio.<br/>
It<br/>
&gt; takes this many secs to cast with the channeling skill maxed for the level<br/>
&gt; you first receive the spell. The necro DOT does X damage a tick for X<br/>
ticks.<br/>
&gt; I would find that kind of extra statistics helpful.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; B. Where do you buy the darn spell? No site I have found is attempting to<br/>
&gt; keep a list of vendor locations and their inventory and pricing for some<br/>
&gt; base charisma.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; C. The above info should be integrated to include if each spell is<br/>
research<br/>
&gt; only or not. The status of research for that spell. IE broken or not. And<br/>
if<br/>
&gt; not broken what are the components to make the spell, what book and what<br/>
&gt; lang etc. </span></blockquote></div>
