<div id="ygrps-yiv-691211678"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; All I can say is... WOW... if this actually works and isn&#39;t resisted by<br/>
&gt; greens 50% of the time this is one sweet change.  Actually have something<br/>
&gt; really useful to contribute to a group.  Unfortunately I am going away on<br/>
&gt; vacation tomorrow morning so I won&#39;t have much time to play with it until<br/>
&gt; next week =(<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Looking at Caster&#39;s Realm, I&#39;m not a happy soul stealer...it seems that<br/>
screaming terror will fall under the same category as mesmerize as far as<br/>
resists...prime stat for lowering resists on mes?  That&#39;s right...every<br/>
necro&#39;s lowest stat...charisma.  Hope you didn&#39;t plan on actually *using*<br/>
this spell anytime soon :P</div>
