<div id="ygrps-yiv-1617880559">personally ive liked even the idea of the necro when i heard about it while <br/>
eq was still in development.  i have to say i like the class, and we really <br/>
do have many advantages that other classes dont get.  the ability to heal <br/>
ourselves in combat while doing DD is very good, as is having a pet skel.  <br/>
our mastery over the undead is great too. the only bad thing is getting KOS <br/>
by a great deal of npc&#39;s, but there has to be a trade-off somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
other classes i was looking at for a second character was either a druid or <br/>
a shaman- both seem to have a pretty broad base of spells.  an enchanter may <br/>
also be good, but i havent decided =)<br/>

&gt;I have a wizard who is 14th and I just started a necro and am 2nd lvl. ..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I think Necromancer may be the way to go but I would like to hear your<br/>
&gt;opinions,  how is the high lvl Necro stuff going?  Can you hold your own???<br/>
&gt;I like my 14th lvl wizard and I think I might just use both classes but I&#39;d<br/>
&gt;like to hear input . . .<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks!<br/>
