<div id="ygrps-yiv-1818929104">In nek, the scythe was easy :) it was the mortuary fungus that was a<br/>
pain...much more difficult than the globe for the robe in guk.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Where were you hunting the shadowmen at?  I hunted in nek and I would get<br/>
&gt; about 3 to 4 scythes a night, and everything else was hard to find, but I<br/>
&gt; did find it all and I must say I look like a bad ass dressed in all black<br/>
&gt; running around with a scythe in 1 hand and dirk in the other :) </span></blockquote></div>
