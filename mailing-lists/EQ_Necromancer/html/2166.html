<b>Subject:</b> Pets get buffed??? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-681007012">Did anyone 49+ notice if our pets were changed lately? Im 52 now, and have<br/>
been getting tons of green pets lately (since next pet is 53). 2 out of the<br/>
3 possible levels for the pets were green (last week).  Anyways, this week<br/>
i&#39;ve yet to get a green one. I summoned 2 pets, both blue, i figured cool<br/>
its blue its must be my big one. But my buddy is lev 54, meaning everything<br/>
i summon should be green to him (as they were last week), decided to /con<br/>
them, the first one was blue to him as well, and the second one was green to<br/>
him (blue to me). This got us really stumped (and happy too) <br/>
<br/>
Could it be that:<br/>
1. They beefed up our pets in levels?<br/>
2. They changed the /con table?<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else notice anything?<br/>
