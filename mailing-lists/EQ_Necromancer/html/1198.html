<div id="ygrps-yiv-323690546">I was wondering what the consensus on the upcoming nerf/patch to the DoT<br/>
spells is among other necros.  Personally, I&#39;m f&#39;n outraged about it.  I<br/>
might even have to start playing another class if they mess it up bad<br/>
enough.  I just hit lv 20 and they pull this stuff.  We&#39;re being penalized<br/>
for soloing, yet necromancers are a solitary class, practically useless in<br/>
groups. (unless you&#39;re fighting undead)  Verant needs to hear our voices on<br/>
this.  If kiting is the problem, then why not change one spell (SoW) instead<br/>
of a whole line of spells that make up the bulk of our offense?<br/>
