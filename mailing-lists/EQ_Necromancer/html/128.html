<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1723969608">12 is whre the necros get their first taste of REAL POWER, their pet is a<br/>
complete bad ass, being able to hit magic creatures and having a ton of HP,<br/>
plus get get a drain spell that does 32 or so damage, i don&#39;t know exactly,<br/>
plus heat blood which does around 100 DOT Damage Over Time, and heart<br/>
flutter which i hear is cool but have never tried it.  One of my friends had<br/>
a problem from 10-12, it took him 2 weeks for 2 lvls, but after he hit 12 he<br/>
got to 16 in 2 weeks, 4 lvls.  I would say 10-11 is the hardest for a necro,<br/>
because skels don&#39;t give ya hardly any xp at lvl 10 and at 11, and nothing<br/>
else is easy to kill because they either own your pet, or shrug off your<br/>
shitty drain spell that does a WHOPPING 11 or 12 damage, hehe.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hello.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I recently started a new dark elf necromancer on Mythannial Marr. I&#39;m a<br/>
&gt;whole lev 2 at this point. I haven&#39;t trained any skills yet at the guild<br/>
&gt;hall. Can I get some advice as to what spells to focus on? Is 2H staffs the<br/>
&gt;weapon I should be using?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also at what level will I start to get a good feel for being a necromancer<br/>
&gt;and start coming into my own? Are there any levels I should just gut out?<br/>
&gt;For example my lev 15 magician had a very rough time at lev7 but at lev8<br/>
&gt;things were MUCH easier. When I get lev 16 with my magician tomorrow or the<br/>
&gt;next day I&#39;ll again see a HUGE increase in power. I&#39;m assuming Necromancers<br/>
&gt;work the same way?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Any tips would be appreciated.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
