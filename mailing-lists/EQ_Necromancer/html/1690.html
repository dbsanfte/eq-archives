  The specs can go as high as lvl. 37, so I can only guess that the feerott<br/>
  specs were not as high a level when you were soloing them.<br/>
<br/>
  Otherwise, I can&#39;t imagine how you could get any spells to stick on a mob 5<br/>
  levels above yourself.<br/>

  &gt;Well... I had different experiences with Spectres.  I solo&#39;d the one on the<br/>
  &gt;hill in Feerott at 32nd level quite easily.  The only problem is finding it<br/>
  &gt;uncamped. If you&#39;re lucky, a group of high levels might be there pulling the<br/>
  &gt;cave and all.  While this sounds like an unfortunate situation, I was able<br/>
  &gt;to convince them to let me have the lone hill spawn a few times (since they<br/>
  &gt;had the entire cave).  As for strategy, I think Spectres are one of the most<br/>
  &gt;susceptible mobs in the game to Darkness... which makes them totally pud.  I<br/>
  &gt;didn&#39;t use my pet, but it was also before the kiting patch.  I suppose a<br/>
  &gt;darkness + fear + pet would work pretty well.  I found that they didn&#39;t root<br/>
  &gt;very well, tho.  Especially with the undead root.. so beware of that.  Oh..<br/>
  &gt;another tip.. if you do root with the undead root, sometimes you can&#39;t use<br/>
  &gt;the other normal root right afterwards (it says &#39;Your spell did not take<br/>
  &gt;hold&#39;).  I think it is some kind of bug with the undead one.. thinking that<br/>
  &gt;the mob is still rooted with a higher level root (since that one is a 16th<br/>
  &gt;level including damage and the other one is a 4th level wizzie root).<br/>

  &gt; &gt; I would not solo specs until you are at least 2 shades of blue over them.<br/>
  &gt; &gt; They are mean critters, and if your first darkness/fear spell does not<br/>
  &gt; &gt; stick, you may not get another chance.<br/>
  &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; You are far better off soloing Vhalen at the well in SK.<br/>

  The demon is a liar. He will lie to confuse us. But he will also mix lies<br/>
  with the truth to attack us. The attack is psychological, but powerful. So<br/>
  don&#39;t listen, remember that, do not listen.<br/>
