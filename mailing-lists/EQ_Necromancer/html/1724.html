<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-649780067">If you haven&#39;t already, go take a look over at the EQCasters site. They have <br/>
said that they are going to be adding 2 pet heal spells?! Correct me if I&#39;m <br/>
mistaken, but I thought that we got pet heal spells because regular peoples&#39; <br/>
heals would not work on OUR pets, but they would on Mages. I guess its <br/>
true-Anyone besides Necromancer(lol), who whines long enough, gets what they <br/>
want.</div>
