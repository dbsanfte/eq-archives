&gt; <br/>
&gt;     I&#39;ve noticed that, it&#39;s how I see if there&#39;s any piranah <br/>
&gt; or what not.<br/>
&gt; Which are usually too quick to get back out of the water <br/>
&gt; from, considering<br/>
&gt; if they hit ya, you&#39;re stunned, ate alive, stunned, repeat...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;     It doesn&#39;t have to treat it as two worlds, though, and <br/>
&gt; none of these<br/>
&gt; clipping problems have to happen.  People say, they&#39;re <br/>
&gt; breaking new ground.<br/>
&gt; When you think about it, they&#39;re really not.  Take, for <br/>
&gt; instance, Quake.<br/>
&gt; Now, before you freak out and trash me on this one, they&#39;re <br/>
&gt; really not all<br/>
&gt; that differant.  They&#39;re both (able to be) played online, <br/>
&gt; both have walls,<br/>
&gt; both have water and land areas, weapons for swinging close or <br/>
&gt; attacking from<br/>
&gt; afar, etc.  Quake creatures, however, do not walk through <br/>
&gt; walls, strike<br/>
&gt; through walls, or any of that jive, and nor do other players, <br/>
&gt; when playing<br/>
&gt; over the &#39;net.  And they&#39;re both full 3D worlds.  I know, I <br/>
&gt; know, EQ is a<br/>
&gt; &quot;fantasy role-playing&quot; game, and quake is just a shooter, but <br/>
&gt; the same basic<br/>
&gt; concept is there.  Why does EQ have to treat water areas a differant<br/>
&gt; &quot;world&quot;, or at least not have interaction between the two?  <br/>
&gt; Differant engin,<br/>
&gt; but learn from others, I&#39;m sure they could &quot;easily&quot; allow this.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>	ITs how games are made, things are always different.  Why does<br/>
Tribes have an issue with TNT OpenGl cards and their outside textures?<br/>
Descent 3 doesn&#39;t?  Developers don&#39;t share all that much, thus you make do<br/>
with what you have.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;     True, however they need a distance limitation on it or <br/>
&gt; something.  I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t want everybody walking around in plate and all carring <br/>
&gt; 999 of all coin<br/>
&gt; type, but let&#39;s not be paranoid about it..  This is <br/>
&gt; especially troublesome<br/>
&gt; for us Necros, with types like Holly Windstalker and such.  <br/>
&gt; Hell, I was just<br/>
&gt; walking through the zone and she apparently ran clear across <br/>
&gt; the zone to get<br/>
&gt; me. I never seen her, how&#39;d she even know I was there?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>	Dunno what happened there, did you attack her before?  I know if you<br/>
kill a Neriak guard as a Dark Elf they HAVE to kill you once before they go<br/>
back to being unagg.  This happens even if you zone.  Was she chasing<br/>
someone else who just happened to train her into you?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 view though.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt;     I love the other views, but ironically I hardly ever use <br/>
&gt; them.  The only<br/>
&gt; duel I&#39;ve done is with a friend I know here in person, still <br/>
&gt; both at very<br/>
&gt; low levels but him about four or so levels lower.  Hehe.. <br/>
&gt; poor guy, didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; stand a chance..<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;     As for using the pet as a shield, I do, and nor do I go <br/>
&gt; nuts with the<br/>
&gt; spell.  I hate being frenzied (*cough*befallen*cough*) by <br/>
&gt; really big mobs,<br/>
&gt; but that doesn&#39;t work quite so well.  I also trade hits with <br/>
&gt; my skeleton,<br/>
&gt; stop and life tap, etc.  I just don&#39;t have the mana to last, <br/>
&gt; though.  My<br/>
&gt; char&#39;s Int is 90.  At the time, I thought that was a big <br/>
&gt; number.  Heh, yet<br/>
&gt; again been bit by the instruction-booklet blues.. Too much <br/>
&gt; work into the<br/>
&gt; char, though, to start over.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>	I&#39;m not a powergamer, but I would DEFINITELY start over.  Really.  A<br/>
friend of mine has an intelligence of 109 and he&#39;s level 21 and being hurt<br/>
by it already.  At an INT of 90 you would have at level 20 400 mana while I<br/>
would have (INT 127) 540.  A 140 point difference.  Things start costing a<br/>
LOT more too.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt;     I&#39;ve yet to see any &quot;words&quot; or &quot;runes&quot;.  Perhaps I&#39;m just <br/>
&gt; not killing<br/>
&gt; the right creatures.  I&#39;ve thought about killing Lanshune <br/>
&gt; Novashine (sp?) in<br/>
&gt; Qeynos, as he walks around outside and I hear NPC spell-casters and<br/>
&gt; intelligent mobs & such will have them, but I really don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; need the faction<br/>
&gt; hit..<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>	I get them from pretty much anything above level 12 creatures.<br/>
Eles, orcs, rock dervishes, lava crawlers.  Look for inherently magic<br/>
creatures.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;     So why have spells that can only be obtained there?  How <br/>
&gt; are we supposed<br/>
&gt; to get to them?  Have somebody buy them for us?  I don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; think so, they then<br/>
&gt; want a cut of the money and you never know if they&#39;re really <br/>
&gt; going to go in<br/>
&gt; and buy it for you, or not, especially with evil charecters.  <br/>
&gt; Supposed to be<br/>
&gt; solo, but yet they make us rely on somebody else. ;)  I <br/>
&gt; wonder, what with<br/>
&gt; the griffens in the newbie area around Freeport and this, if <br/>
&gt; the developers<br/>
&gt; at varant just have that twisted a since of humor. *grin*<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>	They are there to keep people on their toes mostly.  I think one<br/>
would have been enough for that though.  If its one thing that&#39;s been<br/>
drilled into me since Day One, its being evil is hard.  Good guys get along.<br/>
Evil guys do not.  Why should we let humans into our guild?  They suck!<br/>
Their paleskins, they should be killed on site for even attempting to<br/>
imitate us in their pathetic way.  Sure they have their uses, but... ;)  See<br/>
how it works?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;     We can deal with the guild, btw, I&#39;ve heard others <br/>
&gt; mention that they&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; been to the merchants once they got past the ghouls.  And I <br/>
&gt; know I have Invs<br/>
&gt; VS Undead, but I don&#39;t see why we&#39;d have to do that.  It&#39;s <br/>
&gt; the Necro guild..<br/>
&gt; *shrug* oh well.   For that matter, there&#39;s the shadow knight guild<br/>
&gt; in..err..Oggok?..that there&#39;s a problem getting into, as well...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>	Same problem.  Most Trolls are KOS in Oggok too I think.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt;     Yeah, you do, but don&#39;t forget the obvious things, or the <br/>
&gt; point of the<br/>
&gt; game; to have fun.  They seemed to have brushed the latter a <br/>
&gt; bit under the<br/>
&gt; rug in favor of &#39;knowing when to quit&#39;.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>	Absolutely.<br/>
