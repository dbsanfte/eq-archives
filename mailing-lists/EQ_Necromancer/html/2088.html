<div id="ygrps-yiv-1392702757">Hi, <br/>
<br/>
I have some questions about Northern Ro. <br/>
<br/>
In the north part of Northern Ro, in the <br/>
desert near the city is a merchant.  She <br/>
sells to evil races, and is usually on the <br/>
east side.  Recently she has moved to the <br/>
west side, and farther north near the zone<br/>
 to E. Freeport.  More importantly she <br/>
won&#39;t sell to me anymore.  Says she is busy.<br/>
Has anybody seen this before?  She cons <br/>
apprehensive to me.  She&#39;s been like this <br/>
for several days, so its not that she just <br/>
chased somebody to the zone. <br/>
<br/>
Also, over the weekend, Dorn changed from <br/>
&#39;amiable&#39; to me, to &#39;ready to attack&#39;.  <br/>
Has anybody noticed this before?  Does he <br/>
get nasty from time to time. <br/>
<br/>
I am DE Necromancer.  I haven&#39;t been killing <br/>
Dervs.  This is happening on the Fennin Ro <br/>
server. <br/>
<br/>
It seems to rain a lot more too, but that <br/>
could just be the seasons.  <br/>
<br/>
Just curious.  <br/>
<br/>
