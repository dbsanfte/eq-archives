&gt; Turn based? Have you ever played ANY of these games? They&#39;re not turn<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; role playing games.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, I have played these games...VERY much and that how I know a good deal<br/>
about them. They are turn based, but give the illusion of realtime.<br/>
Basically its you attack, roll, miss, he attacks, roll, hit.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Are you on drugs? These are ALL first person shooter perspective.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I did misuse the word &quot;persepective&quot; here. However, the point I was trying<br/>
to convery was that in my opinion something like SWG should not be turn<br/>
based. It should be more in line with Unreal Touney, Quake 3, Doom 3, etc.<br/>
Aiming a weapon at point blank range and letting the computer basically roll<br/>
a die to see if it hit you sucks. It sounds like they have the right idea<br/>
for the space flight expansion however.<br/>
<br/>
And to answer the first part of your question, the answer is no. I never<br/>
have and never will. You can&#39;t expect to do well in these games if you kill<br/>
half of your freakin brain cells.  I am a professional software developer<br/>
and you can&#39;t expect to be a doper, write good code and keep your job when<br/>
you are stoned.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What, by the way, does RvR mean?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Realm vs. Realm combat. I believe Marlon answered that one in another post<br/>
so I won&#39;t give you the gory details.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; EQ2 uses the same engine as Star Wars Galaxies, which you were just<br/>
 </span></blockquote>dissing.<br/>
<br/>
Um, not in the slightest. Try reading the FAQ from each game sometime. They<br/>
have created TWO totally seperate engines. The EQ2 engine is still VERY zone<br/>
based. The devs claim this helps with creating very area specific content<br/>
with tons of detail without hampering the server too much. SWG wants a VERY<br/>
seamless and vast environment.<br/>
<br/>
Here are the excerpts from each FAQ<br/>
<br/>
What 3D engine will EQII use?<br/>
EverQuest II utilizes a proprietary 3D engine, which was developed in-house<br/>
by the EQII programming team. The EQII engine takes full advantage of<br/>
current cutting edge 3D hardware, as well as future hardware technology.<br/>
<br/>
11.05 What engine will you use?<br/>
The Star Wars Galaxies team is creating an entirely new 3D engine for this<br/>
title. The engine will be specifically designed to portray the Star Wars<br/>
universe in the greatest possible detail. The team will be using<br/>
Verant/SOE&#39;s experience in creating 3D engines for MMO titles and may<br/>
incorporate elements from engines currently in development at the company<br/>
<br/>
If you read each games FAQ in its entirety you will see that each game wants<br/>
something very different in their respective engine. These are two VERY<br/>
different dev teams each creating an engine.<br/>
<br/>
And no, I was not &quot;dissing&quot; any engine, I was only stating what I like and<br/>
dont like with the engines.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Yeah, my wife has one account without Luclin, and I barely comprehend how<br/>
 </span></blockquote>we<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; played back then. You really must have the new graphics engine in order to<br/>
&gt; appreciate how far along EQ&#39;s come.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thats what my friends who still play tell me. It sounds very nice.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Nope, their lack of foresight&#39;s probably losing them this player. I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; have the resources nowadays to spend ANY money &quot;just in case I like it<br/>
 </span></blockquote>more<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; than the game I enjoy playing now&quot;. Even when I was annoyed with EQ a year<br/>
&gt; ago, there were plenty of MMORPGs out there who would let me try them<br/>
 </span></blockquote>free.<br/>
<br/>
Well, that of course is entirely up to you.<br/>
