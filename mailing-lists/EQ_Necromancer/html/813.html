<div id="ygrps-yiv-1650713969">Well, I am a gnome necromancer. I know it may not be popular but I would<br/>
rather be a Red Robed necromancer than a Black Robed one.  This was one of<br/>
my major factors in deciding on the gnome race.  (Other than I love to<br/>
tinker and such.) One of my life goals is to someday be able to stroll into<br/>
all of the &quot;good&quot; cities right past the guards with my head held high. To<br/>
this end I already have the Dwarves and Hal flings down to Dubious. I have<br/>
yet to start in any major way on the Queynos folks, or the Euridites.<br/>
<br/>
On a separate subject...I am fast approaching level 20. My question is not<br/>
which spells to buy, I normally buy them all anyway, but which spells do<br/>
folks normally keep memorized when they go into battle? This seems like the<br/>
hardest balancing act in the game. With only eight slots and an even sixty<br/>
spells to choose from, it&#39;s enough to make my little brain literally pop<br/>
from indecision. &lt;smile&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Any help would be appreciated.<br/>
<br/>

Oserus (gnome necro on Veshaan)<br/>

You realize that Trolls, Ogres, and DarkElves shouldn&#39;t ever kill<br/>
Crushbone Orcs.  It just a bad thing :)<br/>

&gt; elves. (Full Scowl ready to Attack.) However, after killing about 380 orcs<br/>
&gt; in crush bone (I kept a tally sheet) they now are down to Glares<br/>
