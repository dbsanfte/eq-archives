<div id="ygrps-yiv-1706730553">I was in fact able to finish a quest while invisible.  I was in Qeynos and<br/>
everything there is ready to attack.  I was trying to raise faction, so i<br/>
was doing the quest where you give 2 gold to Den Magason by the docks.<br/>
After I gave him the money I got some blank scrolls that I didn&#39;t need<br/>
because I was only doing the quest for faction.  I had a friend with me that<br/>
was hailing him to keep him from wandering away.  My friend said that after<br/>
I gave the NPC the 2 gold the first time that I became visible.  I still had<br/>
the gather Shadows icon and no one was rushing over to kill me.  Other PC&#39;s<br/>
could see me, but the NPC&#39;s couldn&#39;t.  I was able to sit there and give him<br/>
enough to get to threateningly before my Invis finally did wear off.  The<br/>
odd part was that I did NOT get the warning that I was about to appear and<br/>
thus I had no time to run away and I did die.  But the point is that I WAS<br/>
able to give gold and receive quest items back while invis.  This was about<br/>
1 month ago.  Since I was visible to PC&#39;s and didn&#39;t get a warning, it seems<br/>
to me that they intend for you to become visible and because of that, it may<br/>
have been fixed in any one of the patches since then.  I will try to do<br/>
another quest invis and let you all know if it still works.<br/>

I think that initiating in a trade will remove your invisibility.But it may<br/>
be possible that being invisible will allow you to complete a quest.For<br/>
instance, if you have the Hide skill, going hidden will change an NPCs<br/>
faction with you to indifferent.Maybe the same works with Invisibility.<br/>
