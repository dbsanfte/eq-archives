&gt; I can kill nearly all fire elementals in Lavastorm at level 13, most near<br/>
&gt; the entrance /con blue to me... And they give quite a good amount of exp.<br/>
&gt; Lava basilisks are good targets as well.<br/>
<br/>
I went back to lavastorm at level 22, and found a fire elemental that was<br/>
blue ;) that&#39;s why I said he should stay away from them.  There are some<br/>
that are *very* tough.  Plus the fact that their fire shields will more<br/>
often than not, kill your pet.  I figure if someone is confident enough in<br/>
their abilities, they will eventually try everything in a zone, I just like<br/>
to tell peeps what the easiest mobs are, and which ones can potentially<br/>
destroy you in an instant. </span></blockquote></div>
