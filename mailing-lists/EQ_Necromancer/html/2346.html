<div id="ygrps-yiv-1894054570">Ok, I love my Necromancer (Quellious Server) but I have to admit that <br/>
research is a pain. My druid is lvl 61 and it was never this hard to <br/>
get my spells. My druid gets EXP easy to by &quot;snare, root, and triple <br/>
dotting&quot;... where as with my Necromancer I have to either snare/dot <br/>
and gain agro off my pet and run it around chasing me or fear kite <br/>
it. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s almost as if EQ is creating characters for each person&#39;s <br/>
personality. Bards for those who when fighting love to key many keys. <br/>
Necromancer for the quest type lovers, and Druid for those who love <br/>
the easy way and to chat more than play. plus, Clerics for those who <br/>
want to simply help group members but spend more time sitting <br/>
around... amoung other classes. Even Monks for karate loving people!<br/>
