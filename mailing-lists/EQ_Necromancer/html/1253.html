<div id="ygrps-yiv-1938771118">The level 29 pet gets duel wield, however only if you give it 2 *different*<br/>
weapons I usually give him a magician&#39;s summoned dagger so he can hit<br/>
magical creatures just in case, and if I have one handy, a fine steel for<br/>
the off hand. To be honest I don&#39;t know if it makes him faster or not, but<br/>
it certainly seems like he is. :)<br/>

&gt; Ok I have had this question for awhile.  I suppose some of you high level<br/>
&gt; necros can probably help here.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When I was in the low levels everyone told me it was always best to give<br/>
 </span></blockquote>my<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; pet a rusty weapon to help it do more damage when it attacked.<br/>
&gt; I was told that once I got the 12th level pets that giving them weapons<br/>
 </span></blockquote>was<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; bad because they hit for more damage and more often without a weapon.<br/>
&gt; Lately I have been seeing many high level necros giving their pets a fine<br/>
&gt; steel dagger.<br/>
&gt; So here are the questions.<br/>
&gt; 1) do you only give the pet a FS dagger if you KNOW the stuff it will be<br/>
&gt; attacking can always be hit by non magic weapons?<br/>
&gt; 2)  Can you give the pet more than one dagger since it can double attack<br/>
&gt; and duel weild at higher levels?<br/>
&gt; 3)  At what level does giving a pet a FS dagger become more benificial<br/>
 </span></blockquote>than<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; letting it use its fists?<br/>
&gt; 4)  If pets do get the double attack and duel weild what level pet can I<br/>
&gt; give more than one weapon two?<br/>
&gt; 5)  I understand that the FS dagger is used because of its low delay.  Is<br/>
&gt; any other weapon a good alternate choice if a FS dagger is not available?<br/>
&gt; 6) At Very High levels where money is really not much of a factor, would<br/>
 </span></blockquote>it<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; be even better to buy up inexpensive magic weapons (inexensive for a level<br/>
&gt; 44+) like the tenticle wips for your pet?<br/>
