<div id="ygrps-yiv-332892715">I&#39;m fairly convinced that at least some of the new spells that have been<br/>
posted are red herrings put in the spell.dat by Verant just because they<br/>
know people analyze that thing constantly.  A friend of mine also brought up<br/>
a good point.  Unless the mana given for each level is changed for post 50,<br/>
people are really going to feel a squeeze, some of the mana requirements for<br/>
those new spells are insane, and if our mana adjustment remains constant,<br/>
we&#39;ll have 20% more mana at level 60 but spells that require 100% more...I<br/>
can&#39;t wait to see how Verant figures this all out.<br/>
<br/>
On the bright side, for some of our lower level friends.  If shadowknights<br/>
are getting the 39/44 pet, they can&#39;t make those research only anymore.  It<br/>
will be interesting to see how they work out research.  Since we get spells<br/>
at each level, will the components for that level spell *only* drop off a<br/>
mob of that level?  IE: level 55 pet requires words of insanely rare, do<br/>
those only drop off level 55 mobs?  If that&#39;s the case I fear the future my<br/>
friends.</div>
