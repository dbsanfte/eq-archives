<div id="ygrps-yiv-1892327568">At lvl 20, I had one con up to even to me, they are pretty tough for regular <br/>
ghouls. Not a really big deal, just thought it notable. Killing the ghouls <br/>
that guard the Lodge of the Dead will lower your faction with the Dead won&#39;t <br/>
it?Anyone know?<br/>

&lt;&lt; Hmm.  At L16, the ghouls are all dark blue to me.  Since they seem to have<br/>
 their own faction (The Dead) which I&#39;m already KOS, and since there aren&#39;t<br/>
 many nearby guards...  I wonder if I can pull singles with numb the dead?<br/>
 Must keep the shadowstep/shadowstep/gate plan ready just in case though,<br/>
 as neither guards nor ghouls tend to fall for feign death.  Have to give<br/>
 it a try tonight.  Boy will it suck if they carry additional faction and I<br/>
 become KoS to the (now dubious) guards. &gt;&gt;</div>
