 </span></blockquote>As a dark elf necro... EXCEPT for the wizards guild (which I have always <br/>
widely avoided) I have NEVER had a problem EAST or WEST freeport.<br/>
Now binding yourself in the necro guild in West Freeport would not be a bad <br/>
idea at all.<br/>
<br/>
NORTH Freeport is a different matter.  I would not bind myself there, but I <br/>
have also not had any problems there after my reign of terror on ORCS for <br/>
nearly a month.  I have killed well over a thousand orcs...  So many orcs <br/>
that the Rivervale GUARD (not merchants) are actually amiable to me... (I am <br/>
still KOS by rivervale merchants...but I am working on that...)<br/>
