&gt; I don&#39;t have a full answer, but here&#39;s a partial anyway --<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As far as trade skills go, they all start at 0.  Even when you train<br/>
&gt; at level 50 finally, you start at 0.  The most points your guild will<br/>
&gt; train you for is the first 20 points of any particular trade skill.<br/>
&gt; (Sometimes I&#39;ve been able to squeeze in 21, but close enough)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; After that it tells you, that you must practice the skill in the real<br/>
&gt; world.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Other skills work the same way, except that after the initial 20 (again,<br/>
&gt; this number seems to vary a tad depending on the skill) but then you will<br/>
&gt; have to pay money to practice.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There are also those skills that you get because of your particular class<br/>
&gt; or race, that are given an initial &#39;boost&#39;.  This includes examples like<br/>
&gt; the necro&#39;s Hide skill.  It&#39;s initially at Below Average, meaning you&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; got a 40&#39;ish skill in it already.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Skills that you aquire, like Dodge, Dual Wield (for other classes) start<br/>
&gt; out at a higher skill value than 0.  This is diffrent for all the skills<br/>
&gt; as far as i&#39;ve been able to tell.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; when doing trades, is 25 the maximum level your guide can train ? or is<br/>
25<br/>
&gt; &gt; the maximaum skill points u can put into it?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; i heard if u are , for example level 15, and u put one skill point into<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; &gt; trade..your skill automatically become 15 as oppose to 1.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; i know it isn&#39;t a necro question but i would appreciated it if someone<br/>
can<br/>
&gt; &gt; answer it for me .<br/>
