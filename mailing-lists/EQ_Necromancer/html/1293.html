<div id="ygrps-yiv-1030181535">You should be able to get off at the dock ok since the npc that meets the<br/>
boat is indifferent to all races/classes.  If that makes you nervous though,<br/>
jump off the boat after you set sail from the bb docks just on the other<br/>
side of the wall which is a much shorter journey to unrest than jumping off<br/>
the boat before the docks.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll need to watch out for dwarf guards and you should be able to sell to<br/>
a druid that is kinda on the way to unrest if you jump off the boat after is<br/>
leaves port.  Just con the druid prior to selling.<br/>

Myself and my three troll friends are thinking of<br/>
making a trip to Unrest. However, none of us have ever<br/>
been to that continent as evil players. Could you all<br/>
please give some hints on how to get my warrior type<br/>
friends safely past bb? Also, is there anyplace there<br/>
that we can sell? Or buy food for that matter. :)<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!<br/>
