<div id="ygrps-yiv-1335034082">all i do is auction that im trading my runes and pages for words.  ive <br/>

the words, some are for mages only.<br/>

&gt;If could all of you send in a feed back in the game and also email varent.<br/>
&gt;That we would like to have something done about this shortage of words.<br/>
&gt;There should be some sort of system where if a necro is looting there is a<br/>
&gt;word, and if a wizard loots a ruin is there. Most of my friends are necro&#39;s<br/>
&gt;in the game so we are all fighting for the same words. Or heaven for bid<br/>
&gt;they might put words on vendors and just make the trade harder. I could <br/>
&gt;live<br/>
&gt;with that. If we could all put are heads together and do this as a group it<br/>
&gt;could make a difference.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also I am level 33 now and not very sure what to hunt again. hehehehe I <br/>
&gt;have<br/>
&gt;been kill druids for the past few levels. Now I am at a loss. Any one out<br/>
&gt;there have a clue at all. All I really want is my new spells.<br/>
