<div id="ygrps-yiv-1095250728">&lt;&lt; What else can I hunt solo to go from 26-29 fast ? I am now hunting the <br/>
Millers in the Hills: very good exp and loot but it is a pain in the butt to <br/>
keep their spawn apart and they rip my pet big time..... Is the new darkness <br/>
and heat blood at 29th that much better &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
   The 29th Heat Blood spell is called Blood Boil and is a great spell around <br/>
400 damage in I believe 2 min check K2&#39;s site for exact dammage (www.k2.org) <br/>
  The 29th Darkness is dooming darkness,  sorry I&#39;m not to happy about the <br/>
resist rate on this one I usually cast either clinging darkness or engulfing <br/>
darkness, when soloing it is important to get them slowed, then if you have <br/>
spare mana (right:) go ahead test the resist rate on dooming.  When it does <br/>
stick it is a nice spell is a DOT and slows them alot.<br/>
  Even at 40th lvl I still use Clinging and Engulfing this line of spells has <br/>
a high resist rate.<br/>
