<div id="ygrps-yiv-2012508027">Personally, I believe that there is no problem with not knowing a pets abilities. That adds to the mystery of it, because you never know(except through a con) quite how good the skel is. It doesn&#39;t really bother me really, cause it allows great RP situations - If it is a weakling, I will cast Reclaim Energy on it and start muttering about the weakling undead being summoned lately, and grumbling in general. Anyone else feel this way? Also, I am a Gnome Necromancer on Fennin Ro. Any suggestions as to what spells to buy at level 8? Iam right now leaning obviously to the Pet and to Gather Shadows, and if there is a new Darkness spell I may buy that. Any others?<br/>
