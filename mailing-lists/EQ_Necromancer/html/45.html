&gt; Fellow Necromancers,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As you know, the types of weapons we can use is very limited.  I&#39;m<br/>
currently trying to find a worn great staff.  A regular great staff is way<br/>
beyond my current budget.  I&#39;ve tried all the merchants in Neriak, but none<br/>
carry them.  I&#39;ve also been told the orc pawns sometimes have them, but I&#39;ve<br/>
killed at least a hundred of them, and have yet to even see one carrying a<br/>
staff.  Does anyone know of a merchant that sells worn great staffs<br/>
(preferably one that doesn&#39;t kill Dark Elves on sight) or where I can find<br/>
one?  My dagger is getting very rusty.<br/>
