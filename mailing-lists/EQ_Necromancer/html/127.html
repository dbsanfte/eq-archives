 </span></blockquote>Well I am almost to a level where I can start magical research with one of<br/>
my characters.  My necro has still a bit to go.  However, I have started<br/>
doing some advanced research by asking friends what the heck they have<br/>
started trying.<br/>
<br/>
Here are the Research books for each class<br/>
Lexicon is for Wizards<br/>
Elemental Grimwar is for Magicians<br/>
I can&#39;t remember the one for Enchanters<br/>
Book of Dark Mysteries is for the Necromancers.<br/>
<br/>
I believe you need Old Erudin to read any of these.  Possibly Elder Tir&#39;dal<br/>
as I am not sure if any race starts with this language at Excellent.  I<br/>
know Old Erudin is what the book On Languages mentions.  Also they mention<br/>
for older books that they have been written in Combine.  Not sure where to<br/>
go to learn that.  And of corse the most powerful magics are in Ancient<br/>
Dragon.  I have even less of a clue where to get these.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps when I get Research with my wizard in one level I will have more<br/>
ideas  for now try to get some skill in Old Erudin.<br/>
<br/>
If I find any one on Fenin Ro that can teach me to Excellent.  I have even<br/>
though about paying them for their time.<br/>
