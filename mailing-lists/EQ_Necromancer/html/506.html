<div id="ygrps-yiv-589593375">Just click on your pet from time to time, it&#39;ll show a target hitbar<br/>
like normal.  Its also good to have a &quot;feel&quot; for what your pet&#39;s general<br/>
hitpoints are.  Like having half hits means that your skel can probably take<br/>
X more hits froma spiderling.  It takes time but you figure it out well<br/>
enough.<br/>

&gt; How do you keep a watch on your skeleton&#39;s life? I can never <br/>
&gt; tell how close<br/>
&gt; he is to buying the farm, yet again.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt;     &#39;fraid you wont find much around Qeynos.  The best thing <br/>
&gt; for you to do<br/>
&gt; is make a trek to Freeport.  That&#39;s undead haven there, I <br/>
&gt; swear.  You&#39;ve got<br/>
&gt; numerous little ruins outside, plus Befallen (watch out for <br/>
&gt; horrible trains<br/>
&gt; & that damn Ghoul & Ice Boned) you can put that Ward Undead <br/>
&gt; to use.  Beware<br/>
&gt; of fizzles, however.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;     As for around Qeynos.. eh.. Karanas is the best place.  <br/>
&gt; Just kill the<br/>
&gt; grizzlies and spidies.  It&#39;ll take longer, but you&#39;re almost <br/>
&gt; guranteed the<br/>
&gt; experiance from them so long as you&#39;re not double timed.  <br/>
&gt; Just remember to<br/>
&gt; smack &#39;em with poisen, maybe Clinging Darkness and/or Fear, <br/>
&gt; and leave enough<br/>
&gt; mana for a Mend Bones or Gate. :-)  You&#39;re not going to get <br/>
&gt; much more around<br/>
&gt; Qeynos.  I left the place at level 10 for Freeport, got 56 <br/>
&gt; gold in three<br/>
&gt; days there, a greater light stone, two magical (Cut-Throat Insignia)<br/>
&gt; rings..... and lost level 10. *grin*  Even the Orc Centurian <br/>
&gt; around the<br/>
&gt; entrance to the city of Freeport carries leggings at times, <br/>
&gt; which you can<br/>
&gt; sell for gold.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;     Freeport is nice, but very dangerous.  Those damn young <br/>
&gt; kodiaks hate you<br/>
&gt; and will attack you on sight.  They&#39;re pretty tough at this level,<br/>
&gt; especially with a giant spider or two in tow.  Both of which <br/>
&gt; roam around the<br/>
&gt; immediate area of Freeport, one zone from the city.  Good <br/>
&gt; exp, just watch<br/>
&gt; your back.  Also, just because a zombie /con`s blue doesn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; mean it&#39;s an<br/>
&gt; easy kill.  I made it out of a fight against two of those <br/>
&gt; with a sliver of<br/>
&gt; mana and life.  Granted, I had no pet at the time, but geeze <br/>
&gt; they hurt.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;     Ghouls and the Ice Boned Skeleton takes magical weapons & <br/>
&gt; spells to hurt<br/>
&gt; it.  Your ward undead can kill it the Ice Boned if somebody else is<br/>
&gt; distracting it so you can get all of them off, but not <br/>
&gt; face-to-face as it<br/>
&gt; will stun you repeatedly.  Ward Undead on the Ghoul is a <br/>
&gt; waste of mana.<br/>
&gt; It&#39;ll resist virtually every one of them.  Don&#39;t -- Fight -- <br/>
&gt; The -- Ghoul<br/>
&gt; :-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;     Also, the desert is a great place.  The Giant Scarab <br/>
&gt; Beetles are very<br/>
&gt; easy kills -- I can sit and meditate while my skeleton beats <br/>
&gt; the snot out of<br/>
&gt; them (just remember to poisen them & keep a watch on your <br/>
&gt; skelly&#39;s life) --<br/>
&gt; and gives okay experiance.  Zombies roam the desert, as well <br/>
&gt; as skeletons.<br/>
&gt; /con _everything_ first, especially the skeletons.  Many of <br/>
&gt; them will /con<br/>
&gt; red to you.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;     Good luck.  Qeynos at level 10 is incredibly boring...<br/>

&gt; &gt; Can anyone give some recommendations about  where to go on <br/>
&gt; 10th lvl, as a<br/>
&gt; &gt; human necro in qeynos?<br/>
&gt; &gt; For the last 3 levels i&#39;ve been in west karana, and i&#39;m <br/>
&gt; looking for better<br/>
&gt; &gt; places to hunt, as the xp and the loot i get in karana<br/>
&gt; &gt; from the creatures i can handle there ( mostly giant spiders, giant<br/>
&gt; &gt; beetles,lions , the occasional grizzly ) , is quite bad.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;From the times i&#39;ve been to black burrow, it looks that <br/>
&gt; place is just<br/>
&gt; &gt; impossible, because of all of the people that hang around <br/>
&gt; there all of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; time, pulling train after train..<br/>
&gt; &gt; Is there any undead hunting site near qeynos, besides the <br/>
&gt; ruins in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; hills? I realy want to put my ward-undead to use..<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; death to all,<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Trenzorian/Tunare<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; If we aren&#39;t supposed to eat animals , why are they made of meat?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
