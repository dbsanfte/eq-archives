<div id="ygrps-yiv-1856589772">Any suggestions on what level of skill to attain before even attempting to research harmshield and word of shadow?  I am failing miserably and wasting my precious supply of words.  Along those lines, is word of shadow even worth the effort?  I dont know anyone who has it.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I made the odious journey to unrest from Neriak and have begun exploring.  Very few necromancers there at present and I have been at a loss for good hunting companions.  If any of you frequent unrest on the mithaniel marr server, give me a tell.<br/>
