<div id="ygrps-yiv-1194800763">I am a 14th level DE Necro myself.  I am currently camping in Lake Rathe and<br/>
Rathe Mountains.  I have been getting good exp and loot.  I would highly<br/>
recommend these areas if you have never been there.  Hope this helps.  If<br/>
anyone has any other ideas I would be glad to hear them also.  I am always<br/>
looking for a better and new place to hunt.<br/>
