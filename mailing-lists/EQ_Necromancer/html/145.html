<div id="ygrps-yiv-1999000065">Freeport is totally KOS to Trolls and Ogres, and Dark Elves are KOS is North<br/>
Freeport.∩┐╜ Nobody will sell to you there until you&#39;ve practically decimated<br/>
half the orc population in the Commonlands.∩┐╜ I still can&#39;t buy or sell in<br/>
Freeport and I&#39;ve collectively destroyed dozens of orc camps.<br/>
∩┐╜<br/>
∩┐╜∩┐╜∩┐╜ Do all your buying and selling in Neriak or Grobb.∩┐╜ Avoid Inns at ALL<br/>
costs, avoid most Guards too.∩┐╜ This is easily accomplished by staying on the<br/>
periphery of the zones and never going in the center for the most part.<br/>
∩┐╜<br/>
∩┐╜∩┐╜∩┐╜ Change your faction?∩┐╜ Kill orcs... many many orcs.∩┐╜ Kill high level<br/>
orcs.∩┐╜ As a matter of habit I kill any orc I see simply to improve faction.∩┐╜<br/>
But if you are less than level 8 you probably should still be in Innothule<br/>
and Neriak anyway.∩┐╜ Nektulos Forest has a decent higher newbie area south of<br/>
their one bridge.∩┐╜ Chocked full of shadow wolves, large spiders, skeletons,<br/>
and black bears, as well as the occasional young kodiak and two halfling<br/>
&quot;camps&quot;.∩┐╜ Steer clear of those.<br/>

Commons)</div>
