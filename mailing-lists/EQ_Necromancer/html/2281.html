Necro&#39;s main role seems to be as mana battery, from what I hear.<br>
Bah....when will people ever wake up and realise how good a Necro is? <br>
We&#39;re low-maintenance &#39;cause we can heal ourselves and have spells of <br>
our own that are better than the Chanter&#39;s Breeze line. We also kick <br>
arse with our DOTs and to a lesser extent our DDs (SOP is awesome, <br>
and the DD vs Undead line is cool too). And I consider the pet as <br>
half a Tank. Yet when I go into a zone LFG, there&#39;s loads of other <br>
people LFG too, yet they all seem to get groups and I don&#39;t. Once I <br>
waited 5 hours in OT for a group and didn&#39;t get one. I know Necros <br>
are apparantly so good at soloing but it does get boring and even we <br>
have to med for some time if we use all our mana. And we go down <br>
quick if we&#39;re being hit and FD doesn&#39;t work or we&#39;re oom.<br>
Ah, just pouring out what I think here. What does everyone else think?</blockquote><br>
<br>
Well lets start with the last question....<br>
<br>
I think 95% of all necros suck. They are worse than the kiting, training druids. This is why you have a problem getting a group.<br>
<br>
Most necros dont know how to control or manage aggro and I cant even begin to count how many have told me their heal spells arent worth buying. Umm other than Cheal a necro can heal better than a cleric and more mana efficiently.<br>
<br>
I probably am friends with the top necros on our server and you are 100% correct in that a good necro is an asset anywhere, unfortunately they are hard to find and eventually people quit trying.<br>
<br>
Most of them always want to fear kite, even ingroups. That drives me crazy. Hell I go to Fear and bring 4 enchanters and I have had necros charming. What the hell?<br>
<br>
I have seen more necros get over aggroed than I have wizards.<br>
<br>
Its just an overpowerful class solo so it makes it easy for nimrods to level up and not have a clue what to do in a group once they get to 45+. Its a shame too, if we had more good necros and we could do more things and not even have to look for clerics/enchanters many nights for raids.</span></blockquote></font></font></html>
