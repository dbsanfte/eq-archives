<div id="ygrps-yiv-45732396">Well wanted to first thank everyone for the useful suggestions. Boy was I <br/>
wasting my time in the commons.. spent the morning there and here&#39;s what I<br/>
found..<br/>
<br/>
I can take lower elementals with a little difficulty, but honestly, not worth<br/>
the effort. When they pack they really can hurt (ie, I died a few times).<br/>
<br/>
Drakes are easier for me, probably the best things for me to kill..<br/>
<br/>
Haven&#39;t tried the snakes, was warned to stay away from them..<br/>
<br/>
Imps, are risky, if I&#39;m at full hp/sp I can take one, usually, but barely.<br/>
Again, not worth the effort really.<br/>
<br/>
The gypsy&#39;s hate me, so I can&#39;t sell to them and have to go back to Neriak to<br/>
sell. Does anyone know if you can improve faction with them?<br/>
<br/>
There aren&#39;t many people in the zone, and they&#39;re not very friendly/chatty<br/>
(unlike people in the commons) so I had to learn a lot on my own..<br/>
<br/>
Oh and the one thing I _do_ like is there is a lot more loot here. I was<br/>
making maybe 2-5pp a day in the commons, I made that much in a few hours in<br/>
Lavastorm..<br/>
<br/>
thanks again everyone!<br/>
