<div id="ygrps-yiv-1756130779">I would also suggest going to befallen, make a pet, explore it. <br/>
 At 51 you shouldnt wory about dying just make sure your pet is at all times <br/>
behind you. Learn about pathing with pets ..... this will get you and party <br/>
killed. <br/>
Patience &lt;spelling&gt;  we are not quick kill artist learn to let Dots and pet <br/>
do damage over time.  Play with lich in newbie zone learn how fast it drains <br/>
standing and sitting practice with bond of death and pact of shadow on <br/>
newbies.  Just make sure you can work that necro before going with a group. <br/>
<br/>
oh yeah your KOS now watch everyone :)  and no castle for you. <br/>

&lt;&lt;  Hiya all, my friend just quit the game and gave me his account. It has a <br/>
51 nec, that I don&#39;t know how to play hehe. He said he might consider coming <br/>
back sometime in the future, so I want to try and get his necro to 60 by then <br/>
=) I&#39;m totally new to a necro, but I do have a 49 druid. Any tips on the <br/>
necro would be greatly appreciated. Thanks! &gt;&gt;<br/>
