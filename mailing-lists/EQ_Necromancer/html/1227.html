&gt; wtf?  i think necros have the largest percentage of broken and useless<br/>
&gt; spells of any class.  not only that, but we have a huge gap in the number<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; quests we can do, and too many items mimic our spells.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;BTW, is intensify death really broken. Feel kinda stupid casting it all<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt;  time for the last few weeks.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; then they took away charm and gave us a worthless spell (screaming<br/>
terror),<br/>
&gt; not only is it a &#39;why go to the train when you can bring the train to you&#39;<br/>
&gt; spell, but it only works indoors!  at least if it worked outdoors, when<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; wipe failed it wouldnt really be as dangerous.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; and what were they thinking when they made voice graft?  i dont think any<br/>
&gt; class has a more useless spell.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; oh well, thats my rant =)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Also had a general question about experience and which is better to do.<br/>
Is<br/>
&gt; &gt;it better to solo a yellow spawn every other time it comes up (lets say<br/>
&gt; &gt;alternating with an equal level friend) or group with your friend and<br/>
kill<br/>
&gt; &gt;each one and split the exp?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; you are better off getting 50% of two kills than 100% of one, there is<br/>
less<br/>
&gt; work involved, and more safety.  also, you get some form of grouping<br/>
bonus.<br/>
