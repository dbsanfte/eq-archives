<b>Subject:</b> Curious on 8 memorized spells for lev 16 through 23 rd level play ers ? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1732891028">Hail fellow necromancers<br/>
<br/>
I am lev 14th and already finding it hard to pick exactly which 8 spells to<br/>
keep memorized. I currently don&#39;t keep shielding and grim aura memorized,<br/>
rather I cast and delete them, then repeat later when they wear off.<br/>
<br/>
When I&#39;m in a large group that is killing fast, I tend to use the low mana<br/>
spells like siphon str and disease so I can do this to all MOBS. I like to<br/>
keep gate memorized for emergencies, my best life suck spell, my ward<br/>
undead, and my best darkness spell as it slows the MOBs down if they are<br/>
fleeing or if I need to flee. I also find dark empathy handy to emergency<br/>
heal passerby&#39;s that are dying. I make a lot of friends that way. I also<br/>
find mend bones quite handy esp when I&#39;m soloing or in a group of 2 where<br/>
the other person is a wizard or other spell type. I also like the vampiric<br/>
embrace as I can tank at the beginning of a fight longer, back out and life<br/>
drain, then tank again. That extra 25 tap 2 or 3 times some fights has made<br/>
a big difference a few times.<br/>
<br/>
So I have at lev 14 something like this memorized.<br/>
<br/>
1)Best Life Drain<br/>
2)Vampiric Embrace<br/>
3)Englufing Darkness<br/>
4)Heat Blood (or if in lavastorm or big group Disease)<br/>
5)Dark Empathy<br/>
6)Mend Bones (or if in group with tanks siphon str or posion bolt)<br/>
7)Gate<br/>
8)Ward Undead<br/>
<br/>
I wish I had slots for fear and shadow step but I don&#39;t usually.<br/>
At lev 16 I see a lot of new neat spells. A new DOT. Feign Death. A spell to<br/>
make you immune to damage for a short time ect. I am at a loss as to how to<br/>
fit all the fun spells in. I&#39;m happy in the sence there are so many cool<br/>
spells I can sorta mix and match for the situation but its much more<br/>
difficult living with 8 spells at a time then when I play my lev 17<br/>
magician. I can mem and forget all my summon spells. My combat ones are<br/>
always less then 8. IE DD, AE, Gate, Damage Shield and I&#39;m about done with<br/>
important spells.<br/>
<br/>
I was wanting advice from higher lev necromancers about what spells they<br/>
tend to load and for what situations. Esp for the lev 16 and the 20th<br/>
spells.<br/>
