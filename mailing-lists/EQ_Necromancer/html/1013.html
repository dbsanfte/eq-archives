<b>Subject:</b> Words, WHERE? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-370385162">I keep hearing on this list how common words are and that people have stacks<br/>
and stacks of them. Could someone please share where they are to be found in<br/>
such large quantities? I was told that the lava crawlers in lavastorm<br/>
occasionally have them, out of 50 or so kills I found a single rune. I was<br/>
also told crocs in Oasis have them, out of about 25 or so killed I never found<br/>
one. Someone suggested I go to Lake Rathetear but suggested it might be hard<br/>
for me at level 18.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, would someone be willing to share where they find basic words in large<br/>
quantities so I can practice my skills? Or is it simply my very bad luck to<br/>
have not found one yet (I don&#39;t even know what they look like..)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
