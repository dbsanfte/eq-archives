&gt; Well first off, you are not kos in all of freeport, i think it is just<br/>
near<br/>
&gt; the paladin and cleric guild.  I always go the nro to freeport way to get<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; boat and never have had a problem, but you can stand on the dock all day<br/>
&gt; long and no npc will bother you. DE&#39;s have a deal with the freeport<br/>
militia<br/>
&gt; that is why we can walk freely around (for the most part).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Once you get on the boat, sister island is the first stop.  I hunted there<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; lot at your level and made quite a bit of money :)  My favorite spot to<br/>
set<br/>
&gt; up on the island looks like a little tear drop coming off the island where<br/>
&gt; none of the sisters go, so I could always med or pull to this area with no<br/>
&gt; problem.  As soon as the boat turns and is lined up the edge of the island<br/>
&gt; on the right, I would jump off the boat and swim to this point and<br/>
commence<br/>
&gt; with the slaughtering.  You are kos to the people at the dock, so stay<br/>
away.<br/>

&gt; I am a lvl 13 DE necro and was wanting to make a trip to the Sister Ise in<br/>
&gt; OOT.  My question is how hard of a trip is this for a DE to make,  am I<br/>
KOS<br/>
&gt; in Freeport etc.  Also is the isle the first one that the boat stops at or<br/>
&gt; will I have to swim?  Any other advice will also be welcomed :)<br/>
