<div id="ygrps-yiv-1462589489">Hello Fellow Necros,<br/>
<br/>
      If this has been discussed in the past I apologize for this<br/>
post, but I just joined the list.<br/>
<br/>
      Anyway just checked with EQ-Casters.com and Necro.com but have<br/>
been able to find out where this DE Enchantress is in South Ro. She is<br/>
the one that is suppose to help out with the research. Read this on<br/>
the castersrelm site.<br/>
<br/>
      Has anyone found her and if so, where. Any help would be greatly<br/>
appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Best Regards,<br/>
