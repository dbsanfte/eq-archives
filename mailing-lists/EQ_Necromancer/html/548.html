<div id="ygrps-yiv-1794508572">Im not sure of the exact date that asheron&#39;s call is going to be out but I <br/>
know its not real soon. If you read the postings on various sites about the <br/>
new eq edition coming out the first quarter of next year its adding swaying <br/>
leaves(using less pixels!) and tons of other great additions including the <br/>
new continent it will be more than enough to match asheron&#39;s call.  The one <br/>
thing though that I did read about asheron&#39;s call is about discovering new <br/>
spells( kind of like research but better) and the advantages to keeping the <br/>
spells secret so there arent a lot of spoilers. That would definately add a <br/>
new angle on spell casting in eq if they added something similar to that. <br/>
