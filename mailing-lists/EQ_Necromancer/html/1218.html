<div id="ygrps-yiv-474915610">Considering heading there, and I know how to do that, but I am a Gnome<br/>
Necro and am concerned about any KOS guards or merchants  both on the way<br/>
and in the keep itself.  Any facts to share?  If I can make it to the keep,<br/>
there are merchants and a bank there as well.  Are these KOS or just<br/>
typical hi-priced vendors?  Would I be welcome group member?<br/>
