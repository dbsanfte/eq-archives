<div id="ygrps-yiv-1796553247">I stand corrected then :) let us know if you can ever get them down to<br/>
dubious.  I take it you don&#39;t ever wish to visit Neriak with your orc<br/>
killing :) I imagine the indigo brotherhood has a rather intense dislike of<br/>
you by now...<br/>

&gt; I do have to disagree with this. I started out truly KOS with the high<br/>
&gt; elves. (Full Scowl ready to Attack.) However, after killing about 380 orcs<br/>
&gt; in crush bone (I kept a tally sheet) they now are down to Glares<br/>
&gt; Threateningly. Still not where I want it to be, but it&#39;s a start.<br/>
&gt; I didn&#39;t just stay there and kill orcs all in one straight shot. What I<br/>
did<br/>
&gt; was stop off in CB when I hit 12, and killed 150 of them, then another<br/>
&gt; hundred at 14, and the rest at 16.<br/>
&gt; Just for reference sake, you get the same faction adjustment not matter if<br/>
&gt; you get credit for the kill, or even how much damage you do. (I verified<br/>
&gt; this with Dunnik on Veshaan.) So I walk around with my level one Life Tap<br/>
&gt; memorized in a spare slot, and just tap everything that people are<br/>
fighting.<br/>
&gt; (I do an OOC first and occasionally explaining what I am doing, just so<br/>
&gt; folks don&#39;t think I am kill stealing.) This allows me to hit very high<br/>
&gt; numbers of faction very very quickly.<br/>
&gt; Thanks. </span></blockquote></div>
