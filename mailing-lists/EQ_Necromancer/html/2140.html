&gt;  just kill the mob without losing people. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I guess after all the time to get to Planes level I just expected more <br/>
&quot;eewww&quot;  - &quot;ahhhhhh&quot; - &quot;wow this is too cool&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
One guy on the Druids Grove posted basically &quot;its not for fun, its not for <br/>
exps, its for farming - remember that and you are good to go&quot;. I can accept <br/>
that if that is what it is, I guess I just expected more. There is not a <br/>
single item I can think of that in the Planes for me that would make this <br/>
enjoyable. Yes, my best items are there, but I would rather not have the best <br/>
and just have fun I guess. I can get to 200 wisdom without, I just will have <br/>
to hurt other stats and I wont be the most efficient druid as far as stats go <br/>
or have the some of the things I have desired for a long time.<br/>
<br/>
We basically spent 2 hours to get organized and ported, 1 more hour inside <br/>
before first pull. Pulled to a corner for a few hours and supplied members <br/>
with a few nice items. It was just anticlimatic. I feel kind of cheated. Is <br/>
this pull to a corner it? I just don&#39;t find that fun. I felt like a bunch of <br/>
cowards zone fighting without a zone ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I guess the best analogy I can make is its like getting a notice saying YOU <br/>
MADE IT - YOU WON A MIILLION FOR MAKING IT THIS FAR! Then cashing in the <br/>
voucher and finding out it was pesos not dollars.<br/>
<br/>
I am not trying to complain I just felt like it was a huge let down and <br/>
expected to be able to come to work today and tell my bard friend and <br/>
coworker &quot;oh my god we need to get you to 46, it was a blast&quot;. I cant do that.</div>
