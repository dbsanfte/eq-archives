  Last night, I watched a level 26 necromancer with a<br/>
  pet, get wiped off of the face of Norrath by a 24th<br/>
  level ogre warrior. I have some strategies for necro<br/>
  against caster, but how do you fight a warrior? The<br/>
  necro could not get any of his spells of as the<br/>
  warrior bashed/kicked/slashed him to death. The fight<br/>
  took a while as the necro ran around without much<br/>
  effect. End result, one dead necro, ogre at half<br/>
  health. They only thing I could think of was sic pet,<br/>
  shadow step, cast darkness, then proceed.<br/>
<br/>
  I guess I have two questions:<br/>
<br/>
  What strategy do you all use for necro vs warrior<br/>
  type?<br/>
<br/>
  What strategy do you all use for necro vs caster type?<br/>
<br/>
  I am really curious to see what everyone says to this.<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks!<br/>
