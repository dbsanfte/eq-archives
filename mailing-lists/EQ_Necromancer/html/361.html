<div id="ygrps-yiv-220313830">What you probably did was hit an area it couldn&#39;t cross or they had<br/>
their attention broken by another character or were killed.  No monster ever<br/>
forgets you unless they die, you die, you zone, or some Enchanter hits it<br/>
with a MEmory Blur (actually I think that only makes the monster forget who<br/>
he&#39;s pissed off the most at).  Chances are something happened to to icebone<br/>
while you were hauling arse.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Something else is their apparent psychic connection with <br/>
&gt; the planet.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; mean, seriously, you&#39;re completely across the zone from the <br/>
&gt; thing and it<br/>
&gt; &gt; will still know where you&#39;re at, even if you&#39;re far under <br/>
&gt; ground and it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; top side _and_ all the way on the other side of the zone make its<br/>
&gt; &gt; way to you<br/>
&gt; &gt; through maze or &#39;high water&#39; and begin pounding the snot <br/>
&gt; out of you&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; If there&#39;s one thing that does need to be fixed, it is <br/>
&gt; this. You can&#39;t run<br/>
&gt; &gt; away from anyone unless you&#39;ve cast some spell that slows <br/>
&gt; your enemy down.<br/>
&gt; &gt; On top of that, they don&#39;t stop unless you zone or they&#39;re killed by<br/>
&gt; &gt; somebody. It&#39;d be nice if the game had a LOS variable for <br/>
&gt; monsters that<br/>
&gt; &gt; figured whether or not they knew where you were at any given point.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In Everfrost, my shaman character can outrun Ice Boned <br/>
&gt; Skeletons and &#39;break<br/>
&gt; their lock&#39; so they can&#39;t find/attack me. Of course, this is <br/>
&gt; easier with<br/>
&gt; SoW, but even without you can get away. OTOH, mammoths NEVER <br/>
&gt; forget you....<br/>
&gt; so maybe it depends on the creature?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sorry to apply shaman experience in the necro mailing list, <br/>
&gt; but I have more<br/>
&gt; experience in that world.<br/>
