<div id="ygrps-yiv-556258480">I agree, ever since the Monks had a sit in and Smedley showed up I have heard <br/>
at least 5 more arrangements for sit-ins.I think Smedley may have made a big <br/>
mistake in showing up himself.Now everyone thinks that that is the best way <br/>
of complaining.All the people of Everquest have done is gone from petitions, <br/>
to sit-ins.<br/>

 Ok, so a huge gnome showed up at the first organized sit in.  Now EVERYONE<br/>
 wants to have one.  Do you honestly think Smed is going to show up to hear<br/>
 ANOTHER group of whining players, regardless of whether or not their<br/>
 complaints were valid?  No, he won&#39;t.  This would encourage people to hold a<br/>
 sit in for every damn complaint they had (Monsters attacking through<br/>
 walls=Sit-in! Price for bonechips on vendors too high=Sit in!).  The more<br/>
 you use a tactic like this, the less impact it has.  Smed was wrong to even<br/>
 show up to the first one.  <br/>
 <br/>
 Your best tools for getting something changed are phone calls and mail.  Not<br/>
 Email, that&#39;s easy to just delete,  good old-fashioned U.S.P.S.. Which would<br/>
 you pay attention to more, a bunch of messages in your Inbox, or 10 50lb<br/>
 sacks of mail being dumped on your desk?  /Feedback works well to.  It takes<br/>
 effort, not drama.  I play a necro, a high level one, and I don&#39;t feel that<br/>
 this warrants a sit in anyway.  But it does need to be un-nerfed.  All a<br/>
 massive newbie death fest will do is piss off everyone that&#39;s not a necro,<br/>
 Verant included.   &gt;&gt;</div>
