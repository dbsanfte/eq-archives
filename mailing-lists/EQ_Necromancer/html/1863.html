<div id="ygrps-yiv-1412460852">Well, a little more confusion...  I am running scsi drives (u2w 7200rpm) and<br/>
i see no improvement in zoneing over my ide friends so....  Here are my<br/>
thoughts: cpu and connect speed make a difference, but also how many hops<br/>
you have to get to there servers also does.  Also I think (but not verified)<br/>
the ammont of ppl in the zone affects zone time.  I think alot of the long<br/>
zone times are on there end, and not ours, but who the hell knows, they wont<br/>
tell us shit about anything.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; to add to the confusion:<br/>
&gt; my pc is a PII 450mhz, 128MB ram, EIDE hard drive, STB Riva TNT 16mb card.<br/>
&gt; I have always had slow zoning compared to most people. usually 5 secs or<br/>
&gt; more slower.<br/>
&gt; Until last week i had a 56k dial up.<br/>
&gt; Last week i got 1megabit ADSL.<br/>
&gt; I have seen NO (ZERO) zoning time improvement. I have no idea why.<br/>
sometimes<br/>
&gt; (earlier with 56k) i would zone quickly, but very rarely.<br/>
&gt; I would LOVE to know the real cause. My thought is I/O rates of your<br/>
&gt; subsystem. SCSI would be faster tha EIDE, but i can&#39;t test that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; All I know now is that DSL is NOT making me zone fast despite that 60ms<br/>
ping<br/>
&gt; i get to quake servers and 500kb/s download rates i get..<br/>

&gt; Hey,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Question for the masses:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m level 14 and about 2 bubbs from 15. I&#39;m in green pet hell. I had<br/>
&gt; heard the 12 level pet spell, well sucked. Do I get a reprieve at 16?<br/>
&gt; Can I look forward to yellow pets again?<br/>
