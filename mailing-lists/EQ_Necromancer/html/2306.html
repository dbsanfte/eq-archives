<div id="ygrps-yiv-881968955">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I used to play a DE necro to 20 in EQ. Gave it up very long ago,<br/>
like maybe a year before Luclin came out. I&#39;d never go back.<br/>
Corpse runs? Three day camps to complete a quest? Not for me.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to 2nd what Howler said about the tanks in DAoC.<br/>
They are not the primary damage dealers. They are meant to<br/>
absorb, block, parry damage. They also get a skill called<br/>
&quot;protect&quot;, which acts as a detaunt on the person they place it<br/>
on. This keeps the Mobs smacking the guy in plate armor, and<br/>
not the caster or cleric in cloth or chain.<br/>
<br/>
Armsman in Albion do get a polearm ability which does tremendous<br/>
damage, but I don&#39;t see very many players going that route<br/>
currently.  Polearms are slow, and you give up shields to do this.<br/>
<br/>
The thief type classes in DAoC are extremely fun to play. The<br/>
Infiltrator class in Albion can do quite a bit of damage. In fact<br/>
so much so, the clerics can have a full time job keeping them<br/>
alive. I have a 45th level Armsman, and my friend plays a 49th<br/>
level Inf, so I&#39;ve seen this personally. I can also put Guard on the<br/>
Inf, and block shots on him. This has saved his butt several times.<br/>
Some Infs do spec in Dual Wield, they get several nice styles from<br/>
the skill.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t had much fun in RvR, so I&#39;m waiting for 50th to really<br/>
give it a good try.<br/>
<br/>
Another good site is www.classesofcamelot.com<br/>

&gt; Hi Stuart,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; One VERY important thing to know about warriors and tanks in DAoC. They<br/>
are<br/>
&gt; not meant to be MEGA damage dealers, they are meant to absorb/block/parry<br/>
&gt; damage.  There are other classes that are REALLY good at laying the smack<br/>
&gt; down, but at the cost of giving up some defensive capability.  Beserkers,<br/>
&gt; Mercenaries and Blademasters are REALLY good at smacking the living tar<br/>
out<br/>
&gt; of something, but they also will take more damage by default.  These<br/>
classes<br/>
&gt; are also known as dual wielding classes. While other classes like the<br/>
&gt; Nightshade, Infiltrator, Shadowblade, Ranger and Scout get a form of dual<br/>
&gt; wield, they typically do not spec in it. The exception being the<br/>
Shadowblade<br/>
&gt; (I LOVE this class after my bard)  Instead of getting dual wield,<br/>
&gt; Shadowblades get a skill called leftaxe or LA for short. Dual Wield<br/>
(Albion)<br/>
&gt; and Celtic Dual (Hibernia) work differently than LA.  Dual wield has a<br/>
&gt; chance to trigger, when it does trigger and it does hit, it hits for max<br/>
&gt; damage. With LA, it swings EVERYTIME, when it hits it does a percentage of<br/>
&gt; the max damage. So while you swing all the time when you hit its partial<br/>
&gt; damage...which is still VERY good.  Its usually only a few points off of<br/>
my<br/>
&gt; main weapon damage, because I keep it pretty high.  Midgard is the only<br/>
&gt; realm that gets LA. Shadowblades, and Beserkers get LA.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So as you can see it depends on how you wish to play.  There are other<br/>
tank<br/>
&gt; classes that you should also look at.  I really like the Midgard Thane.<br/>
The<br/>
&gt; thane gets a nice AOE DD spell that smacks big ole hammers on thy enemies,<br/>
&gt; as well as a point blank AOE instant on a 20 second timer, a single DD<br/>
&gt; instant on a 20second timer, a castable DD and a STR/CON buff.  The<br/>
weakside<br/>
&gt; is they are a bit light on the HP, but are a TON of fun to play.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You may also want to checkout a Champion in Hibernia. I have a Lurikeen<br/>
&gt; large weapon champ and he is soooooo cool. He is similar to the thane yet<br/>
&gt; different. Instead of DD he gets some nasty debuffs and a nasty DD<br/>
instant.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Basically what you may want to do is to go to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://daoc.catacombs.com">http://daoc.catacombs.com</a><br/>
and<br/>
&gt; checkout the spell lists and style lists for the classes you wish to<br/>
&gt; checkout. They also have some decent class discussion forums there. I read<br/>
&gt; them quite often.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I know this is a bit of a long winded E-mail, but there is a lot to know<br/>
&gt; about the various classes. I&#39;ve personally found something to like in<br/>
every<br/>
&gt; class as well as something not to like.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you would like to know more about a certain class and specing please<br/>
let<br/>
&gt; me know.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks<br/>
&gt; Oskar<br/>

&gt; &gt; Stuart,<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I play DAoC. I quit EQ well over a year ago.  Personally, I REALLY like<br/>
&gt; it.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I will be honest and say that I&#39;m not really fond of the dungeons that<br/>
&gt; &gt; originally came with DAoC. They were weak at best. However, the new<br/>
&gt; dungeons<br/>
&gt; &gt; in the expansion are much better and much more EQ like. I always felt<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; &gt; EQ&#39;s dungeons were fairly well designed and they only got better with<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; expansions.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; With that said, the main attraction for me is the Realm vs. Realm<br/>
combat.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Taking keeps and jacking relics is a total blast!  I have noticed that<br/>
my<br/>
&gt; &gt; friends that have tried DAoC have started on what we call the &quot;Co-op&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; server. Basically, these are like EQ style servers and are PvE<br/>
&gt; only...pretty<br/>
&gt; &gt; boring if you ask me.  Give a regular server a chance and I think you<br/>
will<br/>
&gt; &gt; like the way RvR is done. You won&#39;t have someone in your home town gank<br/>
&gt; you<br/>
&gt; &gt; or people from other realms raiding newbie areas. Its just not setup<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; &gt; way.  If you play on a PvP server its a different story.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; RvR in my book is just awesome.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; If you have any questions please feel free to ask. I will be glad to<br/>
help<br/>
&gt; &gt; you out as much as I can. DAoC isnt perfect by any stretch, but it<br/>
really<br/>
&gt; &gt; suits me and my play style.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I stopped playing my necro at 30 a long time ago. Since then I have<br/>
&gt; &gt; leveled<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; up a Druid to 53 but wishing I had a high level group character, I am<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; working on one now a low level enchanter that may not even make it to<br/>
20<br/>
&gt; &gt; but<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; who knows<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; BTW, I am also looking forward to Star Wars Galaxies, looks like alot<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; fun.<br/>
