&gt;I think this was just a normal evil eye, now I feel silly for letting this<br/>
&gt;thing push me around :(<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I did cast a vos and 2 sop&#39;s and he still was the last one standing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;He was down near the entrance to the water tunnel that you have to pass<br/>
&gt;through boards to get to from the top<br/>

&gt;Which evil eye was it?  At 29th, I could solo them with my pet.  And close<br/>
&gt;without.  They were almost always green to me, except the Lords.  They were<br/>
&gt;barely blue.  All you need to cast to kill it is your DD spell twice.  The<br/>
&gt;only thing is, they like to knock you back with their spells, effectively<br/>
&gt;interupting your spell.  If it was the King, then I&#39;m not sure.  Didn&#39;t see<br/>
&gt;him spawn while I was there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In a group of 3 I know that lvl 20&#39;s can take them out.  The only real<br/>
&gt;danger is if they concentrate on one.  They have pretty hefty DD spells,<br/>
