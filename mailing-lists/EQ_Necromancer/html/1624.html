<div id="ygrps-yiv-101547157">I think you miss understood the email when he said he would have time to<br/>
cast 2-4 Darkness spells.  Basically the mob would be ST&#39;ed and stand there<br/>
til it was damaged.  Well you cast Darkness on it, if is sticks mob free<br/>
start kiting.  If it is resisted no damage done to mob, mob still under ST.<br/>
Cast Darkness again, if sticks start kiting (since it slowed) if resisted no<br/>
damage to mob, mob still under ST.  Basically what he was saying was that<br/>
with Screaming Terror you can kite a lot easier since you can usually get up<br/>
to 4 casts of darkness (since the resist rate is so bad on that line) before<br/>
the mob will start coming for you.<br/>

&gt;&gt; I have read<br/>
&gt;&gt;  that most seem to get 2-4 DoT&#39;s before it breaks.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Just remember that this time you get to cast those spells is due to the stun <br/>
&gt;effect which verant is removing.  It will not stun, so you will break the ST <br/>
&gt;instantly if you damage it (I.E. cast a DOT on it.)<br/>
