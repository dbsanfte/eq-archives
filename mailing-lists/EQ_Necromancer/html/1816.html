<div id="ygrps-yiv-1328575892">What I did at 16-20 was just put my point into reasearch and didn&#39;t do any<br/>
research.  At 20th I put as many points as I could into it and researched my<br/>
16th level spells at 24th I maxed my skill and did the 20th level spells.<br/>
Once I hit 29th, I looked for higher levels necros, usually around the next<br/>
spell level to see if they had the spells and if I could buy them or if I<br/>
had the words, would they research them for me. I also max my research out,<br/>
so that when I had all the current spells for that level , I would try and<br/>
research them myself and give them out to younger nec&#39;s for free.  I have<br/>
heard of too many horror stories of higher level necs trying to research the<br/>
hard to find words only to fail and still have to work with a pet a spell<br/>
level or 2 below them.  When I hit 34th, I found a 39th level nec that was<br/>
willing to combine the words for my 34th level pet and they also had COB and<br/>
wave of enfeeblement.  For that I gave the nec 100PP as a donation, well<br/>
worth it to be able to use my 34th level pet and cob at 34th level.  I am<br/>
only 35th right now, but already have all the words for my 39th level<br/>
spells, so when I hit 39th, I&#39;ll find a high level nec to combine them for<br/>
me and pay them quite nicely to make my spells for me.<br/>

Hi folks,<br/>
<br/>
I am very rapidly approaching level 16 (about 2 bubbles away.....I&#39;ll get<br/>
there as soon as I get home from work today :) ), and am wondering about<br/>
Research.  I would very much like to do all or most of my own research.<br/>
However, I also play a level 22 Wiz who has NEVER been able to successfully<br/>
research ANYTHING.<br/>
<br/>
Is there any way to practice your research without having to use the actual<br/>
words that we come across?  It seems like they are pretty hard to find (my<br/>
Wizard finds runes all the time, but they are rarely the ones he needs).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;m looking for any and all advice as to the best way of raising<br/>
your research skill.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,<br/>
