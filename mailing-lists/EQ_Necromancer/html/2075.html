<div id="ygrps-yiv-2036167641">Hello all, I&#39;m making a newbie necro on  regular sever (E&#39;ci) and I need<br/>
some advice. I had a DE necro up to 5, but then i noticed everyone is a DE,<br/>
so I quit him. I&#39;m thinking of making a erudite now, but then the iksar had<br/>
to come along. Anyone tried an iksar as a necro? How are they? Well, if I<br/>
dont go with an iksar and make a erudite I would probably take my 30 points<br/>
and bring 70 agi up to 80 agi and 117 int up to 137 int. Is this smart? I<br/>
plan to twink him, so he will probably have 190+ int from the start unless i<br/>
opt for mana jewelry. Also, if I made him a erudite where would i be liked<br/>
and disliked? Thanks very much for your time, and any other tips would be<br/>
appreciated.<br/>
