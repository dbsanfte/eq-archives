<div id="ygrps-yiv-1072330571">Next quest in Neriak.<br/>
<br/>
The menial tasks quest in neriak os followed by other tasks quest.  You are told about<br/>
it once you return the full box of fire beetle eyes.  This quest includes assembling<br/>
more beetle eyes, but from beetles that are only found on Kerra Island, you only need 4<br/>
of those.  You&#39;re told that population of Kerra Isle is protective of those beetles,<br/>
also you&#39;re requested to bring a tusk of some elephant creature which roams the plains<br/>
of west of Qeynos.<br/>
<br/>
Also, there is a low-level (similar to menial tasks) quest in Freeport.  Don&#39;t remember<br/>
the details, but they are given once you hail the Necro guild master NPC underneath<br/>
freeport.  You really don&#39;t get much for it either.<br/>

&gt; I know of none in your lands.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There are two quests in Neriak<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Fire beetle eyes... which is only worth favor and experience, as the money<br/>
&gt; given is less than the value of the 10 fire beetle eyes you have to gather.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Courier Duty... have not totally figured this one out yet, it entails travel<br/>
&gt; :)<br/>
