<div id="ygrps-yiv-326156471">Adding more spell slots would completly unbalanced the game, especially at higher levels. Basically truth be told you need to learn to manage your spells if you guys can&#39;t balance them out at 12 or 16 you guys are really going to have problems at 29. You really don&#39;t need a wide variety of spells especially being a necromancer. All you really need are your lifetap line of spells and your dots and you can handle anything. Then you throw in some goodies like Feign death. I usually keep my shielding spells memorized just because I have more room. Once you hit 16 drop gate and put in feign death, truthfulluy I don&#39;t know why you would get invis memorized because once a creature has you in your targeting it doesn&#39;t matter if you go invis, they still can kill you.<br/>
