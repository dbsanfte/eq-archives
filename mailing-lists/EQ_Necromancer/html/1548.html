<b>Subject:</b> Buffing everyone on a Dragon Raid <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1756577923">When everything goes to plan, you have a cleric in every group.<br/>
When everything goes to plan, you have an adequate number of<br/>
tanks and enchanters.<br/>
<br/>
Things never go exactly as planned, and buffing sessions take<br/>
a long time when you&#39;re getting ready for a dragon.  Why? Because<br/>
you&#39;re not just getting the standard hp+ac and symbol buffs, you&#39;re<br/>
getting multiple resist buffs, clarities, etc.  All of this takes<br/>
tons of time since everyone wants to be full mana when the fight<br/>
starts.<br/>
<br/>
Ideally the pure casters will get buffed in hit points too. It just<br/>
varies from raid to raid.  I was just trying to spread an idea of<br/>
how much damage those AoE&#39;s do ;)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; No he is write you always give buffs to everybody going on dragon raids or<br/>
&gt; Plane Raids, at least that&#39;s my experience. At level 50 my DE Necro has 824<br/>
&gt; hp unfbuffed with equipment on. I can get that upt to 980 or so by myself.<br/>
&gt; If you get a cleric in your group I get up to 1500 easy. </span></blockquote></div>
