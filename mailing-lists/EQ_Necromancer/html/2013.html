  A long time ago when necromancers pets could&nbsp;whip major ass. The speed 
  delay of the weapon was used so it reduced the pet speed therefore making it 
  attack&nbsp;more often, but since the pet hit for about 50 not many weapons 
  could be given to the pet to make it hit harder next to a Exe axe. We there 
  was a BUG in Everquest (go figure), that actually made any npc unless monk 
  without a weapon in both hands unable to dual wield. To correct this instead 
  of just writing it in the code, they made Magicians pets able to wield 
  weapons. This then allowed the to dual wield. Well this was great and all but 
  this now may the Mage pets even more powerful and they needed to correct this 
  so the only thing from a weapon that adds to the pet is the damage rating and 
  only if it is better then the pets natural attack. This is stated as above you 
  would need one hell of a weapon to hit better then the pets natural attack. At 
  level 12 and beyond no weapon unless expensive will make the pet hit harder. 
  So the Long sword for your level 4 pet was better attack for him. He still is 
  as slow but he hit harder.</font></span></tt></div>

  &lt;trizzen@...&gt;<br><br>There are two types to give to pets. Weapons 
  that<br>process, and weapons that do not. If you give a pet a<br>weapons that 
  processes(dnoll hide lariat, mage<br>summoned sword), then the pet will 
  process in battle<br>and do extra damage. Any other weapon makes 
  no<br>difference what so ever. Rusty, low damage, high<br>damae, low speed, 
  high speed, it makes no difference<br>what so ever. However, with the recent 
  weapon change,<br>the pet will sometimes &quot;eat&quot; a weapon. You give it 
  a<br>weapon, and it does not show up as a graphic, and pet<br>does not double 
  hit. You need to give the pet another<br>weapon.</tt></div><br>
