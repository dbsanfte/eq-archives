<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-835172478">I would do it just in case your pet really sucks or something like that. <br/>
Plus, you can get a Glowing Wooden Crook which I think is the best 2H blunt <br/>
in the game. It also looks cool on Dark Elves which I am. I am only level 9, <br/>
but this is what I have been wanting my whole life. Even if I don&#39;t play her <br/>
anymore.</div>
