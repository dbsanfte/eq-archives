<div id="ygrps-yiv-519622256">Greetings fellow Necros and/or Necro Curios players,<br/>
<br/>
        With all of these URL&#39;s floating around, it would be a good idea to<br/>
place these in the mailing list&#39;s bookmark page.  All you do is go to the<br/>
ONEList web site &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.onelist.com">http://www.onelist.com</a>&gt; and sign in with your E-Mail<br/>
address and password.  You&#39;ll see a list of the Mailing Lists that you&#39;re<br/>
subscribed too.  In this case, click on the EQ_Necromancer list and you&#39;ll<br/>
be taken to a page with various options:<br/>
<br/>
            View Archives (Missed an old message or curious what&#39;s been said<br/>
previously?)<br/>
<br/>
            Calendar (Shows special events taking place for members of the<br/>
list or about the list that may be of interst to you/us)<br/>
<br/>
            **Bookmarks (This is what I&#39;m writing about. Go here & choose<br/>
Add a Bookmark. Enter the URL & Description.<br/>
            Click &quot;Add&quot;.)<br/>
<br/>
            Survey (If the moderator has created any surveys for the list,<br/>
it can be taken here as well as results viewed)<br/>
<br/>
            Shared Files (any files of interest to the members of this<br/>
group)<br/>
<br/>
            Member Profiles (See the profiles of the members of this Mailing<br/>
List)<br/>
<br/>
        If when finding a good URL or giving one to the list as a<br/>
recommendation, you add it here as well, this could become a _very_ useful<br/>
and resourceful Mailing List indeed.  The other areas could be very useful<br/>
things, as well.  Calandar could be good for Necro only meetings in<br/>
EverQuest, Survey perhaps could be used to vote on which Necro only (such as<br/>
those spells or quest) bugs need fixed the most then we could all each<br/>
submit a single bug report about it next time we&#39;re online, Shared Files<br/>
could be useful..um.. well I don&#39;t know.  Text files for huge spoilers?<br/>
That way members of the list who don&#39;t even want to take a chance of reading<br/>
one, wont have to.  I wouldn&#39;t use it for screen-shots, though, as those<br/>
tend to be large and I&#39;m not sure how much space is allocated to the<br/>
moderator of this list.<br/>
<br/>
        Of course, any info submitted there I think should also be submitted<br/>
to the list (_perhaps_ minus the spoilers).  It takes a couple more minutes,<br/>
but could really make the list quite useful and interactive...as well as<br/>
making it easier to keep track of the links and point newbies to the list<br/>
(not that I&#39;m not;) to all of the good and interesting Necro URL&#39;s (links).<br/>
<br/>
        Moderator could probably explain these options better, or correct me<br/>
if I&#39;m wrong on any of them.  Also, of course never ever send your password<br/>
to the list. :-)<br/>
<br/>
    Have a good one folks!,<br/>
