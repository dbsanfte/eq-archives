/pet sit down <br/>

Will make your skel collapse into a pile of bones.<br/>

&gt;Is the only way to make a pet attack to click on the pet and then say &quot;kill a large rat&quot;<br/>
&gt;because I would like to select the creature that I want him to attack and say PET KILL or PET ATTACK and that did not work.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;2) I saw some necromancer in Unrest and he had this skeleton w/ him and the skeleton would fall into a pile of bones after saying something like &quot;Taking new form master&quot;   Then later the pile of bones would float back into a full skeleton.   HOW WAS HE DOING THAT????<br/>

&gt;Thanks!  :-) </span></blockquote></div>
