<b>Subject:</b> Re: [EQ_Necromancer] Faction question <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-427240226">Might try killing the raiders in SK (Turn left off the<br/>
bridge after zoning from NK go aways, there is a camp)<br/>
or in NK (also along the shore, between 2 bridges in<br/>
NK) there is a really fast spawn rate. Drop bronze<br/>
weapons, and a GOOD *shudder* character can get the<br/>
red sashes for quest in Qeynos worth about 2 plat each<br/>
but NO DROP. Anyways, I kill them with lower level<br/>
druids becuase of Harmony and thier extreme agro.<br/>
Green to me at 16ish but still ALL run when I zap one<br/>
of them at 19, my 21 lvl character does not have this<br/>
problem although one of the magic users did agro on me<br/>
even at that lvl once.<br/>
<br/>
did I ramble? Quizikalli the umm ooo I forget.<br/>

&gt; outside Neriak. <br/>
