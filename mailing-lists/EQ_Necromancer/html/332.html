<div id="ygrps-yiv-892044810">Scowls at you, and glares at you threateningly are the two that will get you<br/>
killed.  Dubiously means they won&#39;t up and kill you, but they also won&#39;t do<br/>
business with you, and I imagine if you hung around long enough it would<br/>
eventually piss them off.  Apprehensively means they&#39;re not real sure, but<br/>
your money means more to them than their opinion of you.  Indifferent means<br/>
they just plain don&#39;t care. :)<br/>
<br/>
On a side note, I took my human necro to Faydark and Crushbone last night.<br/>
I had to gather shadows in the forest proper and getting off the boat from<br/>
freeport.  The dwarven guards and the wood elf guards did *not* look kindly<br/>
upon me.  Our party was on a quest for items that required us to kill a good<br/>
number of Crushbone Orcs, needless to say, the guards still didn&#39;t like me<br/>
very much so I&#39;ll be leaving that continent asap.<br/>
