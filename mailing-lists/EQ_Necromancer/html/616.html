<div id="ygrps-yiv-2025189155">Hello.<br/>
<br/>
If you have only just made your char and haven&#39;t gotten any levels yet, I<br/>
would suggest simply deleting your char and making an identical new one, and<br/>
going straight to your guild and giving the note.<br/>
<br/>
As a 2nd option, you could make a 2nd necro char and give the note to a<br/>
friend and then have the friend give you the note. Though I think it would<br/>
be easier and faster to go with the first option.<br/>
<br/>
Also, unlike the average race, Dark Elves like necromancers alot, so you are<br/>
very welcome in the city. This make early levels of being a necromancer<br/>
easier. However, being both a necromancer and a dark elf will not make you<br/>
popular outside of Neriak. Thus, I have elected not to go into ANY other<br/>
citys but instead hire people to do my shopping.<br/>
