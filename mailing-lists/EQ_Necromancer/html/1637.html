<div id="ygrps-yiv-2128879867">best thing you can do for GS in RM, is go over by Lake Rathe zone, and the go right from there coming from lake until you see this tower.   There is a necro NPC inside and he has a lot of undead w/ him too.    3 Necros can hold this tower @ 24th lvl, and it is fun.   Might want to have one of you charm one of the undead to assit.   Also around there is a TON of Lizardmen and Bears roaming around.    If you kill them Giant Skels and Cyclopses spawn in their place.   People are always hunting Cyclopses there (me included at 34th they are fun to solo)  once I cleared out the place holders, and meditated then when I stodd up there were 4 Giant Skeletons I could see!!! &lt;GULP&gt;<br/>
Pull them up against the wall just past the necro tower . . .  you are pretty safe there.  Just make sure not to get too close to the Necro Tower or to pull any undead from it if you are solo, cus Necro NPC -boy will run out and him and his horde of undead will put the smack down on ya.  hehe<br/>
<br/>
-Good Luck!!  may the darkside force be with you!<br/>

  I have beaten red giant skeletons at 22 in Lake Rathe (with great<br/>
  difficulty).  There aren&#39;t enough of them though, and the cyclops are a<br/>
  pain.<br/>
<br/>
  The druids can be good - again a necro can just about solo a red one (low<br/>
  red anyway), the wandering ones drop up to 5 plat and FS weapons sometimes.<br/>
  Best tactic I found was to send pet in, cast cancel magic to get rid of<br/>
  their damage shield, heart flutter followed by heat blood, the fear and<br/>
  drain (with allure on).  You will normally get dotted during the fight so<br/>
  keep your health up.<br/>

  &gt; i just have a few questions about hunting in the various zones.  i havent<br/>
  &gt; played for a while, so i just want to see if my info is still relevant...<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; a. can a 24 necro solo a giant skel (from rathe mtns)?  if not, what lvl?<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; b. ive heard there have been changes to the lvls of the unkempt druids.<br/>
  is<br/>
  &gt; it too dangerous to hunt them at L24?<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; c. is paw somewhere i should avoid for a while?<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; d. have any other areas become good to hunt?  i was at the treants, and it<br/>
  &gt; was rather boring.  i also only gained about one bubble of xp.<br/>
