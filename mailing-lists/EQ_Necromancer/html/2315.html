&gt; They have this in EQ, too, you know. It&#39;s a warrior discipline, or was it<br/>
&gt; skill, called &quot;shield&quot;, or something like that, where the tank takes<br/>

 </span></blockquote>From what I understand, and please correct me if I am wrong, but isnt the<br/>
shield &quot;discipline&quot; a fairly high level thing?  The skill you get as a tank<br/>
in DAoC you get when you become that class and if you block the shot you<br/>
block 100% of the damage. The trick is to make sure the person you are<br/>
blocking for stays pretty close. Something that may interest you to know is<br/>
that instead of always putting block on the soft target (healers, and<br/>
support classes) tanks will actually put block on to the damage dealers such<br/>
as blademasters, berserkers, and mercenaries...they also will put it on<br/>
other classes such as rangers, druids and basically anyone else who is a<br/>
weaker tank.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Basically what you are seeing here in DAoC and EQ is one learning from the<br/>
other. EQ is learning about skills and such as well as user interface from<br/>
DAoC. DAoC is learning from EQ in the way of PvE content and better dungeon<br/>
design.<br/>
