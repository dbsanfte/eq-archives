<b>Subject:</b> Stilleto of the Bloodclaw <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-93639442">Greetings!<br/>
<br/>
I just obtained a stilleto of the bloodclaw and was curious if anyone knew what the bloodclaw effect actually was.  When I hit with it i do normal piercing damage but have only seen what may be a special effect one- &quot; the Aviak Rook screams in pain&quot; after I hit but I couldnt tell what the effect was.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I am level 20 now and equiped with a gossamer robe, a skull of Jen&#39;tar, a dagger of marnek and a smattering of cloth, woven and netted armor. What is the best way to increase AC.  Go to all gossamer? or is there something better?  Im reluctant to hit Guk as it is not a dungeon tuned for pet wielding characters so any suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
