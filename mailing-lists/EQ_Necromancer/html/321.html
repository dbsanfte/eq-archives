&gt;it&#39;s interesting to note I&#39;m &quot;a prick&quot; because I don&#39;t like the game or<br/>
&gt;varant, and say so.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ok lets settle down. I didnt join this mailing list to hear fighting and<br/>
griping. Pointing out strenths and weakness of are classes. Im all for it.<br/>
Gives me some more feel for my char. The one thing I want topoint out is<br/>
that. This is a pianear game. The first of its kind. They have nothing to go<br/>
by. They are learing as they go. So as I se it. They are slowly makeing it<br/>
better. It&#39;s been around for over a year know. But you have to rember it<br/>
realy only been out a little over a mounth. Its a baby. It will only get<br/>
better. Have you ever boten a game and you liked it a little but it didnt<br/>
meet your standers. Well think how cool it is that the bugs in this game are<br/>
slowly getting fixed. Also most roll playing games. I put about 40 hours to<br/>
60 in them and they are done. God we havent even scratched the thing to<br/>
come. So use the # one vertue... we all know what that is, and wait.</div>
