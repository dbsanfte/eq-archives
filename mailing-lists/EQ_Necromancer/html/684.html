<div id="ygrps-yiv-501115641">i was at L10 for quite a while myself.  i finally busted thru by spending <br/>
alot of time in innothule hunting giant water moccasins.  they are alot <br/>
easier than darkweed snakes, and (i think) yield more experience.  but it <br/>
doesnt matter if they do, because you can kill more mocs in an hour than you <br/>
can dkweeds.  also, i killed a few dervishes in south ro to get me over to <br/>
L11.  i gained the level over the course of around 5 hours on saturday, and <br/>
i was at L10 for about 3 weeks.<br/>
i was becoming quite the expert =).  actually, i lost a body in befallen and <br/>
couldnt get a reply for over a week. my body was, of course, gone by then, <br/>
but fortunately i assumed that would happen to me after waiting for over an <br/>
hour and a half.  it hurt, but oh well. i still need to replace my damn <br/>
large sewing kit.<br/>

&gt;I&#39;ve been stuck at level 10 for a week now! Its not as bad as the hellish <br/>
&gt;level 7 (I was there for 16 days) but it is still bad! I tried Lrodd.... I <br/>
&gt;am NOT doing that again. I beat him ONE TIME out of the several times I <br/>
&gt;fought him, and for that one time I lost a pet with a twohanded sword, had <br/>
&gt;no mana, and was at less than a bar of health. For all this, I got SO <br/>
&gt;LITTLE XP THE BAR DIDN&quot;T CHANGE! And this was solo without a pet! The other <br/>
&gt;times Lrodd just kicked my ass.  I&#39;ve tried WC but Kodies jump me and kill <br/>
&gt;me while I fight YKs. I&#39;ve tried Kithicor, but the Ghouls jump me and kill <br/>
&gt;me. I&#39;ve tried Nro and the xp is sooo bad there. Guk is a joke. Either too <br/>
&gt;hard or too easy. Innothule is worse, its ALL green there. The orc camps <br/>
&gt;are worthless. I can&#39;t find a group to hunt with, so the Dervishes are out. <br/>
&gt;  EC I tried (again) and while fighting a lion a Cent jumped me. I ran past <br/>
&gt;4 people macroing &quot;HELP ME!! HELP ME!!&quot; and they did nothing. The cent got <br/>
&gt;me. I went back out, fought a blue lion, and an even one came up and <br/>
&gt;attacked my pet. I gated away and logged, utterly frustrated at having lost <br/>
&gt;a bar and a half of xp in two days. If I keep up like this, I am going to <br/>
&gt;be level 9 AGAIN. Please, someone help me! Where can I hunt solo w/pet at <br/>
&gt;level 10?!<br/>
