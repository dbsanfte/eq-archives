 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re tolerated in Freeport, Ak&#39;Anon (your home town), and Neriak, though<br/>
not all merchants will sell to you, and there are sometimes a few people<br/>
to stay away from.  You start out KoS to the guards in Grobb and Oggok<br/>
(which have shadowknight guilds you could buy spells at if they didn&#39;t<br/>
kill you).  Not sure about Qeynos or Erudin, both of which have necro<br/>
guilds.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, as a Gnecro myself, Neriak has been the easist place for me to<br/>
buy those spells shared with another class that aren&#39;t available at the<br/>
Freeport necro guild (shielding, gate, bind affinity, cancel magic, cure<br/>
disease, etc). Most other cities, you won&#39;t be allowed in the non-necro<br/>
magic or cleric guild, but they&#39;re indifferent in Neriak.  Oddly, the<br/>
necro guild has some indifferent and a lot of dubious (won&#39;t sell)<br/>
merchants.<br/>

&gt; Gate (invis to ghouls) and be able to buy SOME spells there from some<br/>
&gt; merchants. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yup.  Most merchants (including the bank) outside of the necro guild are<br/>
indifferent to you, and guards are dubious. Invis to undead to pass the<br/>
ghouls, and buy from about half of the necro vendors.<br/>

http://users.net1inc.net/mr_boffo/faction.htm has some info on raising<br/>
various factions, and AllaKhazam (http://everquest.allakhazam.com) has a<br/>
faction section that&#39;s mostly complete.<br/>
