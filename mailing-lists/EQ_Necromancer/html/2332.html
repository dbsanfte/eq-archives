&gt; Any recommendations on where to put my specialization points into? <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve put some in axe at the beginning just to get through the lvl&#39;s until 5<br/>
&gt; but now I have the hand to hand skill I dont really need the points in axe,<br/>
&gt; any advice from anyone would be great.<br/>

EQ Necromancers, that being the name of the group and the reason I joined...<br/>
<br/>
Ya know, I&#39;ve found I&#39;m able to solo red plaguebone skeletons in the city of<br/>
undead in the Dreadlands, thanks to the spells I just got at 29.<br/>
<br/>
The real pain is finding the research-only spells up to this level, since<br/>
nobody seems to think them worth selling in Bazaar.<br/>
<br/>
I still don&#39;t have Hungry Earth, which would probably dramatically improve my<br/>
soloing of red undead even now, letting me root them.<br/>
