&gt;I would have to say that the new patch has made me adjust the style that I<br/>
&gt;use when fighting mobs. Now that I have adopted the root and dot, dot, dot,<br/>
&gt;and sometimes dot technique, I realize that I could have easily done it <br/>
&gt;that<br/>
&gt;way before. Now the patch helps even more by giving me extra damage when <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;mob is rooted. I would have to say that the mob gets to me a lot easier <br/>
&gt;with<br/>
&gt;this technique, but manageable with good tactics.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My one BIG rant is what they have done to the Darkness line of spells<br/>
&gt;because of the patch. The whole spell line is rendered useless for damage<br/>
&gt;now because root wipes it out. They really need to figure out a way to make<br/>
&gt;darkness stick even when a root is cast on the mob.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ok, one more rant to finish it off, what they have done to ignite bones is<br/>
&gt;ridiculous. It is a horrible DD to begin with, now they remove the <br/>
&gt;root-like<br/>
&gt;effect and make it even worse, AARGH!<br/>
