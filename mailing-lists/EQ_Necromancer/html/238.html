<div id="ygrps-yiv-1597539951"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Prolly a higher level pet<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Perhaps, I&#39;m only level 12 though, and just made that recently, my 3rd<br/>
circle pet (8th level) did the same, can&#39;t remember if my 2nd circle did it<br/>
or not, I was rarely meditating much at that level anyway, mostly melee.</div>
