<div id="ygrps-yiv-1038483718"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;thats funny.  i dont get a white con, but black is in the order of where you<br/>

Most people that play, use the full screen mode...  If your in the windowed<br/>
mode, the text shows up as black, in full screen, it shows up as white.<br/>
<br/>
There could be a difference between Glide and D3D...  Not sure.</div>
