 </span></blockquote>Hello.<br/>
<br/>
I have both a lev 18th magician and lev 19th necromancer so I too have been<br/>
searching for good places to hunt for our level.<br/>
<br/>
So far I can see to major approaches.<br/>
<br/>
1.) Horde then kill or reverse. With this strategy, (which I don&#39;t like) you<br/>
kill EASY stuff with good loot to get your spell money while leveling off<br/>
great exp stuff whith no loot. I was able to get 45 platinums fighting in<br/>
Lavastorm going from lev 16-18th. The experience was slowing down but there<br/>
were still a lot of risky blues that I was able to find and money was good.<br/>
I now have enough I could fight lootless monsters until I reach 20th buy my<br/>
spells and repeat. Also you can make money fairly fast killing darkweed<br/>
snakes in east commons and selling the fangs. A good lev 16 spell pet and<br/>
solo a darkweed and only lose 15% or so of its health. So you can kill them<br/>
at will and most players are not hunting them so they are all over.<br/>
<br/>
2.) Find stuff that is good exp and good loot that is not over camped. I<br/>
have found east karana to be such a place.<br/>
<br/>
Monsters in east karana.<br/>
Cyclops, griffons, Broon, Droon, and Proon. (RUN FROM THESE).<br/>
Evil Eye and Crag Spiders - Will prob be yellow - red to a lev 17. Not sure<br/>
evil eye loot but spiders have silk for a few gold each. Get up to 4 silk on<br/>
1 spider.<br/>
Griffawns - These will by white and have a few gold feather on them often.<br/>
gorge hounds, spirt wolves, undead revears, gnoll revears, spirt wolves,<br/>
somekinda stalker (looks like wolf) These should all be risky blue to white.<br/>
The gnoll revears often have 4 gold and a piece of raw-hide armor that<br/>
averages about 6 gold. So you can easily get 1 plat off a good gnoll revear.<br/>
At lev 18 I could solo anything but the evil eyes and crag spiders with no<br/>
kiting. Though lots of this stuff groups so you do much better with 1<br/>
partner or 2.<br/>
<br/>
But I earned another 20 plats or going from 18th - 19th there over the last<br/>
3 nights. Since I now have over 60plats for my next level spells I will<br/>
probably go to south karana with a friend or 2 and kill stuff that gives<br/>
good exp and no loot.<br/>
The only big problem you will have is that you will not be able to sell in<br/>
east karana. You will need to get a friend to do it for you. Or you can go<br/>
to BB or Paw and spend about 6-8 hrs I hear to get your faction up with the<br/>
karana&#39;s residents.<br/>
<br/>
I play in the evenings lots and always welcome the company of a fellow<br/>
necromancer. So if you see me on, and want to group, let me know as I find<br/>
soloing to be somewhat boring.<br/>
<br/>
