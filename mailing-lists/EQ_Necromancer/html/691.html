<b>Subject:</b> mend bones and lesser sheilding <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-326516988">Mend bones, never used it I have it in book, but Im 22 and never used it.  <br/>
Even when I was soloing the aviaks when they were red to me, this might be <br/>
because I always cast untill I get my best pet though,  remember bones and <br/>
mana are free your life isn&#39;t a good pet makes a difference. Bah! he is my <br/>
pet I aint wasting no mana on him during a fight and my style of play is <br/>
usualy to jump in and go some melee to so he doesnt take all the much damage. <br/>
  I&#39;m now 22 and been playing in unrest were I cant go melee to well, they <br/>
hit to hard, but your always in a group so again pet doesnt get hit to much.  <br/>
<br/>
    My Dark Brother Im surprized you didnt guess this one you had to have <br/>
bought gate in the clerics guild.  Check near the bank in mage guild, first <br/>
guy on the right he has are sheild line of spells.   Remeber unlike weaker <br/>
races in Neriak we are royalty and they would not dare strike you.  Walk in <br/>
there and demand that it be sold to you,  hehehe bring money. <br/>
