<div id="ygrps-yiv-156944130">Dont even think of it if you are kos to the guards. Guilds are a little worse then guards. If you are  looked at even apprehensively by the guards dont enter a guild in that city unless its your own. They will kill you on sight!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>

    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just wondering on how bad the boat ride would be for my Level 12 Necromance..I have to deliver some mail to the Bard guild in Freeport(KOS there for me?) Just wondering if i have to gather shadows the entire trip to avoid being KOS or are the boat gaurds pretty friendly and won&#39;t KOS me? Also has anybody found any robes better than the intial one you get from your guildmaster? Also any suggestions on hunting grounds for a level 12 necro beside Crushbone....<br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Appreciate any input<br/>
