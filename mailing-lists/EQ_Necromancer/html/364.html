<div id="ygrps-yiv-1282365333">True, but I think I&#39;ll kind of go with your idea and say...not all<br/>
player classes can keep track of the creatures, so why can all of the<br/>
creatures keep track of the players?  My Necro certainly doesn&#39;t know where<br/>
that creature went, he just knows.. he smacked it with a spell and suddenly<br/>
it ducked behind a wall. Is it coming around from behind? Or maybe it&#39;s<br/>
rushing at him through the shadows..  certainly, if the creature took off<br/>
running to the other side of the zone, I&#39;d have to do some serious looking<br/>
to find it.<br/>
<br/>
    So, I think it&#39;d be a good idea to only have certain creatures have the<br/>
ability to track their opponent.  Or like it was said, give them a certain<br/>
time limit that they follow/track a player.  It&#39;s just plain silly that the<br/>
thing knows, from several miles away, that you just sat down and now you&#39;re<br/>
an easy target..<br/>

&gt; regardless of if they actually passed by there or not.  If the monsters<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t know where everything was it would lead to a lot of AI problems and<br/>
&gt; issues.  AI just isn&#39;t that good yet in games.  I think Verant has done an<br/>
&gt; alright job so far.  There&#39;s obvious bugs, but at least monsters help each<br/>
&gt; other out, cast spells right, and do a myriad of other things.  In just<br/>
&gt; about every other game the computer ALWAYS has a complete knowledge base<br/>

&gt; Those of you who played Red Alert saw this alot when your secret assault<br/>
&gt; force of tanks that were going to flank the base while the AI opponent<br/>
&gt; attacked yours was suddenly attacked BY the enemy force.<br/>
&gt; Again, if I had to choose between more realism and more gameplay, I<br/>
&gt; would always choose more gameplay.  You want realism?  Go play Close<br/>
