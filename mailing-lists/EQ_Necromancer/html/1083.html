<div id="ygrps-yiv-2050490629">So tonight, I was in Qeynos hills, killing the Millers for some XP, and half<br/>
hoping that Varsoon would spawn (I&#39;d really love to get a glowing black<br/>
stone) Well late into the evening, some newbie shouts &quot;What level is<br/>
Varsoon?&quot;  My ears twitch...could it be?  I ran to the ruins and sure<br/>
enough..there is Varsoon and his pet.  I con him, blue...I can taste the +9<br/>
intelligence already.  I begin the fight!  Varsoon fought well, but went<br/>
down easily with half of my mana, I turn my attentions to his pet, and<br/>
already Undying Varsoon has appeared (a level 30 necromancer<br/>
zombie...scary!)  My pet turns to Undying Varsoon in an attempt to get him<br/>
off me, and succeeds for a while, until UDV (for brevity&#39;s sake) casts<br/>
screaming terror on him.  My pet bolts and leaves me to deal with the fiend.<br/>
Luckily, living varsoon&#39;s pet has perished and I turn my full wrath on the<br/>
undead beast.  I hit him with Dooming Darknes, and  Boil blood, both stuck<br/>
(thank goodness) but he resisted my shock of poison! oh no! out of mana.<br/>
BUT! Here comes my pet to save the day!!! (or so I think)  The pet starts<br/>
beating on the zombie and I run a bit to let the DOT&#39;s do their work.  Soon<br/>
UDV is in his death throes...but what is this?!  No experience and No<br/>
corpse.  Thus, no glowing black stone.  I was one unhappy necromancer.  This<br/>
had happened to me earlier while fighting that enchanter on the docks of the<br/>
hills.  He had charmed my pet and when the charm wore off, poor gabantik was<br/>
a mere mob.  A friendly one, but still a mob.  None of my commands would<br/>
work on him.  but he still felt a need to protect me and so, he fought well,<br/>
and won the fight.  And as we all know, when a mob takes your kill. there&#39;s<br/>
no corpse.<br/>
<br/>
The moral of my sad story (which I guess is more of a vent of my<br/>
frustrations, thanks if you&#39;re still reading my long winded report)  If your<br/>
pet in any way loses control of himself, whether it be fear, screaming<br/>
terror, beguile undead, charm...you might as well kiss any loot from said<br/>
mob good bye.  And be prepared to cast another pet.  Because this one won&#39;t<br/>
go away, and you&#39;ll need the help in killing him.<br/>
