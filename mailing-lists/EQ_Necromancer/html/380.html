<div id="ygrps-yiv-69544928">I&#39;ve been considering starting a Necromancer on the PVP server, but I<br/>
wasn&#39;t aware we couldn&#39;t use our DoT spells.  Is it this way for every<br/>
class?  I&#39;m sure the Necromancer isn&#39;t the only one that can Poisen, after<br/>
all.  ....... or is it?  That&#39;d be odd.<br/>
<br/>
    After the discussion on Int and finding out how low my char&#39;s 90 Int<br/>
really is, I&#39;m seriously thinking about starting over, anyway.  Perhaps<br/>
it&#39;ll be on the PVP server and I&#39;ll see how it goes.  Not sure yet, though,<br/>
as what I&#39;ll do.<br/>
<br/>
    That&#39;s odd, how they wouldn&#39;t allow a DoT Spell, such as Poisen, to<br/>
effect the player victem in PVP.  Heck, I&#39;d even allow the rooting<br/>
underwater, as that could easily be worked into role-play, but, I totally<br/>
understand a limitation on that.  Snerts would take advantage of that a bit<br/>
too much.;)<br/>
<br/>
    I wonder just how a Necro defends theirself in PVP?<br/>
