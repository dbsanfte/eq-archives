<div id="ygrps-yiv-473897740">Actually. Pets do not get the full experi9ence as another party member. They<br/>
get less. So it isn&#39;t necessarily a full chunk of experience.  Also,<br/>
concerning fighting at level 16. I am level 16 and well my pet does approx.<br/>
20 damager per hit and bashes quite frequently and gets a kick in now and<br/>
then. He also has double attack. It wouldn&#39;t surprise me if he can dual<br/>
wield, I haven&#39;t tried. But I have seen skel&#39;s with dual wield around. For<br/>
my 17th level, for my work on it I have been fighting aqua goblins and<br/>
undertow skeletons in Dagnor&#39;s Cauldron. You have to be careful of the tidal<br/>
lords, but that is about it. Also once you kill your one or two goblins you<br/>
should go and rest way against the all. Also becareful swimming in the<br/>
cauldron, as in don&#39;t go too deep. The Entrance to KEdge Keep is down there<br/>
and it is guarded by 2 level 31 swordfish. I have had better success in the<br/>
cauldron then in unrest. In unrest there are either way hard stuff, like<br/>
carrion ghouls or there are the easy things like Tormented Dead and<br/>
Jack-o-lanterns.  Nothing that is either yellow or even. Though occasionally<br/>
a ghoul will be or a dark boned skeleton. Those are usually in groups with<br/>
red stuff which isn&#39;t necessarily cool. I plan on soloing to at least level<br/>
20. From then on I was wondering if anyone can give me tips on how and where<br/>
to solo? OR is grouping more viable? Thank you. Oh. A nice tip that I am<br/>
sure everyone knows. Always lure with either heart flutter or engulfing<br/>
darkness line spell. That way it goes slower and you can usually get 2<br/>
enchantments off. ALSO, it is already slowed down. Which is very helpful.<br/>
Wellgood luck. May pestilence and disease rot your bones, oh and have a nice<br/>
day. :)<br/>

&gt; Yea pets eat up alotta fame<br/>
&gt; just like a warrior of the same level would<br/>
&gt; a good tactics is reclaim the pet&#39;s energy when the creature is few hits<br/>
&gt; away from death<br/>

&gt; &gt;I&#39;m brand new to the Necro way of life (way of death?).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;If you give a pet a shield and it dies, does the shield disappear?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;(I just last night got 4th level and hopefully a semi-decent pet).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Is it true that pets get a full share of experience, as if they&#39;re a<br/>
party<br/>
&gt; &gt;member?<br/>
