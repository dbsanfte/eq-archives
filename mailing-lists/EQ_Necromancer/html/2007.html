<b>Subject:</b> Level 24 Pet, and related questions <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-877183734">Hi folks,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a sliver from level 24 and have a couple of questions about the new<br/>
spell circle.<br/>
<br/>
First off, what level of pet is it possible to summon with the level 24 pet<br/>
spell (Haunting Corpse).  Reason I ask is this:  last night I&#39;m camping<br/>
Ratraz in Neriak.  I summon my top pet, which hits for a max of 22.  My<br/>
friend dings into level 24 and summons his new, sexy :), dark-boned<br/>
skeleton.  It conned a higher blue to me than my top pet......but it never<br/>
hit for more than 22!  What gives?  Did he just happen to summon a sucky<br/>
one?<br/>
<br/>
Next question, deals with weapons for pets.  I know that recently our pets<br/>
were nerfed in this department.  I know we have to give our level 29 pets 2<br/>
weapons in order to duel wield.  What type of weapons do you recommend?<br/>
And, should I NOT give my level 24 pet a weapon?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,<br/>
