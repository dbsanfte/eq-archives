&gt; &gt; You might say that because humans get a 20-30% bonus to their<br/>
&gt; &gt; experience and they level faster... well, that&#39;s great, except that at<br/>
&gt; later<br/>
&gt; &gt; levels you are hurting yourself when you approach the level limit.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; haven&#39;t even touched Gnomes yet, and there&#39;s no way to calculate the bonus<br/>
&gt; &gt; that having Ultravision fulltime is, as well as several other things<br/>
&gt; &gt; (location, locality, faction)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ultravision is pretty much negated at level 8, deadeye is the coolest spell<br/>
&gt; in my arsenal, all my human character friends are quite envious of that one<br/>
&gt; :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; On an unrelated note, there seems to be enough of us on this list to make a<br/>
&gt; pretty well stocked irc channel, is anyone interested in starting one?<br/>
&gt; Putting up with public EQ chans isn&#39;t exactly my idea of fun, but realtime<br/>
&gt; necro chat would be quite interesting I&#39;m sure, plus just being able to get<br/>
&gt; to know one another.<br/>
