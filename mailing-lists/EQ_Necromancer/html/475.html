<div id="ygrps-yiv-1094087652">So I have a problem,  every pet I have summoned has been L1!  I made it to<br/>
level 2 yesterday and I summoned 13 skeletons thus far and every single one<br/>
was L1 (coned black while I was 1 and blue while I was 2)<br/>
I read several places that at low lvls we should be able to summon a pet<br/>
that could be above our lvl, I&#39;d be happy w/ a Skel that WAS my lvl.<br/>
<br/>
Does it matter what type of bone chips are used to summon????</div>
