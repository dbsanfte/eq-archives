<div id="ygrps-yiv-1047088599">I bought 2 +3 int earrings last night for 35pp a piece...not sure if that<br/>
was the going rate or if I got ripped off, don&#39;t really care either :)<br/>
brings my intelligence to a grand total of 156 from 134, it&#39;s nice to see<br/>
the difference in mana when I equip all my stuff now. (one of the few neat<br/>
things about dying)<br/>

&gt; ya, i guess we forgot to mention that everything in lavastorm will resist<br/>
&gt; heat blood =)<br/>
&gt; as far as lifedraw, i always make the top 3 spells my new pet spell, new<br/>
&gt; ward spell, and new lifetap spell.  damn i love that lifedraw!  it was<br/>
worth<br/>
&gt; turning L12 just for that.  and it is more mana efficient than lifespike,<br/>
&gt; but its a bigger chunk.  at L15 it doesnt really hurt the mana tho.<br/>
&gt; btw, are there any +int earings, or just the aged ones from before they<br/>
&gt; changed jewelcraft?  and what are they worth around? </span></blockquote></div>
