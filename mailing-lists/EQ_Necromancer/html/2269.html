<b>Subject:</b> Re: Should pets be given weapons above level 20? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1168785296">I would also like to point out that starting at lvl 39 pets will <br/>
automatically dual weild so you don&#39;t have to give them weapons for <br/>
this.  Basically, giving your pets weapons after 39 is wasting cash <br/>
and weight.  However, there are certain circumstances where a weapon <br/>
is very beneficial.  Procing weapons can add a bit to the damage your <br/>
pet produces.  My favorite is the vellium weapons dropped by giants, <br/>
dwarves and such in velious.  Since delay doesn&#39;t matter and after <br/>
about lvl 16 dmg is irrelevant you equip your pet for effect on the <br/>
proc.  If you are hunting in nejena or the hole get a couple of <br/>
swords from your friendly mage as the ward summoned proc is a nice <br/>
little bit of additional damage (about 41pts).<br/>
<br/>
The thing is, at least for necro&#39;s, your pet is very effective <br/>
without a weapon. So why waste the time, energy and cash on getting <br/>
it weapons?<br/>
<br/>
From levels 1 through 12 it&#39;s a good thing to get the biggest meanest <br/>
2 hander you can loot.  This can dramatically increase your pets <br/>
damage output.  At 16 you really need the high end 2handers like fine <br/>
steel to even get a marginal improvement in damage.  <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Weapons DO affect damage if the weapon is higher than base damage.  <br/>
This<br/>
&gt; is only possible at low levels (8 and lower normally, up to L12 for <br/>
rusty<br/>
&gt; 2H swords, I believe FS 2H helps L16 pets a small amount).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Magic weapons allow pets below L10 (i.e. spell levels 4 and 8) to <br/>
hit<br/>
&gt; magic-only critters.  Level 8 necros can hunt wisps with mage-<br/>
summoned<br/>
&gt; daggers.  All pets above L10 can hit magic regardless of weapon.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Delay, as you say, no longer matters ever.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Double attack doesn&#39;t need weapons.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Dual Wield starts with the L29 pet spell, and requires you to give <br/>
your<br/>
&gt; pet 2 1H weapons to enable your pet to Dual Wield.  It will then <br/>
BOTH dual<br/>
&gt; wield and double attack, so you&#39;ll see occasional triple hits.<br/>
