<br/>
I was in all three BETAs for EQOA. I think if you are comming from the PC<br/>
version of EQ, even if its been a while since you last played, that you will<br/>
probably be a little disappointed.  The graphics are ok, but the game play<br/>
mechanics were just not my cup of tea.<br/>
<br/>
Then again, I&#39;m sure they&#39;ve made huge strides since I last played the PS2<br/>
BETA, so its probably worth it to try it out for yourself and make your own<br/>
conclusions.<br/>
<br/>
I know its not much info, but its really all I have. I hope this helped you<br/>
in some way. :-)<br/>
