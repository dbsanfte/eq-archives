<div id="ygrps-yiv-1266277019">Dark Pact is a level 8 spell that takes from your life and gives to your<br/>
mana over a certain period of time.  It&#39;s very useful, especially for<br/>
meditating when you have very low Mana.  It speeds the process up<br/>
dramatically.  Just don&#39;t let it drain your life too far.<br/>
<br/>
    Also, as somebody else here stated, using it for an almost constant<br/>
correctly-timed LifeTaps is most amusing. :-)  But, be careful, you can also<br/>
tick the creature off enough to where it&#39;ll frenzy you.<br/>

&gt; I cannot find Dark Pact on my spell list (EQ&#39;Lizer Spell Guide).  Am I<br/>
&gt; missing it??  Is it a lvl 8 spell?  Thanks for any information.<br/>

&gt; &gt;personally, i feel there are two reasons for becoming lvl 8, and that is<br/>
&gt; &gt;ward undead and bone walk.  there are a lot of other really food spells,<br/>
&gt; but<br/>
&gt; &gt;those should be your first two (and ward is so cheap there really is no<br/>
&gt; &gt;excuse for not getting it soon).  imagine turning L8 and automatically<br/>
&gt; being<br/>
&gt; &gt;able to do 38 damage to undead!  per casting!  bear in mind, tho, that<br/>
this<br/>
&gt; &gt;is the necro&#39;s first evocation spell.  i camped out at a ruin in nektulos<br/>
&gt; &gt;and just casted it on everything that showed up, even if it wasnt my kill<br/>
&gt; &gt;(one hit wont steal the kill), just to cap out my evocation.  once you<br/>
have<br/>
&gt; &gt;it capped you can easily take 2-3 skeletons with your pet, and ive even<br/>
&gt; &gt;easily solo&#39;d two skels w/o a pet, just from having that spell.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;another spell that i have found is under-used by our class is Dark Pact.<br/>
i<br/>
&gt; &gt;cannot go on about how useful this spell is.  ok- seems simple... it<br/>
takes<br/>
&gt; &gt;your hp and gives you mana.  but now imagine this- you have just spent<br/>
all<br/>
&gt; &gt;your mana, and are safe (and at full hp, or close).  so just find a safe<br/>
&gt; &gt;spot, cast Dk Pact, and hide/gather shadows-  you&#39;ll be back to full mana<br/>
&gt; &gt;faster than any other spell caster class.<br/>
&gt; &gt;how about this- you are in a group or hunting with your pet.  you are<br/>
&gt; &gt;fighting a pretty tough monster, if you cast this at the beginning of the<br/>
&gt; &gt;battle you will have extra mana to cast longer (im sure there are times<br/>
we<br/>
&gt; &gt;all wished we had more mana- now you can).  be careful not to get too<br/>
wild<br/>
&gt; &gt;with the dark empathy if you are in a group, and if you get poisoned,<br/>
good<br/>
&gt; &gt;luck to you.  but nobody ever said death magic was easy =)<br/>
