<div id="ygrps-yiv-1940009533">I think you are seriously over estimating the threat level of Spectres.  It<br/>
is very easy to get our dots stuck to them.  You would have a problem using<br/>
a dd at 32nd level, but, you won&#39;t have too much trouble with blood boil,<br/>
engulfing darkness, vamp curse, repeat.  Doesn&#39;t everyone else go around<br/>
trying to see what red mob they can still kill?  :)<br/>

&gt; The specs can go as high as lvl. 37, so I can only guess that the feerott<br/>
&gt; specs were not as high a level when you were soloing them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Otherwise, I can&#39;t imagine how you could get any spells to stick on a mob<br/>
