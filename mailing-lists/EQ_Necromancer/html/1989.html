<div id="ygrps-yiv-301335530">OK This is to fathom out wisdom and advice from those<br/>
far wiser and MUCH higher level then I.  I am recently<br/>
graduated from Necro High School and have begun to<br/>
venture out into the real world.  Almost all advice<br/>
and things I ought to know would be helpfull. Have<br/>
never even gone over the bridge yet, and I party<br/>
almost exsclusively with my buddy who also is a Necro<br/>
of same level. As of yet we have kill Shintar twice,<br/>
eheheheh that was fun :-), whooped a lot of skells in<br/>
Paineel and gotten the free one handed bash from the<br/>
runnaway pet, killed the tratior that wants to fish.<br/>
Only did that once though, tough fight at level 5 for<br/>
the 2 of us.  My buddy beat me to the loot, and then<br/>
got the 2 handed bash with the plus 1 int, which is<br/>
NOT magic. I intend to kill him soon for the free<br/>
fishing pole :-).  Killed a lot of Kobolds and turned<br/>
in the cloth hats to the 2 mining skells in the tunnel<br/>
to Paineel, and sold the paws for a plat for 4.  But<br/>
the horizon is calling out my name. O where to go,<br/>
what to do.  What say ye to be that of best advantage<br/>
to a Necro such as myself.<br/>
