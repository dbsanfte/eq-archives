<div id="ygrps-yiv-1749218696">I actually don&#39;t think ST is CHR based. I know it&#39;s a mez, but it&#39;s also a <br/>
fear. My chr is around 48 and I rarely get resisted on screaming terror by <br/>
blues and evens, and it usually lasts for 20 to 30 seconds. I think since it <br/>
is a fear spell as well, it is basedsoley on magic resistance. Granted this <br/>
is just my opinion, but with a 48 Chr I wouldn&#39;t thank I have my about <br/>
90-95% success rate if it was CHR based.<br/>

&gt;Hi Y&#39;all !<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Just thought  I&#39;d show you how I Solo with ST . =)<br/>
&gt;Try to raise your charisma to a decent level to get a better success<br/>
&gt;rate<br/>
&gt;and more consistant mez timing .<br/>
&gt;We all know that damage will break ST (once they fix the random stun bug<br/>
&gt;anyway)<br/>
&gt;But did u know that ST is still an amazing solo/kiting spell ?<br/>
&gt;Here&#39;s how u use it ...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Imagine you are soloing the Bard Valen Nostrolo in South Karana at lvl<br/>
&gt;29.<br/>
&gt;He is a lvl 31 or 32 mob who has accelerado on so he runs pretty fast.<br/>
&gt;I always start fights with the allure of death/call of bones series on .<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1) Cast Screaming Terror  (Of coz!)<br/>
&gt;If it doesnt stick run for a few secs till u can recast ST ... If it<br/>
&gt;sticks ...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;2) Apply Darkness onto him .<br/>
&gt;You should have between 2-4 casts depending on your charisma<br/>
&gt;so darkness failing/resisting isnt a problem anymore , and we all<br/>
&gt;know how good the darkness success rates are dont we ? =)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;3) If Darkness Sticks on first or second try , Apply Boil Blood as well<br/>
&gt;.<br/>
&gt;you should have plenty of time to cast it if Darkness sticks 1st cast.<br/>
&gt;If darkness was resisted 4 or more times , cast Harmshield and head to<br/>
&gt;zone =)<br/>
&gt;or cast Feign Death and start praying .=/<br/>
&gt;you might not have enough mana at lvl 30 to take him down.<br/>
&gt;For those willing to put their balls on the line and have jboots/sow .<br/>
&gt;Put get to max distance and recast darkness .<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;4) If you are using a pet , Apply Fear . If without pet Apply Vampiric<br/>
&gt;curse to get back some HP . Whatever the case , 3-5 Shock of Poison<br/>
&gt;normally settles it .<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;5) Loot , Rinse , Repeat ad Infinitum .<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;All of You probably know how its done already .<br/>
&gt;Most of u have been doing the exact same thing<br/>
&gt;without screaming terror for ages . Except that now<br/>
&gt;you have a chance at recasting darkness MANY<br/>
&gt;times . We know how crutial darkness is at soloing/kiting<br/>
&gt;and with the kind of success rates it has it just wont do.<br/>
&gt;Using screaming terror along with your normal tactics<br/>
&gt;really gives us more consistant kills .<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Since Mezmerize is Charisma based , You should use<br/>
&gt;items to buff your charisma to 85 or higher for better<br/>
&gt;success with ST . I swopped my weapon for a crude stein.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Havent tried ST -&gt; Beguile Undead on Spectres yet .<br/>
&gt;If someone tries it please let us know . Not sure if<br/>
&gt;the Charm breaks ST yet .<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanx for reading this far !<br/>
&gt;This is just how &quot;I&quot; do it ...<br/>
&gt;No , &quot;YOU SUCK&quot; , &quot;DO IT MY WAY&quot; flames please .<br/>
&gt;I&#39;d love some criticism on how to improve the strategy<br/>
&gt;though so lets get this thread going . =)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;regards,<br/>
