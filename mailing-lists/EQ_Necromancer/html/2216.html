<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-951517341">I would go with Treants in SK from 20 - 25. A full group takes them <br/>
with no problem... 2 Necros can do the same. Not only is it good EXP <br/>
but the Loot is great (Can get heavy at times).<br/>
<br/>
From 25 - 30 I suggest Druids in EK or Rangers in WK. Once again <br/>
Great exp and Loot.<br/>
<br/>
For 30 - 35 Ulrich in WK is the best, this is a prime spot for <br/>
Necro&#39;s and druids. He is on a 6 minute timer and is tough at 30 and <br/>
a breeze at 35.<br/>
<br/>
For 35 - 40 start taking Einhorst. He is in the same camp as Ulrich. <br/>
Keep in mind you must kill ULrich before pullin Ein or you will be <br/>
using FD alot.<br/>
<br/>
If you dont have problems in groups for Treants & Druids or getting <br/>
the Barb Spawns then you can go from 20 - 40 in about 2 or 3 weeks of <br/>
good game play.<br/>
<br/>
Have Fun, <br/>
