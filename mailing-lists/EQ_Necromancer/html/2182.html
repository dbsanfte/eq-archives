<div id="ygrps-yiv-1810152087"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Crap ah well.<br/>
&gt;I get invis at 8. Maybe I&#39;ll try to sneak into town and see what my<br/>
&gt;faction is....I might be kos to guards but not necessarily all of<br/>
&gt;the npcs.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ouch!  Not a good idea.  I have heard that many things in the outpost can<br/>
see invis, I think its because half the NPC&#39;s in the outpost are undead and<br/>
you would need invis AND invis vs undead at the same time.  The Dragoons in<br/>
The Overthere are apart of the outpost faction, just con them or you can con<br/>
the Cliff Golem, or the Gargoyles, they will all tell you your standing with<br/>
the outpost without having to try to sneak inside.<br/>
