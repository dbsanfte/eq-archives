<b>Subject:</b> Now what <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-676854729">Ok need a little help. Im level 30 now and not to sure what spell combo to<br/>
use. I am still trying to get vampiric cures. Missing one word to make it<br/>
damn it :)<br/>
<br/>
Also Treants are all blue for me. I am a little bored of them. Any clue what<br/>
I should fight. I was thinking Cyclops&#39;s, since they are coning black<br/>
(white) for me, but damn they hit hard and have a ton of hp.<br/>
<br/>
Also is any one here having troubles with the spell hungry earth. I made it,<br/>
but I cant scribe it for some reason. I petitioned it but got no response<br/>
from a gm.<br/>
