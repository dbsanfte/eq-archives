 </span></blockquote>You should log into EQ and see how much it&#39;s changed in the last <br/>
year.<br/>
<br/>
The interface has gone from one of the worst in online gaming to one <br/>
of the best. Windows can be transparent, you can move them and <br/>
configure them easily, you can have multiple chat windows and <br/>
configure them to each serve specific purposes. Pets no longer take <br/>
experience, even if they do the kill alone. You can quickly and <br/>
easily get around if you have Planes of Power, as there are Plane of <br/>
Knowledge teleport books in every semi-civilized zone. There are <br/>
soulbinders, so no hunting for someone to bind you in a new zone. <br/>
Raids can now share experience cross-groups. Actually, the number of <br/>
changes is so huge that I can&#39;t even begin to think of everything. <br/>
<br/>
Oh, and I think the hot spell of the day is only a year old or <br/>
so...it&#39;s called Kodiak&#39;s Endless Intellect, or KEI, and it gives <br/>
you sixteen mana per tick plus like 30 INT and WIS. A lower-level <br/>
character cannot run out of mana, a mid level character never faces <br/>
downtime at all if he&#39;s careful, even soloing, and an uber character <br/>
has his downtime cut to a fraction, or none if in an effective group.<br/>
<br/>
I dunno if KEI was around more than a year ago, but nowadays there <br/>
is /always/ someone casting it for donations in Nexus, so it&#39;s at <br/>
least gone from nearly unknown to something anyone can get with a <br/>
little effort...and it lasts over two hours.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s more, with the all-download expansion (Legacy of Ykesha) <br/>
coming out in a few weeks, you can be a Frogluk, you have SIXTEEN <br/>
slots in the bank, there is an automatic (and a manual) mapping <br/>
system, you can dye armor SLOTS so that any armor put in it will be <br/>
the color you like to wear. There is a new item slot called Charms, <br/>
and a charm is a special kind of magic item which changes according <br/>
to circumstances, like growing more powerful for each of a certain <br/>
kind of armor you wear (like gaining HP for each piece of plate you <br/>
equip), or other things like growing more powerful the more PP you <br/>
are carrying.<br/>
<br/>
Lee&#39;s see...you were around for Luclin, which probably is what drove <br/>
you away, but they fixed every single bug from back then. Zoning is <br/>
faster, and messages are never lost during zone, they queue up and <br/>
you see them after you get through. <br/>
<br/>
They&#39;ve put out two stable, very useful expansions in just four <br/>
months, too.<br/>
<br/>
In effect, once Verant ceased to exist and it became officially <br/>
Sony, it seems they got ten times the development quality and funds, <br/>
and it&#39;s gone from an annoying game to being as good as anything out <br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
But for the coming expansion, the Frogluks have taken over my <br/>
original home town of Grobb, now known as Gukta, and the Trolls have <br/>
been relegated to hanging out in the foreign quarter of Neriak until <br/>
the new Troll city is built with the new expansion. That one thing <br/>
really annoys me.</div>
