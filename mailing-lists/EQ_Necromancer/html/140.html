<div id="ygrps-yiv-2094313342">Having grown dissatisfied with the &quot;good&quot; side of EQ life.. A friend and I decided we wanted to try our hands at Evil..<br/>
<br/>
    Having decided that we next sat down and tried to figure what would be the best combination for a 2 man team..<br/>
<br/>
    I&#39;ve always loved the pet classes.. And knowing that Necros are possibly the best solo class in the game.. I quickly set up Ahiru.. Dark Elf Necromancer and half sister of my Erudite Wizard character Uhira..  <br/>
<br/>
    My friend, who has always gone between liking to beat stuff to death and liking to cast spells (previous 2 characters a Druid and a Barb Warrior)..  Settled on an Ogre Shaman..  We were surprised after all the stories about how bad a shaman ogres make to find that he was readily able to get his Wisdom up to 102 (not great, but not terrible by any standards..)  Combined with ogres natural brutishness and great range of spells (heals, buffs, damage, and utils like SoW) we thought this would be a pretty wicked combination..<br/>
<br/>
    First question of course is is there any reason why this combination is a BAD choice?<br/>
    Second had to do with the regions..  Nektulos and Innothule are nice newbie zones (a tad rougher than their &quot;good&quot; equivalents, but giving them better range..  Outside of these zones we&#39;re wondering what life is like..<br/>
<br/>
Specifically what is the trip from Innothule Swamp to Freeport/Nektulos like and at what level is it safe to attempt..?  Also which zones will be better to explore as we go up in level (not planning to try and meet until we&#39;re about 5th so we both have gate spells)..<br/>
<br/>
    Ok.. Ramble aside what it boils down to is.. Which is better.. Befallen or Guk? Why? and what level should we hit the area?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks..<br/>
