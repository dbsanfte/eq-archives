<div id="ygrps-yiv-1104055180">I have recently gotten the availability of cable and DSL in my area for<br/>
about the same price. Cable advertises as being faster at peak times, but<br/>
there is that &quot;slow down&quot; thing. I was just wondering what you all think<br/>
would be better for EQ, cable or dsl. Thanks in advance =)<br/>

&gt; FYI I use a cable modem and the &quot;slow down&quot; experience of multiple users<br/>
&gt; being on is still MUCH better than any dial up connection.  When my<br/>
friends<br/>
&gt; are over on weekends I easily support 5 people zoning, etc. at the same<br/>
&gt; time.  However I use comcast cable out of the Detroit area, it may be<br/>
&gt; different depending on the company.  I believe comcast has a very large<br/>
pipe<br/>
&gt; to the inet supporting their users. (Multiple T3&#39;s i believe)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I personally will try to avoid playing eq on a dial up after playing on my<br/>
&gt; cable modem and friends DSL.  I can literally see friends on a modem keep<br/>
&gt; backstepping while there connection catches up, etc.  I have 1 friend that<br/>
&gt; has a key to my apartment and brings his computer over to play rather than<br/>
&gt; deal with dial up.  :)  These are my experiences.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Don&#39;t think that you won&#39;t ever get lag though.  Sometimes it is just<br/>
server<br/>
&gt; side lag  (i.e.  Verant)<br/>
