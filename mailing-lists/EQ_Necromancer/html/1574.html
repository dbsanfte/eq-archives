<div id="ygrps-yiv-2004198738">Ok, so a huge gnome showed up at the first organized sit in.  Now EVERYONE<br/>
wants to have one.  Do you honestly think Smed is going to show up to hear<br/>
ANOTHER group of whining players, regardless of whether or not their<br/>
complaints were valid?  No, he won&#39;t.  This would encourage people to hold a<br/>
sit in for every damn complaint they had (Monsters attacking through<br/>
walls=Sit-in! Price for bonechips on vendors too high=Sit in!).  The more<br/>
you use a tactic like this, the less impact it has.  Smed was wrong to even<br/>
show up to the first one.  <br/>
<br/>
Your best tools for getting something changed are phone calls and mail.  Not<br/>
Email, that&#39;s easy to just delete,  good old-fashioned U.S.P.S.. Which would<br/>
you pay attention to more, a bunch of messages in your Inbox, or 10 50lb<br/>
sacks of mail being dumped on your desk?  /Feedback works well to.  It takes<br/>
effort, not drama.  I play a necro, a high level one, and I don&#39;t feel that<br/>
this warrants a sit in anyway.  But it does need to be un-nerfed.  All a<br/>
massive newbie death fest will do is piss off everyone that&#39;s not a necro,<br/>
Verant included.  <br/>
