<div id="ygrps-yiv-2027438203">does the mana you have get increased immediately when you<br/>
add +int equipment, or does it only increase it after you<br/>
level?  what i mean is, do you get the same increase for<br/>
getting a +2 int earing and first wearing it at level 15,<br/>
as you would if you have had it since level 1?</div>
