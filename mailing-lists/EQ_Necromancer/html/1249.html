<div id="ygrps-yiv-368216335">That might be true. I am only level 15, however one of the reasons that<br/>
this does not bother me is that it takes me a long time to level. At<br/>
the rate I am going, I should hit level 30 right around christmas. I<br/>
suppose then I will see problems. *grin* Of course, thats several more<br/>
months of enjoying the game. By then, who knows what will hold my<br/>
interest. Perhaps I will start playin AC, or maybe take up underwater<br/>
basket weaving. :)<br/>

&gt; find that there not on all the time. Friends help<br/>
&gt; but it doesn&#39;t solve the<br/>
