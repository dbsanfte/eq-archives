&lt;&lt; does the mana you have get increased immediately when you<br/>
 add +int equipment, or does it only increase it after you<br/>
 level?  what i mean is, do you get the same increase for<br/>
 getting a +2 int earing and first wearing it at level 15,<br/>
 as you would if you have had it since level 1?   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
At the moment  you put it on it gives it take it off it takes it away ... my <br/>
estimate is +2 earings dont really give as much mana increase untill lvl 34 <br/>
before then maybe mana items better , but im guessing.<br/>
 Im loaded now with 160 modified intel and skull and book for an extra 60 <br/>
mana at lvl 30. <br/>
