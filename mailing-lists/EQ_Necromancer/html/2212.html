 </span></blockquote>Umm - what point do you think giving a shield to your pet has that giving<br/>
armor to your pet doesn&#39;t have?  The pet would get extra AC (and stat<br/>
bonuses if magic), just like from a shield.  I don&#39;t know if it actually<br/>
works or not.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard various theories:<br/>
1) the pet ignores armor you give it<br/>
2) the pet equips armor you give it<br/>
3) the pet acts as if it had a full suit of whatever armor you give it<br/>
(i.e. give a bronze vambrace, it gets the AC of full bronze).<br/>
<br/>
My personal opinion (backed up by absolutely nothing) is that it works<br/>
similar to pet weapons - it increases AC if the &#39;natural&#39; AC of the pet is<br/>
lower than that type of armor.  I rarely bother giving armor to my pet,<br/>
except as a convenient way to destroy cloth and leather.<br/>
