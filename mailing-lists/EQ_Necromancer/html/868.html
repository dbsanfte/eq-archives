I am a DE Necro on Povar, and just made 16th. I am trying to locate a spell<br/>
and have a question on effectiveness on another. I am looking for the spell<br/>
Hungry Earth. I looked all throughout he necro guild and could not locate<br/>
it. Is it in another guild/town? I am also interested in the spell Banshee<br/>
Aura. I cannot find that one either but do know it takes pearls which sell<br/>
for a little over 5pp at the necro guild. So the big question is, is the<br/>
spell worth it? Any info would be greatly appreciated...<br/>
