&gt; I think that 8 to 12 is worse than 7th to 8th.  You are basically<br/>
&gt; relegated to killing only undead monsters.  All of your other offensive<br/>
&gt; spells are 1st and 4th level spells (Vampiric Embrace either doesn&#39;t work<br/>
 </span></blockquote>or<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; just plain sucks) thus most monsters you would face to gain experience in<br/>
&gt; the 8-12 range will shrug all of those off.  If we didn&#39;t get Ward Undead<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 8th I would say Necromancers would be totally screwed.  But we do have it,<br/>
&gt; and it works wonders once you get it up to a decent level.  I just don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; like the fact that you HAVE to hunt Undead from 8th to 12th.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m actually progressing at a rather good clip at 10th level fighting giant<br/>
scarabs and tarantulas in north ro, basically hit them with a clinging<br/>
darkness to draw them in, order the pet to attack, hit with poison bolt,<br/>
disease cloud then siphon strength.  At that point your pet is probably<br/>
around 1/2 to 3/4, move in and melee with the creature as long as you can,<br/>
lifespike if necessary.  I&#39;ll consistantly kill the insectoid nuisance with<br/>
about 1/2 mana to spare, usually med to 3/4 before I go looking for another<br/>
just in case they resist one of the first 4 spells.  at 8th/9th level I was<br/>
taking down scarabs that /con&#39;d red, I have trouble with the yellows now<br/>
because of decreased pet strength in relation to my level...the real trick<br/>
is to make sure your pet is a badass, there is one level pet out of the 4 or<br/>
so you can summon with bone walk that will bash/parry as well as attack,<br/>
this little guy is a machine.  I call him the porta-tank. :)  If you get<br/>
tired of these guys you can usually take down a white/yellow dervish<br/>
cutthroat, and the occasional shriveled mummy.<br/>
<br/>
(this is all solo btw, if you add just one other person you can be a north<br/>
ro wrecking crew and take on darn near anything but the ghouls, sand giants<br/>
and dervish thugs)<br/>
