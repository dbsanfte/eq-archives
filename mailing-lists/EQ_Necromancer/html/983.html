as per the suggestion of someone on this list, i spent about an hour an a<br/>
half killing Jonah Buckler in Lake Rathetear.  got me the last half of L15<br/>
(man that was a crappy lvl to be).  i would suggest buying all your spells<br/>
first and stashing them in the bank to save yourself the trip to neriak (or<br/>
wherever).  if this is your first time in the area, find a map site and<br/>
print out the maps of lake rathetear and rathe mtns (mtns especially).<br/>
