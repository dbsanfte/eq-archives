<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1824366181">Greetings Dark friends,<br/>
<br/>
I just made level 16 today and I am very excited about testing it out.  I<br/>
wanted some suggestions on where to hunt between level 16 and 20. I have<br/>
heard from you all saying that the Karanas and Lake Rathe are good. Please,<br/>
any advise would be appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and the stormy weather? Well I live in Myrtle Beach and Hurricane Floyd<br/>
is dropping in to say hello=(<br/>
