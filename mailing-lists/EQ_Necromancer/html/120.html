<div id="ygrps-yiv-753562438">This is a question for experienced folks, and some advice for newbies.<br/>
<br/>
7th level as a Necro to date was the most frustrating level for me (Dark<br/>
Elf, not sure if that makes a difference). Probably the main reason is that<br/>
a lot of the creatures you used to fight for good EXP now /con green to you.<br/>
Almost all large spiders, quite a few shadow wolfs, and a number of bears<br/>
/con green and don&#39;t give you any EXP when you kill them. This leaves skels<br/>
and tree snakes (Nek Forest) as the only reliable EXP you can find. To top<br/>
it off, since you&#39;re maxed out in spells and armor at this point, you<br/>
usually don&#39;t have much reason to kill except to gain EXP to level up, which<br/>
just makes it more monotonous. So, any newbie players to the Monks, be<br/>
warned that the 7th level will make you want to quit the class (It almost<br/>
did me), if you can tough it out 8th level has some nice benefits.<br/>
<br/>
The question for experienced players is: is this common for anylevel before<br/>
a new spell rank? I.E. does level 11, 15, etc. seem to take forever? Or is<br/>
it just level 7?<br/>
