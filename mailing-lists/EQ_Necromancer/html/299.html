<div id="ygrps-yiv-1246510640">Ok..  It was pointed out that Verant probably wouldn&#39;t go for a spell that gives out a numerical indication of a creature&#39;s power..  But this gave me another idea..  What if, when you cast you summon.. When the creature appears a text message pops up stating the equivalent of a /con but using the spell&#39;s level of power as a reference instead of your level..<br/>
<br/>
    What I mean is.. Say you case a 4th level summon..<br/>
You can get a critter that ranged from 3-5th level (AFAIK)..  That being the case.. A message that says.. The spell summons a weak/average/powerful elemental would work perfectly without giving anything away, and would be as useful as /conning it when you get the level, and continue to be useful when you get above the creature&#39;s level later on..<br/>
