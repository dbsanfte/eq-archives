 </span></blockquote>hmm this is a dangerous thing.  altough most people in qeynos like me ie<br/>
they con positively including the guards.  I have camped next to a guard and<br/>
when I reentered the game he killed me.    I would be careful about being<br/>
bound that close.....  I even checked him after I died and he conned<br/>
positively.  Could be a bug. &lt;shrug&gt;  For what it is worth.<br/>
