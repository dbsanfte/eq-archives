Hello.<br/>
<br/>
I have found the spell, esp in combo with dark empathy to work very nicely<br/>
against asps. Since asps poison strongly, I send in pet after I cast a<br/>
darkness spell. I then try to get off a disease spell. Then I just alternate<br/>
mend bones and dark empathy. With this I was able to defeat lev 9 and 8 asps<br/>
at lev 9. With this method I am also able to defeat almost any lev 10 non<br/>
poisoning MOB in ecommons. I have killed lev 10 Y-Kodiacs, orc centurians<br/>
and lions. Or you can just use mend bones and when the pet is near death,<br/>
you can step in and tank for your pet.<br/>
<br/>
What I like most about my necromancer is that there seems to be more then<br/>
one way to get the job done. My wizard and magician both seemed to only have<br/>
1 basic approach that either succeeded or failed. I&#39;m likeing the<br/>
necromancer&#39;s larger variety of spells, though you can&#39;t use them all in<br/>
every situation.<br/>
