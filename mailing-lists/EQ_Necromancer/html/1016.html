 </span></blockquote>Well... time will tell... but... the Aviaks in South Karana tend to have a <br/>
research component 1 out of every 10 or so I kill.  And they tend to have <br/>
words more often than other components.  At 18 you should be able to do the <br/>
lower level aviaks egrets and Darters.  You will have to be careful with <br/>
Rooks.  But should be able to get them if you are in a group.  And Harriers <br/>
and Avocets will be a bit beyond your skills.  (harriers are about 24th <br/>
level, Avocets are about 28th level)<br/>
Egrets MAY be too low a level to have words... but I do not remember.<br/>
The problem is that this is now a heavily camped &quot;city&quot;.  There is not much <br/>
problem with kill stealing (people seem polite about that...)  BUT kiting <br/>
does not happen.  If an aviak is running about... it gets taken (so in that <br/>
way it may be &quot;stolen&quot; but it is hard to tell it belongs to someone when it <br/>
is running around... it looks like you are running for help)<br/>
