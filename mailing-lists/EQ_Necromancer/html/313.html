<div id="ygrps-yiv-857584779">Here&#39;s the current attempt at sizing up the mana.  So far its the<br/>
best approximation of our mana level.  I&#39;ve tried it out roughly and its<br/>
pretty damn close.  Eventually if I get bored enough I&#39;ll actually attempt<br/>
to see how close it is.<br/>
<br/>
Max mana = ((INT/5)+2) * level  + magic items<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s take a look at me.<br/>
<br/>
INT = 127<br/>
Level = 16<br/>
Carrying one Runed Totem Staff and two Jaded Silver Rings(magical) for a<br/>
total of +15 mana<br/>
<br/>
INT/5 = 25 (I&#39;m pretty sure its rounded down)<br/>
<br/>
max mana = 27*16 + 15 = 447<br/>
<br/>
With a crappy number like that I&#39;ll never know FOR SURE, but with testing I<br/>
can come within five mana of an answer.  Eventually I&#39;ll do this since level<br/>
17 is so far away (died twice in fifteen minutes, how lame)<br/>
<br/>
Once again I&#39;m no sure of the usefulness of the other attributes either.<br/>
More and more people are subscribing to the &quot;dump all yer bonus points into<br/>
INT&quot; role because DEX seems to have some kind of effect on casting.  I was<br/>
thinking of creating a mage with all points in DEX to see if I could see any<br/>
VISIBLE affect on casting time and interruptions, but again, I don&#39;t care<br/>
all that much, having fun with my current char.<br/>
<br/>
One suggestion I do make simply for efficieny is to make all you numbers in<br/>
multiples of FIVE.  Apparently Verant likes multiple of 5.  Yu can imagine<br/>
my irritation when I found that out and had an INT of 124.  But now I found<br/>
a necklace so I&#39;m better.<br/>

&gt; &gt; and if you are hardcore you can<br/>
&gt; &gt;  calculate it with the mana calculator and divide it by <br/>
&gt; five to see how much<br/>
&gt; &gt;  mana you have per bubble.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Could someone repeat the mana &quot;calculator&quot; ?  Is that a <br/>
&gt; little program or <br/>
&gt; just a formula.  If it is a formula, I would appreciate it :) <br/>
&gt;  especially <br/>
&gt; since it has something to do with Intelligence.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; thanks<br/>
