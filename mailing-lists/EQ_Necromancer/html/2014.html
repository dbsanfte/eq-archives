<div id="ygrps-yiv-879408300">Ok, Thanks for the info.  Thanks to you also, Cory.<br/>
<br/>
On a side note.  I started Alazzar because I got discouraged with my level<br/>
23 bard.  I just got tired of dieing all the time.<br/>
<br/>
Well last night I made 2 1/2 bubbles of xp in 2 1/2 hours.  My bard never<br/>
did this in his life.  I was amazed at how quickly my pet and I were mowing<br/>
thru mobs with no downtime at all.  I am looking forward to playing Alazzar,<br/>
I&#39;m just going to have to get used to the faction thing.  I haven&#39;t had to<br/>
deal with it yet.<br/>
<br/>
Good hunting,<br/>
<br/>

At lowers levels giving a pet DOES help.  Give him a rusty two hander=)<br/>
Once your pets damage is more than that of the weapon then no need to give<br/>
pet weapons until 29 when they get dual wield.<br/>

&gt; Hello,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am new to the list and being a Necro.  I am a level 4 Necro on the<br/>
&gt; Mithaniel Marr server.  I am a little confused on the pet weapon issue.<br/>
&gt; Last night I gave my pet a rusty short sword.  Before I gave it to him his<br/>
&gt; max damage was 6.  After I gave it to him it went to 10.  Was it just a<br/>
&gt; fluke and the weapon didn&#39;t do anything?  That&#39;s what the below seems to<br/>
&gt; suggest.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks in advance,<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt; There are two types to give to pets. Weapons that<br/>
&gt; process, and weapons that do not. If you give a pet a<br/>
&gt; weapons that processes(dnoll hide lariat, mage<br/>
&gt; summoned sword), then the pet will process in battle<br/>
&gt; and do extra damage. Any other weapon makes no<br/>
&gt; difference what so ever. Rusty, low damage, high<br/>
&gt; damae, low speed, high speed, it makes no difference<br/>
&gt; what so ever. However, with the recent weapon change,<br/>
&gt; the pet will sometimes &quot;eat&quot; a weapon. You give it a<br/>
&gt; weapon, and it does not show up as a graphic, and pet<br/>
&gt; does not double hit. You need to give the pet another<br/>
&gt; weapon.<br/>
