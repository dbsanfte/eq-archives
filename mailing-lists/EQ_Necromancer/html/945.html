<br/>

&gt; I find that I must do my own Necro research.  I am L16, Gnome. Could<br/>
&gt; someone share the basic approach to research wirh me?  I know of one site<br/>
&gt; (URL) that has information on what words make what spell.  Would anyone<br/>
&gt; share any others?  I have access to lots of words.  I think I spend 1<br/>
&gt; training point in research (all that is permitted) , buy some book or<br/>
&gt; container, put words in it, and do some kind of action to make a spell.<br/>
If<br/>
&gt; it fails ( and I imagine they all do) words are gone?  How do you store<br/>
&gt; same words (stackable like fish) ?  Where are best places, and mobs, to<br/>
get<br/>
&gt; words?  Do I have to be successful at making L1-L15 spells before I have a<br/>
&gt; hope of making L16 ones?  Can I make L24 spells before I am L24?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I need Restless Bones, Feign Death, and Aura Banshee.  Some say at least<br/>
&gt; the 1st and 3d can be bought from vendors but I have no idea where?  Is<br/>
L16<br/>
&gt; way to low to make L16 spells?<br/>
