<div id="ygrps-yiv-1511879170">Ya thats the point that is hard for necro&#39;s level 7 and 15... so on and so<br/>
on. Also there is a few bugs in some of are spells, but thats life I take<br/>
it. Siphion strenth is one of my favorates. Along with poision spike. I like<br/>
to hit them with a poision spell from afar. then steal there strenth so they<br/>
dont hit as hard. Next get in and help your pet. After you have taken a few<br/>
hits step back and suck some hit points out of them and get back in so your<br/>
pet doesnt die on you. Grim Aura is another good spell to get. But the first<br/>
2 spell you allways upgrade first is your pet then the life tap spells. At<br/>
level 4 you get meditate and that helps as you know from your wizared. Next<br/>
big thing is master you pet comands they can save your life. You can put<br/>
your pet comands on your hot keys and thats a big help as well. I have<br/>
plaied 5 diferent char to level 10 and I have to say I know I am a necro at<br/>
heart. :)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hello.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I recently started a new dark elf necromancer on Mythannial Marr. I&#39;m a<br/>
&gt;whole lev 2 at this point. I haven&#39;t trained any skills yet at the guild<br/>
&gt;hall. Can I get some advice as to what spells to focus on? Is 2H staffs the<br/>
&gt;weapon I should be using?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also at what level will I start to get a good feel for being a necromancer<br/>
&gt;and start coming into my own? Are there any levels I should just gut out?<br/>
&gt;For example my lev 15 magician had a very rough time at lev7 but at lev8<br/>
&gt;things were MUCH easier. When I get lev 16 with my magician tomorrow or the<br/>
&gt;next day I&#39;ll again see a HUGE increase in power. I&#39;m assuming Necromancers<br/>
&gt;work the same way?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Any tips would be appreciated.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
