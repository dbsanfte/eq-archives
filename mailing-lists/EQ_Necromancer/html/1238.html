<div id="ygrps-yiv-309699619">I would have to say that the new patch has made me adjust the style that I<br/>
use when fighting mobs. Now that I have adopted the root and dot, dot, dot,<br/>
and sometimes dot technique, I realize that I could have easily done it that<br/>
way before. Now the patch helps even more by giving me extra damage when the<br/>
mob is rooted. I would have to say that the mob gets to me a lot easier with<br/>
this technique, but manageable with good tactics.<br/>
<br/>
My one BIG rant is what they have done to the Darkness line of spells<br/>
because of the patch. The whole spell line is rendered useless for damage<br/>
now because root wipes it out. They really need to figure out a way to make<br/>
darkness stick even when a root is cast on the mob.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, one more rant to finish it off, what they have done to ignite bones is<br/>
ridiculous. It is a horrible DD to begin with, now they remove the root-like<br/>
effect and make it even worse, AARGH!<br/>
