I play DAoC. I quit EQ well over a year ago.  Personally, I REALLY like it.<br/>
I will be honest and say that I&#39;m not really fond of the dungeons that<br/>
originally came with DAoC. They were weak at best. However, the new dungeons<br/>
in the expansion are much better and much more EQ like. I always felt that<br/>
EQ&#39;s dungeons were fairly well designed and they only got better with the<br/>
expansions.<br/>
<br/>
With that said, the main attraction for me is the Realm vs. Realm combat.<br/>
Taking keeps and jacking relics is a total blast!  I have noticed that my<br/>
friends that have tried DAoC have started on what we call the &quot;Co-op&quot;<br/>
server. Basically, these are like EQ style servers and are PvE only...pretty<br/>
boring if you ask me.  Give a regular server a chance and I think you will<br/>
like the way RvR is done. You won&#39;t have someone in your home town gank you<br/>
or people from other realms raiding newbie areas. Its just not setup that<br/>
way.  If you play on a PvP server its a different story.<br/>
<br/>
RvR in my book is just awesome.<br/>
<br/>
If you have any questions please feel free to ask. I will be glad to help<br/>
you out as much as I can. DAoC isnt perfect by any stretch, but it really<br/>
suits me and my play style.<br/>

&gt; I stopped playing my necro at 30 a long time ago. Since then I have<br/>
leveled<br/>
&gt; up a Druid to 53 but wishing I had a high level group character, I am<br/>
&gt; working on one now a low level enchanter that may not even make it to 20<br/>
but<br/>
&gt; who knows<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; BTW, I am also looking forward to Star Wars Galaxies, looks like alot of<br/>
&gt; fun.<br/>
