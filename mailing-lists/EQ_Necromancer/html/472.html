<div id="ygrps-yiv-1864027883">THere is no better place to get to level 12. I am almost at level 12. I got<br/>
bound to grobb at level 4. In so ro there is some orks camps that have<br/>
centuries far from the group so you can kill then easy and get good ex. They<br/>
are the camps just befor the desert. on the east side!!! Also when you get<br/>
to level 11. Your pet sucks again. Well troll warriors make wonderfull pets.<br/>
Just dont tell them that s what they are. Get impart strenth and dark<br/>
empathy and group up at level 9, 10, 11 and kill dervish for good money.<br/>
They have bronxe weapons and that worth good plat. Also in guk the froggie<br/>
city there is lots of woven armor to be had off the froggies!! So good luck<br/>
