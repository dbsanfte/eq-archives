<div id="ygrps-yiv-1789623032">Follow the quest as it is given to you :P  If you have all of the items,<br/>
like the scythe, knife and whatever, and you know that you need to give the<br/>
scythe first to get the note, then do that, and then turn in all the other<br/>
ingredients with the note and you&#39;ll have the harvester.  <br/>
<br/>
The headmaster was blue to me at 30th and was decent exp as well.  He could<br/>
be pulled without anyone else coming, just bring him down to the water just<br/>
to make sure.<br/>

I know that in the beginning of this quest you need to get a shadowed <br/>
scythe.Once you turn that in you get a note asking for the additional 3 <br/>
needed items.My question is, if you already know the other 3 items needed,<br/>
do <br/>
you even have to do the shadowed scythe part?Also, can someone please give<br/>
me <br/>
the approximate level of the goblin in OOT who drops the shadowed knife?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance!<br/>
