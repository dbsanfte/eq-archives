<div id="ygrps-yiv-1239110602">Thought I would just throw in some more opinion based on fact.  I <br/>
have DSL and wouldnt change it to cable for anything, but here are <br/>
some base facts on both.<br/>
<br/>
DSL - You get a dedicated MINIMUM bandwidth.  If you are closer to a <br/>
the switch, it will be higher.  (eg.  I have a 512K DSL connect, but <br/>
actually my router trained at 640K down, 570K up)  Nobody else shares <br/>
that bandwidth with you and it can be used for anything (at least in <br/>
my case).  I can run any servers I want (web, Quake III, UT, <br/>
whatever) and my provided couldnt care less, because I pay for the <br/>
full bw usage 24/7.  I have also found that DSL is much easier to <br/>
connect more than 1 machine (at least with my service) because I use <br/>
a router rather than a &quot;modem&quot;.  The router takes care of the DHCP to <br/>
all the boxes and just plugs into a hub.<br/>
<br/>
Cable - You get a faster downspeed than DSL usually (unless you start <br/>
talking the 1.5 to 7Mb range that DSL can support), for a lower <br/>
price.  However, you are not guaranteed any minimum data rate because <br/>
it is a shared connect.  Also, 90% of all cable carriers are now <br/>
limiting your upspeed to 128K with a X GB limit on outgoing data <br/>
(depends on company...  eg. AT&T is where I am and they allow 3GB <br/>
data upstream).  Most cable companys wont tell you this outright.  <br/>
You have to ask.  Also, those same companies do not allow you to run <br/>
a server on your line...they all have a separate product line for <br/>
that for businesses and is quite expensive.  To run multiple <br/>
computers on this setup, you usually have to buy extra IP addresses <br/>
for them or have one system proxy for the others.<br/>
<br/>
So, for techno geeks like me, DSL is better, but if you are just <br/>
surfing, downloading files, and playing MMPORPG&#39;s, cable would do the <br/>
trick.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I&#39;ve used both and gotten great performance from both.<br/>
&gt;   In theory, DSL is supposed to give you your own<br/>
&gt;   dedicated bandwidth though, vs. shared bandwidth of<br/>
&gt;   cable modems, however I have cable modem and have<br/>
&gt;   rarely, if ever, had and connection speed issues.  I<br/>
&gt;   think either way you will be happy.<br/>

&gt;   &gt; there is that &quot;slow down&quot; thing. I was just<br/>

&gt;   &gt; &gt; FYI I use a cable modem and the &quot;slow down&quot;<br/>
&gt;   &gt; experience of multiple users<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; being on is still MUCH better than any dial up<br/>
&gt;   &gt; connection.  When my<br/>
&gt;   &gt; friends<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; are over on weekends I easily support 5 people<br/>
&gt;   &gt; zoning, etc. at the same<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; time.  However I use comcast cable out of the<br/>
&gt;   &gt; Detroit area, it may be<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; different depending on the company.  I believe<br/>
&gt;   &gt; comcast has a very large<br/>
&gt;   &gt; pipe<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; to the inet supporting their users. (Multiple T3&#39;s<br/>
&gt;   &gt; i believe)<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; I personally will try to avoid playing eq on a<br/>
&gt;   &gt; dial up after playing on my<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; cable modem and friends DSL.  I can literally see<br/>
&gt;   &gt; friends on a modem keep<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; backstepping while there connection catches up,<br/>
&gt;   &gt; etc.  I have 1 friend that<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; has a key to my apartment and brings his computer<br/>
&gt;   &gt; over to play rather than<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; deal with dial up.  :)  These are my experiences.<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; Don&#39;t think that you won&#39;t ever get lag though.<br/>
&gt;   &gt; Sometimes it is just<br/>
&gt;   &gt; server<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; side lag  (i.e.  Verant)<br/>
