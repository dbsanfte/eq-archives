&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  Has anyone used it at all?    Does it stack w/ the 3 other L12-L16 DoTs?<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, I have used it.  It seems to stack just fine.  But here is the risks.<br/>
<br/>
#1 there is no visual cue (no nice sparkles, cloud or anything... it just <br/>
happens) you have to watch the messages to see if it worked.<br/>
#2 if you are in the area of effect... YOU get diseased also :)<br/>
<br/>
otherwise it is great, does a bit of DD (don&#39;t remember how much) and 2 per <br/>
&quot;round&quot; DOT.  So it is an AOE DOT!<br/>
