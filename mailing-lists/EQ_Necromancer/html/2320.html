<div id="ygrps-yiv-1899917795">I think what he means by turn based is that you don&#39;t physically fire the<br/>
weapon yourself you just arm it, select to attack something and the computer<br/>
does the rest. If it was a true FPS then you would be able to aim and fire<br/>
yourself.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Turn based? Have you ever played ANY of these games? They&#39;re not turn<br/>
based...Civilization is turn based. These are realtime, massive media online<br/>
role playing games.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Are you on drugs? These are ALL first person shooter perspective.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
What, by the way, does RvR mean?<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; to make EQ even better that will probably drive me to play EQ2 when its<br/>
&gt; released. I am really looking forward to EQ2 as well as Planetside. If you<br/>
&gt; ask me, it looks like Sony will be the numero uno MMORPG game company out<br/>
&gt; there. And believe me, companies love nothing more than a continuous<br/>
&gt; revenue<br/>
&gt; stream, especially from loyal and dedicated fans.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>EQ2 uses the same engine as Star Wars Galaxies, which you were just dissing.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; all felt pretty alien to me. Since I don&#39;t have Luclin, the graphics were<br/>
&gt; obviously VERY dated. I would have liked to have tried EQ with updated<br/>
&gt; graphics. They look pretty good from what I&#39;ve seen.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, my wife has one account without Luclin, and I barely comprehend how we<br/>
played back then. You really must have the new graphics engine in order to<br/>
appreciate how far along EQ&#39;s come.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I don&#39;t think there is a demo of DAoC, which is quite unfortunate. The<br/>
&gt; classic DAoC sells in most stores for about $20 w/1month free access. So<br/>
&gt; its<br/>
&gt; not too bad to check it out. If you happen to have a friend who had it<br/>
 </span></blockquote>that<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; would be the most ideal situation.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nope, their lack of foresight&#39;s probably losing them this player. I don&#39;t<br/>
have the resources nowadays to spend ANY money &quot;just in case I like it more<br/>
than the game I enjoy playing now&quot;. Even when I was annoyed with EQ a year<br/>
ago, there were plenty of MMORPGs out there who would let me try them free.<br/>
