For levels up to about 16, however, it still makes sense to give your pet<br/>
a rusty 2H Sword, Halberd, or Scythe.  Personally, even at L21 I give my<br/>
pet a rusty weapon because I prefer the look.<br/>

Pets do the better of their natural damage and the damage of the weapon<br/>
they hold.  They ignore the delay of the weapon.<br/>
