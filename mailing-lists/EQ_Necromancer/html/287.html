<div id="ygrps-yiv-1386605668">When did the pet commands change?? .... I have always <br/>
used the /pet guard here command to make cash. I would goto an area where<br/>
a low level mob with good loot would spawn and give my pet the <br/>
guard here command then I would go elsewhere and hunt some other mobs for<br/>
loot. I recently tried this again and found that my pet would no longer attack<br/>
a mob in guard mode unless the mob attacked first.<br/>
Guess the days of making 10-20 plat in 2 hours are over :-(.<br/>
