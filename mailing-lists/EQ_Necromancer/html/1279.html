<div id="ygrps-yiv-1444353658">There are a pair of militia guards in the west commonlands that are very<br/>
easy at L20.  Also, some paladins in north freeport are pretty easy, though<br/>
getting to them can be pretty sporting.  The militia guards tend to be eaten<br/>
by kodiaks from time to time, but they spawn at the guard post.</div>
