<div id="ygrps-yiv-868359378">One additional note from someone who just left the island (now level 16):<br/>
<br/>
If you get ganged up on (and it WILL happen) then let your pet take what he can and<br/>
swim out into the water. I don&#39;t mean to waist level .... I mean swim out a bit. The<br/>
sisters can&#39;t/don&#39;t swim and will only follow you until the swim point. You can then<br/>
safely gate, or even summon a new pet. I&#39;ve even memorized a pet spell, sent him up to<br/>
fight, then another until the coast was clear. =) Call it what you will but at least it<br/>
kept me from dying.<br/>
<br/>
Some other tips would be to gamble a little and bind to Freeport. You will cut your<br/>
travel time to sell belts IMMENSELY. Yes if you die it will be a pain but it is sooooo<br/>
worth it to be able to gate back and sell things in a minute or two instead of about<br/>
30. Also, at level 12 several of the sisters will be in the blue range for you. Pay<br/>
attention to the clothing type since sisters of the same level range dress the same.<br/>

&gt; Actually like all places in EQ there is a risk Reward.  stay away con and be<br/>
&gt; smart.  worst mistake you could make is to get greedy.  What I usually do is<br/>
&gt; watch for the island once it comes into sight is to swim to it.  This puts<br/>
&gt; me on a little outcropping that has a pretty good spawn rate of the lower<br/>
&gt; level Sisters.  Keep an eye out for them and dont be affraid of sacking your<br/>
&gt; pet and gating.<br/>

&gt; &gt;I have a couple questions about the island... I&#39;m almost 12 (on a new<br/>
&gt; &gt;server) and was thinking about checking it out.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I know there are some high level sisters (red to my old char at 17)... do<br/>
&gt; &gt;you have to worry about them wandering by?   The one I know I saw was<br/>
&gt; &gt;standing out in the water a little ways from the island.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Where is a good place to hunt on the island?  I&#39;ve never really been there<br/>
&gt; &gt;(seen it from the boat many times) and since I believe they will be agro to<br/>
&gt; &gt;my DE Necro (they are wood elves) I won&#39;t be able to really explore.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Any other general advise/tips about the island?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;The darkness be with you,<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; Aarkon,<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; I read your post the other day about being able to<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; handle Sister Isle from level 12+. Being level 12<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; myself I decided to try it last night. I&#39;m now<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; level 13 and having a blast. Thank you.<br/>
