<div id="ygrps-yiv-821521052">If this is your secondary char or if you have a friend I&#39;d go out and buy<br/>
some +cha gear. Right before you charm quickly toss it on and you&#39;ll get<br/>
lower resists and better times ( well perecentage wise that is ). You can<br/>
find some cheap stuff though like trhat mug ogre guyards drop which adds<br/>
like 15 cha or something and in general charisma gear is pretty cheap if I<br/>
remember correctly. Either way though find what cha items you can. Off the<br/>
top of my head I can think of that mug, some cha rings, probably earrings,<br/>
bracers, and a veil. There is more I&#39;m just not sure which is what right<br/>
now. Heh haven&#39;t managed to get my gear but I can tell you from the<br/>
shaman/enchanter buffs I get for charisma that my charms do last a lot, I<br/>
stree a lot, longer then normal and less resists.<br/>

&gt;I&#39;m about halfway through L20, and I&#39;ve been in Unrest playing with<br/>
&gt;Dominate Undead in situations where it seems reasonable (indoors, pathing<br/>
&gt;bugs seem to make Slim run off and create a train for us fairly often, and<br/>
&gt;in groups without crowd control the charm seems to add more value than the<br/>
&gt;pet).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Things I&#39;ve learned:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Yellow/red Carrion Ghouls, Barbed Bone Skeletons, and Skeletal Monks make<br/>
&gt;fabulous pets. For about 15 seconds.  Then they and their friends pound<br/>
&gt;you to dust.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Dark blue things (drybones work well)  seem about optimum as far as<br/>
&gt;getting good hits (much better than a normal summoned pet) without<br/>
&gt;instadeath waiting for you when it breaks.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;100 mana is expensive when you have to cast it over and over, and 200 mana<br/>
&gt;is cheap when you only cast it if your pet dies.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Don&#39;t bother with Dominate unless you have managed to research Hungry<br/>
&gt;Earth.  You&#39;ll need it when charm breaks.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Things I wonder:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Are there any good charm strategies I&#39;m missing?  So far what seems best<br/>
&gt;is to pick a dark blue thing from a multiple-pull, /assist the puller, and<br/>
&gt;send it in.  I don&#39;t keep pets between pulls - the group kills it once the<br/>
&gt;combat&#39;s otherwise over.  Should I be thinking fancier?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It seems that in most situations, Slim is far superior to a temporary pet.<br/>
&gt;Is this other people&#39;s opinion as well?  Any clever places charm can get<br/>
&gt;you into that a pet can&#39;t?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Is there any better way to break charm when we&#39;re ready to kill my former<br/>
&gt;pet?  Currently I use gather shadows, which costs 35 mana or feign death,<br/>
&gt;which costs 60 but I&#39;m no longer the first target.  /pet get lost doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;seem to do anything - is there a cheaper or better way to release a<br/>
&gt;charmed pet?<br/>
