<div id="ygrps-yiv-1708484221">This is easy, just buy red wine at a bar, and take it to Lokar Tobiath (the<br/>
scribe) in the Library in 3rd gate. The faction adjustments are:<br/>
+DarkBargainers +DreadGuardInner +DreadGuardOuter<br/>
You can give him stacks of 4 wine at a time. Easy quest, easy faction with<br/>
guards and merchants. Now if I could only figure out a way to do the muffin<br/>
quest in FP...</div>
