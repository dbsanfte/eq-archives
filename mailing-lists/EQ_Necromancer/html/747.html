<div id="ygrps-yiv-848902517">He meant in general, Dark elf necros get exp bonuses.<br/>
As far as I understand it, there are class/race combinations that do give penalties to<br/>
experience, for example a dwarven paladin needs more exp than almost any other<br/>
combination of race and class to gain levels. Furthermore, supposedly there are also<br/>
certain combinations that give experience bonuses. The example that was suggested was a<br/>
dark elven necromancer. Apparently, the rumor that DE necros get an exp bonus (any and<br/>
all times exp is gained) has been confirmed by at least one GM.<br/>
This, is what I have read and heard from fellow players.<br/>

&gt; Bonuses on WHAT, I know clerics get them for undead, also when fighting<br/>
&gt; undead I seem to go up faster too.  Maybe he is talking about race bonuses<br/>
&gt; but those don&#39;t apply to Exp.<br/>
