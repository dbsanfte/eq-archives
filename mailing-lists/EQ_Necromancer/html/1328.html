<div id="ygrps-yiv-1541374435"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;     Heck, while I&#39;m at it, I may as well ask here too.  I&#39;m looking for<br/>
&gt; people to tell me what the price is for the Thaumaturgist (sp?) robe.  I<br/>
&gt; hear it goes for 70 to 80 plat.  I&#39;ll be needing to know soon and I&#39;m just<br/>
&gt; trying to verify this.  Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I got mine for free from a guildmate a while back...but 70-80 seems pretty<br/>
high..it&#39;s not that great of a robe, if people are selling it for that much,<br/>
I&#39;d just save another 100 and get an FBR</div>
