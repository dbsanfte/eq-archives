<div id="ygrps-yiv-1582078004">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I am new to the list and being a Necro.  I am a level 4 Necro on the<br/>
Mithaniel Marr server.  I am a little confused on the pet weapon issue.<br/>
Last night I gave my pet a rusty short sword.  Before I gave it to him his<br/>
max damage was 6.  After I gave it to him it went to 10.  Was it just a<br/>
fluke and the weapon didn&#39;t do anything?  That&#39;s what the below seems to<br/>
suggest.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,<br/>
<br/>
Alazzar  <br/>

There are two types to give to pets. Weapons that<br/>
process, and weapons that do not. If you give a pet a<br/>
weapons that processes(dnoll hide lariat, mage<br/>
summoned sword), then the pet will process in battle<br/>
and do extra damage. Any other weapon makes no<br/>
difference what so ever. Rusty, low damage, high<br/>
damae, low speed, high speed, it makes no difference<br/>
what so ever. However, with the recent weapon change,<br/>
the pet will sometimes &quot;eat&quot; a weapon. You give it a<br/>
weapon, and it does not show up as a graphic, and pet<br/>
does not double hit. You need to give the pet another<br/>
weapon.</div>
