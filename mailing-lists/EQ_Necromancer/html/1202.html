&gt;I seem to remember someone posting about an NPC in Lake Rathe named John<br/>
&gt;Buckler or something and he was good to kill from like 16 up to 19th<br/>
&gt;then there was another island w/ a double Aviak Guard spawn in that zone<br/>
&gt;that not many people went to, but I forget where in the zone it was.  Can<br/>
&gt;anyone help me on locateing these 2 places in Lake Rathe . ..  thanks<br/>
