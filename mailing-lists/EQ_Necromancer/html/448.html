&gt;     Personally?  Probably never.  I have personally lead the slaughter of<br/>
&gt;the Deathfist Orcs and cleaned out all Commonlands camps MULTIPLE times,<br/>
&gt;I&#39;d even go far as to say I&#39;ve killed over a thousand orcs in an attempt to<br/>
&gt;get goody goody with Freeport.  Hasn&#39;t happened yet.  I would just suck up<br/>
&gt;and deal with it.  I know I have.  As a Gnome Necromancer you can still get<br/>
&gt;into places Dark Elves can&#39;t, but I don&#39;t see the factions as too much of a<br/>
&gt;difference because Dark elf Necromancers are treated fairly by all three<br/>
&gt;evil cities which is a large area to be liked in, wherea Gnome Necros are<br/>
&gt;sort of disliked everywhere but not totally hated.  Take your pick.<br/>

&gt;No one ever answered that one guys question about if you kill enough ORCS <br/>
&gt;in<br/>
&gt;GF or CB does it help your faction w/ High Elves AND Wood Elves???<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;How many Orcs (roughly) do I need to kill w/ my Gnome Necro (level 1 hehe<br/>
&gt;newbie) before High Elves or Wood Elves will not KOS????<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also  what can I hunt in Steamfont that will not hurt my faction w/ <br/>
&gt;Gnomes??<br/>
&gt;or anyone else for that matter. . .   I don&#39;t know what to kill help stuck<br/>
&gt;at 1st lvl!!!!<br/>
