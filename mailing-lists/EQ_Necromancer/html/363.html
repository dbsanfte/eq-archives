<div id="ygrps-yiv-1438816904">Maybe, but I do this several times per gaming session, in a pretty remote<br/>
part of EverFrost. Ice bones are resistant to non-magical attacks, and since<br/>
my &#39;tank&#39; friend doesn&#39;t have a magical weapon, we pretty much always have<br/>
to flee from these foul creatures while we&#39;re hunting orcs...<br/>
<br/>
Not worth arguing over, because I won&#39;t dispute that most critters never<br/>
give up.<br/>

&gt; their attention broken by another character or were killed.  No<br/>
&gt; monster ever<br/>
&gt; forgets you unless they die, you die, you zone, or some Enchanter hits it<br/>
&gt; with a MEmory Blur (actually I think that only makes the monster<br/>
&gt; forget who<br/>
&gt; he&#39;s pissed off the most at).  Chances are something happened to<br/>
&gt; to icebone<br/>
&gt; while you were hauling arse.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Something else is their apparent psychic connection with<br/>
&gt; &gt; the planet.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; mean, seriously, you&#39;re completely across the zone from the<br/>
&gt; &gt; thing and it<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; will still know where you&#39;re at, even if you&#39;re far under<br/>
&gt; &gt; ground and it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; top side _and_ all the way on the other side of the zone make its<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; way to you<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; through maze or &#39;high water&#39; and begin pounding the snot<br/>
&gt; &gt; out of you&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; If there&#39;s one thing that does need to be fixed, it is<br/>
&gt; &gt; this. You can&#39;t run<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; away from anyone unless you&#39;ve cast some spell that slows<br/>
&gt; &gt; your enemy down.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; On top of that, they don&#39;t stop unless you zone or they&#39;re killed by<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; somebody. It&#39;d be nice if the game had a LOS variable for<br/>
&gt; &gt; monsters that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; figured whether or not they knew where you were at any given point.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; In Everfrost, my shaman character can outrun Ice Boned<br/>
&gt; &gt; Skeletons and &#39;break<br/>
&gt; &gt; their lock&#39; so they can&#39;t find/attack me. Of course, this is<br/>
&gt; &gt; easier with<br/>
&gt; &gt; SoW, but even without you can get away. OTOH, mammoths NEVER<br/>
&gt; &gt; forget you....<br/>
&gt; &gt; so maybe it depends on the creature?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Sorry to apply shaman experience in the necro mailing list,<br/>
&gt; &gt; but I have more<br/>
&gt; &gt; experience in that world.<br/>
