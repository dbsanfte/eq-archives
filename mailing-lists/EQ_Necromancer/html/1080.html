<b>Subject:</b> problem with leering corpse <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-736212301">Logged on today after last patch, used 40 bone chips and not one pet hit<br/>
over 10dmg.  Yes it was leering corpse I was using. I&#39;m level 15 on the<br/>
karana server.  I tried rememming the spell and I even cast the previous<br/>
pet spell.  So my question is have necros&#39; been screwed again, is it a<br/>
bug on all servers, a bug on Karana, or is my Char bugged?  Any help<br/>
would be appreciated before I close the account and tell Verant where to<br/>
stick it.<br/>
