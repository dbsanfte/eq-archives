 </span></blockquote>It is a research ONLY level 20 spell.<br/>
<br/>
It gives the user 18 seconds on invulnerability (NOTHING can ham you, though <br/>
you can be stunned)  During that 18 seconds you cannot cast a spell.  As far <br/>
as I know, there are no required casting components.<br/>
<br/>
There is a long regen time between casts, and when you first memorize it <br/>
(though I MAY have hit a bug... I zoned while it was still on, and it was <br/>
available immediately again...)<br/>
<br/>
I used it last night to test if I could bank in a town and it saved my life :)</div>
