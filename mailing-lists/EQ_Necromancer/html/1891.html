<br/>
Maybe you can tell us which driver/settings you are using on your Geforce to get it working flawlessly in evercrack.<br/>

  Verant, like all wimpy cover-our-butts developers, will NEVER say they &quot;support&quot; anything new that comes out.  They just cannot be bothered to try.<br/>
<br/>
  That said, just because they don&#39;t &quot;support&quot; a particular card does not mean it won&#39;t work.  I have the GE Force card and it works great in EQ.  What Verant is referring to when they say they don&#39;t &quot;support&quot; the GE Force is that EQ will not take advantage of many of the benefits of GE Force.  The software has to be designed from the ground up to take full advantage of the on-board processor.  But the GE Force will work fine with EQ and probably every other game out there.<br/>
<br/>
  Buy your card looking to the future.  Do NOT buy Voodoo - 3dfx and their &quot;our way or the highway&quot; attitude is finally catching up to them, and games are coming out that no longer support Voodoo.  Good.  I am fed up with arrogant hardware manufacturers. <br/>
<br/>
  Riva and the TNT/GE Force is the way to go.  The cards are faster than Voodoo, and games will soon be taking advantage of all the GE Force has to offer. <br/>

    online and buy one since I still use a banshee<br/>
    card....now this is making me do a double take.<br/>
<br/>

    &gt; I have a GeForece256 DDR and EQ has told me they<br/>
    &gt; don&#39;t offically support it, it isn&#39;t as good as my<br/>
    &gt; VOODOO2, my friend had the same experience.   GRRRR<br/>
    &gt; EQ makes me mad sometimes.<br/>
    &gt; Hopefully they will fix it.<br/>

    &gt;   have to agree with Tony B on that. had a tnt2<br/>
    &gt; ultra, and decided to try one<br/>
    &gt;   out. (didnt really think it would make that big a<br/>
    &gt; difference) There isnt<br/>
    &gt;   much difference in it, Untill you go above<br/>
    &gt; 1024X768, and then it really<br/>
    &gt;   starts to shine.  (about 20fps faster)<br/>

    &gt;   &gt; get an nvidia geforce 256 with ddr.  they are<br/>
    &gt; the best cards out now (high<br/>
    &gt;   &gt; res, works with everything).  also, nvidia has<br/>
    &gt; always had stable drivers.<br/>
