<b>Subject:</b> Where to hunt at 12? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1755467343">OK, I am almost through the horrible level 11 and looking forward to the<br/>
wonders of level 12 and the 4th circle spells it comes with.<br/>
<br/>
I have been in the process of moving the past week (and it will continue for<br/>
the next couple of days) so I haven&#39;t had time (and now lack a phone) so I<br/>
can&#39;t play as much; however, this will be fixed in a couple of days.<br/>
<br/>
This leads me to thinking about EQ and about what I should do once I get<br/>
12... so I ask you guys, what are some good suggestions on where and what to<br/>
hunt once I reach 12??<br/>
<br/>
I normally play solo or with a wizard friend of mine who is around the same<br/>
level (sometimes with a slightly bigger group) so what is good solo and what<br/>
is good for a small group.  I am a DE; therefore, I have no real desire to<br/>
go to Faydwer.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, what spell casting strategies do you guys use?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>
Azerin who can&#39;t play EQ right now so he wants to plan what he will do once<br/>
he can play again</div>
