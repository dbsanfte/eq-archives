&gt; I&#39;d be more than happy to help you out with info.  Perhaps the most<br/>
accurate<br/>
&gt; way to find out how much damage spell x does is to try it on the PVP<br/>
&gt; server...that way you can have a friend that you cast on relay exact<br/>
numbers<br/>
&gt; back.  Of course this requires an active PVP necro, do we have any of<br/>
those<br/>
&gt; on the list?  Also, I believe the damage is not static, it depends on the<br/>
&gt; level of the mob/player you cast on and their resistance levels to said<br/>
&gt; magic.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hello All<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I am currently running both a magician and a necromancer. I personally<br/>
am<br/>
&gt; &gt; the type of person that would rather know where to go and how-to do<br/>
things<br/>
&gt; &gt; rather then taking months to figure it all out myself. This is mostly<br/>
&gt; &gt; because I&#39;m busy in my RL with work, marriage etc, etc ... Thus, for me,<br/>
&gt; &gt; just keeping up in levels near my friends is hard enough, much less<br/>
&gt; running<br/>
&gt; &gt; around everywhere trying to find everything myself.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; There are a few things I find lacking in the main stream web sites info.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; A. The spell lists are out dated and don&#39;t provide the info I want. IE<br/>
&gt; they<br/>
&gt; &gt; don&#39;t say this spell does this damage for this manna, here is the ratio.<br/>
&gt; It<br/>
&gt; &gt; takes this many secs to cast with the channeling skill maxed for the<br/>
level<br/>
&gt; &gt; you first receive the spell. The necro DOT does X damage a tick for X<br/>
&gt; ticks.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I would find that kind of extra statistics helpful.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; B. Where do you buy the darn spell? No site I have found is attempting<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; &gt; keep a list of vendor locations and their inventory and pricing for some<br/>
&gt; &gt; base charisma.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; C. The above info should be integrated to include if each spell is<br/>
&gt; research<br/>
&gt; &gt; only or not. The status of research for that spell. IE broken or not.<br/>
And<br/>
&gt; if<br/>
&gt; &gt; not broken what are the components to make the spell, what book and what<br/>
&gt; &gt; lang etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
