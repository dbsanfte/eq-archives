What I found helpful along this same lines is to cast the lev 1 disease<br/>
cloud. 5 mana. On anything I want to get the faction points for. This does<br/>
only 5 damage for so, so no chance for a kill steal but it does stop a<br/>
monster from healing which has the nice benifit of being a steath DoT that<br/>
can help the real group fighting by reducing the total hps of the monster by<br/>
quite a bit. For example my pet (lev 16 spell) heals 5-10% of its hps from<br/>
just fearing the monster or my tanking DURING the fight. So I&#39;m guessing<br/>
monsters can easily heal up 10% of their hps or more in a normal warrior<br/>
melee the monster type of fight. So your stoping the healing is a nice<br/>
blessing for almost no mana. I have heard of many necro&#39;s using this simple<br/>
lev 1 spell well into the upper 20&#39;s for this effect.<br/>
