<div id="ygrps-yiv-1572031985">I have beaten red giant skeletons at 22 in Lake Rathe (with great<br/>
difficulty).  There aren&#39;t enough of them though, and the cyclops are a<br/>
pain.<br/>
<br/>
The druids can be good - again a necro can just about solo a red one (low<br/>
red anyway), the wandering ones drop up to 5 plat and FS weapons sometimes.<br/>
Best tactic I found was to send pet in, cast cancel magic to get rid of<br/>
their damage shield, heart flutter followed by heat blood, the fear and<br/>
drain (with allure on).  You will normally get dotted during the fight so<br/>
keep your health up.<br/>

&gt; i just have a few questions about hunting in the various zones.  i havent<br/>
&gt; played for a while, so i just want to see if my info is still relevant...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; a. can a 24 necro solo a giant skel (from rathe mtns)?  if not, what lvl?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; b. ive heard there have been changes to the lvls of the unkempt druids.<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; it too dangerous to hunt them at L24?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; c. is paw somewhere i should avoid for a while?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; d. have any other areas become good to hunt?  i was at the treants, and it<br/>
&gt; was rather boring.  i also only gained about one bubble of xp.<br/>
