What MAY be possible, is to have your own, and have one charmed.  But that is <br/>
a guess.  Or may be NPC only.  There is an NPC in Tox Forest that is commonly <br/>
walking around with 2 or three pets... and I have seen him walking with three <br/>
pets and two charmed PC&#39;s!!  (I was one of the PC&#39;s!!!!)<br/>
