<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1182686542">has anyone heard anything about patching the broken spells? Also the quest where your supposed to get Trumpys Irontoes head is broke, I spent 2 hrs on this quest today, finally killed the dwarf and gated before the guards got me just to give the head[actually it was meat] to the guildmaster for him to say &quot;ah your giving me dwarf meat, Thank you&quot;, well needless to say at that point I was about to loose my mind, So I called a GM and told him about the Spells [Vamp Embrace and Sum Shadows] just for him to say that he will report it and hopefully it will be addressed in a upcoming patch.......so in a nut shell were SOL! personally I think we should start making alot of noise about this, it seems to 989 that making the sun set and the moon rise is more important than getting our class&#39;s spells fixed! also If you would like the screen shots of the talk I had with this GM I would be happy to send them to you.....<br/>
<br/>
P.S. Im sure Im gonna get back some feed back from other class&#39;s in the game, all I can say is for you to try to take on 10+ level monsters with a 4th level damage spell and tell me how long you last when you have 3 of them on you...<br/>
