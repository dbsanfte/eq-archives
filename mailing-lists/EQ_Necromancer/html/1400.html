<div id="ygrps-yiv-2025251398">Ward summond works very well on them.  Just get a magician to summon your a<br/>
sword of runes for you pet.  It has a proc effect of ward summoned.  You<br/>
can probably kill them much easier with one or even 2 (if your pet can duel<br/>
weild) of these weapons.<br/>
<br/>
I ran into a group of only 2 in West Commons in the far North West corner<br/>
of the zone.  I know there are like 5 in lesserfaydark.<br/>

Yes the faction you get from killing shadowed men gives you positive<br/>
faction for the new Sol Ro zone.  Killing the inhabitants of Sol Ro zone,<br/>
will give you postive faction with shadowed men.<br/>
