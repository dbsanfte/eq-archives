<div id="ygrps-yiv-417790524">Trolls and Ogres can get to the docks through the underground tunnels.<br/>
There is a secret entrance at the South Gate (East Freeport) in the corner<br/>
of the wall to the left of the gate as you are facing it. Take the right<br/>
passage at the first 2 intersections, past a human and dwarf standing in the<br/>
passage, and through the door further down the passage. That leads to a<br/>
storeroom that leads out into the dock area. There is a guard that sometimes<br/>
patrols the docks, so be cautious.<br/>
     As to getting back on the boat in BB when you are done, without invis,<br/>
good luck. I have no clue about that one. There used to be a dwarf guard<br/>
swimming around in the water, so even if you make it to the docks, you would<br/>
still be attacked. Not sure if he is still swimming there....<br/>

&gt; nice to know once I am too BB,  but how can a Troll get to the boat?<br/>
They<br/>
&gt; are KOS in Freeport right?<br/>
&gt; What about Ogres?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Heh gonna be a pain, but jump off the boat to the right of the docks and<br/>
&gt; &gt; follow the water to it&#39;s end... Then just stay up high on the right zone<br/>
&gt; &gt; wall and walk along it all the way up it... You have about a 95% chance<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; &gt; not getting jumped that way..<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;Myself and my three troll friends are thinking of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;making a trip to Unrest. However, none of us have ever<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;been to that continent as evil players. Could you all<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;please give some hints on how to get my warrior type<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;friends safely past bb? Also, is there anyplace there<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;that we can sell? Or buy food for that matter. :)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Thank you!<br/>
