<div id="ygrps-yiv-937949628">see my previous post, then go to S Karanas and tool some aviaks, they&#39;re<br/>
heavily camped but you should be able to make quick xp and decent loot.  It<br/>
gets a tad boring after a while, but you can spice things up by zoning to<br/>
lake rathe to the south at night time and kicking some undead ass (drybones,<br/>
greater zombies) also, if you don&#39;t mind hosing your Qeynos faction, you can<br/>
fight treants in the southwest corner of S karana.  I went from 20 to 24<br/>
fighting egrets/darters/rooks (aviak) and at 24 I can easily take out<br/>
harriers that are yellow/red for a nice half bubble of xp each.  If you<br/>
aren&#39;t comfortable soloing yellow/red mobs, you can always hook up with a<br/>
warrior group and beat up avocets.  at 22, I was in a *great* party, 2<br/>
barbarian warriors, a barbarian shaman and a human rogue, we were<br/>
slaughtering avocets left and right. great xp and loot.  The avo&#39;s will drop<br/>
black pearls which jewlers buy for a hefty price.  You can easily reach 29th<br/>
lvl without ever leaving S karana.  You can sell items to centaur merchants<br/>
at their village, the only drawback is food/water and banking which to my<br/>
knowledge you have to go to either Qeynos (don&#39;t fight treants if you&#39;re<br/>
taking this option) or Grobb (lake rathe/rathe mtns/Innothule/grobb)  Good<br/>
luck!<br/>

&gt; Hello All.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m wondering where the good places to solo are from lev 20-24 and from<br/>
&gt; 24-29. I&#39;m going to be playing alot during my coming week of vacation and<br/>
&gt; will be on when my regular group of friends is at work. So I imagine I<br/>
will<br/>
&gt; be soloing alot.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Any advice is welcome. On a second note I now have the words for Harm<br/>
&gt; Shield. I am almost lev 21 but not quite. I am wondering at what level I<br/>
&gt; should make the attempt to research this assuming I have the max research<br/>
&gt; points allowed trained in the skill at each level.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks<br/>
&gt;<br/>
