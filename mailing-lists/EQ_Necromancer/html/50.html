<div id="ygrps-yiv-1261025232">This guy is correct.  Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve done... just keep killing<br/>
skels and auction that you are looking for a great worn staff, but DON&#39;T<br/>
forget about your piercing.  I&#39;d trade off every level, just purchase a<br/>
normal (nonrusty) dagger and every level swap weapons to keep yourself<br/>
sharp.  After a bit... say anywhere between 8 and 14th level, go to Splitpaw<br/>
Dungeon and grab a Runed Totem Staff off the dead body of a Gnoll shaman or<br/>
high shaman.  Splitpaw is for 5-15 people but bring a group cause they like<br/>
to mass attack you with greens.  That&#39;ll hold you till you are around 17+<br/>
level... then you should go get a like-leveled group, go to Befallen, skag a<br/>
Gossimer Robe AND a Dagger of Menkar down there.  I may have screwed up the<br/>
name of the dagger.  The cool thing about the dagger is you don&#39;t HAVE to<br/>
wield it to get the benefits.  Store it in the RANGED weapon slot, I never<br/>
use that slot anyway, but if you do maybe I wouldn&#39;t store it there...<br/>
nothing like wasting that dagger.<br/>
<br/>
	After that, I have no clue.  I heard a certain gator in Oasis<br/>
carries the next generation in staves, the glowing wooden crook, but I have<br/>
no stats and I know the mob is at least level 20.<br/>

&gt; &gt; working on my staff skill.  are the later better weapons <br/>
&gt; all staff based, or<br/>
&gt; &gt;  are there some good high level necro usable daggers out <br/>
&gt; there?  I just <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt;  want to wait too long and have my staff skill near <br/>
&gt; impossible to get up.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  also, one handed or two handed staves?  with my luck i&#39;ll <br/>
&gt; take a two hander<br/>
&gt; &gt;  and all the magic necro staves will be one handed &lt;grins&gt; <br/>
&gt; anyhow, that&#39;s it<br/>
&gt; &gt;  from me for a while.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It does not hurt to put 1 training in both blunt skills, then <br/>
&gt; when you pick <br/>
&gt; something up you can start training in it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Two handed blunt is the best as the great staff is very nice.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There is an item in the game, I think a necro dagger, that <br/>
&gt; has a higher base <br/>
&gt; damage and better speed than a base worn staff, and a higher <br/>
&gt; damage over time <br/>
&gt; than any staff I have seen.  It also does random poison <br/>
&gt; &quot;crits&quot; which of <br/>
&gt; course help.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think it is found in Nejena though... so it is not <br/>
&gt; something to get at low <br/>
&gt; levels...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just my two cents.<br/>
