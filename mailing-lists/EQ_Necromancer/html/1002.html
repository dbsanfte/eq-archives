<div id="ygrps-yiv-1298279157">Hello everyone.<br/>
<br/>
I have posted the 2 check lists I use personally (one for research, one of<br/>
spells).<br/>
<br/>
If you are interested they are at:<br/>

<br/>
Down the road I am planning on building a JAVA spell database that you can<br/>
do things like say, give me all the DD spells, or give me all the DOT<br/>
spells. etc. With these results liked to info pages for each spell that has<br/>
all the goodies like type, duration, damage, efficiency ratio etc. But that<br/>
will be awhile.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also planning on gathering up and publishing a bunch of &quot;tactics&quot;<br/>
reviews. IE. The DoT, Pet, DoT, DoT, Fear, Tap, Tap method I used to use. OR<br/>
the one I currently use. DoT, Pet, Dot, Fear, DoT, Shock, Shock method. But<br/>
in a lot more detail of course including things like where best to use, what<br/>
to do if you encounter spell resists during the process or you get jumped<br/>
mid fight etc.<br/>
<br/>
Hope some of you out there find this useful. If I get enough people saying<br/>
they are interested, I&#39;ll also post as I add major new pieces.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
<br/>
