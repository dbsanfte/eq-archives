<div id="ygrps-yiv-1223133925">Hello again,<br/>
<br/>
Nope you do not get KoS if you go to the bank in Freeport. I know because I<br/>
go there and I am a gnome Necro myself.<br/>
<br/>
For the guild well when you go out of the west gate , turn right (if you are<br/>
facing the desert) and follow the wall.... (the wall will be to your right)<br/>
Just when you will meet the wall in front of you (the L part of it) you just<br/>
go through the wall in a secret passage.... The music changes and I like it!<br/>
anyways.... Just keep going straight until you reach a room where there&#39;s an<br/>
exit in front of you and to your right...... go to the one on your right and<br/>
just follow the path... The necro guild loies ahead.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun!<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps!<br/>
<br/>

  Subject: [EQ_Necromancer] FREEPORT NECRO guild is where?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  2 questions . . .   I am a gnome necromancer . ..<br/>
<br/>
  1) Can I go to the bank in freeport and get money for necro guild or will<br/>
I be KOS in bank zone.   (Ins&#39;t the bank in North Freeport?)<br/>
<br/>
  2) If I wanted to play it safe, get my money from Akkanon bank then take<br/>
boat to Freeport, HOW DO I GET to the NECROGUILD from the outside.  So guy<br/>
told me there is a passage from the wall in west free port that goes into<br/>
the necro guild from outside and I was wondering if anyone could give me<br/>
specifics on oing this.</div>
