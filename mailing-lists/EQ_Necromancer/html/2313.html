corpse is bare, lasts a half hour, and is only there so someone can rez you<br/>
in case you&#39;d otherwise have a long trip back to the zone. <br/>

You also don&#39;t lose xp for dying until 11th.<br/>

&gt; They are not the primary damage dealers. They are meant to<br/>
&gt; absorb, block, parry damage. They also get a skill called<br/>
&gt; &quot;protect&quot;, which acts as a detaunt on the person they place it<br/>
&gt; on. This keeps the Mobs smacking the guy in plate armor, and<br/>
&gt; not the caster or cleric in cloth or chain.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They have this in EQ, too, you know. It&#39;s a warrior discipline, or was it<br/>
skill, called &quot;shield&quot;, or something like that, where the tank takes partial<br/>
damage for another group member.<br/>
<br/>
This is also new within the last year. <br/>
