<div id="ygrps-yiv-1393541210">Both items are a piece of cake to get.<br/>
<br/>
To get the scepter in lguk, how i get to it is go through scryer room<br/>
towards jail and hang every right until you zone.  You&#39;ll need to make sure<br/>
you take a right when you go up some stair like things with spiders on them.<br/>
Once you zone, travel to you take a left or right, take a left and soon<br/>
you&#39;ll be going up some stairs near a waterfall, turn in room on right, pick<br/>
up scepter, and your done.<br/>
<br/>
To get the scepter in mistmoore, take a right where the gargoyles spawn and<br/>
follow path till you see a gate on left, go through gate straight into tome<br/>
(building), pick up the sack on the casket which is a flower, go straight<br/>
back out (going straight in and straight out is important because i hear<br/>
there are traps on either side of the casket, but was unwilling to try this<br/>
out for myself : ).  Go out the door from the tome and go behind the<br/>
building you&#39;ll see a named shadowman, give him the flower and you have the<br/>
scepter.<br/>
<br/>
The hardest part of the quest, in my opinion (although I never died doing<br/>
it, but another nec lost a lot of exp doing it) is getting the globe of<br/>
shadow in guk.  I was and still am 30th, (i&#39;ve going back and forth from<br/>
31st killing shadowmen) so that may make a difference in how we finally<br/>
broke into the room.  But to get to the spawn, I went to lguk were we got<br/>
the scepter and at the top of the waterfalls, follow the water up stream,<br/>
you&#39;ll need breath of the dead for this, and hang every right, you&#39;ll<br/>
eventually zone back into guk.  When you reach the end of the river you&#39;ll<br/>
see an island in the middle of the water with 3 froggies on it.  There are 3<br/>
planks on the island, the one that goes in the direction that you were just<br/>
swimming is another entrance to lguk, the one to your left you don&#39;t care<br/>
about (or at least i didn&#39;t) and the one on the right is where the nokta<br/>
shaman spawns.  Our group had to get a high level nec in to help us break<br/>
the spawn, because we weren&#39;t able to cast pets at the entrance to this room<br/>
since we were too close to about 6 froggies (the ones on the island and the<br/>
ones in the room), once we broke the spawn, it took about 3 hours to get 3<br/>
globes.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck<br/>

I was in the temple yesterday and the NPC said that the scepter of sorrow<br/>
from mistmoore, for the boot quest. The scepter of tears is for the gloves.<br/>
<br/>
Now, if anyone can fill me in on what NPC gives these two items up in their<br/>
respective locations I would really appreciate it.<br/>
