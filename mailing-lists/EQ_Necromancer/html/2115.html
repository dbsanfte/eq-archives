<b>Subject:</b> Re: [EQ_Necromancer] Cable Modem question <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-407547436">Well in my area DSL is 256kbs, and I a bit of a ways from my phone company.<br/>
We&#39;ve had it in my city for about 9 months, and finally got it out this far<br/>
last week. Will this affect my speeds? Also cable is 2mbs here minimum. I<br/>
heard cable probably won&#39;t raise much, but DSL will so it can be upgraded<br/>
easily. Also, I take it I can talk and surf on 1 phone line with DSL right?<br/>
Thanks again =)<br/>
