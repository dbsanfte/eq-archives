<div id="ygrps-yiv-1022214652">I&#39;m have a lvl 5 Dark elf necro currently over in Grobb (not bound yet)<br/>
Can anyone give me some helpful hints for getting to lvl 8 in a rapid<br/>
manner while accumulating enough money to afford the spells?  In<br/>
Nektulous I seemed to be dying a lot and never getting much wealth so I<br/>
went to Innothule Swamp to collect bone chips for awhile.  All help<br/>
would appreciated.<br/>
