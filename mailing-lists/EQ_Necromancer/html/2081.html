<div id="ygrps-yiv-674277444">Well its not so much as you dont use pets.  It is more a matter of <br/>
controling pets.<br/>
When you going into a dungoen your pet follows you but is behind you ... now <br/>
at this point you are changing direction and moving ...pet lags behind and <br/>
sometimes goes a different route ...bringing lots of dugoen friends to you.  <br/>
<br/>
necro tip - 1. dont make a pet walking around unless you are moving really <br/>
really slow <br/>
                2. make a hot key that says /pet back off  and /pet get lost <br/>
if your DE don&#39;t forget you can use HIDE but ot always reliable<br/>
<br/>
  Now once you are in your &quot;spot&quot;  feel free to make a pet but if a mob <br/>
starts to run .... your pets follows and ......brings lots of dungeon <br/>
friends. <br/>

 I have some questions about adventuring in a <br/>
 dungeon.  I have been told not to bring a pet <br/>
 into a dungeon because it was dangerous.  I <br/>
 assume this is because the pet will chase <br/>
 foes running away and cause trains.  Is this <br/>
 true?  <br/>
 <br/>
 Also, if I can&#39;t bring a pet, how do I fight <br/>
 in the dungeon?  Are my soloing days over and <br/>
 I have to join a group?   &gt;&gt;</div>
