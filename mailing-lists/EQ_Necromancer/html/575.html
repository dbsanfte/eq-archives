<div id="ygrps-yiv-1580790359">Rune Totem Staff is a good idea, but you are definately going to have to<br/>
wait on the robes, unless you have a bunch of high level friends.  Najena&#39;s<br/>
flowing black robe is generally gotten by a group of level 30&#39;s, and the<br/>
Gossamer robe by 20-mid 20&#39;s (I think).<br/>
<br/>
RTS is anywhere from 20 pp to 40 pp (I wouldn&#39;t pay more than 25)<br/>
I have heard of the FBR being sold for 300-500 pp.... WOW<br/>
Dunno about Gossamer robe</div>
