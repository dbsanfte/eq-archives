Subject: [EQ_Necromancer] Levels <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hi folks....<br/>
I play a Errudite Necro....level 6 now on the Tallon Zek pvp teams server.<br/>
Can someone give me a few ideas for the next few<br/>
levels?  Seems that the Forest outside of Paineel can be brutal for a level<br/>
6.  I have been just forming small groups and nailing the abandoned heretic<br/>
pet, and soloing skeles....till of course it seems that word goes out Im<br/>
solo or in a small group, and next thing I know I have 4 skeletons beating<br/>
on me.<br/>
I went over to Qeynos once, but, on the PvP server it was a bit to risky for<br/>
a 6th level, same as Black Burrow.<br/>
I considered heading over to Everfrost, but, was a bit worried about long<br/>
corpse runs.....so, I headed back to Tox forest.<br/>
Actually, as I am new to playing a necro....any hints, tip, ideas, help<br/>
would be great.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
