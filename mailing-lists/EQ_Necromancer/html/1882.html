<div id="ygrps-yiv-1898339387">Ever feel like you&#39;re the pet and Gobantik is the real PC.  I mean you pull<br/>
for Gobantik, you buff Gobantik, you heal Gobantik, you furnish Gobantik<br/>
with weapons, you make it easy for Gobantik to kill the mob with things like<br/>
DoT&#39;s and Fear and Root.  Gobantik doesn&#39;t have to waste time running all<br/>
over Norrath, you carry him safely in your backpack until its time to kill<br/>
something.  Think Gobantik ever cons you and thinks, &quot;Damn, I got a blue<br/>
Necromancer this time!&quot;?  Yeah sure, Gobantik talks like a kiss up, but he<br/>
knows who is really in charge!<br/>
