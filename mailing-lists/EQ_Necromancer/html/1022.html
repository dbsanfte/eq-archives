<div id="ygrps-yiv-1294776009">On the topic of words, I&#39;ve been trying all weekend to get dissemination and<br/>
parasitism for Vampiric Wave/Curse/whatever they call it now.  Has anyone<br/>
researched this 29th lvl spell successfully?  And if so, were you happy that<br/>
you did?  Or should I forget about it?</div>
