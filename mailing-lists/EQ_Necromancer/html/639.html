<div id="ygrps-yiv-1374730813">No its not in the clirics guild. Goto the wizards guild to get lesser shealding. Also to the necro that made his way to Grobb and got him self bound there by a fellow necro. All I have to say is thanks for the recognition. That was very kind of you.<br/>

    I am a lvl 11 DE Necro on Povar and have combed Neriak for the lvl 8 spell &quot;Lesser Shielding&quot;. I assume that it is located in the Clerics guild but cannot find it. Has anyone had any luck locating this spell? Thanks for any help! <br/>
