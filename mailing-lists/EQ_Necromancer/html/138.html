<div id="ygrps-yiv-919458389">Greetings All.<br/>
I am Shaopaul from the land of Innoruuk. Having recently acquired the the<br/>
16th rank, I am experiencing some difficulty in finding the spells required<br/>
for my trade. I am a gnome necromancer who was born and raised in Akanon. I<br/>
have just returned from travels to Qeynos to purchase all of the level 16<br/>
spells. The guild had:<br/>
Cure Disease<br/>
Cancel Magic<br/>
Shielding<br/>
Heart Flutter<br/>
Shieldskin<br/>
Spirit Armour<br/>
<br/>
Regretfully, the guild does not have<br/>
Resltess Bones!!!<br/>
Banshee Aura<br/>
Feign Death<br/>
Hungry Earth.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone knows where these spells can be found, please let me know. I have<br/>
searched all of Akanon and am losing the life that once drove me. My undying<br/>
gratitude to any who answer the call.<br/>
<br/>
Shaopaul</div>
