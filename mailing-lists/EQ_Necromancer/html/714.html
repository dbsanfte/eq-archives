<b>Subject:</b> Necromancers and Races <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1399031689">I have been recently considering the possibility of starting a<br/>
necromancer character and ran into a few problems. Originally, I ruled<br/>
out playing evil characters because the group of characters I will be<br/>
playing with the most frequently are all good races and entering towns<br/>
with them would be impossible. Can a necromancer of a good race enter<br/>
the town of other good races without fear of death? If not, it might not<br/>
<br/>
be as bad as I had originally thought to play an evil necromancer,<br/>
specifically a dark elf.<br/>
   What the pros and cons are of playing an erudite necromancer? or a<br/>
gnomish necromancer? or a dark elf necromancer?<br/>
I would appreciates anyone&#39;s input on this subject.<br/>
Thanks</div>
