<div id="ygrps-yiv-602181762">There is a &quot;bug&quot; where if you sneak, you can use merchants/bankers that are<br/>
dubious, not sure about threatening or scowling though...you have to be<br/>
standing *behind* them for it to work and I&#39;ve never tested it with invis<br/>
but I&#39;m pretty sure the target creature has to be dubious.  *but* Even if<br/>
you could get the cloak off the enchanter in najena...are you about to<br/>
attempt infiltrating Felwithe while invis?  Sounds like suicide to me, not<br/>
to mention a nightmare of a corpse recovery mission.  Get a molten cloak ;)<br/>
and make up the 1 int somewhere else.<br/>

&gt; hi !<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I heard from some sources (not sure where since i already deleted the<br/>
mail) that<br/>
&gt; quests are able to be completed while under Invisibility .<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; They stated examples by completing the Mystic Cloak quest<br/>
&gt; (8ac +5int +5sv magic 10 charges SteelSkin) .<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A few days later i attempted to try this out myself by camping<br/>
&gt; the Priest of Najena in Unrest . It was a 52 min spawn and more<br/>
&gt; often than not spawns a regular Ghoul as a placeholder (PH).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; After 16 long hours of waiting in line (only 2 spawned) and getting<br/>
&gt; the component off the Priest i made off to Najena to complete part<br/>
&gt; 1 of the quest . unfortunately when i tried to give it to the NPC while<br/>
&gt; invis , it broke the invisibility and i was charmed and killed by the NPC<br/>
&gt; (who is a High Elf Enchanter btw) .<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Has anybody else attempted to complete this quest ?<br/>
&gt; or does anyone have confirmation if quests can be completed<br/>
&gt; while invis ? pls email me directly as I dont always get the time<br/>
&gt; to read all this list mails...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; regards,<br/>
