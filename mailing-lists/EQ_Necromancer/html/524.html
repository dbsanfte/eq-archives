<div id="ygrps-yiv-1614015014">I do the same thing, except that its tougher and tougher to do.  The<br/>
monsters get smarter and smarter, and soon you&#39;ll find you can&#39;t stand toe<br/>
to toe with them.  I believe the 16-20 range to be the high end of the &quot;get<br/>
in with your pet&quot; area for Necromancers.  Try Aviak guards in Lake<br/>
Rathetear, or try heading to the palace area of Upper Guk.  One hit and the<br/>
monster frenzies on YOU, believe me, its not pretty Vampiric Embrace or not,<br/>
plus you start hitting less and less as the monster&#39;s defenses go up<br/>
exponentially compared to yours.  With a Runed Totem Staff a 65 in 2HB and<br/>
57 in Offense I can an Aviak Guard 1 out of 5 times.  With a Dagger I do a<br/>
little better simply because I strike more often.<br/>
<br/>
	The real key here is anything you attempt to do solo can be done<br/>
MUCH easier in a group.  Why step in at all?  Send the pet in with the<br/>
tanks, use your spells sparingly, and keep watch for runners and surprises.<br/>
I&#39;ve done a lot of both (solo&#39;ing and grouping) and even with the group XP<br/>
split, you can clean through many many more blues than by yourself.  Its<br/>
like harvesting.  You stay out in the field longer and thus garner more XP.<br/>
Grouping also does better against the &quot;X&quot; Factor (that chance that another<br/>
mob comes along, or this mob runs and calls for help, basically anything<br/>
where suddenly you&#39;ve bitten off more than you can chew) and survivability<br/>
as long as everyone in the group knows their place.  A good group will net<br/>
you more than anything.  A bad group can destroy everything.<br/>
<br/>
	Another thing, loot order.  At our levels, personally I don&#39;t see a<br/>
big deal, I&#39;m usually hunting for unique items.  I usually say I&#39;ll forgo<br/>
normal loot but I WANT item X if we happen to get one.  If I need cash I&#39;ll<br/>
harvest West Commonlands or kill Aviak Guards in Lake Rathetear, or mooch<br/>
off my rich smithing friend. ;)<br/>

&gt; I keep wondering why more people aren&#39;t using vampiric <br/>
&gt; embrace. I use it<br/>
&gt; constantly while I&#39;m fighting. When you accidentally get two creatures<br/>
&gt; instead of one, you need to be able to help your pet from taking some<br/>
&gt; damage. I DOT the badguys, then step in so that when the mob <br/>
&gt; faces me, my<br/>
&gt; pet is striking their backs. With vampiric embrace running, <br/>
&gt; sucking in 30 HP<br/>
&gt; every now and then, I can stand and fight much longer than I <br/>
&gt; would have been<br/>
&gt; able to without it. Your pet is dealing the serious damage at up to 46<br/>
&gt; magical damage per round (I&#39;m level 18) but, my own 18 damage <br/>
&gt; hitting 2 out<br/>
&gt; of three times is nothing to laugh at either. In the course <br/>
&gt; of a fight, I<br/>
&gt; will dish out over 100 damage to the creature, which is <br/>
&gt; significant, and my<br/>
&gt; pet will hit harder and more often with the back attack bonuses. The<br/>
&gt; vampiric embrace flare that happens about one in 5 hits is a <br/>
&gt; godsend, and<br/>
&gt; sometimes it flares so often that my health doesn&#39;t drop much <br/>
&gt; at all. Losing<br/>
&gt; health is nothing to worry about, either. I have 350 HP after <br/>
&gt; I buff myself,<br/>
&gt; and I can handle a lot of abuse. Combined with the occasional <br/>
&gt; Life drain,<br/>
&gt; there&#39;s nothing I enjoy more than good hand to hand combat. <br/>
&gt; And on a final<br/>
&gt; note, when my pet does die through poor tactics on my part, <br/>
&gt; it&#39;s nice to be<br/>
&gt; able to stand toe to toe with the beast and finish him off <br/>
&gt; because I have<br/>
&gt; good defence, offence, and 2HB skills. Necromancers are made <br/>
&gt; to fight and we<br/>
&gt; can be very effective at it. Give it a try. To those of you <br/>
&gt; who ask &quot;Who<br/>
&gt; wants to stand toe to toe with a level (whatever) mob?&quot; The <br/>
&gt; answer is &quot;I<br/>
&gt; do.&quot; And I&#39;ll be beaming a smile while I do it.<br/>

&gt; &gt;     Its still hotly debated.  Basically as far as anyone <br/>
&gt; knows, the only<br/>
&gt; &gt; thing DEX does is increase your ability to recover while <br/>
&gt; spellcasting, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; THAT&#39;S IT.  How important is this?  No clue, I haven&#39;t <br/>
&gt; researched this<br/>
&gt; &gt; extensively.  Basically if this is the case then you <br/>
&gt; probably don&#39;t need<br/>
&gt; &gt; much DEX.  The REAL primary attribute is INT, through and <br/>
&gt; through.  INT<br/>
&gt; &gt; directly affects how much mana you have, thus how much <br/>
&gt; longer you stay in<br/>
&gt; &gt; the field before meditating.  We&#39;ve discussed this before, <br/>
&gt; but basically<br/>
&gt; &gt; having as much INT as possible is probably the best way to <br/>
&gt; go.  After<br/>
&gt; that,<br/>
&gt; &gt; dumping your remaining points is up to you.  You aren&#39;t a <br/>
&gt; fighter, so<br/>
&gt; &gt; putting points into Agility seems useless, most monsters <br/>
&gt; will be hitting<br/>
&gt; you<br/>
&gt; &gt; and hitting you hard anyway.  Same goes for Stamina, you&#39;ll <br/>
&gt; never have the<br/>
&gt; &gt; hitpoints of even a Rogue, so seriously what&#39;s another <br/>
&gt; hitpoint per level?<br/>
&gt; &gt; Say you&#39;re level 25 and have 25 extra hitpoints?  Well <br/>
&gt; sadly level 25<br/>
&gt; &gt; monsters are probably doing close to 40-90 points of damage per hit<br/>
&gt; anyway,<br/>
&gt; &gt; so MAYBE one more hit.  Don&#39;t get hit.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I might say its more important for wizards as they don&#39;t have pets,<br/>
&gt; &gt; but they should be in groups anyway.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Basically I know one solid thing.  Multiples of 5 in your INT is<br/>
&gt; &gt; good and the more you can get the better you are.  If you <br/>
&gt; are looking at a<br/>
&gt; &gt; choice between a +3 AGI item and a +1 INT item you should <br/>
&gt; take the INT<br/>
&gt; item.<br/>
&gt; &gt; There are many  INT increasing items in the game for <br/>
&gt; virtually all armor<br/>
&gt; &gt; slots garnering you probably more than 20 more INT points, <br/>
&gt; which is 4 more<br/>
&gt; &gt; mana per level (and at level 25, that would equate to <br/>
&gt; having another 100<br/>
&gt; &gt; mana to play with)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hit the INT hard, then dump whatever you have left somewhere, heck,<br/>
&gt; &gt; maybe in STRENGTH so you can carry more.<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Why is dex our main attrib beside INT if we rarely go hand to hand?<br/>
&gt; &gt; (I know we have a touch spell, but most people say that is more for<br/>
&gt; &gt; shadowknights)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I am mad I put my extra (after maxing int) points into dex <br/>
&gt; now when I read<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; million posts now that say Dex is useless.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I mean from all I&#39;ve read AGILITY is 100 times better for <br/>
&gt; any caster!!!!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Please say it ain&#39;t so, and that my 100 dex (gnome) isn&#39;t a <br/>
&gt; big frekin&#39;<br/>
&gt; &gt; waste . . .<br/>
