<div id="ygrps-yiv-532255115">i know there are SoW boots in Najena, but they are a rather difficult find <br/>
(one of the three mages at the end of Najena has them sometimes).  i know <br/>
what you mean about how good it would be for solo.  this weekend i had to <br/>
tank a young kodiak at 1/2 hp and i had no mana.  nice to know i can do it <br/>
if i have to, but i barely won. i was almost toast by the time he turned <br/>
tail and tried to get away!<br/>

&gt;I have a question for you all. Where the hell Aviaks In Lake Rathe.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also I have saved up 37 skill points for resurch. I was told by someone <br/>
&gt;that<br/>
&gt;when they got to level 16 they could only train once in that skill. Ok dont<br/>
&gt;make me cry. Let me down softly. Is it true?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;One last question. I need to find out if this is rumor or true. S O W<br/>
&gt;rings(spirit of the wolf) do they realy exsist. Or is this just another<br/>
&gt;rumor to make us lower levels drool. If any one knows anything on this I<br/>
&gt;would like info. Being a necro with out doge to level 22, when a pet dies<br/>
&gt;god you got be able to run. I hate it when your pet dies for a stupied<br/>
&gt;resason and a blue uper hand kills you. Grrrr!!<br/>
