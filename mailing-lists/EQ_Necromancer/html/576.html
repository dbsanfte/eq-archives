<div id="ygrps-yiv-2001347443">I would definately go to Lavastorm, and you can stay there for the next 4<br/>
levels, at least.  The experience is great, the loot is wonderful, there are<br/>
words to be found here, and it is grossly underpopulated.  Just make sure<br/>
you either have a summoned dagger for your skeleton or it is level 12, since<br/>
there are many magical creatures here.  It also helps to have a RTS with<br/>
vampiric embrace.</div>
