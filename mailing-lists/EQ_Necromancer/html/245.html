<div id="ygrps-yiv-1794911180">This is a little interesting, you can give the command without typing the <br/>
/pet. I was demonstrating how to do it to a newbie, and I simply typed <br/>
&quot;Jekn, you may sit down now.&quot; and he sat. Wierd. I tried variations on this <br/>
too, like &quot;Jekn, sit down.&quot; etc.<br/>

for those that do not know, instead of having your pet sit, you can give the<br/>
command /pet stand up (even though he is allready standing).  This will keep <br/>
him<br/>
from wandering off or &quot;guarding&quot; an area.<br/>
My problem with having a pet sit down is that they will not defend you if <br/>
you<br/>
are attacked (especially nice when your meditating).  If he is standing, he <br/>
will<br/>
defend you.  Just watch out though, if you fight somewhere and he comes <br/>
running<br/>
to help, when the fight is over, you have to give the command &quot;/pet follow <br/>
me&quot;<br/>
to get him back to your spot or he will continue to stand in the spot that <br/>
the<br/>
last action took place.<br/>
