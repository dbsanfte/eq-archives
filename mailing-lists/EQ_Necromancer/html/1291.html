<div id="ygrps-yiv-1302404578">Myself and my three troll friends are thinking of<br/>
making a trip to Unrest. However, none of us have ever<br/>
been to that continent as evil players. Could you all<br/>
please give some hints on how to get my warrior type<br/>
friends safely past bb? Also, is there anyplace there<br/>
that we can sell? Or buy food for that matter. :)<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!<br/>
