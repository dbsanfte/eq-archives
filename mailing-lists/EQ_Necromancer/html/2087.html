<b>Subject:</b> Cable Modem question <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1358138606">Hi folks,<br/>
<br/>
I recently moved to a neighborhood where Roadrunner Cable Modem service is<br/>
available.  I was going to just keep my 56K dialup connection, but due to<br/>
the phone wiring in the neighborhood (paired-back copper more than 15000<br/>
feet from a substation) the highest connection speed I can get is 26.4K.<br/>
<br/>
My question is this:  Other than the fact that a cable modem connection<br/>
slows down with each additional person logged in, are there any known issues<br/>
with running a cable modem and playing Everquest?<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, will this faster connection actually benefit me in any way (with<br/>
regard to playing Everquest)?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for the info.<br/>
<br/>
