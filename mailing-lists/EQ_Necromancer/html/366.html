<div id="ygrps-yiv-300470608">Once you tick the creature off, numb isn&#39;t going to do a whole lot, it&#39;s a<br/>
preventative spell, say there are 2 skele&#39;s that you want to take down, but<br/>
you can only take one at a time. numb one so it won&#39;t attack you while you<br/>
kill the other one.  Be careful though, more often than not the spell will<br/>
fail when you most need it and both mobs will be angry at you.<br/>

&gt;     Simple question about this one.  When is it effective and when is it<br/>
&gt; not?  I cast it on some skeletons that were attacking others in Befallen,<br/>
&gt; and it said that it appeared...well, I forget the word that it uses, but<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; was successful.  However the creature continued to smack the player<br/>
around.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     So.. does it slow the attacks, or just not work while it&#39;s fighting<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; just needs to be cast on the creature while it&#39;s still just standing or<br/>
&gt; wandering around?  Or would it have been something else that immediatly<br/>
&gt; ticked it off again?  The player, in one instance, was just running and<br/>
not<br/>
&gt; swinging back.  I didn&#39;t have enough for a Ward nor wanted to chance<br/>
ticking<br/>
&gt; it off and being smacked around myself.  Thanks folks.<br/>
