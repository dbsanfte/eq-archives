<b>Subject:</b> Re: where do I hunt at 5th lvl? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1111326074">ive been in feydwer for about a week. (im a de necro)  its quite nice, the <br/>
orcs dont attack me at all.  ive even wandered thru crushbone and not been <br/>
attacked by anything.  me and my friend were scaring people into thinking <br/>
that i was Dvinn!  that was really funny.<br/>
<br/>
my solution, dont kill orcs.  ive been killing some faeries, and that seems <br/>
to boost your rep with the orcs.  killing orcs (crushbone orcs, that is) <br/>
lowers your faction with several groups, but most importantly (for me) is <br/>
the Indigo Brotherhood, which is, i believe, the neriak warrior guild, and <br/>
hence the guards.<br/>
<br/>
anyone hunt in lesser feydark?  i cant seem to find any strong wasps to <br/>
fight...<br/>

&gt;The only problem with going to crushbone as a necro, is the orcs there are<br/>
&gt;allied with Nerriak...hence causing you a big problem later on down the<br/>
&gt;road.<br/>

&gt;   I had a gnome magician once. When I got to 5 I left Steamfont. You CAN<br/>
&gt;still find rogue clockworks outside the newbie area, but you have to<br/>
&gt;constantly dodge young ebony drakes and things.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;     I made 5th lvl last night and my little gnome necro is doing fine, but <br/>
&gt;I<br/>
&gt;can see now I am starting to get too powerful w/ my big Skeleton buddy for<br/>
&gt;the kolbolds.  They CON Black and when I was 4th I was taking on 2 yellows<br/>
&gt;and winning! I love being a necromancer.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     Anyway where can I go to find L5-9 MOBs in STEAMFONT???<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     Thanks!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
