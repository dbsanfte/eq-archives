<div id="ygrps-yiv-1551832410">at lvl 10, you should be able to solo tarantulas/scarabs in north ro with<br/>
little trouble...usually taking out 2 before resting. just be sure there&#39;s<br/>
nothing else around (pumas really like to mess with you while you&#39;re<br/>
fighting) I&#39;d also suggest lavastorm, just beware of the higher beasties.<br/>
Lava crawlers won&#39;t attack you unless they see you fighting something else.<br/>
The elementals are probably a bit to tough, but you should be able to take<br/>
the odd fire drake.  I went from 8 to 12 in a matter of days in Nro, it&#39;s a<br/>
little tedious fighting the same mobs over and over, but the investment pays<br/>
off with quick leveling.  My strat on these big beasties was to draw them in<br/>
with clinging darkness, slowing them down and giving me time to hit them<br/>
with a disease cloud so they wouldn&#39;t heal.  Pet should be on them by now,<br/>
cast a poison bolt then step in to take a little heat off your pet.  Step<br/>
back if need be and lifetap etc, the key to this is having the highest pet<br/>
possible.  at 10th you should be able to cast a blue risky pet that does 14<br/>
damage.  I test my pet on little beasties first to make sure he gets that<br/>
all important 14 damage strike.  If he hits for 10/12, reclaim energy and<br/>
try again.  A healthy pet is key to your rapid advancement.<br/>

I&#39;ve been stuck at level 10 for a week now! Its not as bad as the hellish<br/>
level 7 (I was there for 16 days) but it is still bad! I tried Lrodd.... I<br/>
am NOT doing that again. I beat him ONE TIME out of the several times I<br/>
fought him, and for that one time I lost a pet with a twohanded sword, had<br/>
no mana, and was at less than a bar of health. For all this, I got SO LITTLE<br/>
XP THE BAR DIDN&quot;T CHANGE! And this was solo without a pet! The other times<br/>
Lrodd just kicked my ass.  I&#39;ve tried WC but Kodies jump me and kill me<br/>
while I fight YKs. I&#39;ve tried Kithicor, but the Ghouls jump me and kill me.<br/>
I&#39;ve tried Nro and the xp is sooo bad there. Guk is a joke. Either too hard<br/>
or too easy. Innothule is worse, its ALL green there. The orc camps are<br/>
worthless. I can&#39;t find a group to hunt with, so the Dervishes are out.  EC<br/>
I tried (again) and while fighting a lion a Cent jumped me. I ran past 4<br/>
people macroing &quot;HELP ME!! HELP ME!!&quot; and they did nothing. The cent got me.<br/>
I went back out, fought a blue lion, and an even one came up and attacked my<br/>
pet. I gated away and logged, utterly frustrated at having lost a bar and a<br/>
half of xp in two days. If I keep up like this, I am going to be level 9<br/>
AGAIN. Please, someone help me! Where can I hunt solo w/pet at level 10?!<br/>
