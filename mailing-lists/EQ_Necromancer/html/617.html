<div id="ygrps-yiv-33692248">you dont really miss out on much, just a tiny bit of experience (and the <br/>
robe, of course).  the ac isnt that hot anyway, tho.  to be honest with you, <br/>
i would either<br/>
a. create a new character. this is good if you havent invested much time <br/>
into your first one, or<br/>
b. dont worry about it.  since the reward isnt that great after all. i was <br/>
in much the same situation in the beta test, so i did it right in the final <br/>
release, so i know it isnt much.  and i did end up with a body i couldnt <br/>
recover, so no robe twice =)  but you can buy one later anyway.  the color <br/>
also made my body harder to find.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hello all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;d just like to say I finally bought EQ after everyone at my work,<br/>
&gt;and all my friends have made me sick about raving about it.  Well, I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;in a little bit of a bind.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I just started out and died when I finally reached my Guild house.<br/>
&gt;Unfortunately I couldn&#39;t get my corpse and have lost my note I was<br/>
&gt;supposed to hand to the necromancer there.  I hear from my friends<br/>
&gt;that I should get a robe or something, but I don&#39;t have the note.  Is<br/>
&gt;there any way to get a new note or something?  None of the stores<br/>
&gt;nearby will sell me anything because I&#39;m a necromancer, so I&#39;d like to<br/>
&gt;get this one.    Also is there anything else I am missing out on by<br/>
&gt;not completing this quest?  I mean,  I&#39;m sure I can eventually find a<br/>
&gt;robe somewhere,  I just don&#39;t want to miss out on a bunch of stuff.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanx<br/>
