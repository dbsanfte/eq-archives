  There&#39;s no good answer to that.  Basically any race that is a necromancer besides a Dark Elf Necromancer will have problems anywhere.  The good thing is usually you aren&#39;t KOS everywhere (cept mage&#39;s guilds and whatnot)  Dark Elves are KOS in a lot of places and Dark Elf Necromancers have prices on their heads in almost all places.  The good thing about being a Dark Elf Necromancer is that you are fine in your city and the Troll and Ogre cities.  Everyone will do business with you and no one is KOS.<br/>
   <br/>
  Personally I think its a matter of preference.  Non Dark Elf Necromancers have access to a LOT more areas, but generally have a harder time dealing with EVERYONE whereas Dark Elves are totally blocked out of some areas but in South Antonica they have NO problems.  And believe me, there is plenty of zones and leveling areas in South Antonica so you can level high enough so worrying about guards becomes less and less a problem.<br/>
