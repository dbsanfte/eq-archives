<div id="ygrps-yiv-177097724">I have a couple questions. I just turned level 7 last night I am Tarew Marr<br/>
Server. I am DE and in Neriak or actually Nektulos Forrest. It is slow<br/>
Advancement I played for about 1 1/2 hours, solong taking anything that<br/>
wasn&#39;t yello or higher. I was wondering if there was a better place for this<br/>
other then Nektulos Forrest also. At what level do you actually have to<br/>
research your first pet spell and above all else this one I want to know<br/>
more then anything Else. What is the Harvester. It is a Scythe which is<br/>
slashing and one handed none the less because the person eho had it had a<br/>
Stien in his hand he was being stuck up and wouldn&#39;t talk to me. I wanted to<br/>
know what the Harvester is and where can I get it. I know it wont be for<br/>
awhile but it looks cool and it just says Grim Reaper All over So if you can<br/>
help I would be much appriciated. Also how about Robe of enshroudment. hehe<br/>
just curious thanks all.<br/>
