<b>Subject:</b> RE: problem with leering corpse <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-415171765">This seems to be a very buggy patch. Last night I was hunting at the Aviak<br/>
Village (also on Karana Server), and suddenly a wizard was trying to steal<br/>
my kill. Once he started casting on it I looked around for him and saw<br/>
flashes in the distance. He hit the bird enough times for it to charge after<br/>
him, so I followed the bird to his position. When I got there all I saw was<br/>
the colorful effects of someone weaving a spell, but he was invis! The bird<br/>
was also trying to swat something that was there, but it never seemed to<br/>
connect. I was standing right in front of him watching this. I tried to<br/>
target him - nothing. I tried to See Invis - nothing. No message at the<br/>
bottom saying &quot;XXXXX casts a spell.&quot; Anyone seen this bug? I lost the kill<br/>
and didn&#39;t even have someone to bitch at for it....<br/>

Logged on today after last patch, used 40 bone chips and not one pet hit<br/>
over 10dmg.  Yes it was leering corpse I was using. I&#39;m level 15 on the<br/>
karana server.  I tried rememming the spell and I even cast the previous<br/>
pet spell.  So my question is have necros&#39; been screwed again, is it a<br/>
bug on all servers, a bug on Karana, or is my Char bugged?  Any help<br/>
would be appreciated before I close the account and tell Verant where to<br/>
stick it.<br/>
