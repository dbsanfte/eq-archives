<br/>
I feel that West Commons is the best place to hunt Shadowmen. I did not care<br/>
for Lavastorm at all. The Shadowmen there are on top of a hill and you<br/>
constantly have to move around to see if any have spawned. Also I know for a<br/>
fact that the Shadowmen in WC have dropped anything that anyone has ever<br/>
needed at some point or another. My observations... All Shadowmen camps vary<br/>
with the number of spawns. Sometimes they spawn just 2 or 3, other times a<br/>
full camp of 5. The &quot;Clerics&quot; are holding the orbs and constantly heal<br/>
themselves if not interrupted. Make sure you have plenty of mana and<br/>
Intensify / Augment your pet. They either go down real quick or put up a<br/>
helluva fight. At lvl 36 or 37 the majority of the Shadowmen can be pulled<br/>
one at a time with a few exceptions. At lvl 25, you will need a FULL group<br/>
that knows how to handle themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Also at times the WC Shadowmen camped are pretty heavily camped, I have<br/>
helped plenty a number of younger Necros by looting them loot corpses of<br/>
items that I didn&#39;t need. Maybe if you ask nicely and respectfully, another<br/>
group might do the same for you.<br/>

P.S. Thanks Shalin and Lykos for your help with my Words of Darkness. How<br/>
many messages have you guys received with &quot;What is that?&quot; and &quot;Can I buy<br/>
that from you?&quot;. hehe Thank Goodness it&#39;s No Drop.<br/>
<br/>

VERY VERY well for it!<br/>

ok, here are some random issues-<br/>
<br/>
1. i was looking at the temple/ro quests.  where is a good place to pull <br/>
shadowed men from?  i know there are 5 in lavastorm, but ive been having <br/>
trouble getting enough ppl to take the camp (especially with sol calling to <br/>
them so nearby).  is there a single spawn anywhere?  im L25, btw, i believe <br/>
that is sufficient.<br/>
<br/>
2. guards- is there somewhere to pull guards?  being evil and all, i would <br/>
like to get some payback, but i got wasted looking around for something in <br/>
RV yesterday.  there were three guards that werent red, and one was green.  <br/>
the others were blue, but they were too close to the reds to attack- oh <br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
3. what lvls does one need to be to take on the temple quests?  i read an <br/>
old post for the harvester, mentioning the writer was L35 at the time.  is <br/>
25 high enough?<br/>
<br/>
thats it for now!<br/>
