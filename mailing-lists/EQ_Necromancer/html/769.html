<div id="ygrps-yiv-444252660">I&#39;ll never be confident in cities other than Neriak. :) just thought it<br/>
noteworthy that the guards were dubious.  I actually got the merchants in<br/>
town down to apprehensive, so I can buy food/water in a pinch and unload my<br/>
loot, which is a good thing with my meager 60 str.  From what I&#39;ve read to<br/>
this point, if someone scowls at you, they will *always* scowl, you can only<br/>
improve faction with people who look threateningly or lower.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Not sure if this has come up here or not, but I spent the last 2 days<br/>
&gt; &gt;  *slaughtering* gnolls in Blackburrow. probably about 6-8 hrs of pure<br/>
&gt; &gt;  carnage.  Mostly concentrating on the commanders/elite guards in the<br/>
top<br/>
&gt; &gt;  rooms.  After all this, I decided to check my faction, and I&#39;m happy to<br/>
say<br/>
&gt; &gt;  that I just successfully banked in the fair city of Qeynos.  Those<br/>
human<br/>
&gt; &gt;  types aren&#39;t so bad afterall...just have to clean up their vermin first<br/>
:)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I do warn you to be carefull about the elves in the town.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am also able to bank... but I decided to go to a nearby building to wait<br/>
&gt; for my group, and a High Elf merchant wandered INTO the building I was in<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; killed me...  (each hit for like 160 points of damage!!!)  So don&#39;t be<br/>
&gt; overconfident in Qeynos.<br/>
