<div id="ygrps-yiv-820163684">I am in S. Ro right now, at lvl 18.  The xp is not as good as oasis but the<br/>
killing is constant and there is actual loot!  I hunt mainly undead, some<br/>
madmen for water, there seems to be quite a few ghouls and the Dry Bones,<br/>
some still yellow.  Be careful in the middle of the zone, near the Dark Elf<br/>
camp, things like to swarm there.  Got killed there last night by 3 madmen 2<br/>
ghouls and a DB :(<br/>
<br/>
Another question I am almost 19, so where is a good place for lvl 20s to<br/>
hunt?<br/>

&gt; Oasis is getting mighty boring, real crowded real cramped<br/>
&gt; Lake rathe and SK are pretty much the same<br/>
&gt; Where could i go for some real good fast experience?<br/>
