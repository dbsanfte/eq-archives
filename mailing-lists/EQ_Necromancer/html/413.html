<div id="ygrps-yiv-2017782475">I currently have a gnome necromancer on erolissi marr and I have journeyed to <br/>
greater faydark to take on orcs and hunt in cb to get money for those <br/>
expensive spells at 8th level.  The guards hate me of course and by killing <br/>
orcs already Ive gotten my faction up with kelethin guards(stormguard?) so <br/>
that only some of them kos me(which is kind of odd).  I was just wondering if <br/>
killing orcs also raises your faction with guards of felwithe or if it doesnt <br/>
what does.<br/>
