<div id="ygrps-yiv-656706869">I&#39;m a human necro, and i&#39;ve just gotten ward undead and realized just how<br/>
neat it is compared to my previous blasting spells, and was wondering if<br/>
anyone knew of any neat undead infested spots near queynos for a level 8<br/>
necro, and how to get to them?</div>
