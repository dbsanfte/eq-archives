Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t much about Savages, unfortunately. I<br/>
checked www.classesofcamelot.com and there was<br/>
no style guide up for savages. There were some<br/>
forums there, so asking the question there is<br/>
probably good.<br/>

Doesn&#39;t matter now, I&#39;ve started a savage :)<br/>
<br/>
Any recommendations on where to put my specialization points into?<br/>
I&#39;ve put some in axe at the beginning just to get through the lvl&#39;s until 5<br/>
but now I have the hand to hand skill I dont really need the points in axe,<br/>
any advice from anyone would be great.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>

Little new info in EQ now we have a new ability for<br/>
plate class called Shielding as to where a plate class<br/>
can absorb the damage dealt to a caster class PC .<br/>

&gt; classes,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think the main reason you dont see many Alb<br/>
&gt; Armsman with Polearms is<br/>
&gt; because they not only have to spec polearms, but<br/>
&gt; also the slash(It maybe<br/>
&gt; thrust) skill...so in order to get the really cool<br/>
&gt; Polearm to do any damage<br/>
&gt; you have to spec two skills. However, the side<br/>
&gt; effect of that is that now<br/>
&gt; you can also use your sword and produce decent<br/>
&gt; damage with it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In order to be able to use polearm and be able to<br/>
&gt; switch to sword and board<br/>
&gt; you need to spec four skills, which spreads can<br/>
&gt; spread you somewhat thin.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Slash<br/>
&gt; Polearm<br/>
&gt; Shield<br/>
&gt; Parry(and if you use the polearm chances are you&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; want parry)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Eventhough you get LEVEL x 2.0 skill points per<br/>
&gt; level after level 5, it can<br/>
&gt; still spread you a little thin in some areas.<br/>
&gt; Personally, I would suggest<br/>
&gt; picking a style, sticking with it and then pump the<br/>
&gt; extra points in the<br/>
&gt; other areas.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For those that are not familiar with specialising or<br/>
&gt; spec&#39;ing in a skill,<br/>
&gt; what it does is this..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; After putting raising a spec skill to a certain<br/>
&gt; level you are given styles<br/>
&gt; (and in the case of magic users...spells), in<br/>
&gt; addition to getting combat<br/>
&gt; styles (they do lots of need things like taunt,<br/>
&gt; detaunt, bleed which is<br/>
&gt; kinda like a small dot, etc, etc) increasing a spec<br/>
&gt; skill such as blades<br/>
&gt; will increase the minimum damage that you will do,<br/>
&gt; in addition it also<br/>
&gt; decreases damage variance on spells. So increasing a<br/>
&gt; spec line is a good<br/>
&gt; thing.  As you might imagine there is a LOT more to<br/>
&gt; this and somethings are<br/>
&gt; different for different classes in different realms.<br/>
&gt;  An example would be<br/>
&gt; the assassin classes. (They are more assassin then<br/>
&gt; thief, since we can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; really steal ;-) )  You may increase your pierce<br/>
&gt; skill, which increases the<br/>
&gt; minimum damage you can do, but you would also<br/>
&gt; increase your critical strike<br/>
&gt; skill which would increase the MAX damage you can<br/>
&gt; do. There are a TON of<br/>
&gt; things you can do with your character in this game.<br/>
&gt; While not everything is<br/>
&gt; totally balanced and its far from perfect, I feel<br/>
&gt; that its the best system<br/>
&gt; that I&#39;ve played to date.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just my two coppers.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hi,<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I used to play a DE necro to 20 in EQ. Gave it up<br/>
&gt; very long ago,<br/>
&gt; &gt; like maybe a year before Luclin came out. I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; never go back.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Corpse runs? Three day camps to complete a quest?<br/>
&gt; Not for me.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;d like to 2nd what Howler said about the tanks<br/>
&gt; in DAoC.<br/>
&gt; &gt; They are not the primary damage dealers. They are<br/>
&gt; meant to<br/>
&gt; &gt; absorb, block, parry damage. They also get a skill<br/>
&gt; called<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;protect&quot;, which acts as a detaunt on the person<br/>
&gt; they place it<br/>
&gt; &gt; on. This keeps the Mobs smacking the guy in plate<br/>
&gt; armor, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; not the caster or cleric in cloth or chain.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Armsman in Albion do get a polearm ability which<br/>
&gt; does tremendous<br/>
&gt; &gt; damage, but I don&#39;t see very many players going<br/>
&gt; that route<br/>
&gt; &gt; currently.  Polearms are slow, and you give up<br/>
&gt; shields to do this.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The thief type classes in DAoC are extremely fun<br/>
&gt; to play. The<br/>
&gt; &gt; Infiltrator class in Albion can do quite a bit of<br/>
&gt; damage. In fact<br/>
&gt; &gt; so much so, the clerics can have a full time job<br/>
&gt; keeping them<br/>
&gt; &gt; alive. I have a 45th level Armsman, and my friend<br/>
&gt; plays a 49th<br/>
&gt; &gt; level Inf, so I&#39;ve seen this personally. I can<br/>
&gt; also put Guard on the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Inf, and block shots on him. This has saved his<br/>
&gt; butt several times.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Some Infs do spec in Dual Wield, they get several<br/>
&gt; nice styles from<br/>
&gt; &gt; the skill.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I haven&#39;t had much fun in RvR, so I&#39;m waiting for<br/>
&gt; 50th to really<br/>
&gt; &gt; give it a good try.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Another good site is www.classesofcamelot.com<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Keltan<br/>
&gt; &gt; 45th armsman, Iseult.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Stuart,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; One VERY important thing to know about warriors<br/>
&gt; and tanks in DAoC. They<br/>
&gt; &gt; are<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; not meant to be MEGA damage dealers, they are<br/>
&gt; meant to<br/>
&gt; absorb/block/parry<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; damage.  There are other classes that are REALLY<br/>
&gt; good at laying the<br/>
&gt; smack<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; down, but at the cost of giving up some<br/>
&gt; defensive capability.<br/>
&gt; Beserkers,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Mercenaries and Blademasters are REALLY good at<br/>
&gt; smacking the living tar<br/>
&gt; &gt; out<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; of something, but they also will take more<br/>
&gt; damage by default.  These<br/>
&gt; &gt; classes<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; are also known as dual wielding classes. While<br/>
&gt; other classes like the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Nightshade, Infiltrator, Shadowblade, Ranger and<br/>
&gt; Scout get a form of<br/>
&gt; dual<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; wield, they typically do not spec in it. The<br/>
&gt; exception being the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Shadowblade<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; (I LOVE this class after my bard)  Instead of<br/>
&gt; getting dual wield,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Shadowblades get a skill called leftaxe or LA<br/>
&gt; for short. Dual Wield<br/>
&gt; &gt; (Albion)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and Celtic Dual (Hibernia) work differently than<br/>
&gt; LA.  Dual wield has a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; chance to trigger, when it does trigger and it<br/>
&gt; does hit, it hits for max<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; damage. With LA, it swings EVERYTIME, when it<br/>
&gt; hits it does a percentage<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the max damage. So while you swing all the time<br/>
&gt; when you hit its partial<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; damage...which is still VERY good.  Its usually<br/>
&gt; only a few points off of<br/>
&gt; &gt; my<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; main weapon damage, because I keep it pretty<br/>
&gt; high.  Midgard is the only<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; realm that gets LA. Shadowblades, and Beserkers<br/>
&gt; get LA.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; So as you can see it depends on how you wish to<br/>
&gt; play.  There are other<br/>
&gt; &gt; tank<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; classes that you should also look at.  I really<br/>
&gt; like the Midgard Thane.<br/>
&gt; &gt; The<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; thane gets a nice AOE DD spell that smacks big<br/>
&gt; ole hammers on thy<br/>
&gt; enemies,<br/>
