<div id="ygrps-yiv-709212692"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;i remember that around that lvl is where you start to see the <br/>
&gt;differentiation in pc vs. mob levels.  at about 16 you will (i think) <br/>
&gt;usually summon a green pet.  now, at lvl 24/25, my pets are always blue (if <br/>
&gt;i check, which i generally dont anymore).  the only time i really worried <br/>
&gt;about it was when i had to summon a pet that could hit magic creatures.  <br/>
&gt;otherwise i would just let the pet die fighting and recast.  get more xp w/o <br/>
&gt;the pet anyway, so it works out in the long run.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When I hit level 20 with my necro, I was unable to successfully create the<br/>
level 20 pet.  Seemed like no one was ever selling them.  I was able to<br/>
successfully level to 24th using the level 16 pet.  Though I will say it<br/>
wasn&#39;t easy.  The reason I am mentioning this is that even at level 23, I<br/>
was able to summon a pet that was blue to me with the level 16 pet spell.<br/>
<br/>
Ive seen level 16 pets that did max of 12 damage, and I have seen some that<br/>
did max 20 damage.  Personally I&#39;d rather be using the pet that hit for 20<br/>
if I can help it.  Its not that hard to stock up on bone chips and they<br/>
really don&#39;t weigh that much so I have a tendance to make sure that I have<br/>
about 100 on me most of the time.<br/>
<br/>
If you travel with a Magician, Wizard, or a Gnome that likes to blow cash<br/>
tinkering stalking probes.  Have them summon an Eye of Zomm, you can test<br/>
your pets str out very easily by killing the eye.  And your pet will almost<br/>
always hit for max damage against one of these summoned eyes.  At later<br/>
levels in a cricis you can even use the bond line of spells to bond to a<br/>
summoned eye.  Eye dies after taking 1 point of damage but you still get<br/>
the full regen effect of the hit points.<br/>
<br/>
As for the question about impart Str.  I used this spell quite often in the<br/>
lower levels.  I find now that I just have so many other spells now that I<br/>
am trying to keep memorized that its just not worth it once you hit about<br/>
24th.  The only thing that Impart Str will do for your pets is the following.<br/>
- Increase its ATK slightly (however my 14th level SK&#39;s pet seemes to still<br/>
be able to hit mobs he fights and thats a level 4 pet.<br/>
- Let your pet hit for max damage more often.<br/>
It will not make your pet hit for more damage than it normally would, it<br/>
only lets it hit for max more often.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps<br/>
