 </span></blockquote>   From what I&#39;ve heard you can now use it while wielding a weapon (before<br/>
it was bare handed only). It does a &#39;lifetap&#39; based on your melee<br/>
damage... for example, hit for 12, get some fraction of that back as HPs<br/>
for yourself. Especially useful for SKs when they get it at 22. For necros<br/>
it should work like an upgrade to the level 4 lifespike. Is this what you<br/>
are seeing?<br/>
