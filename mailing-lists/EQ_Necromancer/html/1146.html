<div id="ygrps-yiv-916298434">Jboots are still of Drelzna in Najena. As for level you need to be with<br/>
relatively 3 level 28+ casters to attempt the jboots. It&#39;s also a good idea<br/>
to summon pets as Drelzna&#39;s Harm Touch can do some serious damage. Also you<br/>
can still get the Oracle robe off the oracle by killing him. I also am<br/>
pretty sure the quest is not working right now, I think anyway. Not to<br/>
mention that you need to be high level to attempt the quest like at lreast<br/>
35+ or have some help.<br/>
<br/>
 Actually us casters don&#39;t get a equivilent in armor. I&#39;m currently level 35<br/>
and I just now got my FBR. Getting hit for damage just gets worse as you<br/>
level. At my level the dungeon I go to if a mob goes aggro on me I&#39;m<br/>
basically dead unless somebody immediatly casts a Area Effect spell.<br/>
Otherwise I&#39;m dead in 10 seconds or so.<br/>

&gt;  I am curious if they&#39;ve changed how you get Journyman Boots such as they<br/>
&gt;changed the Oracle Robe to a quest (speaking of which, does he attack DE<br/>
&gt;Necros?)?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    Also, if so how do I get started?<br/>
&gt;    And if not, what dungeon is she in & where&#39;s it located?  I need to<br/>

&gt;I&#39;ve heard much about them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    On a seperate subject.  I&#39;m 14th level and still wearing the Sr.<br/>
&gt;Apprentice robe.  The rest of my armour, which isn&#39;t much at that, are only<br/>
&gt;cloth items.  Greens can hit for 15, 20pts of damage, it&#39;s pretty sad.  I<br/>
&gt;know casters don&#39;t get much, but I know we get better than this.  Could you<br/>
&gt;give robe & armour idea, where one may find them, level VS item (such as<br/>
&gt;25th being typical for full Bronze), etc?  I&#39;m half naked, and I&#39;m supposed<br/>
&gt;to be a scary Necromancer. LoL  Nothing all too impressive about this. :-)<br/>

&gt;    Currently, I&#39;m in the Qeynos area, but semi-soon heading back towards<br/>
