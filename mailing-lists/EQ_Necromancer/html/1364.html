<b>Subject:</b> Where to hunt at 20th <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-870401995">I know this question has been asked a thousand times, but I would like to know where the best place to hunt at 20th level is.  I am looking for someplace that gives decent loot and exp for a Necro to solo.  If anyone can help me out please.<br/>
