<div id="ygrps-yiv-1798079905">I am a DE Necro, but my friend is a Gnome Necro. Some vendors throughout <br/>
Neriak will sell to him, he is NOT KOS to the guards(although one killed him <br/>
one time, even though it conned apprehensive to him, musta beena bug) and he <br/>
can buy spells from most of the vendors in the Lodge of the Dead. You must <br/>
invis to undead though while going past the ghouls, have heard that they will <br/>
kill non-DEs if you don&#39;t.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Does anyone have a faction list of what we can do to be liked (if not for<br/>
 real, enough that they sell to us).  I heard that we can actually enter 3rd<br/>
 Gate (invis to ghouls) and be able to buy SOME spells there from some<br/>
 merchants. <br/>
 <br/>
 Any help to a new Gnome Necro would be great...<br/>
 <br/>
 Thanks for your time,<br/>
