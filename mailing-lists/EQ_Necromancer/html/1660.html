As far as specs in Oasis go, you should be able to solo one...however you<br/>
can&#39;t pull singles off the island until you hit 46 or so.  So until you can<br/>
do that safely, avoid being the only one fighting them as it&#39;s rather rude<br/>
to kite one then train the rest of the island to zone everytime ;) a nice<br/>
darkness/fear/pet combo will finish one off easily, as with any outdoor mob.<br/>
Just get one to yourself and keep him feared  and slowed while your pet does<br/>
the dirty work.</div>
