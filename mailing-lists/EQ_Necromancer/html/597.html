<div id="ygrps-yiv-1500764270">I just wanted to say thanks for the information. I didnt expect to get such<br/>
good and detaild infomation. This is the best responce I have gotten yet!<br/>

<br/>
&gt;Guk isn&#39;t TOO bad in the beginning, but it gets harder without you knowing<br/>
&gt;it.  You&#39;ll find a lot of the monsters in the first several area weak or<br/>
&gt;mostly weak, but when you get there you&#39;ll realize why a lot of high levels<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t camp this place out for all of its good equipment.  The Trains are<br/>
&gt;REAL BAD.  That&#39;s why I recommend you bring along a shaman or a wizard or a<br/>
&gt;druid, anyone with ROOT, and their sole existence in the group is to ROOT<br/>
&gt;runners before they go down.  You won&#39;t have problems with the guards,<br/>

&gt;Tuk Shamans, Tuk Warriors, Tuk Guards), the real problem is they have<br/>

&gt;stop there, they almost always go DEEP into Guk and bring back several of<br/>
&gt;their own caste, and often times some froglock of the GAZ caste (these<br/>

&gt;want to be fighting more than one GAZ Warrior or shaman at once.  Clerics<br/>
&gt;will also be very useful because most of the froglocks will be fighters.<br/>
&gt;Optimally I&#39;d say two tanks, two ROOT enabled spellcasters, and one cleric<br/>
&gt;at least for a party.  A group of SIX necromancers and their pets will get<br/>
&gt;slaughtered here (read &quot;My pet is attacking something. Hey so is mine.<br/>
&gt;Taunting?  Where?  Hey my pet just died.  OMG! RUN!!!).  Necromancers have<br/>
&gt;some nasty DoTs, but if you have tanks leave the skels in the closet.  Also<br/>
&gt;if you zone to Lower Guk, come back up ASAP.  Lower Guk is a level 35-50<br/>
&gt;dungeon and most people get slaughtered there horrifically because the<br/>
