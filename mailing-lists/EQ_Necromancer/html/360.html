&gt; &gt;&gt;Another annoying thing that peeved me off was not being <br/>
&gt; able to attack<br/>
&gt; things in water. Sure,  you can cast  your spells at them, <br/>
&gt; but it has no<br/>
&gt; effect at all.&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This I can understand. In Nek Forrest there are piranhas in a <br/>
&gt; river that<br/>
&gt; runs under a bridge (first hand experience here) that&#39;ll wipe <br/>
&gt; out any of the<br/>
&gt; newbies in the area should they fall in. If you could kill <br/>
&gt; those piranhas<br/>
&gt; without going into the water, every newbie would be taking mages and<br/>
&gt; leveling up to 12 in 2 days. While I can see your point about <br/>
&gt; realism, I<br/>
&gt; think that this is better as it prevents cheap and easy experience.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>	The problem inherent in the system is you can still hurt them.<br/>
Slowly move into the water, crouching, till your head is under water.<br/>
Target a piranha.  Walk out.  Stand there and cast, following the spell<br/>
effects if it runs away.  I didn&#39;t actually think about this till I saw<br/>
someone doing it to crocs in Oasis, but it isn&#39;t that difficult at all, I&#39;ve<br/>
tried and done it.  Bugged it as well, but I doubt if we&#39;ll get a fix for<br/>
that anytime soon because it seems to be a very deep game engine type of<br/>
thing.  What I&#39;d like to see is if a monster CAN&#39;T reach a person through<br/>
pathfinding would be to RUN AWAY.  Say there&#39;s this maximal chase time,<br/>
where if they don&#39;t close the distance after say one minute or two minutes<br/>
or they don&#39;t change location after about fifteen seconds (this part would<br/>
fix the &quot;Getting Monsters Stuck On Walls&quot; Cheat) they immediately run in the<br/>
opposite direction for at least one minute or until they get hit again.<br/>
This is still subject to cheating (a SOWed person could run back hit them<br/>
again, then run to the safe area) but it would be MORE difficult to do so.<br/>
No more could spellcasters run to the safe location and cast spells till the<br/>
cows come home.  And if the monster ran full tilt away it would be quite<br/>
difficult for the spellcaster to catch up and continue.  The other benefit<br/>
is if it runs across the zone its &quot;monster regeneration&quot; would bring it back<br/>
to acceptable levels soon so that all the cheater&#39;s work was for naught<br/>
(plus the risk involved in hauling across the zone to get that stupid<br/>
monster).<br/>
<br/>
	Its not a perfect solution, I&#39;m just drawing at straws.  I just<br/>
don&#39;t see walking talking mobs (like elementals) continue to chase down<br/>
someone if they can&#39;t reach him.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt;Something else is their apparent psychic connection with <br/>
&gt; the planet.  I<br/>
&gt; mean, seriously, you&#39;re completely across the zone from the <br/>
&gt; thing and it<br/>
&gt; will still know where you&#39;re at, even if you&#39;re far under <br/>
&gt; ground and it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; top side _and_ all the way on the other side of the zone make <br/>
&gt; its way to you<br/>
&gt; through maze or &#39;high water&#39; and begin pounding the snot out of you&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If there&#39;s one thing that does need to be fixed, it is this. <br/>
&gt; You can&#39;t run<br/>
&gt; away from anyone unless you&#39;ve cast some spell that slows <br/>
&gt; your enemy down.<br/>
&gt; On top of that, they don&#39;t stop unless you zone or they&#39;re killed by<br/>
&gt; somebody. It&#39;d be nice if the game had a LOS variable for <br/>
&gt; monsters that<br/>
&gt; figured whether or not they knew where you were at any given point.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>	I think you can keep track of a monster from across the zone, then<br/>
so can they.  I don&#39;t see a problem with this since it helps avoid cheating.<br/>
Rangers can track any monster or player they want in a zone from anywhere<br/>
regardless of if they actually passed by there or not.  If the monsters<br/>
didn&#39;t know where everything was it would lead to a lot of AI problems and<br/>
issues.  AI just isn&#39;t that good yet in games.  I think Verant has done an<br/>
alright job so far.  There&#39;s obvious bugs, but at least monsters help each<br/>
other out, cast spells right, and do a myriad of other things.  In just<br/>
about every other game the computer ALWAYS has a complete knowledge base of<br/>
the area to work with (like RTS games) but it just &quot;pretends&quot; it doesn&#39;t.<br/>
Those of you who played Red Alert saw this alot when your secret assault<br/>
force of tanks that were going to flank the base while the AI opponent<br/>
attacked yours was suddenly attacked BY the enemy force.<br/>
	Again, if I had to choose between more realism and more gameplay, I<br/>
would always choose more gameplay.  You want realism?  Go play Close Combat<br/>
III.<br/>
