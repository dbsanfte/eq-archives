<div id="ygrps-yiv-1354829359">I just blasted the guys on the EQ_Spoiler&#39;s list for asking this question,<br/>
but this list is the perfect place for it.  It depends on your resources<br/>
really: how twinked you are, or if you could even get some help from a druid<br/>
friend (My wife has her own account and is a lv 30 druid, damage shield on<br/>
the pet and a few heals and I could take a character from 1-35 in about 3<br/>
weeks). <br/>
<br/>
Here is my plan to get you up to the mid 30&#39;s.  As a necro, up until you hit<br/>
the upper 20&#39;s you should be hitting yellow con mobs.  Starting at lv 9-10,<br/>
to avoid spiders and  snakes because of the poison and the increased<br/>
downtime due to it.  At lv 10, you should be hitting Lions, Lionesses, YK&#39;s<br/>
and Plains Cats, all in East or West Commons.  Once you get lv 13, Head out<br/>
to OOT and start murdering the nuns (Sisters) there.  It&#39;ll be kind of hard<br/>
to get there, and resting is tough because they roam a lot, but if you can<br/>
do this successfully, you&#39;ll work up to about 16-17 where you can move to<br/>
lake rathe.  To get to the single spawn point, Zone in from Rathe mountains,<br/>
and follow the cliffs left.  After a ways you&#39;ll see an open area with some<br/>
trees.  The single pirch is all the way at the end of the grass where it<br/>
meets the cliff. It&#39;s about a 5 min spawn.  Bring LOTS of bonechips.  You<br/>
WILL lose a few pets if you are under level 18.  Use Clinging/Engulfing<br/>
Darkness and Fear to stack your DoT&#39;s with impunity if you start to get<br/>
weak.  Fear sometimes makes them run to the water, and they suicide, so only<br/>
use that if you have to.  Once you hit about 23 you can move to &quot;Thousand<br/>
Island&quot; (loc 1000, 1000) and take both the birds there, depending on how<br/>
crowded your server is.  Do this &#39;til 25.<br/>
<br/>
Some people suggest doing the Hermit in south karana from 25-27, and that&#39;s<br/>
good if you can get in line for the guy, but I&#39;d suggest getting in the<br/>
treant group/s &#39;til you hit 30.  You will rake in enough cash to equip<br/>
yourself pretty well if you&#39;re not already twinked.<br/>
<br/>
At 30, with your lv 34 spells in your pack, make a trip back to OOT.  This<br/>
time, kill either the named sisters, one by the tree, and one by the docks.<br/>
Stay along the shore and you&#39;ll be safe from the sisters in the buildings.<br/>
There is also a pair of dwarves by a gravestone (you will have seen these if<br/>
you hunted here from 13-18).  You can pull them solo.  Use darkness and fear<br/>
a lot on these, same as with the chickens in LR.  Once you hit 34, assuming<br/>
you weren&#39;t a total bone-head and forgot to specialize in alteration, start<br/>
rooting the sisters.  DoTs now work about 50% better if the MoB is<br/>
stationary, and your root will make sure they are. Start taking on sisters<br/>
as fast as your mana will allow.  Done right, you&#39;ll go from 30-35 in about<br/>
5 days.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not going to tell you where to go after 35, as I&#39;m there now and don&#39;t<br/>
care for hordes of necros showing up at my spots (nothing personal). But<br/>
once you get 35, if you&#39;d like to take a break from the monotony of Level,<br/>
Loot, Repeat, then I&#39;d suggest worming into a group in SolB or Lower Guk.<br/>
If you don&#39;t have any good friendships built up when you get to that level,<br/>
your life will be hard, or you will just be under equipped.  It&#39;s all about<br/>
the group when you get in the 40&#39;s, and it helps if people know you&#39;re a<br/>
competent party member.  <br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>

<br/>
Where did you hunt at 9th lvl?  10th?  11th?  I&#39;m in this stage right now.<br/>
I&#39;m having<br/>
fun killing Skeleton Lrodd in Befallen now.  I can solo him with my pet and<br/>
he&#39;s<br/>
usually red to me :)  I love being a necro.<br/>
