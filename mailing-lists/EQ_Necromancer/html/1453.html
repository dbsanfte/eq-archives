<div id="ygrps-yiv-689136975"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;The hardest ones are the damn clerics, <br/>
&gt;rarely there will be a spawn of 4 shadowmen on the<br/>
&gt;left side of the spawn and <br/>
&gt;once this weekend it spawned 4 clerics, well 3 of us<br/>
&gt;nec&#39;s tried it with all of <br/>
&gt;our pets and we all died and only killed 1 cleric,<br/>
&gt;now that was <br/>
&gt;embarassing<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Amen. We had four necros with pets, and witnessed a<br/>
massive spawn. 2 clerics, necro and two warriors. They<br/>
wiped us out pretty quickly. We made the mistake of<br/>
takeing out the necro first thinking he was the most<br/>
powerful. The clerics kept him alive while the<br/>
warriors shredder our pets and ourselves. Nasty fight,<br/>
but fun.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Finally i&#39;m all dressed in black, got my mask of<br/>
&gt;shadow <br/>
&gt;that i had hunted for which probably took about 15hrs<br/>
&gt;of playing time in nek forrest.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I managed to pickup a mask as well, but it would not<br/>
let me equip it. It said All/All and i am a dark elf<br/>
necro, so what am i missing?<br/>
