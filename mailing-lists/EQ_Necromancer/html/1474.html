<b>Subject:</b> Lifetap line of spells <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1835750199">I have heard (read a post at CastersRealm) that now our Lifetap spells have <br/>
had their resistance rate raised a by a LOT. Before they were pretty much <br/>
unresistable.Now they are supposed to be as bad as the Darkness line of <br/>
spells.I have been away from EQ for several days so I can not say if this is <br/>
true or not, I intend to see for myself today.If this IS true than this is <br/>
complete BS! I mean, us Necros are being hit left and right by these stupid <br/>
patches.They powered down our high level pets, weakened our DOTs, and now <br/>
THIS?! I mean come on! What does Verant have against us?<br/>
