<div id="ygrps-yiv-1684849606">i would really just like to be able to have spells ready in case of <br/>
emergencies, without hurting my ordinary ability to dish out damage.  for <br/>
example, i almost always have ward undead, even if there are only a few <br/>
undead around.  resting after a battle and getting attack by a zombie is no <br/>
fun, even though they are rather weak opponents.  even a high level, <br/>
ordinary skeleton can do some damage if you dont have a pet and/or ward.<br/>
just for comparison, i got trained by 3 skels, without a pet, and i was able <br/>
to kill them all.  by the time i finished i was severly low on hp, and just <br/>
about out of mana (enough for gather shadows).  if i wouldnt have had ward, <br/>
i would have been dark elf pot pie.<br/>
i also like to keep either gather shadows or gate on hand, but it would be <br/>
nice to have access to both.  also, i almost always use dark pact, and the <br/>
extra mana has saved my buns many a time.  it would just be nice to have the <br/>
ability to use a good portion of the spells i have, instead of needing to <br/>
choose a small handful.  im sure any spellcaster can agree with that, but <br/>
since we are already limited in our ability to take damage, i think the <br/>
versatility would help, even if it doesnt really make us all that much more <br/>
powerful.<br/>

&gt;Most spells come in groups, Spell X is an improvement on Spell Y, at lvl 15<br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t have much trouble deciding which spells to mem, I rarely melee<br/>
&gt;anymore so dark aura isn&#39;t necessary and lesser shielding lasts quite a<br/>
&gt;while so meming that every once in a while to recast isn&#39;t that big a deal.<br/>
&gt;The key is knowing what kinds of mobs you&#39;ll be fighting.  Lavastorm, where<br/>
&gt;I am right now requires a bit of a specialized spell list, since all the<br/>
&gt;mobs resist heat blood consistantly.  I find an engulfing darkness/disease<br/>
&gt;cloud/poison bolt combo handles them nicely.  I can step in to take the <br/>
&gt;heat<br/>
&gt;off my pet if need be.  Also one of the keys to success is <br/>
&gt;casting/recasting<br/>
&gt;your pet until you have the highest level skele available to you.  I<br/>
&gt;generally keep fear mem&#39;d for emergencies as I find gate to be very<br/>
&gt;unreliable for getting me out of trouble.  Lifedraw and lifespike I keep<br/>
&gt;mem&#39;d at the top of the list. spike for the occasional &quot;hey, over here<br/>
&gt;thanks for the health&quot; and draw for the &quot;ouch I need a big heal in a hurry&quot;<br/>
&gt;rounding things out is ward undead, or siphon str depending on where I am.<br/>

&gt; &gt; im only L11, but looking at my impending set of spells, and considering <br/>
&gt;im<br/>
&gt; &gt; already feeling a crunch, i really think that pure spell caster classes<br/>
&gt;NEED<br/>
&gt; &gt; another spell bar.  Eight spells is just not enough to cover many<br/>
&gt; &gt; situations, and definitely offers very little flexiblity.  another thing<br/>
&gt; &gt; that would be useful is some sort of &#39;quick spell&#39; slot, where you can<br/>
&gt;keep<br/>
&gt; &gt; one spell to cast.  i usually use my top slot for this, where i can <br/>
&gt;place<br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt; &gt; spell that i can do without if i need to quickly memorize a different<br/>
&gt;spell-<br/>
&gt; &gt; but i would be estatic if we could get to memorize 16 spells.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; while we&#39;ve all heard many tweaks that are far fetched an definitely<br/>
&gt; &gt; unbalanced, i think this is rather important, and would add a great deal<br/>
&gt;of<br/>
&gt; &gt; flexibility to spell casters, especially at higher levels where we get a<br/>
&gt; &gt; staggering array of various spells.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;Hail fellow necromancers<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;I am lev 14th and already finding it hard to pick exactly which 8 <br/>
&gt;spells<br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;keep memorized. I currently don&#39;t keep shielding and grim aura <br/>
&gt;memorized,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;rather I cast and delete them, then repeat later when they wear off.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;When I&#39;m in a large group that is killing fast, I tend to use the low<br/>
&gt;mana<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;spells like siphon str and disease so I can do this to all MOBS. I like<br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;keep gate memorized for emergencies, my best life suck spell, my ward<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;undead, and my best darkness spell as it slows the MOBs down if they <br/>
&gt;are<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;fleeing or if I need to flee. I also find dark empathy handy to <br/>
&gt;emergency<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;heal passerby&#39;s that are dying. I make a lot of friends that way. I <br/>
&gt;also<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;find mend bones quite handy esp when I&#39;m soloing or in a group of 2 <br/>
&gt;where<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;the other person is a wizard or other spell type. I also like the<br/>
&gt;vampiric<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;embrace as I can tank at the beginning of a fight longer, back out and<br/>
&gt;life<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;drain, then tank again. That extra 25 tap 2 or 3 times some fights has<br/>
&gt;made<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;a big difference a few times.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;So I have at lev 14 something like this memorized.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;1)Best Life Drain<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;2)Vampiric Embrace<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;3)Englufing Darkness<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;4)Heat Blood (or if in lavastorm or big group Disease)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;5)Dark Empathy<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;6)Mend Bones (or if in group with tanks siphon str or posion bolt)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;7)Gate<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;8)Ward Undead<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;I wish I had slots for fear and shadow step but I don&#39;t usually.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;At lev 16 I see a lot of new neat spells. A new DOT. Feign Death. A <br/>
&gt;spell<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;make you immune to damage for a short time ect. I am at a loss as to <br/>
&gt;how<br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;fit all the fun spells in. I&#39;m happy in the sence there are so many <br/>
&gt;cool<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;spells I can sorta mix and match for the situation but its much more<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;difficult living with 8 spells at a time then when I play my lev 17<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;magician. I can mem and forget all my summon spells. My combat ones are<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;always less then 8. IE DD, AE, Gate, Damage Shield and I&#39;m about done<br/>
&gt;with<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;important spells.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;I was wanting advice from higher lev necromancers about what spells <br/>
&gt;they<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;tend to load and for what situations. Esp for the lev 16 and the 20th<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;spells.<br/>
