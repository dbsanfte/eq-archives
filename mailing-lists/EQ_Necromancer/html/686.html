<b>Subject:</b> Mend Bones..? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1233058458">I&#39;ve seen a couple people mention that they use mend bones, is it really that<br/>
useful of a spell? Does the healing increase a lot as you get up in levels?<br/>
Right now I&#39;m level 10 and when I use it it doesn&#39;t seem to do a hell of a lot<br/>
of healing to my pet, I&#39;m casting it while in battle and I don&#39;t see my pet&#39;s<br/>
life bar go up at all. When I cast it out of battle it only seems to raise my<br/>
pet&#39;s life a little, maybe 1/4&quot; on his meter.</div>
