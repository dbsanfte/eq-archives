<b>Subject:</b> Re: [EQ_Necromancer] Cable Modem question <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1691521314">FYI I use a cable modem and the &quot;slow down&quot; experience of multiple users<br/>
being on is still MUCH better than any dial up connection.  When my friends<br/>
are over on weekends I easily support 5 people zoning, etc. at the same<br/>
time.  However I use comcast cable out of the Detroit area, it may be<br/>
different depending on the company.  I believe comcast has a very large pipe<br/>
to the inet supporting their users. (Multiple T3&#39;s i believe)<br/>
<br/>
I personally will try to avoid playing eq on a dial up after playing on my<br/>
cable modem and friends DSL.  I can literally see friends on a modem keep<br/>
backstepping while there connection catches up, etc.  I have 1 friend that<br/>
has a key to my apartment and brings his computer over to play rather than<br/>
deal with dial up.  :)  These are my experiences.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t think that you won&#39;t ever get lag though.  Sometimes it is just server<br/>
side lag  (i.e.  Verant)<br/>
