<div id="ygrps-yiv-1359273233">I acutally like it as well.<br/>
<br/>
The reasoning behind that is that I almost exclusively group. I rarely<br/>
solo, and when I do, it does not involve kiting. So the patch actually<br/>
helps my style of play quite a bit. Since I also have a pure warrior, I<br/>
can see where the game is unbalanced that a necro can take down red<br/>
creatures with virtually no risk to themselves, while my warrior<br/>
struggles and occasionally dies from yellow. <br/>
Of course, I was in the Karanas last night and was the /ooc channel<br/>
spammed by people bitching about losing their kiting abilities. <br/>

&gt; usually finght in a group so it HELPED me cus DAM<br/>
&gt; was increased if they run less then 18 seconds.  :-)<br/>
