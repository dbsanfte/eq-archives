<div id="ygrps-yiv-915581763">Ok, this is how to go from Qeynos to freeport or freeport to qeynos. This<br/>
was done at level 9 by a bard, the only part of caution will be a couple KOS<br/>
places. This is from a Gnomish Necromancers perspective.<br/>
<br/>
Starting out in Qeynos you leave to the Karanas. You hang to your left all<br/>
the way. Once you reach the bridge you go to your left again. You might want<br/>
to watch out for the Cyclops fisherman adn the druids. But once you get in<br/>
the hills stay up in them as much as possible to the left. Keep going and<br/>
you will reach beholders maze. In the maze you stay to the right UP ON the<br/>
wall as much as possible. Go slow and don&#39;t rush. Many a peopl ehave fallen<br/>
to their demise. IT is good to be invis all this time also. Once you go far<br/>
enough along the right wall. You will reach the entrance to RunnyEye<br/>
Citadel. In there stay to the left wall and you will come out in Misty<br/>
Thicket. In misty Thicket I Would recommend going straight forward until you<br/>
find the wall. You should stay invisable especailly at this time because<br/>
there are guards in this area. You will pass through a gate in this stone<br/>
fence and follow the road, taking the left fork. You will come to a tunnel.<br/>
This will lead to riverdale. Go invisable before entering Riverdale, as they<br/>
will kill you. Though if you want you can kill a lot of goblins in the area<br/>
and your faction will eventually get good enough to enter without<br/>
invisability. But once in river dale find the entrance. I remeber it as head<br/>
right around the big circle building and there is a gnomish lady selling<br/>
stuff in a stand and I go down the path right before her. Not that that will<br/>
help on other servers. But hey Always check out those maps on Stratics. Well<br/>
once you get out of riverdale you will be in Kithicor forest. Stay to the<br/>
left  and keep following the wall. This zone is fairly harmless, however I<br/>
am not sure how all of the inhabitance will react. Some are friendly to me.<br/>
There are also large animals I believe, and they will probably be<br/>
aggressive. Now once you zone, you will be in The Commonlands. You should<br/>
run along the road, dodging hill giants. OR you can stay to the left a bit<br/>
and you should miss them. However beware of along the left wall there are<br/>
Dervish camps and undead shrines. Bewarned, so you don&#39;t stumble on them. If<br/>
you stay near the left you keep going, oh beware the druid shrines also that<br/>
are near the dervish camp and near the teleport gate. They have something<br/>
against necromancers. Well stay to the left and eventually you will zone<br/>
into the other commonlands. Keep going and you will come to a zone to the<br/>
left. Do not go into there unless you want to go to the Nektulous forest.<br/>
Keep going and you will run into a vast waste land. Keep going and you will<br/>
zone into West Freeport. From their I am sure you can find th egates.  Good<br/>
luck..<br/>

&gt;     Hello, folks,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;         I&#39;ve tried to get my Necro off to Free port about two, three times<br/>
&gt; now.  I get completely lost in High Hold Keep and end up wondering the<br/>
same<br/>
&gt; halls and turns for about an hour or so before I gate back.  Could any of<br/>
&gt; you give the directions to go, to get _out_ the other side of that flaming<br/>
&gt; place?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;         Also, do the guards kill you on sight?  I&#39;m constantly invis or<br/>
&gt; finding a room to recast it before it runs out, just in case. :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     Thanks for any help,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
