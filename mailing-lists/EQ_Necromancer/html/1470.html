<div id="ygrps-yiv-880520107">You cant really compare the molten cloak to the Mystic Cloak....<br/>
THe mystic cloak is just SO MUCH better... :)<br/>
<br/>
IF it is possible to get Linara Parlone (the enchanter in najena) to give<br/>
me the letter to take to her father in Felwith WHILE INVIS.... the<br/>
entire quest can be completed invis....<br/>
<br/>
I tried a few more times and died a couple more as well....<br/>
and i decided to take revenge by killing her outright and discovered<br/>
several interesting factors....<br/>
<br/>
You gain faction with &quot;TheDead&quot; when u kill her....<br/>
and for all you Dark Elves... u know that thats the faction of<br/>
the Necro and SK guild.... what a great way to build faction<br/>
with your homebase... :)<br/>

&gt; &gt; hi !<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I heard from some sources (not sure where since i already deleted the<br/>
&gt; mail) that<br/>
&gt; &gt; quests are able to be completed while under Invisibility .<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; They stated examples by completing the Mystic Cloak quest<br/>
&gt; &gt; (8ac +5int +5sv magic 10 charges SteelSkin) .<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; A few days later i attempted to try this out myself by camping<br/>
&gt; &gt; the Priest of Najena in Unrest . It was a 52 min spawn and more<br/>
&gt; &gt; often than not spawns a regular Ghoul as a placeholder (PH).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; After 16 long hours of waiting in line (only 2 spawned) and getting<br/>
&gt; &gt; the component off the Priest i made off to Najena to complete part<br/>
&gt; &gt; 1 of the quest . unfortunately when i tried to give it to the NPC while<br/>
&gt; &gt; invis , it broke the invisibility and i was charmed and killed by the NPC<br/>
&gt; &gt; (who is a High Elf Enchanter btw) .<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Has anybody else attempted to complete this quest ?<br/>
&gt; &gt; or does anyone have confirmation if quests can be completed<br/>
&gt; &gt; while invis ? pls email me directly as I dont always get the time<br/>
&gt; &gt; to read all this list mails...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
