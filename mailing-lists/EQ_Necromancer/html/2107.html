<b>Subject:</b> Kunark system specs <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1198929929">Hi again folks,<br/>
<br/>
Something has been bugging me about this Kunark expansion, and I wanted to<br/>
check in with you guys to see if you&#39;re having the same problems.<br/>
<br/>
My system is a PIII 600Mhz.  128Mb ram.  I&#39;m running a 32Mb Diamond Ultra<br/>
V770D (Riva TnT2 chipset).  I have a 20.4 gig hard drive.<br/>
<br/>
Now for the problem.  In order for the game to be playable whenever I&#39;m in<br/>
Kunark, I have to COMPLETELY lower the clipping plane, and change some of<br/>
the other settings (like particle density, etc).  If I do not do this, I get<br/>
the framerate from HELL.<br/>
<br/>
So tell me...did Verant just COMPLETELY drop the ball on the minimum system<br/>
requirements?  Anyone with a similar configuration having the same problem?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Mujahid</div>
