<div id="ygrps-yiv-561700488"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&lt;&lt; does the mana you have get increased immediately when you<br/>
&gt; add +int equipment, or does it only increase it after you<br/>
&gt; level?  what i mean is, do you get the same increase for<br/>
&gt; getting a +2 int earing and first wearing it at level 15,<br/>
&gt; as you would if you have had it since level 1?   &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;At the moment  you put it on it gives it take it off it takes it away ...<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;estimate is +2 earings dont really give as much mana increase untill lvl 34<br/>
&gt;before then maybe mana items better , but im guessing.<br/>
&gt; Im loaded now with 160 modified intel and skull and book for an extra 60<br/>
&gt;mana at lvl 30.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ok int rings that add +3will give you about 8 mana at level 20 per earing.<br/>
So its not like this huge jump, but think of it like this. +8 mana here +10<br/>
there, + 5, +20, next thing you know you are up alot of mana. You wont be<br/>
able to cast your bigest spell one more time because you have 2 int<br/>
earing&#39;s, but at level 50 +3 int will give you like 40 mana!!!! WOW now<br/>
that&#39;s rocking!</div>
