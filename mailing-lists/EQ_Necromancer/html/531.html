  Subject: [EQ_Necromancer] where do I hunt at 5th lvl?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I made 5th lvl last night and my little gnome necro is doing fine, but I<br/>
can see now I am starting to get too powerful w/ my big Skeleton buddy for<br/>
the kolbolds.  They CON Black and when I was 4th I was taking on 2 yellows<br/>
and winning! I love being a necromancer.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Anyway where can I go to find L5-9 MOBs in STEAMFONT???<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks!</div>
