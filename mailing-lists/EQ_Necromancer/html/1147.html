<div id="ygrps-yiv-2039564117">LoL - I like your sense of humor.  Guk hm, and woven?  You&#39;re right, that is<br/>
going to take some traveling shoes... but come to think of it, I don&#39;t have<br/>
any shoes. :-) hehe  Yes I really need an equipment upgrade.  I go through<br/>
Freeport down through the Desert, no?<br/>
<br/>
Ahh..not solo.. hm, problem there is the binding.  I know one person who<br/>
would go with me, is there a place around there I could bind somebody so<br/>
they don&#39;t have to run all the way back from Freeport?  How I wish there<br/>
wasn&#39;t the silly starting city only limitation.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the advice, I&#39;ll put it on the future sight seeing list. *grin*<br/>

&gt; Grab your little piles of bones and put your travelling shoes on and head<br/>
&gt; for Guk.  It&#39;s down in Innothule swamp next to the troll city.  There<br/>
you&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; find tons of little froggies just dying (sorry for the pun, couldn&#39;t<br/>
resist)<br/>
&gt; to give you their woven armor.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A warning, though.  Don&#39;t do it solo and check your pet with the coat girl<br/>
&gt; at the door unless you&#39;re extremely talented at keeping it under control.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve seen so many pet related train deaths in that dungeon that those cute<br/>
&gt; little skeletons ought to come with a warning label from the surgeon<br/>
&gt; general.<br/>
