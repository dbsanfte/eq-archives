<div id="ygrps-yiv-452568754">Hi folks,<br/>
<br/>
I am very rapidly approaching level 16 (about 2 bubbles away.....I&#39;ll get<br/>
there as soon as I get home from work today :) ), and am wondering about<br/>
Research.  I would very much like to do all or most of my own research.<br/>
However, I also play a level 22 Wiz who has NEVER been able to successfully<br/>
research ANYTHING.<br/>
<br/>
Is there any way to practice your research without having to use the actual<br/>
words that we come across?  It seems like they are pretty hard to find (my<br/>
Wizard finds runes all the time, but they are rarely the ones he needs).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;m looking for any and all advice as to the best way of raising<br/>
your research skill.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,<br/>
