<div id="ygrps-yiv-12571046">I think the quest had the locations switched around, just make sure you do<br/>
an identify on the scepters before you hand them in.  I did the boot quest<br/>
the other night with no problems. <br/>
<br/>
As long as the robe quest is not screwed up, I&#39;ll be happy.  Breaking into<br/>
the area with the nokta shaman for a couple of 31 level necros is kinda hard<br/>
for the globe of shadows.  Luckily we found a high level nec to help after a<br/>
couple of hours.  It still took a few hours though to get 3 globes for me<br/>
and the 2 other necs in the group.<br/>
<br/>
Now if the shadowmen would drop our items a little more, dropped 1 eye in<br/>
about 3 or 4 hours, and a couple of scythes.  They dropped quite a bit more<br/>
for other quests in that time; gloves or something for enchanters, rapiers,<br/>
glowing stones or something like, wizard patch?? etc.<br/>

Has anyone actually figured out the problems with<br/>
these quests?<br/>
<br/>
And why in the world, when I identify the spectre from<br/>
mistmoore, does it say spectre of sorrow when the NPC<br/>
says get the spectre of tears from mist and spectre of<br/>
shadows from guk?<br/>
