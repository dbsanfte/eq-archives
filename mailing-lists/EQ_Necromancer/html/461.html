<div id="ygrps-yiv-1332064817">Huh? I haven&#39;t seen much &quot;that class is better than ours&quot; griping on this<br/>
list, at all.<br/>
<br/>
I just started a DE Necro. My humie necro was only level 5, and I figured<br/>
I&#39;d back off of him and go the full-bore necromancer/evil guy way of life.<br/>
Plus the human had an INT of 105. This guy&#39;s got 130 INT.<br/>

I &#39;ve been on many mailing lists for a while and all I hear is people<br/>
complaining about the other classes being better...<br/>
the mages complained about the necro the necro about the mages and so on.<br/>
If verant says the classes are balanced I trust em (except for the rogues<br/>
wich still dont have poisoning)<br/>
Of course the neighbor&#39;s grass is always more green.<br/>
So if you dont like the class just check out another but please stop pissing<br/>
me off with worthless &quot;he got this and that, Im jealous&quot;.<br/>
Necro is a hard class to play if you are not good with tactics , you might<br/>
try a bard or something<br/>
