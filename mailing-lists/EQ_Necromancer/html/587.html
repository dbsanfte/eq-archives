&gt;     So you know. I was killed in fithwell after I con a guard. It said <br/>
&gt;indfferently. So I uninvised my self. Well the gm said that thats just <br/>
&gt;faction standing, and has nothing t do with ratial hatried when you con <br/>
&gt;something. Kind of silly isnt it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     question: I killed a lot of ORCS so I am indifferent from most guards <br/>
&gt;I see now . . .<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     but, I need to buy my lesser shielding spell and was wondering if I <br/>
&gt;will be KOS inside felwithe . . .  anyone know?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     I mean if guards outside are not KOS I should be ok inside buying <br/>
&gt;spells right?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
