        If you&#39;ve currently been to the EQVault &lt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eqvault.com">http://www.eqvault.com</a> &gt;,<br/>
then you know that they&#39;re adding a new land mass in _approximately_ nine<br/>
months.<br/>
<br/>
        The Necromancer is sourly lacking a town of operation.  There is<br/>
supposed to be a City of Necromancers -- it is a _integeral_ part of the<br/>
story of Norrat (before the time of us players) -- and, considering that the<br/>
race on this island is also going to be an evil race including Necromancer,<br/>
and they are still in the process of adding this continent, what better<br/>
place and time to add the City of Necromancers ?<br/>
<br/>
        It is simple to write feedback about this.  During gameplay, simply<br/>
type the command /feedback .  Make sure you&#39;re not in an area where you&#39;re<br/>
going to be attacked, and please request that our city be added, and be sure<br/>
to mention what a prestine opportunity this is to add it!  They&#39;re added<br/>
better graphics -- more colorful, better sprites, animated trees in wind<br/>
(which was an example) -- the Necromancer city will offer a WONDERFUL<br/>
opportunity to create and use new sprites!<br/>
<br/>
    Thanks folks!<br/>
