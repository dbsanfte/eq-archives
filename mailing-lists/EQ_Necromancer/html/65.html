<div id="ygrps-yiv-2101441306">Yes, since I&#39;m not past 16th, I can say for sure that 7th level was<br/>
THE longest level for me.  Essentially you have to fight level 8 monsters to<br/>
get XP but you are using FOURTH Circle spells to fight.  At 8th though is<br/>
kind of pissy too because basically you are relegated to fighting undead<br/>
only.  From 8 to 12 you are STILL using 4th circle spells for combat (which<br/>
is absurd, but then Vampiric Embrace sucks) on normal monsters.  Once you<br/>
drag past 7th (I think I basically killed stuff south of the bridge in<br/>
Nektulos, running from kodiaks and halflings and just killing skels, large<br/>
spiders, shadow wolves, and black bears), the first two spells you should<br/>
get are Bone Walk and Ward Undead.  Ward is cheap because Clerics get it a<br/>
circle less, but Bone Walk will be a good 5pp I believe.  Once you have<br/>
those you HAVE to go to Befallen or camp at skeleton runes and temples.<br/>
Most of the 10-12 monsters will shrug off your crappy 4th circle spells<br/>
(except Poison Bolt) and eat you alive.  Go to Befallen and just work the<br/>
1st floor till level 12.  Read my previous post about Befallen conditions.<br/>

&gt; Just looking for a little encouragement, was Level 7 the most <br/>
&gt; difficult<br/>
&gt; for everyone?   I&#39;m struggling to get to 8, my pet doesn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; seem to help<br/>
&gt; much and my Mana regeneration is very slow, even with <br/>
&gt; meditate.  I know<br/>
&gt; things get better at 8 but will every level like this (11,15,19 etc.)<br/>
&gt; be this difficult?  Or is just me?  My ranger character <br/>
&gt; advanced easily<br/>
&gt; until he hit the teens so this has been frustrating.   Is grouping the<br/>
&gt; only solution to problems like these?  Not my first choice....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>
