 </span></blockquote>Yes.  I am a Dark Elf Necro, who has been living in the freeport area for a <br/>
while (West commons, East Commons, North Ro, Freeport)... and I can tell you, <br/>
the paladin guards in North Freeport will Attack you on sight.  And guess <br/>
where the bank is?  So no banking while there.  Maybe you can make a trip to <br/>
nectulos to bank (it is off the East commonlands)  but then.... the guards <br/>
there tend to kill humans, so I would check first (you may be excused being a <br/>
necro)  The bank there is in the Neriak Commons.<br/>
<br/>
And a previous post mentioned the necro guild being in east freeport in an <br/>
ruined building.<br/>
