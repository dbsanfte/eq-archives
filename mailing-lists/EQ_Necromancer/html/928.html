<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-604763620">This Bloodclaw effect comes off the Stilleto of the Bloodclaw a nice dagger for a Necro since at higher levels your usually not in combat anyway and htis way you can hold one +mana or intell item in your hand during combat or because it is very light you can take it off before combat and hold two mana items! Then when occasionally you need to melee you just slap it on and go at it. As for it being area effect I did not know this although I haven&#39;t done the most melee in the past 10 levels ( 20-30 ).<br/>
