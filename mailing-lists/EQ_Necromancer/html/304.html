<div id="ygrps-yiv-1663790749">Pricks like me? Bah, I wont take this part to the message list.  Though<br/>
it&#39;s interesting to note I&#39;m &quot;a prick&quot; because I don&#39;t like the game or<br/>
varant, and say so.<br/>
<br/>
        As for the game, I loved it at first, sure.  I read all the hype,<br/>
looked at all the screen shots, etc.  Had allot planned out, too, and all of<br/>
it being role-play.  I dealt with all of the plans being squashed because of<br/>
some idiotic limitation or another, got burned a bit further when I found I<br/>
couldn&#39;t stand back and plan fights out and just had to rush in and start<br/>
swinging (why are we magic classes?), or do the same with the pet.  But I<br/>
dealt with it.  Then there&#39;s the problems with the spells, variant&#39;s general<br/>
attitude towards the Necro class, and a ton of other problems.  Just makes<br/>
me think they&#39;ve got  a big head about &#39;em and they don&#39;t really give a<br/>
stink &#39;bout us players.  That&#39;s what ticks me off the most, not being free<br/>
to come up with our own strategy or using our class to their full potential<br/>
because of deliberate restrictions comes in a very fast second.<br/>
<br/>
        As for why it&#39;s important to see the number of your mana.  I&#39;m the<br/>
type of person who likes to plan ahead, _way_ ahead.  Deciding which spells<br/>
to memorize, in what order to cast them, which to buy and not to buy, and so<br/>
on and so on.  The amount you have plays allot in this.  Say, for<br/>
instance... You have a total of 200 mana and you have 50 left.  Cost 45 to<br/>
cast a certain spell.  You can either use a spell to get out of there and<br/>
survive or cast that one and leave you with only 5mana left, and thus,<br/>
totally open.  Not knowing how much you have left, just a silly bar graph,<br/>
you go ahead and cast it.  Whoops, you just peeved out the mob, it&#39;s<br/>
frenzying you, and you&#39;ve no way to get the heaven&#39;s out of there.  I know,<br/>
Gate and such takes way more mana than that, but for an example it&#39;ll do.<br/>
If you&#39;d known precisely what you had, along with knowing how much a spell<br/>
takes (as we do, at least), you&#39;d have been able to very quickly figure that<br/>
the escape, was the way to go.  Besides, I like knowing.  The least they<br/>
could do is make it an option.<br/>
<br/>
        As for ruining play, I make it a point to be very helpful to others<br/>
in the game, especialy to newbies and such.  I figure players have it hard<br/>
enough without somebody making it a pain for &#39;em, may as well help.  I don&#39;t<br/>
see where that&#39;s ruining play. :-)  Just simply, I don&#39;t like Varant.  I<br/>
think I&#39;ll leave EQ, soon as somebody else comes out with 3D fantasy world.<br/>
It&#39;ll happen soon enough, but until, it&#39;ll &quot;have to do&quot;.  As much as I don&#39;t<br/>
like &#39;em, and as much as the world peeves me off at times, it _is_ a very<br/>
nice chance to role-play (if you can find somebody to do so with) and I&#39;ve<br/>
waited a very long time for at least somebody to _attempt_ a real fantasy<br/>
world for your charecter to live in.<br/>
