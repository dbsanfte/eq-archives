<div id="ygrps-yiv-1563598515">Well, I haven&#39;t seen this ring; however, I did see a post somewhere where<br/>
someone was asking how to use a Ring of Running (which he had).  The<br/>
response was that it wasn&#39;t working yet (as in a bug/not implemented yet).<br/>
This sounds like it could be a SoW ring; however, again I have never seen<br/>
it, have no idea where to get it, and have heard it doesn&#39;t currently work.<br/>
Not very helpful, but it is all I know :(  If anyone has any more<br/>
information I would love to hear about it also<br/>

&gt;rings(spirit of the wolf) do they realy exsist. Or is this just another<br/>
&gt;rumor to make us lower levels drool. If any one knows anything on this I<br/>
&gt;would like info. Being a necro with out doge to level 22, when a pet dies<br/>
&gt;god you got be able to run. I hate it when your pet dies for a stupied<br/>
