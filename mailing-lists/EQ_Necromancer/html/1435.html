<div id="ygrps-yiv-1667903145">I was in the temple yesterday and the NPC said that the scepter of sorrow<br/>
from mistmoore, for the boot quest. The scepter of tears is for the gloves.<br/>
<br/>
Now, if anyone can fill me in on what NPC gives these two items up in their<br/>
respective locations I would really appreciate it.<br/>
