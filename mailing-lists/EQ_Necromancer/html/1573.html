<br/>
I used it all day yesterday in Lower Guk (live side), very few resists all<br/>
day. It lasts 15 seconds max, but the mob might not start to frenzy after<br/>
the spell wears off. Be aware that casting and melee enhance the chance of a<br/>
break. Two Necromancers were plenty of crowd control for us to take the king<br/>
room, but an Enchanter is still a better option for crowd control. Over all,<br/>
a very valuable addition to our spell line up. It has been one of my 8<br/>
memorized since the patch.</div>
