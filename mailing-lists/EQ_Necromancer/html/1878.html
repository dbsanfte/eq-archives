<div id="ygrps-yiv-592387946">Yeah EQ doesn&#39;t support the NVIDIA chip sets like 3DFX . . .<br/>
<br/>
I was sadly dissapointed when my brand spanking new GeForce256 looked worse than my VOODOO2<br/>
<br/>
I emailed <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:support@...">support@...</a> and I will let you know what turns up.<br/>
<br/>
now outside of EQ the cards rocks!  I mean I did this 3D benchmark and it was about 3 times faster than my VOODOO2 .. .   really smokin&#39;<br/>
<br/>
I changed my CPU speeds and FSB too and there was a noteable increase in performance of the video card when the CPU overall Mhz and FSB was increased so if you have a newer system I&#39;d get one.  I think EQ will support it soon.  &lt;/e crosses his fingers&gt;<br/>

  online and buy one since I still use a banshee<br/>
  card....now this is making me do a double take.<br/>
<br/>
  Anymore input? Please?!?!<br/>

  &gt; I have a GeForece256 DDR and EQ has told me they<br/>
  &gt; don&#39;t offically support it, it isn&#39;t as good as my<br/>
  &gt; VOODOO2, my friend had the same experience.   GRRRR<br/>
  &gt; EQ makes me mad sometimes.<br/>
  &gt; Hopefully they will fix it.<br/>

  &gt;   have to agree with Tony B on that. had a tnt2<br/>
  &gt; ultra, and decided to try one<br/>
  &gt;   out. (didnt really think it would make that big a<br/>
  &gt; difference) There isnt<br/>
  &gt;   much difference in it, Untill you go above<br/>
  &gt; 1024X768, and then it really<br/>
  &gt;   starts to shine.  (about 20fps faster)<br/>

  &gt;   &gt; get an nvidia geforce 256 with ddr.  they are<br/>
  &gt; the best cards out now (high<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; res, works with everything).  also, nvidia has<br/>
  &gt; always had stable drivers.<br/>
