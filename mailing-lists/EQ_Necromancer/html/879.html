<div id="ygrps-yiv-1842810458">So ro is where I went till I hit 15. Killing dervish off the east and west<br/>
camps there. They both have sentries. So its easy exp. Then at 15 I went to<br/>
the lake and soloed Aviak guards. On a island that is know as the cave<br/>
island or the arina is land. There is a little tactic to kill them at level<br/>
15 but if you sit in the cave for a bit you will see some one soon enough<br/>
doing the hide behind the corner and not get hit while you spell them to<br/>
death trick. good luck!<br/>

&gt;Arrgh.. Does anyone have good suggestions where a 14th level Dark Elf<br/>
&gt;Necromancer can go hunting and make some exp (hopefully enough to 16)? I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;tried east and west commons, most of the things con green to me (90%) and<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t give exp, the rest just kick my ___. I tried Befallen but all that<br/>
&gt;resulted in was a trip back to 13th level twice.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Help?<br/>
