<div id="ygrps-yiv-544294655">I play on ECI and I have a bunch of extra WORDS including 1 for the L16<br/>
restless bones spell.  My character name is Skel   /tell me if you want to<br/>
hook up.<br/>
<br/>
Also does anyone know what is up w/ WORD od DOMINION?  since it WAS for<br/>
charm and charm is gone is it useless?<br/>
<br/>
As for research, it is not bad, I have tried to make spells 3 times and 1<br/>
time succeded and the other 2 my skill went up, so try try again.  I think<br/>
you have a better chance of researching spells if you are at the higher end<br/>
of your RANK.<br/>

&gt; Im in Povar, New L16 Gnome necro, and cannot locate two spells; Banshee<br/>
&gt; Aura and Restless Bones.  Gnome guild doesn&#39;t have these.  Where can I<br/>
find<br/>
&gt; them? How best to and get them?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; How best to control a pet, such as in Unrest?  While in the Castle in CB<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; ran away and I lost 2 pets that way.  Would not respond to commands even<br/>
&gt; tho alive.  I found a L16 spell not familiar with; Spirit Armor?  And<br/>
&gt; lastly, with Heat Blood, Engulf Darkness, and Heart Flutter, if all<br/>
stacked<br/>
&gt; about how much damage done?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks for any help!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; PS<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As I go up it appears its better strategy to make max use of pet and not<br/>
do<br/>
&gt; much melee;  if so, how best to heal pet, and do I med, if possible, while<br/>
&gt; he fites (keeping a chk on health), then heal him up?<br/>
