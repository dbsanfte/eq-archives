 </span></blockquote>hehe,  It used to do this... but people got more annoyed becaseu then you had <br/>
the converse problem... and could not select the monster... always your pet.<br/>
<br/>
All of the function keys are used already... so the question is WHAT key <br/>
would select your pet?<br/>
<br/>
I would more like to see another health bar somewhere that is your pets <br/>
health.  And maybe even allow a click on it to select your pet...<br/>
