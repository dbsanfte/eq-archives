<div id="ygrps-yiv-1102700755">I still dunno about the group bonus.. I grouped with my ENC friend who is <br/>
the same lvl killing spectres and in 5 hours of killing I got half a bub... <br/>
Solo I get half in 2 hours.. I dunno it&#39;s strange... I usually do get better <br/>
xp grouping, but then again the spectres are odd heh...<br/>

&gt;wtf?  i think necros have the largest percentage of broken and useless<br/>
&gt;spells of any class.  not only that, but we have a huge gap in the number <br/>
&gt;of<br/>
&gt;quests we can do, and too many items mimic our spells.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;BTW, is intensify death really broken. Feel kinda stupid casting it all <br/>
&gt;&gt;the<br/>
&gt;&gt;  time for the last few weeks.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;then they took away charm and gave us a worthless spell (screaming terror),<br/>
&gt;not only is it a &#39;why go to the train when you can bring the train to you&#39;<br/>
&gt;spell, but it only works indoors!  at least if it worked outdoors, when the<br/>
&gt;wipe failed it wouldnt really be as dangerous.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;and what were they thinking when they made voice graft?  i dont think any<br/>
&gt;class has a more useless spell.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;oh well, thats my rant =)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Also had a general question about experience and which is better to do.  <br/>
&gt;&gt;Is<br/>
&gt;&gt;it better to solo a yellow spawn every other time it comes up (lets say<br/>
&gt;&gt;alternating with an equal level friend) or group with your friend and kill<br/>
&gt;&gt;each one and split the exp?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;you are better off getting 50% of two kills than 100% of one, there is less<br/>
&gt;work involved, and more safety.  also, you get some form of grouping bonus.<br/>
