<b>Subject:</b> Finding a staff <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-954052829">Fellow Necromancers,<br/>
<br/>
As you know, the types of weapons we can use is very limited.  I&#39;m currently trying to find a worn great staff.  A regular great staff is way beyond my current budget.  I&#39;ve tried all the merchants in Neriak, but none carry them.  I&#39;ve also been told the orc pawns sometimes have them, but I&#39;ve killed at least a hundred of them, and have yet to even see one carrying a staff.  Does anyone know of a merchant that sells worn great staffs (preferably one that doesn&#39;t kill Dark Elves on sight) or where I can find one?  My dagger is getting very rusty.<br/>
