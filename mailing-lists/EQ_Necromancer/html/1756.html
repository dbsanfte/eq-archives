&gt;patch message, feel free to mention it.<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt;*Spell Changes*<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;- Shadow Vortex is now a &quot;drain&quot; spell.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I velieve they converted it into a lower form of Vampiric curse, that or<br/>
like a siphon str spell, the AC you Debuff the mob with goes to you, any<br/>
damage is healing for you.  If it work the way I am thinking you should get<br/>
back 5hps for 10 ticks.  I could be wrong on this, haven&#39;t hit 20 yet with<br/>
my necro, just hypothesising.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;- Siphon Strength will now stack with strength buffs and debuffs<br/>
 </span></blockquote>you can now get str spell cast on you and siphon str will give you even<br/>
more str.  As for Debuffs, it used to be that if you used impart Str and<br/>
gave str to someone else, pet or person, you could then siphon str from a<br/>
mob and you would negate the penalities of impart str as well as gain the<br/>
added str above your normal str.  Which was kind of a bug, because now you<br/>
have more str than you started with and so does the person you imparted str<br/>
too.<br/>
Now, both spells stack correctly, If you impart Str to something, and then<br/>
siphon you will have your starting str.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;- Panic the Dead cast and recast delays have been reduced. In &gt;&gt;addition, <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;the spell is less resistable.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Self explanatory.  Now just need to see if it actually works any better.<br/>
