<div id="ygrps-yiv-1926679212">has anyone played that old game &#39;dungeon master&#39;?  spending time <br/>
experimenting with spell casting and figuring out the logic behind the magic <br/>
was one of the coolest things i liked about that game.  in fact, now that i <br/>
think about it there are alot of similarities between DM and EQ.<br/>

&gt;Im not sure of the exact date that asheron&#39;s call is going to be out but I<br/>
&gt;know its not real soon. If you read the postings on various sites about the<br/>
&gt;new eq edition coming out the first quarter of next year its adding swaying<br/>
&gt;leaves(using less pixels!) and tons of other great additions including the<br/>
&gt;new continent it will be more than enough to match asheron&#39;s call.  The one<br/>
&gt;thing though that I did read about asheron&#39;s call is about discovering new<br/>
&gt;spells( kind of like research but better) and the advantages to keeping the<br/>
&gt;spells secret so there arent a lot of spoilers. That would definately add a<br/>
&gt;new angle on spell casting in eq if they added something similar to that.<br/>
