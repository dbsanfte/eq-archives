<div id="ygrps-yiv-611935">I am a level 16 necromancer, and I am completely<br/>
broke. As of last night, I am worth 3pp and some<br/>
change. Could you all please give me some ideas on<br/>
getting money? Killing wisps is extremely boring to me<br/>
since they take forever to track down, don&#39;t get exp,<br/>
and with my luck I get a non-burned out lightstone<br/>
once out of 10 times. Lavastorm is boring too since<br/>
that is where i spent level 10-12, and dervishes are<br/>
the same story since that was 12-14. <br/>
<br/>
Any ideas, please? :)<br/>
