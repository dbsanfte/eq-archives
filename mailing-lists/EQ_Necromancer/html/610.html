<div id="ygrps-yiv-331191221">Hello All<br/>
<br/>
I am currently running both a magician and a necromancer. I personally am<br/>
the type of person that would rather know where to go and how-to do things<br/>
rather then taking months to figure it all out myself. This is mostly<br/>
because I&#39;m busy in my RL with work, marriage etc, etc ... Thus, for me,<br/>
just keeping up in levels near my friends is hard enough, much less running<br/>
around everywhere trying to find everything myself.<br/>
<br/>
There are a few things I find lacking in the main stream web sites info.<br/>
<br/>
A. The spell lists are out dated and don&#39;t provide the info I want. IE they<br/>
don&#39;t say this spell does this damage for this manna, here is the ratio. It<br/>
takes this many secs to cast with the channeling skill maxed for the level<br/>
you first receive the spell. The necro DOT does X damage a tick for X ticks.<br/>
I would find that kind of extra statistics helpful.<br/>
<br/>
B. Where do you buy the darn spell? No site I have found is attempting to<br/>
keep a list of vendor locations and their inventory and pricing for some<br/>
base charisma.<br/>
<br/>
C. The above info should be integrated to include if each spell is research<br/>
only or not. The status of research for that spell. IE broken or not. And if<br/>
not broken what are the components to make the spell, what book and what<br/>
lang etc.<br/>
<br/>
IE a site that says for the magician or necro or X class that it deals with,<br/>
here is the spells you can get, here is what they do, here is what level you<br/>
will get them, here is where to find them or how to make them or both. IE<br/>
one stop shopping for info on a spell.<br/>
<br/>
Since I have not seen such a site, I am thinking of making one. Since my 2<br/>
major chars are a dark elf and gnome I can get into almost every town with<br/>
one of them. But before I mess with making a site, I want to see if anyone<br/>
besides me would even care, if no-one cares, then I will just continue to<br/>
keep my own private notes. Also, If I take the time to do this, I would like<br/>
to hear if any of you could help me gather the necessary information. IE go<br/>
to diff vendors, record their inventory and pricing and send it in to me for<br/>
the site?<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>

... Thanks Kenneth<br/>
