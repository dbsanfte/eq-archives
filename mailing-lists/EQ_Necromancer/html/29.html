<div id="ygrps-yiv-1646841987">They are very tough... I could have sworn I would be level 7<br/>
forever...  here&#39;s my advice, <br/>
<br/>
Dark Elf NEcromancer only:<br/>
To get to level 8 after skels stop giving you decent XP, get in a group and<br/>
try to kill young kodiaks, zombies, and lesser mummies.  Make sure you time<br/>
your spells correctly... nothing sucks worse than casting all your DoT<br/>
spells and pissing the young kodiak off so it frenzies on you.  I usually<br/>
start off with Clinging Darkness first in case you have to run, wait a bit<br/>
for your pet and the tanks to eat some damage, then hit it with Poison Bolt<br/>
and Disease Cloud, then wait a bit, then hammer it with LifeSpikes.<br/>
<br/>
After level 8 you&#39;re first two spells should be Bone Walk and Ward Undead,<br/>
and I would get them in that order.  Hang out by the Rune or the Temple and<br/>
work your Ward Undead up to decent levels (30&#39;s) on the decaying skels,<br/>
skels, and then you should be able to take a zombie and a skel at the same<br/>
time, though mass undead will still deal death.  Numb The Dead is cool if<br/>
you want to pick them off one by one, but usually by the time I get all<br/>
prepped some higher level loser will come along and trash everything.<br/>
<br/>
Once you hit 9, I would be very wary but cross East Commons into West<br/>
Commons on the South side (the desert wall side) and go into Befallen.  The<br/>
first floor is loaded with skeletons and rats.  Some skels will still give<br/>
you XP but there&#39;s this one mob called Skeleton Lrodd who is AWESOME XP (no<br/>
loot).  At 9 I could beat him 50% of the time on my own, so I usually shared<br/>
with a shadowknight or another necromancer until 10 or 11, then I killed him<br/>
as exclusively as possible.  It IS possible to go down to the second floor,<br/>
but I would not suggest it without at least another necromancer and a couple<br/>
of tanks, and then still watch for trains.  The more the merrier at those<br/>
levels.  Do NOT go to the third floor or beyond, you&#39;ll just be fodder.<br/>
ALWAYS go up and check on if Lrodd respawned.  Another convenient target is<br/>
the first floor ShadowKnight.  He&#39;s pathetic and you should just crush him<br/>
at level 9, and he sometimes carries a Bone Chipped Rod that is worth 8 gold<br/>
in stores... its magical but all it does is Locate Corpse, for some reason<br/>
the NPCs seem to want to sell this for 6000 plat.  I figure if there&#39;s ever<br/>
another use for it I&#39;ll just come back here for a couple hours and<br/>
stockpile.<br/>
<br/>
At 12 its ALL good... we&#39;re talking with Convoke Shadow, HEat Blood, and<br/>
Engulfing Darkness you can take 2 (three if you are lucky) young kodiaks by<br/>
yourself before resting, nothing except the ubermonsters (hill giants,<br/>
griffons, werewolves) can touch you when you have full mana, and you have a<br/>
lot more leeway.  My personal favorite is cleaning out the smaller orc camps<br/>
(ie not the ones with legionairres) in East and West Commons to improve your<br/>
faction, and kill willowisps for XP and the chance of getting lesser and<br/>
greater lightstones (1pp and 5pp when sold to a human or non vision person)<br/>
kodiaks are still a problem by yourself but with a 11th Shadowknight and<br/>
another spellcaster you can take these down no problem.<br/>
<br/>
At 12th I also recommend going to LAvastorm Mountains... pretty much<br/>
everything is fair game (cept lavacrawlers) and the loot is decent,<br/>
Dervishes give blocks of ore, imps and drakes leave jasper and bloodstones,<br/>
and basilisks leave eggs (worth 4-6 gold).  If you can grab another<br/>
spellcaster or tank it gets even easier.<br/>
<br/>
Since I&#39;m only 13th that&#39;s as far as I can go, but I&#39;m hunting in the<br/>
LAvastorms and its great.  I&#39;ve also been to Paw anf its a dungeon made for<br/>
levels 5-15.  Grab a couple tanks and two more spellcasters and you should<br/>
totally OWN that dungeon, with a cleric it gets even easier.  There&#39;s cool<br/>
things down there like totem staves and pieces of good armor.<br/>
<br/>
After that, I&#39;d love to get advice from a higher level on where to go for a<br/>
Dark Elf NEcromancer.<br/>

&gt; Being past that lowbie phase I can tell you this:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Levels 6 to 12 can be the hardest levels.  Your offensive <br/>
&gt; spells suck until<br/>
&gt; you get heat blood and engulfing darkness.  I suggestion <br/>
&gt; killing in a group<br/>
&gt; until level 8, then get ward undead and kill undead mobs <br/>
&gt; until 12.  You can<br/>
&gt; do atleast some damage then.  As a gnome I had the <br/>
&gt; oppertunity to clean up<br/>
&gt; the chessboard leveling fairly quickly.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Hiya, I&#39;m playing a lowbie necro based in quenos, and am <br/>

&gt; &gt;slowdown around level 6, any suggestions as for what i <br/>
&gt; should be killing<br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; &gt;decent XP?  Also, anyone out there on the Veeshan server to <br/>
&gt; group with?<br/>
