<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2023060070">one problem with a vendor list is that, in the last few patches, they have <br/>
changed the location of several spells from vendors.  otherwise, i know that <br/>
the dmg formulas would be helpful, as would duration.<br/>
<br/>
on a side note, what is the approximate cost for the dagger of marnek?<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hello All<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am currently running both a magician and a necromancer. I personally am<br/>
&gt;the type of person that would rather know where to go and how-to do things<br/>
&gt;rather then taking months to figure it all out myself. This is mostly<br/>
&gt;because I&#39;m busy in my RL with work, marriage etc, etc ... Thus, for me,<br/>
&gt;just keeping up in levels near my friends is hard enough, much less running<br/>
&gt;around everywhere trying to find everything myself.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;There are a few things I find lacking in the main stream web sites info.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;A. The spell lists are out dated and don&#39;t provide the info I want. IE they<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t say this spell does this damage for this manna, here is the ratio. It<br/>
&gt;takes this many secs to cast with the channeling skill maxed for the level<br/>
&gt;you first receive the spell. The necro DOT does X damage a tick for X <br/>
&gt;ticks.<br/>
&gt;I would find that kind of extra statistics helpful.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;B. Where do you buy the darn spell? No site I have found is attempting to<br/>
&gt;keep a list of vendor locations and their inventory and pricing for some<br/>
&gt;base charisma.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;C. The above info should be integrated to include if each spell is research<br/>
&gt;only or not. The status of research for that spell. IE broken or not. And <br/>
&gt;if<br/>
&gt;not broken what are the components to make the spell, what book and what<br/>
&gt;lang etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;IE a site that says for the magician or necro or X class that it deals <br/>
&gt;with,<br/>
&gt;here is the spells you can get, here is what they do, here is what level <br/>
&gt;you<br/>
&gt;will get them, here is where to find them or how to make them or both. IE<br/>
&gt;one stop shopping for info on a spell.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Since I have not seen such a site, I am thinking of making one. Since my 2<br/>
&gt;major chars are a dark elf and gnome I can get into almost every town with<br/>
&gt;one of them. But before I mess with making a site, I want to see if anyone<br/>
&gt;besides me would even care, if no-one cares, then I will just continue to<br/>
&gt;keep my own private notes. Also, If I take the time to do this, I would <br/>
&gt;like<br/>
&gt;to hear if any of you could help me gather the necessary information. IE go<br/>
&gt;to diff vendors, record their inventory and pricing and send it in to me <br/>
&gt;for<br/>
&gt;the site?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sincerely,<br/>
&gt;Veneficus (Rank 5) gnome magician<br/>
&gt;Eloric (Rank 3) DE Necromancer<br/>
