I have a 20th level Necro. I have read through lots of guides on <br/>
playing this class but with all the nerfing of the Necro class a lot <br/>
are outdated. I am trying to determine if I should give my pet <br/>
weapons still. Some guides suggest not giving them weapons past level <br/>
16. I have also read that when the pet gets double attack they have <br/>
to have weapons to get the second attack. There is also the issue of <br/>
the damage cap? Can someone familiar with Necros as they currently <br/>
exist in the game advise me on this issue. I need to know if I should <br/>
equip my pet with a weapon and if so should I only use a certain <br/>
quality of weapon or greater. <br/>
Anything about armor would be appreciated too. (Armor flag etc.)<br/>
