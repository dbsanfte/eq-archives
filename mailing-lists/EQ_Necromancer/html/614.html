<b>Subject:</b> New To EQ and have a problem. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1936599898">Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d just like to say I finally bought EQ after everyone at my work,<br/>
and all my friends have made me sick about raving about it.  Well, I&#39;m<br/>
in a little bit of a bind.<br/>
<br/>
I just started out and died when I finally reached my Guild house. <br/>
Unfortunately I couldn&#39;t get my corpse and have lost my note I was<br/>
supposed to hand to the necromancer there.  I hear from my friends<br/>
that I should get a robe or something, but I don&#39;t have the note.  Is<br/>
there any way to get a new note or something?  None of the stores<br/>
nearby will sell me anything because I&#39;m a necromancer, so I&#39;d like to<br/>
get this one.    Also is there anything else I am missing out on by<br/>
not completing this quest?  I mean,  I&#39;m sure I can eventually find a<br/>
robe somewhere,  I just don&#39;t want to miss out on a bunch of stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Thanx<br/>
