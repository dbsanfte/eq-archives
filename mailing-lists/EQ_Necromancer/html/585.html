<div id="ygrps-yiv-900218540">Here&#39;s some info:<br/>
<br/>
Guk isn&#39;t TOO bad in the beginning, but it gets harder without you knowing<br/>
it.  You&#39;ll find a lot of the monsters in the first several area weak or<br/>
mostly weak, but when you get there you&#39;ll realize why a lot of high levels<br/>
don&#39;t camp this place out for all of its good equipment.  The Trains are<br/>
REAL BAD.  That&#39;s why I recommend you bring along a shaman or a wizard or a<br/>
druid, anyone with ROOT, and their sole existence in the group is to ROOT<br/>
runners before they go down.  You won&#39;t have problems with the guards, tads,<br/>
and shamans, and with a full group even the Tuk caste won&#39;t be too bad (ie<br/>
Tuk Shamans, Tuk Warriors, Tuk Guards), the real problem is they have enough<br/>
hitpoints and intelligence to run while they still have quite a bit of<br/>
health, making pets and ABSOLUTE NO NO here.  Guards and stuff won&#39;t go far,<br/>
they&#39;ll hit the first froglock they see and run back.  TUK froglocks won&#39;t<br/>
stop there, they almost always go DEEP into Guk and bring back several of<br/>
their own caste, and often times some froglock of the GAZ caste (these dudes<br/>
are VERY nasty for people around level 12).  When this happens you&#39;ll<br/>
usually see a good half dozen to a dozen froglocks just SHOW UP and everyone<br/>
yells &quot;TRAIN!&quot; and runs for the exit leaving their bodies in a line all the<br/>
way home.  ROOT or dogpiling runners is a MUST.  At the low teens you don&#39;t<br/>
want to be fighting more than one GAZ Warrior or shaman at once.  Clerics<br/>
will also be very useful because most of the froglocks will be fighters.<br/>
Optimally I&#39;d say two tanks, two ROOT enabled spellcasters, and one cleric<br/>
at least for a party.  A group of SIX necromancers and their pets will get<br/>
slaughtered here (read &quot;My pet is attacking something. Hey so is mine.<br/>
Taunting?  Where?  Hey my pet just died.  OMG! RUN!!!).  Necromancers have<br/>
some nasty DoTs, but if you have tanks leave the skels in the closet.  Also<br/>
if you zone to Lower Guk, come back up ASAP.  Lower Guk is a level 35-50<br/>
dungeon and most people get slaughtered there horrifically because the train<br/>
strength is just as bad as Upper Guk, only with level 35+ monsters.<br/>
