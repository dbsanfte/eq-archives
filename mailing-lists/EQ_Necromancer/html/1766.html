undead just outside the guildhall (if you&#39;re paying attention, you&#39;ll see<br/>
the ghouls before they see you), walk on in, do your business (first<br/>
merchant transaction will remove invis), and repeat i2u before walking<br/>
out.<br/>

Hmm.  At L16, the ghouls are all dark blue to me.  Since they seem to have<br/>
their own faction (The Dead) which I&#39;m already KOS, and since there aren&#39;t<br/>
many nearby guards...  I wonder if I can pull singles with numb the dead?<br/>
Must keep the shadowstep/shadowstep/gate plan ready just in case though,<br/>
as neither guards nor ghouls tend to fall for feign death.  Have to give<br/>
it a try tonight.  Boy will it suck if they carry additional faction and I<br/>
become KoS to the (now dubious) guards.<br/>

and you&#39;re not KOS there except to the aforementioned ghouls.  You ARE<br/>
dubious to many of the vendors.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s another SK guild shown in the foreign quarter on the map at<br/>

can&#39;t say for sure, but it would surprise me to be worse than dubious.<br/>
