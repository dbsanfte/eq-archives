<div id="ygrps-yiv-790867212">It all depends on who you go with, and what strategy you use.  I had one of<br/>
the best times ever in EQ the other night in Hate.  We had 16 people, 5 of<br/>
which were enchanters so we figured we were a bit screwed, but come to find<br/>
out we could haul major ass with that setup.  We were pulling nonstop to the<br/>
big house in the middle, basically the monk would shout out &quot;4 inc&quot; etc and<br/>
we&#39;d just mow through them while the enchanter brigade kept things cool.  If<br/>
you really get rolling in hate it can be a blast, 1 or 2 hr CR times and the<br/>
heavy duty setup definitly limits who will find it fun though.  It&#39;s a<br/>
different style of play.  The roamers there make it impossible to actually<br/>
dungeon crawl and progress through the level.  Pulling is a necessity, or<br/>
you&#39;d all be dead far too quickly.</div>
