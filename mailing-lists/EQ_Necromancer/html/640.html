<div id="ygrps-yiv-1775114328">HE HE!! if that didnt get your attion you have a problem. Lats night we were<br/>
killing giants and spector&#39;s. My god I felt like a demi-god. We were 18<br/>
necromancer&#39;s strong. All with pet&#39;s. We would see a giant and count it down<br/>
5,4,3,2,1 and them all at the same time sick are pets on it. Then we would<br/>
suck its life away. emguling darkness and heat blood do nothing, 18 necro&#39;s<br/>
sucking hp out of a giant sends it too its knees befor it can kill 1/3 of<br/>
the pets. My god this is a good way to make plat. type /who all necromancer<br/>
and then msg them all and get your own group together and bring fear to all<br/>
of norrath. That the necromancer is the true demastration of Innoruuk&#39;s<br/>
blessing and POWER!!!!<br/>
<br/>
One thing else when you have 3 teem you take tunrs att first so you get ex.<br/>
Then only the team leader gets to loot. turn off auto loot and then at the<br/>
end the team leaders sell off everything and tally up and split the loot.</div>
