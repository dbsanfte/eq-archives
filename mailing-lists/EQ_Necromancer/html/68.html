<div id="ygrps-yiv-2036994351">My human necromancer had little trouble making the journey to Freeport from<br/>
Qeynos, but I did have Gather Shadows to assist me.  I waited until level 8<br/>
for this reason specifically.  The guards in Freeport actually look at me<br/>
&quot;apprehensively&quot; which I *think* is better than the dubious looks I got in<br/>
Qeynos, though I could be mistaken.  There are the odd shop keepers who will<br/>
look threateningly, I just make it a habit of conning every npc I come close<br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
The necro guild in Freeport is in a condemned building in East Freeport,<br/>
through (what else) a false wall.  There are nice maps of the 3 sections of<br/>
Freeport on Eqvault under city guiles that I&#39;ve had open during my first few<br/>
days in this new city.<br/>
