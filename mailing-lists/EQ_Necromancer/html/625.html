 </span></blockquote>This&#39;ll be tough. There are guards all over the place. You&#39;ll never make it<br/>
above ground (you&#39;ve got 2 zones worth of Queynos to get through above<br/>
ground).<br/>
<br/>
I suggest you do this:<br/>
<br/>
Get off the boat and go left into an open marketplace (tho there are guards<br/>
there that guard the entrance) then turn to the right to leave the<br/>
marketplace. You&#39;ll see a smith on the left and a large structure straight<br/>
ahead and to the right. Enter that. Its the arena and its a PvP area. Work<br/>
your way down into the tunnels under that, and you&#39;ll find a grate with a<br/>
guard behind it. He should be friendly to you (unless he hates Erudites). Go<br/>
through there and you&#39;ll come to a large room with a bunch of doorways. A<br/>
trail of bones leads to one. Follow the bones into an area with a false wall<br/>
(there&#39;s a bone arrow there) and you&#39;ll find yourself zoning into the<br/>
Queynos Aquaducts. In there is the Necro/Shadow Knight Guild. After visiting<br/>
them, you can find your way through the aquaducts to a &quot;secret&quot; passage<br/>
(everyone that lives in Q knows about it, of course) that leads outside the<br/>
city. Then you&#39;re safe!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.</div>
