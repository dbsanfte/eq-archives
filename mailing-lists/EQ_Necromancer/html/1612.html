&gt; Since ST is now a mez type spell, can you pile all your DOTs onto a<br/>
&gt; creature,<br/>
&gt; then mez it and let it just sit there frying?Can&#39;t test myself yet, cause<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No, you can&#39;t...at least not when it works the way it&#39;s supposed to.  ST<br/>
lasts 18 seconds and is broken by *any* damage...melee or otherwise<br/>
(including DOT) However...the way things are right now you occasionally get<br/>
a good 30-40 second stun on the creature and it will sit there taking<br/>
everything you can dish out.  GZ stated in a news post that they would fix<br/>
this ASAP.  I&#39;ve also run into this scenario..2 mobs, one ST&#39;d the other<br/>
being taken down by party/pet.  Once that first mob is dead your pet will<br/>
turn on the 2nd one if it hit you, or the pet at any time..just a heads up<br/>
