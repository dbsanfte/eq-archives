<div id="ygrps-yiv-1141125073">I buffed my pet a few times this way, and did notice that he hit for more<br/>
damage.  The problem that I have with the spells are that they take strength<br/>
away from you.  My outtings last a very long time before I go back to town<br/>
and sell, so weight was a huge factor only having a str of 65, so when you<br/>
take away 10, I would become encumbered and lose some agi as well, so I quit<br/>
using the spell.  You are probably meleeing at this level too, so if you did<br/>
want to use this spell, use siphon strength with it so that you are back up<br/>
to your potential, but that takes 2 spells slots away from a lot of other<br/>
more useful spells.<br/>

Hi Folks,<br/>
<br/>
I have a lvl 13 Necromancer on Solusek Ro (Mujahid).  My question deals with<br/>
buffing your pet.  Has anyone here had any experience with &quot;Impart<br/>
Strength&quot;?  Is it worth casting it on your pet to give him an extra 10<br/>
strength?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,<br/>
Mujahid<br/>
