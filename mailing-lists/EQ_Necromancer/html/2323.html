<div id="ygrps-yiv-1015857792"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Alright Oskar,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Got the game at the weekend, eventually got my account registered and<br/>
&gt; started playing. I started a highlander and I&#39;ve only played it for a<br/>
 </span></blockquote>couple<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; of hours but it seemed very slow going. Dont know if it&#39;s just the<br/>
&gt; town(Hamburton) I started in but there didn&#39;t seem to be much going on in<br/>
&gt; the area, monster wise. Suffice to say I&#39;ve only just started so I&#39;ll keep<br/>
&gt; going and see how it goes.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not very familiar with Albion as I mentioned earlier, I think if you go<br/>
up the hill from humberton you will see a little pig farm that is good to<br/>
hunt until you are level 5, its pretty slow though. I wish I had more Alb<br/>
experience but I don&#39;t. I know Hibernia the best followed by Midgard.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry I can&#39;t be much help to you there :-(<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Some more questions for you<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1. Whats the best thing to do to level up quick, just hunt local monsters?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The first thing you want to do is to hit level 5 so you can chose your<br/>
profession. Hunting the noob mobs is usually the best way, there are also<br/>
tasks that you can do as well. Simply find a named guard, and say TASK with<br/>
him targeted. If he has a task for your level he will tell you what to do.<br/>
If not he wont give you one. You may have to find a few guards to get the<br/>
tasks.<br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind, you need to see a named guard. Merchants have tasks too, but<br/>
they are usually Fedex tasks...take this to person in another town type<br/>
sutff.<br/>
<br/>
You are limited to the number of tasks you can perform per level. Usually<br/>
you can get about 75% of a level via tasks. You will get money and exp for<br/>
them so doing them is usually a good thing. :-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 2. My friend should be joining me in daoc soon to you get bonus xp for<br/>
&gt; grouping?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not quite in the same way that you are used to in EQ.  Typically when you<br/>
group there is the potential to pull more than one mob (as is the case in<br/>
most games) If you pull a mob that is linked to another mob(s) and you<br/>
successfully kill them all you get what is known as a &quot;group bonus&quot;. Its not<br/>
because you are in a group its because you pulled a &quot;group&quot; of mobs. If you<br/>
solo and kill a group of mobs you still get the bonus exp.<br/>
<br/>
There are a few more things about mobs in DAoC that you need to know,<br/>
because I dont think they have an equivlent in EQ. (I could be wrong) Mobs<br/>
in DAoC have what are called &quot;scout&quot; mobs. Basically these guys will see you<br/>
(and you may or may not see them) and go off and get some buddies only to<br/>
jump you at the most in opportune time.  They will also do what is known as<br/>
&quot;bring a friend&quot; or BAF.  Basically they tell their buddies to come with<br/>
them to kick your butt.  They also may not BAF in the beginning but as they<br/>
get low on health they may, &quot;yell for help&quot; and then if any mobs are in the<br/>
area they come running to help the mob you are beating on. This happens a<br/>
lot in Hibernia with the water beetles (low levels) and its pretty much a<br/>
newbies first bad experience with BAF. All in all its not too bad. :-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 3. What sort of weapons and armour should I be looking to get?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If I were you and I was a full Alb Armsman tank, the answer is simple.<br/>
PLATEMAIL. VERY COOL LOOKING. Just make sure you dont come across a Mid<br/>
&#39;Zerker or a Hibbie Blademaster with dual wielding  blunt weapons. They are<br/>
likely to totally ruin your day. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Here is a REALLY good site with message boards for EVERY class. It may help<br/>
to read up on what experienced people are doing with their Alb tin<br/>
cans..er...armsman. (Sorry I can&#39;t help meself. I&#39;m a Hibbie ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Any help you can give would be great<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Cheers<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hope this helps.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck...well at least until we meet on the battlefield then I will mezz<br/>
your sorry butt and let my tanks kill you! hehe<br/>

&gt; Hi Stuart,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The best warrior class is kind of subjective. In DAoC even hybrids can<br/>
 </span></blockquote>make<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; good tanks. It also depends on your play style.  One thing that is really<br/>
&gt; cool is that tanks can spec in shields. This not only increases the tanks<br/>
&gt; chances to block, but also include shield styles. Its really cool to put<br/>
&gt; your block skill on a buddy that is close by and take shots for him, then<br/>
&gt; turn around and use a shield style that may stun or have some other effect<br/>
&gt; on the person/critter.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I play a bard in Hibernia, but my buddy places a Firbolg Hero (a pretty<br/>
 </span></blockquote>good<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; tank) and he always puts guard, protect and block on me. Each of those<br/>
&gt; serves a purpose. Guard basically allows the Hero/warrior type to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>intercept<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; arrows that were meant for another player so long as the player being<br/>
&gt; guarded is close to the tank. Protect is VERY useful when placed on<br/>
 </span></blockquote>healers<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; since it basically transfers aggro to the tank. Block is as I stated<br/>
 </span></blockquote>above,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; you use your shield to block shots for people.  Block and guard are REALLY<br/>
&gt; useful in RvR as well as PvE.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; One VERY important thing to know about warriors and tanks in DAoC. They<br/>
 </span></blockquote>are<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; not meant to be MEGA damage dealers, they are meant to absorb/block/parry<br/>
&gt; damage.  There are other classes that are REALLY good at laying the smack<br/>
&gt; down, but at the cost of giving up some defensive capability.  Beserkers,<br/>
&gt; Mercenaries and Blademasters are REALLY good at smacking the living tar<br/>
 </span></blockquote>out<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; of something, but they also will take more damage by default.  These<br/>
 </span></blockquote>classes<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; are also known as dual wielding classes. While other classes like the<br/>
&gt; Nightshade, Infiltrator, Shadowblade, Ranger and Scout get a form of dual<br/>
&gt; wield, they typically do not spec in it. The exception being the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Shadowblade<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; (I LOVE this class after my bard)  Instead of getting dual wield,<br/>
&gt; Shadowblades get a skill called leftaxe or LA for short. Dual Wield<br/>
 </span></blockquote>(Albion)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and Celtic Dual (Hibernia) work differently than LA.  Dual wield has a<br/>
&gt; chance to trigger, when it does trigger and it does hit, it hits for max<br/>
&gt; damage. With LA, it swings EVERYTIME, when it hits it does a percentage of<br/>
&gt; the max damage. So while you swing all the time when you hit its partial<br/>
&gt; damage...which is still VERY good.  Its usually only a few points off of<br/>
 </span></blockquote>my<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; main weapon damage, because I keep it pretty high.  Midgard is the only<br/>
&gt; realm that gets LA. Shadowblades, and Beserkers get LA.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So as you can see it depends on how you wish to play.  There are other<br/>
 </span></blockquote>tank<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; classes that you should also look at.  I really like the Midgard Thane.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; thane gets a nice AOE DD spell that smacks big ole hammers on thy enemies,<br/>
&gt; as well as a point blank AOE instant on a 20 second timer, a single DD<br/>
&gt; instant on a 20second timer, a castable DD and a STR/CON buff.  The<br/>
 </span></blockquote>weakside<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; is they are a bit light on the HP, but are a TON of fun to play.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You may also want to checkout a Champion in Hibernia. I have a Lurikeen<br/>
&gt; large weapon champ and he is soooooo cool. He is similar to the thane yet<br/>
&gt; different. Instead of DD he gets some nasty debuffs and a nasty DD<br/>
 </span></blockquote>instant.<br/>

&gt; Basically what you may want to do is to go to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://daoc.catacombs.com">http://daoc.catacombs.com</a><br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; checkout the spell lists and style lists for the classes you wish to<br/>
&gt; checkout. They also have some decent class discussion forums there. I read<br/>
&gt; them quite often.<br/>

&gt; I know this is a bit of a long winded E-mail, but there is a lot to know<br/>

&gt; &gt; I play DAoC. I quit EQ well over a year ago.  Personally, I REALLY like<br/>
&gt; it.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I will be honest and say that I&#39;m not really fond of the dungeons that<br/>
&gt; &gt; originally came with DAoC. They were weak at best. However, the new<br/>
&gt; dungeons<br/>
&gt; &gt; in the expansion are much better and much more EQ like. I always felt<br/>
