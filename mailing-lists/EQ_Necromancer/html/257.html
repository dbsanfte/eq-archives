<b>Subject:</b> Question about pets <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-86661118">Im currently a level 6 gnome necromancer on karana server and Ive got a <br/>
question about pets. Ive heard rumors that your conjuration skill directly <br/>
affects the level of the pet you summon. I was just wondering if there is any <br/>
truth to this because Ive found that I summon from level 3-5 and I usually <br/>
get each level the same number of times. Just wondering if conjuration is <br/>
higher will I summon those level 5 skeletons more often or if they can get <br/>
even more powerful.<br/>
