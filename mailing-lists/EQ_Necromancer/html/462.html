<b>Subject:</b> Re: DElf Necro (9th) Needs hunting / exp / cash tips <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-275728081">I&#39;m a 10lvl DE, and I went from 8-10 mostly in northern RO.  The tunnel to it is<br/>
located on the opposite side of commons from entrance to Nectulos forest.<br/>
I hunt scarabs and desert tarantulas at northern RO.  Scarabs are best, since they do<br/>
not poison, their carapace is worth a gold or so, you can take yellow ones fairly easy:<br/>
lifetap, cast DOTs, keep your pet alive and get some hits in.  Watch out for madman and<br/>
people training mummies.  Mummies can be difficult at 8-9.  Melissa Sandwhisper an NPC<br/>
merchant close to zone border with freeport is tolerant enough to sell to me, she<br/>
carries water and rations.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m frustrated. I&#39;ve got a level 9 Necro DElf, based in Nekk Forest. I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; got 2 problems: a lack of cash and difficulty in gaining exp.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been in in Nekk Forest, and I prefer to solo for the most part. The<br/>
&gt; problem is finding targets to hunt. In Nekk forest, the only mobs that give<br/>
&gt; me experience are Kodiaks and some skeletons. Mummies and zombies too, but<br/>
&gt; those are even more rare, plus there&#39;s usually 3-4 other PC&#39;s camped at the<br/>
&gt; spawn sites. The Lava zone seems to be too high-level for me (from reports<br/>
&gt; from others), and while Eastern commons isn&#39;t too bad the Griffins are<br/>
&gt; murder and getting poisoned by an asp has killed me twice. Last time I went<br/>
&gt; through the commons I died enough that I lost all the exp. gained.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; On top of this is cash flow problems. Since the rank 3 spells each cost 4.5<br/>
&gt; pp, it&#39;s bloody expensive getting them. I picked up tailoring as a trade to<br/>
&gt; hopefully help get extra money, but my skill is maxed at 30 from patchwork<br/>
&gt; armor, and I don&#39;t know that I want to take up smithing to increase it some<br/>
&gt; more (by making studded and re-inforced etc.). I&#39;ve considered maybe taking<br/>
&gt; up another trade to help with getting extra money. Any suggestions?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Desperately waiting to hit 12th level and get some decent offensive spells .<br/>
