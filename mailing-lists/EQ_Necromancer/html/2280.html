<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-599532996">Well, I haven&#39;t ever been on a raid myself, but as far as I know a <br/>
Necro&#39;s main role seems to be as mana battery, from what I hear.<br/>
Bah....when will people ever wake up and realise how good a Necro is? <br/>
We&#39;re low-maintenance &#39;cause we can heal ourselves and have spells of <br/>
our own that are better than the Chanter&#39;s Breeze line. We also kick <br/>
arse with our DOTs and to a lesser extent our DDs (SOP is awesome, <br/>
and the DD vs Undead line is cool too). And I consider the pet as <br/>
half a Tank. Yet when I go into a zone LFG, there&#39;s loads of other <br/>
people LFG too, yet they all seem to get groups and I don&#39;t. Once I <br/>
waited 5 hours in OT for a group and didn&#39;t get one. I know Necros <br/>
are apparantly so good at soloing but it does get boring and even we <br/>
have to med for some time if we use all our mana. And we go down <br/>
quick if we&#39;re being hit and FD doesn&#39;t work or we&#39;re oom.<br/>
Ah, just pouring out what I think here. What does everyone else think?</div>
