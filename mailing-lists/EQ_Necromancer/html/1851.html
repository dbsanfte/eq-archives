<div id="ygrps-yiv-1055933459">Connection speed is definitely an issue when zoning but what about processor <br/>
speed?  I am the first to admit I dont know much about computers, but a group <br/>
of friends and I play and we noticed the person with the slowest processor <br/>
speed takes longest to zone.  My friend who just got a new computer, faster <br/>
than any of ours, now zones faster than any of us too.<br/>
<br/>
So my theory on why the boat waits so long after zoning to get moving again <br/>
is: it&#39;s waiting for the person with the slowest computer or connection speed <br/>
on the boat to zone in.<br/>
<br/>
Whaddaya think?  (Prolly I shouldn&#39;t oughta mess with computers huh?:)<br/>
