&gt; &gt; role playing games.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yes, I have played these games...VERY much and that how I know a good deal<br/>
&gt; about them. They are turn based, but give the illusion of realtime.<br/>
&gt; Basically its you attack, roll, miss, he attacks, roll, hit.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, the attacks are multi-threaded. Your attack speed is N, his attack speed<br/>
is X, and they intertwine randomly. The only difference between that and not<br/>
having an auto-attack is that you can&#39;t /hesitate/ easily in attacking. Even<br/>
if you had no auto-attack, you could only swing so fast, and would probably<br/>
try to emulate auto-attack with your blows.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I did misuse the word &quot;persepective&quot; here. However, the point I was trying<br/>
&gt; to convery was that in my opinion something like SWG should not be turn<br/>
&gt; based. It should be more in line with Unreal Touney, Quake 3, Doom 3, etc.<br/>
&gt; Aiming a weapon at point blank range and letting the computer basically<br/>
&gt; roll<br/>
&gt; a die to see if it hit you sucks. It sounds like they have the right idea<br/>
&gt; for the space flight expansion however.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hopefully you won&#39;t auto-attack with a blaster, anyway. You&#39;ll at least have<br/>
to fire manually, like range weapons in EQ.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And to answer the first part of your question, the answer is no. I never<br/>
&gt; have and never will. You can&#39;t expect to do well in these games if you kill<br/>
&gt; half of your freakin brain cells.  I am a professional software developer<br/>
&gt; and you can&#39;t expect to be a doper, write good code and keep your job when<br/>
&gt; you are stoned.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>True, which is part of why I don&#39;t. I certainly did experiment with them at<br/>
one time, though, which I consider helpful in one&#39;s overall intellectual<br/>
evolution. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; What, by the way, does RvR mean?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Realm vs. Realm combat. I believe Marlon answered that one in another post<br/>
&gt; so I won&#39;t give you the gory details.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One thing I /hated/ about Anarchy Online was the ridiculous, narrow<br/>
Corporation vs Rebellion nonsense, where you&#39;re trapped into this bi-partisan<br/>
struggle, which is so absolutely not like real life outside of politics...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; EQ2 uses the same engine as Star Wars Galaxies, which you were just<br/>
&gt; dissing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Um, not in the slightest. Try reading the FAQ from each game sometime. They<br/>
&gt; have created TWO totally seperate engines. The EQ2 engine is still VERY<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That certainly wasn&#39;t the original plan. They were to use the same graphics<br/>
engine, but that was a year ago...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; Nope, their lack of foresight&#39;s probably losing them this player. I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; have the resources nowadays to spend ANY money &quot;just in case I like it<br/>
&gt; more<br/>
&gt; &gt; than the game I enjoy playing now&quot;. Even when I was annoyed with EQ a<br/>
&gt; year<br/>
&gt; &gt; ago, there were plenty of MMORPGs out there who would let me try them<br/>
&gt; free.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well, that of course is entirely up to you.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, it&#39;s them. Most companies have enough sense to offer demos of good<br/>
products. In the case of MMORPGs the percentage of income from actually<br/>
selling the title is vanishing, so it&#39;s just plain dumb to not encourage<br/>
people to try it (and thus subscribe) at the cost of risking a little in game sales.<br/>
