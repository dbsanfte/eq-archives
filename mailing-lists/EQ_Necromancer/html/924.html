&lt;&lt; but what is this book I see all the higher<br/>
 up have?   Can you give us the scoop?    What is the avg price for the INT<br/>
 earings?<br/>

<br/>
Book is +4 int +30 mana you put in your primary hand and canot equip a weapon <br/>
only the book or a weapon <br/>
<br/>
If you could buy this book it would most likely be in the 500+ PP range it is <br/>
a rare spawn off najena <br/>
<br/>
the earings probably would go for around 50pp (though I have never seen them <br/>
for sale) kinda rare also though you probably could get them in a day at <br/>
gnoll camp in unrest they come from embalmers. <br/>
