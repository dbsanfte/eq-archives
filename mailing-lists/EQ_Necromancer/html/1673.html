<b>Subject:</b> Where to hunt and research at lvl 20 <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-851079801">HI all, first of all a question about where to hunt at lvl 20. I have<br/>
recieved several suggestions and basically narrowed it down two - skarana<br/>
treants are cordelia minister (bard at nkarana wizard spires). I was<br/>
wondering what yur guys opinions where? I think perhaps its a good idea to<br/>
hunt cordelia until lvl 22 and then head to the treants in south karana-<br/>
does that seem sensible, or should i just go ahead and do the treants - and<br/>
if so does anyone have any tips for hunting cordelia and/or the treants?<br/>
Now, onto questions about research - all ahs been going fine up until now<br/>
and i have been researching many spells (infact I have several lvl 16 and<br/>
20 nes for sale - any suggestins n where to market them?) but I am having<br/>
problems with harmshield which i have failed 4 times! I have trained into<br/>
research as much as possible at lvl 20, I have also practiced lt by making<br/>
spells and seen no rise so I am guessing it is as high as it will go for my<br/>
lvl - why shoudl i fail this spell so often? especially as many ther lvl 20<br/>
ones are trivial to me. Also I am finding the words needed fr it difficult<br/>
to get - words of refuge are quite common but I have no more words of<br/>
absorbtion, they seem t be very rare, and was wondering where the best<br/>
place to get lvl 20 and lvl 24 research words (i need the ones for my lvl<br/>
24 pet etc.)? Finally, does anyoen have any inf on what the cap is for<br/>
research at different lvl&#39;s? If nay of you higher lvl necros on solusek ro<br/>
could give me a hand getting my spells etc. i would really appreciate it -<br/>
thanks in advance - Malados soulkeeper lvl 20 gnomish necro on the Solusek<br/>
Ro server.<br/>

p.s. please excuse any typos especially those invlving an o r a missing o<br/>
as the o key on my keyboard is screwing up</div>
