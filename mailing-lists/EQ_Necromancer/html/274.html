&gt;	Sorry, black con?  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen one of those.  What<br/>
&gt;does that mean?  The only things I&#39;ve seen were<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;	Green, green risky, blue, blue risky, white, yellow, red.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve never seen a black con I don&#39;t think.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If you change your view to the Windowed view.  You know the brighter one<br/>
that makes it harder to see at night.  When you con things that are white<br/>
it shows up in black text in the windowed view.  Because the windowed view<br/>
is the Default.  I think they made it change to white text in the<br/>
transparent view so you can read it.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully some day they will let us change our text colors.  Blue can be<br/>
hard to read in some areas as well.  And I still don&#39;t understand why they<br/>
made guildchat a NEON Green.<br/>
