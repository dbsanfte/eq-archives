<div id="ygrps-yiv-553043373">Ok Im level 24.. you think I would be rejoicing. Well I am not. I dont want<br/>
to kill steel. Thats low, and just wrong in my books. I have been looking<br/>
for a spot to kill and I cant. Treants are always full. Aviak City is<br/>
crammed. I really need to find some where I can go. Dose any one have some<br/>
clue? I know I dont.<br/>
