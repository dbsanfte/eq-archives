<div id="ygrps-yiv-542460479">You can enter dark elf city and converse with the mechants but to get higher faction I would invis undead into the necro guild and do the fire beetle eye quest but I have found that faction has a cap so you may never get high faction with some races also you could kill at those halfling camps since your rivervale faction is screwed and is already at zero so it cant get any lower. Trolls hate ya but they are just ready to attack so I think that if you can find some monsters that will inprove your faction with them. I find guards are the ones you always you have the lowest faction with so the merchants inside will be dubious.<br/>
