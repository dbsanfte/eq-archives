<div id="ygrps-yiv-812761887">If you don&#39;t mind taking a ride over to Faydwer, the Chessboard in<br/>
Butcherblock is a good place to get 10-12 as a Necromancer. If you are<br/>
facing out of the entrance to Greater Faydark, follow the right wall and it<br/>
will shortly be on your left. It&#39;s hard to miss: Giant chesspieces and LARGE<br/>
skeletons....<br/>

&gt; Hi all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I very recently changed servers and I just got to level 9 with my new DE<br/>
&gt; Necro.  It has been awhile since I was level 9 on my old server so what I<br/>
&gt; did to get through those horrible levels 10 and especially 11 is a little<br/>
&gt; hazy.  I know a lot of people say Skel Llrod; however, I do remember<br/>
trying<br/>
&gt; to do that and remember him being camped, having lots of problems with my<br/>
&gt; pet, and getting attacked by 20 giant rats and skels every time I tried to<br/>
&gt; med.  So I have a couple questions:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1) Any other suggestions for levels 10 and 11<br/>
&gt; 2) Is there some trick to pets and medding in Befallen or do I need a REAL<br/>
&gt; tank<br/>
&gt; 3) Are fire drakes in lava storm doable at 10 and 11 and more importantly<br/>
&gt; are they good exp?... I went to lavastorm for the first time when I was 12<br/>
&gt; and I remember all the drakes were blue to me then... Since they have a<br/>
fire<br/>
&gt; attack I&#39;m not sure if my pet and I could hold up for long.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks everyone ,<br/>
&gt; Azerin<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; P.S. I know these kind of posts come along all the time... maybe we should<br/>
&gt; make a Necro guide :)<br/>
