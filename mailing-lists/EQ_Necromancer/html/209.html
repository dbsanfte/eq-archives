mana cost for the possible damage is OK.  And the duration increases as your <br/>
level increases (or at least its duration is long enough make it worth its <br/>
mana.  I tend to get two &quot;flares&quot; off of each casting, making it worth as <br/>
much as the higher level Tap spell.  I have gotten three, and once even four <br/>
off during its duration, making it worth MORE than the higher level Tap.<br/>
