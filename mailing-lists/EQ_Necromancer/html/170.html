<b>Subject:</b> Was Spell Search, Now Research <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-430599151">Thanks to all who answered my questions about where to find spells. I now<br/>
have everyhting I need after shopping in Freeport. I was not able to find<br/>
Banshee Aura. I am told this is a spell that must be researched.<br/>
I have some questions about research.<br/>
<br/>
I made level 16 and went to my guild. I was only able to train one point<br/>
into research. Is this normal? If so, why do I have 50 practice points saved<br/>
up.... Nevertheless, I do have some questions. How do I research? I think<br/>
there is a book I&#39;m supposed to buy, but don&#39;t know the title. Will it tell<br/>
me how to research spells? Is research like smithing where I will be<br/>
combining things in attempts to get a success? Does each spell have a<br/>
separate &quot;recipe&quot; or do I just combine the same things and see what happens?<br/>
And lastly, I saw a whole bunch of books for sale which I suspect are<br/>
related to research, With titles like Calling Forth the Darkness. How do I<br/>
know these books are for necromancers or not? Any help would be great.<br/>
Thanks....<br/>
<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt;If anyone knows where these spells can be found, please let me know. I<br/>
have<br/>
&gt; searched all of Akanon and am losing the life that once drove me. My<br/>
undying<br/>
&gt; gratitude to any who answer the call.&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I found the majority of the 16th level spells in Freeport...  You have to<br/>
check<br/>
&gt; a lot of different vendors (theres about 8 of them) under the city but<br/>
most of<br/>
&gt; them are there...<br/>
