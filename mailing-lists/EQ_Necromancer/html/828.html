<b>Subject:</b> Gnome Necromancers in Neriak? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1135859333">Does anyone out there have any experience with Gnome necromancers traveling into Neriak?  I have killed some Crushbone orcs in Lesser Faydark, but not alot.  Is there a relative safe barometer within Neriak I could con that would give me an indication of my faction before I wander around in there too much?</div>
