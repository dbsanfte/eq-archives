<div id="ygrps-yiv-1723694029"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I am currently level 20 and I am hunting Gorge<br/>
&gt; Hounds in EK. Are there any<br/>
&gt; suggestions as to where and what I should be hunting<br/>
&gt; to level somewhat<br/>
&gt; quickly. Speed is NOT of the essence, I guess I am<br/>
&gt; looking for a somewhat<br/>
&gt; safe yet efficient spot.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Couple places not often camped... <br/>
<br/>
1) 19 shamen orc in Kithcor... zone from HH and turn<br/>
to your right then run till you get to corner. I never<br/>
died there, dont fear cause there are a few lower lvl<br/>
orc near by that could kill you... Dark.. (make sure<br/>
pets taunt it off) sic pet.. Dot... run... life tap...<br/>
run (I ran backwards) along the wall till mob is dead.<br/>
Dies realtivly guickly.<br/>
<br/>
2) Lars McManuss is lvl 20 barb in WK kinda tough but<br/>
if your carful you wont die.. wouldnt try unless you<br/>
have atleast 150 int though.  I like to turn pets<br/>
tuant off... dark till it sticks...  DOT and LT till<br/>
dead with a fear thrown in on occasstion.  Good new is<br/>
a lot fo druids camp the area and with a sow i never<br/>
once died :-)<br/>
<br/>
3) Cordelia Minister in NK is very tough but do able<br/>
but be prepared to zone a lot cuase on occasion you<br/>
will pull a guard by accident. she is lvl 18-22<br/>
<br/>
4) In Lesser Faydark there is a GREAT npc that is<br/>
rarely camped. Forget the name.  Very near the zone to<br/>
Steamfont is some cottages.  She is in the one  to the<br/>
far southwest. Very safe as the zone is right there, i<br/>
got killed like 1 time in 2 lvls here i beleieve.<br/>
belive mob to be 20-22 in lvl.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway.. theres a few places.<br/>
