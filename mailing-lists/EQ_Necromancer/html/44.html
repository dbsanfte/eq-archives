<b>Subject:</b> Re: Finding a staff <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-940184964">You&#39;ll be hard pressed to find someone that sells a worn weapon regularly,<br/>
normally they are only sold after someone sold one to them.  just keep<br/>
shopping around, eventually someone will sell one.<br/>
<br/>
Along the same lines though, I&#39;ve been using a giant snake fang for a good<br/>
chunk of my career &lt;till level 8&gt; and i&#39;m wondering if i should start<br/>
working on my staff skill.  are the later better weapons all staff based, or<br/>
are there some good high level necro usable daggers out there?  I just don&#39;t<br/>
want to wait too long and have my staff skill near impossible to get up.<br/>
also, one handed or two handed staves?  with my luck i&#39;ll take a two hander<br/>
and all the magic necro staves will be one handed &lt;grins&gt; anyhow, that&#39;s it<br/>
from me for a while.<br/>
