Hmmm, I just went to Dell and built a pretty nice<br/>
PC (2.4Ghz, 64 MB video, 512 RAM, 19 in monitor) for about<br/>
$1100, so I guess the average PC cost is lower than<br/>
$1200.<br/>
<br/>
I just can&#39;t keep up with how prices are falling.<br/>

Hi,<br/>
<br/>
Actually a corporate accountant might reply something like<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Giving the game away as a demo has its merits in building<br/>
market share and enticing customers to regularly subscribe.<br/>
<br/>
However, given that most customers have already spent an<br/>
average of $1200 on a PC, and $40 a month on DSL, the additional<br/>
 investment of $20 is minimal.<br/>
<br/>
The retail product placement fees are quite<br/>
large, and lower retail  sales would not make up for them.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, the equipment and personnel to support 10,000<br/>
customers a month downloading 600 MB of data is extremely<br/>
expensive. Since the downloads are not spread evenly over the<br/>
course of the day, extra equipment is needed that is idle<br/>
during non peak hours.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So, essentially the company figures most customers aren&#39;t<br/>
so thrifty as you, Kaz, and also don&#39;t want the expense of<br/>
providing the download. I remember living on a grad student<br/>
stipend, so I can understand your decision, but I also know<br/>
that to lots of people, $20 is just an impulse buy.<br/>
<br/>

Notes:<br/>
<br/>
Product placement fees are the extra bribes the software<br/>
company pays to Best Buy,Fryes, etc to keep the game on the<br/>
store shelf.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not gonna argue the $1200 PC cost either. I know some<br/>
PCs are pretty cheap, but others cost much more than $1200.<br/>

&gt; Well, that of course is entirely up to you.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, it&#39;s them. Most companies have enough sense to offer demos of good<br/>
products. In the case of MMORPGs the percentage of income from actually<br/>
selling the title is vanishing, so it&#39;s just plain dumb to not encourage<br/>
people to try it (and thus subscribe) at the cost of risking a little in<br/>
game sales.<br/>
