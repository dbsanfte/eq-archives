  [EQ_Necromancer] Re: Should pets be given weapons above level 
  20?<br><br></font></div><tt>Just wanted to point out, because it wasn&#39;t 
  directly mentioned.&nbsp; Giving<br>your pet fast 1h weapons won&#39;t do anything 
  for you anymore, besides look<br>cool.&nbsp; Their delay is fixed, and their 
  damage has a minimum.&nbsp; So you can&#39;t<br>make them any faster (except with 
  buffs) but you can make them hit harder<br>by giving them the big 2h 
  weapons.&nbsp; The advantage pretty much falls off<br>once your pet starts to 
  bash and kick.<br><br>There is one other benifit of hunting down a magician 
  for weapons at low<br>level.&nbsp; I &#39;believe&#39; if your under 12th level your 
  pet will not be able to<br>hit magicial only creatures.&nbsp; While most magic 
  only creatures will probably<br>kick a solo necro&#39;s butt under 12th 
  level.&nbsp; If your in a group and want<br>your pet to provide additional 
  damage killing wisps and such, you might<br>want to find a mage to get some 
  summoned daggers for your pet.<br><br>Lomack<br><br>&gt;I would also like to 
  point out that starting at lvl 39 pets will <br>&gt;automatically dual weild 
  so you don&#39;t have to give them weapons for <br>&gt;this.&nbsp; Basically, 
  giving your pets weapons after 39 is wasting cash <br>&gt;and weight.&nbsp; 
  However, there are certain circumstances where a weapon <br>&gt;is very 
  beneficial.&nbsp; Procing weapons can add a bit to the damage your <br>&gt;pet 
  produces.&nbsp; My favorite is the vellium weapons dropped by giants, 
  <br>&gt;dwarves and such in velious.&nbsp; Since delay doesn&#39;t matter and 
  after <br>&gt;about lvl 16 dmg is irrelevant you equip your pet for effect on 
  the <br>&gt;proc.&nbsp; If you are hunting in nejena or the hole get a couple 
  of <br>&gt;swords from your friendly mage as the ward summoned proc is a nice 
  <br>&gt;little bit of additional damage (about 41pts).<br>&gt;<br>&gt;The 
  thing is, at least for necro&#39;s, your pet is very effective <br>&gt;without a 
  weapon. So why waste the time, energy and cash on getting <br>&gt;it 
  weapons?<br>&gt;<br>&gt;From levels 1 through 12 it&#39;s a good thing to get the 
  biggest meanest <br>&gt;2 hander you can loot.&nbsp; This can dramatically 
  increase your pets <br>&gt;damage output.&nbsp; At 16 you really need the high 
  end 2handers like fine <br>&gt;steel to even get a marginal improvement in 
  damage.&nbsp; <br>&gt;<br>&gt;/pet attack &lt;G&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Maldain
