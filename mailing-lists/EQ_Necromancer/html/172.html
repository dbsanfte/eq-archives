<div id="ygrps-yiv-1744917733">Hello all<br/>
<br/>
I have been looking over some site&#39;s spell lists for the necromancer. I have<br/>
recently created one as a 2nd char and am up to lev 5.<br/>
<br/>
I noticed we get some spells that erode our hps while regenerating our mana<br/>
at the same time. Does that imply we can use the enemy MOB as a hp battery<br/>
to solo with minimal net loss of hps or manna?<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what I mean. Can I cast &quot;dark pack&quot; (name might be wrong) or &quot;allure<br/>
of death&quot; on myself. Thus my hps start to fall. Then I engage the enemy with<br/>
the classic 3 DOT spells plus send my pet in. By this time I&#39;m out half my<br/>
manna from the DOT and my hps are falling from the &quot;Allure of death&quot; or<br/>
whatever. My manna is comming back faster then normal as well. Can I now<br/>
life drain the enemy for hps that will turn to manna to use to life drain<br/>
enemy again? Will this hold up in a fight? IE. The fight ends and I still<br/>
have most my hps and half my manna? As the life drains ended up being free<br/>
as they were from the monsters hps converted to my hps converted to manna?<br/>
<br/>
I am interested in this or other fighting styles?<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely a curious young necromancer<br/>
