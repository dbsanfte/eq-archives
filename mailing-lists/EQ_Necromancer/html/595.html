    So you know. I was killed in fithwell after I con a guard. It said indfferently. So I uninvised my self. Well the gm said that thats just faction standing, and has nothing t do with ratial hatried when you con something. Kind of silly isnt it. <br/>
<br/>
     <br/>
    question: I killed a lot of ORCS so I am indifferent from most guards I see now . . .<br/>
<br/>
    but, I need to buy my lesser shielding spell and was wondering if I will be KOS inside felwithe . . .  anyone know?<br/>
<br/>
    I mean if guards outside are not KOS I should be ok inside buying spells right? </span></blockquote></div>
