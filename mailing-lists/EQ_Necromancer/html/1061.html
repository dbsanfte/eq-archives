&gt;is Gnome Necro kos in ogre or Troll City?<br/>
&gt;if so , how do i raise the faction?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unfortunately for a Gnome there currently is no way to become liked by the<br/>
trolls or the ogres.  I haven&#39;t found any mobs that give troll or ogre<br/>
faction.  The only way to boost Troll or Oger faction is if you already<br/>
have enough to enter the town and get quests.  You can gain faction from<br/>
the quests but if your already KOS, your apparently SOL as well.<br/>
