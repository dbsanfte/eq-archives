<div id="ygrps-yiv-1342210660">This is a list of places to hunt that I got off another list.  Hope this<br/>
helps anyone that reads it.<br/>
<br/>
7-10 - Innothule swamp (Kill Froglocks, then Froglock fishermen,<br/>
then finally Kobold Hunters) The frogs and fishermen spawn near<br/>
Guk on two small islands, the hunters on a small island near the<br/>
zone entrance from South Ro (great place for netted and woven<br/>
armor). Toward the latter end of this I went in to upper guk and<br/>
fought the low level creatures. If at all possible ... avoid<br/>
this. You will die a lot from trains and the pay back is not<br/>
worth it until later levels. Tactics include pulling with a DOT<br/>
and then letting your pet tank as you rotate with him. Only use<br/>
life steal if you or your pet are low in health. (alternate -<br/>
East Commmons against orc camps or wandering monsters)<br/>
<br/>
9-11 - South Ro, West Commons, North Ro, and Oasis. Start in<br/>
South Ro or West Commons with the Orc camps. You will usually<br/>
need help. Pick up a fellow necro if possible, or a tank. Move up<br/>
to Derv camps in South Ro, North Ro, and West Commons. The Derv<br/>
camps can vary greatly in level so I suggest at least a party of<br/>
2, preferably more. Again, a small group of DE&#39;s is great. Same<br/>
tactics as Innothule only you may or may not have an additional<br/>
DOT. While fighting Dervs in North Ro or South Ro, keep the ward<br/>
undead spell loaded if possible. You might be able to take some<br/>
of the lower wandering undead, and even the higher ones if you<br/>
are in a party. (alternate - East and West Commons wandering<br/>
monsters.)<br/>
<br/>
11-15 - Sister Island in Ocean of Tears - I would suggest waiting<br/>
until level 12 when you can get bind but if you want to brave it<br/>
... go right ahead. The sisters come in different levels but most<br/>
of the same level wear the same clothing type. Be careful pulling<br/>
as they tend to gang up. A good tactic is to park your pet on the<br/>
edge of the island outcroppings. Give him the &#39;guard here&#39;<br/>
command. Then run out and pull a sister back with a darkness<br/>
spell. That will slow her down so you can scramble back to your<br/>
pet. When she arrives, let him tank and cast another DOT. Then<br/>
melee.... you should have no problem one at a time, but don&#39;t do<br/>
multiples until you get higher in level. Give the first halberd<br/>
to your pet. Throw the rest away, only keep the belts. You can<br/>
sell them to players, or to a merchant for a minimum of a plat<br/>
each. (alternate - Befallen, second level; Unrest, yard trash)<br/>
<br/>
14-18 - High Hold Pass - Start on the close side, also called the<br/>
orc side. Try to party up ... there should be PLENTY of people<br/>
needing a nuker at that point. Do what Necro&#39;s do best ... DOT<br/>
and lifesteal until you are OOM, then meditate and restart. The<br/>
action is quick and so is the spawn here. There is a LOT of kill<br/>
stealing so deal with it. Trust me ... at this level your loot is<br/>
just so-so anyway so don&#39;t get upset at losing it sometimes. You<br/>
are KOS by the guards and citizens of High Hold ... stay away<br/>
from them. As you gain levels you CAN try the opposite side,<br/>
called the gnoll side. It&#39;s not as fun and the repop rate is<br/>
slower. Any named Orc or Gnoll usually has great loot items (some<br/>
extremely nice) but again ... at your level I wouldn&#39;t even think<br/>
about it unless you are with a powerful group. (Alternates -<br/>
Befallen, 3rd level; Gorge of King Xorbb, muddites, lesser<br/>
mino&#39;s, lesser beholders.)<br/>
<br/>
16-20+ - South Karana - Now it gets fun. Start on the Aviak<br/>
treehouse. Camp at the base of the tree. You can form parties<br/>
here easily. I like this camp more than the one in Lake Rathe.<br/>
It&#39;s a hell of a lot easier to get around and I like the wide<br/>
open plains better than the lake. Tactics at this point should<br/>
include a darkness DOT to start, send pet to attack, cast fear on<br/>
mob, while pet chases cast second DOT, if possible cast third<br/>
DOT, run in and finish with melee. Multiples are NOT an option<br/>
here ... it&#39;s single city for you unless you are grouped. Start<br/>
with egrets, then move to rooks, and then continue up the<br/>
treehouse ... you should figure it out quickly. You can also kill<br/>
elephants and lower centaurs. (Alternate - Unrest, house<br/>
monsters.)<br/>
<br/>
At that point I&#39;ll stop. You should know where to go from there<br/>
and if not you can always post to the list. Besides this is where<br/>
I am now so I can&#39;t give good advice on the upper levels. :)<br/>
<br/>
Remember at level 16 to go to South Ro and see the DE merchant in<br/>
the desert (t one of the three that is a Miner or Smith). Give<br/>
her a greater lightstone and get your practice research book.<br/>
Give her lesser lightstones until you get BOTH volume one and two<br/>
of the rune books. Use the info in these books to raise your<br/>
research skill. You will start getting components off of monsters<br/>
from level 14 on.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck and follow the dark path ....<br/>
