<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Another annoying thing that peeved me off was not being able to attack<br/>

effect at all.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
This I can understand. In Nek Forrest there are piranhas in a river that<br/>
runs under a bridge (first hand experience here) that&#39;ll wipe out any of the<br/>
newbies in the area should they fall in. If you could kill those piranhas<br/>
without going into the water, every newbie would be taking mages and<br/>
leveling up to 12 in 2 days. While I can see your point about realism, I<br/>
think that this is better as it prevents cheap and easy experience.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Something else is their apparent psychic connection with the planet.  I<br/>
 </span></blockquote>mean, seriously, you&#39;re completely across the zone from the thing and it<br/>
will still know where you&#39;re at, even if you&#39;re far under ground and it&#39;s<br/>
top side _and_ all the way on the other side of the zone make its way to you<br/>
through maze or &#39;high water&#39; and begin pounding the snot out of you&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
If there&#39;s one thing that does need to be fixed, it is this. You can&#39;t run<br/>
away from anyone unless you&#39;ve cast some spell that slows your enemy down.<br/>
On top of that, they don&#39;t stop unless you zone or they&#39;re killed by<br/>
somebody. It&#39;d be nice if the game had a LOS variable for monsters that<br/>
figured whether or not they knew where you were at any given point.</div>
