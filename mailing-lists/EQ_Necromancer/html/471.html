<b>Subject:</b> Fw: Pet class suggestion.. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1695664505">I posted a message to EQ Necros and Mages about adding a spell that gave the<br/>
level of the pet being summoned.. It was pointed out that Verant wasn&#39;t<br/>
likely to do anything that would show numerical information..  Still unhappy<br/>
with the fact that one could exactly gage a pets ability (by /conning) at<br/>
the level one gains the new pet spell, but knows less about it as they go up<br/>
I came up with the idea of having a message pop up when summoning a new pet<br/>
that basically does a /con of the pet in regards to the level of the spell<br/>
not the level of the caster (So irregardless of level you know if your pet<br/>
is good average or weak for it&#39;s level..)<br/>
<br/>
Today I got a reply.. Hoping maybe it&#39;ll be implemented in the future..<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;    As it stands now, when a new pet spell is gained, you summon the pet,<br/>
&gt; /con it, and have a pretty good gage of it&#39;s ability.. (Level above, level<br/>
&gt; below, or equal to the level of the spell)..  But as you go up in level<br/>
your<br/>
&gt; ability to gage the creature (which you&#39;ve had time to use, and logically,<br/>
&gt; should have a better ability to gage) gets worse.  This gets even worse<br/>
&gt; until you hit the next spell level..<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;    A simple message that says at the time of casting - You summon a<br/>
&gt; weak/average/strong pet of it&#39;s kind.  Would solve this, and I don&#39;t think<br/>
&gt; would be horrific to code (just adding a text message as opposed to new<br/>
&gt; spells or new game logic..)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;    Anyway.. That&#39;s my wish..  And if there is a logic reason for the<br/>
&gt; current situation, could you explain it to me?  I understand the need for<br/>
&gt; randomness (I actually like that as opposed to always having an average<br/>
&gt; pet).. But I don&#39;t understand why the summoner, who should know his pet<br/>
&gt; better than any, has to find a lower level character and ask, &quot;How strong<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; this pet?&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;         Hmmm - I&#39;ll bounce this one around the dev team...  thanks for the<br/>
&gt; suggestion.  :)<br/>
