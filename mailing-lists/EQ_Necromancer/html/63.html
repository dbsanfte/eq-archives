<div id="ygrps-yiv-813309144">If I were you I&#39;d make the trip to Freeport (its not difficult but<br/>
can be dangerous), Bind there, and go to Befallen.  With Ward you should be<br/>
able to handle everyone but Lrodd on the first floor as long as you stay<br/>
wary of trains from the lower floors.  Tagteam Lrodd with some other<br/>
buddies, but by level 10 you should be able to take him down yourself.  I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t suggest going down to till level 12 AND WITH a group of<br/>
like-leveled people.  Trains are a constant threat down there... either<br/>
people going too deep for their own good in level 2, or the high-leveled<br/>
freaks (16-20) biting off more than they can chew on level 3 and running<br/>
upstairs.  <br/>
	After a bit you&#39;ll figure out the &quot;train tracks&quot; and its fairly easy<br/>
to stay away from them.  Things to remember:<br/>
<br/>
A) Ghouls have an absurd agg range.  Basically if you are in the same room,<br/>
they&#39;ll be back for you.  If I see a ghoul blow past chasing someone heading<br/>
for the exit I&#39;ll be right behind it till the exit, then I&#39;ll sick my<br/>
skeleton on it, time the attacks, then run past while its recharging.  If<br/>
you happen to be in a room and you see it through a doorway you should be<br/>
fine.  NEVER REST ON THE TRAIN TRACKS, go into a room or dead-end, never in<br/>
the main foyer or the train tracks... you&#39;re just asking for a whupping.<br/>
<br/>
B) Pets act WEIRD in dungeons.  Apparently there&#39;s either not enough room or<br/>
they are constantly jostling for position or something, but your pet WILL be<br/>
constantly moving, sometimes they will move as far as 50 feet away and run<br/>
back to you.  REMEMBER THIS:  ALWAYS keep track of your pet.  If you don&#39;t<br/>
see it its probably a couple rooms back trying to get to you.  If you see<br/>
that:<br/>
<br/>
Taunting Attacker Master<br/>
Taunting Attacker Master<br/>
...<br/>
<br/>
	This is usually my cue to leave Befallen posthaste.  This means your<br/>
skeleton was trying to get to you, and ran into opposition.  On the lower<br/>
levels (2 and 3) the undead are packed like sardines, so usually pissing off<br/>
one will piss all within a one room radius off too.  Do what I used to do<br/>
and leave Befallen immediately.<br/>
	Other stupid things they will do:<br/>
1) Open doors and walk through them for you, often bringing back everything<br/>
in the next room.<br/>
2) Walk back a ways and bring back any respawns to you.<br/>
3) NOT be there when you do attack because they are tooling around two rooms<br/>
behind you.<br/>
<br/>
	Its not pretty but don&#39;t worry, once you get the hang of it, its<br/>
fairly easy to keep track of it.  You can often use the &quot;/pet sit down&quot; and<br/>
&quot;/pet guard here&quot; to keep them tied in one place for a bit... just don&#39;t<br/>
forget to &quot;/pet as you were&quot; when you get ready to leave, which I often<br/>
invariably do.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m a human necro, and i&#39;ve just gotten ward undead and <br/>
&gt; realized just how<br/>
&gt; neat it is compared to my previous blasting spells, and was <br/>
&gt; wondering if<br/>
&gt; anyone knew of any neat undead infested spots near queynos <br/>
&gt; for a level 8<br/>
&gt; necro, and how to get to them?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
