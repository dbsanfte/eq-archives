<div id="ygrps-yiv-1271984496">Well I don&#39;t know about the ones in Runneye, but in East Karanas, one conned <br/>
even to me at level 17.I made the foolish mistake of trying to fight <br/>
it(although I already knew that they could charm, maybe I was just bored, <br/>
hehe)and I got rocked.It charmed my pet and used it against me(which is what <br/>
usually happens).I think that some Eyes are Wizards, but the majority of them <br/>
are Enchanters.They can cast all of that classes spells of whatever level <br/>
they are.(I know it sounds kind of confusing how I wrote that, but basically <br/>
if an Eye was level 17 it would be able to cast all of the level 16 spells <br/>
for that class)<br/>
