<div><font face="Arial" size="2">At 29 your pet can dual weild (somtimes the high 24 
pet will but ONLY the highest one have I ever gotten to do it).&nbsp; In order 
for it to duel weild it must have 2 1h weapons (one in each hand for any of you 
who may not have caught that).&nbsp; When duel weilding (the way I understand 
it)&nbsp; Every round the pet will have a chance for the duel weild skill to 
proc or &quot;fire&quot; so to speak.&nbsp; In that round you will see three attacks from 
your pet instead of the normal two.&nbsp; sometimes if really lucky your pet 
will duel weild, kick and bash all in the same round.&nbsp; TALK ABOUT a KILLING 
MACHINE.&nbsp; from 16 to 24 I have to agree that giving a pet a weapn can only 
slow it down if you give it the wrong weapon (such as a 2h weapon that has a 
delay over 30) but in contrary giving it a weapon with a delay below 30 will not 
speed it up (this I think sucks!).&nbsp; as far as the armor I do not 
know.&nbsp; wish there was a way to find out but I dont know of 
any.</font></div>

  <div><br></div><tt>It is my understanding and my experience that says weapons 
  to pets from 16 <br>to 28 are just a waste of pp. At 29 your pet will begin to 
  dual wield and <br>will require 2, 1 hand weapons. As for the AC flag I have 
  been told by many <br>long time Necro&#39;s that a single piece of armor will help 
  your pet with AC. <br>How much I don&#39;t know.<br><br>Fallonn Vargyle<br>Level
