<div id="ygrps-yiv-78696625">I have a question for you all. Where the hell Aviaks In Lake Rathe.<br/>
<br/>
Also I have saved up 37 skill points for resurch. I was told by someone that<br/>
when they got to level 16 they could only train once in that skill. Ok dont<br/>
make me cry. Let me down softly. Is it true?<br/>
<br/>
One last question. I need to find out if this is rumor or true. S O W<br/>
rings(spirit of the wolf) do they realy exsist. Or is this just another<br/>
rumor to make us lower levels drool. If any one knows anything on this I<br/>
would like info. Being a necro with out doge to level 22, when a pet dies<br/>
god you got be able to run. I hate it when your pet dies for a stupied<br/>
resason and a blue uper hand kills you. Grrrr!!</div>
