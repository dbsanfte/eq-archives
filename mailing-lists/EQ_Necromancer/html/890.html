<b>Subject:</b> Oh yeah.. Lavastorm notes 2 <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2051506831">Something else I noticed about Lavastorm, everything resists heat blood. Which<br/>
is too bad. I guess because it&#39;s fire based (?). My best DOT and I can&#39;t use<br/>
it.. So I have to stick with Engulfing Darkness (resisted 50% of the time) and<br/>
Poison Bolt (resisted 20% of the time). Also started using Vampiric Embrace<br/>
because I&#39;m always getting into melee, but I have only seen it go off once in<br/>
like 20 battles. Finally bought Lifedraw too (now that I&#39;m making money) and<br/>
what a great spell over the lower one. 41pts of damage makes a big difference<br/>
in this zone.</div>
