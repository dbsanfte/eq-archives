<div id="ygrps-yiv-554839366">i dont know about it being found in befallen, but i know they are rather <br/>
common in najena.  i own one that i purchased off a cleric.  it is a necro <br/>
only dagger, 3dmg and i think a 32 delay (rather high).  the bonuses are +3 <br/>
int and +15 mana, and as stated earlier it can be held in the thrown slot.  <br/>
it is also magical, so it makes a rather good backup for me (im best at <br/>
piercing).  next time i go on i&#39;ll see if it is marked pending lore, but i <br/>
think it is already a lore item.<br/>

&gt; &gt; The Dagger can be found on Priest Amiaz in Befallen on the Third<br/>
&gt; &gt; Floor.  It is a rare spawn, but not as bad as the BBC or Gossimer Robe I<br/>
&gt; &gt; think.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; As for Pending Lore, I do not know.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It&#39;s been a lore item all along. :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;as far as being rare, my monk friend got 6 of them in the time he was<br/>
&gt;looking for barbed leggings for a cleric.  definitely not as rare as the<br/>
&gt;robe/bbc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;one of the cool things about it is, you can put it in your ranged weapon<br/>
&gt;slot, and still carry your glowing crook/runed totem or what have you.<br/>
&gt;Since the dagger is only 3 dmg it&#39;s mostly sought after for the magical<br/>
&gt;additions to your stats. (+5 int and some mana I believe, I&#39;ll have to <br/>
&gt;check<br/>
&gt;next time I&#39;m in game) by carrying it in the ranged slot, you still get<br/>
&gt;those benefits, without having to downgrade your melee damage severely.  Of<br/>
&gt;course if you aren&#39;t using a magical weapon already, by all means put it in<br/>
&gt;the primary melee slot.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
