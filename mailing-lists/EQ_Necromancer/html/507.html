<div id="ygrps-yiv-650397954">At level 6 I summoned a 5th level skel and gave it a rusty scythe. This <br/>
helped it a lot letting it do around 16 damage a hit to orcs in cb. I was <br/>
able to easily take a orc that conned yellow to me and had bash(around 8 then <br/>
Id think). Also skeletons are not based on thee level a warrior are based at <br/>
they are based on the level of a creature so they actually have better stats <br/>
than an equivalent level warrior(without armor of course). This was stated in <br/>
an info by I think it was a guide at eqvault.com on magician&#39;s pets and this <br/>
was mentioned. So really dont complain about low level pet summonings <br/>
beecause they are actually better than you think. <br/>
There is also a bunch of info on neecro spells and pets and everworld.com and <br/>
I would recomend checking it out. It gives all specifics on when weapons <br/>
become useless and when skels pick up skills like bash and dual wield.<br/>
