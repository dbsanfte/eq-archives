<div id="ygrps-yiv-1462544043">Actually, I think my pet is out to get me.  I dont know if its because of all the recent nerfs or what, but my pet is trying to kill me I tell you.  I was in lowerguk camping assasin, when all of a sudden my pet pulls a bunch of green mobs from downstairs.  Not only that, but he starts cackling like a maniac as 4 wan ghoul knights rush up to kill us.  As I try to do some crowd control with screaming terror, my pet stops attacking the one he&#39;s fighting and starts hitting the ST&#39;d one, thus breaking the mez.<br/>

    Ever feel like you&#39;re the pet and Gobantik is the real PC.  I mean you pull for Gobantik, you buff Gobantik, you heal Gobantik, you furnish Gobantik with weapons, you make it easy for Gobantik to kill the mob with things like DoT&#39;s and Fear and Root.  Gobantik doesn&#39;t have to waste time running all over Norrath, you carry him safely in your backpack until its time to kill something.  Think Gobantik ever cons you and thinks, &quot;Damn, I got a blue Necromancer this time!&quot;?  Yeah sure, Gobantik talks like a kiss up, but he knows who is really in charge!<br/>
