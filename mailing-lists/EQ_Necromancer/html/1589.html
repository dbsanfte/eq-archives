<div id="ygrps-yiv-2094760190">Does anyone know the level of the named bear, Mammoth, in the bear caves of<br/>
Surefall Glade?  I know this isn&#39;t really a Necro question, but I figure<br/>
Necro&#39;s have the best chance of knowing since we don&#39;t care about the<br/>
faction hits from killing those bears :&gt;  The faction hits you get from the<br/>
bears are almost the same that you get from the Treants.<br/>
