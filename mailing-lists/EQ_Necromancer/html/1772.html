<b>Subject:</b> Pets nerfed? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-556207379">I know that Abashi has posted that our pets were NOT nerfed in any way, but <br/>
&quot;accidents&quot; DO happen. So I was wondering if anyone has noticed our pets <br/>
being less efficient after that last patch we just had? I just wanna get some <br/>
personal experiences from you guys. I haven&#39;t had a chance to play lately so <br/>
I&#39;m not sure myself, will find out tonight.<br/>
