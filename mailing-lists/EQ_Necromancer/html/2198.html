<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1504519362">There was a post by Brad ages ago before the first of the pet nerfs <br/>
that you could give armor to your pet and it would help it out.  I <br/>
don&#39;t know if that&#39;s in fact true tho but I&#39;ve been giving armor to <br/>
my pets ever since.<br/>
