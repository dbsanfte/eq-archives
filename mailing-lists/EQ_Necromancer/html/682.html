<div id="ygrps-yiv-739659136">Well I think it would be nice to have more spots to put spell as well. Who<br/>
wouldnt.. I was thinking maybe have some special item even that would hold<br/>
more spells. Like a staff that can hold 3 spell stots. so its not just every<br/>
one get more. Thats just to vage in my book.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; i would really just like to be able to have spells ready in case of<br/>
&gt;&gt; emergencies, without hurting my ordinary ability to dish out damage.  for<br/>
&gt;&gt; example, i almost always have ward undead, even if there are only a few<br/>
&gt;&gt; undead around.  resting after a battle and getting attack by a zombie is<br/>
&gt;no<br/>
&gt;&gt; fun, even though they are rather weak opponents.  even a high level,<br/>
&gt;&gt; ordinary skeleton can do some damage if you dont have a pet and/or ward.<br/>
&gt;&gt; just for comparison, i got trained by 3 skels, without a pet, and i was<br/>
&gt;able<br/>
&gt;&gt; to kill them all.  by the time i finished i was severly low on hp, and<br/>
&gt;just<br/>
&gt;&gt; about out of mana (enough for gather shadows).  if i wouldnt have had<br/>
&gt;ward,<br/>
&gt;&gt; i would have been dark elf pot pie.<br/>
&gt;&gt; i also like to keep either gather shadows or gate on hand, but it would<br/>

&gt;&gt; choose a small handful.  im sure any spellcaster can agree with that, but<br/>
&gt;&gt; since we are already limited in our ability to take damage, i think the<br/>
&gt;&gt; versatility would help, even if it doesnt really make us all that much<br/>
