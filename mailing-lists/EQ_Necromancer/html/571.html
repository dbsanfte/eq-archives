<div id="ygrps-yiv-763248523">hail and well met!<br/>
<br/>
I started a a necromancer and am L2 now (darkelf).   Just got bound at<br/>
Greater Fay-Lesser Fay zone entrance.  I have some questions I was hoping<br/>
any of you could answer .. . any help would be very nice! :-)<br/>
<br/>
1) What can I do in Steamfont or Lesser Fay or Greater Fay that will improve<br/>
my faction w/ Gnomes,Dwarves and or HighElves . ..<br/>
<br/>
2) Will killing skeletons hurt my faction w/ necro guild??? Someone told me<br/>
it would.<br/>
<br/>
3) Can Necromancers were better than Cloth armor? I saw a post that said<br/>
someone had on wolf pelt armor . . .<br/>
<br/>
4) What % of the Experience is taken if I ever summon a Skkeleton to help<br/>
me. (I don&#39;t have the summon pet spell yet :-(   Is it an even share? or a<br/>
%?? and does it come from my split or everyones????<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks any help would be great! :-)<br/>
