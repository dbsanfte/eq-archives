<br/>
1) As I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve heard, treants in South Karanas give obscene amount of <br/>
cash plus fast exp. But it&#39;s always camped and bad faction hits with Queynos <br/>
Guards and druids/treants in general.<br/>
2) The Hermit (unkept druid) in SK also give good exp plus the occasional FS <br/>
weapon, that too is often camped. GOOD faction with druids, bad with Unkept <br/>
ones.<br/>
<br/>
Grouping:<br/>
<br/>
1) Stone skeleton tower in Lake Rathe. The tower is situated close to the <br/>
Rathe Mountain zone. You will need to swim to it and it&#39;s a double spawn of <br/>
a mage (level 25) in skeleton form and his pet. Get a ranger and/or a druid <br/>
to harmony.<br/>
2) Icy orcs at Everfrost. 5 spawns plus a nasty caster Orc named Redwind. <br/>
Again harmony works wonders and requires a full balanced group.<br/>
3) My favorite, Estate of Unrest. Group must consist of at least one cleric <br/>
and preferably one person who can SOW. Camp the Hand room for fast exp and <br/>
easy escape route, Magi or Bar room for fast spawns, or Tower for the BS <br/>
Tunic! One word of warning, keep your pet under a tight leash here as he can <br/>
pull massive trains back to you.<br/>
