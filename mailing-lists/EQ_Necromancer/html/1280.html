<b>Subject:</b> Guard Killing (Was Evil Characters) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1676219329">Best guards you can kill, for exp and loot, are Trolls or Dwarves.  If you are<br/>
an evil race- don&#39;t do the Troll Bashers, you&#39;ll loose the ability to go into<br/>
Grobb after one or two.  If you are a good character- by all means kill the<br/>
DWARVES.  You can kill the two guards by the docks in Butcherblock Mountains<br/>
without taking any faction hits.  Their weapons and coin loot off of one dwarven<br/>
guard is like 20pp.  I don&#39;t remember what level they are, but I&#39;m pretty sure<br/>
they are around 32 or so.<br/>
<br/>
Now, these guards don&#39;t do crap to save PCs.  They just keep stuff from<br/>
wandering into the dock area.  At level 8, my ranger ran past them with an aqua<br/>
goblin wizard casting on him (these make mince meat out of level 8s).  I ran all<br/>
the way to the docks before I died (which was well past the guards).  I have<br/>
never seen them attack MOBs if they engauged with a PC, so no moral dilema of<br/>
removing the &quot;protection of newbies&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps.  They are a great source of income especially if you want to<br/>
start something expensive- like jewelcrafting.<br/>
