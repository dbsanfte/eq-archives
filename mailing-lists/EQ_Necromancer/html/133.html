<div id="ygrps-yiv-1625229044">I read this at the Necromiter (sp?) site.  The following is a quote, you<br/>
all may find it interesting.  I totally agree that they need to add it. I&#39;m<br/>
sick of being KOS and or the unbalance in the game world. Evil cities are a<br/>
valuable part to a game like this!<br/>

I recently received this interesting note..<br/>
<br/>
I asked for the city of Plaineel, the once planned Necromancer city on<br/>
Odus... this is what i got as response from Brad:<br/>
<br/>
We were thinking about adding it in the future (not in the near future,<br/>
though). One of the great aspects of a game like this is our ability to keep<br/>
adding to it, including zones. (do keep in mind, though, that creating new<br/>
zones takes a lot of time and effort).<br/>

<br/>
Perhaps we should start a mailing action or some kind of list where every<br/>
Necro could enlist themselves so we show more interest to Verant for the<br/>
city!<br/>

  Since we&#39;re on a mailing list, perhaps we can get all of our Necromancer<br/>
charecter names, and mail Varant saying that we _REALLY_ want this city.<br/>
