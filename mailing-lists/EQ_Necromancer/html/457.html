<div id="ygrps-yiv-401699492">I &#39;ve been on many mailing lists for a while and all I hear is people <br/>
complaining about the other classes being better...<br/>
the mages complained about the necro the necro about the mages and so on.<br/>
If verant says the classes are balanced I trust em (except for the rogues wich still dont have poisoning)<br/>
Of course the neighbor&#39;s grass is always more green.<br/>
So if you dont like the class just check out another but please stop pissing me off with worthless &quot;he got this and that, Im jealous&quot;.<br/>
Necro is a hard class to play if you are not good with tactics , you might try a bard or something<br/>
