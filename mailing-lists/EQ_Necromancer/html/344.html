<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;     If you are referring to the post by Geoffry, then I believe he said<br/>
&gt;  mages get the best variety. Skeletons are second in hps only to the mages<br/>
&gt;  Earth elemental. What I don&#39;t think he mentioned is that while Skeletons<br/>
&gt;  may have few hps in this case, they _do_ have a much higher AC that earth<br/>
&gt;  elementals, thus making them more powerful over all.<br/>

The complaint I have heard from mages is that their pets are not as well <br/>
behaved  They tend to NOT attck when they should be attacking.  So even if <br/>
they have a better pet... it won&#39;t do what it should.<br/>
