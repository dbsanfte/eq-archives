Subject: [EQ_Necromancer] Level 4 and 8 spells<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Right now, I am a level 5 Necromancer. I have bought Cavorting Bones(I<br/>
 </span></blockquote>think that is the name of the level 4 pet spell), Clinging Darkness, and<br/>
Lifespike. Are tehre any other spells I should buy at this level. I am not<br/>
going to buy Gate until level 8, because I will not be travelling far until<br/>
level 8(when I get Gather Shadows). At level 8, what spells should I buy?<br/>
Right now, I am thinking Gather Shadows -&gt; Pet -&gt; Gate -&gt; Ward Undead. Are<br/>
there any other spells I should buy at this level? And should I change this<br/>
order?&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
As has been mentioned, Poison Bolt isn&#39;t too bad. It&#39;s a conjuration spell,<br/>
which is also nice. Do get that Gate spell soon (before level 8) - it&#39;ll<br/>
save your but a couple of times. Its usefulness isn&#39;t so much for travel, as<br/>
it is one of the few spells that can really take you out of trouble. You<br/>
can&#39;t outrun any enemies, but if you get attack by a superior enemy let your<br/>
pet attack him to give you some time. Cast Gate, Zone, and you&#39;re safe. Numb<br/>
the Dead can be useful - if you&#39;re at a spawning site for undead you can<br/>
cast this on one undead (like a zombie) and then attack the other, and not<br/>
have to worry about two attacking you. Grim Aura helps a bit, and as a rule<br/>
any enhancement spell is useful. Fear is difficult to use at lower levels,<br/>
simply because of its cost. But you can combine it with Poison BOlt and<br/>
Engulfing Darkness to have your enemy run around while taking damage over<br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
At level 8, if you can afford it get your Pet right away. If not, get Ward<br/>
Undead first. Those are perhaps the two most important spells there. Gather<br/>
shadows is nice for travelling, but you can get that later. A warning about<br/>
Ward Undead - when you level up put at least 1 of your skill points into the<br/>
Evocation spell. Ward Undead is the only Evocation spell you get until level<br/>
16. Because of this, while your other spell skills are 30-40 points,<br/>
Evocation is 0. This spell will fizzle out a lot until you can increase that<br/>
skill. But its worth it. At 8th with some practice, you can take out mummies<br/>
and zombies with this spell and your pet.<br/>
