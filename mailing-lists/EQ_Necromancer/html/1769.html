<div id="ygrps-yiv-134455112">Well, I have heard some Necros claim that Shadow Vortex seems to help a lot, <br/>
others say the opposite. I have only used it a few times and didn&#39;t notice a <br/>
huge difference. It may have been that the MOBs I was fighting had such a <br/>
high AC to begin with that missing a few didn&#39;t make much of a difference. I <br/>
forget exactly how many AC it sucks away anyhow. I didn&#39;t really go out of my <br/>
way to get the words, but I stumbled across them in my journeys so I went <br/>
ahead and researched the spell. I often times don&#39;t have a slot left for it, <br/>
but if you have an extra slot, go ahead and use it. Definitely buy the Fear <br/>
upgrade, Invoke Fear. You don&#39;t get it till 34, so you don&#39;t hafta worry for <br/>
a little while, but it has a faster casting time (2.5 I think, somewhere <br/>
thereabouts, while Fears is 4) and at this level, the lvl 4 fear spell is <br/>
resisted a lot more by creatures your level, whereas Invoke Fear is not.<br/>
