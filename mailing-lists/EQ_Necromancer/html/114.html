<div id="ygrps-yiv-1248057691">After wasting the 4.5 plat on it, I tried it out (dumping some training into <br/>
hand-to-hand) and found that, even hitting for points would not raise my <br/>
damaged health.  I wasn&#39;t looking at the bubble bar, but the actual numbers, <br/>
so I know it doesn&#39;t work.<br/>
<br/>
I had read two variations on what it is supposed to do:  Deliver a LifeTap <br/>
each time you hit, regardless of the damage, or deliver a LifeTap of exactly <br/>
the same amount you damaged for, effectively doubling all the damage you do <br/>
by hand, and then some since you get a little back.  At my 10th level, <br/>
though, the monsters I fight whack for 18 or so per hit, so it&#39;s not all that <br/>
effective a way, I think.  I&#39;m guessing, though, because it definitely <br/>
doesn&#39;t work right now.<br/>

&gt;  all it does is increase your attack rating by 15.<br/>
&gt;  IMHO - this spell would be great for a shadowknight but as <br/>
&gt;  a necro. dont waste your mana. </span></blockquote></div>
