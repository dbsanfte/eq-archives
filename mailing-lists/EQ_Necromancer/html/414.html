I have finally killed enough gnolls in paw and Black Burrow that guards in <br/>
Quenos, and most merchants are not KOS to me!!!  I only encountered one (VERY <br/>
HIGH LEVEL!!!  4 atacks for 101!!!) merchant that hated me... a Elf Merchant <br/>

least...  I can walk in invis, bank, reinvis and walk out safely!<br/>

of course I am 18th level.... so it takes a while.<br/>
