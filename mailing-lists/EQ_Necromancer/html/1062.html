<div id="ygrps-yiv-109685118">I am a human in Qeynos and I just hit level 8 tonight.  Before I go off and<br/>
waste money on spells that don&#39;t work, I was hoping to get some feedback<br/>
from people on the list as to the best spells at level 8 to purchase and<br/>
why.  Also perhaps if anyone could clue me in as to where in my area is a<br/>
good place to kill and how to apply the old and new spells to gaining xp and<br/>
loot I would greatly appreciate it.  Thank you ahead of time!<br/>
<br/>
P.S.<br/>
Don&#39;t die twice right when you make a level.  I had made 8 and lost it just<br/>
as quickly as I got it.  Didn&#39;t even have time to enjoy it before I was<br/>
struggling to get back to it :)<br/>
