<div id="ygrps-yiv-1381438922">You won&#39;t see it yet because you are still in the newbie area, but<br/>
there are areas where your pet will have trouble standing still.  In places<br/>
like most dungeons (Unrest, Befallen, Cazic-Thule, etc) and a few open areas<br/>
your pet will... uhm... wander.  Basically there&#39;s something where it<br/>
&quot;paces&quot; meaning it will move back and forth around you like a sick yoyo.  In<br/>
some places the pathfinding paths are so bad you can move five feet to your<br/>
left and your skeleton will make this LONG circle to get to you, often<br/>
bringing back &quot;presents&quot; in the form of bloodmad mobs.<br/>
<br/>
	Want an example?  Go to Befallen and summon a skeleton, the front is<br/>
relatively safe.   You should see almost instantly what I mean.  Want a<br/>
deadly example?  If you somehow manage to get to the third floor at the<br/>
bottom of the stairs you&#39;ll fight and elf skeleton and see a long corridor.<br/>
If you go down it and go into the left door you will find the deadliest of<br/>
all pathfinding areas.  You can step into the room, but if your pet is<br/>
playing catchup (and believe me it will be) when you decide to move left<br/>
near the broken up area, it will take a brutal turn to the right, go through<br/>
ANOTHER door, down a passageway, right by Gynok Moltar&#39;s room, UP another<br/>
passage, then come right back to you.  And thus the MONSTER TRAIN OF<br/>
DOOM(tm) was born.  When I was level 9 to 12 I would get pissed at 3rd floor<br/>
parties for dragging up trains that they couldn&#39;t handle.  Its only now that<br/>
I realize that often its not their problem, its the game&#39;s.  Many a time<br/>
I&#39;ve seen my skeleton pet take a hundred foot detour and manage to dredge up<br/>
a dozen nasty undead and spellcasters and I&#39;ve had to run to the exit,<br/>
believe me, Feigning Death is not an option on the 3rd floor. ;)<br/>
<br/>
	But off that tangent, its also useful if you want to scout ahead as<br/>
well or maybe you want your pet to guard an area and you drag monsters back<br/>
or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
	BE VERY CAREFUL IN ORDERing GUARD MODE.  It applies to ALL NPCs.<br/>
Meaning if you are near a city entrance and you tell your pet to guard it<br/>
will most likely decide you meant the guard and get itself slaughtered.<br/>
also remember that HERE is a relative term, meaning that if it attacks<br/>
something and the victim tries to runaway, it will follow it then make a NEW<br/>
guard spot wherever the victim died.  In my early days it was often I&#39;d<br/>
bring back a wee beastie only to find my pet had chased a moss snake across<br/>
the zone, then picked a fight with a young kodiak or elite guard.  After a<br/>
while if you see the &quot;TAUNTING ATTACKER MASTER&quot; message and you don&#39;t see a<br/>
skeleton it was often time to run to the zone.<br/>

&gt; Thanks Peter . . .      Does anyone know why I would want my <br/>
&gt; skel to sit<br/>
&gt; down? Does it give any advantage, like can I have him sit <br/>
&gt; down if  a guard<br/>
&gt; is coming and I go invis and then have him stand up after the <br/>
&gt; guard is gone?<br/>

&gt; &gt; The level one pet spell is fairly useless. Basically you&#39;re <br/>
&gt; summoning a<br/>
&gt; decaying skeleton, and you know how easily they die, right? <br/>
&gt; Push on to level<br/>
&gt; 4 and you&#39;ll find your new pet much more useful.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;So I have a problem,  every pet I have summoned has been <br/>
&gt; L1!  I made it<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;level 2 yesterday and I summoned 13 skeletons thus far and <br/>
&gt; every single<br/>
&gt; one<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;was L1 (coned black while I was 1 and blue while I was 2)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;I read several places that at low lvls we should be able <br/>
&gt; to summon a pet<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;that could be above our lvl, I&#39;d be happy w/ a Skel that <br/>
&gt; WAS my lvl.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Does it matter what type of bone chips are used to summon????<br/>
