<b>Subject:</b> Runnyeye - good for level 21 solo? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1679553011">Have been looking for a good place to hunt tonight, and was wondering about<br/>
Runnyeye. What can be found there, and is it good for a solo 21st level?<br/>
Also, are there places for a DE Nec to sell around that area? I&#39;m getting<br/>
kinda sick of the weekend crowds at the Aviak Village...<br/>
