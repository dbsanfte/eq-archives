<div id="ygrps-yiv-439855834">Well, you should not give your pet say a rusty halberd, or some other slow <br/>
weapon after this as yes it will only slow him down.But I would DEFINITELY <br/>
advise you to give your pet a dagger of some kind (FS are best if you are <br/>
high enough lvl to be giving them to a pet).Why?Because, daggers will make <br/>
your pet attack quite a bit faster than with his bare fist and it does not <br/>
lower his damage.So it&#39;s hitting for the same amount of damage, but a good <br/>
deal quicker.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I thought that at 16th level and above you should not give your pet a <br/>
weapon<br/>
 because he did more damage barehanded.  Am I wrong about this? &gt;&gt;</div>
