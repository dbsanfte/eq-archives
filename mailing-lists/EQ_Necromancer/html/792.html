<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-335734167">Greetings to all,<br/>
<br/>
I am Gaeorn of the 4th circle on Bristlebane, and have a couple of<br/>
things,<br/>
<br/>
1. I am thinking of starting a guild for all that are interested, but<br/>
mostly necromancers. Our purpose is to help each other prosper and grow<br/>
in power. The name I am considering is BLACK WIND. If you are<br/>
interested, send me a email, ortry giving me a /tell after 11PM EST.<br/>
<br/>
2. If there is allready a guild on Bristlebane that will accept a human<br/>
necro, please send me a email as to what needs to be done to join.<br/>
<br/>
3. Where is a good place for a soloing Necro at 16th lvl to hunt for<br/>
exp and profit? I some times group withthe bard Juke and the SK<br/>
Darkmoon, so if we three are together, where is a good palce that I<br/>
will not get KOS?<br/>
<br/>
Any help is apprectiated.<br/>
<br/>
Geaorn, freelance suicidal cleric,tank, Necromancer<br/>
