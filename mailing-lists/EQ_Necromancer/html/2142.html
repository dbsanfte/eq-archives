<div id="ygrps-yiv-957628676">Heh well you don&#39;t have to sit in the corner if you don&#39;t mind dying. Hate<br/>
used to be a ton more fun when they had pets and it was actually dangerous,<br/>
it&#39;s way easier now. It&#39;s kind of like fear broken when it gets farmed.<br/>
<br/>
Try a few fear breaks just make sure your groups know what their doing or<br/>
you&#39;ll lose a good level or 2. Fear breaks are extremly fun though. Some of<br/>
my most fun fights are on our second wave in and fighting 3 mobs then 3 more<br/>
3 more and then another 3 without a break naked! That&#39;s some of the most fun<br/>
I&#39;ve ever had. 12 man fear breaks are also cool but tough.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Not sure what you mean highpass. You don&#39;t try and get exp in plane raids<br/>
&gt;&gt;  just kill the mob without losing people.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I guess after all the time to get to Planes level I just expected more<br/>
&gt;&quot;eewww&quot;  - &quot;ahhhhhh&quot; - &quot;wow this is too cool&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;One guy on the Druids Grove posted basically &quot;its not for fun, its not for<br/>
&gt;exps, its for farming - remember that and you are good to go&quot;. I can accept<br/>
&gt;that if that is what it is, I guess I just expected more. There is not a<br/>
&gt;single item I can think of that in the Planes for me that would make this<br/>
&gt;enjoyable. Yes, my best items are there, but I would rather not have the<br/>

&gt;We basically spent 2 hours to get organized and ported, 1 more hour inside<br/>
&gt;before first pull. Pulled to a corner for a few hours and supplied members<br/>
&gt;with a few nice items. It was just anticlimatic. I feel kind of cheated. Is<br/>
&gt;this pull to a corner it? I just don&#39;t find that fun. I felt like a bunch<br/>

&gt;I guess the best analogy I can make is its like getting a notice saying YOU<br/>
&gt;MADE IT - YOU WON A MIILLION FOR MAKING IT THIS FAR! Then cashing in the<br/>
&gt;voucher and finding out it was pesos not dollars.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am not trying to complain I just felt like it was a huge let down and<br/>
&gt;expected to be able to come to work today and tell my bard friend and<br/>
&gt;coworker &quot;oh my god we need to get you to 46, it was a blast&quot;. I cant do<br/>
