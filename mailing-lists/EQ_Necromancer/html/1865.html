&gt; Do Not go to Glide mode. That is for 3dfx chips only. as for mipmaping i<br/>
&gt; think (and feel free to correct me) that has something to do with texture<br/>
&gt; bluring, but not sure.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Mipmapping basically takes textures that are further off and blurs them.<br/>
When you draw a texture full resolution at long range they tend to &quot;swim&quot;<br/>
and it also gives a better feeling of distance imo.  If you&#39;re looking at a<br/>
tree hundreds of yards away, you shouldn&#39;t be able to see the individual<br/>
leaves anymore.</div>
