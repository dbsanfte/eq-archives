<div id="ygrps-yiv-1769356759">OK somebody mentioned something about killing asps at level 9. That&#39;s fine<br/>
but you can do so much more than that, if you use your spells and pet<br/>
rightly. At level 9 you should be going after yellow cons with your pet and<br/>
casting clinging darkness then going in melee till half life, backing out<br/>
and casting your lifetap spell until full life then go back in and melee<br/>
some more and just keep doing this. Once you hit level 10 though you can go<br/>
kill dervs and I would suggest you do that, though take only equal or less<br/>
cons. Once you hit 12 though you can handle anything but thugs, by casting<br/>
englufing darkness and heat blood and then just letting your pet attack and<br/>
at the end of the fight get in one lifedrain. At 13 you can take thugs out<br/>
if your careful though by 14 you should be taking all dervs, at least in<br/>
North Ro the only derv camp I&#39;ve hunted at. Anyway just some advice for you,<br/>
that I found out the hard way.</div>
