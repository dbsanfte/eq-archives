&gt;     I&#39;ve a question about Shadow Step.  I know it&#39;s a mini random teleport,<br/>
&gt; but.. I have some misgivings about it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I watched another mage, while invisible, casting their Shadow Step<br/>
&gt; outside.  It was sad, they hardly went a few feet away from their original<br/>
&gt; spot, and if they were being attacked, they could still get hit by<br/>
&gt; whatever it was from where they went.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Though I guess, in a dungeon, it would be more helpful, or is that just<br/>
&gt; wishful thinking?  Also, how long does it take to cast?  Faster than Gate<br/>
&gt; does, or the same?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;     Thanks for the info folks.<br/>

 </span></blockquote> Shadow step is very usefull it has saved me countless times AFTER I learned<br/>
HOW it works.  Shadow step teleports you a random distance but will ALWAYS<br/>
take you to lower ground . If your at the top of a hill it will take you to<br/>
the bottom but never the other way around.<br/>
In a dongeon its best used while standing on a bridge or cliff it will take<br/>
you below the bridge or to the bottom of the clif. outside i like to use it by<br/>
rivers and lakes the spell usualy takes me to the bottom of the river and it<br/>
takes the monsters a while to reach me through the water<br/>
Try the spell in these areas it will make you verry happy .<br/>
