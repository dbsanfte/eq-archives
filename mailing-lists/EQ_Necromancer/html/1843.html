<div id="ygrps-yiv-144290868">Have you tried just giving the items to the NPC instead of hailing them and<br/>
going through the dialogue?<br/>
<br/>
The reason I ask this is as follows.  I have a 22 Erudite Wiz who began the<br/>
Stein of Moggok quest (an enchanter friend was going to finish the quest for<br/>
him).  There comes a time in that quest when you need to travel to Rivervale<br/>
to get a bottle of Honeyjum.  My wizard was dubious to the npc giving out<br/>
the honeyjum. Whenever he hailed the npc, the npc REFUSED to talk to him.<br/>
However,  he could give the npc the 3 honeycombs and 30 gold pieces and get<br/>
the honeyjum!  Even though he couldn&#39;t initiate the quest through dialogue<br/>
(due to very bad faction) he could STILL complete the quest just by turning<br/>
in the items.<br/>
<br/>
I realize you may have already tried this, so just take this message as an<br/>
&quot;in case you haven&#39;t already...&quot; type of deal.<br/>

&gt; To all telling me to do the Red Wine quest, I have tried (and tried, and<br/>
&gt; tried, and tried) but you CAN&#39;T do it unless you are indifferent<br/>
&gt; or better.<br/>
&gt; I am one notch down from indifferent at apprehensive, and at apprehensive<br/>
&gt; (or dubious I assume) you cannot do the red wine quest OR the<br/>
&gt; Lightstone/Research quest with the DE merchant in S. Ro.  So if anyone has<br/>
&gt; any other quest that is possible to do at apprehensive that gives good<br/>
&gt; factions towards the Dark Bargainers, I would be extremely<br/>
&gt; grateful.  Thanks<br/>
&gt; again!<br/>
