 </span></blockquote>    What I use the Dark Pact spell for is meditating.  I first cast it, then<br/>
hit the spell book and begin meditating and memorizing spells.  The mana<br/>
goes back up and I find that I can cast other spells such as Dark Eye and<br/>
Gather Shadows and the wait isn&#39;t quite as bad, thus leaving time for the<br/>
spells to be active during play.<br/>
<br/>
    There was a time I was attacked by an Undead while resting and still had<br/>
my Dark Pact active.  It seemed to me I got off an extra Ward Undead because<br/>
of it (an extra 39pts of dam isn&#39;t a bad thing at all), spacing the castings<br/>
a bit further than usual of course.  But then again, if my pet would&#39;ve<br/>
fallen and I had to go had-to-hand, I&#39;d have been in a worse situation due<br/>
to less HP.  I think I was almost half-way down..bubble and a half.<br/>
Something like that.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I am interested in this or other fighting styles?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    I just do what every other Necromancer does.  Pet tank, Poisen (or other<br/>
DoT spell), pop off a few other spells maybe (LifeSpike or whatever), take a<br/>
few hits & deal my own, etc.  That, or I send the pet in, poisen the<br/>
creature, then target my pet and watch its HP&#39;s.  If they get down to almost<br/>
half, I use Mend Bones to heal it (considering that by the time it actually<br/>
casts, it usually _is_ down half its HP&#39;s), and the rest of the time I&#39;m<br/>
meditating.  The only pain to this is the wondering animals and such.  The<br/>
ones that usually leave you alone see you as an easy target when you&#39;re<br/>
sitting, and may attack you or your pet.  Mend bones doesn&#39;t cast fast<br/>
enough to keep up with two, three things pounding on your pet at once for<br/>
12+pts of dam.<br/>
