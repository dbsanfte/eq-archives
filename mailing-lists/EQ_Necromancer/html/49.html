something up you can start training in it.<br/>

Two handed blunt is the best as the great staff is very nice.<br/>
<br/>
There is an item in the game, I think a necro dagger, that has a higher base <br/>
damage and better speed than a base worn staff, and a higher damage over time <br/>
than any staff I have seen.  It also does random poison &quot;crits&quot; which of <br/>
course help.  <br/>
<br/>
I think it is found in Nejena though... so it is not something to get at low <br/>
levels...<br/>
<br/>
Just my two cents.</div>
