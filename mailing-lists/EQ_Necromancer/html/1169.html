<div id="ygrps-yiv-859162706">I pulled this off a druid list I think everybody should sign it.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I am going to send an email to the eqdruids.com webmaster and ask him to start a<br/>
petition to STOP the anti-kiting patch.  PLEASE, everyone who is a druid player go<br/>
to the website and sign the petition.  Verant has many more much more important<br/>
things to fix than this.  I will post here when the petition is up at eqdruids.com.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to one and all.<br/>
