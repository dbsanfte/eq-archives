<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1596753420">Does anyone know of a comprehensive list of Necromancer spells, what they are<br/>
and what they do? (And where to get them in Neriak if they&#39;ve been keeping<br/>
track.) I&#39;m a new player to EQ and only been on a week or so, finally made it<br/>
to level 4 and am not sure what the listed spells do other than Leering<br/>
Corpse. It would help make my purchase decisions with my limited funds.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!</div>
