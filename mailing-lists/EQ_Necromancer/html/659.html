&gt;Subject: Lake Rathetea<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have a question for you all. Where the hell Aviaks In Lake Rathe.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>All over, there are some on the center island near the tower, there are<br/>
also a few camps of them along the sides of the zone and near some of the<br/>
other islands.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;Also I have saved up 37 skill points for resurch. I was told by someone that<br/>
&gt;when they got to level 16 they could only train once in that skill. Ok dont<br/>
&gt;make me cry. Let me down softly. Is it true?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes at 16th I was only able to put 1 pont in Research Skill.  At 17th I was<br/>
unable to put any additional points in the skill.  I did however research 2<br/>
spells, but didn&#39;t gain any skill in the process.  At 18th I was still<br/>
unable to add and points to my skill, however, I was told that at 19th and<br/>
at 20th I can start adding points into the skill again.  You can also gain<br/>
points by actually performing research.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;One last question. I need to find out if this is rumor or true. S O W<br/>
&gt;rings(spirit of the wolf) do they realy exsist. Or is this just another<br/>
&gt;rumor to make us lower levels drool. If any one knows anything on this I<br/>
&gt;would like info. Being a necro with out doge to level 22, when a pet dies<br/>
&gt;god you got be able to run. I hate it when your pet dies for a stupied<br/>
&gt;resason and a blue uper hand kills you. Grrrr!!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I haven&#39;t seen a ring, but the Travelers Boots, found off one of the high<br/>
level mobs in Najena will do one SOW per zone.  I know they don&#39;t come from<br/>
Najena herself, but I herd that they were from her Necromancer Sister.<br/>
