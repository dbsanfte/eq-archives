<div id="ygrps-yiv-1067181912">I am 95% positive, if you can turn in lightstones with the Dark Elf merchant<br/>
in S Ro ( the evil version of the research quest ) you will receive positive<br/>
faction with DreadGuardInner, DreadGuardOuter, and DarkBargainers.  That&#39;s a<br/>
fairly easy way to raise it without hurting other faction, the only question<br/>
being, do you have enough faction to allow you to turn in the lightstones. .<br/>
.<br/>
Good luck.<br/>

&gt; Ok its not specifically a Necro topic but since probably more Dark elves<br/>
&gt; hang around this email list than any other I figured I would ask here.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am currently trying to raise my Dark Barginers Faction.  Thats basically<br/>
&gt; Neriak Merchant faction.  Its an easy thing to do if your a Dark elf, as<br/>
&gt; you can do some of the quests.  Unfortunately I am a gnome (it has its<br/>
&gt; advantages (non kos in North Freeport)).  However I don&#39;t currently have<br/>
&gt; enough Dark Barginers faction to do quests with them.  I can still buy<br/>
bank<br/>
&gt; and sell in Neriak but I am trying to get some better pricing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Does anyone know of any Mobs that will provide a positive bonus to Dark<br/>
&gt; Barginers faction?<br/>
