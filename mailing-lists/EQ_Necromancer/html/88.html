<div id="ygrps-yiv-907617908">I have found a cool little thing about being a necro. You can be an awsome<br/>
begger. When you are sitting there waiting for your mana to go up. Befor<br/>
hand target your pet. Then sit there and meditate while begging the hell out<br/>
of your pet. I am at the dreaded level 7 and Im a level 18 begger. Just<br/>
never beg a guard. If you ever suceed they kill you!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Oh ya if you didnt figure this out you can do the same with sence heading.<br/>
<br/>
If you ever want to look me up My char name in Manick, under the Innurkk<br/>
surver. I know I spelled that wrong but you get the point.<br/>

&gt;&gt; That&#39;s *exactly* the reason I started Kagon, and haven&#39;t played my<br/>
&gt;&gt; ranger since (except once, I feel kinda ..guilty and stuff..). I read<br/>
&gt;&gt; your post and was mildly concerned since I was nearing 7 myself. Well,<br/>
&gt;&gt; when I hit 7 last night...there was barely anything to fight! Ok, I<br/>
&gt;&gt; may be overexagerating, but kodiak&#39;s were still yellow (I got<br/>
&gt;&gt; slaughtered by one, thinking I was smart, but I was just<br/>
&gt;&gt; ill-prepared), and now almost all black bears and shadow wolves are<br/>
&gt;&gt; green. The only whites I saw the rest of the night was a tree snake<br/>
&gt;&gt; and a skel near the ruins, which are camped like mad anyway. I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;&gt; thinking of taking a trip over to the Freeport area, maybe more stuff<br/>
&gt;&gt; over there? Personally, I think Kagon would enjoy flaying a halfling<br/>
&gt;&gt; or two, but the 2 locations he has been to so far are not suitable<br/>
&gt;&gt; yet. =P *shudders at the memory of being burned to death by 3 halfling<br/>
&gt;&gt; spellcasters and bludgeoned by 4 skels at the same time*<br/>
&gt;&gt; Good luck!<br/>

&gt;&gt; Thanks to all for the responses.   I&#39;m looking forward to playing and<br/>
&gt;&gt; getting to 8 and above.   It&#39;s funny, I started this Necromancer just<br/>
&gt;&gt; on a whim when I got a little bored with my Ranger and I haven&#39;t<br/>
&gt;&gt; played<br/>
&gt;&gt; my Ranger since.   My friends in Kelethin are not pleased...<br/>
