<div id="ygrps-yiv-1225908955">-&gt;what is the 3 dot combo?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Dot is damage over time. Necros are masters at that style of fighting. We do<br/>
more damage then wizards. It just takes us longer. So you hit your target<br/>
with heat blood. Slowly it takes off 120 hp a little at a time, but right<br/>
after you hit it with heat blood you heart flutter it and it starts to take<br/>
off 220 hp of damage. Then lets piss off the monster and engulf darkness it.<br/>
and it dose a dot of 88 as the others are still doing damage. now you have<br/>
your target slowly ticking off 428 hp in about just over a minute. at level<br/>
22 thats about 2 bubbles of mana. Im level 26 now and though 3 spells are<br/>
about less then a bubble and a half. where as a wizard has to spend allot<br/>
more mana to do the same damage in one blast. Now when the dots are wearing<br/>
off. Start all over again, and do another 428 damage. at level 29 there is a<br/>
new dot that dose over 400 damage alone. So thats why dots are so much fun.<br/>
Every necor has there style in what order they like. you will find yours.<br/>
try out what works best for you.<br/>
