<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-387602669">The nek spawn is not that bad, usually 2 shadowmen out front and 2 on the<br/>
back to the left.∩┐╜ They can usually be pulled separately, the front pull and<br/>
the side pull, but sometimes you&#39;ll get one from the other pull.∩┐╜ 2 necros<br/>
can usually take the pull from 29th level on up, although the shadowmen have<br/>
taken me from 31 to 30 about 10 times.∩┐╜ The hardest ones are the damn<br/>
clerics, rarely there will be a spawn of 4 shadowmen on the left side of the<br/>
spawn and once this weekend it spawned 4 clerics, well 3 of us nec&#39;s tried<br/>
it with all of our pets and we all died and only killed 1 cleric, now that<br/>
was embarassing.<br/>
∩┐╜<br/>
Finally i&#39;m all dressed in black, got my mask of shadow that i had hunted<br/>
for which probably took about 15hrs of playing time in nek forrest.∩┐╜ The<br/>
gloves are nice as well, and the boots will go as soon as i get my jboots :<br/>

LOL D@MN I wish I had got this post last night, I went and found the<br/>
Shadowmen in Soth Karana in the SW corner and my L28 Shaman an L29 Mage and<br/>
L36 warrior fought the 4 shadowmen and their pets, and they coned blue and<br/>
green to all of us and it was a TPK!!! (total party kill)∩┐╜ we got<br/>
slaughtered!! never even killed one of them!<br/>
∩┐╜<br/>

Where in the Forest are the Shadowmen?∩┐╜ what lvl are they?∩┐╜ Can an L28 and a<br/>
L25 take the 4 together?<br/>
Can we pull one at a time?∩┐╜∩┐╜ Thanks<br/>
<br/>
When you zone in from EC, head northwest, the /loc I *think* is<br/>
around -1600,500 or thereabouts.∩┐╜ They&#39;re down in a bit of a valley by a<br/>
monolith structure.∩┐╜ I highly doubt that a L28 and L25 could clear that<br/>
spawn...I was soloing it for a while, basically target the highest /con send<br/>
my pet and dot the heck out of him...wait for him to die then gate,<br/>
hopefully before the other 3 finish the pet and come after me.∩┐╜ I was<br/>
successful twice, died once, called for help :)∩┐╜ With a L35 nec, L35 warrior<br/>
and L35 rogue, we cleared the spawn and all had about 2 bubbles of health<br/>
remaining.∩┐╜ These guys are *tough* and way undercon&#39;d∩┐╜ Best to get a full<br/>
group, with at least one primary healer, preferably 2, shaman buffs are nice<br/>
too. :)<br/>
