<div id="ygrps-yiv-895307879">Ok I have had this question for awhile.  I suppose some of you high level<br/>
necros can probably help here.<br/>
<br/>
When I was in the low levels everyone told me it was always best to give my<br/>
pet a rusty weapon to help it do more damage when it attacked.<br/>
I was told that once I got the 12th level pets that giving them weapons was<br/>
bad because they hit for more damage and more often without a weapon.<br/>
Lately I have been seeing many high level necros giving their pets a fine<br/>
steel dagger.<br/>
So here are the questions.<br/>
1) do you only give the pet a FS dagger if you KNOW the stuff it will be<br/>
attacking can always be hit by non magic weapons?<br/>
2)  Can you give the pet more than one dagger since it can double attack<br/>
and duel weild at higher levels?<br/>
3)  At what level does giving a pet a FS dagger become more benificial than<br/>
letting it use its fists?<br/>
4)  If pets do get the double attack and duel weild what level pet can I<br/>
give more than one weapon two?<br/>
5)  I understand that the FS dagger is used because of its low delay.  Is<br/>
any other weapon a good alternate choice if a FS dagger is not available?<br/>
6) At Very High levels where money is really not much of a factor, would it<br/>
be even better to buy up inexpensive magic weapons (inexensive for a level<br/>
44+) like the tenticle wips for your pet?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance<br/>
