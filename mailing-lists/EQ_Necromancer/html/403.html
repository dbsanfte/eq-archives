<div id="ygrps-yiv-950970521">Ok this spell is a hit and miss kind of theing... They up graded it so that you can use weapons with it. About 50% of the time you will get a % of the damage you do in hp. So it dones work all the time, so I still find this spell unrelable at lower levels. Now when you get to higher levels its more worth the time useing it. But at level 8... forget about it... keep with grim aura!!!<br/>

    <br/>
    it says this spell is a touch deliver spell so do I have to UNARMED attack?<br/>
    or can I melee w/ dagger and just cast it???   <br/>
    <br/>
    If I need to unarmed attack to deliver this spell should I start fighting unarmed to get that skill up???   Can ANYONE tell me how this spell works, and why a Necromancer needs a HIGH DEX . . . <br/>
    <br/>
    does the high Dex help to hit in hand to hand combat???<br/>
    <br/>
    thanks. . .<br/>
