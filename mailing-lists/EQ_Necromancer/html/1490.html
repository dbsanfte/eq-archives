<div id="ygrps-yiv-2117477294">Where were you hunting the shadowmen at?  I hunted in nek and I would get<br/>
about 3 to 4 scythes a night, and everything else was hard to find, but I<br/>
did find it all and I must say I look like a bad ass dressed in all black<br/>
running around with a scythe in 1 hand and dirk in the other :)<br/>

This weekend, I finally finished the necro quests in the temple, by getting<br/>
the Harvester...this item was by far the hardest of the 4 available.  Upon<br/>
turning in a shadowed scythe to Vurgo, he hands you a note and asks for a<br/>
shadowed knife from the goblin headmaster in OOT, this was relatively<br/>
simple, the headmaster spawns on the far side of oracle island.  His spot is<br/>
on the left of a hut that spawns 2 goblins, once I found him he seemed to be<br/>
a pretty common spawn.  The next item I needed was a mortuary fungus eye<br/>
from unrest.  This was a pain in the ass...I got to unrest at about 2am CST<br/>
and there were a total of 6 people there and I was the highest level by 15<br/>
(39)  Needless to say...I was the only one going anywhere near the basement<br/>
:(  my suggestion unless you&#39;re level 50 is to go during peak hours when the<br/>
house is totally camped and bring a couple friends anyway.  The fungus spawn<br/>
pretty much near the end of the basement, near the ghost, in a couple pit<br/>
traps in the floor.  The eye is a rare drop, and it took me a good 3 hrs to<br/>
get one...maybe I was just unlucky.  As far as shadowed men go, once you hit<br/>
level 36 or so, you can generally pull singles from the camp, and once you<br/>
hit 39, your pet can solo them ;) (one at a time of course) unless it&#39;s a<br/>
cleric...then he might need a little nuke push at the end.<br/>
<br/>
This list is basically unmoderated.  However abusive language will not be<br/>
tolerated</div>
