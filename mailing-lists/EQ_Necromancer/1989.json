I am recently<br/>\ngraduated from Necro High School and have begun to<br/>\nventure out into the real world.  Almost all advice<br/>\nand things I ought to know would be helpfull. Have<br/>\nnever even gone over the bridge yet, and I party<br/>\nalmost exsclusively with my buddy who also is a Necro<br/>\nof same level. As of yet we have kill Shintar twice,<br/>\neheheheh that was fun :-), whooped a lot of skells in<br/>\nPaineel and gotten the free one handed bash from the<br/>\nrunnaway pet, killed the tratior that wants to fish.<br/>\nOnly did that once though, tough fight at level 5 for<br/>\nthe 2 of us.  My buddy beat me to the loot, and then<br/>\ngot the 2 handed bash with the plus 1 int, which is<br/>\nNOT magic. I intend to kill him soon for the free<br/>\nfishing pole :-).  Killed a lot of Kobolds and turned<br/>\nin the cloth hats to the 2 mining skells in the tunnel<br/>\nto Paineel, and sold the paws for a plat for 4.  But<br/>\nthe horizon is calling out my name. O where to go,<br/>\nwhat to do.  What say ye to be that of best advantage<br/>\nto a Necro such as myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuizekil the Not Quite Sure How His Name is Spelled<br/>\nNecro of the 5th rank of Drizzel Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTalk to your friends online with Yahoo!
