If something comes<br/>\nalong that will waste the party, we start running and my pet holds it off<br/>\nso we can get a head start.  This tactic can be used when fighting solo too<br/>\nand frees up a spell slot for one of those other spells that are more critical.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only time I keep Ward Undead in memory is if I am in an area that I<br/>\nknow will have undead, and I don&#39;t mean just decaying skeletons.  Currently<br/>\nI fight in South Ro alot.  If I am killing orcs I don&#39;t bother with Ward<br/>\nUndead, There just aren&#39;t enough undead in that area.  If I move to the<br/>\nsand part yes it becomes a great spell to have.<br/>\n<br/>\nI trade off and on between Siphon str (in a group) and Impart Str when<br/>\nsoloing.  Though I will probably end up needing to drop this to fit in the<br/>\nHeat Blood line.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I am in a group I am usually not in melee that much.  Hence I don&#39;t<br/>\nbother to keep my Grim Aura going.  I do leave my lesser Shielding in<br/>\nplace.  Its just a pain to let it wear off.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t bother wish shadow step.  It may have its uses in PvP or if you<br/>\nwant to get to the bottom of a high wall and not take any damage, but mobs<br/>\ntarget too well for this to really be that effective.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess we can always hope that when they release the expansion in about 6+<br/>\nmonths that they will redo the interface and make those spell icons a bit<br/>\nsmaller so we can fit more in the same space.<br/>\n<br/>\nLomack<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Message: 10<br/>\n&gt;   Date: Tue, 1 Jun 1999 17:55:45 -0500 <br/>\n&gt;   From: &quot;Murphy, Kenneth E.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MurphyK@...\">MurphyK@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Curious on 8 memorized spells for lev 16 through 23 rd level play <br/>\n&gt;ers ?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hail fellow necromancers<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I am lev 14th and already finding it hard to pick exactly which 8 spells to<br/>\n&gt;keep memorized. I currently don&#39;t keep shielding and grim aura memorized,<br/>\n&gt;rather I cast and delete them, then repeat later when they wear off.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;When I&#39;m in a large group that is killing fast, I tend to use the low mana<br/>\n&gt;spells like siphon str and disease so I can do this to all MOBS. I like to<br/>\n&gt;keep gate memorized for emergencies, my best life suck spell, my ward<br/>\n&gt;undead, and my best darkness spell as it slows the MOBs down if they are<br/>\n&gt;fleeing or if I need to flee. I also find dark empathy handy to emergency<br/>\n&gt;heal passerby&#39;s that are dying. I make a lot of friends that way. I also<br/>\n&gt;find mend bones quite handy esp when I&#39;m soloing or in a group of 2 where<br/>\n&gt;the other person is a wizard or other spell type. I also like the vampiric<br/>\n&gt;embrace as I can tank at the beginning of a fight longer, back out and life<br/>\n&gt;drain, then tank again. That extra 25 tap 2 or 3 times some fights has made<br/>\n&gt;a big difference a few times.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So I have at lev 14 something like this memorized.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;1)Best Life Drain<br/>\n&gt;2)Vampiric Embrace<br/>\n&gt;3)Englufing Darkness<br/>\n&gt;4)Heat Blood (or if in lavastorm or big group Disease)<br/>\n&gt;5)Dark Empathy<br/>\n&gt;6)Mend Bones (or if in group with tanks siphon str or posion bolt)<br/>\n&gt;7)Gate<br/>\n&gt;8)Ward Undead<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I wish I had slots for fear and shadow step but I don&#39;t usually.<br/>\n&gt;At lev 16 I see a lot of new neat spells. A new DOT. Feign Death. A spell to<br/>\n&gt;make you immune to damage for a short time ect. I am at a loss as to how to<br/>\n&gt;fit all the fun spells in. I&#39;m happy in the sence there are so many cool<br/>\n&gt;spells I can sorta mix and match for the situation but its much more<br/>\n&gt;difficult living with 8 spells at a time then when I play my lev 17<br/>\n&gt;magician. I can mem and forget all my summon spells. My combat ones are<br/>\n&gt;always less then 8. IE DD, AE, Gate, Damage Shield and I&#39;m about done with<br/>\n&gt;important spells.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I was wanting advice from higher lev necromancers about what spells they<br/>\n&gt;tend to load and for what situations. Esp for the lev 16 and the 20th<br/>\n&gt;spells.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sincerely,<br/>\n&gt;Eloric Rank 4 Necomancer<br/>\n&gt;Veneficus Rank 5 Magician<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Humble Knight - MoltenLava - Mithannial Marr <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;...
