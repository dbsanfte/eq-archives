At","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1769356759\">OK somebody mentioned something about killing asps at level 9. That&#39;s fine<br/>\nbut you can do so much more than that, if you use your spells and pet<br/>\nrightly. At level 9 you should be going after yellow cons with your pet and<br/>\ncasting clinging darkness then going in melee till half life, backing out<br/>\nand casting your lifetap spell until full life then go back in and melee<br/>\nsome more and just keep doing this. Once you hit level 10 though you can go<br/>\nkill dervs and I would suggest you do that, though take only equal or less<br/>\ncons. Once you hit 12 though you can handle anything but thugs, by casting<br/>\nenglufing darkness and heat blood and then just letting your pet attack and<br/>\nat the end of the fight get in one lifedrain. At 13 you can take thugs out<br/>\nif your careful though by 14 you should be taking all dervs, at least in<br/>\nNorth Ro the only derv camp I&#39;ve hunted at. Anyway just some advice for you,<br/>\nthat I found out the hard way.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
