Paineel is supposed to be <br/>\ninside of a crater, so it may be quite large- perhaps they want to keep it <br/>\nas something for the higher end graphics cards.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Shadow Panther&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shdwpanther@...\">shdwpanther@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     Necromancer City.  If you read the story of Norrath, that&#39;s supposed <br/>\n&gt;to<br/>\n&gt;be before the time of the players, there&#39;s a City of Necromancers called<br/>\n&gt;Paineel.  It&#39;s supposed to be on South Odus, wasn&#39;t it?  If I remember<br/>\n&gt;right, but don&#39;t quote me on that.  However, it appears they&#39;ve not added <br/>\n&gt;it<br/>\n&gt;and I wasn&#39;t aware that they had already said they were going <br/>\n&gt;to...according<br/>\n&gt;to another person on this list?  So, why not?  Since they&#39;re making this <br/>\n&gt;new<br/>\n&gt;land-mass, what better time to design, create, and add the city?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;~Mysk<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt;From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Alien11721@...\">Alien11721@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sent: Sunday, May 16, 1999 9:47 AM<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [EQ_Necromancer] The new continent<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Alien11721@...\">Alien11721@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; what&#39;s paineel?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
