While in the Castle in CB<br/>\nit<br/>\n&gt; ran away and I lost 2 pets that way.  Would not respond to commands even<br/>\n&gt; tho alive.  I found a L16 spell not familiar with; Spirit Armor?  And<br/>\n&gt; lastly, with Heat Blood, Engulf Darkness, and Heart Flutter, if all<br/>\nstacked<br/>\n&gt; about how much damage done?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks for any help!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; PS<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As I go up it appears its better strategy to make max use of pet and not<br/>\ndo<br/>\n&gt; much melee;  if so, how best to heal pet, and do I med, if possible, while<br/>\n&gt; he fites (keeping a chk on health), then heal him up?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  your connection to people who share your interests.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; This list is basically unmoderated.
