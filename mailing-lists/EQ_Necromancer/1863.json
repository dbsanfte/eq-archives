I am running scsi drives (u2w 7200rpm) and<br/>\ni see no improvement in zoneing over my ide friends so....  Here are my<br/>\nthoughts: cpu and connect speed make a difference, but also how many hops<br/>\nyou have to get to there servers also does.  Also I think (but not verified)<br/>\nthe ammont of ppl in the zone affects zone time.  I think alot of the long<br/>\nzone times are on there end, and not ours, but who the hell knows, they wont<br/>\ntell us shit about anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nJames<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Christopher King &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cking@...\">cking@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, February 24, 2000 12:52 PM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [EQ_Necromancer] pet question<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Christopher King &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cking@...\">cking@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; to add to the confusion:<br/>\n&gt; my pc is a PII 450mhz, 128MB ram, EIDE hard drive, STB Riva TNT 16mb card.<br/>\n&gt; I have always had slow zoning compared to most people. usually 5 secs or<br/>\n&gt; more slower.<br/>\n&gt; Until last week i had a 56k dial up.<br/>\n&gt; Last week i got 1megabit ADSL.<br/>\n&gt; I have seen NO (ZERO) zoning time improvement.
