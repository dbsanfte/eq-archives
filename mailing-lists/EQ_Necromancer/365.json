When is it effective and when is it<br/>\nnot?  I cast it on some skeletons that were attacking others in Befallen,<br/>\nand it said that it appeared...well, I forget the word that it uses, but it<br/>\nwas successful.  However the creature continued to smack the player around.<br/>\n<br/>\n    So.. does it slow the attacks, or just not work while it&#39;s fighting and<br/>\njust needs to be cast on the creature while it&#39;s still just standing or<br/>\nwandering around?  Or would it have been something else that immediatly<br/>\nticked it off again?  The player, in one instance, was just running and not<br/>\nswinging back.  I didn&#39;t have enough for a Ward nor wanted to chance ticking<br/>\nit off and being smacked around myself.  Thanks folks.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Mysk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
