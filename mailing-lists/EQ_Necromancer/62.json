I&#39;m struggling to get to 8, my pet doesn&#39;t seem to help<br/>\nmuch and my Mana regeneration is very slow, even with meditate.  I know<br/>\nthings get better at 8 but will every level like this (11,15,19 etc.)<br/>\nbe this difficult?  Or is just me?  My ranger character advanced easily<br/>\nuntil he hit the teens so this has been frustrating.   Is grouping the<br/>\nonly solution to problems like these?  Not my first choice....<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nSaga-Mith.Marr<br/>\n_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
