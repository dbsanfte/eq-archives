Also, screaming<br/>\nterror was fixed to not work properly outdoors...which Qeynos Hills<br/>\ndefinitely is.  Yet another bug :) mobs can use it outside but we can&#39;t?<br/>\nC&#39;mon!  The combination of xp/corpse loss on both the enchanter by the lake<br/>\nand Undying Varsoon, I&#39;m 90% sure that this bug is caused by pets becoming<br/>\nmobs for all intents and purposes.  Whatever it is, I really hope they fix<br/>\nit soon, because I&#39;m not leaving Qeynos Hills until I have that stone.<br/>\nThough killing guards, poachers, rangers and druids is great xp, I&#39;d like to<br/>\nmove on to something with a bit better loot than bronze weapons ;)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
