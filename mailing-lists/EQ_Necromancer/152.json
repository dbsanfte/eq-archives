Is it High Erudian? Anyone know of any monsters that give words and <br/>\nso forth??<br/>\n<br/>\nThe books are all different languages.  Each one a different one.  So ... you <br/>\nwill need to learn them all.  There seem to be Old Erudian, Ancient Elvish, <br/>\nElder Tir&#39;Dal.  There is also Lizardman and Gnoll.  I have 4 books, and it <br/>\nlooks like each is a different language.  I believe that my first one is <br/>\nAncient Eleven ... only because I am average in this skill, and I can almost <br/>\nmake it out.  (I am A Dark Elf Necro)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I have found words/runes on Orc, Fungi Men, Frogloks, and Goblins.  They <br/>\ntend to be on the &quot;intelligent&quot; critters.
