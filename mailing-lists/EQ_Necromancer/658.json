Where the hell Aviaks In Lake Rathe.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Also I have saved up 37 skill points for resurch. I was told by someone <br/>\n&gt;that<br/>\n&gt;when they got to level 16 they could only train once in that skill. Ok dont<br/>\n&gt;make me cry. Let me down softly. Is it true?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;One last question. I need to find out if this is rumor or true. S O W<br/>\n&gt;rings(spirit of the wolf) do they realy exsist. Or is this just another<br/>\n&gt;rumor to make us lower levels drool. If any one knows anything on this I<br/>\n&gt;would like info. Being a necro with out doge to level 22, when a pet dies<br/>\n&gt;god you got be able to run. I hate it when your pet dies for a stupied<br/>\n&gt;resason and a blue uper hand kills you.
