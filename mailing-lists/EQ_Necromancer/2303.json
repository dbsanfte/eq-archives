Windows can be transparent, you can move them and <br/>\nconfigure them easily, you can have multiple chat windows and <br/>\nconfigure them to each serve specific purposes. Pets no longer take <br/>\nexperience, even if they do the kill alone. You can quickly and <br/>\neasily get around if you have Planes of Power, as there are Plane of <br/>\nKnowledge teleport books in every semi-civilized zone. There are <br/>\nsoulbinders, so no hunting for someone to bind you in a new zone. <br/>\nRaids can now share experience cross-groups. Actually, the number of <br/>\nchanges is so huge that I can&#39;t even begin to think of everything. <br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and I think the hot spell of the day is only a year old or <br/>\nso...it&#39;s called Kodiak&#39;s Endless Intellect, or KEI, and it gives <br/>\nyou sixteen mana per tick plus like 30 INT and WIS. A lower-level <br/>\ncharacter cannot run out of mana, a mid level character never faces <br/>\ndowntime at all if he&#39;s careful, even soloing, and an uber character <br/>\nhas his downtime cut to a fraction, or none if in an effective group.<br/>\n<br/>\nI dunno if KEI was around more than a year ago, but nowadays there <br/>\nis /always/ someone casting it for donations in Nexus, so it&#39;s at <br/>\nleast gone from nearly unknown to something anyone can get with a <br/>\nlittle effort...and it lasts over two hours.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s more, with the all-download expansion (Legacy of Ykesha) <br/>\ncoming out in a few weeks, you can be a Frogluk, you have SIXTEEN <br/>\nslots in the bank, there is an automatic (and a manual) mapping <br/>\nsystem, you can dye armor SLOTS so that any armor put in it will be <br/>\nthe color you like to wear. There is a new item slot called Charms, <br/>\nand a charm is a special kind of magic item which changes according <br/>\nto circumstances, like growing more powerful for each of a certain <br/>\nkind of armor you wear (like gaining HP for each piece of plate you <br/>\nequip), or other things like growing more powerful the more PP you <br/>\nare carrying.<br/>\n<br/>\nLee&#39;s see...you were around for Luclin, which probably is what drove <br/>\nyou away, but they fixed every single bug from back then. Zoning is <br/>\nfaster, and messages are never lost during zone, they queue up and <br/>\nyou see them after you get through. <br/>\n<br/>\nThey&#39;ve put out two stable, very useful expansions in just four <br/>\nmonths, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn effect, once Verant ceased to exist and it became officially <br/>\nSony, it seems they got ten times the development quality and funds, <br/>\nand it&#39;s gone from an annoying game to being as good as anything out <br/>\nthere.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut for the coming expansion, the Frogluks have taken over my <br/>\noriginal home town of Grobb, now known as Gukta, and the Trolls have <br/>\nbeen relegated to hanging out in the foreign quarter of Neriak until <br/>\nthe new Troll city is built with the new expansion. That one thing <br/>\nreally annoys me.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
