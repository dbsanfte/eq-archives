So it you try to life tap a sand giant it<br/>\nwill be resisted but if you life tap something say only 5 levels above you<br/>\nit will not be resisted.  I have lifespiked many red and yellows that others<br/>\nwere fight and never got resisted except if it was a deep red and I was<br/>\nresisted everytime.  basically it will prevent exp twinking that nercos had<br/>\nand could really exploit.  It does not effect much else except the deal that<br/>\nall other caster types have with there resist caps only our is unresistable<br/>\nto the cap.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ntshadow@...\">ntshadow@...</a><br/>\nICQ UIN #3969083</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
