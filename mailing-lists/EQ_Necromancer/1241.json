Now that I have adopted the root and dot, dot, dot,<br/>\n&gt;and sometimes dot technique, I realize that I could have easily done it <br/>\n&gt;that<br/>\n&gt;way before. Now the patch helps even more by giving me extra damage when <br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;mob is rooted. I would have to say that the mob gets to me a lot easier <br/>\n&gt;with<br/>\n&gt;this technique, but manageable with good tactics.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My one BIG rant is what they have done to the Darkness line of spells<br/>\n&gt;because of the patch. The whole spell line is rendered useless for damage<br/>\n&gt;now because root wipes it out. They really need to figure out a way to make<br/>\n&gt;darkness stick even when a root is cast on the mob.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ok, one more rant to finish it off, what they have done to ignite bones is<br/>\n&gt;ridiculous. It is a horrible DD to begin with, now they remove the <br/>\n&gt;root-like<br/>\n&gt;effect and make it even worse, AARGH!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Dresa D&#39;Ashire<br/>\n&gt;41st Necromancer<br/>\n&gt;Rallos Zek<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     GRAB THE GATOR!
