That includes the <br/>\nFelwithe (actually, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever been to the wood elves with my gnome necro, but <br/>\nI&#39;m sure they are KOS too...) and the dwarves. Across the water, things are a bit better. You <br/>\nare fine wandering around Freeport, Qeynos and Neriak. Oggok and Grobb are off limits. <br/>\nThe guards in both places will mop the floor with you on sight. Rivervale is also not an option. <br/>\nYou are also KOS in Highpass Hold, BTW. Gather Shadows isn&#39;t  must before travelling to <br/>\nFreeport, but you must sneak around the guards at the docks by going around the wall and <br/>\nswimming into the dock area. There used to be a dwarf guard swimming around in there, but <br/>\nhaven&#39;t seen him lately.

Will likely hit L8 this week and be<br/>\n&gt; ready (with Gather Shadows) to travel a bit if I don&#39;t choose to wander<br/>\n&gt; sooner, and perhaps hook up with some Troll friends.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So - What cities am I likely to be tolerated well enough to be able to get<br/>\n&gt; to the bank and vendors?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I know Ak&#39;Anon is fine.  Nobody outside the Mines of Malfunction likes me,<br/>\n&gt; but neither do they hate me.  I&#39;ve been told that it&#39;s instant death to<br/>\n&gt; get anywhere near the dwarf guards in Butcherblock, so Kaladim is out.  I<br/>\n&gt; presume Kelethin and Felwithe are likewise verboten - can anyone confirm?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Antonica, I know I can get out of the docks in the tunnel that has the<br/>\n&gt; Necro guild, and presumably sell there as well.  Can I get to the bank in<br/>\n&gt; N Freeport?  Innothule is likely my first destination - can I go into<br/>\n&gt; Grobb or Oggok to get bound or is E Freeport the closest place?  Will the<br/>\n&gt; DE vendors in S Ro or any of the vendors in Innothule, Feerott, or Rathe<br/>\n&gt; Mountains talk to me?  How about the rest of the continent?  Can I walk<br/>\n&gt; into Neriak?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Your thoughts, please.
