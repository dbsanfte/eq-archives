Sure,  you can cast  your spells at them, but it has no<br/>\neffect at all.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis I can understand. In Nek Forrest there are piranhas in a river that<br/>\nruns under a bridge (first hand experience here) that&#39;ll wipe out any of the<br/>\nnewbies in the area should they fall in. If you could kill those piranhas<br/>\nwithout going into the water, every newbie would be taking mages and<br/>\nleveling up to 12 in 2 days. While I can see your point about realism, I<br/>\nthink that this is better as it prevents cheap and easy experience.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Something else is their apparent psychic connection with the planet.  I<br/>\n </span></blockquote>mean, seriously, you&#39;re completely across the zone from the thing and it<br/>\nwill still know where you&#39;re at, even if you&#39;re far under ground and it&#39;s<br/>\ntop side _and_ all the way on the other side of the zone make its way to you<br/>\nthrough maze or &#39;high water&#39; and begin pounding the snot out of you&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf there&#39;s one thing that does need to be fixed, it is this. You can&#39;t run<br/>\naway from anyone unless you&#39;ve cast some spell that slows your enemy down.<br/>\nOn top of that, they don&#39;t stop unless you zone or they&#39;re killed by<br/>\nsomebody. It&#39;d be nice if the game had a LOS variable for monsters that<br/>\nfigured whether or not they knew where you were at any given point.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
