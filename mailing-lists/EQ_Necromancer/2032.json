Being <br/>\nthat your guild is down there, it might be a good idea to get to know the <br/>\nsewers anyway.  And yes you can kill enough gnolls to where eventually u <br/>\nwill no longer be KOS in qeynos.  It does take a LOT of gnolls, and you can <br/>\nkill in blackburrow till about 15th level.  Once you hit 15th, you will find <br/>\nit very hard to get xp there.  From there you should move into the Karana&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nDefilia, Karana<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Neal Kanodia&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nkanodia@...\">nkanodia@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: [EQ_Necromancer] necro resources<br/>\n&gt;Date: Fri, 31 Mar 2000 13:55:34 -0600<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m new to the &#39;evil&#39; side of EQ, and was wondering what good necro<br/>\n&gt;resources are available; quest info, getting around the continent, etc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Also, as an erudite necro, I&#39;m wondering where to hunt after I reach level<br/>\n&gt;8; can I, for example, kill enough gnolls to make it possible to shop in<br/>\n&gt;Qeynos?  are there vendors that&#39;ll sell to me in the sewers?  thanks!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
