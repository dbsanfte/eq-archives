Yes it was leering corpse I was using. I&#39;m level 15 on the<br/>\nkarana server.  I tried rememming the spell and I even cast the previous<br/>\npet spell.  So my question is have necros&#39; been screwed again, is it a<br/>\nbug on all servers, a bug on Karana, or is my Char bugged?  Any help<br/>\nwould be appreciated before I close the account and tell Verant where to<br/>\nstick it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSlortar,<br/>\nKarana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
