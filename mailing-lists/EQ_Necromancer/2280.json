We also kick <br/>\narse with our DOTs and to a lesser extent our DDs (SOP is awesome, <br/>\nand the DD vs Undead line is cool too). And I consider the pet as <br/>\nhalf a Tank. Yet when I go into a zone LFG, there&#39;s loads of other <br/>\npeople LFG too, yet they all seem to get groups and I don&#39;t. Once I <br/>\nwaited 5 hours in OT for a group and didn&#39;t get one. I know Necros <br/>\nare apparantly so good at soloing but it does get boring and even we <br/>\nhave to med for some time if we use all our mana. And we go down <br/>\nquick if we&#39;re being hit and FD doesn&#39;t work or we&#39;re oom.<br/>\nAh, just pouring out what I think here. What does everyone else think?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
