Since asps poison strongly, I send in pet after I cast a<br/>\ndarkness spell. I then try to get off a disease spell. Then I just alternate<br/>\nmend bones and dark empathy. With this I was able to defeat lev 9 and 8 asps<br/>\nat lev 9. With this method I am also able to defeat almost any lev 10 non<br/>\npoisoning MOB in ecommons. I have killed lev 10 Y-Kodiacs, orc centurians<br/>\nand lions. Or you can just use mend bones and when the pet is near death,<br/>\nyou can step in and tank for your pet.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I like most about my necromancer is that there seems to be more then<br/>\none way to get the job done. My wizard and magician both seemed to only have<br/>\n1 basic approach that either succeeded or failed. I&#39;m likeing the<br/>\nnecromancer&#39;s larger variety of spells, though you can&#39;t use them all in<br/>\nevery situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nEloric (3rd Rank) Necromancer<br/>\nMithanial Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
