Guk hm, and woven?  You&#39;re right, that is<br/>\ngoing to take some traveling shoes... but come to think of it, I don&#39;t have<br/>\nany shoes. :-) hehe  Yes I really need an equipment upgrade.  I go through<br/>\nFreeport down through the Desert, no?<br/>\n<br/>\nAhh..not solo.. hm, problem there is the binding.  I know one person who<br/>\nwould go with me, is there a place around there I could bind somebody so<br/>\nthey don&#39;t have to run all the way back from Freeport?  How I wish there<br/>\nwasn&#39;t the silly starting city only limitation.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the advice, I&#39;ll put it on the future sight seeing list. *grin*<br/>\n<br/>\n~Shadow<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Amy Pratt &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sfpratt@...\">sfpratt@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, August 19, 1999 6:44 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ_Necromancer] JBoots (the ever popular)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Amy Pratt&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sfpratt@...\">sfpratt@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Grab your little piles of bones and put your travelling shoes on and head<br/>\n&gt; for Guk.
