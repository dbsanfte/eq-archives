I know it may not be popular but I would<br/>\nrather be a Red Robed necromancer than a Black Robed one.  This was one of<br/>\nmy major factors in deciding on the gnome race.  (Other than I love to<br/>\ntinker and such.) One of my life goals is to someday be able to stroll into<br/>\nall of the &quot;good&quot; cities right past the guards with my head held high. To<br/>\nthis end I already have the Dwarves and Hal flings down to Dubious. I have<br/>\nyet to start in any major way on the Queynos folks, or the Euridites.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a separate subject...I am fast approaching level 20. My question is not<br/>\nwhich spells to buy, I normally buy them all anyway, but which spells do<br/>\nfolks normally keep memorized when they go into battle? This seems like the<br/>\nhardest balancing act in the game. With only eight slots and an even sixty<br/>\nspells to choose from, it&#39;s enough to make my little brain literally pop<br/>\nfrom indecision. &lt;smile&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAny help would be appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nSigned,<br/>\nOserus (gnome necro on Veshaan)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:goblin@...\">goblin@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n   Date: Tue, 22 Jun 1999 09:05:39 -0500 (CDT)<br/>\n   From: Ort-Man &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ortman@...\">ortman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: changing KoS<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYou realize that Trolls, Ogres, and DarkElves shouldn&#39;t ever kill<br/>\nCrushbone Orcs.
