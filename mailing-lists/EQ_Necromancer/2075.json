I had a DE necro up to 5, but then i noticed everyone is a DE,<br/>\nso I quit him. I&#39;m thinking of making a erudite now, but then the iksar had<br/>\nto come along. Anyone tried an iksar as a necro? How are they? Well, if I<br/>\ndont go with an iksar and make a erudite I would probably take my 30 points<br/>\nand bring 70 agi up to 80 agi and 117 int up to 137 int. Is this smart? I<br/>\nplan to twink him, so he will probably have 190+ int from the start unless i<br/>\nopt for mana jewelry. Also, if I made him a erudite where would i be liked<br/>\nand disliked? Thanks very much for your time, and any other tips would be<br/>\nappreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Kendan Boozehound<br/>\n 48th druid of E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
