Well, I&#39;m<br/>\nin a little bit of a bind.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just started out and died when I finally reached my Guild house. <br/>\nUnfortunately I couldn&#39;t get my corpse and have lost my note I was<br/>\nsupposed to hand to the necromancer there.  I hear from my friends<br/>\nthat I should get a robe or something, but I don&#39;t have the note.  Is<br/>\nthere any way to get a new note or something?  None of the stores<br/>\nnearby will sell me anything because I&#39;m a necromancer, so I&#39;d like to<br/>\nget this one.    Also is there anything else I am missing out on by<br/>\nnot completing this quest?  I mean,  I&#39;m sure I can eventually find a<br/>\nrobe somewhere,  I just don&#39;t want to miss out on a bunch of stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanx<br/>\n===<br/>\n     ,,<br/>\nShaithis<br/>\n  ,,</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
