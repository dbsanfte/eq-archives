It is a rare spawn, but not as bad as the BBC or Gossimer Robe I<br/>\n&gt; think.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As for Pending Lore, I do not know.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s been a lore item all along. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nas far as being rare, my monk friend got 6 of them in the time he was<br/>\nlooking for barbed leggings for a cleric.  definitely not as rare as the<br/>\nrobe/bbc.<br/>\n<br/>\none of the cool things about it is, you can put it in your ranged weapon<br/>\nslot, and still carry your glowing crook/runed totem or what have you.<br/>\nSince the dagger is only 3 dmg it&#39;s mostly sought after for the magical<br/>\nadditions to your stats. (+5 int and some mana I believe, I&#39;ll have to check<br/>\nnext time I&#39;m in game) by carrying it in the ranged slot, you still get<br/>\nthose benefits, without having to downgrade your melee damage severely.  Of<br/>\ncourse if you aren&#39;t using a magical weapon already, by all means put it in<br/>\nthe primary melee slot. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
