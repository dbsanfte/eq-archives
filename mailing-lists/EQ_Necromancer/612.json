Perhaps the most<br/>\naccurate<br/>\n&gt; way to find out how much damage spell x does is to try it on the PVP<br/>\n&gt; server...that way you can have a friend that you cast on relay exact<br/>\nnumbers<br/>\n&gt; back.  Of course this requires an active PVP necro, do we have any of<br/>\nthose<br/>\n&gt; on the list?  Also, I believe the damage is not static, it depends on the<br/>\n&gt; level of the mob/player you cast on and their resistance levels to said<br/>\n&gt; magic.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: Murphy, Kenneth E. &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MurphyK@...\">MurphyK@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, May 27, 1999 11:15 AM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [EQ_Necromancer] Is there any demand for this type of site?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Murphy, Kenneth E.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MurphyK@...\">MurphyK@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hello All<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I am currently running both a magician and a necromancer. I personally<br/>\nam<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the type of person that would rather know where to go and how-to do<br/>\nthings<br/>\n&gt; &gt; rather then taking months to figure it all out myself. This is mostly<br/>\n&gt; &gt; because I&#39;m busy in my RL with work, marriage etc, etc ... Thus, for me,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; just keeping up in levels near my friends is hard enough, much less<br/>\n&gt; running<br/>\n&gt; &gt; around everywhere trying to find everything myself.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; There are a few things I find lacking in the main stream web sites info.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; A. The spell lists are out dated and don&#39;t provide the info I want. IE<br/>\n&gt; they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t say this spell does this damage for this manna, here is the ratio.<br/>\n&gt; It<br/>\n&gt; &gt; takes this many secs to cast with the channeling skill maxed for the<br/>\nlevel<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you first receive the spell. The necro DOT does X damage a tick for X<br/>\n&gt; ticks.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I would find that kind of extra statistics helpful.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; B. Where do you buy the darn spell? No site I have found is attempting<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; &gt; keep a list of vendor locations and their inventory and pricing for some<br/>\n&gt; &gt; base charisma.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; C. The above info should be integrated to include if each spell is<br/>\n&gt; research<br/>\n&gt; &gt; only or not. The status of research for that spell. IE broken or not.<br/>\nAnd<br/>\n&gt; if<br/>\n&gt; &gt; not broken what are the components to make the spell, what book and what<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lang etc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; What was YOUR favorite part?!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Tell other Star Wars fans at ONElist!<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; This list is basically unmoderated.
