This meant not seeing your actual HPs, AC, ATK, etc etc.<br/>\nHowever, in beta these numbers were all present for testing purposes and<br/>\nwhen Verant made some comments about going to a non-numerical based system<br/>\npeople whined and moaned so they left things as they were. Thus, we see<br/>\nsome numbers and not others making things totally inconsistent.<br/>\nPersonally, I think they should take all numbers out, but I don&#39;t think<br/>\nthings are going to change. Too many people on either side would bitch and<br/>\nmoan at any little change. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;         Maybe it&#39;s just the mood I&#39;m in, but do they strike you as pricks?<br/>\n&gt; I mean, honestly.. they give us, in the spell&#39;s info, how much mana it takes<br/>\n&gt; to cast it, but they&#39;re out-right refusing to give us numbers showing how<br/>\n&gt; much mana we have?  They&#39;re just being pricks about it, or at least, that&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; how it seems to me.  What basis would they have for not?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>    See above.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;         Not to mention all of the other limitations, and the &quot;you&#39;re in our<br/>\n&gt; world now&quot; that I thought was just a cool slogan, but now seems to be more<br/>\n&gt; of another way to say, &quot;this is our world, we&#39;re in control, we think for<br/>\n&gt; you, we decide how you play, where you go, what you see, and if you don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; like it _leave_ because it&#39;s _MINE_&quot; .

Verant has done an amazing job with balance...<br/>\nlook how hard Blizzard had to work to balance 3 races. Verant had a TON<br/>\nmore to deal with, and has done a very commendable job. Is it perfect? No,<br/>\nprobably not. But they are fixing things as they go along. Just give<br/>\nreasonable /feedbacks without incessant whining and they&#39;ll be more<br/>\ninclined to listen. Just remember, they are _not_ going to &#39;upgrade&#39; any<br/>\nclass/race in _any_ way unless it is a proven imbalance.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Valdus</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
