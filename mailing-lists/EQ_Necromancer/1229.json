Feel kinda stupid casting it all <br/>\n&gt;&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  time for the last few weeks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;then they took away charm and gave us a worthless spell (screaming terror),<br/>\n&gt;not only is it a &#39;why go to the train when you can bring the train to you&#39;<br/>\n&gt;spell, but it only works indoors!  at least if it worked outdoors, when the<br/>\n&gt;wipe failed it wouldnt really be as dangerous.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;and what were they thinking when they made voice graft?  i dont think any<br/>\n&gt;class has a more useless spell.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;oh well, thats my rant =)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Also had a general question about experience and which is better to do.  <br/>\n&gt;&gt;Is<br/>\n&gt;&gt;it better to solo a yellow spawn every other time it comes up (lets say<br/>\n&gt;&gt;alternating with an equal level friend) or group with your friend and kill<br/>\n&gt;&gt;each one and split the exp?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;you are better off getting 50% of two kills than 100% of one, there is less<br/>\n&gt;work involved, and more safety.  also, you get some form of grouping bonus.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;belphenor<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Show your ONElist SPIRIT!<br/>\n&gt;&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/tshirt2\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/tshirt2</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt;With a new ONElist SHIRT available through our website.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;This list is basically unmoderated.
