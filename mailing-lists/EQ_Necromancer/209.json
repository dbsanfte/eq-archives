It does work with weapons.  It is worth it I believe the <br/>\nmana cost for the possible damage is OK.  And the duration increases as your <br/>\nlevel increases (or at least its duration is long enough make it worth its <br/>\nmana.  I tend to get two &quot;flares&quot; off of each casting, making it worth as <br/>\nmuch as the higher level Tap spell.  I have gotten three, and once even four <br/>\noff during its duration, making it worth MORE than the higher level Tap.<br/>\n<br/>\nSonoroud</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
