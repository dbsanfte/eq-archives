Probably never.  I have personally lead the slaughter of<br/>\n&gt;the Deathfist Orcs and cleaned out all Commonlands camps MULTIPLE times,<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;d even go far as to say I&#39;ve killed over a thousand orcs in an attempt to<br/>\n&gt;get goody goody with Freeport.  Hasn&#39;t happened yet.  I would just suck up<br/>\n&gt;and deal with it.  I know I have.  As a Gnome Necromancer you can still get<br/>\n&gt;into places Dark Elves can&#39;t, but I don&#39;t see the factions as too much of a<br/>\n&gt;difference because Dark elf Necromancers are treated fairly by all three<br/>\n&gt;evil cities which is a large area to be liked in, wherea Gnome Necros are<br/>\n&gt;sort of disliked everywhere but not totally hated.
