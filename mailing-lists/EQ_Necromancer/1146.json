As for level you need to be with<br/>\nrelatively 3 level 28+ casters to attempt the jboots. It&#39;s also a good idea<br/>\nto summon pets as Drelzna&#39;s Harm Touch can do some serious damage. Also you<br/>\ncan still get the Oracle robe off the oracle by killing him. I also am<br/>\npretty sure the quest is not working right now, I think anyway. Not to<br/>\nmention that you need to be high level to attempt the quest like at lreast<br/>\n35+ or have some help.<br/>\n<br/>\n Actually us casters don&#39;t get a equivilent in armor. I&#39;m currently level 35<br/>\nand I just now got my FBR. Getting hit for damage just gets worse as you<br/>\nlevel. At my level the dungeon I go to if a mob goes aggro on me I&#39;m<br/>\nbasically dead unless somebody immediatly casts a Area Effect spell.<br/>\nOtherwise I&#39;m dead in 10 seconds or so.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Shadow Panther &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shdwpanther@...\">shdwpanther@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Thursday, August 19, 1999 6:10 PM<br/>\nSubject: [EQ_Necromancer] JBoots (the ever popular)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Shadow Panther&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shdwpanther@...\">shdwpanther@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Greets,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  I am curious if they&#39;ve changed how you get Journyman Boots such as they<br/>\n&gt;changed the Oracle Robe to a quest (speaking of which, does he attack DE<br/>\n&gt;Necros?)?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    Also, if so how do I get started?<br/>\n&gt;    And if not, what dungeon is she in & where&#39;s it located?

It&#39;s been awhile since<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;ve heard much about them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    On a seperate subject.  I&#39;m 14th level and still wearing the Sr.<br/>\n&gt;Apprentice robe.  The rest of my armour, which isn&#39;t much at that, are only<br/>\n&gt;cloth items.  Greens can hit for 15, 20pts of damage, it&#39;s pretty sad.  I<br/>\n&gt;know casters don&#39;t get much, but I know we get better than this.  Could you<br/>\n&gt;give robe & armour idea, where one may find them, level VS item (such as<br/>\n&gt;25th being typical for full Bronze), etc?  I&#39;m half naked, and I&#39;m supposed<br/>\n&gt;to be a scary Necromancer. LoL  Nothing all too impressive about this. :-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    Thanks for the help.  I don&#39;t focus on leveling much, obviously, but<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;d<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;enjoy some new stuff.  Finally, at 13th level, I got my Runed Totem Staff<br/>\n&gt;(for a higher price than I could&#39;ve I later learned, but oh well).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    Thanks folks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    Currently, I&#39;m in the Qeynos area, but semi-soon heading back towards<br/>\n&gt;Neriak.
