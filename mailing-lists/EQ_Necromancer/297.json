And there is talk that they are to be replaced..  It seems to me that a useful replacement would be a low level spell that gauges accurately the ability level of a summoned pet..<br/>\n            I mean we are supposedly the masters of our own trade, and yet we don&#39;t even know most times upon summoning a new pet what level it is..  This makes no sense.. I understand the point for randomness, but not for ignorance..<br/>\n            A simple spell that popped up a text message that gave at least the critters numerical level.. Would be great.. Better (but less likely) would be a quick gage of base abilities like given when looking at an item.. Personally I think HP, Atk, and AC along with level and maybe special abilities would be perfect, as it would put to rest all the debate over whether or not the different types of elementals are really different..<br/>\n            I&#39;d love to see this go into effect.. As a programmer I think this would be one of the less difficult suggestions to implement (it&#39;s just reading info already in the system and reporting it through text.. No major mods needed).. I&#39;m thinking a petition is in order.. But have no clue how to get one started...<br/>\n        <br/>\n            Any ideas/comments?<br/>\n        <br/>\n        Raij - 6th level Magician of Neriak<br/>\n        Ahiru - 5th level Necromancer of Neriak </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
