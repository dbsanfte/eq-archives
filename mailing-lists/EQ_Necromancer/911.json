I made it to<br/>\nzone w/ 30 HP LEFT! and thanks GOD for Shieldskin.  hehe   anyway  I want to<br/>\ncome back someday and SLAY HER!  She pissed me off killed me once when I was<br/>\n8th and the most recent time I was about to zone and someone had pulled her<br/>\nto the GF zone!  DOH!<br/>\nSHE MUST DIE!!?!?  Anyone know what lvl she is?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n(I pretty much hosed<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; my Qeynos faction the other day when I decided I wanted revenge on Holly<br/>\n&gt; Windstalker more than I wanted good Qeynos faction...but that&#39;s another<br/>\n&gt; story) ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -Grizumpy Bloodmaw </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
