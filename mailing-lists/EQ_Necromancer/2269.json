Basically, giving","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1168785296\">I would also like to point out that starting at lvl 39 pets will <br/>\nautomatically dual weild so you don&#39;t have to give them weapons for <br/>\nthis.  Basically, giving your pets weapons after 39 is wasting cash <br/>\nand weight.  However, there are certain circumstances where a weapon <br/>\nis very beneficial.  Procing weapons can add a bit to the damage your <br/>\npet produces.  My favorite is the vellium weapons dropped by giants, <br/>\ndwarves and such in velious.  Since delay doesn&#39;t matter and after <br/>\nabout lvl 16 dmg is irrelevant you equip your pet for effect on the <br/>\nproc.  If you are hunting in nejena or the hole get a couple of <br/>\nswords from your friendly mage as the ward summoned proc is a nice <br/>\nlittle bit of additional damage (about 41pts).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing is, at least for necro&#39;s, your pet is very effective <br/>\nwithout a weapon. So why waste the time, energy and cash on getting <br/>\nit weapons?<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom levels 1 through 12 it&#39;s a good thing to get the biggest meanest <br/>\n2 hander you can loot.  This can dramatically increase your pets <br/>\ndamage output.  At 16 you really need the high end 2handers like fine <br/>\nsteel to even get a marginal improvement in damage.  <br/>\n<br/>\n/pet attack &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMaldain Demorte <br/>\nLevel 55 Necromancer<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In EQ_Necromancer@y..., Mark Rafn &lt;dagon@d...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; On Tue, 14 Nov 2000, Howler wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I understand that weapons do not effect dly or dmg...but do they <br/>\nactivate<br/>\n&gt; &gt; dual wield or dbl attack?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Weapons DO affect damage if the weapon is higher than base damage.  <br/>\nThis<br/>\n&gt; is only possible at low levels (8 and lower normally, up to L12 for <br/>\nrusty<br/>\n&gt; 2H swords, I believe FS 2H helps L16 pets a small amount).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Magic weapons allow pets below L10 (i.e. spell levels 4 and 8) to <br/>\nhit<br/>\n&gt; magic-only critters.
