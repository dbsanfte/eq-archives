Also you can fight Large Plague Rats there and Drakes if you feel daring.   Pumas are there too, and not many people.  plus the ZONE to lesser fay is right there so you can run to the ZONE if IT hits the FAN . .. <br/>\n<br/>\nI went from 8th lvl to 12th lvl here in about a week . . .   now that I am 12th I am in unrest and I killed Death beetles last night for about 2 hours and am 1/2 way to 13th now.  :-)   <br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing to look out for in Steamfont is LARGE PLAGUE RATS and SKELETONS are friends and will TAG TEAM YOU, so only attack one if the other is not close by.   The Large Plague Rats are a little tougher than the Pumas, so I would start out with Pumas and Skeletons if you have WARD UNDEAD . . .   ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nGood Luck<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-Skel the Gnome<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.  the loot isn&#39;t the greatest, but I usually had my Pet kill Rogue Cleaners and Kolbolds while I meditated and he soloed them EZ.   Then I would get up get my $$$ and go take on something tough.   (Keep an eye on your pets health while meditating)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
