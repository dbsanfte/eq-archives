My shaman (lvl 11) has been slain by blue critters,<br/>\ncan take a white only if the gods are smiling on him and then will finish<br/>\nthe battle at zero mana and almost no health, and yellow is a death wish.<br/>\n<br/>\nMagician is a bit better, but his run-ins with yellows have been horrific.<br/>\nRogue is worst of all, of course.
