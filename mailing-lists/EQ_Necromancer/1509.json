I have read conflicting<br/>\nreports, some saying it is only DD and some saying it is alos 100 dmg DOT,<br/>\ncan anyoen clarify which it is? Also where should i hunt at lvl 13 to get<br/>\nto 16 fast - i will usually hunt wiht either a lvl 12 monk or druid as my<br/>\npartner - i hear oasis is good is that right? FInally I hear i can buy my<br/>\nlvl 16 pet spell in efreeport in some kind of cave, rather than research -<br/>\nis that correct and if so where is this cave? - Thanks in advance, sorry<br/>\nfor all the questions, just loving my necro! - Malados on SOlusek Ro<br/>\nserver.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis list is basically unmoderated.
