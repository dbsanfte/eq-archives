I could have sworn I would be level 7<br/>\nforever...  here&#39;s my advice, <br/>\n<br/>\nDark Elf NEcromancer only:<br/>\nTo get to level 8 after skels stop giving you decent XP, get in a group and<br/>\ntry to kill young kodiaks, zombies, and lesser mummies.  Make sure you time<br/>\nyour spells correctly... nothing sucks worse than casting all your DoT<br/>\nspells and pissing the young kodiak off so it frenzies on you.  I usually<br/>\nstart off with Clinging Darkness first in case you have to run, wait a bit<br/>\nfor your pet and the tanks to eat some damage, then hit it with Poison Bolt<br/>\nand Disease Cloud, then wait a bit, then hammer it with LifeSpikes.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter level 8 you&#39;re first two spells should be Bone Walk and Ward Undead,<br/>\nand I would get them in that order.  Hang out by the Rune or the Temple and<br/>\nwork your Ward Undead up to decent levels (30&#39;s) on the decaying skels,<br/>\nskels, and then you should be able to take a zombie and a skel at the same<br/>\ntime, though mass undead will still deal death.  Numb The Dead is cool if<br/>\nyou want to pick them off one by one, but usually by the time I get all<br/>\nprepped some higher level loser will come along and trash everything.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce you hit 9, I would be very wary but cross East Commons into West<br/>\nCommons on the South side (the desert wall side) and go into Befallen.  The<br/>\nfirst floor is loaded with skeletons and rats.  Some skels will still give<br/>\nyou XP but there&#39;s this one mob called Skeleton Lrodd who is AWESOME XP (no<br/>\nloot).  At 9 I could beat him 50% of the time on my own, so I usually shared<br/>\nwith a shadowknight or another necromancer until 10 or 11, then I killed him<br/>\nas exclusively as possible.  It IS possible to go down to the second floor,<br/>\nbut I would not suggest it without at least another necromancer and a couple<br/>\nof tanks, and then still watch for trains.  The more the merrier at those<br/>\nlevels.  Do NOT go to the third floor or beyond, you&#39;ll just be fodder.<br/>\nALWAYS go up and check on if Lrodd respawned.  Another convenient target is<br/>\nthe first floor ShadowKnight.  He&#39;s pathetic and you should just crush him<br/>\nat level 9, and he sometimes carries a Bone Chipped Rod that is worth 8 gold<br/>\nin stores... its magical but all it does is Locate Corpse, for some reason<br/>\nthe NPCs seem to want to sell this for 6000 plat.  I figure if there&#39;s ever<br/>\nanother use for it I&#39;ll just come back here for a couple hours and<br/>\nstockpile.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 12 its ALL good... we&#39;re talking with Convoke Shadow, HEat Blood, and<br/>\nEngulfing Darkness you can take 2 (three if you are lucky) young kodiaks by<br/>\nyourself before resting, nothing except the ubermonsters (hill giants,<br/>\ngriffons, werewolves) can touch you when you have full mana, and you have a<br/>\nlot more leeway.  My personal favorite is cleaning out the smaller orc camps<br/>\n(ie not the ones with legionairres) in East and West Commons to improve your<br/>\nfaction, and kill willowisps for XP and the chance of getting lesser and<br/>\ngreater lightstones (1pp and 5pp when sold to a human or non vision person)<br/>\nkodiaks are still a problem by yourself but with a 11th Shadowknight and<br/>\nanother spellcaster you can take these down no problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 12th I also recommend going to LAvastorm Mountains... pretty much<br/>\neverything is fair game (cept lavacrawlers) and the loot is decent,<br/>\nDervishes give blocks of ore, imps and drakes leave jasper and bloodstones,<br/>\nand basilisks leave eggs (worth 4-6 gold).  If you can grab another<br/>\nspellcaster or tank it gets even easier.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince I&#39;m only 13th that&#39;s as far as I can go, but I&#39;m hunting in the<br/>\nLAvastorms and its great.  I&#39;ve also been to Paw anf its a dungeon made for<br/>\nlevels 5-15.  Grab a couple tanks and two more spellcasters and you should<br/>\ntotally OWN that dungeon, with a cleric it gets even easier.  There&#39;s cool<br/>\nthings down there like totem staves and pieces of good armor.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter that, I&#39;d love to get advice from a higher level on where to go for a<br/>\nDark Elf NEcromancer.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMalark, Dark&#39;Fier Ravens, Karana Server<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Rivenhal [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Rivenhal@...\">Rivenhal@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, April 19, 1999 11:37 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [EQ_Necromancer] Re: lowbie necro<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Rivenhal&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Rivenhal@...\">Rivenhal@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Being past that lowbie phase I can tell you this:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Levels 6 to 12 can be the hardest levels.  Your offensive <br/>\n&gt; spells suck until<br/>\n&gt; you get heat blood and engulfing darkness.
