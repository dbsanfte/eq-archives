Also, do any of the items disappear when I log out?<br/>\n<br/>\nKaelrie, 20th necromancer on Fennin Ro.<br/>\n    Last night, I finished the quest for the Robe of Enshroudment (necro only<br/>\n    robe from the sol ro temple) It basically took me all weekend, I got the<br/>\n    werebat wing from Unrest first, by simply zoning in and auctioning that I&#39;d<br/>\n    pay 5p to loot it off someone&#39;s kill, got one in about 2 minutes (the<br/>\n    easiest component by far)  Next on my list was the globe of shadow, from the<br/>\n    Nokta shaman in upper guk.  This fellow spawns just past the Nok Shaman, by<br/>\n    the ancient croc and he is accompanied by 2 shin knights which were blue to<br/>\n    me at 35 and it took about 4 kills to get the globe.  The large shadow silk<br/>\n    was a pain in the butt, as shadow wolf pelts are a bit difficult to come by<br/>\n    quickly...what I did was zone into East Commons and shout &quot;20p for each<br/>\n    shadow wolf pelt brought to me&quot;  the newbies went nuts and I don&#39;t think<br/>\n    there was a wolf standing for more than 5 seconds.  Got my pelts in short<br/>\n    order.  Luckily our guild has a decent tailor so he made the shadow silk and<br/>\n    it was time to get the mask of shadow from the shadowed men.  I picked the<br/>\n    spawn in Nektulous, since it was close to the temple and I knew there<br/>\n    weren&#39;t any big beasties that would come interrupt me.  There were usually 4<br/>\n    of them at the spawn, they repop quickly and it took about 3 spawns before<br/>\n    one dropped what I needed.  In all, a relatively easy quest for a pretty<br/>\n    decent item (9AC, +4int, +4agi, +4 sv fire, +4 sv cold) and it looks very<br/>\n    cool, pure black...almost looks like your character is missing a texture. :)<br/>\n    I&#39;ve already had numerous comments on how good it looks.  That and it&#39;s nice<br/>\n    to not be one of the FBR/Oracle clones running around.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Grizumpy Bloodmaw, the fashion conscious necro.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n    This list is basically unmoderated.
