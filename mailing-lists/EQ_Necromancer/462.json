The tunnel to it is<br/>\nlocated on the opposite side of commons from entrance to Nectulos forest.<br/>\nI hunt scarabs and desert tarantulas at northern RO.  Scarabs are best, since they do<br/>\nnot poison, their carapace is worth a gold or so, you can take yellow ones fairly easy:<br/>\nlifetap, cast DOTs, keep your pet alive and get some hits in.  Watch out for madman and<br/>\npeople training mummies.  Mummies can be difficult at 8-9.  Melissa Sandwhisper an NPC<br/>\nmerchant close to zone border with freeport is tolerant enough to sell to me, she<br/>\ncarries water and rations.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRenaissance Man wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Renaissance Man&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cossettb@...\">cossettb@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m frustrated. I&#39;ve got a level 9 Necro DElf, based in Nekk Forest. I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; got 2 problems: a lack of cash and difficulty in gaining exp.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve been in in Nekk Forest, and I prefer to solo for the most part. The<br/>\n&gt; problem is finding targets to hunt. In Nekk forest, the only mobs that give<br/>\n&gt; me experience are Kodiaks and some skeletons. Mummies and zombies too, but<br/>\n&gt; those are even more rare, plus there&#39;s usually 3-4 other PC&#39;s camped at the<br/>\n&gt; spawn sites. The Lava zone seems to be too high-level for me (from reports<br/>\n&gt; from others), and while Eastern commons isn&#39;t too bad the Griffins are<br/>\n&gt; murder and getting poisoned by an asp has killed me twice. Last time I went<br/>\n&gt; through the commons I died enough that I lost all the exp. gained.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On top of this is cash flow problems. Since the rank 3 spells each cost 4.5<br/>\n&gt; pp, it&#39;s bloody expensive getting them. I picked up tailoring as a trade to<br/>\n&gt; hopefully help get extra money, but my skill is maxed at 30 from patchwork<br/>\n&gt; armor, and I don&#39;t know that I want to take up smithing to increase it some<br/>\n&gt; more (by making studded and re-inforced etc.). I&#39;ve considered maybe taking<br/>\n&gt; up another trade to help with getting extra money. Any suggestions?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Desperately waiting to hit 12th level and get some decent offensive spells .<br/>\n&gt; . .<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Brad Cossette - <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cossettb@...\">cossettb@...</a><br/>\n&gt; Sabbaoth (Dark Elf Necro 9) - Bertoxxulous<br/>\n&gt; &quot;My advice to you is to get married.
