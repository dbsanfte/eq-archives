I didn&#39;t see the choice in the list, but then, I stuck with<br/>\nBertoxxulous.  Sheesh.  Couldn&#39;t they have spelled that some _other_ way?<br/>\nIt&#39;s not even in the instruction book (ha! big surprise, eh?), had to take a<br/>\nnote from the guild for the spelling.. anyways, I ramble.<br/>\n<br/>\n    But, I found the guild.  I also found a secret entrance to it from<br/>\noutside of the city, through -- drum roll -- a false wall in the side of the<br/>\noutter city wall.  You go in, and basically take any path that goes down.<br/>\nYou&#39;ll end up in the guild.  In case you&#39;re wondering where the entrance is,<br/>\nI don&#39;t know exactly.  I just walked against the wall until I slipped it,<br/>\nfigured it&#39;d be there.  If you were coming out of the city, it&#39;ll be to your<br/>\nleft, and down quite a ways (after a corner or two, if I remember right).<br/>\nYou&#39;ll look a bit sillly, but if you really want to find it just do what I<br/>\ndone and walk against the wall until you&#39;re in.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; No... the Gods of fickle fate (OK, the designers with evil thoughts) put<br/>\n&gt; griffins in the low level (5-15 level range) hunting area.

After I lost my level to a giant spider (okay, so I got a<br/>\nlittle too cocky but hey, the other giant spider and young kodiak didn&#39;t<br/>\nhelp me any, either) and getting my cor, a Griffen thought I&#39;d make a nice,<br/>\nif not somewhat thin, quick snack.  Of course, I _quickly_ offered myself to<br/>\nthe great beast (heh)....<br/>\n<br/>\n    I wonder if they were not somewhat pressured to put them in there, or<br/>\njust plain demented.  In Qeynos, it rains, _allot_.  &#39;Course, as somebody<br/>\npointed out the Temple of Karana&#39;s there.  However, I sometimes wonder if<br/>\nthey&#39;re playing on first impressions (oh cool, look at that griffen,<br/>\nawsome!) to make people immediatly go out and brag and bring in more sales.<br/>\n;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Sonoroud.
