If Oasis is boring and crowded, the solution is NOT Lake Rathe or S<br/>\nKaranas Aviaks.  Just as crowded, just as annoying, and just as boring as<br/>\nOasis.<br/>\n<br/>\n15 or so is where groups or partners get really handy.  Spiders, snakes,<br/>\nand puppies in N Karanas are plentiful, but a poison curer is just about <br/>\nrequired.  Minos and muddites in the Gorge are good, but probably require<br/>\na partner or small group as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nKodiaks (non-young) in W Commons are probably about right for you and you<br/>\ncan solo them in all likelihood.<br/>\n<br/>\nEverfrost is going to have orcs and ice-boned skellies for you.  Rathe<br/>\nmountains has a couple of options.  You can pick up ice- and dark-boned<br/>\nskeletons if there&#39;s a group at the ruin taking the big skeletons.  In the<br/>\nsouth of the zone there&#39;s a bunch of drakes and basilisks that should be<br/>\nvery good (but don&#39;t get too close to the sphinx).  <br/>\n<br/>\nUnrest is actually very good if you have a decent group (at least 4 people<br/>\nrecommended, including one tank and one wis-based caster).  Yard trash<br/>\nwill still be blue, and pulling ghouls and mummies from the first floor is<br/>\neasy.  Pull to the back wall and you&#39;ll almost never get trained on.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Clanof1@...\">Clanof1@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Ok, im lvl 15, and oasis got kinda boring... so i went to unrest....big<br/>\n&gt; &gt;mistake... </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
