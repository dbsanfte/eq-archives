Just thought  I d show you how I Solo with ST . =) Try to raise your charisma to a decent level to get a better success rate and more consistant mez","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-565728538\">Hi Y&#39;all !<br/>\n<br/>\nJust thought  I&#39;d show you how I Solo with ST . =)<br/>\nTry to raise your charisma to a decent level to get a better success<br/>\nrate<br/>\nand more consistant mez timing .<br/>\nWe all know that damage will break ST (once they fix the random stun bug<br/>\nanyway)<br/>\nBut did u know that ST is still an amazing solo/kiting spell ?<br/>\nHere&#39;s how u use it ...<br/>\n<br/>\nImagine you are soloing the Bard Valen Nostrolo in South Karana at lvl<br/>\n29.<br/>\nHe is a lvl 31 or 32 mob who has accelerado on so he runs pretty fast.<br/>\nI always start fights with the allure of death/call of bones series on .<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Cast Screaming Terror  (Of coz!)<br/>\nIf it doesnt stick run for a few secs till u can recast ST ... If it<br/>\nsticks ...<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Apply Darkness onto him .<br/>\nYou should have between 2-4 casts depending on your charisma<br/>\nso darkness failing/resisting isnt a problem anymore , and we all<br/>\nknow how good the darkness success rates are dont we ? =)<br/>\n<br/>\n3) If Darkness Sticks on first or second try , Apply Boil Blood as well<br/>\n.<br/>\nyou should have plenty of time to cast it if Darkness sticks 1st cast.<br/>\nIf darkness was resisted 4 or more times , cast Harmshield and head to<br/>\nzone =)<br/>\nor cast Feign Death and start praying .=/<br/>\nyou might not have enough mana at lvl 30 to take him down.<br/>\nFor those willing to put their balls on the line and have jboots/sow .<br/>\nPut get to max distance and recast darkness .<br/>\n<br/>\n4) If you are using a pet , Apply Fear . If without pet Apply Vampiric<br/>\ncurse to get back some HP . Whatever the case , 3-5 Shock of Poison<br/>\nnormally settles it .<br/>\n<br/>\n5) Loot , Rinse , Repeat ad Infinitum .<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of You probably know how its done already .<br/>\nMost of u have been doing the exact same thing<br/>\nwithout screaming terror for ages . Except that now<br/>\nyou have a chance at recasting darkness MANY<br/>\ntimes . We know how crutial darkness is at soloing/kiting<br/>\nand with the kind of success rates it has it just wont do.<br/>\nUsing screaming terror along with your normal tactics<br/>\nreally gives us more consistant kills .<br/>\n<br/>\nSince Mezmerize is Charisma based , You should use<br/>\nitems to buff your charisma to 85 or higher for better<br/>\nsuccess with ST . I swopped my weapon for a crude stein.<br/>\n<br/>\nHavent tried ST -&gt; Beguile Undead on Spectres yet .<br/>\nIf someone tries it please let us know . Not sure if<br/>\nthe Charm breaks ST yet .<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanx for reading this far !<br/>\nThis is just how &quot;I&quot; do it ...<br/>\nNo , &quot;YOU SUCK&quot; , &quot;DO IT MY WAY&quot; flames please .<br/>\nI&#39;d love some criticism on how to improve the strategy<br/>\nthough so lets get this thread going . =)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nregards,<br/>\n<br/>\nKAEN &quot;DaFrigginNecroWithNoLastName&quot;<br/>\n34th Necro on Erollisi Marr .</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
