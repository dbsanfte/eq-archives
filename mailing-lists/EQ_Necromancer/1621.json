I know it&#39;s a mez, but it&#39;s also a <br/>\nfear. My chr is around 48 and I rarely get resisted on screaming terror by <br/>\nblues and evens, and it usually lasts for 20 to 30 seconds. I think since it <br/>\nis a fear spell as well, it is basedsoley on magic resistance. Granted this <br/>\nis just my opinion, but with a 48 Chr I wouldn&#39;t thank I have my about <br/>\n90-95% success rate if it was CHR based.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Gabriel Kang &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chaotic@...\">chaotic@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a>, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kenn@...\">kenn@...</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: [EQ_Necromancer] Tactics Soloing with Screaming Terror<br/>\n&gt;Date: Wed, 08 Dec 1999 11:38:46 +0800<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hi Y&#39;all !<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Just thought  I&#39;d show you how I Solo with ST . =)<br/>\n&gt;Try to raise your charisma to a decent level to get a better success<br/>\n&gt;rate<br/>\n&gt;and more consistant mez timing .<br/>\n&gt;We all know that damage will break ST (once they fix the random stun bug<br/>\n&gt;anyway)<br/>\n&gt;But did u know that ST is still an amazing solo/kiting spell ?<br/>\n&gt;Here&#39;s how u use it ...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Imagine you are soloing the Bard Valen Nostrolo in South Karana at lvl<br/>\n&gt;29.<br/>\n&gt;He is a lvl 31 or 32 mob who has accelerado on so he runs pretty fast.<br/>\n&gt;I always start fights with the allure of death/call of bones series on .<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;1) Cast Screaming Terror  (Of coz!)<br/>\n&gt;If it doesnt stick run for a few secs till u can recast ST ... If it<br/>\n&gt;sticks ...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;2) Apply Darkness onto him .<br/>\n&gt;You should have between 2-4 casts depending on your charisma<br/>\n&gt;so darkness failing/resisting isnt a problem anymore , and we all<br/>\n&gt;know how good the darkness success rates are dont we ? =)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;3) If Darkness Sticks on first or second try , Apply Boil Blood as well<br/>\n&gt;.<br/>\n&gt;you should have plenty of time to cast it if Darkness sticks 1st cast.<br/>\n&gt;If darkness was resisted 4 or more times , cast Harmshield and head to<br/>\n&gt;zone =)<br/>\n&gt;or cast Feign Death and start praying .=/<br/>\n&gt;you might not have enough mana at lvl 30 to take him down.<br/>\n&gt;For those willing to put their balls on the line and have jboots/sow .<br/>\n&gt;Put get to max distance and recast darkness .<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;4) If you are using a pet , Apply Fear . If without pet Apply Vampiric<br/>\n&gt;curse to get back some HP . Whatever the case , 3-5 Shock of Poison<br/>\n&gt;normally settles it .<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;5) Loot , Rinse , Repeat ad Infinitum .<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;All of You probably know how its done already .<br/>\n&gt;Most of u have been doing the exact same thing<br/>\n&gt;without screaming terror for ages . Except that now<br/>\n&gt;you have a chance at recasting darkness MANY<br/>\n&gt;times . We know how crutial darkness is at soloing/kiting<br/>\n&gt;and with the kind of success rates it has it just wont do.<br/>\n&gt;Using screaming terror along with your normal tactics<br/>\n&gt;really gives us more consistant kills .<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Since Mezmerize is Charisma based , You should use<br/>\n&gt;items to buff your charisma to 85 or higher for better<br/>\n&gt;success with ST . I swopped my weapon for a crude stein.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Havent tried ST -&gt; Beguile Undead on Spectres yet .<br/>\n&gt;If someone tries it please let us know . Not sure if<br/>\n&gt;the Charm breaks ST yet .<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanx for reading this far !<br/>\n&gt;This is just how &quot;I&quot; do it ...<br/>\n&gt;No , &quot;YOU SUCK&quot; , &quot;DO IT MY WAY&quot; flames please .<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;d love some criticism on how to improve the strategy<br/>\n&gt;though so lets get this thread going . =)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;regards,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;KAEN &quot;DaFrigginNecroWithNoLastName&quot;<br/>\n&gt;34th Necro on Erollisi Marr .<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;This list is basically unmoderated.
