These spells<br/>\n(combine AoD with LifeDrain) were made to make us more powerful, but not<br/>\neternally fighting.  We can last longer draining and getting faster mana and<br/>\ndraining our victims, but it does give us less options.  We HAVE to drain<br/>\nour victims, we can&#39;t just sit back and let the DoT do its work, this means<br/>\nthe monsters get more pissed at us, which leads to obvious consequences.

I have<br/>\n&gt; recently created one as a 2nd char and am up to lev 5.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I noticed we get some spells that erode our hps while <br/>\n&gt; regenerating our mana<br/>\n&gt; at the same time. Does that imply we can use the enemy MOB as <br/>\n&gt; a hp battery<br/>\n&gt; to solo with minimal net loss of hps or manna?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Here&#39;s what I mean. Can I cast &quot;dark pack&quot; (name might be <br/>\n&gt; wrong) or &quot;allure<br/>\n&gt; of death&quot; on myself. Thus my hps start to fall. Then I engage <br/>\n&gt; the enemy with<br/>\n&gt; the classic 3 DOT spells plus send my pet in. By this time <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m out half my<br/>\n&gt; manna from the DOT and my hps are falling from the &quot;Allure of <br/>\n&gt; death&quot; or<br/>\n&gt; whatever. My manna is comming back faster then normal as <br/>\n&gt; well. Can I now<br/>\n&gt; life drain the enemy for hps that will turn to manna to use <br/>\n&gt; to life drain<br/>\n&gt; enemy again? Will this hold up in a fight? IE. The fight ends <br/>\n&gt; and I still<br/>\n&gt; have most my hps and half my manna? As the life drains ended <br/>\n&gt; up being free<br/>\n&gt; as they were from the monsters hps converted to my hps <br/>\n&gt; converted to manna?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am interested in this or other fighting styles?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sincerely a curious young necromancer<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Eloric<br/>\n&gt; Necromancer (Rank 2) Mythannial Marr<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt;                       Free Games, Cash Prizes!<br/>\n&gt;             Gamesville - World&#39;s Biggest Game Show Site!<br/>\n&gt;                 <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/ad/gamesville0\">http://www.onelist.com/ad/gamesville0</a><br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; This list is basically unmoderated.
