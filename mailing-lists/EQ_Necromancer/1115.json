I&#39;m level 26, and heard this wasn&#39;t the<br/>\nbest place to solo (unkempt druids), but the two treants and the aviak city<br/>\nare sooooo over camped on my server. Even at 4 in the morning when only 550<br/>\nare on the server, at least 65 are in S. Karana. If anyone has better ideas<br/>\nof what to solo at this level, I&#39;d be very interested in hearing from you. I<br/>\nreally don&#39;t like the idea of wandering mobs sneaking up on me - but its<br/>\nbetter than waiting 2 hours for a damn aviak....<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Darnizhaan D&#39;Mortis</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
