A few things of note: Dark Elves do not tolerate","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1851082578\">I just started a Dark Elven Necro on Rallos this weekend, for the very same <br/>\nreasons, and got him up to 6. A few things of note:<br/>\n<br/>\nDark Elves do not tolerate same-race killers. Ex. one certain level 5 Wizard <br/>\n(Nuitari is the name, how original) constantly kills newbies (for money he <br/>\nsays). I have made it a point to kill him on sight, and so have about 8 <br/>\nother people I saw last night.<br/>\nThe first time I encountered him, I sent my pet and cast Poison Bolt, which <br/>\nis DoT as we all know. He ran like a little girl, trying to cast gate all <br/>\nthe way...As far as I could tell, my pet never got a hit in before he went <br/>\ninvis or gated. The next time I saw him was just inside the city, and he was <br/>\nat half health. It would seem to me this is because of my DoT spell (?) I&#39;ve <br/>\nnever heard of these types of spells not working, and I&#39;ve even heard of <br/>\nstories from beta, so I&#39;d assume they worked then... I&#39;ll cast it on myself <br/>\ntonight to be sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is rumored that this &quot;racial unity&quot; is unique to the evil races. I have <br/>\nheard this in-game and also on message boards. Humans tend to slaughter each <br/>\nother, and when parties of Trolls or whatnot attack Freeport, not many unite <br/>\nto defend it. On the flip side, last night a level 4 Human Enchanter dared <br/>\nenter our sacred forest (oops, sorry it&#39;s catching, heh). He had invis, so <br/>\nit was a scramble for everyone in-zone to switch languages to Dark Speech, <br/>\ngather the people who could detect invis near the bottlenecks like the <br/>\nbridge or the zone entrance, and find him. I&#39;ve never witnessed this kind of <br/>\norganization/cooperation on other servers (Fennin, Solusek).<br/>\n<br/>\nI have yet to travel out of Nektulos, so I can&#39;t help there. I&#39;m waiting for <br/>\nlevel 8, for the invis of course. I also can&#39;t say I&#39;ve witnessed this <br/>\nracial untiy type thing as a wood elf either. I started a ranger for the <br/>\nheck of it, and while I was in the orc camp I was murdered. Beware taking on <br/>\ntough mobs and getting low on health, cause that is a temptation some cannot <br/>\nresist. I was killed in two shots by an 8th level erudite wizard, while two <br/>\nother wood elves watched. I&#39;m sure there are some instances of it with other <br/>\nraces, I&#39;ve just never seen it or been a part of it. In fact, I&#39;ve seen more <br/>\ninstances of people helping and healing others than I have of mindless <br/>\nslaughter. I was scared at first, but it is very exciting, and a little fear <br/>\nis healthy on Rallos. =)<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been toying with the possibility as well, but I&#39;m waiting on a couple<br/>\nthings first.<br/>\n<br/>\nA)  DoT spells are illegal.  Actually anywhere where you can kill your<br/>\nopponent indirectly (like ROOTing someone underwater) is illegal because<br/>\nthey don&#39;t classify that damage or something.  What does this mean?  A<br/>\nnecromancer is virtually castrated.  NO DoT means no Darkness Spells, No<br/>\nBlood, Bo Heart Flutter, etc.  Its sucks really bad.<br/>\n<br/>\nB) Faction on inter-racial PKing.  Basically this is player enforced.  You<br/>\nget a bad mark on your through players only but often this doesn&#39;t mean<br/>\nanything.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSome things I&#39;ve noticed or heard about.  Essentially the only place you are<br/>\nmostly safe is your own newbie area outside home, even then not much.  But<br/>\nin most open areas there&#39;s mostly an unspoken peace.  It is NOT the<br/>\nnightmare ambush world a lot of people are afraid of where you can&#39;t rest<br/>\nanywhere or anything.  Its bad sometimes, but for the most part you&#39;ll just<br/>\nsee people giving each other a WIDE berth, with some groups of vigilantes<br/>\nrunning around.  Things are definitely more exciting, and advancing in the<br/>\nhigher teens is often more difficult simply because your access to other<br/>\nareas is somewhat more difficult.  This is mostly on Antonica though.  If<br/>\nyou start in Faydwer there&#39;s this nasty stuff going on between the Gnomes<br/>\nand Elves, but for the most part you are as safe as in nonPvP.  Erud is<br/>\nstill as crappy as it ever is.  Most of the cool PvP stuff happens on<br/>\nAntonica.  It gnaws at me more and more to try out Rallos Zek, but I don&#39;t<br/>\nwant to do it till they fix DoT spells and other assorted screwups.<br/>\n<br/>\nMalark on Karana<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Stuart Christian [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:stuartc@...\">stuartc@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, May 11, 1999 1:51 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [EQ_Necromancer] PVP<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone play on Rallos Zek?  I was thinking of starting a character<br/>\nthere, but I have heard both positive and negative things about the server.<br/>\nDoes it differ a lot from the regular servers, besides anyone can kill you<br/>\nwithin 4 levels?  Do you still have the evil races grouping with the good<br/>\nraces or do they tend to group among their own race?  How is the rampant Pk<br/>\nsituation, human killing other humans etc..??  Sorry for all the questions<br/>\nbut I&#39;m getting bored with fighting NPCs on E&#39;ci and I think being able to<br/>\nfight the goodie goodies would spice it up a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was also thinking of joining a guild and participating in guildwars but I<br/>\nhaven&#39;t heard of any guilds doing that and what I see, all the guilds are<br/>\nletting every race/class in.  Which, IMHO isn&#39;t RP at all.  Even if the<br/>\n&quot;evil&quot; character claims that he has turned good.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Kilven (E&#39;ci)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
