This fellow spawns just past the Nok Shaman, by<br/>\nthe ancient croc and he is accompanied by 2 shin knights which were blue to<br/>\nme at 35 and it took about 4 kills to get the globe.  The large shadow silk<br/>\nwas a pain in the butt, as shadow wolf pelts are a bit difficult to come by<br/>\nquickly...what I did was zone into East Commons and shout &quot;20p for each<br/>\nshadow wolf pelt brought to me&quot;  the newbies went nuts and I don&#39;t think<br/>\nthere was a wolf standing for more than 5 seconds.  Got my pelts in short<br/>\norder.  Luckily our guild has a decent tailor so he made the shadow silk and<br/>\nit was time to get the mask of shadow from the shadowed men.  I picked the<br/>\nspawn in Nektulous, since it was close to the temple and I knew there<br/>\nweren&#39;t any big beasties that would come interrupt me.  There were usually 4<br/>\nof them at the spawn, they repop quickly and it took about 3 spawns before<br/>\none dropped what I needed.  In all, a relatively easy quest for a pretty<br/>\ndecent item (9AC, +4int, +4agi, +4 sv fire, +4 sv cold) and it looks very<br/>\ncool, pure black...almost looks like your character is missing a texture. :)<br/>\nI&#39;ve already had numerous comments on how good it looks.  That and it&#39;s nice<br/>\nto not be one of the FBR/Oracle clones running around.<br/>\n<br/>\nGrizumpy Bloodmaw, the fashion conscious necro.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
