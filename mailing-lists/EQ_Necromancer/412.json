I might<br/>\n&gt; restart the char after hearing from you.   I have 130 int and I put the rest<br/>\n&gt; in dex . . .     is the Euidite or  Gnome a better choice?  And how KOS<br/>\n&gt; prone are Gnome Necromancers or Euridites?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  Race is really a personal preference. I chose Dark Elf myself, but that<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean Gnome or Erudite isn&#39;t a good choice. Many people like<br/>\nplaying things other than Dark Elf simply because they feel the Dark Elf<br/>\nnecro is too cliche&#39;. <br/>\n  The way you put stats is perfect... 130 int and the rest in dex is<br/>\nexactly what you should do.  Erudite suffers from a bad starting area, and<br/>\nlack of ultravision. They do get a bit higher INT, but that only<br/>\ntranslates to 100 mana at level 50.  Hardly a concern. Gnomes are a good<br/>\nchoice as well as DE. They have similar stats, have infravision, and a<br/>\nbetter starting area. However, it is a tad harder to buy things around<br/>\nthere since many more merchants hate you. Neriak typically doesn&#39;t have<br/>\nthat problem.<br/>\n  Of all the necromancers I have talked to that have gotten higher level<br/>\nthan me, they have all been very happy with their choice of race,<br/>\nregardless of what race that was. I don&#39;t mention human simply because I<br/>\ndon&#39;t feel that is the wisest choice unless you wish to play one for<br/>\nroleplay reasons. <br/>\n<br/>\nValdus<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks . ..<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; P.S.  any gnome necros get KOS by dwarves or high elves wood elves or<br/>\n&gt; humans?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; personally ive liked even the idea of the necro when i heard about it<br/>\n&gt; while<br/>\n&gt; &gt; eq was still in development.  i have to say i like the class, and we<br/>\n&gt; really<br/>\n&gt; &gt; do have many advantages that other classes dont get.  the ability to heal<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ourselves in combat while doing DD is very good, as is having a pet skel.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; our mastery over the undead is great too. the only bad thing is getting<br/>\n&gt; KOS<br/>\n&gt; &gt; by a great deal of npc&#39;s, but there has to be a trade-off somewhere.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; other classes i was looking at for a second character was either a druid<br/>\n&gt; or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a shaman- both seem to have a pretty broad base of spells.  an enchanter<br/>\n&gt; may<br/>\n&gt; &gt; also be good, but i havent decided =)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; belphenor<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;From: &quot;Mata&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mata_eq@...\">mata_eq@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;I have a wizard who is 14th and I just started a necro and am 2nd lvl. ..<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;I think Necromancer may be the way to go but I would like to hear your<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;opinions,  how is the high lvl Necro stuff going?  Can you hold your<br/>\n&gt; own???<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;I like my 14th lvl wizard and I think I might just use both classes but<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;like to hear input . . .<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Thanks!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; _______________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Get Free Email and Do More On The Web.
