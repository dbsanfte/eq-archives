Anyway...<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Lavastorm there are no undead.  Atleast none that I have ever seen.<br/>\nUndead are in Najena, mainly large skeletons inside the entrance that were<br/>\ngreen to me at 15th but still felt that they had to try to bash my head in.<br/>\n Of corse there are some dark bone skeletons and such farther in.<br/>\nLavastorm is a zone just like its name.  Everything is resistant to fire.<br/>\nThe Fire elementals, Fire Drakes, Fire goblins, Fire Imps, Lava Crawlers<br/>\n(only can be hit by magic)  I&#39;ve never made it around to explore the other<br/>\nparts of the zone.  I think I would want to get someone to cast levitate on<br/>\nme before I got that brave.  Your body will be unretrievable if you fall<br/>\ninto the lava and die there.<br/>\n<br/>\nRTS is a Runed Totem Staff.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso I was skimming through some back digests and I could have swarn I saw<br/>\nsomeone talk about setting up a spell page on the web to list mana and<br/>\ndamage for spells as well as descriptions and general locations of where<br/>\nthey can be purchased.  I think this would be a vey nice idea, and I would<br/>\nbe happy to contribute data for such a project.  My Gnome wiz is 18th and I<br/>\njust got my necro to 9th,  Not to mention my 10th Druid, or 7th Bard :)<br/>\nJust as an Idea, instead of working on your completely own page you might<br/>\nconsider trying to work with one of the more popular EQ information web<br/>\nsites that are out there.  EQ&#39;Lizer comes to mind when thinking of good<br/>\nspell lists. <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.gameznet.com/eq/\">http://www.gameznet.com/eq/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway if your looking for a list of pet commands and general help like<br/>\nthat.  I have a friend that has been putting useful info on his page as<br/>\nwell as has links to most of the major EQ based websites.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://members.door.net/enigma/EQInfo.htm\">http://members.door.net/enigma/EQInfo.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve always herd that your pet will heal faster if its sitting down.  I<br/>\nhave never really had much chance to experiment with this since my pet<br/>\nusually heals up pretty quick anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your casting 3rd rank or lower pet summoning spells.  Weapons can be<br/>\nhandy.  I believe it adds to their attack value.  I usually carry one rusty<br/>\nweapon around with me for the next pet that I know I will need to summon.<br/>\nI usually sell them for the money, but once a friend gave my pet a rusty<br/>\nhalbard.  My white con pet at 9th was hitting for 20 damage more often than<br/>\nnot.  He was taking about as well as the 10th level sk I was grouped with.<br/>\nOnce you get the 4th rank of pet spells I don&#39;t recomend giving your pet a<br/>\nweapon.  Most pets of the 4th rank can start hitting magical cratures and<br/>\nsome can get double attacks if they con high.  It defets the pets better<br/>\nskills to give them a weapon at these levels.  They will loose their better<br/>\nattacks.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would like to add that I think adding a line that says &quot;You have summones<br/>\na week, average, above average, strong pet would be very nice to see<br/>\nimplemented in the game.  I think the Magicians would also enjoy this if it<br/>\nwere added to the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nLomack, BCK-MoR<br/>\nwww.bck.org<br/>\n<br/>\nPS.  For those of you looking for a guild.  No I am not plugging mine.  But<br/>\nas the Master of Recruiting for my guild I can&#39;t tell you how important I<br/>\nbelieve it is to adventure with persons of a guild for a while before<br/>\nconsidering joining.<br/>\n1. You get to learn about the ways and tendencies of the guild you are<br/>\nconsidering joining before your expected to live by their rules.<br/>\n2.  The members of the guild get to meet you.  Not every guild just takes<br/>\nmembers off the street.  Many of them are looking for nice solid players.<br/>\nIts always best to make sure that a perticular guild will fit in with your<br/>\ntype of play before you consider joining.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for letting me rant :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Message: 4<br/>\n&gt;   Date: Tue, 25 May 1999 08:05:36 -0400<br/>\n&gt;   From: &quot;Mata&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mata_eq@...\">mata_eq@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: level 12 necro.. about time!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Are there a lot of undead in Lavastorm???<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt;From: James &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:manickd@...\">manickd@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sent: Tuesday, May 25, 1999 6:45 AM<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [EQ_Necromancer] level 12 necro.. about time!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; From: &quot;James&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:manickd@...\">manickd@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; How do you go there from say the swash buckler in the cave.

The experience is great, the loot is wonderful, there<br/>\n&gt;&gt; are<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;words to be found here, and it is grossly underpopulated.  Just make sure<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;you either have a summoned dagger for your skeleton or it is level 12,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; since<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;there are many magical creatures here.
