If you are<br/>\ntoo high a level and they are smart enough they&#39;ll still leave you alone<br/>\nthough undead and elementals have a VERY low morale loss rating (undead in<br/>\nfact never run I think) so they almost always attack.<br/>\n<br/>\nGlares at you threateningly is sort of KOS, meaning I think they have a<br/>\nlower agg range.  In Rathe Mountains I can get close to preservers that con<br/>\nthis to me, but if I attack a bear or something while they are nearby or I<br/>\nget TOO close they go into agg mode.  I think basically their agg range is<br/>\nreduced and if you do anything other than walk/run by they attack.<br/>\n<br/>\nGlowers at you dubiously is non KOS but non vending.  They don&#39;t jump you,<br/>\nthey don&#39;t get mad when you beat on stuff (unless they are assigned to<br/>\nprotect whatever you are beating on) but they won&#39;t buy/sell anything and<br/>\nthey won&#39;t do questy type things either.<br/>\n<br/>\nLooks at you indifferently, nonKOS and will do vending and quests<br/>\n<br/>\nLokks at you warmly is non KOS and vending and questing and means you are in<br/>\ngood standing.<br/>\n<br/>\nLooks at you amiably is the same only better.  I think this also means you<br/>\nget discounts at vendors and stuff, but I don&#39;t know for sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nMalark<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Stuart Christian [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:stuartc@...\">stuartc@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, May 10, 1999 10:53 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [EQ_Necromancer] KOS<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Stuart Christian&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:stuartc@...\">stuartc@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m wondering when I con something what are the messages that <br/>\n&gt; mean I will be<br/>\n&gt; KOS by the NPC?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Scowls at you, ready to attack is kinda obvious... :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -Kilven (E&#39;ci)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; Looking for a new hobby?
