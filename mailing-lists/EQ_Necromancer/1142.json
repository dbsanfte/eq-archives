I had two other friends an<br/>\nenchanter and a ranger start collecting material at the beginning of last<br/>\nweek. We proceeded to do the quest several times and sold 13 steins before<br/>\nwe were done. By Friday of last week you couldn&#39;t give a stein away. Just<br/>\nglad we got in on the ground floor. We have things we wouldn&#39;t expect to see<br/>\nfor another 10 or 15 levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know it may be an exploit and that some people may feel we cheapened the<br/>\nquest but, trading is a part of the game and the only way to trade up is to<br/>\nhave something a higher level character wants and doesn&#39;t know how or where<br/>\nto get it.  Of course after the quest was posted that all changed, the<br/>\nbeauty of the internet.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople do say at higher levels a weapon will no longer be needed and you<br/>\nrely on your spells and mana.  I however it will make me feel better knowing<br/>\nI have a weapon with me that one time I really need it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAljernon<br/>\n24th Level Wizard<br/>\n<br/>\nDrahkoth<br/>\n8th Level Necromancer<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Naeeldar [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jackal@...\">jackal@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, August 17, 1999 3:47 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ_Necromancer] Questions about the Water Crystal Staff<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Naeeldar&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jackal@...\">jackal@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHeh I hope you can get another glowing stein because I&#39;m currently Level 34<br/>\nand I don&#39;t even carry a weapon anymore except for my Stilleto of the<br/>\nBloodClaw which I&#39;m currently trying to sell. That intell from the stein is<br/>\nso important, the staff while good is not very useful since you never melee<br/>\nanymore it just doesn&#39;t happen. Anyway thought I&#39;d throw in my 2 cents.<br/>\n<br/>\nNaeeldar K&#39;Valle Dark Elf Necromancer</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
