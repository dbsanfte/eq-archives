I have bought Cavorting Bones(I <br/>\n&gt;think that is the name of the level 4 pet spell), Clinging Darkness, and <br/>\n&gt;Lifespike. Are tehre any other spells I should buy at this level. I am not <br/>\n&gt;going to buy Gate until level 8, because I will not be travelling far until <br/>\n&gt;level 8(when I get Gather Shadows). At level 8, what spells should I buy? <br/>\n&gt;Right now, I am thinking Gather Shadows -&gt; Pet -&gt; Gate -&gt; Ward Undead. Are <br/>\n&gt;there any other spells I should buy at this level?
