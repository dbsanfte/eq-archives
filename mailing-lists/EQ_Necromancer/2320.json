I am really looking forward to EQ2 as well as Planetside. If you<br/>\n&gt; ask me, it looks like Sony will be the numero uno MMORPG game company out<br/>\n&gt; there. And believe me, companies love nothing more than a continuous<br/>\n&gt; revenue<br/>\n&gt; stream, especially from loyal and dedicated fans.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>EQ2 uses the same engine as Star Wars Galaxies, which you were just dissing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; all felt pretty alien to me. Since I don&#39;t have Luclin, the graphics were<br/>\n&gt; obviously VERY dated. I would have liked to have tried EQ with updated<br/>\n&gt; graphics.

The<br/>\n&gt; classic DAoC sells in most stores for about $20 w/1month free access. So<br/>\n&gt; its<br/>\n&gt; not too bad to check it out.
