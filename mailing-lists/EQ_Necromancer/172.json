I have<br/>\nrecently created one as a 2nd char and am up to lev 5.<br/>\n<br/>\nI noticed we get some spells that erode our hps while regenerating our mana<br/>\nat the same time. Does that imply we can use the enemy MOB as a hp battery<br/>\nto solo with minimal net loss of hps or manna?<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s what I mean. Can I cast &quot;dark pack&quot; (name might be wrong) or &quot;allure<br/>\nof death&quot; on myself. Thus my hps start to fall. Then I engage the enemy with<br/>\nthe classic 3 DOT spells plus send my pet in. By this time I&#39;m out half my<br/>\nmanna from the DOT and my hps are falling from the &quot;Allure of death&quot; or<br/>\nwhatever. My manna is comming back faster then normal as well. Can I now<br/>\nlife drain the enemy for hps that will turn to manna to use to life drain<br/>\nenemy again? Will this hold up in a fight? IE. The fight ends and I still<br/>\nhave most my hps and half my manna? As the life drains ended up being free<br/>\nas they were from the monsters hps converted to my hps converted to manna?<br/>\n<br/>\nI am interested in this or other fighting styles?<br/>\n<br/>\nSincerely a curious young necromancer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEloric<br/>\nNecromancer (Rank 2) Mythannial Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
