I&#39;ve<br/>\ngot 2 problems: a lack of cash and difficulty in gaining exp.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been in in Nekk Forest, and I prefer to solo for the most part. The<br/>\nproblem is finding targets to hunt. In Nekk forest, the only mobs that give<br/>\nme experience are Kodiaks and some skeletons. Mummies and zombies too, but<br/>\nthose are even more rare, plus there&#39;s usually 3-4 other PC&#39;s camped at the<br/>\nspawn sites. The Lava zone seems to be too high-level for me (from reports<br/>\nfrom others), and while Eastern commons isn&#39;t too bad the Griffins are<br/>\nmurder and getting poisoned by an asp has killed me twice. Last time I went<br/>\nthrough the commons I died enough that I lost all the exp. gained.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn top of this is cash flow problems. Since the rank 3 spells each cost 4.5<br/>\npp, it&#39;s bloody expensive getting them. I picked up tailoring as a trade to<br/>\nhopefully help get extra money, but my skill is maxed at 30 from patchwork<br/>\narmor, and I don&#39;t know that I want to take up smithing to increase it some<br/>\nmore (by making studded and re-inforced etc.). I&#39;ve considered maybe taking<br/>\nup another trade to help with getting extra money. Any suggestions?<br/>\n<br/>\nDesperately waiting to hit 12th level and get some decent offensive spells .<br/>\n. .<br/>\n<br/>\nBrad Cossette - <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cossettb@...\">cossettb@...</a><br/>\nSabbaoth (Dark Elf Necro 9) - Bertoxxulous<br/>\n&quot;My advice to you is to get married.
