I am currently playing a gnome magician on<br/>\n&gt;mythannial marr named Veneficus and I have reached 15th level so far. I am<br/>\n&gt;enjoying my time for the most part. As with any class/race combo there are<br/>\n&gt;problems, but I can mostly live with them. The Olympic jump I need to make<br/>\n&gt;to get onto the boat between freeport and butcherblock is a Pain, and not<br/>\n&gt;having the research components in the game for 24+ level pets is a pain<br/>\n </span></blockquote>(but<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;by the time I&#39;m there it&#39;ll most likely be fixed). We&#39;ll enough rambling<br/>\n </span></blockquote>and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;back to my point.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I am thinking of playing a different char to give myself a break from time<br/>\n&gt;to time from my main one. I have seriously considered a halfling warrior<br/>\n </span></blockquote>but<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I think I&#39;d get board of any warrior type FAST as you just stand there with<br/>\n&gt;almost no strategy involved. The only real classes that seem to be worth a<br/>\n&gt;second character are druids and necromancers.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Druids seem very well rounded and but i&#39;m concerned they will be too<br/>\n&gt;crippled in a dungeon, and I think dungeons can be a blast to fight in. I<br/>\n&gt;didn&#39;t take a Necromancer in the beginning as I was VERY afraid of the KOS<br/>\n&gt;in most places. However, now that I have a basic feel for the game I&#39;m not<br/>\n&gt;so afraid of that and I&#39;d be a dark elf so my home town will like me. It<br/>\n&gt;seems that necromancers fight their own way with their pet so it wouldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;feel like my magician feels. Also I&#39;d be tall for a change hehe.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;What do you all think. Are necromancers and magicians soo close together<br/>\n&gt;that I&#39;d feel like I&#39;m playing the same character? Should I thus take the<br/>\n&gt;druid for a different feel? Are they any MAJOR short falls to being a<br/>\n&gt;necromancer due to things in the game still being broken?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;It seems that necromancers are stronger characters then some other classes<br/>\n&gt;with the balance coming in terms of difficulty with faction. Is that true?<br/>\n&gt;Also, what level would I have to take my necromancer too in order to get a<br/>\n&gt;feel for what its like. it was a minimum of 8th better 12th to get a feel<br/>\n&gt;for what a magician is like.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Any help is welcome.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Veneficus - The Way -<br/>\n&gt;Mythannial Marr<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;...
