I have bought Cavorting Bones(I think that is the name of the level 4 pet spell), Clinging Darkness, and Lifespike. Are tehre any other spells I should buy at this level. I am not going to buy Gate until level 8, because I will not be travelling far until level 8(when I get Gather Shadows). At level 8, what spells should I buy? Right now, I am thinking Gather Shadows -&gt; Pet -&gt; Gate -&gt; Ward Undead. Are there any other spells I should buy at this level? And should I change this order?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLeanne, level 5 Gnomish Necromancer</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
