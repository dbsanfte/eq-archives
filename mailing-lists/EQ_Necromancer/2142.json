Hate<br/>\nused to be a ton more fun when they had pets and it was actually dangerous,<br/>\nit&#39;s way easier now. It&#39;s kind of like fear broken when it gets farmed.<br/>\n<br/>\nTry a few fear breaks just make sure your groups know what their doing or<br/>\nyou&#39;ll lose a good level or 2. Fear breaks are extremly fun though. Some of<br/>\nmy most fun fights are on our second wave in and fighting 3 mobs then 3 more<br/>\n3 more and then another 3 without a break naked! That&#39;s some of the most fun<br/>\nI&#39;ve ever had. 12 man fear breaks are also cool but tough.<br/>\n<br/>\nNaeeldar<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ligge@...\">ligge@...</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ligge@...\">ligge@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@egroups.com\">EQ_Necromancer@egroups.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@egroups.com\">EQ_Necromancer@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Thursday, June 01, 2000 1:58 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ_Necromancer] Planes<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;In a message dated 6/1/00 10:47:08 AM US Mountain Standard Time,<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jackal@...\">jackal@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Not sure what you mean highpass.
