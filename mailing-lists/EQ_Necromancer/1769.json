I have only used it a few times and didn&#39;t notice a <br/>\nhuge difference. It may have been that the MOBs I was fighting had such a <br/>\nhigh AC to begin with that missing a few didn&#39;t make much of a difference. I <br/>\nforget exactly how many AC it sucks away anyhow. I didn&#39;t really go out of my <br/>\nway to get the words, but I stumbled across them in my journeys so I went <br/>\nahead and researched the spell. I often times don&#39;t have a slot left for it, <br/>\nbut if you have an extra slot, go ahead and use it. Definitely buy the Fear <br/>\nupgrade, Invoke Fear.
