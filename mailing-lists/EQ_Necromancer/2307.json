I think if you are comming from the PC<br/>\nversion of EQ, even if its been a while since you last played, that you will<br/>\nprobably be a little disappointed.  The graphics are ok, but the game play<br/>\nmechanics were just not my cup of tea.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen again, I&#39;m sure they&#39;ve made huge strides since I last played the PS2<br/>\nBETA, so its probably worth it to try it out for yourself and make your own<br/>\nconclusions.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know its not much info, but its really all I have. I hope this helped you<br/>\nin some way. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Oskar</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
