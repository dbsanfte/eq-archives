I am currently punishing<br/>\nmyself to get to level 16, and I really can&#39;t find any one good source of<br/>\nXP, though the Oasis is doing alright for now.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI think that 8 to 12 is worse than 7th to 8th.  You are basically<br/>\nrelegated to killing only undead monsters.  All of your other offensive<br/>\nspells are 1st and 4th level spells (Vampiric Embrace either doesn&#39;t work or<br/>\njust plain sucks) thus most monsters you would face to gain experience in<br/>\nthe 8-12 range will shrug all of those off.  If we didn&#39;t get Ward Undead at<br/>\n8th I would say Necromancers would be totally screwed.  But we do have it,<br/>\nand it works wonders once you get it up to a decent level.  I just don&#39;t<br/>\nlike the fact that you HAVE to hunt Undead from 8th to 12th.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI also think its only really these lower levels that REALLY suck,<br/>\nbecause after that you should be grouping up anyway and your new circle<br/>\nspells are never TWO circles out of date from then on.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t7th to 8th is the hardest by far due to many things, mostly being<br/>\nlack of decent soloing monsters or security as well as underpowered spells.<br/>\nI would say 8th to 12th is the most boring because its always camping at the<br/>\nskeleton rune or going to Befallen/Unrest for days on end.  Again, without<br/>\nWard Undead, 8th to 12th would probably have been the point where I gave up<br/>\non being a Necromancer and became something else.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAfter that you&#39;ll start fidgeting whenever you hit that level before<br/>\nyour new spells, but it will never be as bad as those first several levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nMalark Zaren&#39;Tul, Karana<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Renaissance Man [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cossettb@...\">cossettb@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, April 29, 1999 12:19 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: EQ Necro<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [EQ_Necromancer] Seventh Level Itch<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Renaissance Man&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cossettb@...\">cossettb@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This is a question for experienced folks, and some advice for newbies.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 7th level as a Necro to date was the most frustrating level <br/>\n&gt; for me (Dark<br/>\n&gt; Elf, not sure if that makes a difference). Probably the main <br/>\n&gt; reason is that<br/>\n&gt; a lot of the creatures you used to fight for good EXP now <br/>\n&gt; /con green to you.<br/>\n&gt; Almost all large spiders, quite a few shadow wolfs, and a <br/>\n&gt; number of bears<br/>\n&gt; /con green and don&#39;t give you any EXP when you kill them. <br/>\n&gt; This leaves skels<br/>\n&gt; and tree snakes (Nek Forest) as the only reliable EXP you can <br/>\n&gt; find. To top<br/>\n&gt; it off, since you&#39;re maxed out in spells and armor at this point, you<br/>\n&gt; usually don&#39;t have much reason to kill except to gain EXP to <br/>\n&gt; level up, which<br/>\n&gt; just makes it more monotonous. So, any newbie players to the Monks, be<br/>\n&gt; warned that the 7th level will make you want to quit the <br/>\n&gt; class (It almost<br/>\n&gt; did me), if you can tough it out 8th level has some nice benefits.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The question for experienced players is: is this common for <br/>\n&gt; anylevel before<br/>\n&gt; a new spell rank? I.E. does level 11, 15, etc. seem to take <br/>\n&gt; forever? Or is<br/>\n&gt; it just level 7?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Brad Cossette - <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cossettb@...\">cossettb@...</a><br/>\n&gt; Sabbaoth (Dark Elf Necro 8) - Bertoxxulous<br/>\n&gt; &quot;My advice to you is to get married.
