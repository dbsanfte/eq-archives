All you need to cast to kill it is your DD spell twice.  The<br/>\n only thing is, they like to knock you back with their spells, effectively<br/>\n interupting your spell.

The only real<br/>\n danger is if they concentrate on one.  They have pretty hefty DD spells, and<br/>\n the Lords love to charm (resisted 3 of them while my pet beat them down).<br/>\n <br/>\n Tykken<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">  ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n From: &quot;Barry Senowitz&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:BarryS@...\">BarryS@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n Sent: Thursday, December 02, 1999 9:18 AM<br/>\n Subject: [EQ_Necromancer] level of evil eyes in runnyeye<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n &gt; From: Barry Senowitz &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:BarryS@...\">BarryS@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt; What level are the evil eyes in runnyeye?<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt; I&#39;m 34th and have the 34th pet and one took me out REALLY quick; what<br/>\n spells<br/>\n &gt; do these guys cast, I saw something about my skin igniting. &gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
