I hunted<br/>\nthem for a few hours killing at least 50 in nek last night and got a few<br/>\nscythe drops and the shadowmen item for the boots (only one though, luckily<br/>\nthe other nec i was with already had the boots).  They did drop quite a few<br/>\nshining gems and some enchanter quest stuff, but as you can see, very rare<br/>\nfor other nec stuff.  Does each zone spawn drop the items more frequently<br/>\nlike the camp in commons drop the componant for the robe and the ones in<br/>\ninnoth drop the componants for the gloves?<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
