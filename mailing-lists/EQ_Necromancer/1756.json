If it work the way I am thinking you should get<br/>\nback 5hps for 10 ticks.  I could be wrong on this, haven&#39;t hit 20 yet with<br/>\nmy necro, just hypothesising.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;- Siphon Strength will now stack with strength buffs and debuffs<br/>\n </span></blockquote>you can now get str spell cast on you and siphon str will give you even<br/>\nmore str.  As for Debuffs, it used to be that if you used impart Str and<br/>\ngave str to someone else, pet or person, you could then siphon str from a<br/>\nmob and you would negate the penalities of impart str as well as gain the<br/>\nadded str above your normal str.  Which was kind of a bug, because now you<br/>\nhave more str than you started with and so does the person you imparted str<br/>\ntoo.<br/>\nNow, both spells stack correctly, If you impart Str to something, and then<br/>\nsiphon you will have your starting str.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;- Panic the Dead cast and recast delays have been reduced. In &gt;&gt;addition, <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;the spell is less resistable.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Self explanatory.  Now just need to see if it actually works any better.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLomack, Knight Defender of the BCK<br/>\nMaster of Recruiting<br/>\nwww.bck.org<br/>\n&quot;The Crimson Knights&quot;<br/>\nFennin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
