With Ward you should be<br/>\nable to handle everyone but Lrodd on the first floor as long as you stay<br/>\nwary of trains from the lower floors.  Tagteam Lrodd with some other<br/>\nbuddies, but by level 10 you should be able to take him down yourself.  I<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t suggest going down to till level 12 AND WITH a group of<br/>\nlike-leveled people.  Trains are a constant threat down there... either<br/>\npeople going too deep for their own good in level 2, or the high-leveled<br/>\nfreaks (16-20) biting off more than they can chew on level 3 and running<br/>\nupstairs.  <br/>\n\tAfter a bit you&#39;ll figure out the &quot;train tracks&quot; and its fairly easy<br/>\nto stay away from them.  Things to remember:<br/>\n<br/>\nA) Ghouls have an absurd agg range.  Basically if you are in the same room,<br/>\nthey&#39;ll be back for you.  If I see a ghoul blow past chasing someone heading<br/>\nfor the exit I&#39;ll be right behind it till the exit, then I&#39;ll sick my<br/>\nskeleton on it, time the attacks, then run past while its recharging.  If<br/>\nyou happen to be in a room and you see it through a doorway you should be<br/>\nfine.  NEVER REST ON THE TRAIN TRACKS, go into a room or dead-end, never in<br/>\nthe main foyer or the train tracks... you&#39;re just asking for a whupping.<br/>\n<br/>\nB) Pets act WEIRD in dungeons.  Apparently there&#39;s either not enough room or<br/>\nthey are constantly jostling for position or something, but your pet WILL be<br/>\nconstantly moving, sometimes they will move as far as 50 feet away and run<br/>\nback to you.  REMEMBER THIS:  ALWAYS keep track of your pet.  If you don&#39;t<br/>\nsee it its probably a couple rooms back trying to get to you.  If you see<br/>\nthat:<br/>\n<br/>\nTaunting Attacker Master<br/>\nTaunting Attacker Master<br/>\n...<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThis is usually my cue to leave Befallen posthaste.  This means your<br/>\nskeleton was trying to get to you, and ran into opposition.  On the lower<br/>\nlevels (2 and 3) the undead are packed like sardines, so usually pissing off<br/>\none will piss all within a one room radius off too.  Do what I used to do<br/>\nand leave Befallen immediately.<br/>\n\tOther stupid things they will do:<br/>\n1) Open doors and walk through them for you, often bringing back everything<br/>\nin the next room.<br/>\n2) Walk back a ways and bring back any respawns to you.<br/>\n3) NOT be there when you do attack because they are tooling around two rooms<br/>\nbehind you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tIts not pretty but don&#39;t worry, once you get the hang of it, its<br/>\nfairly easy to keep track of it.  You can often use the &quot;/pet sit down&quot; and<br/>\n&quot;/pet guard here&quot; to keep them tied in one place for a bit... just don&#39;t<br/>\nforget to &quot;/pet as you were&quot; when you get ready to leave, which I often<br/>\ninvariably do.<br/>\n<br/>\nMalark Zaren&#39;Tul, Karana Server<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Jason Kean [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jk211495@...\">jk211495@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, April 22, 1999 5:19 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [EQ_Necromancer] Re: [[EQ_Necromancer] Re: queynos and gate]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Jason Kean&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jk211495@...\">jk211495@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m a human necro, and i&#39;ve just gotten ward undead and <br/>\n&gt; realized just how<br/>\n&gt; neat it is compared to my previous blasting spells, and was <br/>\n&gt; wondering if<br/>\n&gt; anyone knew of any neat undead infested spots near queynos <br/>\n&gt; for a level 8<br/>\n&gt; necro, and how to get to them?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; Show mom you love her.
