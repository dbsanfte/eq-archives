Why? Because<br/>\nyou&#39;re not just getting the standard hp+ac and symbol buffs, you&#39;re<br/>\ngetting multiple resist buffs, clarities, etc.  All of this takes<br/>\ntons of time since everyone wants to be full mana when the fight<br/>\nstarts.<br/>\n<br/>\nIdeally the pure casters will get buffed in hit points too. It just<br/>\nvaries from raid to raid.  I was just trying to spread an idea of<br/>\nhow much damage those AoE&#39;s do ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; No he is write you always give buffs to everybody going on dragon raids or<br/>\n&gt; Plane Raids, at least that&#39;s my experience. At level 50 my DE Necro has 824<br/>\n&gt; hp unfbuffed with equipment on. I can get that upt to 980 or so by myself.<br/>\n&gt; If you get a cleric in your group I get up to 1500 easy. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
