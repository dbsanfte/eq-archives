Personally, I REALLY like it.<br/>\nI will be honest and say that I&#39;m not really fond of the dungeons that<br/>\noriginally came with DAoC. They were weak at best. However, the new dungeons<br/>\nin the expansion are much better and much more EQ like. I always felt that<br/>\nEQ&#39;s dungeons were fairly well designed and they only got better with the<br/>\nexpansions.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith that said, the main attraction for me is the Realm vs. Realm combat.<br/>\nTaking keeps and jacking relics is a total blast!  I have noticed that my<br/>\nfriends that have tried DAoC have started on what we call the &quot;Co-op&quot;<br/>\nserver. Basically, these are like EQ style servers and are PvE only...pretty<br/>\nboring if you ask me.  Give a regular server a chance and I think you will<br/>\nlike the way RvR is done. You won&#39;t have someone in your home town gank you<br/>\nor people from other realms raiding newbie areas. Its just not setup that<br/>\nway.  If you play on a PvP server its a different story.<br/>\n<br/>\nRvR in my book is just awesome.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have any questions please feel free to ask. I will be glad to help<br/>\nyou out as much as I can. DAoC isnt perfect by any stretch, but it really<br/>\nsuits me and my play style.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Oskar<br/>\n44th Level Hibernian Bard Extrordinare<br/>\nGathering of Ancients<br/>\nPalomides<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Stuart Thomson&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Stuart@...\">Stuart@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@yahoogroups.com\">EQ_Necromancer@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, February 19, 2003 5:13 AM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [EQ_Necromancer] just joined<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Anyone know if Dark age of Camelot is any good?
