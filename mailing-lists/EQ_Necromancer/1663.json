I had different experiences with Spectres.  I solo&#39;d the one on the<br/>\n&gt;hill in Feerott at 32nd level quite easily.  The only problem is finding it<br/>\n&gt;uncamped. If you&#39;re lucky, a group of high levels might be there pulling the<br/>\n&gt;cave and all.  While this sounds like an unfortunate situation, I was able<br/>\n&gt;to convince them to let me have the lone hill spawn a few times (since they<br/>\n&gt;had the entire cave).  As for strategy, I think Spectres are one of the most<br/>\n&gt;susceptible mobs in the game to Darkness... which makes them totally pud.  I<br/>\n&gt;didn&#39;t use my pet, but it was also before the kiting patch.  I suppose a<br/>\n&gt;darkness + fear + pet would work pretty well.  I found that they didn&#39;t root<br/>\n&gt;very well, tho.  Especially with the undead root.. so beware of that.  Oh..<br/>\n&gt;another tip.. if you do root with the undead root, sometimes you can&#39;t use<br/>\n&gt;the other normal root right afterwards (it says &#39;Your spell did not take<br/>\n&gt;hold&#39;).  I think it is some kind of bug with the undead one.. thinking that<br/>\n&gt;the mob is still rooted with a higher level root (since that one is a 16th<br/>\n&gt;level including damage and the other one is a 4th level wizzie root).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;James<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt;From: Dave Karpman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:davek@...\">davek@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sent: Wednesday, December 22, 1999 12:55 PM<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [EQ_Necromancer] Got to 34<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Dave Karpman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:davek@...\">davek@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I would not solo specs until you are at least 2 shades of blue over them.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; They are mean critters, and if your first darkness/fear spell does not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; stick, you may not get another chance.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; You are far better off soloing Vhalen at the well in SK.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;This list is basically unmoderated.
