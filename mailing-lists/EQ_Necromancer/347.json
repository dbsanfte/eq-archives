I do know they get some pretty nifty illusion<br/>\nspells.  I&#39;ve see one as a (very big) tree, and one as a wolf.  If anything<br/>\nelse, that&#39;s pretty darn cool.<br/>\n<br/>\n            &#39;Course, if we ever make it up there, we get to turn into a<br/>\nskeleton.  Gee, I bet the guards _really_ love us then. :-)  Actually, I<br/>\nwont be surprised to see my Charisma drop down to 1 upon casting that spell,<br/>\nbut boy am I going to have fun drompting about the world in the form of a<br/>\nskeleton.<br/>\n<br/>\n        That brings something else up, too.  Does anybody know if we _ever_<br/>\nget to summon anything besides a  plain&#39;ol boring looking yellow skeleton?<br/>\nI mean, they have skins for Zombies, Ghouls, and differant sized skeletons<br/>\nthat I&#39;ve seen thus far, and I&#39;ve seen more than one skin for a Zombie.  Why<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t they make the Necromancer spells summon a differant undead?  Sure,<br/>\nmaybe not a Ghoul -- at least not until almost or at level 50 -- but<br/>\nsomething else other than a skel, please!  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n        Maybe if we used differant spell components.  After all, the<br/>\nelemental pets for the Magi all look differant, and all have their own<br/>\nreagents.  Then again, each has its own spell, too.  *big sigh*<br/>\n<br/>\n        I dunno.  Maybe in some future update. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n~Mysk<br/>\n<br/>\n        P.S.  The Necro in the Qeynos guild _does_ say that he turned Drosco<br/>\ninto a zombie to roam the sewers...... who knows, maybe at a higher level,<br/>\nor one we research....or maybe not.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: Juan Custer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JuanC@...\">JuanC@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What exactly is it with Druids?
