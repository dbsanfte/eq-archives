At","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1266241691\">I&#39;m level 30, I started my reign of terror in the Qeynos Hills off and on at<br/>\nabout level 26, killing Holly, and the Millers and the 2 guards by Surefall.<br/>\nAt level 29 I could take Cros Treewind about half the time, I can take him 2<br/>\nout of 3 now, still not worth the risk though :)  Those damn Druid DD spells<br/>\n*hurt* I&#39;m just thankful that I have these mobs to kill while I wait on<br/>\nVarsoon, I pity the goodly races that have to sit in this zone doing<br/>\n*nothing* while they wait on his daily spawn.  Some things to watch out for<br/>\nif you plan on doing this.  Guards Nash and Leopold wander, and are still<br/>\nred to me (does anyone know what level they are?) And Cros and Holly have<br/>\nthis obscene tendency to cross paths while I&#39;m fighting the other one. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a seperate note, big thanks to those who recommended I pursue Vampiric<br/>\nCurse, this spell just plain *rocks* I was able to separate the Millers<br/>\nspawns and keep taking them one at a time by alternating between allure of<br/>\ndeath and vampiric curse.  These 2 are about level 25 or 6 and spawn every 5<br/>\nminutes, a veritable xp fountain for evil races.  PLUS, Verant finally fixed<br/>\nit so you only receive KaranasResidents Faction hits for killing them,<br/>\nrather than Qeynos guards (the 2 of them are poachers and are hated by the<br/>\nsurefall residents, it didn&#39;t make sense to lose faction from the<br/>\nsurrounding area by killing so called villains)  They both drop Bronze<br/>\nweapons, great roleplaying fodder.  I tend to give them away to the first<br/>\nlevel 5 or below that runs up and shouts &quot;HAIL THE PRINCE OF HATE&quot; or some<br/>\nsuch evil nastiness. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Jon Fiedler &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fiedler@...\">fiedler@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, July 29, 1999 9:52 AM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [EQ_Necromancer] terrible terrible bug with pets :( (DOT bug<br/>\nnot pet?)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Jon Fiedler&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fiedler@...\">fiedler@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; BTW, what level are you?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I would love to terrorize the goody goody NPCs in Qeynos Hills...
