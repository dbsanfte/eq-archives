I have some strategies for necro<br/>\nagainst caster, but how do you fight a warrior? The<br/>\nnecro could not get any of his spells of as the<br/>\nwarrior bashed/kicked/slashed him to death. The fight<br/>\ntook a while as the necro ran around without much<br/>\neffect. End result, one dead necro, ogre at half<br/>\nhealth. They only thing I could think of was sic pet,<br/>\nshadow step, cast darkness, then proceed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I have two questions:<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat strategy do you all use for necro vs warrior<br/>\ntype?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat strategy do you all use for necro vs caster type?<br/>\n<br/>\nI am really curious to see what everyone says to this.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkmoon Somberlight<br/>\n24th level necromancer Quellious<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n=====</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
