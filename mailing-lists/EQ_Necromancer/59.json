Make sure you have Bone<br/>\nWalk before you go there, too.<br/>\n<br/>\n        Just leave Qeynos, go up where you zone into the hills, and follow<br/>\nthe _right_ wall of the zone.  You&#39;ll come to a big open mouth cave.  That&#39;s<br/>\nBlack Burrow.  Go past it a little ways.  The ruins are up to your right.<br/>\nBe careful of the Putrids as you&#39;ll get hurt pretty badly probably, and the<br/>\nDread Corps will probably kill you.  Don&#39;t let &#39;em team up on ya, for sure.<br/>\nOh, an Varsoon wont attack you unless you attack a skelly around him, or<br/>\ntalk to him.  In which case you&#39;re a gonner. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n~Myskyra / Tunare<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Jason Kean &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jk211495@...\">jk211495@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, April 22, 1999 5:19 PM<br/>\nSubject: [EQ_Necromancer] Re: [[EQ_Necromancer] Re: queynos and gate]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Jason Kean&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jk211495@...\">jk211495@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m a human necro, and i&#39;ve just gotten ward undead and realized just how<br/>\n&gt; neat it is compared to my previous blasting spells, and was wondering if<br/>\n&gt; anyone knew of any neat undead infested spots near queynos for a level 8<br/>\n&gt; necro, and how to get to them?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Show mom you love her.
