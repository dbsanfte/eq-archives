Whenever you hit there is a slim chance<br/>\nthat you will automatically LifeDrain the victim.  This happens whether you<br/>\nare equipped with a weapon or not.  In reality this is obviously more useful<br/>\nto the shadowknights as they attack a LOT more than Necromancers (and<br/>\nbelieve me, if you are fighting monsters solo above level 16 with yourself<br/>\nas a primary fighter, you are thinking the WRONG way).  Its results are<br/>\nvariable but I suggest attacking with a dagger to maximize the number of<br/>\ntimes you attack (ie get more chances to use Vamp Embrace).<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically I don&#39;t really use this at all.  At my level getting in there in<br/>\nmelee is rare (except to save my skel so it can get more hits in, I seem to<br/>\ndo that a LOT nowadays) and usually quite fatal.  Think your pet will save<br/>\nyou?  Obviously you haven&#39;t tried fighting the smarter NPCs.  Head to Lake<br/>\nRathetear and fight some Aviak Guards if you don&#39;t believe me.  I cast like<br/>\nonce and they frenzy on me, and that&#39;s after I&#39;ve let one beat on my pet<br/>\ntill its half dead.  Then its time to jump into the water and use my<br/>\nsuperior swimming skills (in the 90s woohoo!) to get away.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso if you group with a Bard a lot I highly suggest using Dark Pact or<br/>\nAllure of Death, its QUITE nice.  Good bards can keep up with AoD&#39;s HP loss<br/>\nrather easily and the mana regen is EXCELLENT.<br/>\n<br/>\nMalark on Karana<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Sebastien Pinsonnault [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:seeker66@...\">seeker66@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, May 17, 1999 8:16 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [EQ_Necromancer] Question about the Vampiric Embrace Spell<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Sebastien Pinsonnault&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:seeker66@...\">seeker66@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hello all,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am a proud level 10 Gnome Necro in Freeport and I have a <br/>\n&gt; question about<br/>\n&gt; one spell. Does anyone know how to correctly use the Vampiric <br/>\n&gt; Embrace spell?<br/>\n&gt; I mean I thought it was like lifetap or lifespike (where you <br/>\n&gt; target your<br/>\n&gt; opponent and you steal his HP) but with this spell when I <br/>\n&gt; target a monster,<br/>\n&gt; I see I hand icon appear on my display and nothing else <br/>\n&gt; happens. Now I have<br/>\n&gt; tried to attack a creature and sometimes when the thing dies <br/>\n&gt; I get some HP&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; back but not all the time....<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Do I have to be bare handed for it to work or is there <br/>\n&gt; something I am doing<br/>\n&gt; wrong?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Any help with this spell would be appreciated.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; thanks in advance.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Cilten<br/>\n&gt; Level 10 Gnome Necromancer<br/>\n&gt; Cazic-Thule Server<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; Looking for a new hobby?
