It<br/>\n&gt;is very easy to get our dots stuck to them.  You would have a problem using<br/>\n&gt;a dd at 32nd level, but, you won&#39;t have too much trouble with blood boil,<br/>\n&gt;engulfing darkness, vamp curse, repeat.  Doesn&#39;t everyone else go around<br/>\n&gt;trying to see what red mob they can still kill?  :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;James<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Dave Karpman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:davek@...\">davek@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The specs can go as high as lvl. 37, so I can only guess that the <br/>\n&gt;feerott<br/>\n&gt; &gt; specs were not as high a level when you were soloing them.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Otherwise, I can&#39;t imagine how you could get any spells to stick on a <br/>\n&gt;mob<br/>\n&gt;5<br/>\n&gt; &gt; levels above yourself.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;This list is basically unmoderated.
