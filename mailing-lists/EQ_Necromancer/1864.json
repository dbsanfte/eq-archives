That said:  I have been playing EQ for several months now, but have<br/>\n&gt; never turned the &quot;Mipmapping&quot; feature on (although my clip plan is set all<br/>\n&gt; the way out).  I&#39;ve always hesitated, because I don&#39;t know much about<br/>\nvideo<br/>\n&gt; cards, and it says that it would have to restart in Glide mode (which I<br/>\nhave<br/>\n&gt; no idea what that means).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; With my video card, would I benefit from turning that option on?  If so,<br/>\n&gt; why?  What the heck is mipmapping and what the heck is Glide mode?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sorry for the flood of questions, but I&#39;m a real hardware newbie.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks in advance for your help,<br/>\n&gt; Mujahid  17 Necro  Sol Ro<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This list is basically unmoderated.
