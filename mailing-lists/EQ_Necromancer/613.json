I personally am<br/>\n&gt;the type of person that would rather know where to go and how-to do things<br/>\n&gt;rather then taking months to figure it all out myself. This is mostly<br/>\n&gt;because I&#39;m busy in my RL with work, marriage etc, etc ... Thus, for me,<br/>\n&gt;just keeping up in levels near my friends is hard enough, much less running<br/>\n&gt;around everywhere trying to find everything myself.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;There are a few things I find lacking in the main stream web sites info.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;A. The spell lists are out dated and don&#39;t provide the info I want. IE they<br/>\n&gt;don&#39;t say this spell does this damage for this manna, here is the ratio. It<br/>\n&gt;takes this many secs to cast with the channeling skill maxed for the level<br/>\n&gt;you first receive the spell. The necro DOT does X damage a tick for X <br/>\n&gt;ticks.<br/>\n&gt;I would find that kind of extra statistics helpful.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;B. Where do you buy the darn spell? No site I have found is attempting to<br/>\n&gt;keep a list of vendor locations and their inventory and pricing for some<br/>\n&gt;base charisma.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;C. The above info should be integrated to include if each spell is research<br/>\n&gt;only or not. The status of research for that spell. IE broken or not. And <br/>\n&gt;if<br/>\n&gt;not broken what are the components to make the spell, what book and what<br/>\n&gt;lang etc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;IE a site that says for the magician or necro or X class that it deals <br/>\n&gt;with,<br/>\n&gt;here is the spells you can get, here is what they do, here is what level <br/>\n&gt;you<br/>\n&gt;will get them, here is where to find them or how to make them or both. IE<br/>\n&gt;one stop shopping for info on a spell.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Since I have not seen such a site, I am thinking of making one. Since my 2<br/>\n&gt;major chars are a dark elf and gnome I can get into almost every town with<br/>\n&gt;one of them. But before I mess with making a site, I want to see if anyone<br/>\n&gt;besides me would even care, if no-one cares, then I will just continue to<br/>\n&gt;keep my own private notes. Also, If I take the time to do this, I would <br/>\n&gt;like<br/>\n&gt;to hear if any of you could help me gather the necessary information. IE go<br/>\n&gt;to diff vendors, record their inventory and pricing and send it in to me <br/>\n&gt;for<br/>\n&gt;the site?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sincerely,<br/>\n&gt;Veneficus (Rank 5) gnome magician<br/>\n&gt;Eloric (Rank 3) DE Necromancer<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;....
