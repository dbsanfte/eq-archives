I guess because it&#39;s fire based (?). My best DOT and I can&#39;t <br/>\n&gt;use<br/>\n&gt;it.. So I have to stick with Engulfing Darkness (resisted 50% of the time) <br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;Poison Bolt (resisted 20% of the time). Also started using Vampiric Embrace<br/>\n&gt;because I&#39;m always getting into melee, but I have only seen it go off once <br/>\n&gt;in<br/>\n&gt;like 20 battles. Finally bought Lifedraw too (now that I&#39;m making money) <br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;what a great spell over the lower one. 41pts of damage makes a big <br/>\n&gt;difference<br/>\n&gt;in this zone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Check out this week&#39;s ONElist of the week.<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;How is ONElist changing YOUR life?
