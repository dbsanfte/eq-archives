It is the fact taht there is layers of<br/>\ntrees.  i.e.  tree behind tree behind tree, etc.  that<br/>\nis why the clipping adjustment can help.  The older<br/>\nzones simply didn&#39;t have the detail or depth that<br/>\nkunark has.  Just thinking 3 dimensionally, the trees<br/>\nwould have be redrawn as you move around regardless,<br/>\nsince if the tree&#39;s aren&#39;t moving, you are, and<br/>\ntherefore their position is changing.  Maybe someone<br/>\ncan clarify.  However I have the voodoo 3000 and i get<br/>\nbad lag too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It doesnt.  I have a Vodoo3000, and I feel like I<br/>\n&gt; lag in Kunark more then<br/>\n&gt; anybody.  I think a GOOD part of the issue with lag<br/>\n&gt; and frame rates<br/>\n&gt; there....the damn trees move....all the time.  That<br/>\n&gt; has to wreak hell on the<br/>\n&gt; graphics end of a system.  If not, well, why do we<br/>\n&gt; need to see the leaves<br/>\n&gt; blowing in the breeze...??<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>=====<br/>\nThe more you know, <br/>\nThe more you know how much you don&#39;t know!<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nSend instant messages & get email alerts with Yahoo!
