Furthermore, supposedly there are also<br/>\ncertain combinations that give experience bonuses. The example that was suggested was a<br/>\ndark elven necromancer. Apparently, the rumor that DE necros get an exp bonus (any and<br/>\nall times exp is gained) has been confirmed by at least one GM.<br/>\nThis, is what I have read and heard from fellow players.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEnigma wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Enigma &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:enigma@...\">enigma@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Bonuses on WHAT, I know clerics get them for undead, also when fighting<br/>\n&gt; undead I seem to go up faster too.
