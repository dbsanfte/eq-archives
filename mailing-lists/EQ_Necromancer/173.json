Basically one practice point does NOT equal one skill point, it<br/>\nequals many.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat should you use your points in?  I would save about half for the magical<br/>\nday when Specialization becomes a reality.  And dump the other half in one<br/>\nlanguage, find a buddy who will dumpe their&#39;s in a different language...<br/>\nthen spam each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther than that it works just like any other trade.  You get components and<br/>\nCOMBINE them in a container, called a Lexicon or or Grimoire or something...<br/>\nthey don&#39;t sell most of our components in stores, they must be taken from<br/>\nNPC spellcasters or inherently magic creatures.  There are also LEVELS of<br/>\ncontainers.  Like the first book costs like a platinum piece and has four<br/>\nslots, but a greater book has six slots and costs ten platinum (or<br/>\nsomething).  Generally each spell has its own recipe.  Necromancers I<br/>\nbelieve use a book called... uh... crap I lost it (I&#39;m pretty sure it had<br/>\nthe word &quot;Diablerie&quot; in somewhere), basically in the guild there&#39;s a lady in<br/>\nthe back that sells all the common components and she has our book of<br/>\nResearch.<br/>\n<br/>\ndoes it work?  Yes, is it hard?  YES.  Make sure your Research is maxxed out<br/>\nand the spell you are making is not above your level, because losing spell<br/>\ncomponents to failures REALLY sucks.<br/>\n<br/>\nMalark, Karana<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Dave Ellis [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:everquest@...\">everquest@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, May 03, 1999 1:58 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [EQ_Necromancer] Was Spell Search, Now Research<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Dave Ellis&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:everquest@...\">everquest@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks to all who answered my questions about where to find <br/>\n&gt; spells. I now<br/>\n&gt; have everyhting I need after shopping in Freeport. I was not <br/>\n&gt; able to find<br/>\n&gt; Banshee Aura. I am told this is a spell that must be researched.<br/>\n&gt; I have some questions about research.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I made level 16 and went to my guild. I was only able to <br/>\n&gt; train one point<br/>\n&gt; into research. Is this normal? If so, why do I have 50 <br/>\n&gt; practice points saved<br/>\n&gt; up.... Nevertheless, I do have some questions. How do I <br/>\n&gt; research? I think<br/>\n&gt; there is a book I&#39;m supposed to buy, but don&#39;t know the <br/>\n&gt; title. Will it tell<br/>\n&gt; me how to research spells? Is research like smithing where I will be<br/>\n&gt; combining things in attempts to get a success? Does each spell have a<br/>\n&gt; separate &quot;recipe&quot; or do I just combine the same things and <br/>\n&gt; see what happens?<br/>\n&gt; And lastly, I saw a whole bunch of books for sale which I suspect are<br/>\n&gt; related to research, With titles like Calling Forth the <br/>\n&gt; Darkness. How do I<br/>\n&gt; know these books are for necromancers or not? Any help would be great.<br/>\n&gt; Thanks....<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Dave<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nmajsa@...\">nmajsa@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, May 03, 1999 12:13 PM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [EQ_Necromancer] Re: Spell Search<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nmajsa@...\">nmajsa@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;If anyone knows where these spells can be found, please <br/>\n&gt; let me know.
