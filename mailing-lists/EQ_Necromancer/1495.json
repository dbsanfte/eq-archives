I have finally made 21st level.  I made most the exp from 20 out in Oasis killing DW but the exp is getting a bit thin.  I was wondering if anyone can give me a good idea on where to solo w/pet at 21 and get good exp (yes, I would like to powerlevel to 24).  I know all the obvious spots like Treants and Aviak Tower in SK, but I am looking for someplace not so camped.  Any help would be appreciated.  Thanks in advance.<br/>\n<br/>\nBranil Myrlochar<br/>\n21st Circle DE Necro<br/>\nReflections of Power<br/>\nQuellious</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
