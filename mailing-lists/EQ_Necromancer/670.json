I currently don&#39;t keep shielding and grim aura memorized,<br/>\n&gt;rather I cast and delete them, then repeat later when they wear off.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;When I&#39;m in a large group that is killing fast, I tend to use the low mana<br/>\n&gt;spells like siphon str and disease so I can do this to all MOBS. I like to<br/>\n&gt;keep gate memorized for emergencies, my best life suck spell, my ward<br/>\n&gt;undead, and my best darkness spell as it slows the MOBs down if they are<br/>\n&gt;fleeing or if I need to flee. I also find dark empathy handy to emergency<br/>\n&gt;heal passerby&#39;s that are dying. I make a lot of friends that way. I also<br/>\n&gt;find mend bones quite handy esp when I&#39;m soloing or in a group of 2 where<br/>\n&gt;the other person is a wizard or other spell type. I also like the vampiric<br/>\n&gt;embrace as I can tank at the beginning of a fight longer, back out and life<br/>\n&gt;drain, then tank again. That extra 25 tap 2 or 3 times some fights has made<br/>\n&gt;a big difference a few times.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So I have at lev 14 something like this memorized.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;1)Best Life Drain<br/>\n&gt;2)Vampiric Embrace<br/>\n&gt;3)Englufing Darkness<br/>\n&gt;4)Heat Blood (or if in lavastorm or big group Disease)<br/>\n&gt;5)Dark Empathy<br/>\n&gt;6)Mend Bones (or if in group with tanks siphon str or posion bolt)<br/>\n&gt;7)Gate<br/>\n&gt;8)Ward Undead<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I wish I had slots for fear and shadow step but I don&#39;t usually.<br/>\n&gt;At lev 16 I see a lot of new neat spells. A new DOT. Feign Death. A spell <br/>\n&gt;to<br/>\n&gt;make you immune to damage for a short time ect. I am at a loss as to how to<br/>\n&gt;fit all the fun spells in. I&#39;m happy in the sence there are so many cool<br/>\n&gt;spells I can sorta mix and match for the situation but its much more<br/>\n&gt;difficult living with 8 spells at a time then when I play my lev 17<br/>\n&gt;magician. I can mem and forget all my summon spells. My combat ones are<br/>\n&gt;always less then 8. IE DD, AE, Gate, Damage Shield and I&#39;m about done with<br/>\n&gt;important spells.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I was wanting advice from higher lev necromancers about what spells they<br/>\n&gt;tend to load and for what situations. Esp for the lev 16 and the 20th<br/>\n&gt;spells.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sincerely,<br/>\n&gt;Eloric Rank 4 Necomancer<br/>\n&gt;Veneficus Rank 5 Magician<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Humble Knight - MoltenLava - Mithannial Marr<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;....
