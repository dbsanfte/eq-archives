Can an L28 and a<br/>\n  L25 take the 4 together?<br/>\n  Can we pull one at a time?   Thanks<br/>\n<br/>\n  When you zone in from EC, head northwest, the /loc I *think* is<br/>\n  around -1600,500 or thereabouts.  They&#39;re down in a bit of a valley by a<br/>\n  monolith structure.  I highly doubt that a L28 and L25 could clear that<br/>\n  spawn...I was soloing it for a while, basically target the highest /con send<br/>\n  my pet and dot the heck out of him...wait for him to die then gate,<br/>\n  hopefully before the other 3 finish the pet and come after me.  I was<br/>\n  successful twice, died once, called for help :)  With a L35 nec, L35 warrior<br/>\n  and L35 rogue, we cleared the spawn and all had about 2 bubbles of health<br/>\n  remaining.  These guys are *tough* and way undercon&#39;d  Best to get a full<br/>\n  group, with at least one primary healer, preferably 2, shaman buffs are nice<br/>\n  too. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n  This list is basically unmoderated.
