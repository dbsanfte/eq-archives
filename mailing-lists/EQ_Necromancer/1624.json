Basically the mob would be ST&#39;ed and stand there<br/>\ntil it was damaged.  Well you cast Darkness on it, if is sticks mob free<br/>\nstart kiting.  If it is resisted no damage done to mob, mob still under ST.<br/>\nCast Darkness again, if sticks start kiting (since it slowed) if resisted no<br/>\ndamage to mob, mob still under ST.  Basically what he was saying was that<br/>\nwith Screaming Terror you can kite a lot easier since you can usually get up<br/>\nto 4 casts of darkness (since the resist rate is so bad on that line) before<br/>\nthe mob will start coming for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 04:34 PM 12/8/99 EST, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:TkAdam@...\">TkAdam@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;In a message dated 12/8/99 3:01:53 PM Eastern Standard Time, <br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dicey@...\">dicey@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I have read<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  that most seem to get 2-4 DoT&#39;s before it breaks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Just remember that this time you get to cast those spells is due to the stun <br/>\n&gt;effect which verant is removing.
