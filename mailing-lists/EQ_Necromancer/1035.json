I<br/>\nhave pulled both Mage and Wizard components now though. Maybe this was intentional? Or<br/>\neven more likely a possible mistake in who should get what in the programming.

Most of my friends are necro&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; in the game so we are all fighting for the same words. Or heaven for bid<br/>\n&gt; they might put words on vendors and just make the trade harder. I could live<br/>\n&gt; with that. If we could all put are heads together and do this as a group it<br/>\n&gt; could make a difference.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also I am level 33 now and not very sure what to hunt again. hehehehe I have<br/>\n&gt; been kill druids for the past few levels. Now I am at a loss. Any one out<br/>\n&gt; there have a clue at all.
