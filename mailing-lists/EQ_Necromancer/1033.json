Most of my friends are necro&#39;s<br/>\nin the game so we are all fighting for the same words. Or heaven for bid<br/>\nthey might put words on vendors and just make the trade harder. I could live<br/>\nwith that. If we could all put are heads together and do this as a group it<br/>\ncould make a difference.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso I am level 33 now and not very sure what to hunt again. hehehehe I have<br/>\nbeen kill druids for the past few levels. Now I am at a loss. Any one out<br/>\nthere have a clue at all. All I really want is my new spells.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
