He has<br/>\nmade claims that his main Character is Gathaway BaneFlare - Leader of<br/>\nthe Titan&#39;s Tribunal guild.  He makes a partial trade and says he will<br/>\nget Gath and finish the trade, then he disappears.  I can&#39;t find the 2<br/>\nnames I have written down but will post them as soon as I can get them.<br/>\nGathaway has 3 other Characters but won&#39;t trade in this way, if his<br/>\ncharacters  don&#39;t have the money on them, he&#39;d use Gath for the full<br/>\ntrade.<br/>\nBefore anyone says &quot;If you&#39;r that stupid serves you right&quot; please<br/>\nconsider some people do still trust others, in this case it cost a girl<br/>\n500pp.  Anyone who claims to represent any guild but doesn&#39;t have a<br/>\nguild tag is lying.  /who all titan  will find you some members who<br/>\naren&#39;t anon too question if U need too.<br/>\nAnyways I thought I&#39;d drop a note, Gathaway is a friend who doesn&#39;t<br/>\ncheat others, and I&#39;d like anyone else on karana who may have heard of<br/>\nthis guy to post all characters he uses so we can warn our friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nMalanni Mournblade &lt;Titan&#39;s Tribunal&gt;<br/>\nKarana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
