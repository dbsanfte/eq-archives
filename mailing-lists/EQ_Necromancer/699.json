Basically truth be told you need to learn to manage your <br/>\n&gt;spells if you guys can&#39;t balance them out at 12 or 16 you guys are really <br/>\n&gt;going to have problems at 29. You really don&#39;t need a wide variety of <br/>\n&gt;spells especially being a necromancer. All you really need are your lifetap <br/>\n&gt;line of spells and your dots and you can handle anything. Then you throw in <br/>\n&gt;some goodies like Feign death. I usually keep my shielding spells memorized <br/>\n&gt;just because I have more room. Once you hit 16 drop gate and put in feign <br/>\n&gt;death, truthfulluy I don&#39;t know why you would get invis memorized because <br/>\n&gt;once a creature has you in your targeting it doesn&#39;t matter if you go <br/>\n&gt;invis, they still can kill you.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Naeeldar 19 Necromancer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
