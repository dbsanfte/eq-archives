The best thing for you to do<br/>\nis make a trek to Freeport.  That&#39;s undead haven there, I swear.  You&#39;ve got<br/>\nnumerous little ruins outside, plus Befallen (watch out for horrible trains<br/>\n& that damn Ghoul & Ice Boned) you can put that Ward Undead to use.  Beware<br/>\nof fizzles, however.<br/>\n<br/>\n    As for around Qeynos.. eh.. Karanas is the best place.  Just kill the<br/>\ngrizzlies and spidies.  It&#39;ll take longer, but you&#39;re almost guranteed the<br/>\nexperiance from them so long as you&#39;re not double timed.  Just remember to<br/>\nsmack &#39;em with poisen, maybe Clinging Darkness and/or Fear, and leave enough<br/>\nmana for a Mend Bones or Gate. :-)  You&#39;re not going to get much more around<br/>\nQeynos.  I left the place at level 10 for Freeport, got 56 gold in three<br/>\ndays there, a greater light stone, two magical (Cut-Throat Insignia)<br/>\nrings..... and lost level 10. *grin*  Even the Orc Centurian around the<br/>\nentrance to the city of Freeport carries leggings at times, which you can<br/>\nsell for gold.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Freeport is nice, but very dangerous.  Those damn young kodiaks hate you<br/>\nand will attack you on sight.  They&#39;re pretty tough at this level,<br/>\nespecially with a giant spider or two in tow.  Both of which roam around the<br/>\nimmediate area of Freeport, one zone from the city.  Good exp, just watch<br/>\nyour back.  Also, just because a zombie /con`s blue doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s an<br/>\neasy kill.  I made it out of a fight against two of those with a sliver of<br/>\nmana and life.  Granted, I had no pet at the time, but geeze they hurt.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Ghouls and the Ice Boned Skeleton takes magical weapons & spells to hurt<br/>\nit.  Your ward undead can kill it the Ice Boned if somebody else is<br/>\ndistracting it so you can get all of them off, but not face-to-face as it<br/>\nwill stun you repeatedly.  Ward Undead on the Ghoul is a waste of mana.<br/>\nIt&#39;ll resist virtually every one of them.  Don&#39;t -- Fight -- The -- Ghoul<br/>\n:-)<br/>\n<br/>\n    Also, the desert is a great place.  The Giant Scarab Beetles are very<br/>\neasy kills -- I can sit and meditate while my skeleton beats the snot out of<br/>\nthem (just remember to poisen them & keep a watch on your skelly&#39;s life) --<br/>\nand gives okay experiance.  Zombies roam the desert, as well as skeletons.<br/>\n/con _everything_ first, especially the skeletons.  Many of them will /con<br/>\nred to you.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Good luck.  Qeynos at level 10 is incredibly boring...<br/>\n<br/>\n~Mysk<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: Sagi Shechter &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sagis@...\">sagis@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Can anyone give some recommendations about  where to go on 10th lvl, as a<br/>\n&gt; human necro in qeynos?<br/>\n&gt; For the last 3 levels i&#39;ve been in west karana, and i&#39;m looking for better<br/>\n&gt; places to hunt, as the xp and the loot i get in karana<br/>\n&gt; from the creatures i can handle there ( mostly giant spiders, giant<br/>\n&gt; beetles,lions , the occasional grizzly ) , is quite bad.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From the times i&#39;ve been to black burrow, it looks that place is just<br/>\n&gt; impossible, because of all of the people that hang around there all of the<br/>\n&gt; time, pulling train after train..<br/>\n&gt; Is there any undead hunting site near qeynos, besides the ruins in the<br/>\n&gt; hills?
