Mine die<br/>\nall the time *g*. I figure since bone chips are free, and mana is free...<br/>\nwho cares? If I get a strong pet I&#39;ll take pains to keep it around, but<br/>\notherwise I figure the pet is expendable. Magicians have to buy malochite so<br/>\nI can see being careful there.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve never tried this, but could you sic your pet on a monster, run a goodly<br/>\ndistance away, then when your pet dies summon a second one to send after the<br/>\nbeast?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Ok if you are level 6 here is a scale for you. Rank 1 is level 1<br/>\n&gt; to 4 as we<br/>\n&gt; all know. Each rank is made up of 4 levels. The first 2 levels in<br/>\n&gt; a rank you<br/>\n&gt; can take a yellow.. most times. But then the last 2 levels in a rank you<br/>\n&gt; have to be careful. Yellow&#39;s are now red for your pet. So now the third<br/>\n&gt; level in a rank a black ranking is realy yellow. then in the last<br/>\n&gt; level in a<br/>\n&gt; rank blue in some cases are realy yellow. If you dont under stand<br/>\n&gt; what I am<br/>\n&gt; saying.. Just tell me. I will  try and explan this agian. The main reason<br/>\n&gt; for this is the stenth of your pet. Most necros that have a hard time is<br/>\n&gt; because they for get to look at what they are going to fight threw there<br/>\n&gt; pets eyes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There&#39;s my 2 cents. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
