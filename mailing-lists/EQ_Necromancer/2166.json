Im 52 now, and have<br/>\nbeen getting tons of green pets lately (since next pet is 53). 2 out of the<br/>\n3 possible levels for the pets were green (last week).  Anyways, this week<br/>\ni&#39;ve yet to get a green one. I summoned 2 pets, both blue, i figured cool<br/>\nits blue its must be my big one. But my buddy is lev 54, meaning everything<br/>\ni summon should be green to him (as they were last week), decided to /con<br/>\nthem, the first one was blue to him as well, and the second one was green to<br/>\nhim (blue to me). This got us really stumped (and happy too) <br/>\n<br/>\nCould it be that:<br/>\n1. They beefed up our pets in levels?<br/>\n2. They changed the /con table?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone else notice anything?<br/>\n<br/>\n-Rakka<br/>\nSol Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
