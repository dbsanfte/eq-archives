I&#39;ve used dagger<br/>\n&gt; &gt;so far, but have tried the 1H staff and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;like the better damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Tue, 14 Mar 2000, Naeeldar wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Whatever skill the best weapon you can lay your hand on at your level is<br/>\n&gt; what you should go with.

At L1-7 or so a cracked staff is the best thing you&#39;re<br/>\ngoing to find.  But a worn great staff doesn&#39;t suck, and lets you stay<br/>\ncurrent in 2H blunt. At around L10 it&#39;s going to become important to find<br/>\na magic weapon, and on most servers a Runed Totem Staff (2H blunt) is<br/>\nlikely available for 10-15pp.  You can often get mages to summon magic<br/>\ndaggers or staves for your pet.  If you and your pet have a magic weapon,<br/>\nyou can kill wisps at L8 if you&#39;re lucky and L10 without worry.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you&#39;re not fighting magic-only critters, you&#39;ll probably want to go<br/>\nback to your cracked staff (or other 1H weapon if you&#39;ve found/bought<br/>\none), because then you can equip your stein (crude steins available free<br/>\noutside Oggok on servers with lots of guard killers) or Skull (J&#39;hen Tra<br/>\nshould be about 15pp) in your off-hand.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy L20 in a group, you&#39;d almost always rather be medding than swinging, so<br/>\nequip whatever gives you bonuses.  Soloing, you may still need to get in a<br/>\nwhack or two but it won&#39;t matter much what weapon you choose for it.<br/>\n--<br/>\nMark Rafn    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dagon@...\">dagon@...</a>    &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.dagon.net/\">http://www.dagon.net/</a>&gt;   !G </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
