It&#39;s very useful, especially for<br/>\nmeditating when you have very low Mana.  It speeds the process up<br/>\ndramatically.  Just don&#39;t let it drain your life too far.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Also, as somebody else here stated, using it for an almost constant<br/>\ncorrectly-timed LifeTaps is most amusing. :-)  But, be careful, you can also<br/>\ntick the creature off enough to where it&#39;ll frenzy you.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Mysk<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:stackers@...\">stackers@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, May 11, 1999 6:23 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ_Necromancer] Digest Number 26<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:stackers@...\">stackers@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I cannot find Dark Pact on my spell list (EQ&#39;Lizer Spell Guide).
