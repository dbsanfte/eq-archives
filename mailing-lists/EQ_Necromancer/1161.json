Trolls hate ya but they are just ready to attack so I think that if you can find some monsters that will inprove your faction with them. I find guards are the ones you always you have the lowest faction with so the merchants inside will be dubious.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Skel <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a> ; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Shaman@onelist.com\">EQ_Shaman@onelist.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, August 24, 1999 11:04 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [EQ_Necromancer] Evil Races<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  How can I become more evil??
