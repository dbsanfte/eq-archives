The skill you get as a tank<br/>\nin DAoC you get when you become that class and if you block the shot you<br/>\nblock 100% of the damage. The trick is to make sure the person you are<br/>\nblocking for stays pretty close. Something that may interest you to know is<br/>\nthat instead of always putting block on the soft target (healers, and<br/>\nsupport classes) tanks will actually put block on to the damage dealers such<br/>\nas blademasters, berserkers, and mercenaries...they also will put it on<br/>\nother classes such as rangers, druids and basically anyone else who is a<br/>\nweaker tank.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; This is also new within the last year.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Basically what you are seeing here in DAoC and EQ is one learning from the<br/>\nother. EQ is learning about skills and such as well as user interface from<br/>\nDAoC. DAoC is learning from EQ in the way of PvE content and better dungeon<br/>\ndesign.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Oskar</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
