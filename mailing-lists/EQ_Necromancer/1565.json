At 29th, I could solo them with my pet.  And close<br/>\nwithout.  They were almost always green to me, except the Lords.  They were<br/>\nbarely blue.  All you need to cast to kill it is your DD spell twice.  The<br/>\nonly thing is, they like to knock you back with their spells, effectively<br/>\ninterupting your spell.  If it was the King, then I&#39;m not sure.  Didn&#39;t see<br/>\nhim spawn while I was there.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a group of 3 I know that lvl 20&#39;s can take them out.  The only real<br/>\ndanger is if they concentrate on one.  They have pretty hefty DD spells, and<br/>\nthe Lords love to charm (resisted 3 of them while my pet beat them down).<br/>\n<br/>\nTykken<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Barry Senowitz&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:BarryS@...\">BarryS@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, December 02, 1999 9:18 AM<br/>\nSubject: [EQ_Necromancer] level of evil eyes in runnyeye<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Barry Senowitz &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:BarryS@...\">BarryS@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What level are the evil eyes in runnyeye?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m 34th and have the 34th pet and one took me out REALLY quick; what<br/>\nspells<br/>\n&gt; do these guys cast, I saw something about my skin igniting.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; This list is basically unmoderated.
