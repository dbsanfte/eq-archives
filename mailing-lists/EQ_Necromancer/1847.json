I also have<br/>\n&gt;a VooDoo3 3000 in a second PC that is great too.  If you have the cash<br/>\n&gt;though ($300)  get the new Ge-Force card that is out.  I can&#39;t remember the<br/>\n&gt;name, but it has a 400 mhz processor on the card and 32 mb of DSDRAM (runs<br/>\n&gt;at 200 mhz bus speed on the card).  You would not believe what it does for <br/>\n&gt;a<br/>\n&gt;PC.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
