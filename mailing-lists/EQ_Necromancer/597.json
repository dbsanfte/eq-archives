This is the best responce I have gotten yet!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  Here&#39;s some info:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;Guk isn&#39;t TOO bad in the beginning, but it gets harder without you knowing<br/>\n&gt;it.  You&#39;ll find a lot of the monsters in the first several area weak or<br/>\n&gt;mostly weak, but when you get there you&#39;ll realize why a lot of high levels<br/>\n&gt;don&#39;t camp this place out for all of its good equipment.  The Trains are<br/>\n&gt;REAL BAD.  That&#39;s why I recommend you bring along a shaman or a wizard or a<br/>\n&gt;druid, anyone with ROOT, and their sole existence in the group is to ROOT<br/>\n&gt;runners before they go down.  You won&#39;t have problems with the guards,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>tads,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;and shamans, and with a full group even the Tuk caste won&#39;t be too bad (ie<br/>\n&gt;Tuk Shamans, Tuk Warriors, Tuk Guards), the real problem is they have<br/>\n </span></blockquote>enough<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;hitpoints and intelligence to run while they still have quite a bit of<br/>\n&gt;health, making pets and ABSOLUTE NO NO here.

TUK froglocks won&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;stop there, they almost always go DEEP into Guk and bring back several of<br/>\n&gt;their own caste, and often times some froglock of the GAZ caste (these<br/>\n </span></blockquote>dudes<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;are VERY nasty for people around level 12).

ROOT or dogpiling runners is a MUST.  At the low teens you don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;want to be fighting more than one GAZ Warrior or shaman at once.  Clerics<br/>\n&gt;will also be very useful because most of the froglocks will be fighters.<br/>\n&gt;Optimally I&#39;d say two tanks, two ROOT enabled spellcasters, and one cleric<br/>\n&gt;at least for a party.  A group of SIX necromancers and their pets will get<br/>\n&gt;slaughtered here (read &quot;My pet is attacking something. Hey so is mine.<br/>\n&gt;Taunting?  Where?  Hey my pet just died.  OMG! RUN!!!).  Necromancers have<br/>\n&gt;some nasty DoTs, but if you have tanks leave the skels in the closet.  Also<br/>\n&gt;if you zone to Lower Guk, come back up ASAP.  Lower Guk is a level 35-50<br/>\n&gt;dungeon and most people get slaughtered there horrifically because the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>train<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;strength is just as bad as Upper Guk, only with level 35+ monsters.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Malark on Karana<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;From: James<br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Sent: 5/25/99 5:47 AM<br/>\n&gt;Subject: [EQ_Necromancer] Guk and woven<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: &quot;James&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:manickd@...\">manickd@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ok I am going to make a team to guk to get me some woven armor.
