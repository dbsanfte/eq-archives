[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MurphyK@...\">MurphyK@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, May 03, 1999 2:22 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [EQ_Necromancer] Dark Elves and Necromancer Survival Tactics?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Murphy, Kenneth E.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MurphyK@...\">MurphyK@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hello.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have recently started a dark elf necromancer and am quickly <br/>\n&gt; up to lev 5.<br/>\n&gt; The combat strategy seems fairly similar to that of my 16th <br/>\n&gt; level magician<br/>\n&gt; except there I use DD burn and with my necro I am more <br/>\n&gt; patient and use my<br/>\n&gt; DOT spells. I tank more with my necro since I can heal myself <br/>\n&gt; and go in<br/>\n&gt; again for more tanking.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; However mages get NO self defense spells or skills. I am <br/>\n&gt; wondering which<br/>\n&gt; ones are best and if you all have any tips for them.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Dark Elf Necromancers get to at some point or another.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1. Hide skill - Is this just press and pray? if something is <br/>\n&gt; charging me can<br/>\n&gt; I still HIDE from it? IE a sand giant attacks my skeleton can <br/>\n&gt; I press hide<br/>\n&gt; to try to survive?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>\tHide works like this, you become invisible but can&#39;t move.  People<br/>\nwho can see invis (undead, Deadeye, etc) can see you, but nobody else can.<br/>\nSo if you see an SG walking up to you you can hide IF YOU HAVEN&#39;T PISSED IT<br/>\nOFF.  Once a monster has locked on to you it will always know where you<br/>\nare... invis or not.  So no, HIDE will not help you if your skel picks a<br/>\nfight with an SG.  It will help you if you see someone bringing a train to<br/>\nthe dungeon exit and hitting one button is quicker than trying to get out of<br/>\nthe way.  I use it a lot when I don&#39;t have a skel on me and I want to<br/>\nmeditate, I also have it hotkeyed when trains show up or surprises appear.<br/>\nI once had a Sand Giant stand on my head for five minutes while hiding, so<br/>\ndon&#39;t worry about touch.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 2. Root - At high levels we get root. Is it resisted by <br/>\n&gt; everything by that<br/>\n&gt; high level?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>\tSort of, but not quit.  It&#39;ll still work, but probably not on yellow<br/>\nor reds.  Eventually it will stop being effective except to stop runners of<br/>\nlower level creatures.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 3. Shadow step - How good is casting this then trying for a gate?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>\tAgain, depends on where you are.  If you have a lot of room,<br/>\nprobably, I usually use it for duelling with melee types or getting some<br/>\nkind of headstart on a blood mad monster.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 4. Feign Death - Seems this could be great. Does this cast <br/>\n&gt; fast enough to<br/>\n&gt; use in an emergency? Is it dependable enough to use to save <br/>\n&gt; the party by<br/>\n&gt; taking on the monster why group flees then cast this and let the train<br/>\n&gt; dissolve? How long does it last?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>\tYes, no, as long as you want... he he... basically It casts fast and<br/>\nthe monster &quot;forgets about you&quot;... but not permanently.  Basically its like<br/>\nyou&#39;re being skpped over when it goes through its hate list.  This is KEY.<br/>\nOnce you &quot;wake up&quot;, the monster instantly knows it and starts to come back<br/>\nfor you.  This is a good idea since otherwise you could cast something on a<br/>\nmonster, Feign, cast again, Feign, a lame tactic indeed.  Make sure (3rd<br/>\nperson) that the monster is FAR away, then get up and run.  Basically it<br/>\nlasts until you decide its time to get up.  Also note that this does NOT<br/>\nwork in PvP (I think they don&#39;t get the corpse look, plus they can&#39;t loot<br/>\nyou...)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; 5. Gate - This is the only 1 of the list I&#39;m used to as <br/>\n&gt; magicians have his<br/>\n&gt; spell but it&#39;s cast time is slow.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>\tYes, slow... I don&#39;t recommend it for an escape spell unless your<br/>\nskel is healthy.  I usually just RUN, if you have a headstart and you keep<br/>\ngoing straight most things can&#39;t catch you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Are there any other survival skills I&#39;ve missed? Seems <br/>\n&gt; Necromancers may have<br/>\n&gt; an easier time of getting out of trouble then magicians do <br/>\n&gt; assuming the<br/>\n&gt; above skills/spells are nice.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Your DoT spells should be first off, always, so they get their full effect.<br/>\nDon&#39;t be afraid to step in there and take a few hits for your skel, don&#39;t<br/>\nforget to heal your skel when you DO get the spells to do so.  Uhm, keep up<br/>\non your weak skills (fighting, swimming, especially SWIMMING).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMalark, 16th, Karana<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Any help is appreciated.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Eloric<br/>\n&gt; Necromancer (Rank 2) Mythannial Marr<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; Share the wealth!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Tell a friend about ONElist&#39;s 130,000 free e-mail communities!<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; This list is basically unmoderated.
