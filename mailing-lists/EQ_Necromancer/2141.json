I had one of<br/>\nthe best times ever in EQ the other night in Hate.  We had 16 people, 5 of<br/>\nwhich were enchanters so we figured we were a bit screwed, but come to find<br/>\nout we could haul major ass with that setup.  We were pulling nonstop to the<br/>\nbig house in the middle, basically the monk would shout out &quot;4 inc&quot; etc and<br/>\nwe&#39;d just mow through them while the enchanter brigade kept things cool.  If<br/>\nyou really get rolling in hate it can be a blast, 1 or 2 hr CR times and the<br/>\nheavy duty setup definitly limits who will find it fun though.  It&#39;s a<br/>\ndifferent style of play.  The roamers there make it impossible to actually<br/>\ndungeon crawl and progress through the level.  Pulling is a necessity, or<br/>\nyou&#39;d all be dead far too quickly.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
