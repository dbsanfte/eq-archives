I always go the nro to freeport way to get<br/>\non<br/>\n&gt; boat and never have had a problem, but you can stand on the dock all day<br/>\n&gt; long and no npc will bother you. DE&#39;s have a deal with the freeport<br/>\nmilitia<br/>\n&gt; that is why we can walk freely around (for the most part).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Once you get on the boat, sister island is the first stop.  I hunted there<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; lot at your level and made quite a bit of money :)  My favorite spot to<br/>\nset<br/>\n&gt; up on the island looks like a little tear drop coming off the island where<br/>\n&gt; none of the sisters go, so I could always med or pull to this area with no<br/>\n&gt; problem.  As soon as the boat turns and is lined up the edge of the island<br/>\n&gt; on the right, I would jump off the boat and swim to this point and<br/>\ncommence<br/>\n&gt; with the slaughtering.  You are kos to the people at the dock, so stay<br/>\naway.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Vanelin Blackheart<br/>\n&gt; 34th DE Nec - Povar<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Hu Anderson [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:as4603rosand@...\">as4603rosand@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, December 13, 1999 9:24 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [EQ_Necromancer] Sister Isle..........<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Hu Anderson&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:as4603rosand@...\">as4603rosand@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am a lvl 13 DE necro and was wanting to make a trip to the Sister Ise in<br/>\n&gt; OOT.
