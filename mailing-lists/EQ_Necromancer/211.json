It had the following to say about the<br/>\nNecromancer.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. The pet gets chewed up way to fast to solo at all past 30.<br/>\n2. The DOT&#39;s that in theory are awesome to stack will only result in the MOB<br/>\nfrenzied on you and your death if you try to use those spell combinations in<br/>\na group.<br/>\n3. Even if you COULD get in your DOT&#39;s the MOBS are killed so fast by the<br/>\nWizard types that they don&#39;t take full effect.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan some Lev 30(+) necromancers give me some feedback on how they feel about<br/>\nthis class at the upper levels? I sure hope the game isn&#39;t such that<br/>\neveryone is going to wish they were a wizard or druid at high levels. I had<br/>\nheard the Necromancer was possibly the most powerful high level class in the<br/>\ngame and that this extra power was offset by being KOS in so much of<br/>\nNorrath? But based on many posts I have read I&#39;m being to wonder if all the<br/>\nsocial penalties are worth it if the class is not even in the top half of<br/>\npower at the higher levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour thoughts are welcome.<br/>\n<br/>\nEloric<br/>\nDark Elf Necromancer (rank 2)<br/>\nMythannial Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n...
