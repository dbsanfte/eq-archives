I just couldn&#39;t take it anymore,<br/>\nso I started a DE Necro.  Around the same time, a friend of mine was getting<br/>\ntired of his 24 warrior, and did the same thing.  We haven&#39;t looked back<br/>\nsince, and have now outlevelled our original characters.  Best choice we<br/>\never made.<br/>\n<br/>\nFaction is NOT a problem, so don&#39;t let that discourage you.  You just learn<br/>\nto pack a lot with you when you go on extended travels.  I&#39;m about to hit<br/>\nlvl 24 and haven&#39;t even needed to set foot in North Freeport or Feydwer in<br/>\nall this time.  There are always ways to raise faction, some of which are<br/>\nmuch easier than you might think.  I did the &quot;Note for Rebby&quot; and &quot;Note for<br/>\nJanam&quot; quests simultaneously for about 2 hours.  I went from barly tolerated<br/>\nto &quot;warmly&quot; in East and West freeport.<br/>\n<br/>\nMujahid  23 Necro  Solusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Peck White [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pwhite@...\">pwhite@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, March 28, 2000 9:53 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [EQ_Necromancer] Level 24 Pet, and related questions<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: Peck White &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pwhite@...\">pwhite@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ok, Thanks for the info.  Thanks to you also, Cory.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On a side note.  I started Alazzar because I got discouraged with my level<br/>\n&gt; 23 bard.  I just got tired of dieing all the time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well last night I made 2 1/2 bubbles of xp in 2 1/2 hours.  My bard never<br/>\n&gt; did this in his life.  I was amazed at how quickly my pet and I<br/>\n&gt; were mowing<br/>\n&gt; thru mobs with no downtime at all.  I am looking forward to<br/>\n&gt; playing Alazzar,<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m just going to have to get used to the faction thing.  I haven&#39;t had to<br/>\n&gt; deal with it yet.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Good hunting,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Alazzar<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
