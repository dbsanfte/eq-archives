Basically live through the hell that<br/>\nis getting to backstab, then find another rogue.  I swear I&#39;ve seen two<br/>\nrogues on Karana do this and simply SHOOT up the charts.  They hit a yellow,<br/>\nsometimes a lower red mob from both sides and take turns backstabbing.<br/>\nAlmost always the monster will switch targets between backstabs.  Its<br/>\nabsolutely astounding to see this.  Granted it doesn&#39;t work all the time,<br/>\nbut dual rogues (or multiple rogues even) is a sight to behold.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI still think necromancers are the best soloing class (again, this<br/>\nwithout playing a druid, the class which comprises 90% of the people over<br/>\nlevel 30 on Karana, I really have to try it sometime).  They can do it all,<br/>\nthey even have an okay healing spell (heal friend, drain enemy to regain<br/>\nhits, repeat).  At level 20 we just take off.  We get Expulse Undead (94<br/>\npoints of damage to undead) and drybones and exhumed gnolls just start<br/>\ndropping like flies.  At 16 you can live very well in the Lavastorm<br/>\nMountains killing elementals, rock dervishes, and lava crawlers till around<br/>\n18 or so, then moving on to nastier undead.  After that?  Dunno, I&#39;ve only<br/>\nseen one level 25 necromancer and he&#39;s a KewlD00d powergamer thus doesn&#39;t<br/>\ntalk much.  I think things just get scary after that though.  Research will<br/>\nbe a primal pain in the rear, but it shouldn&#39;t be too bad.  They&#39;ve<br/>\nincreased the frequency of the component drops and I&#39;ve actually saved up a<br/>\ngood 9 words/runes already onver this weekend.  I can use some of them but<br/>\nI&#39;ll probably just start trading them for the spells I can&#39;t get.  My worry<br/>\nis beyond the 30th level fro Necromancers.  There are only two research<br/>\nbooks I know of and they only go to level 29 or something for spells to<br/>\ncreate.  After that there&#39;s this empty zone.  Oh well, we shall live in<br/>\ninteresting times.<br/>\n<br/>\nMalark on Karana<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Jaded [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jaded@...\">jaded@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, May 10, 1999 9:03 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EQ_Necromancer] Fw: [EQMagicians] Just a thought..<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Jaded&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jaded@...\">jaded@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; \tSo if you can make a list of things that you are pissed <br/>\n&gt; off about<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the Necromancer, I think we can discuss them and maybe <br/>\n&gt; understand each<br/>\n&gt; &gt; other&#39;s position better.  PErsonally I think we&#39;re one of <br/>\n&gt; the best of the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lot.  Just about everyone I know has a MUCH harder time <br/>\n&gt; with just about<br/>\n&gt; &gt; everything else (except druids, DAMN, what&#39;s up with these <br/>\n&gt; guys that allow<br/>\n&gt; &gt; them to frikkin jump into the high end in like weeks?!?! That&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; what I want<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to know!)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have rogue, magician, and shaman (my primary) characters in <br/>\n&gt; addition to my<br/>\n&gt; necro. Now granted I&#39;m only at level 6, but so far this has <br/>\n&gt; been my easiest<br/>\n&gt; character by far. I can take on a yellow monster with a bit <br/>\n&gt; of luck, and<br/>\n&gt; whites are a no brainer. My shaman (lvl 11) has been slain by <br/>\n&gt; blue critters,<br/>\n&gt; can take a white only if the gods are smiling on him and then <br/>\n&gt; will finish<br/>\n&gt; the battle at zero mana and almost no health, and yellow is a <br/>\n&gt; death wish.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Magician is a bit better, but his run-ins with yellows have <br/>\n&gt; been horrific.<br/>\n&gt; Rogue is worst of all, of course. So (in MY experience, <br/>\n&gt; anyway), of these 4<br/>\n&gt; classes, necro is the strongest. You want weak? try a rogue... heh<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; Did you know ONElist has over 300 Star Wars lists?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Join one today!<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; This list is basically unmoderated.
