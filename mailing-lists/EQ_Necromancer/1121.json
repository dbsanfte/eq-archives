I was thinking of trying <br/>\nspectres as they con blue to me usually, but I do not have JBoots, so I <br/>\npretty much have to kill or be killed.

Even at 4 in the morning when only<br/>\n&gt;550<br/>\n&gt; &gt; are on the server, at least 65 are in S. Karana. If anyone has better<br/>\n&gt;ideas<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of what to solo at this level, I&#39;d be very interested in hearing from <br/>\n&gt;you.<br/>\n&gt;I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; really don&#39;t like the idea of wandering mobs sneaking up on me - but its<br/>\n&gt; &gt; better than waiting 2 hours for a damn aviak....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;ONElist announces &quot;FRIENDS & FAMILY!&quot;<br/>\n&gt;For details, including our weekly drawing, go to<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html\">http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;This list is basically unmoderated.
