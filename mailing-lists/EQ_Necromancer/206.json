Err or two spawns. On Spawn is like some Rexxon Rex or<br/>\nsomething like that. He is a high shaman I beleive. You drop down at the<br/>\nfirst bridge and he is up some stairs there. However beware of the gnoll<br/>\ncommanders and nobles. Rex is level 16. Next is near the five shaman spawn.<br/>\nThere is a door kind of behind it. In there spawns 2 nobles and inside that<br/>\nlittle room are 2 more doors. The door on the left spawns gnoll captain and<br/>\na gnoll shaman. The captain is generally level 16. Then in the right door is<br/>\na named Shaman spawn plus a normal shaman and a noble spawn. The named<br/>\nshaman has the runed totem Staff. They only appear once in a whiole. I spent<br/>\nlike 4 hours and only got 2. And those two were right in a row. This was<br/>\nfrom the named shaman spawn. Occasionally a High Shaman Grisk will spawn. He<br/>\nis level 17 I believe. But usually is is a level 16 spawn. These guys have<br/>\nRuned Totem Staves. +3 int (I think) +30 mana (I think the bonuses I am not<br/>\nsure on..only stats) it is a 9 dam 37 speed AND magical. That is same speed<br/>\nbut more damage then a minotaur axe but it is also double handed. Well that<br/>\nis a good staff. They should sell from 20 pp to 30 pp. 25 pp is fair. I have<br/>\nseen them go for 40pp which is a rip off. Go to the Karana plains and you<br/>\ncan get them for from 25pp to 30pp. I have seen level 25 wizards coming in<br/>\ntrying to get these staves. They are pretty decent.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Shadow Panther &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shdwpanther@...\">shdwpanther@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, May 04, 1999 6:54 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ_Necromancer] R: [EQ_Necromancer] 2H blunt<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Shadow Panther&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shdwpanther@...\">shdwpanther@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     I hear some of the MOBs in the Karanas carry runed staffs, but they&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; level 20 or better.
