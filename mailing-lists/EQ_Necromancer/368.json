As long as you are not PvP, your pet will take it without<br/>\ncomplaint.  I built up my evocation this way while waiting on the boat.  It<br/>\nworks for conjuration too. Just keep hitting your pet with disease cloud.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;another spell that i have found is under-used by our class is Dark Pact.  i<br/>\n&gt;cannot go on about how useful this spell is.  ok- seems simple... it takes<br/>\n&gt;your hp and gives you mana.  but now imagine this- you have just spent all<br/>\n&gt;your mana, and are safe (and at full hp, or close).  so just find a safe<br/>\n&gt;spot, cast Dk Pact, and hide/gather shadows-  you&#39;ll be back to full mana<br/>\n&gt;faster than any other spell caster class.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Here is another use I found for dark pact to increase combat effectiveness.<br/>\nWait until you are down a little in mana during a fight then cast.  Once<br/>\ncast, start hitting with life spikes or whatever you have to do damage/give<br/>\nlife.  If you do this right, you can keep it up indefinately.  The damage<br/>\nyou take from the pact is repaired by the spikes while the mana for the<br/>\nspikes is replentished by the pact.  It lets you get out a lot more spell<br/>\nattacks this way.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
