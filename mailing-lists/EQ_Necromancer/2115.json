Will this affect my speeds? Also cable is 2mbs here minimum. I<br/>\nheard cable probably won&#39;t raise much, but DSL will so it can be upgraded<br/>\neasily. Also, I take it I can talk and surf on 1 phone line with DSL right?<br/>\nThanks again =)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Kendan Boozehound<br/>\n 49th =( druid of e&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
