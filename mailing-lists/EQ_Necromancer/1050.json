Is it decent for a lvl 23 to solo? <br/>\n&gt;I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   heard that there&#39;s usually alot of people there, so the risk of <br/>\n&gt;getting<br/>\n&gt;hit<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   by more than one MOB is low. Also, is there anywhere in Faydwer for a <br/>\n&gt;DE<br/>\n&gt;to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   sell? As an outcast I was pretty sure there wasn&#39;t..... &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  Unrest is not a solo spot you&#39;ll do alot better getting in a <br/>\n&gt;group.....as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  selling try the druid ring in BB near the crossroads (hard to find  you<br/>\n&gt;may<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  want to look at a map first )&gt;     No where to bank though so 2 days is<br/>\n&gt;max<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  could stay without heading home to neriak.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;As a Dark Elf Necro... I would not even advise going there.  EVERY guard, <br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;NPC (especially the druids mentioned above) will be KOS.  It will be a<br/>\n&gt;harowing trip.  If you make it though, it ids a good place to learn :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sonoroud Tomebinder.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Show your ONElist SPIRIT!<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;With a new ONElist SHIRT available through our website.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;This list is basically unmoderated.
