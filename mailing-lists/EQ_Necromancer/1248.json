I&#39;d heard it was allot better.  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t really see any improvements, but I think I should tell you that if you<br/>\nget a blue &quot;looks kind of risky, but might be worth a try&quot; con - or<br/>\nsomething like that - recast for another. LoL I used one of those, and the<br/>\nmost damage it did was a six!  If you see any improvements over the last,<br/>\nplease give me a /tell or an E-Mail, can you?<br/>\n<br/>\n    I&#39;m in North Karana currently, and it seems like a very good place.  If<br/>\nnot dangerous.  The griffawns (I believe that&#39;s the spelling) can be blue or<br/>\nwhite - more typically blue - and the borer beetles are usually white con or<br/>\nsometimes yellow, and pincer beetles typically come up as blue.  If you want<br/>\na challenge, there&#39;s the lovely Sycthe Beetles, that will typically be<br/>\nyellow or red, more often red.  They hit for about 32 pts, twice in a row.<br/>\nSo you&#39;ll want to be careful of them.  Oh, and if you take on a griffawn, be<br/>\nsure you&#39;re near a zone point. LoL  They seem to have a rather fast attack,<br/>\nand multiples at that...<br/>\n<br/>\n    If you&#39;ve worked out your faction in Black Burrow, you can run to the<br/>\nguards.  The first tower coming from Qeynos isn&#39;t too far away.  But be<br/>\nwarned, I was there last night, and that tower seems like a virtual griffawn<br/>\nmagnet.  The poor guards, one right after another, then a hill giant came by<br/>\nand finished them off.  Fun to see, at least. hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\n    You&#39;ll also encounter the occasional blue grizzly, and green &quot;not sure&quot;<br/>\n(still gives a tiny bit of exp) silvermist wolf.  Careful of them wolves,<br/>\nthey&#39;ve hit me for 22 or so. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n    Hm, all of that, and I&#39;ve hardly ventured out into the zone.  LoL<br/>\nTaking little baby steps, I don&#39;t want to lose the level.  I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll<br/>\nfind more.  Oh, watch out for treants. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nHave fun!<br/>\n~Mysk<br/>\n16th Lvl Necro<br/>\n-=Tunare=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Ragman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rags@...\">rags@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, September 15, 1999 3:02 PM<br/>\nSubject: [EQ_Necromancer] Stormy Weather and level 16<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Ragman&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rags@...\">rags@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Greetings Dark friends,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I just made level 16 today and I am very excited about testing it out.
