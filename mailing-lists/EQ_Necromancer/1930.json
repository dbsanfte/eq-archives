Unless the mana given for each level is changed for post 50,<br/>\npeople are really going to feel a squeeze, some of the mana requirements for<br/>\nthose new spells are insane, and if our mana adjustment remains constant,<br/>\nwe&#39;ll have 20% more mana at level 60 but spells that require 100% more...I<br/>\ncan&#39;t wait to see how Verant figures this all out.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the bright side, for some of our lower level friends.  If shadowknights<br/>\nare getting the 39/44 pet, they can&#39;t make those research only anymore.  It<br/>\nwill be interesting to see how they work out research.  Since we get spells<br/>\nat each level, will the components for that level spell *only* drop off a<br/>\nmob of that level?  IE: level 55 pet requires words of insanely rare, do<br/>\nthose only drop off level 55 mobs?  If that&#39;s the case I fear the future my<br/>\nfriends.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
