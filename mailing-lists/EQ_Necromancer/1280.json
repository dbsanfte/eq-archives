If you are<br/>\nan evil race- don&#39;t do the Troll Bashers, you&#39;ll loose the ability to go into<br/>\nGrobb after one or two.  If you are a good character- by all means kill the<br/>\nDWARVES.  You can kill the two guards by the docks in Butcherblock Mountains<br/>\nwithout taking any faction hits.  Their weapons and coin loot off of one dwarven<br/>\nguard is like 20pp.  I don&#39;t remember what level they are, but I&#39;m pretty sure<br/>\nthey are around 32 or so.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, these guards don&#39;t do crap to save PCs.  They just keep stuff from<br/>\nwandering into the dock area.  At level 8, my ranger ran past them with an aqua<br/>\ngoblin wizard casting on him (these make mince meat out of level 8s).  I ran all<br/>\nthe way to the docks before I died (which was well past the guards).  I have<br/>\nnever seen them attack MOBs if they engauged with a PC, so no moral dilema of<br/>\nremoving the &quot;protection of newbies&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps.  They are a great source of income especially if you want to<br/>\nstart something expensive- like jewelcrafting.<br/>\n<br/>\nTearfall- DE Necro<br/>\n16th Level of Pain and Suffering<br/>\n-amoung others-</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
