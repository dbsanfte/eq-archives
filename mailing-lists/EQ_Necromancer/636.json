His parting words were to return the favor to another gnome when he<br/>\nwas able to, which he swore he would do.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter reading some messages in this list a few days ago about travelling to<br/>\nthe Innothule Swamp and Grobb I thought I&#39;d take a wander down and see what it<br/>\nwas like down there. I traveled in shadow fearing the monsters I&#39;d encounter<br/>\non the way, little did I know a fellow Necromancer was in a zone along my<br/>\njourney and happened to see me pass by. He inquired about my journey and<br/>\noffered to lead me the rest of the way and bind me to Grobb which he did (my<br/>\nfirst binding from home, yeah!) and even refused my offer of payment. If<br/>\nhunger (in the real world) didn&#39;t pull me away from EverQuest I would have<br/>\ntaken him up on his offer for a tour of the zone.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor someone who was twice threatened and harassed by characters &quot;roleplaying&quot;<br/>\nI am happy to see other friendly characters out there looking out for others.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d like to propose the creation of an invisible necromancer guild.. I&#39;ll<br/>\ncertainly remember the kind actions of a fellow necromancer and hope to return<br/>\nthe favor some day to another necromancer in need. Our Guild isn&#39;t easy and<br/>\ncertainly those of the Dark Elf race have an even harder time. Sharing of<br/>\nknowledge on forums like this one is a good thing and helpful to all,<br/>\nhopefully kind actions is another thing we can start doing for each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany thanks go out to Manick @ Innoruuk for his help and assistance.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJSpectre @ Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
