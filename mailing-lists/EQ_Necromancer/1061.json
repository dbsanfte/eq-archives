I haven&#39;t found any mobs that give troll or ogre<br/>\nfaction.  The only way to boost Troll or Oger faction is if you already<br/>\nhave enough to enter the town and get quests.  You can gain faction from<br/>\nthe quests but if your already KOS, your apparently SOL as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nLomack, Knight Defender of the BCK<br/>\nMaster of Recruiting<br/>\nwww.bck.org<br/>\n&quot;The Crimson Knights&quot;<br/>\nFennin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
