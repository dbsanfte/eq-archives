However, the side effect of that is that now<br/>\nyou can also use your sword and produce decent damage with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn order to be able to use polearm and be able to switch to sword and board<br/>\nyou need to spec four skills, which spreads can spread you somewhat thin.<br/>\n<br/>\nSlash<br/>\nPolearm<br/>\nShield<br/>\nParry(and if you use the polearm chances are you&#39;ll want parry)<br/>\n<br/>\nEventhough you get LEVEL x 2.0 skill points per level after level 5, it can<br/>\nstill spread you a little thin in some areas. Personally, I would suggest<br/>\npicking a style, sticking with it and then pump the extra points in the<br/>\nother areas.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those that are not familiar with specialising or spec&#39;ing in a skill,<br/>\nwhat it does is this..<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter putting raising a spec skill to a certain level you are given styles<br/>\n(and in the case of magic users...spells), in addition to getting combat<br/>\nstyles (they do lots of need things like taunt, detaunt, bleed which is<br/>\nkinda like a small dot, etc, etc) increasing a spec skill such as blades<br/>\nwill increase the minimum damage that you will do, in addition it also<br/>\ndecreases damage variance on spells. So increasing a spec line is a good<br/>\nthing.  As you might imagine there is a LOT more to this and somethings are<br/>\ndifferent for different classes in different realms.  An example would be<br/>\nthe assassin classes. (They are more assassin then thief, since we can&#39;t<br/>\nreally steal ;-) )  You may increase your pierce skill, which increases the<br/>\nminimum damage you can do, but you would also increase your critical strike<br/>\nskill which would increase the MAX damage you can do. There are a TON of<br/>\nthings you can do with your character in this game. While not everything is<br/>\ntotally balanced and its far from perfect, I feel that its the best system<br/>\nthat I&#39;ve played to date.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my two coppers.<br/>\n<br/>\nOskar<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Marlon Clark&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:marlonclark@...\">marlonclark@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@yahoogroups.com\">EQ_Necromancer@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Saturday, February 22, 2003 1:55 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ_Necromancer] just joined<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hi,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I used to play a DE necro to 20 in EQ.

Not for me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d like to 2nd what Howler said about the tanks in DAoC.<br/>\n&gt; They are not the primary damage dealers. They are meant to<br/>\n&gt; absorb, block, parry damage. They also get a skill called<br/>\n&gt; &quot;protect&quot;, which acts as a detaunt on the person they place it<br/>\n&gt; on. This keeps the Mobs smacking the guy in plate armor, and<br/>\n&gt; not the caster or cleric in cloth or chain.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Armsman in Albion do get a polearm ability which does tremendous<br/>\n&gt; damage, but I don&#39;t see very many players going that route<br/>\n&gt; currently.  Polearms are slow, and you give up shields to do this.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The thief type classes in DAoC are extremely fun to play. The<br/>\n&gt; Infiltrator class in Albion can do quite a bit of damage. In fact<br/>\n&gt; so much so, the clerics can have a full time job keeping them<br/>\n&gt; alive. I have a 45th level Armsman, and my friend plays a 49th<br/>\n&gt; level Inf, so I&#39;ve seen this personally. I can also put Guard on the<br/>\n&gt; Inf, and block shots on him. This has saved his butt several times.<br/>\n&gt; Some Infs do spec in Dual Wield, they get several nice styles from<br/>\n&gt; the skill.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I haven&#39;t had much fun in RvR, so I&#39;m waiting for 50th to really<br/>\n&gt; give it a good try.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Another good site is www.classesofcamelot.com<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Keltan<br/>\n&gt; 45th armsman, Iseult.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Howler D.

They<br/>\n&gt; are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; not meant to be MEGA damage dealers, they are meant to<br/>\nabsorb/block/parry<br/>\n&gt; &gt; damage.  There are other classes that are REALLY good at laying the<br/>\nsmack<br/>\n&gt; &gt; down, but at the cost of giving up some defensive capability.<br/>\nBeserkers,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Mercenaries and Blademasters are REALLY good at smacking the living tar<br/>\n&gt; out<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of something, but they also will take more damage by default.  These<br/>\n&gt; classes<br/>\n&gt; &gt; are also known as dual wielding classes. While other classes like the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Nightshade, Infiltrator, Shadowblade, Ranger and Scout get a form of<br/>\ndual<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wield, they typically do not spec in it. The exception being the<br/>\n&gt; Shadowblade<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (I LOVE this class after my bard)  Instead of getting dual wield,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Shadowblades get a skill called leftaxe or LA for short. Dual Wield<br/>\n&gt; (Albion)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and Celtic Dual (Hibernia) work differently than LA.  Dual wield has a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; chance to trigger, when it does trigger and it does hit, it hits for max<br/>\n&gt; &gt; damage. With LA, it swings EVERYTIME, when it hits it does a percentage<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the max damage. So while you swing all the time when you hit its partial<br/>\n&gt; &gt; damage...which is still VERY good.  Its usually only a few points off of<br/>\n&gt; my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; main weapon damage, because I keep it pretty high.  Midgard is the only<br/>\n&gt; &gt; realm that gets LA. Shadowblades, and Beserkers get LA.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; So as you can see it depends on how you wish to play.  There are other<br/>\n&gt; tank<br/>\n&gt; &gt; classes that you should also look at.  I really like the Midgard Thane.<br/>\n&gt; The<br/>\n&gt; &gt; thane gets a nice AOE DD spell that smacks big ole hammers on thy<br/>\nenemies,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; as well as a point blank AOE instant on a 20 second timer, a single DD<br/>\n&gt; &gt; instant on a 20second timer, a castable DD and a STR/CON buff.  The<br/>\n&gt; weakside<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is they are a bit light on the HP, but are a TON of fun to play.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; You may also want to checkout a Champion in Hibernia. I have a Lurikeen<br/>\n&gt; &gt; large weapon champ and he is soooooo cool. He is similar to the thane<br/>\nyet<br/>\n&gt; &gt; different. Instead of DD he gets some nasty debuffs and a nasty DD<br/>\n&gt; instant.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Basically what you may want to do is to go to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://daoc.catacombs.com\">http://daoc.catacombs.com</a><br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; checkout the spell lists and style lists for the classes you wish to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; checkout. They also have some decent class discussion forums there. I<br/>\nread<br/>\n&gt; &gt; them quite often.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I know this is a bit of a long winded E-mail, but there is a lot to know<br/>\n&gt; &gt; about the various classes. I&#39;ve personally found something to like in<br/>\n&gt; every<br/>\n&gt; &gt; class as well as something not to like.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; If you would like to know more about a certain class and specing please<br/>\n&gt; let<br/>\n&gt; &gt; me know.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thanks<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Oskar<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Stuart Thomson&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Stuart@...\">Stuart@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@yahoogroups.com\">EQ_Necromancer@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Thursday, February 20, 2003 4:52 AM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: RE: [EQ_Necromancer] just joined<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Howler,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I ordered it yesterday with the expansion and should get it Friday :)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Just one question, Whats the best warrior type class to play?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: Howler D.

I quit EQ well over a year ago.  Personally, I REALLY<br/>\nlike<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I will be honest and say that I&#39;m not really fond of the dungeons that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; originally came with DAoC. They were weak at best. However, the new<br/>\n&gt; &gt; dungeons<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in the expansion are much better and much more EQ like. I always felt<br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; EQ&#39;s dungeons were fairly well designed and they only got better with<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; expansions.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; With that said, the main attraction for me is the Realm vs. Realm<br/>\n&gt; combat.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Taking keeps and jacking relics is a total blast!  I have noticed that<br/>\n&gt; my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; friends that have tried DAoC have started on what we call the &quot;Co-op&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; server. Basically, these are like EQ style servers and are PvE<br/>\n&gt; &gt; only...pretty<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; boring if you ask me.  Give a regular server a chance and I think you<br/>\n&gt; will<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; like the way RvR is done. You won&#39;t have someone in your home town<br/>\ngank<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; or people from other realms raiding newbie areas. Its just not setup<br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; way.  If you play on a PvP server its a different story.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; RvR in my book is just awesome.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If you have any questions please feel free to ask. I will be glad to<br/>\n&gt; help<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you out as much as I can.
