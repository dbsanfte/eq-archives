What is the benefit of attacking quicker?  It seem<br/>\n&gt;to be important to everyone, but I don&#39;t understand why.  The combat system<br/>\n&gt;seems to go by rounds, so having a faster weapon would not mean more hits.<br/>\n&gt;The only benefit I can see is that your pet is more likely to do damage<br/>\n&gt;before it dies rather than dying before it get to hit for that round.<br/>\n&gt;Getting in one more hit doesn&#39;t seem like a good enough reason for everyone<br/>\n&gt;to go through so much effort to give their pet a weapon with a small delay.<br/>\n&gt;What am I missing?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Aazen1@...\">Aazen1@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Aazen1@...\">Aazen1@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;Sent: Wednesday, October 27, 1999 1:10 AM<br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [EQ_Necromancer] Digest Number 165<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Aazen1@...\">Aazen1@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Well, you should not give your pet say a rusty halberd, or some other slow<br/>\n&gt;weapon after this as yes it will only slow him down.But I would DEFINITELY<br/>\n&gt;advise you to give your pet a dagger of some kind (FS are best if you are<br/>\n&gt;high enough lvl to be giving them to a pet).Why?Because, daggers will make<br/>\n&gt;your pet attack quite a bit faster than with his bare fist and it does not<br/>\n&gt;lower his damage.So it&#39;s hitting for the same amount of damage, but a good<br/>\n&gt;deal quicker.<br/>\n&gt;Aazen SyVex<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;In a message dated 10/26/99 4:33:45 AM Pacific Daylight Time,<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&lt;&lt; I thought that at 16th level and above you should not give your pet a<br/>\n&gt;weapon<br/>\n&gt; because he did more damage barehanded.
