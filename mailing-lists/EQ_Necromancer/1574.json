Now EVERYONE<br/>\nwants to have one.  Do you honestly think Smed is going to show up to hear<br/>\nANOTHER group of whining players, regardless of whether or not their<br/>\ncomplaints were valid?  No, he won&#39;t.  This would encourage people to hold a<br/>\nsit in for every damn complaint they had (Monsters attacking through<br/>\nwalls=Sit-in! Price for bonechips on vendors too high=Sit in!).  The more<br/>\nyou use a tactic like this, the less impact it has.  Smed was wrong to even<br/>\nshow up to the first one.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYour best tools for getting something changed are phone calls and mail.  Not<br/>\nEmail, that&#39;s easy to just delete,  good old-fashioned U.S.P.S.. Which would<br/>\nyou pay attention to more, a bunch of messages in your Inbox, or 10 50lb<br/>\nsacks of mail being dumped on your desk?  /Feedback works well to.  It takes<br/>\neffort, not drama.  I play a necro, a high level one, and I don&#39;t feel that<br/>\nthis warrants a sit in anyway.  But it does need to be un-nerfed.  All a<br/>\nmassive newbie death fest will do is piss off everyone that&#39;s not a necro,<br/>\nVerant included.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIMNSFHO</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
