At level 8 with new<br/>\nspells i grabed new summon spell and ward undead and soloed a dwarf skeleton<br/>\nspawn that spawned 4 skels and got level 9 in hours. Then i soloed<br/>\nchessboard to level 12, level once a day.  Then I killed orcs from 12 to 16<br/>\nsolo and got 1 level per day.  6-7 hours.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Just looking for a little encouragement, was Level 7 the most difficult<br/>\n&gt;for everyone?   I&#39;m struggling to get to 8, my pet doesn&#39;t seem to help<br/>\n&gt;much and my Mana regeneration is very slow, even with meditate.  I know<br/>\n&gt;things get better at 8 but will every level like this (11,15,19 etc.)<br/>\n&gt;be this difficult?  Or is just me?  My ranger character advanced easily<br/>\n&gt;until he hit the teens so this has been frustrating.   Is grouping the<br/>\n&gt;only solution to problems like these?  Not my first choice....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks,<br/>\n&gt;Saga-Mith.Marr </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
