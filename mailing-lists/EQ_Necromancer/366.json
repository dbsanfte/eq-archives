When is it effective and when is it<br/>\n&gt; not?  I cast it on some skeletons that were attacking others in Befallen,<br/>\n&gt; and it said that it appeared...well, I forget the word that it uses, but<br/>\nit<br/>\n&gt; was successful.  However the creature continued to smack the player<br/>\naround.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     So.. does it slow the attacks, or just not work while it&#39;s fighting<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; just needs to be cast on the creature while it&#39;s still just standing or<br/>\n&gt; wandering around?  Or would it have been something else that immediatly<br/>\n&gt; ticked it off again?  The player, in one instance, was just running and<br/>\nnot<br/>\n&gt; swinging back.  I didn&#39;t have enough for a Ward nor wanted to chance<br/>\nticking<br/>\n&gt; it off and being smacked around myself.
