I was wondering what hot buttons I should<br/>\n&gt; configure in terms of Pet Commands and how and when I should use them in<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; order to use them effectively? I also plan on grouping regularly<br/>\n&gt; (unfortunately, mostly with good races) and I was wondering if this has<br/>\n&gt; any impact on my pet and how? Any tips you would be willing to give a<br/>\n&gt; young first time DE Necromancer on BB would be appreciated.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Looking to expand your world?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; ONElist has 180,000 e-mail communities from which to choose!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; This list is basically unmoderated.
