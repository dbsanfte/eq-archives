I have accidentally<br/>\nmessed up my factions with Dark Bargainers so that they are apprehensive.  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t know how this happened, but I went from amiable to apprehensive<br/>\nwithout even being indifferent!!!  But anyway, is there ANY way to get<br/>\nfactions higher with Dark Bargainers that anybody can think of?  I tried<br/>\nWine quest...  won&#39;t give it to ya unless you are indiff or better.  I tried<br/>\nslaves in Crushbone...  the woodelf slaves gave me good factions towards<br/>\nIndigo Brotherhood, but none to Dark Bargainers.  Tried the GLS and LS quest<br/>\nin South Ro to Smith Tv&#39;ysa but she wouldn&#39;t take them or talk to me<br/>\neither...  must have to be indiff here as well.  So I finally got a lvl 50<br/>\ndruid (39 - 50 can do this) cast wolf form on me in S. Ro and this made no<br/>\ndifference.  She still hated me!  So is there any quests anyone can think of<br/>\nthat would possibly help me here?  I am really getting desperate and have<br/>\nspent hours trying these other things.  Thanks a lot!!!<br/>\n <br/>\nReally paying for this stupid mistake!!!<br/>\n <br/>\n- Xinuilt<br/>\n  lvl 20 DE on Quillious</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
