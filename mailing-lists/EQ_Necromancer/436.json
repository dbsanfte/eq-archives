Thats the GUILD, however, guards may still KOS ceretain races<br/>\nso conn them.  The guild is guarded by Ghouls who will KOS most non DE<br/>\nwho try and enter there, as well as the wandering pets who may take<br/>\nexception to other races.  Use invis to enter, conn guards from a<br/>\ndistance, if they aren&#39;t immdiately hostile cast invis to undead once<br/>\nyou enter the third gate of neriak and you should be able to get past<br/>\nthe Ghouls.  Just remember to recast it after you visit the guild when<br/>\ntrying to go past the ghouls again.  THe secret here is to conn<br/>\neverything before getting within attack range.  Also, if you&#39;ve been<br/>\nkilling Crushbone Orc don&#39;t even go into Nektulous forest, the Indigo<br/>\nBrotherhood is the Dark Elves so your faction is probably in the KOS<br/>\nrange.<br/>\n<br/>\nSlortar on Karana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
