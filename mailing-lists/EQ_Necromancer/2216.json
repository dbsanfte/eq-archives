A full group takes them <br/>\nwith no problem... 2 Necros can do the same. Not only is it good EXP <br/>\nbut the Loot is great (Can get heavy at times).<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom 25 - 30 I suggest Druids in EK or Rangers in WK. Once again <br/>\nGreat exp and Loot.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor 30 - 35 Ulrich in WK is the best, this is a prime spot for <br/>\nNecro&#39;s and druids. He is on a 6 minute timer and is tough at 30 and <br/>\na breeze at 35.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor 35 - 40 start taking Einhorst. He is in the same camp as Ulrich. <br/>\nKeep in mind you must kill ULrich before pullin Ein or you will be <br/>\nusing FD alot.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you dont have problems in groups for Treants & Druids or getting <br/>\nthe Barb Spawns then you can go from 20 - 40 in about 2 or 3 weeks of <br/>\ngood game play.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave Fun, <br/>\n<br/>\nFaelen Cazicsoul<br/>\n45th Necromancer of Cazic-Thule<br/>\nOfficer - Clan of One<br/>\nBristlebane Server<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@egroups.com\">EQ_Necromancer@egroups.com</a>, &quot;JC&quot; &lt;silkk@u...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; I am becoming extremely frustrated with my necro.
