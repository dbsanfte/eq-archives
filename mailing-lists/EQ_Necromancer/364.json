My Necro certainly doesn&#39;t know where<br/>\nthat creature went, he just knows.. he smacked it with a spell and suddenly<br/>\nit ducked behind a wall. Is it coming around from behind? Or maybe it&#39;s<br/>\nrushing at him through the shadows..  certainly, if the creature took off<br/>\nrunning to the other side of the zone, I&#39;d have to do some serious looking<br/>\nto find it.<br/>\n<br/>\n    So, I think it&#39;d be a good idea to only have certain creatures have the<br/>\nability to track their opponent.  Or like it was said, give them a certain<br/>\ntime limit that they follow/track a player.  It&#39;s just plain silly that the<br/>\nthing knows, from several miles away, that you just sat down and now you&#39;re<br/>\nan easy target..<br/>\n<br/>\n~Mysk<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I think you can keep track of a monster from across the zone, then<br/>\n&gt; so can they.

If the monsters<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t know where everything was it would lead to a lot of AI problems and<br/>\n&gt; issues.  AI just isn&#39;t that good yet in games.  I think Verant has done an<br/>\n&gt; alright job so far.  There&#39;s obvious bugs, but at least monsters help each<br/>\n&gt; other out, cast spells right, and do a myriad of other things.  In just<br/>\n&gt; about every other game the computer ALWAYS has a complete knowledge base<br/>\n </span></blockquote>of<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; the area to work with (like RTS games) but it just &quot;pretends&quot; it doesn&#39;t.<br/>\n&gt; Those of you who played Red Alert saw this alot when your secret assault<br/>\n&gt; force of tanks that were going to flank the base while the AI opponent<br/>\n&gt; attacked yours was suddenly attacked BY the enemy force.<br/>\n&gt; Again, if I had to choose between more realism and more gameplay, I<br/>\n&gt; would always choose more gameplay.  You want realism?
