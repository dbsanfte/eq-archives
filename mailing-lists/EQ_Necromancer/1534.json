You should also have a bard in the group to play <br/>\n&gt;mana song.<br/>\n&gt;Also an enchanter to tashani, and stun if it isn&#39;t resisted.  You would <br/>\n&gt;also have to<br/>\n&gt;have plenty of FS daggers and a mage to summon his dagger since a pet can&#39;t <br/>\n&gt;duel wield<br/>\n&gt;two weapons of the same kind.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Manuael<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&quot;Fletcher, Neal L SGT 224 MI BN&quot; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Fletcher, Neal L SGT 224 MI BN&quot; <br/>\n&gt;&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:FletcherNL@...\">FletcherNL@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Actually, they capped the LT at about 5-6 levels above you.

Get 6 lv 50 Necro&#39;s with pets, and 6 <br/>\n&gt;lv<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 50 clerics, and once the giants are taken care of, I think with the <br/>\n&gt;clerics<br/>\n&gt; &gt; healing the pets (I&#39;d give them some nice, cheap, fast weapons,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bloodclaw&#39;s.. etc) the dragons could be taken with only a few deaths.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This list is basically unmoderated.
