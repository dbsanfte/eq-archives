Personally, I&#39;m f&#39;n outraged about it.  I<br/>\nmight even have to start playing another class if they mess it up bad<br/>\nenough.  I just hit lv 20 and they pull this stuff.  We&#39;re being penalized<br/>\nfor soloing, yet necromancers are a solitary class, practically useless in<br/>\ngroups. (unless you&#39;re fighting undead)  Verant needs to hear our voices on<br/>\nthis.  If kiting is the problem, then why not change one spell (SoW) instead<br/>\nof a whole line of spells that make up the bulk of our offense?<br/>\n<br/>\nPhrost <br/>\nCazic-Thule</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
