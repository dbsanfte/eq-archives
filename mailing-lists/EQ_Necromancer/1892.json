I suppose part of that is the fact that<br/>\n  there are just so many different cards out there for the standard, and not<br/>\n  all of them support basic features.  When we are finalling a game, our<br/>\n  programmers go through and actually make special cases for some of these<br/>\n  cards.  Certain ones will report that they can do a certain type of fogging<br/>\n  in hardware, when in actuality they can&#39;t.  Verant basically dropped a d3d<br/>\n  renderer in the game and said &quot;go&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  That said, I agree the Geforce destroys 3dfx hands down, but on games that<br/>\n  are primarily glide enhanced (ie: EQ) the voodoo is still the way to go.<br/>\n  Optimally, get a Geforce and keep your voodoo2, or hell grab one at the same<br/>\n  time, they&#39;re only like 60 bucks now.  And then you can still run glide only<br/>\n  games, or games like EQ that are biased towards glide.  It pained me to take<br/>\n  the geforce out and put my V3 back in, but crashing to the desktop every 5<br/>\n  minutes on a Nagafen run made for a pretty cruddy gaming experience for me.<br/>\n  I also really missed the mipmapping feature, and the gamma options for glide<br/>\n  are much nicer.  I play a monk twinky, and there&#39;s nothing I hate more than<br/>\n  being without ultra/infravision searching for something to kill in an<br/>\n  outdoor zone at night.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; Verant, like all wimpy cover-our-butts developers, will NEVER say they<br/>\n  &gt; &quot;support&quot; anything new that comes out.  They just cannot be bothered to<br/>\n  try.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; That said, just because they don&#39;t &quot;support&quot; a particular card does not<br/>\n  &gt; mean it won&#39;t work.  I have the GE Force card and it works great in<br/>\n  &gt; EQ.  What Verant is referring to when they say they don&#39;t &quot;support&quot; the GE<br/>\n  &gt; Force is that EQ will not take advantage of many of the benefits of GE<br/>\n  &gt; Force.  The software has to be designed from the ground up to take full<br/>\n  &gt; advantage of the on-board processor.  But the GE Force will work fine with<br/>\n  &gt; EQ and probably every other game out there.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; Buy your card looking to the future.  Do NOT buy Voodoo - 3dfx and their<br/>\n  &gt; &quot;our way or the highway&quot; attitude is finally catching up to them, and<br/>\n  games<br/>\n  &gt; are coming out that no longer support Voodoo.  Good.  I am fed up with<br/>\n  &gt; arrogant hardware manufacturers.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; Riva and the TNT/GE Force is the way to go.  The cards are faster than<br/>\n  &gt; Voodoo, and games will soon be taking advantage of all the GE Force has to<br/>\n  &gt; offer.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n  This list is basically unmoderated.
