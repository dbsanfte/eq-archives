I know lots of you are die-hard EQ fans and I&#39;m not meaning to step on<br/>\nyour toes with this, but Asheron&#39;s Call looks mighty decent and sports<br/>\nbetter graphics -- to an extent, at least, with things such as blowing<br/>\nleaves.  But the thing I&#39;m mostly interested in is the world.  I&#39;ve been to<br/>\nthe web sites, but of course they&#39;re only going to give you a one-sided view<br/>\nof things.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Thanks folks,<br/>\n~Mysk<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and... Impart Strength is a good idea with your skelly.  I gives an okay<br/>\nboost to strength and it certainly does help to counter the weak pets.  Just<br/>\nremember to click on it and cancel if your pet falls and you have to go hand<br/>\nto hand.  No sense in going at it weaker than  you already are. :-)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
