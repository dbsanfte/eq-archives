Conjuration. Mana 50. This spell does an impressive 35 points of damage right off, and over a hundred in lingering damage over the next five minutes. However it lacks a graphic right now, and the radius seems oddly just about the right size to almost always catch your own pet who then joins the hoard of angry sick things attacking you. It is kinda fun to cast on player fighters who you do not want to kill only scare. It lasts so long they think they are mummy cursed and prevents natural healing. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone have any idea if this is true????<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSkel the Gnome</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
