When the game originally opened, the decaying<br/>\ngnome skeletons didn&#39;t give you a faction hit. They changed that when they<br/>\nmoved the necromancer guild down into the mines. I believe the said<br/>\nskeletons affect your faction because Verant decided they were summoned by<br/>\nthe gnome necro guild. If you con them, they are amiable to you. Originally,<br/>\nthey were aggressive.<br/>\n    If in doubt about a skeleton, con him. Any of the ones that will affect<br/>\nyour faction with the Dark Reflection won&#39;t be aggressive to you, I don&#39;t<br/>\nbelieve. That is the way with some of the regular gnome skeletons. Some are<br/>\naggressive to you, and carry no faction penalty to kill them, while others<br/>\nare amiable, and DO affect faction. ALL of the decaying gnome skels are off<br/>\nlimits, however, if you value your faction.<br/>\n    As far as the Dwarf skeletons in Butcherblock, none of them affect your<br/>\nfaction with Dark Reflection.<br/>\n<br/>\nMacabre, gnome necromancer (Bertoxxulous server)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Naeeldar &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jackal@...\">jackal@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Sunday, July 18, 1999 12:46 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ_Necromancer] Kos in your guild by killing undead if you are<br/>\na gnome<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Naeeldar&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jackal@...\">jackal@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Decaying Gnome Skeletons for some reason give you a faction hit in the<br/>\nGnome<br/>\n&gt; Necro Guild personally I think this is a bug because it&#39;s not like that<br/>\nfor<br/>\n&gt; any other newbie areas.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Naeeldar Dark Elf Necromancer of the 34th Circle </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
