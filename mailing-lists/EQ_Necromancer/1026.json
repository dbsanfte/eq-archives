The text messages<br/>\nwe give while buffing or healing are very<br/>\nmisleading to people who don&#39;t know what they<br/>\nmean.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was in the Freeport arena having fun dueling<br/>\ndifferent classes. A warrior was wanting to duel a<br/>\nfriend of mine but needed a small hit point gain<br/>\nbefore he was fully healed. Both a paladin and I<br/>\ncast spells on him, mine was Dark Empathy, the<br/>\npaladin&#39;s spell was, by mistake, Lull. Now I&#39;m<br/>\nsure that had the warrior ever gotten Dark Empathy<br/>\ncast on him before he would know that the text<br/>\nmessages sound strange, specifically the fact that<br/>\nthe caster says, &quot;Ahhh, I feel much better now,&quot;<br/>\nwhen in fact he is giving his health to that<br/>\nperson. However, the warrior didn&#39;t know any<br/>\nbetter so he saw the Lull, heard my words, and<br/>\npromptly attacked me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t play on PvP servers but I was looking<br/>\nforward to one. I wouldn&#39;t want this to happen<br/>\nagain in a PvP environment though. So my question<br/>\nis this, will the text of this spell ever be<br/>\nmodifed to reflect the fact that the caster is<br/>\nhurting himself??<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry for the gripe but it kind of bothered me<br/>\nlast night.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Haytred, Erollisi Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
