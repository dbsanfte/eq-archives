I always go the nro to freeport way to get on<br/>\nboat and never have had a problem, but you can stand on the dock all day<br/>\nlong and no npc will bother you. DE&#39;s have a deal with the freeport militia<br/>\nthat is why we can walk freely around (for the most part).<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce you get on the boat, sister island is the first stop.  I hunted there a<br/>\nlot at your level and made quite a bit of money :)  My favorite spot to set<br/>\nup on the island looks like a little tear drop coming off the island where<br/>\nnone of the sisters go, so I could always med or pull to this area with no<br/>\nproblem.  As soon as the boat turns and is lined up the edge of the island<br/>\non the right, I would jump off the boat and swim to this point and commence<br/>\nwith the slaughtering.  You are kos to the people at the dock, so stay away.<br/>\n<br/>\nVanelin Blackheart<br/>\n34th DE Nec - Povar<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Hu Anderson [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:as4603rosand@...\">as4603rosand@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, December 13, 1999 9:24 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [EQ_Necromancer] Sister Isle..........<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Hu Anderson&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:as4603rosand@...\">as4603rosand@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI am a lvl 13 DE necro and was wanting to make a trip to the Sister Ise in<br/>\nOOT.
