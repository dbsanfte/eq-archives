It depends on the <br/>\naggressiveness of the mob and its level to you.  Once your level difference <br/>\nbetween monsters is too high, your pet will ignore it.  Basically, the fight <br/>\nhas to be a bit of a challenge.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso sometimes the monsters are aggressive enough to attack your pet, making <br/>\nthe fight happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nSonoroud</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
