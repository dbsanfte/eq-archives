It&#39;s pretty much<br/>\n&gt;the same with all the other Necro quests too.  They&#39;re designed to make you<br/>\n&gt;waste the time you otherwise would have spent leveling, inching closer to<br/>\n&gt;50. (Verant doesn&#39;t want you to hit 50 for fear that you&#39;ll leave and take<br/>\n&gt;your money with you.)
