I ran to the ruins and sure<br/>\nenough..there is Varsoon and his pet.  I con him, blue...I can taste the +9<br/>\nintelligence already.  I begin the fight!  Varsoon fought well, but went<br/>\ndown easily with half of my mana, I turn my attentions to his pet, and<br/>\nalready Undying Varsoon has appeared (a level 30 necromancer<br/>\nzombie...scary!)  My pet turns to Undying Varsoon in an attempt to get him<br/>\noff me, and succeeds for a while, until UDV (for brevity&#39;s sake) casts<br/>\nscreaming terror on him.  My pet bolts and leaves me to deal with the fiend.<br/>\nLuckily, living varsoon&#39;s pet has perished and I turn my full wrath on the<br/>\nundead beast.  I hit him with Dooming Darknes, and  Boil blood, both stuck<br/>\n(thank goodness) but he resisted my shock of poison! oh no! out of mana.<br/>\nBUT! Here comes my pet to save the day!!! (or so I think)  The pet starts<br/>\nbeating on the zombie and I run a bit to let the DOT&#39;s do their work.  Soon<br/>\nUDV is in his death throes...but what is this?!  No experience and No<br/>\ncorpse.  Thus, no glowing black stone.  I was one unhappy necromancer.  This<br/>\nhad happened to me earlier while fighting that enchanter on the docks of the<br/>\nhills.  He had charmed my pet and when the charm wore off, poor gabantik was<br/>\na mere mob.  A friendly one, but still a mob.  None of my commands would<br/>\nwork on him.  but he still felt a need to protect me and so, he fought well,<br/>\nand won the fight.  And as we all know, when a mob takes your kill. there&#39;s<br/>\nno corpse.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe moral of my sad story (which I guess is more of a vent of my<br/>\nfrustrations, thanks if you&#39;re still reading my long winded report)  If your<br/>\npet in any way loses control of himself, whether it be fear, screaming<br/>\nterror, beguile undead, charm...you might as well kiss any loot from said<br/>\nmob good bye.  And be prepared to cast another pet.  Because this one won&#39;t<br/>\ngo away, and you&#39;ll need the help in killing him.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Grizumpy Bloodmaw  Cazic Thule</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
