This would reflect the characters increase in<br/>\nknowledge and ability to retain spells. And give adequate explination for<br/>\nwhy lower lvls don&#39;t have as many slots. Though i&#39;m sure verant made limited<br/>\nslots for balancing purposes. If magic-users had access to all their spells<br/>\nor the greater majority of them at all the time magic users would be<br/>\nsignificantly more powerful than most character classes. It makes you think<br/>\nabout what you should cast and prepare accordingly. It does get tedious<br/>\nthough, to constantly sit and mem spells as they wear off.<br/>\n<br/>\n-david (Mazooth- Cazic-Thule) </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
