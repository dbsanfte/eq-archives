I like to think that the<br/>\nstrategy involved in memorizing spells is what sets us appart from the big<br/>\ndumb warriors :) I&#39;m not saying I wouldn&#39;t like to be able to mem *all* my<br/>\nspells, or even 8 more, just that I think it would seriously give casters an<br/>\nadvantage, and reduce the need for tanks etc, especially for necros, who<br/>\nalready have the skeleton porta-tank.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Tony B&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tonyb72@...\">tonyb72@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; i would really just like to be able to have spells ready in case of<br/>\n&gt; emergencies, without hurting my ordinary ability to dish out damage.  for<br/>\n&gt; example, i almost always have ward undead, even if there are only a few<br/>\n&gt; undead around.  resting after a battle and getting attack by a zombie is<br/>\n </span></blockquote>no<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; fun, even though they are rather weak opponents.  even a high level,<br/>\n&gt; ordinary skeleton can do some damage if you dont have a pet and/or ward.<br/>\n&gt; just for comparison, i got trained by 3 skels, without a pet, and i was<br/>\n </span></blockquote>able<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; to kill them all.  by the time i finished i was severly low on hp, and<br/>\n </span></blockquote>just<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; about out of mana (enough for gather shadows).  if i wouldnt have had<br/>\n </span></blockquote>ward,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; i would have been dark elf pot pie.<br/>\n&gt; i also like to keep either gather shadows or gate on hand, but it would be<br/>\n&gt; nice to have access to both.  also, i almost always use dark pact, and the<br/>\n&gt; extra mana has saved my buns many a time.  it would just be nice to have<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ability to use a good portion of the spells i have, instead of needing to<br/>\n&gt; choose a small handful.  im sure any spellcaster can agree with that, but<br/>\n&gt; since we are already limited in our ability to take damage, i think the<br/>\n&gt; versatility would help, even if it doesnt really make us all that much<br/>\n </span></blockquote>more<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; powerful.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
