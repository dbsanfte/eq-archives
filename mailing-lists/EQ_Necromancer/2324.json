Have you ever played ANY of these games? They&#39;re not turn<br/>\n&gt; based...Civilization is turn based.

They are turn based, but give the illusion of realtime.<br/>\nBasically its you attack, roll, miss, he attacks, roll, hit.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Are you on drugs? These are ALL first person shooter perspective.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I did misuse the word &quot;persepective&quot; here. However, the point I was trying<br/>\nto convery was that in my opinion something like SWG should not be turn<br/>\nbased. It should be more in line with Unreal Touney, Quake 3, Doom 3, etc.<br/>\nAiming a weapon at point blank range and letting the computer basically roll<br/>\na die to see if it hit you sucks. It sounds like they have the right idea<br/>\nfor the space flight expansion however.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd to answer the first part of your question, the answer is no. I never<br/>\nhave and never will. You can&#39;t expect to do well in these games if you kill<br/>\nhalf of your freakin brain cells.  I am a professional software developer<br/>\nand you can&#39;t expect to be a doper, write good code and keep your job when<br/>\nyou are stoned.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What, by the way, does RvR mean?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Realm vs. Realm combat. I believe Marlon answered that one in another post<br/>\nso I won&#39;t give you the gory details.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; EQ2 uses the same engine as Star Wars Galaxies, which you were just<br/>\n </span></blockquote>dissing.<br/>\n<br/>\nUm, not in the slightest. Try reading the FAQ from each game sometime. They<br/>\nhave created TWO totally seperate engines. The EQ2 engine is still VERY zone<br/>\nbased. The devs claim this helps with creating very area specific content<br/>\nwith tons of detail without hampering the server too much. SWG wants a VERY<br/>\nseamless and vast environment.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are the excerpts from each FAQ<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat 3D engine will EQII use?<br/>\nEverQuest II utilizes a proprietary 3D engine, which was developed in-house<br/>\nby the EQII programming team. The EQII engine takes full advantage of<br/>\ncurrent cutting edge 3D hardware, as well as future hardware technology.<br/>\n<br/>\n11.05 What engine will you use?<br/>\nThe Star Wars Galaxies team is creating an entirely new 3D engine for this<br/>\ntitle. The engine will be specifically designed to portray the Star Wars<br/>\nuniverse in the greatest possible detail. The team will be using<br/>\nVerant/SOE&#39;s experience in creating 3D engines for MMO titles and may<br/>\nincorporate elements from engines currently in development at the company<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you read each games FAQ in its entirety you will see that each game wants<br/>\nsomething very different in their respective engine. These are two VERY<br/>\ndifferent dev teams each creating an engine.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd no, I was not &quot;dissing&quot; any engine, I was only stating what I like and<br/>\ndont like with the engines.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Yeah, my wife has one account without Luclin, and I barely comprehend how<br/>\n </span></blockquote>we<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; played back then. You really must have the new graphics engine in order to<br/>\n&gt; appreciate how far along EQ&#39;s come.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thats what my friends who still play tell me. It sounds very nice.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Nope, their lack of foresight&#39;s probably losing them this player. I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; have the resources nowadays to spend ANY money &quot;just in case I like it<br/>\n </span></blockquote>more<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; than the game I enjoy playing now&quot;. Even when I was annoyed with EQ a year<br/>\n&gt; ago, there were plenty of MMORPGs out there who would let me try them<br/>\n </span></blockquote>free.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, that of course is entirely up to you.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Oskar</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
