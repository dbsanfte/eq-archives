Are there any<br/>\n&gt; &gt; suggestions as to where and what I should be hunting<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to level somewhat<br/>\n&gt; &gt; quickly. Speed is NOT of the essence, I guess I am<br/>\n&gt; &gt; looking for a somewhat<br/>\n&gt; &gt; safe yet efficient spot.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Couple places not often camped...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1) 19 shamen orc in Kithcor... zone from HH and turn<br/>\n&gt; to your right then run till you get to corner. I never<br/>\n&gt; died there, dont fear cause there are a few lower lvl<br/>\n&gt; orc near by that could kill you... Dark.. (make sure<br/>\n&gt; pets taunt it off) sic pet.. Dot... run... life tap...<br/>\n&gt; run (I ran backwards) along the wall till mob is dead.<br/>\n&gt; Dies realtivly guickly.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 2) Lars McManuss is lvl 20 barb in WK kinda tough but<br/>\n&gt; if your carful you wont die.. wouldnt try unless you<br/>\n&gt; have atleast 150 int though.  I like to turn pets<br/>\n&gt; tuant off... dark till it sticks...  DOT and LT till<br/>\n&gt; dead with a fear thrown in on occasstion.  Good new is<br/>\n&gt; a lot fo druids camp the area and with a sow i never<br/>\n&gt; once died :-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 3) Cordelia Minister in NK is very tough but do able<br/>\n&gt; but be prepared to zone a lot cuase on occasion you<br/>\n&gt; will pull a guard by accident. she is lvl 18-22<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 4) In Lesser Faydark there is a GREAT npc that is<br/>\n&gt; rarely camped. Forget the name.  Very near the zone to<br/>\n&gt; Steamfont is some cottages.  She is in the one  to the<br/>\n&gt; far southwest. Very safe as the zone is right there, i<br/>\n&gt; got killed like 1 time in 2 lvls here i beleieve.<br/>\n&gt; belive mob to be 20-22 in lvl.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyway.. theres a few places.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
