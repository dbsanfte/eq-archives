One of my friends had<br/>\na problem from 10-12, it took him 2 weeks for 2 lvls, but after he hit 12 he<br/>\ngot to 16 in 2 weeks, 4 lvls.  I would say 10-11 is the hardest for a necro,<br/>\nbecause skels don&#39;t give ya hardly any xp at lvl 10 and at 11, and nothing<br/>\nelse is easy to kill because they either own your pet, or shrug off your<br/>\nshitty drain spell that does a WHOPPING 11 or 12 damage, hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Murphy, Kenneth E.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MurphyK@...\">MurphyK@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hello.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I recently started a new dark elf necromancer on Mythannial Marr. I&#39;m a<br/>\n&gt;whole lev 2 at this point. I haven&#39;t trained any skills yet at the guild<br/>\n&gt;hall. Can I get some advice as to what spells to focus on? Is 2H staffs the<br/>\n&gt;weapon I should be using?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Also at what level will I start to get a good feel for being a necromancer<br/>\n&gt;and start coming into my own? Are there any levels I should just gut out?<br/>\n&gt;For example my lev 15 magician had a very rough time at lev7 but at lev8<br/>\n&gt;things were MUCH easier. When I get lev 16 with my magician tomorrow or the<br/>\n&gt;next day I&#39;ll again see a HUGE increase in power. I&#39;m assuming Necromancers<br/>\n&gt;work the same way?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Any tips would be appreciated.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Eloric Lev2 Necro - Mythannial Marr -<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;...
