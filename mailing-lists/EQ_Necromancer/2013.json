See \n  A long time ago when necromancers pets could&nbsp;whip major ass. The speed \n  delay of the weapon was used so it reduced the pet speed therefore making it \n  attack&nbsp;more often, but since the pet hit for about 50 not many weapons \n  could be given to the pet to make it hit harder next to a Exe axe. We there \n  was a BUG in Everquest (go figure), that actually made any npc unless monk \n  without a weapon in both hands unable to dual wield. To correct this instead \n  of just writing it in the code, they made Magicians pets able to wield \n  weapons. This then allowed the to dual wield. Well this was great and all but \n  this now may the Mage pets even more powerful and they needed to correct this \n  so the only thing from a weapon that adds to the pet is the damage rating and \n  only if it is better then the pets natural attack. This is stated as above you \n  would need one hell of a weapon to hit better then the pets natural attack. At \n  level 12 and beyond no weapon unless expensive will make the pet hit harder. \n  So the Long sword for your level 4 pet was better attack for him. He still is \n  as slow but he hit harder.</font></span></tt></div>\n  <div><tt><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-477910725010053515-28032000\"></span></tt>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><tt><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-477910725010053515-28032000\"></span></tt>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><tt><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-477910725010053515-28032000\">&nbsp;</span>From:</tt> <tt>Peck White \n  &lt;pwhite@...&gt;</tt> <br><br><tt>Hello,<br><br>I am new to the \n  list and being a Necro.&nbsp; I am a level 4 Necro on the<br>Mithaniel Marr \n  server.&nbsp; I am a little confused on the pet weapon issue.<br>Last night I \n  gave my pet a rusty short sword.&nbsp; Before I gave it to him his<br>max \n  damage was 6.&nbsp; After I gave it to him it went to 10.&nbsp; Was it just \n  a<br>fluke and the weapon didn&#39;t do anything?&nbsp; That&#39;s what the below \n  seems to<br>suggest.<span class=\"ygrps-yiv-477910725010053515-28032000\"><font face=\"Nosferatu\"\n size=\"3\">&nbsp;</font></span></tt></div>\n  <div><tt><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-477910725010053515-28032000\">\n  <p><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Metiphisto</font> <br><font face=\"Arial\"\n size=\"2\">Necromancer Tarew Marr</font> </p>\n  <p><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">&quot;You are never really living until faced with the \n  truth of death!&quot;</font> </p></span></tt></div>\n  <div><tt><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-477910725010053515-28032000\">&nbsp;</span><br><br>Thanks in \n  advance,<br><br>Alazzar&nbsp; <br><br>-----Original Message-----<br>From: \n  Trizzen Do&#39;Trevan [mailto:trizzen@...]<br>Sent: Tuesday, March 28, 2000 \n  10:01 AM<br>To: EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com<br>Subject: Re: [EQ_Necromancer] \n  Level 24 Pet, and related questions<br><br><br>From: Trizzen Do&#39;Trevan \n  &lt;trizzen@...&gt;<br><br>There are two types to give to pets. Weapons \n  that<br>process, and weapons that do not. If you give a pet a<br>weapons that \n  processes(dnoll hide lariat, mage<br>summoned sword), then the pet will \n  process in battle<br>and do extra damage. Any other weapon makes \n  no<br>difference what so ever. Rusty, low damage, high<br>damae, low speed, \n  high speed, it makes no difference<br>what so ever. However, with the recent \n  weapon change,<br>the pet will sometimes &quot;eat&quot; a weapon. You give it \n  a<br>weapon, and it does not show up as a graphic, and pet<br>does not double \n  hit. You need to give the pet another<br>weapon.</tt></div><br>\n  <hr>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/1807/7/_/451101/_/954257602/\">\n  <center><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" height=\"60\"\n src=\"https://ec.yimg.com/ec?url=http%3A%2F%2Fadimg.egroups.com%2Fimg%2F1807%2F7%2F_%2F451101%2F_%2F954257602%2FPower2.gif&t=1564900551&sig=cKR_pqPzIyeVopgHBToGsA--~E\"\n width=\"468\"></center>\n  <center><font color=\"white\"></font></center></a>\n  <hr>\n  <tt>This list is basically unmoderated.&nbsp; However abusive language will \n  not be tolerated</tt> <br></blockquote></span></blockquote></html> \n</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
