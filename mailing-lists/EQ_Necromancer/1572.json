It&#39;s pretty much<br/>\n&gt;the same with all the other Necro quests too.  They&#39;re designed to make you<br/>\n&gt;waste the time you otherwise would have spent leveling, inching closer to<br/>\n&gt;50. (Verant doesn&#39;t want you to hit 50 for fear that you&#39;ll leave and take<br/>\n&gt;your money with you.)  Most of the items are there only for vanity&#39;s sake,<br/>\n&gt;although I&#39;ve gotten addicted to permenantly being able to see invis.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I used screaming terror last night, and I love it.  People in my guild are<br/>\n&gt;ALREADY asking me to join groups because of it.  It&#39;s a great spell, though<br/>\n&gt;I haven&#39;t played with it on any yellows or evens yet.  If you&#39;re soloing<br/>\n&gt;with a pet, use it, stacked with Shadow Vortex, and then a Darkness (which<br/>\n&gt;will pull the mob as soon as the first tick of the DoT hits).  Bottom line<br/>\n&gt;is, it makes us more useful/wanted in a group, which is something we&#39;ve <br/>\n&gt;been<br/>\n&gt;lacking in.  And once you get to higher levels, you&#39;ll realize that if<br/>\n&gt;you&#39;re not wanted in a group, you&#39;ll have a hard time getting anything good<br/>\n&gt;without buying it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;This list is basically unmoderated.
