You can go in the<br/>\nconversation up until he says &quot;[compromise the shrines location].&quot;  You can<br/>\nnot get the SOB to respond to that phrase no matter how you word it.  If you<br/>\ncan prove me wrong, please do so.  I finally got Drosco, darn near died<br/>\n(left over poisen, what a pain), and then had to sweat my way into the<br/>\nTemple of Thunder to do anything.<br/>\n<br/>\n    What do you do with the Sealed Letter, any of you know?<br/>\n<br/>\n~Myskyra / Tunare<br/>\n<br/>\n  ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n  From: The Baron<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a><br/>\n  Cc: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Mithaniel_Marr@onelist.com\">EQ_Mithaniel_Marr@onelist.com</a> ; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqfeedback@...\">eqfeedback@...</a> ;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqnews@...\">eqnews@...</a> ; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jsmedley@...\">jsmedley@...</a><br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, April 18, 1999 10:44 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [EQ_Necromancer] Broken Spells and Quests<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n          has anyone heard anything about patching the broken spells? Also<br/>\nthe quest where your supposed to get Trumpys Irontoes head is broke, I spent<br/>\n2 hrs on this quest today, finally killed the dwarf and gated before the<br/>\nguards got me just to give the head[actually it was meat] to the guildmaster<br/>\nfor him to say &quot;ah your giving me dwarf meat, Thank you&quot;, well needless to<br/>\nsay at that point I was about to loose my mind, So I called a GM and told<br/>\nhim about the Spells [Vamp Embrace and Sum Shadows] just for him to say that<br/>\nhe will report it and hopefully it will be addressed in a upcoming<br/>\npatch.......so in a nut shell were SOL! personally I think we should start<br/>\nmaking alot of noise about this, it seems to 989 that making the sun set and<br/>\nthe moon rise is more important than getting our class&#39;s spells fixed! also<br/>\nIf you would like the screen shots of the talk I had with this GM I would be<br/>\nhappy to send them to you.....<br/>\n<br/>\n  P.S. Im sure Im gonna get back some feed back from other class&#39;s in the<br/>\ngame, all I can say is for you to try to take on 10+ level monsters with a<br/>\n4th level damage spell and tell me how long you last when you have 3 of them<br/>\non you...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDelggath<br/>\n                                                                        One<br/>\nVery Pissed Necomancer </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
