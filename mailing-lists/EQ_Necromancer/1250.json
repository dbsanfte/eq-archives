Especially since it is local and thus<br/>\n&gt;all your characters are drawn from the same list.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The only trick I have managed to use is to create a social that basically says:<br/>\nFriend2<br/>\n/who all &lt;name&gt;<br/>\n/who all &lt;name&gt;<br/>\n/who all &lt;name&gt;<br/>\n/who all &lt;name&gt;<br/>\n/who all &lt;name&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt gives you an extra five friends to keep an eye on.  I suppose if you<br/>\nhave enough social space you could make a Friend3 social as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat really annoys me is that if you start up on a 2nd server, your friends<br/>\nlist carries over.  How many friends do you have on the 2nd server that use<br/>\nthe same name as that of the first server.  Personally I wish the friends<br/>\nlist was specific to each server, however verant dosen&#39;t appear to think so<br/>\nas I did a feedback on this quite a few months ago.<br/>\n<br/>\nLomack, Knight Defender of the BCK<br/>\nMaster of Recruiting<br/>\nwww.bck.org<br/>\n&quot;The Crimson Knights&quot;<br/>\nFennin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
