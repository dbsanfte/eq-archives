For example by backing<br/>\nit off just before MOB swings ect? Seems both my necromancer and my magician<br/>\ncan benefit from any such techniques that may work.<br/>\n<br/>\nBesides the obvious healing your pet, I have found that fearing the monster<br/>\ngives your pet some free attacks. With my magician I have found if I burn<br/>\nthe mob just right I can get it to strip off my pet and come chasing me, but<br/>\nnot at full speed. The MOB sorta takes a few steps, then my pet whacks its<br/>\nback and it turns around and swings at my pet before coming for me again. I<br/>\nfind that in this special condition my pet does much better as its getting<br/>\nsome cheap attacks, the MOB is slowly moving towards me but I can easily<br/>\nwalk back between casts, and the MOB seems less effective at attacking my<br/>\npet over the time its walking to me. If I over burn the MOB coming screaming<br/>\ntowards me in full frenzy and I&#39;m in trouble.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would love to hear any and all tricks for getting your pet vs MOB to last<br/>\nlonger. Esp any tips regarding using pet commands during battle.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I am curious to know if anyone has tried to use GATE as a way to buy<br/>\ntime in a fight. IE some form of the following. Bind yourself near a zone<br/>\nwall or some semi safe place. Then you go out and DOT a MOB then gate (note<br/>\nyour staying in same zone). Mob runs to you while you run from your gate<br/>\nspot. When you see monster DOT again and gate. Repeat. Sorta super kiting<br/>\nusing gate instead of SOW? This is very lame for sure, but from a pure<br/>\nstrategy point of view it interests me. Though I admit I haven&#39;t tried it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for any help.<br/>\n<br/>\nVeneficus (17th) magician<br/>\nEloric (7th) necormancer<br/>\nMortifer (8th) wizard<br/>\n<br/>\nof Mythannial Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n...
