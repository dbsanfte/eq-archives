I am not interested in learning new<br/>\nlanguages. I find that performing an action repetitively, as is required to<br/>\nlearn Old Erudian, is not my idea of time well spent. While I can appreciate<br/>\nthe role it plays in creating a cohesive environment, I don&#39;t want to have<br/>\nto do it. I work during the day. People give me money. I play at night. I<br/>\ngive people money. Sounds fair. But not when I need to perform an action<br/>\nthat is not interesting or fun in pursuit of further happiness. While I am<br/>\ncompletely OK with the option being available and even encourage it, I don&#39;t<br/>\nwant to be forced to spend my online time blabbering away with others when I<br/>\ncould be out getting slain repeatedly by elf skeletons. That being said,<br/>\nhere is my request: Does anybody have a listing of research combinations for<br/>\nthe necromancer class or know where I might find such a list? I have fought<br/>\nand struggled through every other aspect of this game, and it was enjoyable.<br/>\nBut this is where I personally draw the line. I love this game, but I only<br/>\nhave so much free time. Thanks for any help you can offer.<br/>\n<br/>\nDave<br/>\nShaopaul, lvl 17 Necromancer, Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
