On anything I want to get the faction points for. This does<br/>\nonly 5 damage for so, so no chance for a kill steal but it does stop a<br/>\nmonster from healing which has the nice benifit of being a steath DoT that<br/>\ncan help the real group fighting by reducing the total hps of the monster by<br/>\nquite a bit. For example my pet (lev 16 spell) heals 5-10% of its hps from<br/>\njust fearing the monster or my tanking DURING the fight. So I&#39;m guessing<br/>\nmonsters can easily heal up 10% of their hps or more in a normal warrior<br/>\nmelee the monster type of fight. So your stoping the healing is a nice<br/>\nblessing for almost no mana. I have heard of many necro&#39;s using this simple<br/>\nlev 1 spell well into the upper 20&#39;s for this effect.<br/>\n<br/>\nSincerely,<br/>\nMortifer - Humble Knight - MoltenLava<br/>\n<br/>\nAKA - Eloric - Necromancer Rank 5<br/>\n    - Veneficus - Magician Rank 5</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
