For <br/>\n&gt; example by backing<br/>\n&gt; it off just before MOB swings ect? Seems both my necromancer <br/>\n&gt; and my magician<br/>\n&gt; can benefit from any such techniques that may work.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Besides the obvious healing your pet, I have found that <br/>\n&gt; fearing the monster<br/>\n&gt; gives your pet some free attacks. With my magician I have <br/>\n&gt; found if I burn<br/>\n&gt; the mob just right I can get it to strip off my pet and come <br/>\n&gt; chasing me, but<br/>\n&gt; not at full speed. The MOB sorta takes a few steps, then my <br/>\n&gt; pet whacks its<br/>\n&gt; back and it turns around and swings at my pet before coming <br/>\n&gt; for me again. I<br/>\n&gt; find that in this special condition my pet does much better <br/>\n&gt; as its getting<br/>\n&gt; some cheap attacks, the MOB is slowly moving towards me but I <br/>\n&gt; can easily<br/>\n&gt; walk back between casts, and the MOB seems less effective at <br/>\n&gt; attacking my<br/>\n&gt; pet over the time its walking to me. If I over burn the MOB <br/>\n&gt; coming screaming<br/>\n&gt; towards me in full frenzy and I&#39;m in trouble.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I would love to hear any and all tricks for getting your pet <br/>\n&gt; vs MOB to last<br/>\n&gt; longer. Esp any tips regarding using pet commands during battle.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also, I am curious to know if anyone has tried to use GATE as <br/>\n&gt; a way to buy<br/>\n&gt; time in a fight. IE some form of the following. Bind yourself <br/>\n&gt; near a zone<br/>\n&gt; wall or some semi safe place. Then you go out and DOT a MOB <br/>\n&gt; then gate (note<br/>\n&gt; your staying in same zone). Mob runs to you while you run <br/>\n&gt; from your gate<br/>\n&gt; spot. When you see monster DOT again and gate. Repeat. Sorta <br/>\n&gt; super kiting<br/>\n&gt; using gate instead of SOW? This is very lame for sure, but from a pure<br/>\n&gt; strategy point of view it interests me. Though I admit I <br/>\n&gt; haven&#39;t tried it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks for any help.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Veneficus (17th) magician<br/>\n&gt; Eloric (7th) necormancer<br/>\n&gt; Mortifer (8th) wizard<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; of Mythannial Marr<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ...
