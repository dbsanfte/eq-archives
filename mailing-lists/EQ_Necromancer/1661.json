So until you can<br/>\n&gt;do that safely, avoid being the only one fighting them as it&#39;s rather rude<br/>\n&gt;to kite one then train the rest of the island to zone everytime ;) a nice<br/>\n&gt;darkness/fear/pet combo will finish one off easily, as with any outdoor mob.<br/>\n&gt;Just get one to yourself and keep him feared  and slowed while your pet does<br/>\n&gt;the dirty work.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;This list is basically unmoderated.
