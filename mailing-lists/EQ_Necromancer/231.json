I like playing as a Necro so far<br/>\n(only level 3) and want to start putting more time into him; however, I have<br/>\na question.  Should I keep playing as an Erudite or should I change to a<br/>\nDark Elf?  The main problem that I have with Erudites is that no one will<br/>\nsell to you in your own city except your guild.  I am also under the<br/>\nimpression that because you are a Necro you are KOS pretty much everywhere<br/>\n(is this correct?).  If this is true then it would seem that a Dark Elf is<br/>\nbetter since you have a whole starting city to operate from and since a<br/>\nNecro is KOS anyway being a Dark Elf wouldn&#39;t be any more of a disadvantage.<br/>\nThe only advantage that I see with Erudites is a slightly higher starting<br/>\nINT but this can be offset by putting almost all your extra points into INT<br/>\n(or is there some other stat you really need to be higher?).  As another<br/>\nquestion can an Erudite necro travel safely through the evil race cities or<br/>\nare they KOS everywhere (basically are they considered to be part of an evil<br/>\nrace even though they are Erudites)?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I said I haven&#39;t invested a lot of time in my Necro yet so if I&#39;m going<br/>\nto change I want to do it soon.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
