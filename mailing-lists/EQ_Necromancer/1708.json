However<br/>\n&gt; if you&#39;re going after uber-mobs you might as well do<br/>\n&gt; giants, as the loot is<br/>\n&gt; infinitely better (griffs drop like 6p tops, and the<br/>\n&gt; occasional feather/eye)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTalk to your friends online with Yahoo!
