I have never ever heard of this, and it has not been my <br/>\nexperience after months of playing this game.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt may or may not be true (no matter what casters realm says) that using a <br/>\npet reduces the ep you get from a kill.  But it is certainly not true that <br/>\nyou get even less ep if your pet does over half the damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr, are you saying that the bard has to do a little damage to you to get <br/>\nthe max. ep?
