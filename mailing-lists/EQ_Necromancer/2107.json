I&#39;m running a 32Mb Diamond Ultra<br/>\nV770D (Riva TnT2 chipset).  I have a 20.4 gig hard drive.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow for the problem.  In order for the game to be playable whenever I&#39;m in<br/>\nKunark, I have to COMPLETELY lower the clipping plane, and change some of<br/>\nthe other settings (like particle density, etc).  If I do not do this, I get<br/>\nthe framerate from HELL.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo tell me...did Verant just COMPLETELY drop the ball on the minimum system<br/>\nrequirements?  Anyone with a similar configuration having the same problem?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nMujahid</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
