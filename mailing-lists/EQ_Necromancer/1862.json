That said:  I have been playing EQ for several months now, but have<br/>\nnever turned the &quot;Mipmapping&quot; feature on (although my clip plan is set all<br/>\nthe way out).  I&#39;ve always hesitated, because I don&#39;t know much about video<br/>\ncards, and it says that it would have to restart in Glide mode (which I have<br/>\nno idea what that means).<br/>\n<br/>\nWith my video card, would I benefit from turning that option on?  If so,<br/>\nwhy?  What the heck is mipmapping and what the heck is Glide mode?<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry for the flood of questions, but I&#39;m a real hardware newbie.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance for your help,<br/>\nMujahid  17 Necro  Sol Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
