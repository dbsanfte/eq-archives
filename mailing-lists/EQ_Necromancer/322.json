PErsonally I think we&#39;re one of the best of the<br/>\n&gt; lot.  Just about everyone I know has a MUCH harder time with just about<br/>\n&gt; everything else (except druids, DAMN, what&#39;s up with these guys that allow<br/>\n&gt; them to frikkin jump into the high end in like weeks?!?! That&#39;s what I want<br/>\n&gt; to know!)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>   I would love to see other complaints about the class. The Necromancer<br/>\nwas designed from the start to be one of the only _truly_ soloable<br/>\nclasses. I believe the fact that wizards and druids can solo so well is a<br/>\ngame imbalance (this is not fact... pure opinion on my part!). But a<br/>\nnecromancer soloing _is_ supposed to be possible, right on up to lvl 50.<br/>\nWe get better pets overall than mages, we get a huge line of DoT spells,<br/>\nwe get the full line of darkness and anti-undead spells, and to round<br/>\nthings out we get some of the best utility spells (feign death, locate<br/>\ncorpse, etc). Our price, of course, is to be hated by everyone. Is this<br/>\nsuch a problem though? We tend to solo, so we don&#39;t _need_ others. We are<br/>\nalmost totally self-sufficient. <br/>\n   What all the muble-jumble amounts to is that I feel the necro is most<br/>\ncertainly _not_ neglected by Verant in any way. We were designed as a solo<br/>\nclass, and have spells that over time can nearly equal the destructive<br/>\nforce of a wizard without suffering some of their downfalls. Not to say<br/>\nthat we are in anyway overpowered... we have our share of hardships,<br/>\nespecially that level right before a spell circle when our pets are<br/>\nworthless! But then, something has to hold us back :)<br/>\n<br/>\nValdus</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
