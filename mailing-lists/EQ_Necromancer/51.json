I<br/>\nwas fortunate enough to find a Cracked Staff early on and can&#39;t stop<br/>\nmyself from using it, so at level 8 my piercing and 2 handed blunt are<br/>\npathetic.    Any other advice would be great...<br/>\n<br/>\nSaga-Mith.Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Juan Custer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JuanC@...\">JuanC@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: Juan Custer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JuanC@...\">JuanC@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tThis guy is correct.  Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve done... just<br/>\n&gt; keep killing<br/>\n&gt; skels and auction that you are looking for a great<br/>\n&gt; worn staff, but DON&#39;T<br/>\n&gt; forget about your piercing.  I&#39;d trade off every<br/>\n&gt; level, just purchase a<br/>\n&gt; normal (nonrusty) dagger and every level swap<br/>\n&gt; weapons to keep yourself<br/>\n&gt; sharp.  After a bit... say anywhere between 8 and<br/>\n&gt; 14th level, go to Splitpaw<br/>\n&gt; Dungeon and grab a Runed Totem Staff off the dead<br/>\n&gt; body of a Gnoll shaman or<br/>\n&gt; high shaman.  Splitpaw is for 5-15 people but bring<br/>\n&gt; a group cause they like<br/>\n&gt; to mass attack you with greens.  That&#39;ll hold you<br/>\n&gt; till you are around 17+<br/>\n&gt; level... then you should go get a like-leveled<br/>\n&gt; group, go to Befallen, skag a<br/>\n&gt; Gossimer Robe AND a Dagger of Menkar down there.  I<br/>\n&gt; may have screwed up the<br/>\n&gt; name of the dagger.  The cool thing about the dagger<br/>\n&gt; is you don&#39;t HAVE to<br/>\n&gt; wield it to get the benefits.  Store it in the<br/>\n&gt; RANGED weapon slot, I never<br/>\n&gt; use that slot anyway, but if you do maybe I wouldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; store it there...<br/>\n&gt; nothing like wasting that dagger.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tAfter that, I have no clue.  I heard a certain<br/>\n&gt; gator in Oasis<br/>\n&gt; carries the next generation in staves, the glowing<br/>\n&gt; wooden crook, but I have<br/>\n&gt; no stats and I know the mob is at least level 20.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Malark Zaren&#39;Tul, Karana Server<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:TkAdam@...\">TkAdam@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:TkAdam@...\">TkAdam@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Thursday, April 22, 1999 5:49 AM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [EQ_Necromancer] Re: Finding a staff<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:TkAdam@...\">TkAdam@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; In a message dated 4/21/99 8:15:25 PM Eastern<br/>\n&gt; Daylight Time, <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jk211495@...\">jk211495@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; working on my staff skill.  are the later better<br/>\n&gt; weapons <br/>\n&gt; &gt; all staff based, or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  are there some good high level necro usable<br/>\n&gt; daggers out <br/>\n&gt; &gt; there?
