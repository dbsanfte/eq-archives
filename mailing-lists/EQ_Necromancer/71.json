The guards are all paladins... Don&#39;t know if it&#39;s true or not,<br/>\n&gt; never been there. But the question still remains from the original<br/>\n&gt; post: Where is the necro guild in Freeport, if there is one?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll try to be more specific this time :)<br/>\nIn East Freeport, there is a slum area, with building marked as &quot;condemned&quot;<br/>\nif you enter this building through the upstairs door, you should find a<br/>\nstair way which leads to a small room.  There is a false wall in this room<br/>\nwhich leads to another stairway.  Keep going down until you hear the<br/>\nfamiliar sounds of necro spellcasting :)<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also, I&#39;m new to the list, here is a little bio info..<br/>\n&gt; Playing a Dark Elven Necro named Kagon currently level 6 on Fennin<br/>\n&gt; (yes, I try to roleplay), who hasn&#39;t even been over the other side of<br/>\n&gt; the bridge yet in Nektulos Forest, nevermind outside the zone =P<br/>\n&gt; Necros just level too quick! I also have a Wood Elven Ranger (who<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t) that I&#39;ve been neglecting since I started the necro this past<br/>\n&gt; weekend. Just havin too much fun, I love being able to take on whites<br/>\n&gt; and yellows consistently.<br/>\n<br/>\nAmen, I have a 6th level ranger that took me a good 3 weeks to build up, my<br/>\nHuman Necromancer is now level 9, killing things that conn red and I&#39;ve got<br/>\nmaybe a day of play time in it (1.5 realtime weeks.)  Being a drow probably<br/>\nmakes things a bit more difficult, I know there&#39;s an entrance to the sewers<br/>\noutside the city, near the south gate along that large wall, but the exact<br/>\nroute to take to get to the guild escapes me (I only navigated this tunnel<br/>\nonce, and it&#39;s *long* and *twisty*)  I know I&#39;d be more than happy to help<br/>\nout a fellow necro by getting spells etc, but that doesn&#39;t help much come<br/>\ntraining time, and earning people&#39;s trust when it comes to 5-6pp for spells<br/>\ntakes a long time.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Mark (Gheyla -Human Necro Cazik Thule) </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
