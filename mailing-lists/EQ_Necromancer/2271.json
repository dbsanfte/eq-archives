So why waste the time, energy and cash on getting <br>&gt;it \n  weapons?<br>&gt;<br>&gt;From levels 1 through 12 it&#39;s a good thing to get the \n  biggest meanest <br>&gt;2 hander you can loot.&nbsp; This can dramatically \n  increase your pets <br>&gt;damage output.&nbsp; At 16 you really need the high \n  end 2handers like fine <br>&gt;steel to even get a marginal improvement in \n  damage.&nbsp; <br>&gt;<br>&gt;/pet attack &lt;G&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Maldain \n  Demorte <br>&gt;Level 55 Necromancer<br><br></tt><br><br><tt>This \n  list is basically unmoderated.&nbsp; However abusive language will not be \n  tolerated</tt> <br><br><tt>Your use of Yahoo!
