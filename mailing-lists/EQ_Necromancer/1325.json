It would make sense.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Not to mention spells.  I don&#39;t know about you folks, perhaps you like<br/>\nit, but I don&#39;t like the thought of having to &quot;research&quot; all of the good<br/>\nspells.  Figured I could buy &#39;em from you other players. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n    Oh!  This is just a bit of a side note.  Perhaps all of you have already<br/>\ndone this, but awhile back I went to Odus and checked the location that&#39;s<br/>\nsupposed to lead to Paineel.  There&#39;s a nice entry way to it, and a tunnel<br/>\ngoing back into the rock.  A couple of talking skeletons are in there that<br/>\ncomplain &quot;a skeleton&#39;s work is never done&quot;, and suggests you pick up a pick<br/>\nand help them out if you hail &#39;em.  Instead of loading, you find yourself<br/>\nback several steps towards the entrance of the tunnel.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Heck, while I&#39;m at it, I may as well ask here too.  I&#39;m looking for<br/>\npeople to tell me what the price is for the Thaumaturgist (sp?) robe.  I<br/>\nhear it goes for 70 to 80 plat.  I&#39;ll be needing to know soon and I&#39;m just<br/>\ntrying to verify this.  Thanks!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Steph</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
