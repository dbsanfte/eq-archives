Basically as far as anyone knows, the only<br/>\n&gt;thing DEX does is increase your ability to recover while spellcasting, and<br/>\n&gt;THAT&#39;S IT.  How important is this?  No clue, I haven&#39;t researched this<br/>\n&gt;extensively.  Basically if this is the case then you probably don&#39;t need<br/>\n&gt;much DEX.  The REAL primary attribute is INT, through and through.  INT<br/>\n&gt;directly affects how much mana you have, thus how much longer you stay in<br/>\n&gt;the field before meditating.  We&#39;ve discussed this before, but basically<br/>\n&gt;having as much INT as possible is probably the best way to go.  After that,<br/>\n&gt;dumping your remaining points is up to you.  You aren&#39;t a fighter, so<br/>\n&gt;putting points into Agility seems useless, most monsters will be hitting<br/>\n </span></blockquote>you<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;and hitting you hard anyway.  Same goes for Stamina, you&#39;ll never have the<br/>\n&gt;hitpoints of even a Rogue, so seriously what&#39;s another hitpoint per level?<br/>\n&gt;Say you&#39;re level 25 and have 25 extra hitpoints?  Well sadly level 25<br/>\n&gt;monsters are probably doing close to 40-90 points of damage per hit anyway,<br/>\n&gt;so MAYBE one more hit.  Don&#39;t get hit.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I might say its more important for wizards as they don&#39;t have pets,<br/>\n&gt;but they should be in groups anyway.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Basically I know one solid thing.  Multiples of 5 in your INT is<br/>\n&gt;good and the more you can get the better you are.  If you are looking at a<br/>\n&gt;choice between a +3 AGI item and a +1 INT item you should take the INT<br/>\n </span></blockquote>item.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;There are many  INT increasing items in the game for virtually all armor<br/>\n&gt;slots garnering you probably more than 20 more INT points, which is 4 more<br/>\n&gt;mana per level (and at level 25, that would equate to having another 100<br/>\n&gt;mana to play with)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hit the INT hard, then dump whatever you have left somewhere, heck,<br/>\n&gt;maybe in STRENGTH so you can carry more.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Malark on Karana<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;From: Mata [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mata_eq@...\">mata_eq@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;Sent: Wednesday, May 19, 1999 8:47 AM<br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: [EQ_Necromancer] DEX ???<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Why is dex our main attrib beside INT if we rarely go hand to hand?<br/>\n&gt;(I know we have a touch spell, but most people say that is more for<br/>\n&gt;shadowknights)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I am mad I put my extra (after maxing int) points into dex now when I read<br/>\n </span></blockquote>a<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;million posts now that say Dex is useless.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I mean from all I&#39;ve read AGILITY is 100 times better for any caster!!!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Please say it ain&#39;t so, and that my 100 dex (gnome) isn&#39;t a big frekin&#39;<br/>\n&gt;waste . . .<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Where do some of the Internet&#39;s largest email lists reside?<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;At ONElist - the most scalable and reliable service on the Internet.<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;This list is basically unmoderated.
