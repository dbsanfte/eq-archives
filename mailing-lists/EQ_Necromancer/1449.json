I think I&#39;ll be able to hit 20 quite esily via<br/>\nDW crocks in Oasis, but after that I&#39;m hoping to move on.  Any suggestions<br/>\nor advice?  Also I could use some info on the lvl 20 spells, which ones are<br/>\nworth the plat, where they are and what I&#39;ll need to research.  So far I&#39;ve<br/>\nonly been successfull in researching one spell, and my research had gone up<br/>\nonly once so I do not put too much faith into it yet.  One last thing --<br/>\nwhat would be some inexpensive +int earings good for a necro?<br/>\n<br/>\nNoriamus of Povar</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
