Ice bones are resistant to non-magical attacks, and since<br/>\nmy &#39;tank&#39; friend doesn&#39;t have a magical weapon, we pretty much always have<br/>\nto flee from these foul creatures while we&#39;re hunting orcs...<br/>\n<br/>\nNot worth arguing over, because I won&#39;t dispute that most critters never<br/>\ngive up.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; \tWhat you probably did was hit an area it couldn&#39;t cross or they had<br/>\n&gt; their attention broken by another character or were killed.  No<br/>\n&gt; monster ever<br/>\n&gt; forgets you unless they die, you die, you zone, or some Enchanter hits it<br/>\n&gt; with a MEmory Blur (actually I think that only makes the monster<br/>\n&gt; forget who<br/>\n&gt; he&#39;s pissed off the most at).  Chances are something happened to<br/>\n&gt; to icebone<br/>\n&gt; while you were hauling arse.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; \tMalark on Karana<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; PS - I _could_ be wrong, but I seriously doubt it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Jaded [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jaded@...\">jaded@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Tuesday, May 11, 1999 8:50 AM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [EQ_Necromancer] Just a thought..<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Jaded&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jaded@...\">jaded@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Something else is their apparent psychic connection with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the planet.  I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mean, seriously, you&#39;re completely across the zone from the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; thing and it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; will still know where you&#39;re at, even if you&#39;re far under<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ground and it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; top side _and_ all the way on the other side of the zone make its<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; way to you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; through maze or &#39;high water&#39; and begin pounding the snot<br/>\n&gt; &gt; out of you&lt;&lt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If there&#39;s one thing that does need to be fixed, it is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; this. You can&#39;t run<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; away from anyone unless you&#39;ve cast some spell that slows<br/>\n&gt; &gt; your enemy down.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; On top of that, they don&#39;t stop unless you zone or they&#39;re killed by<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; somebody. It&#39;d be nice if the game had a LOS variable for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; monsters that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; figured whether or not they knew where you were at any given point.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; In Everfrost, my shaman character can outrun Ice Boned<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Skeletons and &#39;break<br/>\n&gt; &gt; their lock&#39; so they can&#39;t find/attack me. Of course, this is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; easier with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; SoW, but even without you can get away. OTOH, mammoths NEVER<br/>\n&gt; &gt; forget you....<br/>\n&gt; &gt; so maybe it depends on the creature?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sorry to apply shaman experience in the necro mailing list,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; but I have more<br/>\n&gt; &gt; experience in that world.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Congratulations to &quot;Trail Rider,&quot; our latest ONElist of the Week.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Visit our homepage and share with us how ONElist is changing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; YOUR life!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; This list is basically unmoderated.
