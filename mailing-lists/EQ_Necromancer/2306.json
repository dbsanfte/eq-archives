I&#39;d never go back.<br/>\nCorpse runs? Three day camps to complete a quest? Not for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d like to 2nd what Howler said about the tanks in DAoC.<br/>\nThey are not the primary damage dealers. They are meant to<br/>\nabsorb, block, parry damage. They also get a skill called<br/>\n&quot;protect&quot;, which acts as a detaunt on the person they place it<br/>\non. This keeps the Mobs smacking the guy in plate armor, and<br/>\nnot the caster or cleric in cloth or chain.<br/>\n<br/>\nArmsman in Albion do get a polearm ability which does tremendous<br/>\ndamage, but I don&#39;t see very many players going that route<br/>\ncurrently.  Polearms are slow, and you give up shields to do this.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thief type classes in DAoC are extremely fun to play. The<br/>\nInfiltrator class in Albion can do quite a bit of damage. In fact<br/>\nso much so, the clerics can have a full time job keeping them<br/>\nalive. I have a 45th level Armsman, and my friend plays a 49th<br/>\nlevel Inf, so I&#39;ve seen this personally. I can also put Guard on the<br/>\nInf, and block shots on him. This has saved his butt several times.<br/>\nSome Infs do spec in Dual Wield, they get several nice styles from<br/>\nthe skill.<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t had much fun in RvR, so I&#39;m waiting for 50th to really<br/>\ngive it a good try.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother good site is www.classesofcamelot.com<br/>\n<br/>\nKeltan<br/>\n45th armsman, Iseult.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Howler D.

They<br/>\nare<br/>\n&gt; not meant to be MEGA damage dealers, they are meant to absorb/block/parry<br/>\n&gt; damage.  There are other classes that are REALLY good at laying the smack<br/>\n&gt; down, but at the cost of giving up some defensive capability.  Beserkers,<br/>\n&gt; Mercenaries and Blademasters are REALLY good at smacking the living tar<br/>\nout<br/>\n&gt; of something, but they also will take more damage by default.  These<br/>\nclasses<br/>\n&gt; are also known as dual wielding classes. While other classes like the<br/>\n&gt; Nightshade, Infiltrator, Shadowblade, Ranger and Scout get a form of dual<br/>\n&gt; wield, they typically do not spec in it. The exception being the<br/>\nShadowblade<br/>\n&gt; (I LOVE this class after my bard)  Instead of getting dual wield,<br/>\n&gt; Shadowblades get a skill called leftaxe or LA for short. Dual Wield<br/>\n(Albion)<br/>\n&gt; and Celtic Dual (Hibernia) work differently than LA.  Dual wield has a<br/>\n&gt; chance to trigger, when it does trigger and it does hit, it hits for max<br/>\n&gt; damage. With LA, it swings EVERYTIME, when it hits it does a percentage of<br/>\n&gt; the max damage. So while you swing all the time when you hit its partial<br/>\n&gt; damage...which is still VERY good.  Its usually only a few points off of<br/>\nmy<br/>\n&gt; main weapon damage, because I keep it pretty high.  Midgard is the only<br/>\n&gt; realm that gets LA. Shadowblades, and Beserkers get LA.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So as you can see it depends on how you wish to play.  There are other<br/>\ntank<br/>\n&gt; classes that you should also look at.  I really like the Midgard Thane.<br/>\nThe<br/>\n&gt; thane gets a nice AOE DD spell that smacks big ole hammers on thy enemies,<br/>\n&gt; as well as a point blank AOE instant on a 20 second timer, a single DD<br/>\n&gt; instant on a 20second timer, a castable DD and a STR/CON buff.  The<br/>\nweakside<br/>\n&gt; is they are a bit light on the HP, but are a TON of fun to play.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You may also want to checkout a Champion in Hibernia. I have a Lurikeen<br/>\n&gt; large weapon champ and he is soooooo cool. He is similar to the thane yet<br/>\n&gt; different. Instead of DD he gets some nasty debuffs and a nasty DD<br/>\ninstant.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Basically what you may want to do is to go to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://daoc.catacombs.com\">http://daoc.catacombs.com</a><br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; checkout the spell lists and style lists for the classes you wish to<br/>\n&gt; checkout. They also have some decent class discussion forums there. I read<br/>\n&gt; them quite often.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I know this is a bit of a long winded E-mail, but there is a lot to know<br/>\n&gt; about the various classes. I&#39;ve personally found something to like in<br/>\nevery<br/>\n&gt; class as well as something not to like.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you would like to know more about a certain class and specing please<br/>\nlet<br/>\n&gt; me know.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks<br/>\n&gt; Oskar<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Stuart Thomson&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Stuart@...\">Stuart@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@yahoogroups.com\">EQ_Necromancer@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, February 20, 2003 4:52 AM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [EQ_Necromancer] just joined<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Howler,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I ordered it yesterday with the expansion and should get it Friday :)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Just one question, Whats the best warrior type class to play?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Howler D.

I quit EQ well over a year ago.  Personally, I REALLY like<br/>\n&gt; it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I will be honest and say that I&#39;m not really fond of the dungeons that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; originally came with DAoC. They were weak at best. However, the new<br/>\n&gt; dungeons<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in the expansion are much better and much more EQ like. I always felt<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; &gt; EQ&#39;s dungeons were fairly well designed and they only got better with<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; expansions.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; With that said, the main attraction for me is the Realm vs. Realm<br/>\ncombat.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Taking keeps and jacking relics is a total blast!  I have noticed that<br/>\nmy<br/>\n&gt; &gt; friends that have tried DAoC have started on what we call the &quot;Co-op&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; server. Basically, these are like EQ style servers and are PvE<br/>\n&gt; only...pretty<br/>\n&gt; &gt; boring if you ask me.  Give a regular server a chance and I think you<br/>\nwill<br/>\n&gt; &gt; like the way RvR is done. You won&#39;t have someone in your home town gank<br/>\n&gt; you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; or people from other realms raiding newbie areas. Its just not setup<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; &gt; way.  If you play on a PvP server its a different story.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; RvR in my book is just awesome.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; If you have any questions please feel free to ask. I will be glad to<br/>\nhelp<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you out as much as I can. DAoC isnt perfect by any stretch, but it<br/>\nreally<br/>\n&gt; &gt; suits me and my play style.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -Oskar<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 44th Level Hibernian Bard Extrordinare<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Gathering of Ancients<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Palomides<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Stuart Thomson&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Stuart@...\">Stuart@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@yahoogroups.com\">EQ_Necromancer@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Wednesday, February 19, 2003 5:13 AM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: RE: [EQ_Necromancer] just joined<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyone know if Dark age of Camelot is any good?
