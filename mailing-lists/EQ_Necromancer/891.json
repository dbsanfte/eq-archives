This spot is &quot;safe&quot; in that trains will pass<br/>\nyou by as long as the mob isn&#39;t ticked at you personally, and you can sit<br/>\nand med there in relative peace.  It&#39;s not safe if : 1) someone trains<br/>\nsomething right through there and the mob notices you...it may not jump off<br/>\nwho it&#39;s chasing, but it will come back for you once said person zones, I<br/>\nonly experienced this once, and needless to say, i had words with the fellow<br/>\nthat did it, usually not a problem.  2) you are training something to the<br/>\nzone, it&#39;s not an exploit spot where mobs can&#39;t reach you, just a relatively<br/>\nsafe place to rest up for your next fight.  Getting down to business, my<br/>\nusual routine for lavastorm consisted of this:  enter zone, go to my safe<br/>\nspot and cast my pet, buff/med etc to get ready to fight.  do a /pet guard<br/>\nhere.  Then I wander out and find something I think I can kill.  Once I spot<br/>\nmy prey I would cast darkness on it then hightail it back to my pet.  Once<br/>\nback, the mob would be a ways back (unless he resisted the darkness, which<br/>\nas you know happens about half the time) tell my pet to attack, hit it with<br/>\ndisease cloud to stop healing and then hit it with a poison bolt.  Then if<br/>\nthe mob wasn&#39;t ticked off at me by then I would med, otherwise engage in<br/>\nmelee until the pet did more damage and I could step back.  Then I would<br/>\njust monitor my pets health (boy do I wish /pet report health had been<br/>\nimplemented then...) If he started getting dangerously low, I would stand<br/>\nback up and melee some more.  During down time I would use dark pact, unless<br/>\nI was really messed up healthwise, this spell I overlooked at first, it<br/>\ndidn&#39;t seem very useful.  But for the solo necro (or even the group minded)<br/>\nit can be a real downtime killer.  This formula worked for me very well as I<br/>\nsaid, I got to lvl 16 rather quickly.  You can stay after lvl 16, but I had<br/>\nbecome weary of the area and moved on in search of new thrills.   As always,<br/>\nthe strategies here may give you mixed results, just passing on the<br/>\nknowledge that took me a while to figure out in hopes that someone else can<br/>\nput it to good use, or improve upon it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the gypsies are concerned, I have no idea what faction element<br/>\nthey are, but if someone knows (if they have faction at all...) I&#39;d *love*<br/>\nto hear it, as I&#39;m in S Karana right now, and going to Ogguk to get<br/>\nfood/water and dump my loot is getting pretty tedious.  (I pretty much hosed<br/>\nmy Qeynos faction the other day when I decided I wanted revenge on Holly<br/>\nWindstalker more than I wanted good Qeynos faction...but that&#39;s another<br/>\nstory) ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Grizumpy Bloodmaw<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: johnathan spectre &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jspectre@...\">jspectre@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, July 06, 1999 4:21 PM<br/>\nSubject: [EQ_Necromancer] Oh yeah..

I guess because it&#39;s fire based (?). My best DOT and I can&#39;t<br/>\nuse<br/>\n&gt; it.. So I have to stick with Engulfing Darkness (resisted 50% of the time)<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; Poison Bolt (resisted 20% of the time). Also started using Vampiric<br/>\nEmbrace<br/>\n&gt; because I&#39;m always getting into melee, but I have only seen it go off once<br/>\nin<br/>\n&gt; like 20 battles. Finally bought Lifedraw too (now that I&#39;m making money)<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; what a great spell over the lower one. 41pts of damage makes a big<br/>\ndifference<br/>\n&gt; in this zone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Check out this week&#39;s ONElist of the week.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; How is ONElist changing YOUR life?
