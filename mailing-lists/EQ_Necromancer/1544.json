Also will they deal with me, as i am a gnome<br/>\n&gt;not a dark elf? ANy general and more specific info would be appreciated -<br/>\n&gt;Malados lvl 15 gnoem necro on solusek ro server<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;This list is basically unmoderated.
