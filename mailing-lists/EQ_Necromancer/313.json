So far its the<br/>\nbest approximation of our mana level.  I&#39;ve tried it out roughly and its<br/>\npretty damn close.  Eventually if I get bored enough I&#39;ll actually attempt<br/>\nto see how close it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nMax mana = ((INT/5)+2) * level  + magic items<br/>\n<br/>\nLet&#39;s take a look at me.<br/>\n<br/>\nINT = 127<br/>\nLevel = 16<br/>\nCarrying one Runed Totem Staff and two Jaded Silver Rings(magical) for a<br/>\ntotal of +15 mana<br/>\n<br/>\nINT/5 = 25 (I&#39;m pretty sure its rounded down)<br/>\n<br/>\nmax mana = 27*16 + 15 = 447<br/>\n<br/>\nWith a crappy number like that I&#39;ll never know FOR SURE, but with testing I<br/>\ncan come within five mana of an answer.  Eventually I&#39;ll do this since level<br/>\n17 is so far away (died twice in fifteen minutes, how lame)<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce again I&#39;m no sure of the usefulness of the other attributes either.<br/>\nMore and more people are subscribing to the &quot;dump all yer bonus points into<br/>\nINT&quot; role because DEX seems to have some kind of effect on casting.  I was<br/>\nthinking of creating a mage with all points in DEX to see if I could see any<br/>\nVISIBLE affect on casting time and interruptions, but again, I don&#39;t care<br/>\nall that much, having fun with my current char.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne suggestion I do make simply for efficieny is to make all you numbers in<br/>\nmultiples of FIVE.  Apparently Verant likes multiple of 5.  Yu can imagine<br/>\nmy irritation when I found that out and had an INT of 124.  But now I found<br/>\na necklace so I&#39;m better.<br/>\n<br/>\nMalark on Karana<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:TkAdam@...\">TkAdam@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:TkAdam@...\">TkAdam@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, May 10, 1999 8:50 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EQ_Necromancer] Fw: [EQMagicians] Just a thought..<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:TkAdam@...\">TkAdam@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 5/10/99 9:42:06 AM Eastern Daylight Time, <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JuanC@...\">JuanC@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; and if you are hardcore you can<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  calculate it with the mana calculator and divide it by <br/>\n&gt; five to see how much<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  mana you have per bubble.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Could someone repeat the mana &quot;calculator&quot; ?
