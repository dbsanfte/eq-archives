How","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-167955116\">Its still hotly debated.  Basically as far as anyone knows, the only<br/>\nthing DEX does is increase your ability to recover while spellcasting, and<br/>\nTHAT&#39;S IT.  How important is this?  No clue, I haven&#39;t researched this<br/>\nextensively.  Basically if this is the case then you probably don&#39;t need<br/>\nmuch DEX.  The REAL primary attribute is INT, through and through.  INT<br/>\ndirectly affects how much mana you have, thus how much longer you stay in<br/>\nthe field before meditating.  We&#39;ve discussed this before, but basically<br/>\nhaving as much INT as possible is probably the best way to go.  After that,<br/>\ndumping your remaining points is up to you.  You aren&#39;t a fighter, so<br/>\nputting points into Agility seems useless, most monsters will be hitting you<br/>\nand hitting you hard anyway.  Same goes for Stamina, you&#39;ll never have the<br/>\nhitpoints of even a Rogue, so seriously what&#39;s another hitpoint per level?<br/>\nSay you&#39;re level 25 and have 25 extra hitpoints?  Well sadly level 25<br/>\nmonsters are probably doing close to 40-90 points of damage per hit anyway,<br/>\nso MAYBE one more hit.  Don&#39;t get hit.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI might say its more important for wizards as they don&#39;t have pets,<br/>\nbut they should be in groups anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBasically I know one solid thing.  Multiples of 5 in your INT is<br/>\ngood and the more you can get the better you are.  If you are looking at a<br/>\nchoice between a +3 AGI item and a +1 INT item you should take the INT item.<br/>\nThere are many  INT increasing items in the game for virtually all armor<br/>\nslots garnering you probably more than 20 more INT points, which is 4 more<br/>\nmana per level (and at level 25, that would equate to having another 100<br/>\nmana to play with)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tHit the INT hard, then dump whatever you have left somewhere, heck,<br/>\nmaybe in STRENGTH so you can carry more.<br/>\n<br/>\nMalark on Karana<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Mata [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mata_eq@...\">mata_eq@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, May 19, 1999 8:47 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [EQ_Necromancer] DEX ???<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy is dex our main attrib beside INT if we rarely go hand to hand?<br/>\n(I know we have a touch spell, but most people say that is more for<br/>\nshadowknights)<br/>\n<br/>\nI am mad I put my extra (after maxing int) points into dex now when I read a<br/>\nmillion posts now that say Dex is useless.<br/>\n<br/>\nI mean from all I&#39;ve read AGILITY is 100 times better for any caster!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease say it ain&#39;t so, and that my 100 dex (gnome) isn&#39;t a big frekin&#39;<br/>\nwaste . . .</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
