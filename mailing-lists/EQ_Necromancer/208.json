I&#39;ll just say, I&#39;m<br/>\nrather disapointed that Umbral Messenger was removed.  I was somewhat<br/>\nlooking forward to that.  Ah wells, besides that, pets respond to commands<br/>\nat double the distance of before now, as it states.  I post this for future<br/>\nreference, and, you&#39;d be surprised how many people are not aware of the<br/>\nmanual.* files.  Here you go folks:<br/>\n<br/>\n==========<br/>\n<br/>\nRemoved<br/>\n<br/>\nEnchantment of Light<br/>\nEnchantment of Brilliance<br/>\nWinged Courier<br/>\nUmbral Messenger  **********<br/>\nDetect Magic<br/>\n<br/>\nRecent Spell Changes<br/>\n<br/>\nSentinel (Enchanter Spell) - the duration has been increased.<br/>\n<br/>\nMinor Illusion (Enchanter Spell) - a maximum size has been placed on objects<br/>\nthat your illusion will copy.<br/>\n<br/>\nMelanie&#39;s Mellifluous Motion (Bard) - this song will now effect your entire<br/>\nparty, not just you.<br/>\n<br/>\nDivine Barrier (Cleric) - This spell will no longer reverse your movement<br/>\ncommands.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe range at which a pet will respond to your commands has been doubled.<br/>\n**********<br/>\n<br/>\nMisty Gate (Druid) has been added to the appropriate Druid Vendor.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Clinging Darkness Series (Necromancer) will last longer on targets.<br/>\n**********<br/>\n<br/>\nShadow Knights have had two changes made to their spell list.  The 39th<br/>\nlevel Banshee Aura has been<br/>\nchanged to Shield Skin, and the 49th level Boil Blood has been replaced with<br/>\nDooming Darkness.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe recasting time on many Enchanter spells has been reduced.<br/>\n<br/>\nResearch components - the % frequency of research components found in the<br/>\ngame has been increased by<br/>\n300%.<br/>\n<br/>\nVampiric Embrace (Necromancer and Shadow Knight) - Once cast, this spell<br/>\ngives you a chance of<br/>\ndraining HP from your target every time you attack.  Formally, this spell<br/>\nadded to your attack roll.  *********<br/>\n<br/>\n==========<br/>\n<br/>\n    I&#39;m wondering if I waisted my three plat on V.Embrace.  It doesn&#39;t last<br/>\nlong and this doesn&#39;t say anything about it being usable with weapons as I&#39;d<br/>\nheard in-game.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Myskyra / Tunare</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
