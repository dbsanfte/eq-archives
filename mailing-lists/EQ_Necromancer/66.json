It still took a long<br/>\ntime because I died often, but it was better then camping at Lrodd or<br/>\nattempting to work the West Commons.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The bad thing is, Verant changed the pet spell.  The rank 4 <br/>\n&gt; (level 12) pet <br/>\n&gt; spell summons a pet that ranges from 8 to 12, not 11 to 13 <br/>\n&gt; like it should...  <br/>\n&gt; So you can STILL often get useless pets.  (the last time I <br/>\n&gt; summoned I had to <br/>\n&gt; cast 6 times to get a pet that did not con green to me)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>\tOh yes, this was most surprising.  At level 12 I rarely saw a white<br/>\nconned skeleton, and now as 13 I rarely get a blue dangerous.  This is<br/>\nirritating as well because apparently your pet can only hit magically IF it<br/>\nis of higher level than the monster it is hitting... thus your level 8-10<br/>\nskeleton can&#39;t hit a level 11 wisp.
