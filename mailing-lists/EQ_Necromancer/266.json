What<br/>\ndoes that mean?  The only things I&#39;ve seen were<br/>\n<br/>\n\tGreen, green risky, blue, blue risky, white, yellow, red.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve never seen a black con I don&#39;t think.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSkeletons gain levels just like monsters do (though they certainly<br/>\ndon&#39;t do the same damage).  Meaning they eventually get kick, bash, hit<br/>\nmagically, probably double attack and dual wield as well.  Whenever I get a<br/>\nlvl 12 skeleton with Convoke Shadow He can bash and hit magically, level 11<br/>\nhe can&#39;t hit magically but can still bash.  I&#39;ve seen a level 16 pet kick so<br/>\nI know that&#39;s what they get at level 16.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWhere would I gain XP?  At level 9?  Grab a fellow Necromancer and<br/>\ncamp Skeleton Lrodd at Befallen.  He&#39;s often overlooked by the higher levels<br/>\nbecause he&#39;s in a lame place.  He&#39;s tough single, but you could do it if you<br/>\nwere lucky.  I would just hammer him then run around and kill all the first<br/>\nlevel skels for loot and bone chips, then meditate and kill him again.  I<br/>\nwould also steer clear of trains, but sometimes try to drag off a mummy or<br/>\nzombie.  This is done by watching the train go past (but stay away), select<br/>\na monster, hit it with Ward, then run into an unused room away from the<br/>\nreturning train.  Almost always just the monster you pissed off will come<br/>\nafter you unless you cast too close to the group.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBefallen was basically the thing that moved me from 8 to 12 with<br/>\nhard work.  With your crappy 4th level spells pretty much anything else just<br/>\nlaughs at you, though I still use Poison Bolt as a small damage spell.<br/>\n<br/>\nMalark<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Tony B [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tonyb72@...\">tonyb72@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Friday, May 07, 1999 8:17 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EQ_Necromancer] Arrrgh!
