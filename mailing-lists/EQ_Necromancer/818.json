Horde then kill or reverse. With this strategy, (which I don&#39;t like) you<br/>\nkill EASY stuff with good loot to get your spell money while leveling off<br/>\ngreat exp stuff whith no loot. I was able to get 45 platinums fighting in<br/>\nLavastorm going from lev 16-18th. The experience was slowing down but there<br/>\nwere still a lot of risky blues that I was able to find and money was good.<br/>\nI now have enough I could fight lootless monsters until I reach 20th buy my<br/>\nspells and repeat. Also you can make money fairly fast killing darkweed<br/>\nsnakes in east commons and selling the fangs. A good lev 16 spell pet and<br/>\nsolo a darkweed and only lose 15% or so of its health. So you can kill them<br/>\nat will and most players are not hunting them so they are all over.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.) Find stuff that is good exp and good loot that is not over camped. I<br/>\nhave found east karana to be such a place.<br/>\n<br/>\nMonsters in east karana.<br/>\nCyclops, griffons, Broon, Droon, and Proon. (RUN FROM THESE).<br/>\nEvil Eye and Crag Spiders - Will prob be yellow - red to a lev 17. Not sure<br/>\nevil eye loot but spiders have silk for a few gold each. Get up to 4 silk on<br/>\n1 spider.<br/>\nGriffawns - These will by white and have a few gold feather on them often.<br/>\ngorge hounds, spirt wolves, undead revears, gnoll revears, spirt wolves,<br/>\nsomekinda stalker (looks like wolf) These should all be risky blue to white.<br/>\nThe gnoll revears often have 4 gold and a piece of raw-hide armor that<br/>\naverages about 6 gold. So you can easily get 1 plat off a good gnoll revear.<br/>\nAt lev 18 I could solo anything but the evil eyes and crag spiders with no<br/>\nkiting. Though lots of this stuff groups so you do much better with 1<br/>\npartner or 2.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I earned another 20 plats or going from 18th - 19th there over the last<br/>\n3 nights. Since I now have over 60plats for my next level spells I will<br/>\nprobably go to south karana with a friend or 2 and kill stuff that gives<br/>\ngood exp and no loot.<br/>\nThe only big problem you will have is that you will not be able to sell in<br/>\neast karana. You will need to get a friend to do it for you. Or you can go<br/>\nto BB or Paw and spend about 6-8 hrs I hear to get your faction up with the<br/>\nkarana&#39;s residents.<br/>\n<br/>\nI play in the evenings lots and always welcome the company of a fellow<br/>\nnecromancer. So if you see me on, and want to group, let me know as I find<br/>\nsoloing to be somewhat boring.<br/>\n<br/>\n...
