It is a rare spawn, but not as bad as the BBC or Gossimer Robe I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; think.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; As for Pending Lore, I do not know.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;It&#39;s been a lore item all along. :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;as far as being rare, my monk friend got 6 of them in the time he was<br/>\n&gt;looking for barbed leggings for a cleric.  definitely not as rare as the<br/>\n&gt;robe/bbc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;one of the cool things about it is, you can put it in your ranged weapon<br/>\n&gt;slot, and still carry your glowing crook/runed totem or what have you.<br/>\n&gt;Since the dagger is only 3 dmg it&#39;s mostly sought after for the magical<br/>\n&gt;additions to your stats. (+5 int and some mana I believe, I&#39;ll have to <br/>\n&gt;check<br/>\n&gt;next time I&#39;m in game) by carrying it in the ranged slot, you still get<br/>\n&gt;those benefits, without having to downgrade your melee damage severely.  Of<br/>\n&gt;course if you aren&#39;t using a magical weapon already, by all means put it in<br/>\n&gt;the primary melee slot.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
