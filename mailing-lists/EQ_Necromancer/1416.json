It&#39;s fists have a natural speed of<br/>\n30, and the natural damage obviously goes up as you<br/>\nget higher level skeletons. Verant chose to make the<br/>\npets have a huge advantage when wielding weapons. The<br/>\ngame looks at the both the natural speed/damage and<br/>\nthe weapon speed/damage and uses the better values.<br/>\nThus, if you give a level 1 skeleton that does 4 pts<br/>\nof damage a scythe with damage 12 and delay of 50, it<br/>\nwill attack at speed 30 with damage of 12. If you give<br/>\na level 49 skeleton a damage 3 fs dagger of delay 21,<br/>\nit will attack at speed of 21 with the natural damage<br/>\nof 50. Level 12-16 is when the skeleton does more<br/>\ndamage with its fists then with large weapons. This is<br/>\nwhen you start giving it daggers so it attacks faster.<br/>\nBottom line:<br/>\nLevel 12 and below pets, give them 2h weapons so their<br/>\ndamage is much greater while attacking at delay of 30.<br/>\nLevel 16 and above pets you give any weapon that has a<br/>\ndelay of less then 30 to speed it up while keeping the<br/>\ngreat natural damage.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, dual wielding, you can not give two of the same<br/>\nweapon to a pet. The pet will think it has only one<br/>\nweapon. So you give it a rusty dagger and a tarnished<br/>\ndagger. Also, dual wielding skeletons come at level 29<br/>\nand above. <br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkmoon Somberlight <br/>\nQuellious Server<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:TkAdam@...\">TkAdam@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In a message dated 10/25/99 7:43:58 PM Eastern<br/>\n&gt; Daylight Time, <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dicey@...\">dicey@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I thought that at 16th level and above you should<br/>\n&gt; not give your pet a weapon<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  because he did more damage barehanded.
