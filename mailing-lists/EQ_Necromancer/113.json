This<br/>\nwas done at level 9 by a bard, the only part of caution will be a couple KOS<br/>\nplaces. This is from a Gnomish Necromancers perspective.<br/>\n<br/>\nStarting out in Qeynos you leave to the Karanas. You hang to your left all<br/>\nthe way. Once you reach the bridge you go to your left again. You might want<br/>\nto watch out for the Cyclops fisherman adn the druids. But once you get in<br/>\nthe hills stay up in them as much as possible to the left. Keep going and<br/>\nyou will reach beholders maze. In the maze you stay to the right UP ON the<br/>\nwall as much as possible. Go slow and don&#39;t rush. Many a peopl ehave fallen<br/>\nto their demise. IT is good to be invis all this time also. Once you go far<br/>\nenough along the right wall. You will reach the entrance to RunnyEye<br/>\nCitadel. In there stay to the left wall and you will come out in Misty<br/>\nThicket. In misty Thicket I Would recommend going straight forward until you<br/>\nfind the wall. You should stay invisable especailly at this time because<br/>\nthere are guards in this area. You will pass through a gate in this stone<br/>\nfence and follow the road, taking the left fork. You will come to a tunnel.<br/>\nThis will lead to riverdale. Go invisable before entering Riverdale, as they<br/>\nwill kill you. Though if you want you can kill a lot of goblins in the area<br/>\nand your faction will eventually get good enough to enter without<br/>\ninvisability. But once in river dale find the entrance. I remeber it as head<br/>\nright around the big circle building and there is a gnomish lady selling<br/>\nstuff in a stand and I go down the path right before her. Not that that will<br/>\nhelp on other servers. But hey Always check out those maps on Stratics. Well<br/>\nonce you get out of riverdale you will be in Kithicor forest. Stay to the<br/>\nleft  and keep following the wall. This zone is fairly harmless, however I<br/>\nam not sure how all of the inhabitance will react. Some are friendly to me.<br/>\nThere are also large animals I believe, and they will probably be<br/>\naggressive. Now once you zone, you will be in The Commonlands. You should<br/>\nrun along the road, dodging hill giants. OR you can stay to the left a bit<br/>\nand you should miss them. However beware of along the left wall there are<br/>\nDervish camps and undead shrines. Bewarned, so you don&#39;t stumble on them. If<br/>\nyou stay near the left you keep going, oh beware the druid shrines also that<br/>\nare near the dervish camp and near the teleport gate. They have something<br/>\nagainst necromancers. Well stay to the left and eventually you will zone<br/>\ninto the other commonlands. Keep going and you will come to a zone to the<br/>\nleft. Do not go into there unless you want to go to the Nektulous forest.<br/>\nKeep going and you will run into a vast waste land. Keep going and you will<br/>\nzone into West Freeport. From their I am sure you can find th egates.  Good<br/>\nluck..<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Shadow Panther &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shdwpanther@...\">shdwpanther@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, April 27, 1999 3:20 PM<br/>\nSubject: [EQ_Necromancer] ∩┐╜Freeport∩┐╜ =)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Shadow Panther&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shdwpanther@...\">shdwpanther@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     Hello, folks,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;         I&#39;ve tried to get my Necro off to Free port about two, three times<br/>\n&gt; now.  I get completely lost in High Hold Keep and end up wondering the<br/>\nsame<br/>\n&gt; halls and turns for about an hour or so before I gate back.  Could any of<br/>\n&gt; you give the directions to go, to get _out_ the other side of that flaming<br/>\n&gt; place?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;         Also, do the guards kill you on sight?  I&#39;m constantly invis or<br/>\n&gt; finding a room to recast it before it runs out, just in case. :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     Thanks for any help,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ~Myskyra / Tunare<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; New hobbies?
