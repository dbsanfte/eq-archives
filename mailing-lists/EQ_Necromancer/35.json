All you do is go to the<br/>\nONEList web site &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a>&gt; and sign in with your E-Mail<br/>\naddress and password.  You&#39;ll see a list of the Mailing Lists that you&#39;re<br/>\nsubscribed too.  In this case, click on the EQ_Necromancer list and you&#39;ll<br/>\nbe taken to a page with various options:<br/>\n<br/>\n            View Archives (Missed an old message or curious what&#39;s been said<br/>\npreviously?)<br/>\n<br/>\n            Calendar (Shows special events taking place for members of the<br/>\nlist or about the list that may be of interst to you/us)<br/>\n<br/>\n            **Bookmarks (This is what I&#39;m writing about. Go here & choose<br/>\nAdd a Bookmark. Enter the URL & Description.<br/>\n            Click &quot;Add&quot;.)<br/>\n<br/>\n            Survey (If the moderator has created any surveys for the list,<br/>\nit can be taken here as well as results viewed)<br/>\n<br/>\n            Shared Files (any files of interest to the members of this<br/>\ngroup)<br/>\n<br/>\n            Member Profiles (See the profiles of the members of this Mailing<br/>\nList)<br/>\n<br/>\n        If when finding a good URL or giving one to the list as a<br/>\nrecommendation, you add it here as well, this could become a _very_ useful<br/>\nand resourceful Mailing List indeed.  The other areas could be very useful<br/>\nthings, as well.  Calandar could be good for Necro only meetings in<br/>\nEverQuest, Survey perhaps could be used to vote on which Necro only (such as<br/>\nthose spells or quest) bugs need fixed the most then we could all each<br/>\nsubmit a single bug report about it next time we&#39;re online, Shared Files<br/>\ncould be useful..um.. well I don&#39;t know.  Text files for huge spoilers?<br/>\nThat way members of the list who don&#39;t even want to take a chance of reading<br/>\none, wont have to.  I wouldn&#39;t use it for screen-shots, though, as those<br/>\ntend to be large and I&#39;m not sure how much space is allocated to the<br/>\nmoderator of this list.<br/>\n<br/>\n        Of course, any info submitted there I think should also be submitted<br/>\nto the list (_perhaps_ minus the spoilers).  It takes a couple more minutes,<br/>\nbut could really make the list quite useful and interactive...as well as<br/>\nmaking it easier to keep track of the links and point newbies to the list<br/>\n(not that I&#39;m not;) to all of the good and interesting Necro URL&#39;s (links).<br/>\n<br/>\n        Moderator could probably explain these options better, or correct me<br/>\nif I&#39;m wrong on any of them.  Also, of course never ever send your password<br/>\nto the list. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n    Have a good one folks!,<br/>\n~Myskyra / Tunare</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
