At<br/>\nyour level you will have moved up to the goblin<br/>\nscouts and will soon be in the mammoth calf range<br/>\n(with a large group). However, check your faction<br/>\nwith the barbarian guards. It would be impossible<br/>\nto have any fun there if you are KOS.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther ideas would include BB and west Karana. In<br/>\nBB you are up to gnoll level (say away from<br/>\npatrolling, burly, guards, guardsmen, elites and<br/>\ncommanders ... but move up from left to right on<br/>\nthat list as you gain levels). By level 9, start<br/>\nhitting the giant snakes. You and your pet should<br/>\njust be able to solo one. These will take you to<br/>\nlevel 12 or more. By that time, either group for<br/>\nthe bigger BB kills or move to Splitpaw in South<br/>\nKarana. It&#39;s the same old gnoll thing but the<br/>\nnobles have nice loot, as well as the gnoll<br/>\nshamans. I found west Karana way too boring and if<br/>\nyou aren&#39;t a tailor ... what&#39;s the point of<br/>\nkilling the bears and lions? The loot stinks.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou CAN make levels over there and keep hanging<br/>\nwith friends, but the post about going to Freeport<br/>\nis correct. It&#39;s a little easier and there is a<br/>\nbetter monster per person ratio there. Don&#39;t even<br/>\nthink of it until level 8 unless you&#39;ve made the<br/>\ntrip before, or you have a guide. At level 8 at<br/>\nleast you can use gather shadows and wander<br/>\nsomewhat in order to find the zone points. When<br/>\nyou reach 8th, make a post here I&#39;ll be glad to<br/>\ngive you directions for a trip across should you<br/>\nwant to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck either way.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Haytred<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBlack Sheep wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I am a level 6 necro playing in the Qeynos Hills<br/>\n&gt; outside of BB.  While I am making good xp and<br/>\n&gt; cant complain, I am beginning to reach the point<br/>\n&gt; where the XP out there is low.  Does anyone have<br/>\n&gt; any suggestions where a Human Necromancer can go<br/>\n&gt; to level from 6-8, 8-12, 12-16, and 16-20?  I<br/>\n&gt; know BB is a good source of XP and loot, but it<br/>\n&gt; is usually crowded and there are trains which is<br/>\n&gt; never good for a caster, especially in such a<br/>\n&gt; small area (running room wise).  Are the Karanas<br/>\n&gt; available at that level?  With where I placed<br/>\n&gt; myself, am I stuck there till a later level?<br/>\n&gt; How can we change our factions so, while the<br/>\n&gt; guards can sneer at us and call us names, they<br/>\n&gt; will leave us alone in other towns such as<br/>\n&gt; Rivervale or Freeport or even Halas?  While I am<br/>\n&gt; sure this is something that has been covered<br/>\n&gt; time and again on this list and I apologize for<br/>\n&gt; redundency, any info would be greatly<br/>\n&gt; appreciated.
