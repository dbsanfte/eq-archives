Shields also when you are wellfunded.  After that I don&#39;t see a<br/>\nreason, but there&#39;s a large debate on whether or not this is good or not.<br/>\nBasically if you have spares and don&#39;t need the cash, go ahead. Just<br/>\nremember on nonPvP (and usually very difficult on PvP) that you won&#39;t be<br/>\ngetting your weapon back, so don&#39;t be giving your skel a Combine Dagger or<br/>\nanything expensive.<br/>\n<br/>\nMalark on Karana<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Mata [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mata_eq@...\">mata_eq@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, May 18, 1999 12:53 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [EQ_Necromancer] WEAPONS for my PET<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone given any swords or anything to your pets?   I was thinking about<br/>\ntrying to save up for a Mino Axe if you can get the axe back after your skel<br/>\nis killed.   Otherwise I don&#39;t think I will use weapons.  Or is it more<br/>\ndamage??<br/>\n<br/>\nAny info on weapons for your pets would be GREAT!
