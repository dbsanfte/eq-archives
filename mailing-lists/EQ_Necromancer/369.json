I was thinking of starting a character there, but I have heard both positive and negative things about the server.  Does it differ a lot from the regular servers, besides anyone can kill you within 4 levels?  Do you still have the evil races grouping with the good races or do they tend to group among their own race?  How is the rampant Pk situation, human killing other humans etc..??  Sorry for all the questions but I&#39;m getting bored with fighting NPCs on E&#39;ci and I think being able to fight the goodie goodies would spice it up a lot.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI was also thinking of joining a guild and participating in guildwars but I haven&#39;t heard of any guilds doing that and what I see, all the guilds are letting every race/class in.  Which, IMHO isn&#39;t RP at all.  Even if the &quot;evil&quot; character claims that he has turned good.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Kilven (E&#39;ci)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
