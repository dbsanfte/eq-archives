It can be better to be 2nd best in<br/>\n&gt; several things then best in one and worst in another.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; More specifically, and the post by GZ even says as much, the <br/>\n&gt; necro&#39;s pet has<br/>\n&gt; more hitpoints then a fire, air or water elemental but less <br/>\n&gt; then an earth<br/>\n&gt; elemental. They also have better AC then a earth, fire or <br/>\n&gt; water elemental<br/>\n&gt; but less then an AIR elemental. GZ even says that magi should <br/>\n&gt; use a Air<br/>\n&gt; elemental to SOLO as value of high AC becomes more and more <br/>\n&gt; important at<br/>\n&gt; higher levels as it causes the MOBS to hit for less damage <br/>\n&gt; and miss more.<br/>\n&gt; Since an Earth elemental has the worst AC of any pet it gets <br/>\n&gt; mauled at higer<br/>\n&gt; levels for max damage just about every swing. This means a dead earth<br/>\n&gt; elemental. Since the necromancer&#39;s pet has 2nd best HPS and <br/>\n&gt; 2nd best AC that<br/>\n&gt; COMBINATION makes them much better over all at higher levels <br/>\n&gt; then a mage<br/>\n&gt; pet.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am not very high level yet but so far my lev 7 necromancer <br/>\n&gt; has had it far<br/>\n&gt; easier with his pet then my lev 16 magician ever did at the <br/>\n&gt; same levels.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Veneficus (Rank 5) magician<br/>\n&gt; Eloric (Rank 2) necromancer<br/>\n&gt; Mythannial Marr<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; ONElist members are using Shared Files in great ways!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Are you?
