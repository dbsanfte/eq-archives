Actually anywhere where you can <br/>\n&gt;kill your opponent indirectly (like ROOTing someone underwater) is illegal <br/>\n&gt;because they don&#39;t classify that damage or something.  What does this mean? <br/>\n&gt;  A necromancer is virtually castrated.  NO DoT means no Darkness Spells, <br/>\n&gt;No Blood, Bo Heart Flutter, etc.  Its sucks really bad.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;             B) Faction on inter-racial PKing.  Basically this is player <br/>\n&gt;enforced.  You get a bad mark on your through players only but often this <br/>\n&gt;doesn&#39;t mean anything.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;             Some things I&#39;ve noticed or heard about.  Essentially the only <br/>\n&gt;place you are mostly safe is your own newbie area outside home, even then <br/>\n&gt;not much.  But in most open areas there&#39;s mostly an unspoken peace.  It is <br/>\n&gt;NOT the nightmare ambush world a lot of people are afraid of where you <br/>\n&gt;can&#39;t rest anywhere or anything.  Its bad sometimes, but for the most part <br/>\n&gt;you&#39;ll just see people giving each other a WIDE berth, with some groups of <br/>\n&gt;vigilantes running around.  Things are definitely more exciting, and <br/>\n&gt;advancing in the higher teens is often more difficult simply because your <br/>\n&gt;access to other areas is somewhat more difficult.  This is mostly on <br/>\n&gt;Antonica though.  If you start in Faydwer there&#39;s this nasty stuff going on <br/>\n&gt;between the Gnomes and Elves, but for the most part you are as safe as in <br/>\n&gt;nonPvP.  Erud is still as crappy as it ever is.  Most of the cool PvP stuff <br/>\n&gt;happens on Antonica.  It gnaws at me more and more to try out Rallos Zek, <br/>\n&gt;but I don&#39;t want to do it till they fix DoT spells and other assorted <br/>\n&gt;screwups.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;             Malark on Karana<br/>\n&gt;                 -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;                 From: Stuart Christian [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:stuartc@...\">stuartc@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;                 Sent: Tuesday, May 11, 1999 1:51 PM<br/>\n&gt;                 To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;                 Subject: [EQ_Necromancer] PVP<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;                 Does anyone play on Rallos Zek?  I was thinking of <br/>\n&gt;starting a character there, but I have heard both positive and negative <br/>\n&gt;things about the server.  Does it differ a lot from the regular servers, <br/>\n&gt;besides anyone can kill you within 4 levels?  Do you still have the evil <br/>\n&gt;races grouping with the good races or do they tend to group among their own <br/>\n&gt;race?  How is the rampant Pk situation, human killing other humans etc..??  <br/>\n&gt;Sorry for all the questions but I&#39;m getting bored with fighting NPCs on <br/>\n&gt;E&#39;ci and I think being able to fight the goodie goodies would spice it up a <br/>\n&gt;lot.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;                 I was also thinking of joining a guild and participating <br/>\n&gt;in guildwars but I haven&#39;t heard of any guilds doing that and what I see, <br/>\n&gt;all the guilds are letting every race/class in.  Which, IMHO isn&#39;t RP at <br/>\n&gt;all.  Even if the &quot;evil&quot; character claims that he has turned good.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;                 -Kilven (E&#39;ci)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
