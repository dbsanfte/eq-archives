Most of my friends are necro&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;in the game so we are all fighting for the same words. Or heaven for bid<br/>\n&gt;they might put words on vendors and just make the trade harder. I could <br/>\n&gt;live<br/>\n&gt;with that. If we could all put are heads together and do this as a group it<br/>\n&gt;could make a difference.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Also I am level 33 now and not very sure what to hunt again. hehehehe I <br/>\n&gt;have<br/>\n&gt;been kill druids for the past few levels.
