Three of them were red to<br/>\nme and one was yellow.  The only one that was yellow was the one that moves<br/>\naround a bit.  The Unkept druids that wander in the area were all still<br/>\ngreen and gave the same faction as before<br/>\n<br/>\nOf the three Red Druids, all three were red to the 45th warrior that was in<br/>\nmy group.  So yeah, I would say they got a slight level increase, since the<br/>\nwoman wood elf was blue to me at 30, now being red at 45th.<br/>\n<br/>\nLomack, Knight Defender of the BCK<br/>\nMaster of Recruiting<br/>\nwww.bck.org<br/>\n&quot;The Crimson Knights&quot;<br/>\nFennin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
