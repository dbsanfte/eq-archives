Perhaps the most accurate<br/>\nway to find out how much damage spell x does is to try it on the PVP<br/>\nserver...that way you can have a friend that you cast on relay exact numbers<br/>\nback.  Of course this requires an active PVP necro, do we have any of those<br/>\non the list?  Also, I believe the damage is not static, it depends on the<br/>\nlevel of the mob/player you cast on and their resistance levels to said<br/>\nmagic.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Murphy, Kenneth E. &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MurphyK@...\">MurphyK@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, May 27, 1999 11:15 AM<br/>\nSubject: [EQ_Necromancer] Is there any demand for this type of site?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Murphy, Kenneth E.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MurphyK@...\">MurphyK@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hello All<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am currently running both a magician and a necromancer. I personally am<br/>\n&gt; the type of person that would rather know where to go and how-to do things<br/>\n&gt; rather then taking months to figure it all out myself. This is mostly<br/>\n&gt; because I&#39;m busy in my RL with work, marriage etc, etc ... Thus, for me,<br/>\n&gt; just keeping up in levels near my friends is hard enough, much less<br/>\nrunning<br/>\n&gt; around everywhere trying to find everything myself.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There are a few things I find lacking in the main stream web sites info.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; A. The spell lists are out dated and don&#39;t provide the info I want. IE<br/>\nthey<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t say this spell does this damage for this manna, here is the ratio.<br/>\nIt<br/>\n&gt; takes this many secs to cast with the channeling skill maxed for the level<br/>\n&gt; you first receive the spell. The necro DOT does X damage a tick for X<br/>\nticks.<br/>\n&gt; I would find that kind of extra statistics helpful.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; B. Where do you buy the darn spell? No site I have found is attempting to<br/>\n&gt; keep a list of vendor locations and their inventory and pricing for some<br/>\n&gt; base charisma.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; C. The above info should be integrated to include if each spell is<br/>\nresearch<br/>\n&gt; only or not. The status of research for that spell. IE broken or not. And<br/>\nif<br/>\n&gt; not broken what are the components to make the spell, what book and what<br/>\n&gt; lang etc. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
