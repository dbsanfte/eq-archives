My zone time has been cut from nearly 2 minutes to about 30 seconds.  The connection speed helps x-fer any data dealing with non-static items in a given zone.  Your system power, is what puts the data on screen, so both would be equally important.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the Riva TNT 2, I wish I had gone with that over my VDIII.  It does rock!<br/>\n<br/>\nZarbon, 17th Necro E&#39;ci<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Nat Russo <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Wednesday, February 23, 2000 1:00 PM<br/>\n  Subject: RE: [EQ_Necromancer] Hope this isn&#39;t too OT..but<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  From: &quot;Nat Russo&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nrusso@...\">nrusso@...</a>&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Personally, I use a Diamond Viper V770D Ultra with 32 megs of video ram.  However, I&#39;ve noticed that the only thing that REALLY effects my zoning speed is my connection speed.  A friend of mine and I experimented with this:  We have identical machines (PIII 600, 128 Megs of ram, etc...) with ONE difference.  I have a 56K modem and he has a DSL connection.  On a day with little lag I can zone in 30-45 seconds.  My friend, on the other hand, zones in less than 10 seconds.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  By the way, I highly recommend the Riva TNT 2 chipset.  Totally awesome :)<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Mujahid  17 Necro  Sol Ro<br/>\n    -----Original Message-----<br/>\n    From: The Shadow [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lovekungfu@...\">lovekungfu@...</a>]<br/>\n    Sent: Tuesday, February 22, 2000 8:11 PM<br/>\n    To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a>; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Necromancers@onelist.com\">EQ-Necromancers@onelist.com</a><br/>\n    Subject: [EQ_Necromancer] Hope this isn&#39;t too OT..but<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    From: &quot;The Shadow&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lovekungfu@...\">lovekungfu@...</a>&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    Hi guys just wanted to ask what your choices are for a graphics card.
