My necro has still a bit to go.  However, I have started<br/>\ndoing some advanced research by asking friends what the heck they have<br/>\nstarted trying.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are the Research books for each class<br/>\nLexicon is for Wizards<br/>\nElemental Grimwar is for Magicians<br/>\nI can&#39;t remember the one for Enchanters<br/>\nBook of Dark Mysteries is for the Necromancers.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe you need Old Erudin to read any of these.  Possibly Elder Tir&#39;dal<br/>\nas I am not sure if any race starts with this language at Excellent.  I<br/>\nknow Old Erudin is what the book On Languages mentions.  Also they mention<br/>\nfor older books that they have been written in Combine.  Not sure where to<br/>\ngo to learn that.  And of corse the most powerful magics are in Ancient<br/>\nDragon.  I have even less of a clue where to get these.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps when I get Research with my wizard in one level I will have more<br/>\nideas  for now try to get some skill in Old Erudin.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I find any one on Fenin Ro that can teach me to Excellent.  I have even<br/>\nthough about paying them for their time.<br/>\n<br/>\nLomack</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
