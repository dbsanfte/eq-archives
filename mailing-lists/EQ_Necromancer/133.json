One of the great aspects of a game like this is our ability to keep<br/>\nadding to it, including zones. (do keep in mind, though, that creating new<br/>\nzones takes a lot of time and effort).<br/>\n-Brad<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps we should start a mailing action or some kind of list where every<br/>\nNecro could enlist themselves so we show more interest to Verant for the<br/>\ncity!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Naom<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------end quote---------------<br/>\n<br/>\n  Since we&#39;re on a mailing list, perhaps we can get all of our Necromancer<br/>\ncharecter names, and mail Varant saying that we _REALLY_ want this city.<br/>\n<br/>\n=)<br/>\n<br/>\n~Myskyra / Tunare</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
