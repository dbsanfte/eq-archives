Rivervale wall guards are a maybe example,<br/>\neast common guards are another maybe example. Find<br/>\ncorrupt guards to hunt.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) honestly, I would recommnend 29 and the new spells<br/>\nwith a group to do the quests. I did them at 28 solo<br/>\non a young server and died 11 times doing all of the<br/>\nquests. It will be easier on an established<br/>\nserver...but.... :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGood hunting<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkmoon Somberlight<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Tony B &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tonyb72@...\">tonyb72@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ok, here are some random issues-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1. i was looking at the temple/ro quests.  where is<br/>\n&gt; a good place to pull <br/>\n&gt; shadowed men from?  i know there are 5 in lavastorm,<br/>\n&gt; but ive been having <br/>\n&gt; trouble getting enough ppl to take the camp<br/>\n&gt; (especially with sol calling to <br/>\n&gt; them so nearby).  is there a single spawn anywhere? <br/>\n&gt; im L25, btw, i believe <br/>\n&gt; that is sufficient.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 2. guards- is there somewhere to pull guards?  being<br/>\n&gt; evil and all, i would <br/>\n&gt; like to get some payback, but i got wasted looking<br/>\n&gt; around for something in <br/>\n&gt; RV yesterday.  there were three guards that werent<br/>\n&gt; red, and one was green.  <br/>\n&gt; the others were blue, but they were too close to the<br/>\n&gt; reds to attack- oh <br/>\n&gt; well.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 3. what lvls does one need to be to take on the<br/>\n&gt; temple quests?  i read an <br/>\n&gt; old post for the harvester, mentioning the writer<br/>\n&gt; was L35 at the time.  is <br/>\n&gt; 25 high enough?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; thats it for now!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Belphenor<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>______________________________________________________<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Get Your Private, Free Email at<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTalk to your friends online with Yahoo!
