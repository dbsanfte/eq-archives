They&#39;re just being pricks about it, or at least, that&#39;s<br/>\nhow it seems to me.  What basis would they have for not?<br/>\n<br/>\n        Not to mention all of the other limitations, and the &quot;you&#39;re in our<br/>\nworld now&quot; that I thought was just a cool slogan, but now seems to be more<br/>\nof another way to say, &quot;this is our world, we&#39;re in control, we think for<br/>\nyou, we decide how you play, where you go, what you see, and if you don&#39;t<br/>\nlike it _leave_ because it&#39;s _MINE_&quot; .  That&#39;s B.S., we pay for this...<br/>\n<br/>\n    I dunno, I think I&#39;ll keep EQ until another company comes out with a<br/>\nfull 3D fantasy role-playing world.

If they were<br/>\n&gt; willing to give us this type of spell, they should also be willing to give<br/>\n&gt; us a numerical value for our mana -- something they have repeatedly stated<br/>\n&gt; that they will not do. Your best bet is to ask for a spell that determines<br/>\n&gt; their lvl/abilities in non-numerical ways, otherwise I&#39;m afraid you&#39;ll be<br/>\n&gt; talking into a void.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Valdus </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
