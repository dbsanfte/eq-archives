They are great xp up through level 10 and<br/>\nthey spawn quickly.  They also drop a tooth that you can turn into Fiddy<br/>\nBobeck right there for another big chunk of xp, a gold, and some RV factions<br/>\n(RV merchant faction which is hard to get), and sometimes an additional item<br/>\nlike a pouch, food, or beverage.  You only have to be dubious to turn in the<br/>\nteeth.  While your waiting for the Pirahna to spawn, you can kill the trout.<br/>\nAll added up you can make 4 plat an hour if you can keep up with the spawn<br/>\nrate.<br/>\n<br/>\nGreat xp, good faction, excellent money maker, and unlimited food, its a<br/>\ngreat place to go at your level.  The only downside is that this place is<br/>\nslowly catching on, but isn&#39;t a problem yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nDicey<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. Beware of the cleric guild near the Kith zone, I have never been able<br/>\nto fix my faction with them.  you may want to plan on going here at 8th<br/>\nlevel when you get gather Shadows.  That will give you time to kill some<br/>\nDeathfist orcs to get enough faction to walk safely in RV.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
