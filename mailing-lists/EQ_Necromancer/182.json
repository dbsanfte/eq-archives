I know it&#39;s a mini random teleport,<br/>\n&gt; but.. I have some misgivings about it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   I watched another mage, while invisible, casting their Shadow Step<br/>\n&gt; outside.  It was sad, they hardly went a few feet away from their original<br/>\n&gt; spot, and if they were being attacked, they could still get hit by<br/>\n&gt; whatever it was from where they went.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Though I guess, in a dungeon, it would be more helpful, or is that just<br/>\n&gt; wishful thinking?  Also, how long does it take to cast?  Faster than Gate<br/>\n&gt; does, or the same?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;     Thanks for the info folks.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ~Myskyra / Tunare<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote> Shadow step is very usefull it has saved me countless times AFTER I learned<br/>\nHOW it works.  Shadow step teleports you a random distance but will ALWAYS<br/>\ntake you to lower ground . If your at the top of a hill it will take you to<br/>\nthe bottom but never the other way around.<br/>\nIn a dongeon its best used while standing on a bridge or cliff it will take<br/>\nyou below the bridge or to the bottom of the clif. outside i like to use it by<br/>\nrivers and lakes the spell usualy takes me to the bottom of the river and it<br/>\ntakes the monsters a while to reach me through the water<br/>\nTry the spell in these areas it will make you verry happy .<br/>\n             Trinnes necromancer of the 5th circle<br/>\n<br/>\n____________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your own FREE, personal Netscape WebMail account today at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://webmail.netscape.com\">http://webmail.netscape.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
