When my friends<br/>\nare over on weekends I easily support 5 people zoning, etc. at the same<br/>\ntime.  However I use comcast cable out of the Detroit area, it may be<br/>\ndifferent depending on the company.  I believe comcast has a very large pipe<br/>\nto the inet supporting their users. (Multiple T3&#39;s i believe)<br/>\n<br/>\nI personally will try to avoid playing eq on a dial up after playing on my<br/>\ncable modem and friends DSL.  I can literally see friends on a modem keep<br/>\nbackstepping while there connection catches up, etc.  I have 1 friend that<br/>\nhas a key to my apartment and brings his computer over to play rather than<br/>\ndeal with dial up.  :)  These are my experiences.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t think that you won&#39;t ever get lag though.  Sometimes it is just server<br/>\nside lag  (i.e.  Verant)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\r<br/>\n__________________________________________________\r<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?\r<br/>\nTalk to your friends online with Yahoo!
