Take the right<br/>\npassage at the first 2 intersections, past a human and dwarf standing in the<br/>\npassage, and through the door further down the passage. That leads to a<br/>\nstoreroom that leads out into the dock area. There is a guard that sometimes<br/>\npatrols the docks, so be cautious.<br/>\n     As to getting back on the boat in BB when you are done, without invis,<br/>\ngood luck. I have no clue about that one. There used to be a dwarf guard<br/>\nswimming around in the water, so even if you make it to the docks, you would<br/>\nstill be attacked. Not sure if he is still swimming there....<br/>\n<br/>\nMay Bertoxxulous&#39; favor darken your path,<br/>\n<br/>\nMacabre, gnome necromancer<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Fraal &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mata_eq@...\">mata_eq@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a>&gt;; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Shaman@onelist.com\">EQ_Shaman@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, September 23, 1999 9:20 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ_Necromancer] evil in the light elf realm<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Fraal&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mata_eq@...\">mata_eq@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; nice to know once I am too BB,  but how can a Troll get to the boat?<br/>\nThey<br/>\n&gt; are KOS in Freeport right?<br/>\n&gt; What about Ogres?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Heh gonna be a pain, but jump off the boat to the right of the docks and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; follow the water to it&#39;s end... Then just stay up high on the right zone<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wall and walk along it all the way up it... You have about a 95% chance<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; &gt; not getting jumped that way..<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;From: Trizzen Do&#39;Trevan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:trizzen@...\">trizzen@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Myself and my three troll friends are thinking of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;making a trip to Unrest.
