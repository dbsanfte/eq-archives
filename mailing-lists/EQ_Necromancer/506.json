The best thing <br/>\n&gt; for you to do<br/>\n&gt; is make a trek to Freeport.  That&#39;s undead haven there, I <br/>\n&gt; swear.  You&#39;ve got<br/>\n&gt; numerous little ruins outside, plus Befallen (watch out for <br/>\n&gt; horrible trains<br/>\n&gt; & that damn Ghoul & Ice Boned) you can put that Ward Undead <br/>\n&gt; to use.  Beware<br/>\n&gt; of fizzles, however.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;     As for around Qeynos.. eh.. Karanas is the best place.  <br/>\n&gt; Just kill the<br/>\n&gt; grizzlies and spidies.  It&#39;ll take longer, but you&#39;re almost <br/>\n&gt; guranteed the<br/>\n&gt; experiance from them so long as you&#39;re not double timed.  <br/>\n&gt; Just remember to<br/>\n&gt; smack &#39;em with poisen, maybe Clinging Darkness and/or Fear, <br/>\n&gt; and leave enough<br/>\n&gt; mana for a Mend Bones or Gate. :-)  You&#39;re not going to get <br/>\n&gt; much more around<br/>\n&gt; Qeynos.  I left the place at level 10 for Freeport, got 56 <br/>\n&gt; gold in three<br/>\n&gt; days there, a greater light stone, two magical (Cut-Throat Insignia)<br/>\n&gt; rings..... and lost level 10. *grin*  Even the Orc Centurian <br/>\n&gt; around the<br/>\n&gt; entrance to the city of Freeport carries leggings at times, <br/>\n&gt; which you can<br/>\n&gt; sell for gold.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;     Freeport is nice, but very dangerous.  Those damn young <br/>\n&gt; kodiaks hate you<br/>\n&gt; and will attack you on sight.  They&#39;re pretty tough at this level,<br/>\n&gt; especially with a giant spider or two in tow.  Both of which <br/>\n&gt; roam around the<br/>\n&gt; immediate area of Freeport, one zone from the city.  Good <br/>\n&gt; exp, just watch<br/>\n&gt; your back.  Also, just because a zombie /con`s blue doesn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; mean it&#39;s an<br/>\n&gt; easy kill.  I made it out of a fight against two of those <br/>\n&gt; with a sliver of<br/>\n&gt; mana and life.  Granted, I had no pet at the time, but geeze <br/>\n&gt; they hurt.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;     Ghouls and the Ice Boned Skeleton takes magical weapons & <br/>\n&gt; spells to hurt<br/>\n&gt; it.  Your ward undead can kill it the Ice Boned if somebody else is<br/>\n&gt; distracting it so you can get all of them off, but not <br/>\n&gt; face-to-face as it<br/>\n&gt; will stun you repeatedly.  Ward Undead on the Ghoul is a <br/>\n&gt; waste of mana.<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;ll resist virtually every one of them.  Don&#39;t -- Fight -- <br/>\n&gt; The -- Ghoul<br/>\n&gt; :-)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;     Also, the desert is a great place.  The Giant Scarab <br/>\n&gt; Beetles are very<br/>\n&gt; easy kills -- I can sit and meditate while my skeleton beats <br/>\n&gt; the snot out of<br/>\n&gt; them (just remember to poisen them & keep a watch on your <br/>\n&gt; skelly&#39;s life) --<br/>\n&gt; and gives okay experiance.  Zombies roam the desert, as well <br/>\n&gt; as skeletons.<br/>\n&gt; /con _everything_ first, especially the skeletons.  Many of <br/>\n&gt; them will /con<br/>\n&gt; red to you.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;     Good luck.  Qeynos at level 10 is incredibly boring...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ~Mysk<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Sagi Shechter &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sagis@...\">sagis@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Can anyone give some recommendations about  where to go on <br/>\n&gt; 10th lvl, as a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; human necro in qeynos?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; For the last 3 levels i&#39;ve been in west karana, and i&#39;m <br/>\n&gt; looking for better<br/>\n&gt; &gt; places to hunt, as the xp and the loot i get in karana<br/>\n&gt; &gt; from the creatures i can handle there ( mostly giant spiders, giant<br/>\n&gt; &gt; beetles,lions , the occasional grizzly ) , is quite bad.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;From the times i&#39;ve been to black burrow, it looks that <br/>\n&gt; place is just<br/>\n&gt; &gt; impossible, because of all of the people that hang around <br/>\n&gt; there all of the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; time, pulling train after train..<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Is there any undead hunting site near qeynos, besides the <br/>\n&gt; ruins in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hills?
