There is a necro NPC inside and he has a lot of undead w/ him too.    3 Necros can hold this tower @ 24th lvl, and it is fun.   Might want to have one of you charm one of the undead to assit.   Also around there is a TON of Lizardmen and Bears roaming around.    If you kill them Giant Skels and Cyclopses spawn in their place.   People are always hunting Cyclopses there (me included at 34th they are fun to solo)  once I cleared out the place holders, and meditated then when I stodd up there were 4 Giant Skeletons I could see!!! &lt;GULP&gt;<br/>\nPull them up against the wall just past the necro tower . . .  you are pretty safe there.  Just make sure not to get too close to the Necro Tower or to pull any undead from it if you are solo, cus Necro NPC -boy will run out and him and his horde of undead will put the smack down on ya.  hehe<br/>\n<br/>\n-Good Luck!!  may the darkside force be with you!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Gareth Davies <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Thursday, December 16, 1999 7:22 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [EQ_Necromancer] Hunting questions<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I have beaten red giant skeletons at 22 in Lake Rathe (with great<br/>\n  difficulty).
