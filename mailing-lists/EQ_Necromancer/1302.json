You have about a 95% chance of<br/>\n&gt; not getting jumped that way..<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;From: Trizzen Do&#39;Trevan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:trizzen@...\">trizzen@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Myself and my three troll friends are thinking of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;making a trip to Unrest.
