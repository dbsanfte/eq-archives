When my<br/>\nfriends<br/>\n&gt; are over on weekends I easily support 5 people zoning, etc. at the same<br/>\n&gt; time.  However I use comcast cable out of the Detroit area, it may be<br/>\n&gt; different depending on the company.  I believe comcast has a very large<br/>\npipe<br/>\n&gt; to the inet supporting their users.

I can literally see friends on a modem keep<br/>\n&gt; backstepping while there connection catches up, etc.  I have 1 friend that<br/>\n&gt; has a key to my apartment and brings his computer over to play rather than<br/>\n&gt; deal with dial up.  :)  These are my experiences.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Don&#39;t think that you won&#39;t ever get lag though.  Sometimes it is just<br/>\nserver<br/>\n&gt; side lag  (i.e.  Verant)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Talk to your friends online with Yahoo!
