(Full Scowl ready to Attack.) However, after killing about 380 orcs<br/>\nin crush bone (I kept a tally sheet) they now are down to Glares<br/>\nThreateningly. Still not where I want it to be, but it&#39;s a start.<br/>\nI didn&#39;t just stay there and kill orcs all in one straight shot. What I did<br/>\nwas stop off in CB when I hit 12, and killed 150 of them, then another<br/>\nhundred at 14, and the rest at 16.<br/>\nJust for reference sake, you get the same faction adjustment not matter if<br/>\nyou get credit for the kill, or even how much damage you do. (I verified<br/>\nthis with Dunnik on Veshaan.) So I walk around with my level one Life Tap<br/>\nmemorized in a spare slot, and just tap everything that people are fighting.<br/>\n(I do an OOC first and occasionally explaining what I am doing, just so<br/>\nfolks don&#39;t think I am kill stealing.) This allows me to hit very high<br/>\nnumbers of faction very very quickly.<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a>]<br/>\nSent: Saturday, June 19, 1999 02:24<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com\">EQ_Necromancer@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [EQ_Necromancer] Digest Number 66<br/>\nMessage: 6<br/>\n   Date: Fri, 18 Jun 1999 16:11:16 -0500<br/>\n   From: &quot;Mark Muller&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:markm@...\">markm@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: Qeynos and Dark Elf Necros<br/>\n<br/>\ntook me about 3 days of gnoll slaughtering to get my faction with merchants<br/>\ndown to indifferent, but it&#39;s well worth it to have a haven for<br/>\nselling/buying on the western coast.
