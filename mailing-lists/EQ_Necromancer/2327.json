Since the downloads are not spread evenly over the<br/>\ncourse of the day, extra equipment is needed that is idle<br/>\nduring non peak hours.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, essentially the company figures most customers aren&#39;t<br/>\nso thrifty as you, Kaz, and also don&#39;t want the expense of<br/>\nproviding the download. I remember living on a grad student<br/>\nstipend, so I can understand your decision, but I also know<br/>\nthat to lots of people, $20 is just an impulse buy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMarlon<br/>\n<br/>\nNotes:<br/>\n<br/>\nProduct placement fees are the extra bribes the software<br/>\ncompany pays to Best Buy,Fryes, etc to keep the game on the<br/>\nstore shelf.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not gonna argue the $1200 PC cost either. I know some<br/>\nPCs are pretty cheap, but others cost much more than $1200.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: KAZ [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kazvorpal@...\">kazvorpal@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, February 25, 2003 9:45 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Necromancer@yahoogroups.com\">EQ_Necromancer@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ_Necromancer] just joined<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; Nope, their lack of foresight&#39;s probably losing them this player.
