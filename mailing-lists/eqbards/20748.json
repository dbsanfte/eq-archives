I<br/>\nsee interaction mechanics like Guildsay and the whole chatbox interface to<br/>\nbe &quot;pressures&quot; on RP, Not that they make it impossible /at all/, just that<br/>\nin a given population of people the mechanics of interaction will tend to<br/>\nresult in a certain percentage of people RPing a certain percentage of the<br/>\ntime. In UO I believe both those percentages are larger and I am interested<br/>\nin the sociology of it.<br/>\nAs I have spouted on the list before, I raised the largest armies (being<br/>\ndefined as characters in one place at one time all with generally the same<br/>\nintention) ever in UO and got totally hooked on the sociology of it all,<br/>\nparticularly the aspect of getting people to do what you want them to given<br/>\nthat you have zero direct control over them, that at any point they could<br/>\nturn off their computer and *poof* your influence would be gone, so, you<br/>\nhave to find a way to that they WANT what you want (which is the only way to<br/>\nraise armies in virtual communities btw).  This was particularly put to use<br/>\nin the Imperium on Siege Perilous.<br/>\nSo anyway, I am interested in what does and doesn&#39;t hook the greatest number<br/>\nof people emotionally, and what fosters or doesn&#39;t foster the greatest<br/>\nnumber of people being hooked. But I am not at all saying it isn&#39;t possible<br/>\nto get hooked though guildsay :o)<br/>\n<br/>\nTszaaz<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
