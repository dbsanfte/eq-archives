Once I have it I will be the very happy singer of Solon&#39;s Song of the<br/>\nSirens.  So, this brings me to my question, where can I find a good place<br/>\nfor me to play charm the mob to gain experience by myself or in a very<br/>\nsmall group?  I have adventured in many places, but would prefer to find a<br/>\nplace that is relatively safe for me.  Ie.  I don&#39;t have to die alot since<br/>\nI have a knack for that and minimizing my chances of dying would be<br/>\ngreatly appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nTreilanin Loreweaver (almost level 27)<br/>\nBard of Kelethin<br/>\nHonour Guard, Karana<br/>\n<br/>\n/em knocks on wood<br/>\n/em knocks on wood</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
