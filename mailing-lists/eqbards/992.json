An inventory is either one of the 8 basic inventory slots you<br/>\nhave (lower right of screen when in persona mode) OR any of the slots on<br/>\nyour body (wrist, head, finger, and of course weapon 1 and weapon 2, etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAny &quot;inventory slot&quot; can be moved to one of the 6 hotkeys at the lower<br/>\nleft. Simply click and hold on the inventory slot you want to move to a<br/>\nhotkey. Soon you will see an image of the entire slot appear on your mouse,<br/>\nand you can exit out of persona mode and move the inventory slot to a hotkey.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo make this effective, you will need to make 3 of your hotkeys shortcuts<br/>\nto inventory slots. The first should be your right hand weapon (weapon 1),<br/>\nthe seoncd should be your left hand (this is where your shield, second<br/>\nweapon, or instrument equip), the third should be the place in your 8 basic<br/>\nslots where you keep an instrument (for instance, your drum may be in slot 1).<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce you have copied these three to your hotkeys switching is now simple.<br/>\nClick on your sword to pick it up, click on your drum to replace the drum<br/>\nwith the sword, click on your shield to replace your shield with your drum.<br/>\nLeave the shield on your cursor. Run really really fast away from that big<br/>\nhill giant, thankful you were able to switch so fast to the drum.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can leave things on your cursor as long as you want. You can zone, and<br/>\neven log out with things on your cursor. <br/>\n<br/>\n-Musil<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 10:50 AM 5/21/99 , you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Steve Papoutsis &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:smp37@...\">smp37@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hail and well met,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I am a 16th lvl bard on the E&#39;ci server and have a question for my<br/>\n&gt;fellow bards.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;1.  How do you set up a hot key to switch from <br/>\n&gt;instruments to weapons.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I have tried this many times and I never seem to get it to work.  The<br/>\n&gt;closest I&#39;ve come is a back pack slot in my hot key box but i still<br/>\n&gt;need to go into inventory mode to grab and put away the weapon /<br/>\n&gt;instrument.  Im always afraid of dropping my Combine or shiny shield<br/>\n&gt;when I do this.  If any one can help it would be appreciated.
