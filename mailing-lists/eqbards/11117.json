I&#39;m<br/>\npretty sure I have read even Brad say that selo&#39;s<br/>\noriginally was supposed to break root.  Now, it<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t probably because the sow folks complained that<br/>\nbards were too powerful which is BS.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I got rooted last night by something and I<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t break it by starting up selo&#39;s.  It did,<br/>\nhowever, work against my wizard friend&#39;s root.  Or at<br/>\nleast it appeared to.  And this was by starting up<br/>\nselo&#39;s AFTER the root was in place.  Since he is 4<br/>\nlevels higher than me I&#39;d be surprised if I was<br/>\nbreaking it on my own with some strange magic<br/>\nresistance that I don&#39;t know of.<br/>\n<br/>\nThex Luteslinger (Tunare)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Message: 9<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Thu, 02 Dec 1999 23:45:06 +0000<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;M Sanford (Maev)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pr0teus@...\">pr0teus@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Un-Broken Song<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This IS a bug. Its so obvious accelerando wasnt mean<br/>\n&gt; to break root and ghoul root. Moving around while<br/>\n&gt; there&#39;s still the root icon on your screen? Being<br/>\n&gt; rooted after you zone? This is a bug and always has<br/>\n&gt; been, and using it to break root is exploiting (not<br/>\n&gt; that it really matters to Verant). But I wish bards<br/>\n&gt; would quit treating this as a nifty feature and<br/>\n&gt; acknowledge it as a bug.
