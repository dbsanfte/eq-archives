I personally don&#39;t mind the mobs as a <br/>\n50th, but I made the mistake of going afk at RV zone with my druid and <br/>\nsomeone trained 4 or 5 uber-skellies there. Luckily I got back in time to <br/>\nzone. It&#39;s the location. They should&#39;ve put these mobs somewhere else like <br/>\nin Lesser Faydark. I feel sorry for halfling newbies that don&#39;t have friends<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLesser Faydark?  You gotta be kidding, then Gnomes would have no way out of<br/>\nSteamfont.  That&#39;d be far worse as Lesser Fay has always had 5-10 times as<br/>\nmany people in it as Kithicor.  Not to mention there have always been some<br/>\nundead in Kithicor so it fits the storyline far better there.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
