Neither were selected for roleplaying purposes<br/>\nparticularly, but both fit the &quot;classic bard&quot; type of mold, in that they are<br/>\nboth light and very fast.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany people have commented on the fact that bards can wear chain and plate as<br/>\nnot fitting the mold very well.  To that, all I can say is that we aren&#39;t celtic<br/>\nminstrels in EQ folks, we&#39;re a class that was designed for this game<br/>\nspecifically.  If people want to roleplay in the classic celtic style,<br/>\nfantastic!  But if you want to roleplay yourself as mighty plate-wearing,<br/>\naxe-hacking fighter who belts out tunes of war at the same time, I say fantastic<br/>\nto that as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nThough playing a lute in plate gloves is odd no matter how you cut it.  At least<br/>\nthe wood elf ringmail gloves have finger cut-outs in the 3d model.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nJyzan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
