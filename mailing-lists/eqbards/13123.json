Lizards just run past in that wierd slow-mo jogging they do, <br/>\nand I&#39;ve never had Shauri&#39;s drop when I was playing it - on those rare <br/>\noccasions when I get a &quot;You feel yourself starting to appear&quot; message, the <br/>\nnext pulse refreshes invis, so no worries.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s only one lizard in Cazic Thule (as far as I know from scouting <br/>\npretty much the whole place on many occasions) who can cast see invis, and <br/>\nthat&#39;s Radiant (who as I recall is an enchanter in the low 20&#39;s).  He&#39;s <br/>\nusually wandering the maze, so watch out. All the other casters (jud, just, <br/>\npage, et al) are too busy casting Spirit of the Torpid Lizard, or whatever <br/>\nthey cast to buff themselves (they cast all the time, but it never seems to <br/>\nDO anything that I can see).<br/>\n<br/>\nYour best bet is to get someone in their 30&#39;s or higher that you know and <br/>\ntrust to pull you out.  Your next best bet is to get a flute, get someone to <br/>\ncast SoW on you, and run in invisibly.  When you get to your corpse, drag it <br/>\nto the zone and loot there... just in case Radiant decides to pay you a <br/>\nsurprise visit.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\n<br/>\nAloro Silvertongue (E&#39;ci)<br/>\n~Flying Brethren~<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
