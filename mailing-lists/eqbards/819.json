The best I&#39;ve heard is a<br/>\ncrystalline sword at 0.289 but that is word-of-mouth - I have<br/>\nbeen unable to confirm any of the stats on it, or if it&#39;s even<br/>\n1-handed.<br/>\n<br/>\n(And if you&#39;re wondering how I collect all this data, I have a<br/>\nspreadsheet app on my palmtop PC.

That way they try to stay in<br/>\nmy good graces and try to group with me even if they don&#39;t<br/>\nthink a bard is the greatest addition to a party.  :-)  (The<br/>\nclerics love me though because they get to nuke for a change<br/>\ninstead of having to use all their mana on heals.)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
