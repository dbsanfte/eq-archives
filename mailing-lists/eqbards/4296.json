So I<br/>\nwould expect some variability in your mana regeneration times<br/>\nregardless of whether or not the jig was playing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s also the possibility the jig may be interacting<br/>\nunintentionally with meditation failures, causing an increase<br/>\nin regeneration rate.  e.g. if &quot;succeeding&quot; at meditation<br/>\nmeans you gain, say, 5 points of mana, and the jig reduces the<br/>\ntime for a meditation pulse from 8 sec to 6 sec (though I<br/>\nstill think this is a client refresh illusion), then it would<br/>\nincrease the regeneration rate because the success/fail check<br/>\nwould be made more frequently.  That would decrease<br/>\nregeneration times at early levels, but show no difference at<br/>\nlater levels.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
