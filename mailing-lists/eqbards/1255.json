We use the same<br/>\n&gt;weapon as a warrior/ranger/paladin.  With the Whistling<br/>\n&gt;Warsong, you get a 15%-20% attack speedup based on research I<br/>\n&gt;and someone else have done.  That btw is more than the<br/>\n&gt;difference between a combine longsword and a well-balanced<br/>\n&gt;longsword, and is like hitting for about 3 extra points damage<br/>\n&gt;with a 17 point hit from a minotaur axe.  The same song also<br/>\n&gt;buffs our str and AC.  Our bellow takes the place of a kick.  <br/>\n&gt;And at L17 we get dual wield.  Our melee skills are weaker<br/>\n&gt;than the melee classes, but IMHO the difference is only just<br/>\n&gt;starting to become apparent at L17.  (The biggest difference I<br/>\n&gt;see is with my warrior friend, but he has double attack as<br/>\n&gt;well).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The way I see it, we are (as in so many things) better than some,<br/>\nworse than others.  In melee we are out done (damage wise) by<br/>\nwarriors, monks, rangers, rogues, paladins and shadow knights <br/>\n(no particular order), but we out do clerics, druids, shamans and<br/>\nthe 4 mage classes.  Right in the middle.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing some people on the a.g.eq newsgroup don&#39;t seem to <br/>\naccept is that, while we can do many things, there is always<br/>\nsomebody (or many bodys) who can do a given thing better.<br/>\n<br/>\nTindayen</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
