From what I&#39;ve<br/>\nseen women like giving men stuff too so its no big deal.  In EQ its even<br/>\nmore prevalent cause a normally shy guy can give some woman a really cool<br/>\nitem and feel good without having to worry about being embarrassed by<br/>\nothers.  If only real life were more like that, a closer community.  ah<br/>\nwell.  I say wear away!  The twinkers that are generally frowned upon and<br/>\nshunned are the ones decked out in tons of cool stuff like full rubicite or<br/>\nwith all great weapons and jewelry etc.  I have never seen any molested<br/>\nbecause their character had one or two items way above their level.  Heck<br/>\ndue to some weird banking bug I awoke one day to find adamanitite Epolets in<br/>\nmy vault.  I wore them for a while and no one complained but eventually I<br/>\nrealized I could sell them and get about 6-8 really good peices of equipment<br/>\ninstead of one really bodacious piece.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo do as you please and don&#39;t worry about the jealosy of others.  If it<br/>\nhappens it likely will regardless of how much more fortuante than them you<br/>\nare, a little or a lot.  Also I doubt that having two really cool pieces of<br/>\nequipment will leson your learning experience, just save you a few deaths<br/>\nperhaps.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shinara@...\">shinara@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shinara@...\">shinara@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, October 05, 1999 4:34 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Umm Twinking Still<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shinara@...\">shinara@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI will probably regret sending this mail .. Please remember this is my first<br/>\nmail list and I have only been playing EQ for about 2 months now, so many of<br/>\nthese comcepts are still new to me (Twinking, Item Camping, farming ??). I<br/>\nhave read the Glossary so I understand the meaning if not the concept.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night I was hunting in Crushbone and was grouped with a very high level<br/>\nplayer, I did not understand the EXP share problem. He just asked me to keep<br/>\nsinging my heal song and he would look after me, I grouped with him for<br/>\nseveral hours and didnt get any exp. Anyway when I asked him about this he<br/>\nsaid he would fix me up for my time. After a further hour I told him I<br/>\nneeded exp and would move on, at that point he said he had some stuff for me<br/>\nand initiated a trade. I asked my friend via tell if I should accept and he<br/>\nsaid yes as I earnt it. The Wiz gave me a Charred Chitchin Breastplate and a<br/>\npair of Blackened Iron Pants. I asked my friend if they were good (I could<br/>\nsee via AC and Stats they were, but how good?) he said they were, too good<br/>\nfor my level. I have banked them for now and wanted to ask the list if I<br/>\nshould wear them/sell them or give them away. I have no problem with<br/>\ntwinking but dont want to be called a cheat. So please no flames just an<br/>\nopinion on what I should!<br/>\n do.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh do all men like giving women stuff in EQ ?<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards<br/>\nNina<br/>\n<br/>\n----------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nGet your free email from AltaVista at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://altavista.iname.com\">http://altavista.iname.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
