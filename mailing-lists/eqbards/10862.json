And yes I had that pang of jealousy<br/>\nthat we all succumb to, but really what are you in the game for?  If it<br/>\nwere not for the good friends that I have made I would have left this game<br/>\na long time ago.  I bet you remember how wild some of your adventures were<br/>\nand not the 3 hour camp that you did to get a &lt;insert item name here&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for making items no drop, it would appease my jealous streak, but it<br/>\nwill also quell my good nature towards my friend.  As a present to my<br/>\nfriend who working on a new cleric, I camped 6 hours straight to get her a<br/>\nset of barbed arms.  The camp was horrible, but I did love the thanks I<br/>\nreceived from her... If items don&#39;t stroke my ego, then let my friends do<br/>\nit for me.  In all truth I really wish some of the other quests were not<br/>\nno drop so I could give gifts to my friends for their kindness and<br/>\nunderstanding.<br/>\n<br/>\nTreilanin Loreweaver <br/>\nBard of Kelethin<br/>\nHonour Guard, Karana<br/>\nHappily engaged to the dubbed &quot;Queen of Death&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wed, 1 Dec 1999, CYR, Thierry wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;CYR, Thierry&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tcyr@...\">tcyr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; hehe, sounds like me, i hate seeing lev 14 bards in full lambent when my<br/>\n&gt; bard still doesnt have boots or gloves. but hey, such is life.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; as for the TBB, when my group camped for the masks, we got 3 masks that<br/>\n&gt; night, and 1 burlap bag (yes he spawned).  but no TBB<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Minkin lev 36 bard<br/>\n&gt; Razan lev 39 SK<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From:\tMike Roach [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mike.roach@...\">mike.roach@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sent:\tWednesday, December 01, 1999 12:36 PM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To:\t&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject:\tRE: [eqbards] RE: Cleric/Bard armor quests<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Mike Roach &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mike.roach@...\">mike.roach@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Talk about tedious...I realize people&#39;s mileage may vary in respect to the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; story I am about to tell, but...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; At level 35 I finally decided to go for the guise of the deceiver and I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hit<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lower guk for the first time in my career this past weekend.  On Sunday I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; explored and got familiar with the undead area between the zone and the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; assassin room.  On Monday I called out to be put on the mask list at 10am<br/>\n&gt; &gt; CST.  I got into the assassin group by 5pm CST and finally looted the mask<br/>\n&gt; &gt; at 10:30pm CST.  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; The whole time I was there, a friend from my guild was waiting for the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; TBB.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; He had been there for 24 hours straight and did not see one single pop of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the ghoul supplier...he finally gave up and logged out due to exhaustion.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Now that&#39;s an absurdly tedious camp, and I thought I was losing my mind<br/>\n&gt; &gt; after 5 hours in that blasted assassin/supplier room.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; For 5 of the hours we camped that room I was the group leader and it was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; extremely hard because when you put 6 people in that tiny little room for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that long they start to get irritated and tempers start to flare...we had<br/>\n&gt; &gt; more arguments over stupid inane stuff, mostly how to go about doing the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; looting of the alleged TBB shout the elusive supplier spawn (I still have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; not seen this supplier to date) that I never ever ever want to be in that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; room again.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; But hey, I got my mask and only died twice for my efforts...heh.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m also a late bloomer bard obtaining my lambent armor and I can identify<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with Crier in his woes.  I just got my first piece, the breastplate, on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Saturday night and before that I kept getting tells from strangers, &quot;why<br/>\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t you have any lambent armor yet?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Because I&#39;m not a twink!  I have earned every single item I have the hard<br/>\n&gt; &gt; way and Faras is not only my first character in EQ, he is my only<br/>\n&gt; &gt; character<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and I have over 35 days played too...I am level 35 with one piece of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lambent.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hang in there Crier, don&#39;t pay attention to those that take the &quot;easy<br/>\n&gt; &gt; path&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; because really, they are only hurting themselves.  Play the game you want<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and enjoy it as long as can.
