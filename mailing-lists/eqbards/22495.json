But each time I find some &#39;gem&#39; and<br/>\ndecide to just keep them for a while longer.  Here is a clip that might<br/>\namuse some of you:<br/>\n<br/>\n(begin paste - names removed to protect the guilty)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Sent: Thursday, June 24, 1999 12:55 PM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqbards] high level bard suggestion<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Can&#39;t stop thinking about weak bards at high levels, haunted with the<br/>\n&gt; premonition of myself sitting in the entrance of some dungeon,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>periodically<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; calling out I need to join a group, no answer, finally logging out after a<br/>\n&gt; long night without having done a thing.  Had an idea, though, tell me what<br/>\n&gt; you think.<br/>\n <br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think you&#39;ll find that at higher levels, the players DO appreciate a bard,<br/>\nand actively seek them out, if there&#39;s not a regular one in their cadre.<br/>\n <br/>\nBy that point, the newbie curse of the bard has worn off, there&#39;s no<br/>\nconfusion in the upper level players mind about what a bard can do.  <br/>\n <br/>\nAnd, by default, if you&#39;ve taken a bard to the 40&#39;s and beyond, you have<br/>\n&quot;proven&quot; yourself to be skilled in bardic ways and a good social animal as<br/>\nwell.  <br/>\n <br/>\nNot to mention that not only do you have an active support role, you have an<br/>\nactive combat role as well, and neither requires you to sit on your duff for<br/>\n10 minutes after each fight, staring at a spell book.  And, when you&#39;re<br/>\nalong, of course, you minimize that for others as well.<br/>\n <br/>\nAs far as boosting bardic power, it&#39;s already done.  At 45th level, (or<br/>\npretty much any level after you get Hymn, for that matter) you DO see the<br/>\nhealth bar move at an appreciable rate, as well as the mana bar, when a bard<br/>\nis along.  A single bard in a group of 6 can flat outheal a cleric over<br/>\ntime, doing around 1200 hp per minute per person in the party. The offensive<br/>\npowers of a bard are subtle, but still very potent.  DDD was added to give<br/>\nthem a bit more rapid firepower in limited situations, for there are times<br/>\nwhen nuking is handy.<br/>\n <br/>\nAnyone who thinks a high level bard is weak has a serious perception or<br/>\neducation problem.  There&#39;s been an ongoing debate internally for months now<br/>\nabout bards being, if anything, too powerful, and nobody internal, even the<br/>\nstaunchest bard advocates, have ever claimed they were weak, not since phase<br/>\n2 (before that point, many classes, including the bard, were in a much more<br/>\nunfinished state).<br/>\n <br/>\nPersonally, I think one of the defining moments for a bard is when they find<br/>\nthemselves no longer memorizing Bellow, even when solo.  I won&#39;t expound on<br/>\nthat, when that time comes, you will know.<br/>\n <br/>\nSo, fear not, unless you&#39;ve done something of a personal nature to make<br/>\nothers hesitant to group with you, you&#39;ll not lack appreciation for what you<br/>\nbring to the table.<br/>\n <br/>\n(end paste)<br/>\n<br/>\nMake of this what you will. Personally, I think that the first poster turned<br/>\nout to be a bit more correct in his predictions than the guy who answered<br/>\nhim.  And the scary thing is that the guy who answered him has since shed<br/>\nhis &quot;guise of the deceiver&quot; and is now a VI employee.  I really like the<br/>\npart about bards being able to heal more than clerics &lt;snicker&gt;. It just<br/>\ndoes not work that way in how this game gets played. To be fair - he may not<br/>\nhave had much experience beyond level 45 at that point and with only &quot;old<br/>\nworld&quot; zones - certainly does not seem to consider the current use of a main<br/>\ntank and complete heal that most everyone uses in combat. <br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\np.s. 1500 of the 1659 items are from June, July, August & September of &#39;99 -<br/>\nthe &quot;good ole days.&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
