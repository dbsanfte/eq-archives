I hope you","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-932921454\">Hello Telania, and welcome to the list.  This is the most informative and<br/>\nleast argumentative EQ list I&#39;ve belonged to and I enjoy it thoroughly.  I<br/>\nhope you do too!<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, I would strongly advise against Unrest for you at 14th/15th.  I went there<br/>\nat 17th and again at 18th and decided that it was still just a bit too much<br/>\nfor me, even in the yard.  As has been noted here already, the trains in there<br/>\nare some of the worst in the game.  And these are not BlackBurrow type trains<br/>\nwhere there is a great many monsters that vary in level from 6th to 15th or<br/>\nso.<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of the problem is that bards attract a lot of unwanted attention.  You&#39;ll<br/>\nread some about that here but you&#39;ve probably discovered it on your own.<br/>\nMonsters tend to jump you first and hardest because you&#39;re singing affects the<br/>\nentire group that you&#39;re in.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Unrest trains badly, which is usually about once every hour and a half or<br/>\nso, the basement empties onto the lawn through the back door and chases<br/>\nvirtually everyone to the zone leaving a wake of player corpses.  These<br/>\nmonsters vary in level from low teens (Death Beetles, Tortured Dead) all the<br/>\nway up to the mid 30s (Skeletal Monks, Barbed Skeletons, Ice Bone Skeletons,<br/>\nUndead Barkeep, Unrest Nobles, Tentacle Terrors, Mortuary Fungus, and the<br/>\n&lt;shiver&gt; Festering Hags).  It&#39;s best to go there (in my opinion) at such level<br/>\nthat when (not if) these basement trains occur you have at least a chance of<br/>\nescaping alive.  My bard was dying to them at 17th and 18th so I moved on.  I<br/>\nwill definitely go back there when I&#39;m, say, 22nd or so and kill stuff inside<br/>\nthe house.  The experience and loot are both good in Unrest, but the really<br/>\ngood loot is inside the house.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn example:<br/>\nI have a 23rd level monk that was tanking in Unrest for my group.  Monks have<br/>\nMEND, which heals 25% of our hit points when pressed and recycles every six<br/>\nminutes.  I am a very experienced pulling in Unrest so I was pulling through<br/>\nthe side door to my group various stuff.  My monk has about 700HPs.  With full<br/>\nhealth I ran in and pulled a Skeletal Monk and a Carrion Ghoul out of the<br/>\nhouse to my group.  About the time I got out of the house and to the wall I<br/>\nsaw the infamous message &quot;A festering hag begins to cast a spell.&quot;  I spin<br/>\naround to see if she&#39;s nearby.  No, she&#39;s not; I don&#39;t see her anywhere.  I<br/>\nthen try to run toward one of the mobs that I pulled and think to myself &quot;What<br/>\nthe hell?  I&#39;m moving slowly as if I were encumbered!&quot;  I quickly look up to<br/>\nmy health bar and it&#39;s on empty.  WHAT!?!?  As quickly as I can I slap my MEND<br/>\nbutton, but I&#39;m dead before my hand gets to the &#39;6&#39; key.  Two Festering Hags<br/>\nhad hit me with spells from inside the house through walls (I wish my Wizards<br/>\ncould do that, huh?) and I died in under three seconds.  I had to scroll back<br/>\nthrough the messages after I respawned in Kaladim to even figure out what had<br/>\nkilled me.  I didn&#39;t know.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll that sounds really discouraging, huh?  Well I don&#39;t mean to be.  When<br/>\nyou&#39;re high enough level that you have a hope of escaping one of those trains,<br/>\nUnrest is great fun and good loot too.  Definitely go there, you&#39;ll have a<br/>\nblast.<br/>\n<br/>\nJason A.
