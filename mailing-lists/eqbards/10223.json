The higher your<br/>\nskill, the greater the range.  This would help greatly with the healing<br/>\nsong, which to me at level 16, seems to have quite a small radius.  I don&#39;t<br/>\nmean being able to sing across a zone, but have some sort of effect.  The<br/>\nbetter you are at singing, the better able you are to project your voice.<br/>\n<br/>\nGive us the block skill (I don&#39;t recall seeing it).  I think ANY class able<br/>\nto wield a shield should be able to get this skill.  (As an aside, have a<br/>\nshield increase your ability to block!  Having a 3&#39; x 2&#39; metal-shod shield<br/>\nis going to let you block a hell of a lot easier than with your arm. :))  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think it would be so unbalancing to give a melee class this skill.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso give us parry.  Again, I don&#39;t think it would be unbalancing.  We are,<br/>\nafter all, more melee than not.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for song ideas.. an invis to undead song?  or, at a certain level, give<br/>\nour current invis song the ability to hide us from undead as well.  Unless<br/>\nit does already, I dont&#39; know. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nHm.  That&#39;s all I can think of right now, as it&#39;s 1:30am and I really need<br/>\nsleep.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kitasi raises some good points IMO.  Although I always enjoy this type of<br/>\n&gt; discussion, I think we will have to wait until the expansion comes out<br/>\n&gt; before we will know what Verant has in store for the bards and other<br/>\n&gt; classes.  Its too bad that Verant is tight lipped when it comes to<br/>\n&gt; discussion of class mechanics.  In addition to new songs, I am hoping that<br/>\n&gt; we will get new skills like parry and riposte (with caps high enough to be<br/>\n&gt; useful) at some point after 50th level.  If the only thing we get are<br/>\n </span></blockquote>raises<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; to the caps of our current skills, then I for one will be quite<br/>\n&gt; disappointed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t know how useful it would be, but maybe the bard community (mailing<br/>\n&gt; list and Concert Hall board) should bang heads together and come up with a<br/>\n&gt; list of song ideas and skills that we would like to see get added with the<br/>\n&gt; expansion.  The way I interpreted GZ&#39;s response to our questions, Verant<br/>\n&gt; seems to be having a hard time coming up with new song ideas.  Maybe we<br/>\n&gt; could help them out some.  I volunteer John Kim, Shada and Rokenn to take<br/>\n&gt; the lead on this:-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
