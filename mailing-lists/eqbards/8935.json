Looks like they fixed it without fixing the bug in<br/>\nthe song:<br/>\n<br/>\nOctober 20th, 8:00am&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n--------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Following enhancements have been made with the update:<br/>\n<br/>\n*General Enhancements*<br/>\n<br/>\n- If a user is killed due to self-inflicted spell or melee<br/>\ndamage, experience will be lost.<br/>\n- When using a levitation spell, players are now vulnerable to<br/>\nattack from both waterbound and landbound creatures.<br/>\n- A number of enhancements have been made to balance the class<br/>\nspecific armor quests implemented last week.<br/>\n- A bug was resolved which resulted in a quest reward not being<br/>\ngiven approximately 1 percent of the time. - This has been<br/>\nfixed.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Spell Enhancements*<br/>\n<br/>\nSpirit Cap has been made slightly more mana-efficent.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Announcements*<br/>\n<br/>\nTransfer of Accounts and in-game Properties (Ebay, etc.)<br/>\nThis is a reminder that, as per the EverQuest License Agreement,<br/>\nownership transfer of accounts, characters, items (except for<br/>\nin-game trading/selling/buying), and any other game related<br/>\nproperties are expressly forbidden.    Doing so is in violation<br/>\nof the License, done at your own risk, and we (989 Studios/Sony<br/>\nOnline Entertainment/Verant) are not responsible for any issues<br/>\nresulting from such a transaction, including but not limited to<br/>\nfraud, sales of banned or suspended characters, purchased<br/>\ncharacter&#39;s bad reputations, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nHigh Risk Areas and Corpse Retrievals<br/>\nThis is a reminder that the following zones/encounter types are<br/>\nhigh risk and may result in irretrievable corpses:  The Plane of<br/>\nFear, Dragon Encounters (Vox/Nagafen), and the forthcoming<br/>\nzones, the Plane of Hate and the Plane of Sky.  Should members<br/>\nof your party fall in battle it may be extremely difficult, if<br/>\nnot impossible, to recover their corpses (for example, they<br/>\nmight be at the feet of a big red dragon).  GMs and Guides can<br/>\nonly help with Corpse Retrievals if there is a bug involved, and<br/>\nwhile this is true for all areas in the game, because of the<br/>\nextreme danger of the Planes and Dragon Encounters, we felt it<br/>\nimportant to remind our players of these issues.<br/>\n<br/>\nNPC Spawning Issues<br/>\nThis is a reminder that some NPCs are part of what we call<br/>\n&#39;encounter tables&#39;, in which only one encounter (NPC(s)) are<br/>\npresent at any given time.  Thus, while searching for rare and<br/>\nhidden NPCs throughout the world, it may be necessarily to slay<br/>\ncommon NPCs in the area you are searching in order to get the<br/>\nrare NPC to appear.<br/>\n<br/>\n- The EverQuest Team<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
