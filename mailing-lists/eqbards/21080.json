Corpse and Item poofing bugs are incredibly<br/>\nrare.  I know well over 100 players and none of them have ever encountered<br/>\neven a single one.  Item duping bugs are more easily solved by banning the<br/>\ndupers, otherwise they will just find another way.  Bugs to a song that<br/>\nevery bard over a certain level would use every single day if it were fixed<br/>\nare far more important.  Nut again it shows Verant&#39;s bias, which apparently<br/>\nyou buy into.  Pleasing the small percentage of 8+ hour a day players is<br/>\nmore important than pleasing the vast majority who play 2 hours a day or<br/>\nless.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Kevin L.
