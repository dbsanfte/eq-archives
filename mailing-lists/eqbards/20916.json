They USE mana and they<br/>\nARE hybrids.  They lump bards in with &#39;hybrids&#39; for lack of a better area<br/>\nfor us.  We aren&#39;t melee we aren&#39;t casters therefore they stick us with<br/>\nhybrids to categorise us.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still get a kick out of people thinking there is some kind of XP &quot;penalty&quot;<br/>\nfor being a hybrid.  It&#39;s not a &quot;penalty&quot; it&#39;s just harder to level certain<br/>\nclasses than it is to level others.  This is due to varying benefits that<br/>\neach class has.   Go look at an AD&D players handbook and look at the xp<br/>\ndifferences for each class.  If you look in a 1st Edition one you can even<br/>\nlook at bards and realize that they are the single hardest class in AD&D to<br/>\nlevel (had to level to 10 in warrior, 10 in thief then switch to bard and<br/>\nlevel on an xp curve comparable to that of a paladin.).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to why we didn&#39;t get the mana bonus?  Uhhh we never had the mana penalty<br/>\nand our mana isn&#39;t used in the same way anyway.  I don&#39;t remember the last<br/>\ntime I ran out of mana so... no offense... who cares.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe ONLY thing I agreed with in that post was the part about lullaby and<br/>\nchains and pixie.  That was the only valid point that the player brought up.<br/>\nAbashi&#39;s response is, unfortunately, typical.  I gave up  long ago on ever<br/>\nseeing pixie/lulaby fixed and recently gave up on seeing chains being put<br/>\nback the way it belongs.  To be honest I can even see Verant&#39;s reasoning for<br/>\ntheir snare nerf (and it wasn&#39;t just us, get over that, it affected rangers<br/>\nand druids too)<br/>\n<br/>\nLyrnia Jongleur<br/>\nBard of Norrath<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Tim Burke&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tjohnburke@...\">tjohnburke@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, August 09, 2000 8:32 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Oh this can&#39;t be good....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; This can&#39;t be right....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/003358.html\">http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/003358.html</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
