He was kind <br/>\nenough to reply with a very well thought-out response, which is below in <br/>\nit&#39;s entirety.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Gordon<br/>\n<br/>\n-----SNIP-----<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;I&#39;ve noticed that since retail release the Bard seems to be often <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;forgotten when it comes to testing out patches. Things like the <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;accidental Selo&#39;s nerf (caused by the mem hacking), the Consonant Chain <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;debacle (Sow&#39;ed creatures could not be chained), and the most recent <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;levitate bug are very obvious to someone who plays a bard. All of these <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;unintended nerfs could have been avoided with less then 5 mins of play <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;testing these changes on a bard. So the question here is beyond compiling <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;the code what kind of play testing of changes to the magic system takes <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;place?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>***GZ SAYS***<br/>\nWe have a solid internal testing department. The problem is, due to the <br/>\nsheer scale of EQ, changes can slip through the cracks. We try to fix the <br/>\nones we miss as soon as we find/hear about them ´┐¢ but in a dynamic world, <br/>\nstrange things can happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou should see some of the bugs we catch that never make it live ´┐¢ or even <br/>\nto test.<br/>\n**************<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Kelin&#39;s Lucid Lullaby, I recently tested this song out vs. a level one <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;human warrior. My Bard was level 37 at the time, using the Lute of the <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Gypsy Princess and I have charisma of 141. Every round I got the &#39;so and <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;so head nods&#39; message and every nearly every round the test subject was <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;able to attack me (about 1 in 10 rounds he would not).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>***GZ SAYS***<br/>\nAs most high level enchanters from Beta+ can tell you, there are two saving <br/>\nthrows that happen with an ´┐¢Enthrall´┐¢ style effect (such as Kelin´┐¢s Lucid <br/>\nLullaby) hits a creature. The first saving throw is against the target´┐¢s <br/>\nMagic Resistance. The second saving throw only happens with high level <br/>\nmonsters ´┐¢ they get a secondary save based on their level. The reason for <br/>\nthis is that the Enthrall effect is very, very powerful ´┐¢ it allows a single <br/>\nplayer to remove a creature from combat. This means that a party that could <br/>\nhandle two ´┐¢X´┐¢ level mobs might be able to take three, or even four of them <br/>\non if there is somebody around with the Enthrall effect.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause of this (read game balance) higher level monsters have a harder time <br/>\nbeing enthralled. At lower levels, a single player can take out a single <br/>\nopponent of equal level. By mid levels this is much harder, and by high <br/>\nlevels it is virtually impossible. Allowing a single player to remove one or <br/>\nmore creatures from combat at high levels is sick level powerful ´┐¢ to the <br/>\npoint that we designed an entire classes specialty around doing it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second saving throw does not send a message the environment ´┐¢ and that <br/>\nis something that is on our list of issues to address. There are, however, <br/>\nno bugs with the Song.<br/>\n**************<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Alenia&#39;s Disenchanting Melody, It does now work (9 months after release), <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;but it strips good as well as bad spells from the party, making the song <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;worse then useless. Is this the intended effect?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>***GZ SAYS***<br/>\nAlenia´┐¢s Disenchanting Melody works as it was intended to ´┐¢ it follows the <br/>\ndesign that we had for it from the beginning. It is particularly useful? <br/>\nDepends if your buddy is dying from a nasty DoT. People use Egg Shaped <br/>\nPumice on themselves all the time on the PvP servers. Is the Disenchanting <br/>\nMelody as generally useful as Cancel Magic? Not really.<br/>\n**************<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Angstlich&#39;s Appalling Screech, When used against very large creatures <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;(Giants, Mammoths, Elephants, etc..) You have to be standing directly <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;under or in some cases IN the NPC Avatar for the song to take effect. <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Otherwise the creature will glow, but no message or effect will be seen.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>***GZ SAYS***<br/>\nHeh. This is due to how the models are built ´┐¢ each has a ´┐¢center´┐¢ point, <br/>\nwhich is what calculates where our servers think the monster actually is. <br/>\nReally big creatures have center points farther away from you ´┐¢ hidden deep <br/>\nwithin their polygonal body mass. I will bump the radius of the Screech up a <br/>\nbit on the next spell patch and we can see if it works a bit better. Part of <br/>\nthe problem is that when I play my Bard, I know exactly how these things <br/>\nwork ´┐¢ and exactly where to stand. Sometimes knowing a bit too much about <br/>\nsomething works against you.<br/>\n**************<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Solon&#39;s Song of the Sirens, Often times when using this in a group <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;situation the newly charmed pet will agro on a party member. This could <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;cause a nasty way to get around the PvP switch as the pet is immune to PC <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;attack. The pet needs to ignore any player characters or pets on its hate <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;list when charmed. Also sometimes player pets (party & non-party member <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;pets) will attack the Bard charming a NPC if the pet had been attacking <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;the NPC.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>***GZ SAYS***<br/>\nI´┐¢ve had the pet agro on party members too ´┐¢ but it is usually because one <br/>\nof my party members did something to the pet that it didn´┐¢t like just after <br/>\nI charmed it ´┐¢ whacking it, for example. I usually have my pet commands <br/>\nhotkeyed, and retarget to something I want my new pet to be attacking as <br/>\nsoon as I charm it.<br/>\n<br/>\nCharm can be dangerous because once you take control of a monster, all of <br/>\nits actions reflect on you. If you charm a monster that is fighting your <br/>\nfriend´┐¢s pet, and the pet hits the monster after you charm it, your charmed <br/>\nmonster will attack back. When that little fight gets broken up, there is a <br/>\npossibility that your friend´┐¢s pet will come after you ´┐¢ you were, after <br/>\nall, the controller of the thing it was just fighting. Charming around pets <br/>\ncan be done ´┐¢ you just need to be a little more careful.<br/>\n**************<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Crission&#39;s Pixie Chase, This song seems to suffer from the same problem <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;that Lullaby does, you get the message that the song has taken effect, <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;but the target completely ignores the fact that it should be mesmerized <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;(similarto the problem with Lucid Lullaby).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>***GZ SAYS***<br/>\nSee above.<br/>\n**************<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Fufil&#39;s Curtailing Chant and the other Chant songs, The percussion aspect <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;of these songs is broken. Using a drum produces no additional effect <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;(damage or resistance debuff).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>***GZ SAYS***<br/>\nHmm ´┐¢ don´┐¢t use that one much. I´┐¢ll check. If so, we´┐¢ll get it fixed right <br/>\nup.<br/>\n**************<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Psalm of Cooling, The damage shield portion of this song does not seem to <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;stack as logic would lead me to<br/>\n </span></blockquote>believe. I can understand that it would weaken fire based damage shields, <br/>\nbut why would it weaken thistle based damage shields? I have not had a <br/>\nchance to see if it stacks with the necro damage shield (which I believe is <br/>\ncold based).<br/>\n<br/>\n***GZ SAYS***<br/>\nThe Psalm´┐¢s Damage Shield will stack with the Druid and Ranger personal <br/>\nDamage Shields ´┐¢ but they will not stack with other damage shields ´┐¢ in the <br/>\nsame way that no other Damage Shield stacks with another. You can not, for <br/>\nexample, stack Shield of Spikes and Shield of Fire.<br/>\n**************<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Denon&#39;s Dissension, The instrument portion of this song seems to be <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;broken. In tests I have run using a horn made no difference in mana drain <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;in PvP combat.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>***GZ SAYS***<br/>\nThis was a very tough song to balance. It takes away mana from other casters <br/>\n´┐¢ the virtual lifeblood of 7 of EverQuest´┐¢s 14 classes. The amount taken <br/>\naway is nice, but not great. Using a Horn increases the amount of mana <br/>\ndrained. Again, nice, but not great.<br/>\n**************<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;McVaxius Berserker Crescendo, I do not have this song yet, but other <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;bards have informed me using a horn only increases the song&#39;s Strength <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;effect, leaving the attack speed unchanged.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>***GZ SAYS***<br/>\nThe way our song system works, if an instrument effects a song, it effects <br/>\nthe entire song. Without specifically hardcoding it, I couldn´┐¢t actually <br/>\nmake the Crescendo only effect the AC and STR but not the Attack Speed. As I <br/>\ndidn´┐¢t hardcode it, the Horn should increase the attack speed along with the <br/>\nStrength and AC.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpeaking of which, unless my memory serves me wrong (which it could), you <br/>\n*must* use a Horn to use this song.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a completely side note, I saw on a certain website that this song <br/>\nincreases attack speed by 15 percent. It actually does considerably more <br/>\nthen that. I stand by an earlier comment that I still haven´┐¢t seen an <br/>\nexceptional spell analysis program yet.<br/>\n**************<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Verses of Victory, Many of the higher level bards I have spoken with are <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;very upset by the recent downgrading of the attack speed component, is <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;there any chance this can be restored to previous levels?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>***GZ SAYS***<br/>\nNothing has changed on Verses of Victory since I put the song in. Somebody <br/>\nis pulling your leg.<br/>\n**************<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;A while back GZ mentioned the meming time for bard songs would be <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;decreased, but it still takes forever to mem songs (due to the lack of a <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;mediate skill). Can this be looked into?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>***GZ SAYS***<br/>\nIt is already on our list of things to add in.<br/>\n**************<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Can a switch be set up (similar to the Fast Destroy option) to give <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;players the choice of 1-Always dropping<br/>\n </span></blockquote>items, 2-Confirm to drop, 3-No dropping of items. Bards I know have lost <br/>\neverything from Bladed Thulian Claws to Mistmoore Battledrums due to the <br/>\n&quot;cracks&quot; between hotkeys and swapping instruments/weapons.<br/>\n<br/>\n***GZ SAYS***<br/>\nSolid suggestion. See what I can do. No promises, but´┐¢<br/>\n**************<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Every time an answer is given on when the missing bard songs will be <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;added the answer is very soon. Any chance of a better eta?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>***GZ SAYS***<br/>\nWe were initially gong to save them all for the expansion pack. I don´┐¢t know <br/>\nif I can wait that long to get at least one of them in (I really want to see <br/>\nhow people use it), so maybe a bit earlier.<br/>\n**************<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;DoT change a while back lowered the damage of our DoT songs but didn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;increase the duration, any chance that this could be balanced in some <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;way?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>***GZ SAYS***<br/>\nBards are affected by the Kiting changes just like everybody else. Bard´┐¢s <br/>\nkiting creatures will get the disadvantage ´┐¢ in all other cases, the songs <br/>\nshould work just as before. Minimal combat movement will not lower the <br/>\ndamage on a DoT or Bard Song.<br/>\n<br/>\nGeoffrey Zatkin<br/>\nArch-Mage of Norrath<br/>\nGame Designer @ Verant Interactive<br/>\n<br/>\n**************<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDo not have time to make comments on all this so I will leave that to you <br/>\nall :)  I am less them happy with some of the answers :(<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn Swiftsong - Karana server<br/>\n<br/>\nEQ Bard Song Analysis<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://rgonzalez.net/EQSongs/\">http://rgonzalez.net/EQSongs/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
