That should<br/>\nhelp to counter the lifetap nicely.  Alternately sing Purifying Rhythms, FCC<br/>\nand TCF.  Also any poison resist spells your clerics/shaman/druids can cast<br/>\non you.  Lifetap is a Poison Resist Check.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaestro of Rancor uses a Lifetap type spell that does nearly as much dmg<br/>\nwhich is area affect and using poison resistance gear/songs/spells people<br/>\ncan usually take him down without too much trouble.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\n<br/>\nLyrnia Jongleur<br/>\nBard of Norrath<br/>\n&lt;Travelers of Norrath&gt;<br/>\nSaryrn Server<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;J.R.

If this had been nagafen we<br/>\n&gt; woulda spanked him soundly with zero deaths and clerics all at 50% mana.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It wasnt nagafen it was Venril unfortunately. He methodically knocked out<br/>\n&gt; the tanks one by one in such a systematic manor that everybody was just<br/>\n&gt; waiting their time patiently to die. Nuke&#39;s hit him for full damage and<br/>\nhis<br/>\n&gt; 320 melee is laughable. But his 2k&#39;ish lifetap every few seconds just<br/>\n&gt; decimated us one by one till we called evac on the one group remaining. We<br/>\n&gt; all had over 200mr thanks to the bards and enchanter buffs but it made<br/>\n&gt; little to no difference. He was at either 90% to FH when it was all over.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As far as strategy, all i can think of since mr didnt seem to do anything<br/>\nis<br/>\n&gt; figuring out whether his lifetap is a spell or a proc. If it its a spell<br/>\n&gt; then mana drains are the order of the day, if its a proc, then we have to<br/>\n&gt; get turgurs on him before anybody bothers nuking or hittin him. I tried my<br/>\n&gt; Brusco&#39;s stun on him and he just resisted (stuck on lvl 60 ancient wyv&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; np), same with fear. Maybe stuns will stick if you have enough being<br/>\ncasted<br/>\n&gt; on him, but either way you have to prevent that &quot;You feel a tugging at<br/>\nyour<br/>\n&gt; soul&quot; from going off.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anybody has any luck or knows any strategy suggestions please share =)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Gendal Concorden, lvl 55 Bard of Talisman - Tunare<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:garramone@...\">garramone@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Sunday, May 28, 2000 10:07 AM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] Venril<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; we grabbed 2 warrior, 2 rogue, 1 cleric, and 1 bard legs from him before<br/>\n&gt; he<br/>\n&gt; &gt; got beefed up.  i think that warrior is right before a new strategy is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; devised.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Shada Powa, L54 Wood Elf Minstrel<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Tyria Sarkin, L50 High Elf Wizard<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &lt;Afterlife&gt; Mithaniel Marr Server<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; So VS is on our &quot;unkillable&quot; list, at least for the time<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; being.
