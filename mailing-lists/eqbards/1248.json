These are the<br/>\n&gt;kind that do damage to the attacker every time you&#39;re hit.<br/>\n&gt;Since bards often end up being the mob magnet, I was wondering<br/>\n&gt;if anyone had tried getting a druid to cast a couple of these<br/>\n&gt;on you (there are two types - one low damage/long duration,<br/>\n&gt;one high damage/short duration, both stack - cast the latter<br/>\n&gt;just as a fight starts).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I just started using these with my L9 druid character, and I<br/>\n&gt;can attack two or three blue mobs at once.  By the time I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt;finished the first, the other two are down to about half hp<br/>\n&gt;just from beating on me.  Of course, these are goblins who<br/>\n&gt;tend to be pretty wimpy fighters in the first place.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have had the same druid partner since level 4 and he does use the thron <br/>\nshield spell on me quite often, usually if we fight a white or harder mob. <br/>\nIt&#39;s very nice - unfortunately, i don&#39;t think the more powerful version can <br/>\nbe cast on other players..i think it&#39;s self only..??<br/>\n<br/>\nSartori D&#39;Elsiraad<br/>\nBard of Kelethin of the 12th Chorus<br/>\nVeeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
