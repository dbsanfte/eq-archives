You&#39;re arguing personal<br/>\n&gt;opinion and nothing more.  In my experience, it&#39;s difficult, if not<br/>\n&gt;impossible, to change someone&#39;s attitude towards something.

I know a Druid, who was givin the<br/>\n&gt;following equipment before they reached 2nd level: Full Leather Armor, many<br/>\n&gt;snakeskin pieces including tunic, Bloodforge hammer, 2 cutthroat rings, at<br/>\n&gt;least 50 plat.

She is now 13th level, and she still hasent out<br/>\n&gt;grown any of her equipment.  And now after 13 levels she is realizing that<br/>\n&gt;it is very difficult to get stuff.  13 levels and she haddent gained the<br/>\n&gt;respect for items that you get over time.  It is sad.  She is bored, and<br/>\n&gt;feeling useless.
