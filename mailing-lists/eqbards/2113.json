It&#39;s<br/>\nalso supposed to make them forget that they are mad at you, and you should<br/>\nbe able to go on your merry way.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever what I have found is that if you are fighting with a group of mages,<br/>\nas soon as the mage does more damage than anyone else in the party, the mob<br/>\ntends to immediately attack the mage.  With this song going, the mob forgets<br/>\nthe amount of damage that the player has done to it.  This does seem to<br/>\nwork, as I have saved our Enchanters butt on many occasions, he&#39;ll fire off<br/>\na chaotic feedback and suddenly the mob is on him.  I sing the song, walk up<br/>\nand smack it with my dwarven axes and it&#39;s back on me.  But it also seems to<br/>\nwork as kind of a taunt skill.  If the mob resists the song, it enrages the<br/>\nmob and it will usually turn on you and start attacking you.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are soloing and you get jumped by a creature that is way over your<br/>\nhead, I usually kick on run song, get going, then switch to this song, if<br/>\nthe creature doesn&#39;t resist, then it will stop and seem to sleep for about 1<br/>\nround, this usually gives you enough distance to get away.  If the mob is a<br/>\nspell caster, sometimes, if your lucky, you can get far enough ahead of the<br/>\nmob that it won&#39;t be able to cast on you.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis strategy doesn&#39;t always work, but the times it didn&#39;t, there was no<br/>\nother option except to die.  So either way I was going to die, it just might<br/>\nsave your butt.<br/>\n<br/>\nSupposedly if you are at the entrance to a dungeon and someone trains a mob<br/>\nof monsters on you, sometimes you can play this long enough to get away from<br/>\nthe train.  Again, not always.....<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom what I had heard, it used to have an indefinate number of mobs that it<br/>\nwould affect, now supposedly it only affects 4.  So far the most mobs on me<br/>\nat once has only been 4, so I can&#39;t confirm or deny this rumor.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe most important rule is tho, do not play it around NPC&#39;s, i.e. Vendors,<br/>\nGuards, etc.  As it will affect them, it&#39;s an area effect spell, so if they<br/>\nwander into it, or if you get to close to them, they will kill you.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo be careful, and have fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nWenaddar of Cazic Thule<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\tRuss Fuja [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rsfuja@...\">rsfuja@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tFriday, June 18, 1999 5:24 PM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject:\t[eqbards] Proper way to use Lucid Lullaby<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hi fellow mistrels and other friends,<br/>\n&gt; ´┐¢<br/>\n&gt; I guess I have never really figured out how to use the lullably song<br/>\n&gt; correctly.´┐¢ I wonder if someone could detail a play by play on how it<br/>\n&gt; might be best used against 3 or 4 creatures my group and myself might<br/>\n&gt; encounter.´┐¢ I honestly haven&#39;t seen much effect when I have tried to use<br/>\n&gt; it....ok things nod but that doesn&#39;t seem to have any other effect.´┐¢ Also<br/>\n&gt; it is an area effect right, so do I target a creature,´┐¢myself, what?<br/>\n&gt; ´┐¢<br/>\n&gt; Thanks for any help y&#39;all can give!!!<br/>\n&gt; ´┐¢<br/>\n&gt; Ryleth Stormsong </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
