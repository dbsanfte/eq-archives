Charm the blue a<br/>\n&gt; few times.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; He will now be agro against you and will ingnore you<br/>\n&gt; completely.  Now find<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a green mob that is as fast as the uber blue and charm it and get it to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; attack the uber blue.  What I found is a griffawn can take down a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; griffenne in about 4-5 charms on the Griffawn ^_^.  Got my charm in that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; manner.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You know, this is really really clever.  I&#39;d been risking<br/>\n&gt; death by tossing a Chain on the mob that I wanted to lose, but<br/>\n&gt; I like your method better.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
