But, you&#39;d probably have to move your camp into the bubble room<br/>\nto make this feasible, unless you&#39;re always extremelly ready for the AOF to<br/>\nspawn.  This will cut into your potential exp, as will moving into the AOF<br/>\nroom if you don&#39;t want to risk something spawning on top of you.  I<br/>\ntypically try to pick areas to squat where the fewest mobs possible will<br/>\nattack on spawn.  Bubble room isn&#39;t one of them, a lesson I learned the very<br/>\nfirst time we tried to tackle him.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe idea about the Cleric taking the HT is a good idea also.  Unfortunately,<br/>\nClerics tend to pick guk as their stomping grounds when they&#39;re AOF capable.<br/>\n:)<br/>\n<br/>\nI was also corrected by my GF (said mage in all my groups) that the message<br/>\nyou receive is &quot;Not a valid target&quot; when you try to /pet attack the AOF when<br/>\nhe&#39;s in the bubble.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkfox Reven&#39;tsol<br/>\nXegony<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If you park your pet right under the bubble.
