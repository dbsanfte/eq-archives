If you use a weapon that is better than you are then you are unable<br/>\nto use it to its maximum potentional.  If it is way above you, you can<br/>\nactually damage the weapon by using it, probably since you would be<br/>\nincapable of using it correctly.<br/>\n<br/>\nNice twist on anti-twinking.<br/>\n<br/>\nLooting is different.  When the MOB dies it drops stuff on the ground, you<br/>\nneed to select it and get it.  Your loot is your loot, no one else can pick<br/>\nit up.  On the downside, if someone doesn&#39;t want the loot and leaves it<br/>\nthere, you cannot ever take it.  I do beleive it is theirs until it<br/>\ndisappears.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Drewt Drumslinger &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:drewt@...\">drewt@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, October 12, 2001 8:19 AM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Re: Hmmm. Someone else looking at DAoC?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I had the opportunity to Beta test DAoC.  I was impressed.<br/>\n&gt; A lot of unique things in DAoC that you don&#39;t see in EQ but might wish you<br/>\ndid.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; A few examples:<br/>\n&gt; 1.)  Equipment and Armor degrades as you use it.  If it degrades far<br/>\nenough<br/>\n&gt; you&#39;ll have to run to town and get it &quot;refreshed&quot; to keep the stats up.<br/>\n&gt; 2.)  Any player can bind him/herself to any city/town/village bind point.<br/>\n&gt; Commmand:  /bind<br/>\n&gt; 3.)  Seems to be a lot more low and midlevel quests for experience.  Every<br/>\nvisit<br/>\n&gt; to &quot;guild master&quot; presents a new quest.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I started many characters in each of the realms to &quot;try&quot; them out, didn&#39;t<br/>\nget to<br/>\n&gt; level many of them up very far.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s all that comes to mind at the moment.  If you&#39;re playing feel free<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; elaborate.<br/>\n&gt; Still need to run out and get my copy of DAoC, Beta is over and I&#39;m cut<br/>\noff at<br/>\n&gt; the moment.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br/>\n&gt; Drewt Drumslinger<br/>\n&gt; 23rd Level Half-Elf Bard of Veeshan<br/>\n&gt; Solusek Ro - The Burning Prince Deity<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;For every reaction, there is an equal and opposite action&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
