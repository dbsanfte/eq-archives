First, anything interesting is considerably farther in past the<br/>\nzone line, and secondly because of that, you need a group that knows how<br/>\nto work together. Snaring is mandatory, as is a puller who knows what<br/>\nthe heck they are doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the same time, they are 2 of the most fun dungeons in the game, again<br/>\nIMO. Especially on older servers where Lower Guk is so camped you have<br/>\nto book an appointment for a spawn spot, these 2 dungeons are probably<br/>\nthe only places where you will be able to explore dungeons the way I<br/>\nthink Verant really had in mind when designing the game. (assuming you<br/>\nresist the temptation to go to a spoiler site for maps and mob<br/>\nlocations)<br/>\n<br/>\nI missed these 2 the first time around, mainly because neither were<br/>\nitemized until after they were way green to my character, but I&#39;ve had a<br/>\ngreat time in them with my new character, and am a bit sad now at 37<br/>\nthat they are getting too green for me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mon, Nov 15/99, JasonF &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JasonF@...\">JasonF@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;JasonF&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JasonF@...\">JasonF@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; /shiver<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Man.  I friggin&#39; hate goblins.  They train up like they work for Amtrak.<br/>\n&gt; Sol A and Runnyeye are the worst, Permafrost isn&#39;t quite so bad.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I know it&#39;s because I&#39;ve been in bad pickup groups, but I have died and left<br/>\n&gt; empty-handed every time I&#39;ve tried to fight in Sol A as a bard.  So far I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; made excursion there three separate times for vambrace and boot items and<br/>\n&gt; there&#39;s usually just about 12 people in the zone, half of them resting from<br/>\n&gt; Sol B.  I have yet to even get to the spawn locations for these items.  I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t have a strong guild, so getting them together for this sort of thing<br/>\n&gt; just isn&#39;t possible.  So every once in a while I cruise to Sol A and ask if<br/>\n&gt; anyone is fighting in there and need a bard.  So far no luck.  Just another<br/>\n&gt; couple of empty-handed deaths and a run back to Cazic-Thule where the<br/>\n&gt; coordinated people seem to fight.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y* </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
