Anytime anyone<br/>\n  asks me a question about it they always refer to it as my &#39;god flute&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\n  heh.  Did a show&tell of a friend&#39;s fbss and my flute last night.<br/>\n  I need to pick up a fbss for myself soon, all the times I&#39;ve gone<br/>\n  I&#39;ve been just to damn generous, and pass it off to a guild ranger<br/>\n  or guild paladin even if they just got there.  With the flute, the<br/>\n  bard with 170 some cha, was pixie stunning clerics and interrupting<br/>\n  about 75% of the time.  25% of the time a yk or bash interrupted.<br/>\n  Only twice have I seen a cleric get off a complete heal.  I mean,<br/>\n  24 people all buffed, speeded up, etc doing god knows how much dmg<br/>\n  per second, and this mob&#39;s channelling lets it cast?  hah.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I estimate the Clerics of Innoruuk to have around 10k hp.  It takes<br/>\n  between 45 to 60 seconds (usually closer to 60) to drop one with 24<br/>\n  people (approx 12 melee).  Anyway, that&#39;s over 150 dmg per second.  <br/>\n  And a complete heal takes what? 12 seconds to cast?  I&#39;d like to <br/>\n  see a PC cast through 1800 points of damage, hehe.  Most I&#39;ve ever<br/>\n  heard of was someone evac&#39;ing with 400 dmg done to them.  That&#39;s<br/>\n  with Specialize and Channeling maxxed.  So this Cleric of Innoruuk<br/>\n  must have like 800 channeling, and 800 specialization: alteration.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic, the god flute tooter.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
