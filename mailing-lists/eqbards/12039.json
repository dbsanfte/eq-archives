I joined 4 trolls (1 shaman, 3 War or<br/>\nSK) and a Delf SK.  My job was to since my buffing songs (anthem and<br/>\nelemental), then heal us all up after battle.  (Does troll regen with<br/>\nour bard song?  Being trolls I could not a straight answer out of them: <br/>\n&quot;How much are you healing while you sit?&quot;  &quot;EetBugz heel gud.  Lik elfy<br/>\nsing.&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\nSunday: Fighting same orcs with a new group: 2 wizards, 2 enchanters,<br/>\nshaman.  I became the tank, having more than a full column of buffs at<br/>\nlvl 10 is pretty cool, btw.  I felt like a real warrior.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nWe now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>\n<br/>\nMatt DeBarger</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
