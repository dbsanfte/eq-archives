Big frickin&#39; deal!!  <br/>\nAny game where you can be banned for doing something that does NO HARM to <br/>\nanyone but a make-believe creature is inane to begin with and hardly worth my <br/>\ntime.  Should I get banned I will shed not a tear and Verant will simply do <br/>\nwithout my subscription dollars.  I have confronted GMs with this very <br/>\nproposition yet I remain playing.  Wonder why that is??<br/>\n<br/>\nCooter the *cheater*<br/>\n21st for now</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
