But one of the patches nerfed<br/>\n&gt; the drop rate, either by accident or on purpose.  At least on my server<br/>\n&gt; (Fennin Ro), you can go there now and camp the pool room (has like 5<br/>\n&gt; guardians and 4 sentries and some drakes) for days on end and only see a<br/>\n&gt; couple pieces of plate.  Starting to look like imbrued drop rates :(  Bleah,<br/>\n&gt; getting armor for my bard is just plain hard.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As for the kinds of fights, you&#39;ll need to be around 53 to pull singles, and<br/>\n&gt; even then a few will be blue.  If you want an idea about toughness, think<br/>\n&gt; hill giant.  They hit for around 90, and have so many hps it&#39;s scary.  I was<br/>\n&gt; with a 55 mage who could solo one if he helped his pet with a couple of<br/>\n&gt; nukes.  If there were two, I had to mez or charm because they&#39;d tear his<br/>\n&gt; poor pet to shreds.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you take a group here, a balanced group of around level 45 will have it<br/>\n&gt; pretty easy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kaelrei<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I am looking for some information from people who have hunted here.
