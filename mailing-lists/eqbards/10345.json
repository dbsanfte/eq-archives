The stores<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t like having to give 2%-5% of their income to another<br/>\n&gt; company, so they started charging customers a credit card<br/>\n&gt; surcharge.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The credit card companies didn&#39;t like that, so they lobbied<br/>\n&gt; Congress, and got a law passed banning credit card surcharges.<br/>\n&gt; The stores complied with the law, and began giving cash<br/>\n&gt; discounts instead.
