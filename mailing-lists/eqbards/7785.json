A casting class depends on their spells which<br/>\nare on them at ALL times no matter where they are.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it&#39;s more dangerous for a caster to run 2-3 zones<br/>\naway completely armed with their weapons (spells) and<br/>\ntheir shields (spells), and less dangerous for a melee<br/>\nclass to make the same run with no weapons and no<br/>\narmor at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease explain that again. I think I missed something.<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nVery happy to explain.  When you run back to get your body, presumably you<br/>\nare avoiding all mobs that may give you trouble.  So if you do get into<br/>\ntrouble, it is generally coming from something that you didn&#39;t see and has<br/>\nalready started hitting you.  Since it came after you, it is at least high<br/>\ngreen, and likely higher.<br/>\n<br/>\nA bard should have turbo going already and should have no trouble outrunning<br/>\npursuit.  You might have me with a rogue.  They should be hiding/sneaking<br/>\nthrough trouble spots, but a random encounter spells disaster for them.<br/>\nI&#39;ve never played one, though, so they may have a trick up their sleeves for<br/>\njust such a predicament.<br/>\n<br/>\nA caster with spells memorized will probably start by trying to cast root<br/>\n(if they have it), which takes a bit of time to cast.  Some of the time<br/>\n(depending on the level of the mob -- if it&#39;s white or higher you&#39;re<br/>\nprobably screwed regardless of class) you can get it off in your first<br/>\ncouple of tries and make a run for it.  All too often, however, you get<br/>\nrepeatedly interrupted until you are either dead or too weak to make it to<br/>\nthe zone before the mob gets loose and comes after you again.  That lack of<br/>\nhps really shows in this situation; it doesn&#39;t take many hits to pound a<br/>\ncaster six feet under.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think of it this way: a caster&#39;s armor is his/her group -- especially as<br/>\nthe caster advances in levels.  Without that group, combat generally leads<br/>\ndirectly to death.  If a caster has the luxury of picking his/her prey, they<br/>\ncan often have some success, but when combat is initiated by the mob, my<br/>\nexperience shows that the caster is going to lose.<br/>\n<br/>\nA fighting melee class (PAL, RNG, SK, WAR), on the other hand, if he/she was<br/>\nsmart enough to pick up that spare weapon he/she keeps in the bank (my lvl<br/>\n16 TSK and 9 Ranger always keep a spare for difficult retrievals), can fend<br/>\noff greens and most blues, even sans armor.  If things look really bad,<br/>\nhaving several more hps than casters gives the melee player a better chance<br/>\nof making it to the zone before giving up the ghost.  Again, if you&#39;ve got a<br/>\nhigh-level mob on your backside, you&#39;re probably dead, but you would have<br/>\nbeen dead fully dressed and with a smile anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt higher levels, your solo ability is reduced, but there are FAR fewer mobs<br/>\nin most zones that would even consider taking a shot at you, and those can<br/>\nmostly be avoided.  <br/>\n<br/>\nUnderstand my point now?<br/>\n<br/>\nRanulf<br/>\nTunare Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
