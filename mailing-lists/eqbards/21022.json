And I did it about a week<br/>\nbefore they changed the quest.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had a little drama when a high-level wizard wandered in (kill stealer alert<br/>\noh no!!).  We had one person take a trip to town for supplies and drinks (and<br/>\nhe brought me a chippped bone bracelet for my druid - so nice), we had catnaps<br/>\nwith a timer set ;P.  The 2 people I knew in the camp when we started soon<br/>\nleft, and I was left with new people to get to know.  It was one of the<br/>\nstrongest bonding experiences I have ever had in EQ =).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for bards with Jboots:  it is a fine, fine thing to click them on outside<br/>\nGuk or Sol B or Kaesora and run to the bottom at speed :).  That is what I use<br/>\nthem for most.  I used to also use them to run at speed and invis across<br/>\nKithicor, for instance.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince the better non-camping Jboots quest was implemented (yes, I am being<br/>\nsarcastic hehe) I know I could not justify getting a pair over my cleric<br/>\n(faster travel to res me woohoo!  hehe), paladin, etc. friends.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMaravana Vireo<br/>\n54 Bard of Jus Divinum<br/>\nMithaniel Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nSend instant messages & get email alerts with Yahoo!
