Then a beta is released to 2 or 3<br/>\ncustomers who have agreed to use a beta in real situations to make<br/>\nsure we haven&#39;t missed anything.  Then, finally a full release.  The<br/>\ntest server is liket hose beta testers.  We still sometimes get things<br/>\nthat slipped through in beta testing, we just don&#39;t have quite the<br/>\nnumber of users that EQ has who will whine and/or argue about every<br/>\nchange made.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the same method that most software places that I&#39;ve seen use.<br/>\nThey just use the test server as their beta testing ground and<br/>\napparently don&#39;t do quite as thorough internal testing in hopes that<br/>\ntest server people will get it.  It just kind of sucks that there<br/>\naren&#39;t really enough people on the test server to really effectively<br/>\ntest things.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome other issues 1) if they really did a kind of seat of their<br/>\npants bug fixing schedule, many bug fixes would never get made.<br/>\nCompanies that don&#39;t at least partially document their bug fixes and<br/>\ntheir code don&#39;t get very far 2) Quite a few of the changes are<br/>\nprobably made to quests and things where they can&#39;t really tell us<br/>\nwhat they changed.  These are the things that they should be fully<br/>\ntesting internally, or at least with a developer playing on the test<br/>\nserver.  And in a lot of places, it looks like they aren&#39;t.  I can<br/>\nunderstand using the test server players to test spell changes or item<br/>\nchanges that they can tell us about, but if you can&#39;t tell us about it<br/>\ntest it yourselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nI dunno, I just get a little irked when people bash the programmers.<br/>\nI mean, come on, they madet his awesome game that so many people play,<br/>\nyet a large portion of them complain about it.  There&#39;s far more users<br/>\nthan there are programmers to handle some of these bug issues and a<br/>\nlot are lower priority than others.  If you don&#39;t work there, you<br/>\ndon&#39;t really know what&#39;s going on.  Heh, for all we know they could<br/>\njust be playing all day and not fixing bugs at all. =)<br/>\n<br/>\nDid I contradict myself enough in this message? =)<br/>\n<br/>\nRobynn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nKaty Westerman                           Don&#39;t lick something unless <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:katyw@...\">katyw@...</a>                         you really mean it.           <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~katyw\">http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~katyw</a>             -Advice from the Naked<br/>\nCS/Comp Math Major, UC Riverside         Dancing Llama</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
