You effectively argue that we are<br/>\npowerful - and even &quot;not-underpowered&quot;.  The power you describe here is one<br/>\nthat makes it easy for us to get into groups - especially given the small<br/>\nnumber of bards in general.  The Druids and Rangers in my guild get<br/>\nfrustrated at how much more difficult it is for them to get in groups in,<br/>\nsay Karnor - while I get often get tells asking me if I&#39;m a group (even when<br/>\nI don&#39;t have LFG flag on).<br/>\nArguing semantically even further - I could argue you have made not a single<br/>\nargument towards power - only versatility - but that would pretty much be<br/>\narguing for arguing sake - I think you DO make a good arugment that bards<br/>\naren&#39;t underpowered and are consistently powerful vis-├á-vis other classes.<br/>\nOn the other hand, I have yet to see an effective argument by you or anyone<br/>\nelse that bards are &quot;Over&quot; Powered.  To be &quot;Over Powered&quot; would imply that<br/>\nthe class needs to be &quot;nerfed&quot;.  If we were overpowered - you would often<br/>\nsee people say &quot;we can&#39;t start this group until we have a bard&quot;.  I&#39;ve seen<br/>\nthis said about clerics, enchanters, even Shaman, but never Bards.<br/>\nSlyde<br/>\n<br/>\nWhee Wrote:<br/>\ni almost never solo.  i mean we are over powered with respect to other<br/>\nclasses in a group<br/>\nsetting, more so in broken groups than cle/enc/war groups, but the fact that<br/>\nwe can<br/>\nmake a group without a cleric, enchanter, OR warrior able to go deep into<br/>\nsebilis or<br/>\nhowling stones or karnors seems pretty powerful to me.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
