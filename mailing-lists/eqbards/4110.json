It worked nicely except it<br/>\nseems to have a nasty interaction bug with the Guise of the Deceiver<br/>\nDark Elf illusion. One of the people I party with is a Troll and the<br/>\nDark Elf illusion has been a godsend for dungeon crawling, as it&#39;s<br/>\nfairly obvious that most dungeons weren&#39;t really designed to fit the<br/>\nlarge races very well. However, when the Psalm ended, it also killed my<br/>\nTroll friend&#39;s ultravision in Dark Elf mode. Weird bug. Psalm only does<br/>\n7 dmg at L47 though, so it&#39;s not a huge loss, but as you point out,<br/>\nthose points add up in a long fight with a fast hitting mob.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
