(47.5pp here)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Can you check the price for a well-balanced longsword on the<br/>\n&gt;shady swashbuckler between North Ro and Easy Commonlands?  I<br/>\n&gt;get 223pp plus change.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hmm interesting. You must be wood elf i&#39;m guessing then.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The gypsies were indifferent (or amiable) to me. I&#39;m human.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The Oasis gypsies are indifferent to me as well.  My bard is a<br/>\n&gt;wood elf, diety is Erollisi Marr.  (DON&#39;T LAUGH!  I figured<br/>\n&gt;it&#39;d be nice to be friendly with the paladin guilds and the<br/>\n&gt;diety description says many paladins follow Erollisi, so I<br/>\n&gt;picked it.  Now that I&#39;ve played the game some, the only<br/>\n&gt;followers of Erollisi I&#39;ve found are the Sisters of Erollisi<br/>\n&gt;in the Ocean of Tears. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, I checked with the oasis gypsies and the shady Swashbuckler, and the <br/>\nboth consider me indifferently. As I stated before I have a CHA of 93, and <br/>\nmy deity is Quellious the Tranquil. The gypsies will sell me a combine long <br/>\nsword for about 54.7 plat. The other day the Shady Swashbuckler was asking <br/>\n231 plat for a well-balanced long-sword. Last night he was asking 238.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I&#39;ve noticed the sisters of Erollisi &quot;kindly consider me&quot;<br/>\n&gt;instead of considering me amiably or indifferently.  Is this<br/>\n&gt;what other people are seeing from NPCs with the same diety?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m pretty sure this is the case. My high elf wizard of Tunare was kindly <br/>\nconsidered by most of the denizens of Felwithe (especially the Paladin <br/>\nguildmasters).<br/>\n<br/>\nSartori D&#39;Elsiraad<br/>\nBard of Kelethin of the 11th Chorus<br/>\nVeeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
