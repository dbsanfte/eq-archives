It&#39;s tough to describe for those of you who missed it, but <br/>\ntry and picture 60 drunken Gnomes outside the Freeport gates, waving <br/>\nlutes and charging en masse to Lavastorm.  And boy, did we annoy the Dark <br/>\nElves in Nektulos!  (Did you ever notice that Dark Elves have no sense of <br/>\nhumor?)<br/>\n<br/>\nI actually managed to make it to the Temple of Solusek Ro ledge, where I <br/>\nwas able to fling myself into the lava along with perhaps twenty others <br/>\nthat I saw up there.  There was, sadly, a fair amount of attrition along <br/>\nthe way (not unexpected).  I tried to get back two more times, but kept <br/>\ngetting chomped by piranhas in the Nektulos river.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy roommate, who generally raises an eyebrow at this game, watched most <br/>\nof it and found it hilarious.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wanted to thank Aloro, et al, for organizing this, and the E&#39;ci higher <br/>\nlevel players who spent several hours helping all of us idiots with <br/>\nteleports, binding, SOW, beer and lutes.  I&#39;d appreciate it if you E&#39;ci <br/>\nbards could pass on my thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 34 songs, Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
