My<br/>\n&gt; regular group of friends I group with don&#39;t want me to fall to far behind<br/>\non xp<br/>\n&gt; while I am out for my son&#39;s impending birth (my wife would kill me if I<br/>\nattempt<br/>\n&gt; to play for the first month).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I was told that with the new xp changes that you can group with a higher<br/>\nlevel<br/>\n&gt; player in my case a 53 shaman whose toons I group with would take my bard<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; group. He would then procedd to solo mobs and let me get the xp.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The figures I saw (in an email) says the lower level character could<br/>\n&quot;draft&quot; or<br/>\n&gt; ride the xp off of the higher level shaman.  They are estimating the lower<br/>\nlevel<br/>\n&gt; would get about 40% of the xp from such a scenario.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Opinions on powerleviling and recent discussion on mediocre players aside<br/>\n(I<br/>\n&gt; have played EQ since it came out and have several characters in the 20&#39;s<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; 30&#39;s) would this form of powerleveling be an option? Or is the math wrong?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks for any input.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -Ranian<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSince the exp needed to level goes up by the cube of the level,<br/>\nbut exp gained per mob is split linearly by level (in the new system)<br/>\nthen the lower level partner gets more exp *RELATIVE* to the<br/>\nexp he needs to level than the higher level, thus &quot;drafting&quot; and<br/>\ncatching up.  This also means that, although characters now have<br/>\nto pay their own racial exp penalty, there is a limit to how far they<br/>\nwill fall behind a regular grouping partner<br/>\n<br/>\nUnless I bungled the math it&#39;s something like<br/>\nH = Human level<br/>\nN = Non-Human level<br/>\nR = Racial modifier for Non-Human<br/>\n<br/>\nIf H^2/N^2 &gt;= R then the Non-Human<br/>\nstops falling behind.<br/>\n<br/>\nSDK </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
