I don&#39;t bother petitioning, because I<br/>\nknow<br/>\nthe answer.  A long time friend of mine, leaves her camp deep in Karnors to<br/>\nrez me (at the moat).  About an hour later in a amazing heated battle (5<br/>\nmobs with no enchanter), we somehow prevail (amazing what 6 players who<br/>\nknow<br/>\nwhat they&#39;re doing can accomplish) and I level to 48.  Strangely I really<br/>\ndon&#39;t feel very happy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI switch to Eetbugz (my twink warrior).  An iksar maurader flees through a<br/>\nwall, so I sit down to bring him back to me.  He comes back under the<br/>\nearth,<br/>\nand kills me befor I can make it to the zone.  I petition, and after half<br/>\nan<br/>\nhour a guide tells me they will forward my petition to the proper<br/>\nauthorities for investigation..  90 minutes of saying my goodbyes to my<br/>\nguild and friends (I tell them I will wait until the day before my next pay<br/>\ncycle before making it official, giving me time to reconsider).  I give up<br/>\nwaiting for my petition and begin to run.  A goblin caster agros me through<br/>\na wall, and this blue caster kills me before I ever see him.<br/>\n/q<br/>\nexit<br/>\naccount<br/>\ncancel account<br/>\nenter password<br/>\nyes I&#39;m sure<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d like to thank all the bards here for all their help (and for putting up<br/>\nwith me), too many names to name, and I dont want to leave anyone out.<br/>\nThis<br/>\nhas been a fun and informative set of emails for a very long time for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe I&#39;ll start the &quot;Former Bards of Norrath&quot; guild if Anarchy Online ever<br/>\nmakes it public :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
