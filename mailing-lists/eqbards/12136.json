There&#39;s a plateau on the right just a<br/>\nlittle ways into the zone.  Clear trash for HG&#39;s to spawn.<br/>\n<br/>\nTechniques seem good.  You wont beat Grim in a foot/feather race until 37ish<br/>\nsomewhere - maybe even more?  I can beat him now at 38/39 - didn&#39;t try much<br/>\nbefore.  One time in 35 I think - pretty sure I was doing something foolish<br/>\nlike pulling Grim for a group cuz I had tracking and could find him and I<br/>\nhad to get creative as I was down to my last bub.  I hit charm and luckily<br/>\nit stuck. I had pet guard here hotkey&#39;d and hit it. Then Selos again and<br/>\nbarely made the wood bridge. The party killed him before I got back for my<br/>\nxp &lt;sigh&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\n&lt;Spirit of the Moon&gt;<br/>\nBard of the 39th song<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:John_Senior@...\">John_Senior@...</a><br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:John_Senior@...\">John_Senior@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tWednesday, December 22, 1999 4:46 AM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n\t\tSubject:\tRe: [eqbards] Killing Giants in your low<br/>\n30ies<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:John_Senior@...\">John_Senior@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tHello all,<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tI made level 31 the other day, and a bubble of that exp was<br/>\nmade killing<br/>\n\t\tGiants in N Karana, I think I&#39;ve got the art of charming<br/>\nmastered but I<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t[snips]<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tWell, enough of my rabbling, I&#39;m really just interested in<br/>\nsome comments,<br/>\n\t\tsuggestions or feedback with regard to my charming methods<br/>\nand places to<br/>\n\t\thunt that are good for charming.........<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tMany Thanks<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tMadagan Songweaver, Bard of 31 Songs - Veeshan Server<br/>\n\t\t&quot;Where ever there is trouble, there you shall find my<br/>\ncorpse&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
