Nobody was around the spectres and the<br/>\nisland was unbroken. As soon as I broke the spawn there were 3 other groups<br/>\nwho jumped in and started pulling spectres. One even ran us over with their<br/>\npull while we were medding and healing. I guess it&#39;s bound to happen since<br/>\nI&#39;m pulling the spectres so far away. Seems rude on from one perspective,<br/>\nbut from another it seems inevitable unless you are sitting smack dab on<br/>\nthe island.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve found that a lot on Bertoxx.  At first, I just thought it was a<br/>\ncoincidence that when my group broke the spawn up a bit, dr00ds started<br/>\npulling singles to kite.  However, of the past 4 or 5 times we&#39;ve hunted the<br/>\nspecs, the story&#39;s always the same.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, there&#39;s limited flat areas around the Spectre island to pull to that<br/>\naren&#39;t occupied by lower levels.  Typically, most people pull to the side<br/>\nwith the inn on it, or at the top near the Dervish camp.  It&#39;s inevitable<br/>\nthat someone will pull across you, or be chasing a spectre through you,<br/>\nespecially if you&#39;re medding/healing on it&#39;s path.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
