I think it makes a more efficient puller.  When I pull with an enchanter in the group, I try to pull as many mobs as I can, ON PURPOSE.  This saves the time it takes me to go back out and find another mob to pull.  (usually the 2nd I COULD have pulled has been pulled by another group.)  Unless it&#39;s against mobs that are extremelly strong 1 at a time anyway, I make it my mission to bring back as many mobs as possible.  It&#39;s when we don&#39;t have an enchanter that I can take a break and just bring back one mob.  : )<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a caveat, your puller should know the relative strength of each mob they&#39;re pulling and know if your party can still handle them all one at a time without a chance to heal or med.<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkfox Reven&#39;tsol<br/>\nBard of Xegony<br/>\n  ACK!

No enchanter = careful skilled puller or<br/>\n  &gt;evac.  Enchanter in group = lazy overconfident stupid puller that<br/>\n  &gt;eventually<br/>\n  &gt;forces the group to evac anyhow.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;These days when I do group with an enchanter, either I pull with<br/>\n  &gt;Lament or a<br/>\n  &gt;monk pulls.  If the puller goes all day without using Mez for multiple mobs<br/>\n  &gt;once, then that&#39;s fine.  Enchanters in a group should be doing a few things<br/>\n  &gt;only: Nuking, giving clarity, occasional buffing, and changing into a<br/>\n  &gt;different into different forms occasionally to add some spice to the<br/>\n  &gt;monotony.  When combined with mana song, it makes a group twice as<br/>\n  &gt;powerful.<br/>\n  &gt;Nothing better then a nuking enchanter in my opinion.  Means the<br/>\n  &gt;rest of the<br/>\n  &gt;group is actually doing their jobs :-).<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;Now, breaking a spawn using an enchanter and mez is an ENTIRELY different<br/>\n  &gt;thing, BUT once the spawn is broken, then enchanter should never<br/>\n  &gt;have to mez<br/>\n  &gt;again.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;Taneran Dreamweaver<br/>\n  &gt;&lt;Clan Jax&gt;<br/>\n  &gt;Bard of the 40th song (active again)<br/>\n  &gt;Prexus<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; Sent: Friday, March 03, 2000 3:54 PM<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n  &gt;&gt; Subject: Re: [eqbards] Breaking from conventional tactics<br/>\n  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; On Fri, 3 Mar 2000, Sylly Songsynger wrote:<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; From: &quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Conventional tactics in EQ when you pull multiple mobs is for<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; everyone to<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; /assist the main tank and take out the mobs one by one.<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; &gt; E N C H A N T E R<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; &gt; Don&#39;t leave home without one.<br/>\n  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; You don&#39;t always have an enchanter in the group, so the topic<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; still warrants discussion.  Some of the things you find are<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; not so obvious.<br/>\n  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; For example, in a 2-mob pull, I&#39;ll usually Pixie Strike the<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; weaker (less chance of resists, less damage I take when I&#39;m<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; resisted) while the group kills the stronger.  We found out<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; the hard way that a paladin + ranger + cleric take a really<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; really long time and use up almost all their mana to kill a<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; bok knight.  Meanwhile, I sat there PSing a dar knight for<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; probably 5-8 minutes, occasionally tossing in a buff here or<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; there trying to make myself somewhat useful.<br/>\n  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; The next time this happened, I just PSed the bok continuously<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; (no other buffs) while the group killed the dar.  Not only did<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; they manage to kill the dar, they killed another dar, wan, and<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; urd who wandered into the fight.  The bok only woke up twice,<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; and I was able to get it back under control requiring only a<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; single heal.  Then all of us killed the bok.  If we&#39;d done it<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; the other way, I would&#39;ve ended up having to control 2 dars, a<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; wan, and an urd while my group fought the bok.  (Controlling 4<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; mobs is not impossible, but really difficult - charm one, PS 2<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; others.)<br/>\n  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; Also, mez is not the ultimate crowd control solution.  If your<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; enchanter has multiple mobs mezed and your group is taking a<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; long time to hack down each one, there&#39;s a danger the<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; enchanter could go OOM keeping up the mezes.  In that case,<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; it&#39;s better to charm a couple mobs (both you and enchanter<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; can, but probably safer if only you do it so the enchanter can<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; keep up the mezing).  That&#39;ll help the group kill the current<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; target much more quickly.  When I try to do this, nothing<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; annoys me more than an enchanter who insists on mezing the mob<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; I&#39;m charming.  (I did this to Rokenn&#39;s pet once so I&#39;m not<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; completely innocent either.  :)<br/>\n  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; Another mistake I see groups make is to not take their time<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; when they have the luxury of crowd control.  Too many people<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; feel that immediately after killing a mob, they have to start<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; hacking away at the next mesmerized mob.  In one unfortunate<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; case, the cleric went OOM healing us from the current mob, the<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; tanks killed it, and instead of waiting to give the cleric<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; some time to rest up, immediately jumped on the next mob.<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; They also (incorrectly) followed the &quot;kill the caster first&quot;<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; rule when a relatively weak melee mob was also standing by<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; mezed.  As a result, the caster nuked two of the melee folks<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; to death before we bailed out of the situation.<br/>\n  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; I explained it to them afterwards - in between mezed mob kills<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; is basically free time, equivalent to you being able to cast<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; heals and buffs with zero combat delay, debuff the mob with no<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; threat of retalization, and being able to med and (with a<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; bard) heal up.  Next time this happened they listened when I<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; said &quot;kill the (green) melee mob next.&quot;  As a result, the<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; cleric had about 45 seconds to med in peace, while I played<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; Clarity and Hymn to give each of the tanks back about a half<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; bubble despite the damage they were taking from the greenie.<br/>\n  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; So there are lots of situations where turning conventional<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; tactics on their head result in better outcomes.<br/>\n  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; --<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; John H.
