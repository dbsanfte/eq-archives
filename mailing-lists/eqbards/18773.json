Shrink, and castable on anyone in your<br/>\nparty. Now that&#39;s an effect. Summon food and drink just show a complete<br/>\nlack of imagination, IMO.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the AC issue is mainly an annoyance because it&#39;s the same as<br/>\nrangers. Dispite the moaning from rangers about how they are a tank and<br/>\nneed high AC, Verant obviously had something different in mind for them<br/>\nor they wouldn&#39;t be a chain base class like rogues and shaman. Just like<br/>\nVerant obviously had something different in mind for bards than the<br/>\ntravelling minstrel cliche or they wouldn&#39;t be duel wielding plate<br/>\nwearers. Verant (Brad) already admitted they erred in making ranger<br/>\nquest armor too high ac but it was too late to change it, but now they<br/>\nare cutting the ac of bard&#39;s armor for no appearant reason, just like<br/>\nbards were originally left off the list for black enamelled bp and the<br/>\noriginal planes armor had comparatively lousy ac.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think whoever had the original vision for bards at Verant is long<br/>\ngone, and there&#39;s no one to speak up when the remaining designers don&#39;t<br/>\nstay consistant with that original vision.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
