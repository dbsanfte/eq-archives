But I&#39;ve found, <br/>\n&gt; discouragingly, that most<br/>\n&gt; casters never have theirs memmed and that&#39;s precious time <br/>\n&gt; that we need those<br/>\n&gt; buffs OFF :)  and I can have their dmg shield down in at <br/>\n&gt; least 3 seconds<br/>\n&gt; (and I&#39;ve never needed more than 2 pulses)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>i would say most of the fights i find myself in are single mobs and for<br/>\nwhatever reason i seem to almost always find myself grouped with a shaman.<br/>\nso in my case, the damage shield is not as effective since the mob is<br/>\nswinging so slowly, and there are not multiple mobs beating on us.  so i<br/>\nwould sing mystic shielding against caster mobs, especially shaman to avoid<br/>\nthe tanks getting slowed.  whatever we are fighting i will always have<br/>\nrondo+cantana up, just depends on the group and what we&#39;re fighting what my<br/>\nthird song will be, just usually is not a damage shield.  or i am lazy and<br/>\ndon&#39;t play a third song (very often!) =b  lots and lots of single mobs+long<br/>\nlong long experience camps = lazy.<br/>\n<br/>\ni do need to mess around more with damage shields though, since i have<br/>\nbracer+rondo w/horn+psalm+druid/mage to get some serious DMG shield going.<br/>\nanother thing is the psalms cancel people&#39;s ultravision (or did they fix<br/>\nthat?) and i have gotten that complaint before.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hmm I haven&#39;t messed with mystic shielding much.  I usually use warmth<br/>\n&gt; (because it stacks with druid and magician shields) and extra <br/>\n&gt; dmg is always<br/>\n&gt; nice.  Do you find it more useful than dmg shields?  Groups <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m in actually<br/>\n&gt; prefer it over Hymn during combat.  (Dunno for sure which is <br/>\n&gt; better ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
