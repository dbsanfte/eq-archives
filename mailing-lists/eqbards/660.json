I like to skirt the south zone wall <br/>\n(following the desert mountain) westward.<br/>\n<br/>\nEventually you&#39;ll zone into West Commons. Just keep following the south wall <br/>\nrunning west. Watch out for homers though. If you keep following the wall <br/>\nyou&#39;ll get to zone point for Kithicor Forest.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter zoning into Kithicor, follow the right wall. You will reach Rivervale <br/>\nshortly. This is where you have the option of going the Rivervale/Misty <br/>\nThicket/Runnyeye/Beholder route, or you can continue past Rivervale and <br/>\nshortly you will reach the zone to Highpass.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know exact directions in Highpass to get to the zone to East <br/>\nKaranas...I get lost there usually, but if you survive and you look around <br/>\nyou should eventually zone to the Easter Karanas.<br/>\n<br/>\nFollow the canyon cliff path down to the bottom and head due west. You <br/>\nshould hit water, head south. You will see a great chain link bridge.<br/>\n<br/>\nCross it and you will  zone into North Karanas. Basically in the Karanas you <br/>\njust keep running due west, careful to avoid homers and griffons. You will <br/>\nzone into West Karanas eventually.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, run due west (follow road if you want). Careful to avoid the nasties <br/>\n(and stear clear of Choon and Froon and the ogre camp unless you are a <br/>\nbadass). The zone entry to Qeynos Hills is on the west wall of the West <br/>\nKaranas.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Runnyeye/Beholder route is a little more complicated, but I like <br/>\nit...it&#39;s very easy to run through and I&#39;ve personally never had any <br/>\nproblems, BUT from what I hear I&#39;ve been lucky. Instead of making this <br/>\ne-mail longer, if you want to check out that route, I would suggest going <br/>\ninto Rivervale, and asking for a guide.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\n<br/>\nSartori of Kelethin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
