Is a 16th level wizard considerably more dangerous than a 15th, because of<br/>\nhis new spells? YES! And yet if you are 17th, one cons high blue and the other a<br/>\nlow blue.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe range that cons cover and there messages change as you level to cover broader<br/>\nranges. At Level 4 for example, black/white is the same level as you, blue is L3<br/>\n(one level lower), yellow is L5 (one level higher), and red is 2+ levels higher<br/>\n(L6+). In the mid teens the con messages change, so that blue is within two levels<br/>\nbelow you, and yellow two higher. In the mid 20s, the messages gain further range,<br/>\nyellow is still 2 higher, but blue can be up to 6(?) levels lower. When I<br/>\ndetermine whether I want to risk soloing, I very rarely fight anything blue unless<br/>\nI know the monster well. I stick to the high green con message.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo reiterate, the con message is only an indication of your target&#39;s level with<br/>\nrespect to your own, and nothing more. Just remember that because of special<br/>\nskills and spell circles different races are stronger at certain levels then<br/>\nothers, particularly when it comes to casters.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and named NPCs are always harder than their con. DVinn, Dorn, and the SK in<br/>\nwest commons (Garrick Dix or something) are all examples that come to mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nAriell Thunderwolf, Karana<br/>\n<br/>\nBob Stewart wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; &gt;My view is , how the heck do you<br/>\n&gt; &gt;know where to go and what you can kill ?
