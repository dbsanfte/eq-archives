Every time I hear something like this it reminds me how little<br/>\nsupport you get from Verant.  I have an A3d card which Verant claims is<br/>\nsupported.  However, I do not hear the sounds mobs make outside of combat.<br/>\nThat&#39;s right, no howling wolves, no chittering beetles, and more importantly<br/>\nno stomping giants.  Every giant in the game can sneak right up on me and<br/>\npound away to his heart&#39;s content.  It was 3 months before I even knew I<br/>\nwasn&#39;t hearing these sounds till a friend started complaining about all the<br/>\ndruids running around howling.  He came over and listened to my system and<br/>\nwas shocked.  Needless to say Verant&#39;s support was terrible.  They had three<br/>\nsuggestions.  Get the latest drivers.  Done no change.  Turn down Hardware<br/>\nAcceleration.  Done, no change.  Get an SBLive card.  ???  They say the card<br/>\nI have is not only supported, but tested to work as well?  Anybody else have<br/>\nthese problems?  Another guildmate of mine has a different A3d card and it<br/>\nworks fine.  His is from a secondary manufacturer and mine is from A3d.<br/>\nYou&#39;d think he would be the one with the problem?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4 [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, February 01, 2000 1:26 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] SBLive crashes (was Powerleveling doesnt mean L50 +<br/>\nrant)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a SBLive and haven&#39;t run into any problems yet (knock on wood).  To<br/>\nbe on the safe side, yesterday I downloaded the most recent drivers from the<br/>\nCreative website and installed them.  I was shocked when I logged in.  Prior<br/>\nto installing the updated drivers, the sound in EQ was pretty good.  After<br/>\ninstalling the new drivers, it got even better.  The Environmental Audio<br/>\nsupport improved dramatically.  I started hearing sound effects that I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t even know were in the game.  The most recent SBLive driver is from<br/>\nNov 99 so if you don&#39;t have it download it and give it a try.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;m living there until I can play EQ again for more then 30 minutes<br/>\n&gt; without my SB Live crashing me out.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nGET A NEXTCARD VISA, in 30 seconds.
