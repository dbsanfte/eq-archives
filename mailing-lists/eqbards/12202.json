However, bards are group-centric<br/>\n&gt;class, so if your aim is to more or less solo to 50 I&#39;d look at Necros or<br/>\n&gt;Druids (but bards are much more fun).  Soloing is very difficult past about<br/>\n&gt;level 12, so if you&#39;re soloing now, that is probably why you&#39;re seeing your<br/>\n&gt;experience slow down.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Actually your ability to solo gets a big boost at 18th lvl when you get <br/>\nDenon&#39;s Disruptive Discord.  Just get your brass skill maxed at 18th then <br/>\nuse the all instrument attack (Horn + Discord, equip Lute play Chords of <br/>\nDissounce, play Hymn of Restoration, equip Horn & play Discord, repeat.)  <br/>\nYou will take down blues & some whites with little or no down time.  By the <br/>\ntime this gets too dangerous for solo work you get charm & fear.  Then you <br/>\ncan solo by getting two like leveled mobs to kill each other & fear/chain <br/>\nthe victor.  Also at that time (high 20&#39;s) you can go to the High Keep <br/>\nbasement.  I found this a great place for pick up parties, and since you can <br/>\nbe bound in the same zone your downtime due to death is virtually nil.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood Hunting!<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn Swiftsong - Karana server<br/>\n<br/>\nEQ Bard Song Analysis<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://rgonzalez.net/EQSongs/\">http://rgonzalez.net/EQSongs/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
