Looks like it&#39;ll be a<br/>\nhelluva long time before I go there then :o)~<br/>\n<br/>\n-=B=-<br/>\nSafe, happy, and 23rd in the Plains of Karana<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;The character of Mistmoore depends a large part on what the<br/>\n&gt;other people in there are doing.  Sometimes everyone is good<br/>\n&gt;about keeping fights localized in their area and announcing<br/>\n&gt;trains.  I&#39;ve made nearly a level in a night playing in<br/>\n&gt;Mistmoore under these circumstances, and the action was<br/>\n&gt;nonstop.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Other times one or more groups are really rude and pull stuff<br/>\n&gt;deep from the castle to the zone or don&#39;t announce their<br/>\n&gt;constant trains.  I&#39;ve fought one familiar, then spent the<br/>\n&gt;next half hour keeping my group invisible waiting for the<br/>\n&gt;train to dissipate, kill another familiar, spend another half<br/>\n&gt;hour waiting for another train to leave, etc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If you&#39;re clearing out yard trash, there is absolutely no<br/>\n&gt;reason you should ever see the Will Sapper and Soul<br/>\n&gt;Seductress.  There are several spots near the zone that are<br/>\n&gt;out of the path of trains.  Find them and work from there.  If<br/>\n&gt;the trains are just too frequent, then there are some idiots<br/>\n&gt;in the zone - leave and try again another night.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;John H.
