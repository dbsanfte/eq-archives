On the other hand, there are a LOT of Bard twinks with money to<br/>\nthrow around, which screws things up.  My friend sold SS arms just this last weekend for 5kpp.  Luckily<br/>\nfor me, I&#39;m in a guild which just hands stuff around if another guild member needs it, so I have 4 pieces<br/>\nwithout ever having seen one drop.  I think if you&#39;re patient, you&#39;ll find someone who&#39;s having trouble<br/>\ndumping the stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m using a Lizardscale Cloak myself.  I was wondering the same thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 54 songs, Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\nPS - Apologies to the foreigners and digest folks for my last message, I forgot to delete all the stuff at<br/>\nthe bottom.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Cyr, Thierry&quot; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; That is somewhat true... Lotsa SS out there, lots of it belongs to warriors<br/>\n&gt; and stuff that think cobalt is an even trade for (haha right!)  So i keep to<br/>\n&gt; myself quiet... Got free ss boots a while back from a friend. Got a free SS<br/>\n&gt; helm other night from some friends who just came out of seb. And 2 nights<br/>\n&gt; ago i get a few people asking me about bards in guildchat, one was asking me<br/>\n&gt; what i was using because he wanted to &quot;twink&quot; his level 30 bard (ok at least<br/>\n&gt; its not a lev 4). And then a good buddie sends me a tell right afterwards<br/>\n&gt; asking me if i had my ss gloves, i told him thats why im hunting in karnors<br/>\n&gt; at 41. Soooo next time i see his chanter i get a free set of ss gloves.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Another question: what are people using as a cloak? (other then cloak of<br/>\n&gt; flames)<br/>\n&gt; I got a kunzar cloak last night (hey i was using bronze) and was wondering<br/>\n&gt; if i should ask my buddy to trade me his lizzie cloak, or should i try to<br/>\n&gt; buy a better cloak, if so which?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Minkin<br/>\n&gt; Sol Ro </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
