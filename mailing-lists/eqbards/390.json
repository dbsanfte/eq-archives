Until you&#39;re about level 11 or<br/>\n12, never bust an orc camp without Lamenting them and having a good cleric<br/>\nwith you. Those centurions can mess you up real quick. If you&#39;re unlucky to<br/>\nhave a legionairre in the mix then you&#39;ll be seeing Freeport faster than you<br/>\ncan turn around. Oracles are not so bad. Apprentices are weak but they like<br/>\nto blind you, very disconcerting when a cent is beating the life outta you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAs far as groups go at that level, I&#39;d try North Ro. Most of the creatures<br/>\nthere are solitary and a good fetcher will bring it back to the grassy area.<br/>\nThis allows you to Wince away without fear of pulling anything big in. It<br/>\nalso means you&#39;ll drain less water. Lastly, the guard is near in case things<br/>\ngo way bad unless you&#39;re taking on madmen, dervish, or pumas. I&#39;ve also<br/>\nfound the people in North Ro to be a bit more serious about grouping than<br/>\nanywhere else since the distribution of creatures almost requires a group to<br/>\nget anywhere.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd the biggest thing about North Ro... No griffins!<br/>\n<br/>\n\tGood Journey,<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tSineras (Cazic-Thule)<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Daniel P.

I&#39;m finding level 9 to be excruciatingly<br/>\nslow going...  Any pointers?  I spent a huge amount of time tonight with a<br/>\nlarge group at east commons orc camp.  They want me to use the Discord<br/>\nsong - so all the orcs jump me.  I get killed instantly.  The rest proceed<br/>\nto wipe out the rest as I memorize and work my way back.  Before I get<br/>\nthere - they all decide it&#39;s late and log off.  Not a one bothered to wait<br/>\nand offer me a share of silver or loot...  Wasted about an hour and ended up<br/>\nwith LESS XP than I started..<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m under the impression now - I&#39;m better off pairing off with someone at<br/>\nthis point than trying large groups...  Large seem to take forever to do<br/>\nanyting - and I&#39;m not getting much xp or loot..<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde of Xegony<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nHave you visited the new ONElist home page lately?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\nONElist: The Leading e-mail list and community service on the Internet!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
