It amazes me, day after day, how a low level mob (to<br/>\nus) can sustain over 100 points of damage in a split second, and STILL get<br/>\ntheir spells off 90% of the time, while a bard is bashed for a single point<br/>\nof damage and their song ends, or a spellcaster is smacked for as single<br/>\npoint of damage and their spell is interrupted. Is this something Verant did<br/>\nto &quot;give the monsters a chance&quot;? Kinda like how a low level mob can smack<br/>\nyou for 55 points of damage with a single swing, while we bards probably<br/>\nwill never be able to dish out that type of damage, even when our levels<br/>\napproach the 40&#39;s?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd does anyone know how &quot;stunning&quot; works? It seems like whenever I am hit,<br/>\nI am auto-stunned half the time, whether it was for 50 points, or 1 point of<br/>\ndamage I receive. Does it have anything to do with my armor? With my Stamina<br/>\nor Strength scores? Any ideas?<br/>\n<br/>\n/RANT OFF<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry for the rant, it&#39;s the only thing I can think of to complain about!<br/>\n(smile)<br/>\n<br/>\nTim - Tallonn - Bertox<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Sean Kennedy &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:orang@...\">orang@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Saturday, July 03, 1999 3:09 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Lore stuff (OT)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Sean Kennedy&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:orang@...\">orang@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;From: John Kim &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Another example, I can&#39;t wield 2 dragoon dirks.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&lt;sarcasm&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;I&#39;m sorry you have to operate at 98% potential effectiveness<br/>\n&gt;&gt;using a different weapon in your second hand instead of<br/>\n&gt;&gt;another dirk.  Just think - if you were wielding two dirks and<br/>\n&gt;&gt;found another better weapon, you&#39;d have to operate at 98%<br/>\n&gt;&gt;effectiveness until you could get another of that new weapon.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Why doesn&#39;t Verant just make the mobs drop two of each weapon<br/>\n&gt;&gt;at a time?  Oh the horror.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&lt;/sarcasm&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;The game is perfectly playable using a different weapon in<br/>\n&gt;&gt;your off hand.  What you are complaining about is a &quot;want,&quot;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;not a &quot;need.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;What&#39;s the big deal with people wanting 2 of the same item?<br/>\n&gt;Just from a game mechanics point of view, 2 items with differing<br/>\n&gt;delays are better.  They get out of synch, and allow shorter<br/>\n&gt;windows for casters to get a spell off.  Plus, I LIKE the way<br/>\n&gt;different weapon combo&#39;s look. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Check out this week&#39;s ONElist of the week.<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;How is ONElist changing YOUR life?
