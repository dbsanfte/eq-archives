Think I&#39;ll focus on making it to<br/>\n17 then see what I can afford. The Dirk will get me that far.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Do I have a chance at skipping it and camping for a PGT before 20?<br/>\n &quot;I don&#39;t know yer server but on the Rathe Hell NO&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nPinen: LOL, appreciate the blunt truth )<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Unless you get a group to help you camp the PGT spawn, it will be almost<br/>\nimpossible for you to get a PGT by yourself. &lt;snip&gt; The going rate for a PGT<br/>\non E&#39;ci is around 300PP if<br/>\nyou don&#39;t want to camp for it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin: No way I can afford that today. But appreciate the camping advice.<br/>\nAlready noticed the group benefit last night in a FFA battle (bards and<br/>\nshamans rock!)<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Depends on the jerk ratio on your server.  On Karana it&#39;s<br/>\nseemingly forever camped by kill stealers and casters who<br/>\ncan&#39;t use it (hint - write down their names, and never group<br/>\nwith them once you get the mana song).&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn Kim: Excellent idea. I&#39;ve found that to be true in other areas as well.<br/>\nWhen you discover a player is just self-serving and gives nothing, not even<br/>\na thanks, I think the best response is to ignore them. You can&#39;t teach these<br/>\npeople anything, and they are more than happy to escalate a confrontation<br/>\nwith posturing, profanity, and character-defaming shouts. Wit and wisdom are<br/>\nlost on them, so why bother wasting the gift of your presence on such as<br/>\nthey? : )<br/>\n<br/>\nOperaman<br/>\nMeandering Maestro<br/>\nSaving the profanity for those long corpse retrieval runs<br/>\nInnoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
