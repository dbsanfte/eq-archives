You can imagine how pissed off I was when I lost exp after<br/>\nthe fight. Why? You ask.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, his pet killed me, causing me to die from a NPC, which also is the<br/>\nsame as dieing via a normal mob. The duel was void and I lost 1/2 bub exp<br/>\n(this was back at level 29 or so, he was 31). So, I must stress, NEVER<br/>\nfight a mage in a duel because if you die you can kiss goodbye to your exp<br/>\n(if the pet gets the last hit and kills you).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAbraham Hardjana &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ahardjan@...\">ahardjan@...</a>&gt; on 04/01/2000<br/>\n15:47:19<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease respond to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nTo:   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\ncc:    (bcc: John Senior/M&G)<br/>\nSubject:  Re: [eqbards] Has anyone dueled a magician?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Abraham Hardjana &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ahardjan@...\">ahardjan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n*sigh*<br/>\n<br/>\nThis teaches me to write an email just before I went to sleep.

When grouped all spells and effects that are<br/>\n&gt; &gt;harmful to your group members does not hit.  I know for a fact that<br/>\ncharm<br/>\n&gt; &gt;works.  Heck I used it on my bride to be two patches after the PvP charm<br/>\n&gt; &gt;patch and it worked without a problem.  If this is not the case then my<br/>\n&gt; &gt;bride will spank this poor bard when we duel this coming Saturday...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Treilanin Loreweaver<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;On Mon, 3 Jan 2000, Beatdrop Battledrum wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: &quot;Beatdrop Battledrum&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Beatdrop@...\">Beatdrop@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Last night I was in a group in Highkeep and we got on the topic of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;dueling.  While I was running my mouth, the magician I was with<br/>\nchallenged<br/>\n&gt; &gt;me to a duel.  We were the same level (29) and I said what the hell.  He<br/>\n&gt; &gt;had a fire elemental pet that was blue to me so I decided that the only<br/>\nway<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I would stand a chance would be to try to charm him into fighting his<br/>\npet.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Well, let me just say that I thought charm was only nerfed on the PvP<br/>\n&gt; &gt;servers and NOT in PvP mode.  Wrong!  So I start the duel with the<br/>\nthought<br/>\n&gt; &gt;of charming him.  Hit the song, and wait, and wait, and wait... no<br/>\npulse!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;WTF? So I try charming his pet that is now attacking me.  Resist,<br/>\nresist,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;(thinking cool, its pulsing, gonna work), charm sticks but no charm!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Instead I got a message saying &#39;This NPC cannot be charmed.&#39; Dammit!<br/>\nNOOO!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Meanwhile, I am getting the hell nuked out of me while trying to figure<br/>\nout<br/>\n&gt; &gt;what to do next.  So I die.  I pop back up and my opponents health bar<br/>\nis<br/>\n&gt; &gt;down (still grouped) and I hear &#39;Beat, Demi is getting the sh*t kicked<br/>\nout<br/>\n&gt; &gt;of him.&#39;  Come to find out, after looting my corpse, that after I died,<br/>\nhis<br/>\n&gt; &gt;pet agro&#39;d on him.  Strange charm bug is what I am assuming.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Has anyone on the list dueled a magician or a caster with a pet and<br/>\nwon?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  He was a really cool guy and I asked him for a rematch some other<br/>\ntime.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;My new tactic is just like how I would fight a wizzie, below him to<br/>\ndeath.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;His pet wasn&#39;t hitting to hard and I think I can solo his pet by melee<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; &gt;songs.  So, I think I can take him by just staying on his butt and<br/>\nkeeping<br/>\n&gt; &gt;his spells interrupted.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Any other suggestions?
