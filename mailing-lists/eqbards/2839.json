If you are slightly off it<br/>\nconsiders that a drop.  This IMHO is a programming UI design flaw.  They<br/>\nshould consider this that the area very near the hotkeys - while in high res<br/>\nis in fact &quot;ground&quot; (or if a person is nearby opens trade window); if you<br/>\nare dropping or trading - Humans are unlikely to want to drop it way off to<br/>\nthe bottom-left at the edge of their peripheral vision - but in drop (or<br/>\nhand-off) things right in front of them.  The UI should be smart enough to<br/>\ncompensate and not trigger the drop/trade code.  I guess Verant can justify<br/>\nthis as the possibility of fumbling and dropping a weapon while switching in<br/>\nthe heat of battle (but if that is the case AGI or DEX or both should<br/>\ncalculate in on this)....<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing to keep in mind - you are aiming the POINTER not the item for the<br/>\ncenter of the box.  I think this confusion sometimes (at least for me)<br/>\ncauses me to drop the item).<br/>\n<br/>\nReally the best way is to stay in low-res.  I basically NEVER drop items in<br/>\nthe low res screen...<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde &lt;Army of Virtue&gt; of Xegony<br/>\nLevel 18<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Corbolu- bard &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_corbolu@...\">eq_corbolu@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Sunday, July 04, 1999 7:19 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Juggling instruments<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Corbolu- bard &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_corbolu@...\">eq_corbolu@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The trick is to use them as hotbuttons, make 4 or 5 (depending on if you<br/>\naf<br/>\n&gt; a shield i.e second weapon and depending on how much instruments you<br/>\nhave). </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
