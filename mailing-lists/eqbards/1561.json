She said<br/>\nmeditating is really boring so she&#39;d already timed it and<br/>\nfigured out how it works.  She said every 8 seconds, you get a<br/>\nchance to succeed at meditating.  If you succeed, your mana<br/>\njumps up by X amount (not sure how X is determined) - a pulse.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith the Jig playing, it was about 6 seconds between each<br/>\nmeditation pulse.  These weren&#39;t attempts at accurate timings,<br/>\nbut the effect was obvious.  Using a drum made no difference -<br/>\n6 seconds with or without.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
