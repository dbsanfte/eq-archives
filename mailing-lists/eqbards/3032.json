I do have a problem with having to<br/>\n&quot;work out my wrists&quot; to learn a repeated pattern.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve found some other classes to require concentration, so far not the<br/>\ntwitchiness of Bards, and yes, with hot keys.  I enjoy having to think in<br/>\nbattle.  However, a Bard (unlike other casters) has to twitch to keep up 2<br/>\nbuffs/restores even when resting, and twitches to weave a buff/Selo when<br/>\ntravelling and twitches insanely if twisting and trying melee.  So while on<br/>\nother casters, my fingers fly for short fight, they then get to rest while<br/>\nthe party rests.  On Bards I&#39;m finding thats not so.  Seems party<br/>\nexpectations and usefulness are determined by the Bard managing to twist<br/>\ncontinously.  Some mid-level Bards feel free to tell me if I&#39;m wrong .. but<br/>\nthis is what I&#39;m reading here.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am a carpal tunnel &quot;dodger&quot; with the ergonomic keyboard, trackball mouse<br/>\n& pad, proper height chair .. etc ... and a diagnosable mild coordination<br/>\nproblem to boot.  As long as I don&#39;t play &quot;twitch&quot; games (a.k.a. most 1st<br/>\nperson shooters) I do fine.  I guess I&#39;ve just been a little surprised by<br/>\nthe Bard&#39;s need to twist constantly.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 03:09 PM 7/7/99 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Bob Stewart &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bstewart@...\">bstewart@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;At 02:02 PM 7/7/99 -0500, Roop Dirump wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Not only that, I think EVERY class has to do something with hot keys during<br/>\n&gt;&gt;a battle!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Comparing to real complications, consider a battle cleric, such as played<br/>\n&gt;by a friend of mine and as I&#39;ve tried some myself.  During combat, while<br/>\n&gt;you&#39;re hitting and perhaps being hit, you have to keep an eye everyone&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;health and if someone is getting too low, target, cast, then return to the<br/>\n&gt;target you were hitting.  Make that worse by using your own damage spells<br/>\n&gt;sometimes, balancing that against potentially vital healing.  And you get<br/>\n&gt;to decide what&#39;s &quot;too low.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Makes playing a bard and twisting songs seem easy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;\tBob<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Campaign 2000 is here!<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Discuss your thoughts; get informed at ONElist.
