A rogue offered me a Polished Granite Tomahawk and a<br/>\n&gt; Dragoon Dirk for the Shard.  Now personally I am leaning toward keeping the<br/>\n&gt; Shard, but I know I could barter the PGT into either a good bit of plat<br/>\n&gt; (saving for steel plate) or a nice item or two.  Any and all advise is<br/>\n&gt; welcome....<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hi fellow Karanan bard,<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t know if this is too late or not.  In terms of weapons, the shard and the<br/>\ntomahawk are roughly equal.  The shard is a better weapon, barely, but the<br/>\ntomahawk&#39;s effect is slightly better I think.   The dirk is a great weapon, but<br/>\nvery common.  Monetarily, if you made that trade, you would come out ahead.  But<br/>\nspeaking monetarily, I also think you could sell the shard for more than 200<br/>\nplat as well.  Go with your heart. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nJyzan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
