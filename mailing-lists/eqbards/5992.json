I haven&#39;t been playing lately (what&#39;s there to do<br/>\nfor a L49 bard?) but I dropped in on the weekend to chat with friends<br/>\nand heard one particularly depressing story. <br/>\n<br/>\n18 people went to PoF on Tarrew last week to try to do some adventuring.<br/>\nWithin 5 minutes they were all dead. It took 9 hours for some of them to<br/>\nget their bodies back. Some of them never did and have quit the game.<br/>\nOthers, in frustration, allowed themselves to die until they were<br/>\nknocked back to L45, at which time they were able to get their bodies<br/>\nretrieved for them by a GM as they were unable to enter the PoF anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf the 20+ people I used to adventure with regularly on Tarrew Marr, 3<br/>\nwere logged in on Saturday as their L50 characters. The rest may have<br/>\nbeen on as alternates, though the ones I know the names of definately<br/>\nweren&#39;t. Of the Bard&#39;s I know on the server, several have left the game<br/>\nat L48-49 without even bothering to get 50.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
