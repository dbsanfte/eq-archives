This means they don´┐¢t roll versus feign. <br/>\nWhat they get is what amounts to an intelligence check, which every creature <br/>\ngets for these ´┐¢I´┐¢m going to fool you so you don´┐¢t attack me´┐¢ abilities and <br/>\nspells. It&#39;s a very low chance. All cases of direct saves have a much higher <br/>\npercentage of the creature saving.<br/>\n***<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat this seems to be saying is that any spell/effect which &quot;fools&quot; <br/>\ncreatures can be overcome by an intelligence check.  Since invisibility <br/>\n&quot;fools&quot; monsters into thinking you&#39;re not there, it seems to me this would <br/>\naccount for the reason invisibility (whether bardic or from a caster) fails <br/>\noccasionally.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been in situations where I was attacked (e.g.) by GIBS in Lower Guk, <br/>\nwhen my Invis to Undead was still up (well, until they hit me), or where <br/>\n(e.g.) I was attacked by silly lil&#39; ice gobbies in Permafrost while my <br/>\n(druid-cast) invisibility was still up (well, until they hit me).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways, just thought I might have found, accidentally, a reason for one of <br/>\nthe great mysteries of EQ life - why did they attack me when I was <br/>\ninvisible?<br/>\n<br/>\nAloro Silvertongue (E&#39;ci)<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
