I have read <br/>\n&gt; previously on this list<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that our song does stack with an Enchanter&#39;s Clarity spell. <br/>\n&gt;  Does anyone<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have hard number with what percentage increase there is?  <br/>\n&gt; Is it in fact<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; L29 enchanter Clarity was about a 30% reduction in med<br/>\n&gt; time.  L32 bard Clarity was about a 33% reduction in med<br/>\n&gt; time.  L40 bard Clarity was about a 38% reduction in med<br/>\n&gt; time.  These figures are probably +/- 3% or so due to<br/>\n&gt; inaccuracies in eyeballing the mana bar, but it really seems<br/>\n&gt; like a straight level% conversion.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have yet to time the spells/songs stacking, but I have yet<br/>\n&gt; to see any anecdotal claims that they *don&#39;t* stack.  All the<br/>\n&gt; anecdotes I&#39;ve seen people give say one enchanter Clarity plus<br/>\n&gt; as many bard clarities as you like will all stack.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
