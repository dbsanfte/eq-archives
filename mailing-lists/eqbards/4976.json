I was<br/>\nsoloing these guys at lvl 12 without losing more than two bubbles of damage,<br/>\nthen recently at level 13 I hit a few once more and almost died a few times.<br/>\nI know that things that con the same can vary in potency but this is a big<br/>\ndifference. I&#39;ve also noticed this with the skeletons outside of the<br/>\nMinotaur Cave in Steamfront, which helped me make my 12th level and turned<br/>\npromptly to conning green, only to return to blue now at 14th level.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone else see similar things like this happening?<br/>\n<br/>\nBernwyn<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: John Kim &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, August 05, 1999 1:39 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Resistance and Rhythym songs<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: John Kim &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Sat, 5 Jun 1999, SteelWolf wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lightning and Shock of Force. Her primary AoE is the Frost<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Spiral of Al&#39;kabor. How do I know? Because I usually get<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the resist message for force shock, and occassionally get<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it for Frost Spiral. I also think the chance of resisting<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is weighed against either your level or your defense<br/>\n&gt; &gt; skill, because anyone who has been to Unrest at level 20<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and tangled with a hag died in 2-3 spells, while a L30<br/>\n&gt; &gt; takes quite a beating before dying.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I honestly think there are two resist checks going on, kind of<br/>\n&gt; like how when we Chain something it can resist or not, then it<br/>\n&gt; immediately has a chance of breaking out.  It think there is<br/>\n&gt; one extraordinarily difficult resist check to see if you can<br/>\n&gt; take zero damage from the spell.  Then there is another resist<br/>\n&gt; check to determine how much damage you take.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Last night while completing the Staff of the Observers quest,<br/>\n&gt; I ran across a goblin wizard in Butcherblock.  These guys<br/>\n&gt; killed me way too often when I was level 5-7 so I decided to<br/>\n&gt; toy around with him a bit.  I used Curtail (L30 song, targeted<br/>\n&gt; DoT) on him to kill him - no melee.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; During the entire fight, he peppered me with spells (they sure<br/>\n&gt; have got a lot of mana - I&#39;d estimate 20-30 spells).  Most of<br/>\n&gt; them only took off 4 or 5 points damage, but a couple did<br/>\n&gt; about 20.  Then on one spell, I saw a &quot;You resist the...&quot;<br/>\n&gt; message and took no damage.  I had *never* seen that message<br/>\n&gt; for a DD prior to last night (I don&#39;t remember the name<br/>\n&gt; offhand but it was a fire-based DD spell).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That it took a level 8ish mob 20+ spells for me (L30) to see<br/>\n&gt; one complete resist should tell you something about how<br/>\n&gt; difficult this check is.  I was singing Elemental Rhythms at<br/>\n&gt; the time with drum equipped, which put my MR in the 80s and FR<br/>\n&gt; in the 70s.  I wasn&#39;t trying too hard to keep it up though, so<br/>\n&gt; it may have dropped to my natural 35/25.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
