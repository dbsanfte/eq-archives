Kim<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I (Bard 27) went to Permafrost on Sunday with a group of roughly 30 level <br/>\n20-50 players.  Our intention was to invade as far as the room just <br/>\nprior to Lady Vox, and practice on the Ice Giants and Priests.  As one of <br/>\nthe youngest, I was put in the &quot;baby&quot; group, whose job was to mop up the <br/>\nvarious level 25-30 goblins spawning on the upper ledge.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy group had just finished off some goblins, taking some damage, so I was <br/>\nsinging healing at the point when the main group pulled two Ice Giants by <br/>\naccident.  One of them immediately charged past the entire massed group <br/>\nof level 30+ players in order to whack on me.  Since trying to escape <br/>\nwould have meant certain death, I ran back and forth hoping that he would <br/>\n get dumped off on someone else, which luckily happened.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe had stunned me, so I was no longer singing, but I was fortunately only <br/>\ndown to half health, so I went in a corner and stood there quietly <br/>\nwatching the battle.  Very quietly.  At this point, some higher level <br/>\nplayer managed to trigger a third Ice Giant.  What did that Giant do?  He <br/>\ncharged past the entire assembled mass of 30+ players, just like the <br/>\nfirst one, and who did he whack on?  ME.  I cannot believe that my <br/>\nunadjusted charisma was so much higher than ANY of the other players that <br/>\nthis caused the Giant to get ticked at me.  This is just the life of a <br/>\nBard.
