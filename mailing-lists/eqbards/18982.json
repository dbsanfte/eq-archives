(sigh)  We cleared our way in<br/>\npast &quot;the pyramid&quot; and camped the 4 named spawn spots and the Emperor&#39;s<br/>\nguard&#39;s and the Emperor (who must be the one with no clothes or armor<br/>\nbecause I have fought tougher blues than this guy who somehow is level 60 -<br/>\nInfectious Cloud? don;t make me sneeze!)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe got some spells and some weps and some armor and a visit from a guide.<br/>\n&quot;Hey do you guys need a key to open that door?&quot;  We were using a a rogue to<br/>\npick it.  Wonder if a nerf for the door and a buff for the Emp will be in<br/>\ntoday&#39;s patch.  We were in Seb from 1pm central time until 9pm and were the<br/>\nonly group in the place.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we broke in, we cleared to the first bridge and were fighting a froog<br/>\nwhen a Shroom (myconid warrior? reever?) appeared out of nowhere. He got<br/>\nmessed and we kept fighting.  Then another shroom. And another, and another<br/>\nand we ran back to the zone for ease of CR.  Some managed to camp out,<br/>\ncleric gated, a few died inc me.  But my question is - what causes these<br/>\nShrooms to agro?  This is the second time I have seen this in this same spot<br/>\nwith about the same results. And we were careful not to use an AE - just<br/>\ndoing the normal kill froog thing.  Anyone know?  Anyone been to the lower<br/>\nlevels in Seb?<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:garramone@...\">garramone@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, May 24, 2000 11:26 AM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Re: AC<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; and isn&#39;t the new exp in kunark dungeons just dreamy? =)  big noticeable<br/>\n&gt; difference.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Shada Powa, L54 Wood Elf Minstrel </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
