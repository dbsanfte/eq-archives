I rarely twist with healing since even though the<br/>\n&gt; icon stays<br/>\n&gt; up it doesn&#39;t seem to actually heal unless you are playing it when<br/>\n&gt; a pulse<br/>\n&gt; occurs, just like chords.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have tested the healing song, and it does indeed continue healing<br/>\neven if you aren&#39;t playing the song.  Just start up the song and then<br/>\nstop it after you get the indicator for it.  Then press &quot;i&quot; to go to<br/>\ninventory/stat screen and watch the numerical representation of your<br/>\nhealth.  You&#39;ll see it is still green (which I think indicates your<br/>\nhealth is being adjusted by some positive effect) and you&#39;ll see it<br/>\njumps up by more than just 1 point for the next two ticks.  Net<br/>\neffect of starting up the healing song and stopping it as soon as it<br/>\ntakes effect is 3 ticks of enhanced healing (the one it actually<br/>\nstarts up on and the next 2 that it lingers for).  Twisting healing<br/>\nwith other songs can be a very effective way of surving those<br/>\nmonsters you&#39;d otherwise only have a marginal chance of taking out.<br/>\n<br/>\nTigsen<br/>\n_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
