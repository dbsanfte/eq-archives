Keep in mind that our<br/>\ncharm does not last nearly as long as an enchanter or druid charm does.  So<br/>\nin an avg fight, charming just one mob to help with crowd control/melee<br/>\npurposes, you could lose up to a bubble of mana. And of course, wonderfully<br/>\nenough you are on the top of the hate list (just what a bard needs),<br/>\nrequiring an army of tanks to peel it off you.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow imagine starting from an entrance to a dungeon, and clearing your entire<br/>\nway to a specific room, for example Pool Room or King room in SolB... With a<br/>\nfull party or one with an enchanter, it wouldn&#39;t be nearly as bad.  One time<br/>\nthough, it was 3 people, a 40 druid, 40ish ranger and myself (maybe 41 or so<br/>\nat the time.)  We were clearing to the Pool room. The druid would use<br/>\ngrasping roots to put a 3rd mob out of the fight as long as she could, and<br/>\nwas on heal duties.  The ranger was only melee, and snare duty. I was charm<br/>\nand mana song duty ( no melee for me - had my horn out that day). It worked<br/>\nwell.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo to answer your question &quot;when was the last time i ran out of mana...&quot;<br/>\nnot often but it happens...  in rare instances of course.  And after a<br/>\nresurrection, because our bard mana regen rate is so poor, we&#39;re out of or<br/>\nlow on mana for a long time...<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s my song, and I&#39;m stickin to it...<br/>\nPava Rahti &lt;Holy Fire&gt;<br/>\n47 seasons and counting...<br/>\nCazic Thule</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
