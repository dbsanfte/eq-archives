It just doesnt appear to do anything. I think the<br/>\n&gt; Disenchanting Melody is supposed to do what you suggest, but my testing<br/>\n&gt; with it suggested it didn&#39;t do anything either. Maybe it only breaks<br/>\n&gt; enchantments like charm. It doesn&#39;t break root, I know that from<br/>\n&gt; testing. And with only 6 spell slots available, I&#39;ve found it more<br/>\n&gt; useful to keep charm memorized. If one of your party get&#39;s charmed,<br/>\n&gt; charm them back. Charm can also be useful in those rare places where the<br/>\n&gt; Bard is not automatically at the top of every mob&#39;s hate list. There,<br/>\n&gt; the cleric seems to top the list after casting the first heal, and<br/>\n&gt; nothing I could do would distract a mob from beating on him, except<br/>\n&gt; charm. And once the charm wears off you can be sure you are on top of<br/>\n&gt; the mob&#39;s hate list. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -- <br/>\n&gt;   Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n&gt;             GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n&gt;                  b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; With more than 20 million e-mails exchanged daily...<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; ...ONElist is home to the liveliest discussions on the Internet!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
