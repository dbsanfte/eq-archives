The dance isn&#39;t as obvious in combat.  Get right in his face when <br/>\nhe&#39;s resting and you have a chance of scaring the pants off him in RL.  <br/>\nSadly, you will get the message &quot;You aren&#39;t scaring anybody&quot; in EQ.  If my <br/>\nfifty or so attempts are any indication, you don&#39;t get any better trying this <br/>\non PCs, but it&#39;s still amusing.  If you&#39;ve tried it and still don&#39;t dance, it <br/>\nprobably IS gender-related.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has the same result as Screech, but not area effect.  It also fails a lot <br/>\nmore often.  Don&#39;t practice in combat unless you are able to whistle <br/>\ninnocently when your party asks &quot;Why did the MOB start running?&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 30 songs (still), Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJames Schuldes wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: James Schuldes &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Speaking of funny dances -<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; How does one do the instill doubt thing?
