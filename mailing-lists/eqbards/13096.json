I know that the little hamburglars in Misty<br/>\nThicket always have a small round shield, a spear (12plat I think), a silver<br/>\nring, and a squad ring (Not the same as the quest item though).

Every bouncer we killed dropped a standard long<br/>\nsword and round shield.  These are regular store bought items.  Because they<br/>\nare regular store bought items, when you sell them to a merchant, you get<br/>\nmore PP for them than you do FS weapons.
