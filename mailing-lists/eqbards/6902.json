I made up the potential replacement songs off the fly.  I<br/>\nwas hoping some of the more experienced players could come up with better<br/>\nideas.  However, if everyone is fine with keeping the 14th level song as it<br/>\nis then fine by me.  One thing to remember, Verant does modify/replace<br/>\nspells when the situation warrants it.  Look back at the two most recent big<br/>\npatches and see how many existing spells were replaced with different ones.<br/>\nAsking them to replace our 14th level song is not beyond reason.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe discussed a general bard petition last week.  Seems to me the vote was<br/>\nsplit 50/50 if we even needed to worry about it.  Is anyone going to<br/>\nvolunteer to draft one up or is it a dead issue?<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci        <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I agree, this petition is somewhat uncalled for.   we allready have a heal<br/>\n&gt; song and stamina song, dont even think about getting a combined one. Thats<br/>\n&gt; simply pulling teeth.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; lev 34 bard that is tired of petitions which address the wrong things.<br/>\n&gt; If you want to petition about something, petition about thinks like skills<br/>\n&gt; that cap at 40, utterly useless like hide & forage. Our stick drum will<br/>\n&gt; supposedly be fixed in the next graphical patch.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
