It is as simple as that.  If for some reason snare<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t stick... or is more often the case at higher levels it is resisted<br/>\nmany times in a row, then chains is the backup and emergency tool for<br/>\nstopping runners.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, this weekend we did the Efreeti raid...  We almost screwed it<br/>\nall up because one damn imp resisted all of the snare attempts and started<br/>\nrunning.  What saved the day?  Luckily the other bard in the group had<br/>\nchains loaded and stopped the runner cold in its tracks.  Me being a DOLT<br/>\ndidn&#39;t have it up (last time I do that!).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for reliability, chains is resisted far too often, breaks far too easily<br/>\nand lasts not nearly long enough to be used as the primary means of stopping<br/>\nrunners.  As a backup to a good druid or ranger, it is simply awesome<br/>\n(particularly because you can sing it while chasing after the runner).<br/>\nThere is nothing I hate more then having to do runner control for a party.<br/>\nThere are far more important things for a bard to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat about the slow down effect?  Well your level 20 song is as good as<br/>\nchains, has an area effect, doesn&#39;t break root and stacks with the<br/>\nenchanters slow downs.  IMHO this is a much better song for during combat<br/>\nand chains should be loaded for the emergency situations when everything<br/>\nelse fails.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for Lazy vs. non-lazy snarers?  Snare tends to last 2 minutes normally.<br/>\nWe have all our snarers announce when they have got snare to stick.  Every<br/>\nsnarer keeps casting until one of the announces.  99% of the time when<br/>\nsomeone gets snare to stick, it is unnecassary for any further action to<br/>\nprevent a runner and chains is a sufficient backup to the 1% of the time<br/>\nwhen the MOB breaks snare for some unknown god-awful reason.  The biggest<br/>\nproblem with snare is its resist rate, but once it sticks, it usually sticks<br/>\nfor the duration.  If your snarers aren&#39;t repeating snare attempts until<br/>\nthey get one to stick, then your snarers are not doing their job.<br/>\n<br/>\nTaneran Dreamweaver<br/>\n&lt;Clan Jax&gt;<br/>\nBard of the 45th song<br/>\nPrexus<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nDON&#39;T HATE YOUR RATE!<br/>\nGet a NextCard Visa, in 30 seconds!
