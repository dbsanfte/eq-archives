I wanted to stop by and see if Najena was<br/>\ncamped. Being the nutcase that I am, I hit lullaby,<br/>\n(my magic AE door opener.) and find a full spawn.<br/>\nWell, I could fight, or I could die, so I decided to<br/>\nplay. I charm magician #1 and sicc her on Najena,<br/>\nwhile I twist guardian. All the mobs aggro on her<br/>\n(including her own pet) she dies quick. One pulse of<br/>\ncharm and the pet suicides. Charm mage #2, sicc her on<br/>\nNajena too. She dies, of course, and I charm the pet. <br/>\n<br/>\nNajena was tougher. I was going to fear/chain her, but<br/>\nit didn&#39;t work too well. I ended up meleeing her,<br/>\nwhile pixie&#39;ing like mad. She got 2 spells off. <br/>\n<br/>\nAll said and done, I nearly died. I was somewhere<br/>\naround 1 bubble after all this fun, and not willing to<br/>\nchance it again. (Damn froglok ghoul almost killed me<br/>\non the way out.) Any advice on how to do this better<br/>\nnext time?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDouble Entendre<br/>\nBard of 29 &quot;Sorry, no clarity yet&quot;&#39;s<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTalk to your friends online with Yahoo!
