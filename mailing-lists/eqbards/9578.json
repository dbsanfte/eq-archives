Sure it was a<br/>\npain to get them repaired, but it wasn&#39;t anything too bad.  If you did lose<br/>\nan item, it was simply because you never paid any attention to it&#39;s status.<br/>\nIf they did have a &quot;flag&quot; come up when the item in question was nearing it&#39;s<br/>\nbreaking point, I don&#39;t think it would be that much of a problem.  In M59,<br/>\nmost people carried around a spare weapon just in case their primary started<br/>\ngetting in rough shape.  Heck, you might even find yourself actually USING<br/>\none ofthose ubiquitous rusty, bronze, fine steel weapons from time to time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey could handle the &quot;repairs&quot; much like casting a spell on another person,<br/>\nor using bind wounds.  You target the other player, click on &quot;repair&quot;, and<br/>\nthen everything in their inventory is repaired to full status.  In that<br/>\nmanner, the repairer would never actually handle your equipment, thereby<br/>\ncircumventing the whole &quot;trust&quot; factor.  How you would implement the skill<br/>\nis an entirely different matter : is it a general purpose skill that<br/>\neveryone could train, or would it be tied to an already existing skill<br/>\n(smithing, tinkering, etc)?  It would be nice to be able to raise your<br/>\nsmithing skill just from doing repairs...<br/>\n<br/>\nWay off-topic : I amassed a fortune in M59 using the &quot;repair&quot; spell (I<br/>\nbelieve it was called &quot;Mend&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\nDesmei Sightblinder<br/>\nLvl 30 Bard [Povar]<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, November 03, 1999 2:19 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: Re: Undead drops in Kithicor (Re: [eqbards] Digest Number<br/>\n&gt; 482 )<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Wed, 3 Nov 1999, Kimes, Dean W. wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Even if it is possible to repair wear completely many if <br/>\n&gt; not most people<br/>\n&gt; &gt; will not do so.  Their items will deteriorate and will <br/>\n&gt; break.  This is a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; fact of life.  Car engines last immensely longer if you <br/>\n&gt; change the oil every<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 3000 miles religiously and yet I know many people who <br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t.  Just because<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wear can be prevented does not mean it will be, especially <br/>\n&gt; if you have to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; run all the way to a city to get it done.  Some people will <br/>\n&gt; take excellent<br/>\n&gt; &gt; care of their equipment, others will be too lazy or <br/>\n&gt; forgetful to do so and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; will suffer for it.  Unfortunate but true.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Your car does not vanish if you forget to change the oil, just<br/>\n&gt; the cost of future repairs is increased.  And by the time most<br/>\n&gt; car engines start to wear out, most people are looking to buy<br/>\n&gt; a new car anyway.  Once people realize their bladed thulian<br/>\n&gt; claws could vanish on them in a blink of an eye, they will<br/>\n&gt; repair it religiously.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Now, a system where weapon and armor effectiveness started to<br/>\n&gt; degrade with wear and remembered a &quot;repair history&quot; that<br/>\n&gt; affected wear rate, that might be something.  (And hopefully<br/>\n&gt; figure out a way to avoid the way UO did it, where you had to<br/>\n&gt; trust the smith doing the repairs and hand your equipment over<br/>\n&gt; to him.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
