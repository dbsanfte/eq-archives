What<br/>\nguilds are considered the biggest?  Because I play during the servers<br/>\noff-peak hours (Aussie time) I tend to see a lot of guilds with only one or<br/>\ntwo members in them.  But with about 500 players on at the time there&#39;s not<br/>\nmuch to represent :)<br/>\n<br/>\n  I am not asking because I want to be part of a &quot;big&quot; guild but just<br/>\ncurious.  I don&#39;t want to give anyone the wrong impression :)  Besides my<br/>\nlittle one is already questing to join the guild most suited for her - size<br/>\nor not!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Regards,<br/>\n<br/>\n  Jacana - level 7 wood elf bard - If you ever see her around say hello :)<br/>\nShe&#39;s chat with you for hours.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
