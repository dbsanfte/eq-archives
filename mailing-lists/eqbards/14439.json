Anyone else getting these<br/>\nsince the Reduced Bard Hate patch?<br/>\n<br/>\nRan out of lavastorm with 50 health.  Couldn&#39;t even see a pixel on my health<br/>\nbar.  Entered Nek and fired up the Hymn.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo players are killing a DE guard 30 feet from me, on the path.  Guard spins<br/>\naround, runs down the path, across the zone entrance alcove,<br/>\nand cuts my head off.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not grouped.  I&#39;m not anywhere near the guard.  I&#39;ve been in the zone<br/>\nexactly 15 seconds, and I manage to taunt a half dead guard away<br/>\nfrom the 2 guys who are killing it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuck.  If this is reduced, maybe I should be grateful for the 15 seconds I had<br/>\nbefore I was killed.<br/>\n<br/>\nGolias the Dead</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
