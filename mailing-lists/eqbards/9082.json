I remember seeing comments like &quot;with charm, our group had no<br/>\ndowntime&quot;. I can only imagine charming a HG to fight another one for a<br/>\ncouple rounds then the HG will wake up and run toward me and I&#39;ll have to<br/>\ncharm again.... I dont even think this will work since you might get hit<br/>\nbefore second charm or even stunned and stop singing (do you even have time<br/>\nto turnaround sing speed song and pull the distance off?) or get resisted<br/>\nonce then got hit 60dam, 70dam again by TWO HGs. From what i imagine, a<br/>\nbard would die most of the time charming one HG to hit another.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there something I&#39;ve missed?<br/>\n<br/>\nbaby bard - Fenin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
