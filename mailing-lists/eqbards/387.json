I&#39;m finding level 9 to be excruciatingly<br/>\nslow going...  Any pointers?  I spent a huge amount of time tonight with a<br/>\nlarge group at east commons orc camp.  They want me to use the Discord<br/>\nsong - so all the orcs jump me.  I get killed instantly.  The rest proceed<br/>\nto wipe out the rest as I memorize and work my way back.  Before I get<br/>\nthere - they all decide it&#39;s late and log off.  Not a one bothered to wait<br/>\nand offer me a share of silver or loot...  Wasted about an hour and ended up<br/>\nwith LESS XP than I started..<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m under the impression now - I&#39;m better off pairing off with someone at<br/>\nthis point than trying large groups...  Large seem to take forever to do<br/>\nanyting - and I&#39;m not getting much xp or loot..<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde of Xegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
