The second one is the<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Invisibility to Undead&quot; that clerics and paladins can cast.  I was always<br/>\n&gt; under the impression that our invisibility song functioned like the magic<br/>\n&gt; user type Invisibility spell and as a result was no good against undead,<br/>\n&gt; which I assumed had the innate ability to See Invisiblility (otherwise why<br/>\n&gt; have a distinct spell for it).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Dunno why the difference, but it&#39;s always worked against most<br/>\nundead for me.  It doesn&#39;t work against *some* undead.  I<br/>\nbelieve greater skeletons(?) can see through it - even though<br/>\nthey are green and don&#39;t attack me anymore, they always /con<br/>\nready to attack when I have the song up.  But it really really<br/>\ndoes work against most undead I&#39;ve run across (hags, ghouls,<br/>\nvarious types of skeletons, etc), and as of my experience last<br/>\nweek, still does, at least at level 30.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; These leads into another question, John stated that sometimes the hag casts<br/>\n&gt; See Invisibility on the mobs and thats why they still attack you when you<br/>\n&gt; sing the song.  What about other types of mobs?  Do any creatures out there<br/>\n&gt; have the innate ability to See Invisibility or do they have to also cast the<br/>\n&gt; See Invisibility spell?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If a mob is much higher than you, it can usually see through<br/>\ninvisibility.  It seems to depend on the mob though.  Early<br/>\non, most giants could see through it (haven&#39;t tested it<br/>\nlately), but it worked just fine on griffins.  Also, while in<br/>\nGuk, we found that invisibility cast by a L31 enchanter worked<br/>\non the frogs, but invisibility cast by a L19 enchanter didn&#39;t.<br/>\nSo the level of the caster/singer is what matters.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy friends who use invisibility potions (10.5pp at an<br/>\nalchemy/herb shop) say the potions are pretty potent and make<br/>\nthem invisible to lots of things that could see them through<br/>\nother forms of invisibility.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
