Would you pay $10/mo for a license to play D&D<br/>\nor Traveller?  Would you pay $1000 to a GM in one of these<br/>\ngames if he&#39;d let you have a Super-Weapon-of-Critter-Slaying?  <br/>\nBut people are willing to pay more for EQ and UO because<br/>\nthey&#39;re more than a game - they&#39;re your opportunity to run an<br/>\nalternate personality in another world.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately, none of the companies have really addressed the<br/>\nfull implications of this.  You&#39;re not playing a game; you&#39;re<br/>\nrunning around in a virtual world.  To prevent it from<br/>\ndissolving into the anarchy where every guttersnipe can get<br/>\naway with whatever he wants to do, you need a social support<br/>\nstructure - laws, some form of government (a dictatorship by<br/>\nthe GMs would be sufficient for now).  Based on some<br/>\npre-release comments by Verant on how they&#39;d deal with<br/>\ncheaters, I&#39;d hoped that they&#39;d seen the light.  But<br/>\nunfortunately they only seem interested in punishing violation<br/>\nof programming code laws (hacking, bug exploiting), not social<br/>\nlaws.  Oh well, maybe the next game...<br/>\n<br/>\nTo be fair to the people who do these types of things like<br/>\nsteal items or PK, they may still see it as &quot;just a game.&quot;  <br/>\nThe problem is that the people playing the same game have<br/>\ndifferent expectations of the seriousness with which other<br/>\npeople consider their actions.  I see this genre splitting<br/>\ninto more serious virtual worlds and more laid-back &quot;just a<br/>\ngame&quot; type environments.  Sort of like the schism that&#39;s<br/>\ngrowing between the current crop of perpetual online RPGs and<br/>\nmultiplayer shoot-em-ups.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
