Our planes scheduling system works very well (see www.innoruuk.com if you&#39;re interested), and<br/>\nthe larger guilds seem to be cooperating rather nicely on giving each other shots at the big MOBs.  After<br/>\ntaking VS on Thursday post-first-patch, my guild could have camped there to take him again after the next<br/>\npatch, for example, but we knew that Pantheon wanted a shot, so we left (grats on crushing him, btw) and<br/>\ntook Phinny instead  :)  There are a lot of servers where that wouldn&#39;t have happened.  On Innorruuk, we<br/>\nwould have been way out of line to try it.  Yeah, there are times when two guilds show up for the same<br/>\nMOB, and it stinks to be the one that doesn&#39;t get the shot, but for the most part things run pretty darn<br/>\nwell.<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 54 songs, Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJames Schuldes wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Hrm, you guys got him Wed night - grats Jysa on the greaves.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Silent Justice got him Thursday afternoon-ish right before the server went<br/>\n&gt; down.

Ok, well not exactly waiting<br/>\n&gt; lists but lots of folks able to do the &lt; VP &#39;biggies.&#39;  And the damn<br/>\n&gt; scheduling for the planes and the quest loot there is making for some<br/>\n&gt; strange alliance - uber-guilds who never helped others are now begging for<br/>\n&gt; slots in  small guild&#39;s plane runs just for the chance to get quest loots.<br/>\n&gt; Strange days indeed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sylly<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Kenneth E.
