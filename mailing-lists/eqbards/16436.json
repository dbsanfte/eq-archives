We have this<br/>\nproblem of letting DoT&#39;s do their full damage and many of our fights last 2<br/>\nmins.  Heck we had a stupid darkness snare wear off on a goblin last nite<br/>\nand it was ugly.  The necro even admitted he was lazy by just hitting the<br/>\nmob once with the slowdown and then not giving it a second thought that<br/>\nafter 2 minutes it probably wasn&#39;t slowed again.  I am lucky though in that<br/>\nboth the druids and ranger that I group with are snare happy if anything.<br/>\nNo one would accuse them of being snare lazy that&#39;s for sure!

That&#39;s hard work.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;When there&#39;s a good snarer in the group I let them work, but as was<br/>\n&gt;mentioned earlier a lot of them have gotten really lazy.  They cast once at<br/>\n&gt;the beginning and then again when the mob runs.  Hell, just let me chain<br/>\n&gt;them and save the mana.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Okay. You say casting once at the beginning then again when the mob<br/>\nruns makes the druid lazy.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat would make a snarer NOT lazy? (realizing that even Snare takes mana)<br/>\nDo you want them to set a timer and snare every 30 seconds? Every 60<br/>\nseconds?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you expect out of your snarer to not call them lazy?<br/>\n<br/>\nSarah Heacock   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sarah@...\">sarah@...</a><br/>\nFaerain Wanderer, level 20 Soldier of Tunare, Phoenix, Solusek Ro /<br/>\nFaesong, level 15 HalfElf Bard of Solusek Ro, Phoenix, Solusek Ro (Freeport)<br/>\n/<br/>\nMeara, level 14 Enchanter, Master Jeweler, owner Meara&#39;s Boutique of<br/>\nMystiques, Phoenix, Solusek Ro /<br/>\n&lt;lvl 4 paladin&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nPERFORM CPR ON YOUR APR!<br/>\nGet a NextCard Visa, in 30 seconds!
