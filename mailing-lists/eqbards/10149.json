Your DW skill is checked whenever <br/>\nthe delay on your secondary weapon goes off.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;2) I&#39;m currently equipped with a PGT (dmg 6 del 24, berserker str proc wt <br/>\n&gt;6)<br/>\n&gt;and SBS (shield of course will go bye bye), and a Pugius Dagger (dmg 5 del<br/>\n&gt;21 wt 2.?) which I use to hone my piercing skills after the PGT has already<br/>\n&gt;proc&#39;d. [BTW, i realize that proc means cast, but what does it stand for or<br/>\n&gt;mean? =)] So will weilding both of these drain my stamina too quickly you<br/>\n&gt;think?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Actually the Dagger is a good, fast secondary weapon.  The PGT on the other <br/>\nhand is heavy and will drain your stamina in a medium to long battle while <br/>\nDW&#39;ing.  You can devote a song slot to Jaxon&#39;s Jig o&#39; Vigor to replenish <br/>\nstamina in battle or find a lighter primary weapon.  The PGT is a great <br/>\nweapon up till your mid to high 20&#39;s, around 27/28th level you will find <br/>\nmost mobs will blast through it in ont to two rounds leaving you with a <br/>\nmediocore  str buff and a massive agility penalty.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;3) And what are some good hot keys to have set up as I&#39;m just learning the<br/>\n&gt;skill?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No hot keys required.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;4) When you auto attack, do both weapons go auto or must you continue to<br/>\n&gt;click on some key or repeatedly type something?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Both weapons will attack automaticly and independently of each other.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;5) What are some other good relatively inexpensive weapons to use for this?<br/>\n&gt;Some ideas i have are Bladed Thulian Claws, Dragoon Dirk, and a 1h staff<br/>\n&gt;possibly a Staff of Writhing. Those are still a little out of my price <br/>\n&gt;range<br/>\n&gt;though; Dirk is not, but no one seems to ever want to let one go. =P Unless<br/>\n&gt;they just ran across a Runed Bone Fork - in my dreams!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    Well I guess I can wait on some gift from the Gods or help from you<br/>\n&gt;friendly wanderers of Norrath. My ears have turned to you folks (good <br/>\n&gt;choice<br/>\n&gt;eh? lol)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The slower, heavier weapons will be stamina hogs in battle, and going OOS <br/>\n(out of stamina) in a battle is a bad thing, you will take big hits to your <br/>\nattributes.  The light fast weapons will aliviate this problem at the <br/>\nexpense of damage dealt.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;Pava, Bard of measure 16<br/>\n&gt;Silent Dragons<br/>\n&gt;Cazic Thule<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>One final note on DW, is you need to place no skill points in it at all for <br/>\nit to go up.  You get it free at 17th level.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn Swiftsong - Karana server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
