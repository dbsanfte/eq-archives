I assure you<br/>\nthey&#39;re no better than anywhere else - that&#39;s one reason I was so thrilled<br/>\nat getting both gauntlets and arms in one trip.  In fact one of the drops<br/>\nwas from a patroller (pats we call &#39;em), the odds of which are very, very<br/>\nclose to zero.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve made about 14 Hate trips that cleared essentially the whole Plane.  Of<br/>\nthose 14 trips I have seen exactly FOUR pieces of Imbrued drop.  I was<br/>\nfortunate enough in three of the cases to be the recipient of the item.<br/>\nTherefore, I now have Breastplate, Arms and Gauntlets.  I got the BP on my<br/>\nsecond trip about six weeks ago and have seen ZERO pieces drop until this<br/>\nweekend.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou have to have a wide streak of masochist in you to get a full suit of<br/>\nanything but Clerical armor, which everyone seems to agree drops almost<br/>\ntwice as often as anything else.  But when Planes capable players see my<br/>\narmor there is no question in their minds about how difficult it was to get.<br/>\nA lot of people complained pretty loudly that the armor resulting from the<br/>\nLambent (and other) armor quests was not NO DROP and just simply too easy to<br/>\nget.  We see a lot of level 8 bards running around in full Lambent, don&#39;t<br/>\nwe?  You sure as hell don&#39;t see Planes newbies running around in full<br/>\noutfits of anything.  A Druid in my guild that has been going to Fear *since<br/>\nit opened* just got his final piece (breastplate) over the weekend.  He said<br/>\nthat he was almost in tears over having received it finally.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re in their world now.<br/>\n<br/>\n[48 Bard] Crier (Half Elf) &lt;Seekers of Norrath&gt; ZONE: work<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 3 days in Hate this weekend. First night the zone crashed just as we<br/>\n&gt; were cleared to the Maestro. Absolutely no bard stuff dropped. I think<br/>\n&gt; Warrior legs dropped the first night, then no more all weekend. No Mage<br/>\n&gt; stuff dropped, a few shaman pieces. In general, other than cleric stuff,<br/>\n&gt; the drop rate is just pitiful and has a few people who&#39;ve been going for<br/>\n&gt; several months contemplating quitting as there&#39;s just not much point to<br/>\n&gt; playing anymore. Playing for fun isn&#39;t once you&#39;ve done Hate a few<br/>\n&gt; times, as IMO, it&#39;s one of the most boring zones they&#39;ve created. The<br/>\n&gt; fast spawning roamers keep you camped in the same locations for hours<br/>\n&gt; and even if you did move around every place looks pretty well like every<br/>\n&gt; other place.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To top it off, a 6 note blade dropped and all the bards had one, and<br/>\n&gt; Inno dropped a fatty shaman hammer and there were no fatty shaman on the<br/>\n&gt; trip.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And to add to the buggy RNG theory, I foraged 100 vegetables over the<br/>\n&gt; weekend compared to 20-40 of fruit, berries and rabbit meat. What are<br/>\n&gt; the odds of that happening? :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nGET A NEXTCARD VISA, in 30 seconds!
