The bard class is unlike<br/>\nall the others and some people just don&#39;t like doing what it takes to play<br/>\nthe bard (lots and lots of starting and stopping songs via hot keys or<br/>\nsuch.)  But you can pretty easily find out by playing one for a few levels<br/>\nor 10 ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nI would start with 20pp and go buy all leather - fast and easy to get from<br/>\nthe npc merchant.  Then spend another 20-40pp and buy a dragoon dirk (or go<br/>\nkill Dvinn and get a free one.)  Also, go to the nearest rogue guild (if you<br/>\ncan find it) and buy a parrying dagger.  It looks like a dagger when<br/>\nequipped in secondary slot but all it does is add ac like a shield.  Or buy<br/>\na chitin shield - not only do they look nice buy they have some useful<br/>\nresists (poison) for low level mobs you will encounter.  I would buy *a lot*<br/>\nof bandages and some SoW potions too (forget about damage shield potions -<br/>\nthe ds they cast depends on the level of the caster and for low levels they<br/>\nare &#39;not worth it.&#39;)<br/>\n<br/>\nYou should read one of the bard web sites and print a chart of when you get<br/>\nskills.  Buy a hand drum (or MM drum if you wanna spend 500pp) and a<br/>\nmandolin (lighter weight than a lute otherwise the same - do not buy a &quot;Lute<br/>\nof the Gyspy Princess&quot; - it&#39;s a non-used item for a quest that changed long<br/>\nago and has no special power for bards.) Get a mino horn from minos in<br/>\nSteamfont or Beholder and a brass horn from npc merchant.  Drum and lute are<br/>\nwhat you use first - wind (mino or flute) and brass come a bit later on.<br/>\n<br/>\nBanded Armor is just fine if you wanna spend the plat.  Blackened Iron looks<br/>\ncool but weighs a lot. Bronze also weighs a lot for small increase in AC.<br/>\nNot sure where Rygor fits into the current equation - it might be an option<br/>\nbut more expensive.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOnce you discover how you feel about barding (endless clicking of hot keys<br/>\nand frequent looting of your own corpse), you will know whether you want to<br/>\nget a set of Lambent Armor (bard&#39;s class quest armor  - but with the low<br/>\nnumber of bards and frequent drops of Singing Steel armor - you may well be<br/>\nable to get a couple nice Singing Steel pieces very cheaply) which has nice<br/>\nstats for mid level bards or whether you want the address to the Safe House<br/>\nand someone to hold your stuff for a couple minutes.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\nVirtuoso<br/>\n&lt;Mercenary Force&gt;<br/>\nSomewhere on Innoruuk... <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mercenaryforce.com\">http://www.mercenaryforce.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Thomas [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Fuzhead@...\">Fuzhead@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, September 14, 2001 4:46 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Items for a newb?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a level 29 druid and i am gonna buy some stuff for my bard and i was<br/>\nwondering what kind of stuff should i get<br/>\n    I think i was a 1 hs and a peircing weapon but not sure<br/>\n    Also i might buy banded armor<br/>\n    What is a good BP for me to get<br/>\n    And is there any class specific armor that i should buy?<br/>\nThanks for helping me out...<br/>\n            Seoban<br/>\n                 -Vazaelle Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
