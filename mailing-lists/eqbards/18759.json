I use this in<br/>\nmy offhand with claws in my primary and I swear I never stop swinging.  If<br/>\nwe get pulls of more than one, I always unequip it and put an obsidian shard<br/>\nor some other weapon in my secondary.  So it isn&#39;t that bad of a weapon if<br/>\nyou just remember when not to use it.<br/>\n<br/>\nKurik Nitesong<br/>\n39th bard Veeshan<br/>\n&quot;Only the Brave&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n___________________<br/>\nRobert Maze<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:robert@...\">robert@...</a><br/>\nwww.fncinc.com<br/>\n<br/>\n  -----Original Message-----<br/>\n  From: Kimes, Dean W.
