If you get 3-4 high blue mobs attacking<br/>\nyou at once, either the enchanter mesmerizes them, or you<br/>\nStrike or Lullaby them.  If your group can&#39;t do this, you<br/>\nmight as well zone or evac because it&#39;s usually a lost cause.  <br/>\nOnce the mobs are mesmerized/lullabyed, it&#39;s a group-on-one<br/>\nfight so you don&#39;t want to be playing area effect songs like<br/>\nDDD and CoD since those will just wake the mobs up.<br/>\n<br/>\nI doubt the damage *I* do with my instruments will ever<br/>\nsignificantly surpass the damage I do with weapons.  However,<br/>\nmy feeling is that using only instruments, I can often make my<br/>\n*group* much more effective than if I were in there with my<br/>\nweapons.  I&#39;ll have to reappraise this when I get Celerity<br/>\n(which is singing), and Beserker&#39;s (horn - doesn&#39;t really<br/>\nbenefit from playing instruemnt songs unless you&#39;re willing to<br/>\nswap instruments as you fight).  The Psalm songs are also<br/>\nsinging, so you can partially substitute these for the Rhythm<br/>\nseries while still using your weapons.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess to summarize, the higher level songs seem geared more<br/>\ntowards singing, to allow your songs to be fully effective<br/>\nwithout having to give up your weapons.  Overall though, the<br/>\nbalance seems to be pretty close, and I find myself switching<br/>\nbetween instruments and weapons on a per-fight basis depending<br/>\non what we&#39;re fighting, and what the make-up of the group is.  <br/>\nI think Verant intended this by design.  Being a jack of all<br/>\ntrades means you can fill in for just about any job.  If the<br/>\ngroup needs more tanking, you can jump in there with your<br/>\nweapons.  If the group needs more magical support, you can<br/>\nstand back and play your instruments.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
