Without getting into a tactics discussion, if you are<br/>\nonly playing 1 song during the actual dragon battle then you aren&#39;t<br/>\nworth the spot you are filling, and a warrior would be much better<br/>\nserved in it. On every dragon raid or large scale fight, you want to<br/>\nshow your group just how valuable a bard is, like when people from other<br/>\ngroups die from attrition, but your resist buffs keep your party going<br/>\nuntil the very end.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen you have to remember that maybe other bards just bellow and play<br/>\nmana regen. Now, when it comes to the hard fight, who will get the<br/>\ninvite? You, because you know what you are doing and people like to win.<br/>\nThe best example I can think of is Dracoliche in PoF. A bard will<br/>\ncompletely neutralize Draco&#39;s AE weapons if they know their trade.<br/>\nWhat&#39;s really funny is seeing how many bards need to be told what to<br/>\nplay, because they don&#39;t know on their own. Song selection is an<br/>\nextremely important part of our class. Knowing when to play what and<br/>\nconstantly experimenting, observing, and trying out new tactics are what<br/>\nreally set people apart (and this list helps alot with that creative<br/>\nprocess). The spell interrupt with Lullaby I noticed watching a L8 Bard<br/>\nat the West Commons Orc Camp. What&#39;s scary is just how effective that<br/>\ntrick is - Lullaby is always memm&#39;d when I may have to solo a<br/>\ncleric-class monster. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAriell Thunderwolf, Karana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
