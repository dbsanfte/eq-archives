If you start Accel, start your stopwatch the<br/>\nmoment the boot icon appears and immediately stop Accel, and<br/>\nstop the stopwatch when the icon disappears, you&#39;ll get times<br/>\nbetween 12 and 18 seconds.  I think what&#39;s going on is that<br/>\nyour song can start at any time, but when you stop it, the<br/>\nserver keeps the effect going for two more heartbeats (hence<br/>\n&quot;3 ticks&quot; - the first when you start the song, then two more<br/>\nafter you&#39;ve stopped it).  These heartbeats are independent of<br/>\nyour song start/stop times.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo worst case you start and stop your song (1st tick), the 2nd<br/>\ntick comes an instant after, 6 seconds later the 3rd tick<br/>\ncomes, and 6 seconds later on the 4th tick there&#39;s a command<br/>\nfrom the server to stop the effect.  Total of just over 12<br/>\nseconds.  Best case you start and stop your song (1st tick),<br/>\n5.9 seconds later the 2nd tick comes, 6 seconds later the 3rd<br/>\ntick comes, and 6 seconds later on the 4th tick there&#39;s a<br/>\ncommand from the server to stop the song effect.  Total of<br/>\njust under 18 seconds.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also suspect a lot of things don&#39;t happen at 6 second<br/>\nintervals but just seem that way because that&#39;s when the info<br/>\nis sent to the client.  JM mentioned our DoTs really pulse at<br/>\n2.5 second intervals and last for 4 pulses (10 sec total).  <br/>\nI&#39;m beginning to suspect he was right because sometimes DDD<br/>\nwill seems to pulse 3 times, sometimes it seems to pulse<br/>\ntwice.  It&#39;s tough to know for sure though.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Also, I would like to know which songs &quot;stack&quot; with each other.  Beyond<br/>\n&gt; chant and anthem dont stack. Chant and purifying/elemental dont stack.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m including stacking info (along with taunt effect,<br/>\ninstrument enhancement, and strategies) in my guide.  Rokken<br/>\nand I are collaborating as well, so hopefully we&#39;ll get one<br/>\nnice meta-guide out some time soon.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; analysis matrix - what spells are not compatible with various songs and vice<br/>\n&gt; versa.

I hear Accel speed<br/>\nwas nerfed lately too (haven&#39;t had a chance to play in almost<br/>\na week).  I haven&#39;t been playing much lately due to crippling<br/>\n10%-30% PL and 290 ms ping times, so I should have plenty of<br/>\ntime to work on this.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
