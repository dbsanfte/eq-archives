Hurrah!<br/>\n Of course I have no sense and the very next morning I went on a Vox raid and she<br/>\nkindly took it from me.  Twice.  Ouch.  Ah well, it would have been worth it but<br/>\nalas no horn =(.  Still, the Seafury Cyclops eventually yielded the re-ding.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, I used the knowledge I gained here about good strategies for Nagafen and<br/>\nVox to prepare my song list.  Nagafen was last week, and yes he thought bard tasted<br/>\nreally good too.  Lost the drum lotto on that one *pout*.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have 46 to get through before I attempt the Planes - I want that margin! - but<br/>\nthat will be soon I hope.  I have read a few posts on the topic of Plane strategies,<br/>\nbut am eager for more.  Help me out please?<br/>\n<br/>\nMaravana Vireo of the Jus Divinum<br/>\nLevel 46 bard of Mithaniel Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTalk to your friends online with Yahoo!
