It breaks early maybe once a night.  Very rare event.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne problem I have with charm is the &quot;This mob is too high level to be<br/>\ncharmed&quot;  Or whatever message you used to get no longer is given.  You<br/>\nmerely get resisted 100% of the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other problem is that about 5% of my charms seem to fall into that:<br/>\nSong End/Song Pulse/Song End trap that they &quot;cannot pin down&quot;  This is<br/>\npaticularly nasty with charm since you can&#39;t recharm till the non charm<br/>\nexpires (not to mention wastes mana)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
