Every player&#39;s account has a value of some sorts.  For<br/>\nme, the value of my account is based on the amount of time I have put into<br/>\nit developing my characters.  Because I have devoted massive amounts of my<br/>\npersonal time playing EQ, I have raised my character in levels, have the<br/>\nability to acquire items due to my level, can group with my friends who I<br/>\nhave made.  Because I have devoted so much time playing EQ, my account is<br/>\ntremendously valuable to me.  This value has absolutely nothing to do with<br/>\nthe value of my account if I want to sell it to someone or selling items on<br/>\nEbay.  Its value is strictly personal.  The account of the person who wrote<br/>\nthe story is probably valuable to them in the same way.  If that person did<br/>\nnot violate the EULA, then Verant unlawfully took something away from them<br/>\nthat possessed a value of some sort without fair compensation.  I have no<br/>\nidea what the legal implications of this are.  Will be interesting to see<br/>\nhow it plays out.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mike.langlois@...\">mike.langlois@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mike.langlois@...\">mike.langlois@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, October 05, 2000 10:27 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] OT: A Warning...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nActually, Free Speech says that the government cannot prevent you from<br/>\nspeaking.
