It&#39;s bad.<br/>\n<br/>\nUs bards have to press buttons every 5 secs to change songs and now we&#39;ll <br/>\nhave to continue to be chained to our desks during downtime.<br/>\n<br/>\nAuto-logoff would be really bad, btw. Have you ever been in a room that has <br/>\na motion sensor light? If you sit at your desk and you&#39;re reading, you have <br/>\nto wave your hand in the air every 15 min or end up in the dark.<br/>\n<br/>\nAuto-logoff is the same thing. You may be sitting reading stuff on your <br/>\nscreen, not necessarily pushing any buttons for 10 mins, but get booted off <br/>\njust because the server thinks you&#39;re inactive. You&#39;d have to make sure you <br/>\npush a button every 10 mins or be booted. After you&#39;re booted, you&#39;d lose <br/>\nall of your no-rent items as well as any illusions you had up. I don&#39;t <br/>\nthink Verant would even implement such a bad thing. Uhh, maybe not. Don&#39;t <br/>\npost the auto-logoff thing on the web Kit.
