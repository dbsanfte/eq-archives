Enchanters have a complete lock on crowd<br/>\ncontrol at the moment, and at high levels, no one will even consider<br/>\ngoing many places without an enchanter in the group because you just<br/>\ncan&#39;t pull less than 4+ mobs to break the area. And guess what, there&#39;s<br/>\nnot enough enchanters to go around, never has been and probably never<br/>\nwill be. Every other class has other classes that can fill in doing the<br/>\nsame job, if not quite as well, as their class, but lullaby isn&#39;t a weak<br/>\nentrance, the secondary resists make it a useless one. Why do enchanters<br/>\nget exclusive rights to one function? By your logic, enchanters should<br/>\nhave never been given clarity, which was once only available from bards<br/>\nwith their song, as it would devalue bards and there would be no need<br/>\nfor them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Tue, Jun 27/00, Mike Merck &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mmerck@...\">mmerck@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; I think the reason lullaby will never work to the degree we all want it too<br/>\n&gt; is simple - it would devalue the enchanter class to such a huge degree there<br/>\n&gt; would hardly be a need for them. It would be so hugely unbalancing that VI<br/>\n&gt; will never make it work the way it seems it should.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; An AoE mez that doesn&#39;t require mana, doesn&#39;t require targeting, allows you<br/>\n&gt; to melee as well and crowd control with no effort, risk or thought other<br/>\n&gt; than hitting a single hotkey is just too powerful.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s the same reason they nerfed 54 chains.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Maybe what people should do is offer suggestions about how to balance the<br/>\n&gt; song in a different way other than having it not work 90% of the time. Like,<br/>\n&gt; make it cost mana for each pulse or make it effect the bard as well as the<br/>\n&gt; mobs, or make it a single pulse song instead of a constant one.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; After looking over the Lullaby data again while posting a huge sledgehammer<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of a question hit me over the head.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Why does Lullaby have a secondary resist???<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Shop online together.
