I don&#39;t think so but I haven&#39;t tried any<br/>\nquantative tests. It is definately faster even standing though. Standing<br/>\nwith clarity and the bard song playing my mana bar definately goes up a<br/>\nlot faster than without either. I can run the entire distance across W<br/>\nKarana (with SoW) with neither and not notice any movement in my mana<br/>\nbar, yet one time standing up in the Froglok King room summoning food I<br/>\ngained a half a bubble of mana in the time it took me to summon 5 food.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, dispite what GZ said about pixie strike not being broken, it looks<br/>\nlike they may have changed it recently. Our guild bard wanted to duel my<br/>\ndruid while we were standing around last week after the patch and he<br/>\nbasically locked me up with pixie strike. I wasn&#39;t able to move once if<br/>\nI got the message and icon.
