I&#39;ve never done this before.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Saturday we had 3 6-man groups duel.  Guessing my way through this - I<br/>\n&gt; twisted Elemental and Guardian - to keep our team from getting Nukes etc<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; land on us - and Selos - running around in circles to prevent the tanks<br/>\nfrom<br/>\n&gt; landing blows on me.  This was VERY successful.  A ranger gave up trying<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; chase me and peppered me with arrows - but it didn&#39;t really do all that<br/>\nmuch<br/>\n&gt; damage.  I would also run into a fracas where there were pets pounding on<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; teammate of mine and would fire off screech.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This got our group to be in a very good shape for the end-game - but then<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; wasn&#39;t in a good spot for that - as there wasn&#39;t much casting going on.  A<br/>\n&gt; Necro was hiding in bones form in a firepot medding while her pet was<br/>\n&gt; fighting someone.  I decided to try to go after the necro and tank her -<br/>\nbut<br/>\n&gt; she was good at fearing me - and while I tried to screech her pet - I got<br/>\n&gt; some resists.  Her pet ultimately killed me - with a remaining tank (from<br/>\n&gt; the other team helping out).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anywho, I&#39;m curious of advice from other Bards who may be more experienced<br/>\n&gt; at this as far as good tactics for duels.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Slyde Katzenjammer<br/>\n&gt; 54 Bard<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
