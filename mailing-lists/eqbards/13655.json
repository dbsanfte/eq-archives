I<br/>\noccassionally get to group with a really bright Hong Kong player who is a<br/>\nhigh level wizard.  He plays his wiz in almost a clerical fashion and it<br/>\nworks quite well.  The puller brings a mob and the wiz is medding.  The<br/>\ntanks begin to beat on the mob.  When the mob gets sufficiently aggrod on<br/>\nthe tanks the Wiz stands and casts a nuke *bam* then sits his ass back down<br/>\nand meds.  After a few seconds if the tanks are having problems he&#39;ll stand<br/>\nup again *bam* and sit back down.  When mob flees he stands up *bam*, dead.<br/>\nHe never gets touched, he&#39;s medding the majority of the time and he stops<br/>\nthe runners.  I make it a point to group with the guy when I see he&#39;s in my<br/>\nzone.<br/>\n<br/>\n[44 Bard] Crier (Half Elf) &lt;Seekers of Norrath&gt; ZONE: work<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip about snaring/rooting&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; If you have a good nuker, you don&#39;t even need that - a wizard<br/>\n&gt; can drop them dead before they start to run.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also, if you&#39;re working without a snarer, the first priority<br/>\n&gt; for me would be to find an area you can pull to and still have<br/>\n&gt; a reasonable amount of time to kill a mob when it runs.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Besides, druids and rangers comprise probably half the<br/>\n&gt; characters in the game.  :)  The only people I really feel for<br/>\n&gt; are warriors, rogues, and monks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
