For the lambent vambraces one of the things you<br/>\nneed is fiery vambraces from a solusek champion.  I know there is a kobold<br/>\nchampion in Solusek B, but this seems like a pretty hard kill to aquire this<br/>\nitem (in comparison to the other pieces).  Not having spent much time in<br/>\nSolusek A, I was wondering if there&#39;s a goblin champion there that this<br/>\nmight be referring to instead?  Anyone know much about Sol A that has an<br/>\nanswer?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nElwyn Heartstring<br/>\nLevel 47 Bard<br/>\nErollisi Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
