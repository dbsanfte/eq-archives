Now that I&#39;m level<br/>\n32, I&#39;ve on a couple of occasions managed to get<br/>\nin pretty decent groups in Mistmoore.  Is there<br/>\nany practical way to pull musicians from the<br/>\ncastle once you have control of, say, the plateau<br/>\nin front of the castle?  This is with a mid-30&#39;s<br/>\ngroup.  I have been in a group once that actually<br/>\nmanaged to fight their way into the lobby (with<br/>\nthe stairs going to second floor, etc.) but then<br/>\nwe couldn&#39;t figure out how to reasonably go much<br/>\nfurther due to large clusters of mobs at such odd<br/>\nangles that lament wasn&#39;t really doable, etc.<br/>\nPlus the fact that everyone was scared out of<br/>\ntheir minds because of the stories of bad pathing,<br/>\ntrains, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nLaluni Songhammer of E&#39;Ci, Level 32 bard still<br/>\ntrying to get her breastplate.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nSteven S.
