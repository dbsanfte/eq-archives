The Anti-Magic Aura strips the first buff in the list.  The<br/>\nDisenchanting Melody strips buffs at random from all party members.  I don&#39;t know whether different buffs<br/>\nhave different counters, or whether resists play a part, but the Melody doesn&#39;t always strip a buff on<br/>\nevery pulse.<br/>\n<br/>\nI use the Melody to strip party members of buffs prior to Dragon buffing.  It saves the Clerics a lot of<br/>\nwork and some mana.<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 55 songs, Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWindleaf Mistsong wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; With Alenia&#39;s Disenchanting Melody, yes, we&#39;ve been able to remove buffs on<br/>\n&gt; ourselves. I don&#39;t think it removes all buffs, but I do know it strips<br/>\n&gt; cleric and druid buffs as well as some DOT&#39;s. Be careful too, since<br/>\n&gt; Alenia&#39;s affects the whole group, that you don&#39;t wipe everyone&#39;s buffs off.<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t use this song all that often, if anything, I usually want<br/>\n&gt; Syvelian&#39;s Anti-Magic Aura to debuff a mob. But after a while I forget<br/>\n&gt; which one is which. You&#39;d think I&#39;d have it down by now since Alenia&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; requires a string instrument.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ---Windleaf </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
