Take off a piece of armor with 10 AC and no agi bonuses and you might like 20+ AC.  So if I reduces your &quot;raw&quot; AC by 16, that could be a large &quot;calculated&quot; AC decrease.  Again, I have no idea if this is how this works.<br/>\n<br/>\nUeni, 54 Rogue Tunare<br/>\nLlaenie, 23 Bard Tunare<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Jeffrey Sue <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, February 06, 2001 5:24 PM<br/>\n  Subject: RE: [eqbards] Largos Absonant Binding (lvl 51)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  At 11:52 AM 2/6/01 -1000, you wrote:<br/>\n  &gt;So is it safe to assume that when you hit a mob with the 51 song, their<br/>\n  &gt;agility is also lowered less than 75 and as a result the total AC debuff<br/>\n  &gt;from this song is close to 60+?<br/>\n<br/>\n  yep, this would probably be the case.  oh, assuming of course that their<br/>\n  starting agility is the same as your starting agility.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt;Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
