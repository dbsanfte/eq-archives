The level of the mobs throughout the<br/>\ndungeon would have to be close enough that the party got EXP for mobs both<br/>\nat the beginning and at the end.  There would also have to be a mechanism to<br/>\nprevent a party from camping the boss mob over and over again. Lot more<br/>\nother factors but these are the key ones.  Most likely in the &quot;to hard to<br/>\ndo&quot; category for EQ.  Maybe not for EQ2.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; The dungeon crawl vision is antithical to camping.  If you try<br/>\n&gt; to make both coexist, either the dungeon crawlers get way too<br/>\n&gt; little &quot;prize&quot; loot, or the campers get way too much.  <br/>\n&gt; Duplicating zones would ease overcrowding, but it wouldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; change the campquest state of the game.  Even if you<br/>\n&gt; duplicated each zone so many times that each party were<br/>\n&gt; practically alone in their own dungeon, the crawl party would<br/>\n&gt; only see maybe one special mob per night while the camp party<br/>\n&gt; would see multiple.  Too little or too much.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
