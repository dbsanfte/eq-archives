Just drop invis, Lament the cast,<br/>\nthen stroll past it.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo need to clear trash, and you can get to the good spawns at full<br/>\nhealth/mana  =)<br/>\n<br/>\nMadagan Songweaver, Bard of 35 Songs - Veeshan<br/>\n<br/>\nPs, been residing in Kedge the last few days, exp is great there and it&#39;s<br/>\ngood fun. Anyone know what kind of good stuff drops there? Our group have<br/>\nbeen as low as the 2nd level and it&#39;s damn scary. We killed a Cauldron<br/>\nshark and then a Hammerhead shark spawned in it&#39;s place, it was red a level<br/>\n38 so I am wondering if it&#39;s a named mob that drops something good.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nLament worked fine, pathing is goofy there. If you<br/>\nlament the 4 static lizzies near the temple steps (2<br/>\nsilver guards, 2 prot/sent/fan/heralds) and pull one<br/>\nby the door, it will path right over the lizard<br/>\nopposite of it. Without lament, you&#39;d get all 4. I<br/>\nusually pulled for my party, from the temple into the<br/>\n&quot;fishbowl&quot; as we called it. (You called it the arena).<br/>\nWe were lvl 25-29 at the time, and a roamer could hurt<br/>\nus bad. We would get 2 lizzies at a time, sometimes 3,<br/>\nstill easily managable. Lament was great for us, and<br/>\nit works everywhere in Cazic.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDouble Entendre<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________________________<br/>\nThe information contained in this message may be CONFIDENTIAL and is<br/>\nintended for the addressee only.
