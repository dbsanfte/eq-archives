Basically, while he&#39;s there hacking his way through creature<br/>\nafter creature, I&#39;m helping while nibbling at its back, tickling it,<br/>\nmaking it giggle and distracting it so he can hit it better.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love being in the thick of it all, tearing through the bad things.<br/>\nI had a great time with a fellow bard once in Rathe Mountains, working<br/>\nour way through a big skeleton camp trying to help his cleric friend<br/>\nget her quest bit of whatever.  Clearing out the small undead we were<br/>\nunstoppable, although just as I was getting into my stride he had to<br/>\nsit down and recover his breath.  Typical man!!  (/em ducks)<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, being honest with myself, I&#39;ve got no real desire to be standing<br/>\nin my friend&#39;s shoes having new holes ripped in my shiny armour, but<br/>\nI&#39;d like to be able to add a bit more offensive capability.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I&#39;m asking for a couple of hints and tips on weapon choice ... I<br/>\nthink.  That&#39;s probably where I&#39;m lacking.  At the mo, I&#39;ve got 3<br/>\nbasic weapons I use:<br/>\n<br/>\n= Bladed Thulian claws (something new I&#39;m enjoying playing with after<br/>\ntrading for the PGT I stopped using when it became too heavy!)<br/>\n<br/>\n= Silvery War Axe (off-hand since the rotten claws are main only!)<br/>\n<br/>\n= Dragoon Dirk (to work up my piercing skill when I level, and to sit<br/>\nin my ranged slot when I&#39;ve done that)<br/>\n<br/>\nNow they&#39;re all fast weapons and very light so I can fight all day<br/>\nwith barely a pause.  But also low damage, a 12 here, a 16 there, and<br/>\nthat&#39;s it.  So maybe I should be looking to improve on them, to give<br/>\nme a feeling I&#39;m doing more than nibbling.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I&#39;m hoping to hear from everyone else what weapons you are using,<br/>\nand how you feel they compare to what I&#39;ve got and to what other<br/>\nsupposed (phooey!) hybrids are doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully there&#39;ll be something within my price range (which is<br/>\nactually very low at the mo after buying the stones to get the new<br/>\narmour!!!)<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, a special hi and thanks to Maravana for her kind and generous<br/>\ngift helping me complete my set of Lambent.  Thanks sis, just have to<br/>\ncall and me or one of my other personalities would be glad to help any<br/>\nway I can!<br/>\n<br/>\nPS I was joking about the song being bad, it&#39;s depressingly catchy ;-(<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMelaniel, Wood Elf Bard (31)<br/>\nJilanna, Barbarian Shaman (13)<br/>\nHigh Elf Wizard (30 retired)<br/>\n... and a host of others<br/>\nMith Marr server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
