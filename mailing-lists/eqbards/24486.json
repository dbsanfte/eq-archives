I&#39;ve never done this before.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSaturday we had 3 6-man groups duel.  Guessing my way through this - I<br/>\ntwisted Elemental and Guardian - to keep our team from getting Nukes etc to<br/>\nland on us - and Selos - running around in circles to prevent the tanks from<br/>\nlanding blows on me.  This was VERY successful.  A ranger gave up trying to<br/>\nchase me and peppered me with arrows - but it didn&#39;t really do all that much<br/>\ndamage.  I would also run into a fracas where there were pets pounding on a<br/>\nteammate of mine and would fire off screech.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThis got our group to be in a very good shape for the end-game - but then I<br/>\nwasn&#39;t in a good spot for that - as there wasn&#39;t much casting going on.  A<br/>\nNecro was hiding in bones form in a firepot medding while her pet was<br/>\nfighting someone.  I decided to try to go after the necro and tank her - but<br/>\nshe was good at fearing me - and while I tried to screech her pet - I got<br/>\nsome resists.  Her pet ultimately killed me - with a remaining tank (from<br/>\nthe other team helping out).<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnywho, I&#39;m curious of advice from other Bards who may be more experienced<br/>\nat this as far as good tactics for duels.<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde Katzenjammer<br/>\n54 Bard</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
