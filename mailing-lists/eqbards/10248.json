A root effect is probably a different effect than a movement<br/>\nreducing effect.  Note how rooted creatures behave differently than snared creatures (they always try to<br/>\nrun, rather than fight).<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, songs could override spells all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know, it&#39;s just conjecture.<br/>\n<br/>\nAccording to the EQSS spells database, which is the actual spell data file parsed out:<br/>\n<br/>\nSnare:  Mobility -40 - (level * 1.0)   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.darkflame.org/data.pl?mode=EQSS&uline=ON&snum=242\">http://www.darkflame.org/data.pl?mode=EQSS&uline=ON&snum=242</a><br/>\n<br/>\nChains: Mobility -30<br/>\n            Attack Speed 95<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.darkflame.org/data.pl?mode=EQSS&uline=ON&snum=738\">http://www.darkflame.org/data.pl?mode=EQSS&uline=ON&snum=738</a><br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps chains overrides snare because of the attack speed modification.<br/>\n<br/>\nNote that Root:  Mobility -10000<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.darkflame.org/data.pl?mode=EQSS&uline=ON&snum=230\">http://www.darkflame.org/data.pl?mode=EQSS&uline=ON&snum=230</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSame parameter as the others.
