You may get attacked by 10 things but you&#39;ll outrun them<br/>\nall. There is no getting lost. From East Karana just stay right, from<br/>\nRunnyeye just stay left. Once in Runnyeye, from Beholder stay left, from<br/>\nMisty Thicket, stay right. Nothing could be easier. I get bound to<br/>\nRivervale and go hunt in Paw, simply because Beholder simply is no threat<br/>\nto our class.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo watch out for the rare Evil Eye . . . he might have time to charm you.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Musil <br/>\n<br/>\nAt 08:53 AM 5/13/99 , you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Bob Stewart &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bstewart@...\">bstewart@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;At 08:45 AM 5/13/99 -0700, jay schultze wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;I used to run back and forth from Freeport to Qeynos all the time (for many <br/>\n&gt;&gt;different reasons)...sometimes I&#39;d go to Qeynos and return to Freeport the <br/>\n&gt;&gt;same day.
