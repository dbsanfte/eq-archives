There is a<br/>\n8)bug, or Verant<br/>\n8)calls it FEATURE, that let MOBS hit you from anywhere while you are<br/>\n8)levitating.  Actually for us is better since we can stop the<br/>\n8)song and land<br/>\n8)anytime we want.  But for the other classes, they have to<br/>\n8)wait until the<br/>\n8)spell wears out.  Druid friends also told me not to use it<br/>\n8)over water, since<br/>\n8)shark can hit you from anywhere and there is no way to fight<br/>\n8)back when you<br/>\n8)are above water.  I guess it is only for the spell not the<br/>\n8)song, we could<br/>\n8)always drop down into water anytime we want.<br/>\n8)<br/>\n8)&gt;<br/>\n8)&gt;Well, I finally got out of the first level of hell, and was<br/>\n8)able to try the<br/>\n8)&gt;song I had prebought two weeks prior to hitting 31,<br/>\n8)Agilmente&#39;s Aria of<br/>\n8)&gt;Eagles.  Boy was it nice.  Not only did it levitate me, but<br/>\n8)when it pulses<br/>\n8)&gt;it actually raises you up a bit, so when it pulses during<br/>\n8)the highest point<br/>\n8)&gt;of the wavey motion, it actually lifts you higher.  I took it through<br/>\n8)&gt;Dagnor&#39;s Cauldron, soaring past the aqua goblin camp, and<br/>\n8)paying no heed to<br/>\n8)&gt;the steep cliffs.  I entered Unrest and floated around in<br/>\n8)the outside a<br/>\n8)&gt;bit.<br/>\n8)&gt;I perched atop the small island to the right next to the gazebo, and<br/>\n8)&gt;attempted to fly over to the door&#39;s canopy.  I didn&#39;t quite<br/>\n8)make it, and no<br/>\n8)&gt;sooner was I simultaneously attacked by a Greater Dark Bone,<br/>\n8)a Tentacle<br/>\n8)&gt;Terror, and a Dark Terror from the depths of the basement.<br/>\n8)These were no<br/>\n8)&gt;where to be seen, but my text box was spammed with red.  My<br/>\n8)health quickly<br/>\n8)&gt;dropped, and despite my efforts to flee, my pursuers were<br/>\n8)always right on<br/>\n8)&gt;my<br/>\n8)&gt;tail.  I eventually fell to their blows and received a birds<br/>\n8)eye view of my<br/>\n8)&gt;corpse while I loaded to my home point.  Rather than being in the<br/>\n8)&gt;courtyard,<br/>\n8)&gt;as I was when I died, my corpse was in a cavernous very<br/>\n8)basement like area.<br/>\n8)&gt;Seems as I was floating serenely around unrest I was really floating<br/>\n8)&gt;noisily<br/>\n8)&gt;down in the basement and disturbing the peace of some very<br/>\n8)nasty creatures<br/>\n8)&gt;that dwell therein.  Three hours later, after delving fully<br/>\n8)invis into the<br/>\n8)&gt;basement scouring it&#39;s entirety for my corpse, locating it<br/>\n8)through a wall,<br/>\n8)&gt;and dealing with a very uncooperative guide (who said it was VERY<br/>\n8)&gt;retreivable and levitation worked just fine) it was summoned<br/>\n8)to me, and I<br/>\n8)&gt;went about my merry way.  The point of this story is to ask<br/>\n8)at any attempts<br/>\n8)&gt;at an explanation as to why this happened, and how I can safely use<br/>\n8)&gt;levitation.  It really is a blast as I thought it would be,<br/>\n8)but who knows<br/>\n8)&gt;what mischeif and trouble I could get myself into in other<br/>\n8)multi level<br/>\n8)&gt;dungeons.  So, sorry for rambling, but has anyone else<br/>\n8)experienced this,<br/>\n8)&gt;and<br/>\n8)&gt;does anyone want to venture an explanation?<br/>\n8)&gt;<br/>\n8)&gt;Ka`Lend<br/>\n8)&gt;<br/>\n8)&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n8)----------------------------<br/>\n8)&gt;<br/>\n8)&gt;ONElist:  the best source for group communications.<br/>\n8)&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n8)&gt;Join a new list today!<br/>\n8)&gt;<br/>\n8)&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n8)-----------<br/>\n8)<br/>\n8)<br/>\n8)--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n8)----------------------------<br/>\n8)<br/>\n8)Having difficulty getting &quot;in synch&quot; with list members?<br/>\n8)<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n8)Try ONElist&#39;s Shared Calendar to organize events, meetings and more!<br/>\n8)<br/>\n8)--------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n8)----------<br/>\n8)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
