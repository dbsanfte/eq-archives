Just this week, I was bored and decided to try <br/>\nto figure out how to use the lockpicks I had bought when I got the <br/>\nlockpicking skill.   I just happened to be in West Commons, so I headed on <br/>\nover to Befallen.  I finally discovered that you can pick ALL the Befallen <br/>\nlocks by holding the lockpick on your cursor and left-clicking on the door.  <br/>\nI opened each door several times, never got a failure, but never got a skill <br/>\nraise either.  I don&#39;t remember if I had trained several points into the <br/>\nskill or not (I may have; I had a lot of training points to waste)<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout the Hole entrance rock thing;  I went along on a Hole raid around <br/>\nlevel 40 (yeah, a little young, but you know how those caster&#39;s want their <br/>\ncrack song... hehe).  Apparently you might not even need the locked rock <br/>\npicked as there is some space around it you may be able to swim through (of <br/>\ncourse SOMEONE has to let the big races in).<br/>\n<br/>\nInteresting thing about the raid was that they brought along a few level 1-3 <br/>\nrogues along to sneak/hide their way around for corpse recovery...  Worked <br/>\nreally well too!  =8^)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich brings up another question of mine...  It seemed that those level 1-3 <br/>\nrogues worked wonders with Sneak/Hide.  Now, being level 1-3 they&#39;re <br/>\nsneak/hide skills can&#39;t be all that high (unless like Iksars that are born <br/>\nwith Swimming skill of 100).  Now, how well does bard sneak/hide work <br/>\ncompared with level 3 rogues?  Is there some technique to using sneak/hide?  <br/>\nI tried sneaking behind something in Kaesora the other day and the mob <br/>\nimmediately aggroed on me.<br/>\n<br/>\nOlgwinn Pendragun<br/>\nBard of 45 Missed Notes<br/>\nE&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;    Date: Thu, 14 Sep 2000 22:01:05 -0500<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Bill Mann&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dabard@...\">dabard@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: Lock picking the Hole<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hmmm...
