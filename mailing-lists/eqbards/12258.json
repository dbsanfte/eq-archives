I&#39;m sure the cleric was feeling frustrated to, but I&#39;m not<br/>\nreal thrilled with how he logged before you&#39;d recovered your corpse<br/>\n(which you didn&#39;t, dying in the attempt). I find a situation like you<br/>\ndescribe the best way to find out what type of personality people have<br/>\nfor grouping. Regardless of what his excuse was, he took the mantle of<br/>\nleadership on, so the group was his responsibility.<br/>\n<br/>\nA guy that is going to disband you out of the zone because he can&#39;t deal<br/>\nwith his frustration is going to do the same thing again. Maybe he will<br/>\ngate out on a party fighting (I&#39;ve seen this one alot, I always loved<br/>\nwatching the excuses fly when we still managed to all survive the battle<br/>\nand it was the cleric that gated) or just be the guy that loots the rare<br/>\ndrop (like Dwarven Workboots) and either says &quot;ring&quot; or just gates out<br/>\nwith the goods. Either way, your group knew it may be a tough fight when<br/>\nyou attempted it, so he knew the risks. I&#39;m sorry to hear you racked up<br/>\n2 deaths, but you learned some very valuable information about potential<br/>\ngroupmates. I guarantee you aren&#39;t the only one to have problems with<br/>\nhim based on his behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, in Unrest the bard invis song works against both Undead and living<br/>\nmonsters, so whether it be werebat, fastering hag, or dark terror it can<br/>\nkeep you safe. The only issue is, that song will &quot;blink&quot;, so if your<br/>\nwind instrument skill isn&#39;t maxed, and depending on your level, it may<br/>\nbe quite a gamble.<br/>\n<br/>\nAriell Thunderwolf, Karana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
