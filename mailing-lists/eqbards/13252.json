I soloed my Enchantress to level 12 in less than 2 <br/>\ndays played by attacking whites and yellows, backing up to let the pet hit them, <br/>\nthen nuking them when they got low.  And Enchantress pets are the weakest in the <br/>\ngame.  While in the teens, I watched Necros of lower level than me soloing Dervs <br/>\nthat I couldn&#39;t take on a bet.  In the 20s, I watched a Wizard (who was blue to <br/>\nme) soloing crocs in Oasis that were white and yellow to me, and killing them at <br/>\napproximately twice the rate that I was killing blue caimans.  A pet cast by a <br/>\ncaster of equal rank to me melees better than I do.  So given that all of the <br/>\ncaster classes come with an easily created tank component that is better at <br/>\nmelee than I am, why am I a hybrid while they not?  Just asking.<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 40 songs, Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
