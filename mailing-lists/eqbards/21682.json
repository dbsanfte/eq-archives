They shouldn&#39;t ban me for<br/>\nfinding them. They should thank me and fix them, but since they are too<br/>\nproud to do the former and too lazy to do the latter, they instead threaten<br/>\nto ban people.  It&#39;s really pretty silly.  They are basically banning people<br/>\nfrom being smarter than they are.  Figure out something that allows you to<br/>\ngain xp or money faster than &quot;The Vision&quot; allows and it is either nerfed or<br/>\nbanned.
