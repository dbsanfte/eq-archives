I was grouped with an enchanter and the<br/>\nspells I was twisting was Fulfil&#39;s, Hymn, and Guardian.  Not exactly an<br/>\noptimal use of my abilities.  All AoE songs were off limits because the<br/>\n&#39;chanter was mezzing.  He was Alacrity&#39;ing all four tanks (including me) and<br/>\nnever went oom the entire night.  Once he got down to 10% after fighting 8<br/>\nor 9 mobs in rapid succession.  Having a cleric, druid, or even Paladin<br/>\nwould have been far more effective for the group but luckily they were all<br/>\nfriends.  I was helpful against some of the casters for resist buffing, but<br/>\nhalf the time the &#39;chanter was able to keep 3 mobs mezzed and stun the<br/>\ncaster continuously without going oom.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\nwhat level are you?  i don&#39;t think i was ever at a level where i didn&#39;t want<br/>\nan<br/>\nenchanter in the group except when i was soloing thru level 5.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
