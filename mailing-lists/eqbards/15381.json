It should be a pretty good item.  AC 10 for a shoulder <br/>\n&gt; slot item is<br/>\n&gt; &#39;ok&#39; (crafted pauldrons is better; even crested is better). <br/>\n&gt; Dex/Agi +9 would<br/>\n&gt; be damn nice if those stats did anything. HP +50 &lt;cough&gt; what <br/>\n&gt; is the HP buff<br/>\n&gt; from a Bloodstone symbol? Jasper? Peridot? And Sv FIRE + 15 <br/>\n&gt; is damn nice but<br/>\n&gt; were they thinking this will be usefull for camping Naggy?  <br/>\n&gt; You need the<br/>\n&gt; Fire resist before you take Naggy not after &lt;sheesh&gt; And <br/>\n&gt; Haste is damn nice<br/>\n&gt; effect no matter what.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s like they had some idea about dex/agi/str etc all being <br/>\n&gt; meaningful but<br/>\n&gt; somehow lost something along the way.
