I asked her what success she had, here is her reply:<br/>\n<br/>\nActually group mes didnt work well. I DID mes the<br/>\nspooky spider, but you guys decided to fight it 1st<br/>\nLOL.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the giants, I worked with single mes, spell<br/>\ncalled Entrance. AND IT WORKED. Mebbe just for a short<br/>\ntime, but it worked, cuz I received a note &#39;IG has<br/>\nbeen entranced&#39;, which is always good to hear.<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe still got wiped out en-mass, not sure if it was the IG priest or the <br/>\nKings room goblins repoping that was the death stroke.  Initial pull netted <br/>\n3 IGs and an IG priest and one of the big spiders, for at least 3 groups of <br/>\nL30s up to a couple 50&#39;s. We definitely need practice coordinating between <br/>\ngroups too. But we had one heck of a great time anyways!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLady Brilinnia Ban&#39;Sidhe<br/>\nKnight Marshall, Order of the Rose<br/>\nExcalibur<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
