I&#39;ll save my bardic speech<br/>\n  for another time.

Just trying to cut the illusion<br/>\n  we often give of ourselves as being slightly more powerful than<br/>\n  we are in reality.  After all, we are storytellers, and we have<br/>\n  to make ourselves look good in the public eye.  If you didnt solo<br/>\n  like 5 hill giants at once with half your hp, and two rusty<br/>\n  daggers, what good are you?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Just like that one bard claiming to solo hill giants using charm<br/>\n  at level 30.  I think that was a pretty tall tale.  Ask Sylly how<br/>\n  her charming experience went when she was doing it at level 34.<br/>\n  But, hell, it sure sounded good!
