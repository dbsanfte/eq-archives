It simply blows my mind that anyone<br/>\n&gt; could have a 50th Level character, let alone more than one!  I&#39;ve got three<br/>\n&gt; characters, each on a different server:<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  I&#39;ve got 65 or so /played days, I hit L50 just before 60 days played.<br/>\n  I didn&#39;t rush Harmonic along, and have played a few classes up to L10<br/>\n  to see how the feel.  Still, I stick with the bard.  I&#39;ve got a L20<br/>\n  druid that I play more and more these days, however.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I used to hit the PoH every night, but now since Verant has changed<br/>\n  the plane, no one even bothers going up there.<br/>\n<br/>\n  So now the PoH joins the other planes as weekend only events.  Now<br/>\n  during the week, I hardly play my bard.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I work 9am to 6pm ET.  I have a kitten and a girlfriend to feed.<br/>\n  /chuckle  I usually play for about 4-5 hours a night.  Eat dinner<br/>\n  at the keyboard, horrible dinners at that.  Need to start eating<br/>\n  better.  After EQ last night for example, I finished the Hobbitt<br/>\n  and started on the Fellowship of the Ring, while my girlfriend<br/>\n  was reading Harry Potter.  Weekends, she works all day, so I get<br/>\n  to bust my neck sitting at the computer all day.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Not as hardcore as some people by far, and I still have a little<br/>\n  life outside EQ left =)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
