I got one<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; I use in the Planes.  I can stand in the melee and not worry about getting<br/>\n&gt; excessive attention.  With 6 Note and Yk, I would draw attention and take<br/>\n&gt; damage.  Then I went to 6NB and Dragoon Dirk.  Then I got the Shimmering<br/>\nOrb<br/>\n&gt; and enjoy the ac boost and can pretty much melee the whole time. My<br/>\npersonal<br/>\n&gt; opinion is that my greatest value to my group and our team is my delivery<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; mana.  If i die, it&#39;s a big waste of time and mana and adds to instead of<br/>\n&gt; reducing the down time.  Plus I am totally sick of dying.  Sure 49/50 res<br/>\n&gt; gets you 80-90% xp back but 4 deaths with exp res&#39;s is still over half a<br/>\nbub<br/>\n&gt; and at 48 thats *hours* of boring camping blues.  So my focus is on<br/>\nsurvial,<br/>\n&gt; mana delivery and what ever additional buffs or resists are required.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sylly<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Greg Gillan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ggillan@...\">ggillan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Taunt on the orb is huge, and it goes off a lot.
