I was<br/>\ntotally unable to do much of anything in any of the events I was lucky<br/>\nenough to be present at.  Even though the npcs that were to be fought were<br/>\nwhite or yellow to me and my group in some cases, they were just being nuked<br/>\nby level 40+&#39;s so there was no point in actually trying to attack them.  The<br/>\nfew we did engage would get blasted to smithereens by <br/>\nsomeone long before our group of four could ever bring it below half.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy complaint is those people who spend more time on the game don&#39;t get more<br/>\nenjoyment out of dynamic events, they get all of it.  Might as well hold all<br/>\nof them on the planes from now on far as I can see.  We&#39;re not talking about<br/>\nlevels or items here, we&#39;re talking about being allowed to actually<br/>\nparticipate.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\nthere&#39;s nothing wrong with that.  do you disagree with the statement that<br/>\nif you spend more time in the game you should have better items and attain<br/>\nhigher levels?  True casual gamers aren&#39;t concerned that much with items<br/>\nand levels.  the only people upset by this statement are the power gamers<br/>\nwho don&#39;t have time to put into the game.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
