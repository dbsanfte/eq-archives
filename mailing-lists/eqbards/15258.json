First I grabbed eqparse and used the<br/>\nsame program you did I believe and got the same<br/>\nsummary numbers so I got the log files ok and intact. <br/>\nI believe that when you run analysis on the log with<br/>\neqparse it finds &quot;soandso saved.&quot; to determine your<br/>\nname and a /who on the zone to determine the rest of<br/>\nyour information.  I deleted the /who entry with you<br/>\non it and it no longer knew your race/class. :)  I<br/>\nwhipped up a little parser of my own to extract some<br/>\nof the data I wanted and found this distribution. <br/>\n(Btw eqparse does do a histogram for you but its<br/>\noverall combat statistics so the easy way to get this<br/>\ndistribution is strip out all your pierces and run<br/>\neqparse on the log again.)  These are the numbers of<br/>\nhits for each damage number given with the indicated<br/>\nweapon in primary hand.  <br/>\n<br/>\ndmg\tWak\tYak<br/>\n0*\t437\t399<br/>\n1\t0\t0<br/>\n2\t0\t0<br/>\n3\t0\t0<br/>\n4\t0\t0<br/>\n5\t0\t0<br/>\n6\t0\t0<br/>\n7\t0\t0<br/>\n8\t75\t55<br/>\n9\t10\t20<br/>\n10\t13\t9<br/>\n11\t30\t14<br/>\n12\t21\t13<br/>\n13\t37\t29<br/>\n14\t25\t19<br/>\n15\t46\t16<br/>\n16\t31\t28<br/>\n17\t25\t26<br/>\n18\t28\t19<br/>\n19\t22\t18<br/>\n20\t38\t31<br/>\n21\t66\t34<br/>\n22\t20\t19<br/>\n23\t14\t80<br/>\n24\t4\t8<br/>\n25\t11\t16<br/>\n26\t7\t8<br/>\n27\t12\t7<br/>\n28\t9\t11<br/>\n29\t7\t8<br/>\n30\t\t7<br/>\n31\t\t3<br/>\n32\t\t8<br/>\n33\t\t2<br/>\n<br/>\n*the 0&#39;s were marked as &quot;miss&quot; and do not include<br/>\nenemy dodges, parry&#39;s or ripostes.<br/>\n<br/>\nPreliminary Analysis:  You&#39;ll see that every hit was<br/>\ngiven a +7 damage...this is consistant with the<br/>\nprimary hand damage bonus of (level-25)/3 (subject was<br/>\n46 in the test).  You will see 2 large modal spikes in<br/>\neach column.  1 at 8 points of damage and one at<br/>\n2*dmg+bonus (21 for Wak, 23 for Yak).  Also note that<br/>\nthe min dmg spikes are not insignificant in size.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother note.  If you&#39;re looking at hit %&#39;s something<br/>\nto consider is how does the combat formula work with<br/>\nrespect to dodge/parry/riposte?  My presumption is<br/>\nthat A checks for a successfull hit against B, then if<br/>\nsuccessfull B gets a dodge check, if it fails, a parry<br/>\ncheck, if it succeeds a riposte check.  If this<br/>\nsupposition is correct then d/p/r&#39;s would count into<br/>\nyour chance to hit.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo i&#39;ve written a rather long and windy blurb<br/>\nhere...just ignore me if you&#39;re not interested. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n-David<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTalk to your friends online with Yahoo!
