I recently left my small, &quot;family&quot; guild (it was<br/>\n&gt;disbanding due to loss of many players). I joined a smallish (12-20 people<br/>\n&gt;on during prime play, almost all 45+) guild where some of my other former<br/>\n&gt;guild mates had gone.  I like almost  everyone in the new guild, but I&#39;m not<br/>\n&gt;thrilled with the way the guild does some things (I don&#39;t want to get into<br/>\n&gt;specifics because there are a few Veeshan bards here and don&#39;t want to start<br/>\n&gt;any trouble).  However, I basically only get to do things with guildies once<br/>\n&gt;at week at most, so essentially I&#39;m still stuck in the same problem (I end<br/>\n&gt;up in pick up groups in Karnors most nights) I had in my family guild. (I<br/>\n&gt;was the highest lvl in the guild when I left).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So what should I do?  Leave the guild and try to join a big powerful guild<br/>\n&gt;(where I won&#39;t like many of the people, but at least I&#39;ll be able to do<br/>\n&gt;guild stuff most of the time I play)?  Pretty much give up being able to<br/>\n&gt;play after 50, and just play my cleric in my Thrusday night group (39 now)?<br/>\n&gt;Something else?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Elfson Allegro 52 Veeshan<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Your use of Yahoo!
