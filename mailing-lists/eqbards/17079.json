I think there are also 3 other<br/>\nfrogs that spawn in the same room.  So there is a possibility that there<br/>\ncould be 4 frog wizards, if by some miracle you there before anyone else.<br/>\nMost likely, you&#39;ll be put on a list again.<br/>\n<br/>\n  If not, 2 of the spawns are near the very back of the room, and can be<br/>\nsuccesfully lamented, leaving you to fight 2 at once, if you pull to the<br/>\nfront of the room.  (the room only has one entrance/exit, so you&#39;ll know<br/>\nwhich one I&#39;m talking about).<br/>\n<br/>\n  Remember, lament all of them first, starting with the rear ones.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The exe isn&#39;t too uncommon a spawn, but I&#39;ve only seen him with the sword<br/>\nabout 1 out of 7 or so times.<br/>\n<br/>\n  To me, he didn&#39;t seem much harder with the sword than without, but that<br/>\ntime I was in a very tank heavy group, and didn&#39;t have to take the beating<br/>\n:)<br/>\n<br/>\n  He is going to hit pretty hard, so I hope you have a warrior, paladin or<br/>\nranger with you to take the beating.<br/>\n<br/>\n  As far as directions, I can&#39;t really describe that too well, but maybe<br/>\nsomeone here will be a bit more helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\nBien<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Well, I&#39;m sure you&#39;re all getting very tired of hearing my pleas for<br/>\n&gt; advice,<br/>\n&gt; but you guys give such awesome advice that things go smoothly and I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; forced<br/>\n&gt; to move on.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Last night our group went to cazic to get the RS BP for our rogue. We<br/>\n&gt; arrived in cazic at the very over populated hour of 9:30 pm est, and<br/>\n&gt; needless to say, EVERYTHING was camped. After getting in contact with the<br/>\n&gt; AoF group, we put our selves on the list and ported over to MM to earn<br/>\n&gt; some<br/>\n&gt; exp while waiting. 3 hours later, we get the tell saying they are leaving<br/>\n&gt; so<br/>\n&gt; we port back and prepare ourselves.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We were a little slow getting to the room since we had to rebind ourselves<br/>\n&gt; in Ogguk and by the time we got there the room was fully spawned. But,<br/>\n&gt; using<br/>\n&gt; the &quot;Ever So Handy&quot; directions(tm) from the list, we had no trouble<br/>\n&gt; breaking<br/>\n&gt; and clearing the spawn.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We pulled the sewer room first and learned that alligators have an endless<br/>\n&gt; amount of HP. After that we pulled the avatar room trying very hard to<br/>\n&gt; kill<br/>\n&gt; the avatar PH last. After a 10 minute wait, I went back in and pulled the<br/>\n&gt; top room over the avatar globe. And then we set to pulling the sewers<br/>\n&gt; while<br/>\n&gt; waiting.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A few bad pulls led to evacs, as did some miscomunications, but when all<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; dust settled the score was Us 2, avatar 0. We walked away with 1 set of<br/>\n&gt; claws and the ravenscale BP we were after. ( if only it had been ruby = P<br/>\n&gt; )<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I didn&#39;t expect the camp to go that smoothly. Knowing the BP is the rare<br/>\n&gt; drop, I expected to be there a few days at least before seeing the BP. We<br/>\n&gt; got extremely lucky. We were hoping to get some boots off the cenobite<br/>\n&gt; also,<br/>\n&gt; but he didn&#39;t make any appearances, so our rogue capitulated to buying<br/>\n&gt; them<br/>\n&gt; rather than camp them.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So, the point is now I need advice on our next camp spot. which is...<br/>\n&gt; (drumroll)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The Ghoul Executioner in lower guk.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I know he&#39;s a level 37 ish warrior. But that&#39;s about it. Any info on the<br/>\n&gt; other spawns in the room (how many) and his relative str when spawned with<br/>\n&gt; the hood vs with the axe would be greatly appreciated. Also, I have yet to<br/>\n&gt; find a stellar map of lower guk. (although I&#39;m working on one) I can get<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; the store room easily and can navigate the live side, but the dead side is<br/>\n&gt; still very much a mystery. Any directions on getting to the exe would be<br/>\n&gt; greatly appreciated.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Draelon Stormsong<br/>\n&gt; bard of the Tribunal<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; LOW RATE, NO WAIT!<br/>\n&gt; Get a NextCard Visa, in 30 seconds!
