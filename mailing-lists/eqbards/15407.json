My group consisted of me (35 bard), 33<br/>\n&gt; ranger, two 35 druids, and a 37 enchanter.  We camped in the<br/>\n&gt; bartender room<br/>\n&gt; in Sol A trying to get a armor component for the ranger.  Everything we<br/>\n&gt; fought conned either blue or green to me.  During combats, I<br/>\n&gt; weaved Chant of<br/>\n&gt; Battle, Largos, and Psalm of Cooling.  I switched to Elemental and Pixie<br/>\n&gt; Strike if we faced a wizzie or shaman.  Over the course of 4 hours in that<br/>\n&gt; room, I never lost more than a bub of health.  It was very<br/>\n&gt; difficult for me<br/>\n&gt; to even get something to attack me.  Standard taunt factors from the other<br/>\n&gt; players that came into play were 1) ranger did more melee damage<br/>\n&gt; than me, 2)<br/>\n&gt; one druid did more damage with lightning spells, 3) one druid was<br/>\n&gt; full time<br/>\n&gt; healer, 4) enchanter was doing crowd control.  In the past, even with the<br/>\n&gt; taunt factors of the other players considered, weaving the three<br/>\n&gt; songs I was<br/>\n&gt; using was usually enough to get all the mobs focused on killing me.  For<br/>\n&gt; last night, most likely explanation would be either 1) bard hate was<br/>\n&gt; actually reduced or 2) enchanter crowd control overrode bard hate.   I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; inclined to believe it was the enchanter that caused the mobs to<br/>\n&gt; ignore me.<br/>\n&gt; Could have been a completely different story if no enchanter is<br/>\n&gt; around and I<br/>\n&gt; have crowd control duties.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sent:\tThursday, February 24, 2000 7:55 AM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject:\tRe: [eqbards] Bard Hate (was Permafrost King Room)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; More evidence for reduced bard hate.  I joined Rokenn&#39;s guild<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for a Vox attempt last night (4 failures).  The last one,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; somehow I lived.  I played resists the entire battle.  When<br/>\n&gt; &gt; all three melee people and the cleric in my group died, I was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; at a bubble and a half so I meleed Vox a bit, healed the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (still alive) enchanter, meleed the priest of Nagafen and some<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ice giants a bit.  I was expecting to get summoned at any<br/>\n&gt; &gt; moment, but I ran around doing all this for about 3 minutes<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with nothing happening.  I didn&#39;t know what to do because it&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; &gt; never occurred to me that I might live.  Eventually I zoned.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I think I was the only melee person to survive.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; OTOH, the first try, I played my resist song for a couple<br/>\n&gt; &gt; rounds, Vox summoned me, and clawed me to death right off the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bat.  :)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --<br/>\n&gt; &gt; John H.
