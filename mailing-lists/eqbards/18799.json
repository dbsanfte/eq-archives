If I&#39;m singing Selo&#39;s and someone tries to<br/>\ncast SoW on a group member, it won&#39;t stick.  But if I stop singing,<br/>\nand then they have SoW cast upon them, and then I start singing again,<br/>\nthe rest of the group gets Selo&#39;s, while the person SoW&#39;ed keeps his<br/>\nSoW.  So assuming enduring breath works in the same way, if group<br/>\nmembers get enduring breath cast on them before the bard sings his<br/>\nsong, they should be using the spell, while the bard is using the<br/>\nsong.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdagia, Wood Elf Bard of 14 songs<br/>\nLuclin</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
