While sitting <br/>\n\t\tcalmly on the deck of the boat on my way to Faydwer, I<br/>\nsuddenly found myself <br/>\n\t\tsitting on a rock in the middle of OOT surrounded by Sirens<br/>\nand Aqua-goblins <br/>\n\t\twith the boat nowhere in sight. I have been stuck there for<br/>\n2 days now. I <br/>\n\t\tpetitioned immediately of course, but there were no GM&#39;s on<br/>\nthen. I have <br/>\n\t\tlogged back in morning, afternoon, and evening but only once<br/>\nsaw a GM log <br/>\n\t\ton. They were on less than 5 minutes and logged off again<br/>\nwithout answering <br/>\n\t\tmy petition. I&#39;ve tried to catch the boat in passing, but<br/>\ndon&#39;t stand a <br/>\n\t\tchance of catching it. I don&#39;t want to abandon my bard, my<br/>\nguild has <br/>\n\t\tinvested too much into helping me catch up with them in<br/>\nlevels.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tZendarin<br/>\n\t\tThe Wandering Minstrel<br/>\n\t\tFrustrated on Fennin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tWhat do fashion and football have in common?<br/>\n\t\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n\t\tThey both have communities at ONElist.
