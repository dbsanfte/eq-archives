This allows you to manipulate your inventory from the normal<br/>\ninterface screen without having to go to inventory. So what I do is have my<br/>\nweapon, shield and instruments all on the same button panel and can now<br/>\nswitch back and forth while running, no problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nTaelin, Songweavers of Kelethin.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pr0teus@...\">pr0teus@...</a> on 04/21/99 07:21:19 PM<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease respond to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n                                                                           <br/>\n                                                                           <br/>\n                                                                           <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n                                                              <br/>\n                                                              <br/>\n                                                              <br/>\n To:      <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>                                 <br/>\n                                                              <br/>\n cc:      (bcc: Terry Chlebek/DPT)                            <br/>\n                                                              <br/>\n                                                              <br/>\n                                                              <br/>\n Subject: [eqbards] Equipping weapon(s)/shield and            <br/>\n          instruments                                         <br/>\n                                                              <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Proteus &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pr0teus@...\">pr0teus@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday I filled out a feedback form asking for some kind of hot-key<br/>\nfor us bards to switch from our equipped weapon(s)/shield to an<br/>\ninstrument. Kinda like how you can switch from your melee weapon to your<br/>\nrange weapon. I dunno about anyone else, but its a real pain when you<br/>\nwant to sit down and rest after a battle to open up your persona, click<br/>\non the Inv button above your player image, then click on your weapon,<br/>\ndrop it in your inv, click on your shield (or secondary weapon), drop it<br/>\nin your inv, and then get your lute (or other instrument) which may be<br/>\nin a backpack or something, and put it in your secondary hand. And then<br/>\nby the time you&#39;ve done that, you&#39;re fully healed, so you have to do the<br/>\nexact reverse.<br/>\nThis may sound like a tedious task, but when you&#39;re in danger or trying<br/>\nto equip your drum while running for your life, it really makes a<br/>\ndifference. Or when you have to tell your party members to hold on while<br/>\nyour equip or unequip your instrument before they take off on you.<br/>\nI have my mouse sensitivity all the way up, and I keep all my<br/>\ninstruments and weapons in my inv slots (not in backpacks) so I can do<br/>\nthis as quickly as possible, but its still not a very quick operation,<br/>\neven if it is done smoothly.<br/>\nThe other alternative is to never, or hardly ever use a weapon/shield<br/>\nand just use hand to hand. But thats not always wise, especially when<br/>\nsoloing, or with a small group who depend on your 16 or 17 dam from your<br/>\nminotaur axe to keep the situation from getting ugly.<br/>\nIf anyone else has feels the same way about this, PLEASE fill out a<br/>\nfeedback form in-game by typing /feedback and requesting such an option.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood day to you all, and may your songs of battle bring pride upon us.<br/>\nMaev<br/>\nBard of Freeport<br/>\nRealm of Tarew Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nNew hobbies?
