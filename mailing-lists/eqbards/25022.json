Can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; we get rid of this?<br/>\n&gt; 3) There is no text message for Shield of Song.<br/>\n&gt; 4) Though not directly bard related it is a bit.  Around the time of the<br/>\n&gt; DX7 patch the off/low/med/high particle effect settings became broken.  Off<br/>\n&gt; now displays what low used to be.  The &quot;new&quot; low is no different from<br/>\n&gt; medium and high.  I bumped a post about this nearly six months ago.  Ester<br/>\n&gt; said they would look in to it.
