Lots of things<br/>\nto charm, lots of space to run.  There are three big things to worry about though, from my<br/>\nexperience:<br/>\n<br/>\n- The pathing and warping in the zone is VERY bad.  You&#39;ll be fighting a giant and suddenly<br/>\n  it&#39;s just GONE.  Sometimes it warps just a short distance, which is no big deal,<br/>\n  he&#39;ll come running after you quickly enough.  The real danger is when they warp a long<br/>\n  distance away, and then never come back.  Never, that is, until you happen to walk<br/>\n  near him later, and he comes running with his 4 giant friends and the little cyclops<br/>\n  who wants to be part of the group.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Hasten Quickboots or whatever the name of the little dude from the JBoot quest is<br/>\n  steals your kills.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Sometimes there&#39;s too MANY hill giants.  When you&#39;re in a group, one hill giant is tasty,<br/>\n  two makes them see how powerful you are as a bard.  Three means run to the zone.<br/>\n  Four means run to the zone and try and take a screen cap.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nJyzan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Wow, thanks for the tip on clearing the &quot;trash&quot; mobs from the<br/>\n&gt; hills here to get giants to spawn.  I made over 350pp there<br/>\n&gt; tonight, and each of my friends there made over 200pp (I was<br/>\n&gt; soloing a couple hours before the others showed up).  I think<br/>\n&gt; my guild raked in close to 2000pp for the night, as well as 8<br/>\n&gt; or 9 lambent stones.  Now if they&#39;ll just fix Genni...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This place is a high level bard&#39;s dream.  Lots of open space<br/>\n&gt; to run around in, great cash loot, merchants nearby so you can<br/>\n&gt; sell the heavy weapons, etc.  The only down side was that I<br/>\n&gt; died once.  I had two giants fighting each other, then charm<br/>\n&gt; was resisted 4 times in a row, I accidently let Accelerando<br/>\n&gt; drop, and got chain-stunned 3 times, which was long enough for<br/>\n&gt; both giants to kill me.  My group wasn&#39;t able to get within<br/>\n&gt; range to heal me in time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
