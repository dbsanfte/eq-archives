My reasons for going","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1851235361\">I&#39;ve been well inundated with the notion that Lower Guk and Sol B will be my<br/>\nhome from 35 up since there are very few other places to be. My reasons for<br/>\ngoing to guk were two fold.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) I had to go just because I felt I would be able to do something there.<br/>\nThings went very well for me and I made half a bubble of my first hell level<br/>\nin a little over an hour.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) I wanted to kill the gargoyle to get my basalt carapace first hand.<br/>\n(which I did) I&#39;m a firm believer in earning my equipment. Besides, lambent<br/>\nBPs go for 1000-1500 p on my server, and I just don&#39;t have the cash.<br/>\n<br/>\nGenerally I tend to aviod the crowded areas of the server. Although since<br/>\nthe tribunal is a fairly new server, it isn&#39;t all that crowded yet. (40<br/>\npeople in lower guk on friday night, 30 in sol b)<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the last 5 levels I&#39;ve been a sol a junkie. This is one of the most<br/>\nunderused zones in the game. The most I&#39;ve ever seen in the zone were 25<br/>\npeople. Also, if you have a good group and a good puller, the exp flows so<br/>\nfast you have trouble keeping your skills maxed. (I made levels 25, 26, 28<br/>\nin one day each) My current plan is to stay in sol a until I hit 32 or I get<br/>\nmy firewalker boots. Once I hit 32 I&#39;m hoping I&#39;ll be accepted everywhere,<br/>\nso I&#39;ll probably venture over to MM and try to get my instruments and finish<br/>\noff my lambent BP. Depending on how camped the castle is on my server I may<br/>\nstay and try to get a pair of EBWs. (I figure that ought to be good for at<br/>\nleast 3-4 levels) Then I&#39;ll be ready to hit L Guk, Sol B or Kedge. Of course<br/>\nif I find someplace less crowded, then I&#39;ll convince my group to follow me.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, that&#39;s the plan at least. We&#39;ll see how it works out. ;┬¼ )<br/>\n<br/>\nDraelon Stromsong<br/>\nthe Tribunal<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: JasonF [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jasonf@...\">jasonf@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, March 06, 2000 11:20 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] MM Advice...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;JasonF&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jasonf@...\">jasonf@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nCongratulations on level 30!  It&#39;s not long now until 32 when you&#39;ll become<br/>\nevery caster&#39;s friend.  ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s excellent that you explored some of Lower Guk, it&#39;s a fun place,<br/>\nhowever, I&#39;d like to offer a friendly word of advice.  Go elsewhere until<br/>\nyou get 35th or so (Cazic-Thule, Rathe Mts., Mistmoore, Paw), because from<br/>\n35th up about the only places you can go routinely for experience are Lower<br/>\nGuk, Sol B and occassionally Mistmoore and Paw.  Believe me when I say that<br/>\nyou will get VERY VERY tired of these zones, and the earlier you start going<br/>\nthere the sooner you get tired of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to Mistmoore, I do have some tips for getting drums.  I don&#39;t have time<br/>\nto type it up and the moment (cause I&#39;m damn longwinded as we all know), but<br/>\nI will do so today and post what I know.  That&#39;s an interesting camp.<br/>\n<br/>\n[48 Bard] Crier (Half Elf) &lt;Seekers of Norrath&gt; ZONE: work</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
