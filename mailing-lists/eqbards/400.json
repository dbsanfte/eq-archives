Everyone seems to really want to help each other and give good sound<br/>\nadvice based on actual experience. I am also a Lev 9 Half-Elf Bard. I love<br/>\nto solo.

As mentioned in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; previous reply, we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bards are actually very good soloists.  When things<br/>\n&gt; &gt; get hairy, we have the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; accellerando  - a near full-proff excape route.  In<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the situation you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; described, if I was getting hit hard and hit a lot,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;d hit accellerando at<br/>\n&gt; &gt; about 3 bars of health.  This is because you slow<br/>\n&gt; &gt; down below 2 bars and you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; may need that extra bar to get some distance between<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you and the orcs.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Always have accellerando hot-keyed.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Second, lament is a great spell but it can, as you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have learned, fail.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; However, the lower the level of creature is compared<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to you, the more likely<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it is to succeed.  Never use it on a white or higher<br/>\n&gt; &gt; con.  It will fail way<br/>\n&gt; &gt; too often.  But, if they all con green or a low<br/>\n&gt; &gt; blue, you could solo a camp<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and clean it out.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Third, our greatest power is in grouping, but<br/>\n&gt; &gt; grouping is risky.  It is a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; high-trust situation.  Be very careful who you group<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with and guage how well<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you can trust them.  I might group with a group like<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you had described, but<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I would not trust them to save my butt if I got in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; trouble and at the first<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sign of trouble, I&#39;d run.  Only when they have shown<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that they can be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; counted on to keep me alive when the going got rough<br/>\n&gt; &gt; would I let myself get<br/>\n&gt; &gt; low in health.  I die more frequently in a group<br/>\n&gt; &gt; then solo because I am<br/>\n&gt; &gt; still too trusting and eager to jump into danger to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; save someone whose<br/>\n&gt; &gt; stupidity got them into trouble... usually failing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and dieing along side of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; them.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Be up front with them about this though.  Make sure<br/>\n&gt; &gt; they understand that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; since you don&#39;t know them well, and your life is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; dear to you, you will do<br/>\n&gt; &gt; what you have to to protect it until some trust and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; teamwork has developed.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Has ONElist changed your life?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Visit our homepage and share with us your<br/>\n&gt; &gt; experiences at ONElist of the Week!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; _________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Get your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Attention small business owners:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Did you know that ONElist is a great way for small business owners<br/>\n&gt; to stay in touch with their customers?<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
