Look at the<br/>\nrules.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe contest will find the &quot;best&quot; according to what EQ rewards in achievement<br/>\n(as detailed in your response - time,guild,organization,gear that is<br/>\nrightful result of those three).  I won&#39;t argue its hard - the endgame<br/>\ndemands so much I had to just plain quit.  I enjoyed EQ - but I can&#39;t devote<br/>\nthe time it takes to do the endgame well.  I tried with two different<br/>\nclasses to be sure ... and this is long enough ago its all water under the<br/>\nbridge.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, if I could figure out what the contest does to choose the better<br/>\n&quot;Bard&quot;. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe contest is a fanstastic reward for all those who are playing to win, and<br/>\nhave the time and resources to do so.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe contests are totally without meaning to people who either play to have<br/>\nfun or have limited time available to pursue the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou also can&#39;t convince me that with those rules it will find the better<br/>\n&quot;Bard&quot;.  It will find the Bard with the best in-game resources.  Since, as<br/>\nyou correctly point out, gathering those resources takes a herculean<br/>\neffort - winning the contest will certainly mean something to the person who<br/>\ndoes, and his/her backers.  However, it won&#39;t infuse any meaning into the<br/>\ncontest for the rest of us either.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Menuette (retired)<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: James Schuldes [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, August 07, 2001 11:26 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] RE: Bard BOTB<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst off, other bards have the same weps - one other bard that I personally<br/>\nknow of does.
