I hate to use UO as an example but in this case it serves as a<br/>\nbeautiful example.  It just had something EQ missed.  When you died you<br/>\ncould count on losing every item you had been carrying on you, and no<br/>\nparticular item was THE item that you HAD to have to stay competitive, they<br/>\nwere all relatively easy to get.  So instead of being obligated to sit<br/>\nsomeplace for hours and hours on end, you might be able to entertain<br/>\nyourself or others in the local tavern, or magic shop.  This was SO off the<br/>\nsubject, just gave me something to type about  -=)   Thanks</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
