Maybe this was because I was just in banded/bronze at<br/>\nthe time, not much else in the way of armor upgrades. For me, it wasn&#39;t<br/>\nuntil 25 where I could handle single gargs with little trepidation.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, as a courtesy, I usually tried to leave 1 garg on the island before I<br/>\nlogged off if nobody else was around, since the gargs kill the skeletons.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, nice to melee a gargoyle who is fighting a skeleton as the skeleton<br/>\nwill keep hitting the gargoyle. Just make sure you kill the skeleton before<br/>\nkilling the gargoyle to ensure the skeleton doesn&#39;t get credited with<br/>\nkilling the gargoyle. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n---Windleaf</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
