Also backing off does no good.  Unless the mob is rooted they<br/>\nfollow me around like puppies wherever I go.  This makes it more difficult<br/>\nfor the other tank to melee the mob effectively.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night my group was 34 cleric, 33 enchanter, 27 wizard, 26 shaman and I<br/>\nstill took almost 50% of the damage.  The wizard was the only one able to<br/>\nget mobs of me and with her low hp&#39;s can hardly afford to do so.  Tanking<br/>\nwith a 26th lvl troll shaman was kinda cool, especially since the dwarf was<br/>\nthe tallest among us, but painful.  Fortunately the cleric was easily up to<br/>\nthe healing task and even joked about how bards made his job too easy,<br/>\ngenerally only one hp bar to watch.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso I did try stopping my songs a couple of times, but it didn&#39;t seem to<br/>\nmatter.  By that time I had probably cast on the order of 25+ spells to<br/>\nanyone else&#39;s 6 or so.  Even doing that much less damage didn&#39;t seem to<br/>\nmatter.  I guess it doesn&#39;t help that my weapons proc&#39;ed a total of 9 times<br/>\nin one fight.  (6 Berserks, 3 Screaming Maces)  Even though the additional<br/>\nscreams had no effect as I was already buffed I&#39;m sure they still added to<br/>\nthe hate list.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; A bit extreme..  I stop singing all the time to get mobs off me, stop<br/>\n&gt; attacking too.  That doesn&#39;t mean I won&#39;t start again in 5 seconds, but if<br/>\n&gt; removing myself from the situation for that time puts the damage back<br/>\n&gt; where it belongs, it&#39;s worth it.  A wizard needs to know when to stop<br/>\n&gt; nuking, a ranger needs to know when to stop taunting, a bard needs to<br/>\n&gt; know when to stop singing.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Athren<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;I have to agree with Athren.  A player (of any type) who jumps into battle<br/>\n </span></blockquote>with <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;guns a-blazin&#39; and doesn&#39;t know when to back off is one of the more<br/>\n </span></blockquote>annoying <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;player types to have to group with.  This is particularly true in any party<br/>\n </span></blockquote>with <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;a healing shortage.

If<br/>\n </span></blockquote>they <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;have to try to continue without me, or wait for me to return, it&#39;s a lot<br/>\n </span></blockquote>worse <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;for them than getting a bit less assistance from me in any one particular<br/>\n </span></blockquote>fight. <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; (And it&#39;s more fun for me, too.)<br/>\n&gt;Kenross Cantoforjado, 40 songs, Innoruuk </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
