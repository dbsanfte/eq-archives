Only 4 mobs will attack you at<br/>\n&gt; once.  Others that have aggroed on you will either not move<br/>\n&gt; (thus staying out of range), or not attack (if they are<br/>\n&gt; already in range), or if there&#39;s another target they&#39;ll attack<br/>\n&gt; that instead.  As a result, it&#39;s more difficult to get more<br/>\n&gt; than 4 mobs within range of a song at once if you&#39;re alone<br/>\n&gt; (it&#39;s really easy if you&#39;re grouped or in a crowd of players).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From what I&#39;ve seen, I also think if none of the mobs are<br/>\n&gt; actually attacking you (i.e. you&#39;re outrunning them), then<br/>\n&gt; there is no limit to the number of mobs that can chase you.  <br/>\n&gt; But once they get within attack range, you&#39;ll only get<br/>\n&gt; attacked by four at a time.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This reminds of something similar. When soloing on Spectre Island in OOT, I<br/>\nwould frequently round up as many skeletons as I could and kill them all<br/>\nwith DDD/COD so I could get gargoyles to spawn. Whenever I had a pull of 4<br/>\n(I never pulled more than 4) one would run away leaving me able to only wipe<br/>\nout 3 simultaneously. Usually I&#39;d be punching one of the 3, so when that one<br/>\ndied, the one that ran away would come back and attack me. This was maybe<br/>\nabout a month ago and I was around level 24 or so.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt appeared that with either DDD or COD (I was weaving both so can&#39;t tell if<br/>\nthis effect applies to both or just one of these songs), the limit of the<br/>\nnumber of creatures who could be affected by my song was 3. Is this normal<br/>\nfor our AOE songs? Is Lullaby the only AOE song that affects 4 mobs without<br/>\nthem moving out of aggro range? Just wondering. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n---Windleaf, Half Elf 28th level bard on Bertox</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
