For those that missed the<br/>\nmessage, I&#39;ve attached it below.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am pleased to be able to report back to you all the results of my<br/>\ndiscussions with the senior GM administrator for the server and the<br/>\noutcome for me personally.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt took a few days, a couple of emails and some patience before I got<br/>\nto speak to the GM in person on Friday night (curse me for living in<br/>\nEngland, it seems, and needing to go to bed at a reasonable time<br/>\nduring the week!)  However, my conversation with the GM was polite,<br/>\ncourteous and friendly.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe outcome was that my characters were restored to the last backup,<br/>\nmy items and money have now broadly been restored to me and I feel<br/>\nsignificantly happier in myself and about Verant as a whole than I did<br/>\nat the start of the week.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne negative side effect was that I lost the level I gained during<br/>\nSunday, but that can be more easily recovered.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately, it appears that Verant are unable to trace the person<br/>\nwho gained access to my account and so no action can be taken against<br/>\nthem.  If anything useful has come out of this, I hope it will be that<br/>\nthe security logs in place at the station/Verant/wherever can be<br/>\naltered so that an IP address, or the CD key is recorded and therefore<br/>\nan individual account access can be properly traced to the owner.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still have no firm idea of how the access could have happened.<br/>\nThere is a possibility that my character screen was simply presented<br/>\nto another use in one of those rare hiccups that computers have<br/>\n&lt;cough&gt; but whether this is repeatable I don&#39;t know.  I haven&#39;t looked<br/>\naround the station much to see if you can obtain a list of user<br/>\nidentities and then try to guess/brute force the password.  But at<br/>\nthis stage, I have changed my password so it is no longer a dictionary<br/>\nword, and I will shortly find a way to change my station ID.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, to me this is a very happy ending to a long week in EQ.  I would<br/>\nlike to publically thank Brother Xave on Mithaniel Marr for his<br/>\nassistance and help in resolving this matter.  I would also like to<br/>\nexpress my deepest thanks to the people who emailed me, and especially<br/>\nthose in the game, who offered me (a total stranger) support and money<br/>\nto help me out without any thoughts of a guaranteed recovery.  Some of<br/>\nmy lost faith in humanity has been restored.  To those that I was able<br/>\nto accept your offer, I am now in a position to more than return the<br/>\nvalue you gave me, and to offer a similar kindness should this happen<br/>\nto you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Mon, 23 Aug 1999 22:02:28 GMT, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:email@...\">email@...</a><br/>\n(Melaniel) wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;The story begins ....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sunday night, after a reasonably successful day my wizard returns to<br/>\n&gt;Freeport, does her bits and pieces in the city and then returns to the<br/>\n&gt;West gate to camp for the night.  Roughly 8pm my time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sometime earlier, my bard has already had a look out, and has camped<br/>\n&gt;at about the same spot in West Freeport.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Monday night .... after a day at work, I return home to log in and<br/>\n&gt;take out my frustrations on the orcs, goblins and other meanies of<br/>\n&gt;Norrath.  I get to the character screen and decide to take the bard<br/>\n&gt;out for a run.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Strange.  The character model is naked except for the lute.  Oh well,<br/>\n&gt;maybe it got corrupted somehow, so I select enter world.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Strange.  I&#39;m standing at the counter in the Freeport bank.  I didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;park here the last time.  Press inventory.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Even stranger.  Where have all my armour and weapons gone?  &lt;insert<br/>\n&gt;growing concern&gt;  Check the bank manager.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Oh dear.  &lt;insert sinking feeling&gt;  Where has all my money gone?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Immediately camp.  Check my other characters on the screen.  Wizard is<br/>\n&gt;also naked.  Other 2 throwaway characters seem to be untouched.  So I<br/>\n&gt;enter the world as my wizard.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Same routine ... I don&#39;t remember camping at the same counter in the<br/>\n&gt;Freeport bank.  Oh look, armour and equipment seems to have<br/>\n&gt;disappeared.  And yes, so has all my money in the bank.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&lt;insert a thump as I can&#39;t sink any lower&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;And then I get to thinking.  Well, no one else has physical access to<br/>\n&gt;my computer, let alone knowledge of my station ID or password.  My CD<br/>\n&gt;is safely locked away, the account key long since forgotten or known<br/>\n&gt;outside of this room.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I certainly did not give away the equipment and money.  And especially<br/>\n&gt;not on both my main characters.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I think for a while and can&#39;t come up with any other reasonable<br/>\n&gt;explanation ....my account has been accessed without my knowledge or<br/>\n&gt;consent, and all my bits and pieces have been &quot;donated&quot; away to<br/>\n&gt;persons unknown.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;At this stage, I phone Verant (or whoever).  Spend a good half hour in<br/>\n&gt;a queue on the customer support only to be told I should have phoned<br/>\n&gt;tech support. &lt;sigh - at least it&#39;s the same the world over&gt;  Phone<br/>\n&gt;tech support .... I should petition and speak to the GM on the server.<br/>\n&gt;Yes I already did the petition thing, no one was on.  So I was<br/>\n&gt;provided with the Mith Marr administrator&#39;s email address, and<br/>\n&gt;promptly sent an email off to him/her.  I also logged in, went round<br/>\n&gt;killing the lowest of the low beasts in an attempt to recover some<br/>\n&gt;money, and then eventually sat in W Freeport and waited.  But it is<br/>\n&gt;time for me to log, and I shall have to seek a solution via email.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;This is simply an information sharing posting, to warn people that it<br/>\n&gt;is possible for such things to happen.  As far as I&#39;m concerned, my<br/>\n&gt;account was compromised, I can see no other explanation for it.  My<br/>\n&gt;only hope is that the logs retained by the administrators will<br/>\n&gt;demonstrate the time my account was accessed, the IP address used, and<br/>\n&gt;hopefully the EQ account key used.  This will at least provide a trace<br/>\n&gt;to the person responsible and &lt;fingers crossed&gt; remove them from the<br/>\n&gt;game.  If I have lost my money and equipment, so be it, my life still<br/>\n&gt;continues, perhaps somewhat disappointed, and certainly demotivated<br/>\n&gt;for tonight at least.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I would welcome any other reasonable suggestions that could explain<br/>\n&gt;what has happened.  People lose equpiment and money to bugs quite a<br/>\n&gt;bit, however having both characters standing at the counter in the<br/>\n&gt;Freeport bank cannot be explained by a bug.  I am simply at a loss to<br/>\n&gt;explain it in any other way than an unauthorised account use.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Anyway, throwing it open to the rather more well-informed crowd ......<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>-- <br/>\n<br/>\nSaldara<br/>\nHigh Elf Wizard (20), Mith Marr server<br/>\n<br/>\nMelaniel<br/>\nWood Elf Bard (11), Mith Marr server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
