If they<br/>\nrespond that I&#39;m being a smartass, I tell them that although I really<br/>\ndislike beggars, I&#39;m very free with any information they might need.

I like to help out people within the<br/>\n&gt;      confines of the game (locate body ect.) but Begging for money is a<br/>\n&gt;      different case altogether.  I always ignore begging but it makes me<br/>\n&gt;      feel guilty anyway. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
