Changing by<br/>\nhow much was unclear.  The spawn was turned on E&#39;ci for a night for some<br/>\nreason as well.<br/>\nWhat Verant failed to predict was so many people reaching such high levels<br/>\nso quickly.  I know that GZ for one did not expect there to be any level<br/>\n50&#39;s before September.  The vast number of high level players has caught<br/>\nVerant totally flat-footed and they are trying to figure out what to do<br/>\nabout it.  They blew it I think when they lowered the xp loss for dying.<br/>\nThey should have increased the xp needed to gain a level at the same time<br/>\ncause all they did was exacerbate their other big problem which was too many<br/>\npeople advancing too quickly.  They also should have realized that most of<br/>\nthe people who were quitting because dying was too painful were going to<br/>\nquit anyhow even when dying became less painful.  Oh well, evolution<br/>\ncontinues, personally the next online game I am looking forward to is<br/>\nNeverwinter Nights, so WE can write the stories.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Kyle Q [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kyleq@...\">kyleq@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, November 19, 1999 8:20 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] OT: Feign Death nerf (long)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Kyle Q&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kyleq@...\">kyleq@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Fri, 19 Nov 1999, Kyle Q wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; All I have to say is perception counts for a lot.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t dispute that.

Slowly advancing people<br/>\n&gt; get screwed while the quickly advancing people the changes are<br/>\n&gt; aimed at are relatively unaffected since they&#39;re already high<br/>\n&gt; level.  *That* is what frustrates me most about this whole<br/>\n&gt; process - it&#39;s regressive in that the lowest levels are nerfed<br/>\n&gt; the most.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What it really boils down to is lack of room for both parties (advanced vs<br/>\nlower lvl). After experiencing the kind of openess that Asherons Call<br/>\nallows, Everquest is really starting to feel like an apartment with 3<br/>\nfamilies living in it. The Kithicor change is a classic example of this.<br/>\nThey took a well used travel corridor and turned it into a death trap so<br/>\nthat high level players wouldn&#39;t have to fight 90 other people for a spot in<br/>\nlower guk. The problem is that since travel is so restrictive (through zone<br/>\npoints) that the younger players don&#39;t have much alternative.<br/>\nEverquest simply cannot expand fast enough to support the players. A new<br/>\ncontinent in March? Oh joy.....we need it now. For the average high level<br/>\nplayer (between lvl 40-50) you can count on one hand the number of zones<br/>\nthat are desirable to go to, and in all of those zones, you are gonna find a<br/>\nlarge number of players already there.<br/>\nMonster boosting would be a better choice than player nerfing, but it<br/>\nrequires more new places to go where the new creatures could be added in,<br/>\nleaving the lower level creatures in tact for the newer players.<br/>\nUnfortunately Verant has already proven to us that this will never happen.<br/>\nThey simply do not have the capability to add on new zones quickly. Since<br/>\nretail release (and correct me if I&#39;m wrong) a grand whopping total of 3<br/>\nzones have been added, two of which are only for extremely high level<br/>\nplayers, and the other is just for quests. 3 zones have been completely<br/>\nrevamped (Kith and Kedge and Perma), but again, revamping takes away from<br/>\nthe younger players and gives to the higher levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nEQ is stagnating because it isn&#39;t growing. Stagnation is slow death.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh well.......here is hoping that the next crop of MMRPG&#39;s (Heroes Journey<br/>\nand Shadowbane) allow for the easy expansion of the world by the game<br/>\ndesigners. Then maybe these problems would have a chance of being solved.<br/>\n<br/>\nDank<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
