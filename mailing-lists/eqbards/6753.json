Dual Wield does increas the amount of damage I can do<br/>\nsignificantly. Once in their 20s Clerics are weak melee players, I just<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t group with a burn and wack cleric, it&#39;s plain silly. In our group<br/>\n(warrior, cleric, bard wizard) until recently it has been the warrior and I<br/>\ntanking, the cleric medding and healing. Now it is the warrior tanking, me<br/>\nsinging AoE damage and getting wacked by mobs and healed by the cleric. The<br/>\nwarrior keeps the mobs off the cleric and the wizard and me if I get in<br/>\ntrouble. My cleric loves me for the down time I releive him of (with the<br/>\nheal song) and I love him for keeping me alive *smiles*<br/>\n<br/>\nTszaaz E&#39;Taurguin</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
