That&#39;s very<br/>\nrare and almost every situation I&#39;ve seen is that when you win a lotto it&#39;s<br/>\nyour property forever to do with what you want.<br/>\n<br/>\nSounds like you are in a great guilds where people work together for the<br/>\ncommon good.  Your lucky - that&#39;s not very common (especially from what I&#39;ve<br/>\nseen on Xegony).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy only concern is the number of instances I&#39;ve seen (and allusions on<br/>\nBackstage and here) of the mentality that the bard never gets any.  I&#39;ve<br/>\nheard (first hand) of pickup raids where after the fact it was stated bards<br/>\nwere ineligible for haste item - and universal acceptance of that.<br/>\n<br/>\nPriority to Warriors for weapons is fine as long as it isn&#39;t a perpetuating<br/>\nthing where Bards NEVER get a chance for a good item.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd once again - maybe it&#39;s different for you - but I&#39;m often in groups<br/>\nwhere there is only bards and rangers meleeing - given that a Ranger&#39;s melee<br/>\nskill is pretty much equal to a Bards - I&#39;d argue that shows the Bard and<br/>\nRanger has as much &quot;Need&quot; as the warrior for the good weapon.  One of the<br/>\nreason I&#39;m meleeing is to keep that Enchanter from getting hit for<br/>\nexample...<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce again - I&#39;m not criticizing Elfson and his guild for what clearly works<br/>\nfor them - just pointing out that IMHO - it&#39;s and exception not the rule.<br/>\nAnd I&#39;ve seen too many cases where bards and simply screwed out of things<br/>\nthey can justify a need for as much as anyone else.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Matt DeBarger [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mattdeba@...\">mattdeba@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, May 08, 2001 1:19 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Guild Loot Rules<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI said in my example that when the warrior got the crscent blade, I was<br/>\ngiven his lammy,  Of course we discovered I can&#39;t wield it, so it went on to<br/>\nanother member.  To be honest I don&#39;t think I should have been given the<br/>\nlammy in any case.  I currently wield Sinoche&#39;s Partisan and Trolloch&#39;s<br/>\nSkien (10/25 5pois, procs a poison based whirl type stun, off hand only).<br/>\nThe Lamentation is equal to the Partisan, and worth 2-3x as much.  And<br/>\ncertainly worth more than an off hand weapon for a class that doesnt melee<br/>\nall the time and doesn&#39;t get double attack.<br/>\n<br/>\nGetting warriors weapons should be a top priority of a guild.  Warriors are<br/>\ncritical for many raids, they tend to live the longest and need to have<br/>\nevery oppurtunity to keep the mob taunted on them.  Behind them fall in all<br/>\nthe other melees, then behind that gaggle bards.<br/>\n<br/>\nObviously everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but I don&#39;t understand<br/>\nwhy bards get upset when weapons are awarded to other classes first...<br/>\n<br/>\nElfson<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
