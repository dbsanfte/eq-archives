There","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1587516247\">We dont have a public explanation of our system (at least to my knowledge)..<br/>\nbut here is the lowdown:<br/>\n<br/>\nWe use CP &quot;Contest Points&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, loot drops.  There is then a 30 second period in which people can<br/>\n&quot;Contest&quot; the loot using their points.  The person with the highest points<br/>\nthat chooses to contest a lotto then can exclude those who have more than 20<br/>\npoints less than him.  Then a lotto is run with those remaining (often only<br/>\n1 or 2) and the winner has 5 points deducted from his total. You are allowed<br/>\n2 contest wins in a month.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf nobody chooses to contest the lotto, then we run a regular lotto.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a dynamic list of &quot;ubermobs&quot; which count for CP points and we earn<br/>\none point for each mob, which can add up to 4 or more a night.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdvantages:  <br/>\nYou don&#39;t lose points for every item.  In some points systems you lose x<br/>\npoints for x item.  This is unfair as some items are &quot;uber&quot; when you first<br/>\nget them and &quot;only ok&quot; when you later win.  Therefore we felt this type of<br/>\nsystem would unfairly punish those who get items later.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike most point systems, this one rewards those who play most (they have the<br/>\nmost chance of amassing enough cp points to exclude others) but doens&#39;t<br/>\npunish those who play less (just takes longer to accumulate cp points)<br/>\n<br/>\nYou don&#39;t HaVE to have points to win. In fact, most of our lottoes are NOT<br/>\ncontested but run as normal.<br/>\n<br/>\nDisadvantages:  <br/>\nSome of our addict level players dont feel it rewards them enough.  <br/>\nPoints in does in no way equal points out<br/>\nSince we get 1 point per mob, if you miss a 4 cp night, it really hurts.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are only in our 3rd month of this system but it seems to work well and<br/>\nhas also cuased a HUGE jump in our attendance. Feel free to email me<br/>\npersonally if you have any questions!<br/>\n<br/>\nHalana, 60th Shammykins<br/>\nTani, 51st Bardette<br/>\n&lt;Paradigm&gt;<br/>\nSolusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Windleaf Mistsong [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:windleaf@...\">windleaf@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, May 07, 2001 3:58 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqbards] Guild Loot Rules<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Does anyone have a url that for a point-based loot-rules <br/>\n&gt; system? My current <br/>\n&gt; guild is going through the &quot;big guild&quot; growing pains.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Current problems are based around things like weighing <br/>\n&gt; whether full-time <br/>\n&gt; should get precedence over part-time players (me being a <br/>\n&gt; part-time player <br/>\n&gt; have my own opinion on this) and whether certain classes <br/>\n&gt; should be excluded <br/>\n&gt; from particular loots (us bards tend to get shunted aside for <br/>\n&gt; the melee <br/>\n&gt; classes as an example).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; For the record, at this time, I believe that people who <br/>\n&gt; participate in more <br/>\n&gt; raids should get a weighted advantage over part-timers, but <br/>\n&gt; not to the <br/>\n&gt; part-timer&#39;s exclusion. As for class exclusions, as a bard <br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s a sensitive <br/>\n&gt; subject to me. I&#39;d prefer no class exclusions myself, just <br/>\n&gt; restrict it to <br/>\n&gt; those who could actually use the item. Another bard in my <br/>\n&gt; guild left when <br/>\n&gt; he ranted about being told he could not roll for a <br/>\n&gt; breastplate somewhere in <br/>\n&gt; Velious.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Obviously a sticky situation. Since I&#39;m on the rules committee for my <br/>\n&gt; guild, I figured I&#39;d find out how other guilds may have tried <br/>\n&gt; to solve <br/>\n&gt; these and other dilemmas. Though, one nice thing is that <br/>\n&gt; there are 3 bards <br/>\n&gt; on the rules committee. :-)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyway, we all feel it&#39;s best to get rules written into stone <br/>\n&gt; that are <br/>\n&gt; approved by a large majority of the guild (3/4th I believe). <br/>\n&gt; All sorts of <br/>\n&gt; problems could be sorted out once we have a set up rules that are not <br/>\n&gt; changed arbitrarily.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ---Windleaf Mistsong<br/>\n&gt; 48th level balladeer<br/>\n&gt; Red Sky<br/>\n&gt; Bertoxxulous<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
