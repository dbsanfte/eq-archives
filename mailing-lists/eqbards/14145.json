Someone followed up that the<br/>\nultravision from the Mask worked fine for them.  Would like to hear from<br/>\nother people who have a Mask of Deception to see if they get ultravision<br/>\nwhen activating the illusion.  Specifically need to know what race you are.<br/>\nIts possible that the ultravision works for humans (who only have normal<br/>\nvision) but may possibly be broken for wood elves and/or half-elves (who<br/>\nhave infravision).  BTW my bard is a wood elf.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis request doesn&#39;t apply to people who have the Guise of the Deceiver.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
