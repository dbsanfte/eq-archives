While there<br/>\nare others here who adamantly disagree with me - IMHO (oops<br/>\nIn-My-Humble-Opinion) Bards are a horrible class to try to solo.  You should<br/>\nbe grouping.  Make some friends group with them.  Once you can have people<br/>\nyou can trust - ask if they will hold your loot for you...<br/>\n<br/>\nAt level 11 - I recall I was in medium-to-large sized group fighting<br/>\nmonsters that were all red to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 11 means you&#39;ve invested a good amount of time - I think it would be a<br/>\ntough to start all over..<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde of Xegony<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: John Buenavides &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jbuenavides@...\">jbuenavides@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Well, anyway, back to the present.  I&#39;m level 11 now, and the only<br/>\n&gt; monsters I can get exp from are those that do incredible amounts of<br/>\n&gt; damage and have bash skills to boot.  I come out at half life with<br/>\n&gt; blues, and blacks can kill me if I don&#39;t kite them around the block a<br/>\n&gt; few times while I heal up.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; One time after getting easily killed by a darkweed, I decided to take<br/>\n&gt; the banded out of cold storage.  Lo and behold.  Darkweed, easy solo.<br/>\n&gt;  Young Kodiak, can&#39;t even hit me enough times before it starts<br/>\n&gt; running away.  I was a happy poacher with two HQ bear pelts, and four<br/>\n&gt; HQ cat pelts.  Granted, I was encumbered at 100 lbs, but when I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; fighting, my two songs give just enough strength not to suffer any<br/>\n&gt; encumberance penalties.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
