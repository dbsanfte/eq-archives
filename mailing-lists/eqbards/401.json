The bard my be the second best soloing class there is. Im 20th<br/>\n&gt; level now and still soloing. You may be playing the bard like a fighter<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; occasional sings a song. Wrong. At 9th level go to Ro. Make sure you got a<br/>\n&gt; full suit of leather. Armor is everything in this game. Get out your handy </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
