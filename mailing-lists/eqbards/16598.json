I am not making any judgements on them, but<br/>\n&gt;I did take the liberty of combining similar ideas and/or taking the most<br/>\n&gt;well written version of an idea and posting that.  I will attribute all<br/>\n&gt;song ideas to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a> unless you explicitly email me<br/>\n&gt;(privately if you want, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gww6e@...\">gww6e@...</a>) to say otherwise.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My comments are marked with a *.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;1. Party Bind<br/>\n&gt;We did not want a bind song if it was identical to casters, however if the<br/>\n&gt;song allowed you to bind anyone anyplace (melees included) then with spell<br/>\n&gt;reagent costs and mana tolls, we would certainly welcome it, especially at<br/>\n&gt;higher (51+) levels since expansion zones are rumored to be mammoth in<br/>\n&gt;scale.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;2. Upgrade to Clouding (was: Party invis vs undead)<br/>\n&gt;An upgrade to Clouding that combined invis, invis vs undead and sneak<br/>\n&gt;(meaning no spell graphic) since this would give us an ability no single<br/>\n&gt;caster can provide (both invis types) and the no spell graphic would be a<br/>\n&gt;boon to +PvP servers.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;3. Upgraded charm.  Everyone and his brother (over 35 responses) wanted<br/>\n&gt;this and hey, I do too. :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;4. Upgrade to clouding.  Nuff said, and I think I summed it up that we&#39;d<br/>\n&gt;like a song that can provide both types of invis.<br/>\n&gt;*duplicated and deprecated by 2, I┬Æm going to remove it. -Tork<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;5. An improved damage shield.  This appears to be drawing interest:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Denon&#39;s Sonic Reflection<br/>\n&gt;Brass<br/>\n&gt;Gives all party members a damage reflection shield.  Causing a portion of<br/>\n&gt;the damage done to them in combat (melee & non-melee) to be reflected back<br/>\n&gt;at the attacker).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;6. An improved AE DoT with added effect (stamina drain being a common<br/>\n&gt;thread, the other was a lifetap affect).  Question at large: do mobs have<br/>\n&gt;stamina and if so, does it impact their ability to fight?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;*More work is needed here. -Tork<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;7. Upgrade to selo&#39;s OR remove hard speed cap.<br/>\n&gt;*I personally want the cap removed vice burning another spell slot on an<br/>\n&gt;upgrade. -Tork<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;8. Upgrade to clarity.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Cassandra&#39;s Clarified Elegy<br/>\n&gt;Provides clarity2 (whatever that might be) + (limited?) elegy effect.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;*Is this warranted? -Tork<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;9. Upgrade to MR debuffing abilities.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Denon&#39;s Fog of War. AE snare. AE slow attack speed. AE Dot. AE magic<br/>\n&gt;debuff (30 pts at least). effect of fog?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;*I like where this is going, anyone want to help fill in the blanks? -Tork<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;10. One-way teleport (self only?  to bard guild?).<br/>\n&gt;*superseded by Call to Arms, number 17.  I will remove this unless there<br/>\n&gt;is debate otherwise. ┬ûTork<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;11. Mem blur song.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Fitful&#39;s Forgetful Improv<br/>\n&gt;Voice<br/>\n&gt;Causes the target to become so fixated on the improv that it forgets<br/>\n&gt;whatever else it was dong.  Drawback: Bard possibly left on hate list.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;*No further discussion on this?  Given how powerful mobs are going to be,<br/>\n&gt;perhaps make it AE and not break mez? -Tork<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;12. Upgraded Atk Song<br/>\n&gt;Since we are out speed buffed by enchanters, a straight addition to Atk<br/>\n&gt;with an added component.  Most commonly heard suggestion: rune type<br/>\n&gt;shielding.  Other suggestions: massive ac bonus, massive regeneration<br/>\n&gt;effect, massive MR buff.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;*Definitely more ideas needed here.  We all know we need and deserve a<br/>\n&gt;song like this and we all know we┬Ære gonna get some VoV upgrade.  Let┬Æs<br/>\n&gt;help steer GZ and company in the right direction. -Tork<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;13. A proc song<br/>\n&gt;The Chromatic Scale<br/>\n&gt;Level: 36th<br/>\n&gt;Skill: Singing<br/>\n&gt;Description: A chromatic scale is all the notes an instrument is capable<br/>\n&gt;of producing, generally played starting from the lowest to the highest and<br/>\n&gt;then back down; slurred up (ligato), tongued down (staccato).  The<br/>\n&gt;Chromatic Scale when song by the bard would act much as the Vampiric<br/>\n&gt;Embrace necro spell in that it imparts a proc to melee attacks however the<br/>\n&gt;twist is that there would be 5 different types which randomly kick off:<br/>\n&gt;magic, fire, cold, disease and poison based attacks. These would be DD&#39;s -<br/>\n&gt;there by filling in our missing DD ability, but in a uniquely bard fashion<br/>\n&gt;(group based, becomes more powerful as you add members and err... randomly<br/>\n&gt;good -- maybe. hehe).  Verant of course would come up with some cute<br/>\n&gt;little chromatic sparkles to surround us and multi colored blasts as the<br/>\n&gt;proc goes off. :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;14. A bard additive song<br/>\n&gt;Cinda&#39;s Companion Cantata<br/>\n&gt;Level: 49th+<br/>\n&gt;Skill: Variable (see below)<br/>\n&gt;Description: A cantata is a composition scored for many parts at once,<br/>\n&gt;incorporating both voice and instrumental accompaniment, hence this song<br/>\n&gt;would allow bards in the same group to ally their voices in song to<br/>\n&gt;intensify the effects of a common song ┬û to &quot;stack&quot; the same song, perhaps<br/>\n&gt;with at 100*(2-((6-n)^(1/6)))% effectiveness, where n is the number of<br/>\n&gt;bards playing cantata. Yes, this could be exceptionally powerful, what<br/>\n&gt;with twisting and all, but this could easily be limited to only effect the<br/>\n&gt;&quot;top&quot; bard song in the spell list of the lead singer, whilst the<br/>\n&gt;&quot;recovery&quot; period of stopping the song would be such that twisting<br/>\n&gt;wouldn&#39;t be possible if you were a cantata player.<br/>\n&gt;Example: A group composed of 1 warrior and 2 bards stops to rest. Bard 1<br/>\n&gt;begins to sing Hymn, only to be joined in song by bard 2 with Cinda&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;Cantata - boosting regeneration by their now intensity music (by the SWAG<br/>\n&gt;formula above that would be a +69%).<br/>\n&gt;Full stacking numbers would be:<br/>\n&gt;n    +%<br/>\n&gt;--------<br/>\n&gt;1    69<br/>\n&gt;2    74<br/>\n&gt;3    80<br/>\n&gt;4    88<br/>\n&gt;5    100<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;*Anyone got any better ideas? -Tork<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;15. Song of Silence<br/>\n&gt;Solon&#39;s Song of Silence<br/>\n&gt;Effect: NON-PARTY: Silence.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;PBAE, fixed radius, 2 tick negate casting.  NPC has one chance to resist<br/>\n&gt;intial and to break free<br/>\n&gt;each tick there after. Lute for enhanced effects. Save versus Magic.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;*I love this idea personally, anyone care to add more?  I want to flesh it<br/>\n&gt;out and will take action if no one objects. -Tork<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;16. Serious upgrade to healing. (NB:  of all the issues brough up, this<br/>\n&gt;needs the most serious analysis btw.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;*Hopefully I┬Æm on the right path with that I have now, but please correct<br/>\n&gt;me if I┬Æm wrong. -Tork<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Currently at 50th with a store bought lute:<br/>\n&gt;Niv┬Æs=15 hp/tick<br/>\n&gt;Hymn=17 hp/tick<br/>\n&gt;Total=roughly 30hp/tick<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Typical mobs encountered at that level hit in low 100┬Æs, double hit 100%<br/>\n&gt;of the time and have an approximate delay of 25.  As a damage per second<br/>\n&gt;figure, that approaches 80 damage/second, 3 seconds/tick, 240 damage/tick.<br/>\n&gt; Regeneration factor: 12.5%.<br/>\n&gt;Scaling to 60th,<br/>\n&gt;Niv┬Æs=22 hp/tick<br/>\n&gt;Hymn=22 hp/tick<br/>\n&gt;Total=roughly 44 hp/tick<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;To maintain this balance, a typical L60 encounter mob can have a damage<br/>\n&gt;per second output of 352, 117 damage/sec, or assuming a similar delay of<br/>\n&gt;25 and double hitting 100% of the time, a per blow damage of 146.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;We know this not to be the case as plane of sky ┬ôyard trash┬ö easily<br/>\n&gt;eclipses this figure.  Therefore, we are in need of an upgrade to healing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;17. Melanie┬Æs Call to Arms<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;*I removed the nix hate list bit as per some very valid points brought up.<br/>\n&gt;-Tork<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Trying to come up with a song that is<br/>\n&gt;1) extremely powerful<br/>\n&gt;2) no other class has<br/>\n&gt;3) makes bards extremely wanted on raids (a la enchanters)<br/>\n&gt;4) and has coding already built into the game<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I came up with a song that is the opposite of Melanie&#39;s Mellifluous<br/>\n&gt;Motion. A song that teleports all party members in the zone to the bards<br/>\n&gt;location.<br/>\n&gt;Name: Melanie&#39;s Call to Arms<br/>\n&gt;This song would be extremely useful in conjunction with a binding group<br/>\n&gt;leader. Imagine doing an Efreeti Raid in SolB and wanting to bring in<br/>\n&gt;other members since some need to leave. Instead of breaking through again<br/>\n&gt;the group leader would be bound at zoneline, group up the bard and gate<br/>\n&gt;back to his bindpoint. The group leader would then group up the 4 new<br/>\n&gt;members and the song would be sung and would teleport everyone back to the<br/>\n&gt;bard. There are a few problems with this that may make it too powerful.<br/>\n&gt;Such as Plane of Sky (never been myself) where this song could not be used<br/>\n&gt;to bypass the teleporters etc  This song combined with Selo&#39;s would make<br/>\n&gt;the bard extremely wanted in any group, but especially raids. The song may<br/>\n&gt;need to use up mana, although I really don&#39;t want all our songs using up<br/>\n&gt;mana.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;18. Group damage dispersion/distribution<br/>\n&gt;Name: Song of Solidarity *New name suggestions anyone? -Tork<br/>\n&gt;Function: Whenever a member of the party takes damage, that damage it<br/>\n&gt;distributed among the party members.<br/>\n&gt;For example, a 5 person party: The warrior gets hit for 75 (make this<br/>\n&gt;simple *Smiles*) points of damage. The warrior actually gets hit for 15<br/>\n&gt;points, and all other party members get hit for 15 points of non-melee<br/>\n&gt;damage. Very hard to code (probably a lot of logic changes,) but something<br/>\n&gt;different which would augment the Bard&#39;s ability to lessen party downtime.<br/>\n&gt;(Maybe.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;19. On mana regeneration and putting ┬ôno mana┬ö into perspective, by John<br/>\n&gt;H. Kim ;)<br/>\n&gt;Just to clarify what it means to &quot;buff without exceeding your mana regen<br/>\n&gt;rate...&quot;<br/>\n&gt;Say each buff costs you one bubble. Say each buff lasts 60 minutes. Say<br/>\n&gt;you meditate back one bubble a minute. That means you can keep a maximum<br/>\n&gt;of 60 buffs up.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;How many buffs you can cast going from FM to OOM is pretty irrelevant<br/>\n&gt;since buffing is almost always done during downtime. What matters is how<br/>\n&gt;many buffs your mana regeneration rate allows you to maintain.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;This is the type of analysis Verant failed to do (and is failing to do)<br/>\n&gt;every time they go off on one of their &quot;but bards use no mana!&quot; tangents.<br/>\n&gt;No we don&#39;t use mana, but because of the short lifespan of our songs and<br/>\n&gt;the (relatively) long &quot;casting time&quot; for our songs, it&#39;s pretty much the<br/>\n&gt;same thing as using mana. In fact, you can think of our songs as spells<br/>\n&gt;that last 12 seconds, require 5 bubbles of mana to cast, and our mana<br/>\n&gt;regen rate gives us back 5 bubbles every 3 seconds.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;20. Upgraded mez capabilities.<br/>\n&gt;*I┬Æm at a loss here, given that our existing mez song is hopelessly broken<br/>\n&gt;how can I hope for an upgraded one?  At any rate, ideas and suggestions or<br/>\n&gt;just some one logically and polietly stating the facts surrounding Lullaby<br/>\n&gt;would be very helpful.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;21. What┬Æd I forget? :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;*Okay, this format looks like crap, but comments none the less.  I will<br/>\n&gt;reformat tonight and get it in a revision 0 status for release tomorrow to<br/>\n&gt;the list.  Man, this is been a lot of work, but I mean that in the best<br/>\n&gt;possible way!  Hopefully by Thursday morning we can have it polished up.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks,<br/>\n&gt;-Tork@Nameless<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;__________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt;Talk to your friends online with Yahoo!
