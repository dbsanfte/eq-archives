And I posted a reply on the Sony board.  And I<br/>\n&gt; tried not to whine TOO much.  But I sure do hate killing my friends :(.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I love playing my bard.  I have played her almost exclusively for the last 18<br/>\n&gt; months and I still have a lot of fun.  The bard class suits me and I have had<br/>\n&gt; some amazing times when everything went right and I saved my group.  But it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; getting harder and harder to do that hehe.  Still, I am not going to give up.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That said, I got this mental image that I wanted to share here (and I am going<br/>\n&gt; to date myself here)...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You are watching TV late at night, or bowling on Sunday afternoon maybe, and a<br/>\n&gt; commercial comes on for (drumroll please...) the Ronco Fish-O-Matic!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Folks, this is 68 fishing tools in one!  You can leave that heavy, extra box<br/>\n&gt; full of tools at home, just slip one of these beauties in your tackle box and<br/>\n&gt; you are set!  It&#39;s shiny!  It looks great!  Be the envy of your friends!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So you buy one and head out on your first fishing trip.  And guess what?  It<br/>\n&gt; sorta works.  It almost does what they said.  You have to put extra effort into<br/>\n&gt; everything, and you have to be really careful because it isn&#39; very sturdy and<br/>\n&gt; you might break it.  And even when you are careful from time to time it just<br/>\n&gt; snaps and you get a nasty cut.  But it isn&#39;t JUNK exactly....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You getting where I am going with this?  LOL that&#39;s right - bards are the EQ<br/>\n&gt; equivalent of the all-in-one Fish-O-Matic.  We do work OK much of the time, but<br/>\n&gt; ya gotta be really careful.  And if you can afford to haul the real thing,<br/>\n&gt; you&#39;d be better off.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; With a wry smile and a jaunty salute,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Maravana Vireo<br/>\n&gt; 54 Bard of Jus Divinum<br/>\n&gt; Mithaniel Marr<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
