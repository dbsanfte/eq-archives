I&#39;ve been a lurker here for a long time and a bard even longer<br/>\n&gt; (since June 6th 1999).  The folks on this list are great!  I haven&#39;t yet<br/>\n&gt; contributed since I&#39;m fairly low level but I feel I have a good<br/>\nappreciation<br/>\n&gt; of your situation so I&#39;m posting now. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks, I&#39;m not the sort of player that wants to get parties killed because<br/>\nI don&#39;t understand my class.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;     There seem to be three general types of bards I&#39;ve met in my travels;<br/>\n&gt; bards who  sing (twist/weave/other word of your choice), bards who melee,<br/>\n&gt; bards who think they can melee.  With normal armour and weapons, bards<br/>\nseem<br/>\n&gt; naturally to choose either the first or second path.  Most twinks I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; encountered become the third kind of bard and don&#39;t appreciate what it is<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; be a bard until it&#39;s too late.  It seems that you can either play a bard<br/>\nas<br/>\n&gt; a poor melee class, or as a good bard (using melee or song as the<br/>\nsituation<br/>\n&gt; warrants.)<br/>\n<br/>\nYea, I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m going to be #3, so far I have nearly 40 days with my<br/>\nranger (about .5 with a necro, I just can&#39;t play EVIL). I realize that my<br/>\nmelee skills aren&#39;t at my ranger&#39;s level and certainly nowhere near a<br/>\nwarrior. I use the songs and even twist them to some extent.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;     The key to playing a bard (at least at the lower levels) is to<br/>\n&gt; understand the capabilities of your songs and apply the right ones, with<br/>\n&gt; instruments or without, in the appropriate situation.  Silly Songsinger<br/>\nhas<br/>\n&gt; provided links to excellent information about songs so I won&#39;t repeat<br/>\n(much)<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, as soon as I started Reed I went to the bard sites I could find to<br/>\ndiscover all the aspects of the songs. I was excited at 6th level thinking<br/>\nI&#39;d be gold to a group ... and didn&#39;t get anyone interested &lt;shrug&gt;. Then I<br/>\nget to 12th and get into some throne room activity in Crush and the people<br/>\nI&#39;m grouped with didn&#39;t get that my songs are a huge taunt. I died but at<br/>\nleast I could run quickly back to recover my corpse.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; of it.  Let me instead explain a few of the combinations I have used.<br/>\nThese<br/>\n&gt; tactics worked well even though I have low stamina (67) and low strength<br/>\n&gt; (70.)  I was equipped in full leather and had a combine scimitar which I<br/>\n&gt; then upgraded to a Dragoon dirk and some banded by 15. (Actually, I&#39;m<br/>\nstill<br/>\n&gt; in mostly banded and some special armour that I&#39;ve picked up over the<br/>\nmonths<br/>\n&gt; and still wielding my trusty Dragoon dirk.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m a little heavy with some bronze, my ranger picked it up when I was in<br/>\nHighkeep and I couldn&#39;t sell it so I&#39;m using it. I&#39;m overequiped for my<br/>\nlevel having received some help from my higher level character. I have the<br/>\nlambent sleeves, the bard paid for the gems but of course he couldn&#39;t hope<br/>\nto get the rune or the firey vambraces.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Soloing:<br/>\n&gt; Solo strategy #1:<br/>\n&gt;     Try to pick creatures that don&#39;t bash. When I had more experience, I<br/>\n<br/>\nYea, orcs stop my songs A LOT!<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; soloed the two gnoll guardsman in blackburrow near the door to the spike<br/>\n&gt; room but I had mostly perfected twisting by then.  I wouldn&#39;t recommend<br/>\nyou<br/>\n&gt; start there because they bash and if you&#39;re not careful, you can hit other<br/>\n&gt; gnolls through the walls with your CoD and start really bad trains.  Learn<br/>\n&gt; twisting somewhere safer first. You can practice this strategy fairly<br/>\nsafely<br/>\n&gt; out in the Karanas on silvermist wolves and switch to gnoll reavers when<br/>\nyou<br/>\n&gt; are a little better at it. (Stay in a zoomed out view so you can keep your<br/>\n&gt; eye on anything nearby)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been wary of AoE songs for this very reason. Standard newbie mistake,<br/>\neven pre-warned, I ran to a guard in Kelethin from the newbie area with the<br/>\nlevel 2 AoE on ... dead bard in an instant.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Solo strategy #3:<br/>\n&gt;     Find a single creature (or make a camp into a single creature with<br/>\n&gt; Kelin&#39;s Lugubrious Lament) then equip your weapons.  I had a Dragoon Dirk<br/>\n&gt; and a Shiny Brass Shield (SBS) until I got dual wield.  Start up Anthem<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; HoR then pull the creature with Bellow.  Keep twisting those three<br/>\n&gt; throughout the fight.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a question I haven&#39;t seen the answer of, can you use dual wield to<br/>\nequip a weapon and a instrument?<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Grouping:<br/>\n&gt;     Bards are best at grouping.  Try to avoid any group that considers you<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; melee class since you will be limited to being a poor tank.  There are<br/>\nmany<br/>\n&gt; great combinations you can use depending upon the members of your group,<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; type of creatures you are fighting and the type of pull you get (solo,<br/>\n&gt; multiples.)  Generally, I used the following:<br/>\n<br/>\nGrouping I get, I&#39;ve got to sell myself better to get in a group.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Your group against casters:<br/>\n&gt;     This one is best at level 18.  Equip the drum and play Guardian<br/>\n&gt; Rhythms(GR), Elemental Rhythms(ER) or Purifying Rhythms(PR), Anthem de<br/>\nArms<br/>\n&gt; (to help the tanks take down the caster quickly.)  Below 18, I usually<br/>\n&gt; equipped a drum and played ER/PR, HoR, Anthem.  A completely different<br/>\n&gt; strategy is to use Kelin&#39;s Lucid Lullaby (Lullaby) with a lute if you can<br/>\n&gt; take a few blasts and the caster is significantly lower level (eg. low<br/>\nblue,<br/>\n&gt; or green.)  It&#39;s a fast ticket to your bind point otherwise.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo we know if Lullaby clears the hate list except for the bard? I keep<br/>\nhearing it&#39;s changed.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Your group against high con solo creature:<br/>\n&gt;     Generally, your damage songs won&#39;t affect them much so stick to<br/>\nbuffing<br/>\n&gt; the tanks as much as possible.  Usually I equip a drum and use Anthem,<br/>\nHoR,<br/>\n&gt; and throw in ER for some AC buffing then later in the fight switch to the<br/>\n&gt; lute for faster healing. The extra AC from ER is only a few points but it<br/>\n&gt; can make the difference between the tanks getting hit for max damage a lot<br/>\n&gt; vs getting hit for max less often and partial damage more often and will<br/>\n&gt; generally save downtime more than trying to get a bellow or CoD to stick<br/>\n&gt; while maintaining Anthem (the most important.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis makes sense, in a group situation the last thing I want to do is waste<br/>\ntime with a AoE or DD when I can buff the entire party. I&#39;m happy to say I<br/>\nknew this one without being told. Seems like a good plan.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure how any of these strategies will change as I get to the<br/>\nhigher<br/>\n&gt; levels but for now, they seem to be good, at least to level 20. Thanks to<br/>\n&gt; everyone on eqbards for a lot of the ideas and strategies and sorry for<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; long post!<br/>\n<br/>\nExcellent information, thank you. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
