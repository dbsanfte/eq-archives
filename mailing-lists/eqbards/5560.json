When I logged in tonight<br/>\nthe guy showed up a couple of hours later looking for his corpse.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was less tired and feeling a bit more magnanimous so I helped him swim to<br/>\nthe zone and go deep-sea diving for his corpse.  Still without Aquatic Ayre,<br/>\neven though I&#39;ve hit 16th (haven&#39;t bought the song from High Keep yet).  Well<br/>\nit worked.  The guy had a set of leather, a few coins and a Bloodforge Hammer.<br/>\nBut it meant a lot to him.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, it worked out and I feel a bit better about myself and boosted the<br/>\nreputation of bards in general I hope.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe guy said &quot;thx&quot;, disbanded and ran off.  That&#39;s gratitude for ya...<br/>\n<br/>\nCrier - 16 song on Fennin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\nJason A.

Believe<br/>\n&gt; me<br/>\n&gt; I wished him well, but I couldn&#39;t put my character in that potentially<br/>\n&gt; disarterous position.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; How would others have handled this situation?  Given it&#39;s midnight, and you<br/>\n&gt; plan on logging within an hour or so and there&#39;s no bank on the island.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That happened to a guild member and good friend of mine.  We both agreed<br/>\n&gt; that it was ridiculous to try to swim all the way to the zone.  He<br/>\n&gt; /petitioned and explained that he was killed on the boat and the corpse was<br/>\n&gt; dumped when the boat zoned.  The guide kindly summoned his corpse for him,<br/>\n&gt; since it was where it was through no fault of his own.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Paralto of Povar<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Transfer your big list to ONElist and earn $500!<br/>\n&gt; For program details, go to<br/>\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/biglist1\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/biglist1</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
