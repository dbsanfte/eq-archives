I am sick of seeing posts (mainly on eqcasters) of<br/>\npeople only seeing the things that upset them and not the other side.  To me<br/>\nyour post seemed like you did not see the point of tuning them down.  Again,<br/>\nI apologize, I must have missed that in your post.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as Verant history.  What other choice do you have but to trust that<br/>\nthey will do what they say?  Not much other than quit.  I understand not<br/>\nliking the update, but some poeple get *SO* mad, it scares me.  This is a<br/>\ngame, nothing more.<br/>\n<br/>\nI for one, would rather play a slightly &quot;nerfed&quot; EQ, then no EQ at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still think the BP is overpowered the way it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou need to think of what is realistic for the genre not of what would be<br/>\nneat.  I wish my druid had a 1200 point DD, just like wizards wish they<br/>\ncould cast SOW.  Melee wish they could bind/gate.  But those don&#39;t make<br/>\nsense.  Neither does such a breastplate.  At least not to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am sorry, if offended anyone.  It was not my intent, just expressing my<br/>\nviews.<br/>\n<br/>\nNotebender<br/>\n9th Bard of Veeshan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
