The only multipliers in this game are bards<br/>\n(group effects), Clarity, and stat buffs (which have minimal<br/>\neffect).  Everything else is addative.  If a necro can solo a<br/>\nmob that otherwise requires a group of 2+, making him group<br/>\nwith someone to do it cannot suddenly make him impotent.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
