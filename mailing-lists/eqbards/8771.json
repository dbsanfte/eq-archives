Getting one instead of a combine (if<br/>\nyou can afford it) means you won&#39;t need to upgrade until you<br/>\nreach around level 30.  If you can stand the stamina loss from<br/>\nusing it.  I should note that a dragoon dirk has an even<br/>\nbetter damage/delay ratio than a BLW, and won&#39;t chew up your<br/>\nstamina.  You&#39;re better off putting the dirk in your primary.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 3) Do I have a chance at skipping it and camping for a PGT before 20?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Depends on the jerk ratio on your server.  On Karana it&#39;s<br/>\nseemingly forever camped by kill stealers and casters who<br/>\ncan&#39;t use it (hint - write down their names, and never group<br/>\nwith them once you get the mana song).
