I know for a fact that I&#39;ve been in<br/>\n  the Lord room waiting around for 45 mins on a crowded night in<br/>\n  Lguk with 80 people in the zone.  I know this has happened to <br/>\n  others just by listening to the ooc/shout &#39;Geez, when is X gonna<br/>\n  spawn already, it&#39;s been like 50 mins&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\n  My mask dropped on the 5th spawn after 4 placeholders.  The assassin<br/>\n  took his sweet time too, as we were about to leave since it was <br/>\n  clear he wasn&#39;t spawning on time - (had to wait an extra 5 mins from<br/>\n  the normal timings I was doing) he decided to show up.<br/>\n<br/>\n  If everything is running smoothly, then all things should respawn<br/>\n  on time.  If they aren&#39;t then you will know right away.  Everytime<br/>\n  I see the number 34 posted here, I think about all those people<br/>\n  wondering where the hell X spawn is after it&#39;s 34.0 mins are up.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Plus my guess is this is all running on a non-Unix solution, and<br/>\n  I&#39;ve never known NT to be that good at anything ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
