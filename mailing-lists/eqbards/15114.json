When looking at 3 messages stating delays, they post it as<br/>\n&gt; &quot;progressing as planned&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have a few problems with this.<br/>\n&gt; 1.  This the second time in 2 weeks they changed the date on a major<br/>\n&gt; scheduled downtime.  My bother scheduling downtime, if you;re not going<br/>\n&gt; to keep it?  My cleric group plays once a week (and is the main reason I<br/>\n&gt; play EQ, I love my bard, but I think i would leave the game if I didn;t<br/>\n&gt; have my regular cleric group).  We make sure our day does not coincide<br/>\n&gt; with their scheduled downtime since we face such time constraints<br/>\n&gt; (normally play from 5ish to 11ish). The rest of the group was able to<br/>\n&gt; get in around 7, so our time this week was cut by 1/3, despite our best<br/>\n&gt; efforts.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 2.  Why aren&#39;t these downtimes scheduled about 3-5 horus earlier, when<br/>\n&gt; there are many less paying customers trying to play?  I feel bad for the<br/>\n&gt; people in Europe in Asia, but America represents the majority of their<br/>\n&gt; customer base.  I would even be happier if they would rotate down times<br/>\n&gt; so different people were affected each time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 3.  How much time was wasted writing the True North spell.  I&#39;m sure we<br/>\n&gt; could all name about 20 things which everyone in the game would rather<br/>\n&gt; have seen that time spent fixing.  Has anyone thought of a use for this?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 4.  How do things which directly contradict the patch messages make it<br/>\n&gt; past their &quot;extensive testing?&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; {rant mode off}<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; We now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Matt DeBarger<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; GET A NEXTCARD VISA, in 30 seconds.
