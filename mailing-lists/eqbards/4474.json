Reasons why:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. I&#39;m actually able to play alongside my husband... where before we were<br/>\njust playing on one computer (we got a cable modem, two ip&#39;s, and a second<br/>\neq for my new computer).<br/>\n<br/>\n2. higher level players have given me things... out of the blue, which was<br/>\nunexpectedly wonderful AND extremely helpful. I, in turn, have tried to help<br/>\nothers with &quot;hand-me-down&quot; armor, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. people tend to love bards.... to quote someone, &quot;... bards rock!&quot; And we<br/>\nreally do!! This is the most versatile class I&#39;ve played so far, and, I<br/>\nthink, fairly easy to play. I especially love that songs can be weaved in<br/>\nmany manners.... variations on a theme, as it were :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI also agree with the post about the &quot;bagpipes&quot; thing. THAT would be fun -<br/>\nAND funny!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Do you think bards will play an interesting role on the new racewar server?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I really have no idea as I&#39;m not, at the point in time, planning on playing<br/>\non the racewar server.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrangwen, L10 wood elf bard, The Rathe<br/>\n(almost L11 [!!]....who died 5 zones away from her bind point last night<br/>\nnear a bandit camp she had no business being near..... AND whose wonderful<br/>\ndruid husband was still there, and went all &quot;invisible-like&quot;, looted her<br/>\ncorpse and then gated back - whew!!!!!!!) hehehe</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
