We agreed to group up for CR.  Three others <br/>\n&gt; &gt; joined us and I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; got my corpse back first (it was right by the zone).  As I <br/>\n&gt; &gt; was donning my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; patchwork one of the other naked barbs began fretting that <br/>\n&gt; &gt; someone whom he&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; &gt; just consented to drag his corpse was no longer on line and <br/>\n&gt; &gt; that he thinks<br/>\n&gt; &gt; all his banded has been stolen.  I finish looting and we head <br/>\n&gt; &gt; in for the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; other two corpses.  The fretting barb then tells the group they died<br/>\n&gt; &gt; somewhere underwater after falling down the tree.  &quot;Let&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; &gt; go!&quot; they say and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; start heading for the tree.  I don&#39;t know Blackburrow THAT <br/>\n&gt; &gt; well so I ask if<br/>\n&gt; &gt; anyone knows the way out once we&#39;re down there.  A druid in <br/>\n&gt; &gt; the group says<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Gate&quot;.  Great, except two of our party are warriors.  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Suddenly someone<br/>\n&gt; &gt; shouts &quot;Train!&quot; and I and one of the warriors groupsay <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Zone&quot;.  The two of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; us zoned, then got an earful from the druid and fretting barb <br/>\n&gt; &gt; who jumped<br/>\n&gt; &gt; down the tree alone, and from the other naked barb and our <br/>\n&gt; &gt; sixth member who,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; not knowing who to follow, stood around and got killed by the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; train.  We<br/>\n&gt; &gt; zoned back in and I waited for & watched over the two who <br/>\n&gt; &gt; died by train as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; they loot there corpses.  The fretting barb by this time had <br/>\n&gt; &gt; realized his<br/>\n&gt; &gt; worst fears - he&#39;d been robbed completely.  Someone suggested <br/>\n&gt; &gt; petitioning it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; but he didn&#39;t remember the name of the person he consented.  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I buffed up the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; four party members still on the upper level, said farewell <br/>\n&gt; &gt; and camped.  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Peace<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Evulia the bard<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Jesuwai the shaman<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: Bill Costlow [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:atlatyl@...\">atlatyl@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Wednesday, July 19, 2000 11:33 AM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [eqbards] The Group from Hell<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- &quot;Cranfill, Wendy&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Wendy_Cranfill@...\">Wendy_Cranfill@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But i guess after reading<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the &quot;bad mage&quot; thread, just wanted to point out that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; its never a bad class,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; its almost always bad players.  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sooo True.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Last week I joined a pickup group in Dalnirs.  We did<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pretty well in the Temple room so somebody suggested<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; we go down to lvl 2.  As we all landed in the pool of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; water, sombody got excited and pulled a nice train<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; into the room before we got set up.  THings got bad<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and somebody said gate -- The monk and I were left to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; die.  Funny thing, all four casters in the group had<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to log at that point ... <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 7 deaths (6 during corpse recovery) at lvl 30 sure can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ruin your night. sigh<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Get Yahoo!
