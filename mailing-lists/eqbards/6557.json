However, i do feel the need to point out<br/>\nthat you need to be careful about using a Pumice stone against another player. <br/>\nThis action does fall under the clause in the rules about circumventing the PVP<br/>\nrules to cause harm to another player (much like casting sow on a bard !!) and<br/>\nis therefore a bannable offense.<br/>\n<br/>\n-------------the following is equipment related, and therefore OT------------<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat does everyone think about all the changes from monday&#39;s patch that were<br/>\nreversed yesterday? (Box of abu ja&#39;far [sorry, cannot resist : )], Hero Bracer<br/>\netc.)  Personally, i think the Lustrous Russet armor SHOULD BE warrior only,<br/>\nbut they should have made it so instantly when they discovered the error.<br/>\n<br/>\none last thing....Allakhazam&#39;s reported the Hero Bracer (I believe someone on<br/>\nthe list (Minkin?) called it a Mino Bracer) to be a quest item....does anyone<br/>\nhave any idea what quest that is?  i am not necessarily looking for a complete<br/>\ndescription, but if anyone knows the starting point, please let me know (maybe<br/>\ni can help you find something you&#39;re looking for in return : ) )<br/>\n<br/>\nFeel free to e-mail directly to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nKaleid<br/>\n18th Song<br/>\nPrexus <br/>\n===<br/>\n&quot;Thou shall not kill. Thou shall not commit<br/>\nadultery. Don&#39;t eat pork.&quot; <br/>\nI&#39;m sorry, what was that last one?  Don&#39;t eat pork?  God has spoken. Is that the word of God or is that pigs trying to out smart everybody?&quot;<br/>\n-- Jon Stewart<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nBid and sell for free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://auctions.yahoo.com\">http://auctions.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
