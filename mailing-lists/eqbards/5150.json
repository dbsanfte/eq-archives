Luckily this was a non-combat situtation and it just<br/>\n&gt;made the rest of my group ridicule me, but hey when you strum a drumstick<br/>\n&gt;you get used to that sort of thing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Bernwyn<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;ONElist:  the best place to EXPLORE topics, SHARE ideas, and<br/>\n&gt;CONNECT to people with the same interests.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
