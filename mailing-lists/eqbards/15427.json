Spent<br/>\nfour hours in Sol A last night in a party and killed a ton of blue goblins.<br/>\nI got maybe 3/4 bar of EXP.  The camp was safe but actually pretty boring.<br/>\nI&#39;m willing to take a risk soloing if it will help me get out of 35th.   I&#39;m<br/>\nthinking about the only place for me to solo at 35 is Rathe Mtns charming<br/>\ngiants against one another.  Anyone got a better suggestion.  Would it just<br/>\nbe better to join a group in one of the dungeons or kill ogre bouncers?<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
