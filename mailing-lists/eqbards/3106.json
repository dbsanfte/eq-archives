It is both difficult for<br/>\nyou escape without looking like the villian.  Whenever I feel the need to<br/>\nleave a group that I dislike after they have ignored my comments for<br/>\nimproving theoverall nature of the group, I usually tell them that a guild<br/>\nmember or friend is in need of some help.  To leave on a good note I only<br/>\nleave when they are in a good condition, fully healed are ready to fight.<br/>\nAnd to leave them with a good impression of me I will usually wish them<br/>\nluck.  A good number of these bad party members will improve and<br/>\neventually learn to play in a group, so it is best not to provoke them who<br/>\nknows when they might save you in the future. =)<br/>\n<br/>\nTreilanin Bard of Kelethin<br/>\nAariel Bard of Kelethin<br/>\nKarana Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
