It was camped by Fubarrh, Bolenie Sandwich, and Ironhide.<br/>\nIt was unbelievable.  They were willing to let me get some greaves if they<br/>\ngot em, but their tactics were below questionable and we all watched as some<br/>\nfool shaman tried to solo the ice giant diplomat.  Worst thing was, it RAN<br/>\nfrom him.  Right over me, I went right between its legs.  Needless to say<br/>\nwhen it came back down the ramp it bought about 20 gobs with it killing<br/>\nmany, except the castes of course who simply gated.  Didn&#39;t someone once<br/>\nclaim they were so frail they&#39;d always be the first to go.  The melee types<br/>\nhad zero chance of escape and the caster&#39;s had zero chance of death.  And<br/>\nthey said Selo&#39;s was unbalancing in allowing train avoidance indoors?  Yeah,<br/>\nright.  How fast travel can be unbalancing but instantaneous travelling is<br/>\nnot I fail to see.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Ryan Honeyman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:honeyman@...\">honeyman@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, November 29, 1999 2:09 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Great post on item balancing (Long)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Ryan Honeyman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:honeyman@...\">honeyman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; isn&#39;t possible at my level.
