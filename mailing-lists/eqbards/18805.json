Although I get an enduring breath <br/>\n&gt; whenever doing<br/>\n&gt; underwater fighting if this song effect drops you still have <br/>\n&gt; your whole<br/>\n&gt; breath bar to go through before you start drowning so even <br/>\n&gt; accounting for a<br/>\n&gt; normal number of mixed notes you could do your 3 song <br/>\n&gt; rotation and mix this<br/>\n&gt; one in as the third song every second time and you&#39;d be fine. <br/>\n&gt;  It worked<br/>\n&gt; once for me on a corpse recovery, but I do get enduring <br/>\n&gt; breath because its a<br/>\n&gt; little too high stress for me. :) </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
