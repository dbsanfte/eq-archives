If the puller was fetching from nearby rooms and<br/>\nbringing in wizzie frogs then having ER and using ER and Pixie (to<br/>\ninterrupt) on the wizzies in any cycles where you didn&#39;t need the pulse to<br/>\ndo CC was well recieved by ass/sup groups.  Of course, you&#39;d only want that<br/>\non the pulls with wizzie frogs.  If not with everyone else having mana to<br/>\nslow/haste etc .. yes .. you&#39;re mix would have been close to what I would<br/>\nhave picked.  Unless the puller was always bringing singles, then I dropped<br/>\none of the CC songs for a chant.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne time in ass/sup I ended up with all tanks & rogues .. yep was only CC<br/>\nand only healer for a time.  And they pulled multiples including wizzie<br/>\nfrogs.  Oooo my fingers got tired!   Tho the core of the group was very<br/>\ncomfortable with me doing the CC, and I begged healers in tells until I got<br/>\none to come before my fingers just fell off. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nMenuette<br/>\nalso known as &quot;Ribbit?&quot; to a few ...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chris.holden@...\">chris.holden@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, February 08, 2001 9:42 AM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Song Selection Advice for a Level 35 Singer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hello all,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Last night I was in the Assassin/Supplier in Lower Guk for the first time.<br/>\nHad<br/>\n&gt; myself (35 Bard), 44 Paladin, 46 Shaman, 44 Rouge, and 51 Warrior.  I was<br/>\nhaving<br/>\n&gt; trouble selecting which songs to use.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The Shaman was speeding and Primary healer. I was there for Crowd Control<br/>\n(I had<br/>\n&gt; an easy time with and blues and Zols which are low Red but hard time with<br/>\nWan&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; that were Yellow), Manasong, Snaring and ?.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My 3 Song weave was Cantana (34), Snare (23) and Chant of Battle or Damage<br/>\n&gt; Shield. After a while the Shaman got enough mana back after buffing to<br/>\n&gt; slow/speed etc.  So I switched to Chant of Battle primarily.  During<br/>\ndowntime I<br/>\n&gt; did straight mana and depending on our condition would weave Cantana in as<br/>\nwell.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What other suggestions for Song Selection do you guys/gals have? I also<br/>\nhad<br/>\n&gt; Pixie, Charm, Heal song, Manasong, and Area Fear mem&#39;ed. At level 35 what<br/>\nelse<br/>\n&gt; could I have done? I know I could have used Elemental Rhythms (MR/FR/CR)<br/>\nor even<br/>\n&gt; Gaurdian Rhythms (MR). Any other suggestions?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks for any suggestions and help.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -Ranian<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
