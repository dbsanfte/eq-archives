Sure enough the floor<br/>\n&gt; was<br/>\n&gt; littered with the corpses of dead players, but no dead Shin Knight<br/>\n&gt; corpses.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am a patient bard, as well as one that was invis and feeling quite safe,<br/>\n&gt; so I sat down and waited for the dreaded trains to come bringing piles of<br/>\n&gt; loot.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes... hmmm no trains.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; At that point I got up and walked down to where the north-south hall<br/>\n&gt; starts.. &quot;Ah a dead froggie!&quot; I loot and get some gold, but nothing else.<br/>\n&gt; While I am looting another Shin Knight spawns and takes no notice of me<br/>\n&gt; while I am invis or visible. I tell a friend who is familiar with Guk<br/>\n&gt; asking<br/>\n&gt; him if I am indeed in the right spot and if people really do train stuff<br/>\n&gt; here. He confirms on both issues, so I head back to zone border and wait.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes... hmmm no trains.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I do a &quot;/who&quot; and see that indeed there are many people here, over 60 at<br/>\n&gt; that point. I also realize that I am the only player here under level 30.<br/>\n&gt; A<br/>\n&gt; small shiver overtakes me.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I start to wander down to the north-south hall again, two Shin Knights are<br/>\n&gt; now there but no one is taking them on. I decide to head south towards the<br/>\n&gt; river/stream to see if anyone has left something down there. I turn the<br/>\n&gt; first corner to start heading east/south east when I see a dead froggie.<br/>\n&gt; At<br/>\n&gt; first he does nothing to me, so I &quot;/con&quot; him and it says he&#39;s ready to<br/>\n&gt; attack, and to boot he&#39;s close enough. Just then as I am thinking how<br/>\n&gt; fortunate I am that he&#39;s ignored me, &quot;BAM!&quot; he hits, no too hard, but<br/>\n&gt; since<br/>\n&gt; he was dark red to me I make my dash back and zone. I also decide once I<br/>\n&gt; have zoned that maybe I will come back another time and head back to<br/>\n&gt; Freeport.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So my question is, did I just hit Lower Guk on a bad night, or do I just<br/>\n&gt; need to be more patient? This being a vulture stuff is hard :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Bernwyn Ablesong<br/>\n&gt; Mith Marr<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;James Schuldes&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, December 01, 1999 11:10 AM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] Shin Gauntlets and Greaves<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: James Schuldes &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Yes, I guess that they are &quot;live&quot; froggies - but my froggie faction is<br/>\n&gt; long<br/>\n&gt; &gt; gone and they agro me.
