Even folks who didn&#39;t want the factions came in to<br/>\nloot after everyone else who fought and took faction hits got loots. We<br/>\ntried to kill giants and get the corroded stuff but it never dropped (we got<br/>\none set of boots made iirc.) Look on the spoiler sites and you see that no<br/>\nquested armor items are getting reported - it&#39;s far easier to kill stuff in<br/>\nPoG.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Mott, Mike J.
