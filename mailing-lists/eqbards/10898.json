And when I say wrong - I mean wrong for you - because you let<br/>\nthings &quot;get to you.&quot; All these &quot;you&#39;s&quot; being the generic &quot;you&quot; not a<br/>\npersonal attack. Ok &lt;g&gt; ?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have over 80 days played (on Sylly alone) and am level 37 and I do not<br/>\nplay any other chars - seriously.  I hate getting XP.  I hate Highkeep,<br/>\nOgguk, KFC (although it got better with the Penthouse levels).  XP is<br/>\nboring, boring, boring.  I hate Verant when they nerf my trade skills and<br/>\nmake it so I cant ever afford to earn PP.  I love meeting some young ranger<br/>\nwho is totally lost - level 10 and has a lion chasing him across East<br/>\nKarana.  Now there is an adventure waiting to happen!  I&#39;ll decline an<br/>\ninvote to an Ogguk guard party to run him to Surefall Glade.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do LOVE all of the people and friends I have met in my adventures!  I play<br/>\nthis game for them! <br/>\n<br/>\nIf I see someone fully twinked - it does not bother me in the least.  I know<br/>\na lot more about what its like as you go higher up.  I run out of bank room<br/>\n- yes I keep meaning to start gnome war and give her a full set of bronze ;p<br/>\nI got junk not worth selling but so far out of the reach of &#39;normal levels&#39;<br/>\nit&#39;s a twink to pass out. I have k&#39;s of pp and nothing to buy! Who cares<br/>\nthat some one has started a twink?  Feel good about the stuff you have<br/>\nearned.  When that twink hits mid 20&#39;s he will have to endure the same<br/>\nnumber of hours in HK and not even get the small re-compense of feeling good<br/>\nabout the loot.  At least there is stuff of value for you to go get.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDecide that you either care about the loot and xp or you care about the<br/>\npeople and the adventures.  Then make your choice.  Camp, powergame, kill<br/>\nguards, spend endless hours on easy kills, easy kills and more easy kills.<br/>\n/r bz killing darter<br/>\n<br/>\nOr adventure and make some friends.  If you don&#39;t like playing for the<br/>\npeople part why bother with a massive multi-player - get a box game and get<br/>\nyour loots from 100% NPC&#39;s - no Twinked wood elfs, no KS wizzies, no KS<br/>\ndruids kiting, no cute little gnomes to chat with.  That&#39;s a totally<br/>\ndifferent game.<br/>\n<br/>\nEverQuest and Norrath is a wild and crazy place!  Not everything is &quot;right&quot;<br/>\nnor fits to everyone&#39;s personal vision of &quot;how things should be&quot; but there<br/>\nare lots and lots of people playing the game and lots and lots of adventures<br/>\nto be had.  Forget about twinking - its just someone with too much money and<br/>\nnowhere to store their toys. The joy and value of the game is in people and<br/>\nadventures.  Not camping XP.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI would sure hate to see you go.  I think you are a really great Bard.  And<br/>\nto see you quit just cause you see some twink that has an attitude - would<br/>\nsadden me greatly.  So, hang in there and have some great adventures!<br/>\n<br/>\nOr start a new bard on Innoruuk and Harm and I will twink you to the max!!!<br/>\n&lt;eg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\n&lt;Spirit of the Moon&gt;<br/>\nBard of the 37th song<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\tJasonF [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JasonF@...\">JasonF@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tWednesday, December 01, 1999 11:13 AM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Eqbards@...\">Eqbards@...</a><br/>\n\t\tSubject:\t[eqbards] Twinking Causes a Crisis of Faith<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFrom: &quot;JasonF&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JasonF@...\">JasonF@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tI&#39;ve been playing my bard &quot;Crier&quot; for just under 38 days of<br/>\n&#39;played&#39; time<br/>\n\t\tand I just hit level 36. <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tI am seriously wondering what it is I&#39;m doing playing a game<br/>\nthat makes me<br/>\n\t\tfeel this way.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tCrier Sharpsong</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
