In any case, he wasn&#39;t<br/>\nthat hard to get.  We just go into Skyfire from BW between Ixlblat Fer pulls for the Clerics and pull any<br/>\nnamed MOBs to zone.  Usually see him within a couple of hours.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m still five pieces short.  My guild is apparently bored with Fear (why go when only a few people need<br/>\nthings?), so the whip may not be that easy (I&#39;m hoping to multi-quest).  Phinegel is a sticking point; my<br/>\nguild will drop anything for anyone&#39;s epic MOB but Phinny.  We haven&#39;t taken him in a month.  (Our senior<br/>\nbard got his spine by buying a multi-quest from some group that looted it and had no bard.)  Red Scale I&#39;m<br/>\nstill behind several warriors.  White Scale is stupid, either kill the hardest dragon in Kunark or kill a<br/>\ndragon that Verant won&#39;t let me fight.  And Trak guts?  Bah.  My guild doesn&#39;t seem interested in<br/>\nbothering with Trak now that they can get so many easy BP drops in PoG.  And it&#39;s not like this is a<br/>\nguaranteed drop, like it is with Ragefire (who is a pansy by comparison).  I think it&#39;s on the order of a<br/>\none in six shot.  I&#39;m not a happy bard atm.<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 56 songs, Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)&quot; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; i heard he can be on any of the named cycles.  the concert hall epic quest<br/>\n&gt; board may have more info for you on him:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://pub5.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallfrm7\">http://pub5.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallfrm7</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Eldrig was my hardest piece.  took me a week every day in skyfire to get<br/>\n&gt; him.  i hardly ever actually hunted for him.  i showed up every day, let the<br/>\n&gt; zone know i needed him, and asked a member of each group there to let me<br/>\n&gt; know if they saw him.  a lot of regulars there so i became known during that<br/>\n&gt; week, and finally i get a tell one night that he was up.  booked over there<br/>\n&gt; and nailed him.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Shada, 58 Bard<br/>\n&gt; Afterlife<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Greetings...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I was in skyfire the other night trying to get Eldrig to spawn.  The<br/>\n&gt; &gt; question I have is if he is on the same cycle as Black Scar, and the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; other named ones?  Seems like black scar, and some other named<br/>\n&gt; &gt; chromodrac spanwed every time.  Is Eldrig just rare?  (Like the lava<br/>\n&gt; &gt; walkder?)  Or is there some other trick to get him to spawn?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Laluni Songhammer, 51 Bard of E&#39;Ci<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
