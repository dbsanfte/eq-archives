Mobs have two chances to resist<br/>\nLullaby:<br/>\n<br/>\nA success on the first chance to save has always generated a<br/>\nresist message in red (&quot;Your target resisted the Kelin&#39;s Lucid<br/>\nLullaby spell&quot;).  I denote this as &#39;R&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nA failure on the first chance to save generates a &quot;&lt;target&gt;&#39;s<br/>\nhead nods&quot; message, and a second save check.  Please move this<br/>\nmessage to after a failure on the second save check to cut<br/>\ndown on spam.<br/>\n<br/>\nA success on the second chance to save was not being sent to<br/>\nour clients.  This was fixed in a recent patch, and now<br/>\nproduces the message, &quot;Your target has resisted your attempt<br/>\nto mesmerize it&quot; in blue.  (Please make this message red. :) )  <br/>\nI denote this as &#39;r&#39;.  Based on GZ&#39;s statements above, mobs<br/>\nthat are the same level as the bard should be succeeding at<br/>\nthis second save 35% of the time, less for higher charisma.  <br/>\nFor large level spreads (level 1 vs. level 35 in the above<br/>\nquoted test), the success rate should be 25%, less for higher<br/>\ncharisma.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the mob fails both first and second chances to resist, the<br/>\nsong succeeds and the mob is mesmerized for about 6 seconds.  <br/>\nI denote this as &#39;N&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI ran some tests and culled the results out of my logfiles<br/>\n(which I can email to anyone at Verant).  My bard was level 45<br/>\nduring these tests, her charisma was 154, and she had a lute<br/>\nequipped all times except for one test.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first test was when my group derailed a train at the<br/>\nMistmoore zone.  All the mobs were low blue to green - L20-L35<br/>\nfor the most part.

Please investigate and<br/>\nfix it.  It&#39;s possible the same bug is affecting Pixie Strike,<br/>\nas a lot of bards started complaining about PS being broken<br/>\nabout the same time as they started complaining about Lullaby<br/>\nnot working.<br/>\n<br/>\n- More substantial (high green to low blue) mobs seem to be<br/>\nresisting at higher than 50%.  I assume this is due to the<br/>\nsame bug as with level 1-4 mobs.  With a 35% to 50%+ resist<br/>\nrate against blue/green mobs, and apparently a 70% resist rate<br/>\nagainst mid-blue mobs, you can see why bards have been<br/>\ncomplaining so loudly about this song being broken.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Why isn&#39;t my charisma having any statistically significant<br/>\neffect?<br/>\n<br/>\n- Why isn&#39;t the lute having any statistically significant<br/>\neffect when Lullaby is listed as a string song?<br/>\n<br/>\n- An apology.  Bards have been complaining about this song<br/>\nbeing broken for months.  We were always brushed off with<br/>\n&quot;It&#39;s working as designed.&quot;  Obviously it isn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nKaearia<br/>\nKarana<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
