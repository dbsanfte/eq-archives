I believe the name of the author was David Taylor, but I have to<br/>\nwarn you, I&#39;m pulling the name from the deep recesses of my brain here, so<br/>\naccuracy is not guaranteed.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I recall, I quite liked the first book, and thought the other two were so<br/>\nso to okay.  Keep in mind also that I was in high school at the time. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe stories were about a bard in the classic sense, who travelled around and<br/>\ngot in adventures.  Pretty typical fantasy stuff.  I still see the books in<br/>\nused book stores and the like, so I imagine you could find it if you looked.<br/>\n<br/>\nJyzan<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;GRENON, DANIEL&quot; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;GRENON, DANIEL&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:daniel.grenon@...\">daniel.grenon@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi fellow Bards,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I was wondering if any of you got any good suggestions for books<br/>\n&gt; about Bards that would be Everquest like? And some books about<br/>\n&gt; Everquest in general too would be fun to read. I never read a Fantasy<br/>\n&gt; book or played a fantasy game (but tons of sci-fi), so I&#39;m new with this<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; genre I would like to start with light stuff not too complicated.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thank you,<br/>\n&gt; The invisible Bard of the E&#39;ci dimension.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; What do lizards and rock music have in common?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; They both have communities at ONElist.
