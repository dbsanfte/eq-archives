I would prefer that we pressure Verant for some sort of<br/>\npace meter, to use in conjunction with either Sense Heading or a compass.  It<br/>\nremains my contention that using an out-of-game mechanism to make up for what<br/>\nwe believe is an in-game lack must be done carefully and with minimum<br/>\nintrusion.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne could argue that this mailing list is exactly one of those out-of-game<br/>\nmechanisms, and one would be right.  We trade information here in both in-game<br/>\nand out-of-game terms, mixing those somewhat freely.  My rationalization for<br/>\nthat is, say, a mystical collection of scrying pools where people can exchange<br/>\nmessages amongst agreeable communities using appropriate incantations.  Except<br/>\nwhen discussiong game bugs or otherwise forced, I&#39;d prefer to keep this forum<br/>\nas in-game as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo obviously I see a gray area rather than a clear line for what&#39;s<br/>\nappropriate.  For me personally, /loc is just too far over the line, to the<br/>\npoint that I&#39;d rather suffer lack of ability than use it.<br/>\n<br/>\n        Bob<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding the discussion of whether bards can appropriately wear plate armor, I<br/>\nmust say I do feel it a bit excessive for one who builds a life around song,<br/>\nentertainment, and personal charm.  On the other hand the reality of life on<br/>\nNorrath is that it is harsh and to fulfil our part in strengthening our groups,<br/>\nwe bards must stay alive.  Since we find plate armor available, it fits us, and<br/>\nwe have the strength, I for one will wear it gladly when I must and not<br/>\nquestion the magic that lets me play my lute with fingers encased in steel.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen when I play for a crowd or visit a merchant, I will likely change into my<br/>\nsilk evening shirt and the amulet and earrings that give me magnetism and charm<br/>\nwithout a skin of steel.
