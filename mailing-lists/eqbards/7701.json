But then I play with clerics,<br/>\nso I haven&#39;t run back to my corpse in months. Corpse recovery is much<br/>\nmore an issue than mere running for your corpse at higher levels.<br/>\nGetting a second group together to help fight to your corpse when<br/>\nfighting the ghoul lord or the efreeti are much harder and take way<br/>\nlonger than merely running to the zone.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith my druid I don&#39;t bind close to where I&#39;m fighting either. Usually<br/>\nthere&#39;s a druid gate within 2 or 3 zones of where I am, and I&#39;m used to<br/>\nrunning that far as a bard anyway so it&#39;s no big deal. Currently my<br/>\ndruid is bound in quenos and fighting on Faydwer.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
