Case closed end of discussion.  Ranger rants continued<br/>\non Whineplay anyway.  Verant has since backed down on that decision.  So it<br/>\nwasn&#39;t a waste of their time because they got what they wanted in the end.<br/>\nBards could be in a similar situation if we continue to raise the issues on<br/>\nWhineplay.  Question is does anyone feel like fighting the battle anymore.<br/>\nThe mood I&#39;m getting is that a lot of bards are saying screw it and either<br/>\nswitching classes or quitting the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nwhy isn&#39;t working as intended a valid response?  that&#39;s like going to an<br/>\namusement park, riding a roller coaster and saying, well my idea of a roller<br/>\ncoaster is different, it should have 2 more corkscrews and a loop and<br/>\nexpecting<br/>\nthe amusement park to reconstruct it to match your specifications.  if you<br/>\ndon&#39;t like it, ride another ride (try another class) or if you really don&#39;t<br/>\nlike it, <br/>\ndon&#39;t go to the park anymore (cancel your account).  but either way, it&#39;s a<br/>\nwaste<br/>\nof time and energy to keep ranting about it afterwards.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
