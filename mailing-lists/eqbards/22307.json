However the spdat.eff file did get patched last<br/>\n&gt; weekend when I logged in.  They can also change some spell effects in the<br/>\n&gt; database without taking the servers down.  I think this might actually<br/>\nhave<br/>\n&gt; gone in with the last patch and may have either been unintentional, or<br/>\nthey<br/>\n&gt; may be trying it out to see if they see any unbalancing effects from it<br/>\n&gt; being live before they announce that it is live.  That way if they have to<br/>\n&gt; change it fewer people will notice.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Reece Tom R CPT 25 ID L G4(n)<br/>\n&gt; [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Friday, November 03, 2000 1:06 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] Has anyone else used these recently and noticed?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Don&#39;t think the server I am on (E&#39;ci) has gone down for the scheduled<br/>\nserver<br/>\n&gt; maintenance Abashi mentioned.
