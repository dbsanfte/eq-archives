(while I was playing my iksar monk, got him from 8 to 10<br/>\nrunning around the pit buffed out wazoo).<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom their we decided to go for the big camp (the church).  It was a great<br/>\nguild night.  2 full groups, non stop multi mob pulls.  The boss (I forgot<br/>\nhis name) showed up once.  Unfortunatly the only warrior there didn&#39;t want<br/>\nhis sword (he was the only guild person there who could use it), so a lvl 20<br/>\nwarrior in our guild (who happened to be online at the time) is pretty darn<br/>\nlucky (its a 2HS 23/40 3dex/str).<br/>\n<br/>\nNone the less we got 3 of those nice daggers and about 8 weight reducing<br/>\npacks (and lots of XP!  0 deaths!)<br/>\n<br/>\nI also got to show off my new drum as the main boss is a 42 necro, so I wove<br/>\nguardian and purifying rythms and he couldn&#39;t get anything to stick on us.<br/>\n(we made sure my group kept his attention as I am the only bard in the<br/>\nguild)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
