I have","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1224042773\">I found this on another message board:<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you know, there is a scheduled outage this Wednesday where a new<br/>\npatch will be installed for Everquest. I have obtained insider<br/>\ninformation on the new proposed game changes:<br/>\n<br/>\n12/05/99 - New changes with latest patch: (by Trajan of Brell<br/>\nSerilis)<br/>\n<br/>\nWEATHER<br/>\n<br/>\nDropped items now have a 25% chance of being swept away during rain<br/>\nstorms, excluding rusty weapons and foraged grubs, which will now<br/>\nlitter the landscape for an extra 20 minutes when dropped.<br/>\n<br/>\nA new NPC &quot;Noah&quot; will wander around Norrath, most often in South<br/>\nKarana, looking to round up two of each creature.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPETS<br/>\n<br/>\nNecro pets have been modified. They will still do the same amount of<br/>\ndamage in melee, but will now give &quot;the finger&quot; to any monk passing<br/>\nby. This behavior can be toggled via the &quot;/pet humble&quot; or &quot;/pet<br/>\narrogant&quot; commands.<br/>\n<br/>\nNew pet commands: /pet sit, /pet SIT (all caps), /pet goddamit<br/>\nSIT!!<br/>\n<br/>\nNPC BEHAVIOR / AI<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you accidently give the wrong combination of items to an NPC or the right <br/>\nitems to the wrong NPC, the NPC will laugh hideously at you and immediately <br/>\nrun to the nearest merchant to sell these items, at which point there will <br/>\nbe no way to re-acquire the misgiven items.<br/>\n<br/>\nPathfinding has been improved in zones such as Mistmoore, Everfrost<br/>\nand Permafrost. Mobs no longer &quot;appear then disappear, then appear&quot;<br/>\nright in front of you. Now they simply appear in front of you without<br/>\nany prior visible evidence of their existence.<br/>\n<br/>\nMobs will no longer be able to hit/target thru walls & doors - instead in <br/>\nselect zones, walls and doors will be considered autonomous NPCs which can <br/>\ndeal damage similar to other monsters in the area.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDYING<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen dying, you will no longer lose experience. Instead, you will<br/>\nhave a random number of personal effects disappear (both from your<br/>\nperson and the bank).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe cleric revive spell will teleport you to your body as well as a<br/>\nnearby property insurance agent (GM) who will then tell you you&#39;re out of <br/>\nluck if you think you can get any lost items back. The cleric<br/>\nressurrect spell does the same thing but gives you a few animated<br/>\nitems which disappear when you log.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSPELLS<br/>\n<br/>\nNew Druid Spells: Ring of Desktop (29th), Circle of Desktop (34th) -<br/>\nImmediately teleports you to the Windows 98 desktop, thereby aborting<br/>\nEverquest; in-game action similar to going link-dead. Circle of<br/>\nDesktop has the same results but affects the entire party. Succor:<br/>\nDesktop was decidedly left out as it took three times more<br/>\ntime than required to hit CTRL-ALT-DEL which caused the same effect.<br/>\n<br/>\nNew Shaman Spells: Spirit of GM (Allows you to run faster than SoW in<br/>\nopposite direction when asked for assistance)<br/>\n<br/>\nNew Enchanter Spells: Clarify (automatically makes excuses to other<br/>\nmage classes as to why you can&#39;t cast Clarity on them)<br/>\n<br/>\nSKILLS<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFemale characters now all get Berserk Frenzy once per game month for 3 to 5 <br/>\ngame days.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nA new skill has been introduced: &quot;slacking&quot; - Humans, Ogres and Trolls begin <br/>\nwith a bonus to this skill of 35. It is available to all races. &quot;Slackers&quot; - <br/>\nexperts in this field will be able to manufacture new game items: <br/>\ntelevision, la-z-boy recliner, cheetos, remote control - all of which <br/>\nimprove hp regeneration while adding to encumberance.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother new skill: &quot;pimping&quot; is available to all classes except<br/>\nShamen, Enchanters & Druids. Experts in this skill will be able to<br/>\nforce others around them to cast Sprit of the Wolf on them at will.<br/>\nMasters of this skill may force druids to teleport them far out of<br/>\ntheir way while thinking you&#39;re doing them a favor.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother new skill: &quot;whining&quot; available to all classes but melee<br/>\nclasses start with 50 skill points, monks start with 60. Masters of<br/>\nthis skill have the ability to root GMs for extended periods of time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEMOTES<br/>\n<br/>\nThe following new emotes are available with accompanying animation and <br/>\nspecial effects:<br/>\n<br/>\n/macarena immediately start dancing<br/>\n/hurl expunges pieces of food in immediate vicinity<br/>\n(sometimes the former may case others around to perform the latter)<br/>\n/rap you begin bragging of your wealth<br/>\n/gangsta rap same as above but you also swing your weapon<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNEW COMMANDS<br/>\n<br/>\n/youdied? feins linkdead status when a party member dies and you&#39;re a healer<br/>\n/oom covertly casts heal and SoW on yourself, and points you in the <br/>\ndirection of the nearest zone, while telling party you are OOM<br/>\n/commend file a compliment/commendation on a local GM (untested)<br/>\n<br/>\n/guild emancipate Removes guild status from (without his knowledge) until he <br/>\nreaches a high-enough level where he posesses good spells and items<br/>\n<br/>\n/pimpfilter ignores any say/guild/shout/ooc comments which contain<br/>\nthe words &quot;tp&quot; or &quot;sow&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNEW QUEST ITEMS<br/>\n<br/>\nGuise of the Pimp Deceiver - Allows you to appear to be in the same<br/>\nguild as the person you are targeting - extremely useful for finding<br/>\ngroups and getting free items & buffs<br/>\n<br/>\nCloak of &quot;friend&quot; protection - AC5 DEX+6 AGI+2 Effect: immediately TPs you <br/>\nto another area in the zone whenever someone you don&#39;t know<br/>\naddresses you as &quot;friend&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nButtFire - 2HB DMG 18 DLY 22 Effect: random farting - new Paladin-only quest <br/>\nwhich results in this spectacularly-animated weapon which has a random <br/>\n&quot;fart&quot; effect which causes 2-16 hp of damage to all within a 10&#39; radius <br/>\n(Trolls & Ogres are immune)<br/>\n<br/>\nEarring of Newbie Reflection - AC2 STA+5 HP+10 Effect: makes you con<br/>\ngreen to everyone else and upon inspection shows that you are wearing<br/>\ncloth armor and wielding a rusty dagger.<br/>\n<br/>\nEBay-Scale leggings - AC11 STA+12 all/all Effect: Creates an illusion<br/>\nthat you are camping a rare spawn even when you are not logged on.<br/>\nAwarded from a quest involving KS&#39;ing several lower-level characters<br/>\nin search of experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nStaff of Irony - (rumored to exist - no proof) The most powerful<br/>\nweapon in the game, attainable only by killing tons of mobs that all<br/>\ncon green to you.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
