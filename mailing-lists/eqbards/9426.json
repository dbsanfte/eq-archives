This is perhaps the best<br/>\n&gt; non-Planes item for Clerics, Druids and Shamans (AC 9, STA +5, WIS +9, AGI<br/>\n&gt; +9, MANA +5, SV DISEASE -5 and CHA -5).  I started the quest a<br/>\n&gt; few weeks ago<br/>\n&gt; before we knew about the Lambent quests :-)  A 50th Wiz on Fennin Ro the<br/>\n&gt; other night was auctioning for trade a MM Battle Drum.  I told him I was<br/>\n&gt; close to completing the Paw and he offered to trade TWO sets of MM Battle<br/>\n&gt; Drums for the completed Paw.  A friend of mine that is familiar<br/>\n&gt; with the Wiz<br/>\n&gt; says that he bought the drums on ebay, I dunno...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What is the consensus?  Is this a fair trade?  Be it known that<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve camped<br/>\n&gt; Paw pieces for approximately 25 hours and had to get my baking skill up as<br/>\n&gt; well (and we bards are the brightest bunch).  At 28th I think that I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; approaching the level that I would expect to be able to get a MM<br/>\n&gt; Battle Drum<br/>\n&gt; with my own group.  Is this correct?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Crier Sharpsong </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
