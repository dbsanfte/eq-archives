Lets look at what<br/>\nwe do, and how we do it...hmmmm.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny competent bard twists/weaves (insert your favorite teminology for it<br/>\nhere) songs. This results in constant button mashing (twitching) in a non<br/>\ntwitch game. I love my bard, I love what we do - I don&#39;t like constantly<br/>\nmashing buttons. Same reason I don&#39;t like having to switch out<br/>\nweapons/instruments.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps the slots we are missing could be something we ourselves could<br/>\nwrite - out of what we already have.<br/>\n<br/>\nSay, the first one missing is something that allows 2 or 3 songs to be<br/>\nscribed together - with the bard deciding, ok...I want Hymn one bar, X song<br/>\nfor two bars, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d even go so far as to allow this to be setup time and time again, i.e.,<br/>\nnot permanent - there are too many situations this could be useful in - and<br/>\ntoo much experimentation that would need to be done to write once and<br/>\nforget it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWould this circumvent the number of songs available to us at a time?  Ummm,<br/>\nnot really - if a song is useful enough to put in a medly - it&#39;s probably<br/>\ngoing to be mem&#39;d anyway - this just saves the bard some carpal tunnel.<br/>\nPerhaps require that the compenents are mem&#39;d at the time - this would<br/>\nactually DECREASE the number available to us, but IMHO would be worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWould this overpower the class?  I don&#39;t think so - it might however even<br/>\nup things for folks like me with lousy connects to the net.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe ONLY thing I dislike about the bard class is the twitch factor, in a<br/>\nsupposedly nontwitch game.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
