I always equip my<br/>\nflute when I want to improve my chances of getting a charm or pixie strike<br/>\nto stick.  First time I think I&#39;ve seen a post that said the flute didn&#39;t<br/>\nhelp with charm or pixie.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn all honesty, I wouldn&#39;t be too upset if it was true.  That would allow me<br/>\nto keep my weapons or other instruments equipped when I&#39;m trying to charm or<br/>\npixie instead of switching back and forth.  Also frees up one of my main<br/>\ninventory slots since I can just keep the flute in a bag.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;   As with all of our other wind based songs, the flute is utterly<br/>\n&gt;   useless unless it&#39;s required (invisiblility).  Using a flute for<br/>\n&gt;   our other songs doesn&#39;t do anything.  Charm, Pixie, Charisma,<br/>\n&gt;   WaterBreathing, no duration improvement, resist lessening, or<br/>\n&gt;   statistical adjustment can be noticed.  Which is sad, and probably<br/>\n&gt;   explains why my Darkwood Piccolo has no stats.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
