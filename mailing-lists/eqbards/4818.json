If you are getting lag during peaks of battles, its quite possibly not connection speed at all, but lag on YOUR side... your system may be having trouble","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1203020240\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;<br/>\n&gt;         1) Will I see any advantages in EQ?  I would assume lag should be<br/>\n&gt; lessof an issue and zoning a bit faster...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; With a cable modem, I still experience tremendous lag at some points.  Most<br/>\n&gt; recently, I have been in Unrest playing in non-peak hours  (I live in Hawaii<br/>\n&gt; so when I play at night its after midnight on the mainland).  Most of the<br/>\n&gt; time there are only around 20 people in the one.  Even with that low number<br/>\n&gt; of people, lag still hits during the peak of battle.  I am starting to<br/>\n&gt; believe lag is more a function of the zone you are in versus your connection<br/>\n&gt; speed.  Other people I am grouped with all seem to experience lag at the<br/>\n&gt; same time I do, and they have regular modem connections.  In other zones<br/>\n&gt; this doesn&#39;t seem to be the case.  I was adventuring in the Karanas and<br/>\n&gt; Beholder all last week and I never had any lag problems.  In regards to<br/>\n&gt; zoning times, the amount of RAM you have makes a big difference.  I upgraded<br/>\n&gt; from 64MB to 128MB of RAM and it makes a world of difference.  I can follow<br/>\n&gt; people into a one and get to the other side 30 seconds before they arrive.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you are getting lag during peaks of battles, its quite possibly not<br/>\nconnection speed at all, but lag on YOUR side... your system may be having<br/>\ntrouble processing the amounts of images on the screen... with bard spell<br/>\neffects and other spell effects firing off, plus several people in different<br/>\ntypes of armor, the weak links in your system will begin to show, whether that<br/>\nis borderline memory, a slower video card, a slower processor, or whatever...<br/>\n<br/>\nTry reducing graphical settings (going from double layer to single layer sky is<br/>\nreally simple and you don&#39;t lose too much, and bumping down particle density is<br/>\nVERY useful)... also try switching into third person view as that seems to help<br/>\nme sometimes...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing... I upgraded my memory as well, and damn if it isn&#39;t the best<br/>\nthing I&#39;ve ever done to this ole computer.
