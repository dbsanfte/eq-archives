I&#39;ve only got a 31.2 connection (if I&#39;m<br/>\nlucky.. local phone lines blow, so anything faster is a dream, even with<br/>\na 56k modem.. and my cable company doesn&#39;t even have 30 channels, much<br/>\nless cable modems (sigh, the trouble of bass-ackwards towns))  I&#39;m using<br/>\nwhatever video card came with my system (not positive, but I&#39;m guessing<br/>\nit&#39;s an ATI Rage Pro.. that seems popular to prepackage nowadays..<br/>\nhonestly havn&#39;t checked) and I never have any trouble with lag or<br/>\nslowdown.. very rarely I&#39;ll get some bad packet loss.. but it doesn&#39;t<br/>\nhappen often enough to bother me.. (altho I do bitch about it a lot when<br/>\nit does :)<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple things you may want to check..<br/>\n(not sure if these&#39;l help with what seems like a video problem, but it<br/>\ndoes help with slowdown in general)<br/>\nCheck to see what things are running while you play eq, and turn off the<br/>\nthings you don&#39;t need.. (both in the system tray, and the ctrl-alt-del<br/>\nmenu)<br/>\nCheck your system registry for uneeded things and zap em out of there<br/>\nmake sure your phone line is CLEAN!  If you can pick up a phone and hear<br/>\nstatic, this can be a big cause of lag.  Ma Bell will usualy check and<br/>\ncorrect this for free.  (altho dealing with them can be a pain)<br/>\nYour modem brand DOES matter.  Some companies just make shoddy modems.<br/>\nI use a US Robotics Courier v.everything 33.6  (upgraded to 56k)  I&#39;ve<br/>\nnever had a problem with it.. best modem I&#39;ve ever owned (and I&#39;ve owned<br/>\na lot :)  altho it is a bit pricey.. ($200 with a sysop discount about 3<br/>\nyears ago)<br/>\n<br/>\nRunning in a lower res vid mode can help as well..<br/>\n<br/>\nNOTE:  most of these things should not be tinkered with if you don&#39;t<br/>\nknow what you&#39;re doing.. (ESPECIALLY the system registry)  You can<br/>\nREALLY screw things up if you make a mistake.. rule of thumb:  if you<br/>\ndon&#39;t know what it is, or what it does.. leave it alone  :).<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this helped someone out there  *grins*<br/>\nTake care,<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nZen Tormey<br/>\nLokar of the Soerbaird   -Fennin Ro<br/>\nwww.soerbaird.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n This message was sent from Castle Rock BBS - telnet casrock.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
