The stones<br/>\nare too common to sell economically at 100pp.  I usually find<br/>\n2-3 in a night fighting giants solo.  If I sat around waiting<br/>\naround for someone to buy one for 100pp, I&#39;d end up letting<br/>\nthe other two rot because they are lore.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo high level bard I know pays for the stones - it&#39;s way too<br/>\neasy to get them via normal play.  I talked my guild into a<br/>\nRathe expedition to get stones.  We got 8 that night, but now<br/>\nI realize it was unnecessary.  I have all but two pieces of<br/>\nlambent armor, and we still have like 10 stones behind held by<br/>\nguildmembers, most picked up in subsequent &quot;regular&quot; play.  I<br/>\nsuspect the people driving up the price, if they really are<br/>\nselling for 100pp, are low level folks who somehow have<br/>\namassed large amounts of plat (trade skills, pie sketch<br/>\nexploit, indirect twinking, etc).<br/>\n<br/>\nHang around Rathe, offer to trade plat for gold (HGs tend to<br/>\ndrop 5x as much gold as plat and it gets heavy quick, but<br/>\ncharismatic bards can convert it back to plat at a 10% loss by<br/>\nbuying/selling combine weapons at the gypsies), sell weapons,<br/>\netc.  I&#39;ve seen just as many stones /auctioned as &quot;free on<br/>\ncorpse&quot; as I&#39;ve seen for sale.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
