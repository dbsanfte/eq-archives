If you<br/>\ngot charm and mez - u r not in the lookout room &lt;g&gt; you&#39;re a couple levels<br/>\ndeeper!  I know I get lots of good advice from a fellow bard but it usually<br/>\nincludes using a couple songs that I don&#39;t get for a couple more levels -<br/>\ncareful readers saw one today - I asked of which 2 songs is better at<br/>\nslowing attack speeds and I got told that 2 other songs are better - well<br/>\nthat&#39;s all fine and dandy but I don&#39;t got them songs (not even pre-bought<br/>\ncuz I know what bad luck that brings ya &lt;g&gt;).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - ya we bellow - but that might be the best we got?  And there maybe a<br/>\ncouple &quot;surge of strength...&quot; and &quot;protected by magical aura...&quot; that u<br/>\ndon&#39;t see (cuz u r not grouped with them) between the bellows u do see.   <br/>\n<br/>\nBTW - I got pretty brave now - in HighKeep I&#39;ll use Denon&#39;s and Lullaby --<br/>\nAE or Z-axis seem to be no problems.  Well  the other rooms are well camped<br/>\nusually  but I don&#39;t see any hits or misses on stuff from the other rooms.<br/>\nOnly potential problems is some gobbie train goes up and Guards come down<br/>\nchasing it back down - saw  Captn Boesic ks&#39;ing on the ramp the other day -<br/>\noffered to train him out for 20pp but got no takers :-)  Or if u run up<br/>\nchasin some gobbie and forget and leave Denons on.<br/>\n<br/>\nHehe AE and Z axis are not just deadly indoors.........there I was...pullin<br/>\nfor my group off the aviak villiage.  So I run in to nab something and it<br/>\nmusta been right after a fight - we were all SoW&#39;d (which I normally rant<br/>\nabout but was a good thing this time) and I musta forgot and left Denons on<br/>\n- so I make a fast lap around the trees and don&#39;t see nutthin - then hmm a<br/>\nharrier at the ramp - bellow! /g inc harrier run back the party - turn<br/>\naround and .... 6 birties including Mr Avo!!!  &quot;Nice pull Sylly!&quot;  LOADING,<br/>\nPLEASE WAIT  The rest of the party took off for the zone and lived. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo my 1 thru 4 hot keys are buff du jour (anthem or chant depending on if<br/>\nparty likes str or dex), bellow, denons, chains  - this is for me being<br/>\nbattle bard and in melee combat.  Other song loaded are lullaby, guardian<br/>\nrythmns, hymn,  and jig  (hmm usually have selos up too but inside Keep no<br/>\nneed really.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\tRokenn Swiftsong [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rokenn@...\">rokenn@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tFriday, September 10, 1999 1:24 PM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n\t\tSubject:\tRe: [eqbards] Just a bit of fun (longish)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFrom: &quot;Rokenn Swiftsong&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rokenn@...\">rokenn@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tOne thing that pains me more then anything is to see a Bard<br/>\nthat ONLY uses <br/>\n\t\tbellow in combat :(  I have been spending time in High Keep<br/>\nfor the last few <br/>\n\t\tlevels, and when I see a message flash across my screen<br/>\nshowing a bard just <br/>\n\t\tbellowing his/her heart out I wince.  When I am not in my<br/>\nregular group I <br/>\n\t\talways explain the tactics I will be using with something<br/>\nlike this:<br/>\n\t\tTonight&#39;s song list consists of the following in regular<br/>\ncombat: Anthem &#39;de <br/>\n\t\tArms (boast str, atk speed), Psalm of warth (grp damage<br/>\nshield and AC), <br/>\n\t\tchains (slow atk spd and snare).  Do not snare or root<br/>\nunless I call for it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tThen a second one saying:<br/>\n\t\tIf a gob is glowing red and I am not attacking leave it<br/>\nalone I mesmirizing <br/>\n\t\tit.  If I call out charming so and so, I have charmed that<br/>\ngob.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tMany groups I have been in are amazed that one- I do not use<br/>\nbellow :), two- <br/>\n\t\tthat I can keep three song effects going.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tBut for the life of me I can not understand why they whine<br/>\nso much when I <br/>\n\t\tsay good night, lol.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tRokenn Swiftsong - Karana server<br/>\n\t\tMaster Craftsmen of Societus Argenti<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tHow would you like to have a voice in the marketplace and be<br/>\n\t\trewarded for it?
