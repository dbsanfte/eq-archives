If you&#39;re going to base it<br/>\non who will get the best use out of it, are you basing it on<br/>\nraw numerical improvement, or percentage improvement?  A large<br/>\nportion of a rogues damage comes from his backstab.  Replacing<br/>\n(say) a dragoon dirk with an EBW in his off hand may only<br/>\nimprove his damage output by 2%-3%.  But for a bard it could<br/>\nrepresent an improvement of 10%-15%.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, will he be using it in his primary hand or his<br/>\nsecondary?  If it&#39;s going in his secondary, but would go in<br/>\nyour primary, then arguably your raw numerical damage<br/>\nimprovement would be greater than his because you&#39;re going to<br/>\nswing the weapon every round, while he, even with double<br/>\nattack, is only going to swing it roughly 85% of the time (65%<br/>\ndual wield, 20% double attack, if I remember those figures<br/>\nright).<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are so many ways to slice this that it&#39;s foolish to do<br/>\nmerit-based distribution based on only one criterion.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
