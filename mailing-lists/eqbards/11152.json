A pair of necros helped clear<br/>\n&gt; the way to my corpse (one of the frogs in jail could see invis).  My job<br/>\n&gt; was to chain the frogs and minos.  Blue frogs resisted at least 50% if not<br/>\n&gt; more without the charisma gear on my corpse (human, put a few points in<br/>\n&gt; cha, don&#39;t remember offhand, geared is 137).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; After this incident, I am on a quest to gather as much charisma equipment<br/>\n&gt; as possible.  There are very few items we can wear that increase charisma<br/>\n&gt; in some slots (belt, back, shoulders, next to if not nothing).  The<br/>\n&gt; dexterity items that are available are excruciatingly rare drops, dragon<br/>\n&gt; drops, or plane stuff.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I would highly recommend for starting buffs to use points in dex and cha.<br/>\n&gt; Strength is important yes, and you&#39;ll find yourself near encumbrance with<br/>\n&gt; only armor on, especially with bronze.  I myself wore a full suit of<br/>\n&gt; bronze at one point (sans helm, chain is tolerable for now but plate is<br/>\n&gt; unbearable on human), and was left with maybe 4 stones worth of weight<br/>\n&gt; till encumbrance set in (presong).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This period will pass.  If you bear with it, and suffer the weight, maybe<br/>\n&gt; pick up a few +3str gold amber earrings or whatever the rings are for the<br/>\n&gt; interim, a bloodstained mantle, studded collar (the +3 one, whatever that<br/>\n&gt; was, maybe spiked), in the long run you&#39;ll be much happier having boosted<br/>\n&gt; your other attributes instead of strength.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This assuming you spend most of your gametime at a relatively higher level<br/>\n&gt; (&gt;20).  If you&#39;re an extremely slow leveller, strength might be better of<br/>\n&gt; an attribute to contribute toward your utility gained from playing.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So where might I find a Siryn Hair Hood?
