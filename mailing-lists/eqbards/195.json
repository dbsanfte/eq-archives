Actually, they<br/>\nwere on my corpse, way up in Everfrost Peaks, but having died in Qeynos<br/>\nHills, I lost it.<br/>\nTaking this as a sign from the Gods, I decided to practice Hand-to-Hand<br/>\nattacking until I could generate more coin. Decided to truly live the life<br/>\nof an ascetic, I choose to fast. I hoped that I could &quot;live on a song&quot; and<br/>\nhave Jaxon&#39;s Jig O&#39; Vigor restore any stamina a lost due to starvation.<br/>\nThis plan might have worked, but I zoned and the song ended and I forget to<br/>\nre-sing it. I cast it as I passed out and watched my stamina and health<br/>\nbars creep up and down near their midpoints. Eventually, I began to bleed<br/>\nto death. I don&#39;t know why, I guess starvation will do that to you. The<br/>\nCoup de Grace (sp?) was right before I died. I received a rather odd<br/>\nmessage. I left it at home, but the gist was:<br/>\n<br/>\nPain and Suffering strike at YOU and miss<br/>\nPain and Suffering strike at YOU and miss<br/>\nyou died<br/>\n<br/>\nWhoah! Who are these Pain and Suffering beasties? They apparently live in<br/>\nthe city of Qeynos, since that&#39;s where I was at the time.<br/>\nI&#39;ve since decided that I should probably eat. As of this posting, Plastos<br/>\nis camped out under the Dock of Qeynos, wishing he had more food and some<br/>\nclothing. Tonight, the long climb back begins.<br/>\n<br/>\nJourneyman Plastos</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
