Several messages I&#39;ve sent after I sent this one have<br/>\nalready come back so think this one may have gotten lost in cyberspace)  <br/>\n<br/>\nLast night I was in Mistmoore at 9PM Hawaii time.  Thats 3 AM EST.  When I<br/>\nlogged on, there were less than 15 people in the zone.  The entire time I<br/>\nwas in Mistmoore, my packet loss percentage never went below 25%.  A<br/>\nguildmate was also in MM and I asked if they were having problems as well.<br/>\nThey stated they weren&#39;t having any problems and suggested I quit the game<br/>\ncompletely and log back in.  Tried that but it didn&#39;t do any good.  Decided<br/>\nto go ahead and play despite the lag.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGot into a fight in the GY and packet loss zoomed up to over 50%.  Was<br/>\nfighting a pledge familiar that started to run away.  Tried to cast chains<br/>\non it but, due to the lag, it ran down the cave and soon brought a train of<br/>\nancilles back with him.  I ended up dying and appeared at my bind spot in<br/>\nGFAY.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I got to GFAY, I had absolutely no lag problems whatsoever.  Packet<br/>\nloss was 0% and the lag number was very low.  LFAY was the same as well.  As<br/>\nsoon as I zoned back into MM, packet loss went back up to over 25%.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been playing since April and I have never had lag problems like I did<br/>\nlast night.  Any idea what was the cause? I know MM is considered a buggy<br/>\nzone but there weren&#39;t that many people in MM and the other five people in<br/>\nmy group were having no problems whatsoever.  Don&#39;t think it was my<br/>\nconnection (cable modem) because I had no lag problems when I was in GFAY<br/>\nand LFAY.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
