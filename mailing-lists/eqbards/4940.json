You would see your PL goes up to 30% and back down to 0 and <br/>\nyour song would be stuck.  You don&#39;t need a missed note to fix it, just keep <br/>\nspamming one of your song (Selo works for me) really really fast.  It is <br/>\nvery difficult to do it with mouse clicking.. so you will have to use the <br/>\nhotkeys.  I can unstuck my song everytime within a second or 2.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, your songs will also stuck when your DE mask illusion effect wears off, <br/>\nor someone casted wolf form on you, or wolf form wears off, or any other <br/>\neffect that changes your apparence while you are playing a song.  You can <br/>\nfix any of those by spamming your song.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:grei@...\">grei@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 7) Fix that bug that only I seem to get once in a while where my songs<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    get stuck on.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Had this happen to me the other night.  I finally decided to run for the<br/>\n&gt;nearest zone to clear it and while I was doing that, I spammed out the<br/>\n&gt;hotkey I have for Selos and it finally gave me a &#39;missed note&#39; message and<br/>\n&gt;went back to being normal--just as I hit the zone. Doh!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Next time it happens, I plan on spamming out one of my higher level songs<br/>\n&gt;(since I get a higher missed note response on them) until it clears<br/>\n&gt;instead of just trying to zone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Grei<br/>\n&gt;Bristlebane<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
