Impossible quest armor?  To get the boots you have to kill... nothing<br/>\nall it requires is time.  To get the gauntlets you have to kill...<br/>\nBabbinsbort, please.  I have already killed him twice at 21st level in a<br/>\ngroup where I was the highest level there at 20.  Greaves, kill Maugrim.<br/>\nYay, he&#39;s tough, killed him in a level 19-21 group.  Hint on both the<br/>\nprevious two (get a bard, they have a very hard time when everyone has an MR<br/>\nover 100).  The bracers are a pain.  Not that hard really to kill Zahal,<br/>\njust a lot of running need a ranger&#39;s help.  The shield isn&#39;t that hard<br/>\neither, Glacial Bear and Mino Sentry are not that tough.  In fact so far<br/>\nnone of these mobs are as tough as the hill giant or griffin you have to<br/>\nkill for every single piece of bard armor.  The only cleric armor pieces<br/>\nthat might be impossible are the ones that require you to kill a heavily<br/>\ncamped spawn, and I bet you could get some of those for free from someone<br/>\nwanting the Kedge totem for example.<br/>\nThere may not be other cleric only weapons, but there are other items that<br/>\nare cleric plus a few others that are very handy.  The Shining Star of Light<br/>\nis the best weapon in the game at least until 15th level or so.  Having<br/>\ncleanse as a proc means never worrying about Poison or disease, etc. from a<br/>\nmob.  They sell regularly for 75pp while Dirks never go above 40pp, go<br/>\nfigure.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My next point regards weapons.  If they are trying to balance the items,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>why<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; is it I am still using the same weapons at 21st level I used at 12th<br/>\n </span></blockquote>level?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; There really isn&#39;t anything much better than my dragoon dirk and screaming<br/>\n&gt; mace available for bards at my level.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;Thats the price you have to pay for playing on an aged server.  Dirks are<br/>\n </span></blockquote>everywhere &gt;due to a flooded market when Dvinn used to drop<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;it everytime.  If you were on a new server, you wouldn&#39;t be seeing a Dirk<br/>\n </span></blockquote>or Screamer &gt;until the mid to high teens.  Many of the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;people that played at the start used those weapons well into their 30&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Problem is I was on the serve within a month of its startup.  I still got a<br/>\ndirk at level 12 by helping kill Dvinn.  I also got a Screaming Mace by<br/>\ndoing the quest and helping kill Crush for the tunic at level 12.  Also got<br/>\nmy own tunic immediately afterwards the same way.  You could get either of<br/>\nthese in a good group at level 12-16, but then your next weapon that is<br/>\nbetter is level 25+?  That makes little sense and is not true for the other<br/>\nmelee or hybrid-melee classes.  except maybe Rogues, not too sure what stuff<br/>\nthey get.  I agree many have done this keeping those things until 30th, but<br/>\nwith new quest weapons and such it is only true now for a few classes or<br/>\nnon-questers.  Maybe my group will break down and go Mucktail hunting and I<br/>\nwill upgrade to a PGT if I win the lotto, but it certainly isn&#39;t 200pp<br/>\nbetter than my dirk.  I just don&#39;t understand why they leave out levels<br/>\n16-25 for some classes to get better equipment and not others unless its<br/>\nbecause they only cater to their own internal class interests.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
