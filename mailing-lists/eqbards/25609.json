The ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1561855961\">From <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/w32.goner.a@...\">http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/w32.goner.a@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nW32.Goner.A@mm is a mass-mailing worm that is written in Visual Basic. The <br/>\nworm has been compressed using a known Portable Executable (PE)* file <br/>\ncompressor. The worm can spread its infection using the ICQ network as well <br/>\nas by email using Microsoft Outlook. If IRC is installed, this worm can <br/>\nalso insert mIRC scripts that will enable the computer to be used in Denial <br/>\nof Service (DOS) attacks.<br/>\n<br/>\nW32.Goner.A@mm starts by displaying an &quot;About&quot; window with credits of the <br/>\nauthor and shoutouts to his friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the background, the worm starts iterating the Microsoft Outlook address <br/>\nbook and sends itself to all addresses in the address book. The email <br/>\nappears as follows.<br/>\n<br/>\nSubject: Hi<br/>\nBody:<br/>\nHow are you ?<br/>\nWhen I saw this screen saver, I immediately thought about you<br/>\nI am in a harry, I promise you will love it!<br/>\nAttachment: GONE.SCR<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nW32.Goner.A@mm is capable of spreading over the ICQ network. If ICQ is <br/>\ninstalled on an infected machine, the worm will do the following:<br/>\n1. Check for the version of the ICQ .dll file that contains the APIs that <br/>\nwill be used. If the correct version is found, the worm proceeds.<br/>\n2. Disable all notification. This means that the user cannot see what the <br/>\nworm is doing in the background.<br/>\n3. Retrieve a list of all &quot;buddies&quot; who are currently online.<br/>\n4. Retrieve information about each user individually. This information is <br/>\nrequired to be able to send files.<br/>\n5. Send itself to all users on the list.<br/>\n6. Re-enable all notifications.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf mIRC is installed, this worm can insert scripts into the mIRC folder. <br/>\nThis allows the computer to be used in DOS attacks.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, the worm displays the following fake error message:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Error while Analyze DirectX!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you get this email DO NOT OPEN THE ATTACHMENT.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for reading,<br/>\n<br/>\nTalies the Wanderer<br/>\nEQ Bards<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
