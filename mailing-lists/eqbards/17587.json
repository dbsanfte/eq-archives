They<br/>\nwork much better now.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n- The Magicians Phantom Armor series now grants HP regeneration.<br/>\n<br/>\n- The Druid spell, dance of the fireflies, has been changed from &quot;Outdoor<br/>\nonly&quot; to &quot;Night only&quot;. It may now be cast in dungeons.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Corrected a typographical error that allowed high level magicians to<br/>\ninscribe the Malosi spell. It was not intended for magicians under level 50.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*General Changes/Fixes*<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n- Items have gained the ability to be restricted by Deity. If a deity<br/>\nrestriction is placed upon an item, it will show when you<br/>\nright-click-and-hold on the item.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n- The AC on the mid-level cleric quest armor has been increased.<br/>\n<br/>\n- The Terror Mask will now cast &quot;Fear&quot; instead of &quot;Call of Bones&quot; as<br/>\npreviously announced. The &quot;Call of Bones&quot; effect was placed on this item by<br/>\nmistake.<br/>\n<br/>\n- The Mempo of Likato now grants AC.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n- The Quest for the Short Sword of Morin has been fixed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n- Some spawn-time problems in Mistmoore have been repaired.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n- Five spawn-time problems were identified in regards to the Armor of Ro<br/>\n(Paladin) quests. They have been fixed and Paladins should have a much<br/>\neasier time of obtaining their armor.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Pets should now attack Willowisps on command.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n- Many spell-gems and icons have been changed to reflect the appropriate<br/>\naction of the spell. Be sure to reacquaint yourself with your spell line-up.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Fixed a bug that caused targetable bard songs to ignore the instrument in<br/>\nuse.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*Kerra Ridge*<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKerra Ridge has been completely revamped. The target level-range for the<br/>\nzone has been slightly increased. In addition, many new quests have been<br/>\nadded to the zone. The faction for Kerrans has been changed so that those<br/>\nwho killed them indiscriminately before today&#39;s update can take part. Be<br/>\nwarned that the Kerrans still do not like everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*Paw*<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPaw has received another minor difficulty adjustment. In addition, item drop<br/>\npercentages have been increased.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*The Plane of Hate*<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Plane of Hate has received an item-drop/spawn-time revamp. Take care in<br/>\nyour exploration of this zone as many things have changed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n- The EverQuest Team</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
