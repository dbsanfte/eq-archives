I played a mud where a god on there could<br/>\nnot only just kill people like this, but could decide that he would cast<br/>\nan AE spell continuously until everything was dead.  Yes, upsetting<br/>\nwhen we first experienced it, but oh that was soo much fun<br/>\nwhen we do win.<br/>\n<br/>\nTheory 1:<br/>\nPower is limited, even for gods.  Not even gods have unlimitd<br/>\ncharges of anything they want. <br/>\n<br/>\nTheory 2:<br/>\nPower is unlimited, but gods must abide by some fair fight rules<br/>\nset down before time was time.<br/>\n<br/>\nTheory 3:<br/>\nMake up your own reasoning so that it pleases you, don&#39;t use mine.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Think for a moment.  If CT *really* had a death touch, what<br/>\n&gt; would he do the moment he discovered mortals were messing<br/>\n&gt; around in his realm?  DT all of them.  Isn&#39;t that what *you&#39;d*<br/>\n&gt; do if you were playing CT?  If you want a balanced (i.e. fun)<br/>\n&gt; game, you can&#39;t go willy nilly giving mobs all sorts of<br/>\n&gt; super-powers.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>You were doing so well... then this paragraph.<br/>\n<br/>\n1.  Why have denizens if anytime anything comes you insta-kill?  let<br/>\nyour pets have some fun.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  Yes.  Stop giving these gods all sorts of god-like powers!  What<br/>\nare you thinking? *grin*<br/>\n<br/>\nLudvaraman --</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
