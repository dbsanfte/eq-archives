I just reached<br/>\n&gt; 8th level a few days ago and was curious about a few things.<br/>\n&gt; My bardess resides in Kelethin and the guild there only sells songs up to the<br/>\n&gt; 7th level song. I am curious as to where I would obtain the rest of the songs.<br/>\n&gt; Not sure where to start looking for them or if they are quests. The guild leader<br/>\n&gt; in Kelethin only gives out drums for four spiderling silks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I would like for the information either on the list or emailed to me directly<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks in advance,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kristin- Wood elf of Kelethin<br/>\n&gt; 8th level Bardess<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; _________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Get your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Show mom you love her.
