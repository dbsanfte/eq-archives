My original<br/>\ncharacter is a druid (I deliberately did not choose bard because<br/>\nmy friend, Windsong, was a bard and I _always_ fail when it comes<br/>\ndown to competitions between the two of us so I have learned just<br/>\nnot to compete.) And I can remember a time when I was proud to be<br/>\na druid. We were helpful, and generally considered a good group to<br/>\nrun across on the servers. The Druid&#39;s Grove rarely had a complainer<br/>\nin it and, rather, was people helping each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, everything as turned backwards. I&#39;ve even heard that druids aren&#39;t<br/>\nwelcome in groups because the general idea is that they have solo&#39;d their<br/>\nway through the levels, etc. (That doesn&#39;t effect me. I only play<br/>\nmy druid when my friend is around and I always play with her same-<br/>\nlevel monk. Then we see what else we can gather. But a lot of time<br/>\nits just the two of us.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt makes me quite sad to see how they have changed. I certainly have not<br/>\nchanged.<br/>\n<br/>\nSarah Heacock   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sarah@...\">sarah@...</a><br/>\nMeara, level 13 Enchanter, Master Jeweler, owner Meara&#39;s Boutique of<br/>\nMystiques, Phoenix, Solusek Ro /<br/>\nFaerain, level 18 Soldier of Tunare, Phoenix, Solusek Ro /<br/>\nFaesong, level 7 HalfElf Bard of Solusek Ro, Solusek Ro (Qeynos Hills)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
