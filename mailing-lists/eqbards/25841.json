I had it connected to my<br/>\nUSB port forever, and after installing the software, I had a configuration<br/>\nsetup for EQ rather quickly.  You can either assign keystrokes to a button<br/>\npress, or create macros.  The utility is very intuitive, with an image of<br/>\nthe controller and the area where you actually assign a function to the<br/>\nbutton.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe image helps you locate the button you&#39;re trying to set.  When you press<br/>\nthe button on the controller, the corresponding button on the image lights<br/>\nup, as well as the field where you actually set the value to the keypress.<br/>\n<br/>\nClick on the field, which gives a menu.  There are 2 important selections.<br/>\nAssign a key, or assign a macro.  If you click assign a key, it brings up a<br/>\nlittle window, you press the key you want assigned to that button, click ok,<br/>\nand it&#39;s set.  If you select assign a macro, it brings up a window.  In the<br/>\nname, you name the macro, so you know what it is.  You also have the option<br/>\nof saving the interval between key presses.  I disable this, although, with<br/>\na lot of trial and error, you could probably get some spectacular results.<br/>\nClick Start, and every keypress and release, until you click Stop, is<br/>\nrecorded.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, I created a macro for /pet attack.  I clicked the field for the<br/>\nbutton I wanted as the /pet attack button, and selected the option to create<br/>\na macro.  I named it &quot;Pet Attack&quot;, disabled the option to save the interval<br/>\nbetween keypresses, and clicked Start.  I then typed, &quot;&lt;enter&gt;/pet<br/>\nattack&lt;enter&gt;, and then clicked Stop.  End result, when I hit that key in<br/>\ngame, in less than a second, the typing bar comes up, &quot;/pet attack&quot; is typed<br/>\nin, and the command is executed...all without worrying about having a social<br/>\nset up.<br/>\n<br/>\nStarting on the top row of buttons, from left to right, I set button 1 with<br/>\nthe Pet Attack macro.  Buttons 2, 3, 4, and 5 activate gems 5, 6, 7, 8 (home<br/>\nposition, is the bottom row of keys).  Button 6 is auto attack, and buttons<br/>\n7, 8, 9, and 10 activate gems 1, 2, 3, and 4.<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t figured out a use for the throttle, the only rotary function I<br/>\nknow of is scrolling the chat box.  I have a wheel mouse, and am too used to<br/>\nusing that with it, but if you don&#39;t have a wheel mouse, you can probably<br/>\nassign chat scroll to it.  There is also a 8 way D-pad.  I only assigned up,<br/>\ndown, left, and right to the corresponding arrow keys, but you can also<br/>\nassign the diagonals.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is also a shift function.  Red shift, blue shift, and green shift.<br/>\nWhen you use the shift function, you can assign additional functions to a<br/>\nbutton that is already assigned.  Just like hitting shift and then 7 for &.<br/>\nI haven&#39;t messed with this much, either.<br/>\n<br/>\nBottom line, it feels completely different than the keyboard.  You have to<br/>\nget used to it.  I still fall back to the keyboard, if I get confused, and<br/>\nmess up my twist.  However, I&#39;m confident that once I get the hang of it,<br/>\nand get used to which gem spot is which key, it will blow away the keyboard.<br/>\nThis controller in the left hand, and the mouse in the right, it just feels<br/>\nright.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only ding, the D-pad is at the same time not sensitive enough, yet over<br/>\nsensitive.  It&#39;s hard to explain.  I feel like I have to press up<br/>\nexceptionally hard to move forward, yet it takes the slightest movement off<br/>\nof true to get enough pressure on left or right, and start to turn.<br/>\nPerhaps, another thing to get used to, but right now, it&#39;s a small irritant.<br/>\nThe only one.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also play Ghost Recon.  I haven&#39;t since setting up the controller, but I<br/>\nplan on it this weekend.  It was made for shooters, so I&#39;m looking forward<br/>\nto it.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAtonal<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Talies the Wanderer [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:snicker@...\">snicker@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, February 14, 2002 3:00 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] twisting 5, added note<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 02:52 PM 2/14/2002 -0500, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Hey, on a related note, now that we&#39;ve all presumably gotten used to the<br/>\n&gt;song timer, anyone else starting to find it useful?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Actually, I am - I do a lot of instrument switching, and the timer lets me <br/>\nestimate better when to switch.
