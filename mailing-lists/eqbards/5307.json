I know for a fact that the<br/>\nspeed/connection of you computer is important in determining your running<br/>\nspeed.  One night I went hunting a friend who was attempting to run the<br/>\ngame on a Pentium 150 with 32mb RAM and suffice to say she was insanely<br/>\nslow.  Heck my mage was moving faster than her walking then she (a<br/>\npaladin) was running.  So perhaps your connection was better or perhaps<br/>\nlike we all know SOW just rocks.  Speaking of which being a bard has<br/>\nspoiled way too much I think.
