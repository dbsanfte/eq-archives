The distance seems to be dependent on level and whether<br/>\nor not you&#39;re using a wind instrument.  It might&#39;ve been marginally useful<br/>\nas a group escape tool, except it teleports each group member to a<br/>\ndifferent random location.  It will not teleport you through walls or<br/>\nclosed doors.  It will place you at ground level.<br/>\n<br/>\nStrategies:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Useful for instantly coming down from high places, like the top of<br/>\n  the Aviak Village, or the wizard teleport site spires.<br/>\n<br/>\n- This used to be useful if you got dragged up a portcullis (Paw and<br/>\n  Permafrost), but they changed it so it doesn&#39;t work through walls<br/>\n  anymore.  Once you&#39;re dragged up, you have walls on both sides so<br/>\n  you won&#39;t teleport anywhere.  Still, it&#39;s worth a shot, especially<br/>\n  if you&#39;re not completely pulled up inside the portcullis.  Make sure<br/>\n  you disband from the rest of your party so they are not flung around.<br/>\n<br/>\n- It can function as a poor escape tool.  It could teleport you far<br/>\n  enough from the mobs that you have enough time to run for the zone<br/>\n  without being hit from behind.  Of course in the time it takes to<br/>\n  start this song, you could start Accelerando and accomplish the same<br/>\n  thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nCautions:<br/>\n<br/>\n- A good way to get your party members pissed off at you, since everyone<br/>\n  teleports to different locations.  Of course if that&#39;s your intent...<br/>\n<br/>\n- Generally a good way to get killed quickly.  I&#39;ve teleported right<br/>\n  into a full spawn of level 30ish goblins in Permafrost while trying<br/>\n  to get a friend unstuck.<br/>\n<br/>\n- The song will place you at ground level, which for bodies of water<br/>\n  means at the bottom.  If it&#39;s dark and/or the water is murky, you can<br/>\n  easily become disoriented and drown before reaching the surface.  So<br/>\n  make sure you consider this possibility if you&#39;re using it near water.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
