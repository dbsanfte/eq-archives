Hmm, this seems to be a day of rephrasing myself here<br/>\nand at work.  I understand that the programmers probably lost almost no time<br/>\nchanging this as opposed to something else.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy big question is.  They supposedly have these big &#39;Tuning&#39; meetings every<br/>\nweek to figure out what needs balancing in the game.  How on earth did they<br/>\ncome to the conclusion that this needed &#39;Tuning&#39; in the first place?  When<br/>\nwas the first time you ever heard casters as a whole, not by class or about<br/>\nclass, complain that &#39;Melee types have it way too easy, they rule this<br/>\ngame.&quot;  Answer, never, absolutely never.  Yet you hear the same thing about<br/>\ncasters in one form or another every single day if you read the boards.  The<br/>\nimbalance between pure casters and everyone else is so huge its embarrassing<br/>\nand yet no one at Verant will acknowledge it in any way.  They should have<br/>\nnamed the game Evercast if this is the way they really want it.  I can&#39;t<br/>\nfigure out if they are just so out of touch with the reality of the game due<br/>\nto their own arrogance that they can&#39;t see it, or if they just all play<br/>\ncasters primarily and don&#39;t really want it to be balanced.  Melee classes<br/>\nare really not much more than intelligent pets for casters as it currently<br/>\nstands.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had a philosophical discussion with three grouped Necros last nite about<br/>\njoining them in Sol A.  Once they found out I didn&#39;t have mana song they<br/>\nwere not interested in having me in a group.  They all said the same thing,<br/>\nyou won&#39;t really help much but you will reduce our xp.  My healing ability<br/>\nmeant next to nothing to them as they saw getting wounded as nothing more<br/>\nthan an opportunity to get the full effect from their Lifetap series.  I<br/>\nliterally had nothing to offer them.  Since our songs don&#39;t effect pets, and<br/>\nthey were the ones doing the meleeing, I couldn&#39;t help them.  The only<br/>\nlimitation to what they could handle was the hard 6 cap on resists.  Maybe<br/>\nthat&#39;s why I am so grouchy today.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Adam Wasserman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wassermana@...\">wassermana@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, March 23, 2000 1:08 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Here&#39;s one for the list to answer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Adam Wasserman&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wassermana@...\">wassermana@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile there are a great many things that they could be spending their time<br/>\non, look at it this way: Verant&#39;s staff is broken up into many tasks, so<br/>\nupdating this aspect of gameplay probably doesn&#39;t affect their ability to<br/>\nwork on the other broken areas in any way. In all likelihood, there is a<br/>\nspell database, which has a field entitled &quot;recast time&quot;. In order to<br/>\nfacilitate this change, all they need to do is hire someone to do data entry<br/>\nand have them update the spell database. This shouldn&#39;t take up any<br/>\nprogrammer&#39;s time.<br/>\n<br/>\nDraelon<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Kimes, Dean W.

(maybe because I play my<br/>\ncleric and not my bard now).<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes it really hurt us now that bufferes can chain cast their buffs?  It<br/>\nwas merely an annoyance  that you had to wait a few seconds for some<br/>\nbuffs to recycle.  I have no idea their system for cast time/recycle<br/>\ntime on buffs, its seems totally random and thrown together (that would<br/>\nbe a shocke eh?)<br/>\n<br/>\nExamples:  From lvl 9 to 19 cleric buffs are Holy Armor (lvl 4) and<br/>\nCenter.  At 19 you get Spirit Armor and Daring.  Center has a medium<br/>\nrecycle time and longer cast time then Holy armor.  However, Spirit<br/>\nArmor has a REALLY long cast and recycle time, yet daring is short in<br/>\nboth cases.  I guess I fail to see the need to limit the power of spirit<br/>\narmor (gives 12 ac)...<br/>\n--<br/>\nWe now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>\n<br/>\nMatt DeBarger<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nGET A NEXTCARD VISA, in 30 seconds!
