Or should I focus more on offense and sing <br/>\n&gt; warsong & bellow and<br/>\n&gt; occasionally hymn?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It depends on the mob. Mobs that knock me out of songs a lot (like skeletons<br/>\nand monks) force me to constantly change the order of my song playing. At<br/>\nall cost I keep warsong going, and as stunning allows I am doing some combo<br/>\nof Hymn/Bellow. Against blue skellies here is what I ended up doing:<br/>\n(about to pull)<br/>\nHymn<br/>\nWarsong<br/>\nBellow (to pull skellie)<br/>\nBellow (if I could fit it in)<br/>\n(Skellie has arrived)<br/>\nWarsong<br/>\nBellow <br/>\nBellow<br/>\nWarsong<br/>\nHymn <br/>\nBellow<br/>\n<br/>\nrepeat...<br/>\n<br/>\nbut it all depends on the race between my health bar and the skeletons.<br/>\nSometimes I risk a bit of defense (hymn) to get a lead by singing only<br/>\nwarsong/bellow.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hymn - during battle if no healer, between battles irregardless<br/>\n&gt; CoB - if caster heavy group and I&#39;m not tanking<br/>\n&gt; warsong - if caster heavy group and I am tanking<br/>\n&gt; anthem - melee heavy group<br/>\n&gt; CoD - in battle & with hymn if additional mobs show up and <br/>\n&gt; start picking on<br/>\n&gt; a caster, or when pulling to get a mobs attention faster, or <br/>\n&gt; in battle if<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve switched to my lute to heal someone<br/>\n&gt; Jig - between battles when you get a caster that swears it&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; affecting mana<br/>\n&gt; and you&#39;re too tired to argue.  Usually I&#39;ve got Lament in <br/>\n&gt; that spot anyway.<br/>\n&gt; I rarely use either.<br/>\n&gt; E Rhythms - in place of CoB in caster heavy groups where I&#39;m <br/>\n&gt; not tanking, in<br/>\n&gt; place of hymn otherwise.  CoB/Hymn would still be that third <br/>\n&gt; song I&#39;d try to<br/>\n&gt; fit in if possible.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So now where should Bellow be used?  And do you see anything <br/>\n&gt; drastically<br/>\n&gt; wrong with what I&#39;ve been doing?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Nope, expect there is no such word as &quot;irregardless&quot; (it&#39;s &quot;regardless&quot; or<br/>\n&quot;irrespective&quot; sorry, personal pet peeve :o). I would take the time to beat<br/>\ndown the casters on the jig thing though, that is one urban legend that has<br/>\nto die.<br/>\nIn a group I am only using Bellow once I have fulfilled my obligation to the<br/>\ngroup&#39;s well being with Anthem/Hymn. I sing hymn in battle always, but I<br/>\nhave been grouping with warriors/monks who can both taunt the mob off me, I<br/>\nam not sure what will happen in a caster group. But with as few hp as<br/>\ncasters have, I bet I have to sing it there as well. I have not had to sing<br/>\nJig yet at all (except while practicing swimming :o) I keep asking the<br/>\nwarriors and monks how they are doing on stamina, but no one reports<br/>\nproblems. If I get a PGT I will have to start using it, but I am thinking it<br/>\nwould be better to save up for an obsidian shard.<br/>\n<br/>\nTsengu<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
