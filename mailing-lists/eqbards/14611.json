I currently am testing it in place <br/>\nof my second ykesha... proc rate seems about the same as ykesha, but the <br/>\npoison is pretty slow.  I like the +5 dex, and the weight in my offhand <br/>\nisn&#39;t appreciably draining my stamina except in really really long fights. <br/>\nThe delay is a bit much, so I think soon I&#39;ll go back to my dual ykesha.  <br/>\nThe graphic is rather plain - looks like the Crystalline Blade (more of a <br/>\nlongish short sword than a long sword).<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
