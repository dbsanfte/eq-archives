I think a lot of people start a<br/>\ntwink and decide they don&#39;t like it etc.  This is especially true for the<br/>\nharder classes (PARTICULARLY Bards) where they get to a certain level - and<br/>\ngive up...  I know a lot of people that say &quot;Wow Bards are cool - I&#39;m gonna<br/>\nstart a bard twink&quot;.

I didn&#39;t know about that option.  I&#39;ll start recording stats<br/>\nduring prime-time and see what shakes out.  I was concerned that off-peak<br/>\nhours might skew numbers towards more soloable classes, until I saw how many<br/>\nenchanters there were :-o<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve never met anyone who could solo an enchanter after 20th level.<br/>\n<br/>\n        Kit<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Daniel P.
