Playing at the more quiet times it&#39;s difficult to find<br/>\nanyone at all inside there when I&#39;m on so I&#39;ve got no knowledge!<br/>\n<br/>\nCan anyone gimme a few hints about where and how tough the Solusek<br/>\nMage and the Solusek Champion are.  An opinion of how frequent the<br/>\nspawn and drops are would be helpful too ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks muchly!<br/>\n<br/>\nPS Hi to Shada, who I met in person last night while on my first Hill<br/>\nGiant hunting trip!
