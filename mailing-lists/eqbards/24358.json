Within an hour of getting<br/>\ninto EQ again, my guild gave me a small gift:  a red scale and a white<br/>\nscale.  So I managed to finish my Epic Saturday afternoon!  Getting the<br/>\nwhite scale last means you make three trade-ins in a row; pretty<br/>\nnervewracking if you ask me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI knew we had some red scales in our vault.  My guild leader traded a<br/>\nVelious haste cloak for the white scale.  I have no idea where he found<br/>\none; I had assumed that every white scale on Innoruuk had been sucked up<br/>\nalready.  He wasn&#39;t on to say.  I doubt it was from Gorenaire, since the<br/>\nonly guilds capable of killing Gorenaire have Bards who still need them,<br/>\nand I&#39;ve heard nothing about the Scalegiver dropping whites.  Maybe a<br/>\npickup Vox raid.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, it&#39;s very cool.  As a mostly melee Bard (blasphemy to some of<br/>\nyou, I know), this is a big improvement right across the board.  And I<br/>\nactually managed to raise Brass Instruments twice today singing a Brass<br/>\nsong in combat!<br/>\n<br/>\n3.5 blue bubbles in 5 hours in Sebilis.  We rocked.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado &lt;Silent Justice&gt;, 57 songs, Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
