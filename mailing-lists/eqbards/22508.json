Was it Absor<br/>\n&gt; who posted the reply?  Or was it JM Capozzi (who we all <br/>\n&gt; thought was a Verant<br/>\n&gt; insider for a long time)?   <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Make of this what you will. Personally, I think that the <br/>\n&gt; first poster turned<br/>\n&gt; out to be a bit more correct in his predictions than the guy <br/>\n&gt; who answered<br/>\n&gt; him.  And the scary thing is that the guy who answered him <br/>\n&gt; has since shed<br/>\n&gt; his &quot;guise of the deceiver&quot; and is now a VI employee.  I <br/>\n&gt; really like the<br/>\n&gt; part about bards being able to heal more than clerics <br/>\n&gt; &lt;snicker&gt;. It just<br/>\n&gt; does not work that way in how this game gets played. To be <br/>\n&gt; fair - he may not<br/>\n&gt; have had much experience beyond level 45 at that point and <br/>\n&gt; with only &quot;old<br/>\n&gt; world&quot; zones - certainly does not seem to consider the <br/>\n&gt; current use of a main<br/>\n&gt; tank and complete heal that most everyone uses in combat. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sylly<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; p.s. 1500 of the 1659 items are from June, July, August & <br/>\n&gt; September of &#39;99 -<br/>\n&gt; the &quot;good ole days.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt; with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -------------------------- eGroups Sponsor <br/>\n&gt; -------------------------~-~&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Create your business web site your way now at Bigstep.com.<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s the fast, easy way to get online, to promote your business,<br/>\n&gt; and to sell your products and services.
