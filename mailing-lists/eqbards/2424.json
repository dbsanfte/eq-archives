Last night, I<br/>\nsaw a bard playing a song that I thought I had never seen before. I<br/>\nfound out that it was Selo&#39;s, but it looked different than when I play<br/>\nSelo&#39;s. It had the white pulsing flashes, but it also had small purple<br/>\nlights or something. When does Selo&#39;s start to look different? Anyone<br/>\nknow?<br/>\n<br/>\nMandibal<br/>\nBard from Qeynos<br/>\nCazic-Thule<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, one last thing - about the Heartstone Saga. I am trying to get<br/>\ninvolved in this. I e-mailed the guy who made the post to eqvault (from<br/>\nthe Hand of Chaos), and he has yet to respond to me. Does anyone have<br/>\nany info on the Heaststone Saga on Cazic-Thule. Information I am<br/>\nlooking for is how do I get involved, and how do I get my guild<br/>\ninvolved.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
