But the strangest thing is that<br/>\n&gt; they<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t immediately kill me, and only particular guards are aggressive to me<br/>\n&gt; (like<br/>\n&gt; one guard with ONE name, maybe two).  I was standing around for awhile, and<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; think perhaps whatever I had attacked might have been drawn to guards and<br/>\n&gt; done<br/>\n&gt; its little area effect damage thing, though it was off at the time.  But<br/>\n&gt; what<br/>\n&gt; puzzles me is the fact that I will return to guard area, after no combat and<br/>\n&gt; healing up for up to 5 mins, and a guard will come and lop my head off for<br/>\n&gt; no<br/>\n&gt; particular reason.  I am definitely reporting it as a bug, the same thing<br/>\n&gt; happened to my monk when he attacked an orc near guards.  (&quot;Guard says:&quot;Time<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; die an orc raider&quot; Guard slashes you for 100 damage You die).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Laeaus<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;J.M.

I used the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; first<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;level attack song alternating it mainly with the level 2 buff song when<br/>\n&gt; &gt; fighting<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;in and around my home town of Kelethin.  Occasionally, when I run back to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; town<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;(NEVER still singing my attack song), a guard will kill me for no<br/>\n&gt; apparent<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;reason.  Maybe it thinks I attacked another PC if he or she happened to<br/>\n&gt; run<br/>\n&gt; &gt; by,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;but I really don&#39;t know.  I fear that I have lost faction with my town,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; though I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;receive no messages about it.  Shopkeepers now look at me apprehensively,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; except<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;for my guild of course.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  Anyway, on to my question.  How much does a diety effect your actual<br/>\n&gt; &gt; abilities<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;and inter-race relations?  I play a Wood Elf bard, and have enjoyed it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; immensly,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;but chose my diety as Tunare for fear of fraction problems.  I roleplay<br/>\n&gt; my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;character as a romantic, so naturally Erolisi Marr (sp?) seems like a<br/>\n&gt; good<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;choice, but I am unsure of it&#39;s effects on others.  Would love to hear<br/>\n&gt; from<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;another bard who has tried more than one diety perhaps.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Laeaus, Wood Elf Bard level...(sigh)...3<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Get involved.
