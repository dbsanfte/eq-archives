The bard petition that was submitted a<br/>\nfew weeks back requested that Verant add magical instruments but so far the<br/>\nbattle drum is the only one in the game.  I have never heard of a harp<br/>\nexisting in the game but I haven&#39;t been in the bards guild since the last<br/>\npatch so don&#39;t know if it has been added or not.

Like a harp found on a creature would mean that healing went up<br/>\n&gt; higher than using a mandolin.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
