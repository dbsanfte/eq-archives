If you want to get a reasonably good<br/>\napproximation of what % something drops, you need a number of tests one<br/>\norder of magnitude higher than the range.  So if its 5% you need at least<br/>\n200 tests for statistical accuracy.  This isn&#39;t necessarily true for all<br/>\nrandoms, but for psuedo-random numbers such as computers produce, it is<br/>\ngenerally the applicable rule.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Ryan Honeyman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:honeyman@...\">honeyman@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, January 25, 2000 2:25 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Deepwater Gobs<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Ryan Honeyman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:honeyman@...\">honeyman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I would have to agree with the previous poster that in Oasis, we were<br/>\n </span></blockquote>seeing<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; about 1 helm every 5 gobs or so... Maybe the drop rate is MUCH lower in<br/>\n&gt; Rathe?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  No, thats not it.  The monster table that Verant uses says<br/>\n  that a DW goblin will drop a helm X % of the time.  Because you<br/>\n  happened to get a helm 1 out of 5, doesnt mean the next time a<br/>\n  helm did drop it wouldn&#39;t have come maybe on the 20th one?  I got<br/>\n  my helm on the first DW goblin I killed.  It took me well over<br/>\n  20 griffennes to get a charm the first time.  The second time I got it<br/>\n  on the third try.  It&#39;s the way statistics work.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nFREE ADVICE FROM REAL PEOPLE!
