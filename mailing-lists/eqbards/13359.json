I made 800pp there one day last week<br/>\n(total was about 1700pp but the rest went to group members).  <br/>\nThe biggest problem I had was with a couple people in another<br/>\ngroup didn&#39;t like that I was killing &quot;all&quot; the giants in the<br/>\narea, and were deliberately dropping by where I was charming<br/>\ngiants and taking one of my giants back to their group.  I<br/>\nwent and had a talk with them.  Apparently, even though I<br/>\nmaxed out my charisma when I created my character, I&#39;m<br/>\nsupposed to fight these giants in straight melee.  *sigh* They<br/>\nsaid more giants spawned in the area I was at.  I told them I<br/>\nwas keeping the area near me clear of trash mobs (with the<br/>\nimplication they weren&#39;t, which was causing more giants to<br/>\nspawn in my area).  They accused me of being greedy taking two<br/>\ngiants to their one.  I said that didn&#39;t make sense since they<br/>\ntook time to find one giant, and I took twice as much time to<br/>\nfind two giants.  Maybe these arguments will come in handy to<br/>\nyou folks if someone accuses you of the same.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, yesterday I was doing great - made about 400pp in 3<br/>\nhours.  Then while running, turning to avoid some other giant<br/>\nfighters, and switching to my weapons to finish off a giant<br/>\nwith melee, I DROPPED MY MISTMOORE DRUM!!!  :(<br/>\n<br/>\nI spent 15 minutes looking for it afterwards (I killed the<br/>\ngiant with one hit, so it turns out there wasn&#39;t even any need<br/>\nfor me to have been running from it while switching to<br/>\nweapons).  Never found it, and I figured it had decayed by<br/>\nthen.  :(  I realize now that I was looking for a bag on the<br/>\nground when I should&#39;ve been looking for a small flute.  <br/>\nDidn&#39;t help that it was nighttime either.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel so slow...  :(<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
