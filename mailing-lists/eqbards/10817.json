That NPC has been seen on our server exactly 2 <br/>\ntimes.<br/>\n<br/>\nBilge in the Cauldron has been seen once on our server.<br/>\n<br/>\n3 days of solid camping on that island in OOT yielded that stupid bird.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe killed enough griffennes to get 4 charms in north karana, and in the time <br/>\nit took to do that never saw Zahal.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe cleric quests are almost impossible not because of the level of NPC <br/>\nrequired to kill them but because of the rarity of the NPC&#39;s that carry the <br/>\nitems required.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far the longest I&#39;ve specifically camped an item was the icy greaves. <br/>\nThat took 2 and a half hours.  So far my cleric has spent at least 4 hours <br/>\non each of the items required for his armor.  I don&#39;t envy the clerics for <br/>\nthis quest, that&#39;s for sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nLuckily my cleric friend has pretty much given up on the quests and doesn&#39;t <br/>\nbitch about it non stop anymore. He&#39;s not even going to try to get the <br/>\nbreastplate, the one piece he can&#39;t get because Bilge won&#39;t spawn, and he&#39;s <br/>\ngiven up on the bracers because that stupid ghoul in NK won&#39;t spawn either.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnthem Dirgemaker<br/>\nLevel 43 Bard of Qeynos<br/>\nSolusek Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
