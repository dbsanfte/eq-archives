Is Absor also referring to Psalm<br/>\nof warmth and cooling?  They have &quot;damage shields&quot;, not damage absorption<br/>\nshields.  If the Psalms are being nerfed I&#39;ll be pretty pissed... I like<br/>\nthe damage shields.  I would like to assume that Absor is refering to ONLY<br/>\ndamage absorption shields but assuming something that Verant does only<br/>\nmakes and ass out of you and me.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Steve<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 09:31 PM 10/31/00 -0500, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/027658.html\">http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/027658.html</a> :<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Absor:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&quot;I have some information about changes we will be making to a few bard<br/>\n&gt;songs with the next patch.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Songs with a damage shield component will have that component removed.<br/>\n&gt;Pixie Strike will have its secondary resist reduced.<br/>\n&gt;Song of Twilight will be singable at any time of the day.

These songs aren&#39;t so great though, and it would have<br/>\n&gt;been nice if something had been added to them.

Not sure what that means.<br/>\n&gt;As far as I can remember off the top of my head, the only single target<br/>\n&gt;song that isn&#39;t self-only is Jonathan&#39;s Provocation, which I have rarely<br/>\n&gt;used, but it was useful to use it on other targets sometimes.  It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;hardly useful to use it on myself.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Mostly good, I guess, if the secondary resist for Pixie Strike is low<br/>\n&gt;enough.  Of course, I&#39;m long past using the song.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Kenross Cantoforjado, 54 songs, Innoruuk </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
