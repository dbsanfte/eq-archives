It aggrivates me to no end to see twinked players <br/>\n&gt; because obviously it&#39;s not fair to the rest of us who actually work our <br/>\n&gt; behinds off for what we have, but also because I feel they&#39;re missing out <br/>\n&gt; in part of the game completely. I felt great when I was able to afford <br/>\n&gt; buying that last piece to my banded armor set. I didn&#39;t get to do that <br/>\n&gt; until after level 10. Yet I see people level 5 walking around with pieces <br/>\n&gt; (or complete sets) of plate armor. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I guess it&#39;s all a matter of perspective. I read the above and can&#39;t<br/>\nhelp thinking you don&#39;t know how easy you had it. When I was starting<br/>\nout, no one on our server was making banded until I was L16. I already<br/>\nhad a partial set of store bought chain when the first pieces of banded<br/>\nstarted coming out of the first smith&#39;s forge but at L10 I was still in<br/>\nleather. And the first banded was expensive. Larger pieces weren&#39;t even<br/>\nsold for the first few weeks of production, they were only available if<br/>\nyou had store bought chain to trade in on it. (yes the first smith on<br/>\nour server made a fortune) So in a way, I guess I consider characters<br/>\nwho can afford full banded at L10 and full bronze before L20 to be<br/>\ntwinks as well, not twinked by people, but twinked by the badly designed<br/>\neconomy that has made banded sell for barely over the cost of production<br/>\nand bronze sell for a slight premium over banded, pushing the price of<br/>\nbanded even lower.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
