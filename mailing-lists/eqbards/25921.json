Then we noticed that<br/>\nsomething was draining our mana!  And then, it would<br/>\nnot go away!  We were lucky to be in a spot without<br/>\npatrollers or respawn.  But we had no mana and no way<br/>\nto regen it.<br/>\n<br/>\nEventually, we heard from friends in another guild<br/>\n(thanks Ashen Vendetta!) that if you turn off NPC<br/>\nspells and use a &quot;clickie&quot; (jboots, telescope, armor<br/>\nitem with an effect) your mana bar would refresh.  We<br/>\nalso had to camp out and come back with NPC spells off<br/>\nto block the effect from coming back.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s my impression that the curse was hitting thru<br/>\nwalls due to some bug not feature. Dunno - but if you<br/>\ngo to Ssra and deleve in deeper - NPC spells off and<br/>\nperhaps re-camp to make sure you don&#39;t get cursed and<br/>\nmana drained.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe that&#39;s old news - I been lurkin&#39;!~  But I hope<br/>\nthat helps.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\nSee you online,<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly/Duvessa/etal<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
