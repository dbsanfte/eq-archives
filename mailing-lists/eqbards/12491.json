They just buff you up some, especially getting their<br/>\n&gt;&gt; damage shield, then heal you while you fight reds.  My friend shot up<br/>\n&gt;&gt; his guildmate from 8-12 in a few hours...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  My point is with a bard you dont just click one button to do something.<br/>\n&gt;  Powerleveling a bard is useless, if they dont know what they are doing.<br/>\n&gt;  Most bards I see don&#39;t know what they are doing anyway.  (ie: bellow)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  With clerics, it&#39;s easy - they heal.  With wizards, it&#39;s easy - the<br/>\n&gt;  blast.  Powerleveling a class who has to adapt and think is much more<br/>\n&gt;  difficult, which was the thing I was getting at.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Harmonic.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Hey Freelancers:  Find your next project through JobSwarm!<br/>\n&gt;  You can even make money in your sleep by referring friends.<br/>\n&gt;&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm1\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm1</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n </span></blockquote>with the subject submissions.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;========================================================================<br/>\n&gt;To UNSUBSCRIBE from this community, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt;  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards-unsubscribe@onelist.com\">eqbards-unsubscribe@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;and reply to the confirmation email we send you.<br/>\n&gt;========================================================================<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
