I have to say the <br/>\nwide open spaces are nice, zoned into West Karana and I was the only one <br/>\nthere :)  The highest level Bard I have seen (via /w bard all) has been 18th <br/>\nlevel. Anyone else out there playing a Bard on Test?  Would be nice to have <br/>\na partner, I am currently 5th level and in the Qeynos area.<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn Swiftsong - Karana server<br/>\nMaster Brewer of Societus Argenti<br/>\nAmerginn - Test server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
