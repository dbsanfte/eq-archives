Denon&#39;s <br/>\ntends to use all of your mana in one shot - mana-improving items don&#39;t <br/>\nappear to matter there.  SSS slowly eats your mana while charming <br/>\ncreatures.   One thing of note:  Bards are completely unaffected by any <br/>\nsort of mana-refreshing or buffing song or spell. In other words, Breeze, <br/>\nClarity, etc. have no effect on Bards.  It&#39;s a small sacrifice for having <br/>\n99 percent of our songs mana-free.<br/>\n<br/>\nTalies the Wanderer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
