Happy Holidays to everyone!<br/>\n<br/>\nNo Personal Delivery of Presents for World&#39;s Children From Santa This Year<br/>\nAssociated Press<br/>\n<br/>\nNORTH POLE (AP) -- In a startling announcement, Santa Claus has sent word <br/>\nthat he will not be delivering presents personally this year as he has had <br/>\nno time to prepare for his annual holiday ride. &quot;Santa hasn&#39;t been training <br/>\nthis year like he usually does for the big day,&quot; says an elf who asked for <br/>\nanonymity. He went on to state that ever since Santa Claus started playing <br/>\nEverquest┬« , a popular online role playing game distributed by Sony Online <br/>\nEntertainment Inc, he has not had the time nor the inclination to work out <br/>\nin the off-season.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;We are all very concerned about Santa, however, in an effort to ensure <br/>\nthat each child still receives their presents, we have signed an exclusive <br/>\ncontract with Federal Express, stated Jingle Elf, the official spokesman <br/>\nfor Santa Corp.<br/>\n<br/>\nChildren around the world seemed to take the news indifferently. &quot;As long <br/>\nas I get my Playstation 2,&quot; stated Samuel, age 12, &quot;Santa can do what he <br/>\nwants. It&#39;s not like we ever get to see him anyway.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I see Santa in Norrath all the time. We have a PoM raid this weekend,&quot; <br/>\nstates Frank, age 16. He further explained that Santa&#39;s &quot;leet enchanter <br/>\nrocks&quot; and that Santa&#39;s guild consisted of only &quot;dark elves&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
