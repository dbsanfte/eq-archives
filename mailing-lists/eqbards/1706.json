Most people<br/>\nhave their minds made up and nothing anyone is going to say will likely<br/>\nchange anyone else&#39;s mind..<br/>\n<br/>\nNext I&#39;d like to point out - that I am uncomfortable with the idea the<br/>\nPowergaming vs. role-playing is an either-or-situation.  I see them as two<br/>\nextremes with most people (like myself) in the middle.  I think talking with<br/>\n&quot;thees&quot; and &quot;thous&quot; is silly (you are arbitrarily picking a period of speech<br/>\nwhich is way after the medieval period anyway!  The people that talk that<br/>\nway sound more like Pilgrims than Beowulf if you ask me!)  Also - if things<br/>\nare slow - I like to talk to people OOC - find out where they are from what<br/>\nthey do for a living, etc<br/>\n<br/>\nI started the week the game out and I&#39;m at level 15...  I do NOT consider<br/>\nmyself a power-gamer.  I kind of consider the way I play<br/>\nreverse-role-playing in a sense - my character becomes and extension of my<br/>\nown personality etc.  I DO believe in playing the game the way the designers<br/>\nmeant it to be played.  I take no pre-conceived notions of what a bard<br/>\nshould be except what is presented to me by the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the one hand  I see no reason not to wear Plate and eventually I&#39;m sure I<br/>\nwill.  On the other hand - I don&#39;t see it as an end to end to itself.  I&#39;m<br/>\nnot going to rush to try to be the first level 50 bard wearing a full set of<br/>\nmagic plate (or whatever) on my server.  I won&#39;t even care if I&#39;m the last.<br/>\nI also don&#39;t write songs or poems for the game.  I hardly have enough time<br/>\nto write songs for my real-life band (the professional not ammeter type).<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay - with all that said - I&#39;d like to change this conversation a bit.<br/>\nWe&#39;ve agreed to disagree (well, I have at least).  But what isn&#39;t clear to<br/>\nme in most of the conversations by those against plate - whether you are<br/>\nsaying YOU won&#39;t wear plate - Vs NO ONE should wear plate - i.e. Verant<br/>\nshould change the code of the game to not allow ANY bards to wear plate.  If<br/>\nthat is your opinion - please state it and explain why.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not a flamer - I am genuinely interested in your side of the issue and<br/>\nam curious to hear the arguments.<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde of Xegony<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:David.Lynam@...\">David.Lynam@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, June 09, 1999 3:31 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Bards N Plate and people&#39;s opinions<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:David.Lynam@...\">David.Lynam@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From what I&#39;ve seen the bards in Everquest are nothing like the &quot;bards&quot;<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; the celtic tribes as you describe them here.  The bards of everquest<br/>\ntravel,<br/>\n&gt; sing songs, and play instruments.  They are in fact travelling musicians,<br/>\n&gt; which you said the celts were not.  I could handle bards wearing chain in<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; roleplay situation, however, not plate.  This is my opinion, and I feel<br/>\nboth </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
