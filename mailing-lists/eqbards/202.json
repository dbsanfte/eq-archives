That&#39;s the only difference I&#39;ve heard of.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for money, you should be taking out the orc raiders left and right and<br/>\n8th. This should supply a decent income. Another thing you might consider<br/>\nis heading cross country to The Lair of Splitpaw  (Paw dungeon). It&#39;s<br/>\ngeared for levels 5 to 15 and is a great source of experience and income.<br/>\n<br/>\nTaelin, Songweaver of Kelethin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:slide@...\">slide@...</a> on 04/23/99 01:42:45 PM<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease respond to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nTo:   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\ncc:    (bcc: Terry Chlebek/DPT)<br/>\n<br/>\nSubject:  [eqbards] Hello and Question<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    Hello all - I just discovered this board!  I am a half-elf Bard on<br/>\n    Xegony.  I have been operating in the Freeport areas mostly - and hope<br/>\n    to start some travelling in the near future...<br/>\n<br/>\n    I JUST made level 8 and have a few questions.  Since I just made 8 and<br/>\n    can develop String Instruments - should I sell my drum after getting<br/>\n    the lute?  Is there any need for both?  (Obviously a concern is<br/>\n    carrying slots).  Is there a difference between  the lute and the<br/>\n    mandolin?<br/>\n<br/>\n    Lastly - I am always short of money.  Most of my money goes to songs<br/>\n- my armor is pretty thin.  Any suggestions for making money.<br/>\n<br/>\n    I apologize if these questions have been answered many times before<br/>\n- as I am new to the list.  If there is a searchable archive somewhere -<br/>\nplease point me there!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde<br/>\nAKA Dan Sniderman<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;<br/>\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;<br/>\n&lt;META content=&quot;text/html; charset=iso-8859-1&quot; http-equiv=Content-Type&gt;<br/>\n&lt;META content=&quot;MSHTML 5.00.2614.3401&quot; name=GENERATOR&gt;<br/>\n&lt;STYLE&gt;&lt;/STYLE&gt;<br/>\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;<br/>\n&lt;BODY bgColor=#ffffff&gt;<br/>\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello all - I just<br/>\ndiscovered this board!&nbsp; I am a half-elf Bard&nbsp;on Xegony.&nbsp; I<br/>\nhave been operating in the Freeport areas mostly - and hope to start some<br/>\ntravelling in<br/>\nthe near future...&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;<br/>\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;<br/>\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I JUST made level 8 and<br/>\nhave a&nbsp;few questions.&nbsp; Since I just made 8 and can develop String<br/>\nInstruments - should I sell my drum after getting the lute?&nbsp; Is there<br/>\nany need for both?&nbsp; (Obviously a concern is carrying slots).&nbsp; Is<br/>\nthere a difference between  the lute and the mandolin?&nbsp; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;<br/>\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;<br/>\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly - I am always short<br/>\nof money.&nbsp; Most of my money goes to songs - my armor is pretty<br/>\nthin.&nbsp; Any<br/>\nsuggestions for making money.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;<br/>\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;<br/>\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I apologize if these<br/>\nquestions have been answered many times before - as I am new to the<br/>\nlist.&nbsp; If there is a searchable archive somewhere - please point me<br/>\nthere!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;<br/>\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;<br/>\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;Thanks&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;<br/>\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;<br/>\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;Slyde&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;<br/>\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;AKA Dan Sniderman&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
