I<br/>\n&gt; try not to die as much as possible, but I have an affinity for dying in the<br/>\n&gt; hell levels... A LOT.  I&#39;ve never seen more then a 3/4 of a bubble of lost<br/>\n&gt; XP each time and usually it is lot less than that.  I was originally told<br/>\n&gt; that whole bubbles are at 31 but I&#39;m beginning to think that is a tale used<br/>\n&gt; to scare children away from the 30&#39;s :-).   Then again, the concept of<br/>\n&gt; random XP loss certainly seems to make a lot of sense as well.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Taneran Dreamweaver<br/>\n&gt; &lt;Clan Jax&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Bard of the 35th song<br/>\n&gt; Prexus<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: Eric Boller &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eboller@...\">eboller@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, January 04, 2000 7:53 AM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqbards] Re: Exp loss for dying<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Eric Boller &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eboller@...\">eboller@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I noticed a similar thing this weekend as well.  I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 30th level now.  However, I died twice in level 29<br/>\n&gt; &gt; while approaching 30.  Neither time did I lose more<br/>\n&gt; &gt; than a quarter bubble of health.  In level 30 I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; &gt; died twice and I think I&#39;ve lossed maybe an eighth of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a bubble each time.  Has anyone died lately that isn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in a hell level?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thex Luteslinger<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 30th level bard<br/>\n&gt; &gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Talk to your friends online with Yahoo!
