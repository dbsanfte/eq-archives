The live servers have been updated to reflect the newest data on<br/>\nthe Test Server:<br/>\n<br/>\n*General*<br/>\n<br/>\n- Some new spells are available for the hybrid classes.  Check your Kunark<br/>\nspell vendors.<br/>\n- Found and corrected a problem causing people to fall to their deaths upon<br/>\nzoning.  The majority of these issues should no longer occur.<br/>\n- Corrected outstanding issues with several quests, including the Brain<br/>\nBite, Shackle of Rock, and the Barnal Flamehands quest.<br/>\n- Increased treasure in many Kunark zones including The Emerald Jungle,<br/>\nSebilis, and the Frontier Mountains.<br/>\n- Upon review we&#39;ve increased the drop-rate of level 51+ spells in Kunark.<br/>\nThey should be more plentiful now. <br/>\n- Updated pathing information in many zones, making it easier for pets and<br/>\nother NPCs to get around the zones.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Items*<br/>\n<br/>\n- A problem with the spell effect for the Luminary Two-Handed Sword.<br/>\nCurrent owners of this weapon will need to contact a GM to trade their sword<br/>\nout for a working one.<br/>\n- The Gunthak Harpoon is now rentable. It will remain in your possession<br/>\nwhen you leave the game.<br/>\n- A couple pieces of Blood Ember armor have been reduced in weight.<br/>\n- Reduced the weight on several Monk weapons found in Kunark.<br/>\n<br/>\n*PvP Teams Servers (VZ/TZ) and Illusions*<br/>\n<br/>\nDue to an outstanding bug that allowed a player to permanently mesmerize or<br/>\nstun opposing team members when coupled with an illusion, illusions will now<br/>\nautomatically cancel when the person wearing the illusion casts an offensive<br/>\nspell upon any player-character.  Players should keep this in mind before<br/>\nattacking with spells in an area where their faction standing is less than<br/>\ndesirable.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIllusions are defined as any spell that makes a character look different<br/>\nthan they actually are.  This includes all racial illusions, as well as<br/>\nother illusions such as Treeform, Wolfform, and the Call of Bones series.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*Risk and Reward*<br/>\n<br/>\nThe concept of risk and reward is very important to the game of EverQuest.<br/>\nIdeally, situations that provide a greater reward should also provide<br/>\nsubstantial risk.  Over the past several weeks, we&#39;ve been identifying areas<br/>\nin game where risk and reward are at a disparity, and making necessary<br/>\nadjustments. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn most cases, those adjustments are in favor of increasing the reward for a<br/>\nspecific action.  For example, we recently increased the experience awarded<br/>\nin many Kunark zones to offset the sometimes-considerable risk associated<br/>\nwith adventuring there.  We also do this quite frequently by increasing the<br/>\nreward associated with a quest by enhancing the item, as we did last week<br/>\nwith the Burning Rapier quest.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, in some cases there are instances where reward is far in excess of<br/>\nthe risk involved, and we will be correcting these issues like those above<br/>\nas we come across them.  For example, there are many cases where a solitary<br/>\nand stationary outdoor creature has a &quot;fast spawn&quot;, yielding the reward of<br/>\nfast experience-gain without the commensurate risk.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThough it is not our policy to announce changes to individual NPCs, we did<br/>\nwant to let you will see risk/reward disparities corrected over the next<br/>\nseveral weeks.<br/>\n<br/>\n*PvP Teams (VZ/TZ) Character Transfers*<br/>\n<br/>\nAs many people playing upon the PvP-Teams servers are aware, Vallon Zek and<br/>\nTallon Zek have different rules regarding looting rights from PvP combat.<br/>\nVallon Zek allows the victor to loot all coin plus one item from the fallen,<br/>\nwhereas Tallon Zek allows only coin-loot with no right to loot items.<br/>\n<br/>\nDue to the fact that the looting rules were changed on Tallon Zek<br/>\npost-production, we&#39;ve decided to allow characters on both servers a<br/>\none-time character-move.  Registration for the move will open at 6:00pm PDT<br/>\non Friday, June 9th, 2000, on both servers, and will be open through 12:00pm<br/>\nPDT on Monday, June 12th, 2000.  You can register for the move by executing<br/>\nthe &quot;/movelog yes&quot; command during the registration window.  There is no<br/>\nlimit to the number of people that we will allow to move between Tallon and<br/>\nVallon Zek, so there is no reason to rush to enter the command.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease remember that once you register for the move, your decision can not<br/>\nbe rescinded.  The actual character-move will take place sometime next week,<br/>\nat a time to be announced later.  Please keep in mind that corpses are not<br/>\nmoved in a character-move, so we&#39;d recommend against leaving unclaimed<br/>\ncorpses around after Monday of next week if you&#39;ve asked to be moved. <br/>\n<br/>\nQuestions about the move process will be addressed in the Gameplay Message<br/>\nForum available via www.everquest.com.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n- The EverQuest Team<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nNever lose a file again.
