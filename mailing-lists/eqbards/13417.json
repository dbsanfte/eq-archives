Boo hoo hoo.  It seems<br/>\n&gt; some people aren&#39;t happy unless they have something to complain about.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hey!  I was complaining about them taking away surfing well before they actually did it!  They kept saying<br/>\nthey were going to &quot;fix&quot; it, and I&#39;ve been feedbacking it for a month saying I didn&#39;t want it to happen.<br/>\nSo I&#39;m allowed!  For those who care, don&#39;t get your hopes up that they&#39;ll take it out.  For them to go<br/>\nthrough all the effort to fix it in the first place suggests that they really think that this graphic is a<br/>\nlot better.  No accounting for taste, is there?<br/>\n<br/>\nMeditation is very cool, btw.  Not so much for the death part, since it usually takes awhile for a rez<br/>\nanyway, but more for the ability to switch songs during (and in between) combat.  In Sol B, if I wanted to<br/>\nchange my song list, and started to mem a new song just after one fight was done, we were often halfway<br/>\nthrough the next fight before I could finish a single song remem.  That&#39;s going to be a lot better now.<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 40 songs, Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
