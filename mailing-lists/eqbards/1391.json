I used a combine long sword<br/>\n(28 delay) and swung 20 times (after the very first swing which<br/>\ncounted as 0) and ran each test twice.<br/>\n<br/>\n- With no songs going, 20 swings took 56 seconds, which confirms what<br/>\nsomeone said earlier about the delay representing tenths of seconds<br/>\nof delay.<br/>\n<br/>\n- With Anthem as my only song, 20 swings took 51 seconds, or<br/>\naproximately a 10% decrease in delay.<br/>\n<br/>\n- With just Whistling Warsong going, 20 swings took 48 seconds, or<br/>\naproximately a 15% decrease in delay.<br/>\n<br/>\n- With both Anthem and Warsong going, 20 swings still took 48<br/>\nseconds, indicating they do not stack in terms of cutting down on<br/>\nyour delay any further.  You do still get a STR boost from each song.<br/>\n<br/>\nBased on this, I&#39;m now no longer going to bother stacking both songs,<br/>\nand when solo I&#39;ll likely twist Warsong with Bellow and Healing.  In<br/>\ngroups I&#39;ll do Anthem instead of Warsong.  I am going to test this<br/>\none more time on a weapon with a greater delay just to be 100% sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nTigsen<br/>\n15th level bard on Innoruuk<br/>\n_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
