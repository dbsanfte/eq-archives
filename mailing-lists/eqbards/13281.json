The<br/>\nproblem with Shamen is that we don&#39;t get pets until 34 so we tend to forget<br/>\nthat we have to watch out for em.  But if I don&#39;t see my pet, I am /pet get<br/>\nlost or invis in about 2.5 secs... because yes, I once got hit through a<br/>\nwall in guk, my pet ran out to find the mob and almost killed the party.<br/>\nSame reason I don&#39;t use AE but that&#39;s a different story....<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tHally/Tani<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\t\t\tFrom:\tRyan Honeyman<br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:honeyman@...\">honeyman@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\t\t\tSent:\tWednesday, January 19, 2000 9:31 AM<br/>\n\t\t\t\tTo:\t&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n\t\t\t\tSubject:\tRE: [eqbards] Binding grrrr<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\tFrom: Ryan Honeyman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:honeyman@...\">honeyman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t\t\t\t&gt; ...can you tell I stayed up too late last<br/>\n </span></blockquote>night trying to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t\t\t\t&gt; get some xp into 45?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>\t\t\t\t  Yep.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\t  What about your bard? ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\t  And are you one of those shaman who don&#39;t<br/>\nkeep a leash on their pups?<br/>\n\t\t\t\t  /grrr  hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\t  We got majorly trained again the other<br/>\nnight when a frenzied spirit<br/>\n\t\t\t\t  did just that; it frenzied and pulled like<br/>\n3 spite golems and 2 <br/>\n\t\t\t\t  clerics.
