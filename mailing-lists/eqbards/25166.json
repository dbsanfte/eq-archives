Or maybe just a new, &quot;kinder, gentler&quot;<br/>\n&gt; management team - who knows!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Personally, I think it is a great idea.  I have 4 accounts <br/>\n&gt; and 2 PC&#39;s.  If I<br/>\n&gt; am not driving 2 char&#39;s, I actually feel like something is <br/>\n&gt; missing and I do<br/>\n&gt; spend most of my time in 6 person groups doing exp or events. <br/>\n&gt;  At times, I<br/>\n&gt; have really wished that  certain characters were on other <br/>\n&gt; accounts for ease<br/>\n&gt; of teleporting. My &quot;mains&quot; are 60 Bard, 60 Cleric, 52 <br/>\n&gt; Enchanter, and  51<br/>\n&gt; Wizard.  The wizard account happens to have a rogue that I <br/>\n&gt; would like to<br/>\n&gt; level up sometime in the near future and teleports are <br/>\n&gt; obviously not as<br/>\n&gt; convenient as they could be. So this is a good thing for me.  <br/>\n&gt; Btw, I am<br/>\n&gt; actually thinking of getting a 3rd PC - probably not for <br/>\n&gt; playing 3 at the<br/>\n&gt; same time - except for teleporting and maybe powerleveling.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As far as unsavory characters inflicting pain and suffering <br/>\n&gt; on unsuspecting<br/>\n&gt; groups, we already have plenty of that.  It&#39;s called &quot;A normal day in<br/>\n&gt; Sebilis.&quot;  If they transfer to a new server, they should be <br/>\n&gt; pretty easy to<br/>\n&gt; spot.  They will be wearing that new kind of armor: Emperor Armor*<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sylly Songsynger<br/>\n&gt; newly minted Virtuoso<br/>\n&gt; &lt;this space for rent&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Somewhere on Innoruuk....<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; * do you mean to say that you have not seen the Emperor&#39;s new <br/>\n&gt; armor?  ;)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Kimes, Dean W.
