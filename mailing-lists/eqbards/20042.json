Most conned blue and ... they<br/>\ndrop fine steel.<br/>\n<br/>\nI got killed once by a shaman, bigchief something or<br/>\nother but on returning I found that I could walk out<br/>\nto the end of the dock without getting attacked.  <br/>\n<br/>\nRunning thru the overthere and FM zones to get bound<br/>\nin FV was a breeze.<br/>\n<br/>\nTyunes of Rodcet Nife<br/>\nclosing in on Hell level<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet Yahoo!
