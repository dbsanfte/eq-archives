I&#39;m not much good at the short<br/>\nsonnet or light verse.  O, I&#39;ve written some in my day, but find my muse<br/>\nmore with plot, an epic: such as Homer or, er, Star Wars.  As Homer did it,<br/>\none of his performances would only be a part of his larger epic.  That<br/>\nchapter could really be enjoyed on its own, so I&#39;m not saying I have a<br/>\nStephen King novel, but rather a lyrical story set in parts.  Ah, well it<br/>\nain&#39;t exactly Star Wars either; O, there is a short little frazzled fellow<br/>\nin it with big ears and huge eyes always lecturing about the forces of his<br/>\nmagic and all, but he&#39;s a gnome.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave worked out my epic mostly, and have a unique form to it.  Yet I do not<br/>\nrelish the idea of performing any of it, other than playing the type of<br/>\ninstrument in the section I need, managing emotes and some physical<br/>\nactivities on my part to add to the action of the story, etc.  It&#39;s just too<br/>\nmuch if I have to be constantly typing as well.  So I&#39;ll probably never<br/>\nperform it.  My epic, I can&#39;t be standing still in one place typing and<br/>\nsinging and gazing to the heavens, like Whitney Houston and a howling<br/>\nballad... I&#39;d need to rely on many other things to keep the audience<br/>\nenthralled with the story, more akin to Mick Jagger running back and forth<br/>\nand jumping around like a loon.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose a macro program will not work with EQ, then.  I&#39;ve been searching,<br/>\nyet no luck finding an external utility to help me with any of this.
