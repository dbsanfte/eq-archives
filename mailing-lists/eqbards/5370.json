EQ plat has no value in and of <br/>\n&gt; itself.  Banks<br/>\n&gt; do not pay interest.  There is no provision in the economy for capital<br/>\n&gt; investment.  Money is just a store of value or meduim of <br/>\n&gt; exchange.  500pp in<br/>\n&gt; the bank is worthless.  A pair of Elf Hide Gloves has true <br/>\n&gt; value - stats &<br/>\n&gt; prestige.  The person who paid 375pp for them obvious felt <br/>\n&gt; that they were<br/>\n&gt; worth it compared to having 375pp in the bank doing nothing.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Granted - he may have a hard time getting 375pp back out of <br/>\n&gt; them but if he<br/>\n&gt; wanted them that bad - he probably wont even think of getting <br/>\n&gt; rid of them.<br/>\n&gt; As you get older, your access to plats gets easier, your <br/>\n&gt; stuffs get better.<br/>\n&gt; So now you have most everything you want to wear and you have <br/>\n&gt; 800pp in the<br/>\n&gt; bank rotting away - now when you see something you want - you <br/>\n&gt; can pretty<br/>\n&gt; much have it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What drives most deals (sales) of items is how bad the buyer <br/>\n&gt; wants something<br/>\n&gt; and the convenience of getting it.  I have been on both sides <br/>\n&gt; of pretty many<br/>\n&gt; deals.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Here we are in the Oasis d&#39; Mar<br/>\n&gt; /auction Polar Bear Cloak AC8 +10HP +20svCold great for <br/>\n&gt; casters anyone can<br/>\n&gt; wear 40pp obo<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; /ooc that&#39;s a rip they cost only 5pp <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; /ooc yes but first travel to everfrost - get polar bear skin <br/>\n&gt; - hire a ranger<br/>\n&gt; - 4 hours to find karg - then he gets killed for his GZ - 4 <br/>\n&gt; more hours to<br/>\n&gt; find karg - 5pp to karg and travel back home<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; /tell sylly will you take 30pp? can you meet me at the docks?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; /tell whoever omw!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sylly.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
