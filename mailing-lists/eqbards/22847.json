There are a few dead ends, and only a few mobs down that way.<br/>\nThe right side leads to a pool, beyond which lie some &#39;mine shafts&#39;, with<br/>\ndrops below, a few mobs spawn down that way, but i have yet to explore it<br/>\ndeeply, since it&#39;s a bit tough to fight those yellows in a cramped space<br/>\nsolo.  (loot stinks, too...bats and rats, drop newbie stuff, but the spiders<br/>\ndrop &#39;crystaline silk&#39; or some such...magic item, stackable...sells for a<br/>\ngold or so, if i remember right.  Probably some new sewing item, if I had to<br/>\nguess (haven&#39;t seen it listed anywhere, but i don&#39;t do tailoring alot)<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that those tunnels may/probably lead to the area that you fall into<br/>\nif you drop off the bridge on the way into Thurgadim.  Not sure, though...At<br/>\n31, i&#39;ll prolly go a bit deeper, since i&#39;ll have levitate, and won&#39;t drop<br/>\ninto some of the holes in the passageways.<br/>\n<br/>\nMacGrough Mich&#39;Rathe<br/>\n30.4 Bard<br/>\nSolusek Ro Blood Tide<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Cyr, Thierry&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:thierry.cyr@...\">thierry.cyr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, December 22, 2000 10:47 AM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Thurgadim hunting?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; anyone hunt in Thurgadim?
