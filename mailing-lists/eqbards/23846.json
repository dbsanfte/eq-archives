We killed Trakanon in the<br/>\nafternoon, cleared Plane of Sky far enough to finish our first Paladin<br/>\nepic weapon in the early evening, offed Ixlblat Fer twice for some more<br/>\nCleric epics, then decided what the heck, let&#39;s take a shot at<br/>\nTalendor.  And we got him!  Only the second guild on the server to get<br/>\nhim, if I&#39;m not mistaken.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrak didn&#39;t drop the guts (he did the first time we killed him), but now<br/>\nthat I know we can do it, it&#39;s just a matter of time.  And now that we<br/>\nknow we can kill Talendor, the red scale is within reach (the guild has<br/>\none banked for the next person to need it, who will be me or a<br/>\nwarrior).  But...<br/>\n<br/>\nThat stinking white scale!  If we have to rely on a Vox raid, every<br/>\ncaster and his brother wants to roll for the thing (we don&#39;t have enough<br/>\ntwinks to do it ourselves, we have to organize a multi-guild thing).<br/>\nAnd he doesn&#39;t even drop the thing reliably.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy question for those of you who are hugely uber (hehe) is, then, have<br/>\nyou managed to kill Gorenaire and, if so, are there techniques that<br/>\nhelp, or is it just a matter of levels/numbers/weaponry?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy other option is to pay 50-75pp for a White Dragonscale Robe and offer<br/>\nto trade it to whatever caster wins a Vox lotto for the scale straight<br/>\nup, but I&#39;m just not that rich.<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 56 songs, Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
