So here is the<br/>\nfirst pass, some of these may be more strongly worded than the reality, but<br/>\nthey need to be brief and communicate teh concept. The hardest part is that<br/>\nthey have to all fit in a Social or three. I would love to hear<br/>\nsuggestions(remember it has to fit in a single line (at most two) of a<br/>\nsocial which is somewhere around 48 characters:<br/>\n<br/>\nI am extremely focused on the collective survival<br/>\nthat being said there are some realities:<br/>\nHeal+DoT=MegaTaunt.I only sing heal in combat<br/>\nif few mobs/great taunter or I can save a life<br/>\nOutdoors I am your fastest/safest ticket to zone<br/>\n<br/>\nI am a mob magnet, I need the healers attention<br/>\nIf healer burns I will spend half my time zoning<br/>\nAnnounce root/mezz of mob,songs can break them<br/>\nSelo&#39;s does not break SoW, jig does not speed med<br/>\nI get the mana song in 6 levels :o)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I am not remembering how many slots a social has, but the last two are<br/>\noptional. Any suggestions? I mostly hunted with a small, good group, so<br/>\nthere may be some things I have never had to address specifically.<br/>\n<br/>\nTIA v.2,<br/>\nTszaaz E&#39;Taurguin</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
