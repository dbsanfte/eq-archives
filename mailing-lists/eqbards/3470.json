In general it is binding more than anything that is keeping<br/>\npeople from spreading out the way Brad wants them too.

I think casters should only be able to bind themselves to cities.<br/>\nIf<br/>\neveryone could be bound anywhere there&#39;d be no reward for risking trips to<br/>\nout<br/>\nof the way places (like Guk). I routinely spend time in Splitpaw dungeon<br/>\nwhich<br/>\nis about a 20-25 minute walk from the nearest bind point. But because of<br/>\nthis it<br/>\nis rare to see more than 10 people in there. If anyone could be bound right<br/>\noutside the entrance it would be just like Blackburrow, Crushbone, et.al.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my 2cp,<br/>\nTaelin, Songweavers of Kelethin<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; SoW doesn&#39;t affect what your character can do, other than kiting, only how<br/>\n&gt; long it takes.

Believe me I will never play another character who does not<br/>\n&gt; get bind, period.  It is way too limiting.
