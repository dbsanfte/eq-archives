How much can I expect to pay for a weapon that <br/>\nwill do the trick?  I am on a tight budget right now, what with <br/>\nbuying songs and learning to smith :)  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, when soloing which do you prefer: Anthem de arms, or Whistling <br/>\nwarsong?  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso Also, how hard is it to get that other level 9 song I heard can <br/>\nonly be gotten in Luclin, &quot;Magical Monologue&quot;  (of course I&#39;ll have <br/>\nto buy the exp first) so that i can save my Platinum and not have to <br/>\nbuy a magic weapon?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso Also Also does the bellow that bards get at lvl 12 affect <br/>\ncreatures that can only be hit with magic weapons, and does that song <br/>\nshow you how much dammage you are delivering (whereas the chords of <br/>\ndisonance only say &quot;Large Spider winces&quot; etc)?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for listening!<br/>\n<br/>\n-fohat, level 10 half-elf Quelious Bard on Firiona Vie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
