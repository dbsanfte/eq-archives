Sometimes if you encounter very rude or<br/>\nbeligerent kill-stealing campers, you need but give the mighty avatar a bit of<br/>\ndirection toward the infidels. *smiles innocently*.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow if there was only a way to zone a Sand Giant into Unrest....<br/>\n*sighs*<br/>\n<br/>\nAriell Thunderwolf, Karana<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Jones, Brian&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:brian.jones@...\">brian.jones@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; After so many kills the Avatar of the creature comes. For example: Someone<br/>\n&gt; is camping the Highhold orcs for 7 hours, looking for that particular item.<br/>\n&gt; The party has killed NUMEROUS orc fanatics, each one a servant to the orcs<br/>\n&gt; god. The god notices the death of &#39;its&#39; subject. The god sends an avatar to<br/>\n&gt; destroy those that are killing his worshippers. In comes The Shralok Avatar.<br/>\n&gt; It takes names. It kicks butt. If the party zones, he will disappear until<br/>\n&gt; anyone from that party comes back to that area. After a certain length of<br/>\n&gt; time, it is safe to come back and camp the area some more to get another of<br/>\n&gt; a particular item. Until the avatar shows up again.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Its only a suggestion :) </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
