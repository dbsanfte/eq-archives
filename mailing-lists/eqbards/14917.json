Rather have an upgrade to our charm song, allowing us to charm up to 49th lvl mobs :) A Fire Giant Warrior says, Guarding you O splended one ... A group","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2046991851\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:John_Senior@...\">John_Senior@...</a><br/>\n&gt;Level 39: Invis to Undead (useful in Lower guk etc)<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Rather have an upgrade to our charm song, allowing us to charm up to 49th <br/>\nlvl mobs :)<br/>\nA Fire Giant Warrior says, &quot;Guarding you O splended one&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Level 45: An upgraded Bellow/DD song (giving us better combat skills)<br/>\n </span></blockquote>A group heal song that uses mana.  Have it convert all your mana into HP <br/>\n(say 1 hp for each mana point) and devided amoung all party members.  By my <br/>\nestimates I had a little less then 1000 mana at 45th with 90 int.  This <br/>\nwould give a reason for our class armor to have +int bonuses.  Given the <br/>\nhuge taunt factor of group heals this song would be fairly balanced<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Level 47: Summon Corpse song (like the necro one)<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Niv&#39;s Melody of Preservation is already slotted for this (info is in the <br/>\nspdat.eff file.  Info Harmonic found from poking around:<br/>\nBerserker Strength shows as HP Absorb Shield (this is what Niv&#39;s really is <br/>\nbtw)  [Protective Skin is mis-worded]  The shield is what I refer to as <br/>\n&#39;Rune shielding&#39; after the Rune series.  Our new song is half as powerful as <br/>\nthe Berserker Strength shielding (Enchanter 20).  The Strength component is <br/>\nslightly better than the Shaman L29   spell called Raging Strength.  The new <br/>\nsong has the same Strength component as the Berserker Strength (Enchanter <br/>\nL20)<br/>\nThe Max HP component is close to 3/4&#39;s the component of the Cleric 9 Center <br/>\nspell.<br/>\nFor all purposes, this new song resembles the Enchanter Berserker Strength <br/>\nspell across all party members.<br/>\nIt has half the range of Selo&#39;s Accelerando, and slightly more range than <br/>\nHymn, and close to equal range of Chant of Battle.<br/>\nthe Healing aspect is identical in numerics  to Hymn.  However how  it is <br/>\napplied will be a different story.  (It could have a very low fixed ceiling, <br/>\nas could all the effects in this description)  I&#39;m not sure how level will <br/>\ninfluence this song, but since it&#39;s L47 I doubt the effects will increase <br/>\nmuch in 3 levels.  Just pure speculation and assumption on my part based on <br/>\nthe data file.<br/>\nI&#39;d hate to say this is anything more than an educated guess.<br/>\n<br/>\nSounds like a interesting song.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Level 49: Upgraded older song (such as charm) or a combo song (2 effects<br/>\n&gt;such as hymm and clarity)<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Not sure what would be nice here.  The idea of a combo of Hymn of <br/>\nrestoration and Clarity sounds nice.   But I would hate to waste a high <br/>\nlevel song slot on something so mundane.  Maybe have this be the group heal <br/>\nsong and have 45 be a Mem Blur song.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
