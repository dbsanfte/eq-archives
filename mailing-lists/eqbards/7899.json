Well, to respond to this, and your earlier message.  Every caster class gets at least 1 option to avoiding engagements on corpse retrieval, many get 2.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-255848443\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt; Hmmm....you&#39;re right about necros -- Gathering Shadows they call it -- my<br/>\n&gt; mistake.  I wondered why they had been zeroed out. Don&#39;t know about shamans.<br/>\n&gt; I know they don&#39;t get it before 20, and the one spell list I have seen that<br/>\n&gt; has spells up that high didn&#39;t have it listed.  However, even if it is there<br/>\n&gt; at 29, it is a long time to go before you get it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>\tWell, to respond to this, and your earlier message.  Every caster<br/>\nclass gets at least 1 option to avoiding engagements on corpse retrieval,<br/>\nmany get 2.  One is invis, the other is root.  Yes, some classes don&#39;t get<br/>\nthese spells until lvl 9 or 16 or so, but that&#39;s not really the point.<br/>\nThe difference between the various melee classes and the various caster<br/>\nclasses don&#39;t really begin to show themselves until around this time<br/>\nanyways.  If one tries to argue that a melee class can get to their corpse<br/>\neasier than a caster because a level 1 warrior has more hp than a level 1<br/>\nwizard, that argument is completely invalid when discussing the two<br/>\nclasses as a whole.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Again, though, this is still irrelevant to my main premise,  which is that<br/>\n&gt; there isn&#39;t a compelling need for melee classes to be able to bind or bind<br/>\n&gt; anywhere.  I can&#39;t argue that it wouldn&#39;t be more convenient, because it<br/>\n&gt; would be, I just don&#39;t believe that it is critical.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My argument isn&#39;t that melee classes NEED bind, but that bind SHOULD be<br/>\nable to work on melee classes.  Binding in city zones only was a quick-fix<br/>\nto the problem of malicious binds.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s very little left in the game that could be considered &quot;critical&quot;<br/>\nchanges.  People will play their classes however they have to to make it<br/>\n&quot;work&quot; and allow them to advance.  None of the changes Verant is making<br/>\nnow is critical in my opinion, but that&#39;s totally irrelevant to whether<br/>\nsomething should or should not happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nMiriana Windryder</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
