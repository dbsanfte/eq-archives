Yeah, I know, <br/>\nwind songs don&#39;t do much with bonuses (can you levitate 20% better?), but <br/>\nthere are a few cases where it does make a difference (ie. Pixie Strike&#39;s MR <br/>\ndebuff, possibly others).<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, after careful testing of my Unicorn Horn and a standard store-bought <br/>\nflute, I have determined that the Unicorn Horn does add an addition 5% to <br/>\nwind-based songs where it can actually make a difference.  Standing in the <br/>\nFreeport bank, I pixie striked myself several times with a store-bought <br/>\nflute and my MR was reduced by 12 points.   Then I pixie striked myself with <br/>\nthe Unicorn horn and my MR was reduced by 15 points.  I believe my starting <br/>\nMR was 48 at the time (I had removed some of my MR gear so that I could hit <br/>\nmyself more reliably).<br/>\n<br/>\n/em envisions hordes of bards scouring Lesser Faydark for Equestrielle<br/>\n<br/>\nOK, maybe not.
