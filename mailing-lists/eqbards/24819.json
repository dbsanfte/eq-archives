Can 3 enchanters<br/>\nkeep her from CH&#39;ing herself?  I have not been on many vox raids, 2 to be<br/>\nexact, but she never CH when I was there I used the Rod from phini (mana<br/>\nsieve) and with 2 enchanters one time and 4 the next she never ch&#39;d on the<br/>\ntwo raids I have went to.  I have heard people say that this does not work<br/>\nand have heard the opposite.  My 2 vox raids are surely not enough to prove<br/>\nanything at all, so what do you all think?<br/>\n<br/>\nMu<br/>\n<br/>\nTeenimu<br/>\n55 Enchanter<br/>\nTunare Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
