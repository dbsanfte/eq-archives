Besides, at a younger level you&#39;re still plenty<br/>\ngood with a sword to be considered a melee class.

There are only two reason to<br/>\nswitch to weapon+sheild:  If I&#39;m too close to another mob to sing CoD or if<br/>\nI&#39;m needed to increase a particular weapon skill.  Otherwise I wouldn&#39;t be<br/>\nputting the lute away until it&#39;s time to run somewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace<br/>\nEvulia of Tunare</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
