Last night in Lower<br/>\nguk I /ooc&#39;d for a group got a tell saying come to the cav, I made my way<br/>\ndown and they invited me, first thing I see is /g wooohooo, crack etc<br/>\n<br/>\nI stayed with the group for an hour or so and hit level 37, &lt;cheers&gt; then<br/>\njoined the sent group, as soon as I join once again I see /g wooo mana<br/>\nsong. During a fight I started playing Celerity and I get /g just play mana<br/>\nsong<br/>\n<br/>\nFine, if thats what the want. So I stand there doing pitiful amounts of dmg<br/>\nwith my poor melee skills and provide the mana, is that all we are worth?<br/>\n<br/>\nI also noticed that I was fighting stuff that conned yellow to me at 37 so<br/>\nI couldn&#39;t even use charm when we got a big pull. I think Verant should<br/>\nmake our level 39 song and upgraded charm that works on mobs upto level<br/>\n47-49 etc. It&#39;s gonna suck loosing one of our best abilities because we out<br/>\nlevelled it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMadagan Songweaver, Bard of 37 songs &lt;Guardians of Light&gt;<br/>\nVeeshan Server<br/>\n<br/>\nPs, Looking on the bright side my Ykesha now proc&#39;s and I traded my Runed<br/>\nFalchion and 600pp for a Sharkjaw Cutlass last night. Although the stats<br/>\nare not as good as the RF it can be weilded in either hand so it&#39;s better<br/>\nwith my Ykesha in the main hand.  =)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKen Bachman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbachman@...\">kbachman@...</a>&gt; on 10/02/2000 02:32:13<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease respond to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nTo:   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\ncc:    (bcc: John Senior/M&G)<br/>\nSubject:  [eqbards] Are Bards useful?  A diatribe...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Ken Bachman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbachman@...\">kbachman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nGoing back to the hybrid discussion, it is my contention that, by<br/>\nVerant&#39;s definition:<br/>\n<br/>\nCompared to casters, hybrids should have better melee and worse casting.<br/>\nCompared to meleers, hybrids should have worse melee and better casting.<br/>\nWe are a hybrid.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor true class balance, the melee + casting component for all classes<br/>\nshould be equal, but the above must at the very minimum be true.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the cost of a material component and fifteen seconds sitting plopped<br/>\non their butts, Necromancers, Magicians and arguably Enchanters have<br/>\nbetter melee than we do, for as long as they are able to keep their pets<br/>\nalive.  So we fail the definition automatically.<br/>\n<br/>\nVerant has specifically made our songs weaker than the corresponding<br/>\nspells cast by other classes (Lullaby is a prime example) because:  a)<br/>\nthey are the other classes&#39; specialties, b) our songs affect an entire<br/>\ngroup, and hence our songs are &quot;more powerful&quot; than individual spells,<br/>\nand c) our songs do not require mana and hence can be cast indefinitely.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yet, we can keep at *most* three songs going at a time, while many of<br/>\nthe clerics, shamans, druids and enchanters I know are capable of keeping<br/>\nthree (plus) buffs up on all party members while *also* casting combat<br/>\nspells and healing (and, in many cases, meleeing better).  If we can cast<br/>\nfewer songs/spells than these other classes, and those songs are weaker<br/>\nthan the other classes&#39; spells, and most of these classes are better at<br/>\nmelee than we are (either naturally or via pets), what use are we?<br/>\n<br/>\nFurther, even at level 42, I find my song selection to be severely<br/>\nconstrained because many of our best songs are incompatable with spells<br/>\nthat other classes are casting.  And their&#39;s are better.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am frequently invited on guild events with the level 50s, but I<br/>\nstrongly suspect that they are using me as a cheap clarity fill-in.<br/>\nEspecially since they are constantly sending /g Play Mana Song.  After<br/>\nall, a level 42 does not steal very much exp from five level 46-50s, and<br/>\nclarity is pretty useful *given that small exp sacrifice*, if no higher<br/>\nlevel is available to fill slot 6.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat happens when I get to level 50?  Can I in good conscience argue that<br/>\nI am actually a useful party member?  It seems to me that the value of a<br/>\nBard shrinks as he approaches level 50, particularly if Harmonic is<br/>\ncorrect and our MR songs are not really needed in Dragon/Planes raids.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been reading a lot of posts on various boards where people discuss<br/>\ntheir &quot;ideal&quot; party makeup.  Given that we are supposed to be the weakest<br/>\nsolo type and the strongest grouping type (correct?), one would expect a<br/>\nBard to be listed in one of the first few slots in most of these lists.<br/>\nAnd yet, not one of the lists I have seen included a bard *at all*.  Not<br/>\neven when a list of alternates was given for slot 6.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect that this is, in part, due to the fact that there are not very<br/>\nmany Bards (and why would there be, when there are so many much more<br/>\nobviously powerful classes to choose from), and that it is in part due to<br/>\nthe fact that many Bards are clueless (at level 42, I am increasingly<br/>\nsurprised at the number of people who don&#39;t realize that we can twist<br/>\nsongs, for example).  Still, doesn&#39;t the fact that nobody who has posted<br/>\na list like this has bothered to name the Bard at all suggest something<br/>\nabout class balance?  Like, for example, we s**k?<br/>\n<br/>\nI need reassurance.
