To get a key you supposedly have to spend a lot","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1552624365\">Howling Stones is super high level dungeon that requires each person in the<br/>\ngroup to have a key to get inside.  To get a key you supposedly have to spend a<br/>\nlot of time camping a greenie mob.  I believe Verant said they were gonna<br/>\nincrease the drop rate on the keys.  If you&#39;ve been following the corpse<br/>\nrecovery dabate recently, this dungeon was part of the ordeal.  Apparently six<br/>\n50+ people went to Howling Stones to explore it.  I believe they were the first<br/>\ngroup on their server to do so.  To there horror, there were six level 50+ mobs<br/>\nwaiting for them when they completed zoning in.  Since they weren&#39;t able to all<br/>\nzone in at the same time (lag, connection speed, etc), each one of them got gang<br/>\nraped by six mobs as soon as they completed zoning.  So all six of them now had<br/>\ncorpses in a zone that required a special key to get into.  That meant they all<br/>\nhad to camp the greenie mob again to get the keys.  And since the six mobs would<br/>\nstill be there, they would have to treat this like a Fear break and get a lot of<br/>\nother people to help them with CR.  This meant camping the key for those people<br/>\nas well.  This all took a lot of time and they were concerned that 24 hours of<br/>\nonline time would pass before they were able to get keys for everyone.  Not<br/>\ncertain how this issue was resolved but I believe a GM gave them 12 keys so they<br/>\ncould do CR.  No idea what happened after this.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Kimes, Dean W.
