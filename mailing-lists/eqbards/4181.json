For the reason why Dark Elves hate High/Wood Elves check the back <br/>\nstory in the manual, esp the portion on how the Dark Elves came to be.  <br/>\nBrownies are kinda cute, esp that scamp Nillipus.<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn Swiftsong - Karana server<br/>\nMaster Brewer of Societus Argenti<br/>\nAmerginn - Test server<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Kevikazzam@...\">Kevikazzam@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;In a message dated 7/22/99 1:21:37 PM EST, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fun-bob@...\">fun-bob@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&lt;&lt; and has kids.... &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thats what i&#39;ve always wondered , in this &quot; virtual world &quot; why are there <br/>\n&gt;no<br/>\n&gt;children ?<br/>\n&gt;I mean , it isn&#39;t essential to the game , but it would add to the realism<br/>\n&gt;for me personally. We have lots of quests involving sons / daughters. but <br/>\n&gt;you<br/>\n&gt;have no idea how old they are , we have no idea how old anyone is. Some<br/>\n&gt;people might say this is a good thing , i think it sucks. I personally <br/>\n&gt;would<br/>\n&gt;have loved starting out as a teenager , and every ten levels getting a new<br/>\n&gt;look. being grown up or even old by lvl 50.  So in that whole crappy <br/>\n&gt;conning<br/>\n&gt;system you could tell a red from a RED just by looking at them ( i know <br/>\n&gt;this<br/>\n&gt;doesn&#39;t apply to most monsters and animals and such) .<br/>\n&gt;I personally wish this game was more immersive , sometimes it can be , but<br/>\n&gt;other times it just isn&#39;t at all. I would like to be able to feel why the<br/>\n&gt;dark elves are evil , and why they hate the wood elves and such.
