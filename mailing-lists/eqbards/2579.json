You lead,<br/>\neveryone /follows you.  You switch to walking, everyone else<br/>\nkeeps running.  You go your merry way and nobody should fall<br/>\nout of range.  That&#39;s what I did to help a friend recover his<br/>\ncorpse in Nektulos right out from under the eyes of two dark<br/>\nelf guards. Just be sure you switch back to run mode if you<br/>\nhave to run, although at my level it&#39;s gotten so I can<br/>\nAccelerando-walk faster than most mobs can run.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, you&#39;re not invisible if any other song is playing.  <br/>\nIf you have a second bard in the group, if he plays a song<br/>\nwhile you play Invis, his song will give you away.  The same<br/>\napplies if you have the invisibility spell cast on you and you<br/>\ntry to charge through somewhere playing Accelerando.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I&#39;ll reiterate that being a bard is very dangerous if a<br/>\nmember of your party is KOS.  Say you&#39;re escorting a dark elf<br/>\nto the Freeport docks using Invisibility.  If he should become<br/>\nvisible and the guards attack him, the next time your song<br/>\npulses, the guards see that as you helping someone they want<br/>\nto kill, and thus they will want to kill you as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
