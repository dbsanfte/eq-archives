I thought I read on<br/>\nEQVAULT something from Brad about it being done to decrease the number of<br/>\nobjects in the game&#39;s database.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, here&#39;s the patch message:September 28th, 7:00am<br/>\n----------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nThe following changes have been implemented with the latest patch, most<br/>\nimportantly, changes to corpse resurrection.  It should be noted that all<br/>\ncorpses generated previous to this patch may not be resurrected, however,<br/>\nall corpses generated from this point forward may be resurrected with the<br/>\nchanges listed below applying.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Corpses that are older than 2 hours cannot be resurrected.<br/>\n- Corpses that are produced from a duel cannot be resurrected after 10<br/>\nminutes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Database size - the point I was making there.  Keep in mind that there<br/>\nare 250,000 current subscribers.  You have to include all former subscribers<br/>\nas well for the period until the characters are purged.  I thought I heard<br/>\nthey will keep your account on the database for six months (not sure about<br/>\nthat).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut regardless - a search on a 7 GB table on a high speed database is very<br/>\nsignificant.  This is a very significant change to the system.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point I made and yet to be convinced otherwise; adding item decay times<br/>\nis too significant of a coding change for it to be retro-fitted in the<br/>\ncurrent game.  If it were to be added - it would be in EQ2 - we&#39;ll never see<br/>\nit in our existing game.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not arguing that it&#39;s not a good idea...<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, November 04, 1999 2:32 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Item Decay and Loot Once<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Thu, 4 Nov 1999, Daniel P.
