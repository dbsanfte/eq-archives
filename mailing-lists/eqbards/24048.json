To say that the needed change to the<br/>\nlvl 19 song (adding see invis) made the lvl 24 song pointless is about the<br/>\nstupidest thing I have read on this or any list.   Next time you need to see<br/>\ninvis with a pet caster around see how much they enjoy recasting their pet<br/>\nwhen you pulse clouding to see invis.  Or maybe when you are fighting invis<br/>\nmobs in PoA or another zone and have to use your flute so your party can see<br/>\nthe invis mob you are fighting.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Kenneth E.

This song was relatively but<br/>\nnot entirely useless until<br/>\nVerant modified level 19 to be not just invis but invis/see invis.  At which<br/>\npoint, they never bothered to<br/>\naddress the fact that this made level 24 pointless.  So looking at the<br/>\nweakness of 24 to justify the<br/>\nweakness of DDD isn&#39;t a good comparison.  Particularly since Verant just<br/>\nexplicitly modified DDD to make<br/>\nit &quot;good&quot; in their way of thinking.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, Verant has never in any way indicated that DDD was tuned with PvP in<br/>\nmind.  In general, their<br/>\napproach is to make songs/spells work differently on blue and red servers in<br/>\norder to balance for PvP.  In<br/>\nthe absence of any other information, I am forced to assume that they<br/>\nbelieve that this song is balanced<br/>\nfor blue server play.  I couldn&#39;t disagree with them more.<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 57 songs, Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJeffrey Sue wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; well, for all the wood elf and half elf bards or bards with mask of<br/>\n </span></blockquote>deception or<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; guise of the deceiver, they don&#39;t get a song at level 24 then (ultravision<br/>\n </span></blockquote>song).<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; how about if we compare the ratio of human bards with no mask to the total<br/>\n&gt; number of bards with the ratio of pvp players to non pvp players?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
