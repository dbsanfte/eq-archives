A friend of mine ran <br/>\nme in since I was work-delayed, so I logged in an hour or so into the <br/>\nraid.  At the time, I had four pieces of visible blue Lambent:  arms, <br/>\nlegs, chest, head.  There were two Bards up there; the senior Bard (Jysa) <br/>\nhad all of her Imbrued already.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs soon as I logged on, one of our pullers handed me some vambraces.  I <br/>\nlooked:  Singing Steel!  They&#39;d found it in Sebilis the night before and <br/>\ndecided to give it to me!  I&#39;d heard them talking about that in /guildsay <br/>\nthe night before, but I honestly thought they were yanking my chain.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn hour in, some warrior greaves dropped.  The warrior who got them had <br/>\nsome guild-owned Mithril Greaves; my guild decided to give them to me, <br/>\nalso!  The AC is less than Lambent, but I&#39;ve been sorely lacking in the <br/>\nSTR department, so this was a welcome addition.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe killed Innoruuk (I went LD, even though I was staring at the corner), <br/>\nthen Maestro (the Lute rotted, since both Bards there had one), and <br/>\nwent back to the west camp.  A few more Scorn Banshees and what dropped? <br/>\nA Bard Helm!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother hour or so, another Scorn Banshee.  What dropped?  A Bard BP!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I went from mostly blue to no blue at all in about four hours.  Pretty <br/>\nnice day for me, I&#39;d say!  Pretty nice day for the guild as a whole, <br/>\ntoo.  We got about 35 drops up there total, including 4 BP/Robes (Shaman, <br/>\nBard, Mage, Enchanter).<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 52 (&quot;I feel small&quot;) songs, Silent Justice, Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
