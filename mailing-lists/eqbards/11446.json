But the Butler, like many other<br/>\n  inhabitants, drops a harm touch (~200 dmg).  And if said druid<br/>\n  agro&#39;s the gargoyle that usually stands in there, or agros a <br/>\n  hallway roamer - KYAG.  It&#39;s all in the pull vector, and object<br/>\n  angles that makes the room look really easy, until the unexpected<br/>\n  may occur.  I know, I&#39;ve been there many many times.  Your level 32<br/>\n  druid will most likely finish the battle at 4o% mana and 5o% health.<br/>\n  I don&#39;t call that easy, I call it doable.  =)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Even at L50 those two servant rooms can offer some trickiness<br/>\n  which could result in an attempt to gate or die.
