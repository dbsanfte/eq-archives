They may claim<br/>\nto, just to scare ppl, but when it comes down to it, money talks -<br/>\nbullshit walks.<br/>\nAny of you on Tarew Marr may be familiar with a player named<br/>\nNeuromancer. Well, he&#39;s very famous for training SGs and such on ppl,<br/>\njust for the sake of being an asshole. Several members of my guild have<br/>\nencountered him and after he tried training stuff on them, they all<br/>\npetitioned. He seems to train stuff on everyone he meets. He attempted<br/>\nit once on me while I was hunting orcs in Oasis. I petitioned him as<br/>\nwell. By this time he must have a good 3 dozen petitions on his name. He<br/>\ndid receive a so-called warning once, but thats where it ends.<br/>\nI&#39;ve lost faith in Verant&#39;s ability to keep the game clean and fun for<br/>\nALL players. They seem to care more about the $10 a month than the<br/>\nindividuals that actually play the game.<br/>\nFriends who have lost all their posessions due to corpse bugs come to<br/>\nmind. The GMs basically tell you &quot;sucks to be you&quot; and ignore you.<br/>\nDoes anyone know of anyone who has actually been banned?<br/>\nI know a few ppl on Tarew Marr were banned for exploiting &quot;safe areas&quot;<br/>\nin beta, but thats it.<br/>\nIn my opinion, deliberately ruining other ppls fun is much worse than<br/>\nexploiting power-leveling tactics. But oh well, what can ya do?<br/>\n*end of rant*<br/>\nMaev Lorekeeper<br/>\nTarew Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nHave you entered ONElist&#39;s &quot;Grow to Give&quot; program?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nDeadline is June 19.
