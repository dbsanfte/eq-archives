Mithril Armor (Where and how I find any of these<br/>\n&gt; pieces) Adamantite Armor(Double for this info I like to know if its better<br/>\n&gt; than Mithril).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ps.

It is found on a level 50ish ghoul lord down in lower guk,<br/>\nand he is quite hard.  Surrounded by 2 level 48 guards = one hell of a<br/>\nfight.  Mithril is found in solusek B, and you also have to be high<br/>\nlevel to get that.  Adamantite.. i just know of epolets which are good<br/>\nfor casters but not bards.  I&#39;d suggest you wait a bit before trying<br/>\nthis stuff =)<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Eronan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
