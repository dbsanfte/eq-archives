So if you change a dwarf merchant who was apprehensive toward you, all<br/>\nothers in the same zone who were apprehensive seem to change as well.  (This<br/>\nseems like a bug).<br/>\n<br/>\n- These changes DO affect prices, provided that the NPC was not amiable to you<br/>\nin the first place.  Using the song on a dwarven smith who was originally<br/>\n&quot;apprehensive&quot; changed the price of a pair of chain leggings from 47 plat to 42<br/>\nplat.  Using the song on a wood elf merchant who was &quot;amiable&quot; to me made no<br/>\ndifference.<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone else done any experimenting?<br/>\n<br/>\nJyzan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
