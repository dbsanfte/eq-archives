If","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-373071585\">Oh thank god,<br/>\n<br/>\n    After being the world&#39;s poorest bard for 22 levels, I must say that I have found the greatest place I have ever been for experience and cash.  If any of you level 30 and under bards are in need of a fun time and a good place, I would suggest Solusek&#39;s Eye.  In the last week, I have gone from level 22 to almost 25, and made about 1400pp (no kidding - I know you big guys are saying ~yawn~, but I&#39;ve never had more than 100pp in the bank hehe).  I am now the proud owner of 2 Obsidian Scimitars, a drakescale belt, a pair of Kobold hide boots, and an obsidian shard.  <br/>\n    <br/>\n    My guild and I have been exploring the place for a week now and we love it!  Of course, we&#39;ve only gotten as far as the Foreman&#39;s room but we&#39;ll get a little further after a while.  Our group was myself, a 25 rogue, a 25 monk, a 27 ranger, a 26 paladin, and a 26 warrior.  So far I&#39;ve only died once, which is incredible for me.  Hell, I died getting there (forgot to check the time and ran smack through the middle of Kithicor at 1 am -- you writhe in pain....LOADING, PLEASE WAIT).  I have yet to see a champion or a mage other than on the ranger&#39;s tracking, but we haven&#39;t gotten that direction yet.  We will, poppa needs some brand new shoes and sleeves, as soon as we level a few more times. <br/>\n<br/>\n    Anyway, just a suggestion for those of you who are looking for a nice place to hunt.  Although you&#39;ll need a good group, the place is a blast so far.  There are lots of &quot;safe&quot; places to pull to once you fight your way to them, most are right next to Sol B zone lines.  And so far, I&#39;ve encountered no warping bugs for MOBS, and no Z-Axis problems, I have no trouble using Lullaby at all.  It has saved our asses more than once, I know one time we pulled a fire gob shaman, 2 flame gobs, and 2 cinder gobs when Singe showed up!  We barely eeked that one out, but damn it felt good!<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry to ramble on, I&#39;m just in awe of this place!<br/>\n<br/>\nWeiland &lt;Disciples of Truth&gt;<br/>\nErollisi Marr<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. Of course you know that as soon as I post this I&#39;m going to go back and die there 25 times tonight, Murphy&#39;s Law.  Doh!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
