Does anyone actually use this song at all? I think they made the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; drawback a bit too much, as I found the only way to use it was to play<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it just before a fight, then the wizard can med up the extra int it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; gets him and maybe get off one more bolt. All the casters I worked with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; quickly decided it wasn&#39;t worth the extra hassle for what it gave you.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; So I would say the use for the song is if you can forsee a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; situation where you need additional mana for a single fight.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Start singing it before, let the casters top off, then start<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the fight.  That should let them get one or two extra spells<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in for just this one fight (after they&#39;ve cast the first few<br/>\n&gt; &gt; spells, you don&#39;t need to keep the int/wis boost up).  Having<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the effect last longer would be more convenient, but not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; advantageous.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Isn&#39;t this exactly what I described doing above? Maybe I wasn&#39;t clear<br/>\n&gt; enough. And no, it&#39;s not worth the hassle according to the mages I have<br/>\n&gt; worked with.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes that&#39;s exactly what you described doing above.  You seemed<br/>\nto express the desire that the song could somehow be made more<br/>\nuseful.  What I was explaining was that the &quot;drawback&quot; you<br/>\ndescribe isn&#39;t really a limitation of the song, it&#39;s a<br/>\nlimitation of what extra mana can do for you.  i.e. making the<br/>\neffect last (say) 20 minutes doesn&#39;t really enhance the song<br/>\nmuch.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
