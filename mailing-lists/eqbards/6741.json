Cleric only equipment? The first and only","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-997258679\">Since I play both a cleric and a bard, I&#39;d like to correct some of the<br/>\nCleric rumors going on around here.<br/>\n<br/>\nCleric only equipment?<br/>\nThe first and only Cleric-only weapon (that I have heard of) was just found<br/>\non Vox.<br/>\nThe only Cleric-only armor is on the Plane of Fear.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a quest weapon that is Cleric and Paladin, just like many items<br/>\nthat are Bard and Rogue only.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to hitpoints, Bards and Clerics have about the same amount.  But if you<br/>\ncompare a Dwarven Cleric (95 STA) to a Wood Elf Bard (65 STA) you will<br/>\nprobably see a difference in favor of the Cleric.  My Half Elf Bard has<br/>\nhigher stamina and hitpoints than my High Elf Cleric.<br/>\n<br/>\nCombat favors Bards.  Bards get dual wield and I believe a higher weapon<br/>\nskill cap.  Clerics can do ok at melee, but are much more effective if they<br/>\nare meditating during combat.  So Bards are much more effective in combat<br/>\nthat Clerics.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDivine Aura lasts for 18 seconds, and is not perfect Invulnearbility as we<br/>\ncan be stunned quite easily.  I consider myself very lucky if DA actually<br/>\nallows me to get to the zone before dying.  It has a 10-15 minute recycle<br/>\ntime.<br/>\n<br/>\nDivine Aura is more useful when used in combat.  But it doesn&#39;t work like<br/>\nsome of you think.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Imagine the following, 4 wizards, 1 cleric.  Cleric casts smite,<br/>\n&gt; then divine aura and gives the wizards 18 seconds of nuking.  In same<br/>\n&gt; situation the bard would take a hell of a lot of damage trying to solo<br/>\n </span></blockquote>tank<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; the same critter the cleric could.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>As soon as the Wizards start nuking, the mobs will switch from the Cleric to<br/>\nthe Wizards.  Now the Cleric con only watch the Wizards die, as he can&#39;t<br/>\nattack or cast any spells (including HEAL) until the 18 seconds wear off.<br/>\nIt really sucks watching a party member die because you are not allowed to<br/>\nheal.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best way is to use DA on a pull when the puller is taking heavy damage.<br/>\nHeal a couple of times when the puller shows up, and draw all the mobs to<br/>\nyou.  Then use DA to give everyone 18 seconds to pull them off you.  This<br/>\nworks ok, but in many pickup groups this would get me killed as the group<br/>\ndidn&#39;t understand what I was doing.  The DA would wear off and I&#39;d still<br/>\nhave 4 mobs on me, while all the tanks are all focusing on a single mob.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is much better to have an Enchanter or Bard in the group that can do<br/>\ncrowd control for you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWayne</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
