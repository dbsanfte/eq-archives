Playing the way you<br/>\nask is suicidal in the long run for cleric types, as it means your<br/>\noffence and defence skills stagnate, as you never get a chance to get<br/>\nimprovements. This means when they get the inevitable frenzy occurs from<br/>\ncasting that heal they get ripped up because they have such low defence.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt;   As for pretending to melee, I do on occasion outdmg rangers and<br/>\n&gt;   paladins.  Double Yks with 205 DEX and SLTW and I almost<br/>\n&gt;   always outdmg them.  Don&#39;t underestimate our melee potential.<br/>\n&gt;   We are by no means the best, but we contribute easily 25% of<br/>\n&gt;   melee damage in most battles (when properly equiped, assuming<br/>\n&gt;   three tanks, three casters).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Cough cough. Double attack mean anything to you?
