All in all it was disappointing. The<br/>\n&gt;fact that I died 3 times and am currently separated from all my equipment<br/>\n&gt;(Estrella is sittin on it) doesn&#39;t help any. I wouldn&#39;t suggest anyone <br/>\n&gt;trying<br/>\n&gt;to find their way outa that place on your first visit. Its quite the maze.<br/>\n&gt;Anyways a few interesting things. I was told that they use ice based spells<br/>\n&gt;(well, true but they also use fire based and magic based suck as creeping<br/>\n&gt;crud). So be prepared with the apropriate songs. Also found our water <br/>\n&gt;breathe<br/>\n&gt;song stacks fine with enduring breath (but eb can&#39;t be cast on you if the<br/>\n&gt;song icon is still on). This was the first night I&#39;ve used the cancel magic<br/>\n&gt;song much (thorns and the like on the mermaids) and I noticed there is no<br/>\n&gt;confirmation message (nothing like the spell message &quot;feels slightly<br/>\n&gt;dispelled&quot;). Be nice to get that lil thing remedied, I like to know if its<br/>\n&gt;beind resisted or what.<br/>\n&gt;Anyways on to the main reason for this post.<br/>\n&gt;This goes out to all yall MM&#39;rs. Tomorrow we&#39;re gonna try a large scale CR<br/>\n&gt;but if it doesnt go well i&#39;d like to have some insurance. What I&#39;m looking<br/>\n&gt;for is a necro with the summon corpse spell. I&#39;ll give 100 plat to whoever<br/>\n&gt;finds the necro and 200 plat (plus 150 for the spell component) to the <br/>\n&gt;necro<br/>\n&gt;himself.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks yall.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>All mermaids in Kedge are druids. If you have anyone that can cast nullify <br/>\nor an enchanter to pillage I would go that route over using bard dispel <br/>\nsong. They will stinging swarm/creeping crud you, which is not a big deal. <br/>\nThe main thing is they tend to hit pretty hard in melee and can their nukes <br/>\nhurt. They use ignite and combust alot seemingly with a 999 channelling <br/>\nskill. They will also use avalanche (or pogonip, whatever the 40-ish <br/>\nice-based druid rain spell is called), which can really HURT. When fighting <br/>\nany of the casting mobs in kedge, pixie strike them as soon as you see them <br/>\ncasting (especially when they try to G Heal themselveS). With my group, we <br/>\nare stunning, slamming, and pixie striking our asses off on maids and they <br/>\ndon&#39;t last too long. Normally the puller is the only one taking much damage.<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
