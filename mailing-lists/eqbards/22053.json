Part of the problem was slow disk drives. Did you load the<br/>\nmotherboard udma drivers for your drives? Are they set up as mode 4 or<br/>\nbetter in the bios? Do they show up in the control panel/system utility<br/>\nas having dma enabled?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing I could see that would account for this is if you are<br/>\nusing one of those winmodems. Any modem that offloads any part of the<br/>\nsignal processing to the cpu can cause problems, especially with games.<br/>\n<br/>\nSound care drivers are another possibility. Go to the manufacturer&#39;s<br/>\nwebsite and download the latest drivers. If the chipset maker has their<br/>\nown reference drivers, also try those.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
