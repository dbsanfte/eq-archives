Doesn&#39;t matter what time<br/>\nit is or what zone I go to, everywhere I look I&#39;m surrounded by VERY green<br/>\nbards in full blubicite.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis doesn&#39;t bother me in and of itself, other than the fact that I know I&#39;m<br/>\ncompeting with tons of bards to get the nice drops I want so badly. (MM<br/>\ndrums, lambent quest components, etc) What does bother me is that a large<br/>\npercentage of these bards are ultra twinked and don&#39;t know what they are<br/>\ndoing. I actually met a bard that didn&#39;t know how to twist songs at level 20<br/>\n!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway seeing as how there are so many bards I often find myself grouped<br/>\nwith another bard and I start wondering about song selection. Many of the<br/>\nbards I&#39;m with are still playing bellows in thier late 20s and early 30s. I<br/>\nfind this odd because I haven&#39;t memmed the song since level 23. I was<br/>\nwondering when the rest of you removed bellows from the list of songs yu<br/>\nregularly mem.<br/>\n<br/>\nDraelon Stormsong<br/>\nbard of the tribunal<br/>\n(3 bubs from tracking)<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Jeff Illian [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jeff@...\">jeff@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, March 27, 2000 11:08 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Mistmoore question....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Jeff Illian&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jeff@...\">jeff@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; MM drums on tribunal are generally trade only (greedy caster bastards) but<br/>\n&gt; the one person who was willing to sell was asking 3k p.

On the other hand with all the bard twinks running<br/>\naround these days, there are probably plenty of bards with 50th level<br/>\ncharacters who wouldn&#39;t mind at all dropping 3K on some MM drums so they can<br/>\nrun faster.  Heck, most of my best trades came from 50th level characters<br/>\ntwinking their other character :).<br/>\n<br/>\nTaneran<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nGET A NEXTCARD VISA, in 30 seconds!
