I haven t upgraded one but yes, upgrading any system from a Voodoo3 to a GeForce will show an improvement, especially on older systems.  This is because","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-89288450\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt; About a year ago or so - I did some research on video cards - and people<br/>\n&gt; told me that TNT2 and better video cards -- with a processor speed of less<br/>\n&gt; than 400 Mhz (I have a p2 300) you wouldn&#39;t see any improvement over a TNT<br/>\n&gt; or a Voodoo3.  I got a Voodoo 3 2000 real cheap -so I stuck with that.<br/>\n&gt;  BTW - I&#39;m oversimplifying what they said and these WERE people who knew<br/>\n&gt; what they are talking about...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Has anyone upgraded a Pentium II box ~300 Mhz to GeForce from a Voodoo3?<br/>\n&gt; Did they see a significant improvement?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I haven&#39;t upgraded one but yes, upgrading any system from a Voodoo3 to a<br/>\nGeForce will show an improvement, especially on older systems.  This is<br/>\nbecause the GeForce doesn&#39;t have the processor as a bottleneck because it<br/>\nhas it&#39;s own on-board processor that handles the video _instead_ of the CPU.<br/>\nThat is the big advantage of a GeForce over 3dFX technology.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe GeForce is doing the Processor&#39;s job.  So not only will your video speed<br/>\nup on sub 500mhz systems but your processor will have less workload to keep<br/>\ntrack of...  As stated before on a PIII 500+ system you start to see<br/>\ndiminishing returns because Intel&#39;s SSE technology or AMD&#39;s 3d NOW!<br/>\ntechnology does the same job as the GeForce&#39;s on board processor and takes<br/>\nno performance hit from it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Basically - I&quot;m holding out till fall or so to upgrade - and figured I&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; just sit with what I have.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If what you have is working then you really don&#39;t _need_ to upgrade.  But<br/>\nthe difference you would notice for your system would be... to put it<br/>\nmidly... incredible.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Another question - how many games actually use 32-bti video?  I thought it<br/>\n&gt; wasn&#39;t supportred in DX7?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I THINK... don&#39;t quote me on this I&#39;m not at home so I cant check my specs:<br/>\n<br/>\nQuake 3 arena<br/>\nUnreal Tournament<br/>\nAsheron&#39;s Call (I THINK they support 32 bit color)<br/>\nMost 3D Racing Games<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso key to note:  Most, if not all, new games coming out from now on will<br/>\nmore than likely support 32 bit Color.  The only reason they weren&#39;t before<br/>\nwas because nobody but TNT supported it.  Now several new technologies are<br/>\nsupporting it.  As far as I&#39;m aware, 3dFX is the only graphics platform<br/>\ngoing to Generation 3 without 32 bit color.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain:<br/>\n<br/>\nIf what you are using works and you don&#39;t have any problem using it, then do<br/>\nnot upgrade until you upgrade your system.  There&#39;s no need to rush out and<br/>\nbuy a card that you don&#39;t _need_ just because others are ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nKev<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Thanks<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Most welcome</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
