I was amazed<br/>\nto see so high-level a bard there, where I&#39;m a bit out of place at 15th.<br/>\nChecking him closer I found he was 3rd level.  He probably became anonymous<br/>\nafter he started the constant auction for rare, expensive items.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome friends and I are starting new characters so we can play together at<br/>\nthe same level.  We&#39;ve passed a bit of equipment down to them, but nothing<br/>\nthat would be really noticable as immensely out of line.  It&#39;s hard to draw<br/>\nthe line between reasonable help extended to new characters, whether<br/>\nstranger, friend, or your own, and outright twinking, but there does seem<br/>\nto be a line.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also have a friend who has concentrated heavily on fletching.  He&#39;s made<br/>\na lot of money and gotten some fairly nice equipment in trade or from<br/>\ngrateful customers, so he could appear a little twinked to a casual<br/>\nobserver, but in fact he&#39;s worked for it.  He&#39;s 7th level and I&#39;m 15th.  We<br/>\ngroup sometimes and I act as his body guard and purchasing agent.  With me<br/>\nhe can go more dangerous places to sell his nice bows, and I can get way<br/>\nbetter prices on expensive materials, on which I get a commission.  So he&#39;s<br/>\na legitimate business elf and I&#39;m a legitimate partner.  Today I even acted<br/>\nas agent for him, since I had time and Selo-speed, and sold a very<br/>\nexpensive bow in Freeport, to good profit for both of us.  He made it and I<br/>\nsold it to another player, all up front and legit.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s clear why you mostly can&#39;t make clear, solid rules, but it does seem<br/>\nthere should be some sort of limits.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThrush/Bob</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
