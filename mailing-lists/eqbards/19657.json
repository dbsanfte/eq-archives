Last night after my<br/>\n&gt; guild&#39;s Kaesora raid I went to Allakhazam&#39;s spoiler site to get some info on<br/>\n&gt; Dalnir(for finding the ancient coin).  Found out that there are a couple of<br/>\n&gt; quests you can do within the dungeon.  Certain mobs drop No Drop quest<br/>\n&gt; components.  Some mobs also drop scroll pieces which give you clues about<br/>\n&gt; the quest.  Find all the quest components and combine them in the forge<br/>\n&gt; located somewhere in Dalnir and you get a magic item as the reward.  The<br/>\n&gt; fallen crypt raider in Kaesora also drops an illegible scroll as well as a<br/>\n&gt; journal (which I couldn&#39;t read).  Several times during the raid mobs dropped<br/>\n&gt; a No Drop pestle which no one had any idea what they were used for.  I<br/>\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t be surprised if there were other No Drop items in Kaesora that can<br/>\n&gt; be combined somewhere in the dungeon to create a magic item similar to the<br/>\n&gt; one in Dalnir.  Its quite possible the bundt cake quest is similar to the<br/>\n&gt; quests in Dalnir in that the solution is found somewhere within a dungeon.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have another strong feeling that the reason that no one has solved the<br/>\n&gt; burynai bundt cake quest is that they aren&#39;t looking in the right place.<br/>\n&gt; Lets assume that the answer lies somewhere in Droga (there is an oven in<br/>\n&gt; there).  I&#39;ve never been there but I think its safe to assume that the<br/>\n&gt; dungeon is under utilized(just like Kaesora and Nurga).  Since E&#39;ci is an<br/>\n&gt; older server, the majority of the players are 40+ level.  They are hanging<br/>\n&gt; out in areas where they can get EXP points, not dungeons where everything is<br/>\n&gt; green to them.  So my guess is that until someone spends a lot of time in<br/>\n&gt; Droga (assuming that is where you must complete the quest), its gonna be<br/>\n&gt; awhile before this quest gets completed.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y* </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
