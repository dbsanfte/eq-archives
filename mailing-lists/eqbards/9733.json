This happened to<br/>\nme last night in MM.  I was pulling familiars from the pathway that leads to<br/>\nthe graveyard.  Three familiars were in sight, all various distances from<br/>\nwhere I was standing.  I lamented the first two in order and attacked the<br/>\nthird one, which was the furthest of the three away from me.  Unfortunately<br/>\nall three followed me back to my group.  I think the best tactic is to<br/>\nlament all the mobs that are nearby and then go back to the first one, i.e.<br/>\nthe one closest to your group, and attack it.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; how long does the song usually last?  i mean is it like druid harmony<br/>\n&gt; &gt; where i cast it and it lasts a good 5 minutes per mob casted on? <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tWell, there have been reports of it lasting quite a while, but since<br/>\n&gt; it doesn&#39;t take any mana, just time, I would always redo it before a<br/>\n&gt; battle.<br/>\n&gt; Remember, if something goes wrong, you can always use Selo&#39;s to get out of<br/>\n&gt; it!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tStill not sure how great effect using an instrument has on it, but<br/>\n&gt; just to be sure, I always use my lute.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tBien - Karana<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a> with<br/>\nthe subject lol.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
