We were working on Aviak guards on an island all to<br/>\nourselves, and doing fine - finishing each guard with no more than half a<br/>\nbubble or so down each.  I needed to go to bed, but since I have a great<br/>\nconnection, I told them that I could stay logged in, and sleeping nearby<br/>\nwhile playing the Hymn, so they could take advantage of it.  Cheesy, yeah,<br/>\nbut I was curious about something.  I sat and watched while they fought,<br/>\nand round after round, they were finishing almost nearly the same as if I<br/>\nhad been fighting.  Whether there was some other dynamic force in effect I<br/>\nwasn&#39;t aware of, I don&#39;t know - but it seems almost as though I didn&#39;t even<br/>\nneed to be there.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen the Rogue had to leave, something about bloodclaws, and that left the<br/>\nSK fighting alone, well, him and his skellie, and I stayed watching, just<br/>\nto see what would happen (and in case he got waxed - I&#39;m not stupid ;).<br/>\nFor the next hour, he fought - never dropping below three bubbles, and when<br/>\nhe did, he&#39;d just back close enough to me to start healing again.  At one<br/>\ntime, an Aviak decided I was doing too good a job and started pounding on<br/>\nme, but it wasn&#39;t much, so I just let it while the Ogre continued to fight.<br/>\n After that, I guess he decided that it was too dangerous to play like that<br/>\nwith me &quot;unconcious&quot;, so he disbanded the party, and went in search of a<br/>\ngroup (about ten minutes later, they took over the nest again).  <br/>\n<br/>\nAll in all, I am incredibly impressed with our ability - just by sitting<br/>\nthere, playing the Lute, I made such a significant difference that he was<br/>\n&quot;soloing&quot; things that were yellow to him.  That&#39;s just amazing.<br/>\n<br/>\nTalies the snoozing Wanderer</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
