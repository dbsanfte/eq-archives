It is possible that the monk could be coming back with a mob <br/>\nor 10 feign, bard song hits him, hate list transfers, he feigns, mob comes <br/>\nto rape you. Or something like that. Better safe than sorry.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am pretty sure the 19/29 weapon is for WAR/SK, maybe PAL/RNG, and not for <br/>\nBRD/ROG. Will ask next time I talk to the guy who got it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI keep hearing Imbrued is dropped on scorn banshees, but I won&#39;t believe it <br/>\ntil I see it. Not too interested in the rapier either - if I were to get one <br/>\nand we killed Mr. Maestro that would knock me out of lottoing rights on his <br/>\nloots. =) Either way I won&#39;t give up a Yak for a rapier.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care,<br/>\nSartori D&#39;Elsiraad &lt;The Companions&gt;<br/>\nBard of Kelethin of the 50th Chorus<br/>\nVeeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Garramone@...\">Michael.Garramone@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: &quot;&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: RE: [eqbards] Lvl 48 song ?<br/>\n&gt;Date: Thu, 18 Nov 1999 10:43:09 -0500<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;last time i was there,i was told the same thing.  the consensus was to sing<br/>\n&gt;away until the monk went to pull, then all bards stopped singing.  no idea<br/>\n&gt;if it means anything, but better to keep everyone happy and keep the bards<br/>\n&gt;out of blame for trains =)  i haven&#39;t been there since the feign death<br/>\n&gt;changes, so don&#39;t know how that changes the pulling strategy, but everytime<br/>\n&gt;i have been there it was a monk pulling and an enchanter scouting.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;we have yet to see any imbrued in hate yet either, all bards that have any<br/>\n&gt;got it from fear.  good luck on either a rapier, or those beautiful weps on<br/>\n&gt;our favorite guy the maestro.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Shada<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;p.s. 19/29 drool, i hope it wasn&#39;t bard!  then i don&#39;t have to worry about<br/>\n&gt;not having one =) </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
