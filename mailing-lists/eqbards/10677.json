I still crinch when I remember that the day AFTER I spent 220 plat <br/>\non a Well balanced Rapier, the Ornate Dagger was changed into the Dragoon <br/>\nDirk.  Then I found that the WB Rapier would only sell back for 45 plat, <br/>\naarrrrgggghhhhh.  I did manage to trade it for a runed bone fork though :)<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn Swiftsong - Karana server<br/>\n<br/>\nHee hee, trouble is I&#39;m almost as mature as my server!  I started in late<br/>\nApril after all my friends forgot which server to start on and left me alone<br/>\non Sol Ro.  I was saving up for a WB rapier on the premise it like a combine<br/>\nwould be a rental fee.  Fortunately John (tm) saved me from my folly by<br/>\nletting me know in advance it would sell back for so little.  I&#39;ve had<br/>\nenough money in my day to buy a better 1HS, but spent it in halves or so on<br/>\narmor that was so much better than what I had compared to moving up from a<br/>\ndirk to an obsidian scimmy.  Maybe I should sell a couple of 150pp+ armor<br/>\npieces and replace them with bronze to buy an obsidian scimitar.  I&#39;d rather<br/>\nearn it directly as that&#39;s how I got the two weapons I have now, but that<br/>\nisn&#39;t possible at my level.  There are no good weapons dropped that a group<br/>\nof my level could get that a bard can use that are better than my dirk.<br/>\nHmmm, maybe the dirk is the unbalanced part!<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tKitasi</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
