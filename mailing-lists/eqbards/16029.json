I was using a<br/>\n+9 cha piece of jewelry simply because I couldn&#39;t<br/>\nthink of anything else, but I switched to a cape of<br/>\nmidnight mist (+5 str +7 save magic ac 2).  I&#39;ll keep<br/>\nthe +9 cha piece of jewelry for charming and pixie<br/>\nstriking but I can&#39;t see wearing it around when 90% of<br/>\nwhat I do is chains and manasong (usual group is<br/>\nwar/cle/enc/wiz/sha, its silly for me to try and out<br/>\nbuff any of them).  The other 10% consists of &quot;I AM<br/>\nPLAYING MANASONG.&quot;  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n-Tork@Nameless<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTalk to your friends online with Yahoo!
