The<br/>\nstats you listed (6 DAM/ 23 DLY) are the stats for a dragoon dirk.  I think<br/>\nthe stats for a Pugius dagger are 5 DAM 21 DLY (thats off the top of my head<br/>\nbut I can&#39;t remember for certain).  I had one a long time ago so its<br/>\npossible the stats on it got improved after I sold it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I acquired a Pugius dagger quite some time ago from a friendly bard for<br/>\n&gt; only <br/>\n&gt; 25pp.  It&#39;s stats are 6dam 23 delay magic peircing.  Its damage ratio is <br/>\n&gt; just a little bit better than a Dragoon dirk but it doesn&#39;t have any stat <br/>\n&gt; increases.  What I&#39;m curious to know is where can this weapon be found?<br/>\n&gt; It <br/>\n&gt; looks just like a regular or a rusty dagger and mine is the only one I&#39;ve <br/>\n&gt; ever seen.  I forgot to ask the bard I got it from where he got it...so<br/>\n&gt; any <br/>\n&gt; help would be appreciated.  I&#39;m guessing that because it has the same <br/>\n&gt; graphic as a regular or rusty many people overlook this fine weapon.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
