I&#39;ve been waiting for<br/>\n&gt;over a week now to see this short little sob and he has yet to show his<br/>\n&gt;face. I need him to spawn to complete my 9th Coldain Ring quest. On my way<br/>\n&gt;out to work this morning I was going to see if Dain was up, so I tried to<br/>\n&gt;log in real fast, but I couldn&#39;t get the patch to start. I didn&#39;t have any<br/>\n&gt;time to play EQ last night. Yesterday at work, I tore myself away from my<br/>\n&gt;work and emailed to my home address DirectX8 and my newest sound and video<br/>\n&gt;drivers. I just need to install them now.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ok, so now for my question, is the reason I couldn&#39;t log on this morning<br/>\n&gt;because I have not downloaded DirectX yet?
