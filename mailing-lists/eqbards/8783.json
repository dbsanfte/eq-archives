However, I was told by my party members<br/>\nit spawns in the basement.  The time I saw it someone had started a massive<br/>\ntrain from the basement.  They fled to the zone and all kinds of nasty stuff<br/>\nfollowed them, including the blade fiend.  After the train went by, someone<br/>\nin our party went inside, saw the blade fiend inside the doorway, attacked<br/>\nit and pulled it out to the courtyard.  I think what happened is that the<br/>\nparty that started the train zoned so the mobs in the train all started to<br/>\nmove back to their spawn point.  The blade fiend never made it outside so<br/>\nhung around the doorway before heading back to the basement.   <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Actually, I think it spawns on the main floor, but I could be mistaken.<br/>\n&gt; Each time I saw it, it was hanging out on the main floor.  I do agree with<br/>\n&gt; the level... It was conning blue to me at level 20 or 21, IIRC.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s found in Unrest, off the Lesser Blade Fiend (thus far, <br/>\n&gt; &gt; my favorite<br/>\n&gt; &gt; mob with regards to looks: picture a rock dervish with <br/>\n&gt; &gt; weapons instead of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; stones).  The spawn is supposedly rare in itself, with the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Gladius being<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the rare drop.  I&#39;ve heard rumor it comes from the basement, <br/>\n&gt; &gt; but it was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; blue to me somewhere in my high teens.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
