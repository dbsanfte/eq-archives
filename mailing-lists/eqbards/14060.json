I figured that might actually<br/>\nstrengthen the guild system as guilds brought in new members with the<br/>\nunderstanding they would help the lower level ones in exchange for services<br/>\nlike these.  There are still some questions regarding group xp and how that<br/>\nwould affect the corpse poofing, but I would imagine they could be worked<br/>\nout.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Wayne Sheppard [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mrwayne@...\">mrwayne@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, January 28, 2000 4:32 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] RE: Re: Alternate overcrowding solution<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Wayne Sheppard&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mrwayne@...\">mrwayne@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;    Date: Fri, 28 Jan 2000 13:56:22 -0700<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Dean_Kimes@...\">Dean_Kimes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: Re: Alternate overcrowding solution<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; No just make the corpse poof if no experience was gained.

If players were<br/>\nforced to buy bat wings from level 1&#39;s it might help the economy.  But some<br/>\npeople were afraid that every low level player would band together and<br/>\ncharge 50pp per bat wing, and you would have to pay since there was no way<br/>\nto loot one yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe &quot;No Exp - No Magical Loot&quot; idea has been around for a long time.  It was<br/>\noriginally proposed to prevent high level KillStealers.  Brad actually liked<br/>\nthis idea, and wished he would have put it in Beta, but didn&#39;t want to put<br/>\nsuch a change in the Final.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of the arguments against NE-NML were kinda stupid.  They mainly<br/>\ncomplained that once you passed the level range for an item you would never<br/>\nbe able to get it yourself again.  They came up with all kinds of theroies<br/>\nabout a lvl 50 losing their corpse and never being able to replace that<br/>\nShiny Brass Shield.  Or that Verant might add an item to the game that was<br/>\ntoo low for them to get.  They felt that lower level players would extort<br/>\nthem for 1000&#39;s of plat for some low level item they wanted/needed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWayne<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nGET A NEXTCARD VISA, in 30 seconds.
