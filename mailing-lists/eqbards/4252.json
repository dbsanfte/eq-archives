I was camping the Mucktail site<br/>\nwith a level 29 cleric.  While we were waiting, we start to see messages<br/>\nscroll through &quot;Cytodl Krish begins to cast a spell&quot;.  Next thing we know we<br/>\nget attacked by a high level DE necro.  He conned red to me (19 bard) and<br/>\nblue to the 29 cleric.  Because we were totally caught by surprise, we both<br/>\nhad to make a run for the Keep zone.  We fully recharged and went out<br/>\nlooking for him.  I was singing invis and had elemental and purifying<br/>\nryhthms ready to weave.  We finally found the necro wandering around the<br/>\nzone, with a bunch of corpses in his wake.  We attacked at the cleric tried<br/>\nrooting him several times. He kept resisting and the cleric was OOM (oops, I<br/>\nused an acronym).  We had to run to the border again.  We recharged and<br/>\ntracked him down once again.  The second time, the cleric just kept smiting<br/>\nhim and we eventually killed him.  All told did over 800 damage to him.  He<br/>\ndidn&#39;t drop any loot which was a disappointment.  When we killed him, the<br/>\nfactions affected, which all got worse, were The Dead, King and Queen of<br/>\nsome wierd name, Keepers of the Art, and Eldritch Collective.  After the<br/>\nfight, we asked around if anyone had ever seen/heard of this NPC before.  No<br/>\none in the zone had heard of him.  Was wondering if anyone on this list<br/>\ncould shed some light on his background?  Also wanted to warn everyone in<br/>\ncase they ran into him and they were less level 30 they should be prepared<br/>\nto run. <br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, by the way he was acting, almost 100% certain it wasn&#39;t a GM controlled<br/>\nNPC.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci   <br/>\nCPT Tom Reece<br/>\nG4 Maintenance Officer<br/>\n655-4978</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
