Camping the Knight room, a full group of six (that work well together) can pull and hold about 20 spawns in that part of the dungeon.  It was awesome exp too.  A bard at 30th can easily solo the Knight room (AE Fear, they run up and down the stairs, so you DOT them and Fear em).  If your group is holding the Knight room, then you have to stay against the back wall during down times.  Else, the runners&#39;ll aggro on you...they&#39;ll bring back 3 to 20 gobbies depending on how much you&#39;ve killed already.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI also spent a half an hour in the King room...uhh...only thing I can say is there were a lot of gobbies there (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.clandlc.com/Runny1.jpg\">http://www.clandlc.com/Runny1.jpg</a> and <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.clandlc.com/Runny2.jpg)\">http://www.clandlc.com/Runny2.jpg)</a>.
