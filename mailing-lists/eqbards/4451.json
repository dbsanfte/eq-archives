I will<br/>\noften only play Chain when my primary function is to slow a mob for my<br/>\ncasters to Kite. If I am consistently Chaining without fail then I will<br/>\ntwist in a Fear or a Bellow between Chains, but if your fighting large red<br/>\nmobs like Griffins and Hill Giants slowing them is the primary function and<br/>\ntakes precedence over anything else.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: CMai [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:CMai@...\">CMai@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, July 27, 1999 10:27 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Dumb bards (was:Magical Gloves?)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: CMai &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:CMai@...\">CMai@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI know what you mean.  I do not understand how a lvl 24 bard not know the<br/>\nusefullness of playing multisongs.  Last night I was group with a bard and 4<br/>\nother plp.  This bard is a lvl 24.  She will play Bellow while fighting only<br/>\nthen Hymn after battle.  I asked her that she know that we can play 3 song<br/>\nat a time right and she said yeah and that was it.  When I started playing<br/>\nmy Anthem, Psalm, and healing during battle the group was so impress.  They<br/>\nwere like wow you can play 3 songs at a time?  I was like yes.  I told them<br/>\nthat if they ever group with a bard expect at least 2 songs at a time.<br/>\nThere is no excuse not to play more than 1 song.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour Friendly Rogue and Bard<br/>\nHammerpaw and Syren Wind<br/>\nChampions of Norrath, The Rathe<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nONElist announces &quot;FRIENDS & FAMILY!&quot;<br/>\nFor details, including our weekly drawing, go to<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html\">http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
