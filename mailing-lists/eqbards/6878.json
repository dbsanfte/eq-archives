At L19 I would have<br/>\n&gt;thought that they might be a bit hard to reach, even with a full party.<br/>\n&gt;Is this not the case? This dungeon wasn&#39;t even itemized until I was in<br/>\n&gt;my 30&#39;s so I didn&#39;t get to play there much except for a trip to pick up<br/>\n&gt;a crystalline blade and a couple of aborted Vox attempts.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Quick Explanation-I actually got the Breastplate from Perma with my cleric<br/>\n(retired)  but before you jump to conclusions, my cleric (who is now lvl 20)<br/>\nwas level 19, in a group of 5 with a 20 Monk, 20 Ranger , 19 Shaman, and a 23<br/>\nDruid.(my Wife and 3 people i work with)  The Ice Goblin Prelates (lvl23-25<br/>\napprox ? ) also can drop Medium Bronze, but it is rare.

I remember someone saying a Programmer GM had grabbed him or a<br/>\n&gt;friend in beta and equipped him in various armor to test this.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I am not sure on this (we are trying to run some tests, will let you know<br/>\nsoon!), as it is a hard thing to get empirical data. I have also heard lots of<br/>\nrumors about &quot;Damage Absorption&quot; or other things, but I am skeptical of<br/>\nanything that i cannot put a number on. But, based on the numbers that i DO<br/>\nhave, i would not give up my barbed arms (+2 Dex, ac of banded) for Bronze arms<br/>\n(one point of AC).  That is not even including the extra 3 pounds or whatever<br/>\nfor the Bronze.  In fact, i am going to test tonight to see if Barbed Legs (ac<br/>\nof banded, +2 AGI) are better/worse/same as Bronze.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have deviated from my intended purpose...i wanted to say that in many cases<br/>\nthe availability of Med Bronze is lower at the same levels as small, it is not<br/>\nIMPOSSIBLE to get at the same levels, and in some cases, there are better<br/>\nthings to get anyway (that are even easier to attain). (Keep in mind, this is<br/>\nmy opinion only)<br/>\nBut, yes, Med Bronze is more difficult to get than Small.  Large Bronze is even<br/>\neasier to get than that (in Theory)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the Info about Highpass Guards and Mistmoore (more info for the<br/>\nDatabase!)<br/>\n<br/>\nKaleid<br/>\n19th (but getting close) song<br/>\nMaster Chef<br/>\nPrexus <br/>\n===<br/>\n&quot;Thou shall not kill.
