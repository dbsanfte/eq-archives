However, I did<br/>\nthis in the entry hall :)<br/>\nWe had 5 in our group: 18th Bard, 18th Shaman, 19th Shaman, 21st Shaman,<br/>\n18th Ranger<br/>\nOne of the Shamans would bring between 1 and 5 gobbies down the hall, to<br/>\nnear the zone line.  After everyone engaged, I would crank up my songs.<br/>\nQuite often, everyone would attack the yellow/red gob, and leave the green<br/>\none(s) alone.  I know that I dropped several greens without anyone ever<br/>\nhitting them. (Gobs will run if they are real hurt, unless, as far as I<br/>\ncould tell, another gobbie that is stronger is still around.)  Even at that,<br/>\nwith the DOT damage, alot of them would drop long before they hit that first<br/>\nturn.  Also, the ranger would snare the runners.  Several times I would go<br/>\nhalfway down the entrance to ensure a DOT on the runners, and would not get<br/>\nthe new spawn in the corner with it.  I would equate DDD/COD range to about<br/>\nthe same as hymn, and shorter than bellow.  I got close enough to bellow the<br/>\nguy in the corner, without damaging him with my aoe&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nMacGrough<br/>\n18th Song Bard<br/>\nSolusek Ro Wanderers<br/>\n<br/>\np.s. I did NOT try to use these songs much past the first ladder into Perma.<br/>\nI do NOT know if this would cause a train, say at the Flag Room.  If you<br/>\nwant to try it, use it at your own risk :)<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Benjamin Jerrad Segal &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:birdman@...\">birdman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Wednesday, October 06, 1999 12:33 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Bellow and DDD/CoD (was Early bard grouping (was<br/>\nTwinking))<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Benjamin Jerrad Segal &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:birdman@...\">birdman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;On Tue, 5 Oct 1999, Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4 wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Does anyone have a good idea on how far the radius extends on DDD and<br/>\n </span></blockquote>CoD?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;Melee range, or perhaps a bit more.  Very short, shorter than Hymn (or<br/>\n&gt;even with, I don&#39;t recall).  It&#39;s for this reason I prefer Chords or<br/>\n&gt;Denon&#39;s to bellow, as the overall damage inflicted is greater.  It&#39;s not<br/>\n&gt;as noticeable since you don&#39;t get the instant hit report, but there&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;definitely more of it (especially if you swap in your lute between swings<br/>\n&gt;;).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Athren Notechaser, bellow-impaired<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
