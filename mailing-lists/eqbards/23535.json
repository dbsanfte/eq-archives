I am a wimpy bard in <br/>\n&gt; regards to STR, with<br/>\n&gt; mine barely being over 100.  If I didn&#39;t have some weight <br/>\n&gt; reducing bags, I<br/>\n&gt; could never loot FS weapons to sell for cash without <br/>\n&gt; exceeding my weight<br/>\n&gt; capacity.  If I switched to the SS arms, not only would I <br/>\n&gt; lose the STR bonus<br/>\n&gt; for the SotA, but the extra weight from the SS arms would <br/>\n&gt; make my situation<br/>\n&gt; even worse.  So guess I will stick with SotA for now.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
