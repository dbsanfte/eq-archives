I used [insert name of program<br/>\nthat strips spell information here], and... <br/>\nA: OK - STOP. All of those nifty programs that supposedly strip out the<br/>\ninformation for our spell are nice for reading what class can cast the<br/>\nspell, or the text that the spell displays when it is cast - but then<br/>\nagain, a good website can tell you that. I&#39;ve checked out a lot of those<br/>\nprograms, and I have yet to see one that ACCURATELY tells the effects of<br/>\na spell. At this point, I would trust information from websites more<br/>\nthen I would from one of these programs. The information from webistes<br/>\nusually comes from players who have gotten the data first hand. <br/>\n<br/>\nUldar Ulfangson<br/>\n34th Bard, Rodcet Nife</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
