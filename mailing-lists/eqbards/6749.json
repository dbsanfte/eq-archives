Heal a couple of times when the puller shows up, and draw &gt; all the mobs to you.  Then use DA to give everyone 18 seconds to &gt; pull them off you.

You cast aura, and you&#39;re agression to it is moved to the bottom of the list.  If no one else has been meleeing it, the bard is almost always the next thing on the list.  There have been numerous times where it&#39;s worked out to:<br/>\n<br/>\n1)  Puller pulls 4 things<br/>\n2)  I heal, pulling 3 of them on me<br/>\n3)  I aura, 3 things turn on the bard<br/>\n4)  Click off aura, heal bard<br/>\n5)  Heal bard<br/>\n6)  Heal bard<br/>\n<br/>\n  The problem I&#39;ve found that ever since the bard melee skills started capping, it becomes more and more important to treat them as a caster (meaning the tanks stop to pull creatures off of them) than as a full fledged melee class, where the group happily allows 3 things to beat on the bard while trying to kill something else.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMiriana Windryder<br/>\nPriestess of Tunare<br/>\nInnoruuk Server<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nGot Toast?   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.etoast.com\">http://www.etoast.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
