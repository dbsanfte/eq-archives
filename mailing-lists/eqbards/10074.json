I turned around to assist<br/>\nand there was a Bard in full bluebecite fighting an Orc Shaman.  I was<br/>\npuzzled until I /conned him green to me at 19th.  He had a pack of friends<br/>\nwith him as well casting heals.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve never not assisted someone in trouble before (although it has sometimes<br/>\ncost me a life) but I just couldn&#39;t bring myself to help out this fellow<br/>\nBard...<br/>\n<br/>\nStill couldn&#39;t figure out where he&#39;d got it.  This was a while ago, back when<br/>\nGenni wasn&#39;t in the game and most of the people on the list were trying to<br/>\nfigure out how to get some.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I feel your pain, lower level bards.

Low 20&#39;s, where many of the songs are nothing to look<br/>\nforward to (Mellifluous Motion) and I&#39;m making decent money now and looking<br/>\nto upgrade equipment.  Big gap though between what I have now (full Bronze,<br/>\nDragoon dirk and Combine LS) and the next step up...<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m a part-time player and it&#39;s hard for me to put together a big group.<br/>\nLast night we actually had a fair number of people on and were killing<br/>\nGriffennes in N Karana.  Of course, the only Charm of the evening was looted<br/>\nby the Wizard... Grr.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Luvas of Fennin Ro.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
