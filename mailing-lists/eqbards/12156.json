A group of 6 33-40 would be fine there I <br/>\ntake it.  At least if there is already another group running rampant!  Looks <br/>\nlike I will be headed back.<br/>\n<br/>\nFflewduer Fflamson<br/>\nP.S.  I realize that i saw a very very small part of Paw my first trip which <br/>\nis why I qualified it by saying up to the double doors.  We did in fact go a <br/>\nbit beyond that, but were trained back out and decided to play it safe and <br/>\nlearn a bit more before pushing in too far.  On the other hand...fighting in <br/>\nand seeing what is there has a lot of appeal!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;are empty, and definately something that would be very difficult for a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;pickup group.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I had some very interesting experiences in Paw this week, and can safely <br/>\n&gt;say<br/>\n&gt;it is a very exciting place and provided me with hours of <br/>\n&gt;adrenaline-pulsing<br/>\n&gt;thrills.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I never visited the old Paw, back when those wimpy Splitpaw gnolls were<br/>\n&gt;around, so when I entered a few days ago for the first time I was quite<br/>\n&gt;apprehensive.  I was accompanied by some guildmates, including a 50th level<br/>\n&gt;druid and a 47th level ranger, with whom I have been in far worse places <br/>\n&gt;(in<br/>\n&gt;fact, we had just come from Lower Guk).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;When we entered we ran into a group of old friends (well, I knew only a few<br/>\n&gt;of them, but my groupmates knew them all).  The 9 of us (I think the<br/>\n&gt;youngest was 32 or so) headed in as one band, and cleared the way as we<br/>\n&gt;went.  Each group had an evacer (druid for us, wiz for the others) and a<br/>\n&gt;bard to keep everyone functioning to their fullest capacity.  Well, long<br/>\n&gt;story short, we got to the home of the Ishva (mommy gnoll, around 40th<br/>\n&gt;level), and in a HUGE battle that lasted 8 minutes, we almost killed her,<br/>\n&gt;she healed herself fully (grrrrr), and we got her back down to 1/16th life<br/>\n&gt;before every one of us died (I was second to last to fall, the other bard<br/>\n&gt;was last).  We were so close nobody wanted to evac... though we all died, <br/>\n&gt;we<br/>\n&gt;had a blast, and we&#39;ve vowed to get our revenge on that &lt;ahem&gt; bitch <br/>\n&gt;(pardon<br/>\n&gt;the zoological term).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The nonunique gnolls down there go at least as high as 35th level, from <br/>\n&gt;what<br/>\n&gt;I have seen, and there are 2 unique gnolls I have found so far: Ishva and<br/>\n&gt;the named gnoll &quot;Boss&quot; after whom one of the tribes is named.   His name<br/>\n&gt;escapes me, but we were disappointed to find he had no loot at all.  Ishva<br/>\n&gt;is FAR tougher, be warned.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Try it out - the new Paw is a very exciting place to hunt, and almost every<br/>\n&gt;puppy drops a few plat and FS, so the money and experience are good.  It is<br/>\n&gt;also very underhunted as of yet, and from what I have seen every gnoll <br/>\n&gt;there<br/>\n&gt;has a chance of dropping nice stuff (Splitpaw aromr, weapons, misc magic<br/>\n&gt;items, etc).  Very very few gnolls see invisible, and we made several <br/>\n&gt;corpse<br/>\n&gt;recoveries with no trouble, so if you have someone to evac you can slip <br/>\n&gt;past<br/>\n&gt;the entryway and head right down to the big fights.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Aloro Silvertongue (E&#39;ci)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> <br/>\n&gt;with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;&lt;&lt; text3.html &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
