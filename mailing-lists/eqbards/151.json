I too have found my self suddenly under attack when I used it<br/>\nin the east commons. there is a Militia guard that Patrols from Freeport to<br/>\nthe first INN past the west gate. I had just killed a beast and greedily<br/>\nwent to scavenge what I could find. I saw him approaching and paid no<br/>\nattention. Next thing I know I am under attack by him. I was dead before I<br/>\ncould rise to my feet.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWhen I awoke outside the west gate, I went to get my body then I went my<br/>\nmemory of what I heard before I was killed to figure what I did. It was<br/>\nclear that the guard walked close enough to hear the song and was affected.<br/>\nEveryone&#39;s a music critic I guess... So he felt he was under attack and<br/>\nretaliated. The Militia is not know for their intelligence, and over<br/>\nreacted. but I put it up to experience and now am very careful about using<br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI wonder though, for in the past I have used it and people have come to<br/>\nhelp me in battle and I see them get the flash, but no &#39;&lt;put name here&gt;<br/>\nwinces&#39;. So I was wondering since I am not on a PvP server the person does<br/>\nnot receive any damage I hope.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI wonder if this is a way for a meaner Bard to prevent others from coming<br/>\nup and throwing the last whack in on a creature that you have spent a lot of<br/>\ntime wearing down? Not that I would ever consider such a thing...<br/>\n<br/>\n - SnowLynx, Gentleman bard of Freeport...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;John Robertson&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:johnr@...\">johnr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If it makes you feel any better, I don&#39;t know any bards who haven&#39;t been<br/>\n&gt; killed because of Chords of Dissonance mishaps.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As to the poster below, his explanation of raining on everyone in the<br/>\n&gt; area is a good one.  Guards etc. ARE killable at high levels, and they<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t appreciate you attacking them.  What he says after that is a)<br/>\n&gt; confusing, since that isn&#39;t what you were doing and b) rude and uncalled<br/>\n&gt; for.  I&#39;d ignore that part.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Jyzan </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
