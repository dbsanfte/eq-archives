However.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo sir.  Not me.  In a group of 6 camping a room in lower guk at our levels<br/>\n(I&#39;m 35, you&#39;re 34) there&#39;s no way in hell you&#39;d get me to try and lullaby a<br/>\nroom of frogs, even WITH a cleric.  Maybe, if all I was trying to do was buy<br/>\nmy friends some time to make the zone or evac us.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst of all, I&#39;m not a tank.  As much as I like getting in the face of a<br/>\nfrog and pounding on it, if it hits me more than a few times I have to step<br/>\nback out of the fight because I&#39;m down to two bubbles of health.  I have a<br/>\ngrand total of 792 HPs before buffs.  Lullabying a room is one sure way of<br/>\ngetting the exclusive attention of the two or three frogs that the tanks and<br/>\ncasters in your group *aren&#39;t* assisting on.  The tanks absorb, dodge,<br/>\nparry, block and simply have the HPs to *take* quite a bit more damage than<br/>\nI do.  That&#39;s what they&#39;re for.  If you&#39;ve got four frogs, one engaged and<br/>\nthree standers-by, then with your 50% resist rate that you quoted, you&#39;ve<br/>\ngot two frogs pounding you constantly.  I&#39;d survive 10-12 rounds with buffs<br/>\nand some lucky rolls.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecondly, if you have two or more tanks in your group then the mana of the<br/>\ncleric is better spent (i.e. better mob damage/damage taken ratio) to have<br/>\nlet the tanks have done the tanking.  What I&#39;m saying is that you may do<br/>\n(and I&#39;m just pulling numbers out of thin air here) 200 points of damage to<br/>\na frog while you&#39;ve taken 400 points of damage, wheras a tank will have done<br/>\n400 points of damage to a frog and have taken, say, 400 himself.  So if the<br/>\ncleric heals you both, the cleric has burned the same amount of mana for 200<br/>\npoints of damage from you and 400 from the warrior.  I realize that it&#39;s not<br/>\nalways this clearcut, and I don&#39;t mean to diminish the amount of damage that<br/>\nbards do, it&#39;s not insignificant.  From the Brian Hook post:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe melee classes are arranged such that, from greatest damage to least<br/>\ndamage, the ideal layout is as follows:<br/>\n<br/>\n1.) monk<br/>\n2.) warrior/rogue<br/>\n3.) shadow knight/paladin/ranger<br/>\n4.) bard<br/>\n5.) cleric/shaman/druid<br/>\n6.) pure casters<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the order in which the players should stand from the battle.<br/>\nLullaby puts you at #1 with every non-engaged mob.<br/>\n<br/>\nCrier Sharpsong<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; As for Lullaby, Enchanter Mesmerize is better, but if I&#39;m not in<br/>\n&gt; a group with<br/>\n&gt; Mes, it&#39;s still darned useful.  In Lower Guk (savant, exe, scribe<br/>\n&gt; rooms), at<br/>\n&gt; level 34, I was getting about 50% resists.  This shuts down half<br/>\n&gt; of the goblins<br/>\n&gt; in excess of the one targetted (assuming that the group is smart<br/>\n&gt; enough to<br/>\n&gt; target one at a time).  In a four-goblin pull, that neutralizes<br/>\n&gt; one and a half<br/>\n&gt; goblins.  (This is the equivalent of Pixie Striking each of the<br/>\n&gt; MOBs, without<br/>\n&gt; all of the annoying retargeting).  With more targets, it&#39;s even better.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To show how situational this is:  1) it&#39;s not worth it if you<br/>\n&gt; only have two<br/>\n&gt; targets, and Pixie Strike might be better for three; 2) if you<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t have a<br/>\n&gt; Cleric, you&#39;ll probably die; 3) if the dungeon is empty of other<br/>\n&gt; players, I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t sing AE songs unless we&#39;re close to a zone point.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kenross Cantoforjado, 34 songs, Innoruuk<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
