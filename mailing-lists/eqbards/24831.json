But also, often leaders<br/>\naren&#39;t clear or get some bug up their butts and end up wasting our time and<br/>\ntheirs because they &quot;know better.&quot;  Our old raid leader was absolutely the<br/>\nworst about this, he knew everything, and although we were successful, he<br/>\nclaimed all success as his.  And still does, even when he&#39;s gone.  <br/>\n<br/>\nParadigm does pretty well overall I&#39;d say, but one of the things that<br/>\nstrikes me as hugely amusing is when people in other guilds say &quot;I want to<br/>\nbe in PD, I&#39;m tired of all this dying!&quot;  I just laugh and ask them how many<br/>\ntimes they think we died to Yelinak before we killed him, or Dain, or omg<br/>\nlet&#39;s not even talk about Trak.  Raids fail all the time and I think its the<br/>\nmark or a good group or guild to have the perseverence to keep trying until<br/>\nthey get it right.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk need coffee, think I&#39;m sounding preachy sorry :P<br/>\n<br/>\nHalana 60th Shammy<br/>\nTani 52nd Bardette<br/>\nSolusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Matt DeBarger [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mattdeba@...\">mattdeba@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Friday, May 25, 2001 7:02 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [eqbards] How are people getting the white scales?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Leadership means nothing when the people there don&#39;t listen <br/>\n&gt; to commands.<br/>\n&gt; Maybe Veeshan is the exception in this case, but I have seen <br/>\n&gt; the leader of<br/>\n&gt; one of our most powerful guilds fail on a Vox run due to complete<br/>\n&gt; incompetence of the people there.
