I am in a small guild.  We have like 20<br/>\npeople, the highest is 35 I think. (I am the only bard, talk about<br/>\npressure to get my Mana Song).  I would be dissapointed if the 35 cleric<br/>\ndecided to go FOH or someone, but it would also tell me that he wasn&#39;t<br/>\nloyal to us, and thus we&#39;re probably better off without him (I am just<br/>\nusing him as en example, he&#39;s a great guy who has helped me out MANY<br/>\ntimes).]<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe this is an advantage of being on an old server (Veeshan) with one<br/>\nabsurdly powerful guild and serveral others who are powerful enough to<br/>\ndo a planes or dragon raid with just guild members.  (At least three<br/>\nothers, not to mention the one that left when the server split).  If you<br/>\nwant to regularly do planes raids and dragons when you get to lvl 46+,<br/>\nthen you should join one of those guilds.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs I said be angry with the person who left you not with the people he<br/>\nwent to...<br/>\n-- <br/>\nWe now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>\n<br/>\nMatt DeBarger</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
