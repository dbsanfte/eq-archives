I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-390125635\">The sex of the art director means nothing.  As a female who has worked in <br/>\nthree highly technical and previously all-male (as well as still 95% male)<br/>\nfields.  I will say that some of the most discrimanatory and backwards (as to<br/>\nsexism) statements and decisions have been made by females.  Who either:<br/>\n - honestly believe they are inferior<br/>\n - fear challenging a male as a &quot;lone&quot; female may cost them thier job at the<br/>\n   extreme, or some peer respect at a minimum (often it does)<br/>\n - are trying to prove they can be &quot;one of the boys&quot; and understand the<br/>\n   male world (not always bad - but means you&#39;ll see females making oddly <br/>\n   male choices).<br/>\n<br/>\nOne example.<br/>\nI was once called on the carpet and emphatically told to &quot;never, ever again<br/>\nask a question of a male in a meeting when the question *may* lead him to<br/>\ndiscover that something could have been done better (and thus insult him)&quot;<br/>\nin the late 80&#39;s BY A FEMALE.  Of course, the muckety-muck male, who&#39;s<br/>\nresponse<br/>\nto my technical question was &quot;I&#39;ll look into that&quot;, was incredibly pleased<br/>\nI&#39;d given him a good question to ask his techies and thrilled when they fixed<br/>\nthe problem and made him LOOK GOOD!  The techies in question were my office<br/>\nmates and had been dying for resources or an excuse to fix that problem, and<br/>\nthanked me for creating the opportunity to get it &quot;air time&quot; at the<br/>\nmuckety-muck<br/>\nlevel so they could fix it. The male was ever after appreciative of my<br/>\ntechnical<br/>\nproblem solving to the point of wanting me to transfer to his group, and the <br/>\nfemale became a deadly political enemy.  We were the only two females in<br/>\nthe area.<br/>\nThe company was no backwoods small shop, but the state headquarters for one<br/>\nof the<br/>\ntop 3 phone/internet providers in the country.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSure, EQ graphics are very sexist.  I&#39;m a female, and knowing what I know <br/>\nabout internet and RPG likely customers, I very well might have decided that<br/>\nthe current graphics were the right job decision.  Yep, as a female.  Its<br/>\nstill sexist, and I still hate the lack of graphics which would appeal to <br/>\nfemale player.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;&gt; Women, they look much more like Rangers than their female counterparts.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; It seems quite obvious the Dev Team is an all male affair.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Heh. So many people say this but in fact the art director was a woman. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
