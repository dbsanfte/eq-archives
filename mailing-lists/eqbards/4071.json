You can always hunt Wisps and zombies on wisp <br/>\nisland, (between eurdin and Qeynos) good money but minimal exp at 15.  I <br/>\nfinanced my set of banded and my dirk that way.  Gnoll Reavers south of the <br/>\nbridge in East Karana have good loot but the Velcro wolves make this a bit <br/>\ndangerous.  Take a group of three or four depending on level.  On the other side<br/>\nof the world you might try the Aqua goblins in Dagor&#39;s Cauldron, they have <br/>\npretty good loot, just avoid the Lords.  There is always crushbone and unrest <br/>\nbut these areas are very crowded.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood Hunting,<br/>\nBujold, 18th chorus<br/>\nXwgony<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________ Reply Separator _________________________________<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Blackened Iron Armor *SPOILER* (sort of)<br/>\nAuthor:  Non-HP-given (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:given@...\">given@...</a>) at HP-ColSprings,mimegw5<br/>\nDate:    7/21/99 11:14 AM<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Michal Hobson&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:given@...\">given@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n     <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Message to all the Players over 30th level who have over a 1000p in bank <br/>\n </span></blockquote>and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; nothing to spend it on:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am not Proud<br/>\n     <br/>\n </span></blockquote>I second that!
