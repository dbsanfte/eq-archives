I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; done some limited experimenting, mostly on very light greens so that I can<br/>\n&gt; get the hang of it, however I&#39;m finding the timing of this song to be<br/>\n&gt; something I just can&#39;t grasp.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Generally I select a target, Charm, swtich targets and attack, Selo&#39;s,<br/>\nHymn,<br/>\n&gt; they back to charm.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Unfortunately, I seem to charm too early every single time, the mob breaks<br/>\n&gt; charm and I get beat on for a full cycle while I try to get charm going<br/>\n&gt; again. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
