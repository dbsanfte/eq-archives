I<br/>\nwas trying to point out that separating them out was meaningless which those<br/>\nexamples would bear out.  How the 25th bard beat the ranger I can&#39;t fathom.<br/>\nI dueled a 15th level ranger when I was 15th and despite having 40 points of<br/>\nac over him he smoked me and stayed above 2 bubbles.  If I ran around and<br/>\ntried to heal he shot me with his bow, and in melee it was a near even trade<br/>\nof blows.  It should be even worse at 24th with rangers getting Parry at<br/>\n18th and double attack at 20th, ick!  When I hit 20th I will try again on a<br/>\n20th ranger, but seriously doubt I will win a real duel with him.  What I&#39;d<br/>\nlike to try is a group of three bards vs three of any other class at the<br/>\nsame levels.  I think we would nearly win all those duels, but unless on the<br/>\nPvP servers will never find out unless I can get some friends into the<br/>\nArena.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Eric Boller [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eboller@...\">eboller@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, November 15, 1999 11:53 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Re: Bards vs. casters, melee, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Eric Boller &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eboller@...\">eboller@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nActually, I was reading a post by someone at the<br/>\nConcert Hall website describing his duels.  I&#39;ll just<br/>\ngo ahead and post the message rather than describe it:<br/>\n<br/>\nThex<br/>\n***********************<br/>\nYou&#39;d be surprised exactly how effective us bards are<br/>\nin duels. You just need to know what you&#39;re doing. So<br/>\nfar I&#39;m 4-1 and my one loss was really in my mind not<br/>\na true loss. You&#39;ll see that below<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 22 bard vs. level 23 monk (Monk won):<br/>\nHe won because we were still grouped and I couldn&#39;t<br/>\nsing heal song without healing him too :( If I had<br/>\nknown that I needed to disband first I would have and<br/>\nprobably won. The final score was me at 0 HP (he beat<br/>\nme down then bandaged me alive again), he was at less<br/>\nthan 1 bubble. Of course I&#39;m good friends with this<br/>\nmonk and he refuses to ever duel me again. He says<br/>\nhe&#39;d prefer being known as the one person to beat me.<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 25 bard vs. level 24 Wood-elf Ranger (Bard won):<br/>\nThis was an interesting fight. I actually decided to<br/>\nmelee her, and the result of the fight was me at 4<br/>\nbubbles, her at one when she yeilded. It was an<br/>\ninteresting fight, but I won.<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 25 bard vs. level 24 Troll Warrior (Bard won):<br/>\nThis fight was a joke. He did a grand total of about<br/>\n80 points of damage on me the entire fight, which I<br/>\npromptly healed. Between chaining, bellowing, and COD,<br/>\nhe went down without even batting an eyelash. He even<br/>\ntried to fool me at one point by yeilding then<br/>\nattacking me when I got in close to tell him to zone.<br/>\nThe result of the fight was a fully healed bard vs. a<br/>\nTroll warrior at less than a bubble of health (he<br/>\nfinally yeilded for real). The nice aspect is it took<br/>\nhim down a couple of notches and he won&#39;t duel anybody<br/>\nanymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 28 bard vs. level 29 High Elf Wizard (Bard won):<br/>\nThat&#39;s right, I took down a wizard, and it&#39;s so easy<br/>\nit&#39;s not even funny. He got one spell off on me the<br/>\nentire fight, which I did a full resist on. Use the<br/>\nspell disrupt aspect of BBB and they&#39;re cake. Never<br/>\ngot a spell off and I meleed him dead.<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 28 bard vs. level 31 High Elf Wizard (Bard won):<br/>\nThis fight was a bitch but my best duel to date. He<br/>\nhad Jboots which sucked, and exploited the fact that<br/>\nmy connection was bad that evening. We started with<br/>\nthe typical BBB vs. a caster, and he did get a few<br/>\nspells off on me, but not many. When we were both at<br/>\nhalf health I hid and healed back up to full. We<br/>\nstarted at it again, and that&#39;s when I learned the<br/>\ncoolest mid level bard tactic against casters in the<br/>\nbook. He finally got me rooted and started backing off<br/>\nfor the kill. Just charm them, thy run right up next<br/>\nto you, and can&#39;t cast for the duration. All 5 times<br/>\nhe was able to root me I charmed him and meleed him<br/>\nwhen it wore off. To mess with them even more, make<br/>\nthem stand up, sit down, report your name, etc. Fun to<br/>\nthe bystanders. With my magic res, bellow, selo&#39;s<br/>\nconstant chain (stoped those JBoots cold) and charm I<br/>\ntook him down. We both respect each other a lot more<br/>\ntoo.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo don&#39;t believe for a second that we&#39;re not good<br/>\nduelers. If you know how to play your class and use<br/>\nevery bardic trick in the book we&#39;re pains in the ass.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nDelanos Songslinger<br/>\nBard of the 30th song, follower of her Lady, Erolisi<br/>\nMarr<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; To further turn your argument around: <br/>\n&gt; Bards cannot beat any caster consistently in pure<br/>\n&gt; magical combat.
