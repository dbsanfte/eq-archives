(eg I<br/>\nneed more DASD again, all my apps are out of date, the 64 MB of RAM fills<br/>\nall the slots, my BF would nag me less if I gave him my current PC & got him<br/>\nhooked on EQ, it&#39;s a mini-tower and not every motherboard will physically<br/>\nfit in it (though I&#39;m not sure how much of a problem that is anymore), I<br/>\nshould really replace the winmodem, and the list goes on.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Sounds like your friends didn&#39;t know what they were talking <br/>\n&gt; about.  Gateway<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t mix/match motherboards.  They have 1 motherboard for <br/>\n&gt; one chip type<br/>\n&gt; (Pentium) and another for Athlons (you have to, they&#39;re not <br/>\n&gt; compatible)<br/>\n&gt; Generally speaking, up to about a year ago, Gateway shipped <br/>\n&gt; 90% of systems<br/>\n&gt; with the 440BX (argueably the best chipset ever) board from <br/>\n&gt; Intel (if you<br/>\n&gt; overclock it it IS the best board out and can use 133mhz SDRAM on it).<br/>\n&gt; They had a couple other boards that shipped with E-Series <br/>\n&gt; (IE: Business)<br/>\n&gt; systems but the customer systems were all shipped based on <br/>\n&gt; 440 BX boards.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I should point out that my experience with Gateways desktops has been with<br/>\nthe P series (which I can&#39;t recall having troubles with) G-200s (which came<br/>\nwith different video cards, NICs, and memory, if not motherboards) and the E<br/>\nseries.  Portables were Solo 2000s, 2100s, 2300s, and 2500.  The different<br/>\ncomponents in the desktops caused problems with drivers when trying to use<br/>\none image on every PC in a company.  The portables were just plain crap.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I shouldn&#39;t say that about the portables.  Perhaps I just saw all<br/>\nthe lemons Gateway put out, but odds were you&#39;d be replacing parts inside a<br/>\nyear and your replacement parts had as much chance of working as Lullaby has<br/>\nof controlling a train of blue mobs.  Although the failure rate on<br/>\nreplacement parts may have been the fault of Unisys (contracted for hardware<br/>\nreplacement) and not Gateway.  Still, Unisys didn&#39;t come into the picture<br/>\nuntil the Solos themselves started breaking down.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; At any rate, nice system.  But you got lied to about Gateway <br/>\n&gt; ;)  (I should<br/>\n&gt; know.  I work at a Gateway Manufacturing center as a <br/>\n&gt; contracted Network<br/>\n&gt; Engineer)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Guess we should be careful what companies we slag off, eh? ;^)<br/>\n<br/>\nKevin, I&#39;ve got no doubts you know more about hardware than I do, but I take<br/>\nnothing back.  I&#39;ve had a worse experience supporting Gateway hardware than<br/>\nI have had with any other manufacturer.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPeace<br/>\nEvulia</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
