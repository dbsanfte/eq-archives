If you are playing the invisibility song,<br/>\nyou can&#39;t sneak so that option is out.  Would be nice if the invisibility<br/>\nsong didn&#39;t gray out the Sneak button.

Might this not let you sneak past those creatures we<br/>\n&gt; &#39;think&#39; are seeing us invis?  Maybe they are just hearing us and reacting<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; that?  I know its logical which means its probably silly and wrong, but it<br/>\n&gt; sounds good.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tKitasi<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; IMO, hide and sneak should work the same for bards as it does for rogues.<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; agree with everyone else that the two skills as they are currently<br/>\n&gt; implemented are worthless for bards.  If we could sneak while hiding there<br/>\n&gt; may be some opportunity where the skill could come in handy.  Verant<br/>\n&gt; shouldn&#39;t even include the two skills as part of the equation that<br/>\n&gt; determines class balance for the bard.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
