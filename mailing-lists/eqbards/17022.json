Did you do the timings on your lvl 50 bard singing<br/>\nthe songs on himself and then the enchanter casting spells on himself?<br/>\nWhat was the original weapon delay?  Not that these numbers aren&#39;t grossly<br/>\napparent, but if you did use the songs/spells on different characters, how<br/>\ndid you control for intrinsic differences?  Also, I take it these numbers<br/>\nwere from combat?<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I&#39;m just asking how you did the experiment :)  Frankly, I&#39;m not<br/>\nconvinced that controlling for any of these things would make a<br/>\nsignificant change in the numbers you obtained.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGiven all that, I suppose the question is: should I be nauseated?  I<br/>\nwonder if higher level enchanter buffs are even more superior to the lvl<br/>\n16 buff.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSinistral of Karana  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wed, 29 Mar 2000 <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I did some timings with my L18 enchanter and his level 12 Quickness<br/>\nspell while Karana was down last night:&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\n               Time   Swings   Delay   %chg Delay   %chg Speed<br/>\n&gt; Normal       177.7    50     35.54        -            -<br/>\n&gt; Warsong(50)  285.8   100     28.58     -19.58%       24.35%<br/>\n&gt; Anthem       162.5    50     32.50      -8.55%        9.35%<br/>\n&gt; Celerity     147.8    50     29.56     -16.83%       20.23%<br/>\n&gt; Beserk(50)   148.1    49     30.22     -14.96%       17.59%<br/>\n&gt; Verses       136.9    50     27.38     -22.96%       29.80%<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Quick(18)     51.9    19     27.32     -23.14%       30.11%<br/>\n&gt;               27.3    10     27.30     -23.19%       30.18% </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
