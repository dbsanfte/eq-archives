I was Pixie Striking Sonic Bats and Lava<br/>\nBeetles in Sol B last night and I thought it seemed like I was having a<br/>\npretty good run of luck.  I definitely *do* remember its giving me the<br/>\nmessage and the bats hitting me soon after, but maybe that was just an<br/>\nordinary short stun.  Man it feels good to stun those bats for a change.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an aside, I was grouped with a very nice 50th level Necromancer named<br/>\nCryonax last night.  Cryonax was the 2nd person to hit level 50 Fennin Ro -<br/>\nand he still plays just for fun.
