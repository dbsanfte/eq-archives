Where rubicite used to drop?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only thing in there that sees invis is the gators (wtf?) and probably<br/>\nthe Avatar.  There ain&#39;t no lizards what see invis.  I&#39;ve walked right up to<br/>\nthe throne with Tae Ew Templar sittin&#39; on top and just stood there while<br/>\ninvised when they were black/white to me.  Now maybe this has *changed* at<br/>\nsome point, but CT has always worked that way for me.  I zone in, get a soft<br/>\nmist to surround me and then jog through the maze and up to the top of the<br/>\ntemple.  I do this all the time, bumping into Heralds, Judicators,<br/>\nJusticars, etc. all the way up.  They don&#39;t see me or I&#39;d know about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd something that bears mentioning: Another thread has talked about how<br/>\nrelatively easy it is to get Shin Greaves and Gauntlets from Lower Guk at a<br/>\nlevel too low to fight there, and that&#39;s true.  However, those that haven&#39;t<br/>\nbeen to Lower Guk need to be warned that invis doesn&#39;t work against the<br/>\nfrogs down there, it only lets you get there through Upper Guk safely.  I<br/>\njust wanted that to be clear.<br/>\n<br/>\nCrier Sharpsong<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: James Schuldes &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Invis inside CT?  You got to be joking! &lt;g&gt; Every time I try the<br/>\n&gt; maze, some<br/>\n&gt; freaking caster froggy has see invis and beats on me.  If I don&#39;t have a<br/>\n&gt; caster & tank with me to beat it down, I am done for.   And I have never<br/>\n&gt; done a nekkid run inside CT.  But I have done lots and lots of<br/>\n&gt; looting after<br/>\n&gt; getting rezzed behind the tree.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I guess the different tactics come from the differences in our groups.  My<br/>\n&gt; CT time was spent with my regular group: cleric/wiz, sk/wiz, troll war,<br/>\n&gt; ench/necro & me - bard.  These are all players I have literally grown up<br/>\n&gt; with -- from level one in a couple cases.  Consent them to loot<br/>\n&gt; me? I wish I<br/>\n&gt; could make it permanent command.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sylly<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; p.s. I am sorely tempted to go back and learn that damn maze.<br/>\n&gt; There has to<br/>\n&gt; be a trick to it and I feel like I am missing something.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; p.s.s. if you are not seeing Specs in Feer it&#39;s cuz you stay close to that<br/>\n&gt; wall as you run past the spec cave.  or you don&#39;t have many lev 45<br/>\n&gt; enchanters who are soloing them.  I know I have spend many hours with my<br/>\n&gt; enchanter fiend. she pulls - yes from the cave - yes you can<br/>\n&gt; easily get 3 in<br/>\n&gt; which case she will mez then charm.  when there is only one, I chain it -<br/>\n&gt; she fears it - I beat on it and she nukes it or dot&#39;s it - whatever off<br/>\n&gt; ench&#39;s have and I chain and melee while its feared.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; \t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; \t\tFrom:\tJasonF [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JasonF@...\">JasonF@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; \t\tSent:\tTuesday, November 30, 1999 1:38 PM<br/>\n&gt; \t\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; \t\tSubject:\tRE: [eqbards] Cazic-Thule: A recommendation<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; \t\tFrom: &quot;JasonF&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JasonF@...\">JasonF@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; \t\tYou&#39;re joking, right?

Afraid of a Bouncer with<br/>\n&gt; Selo&#39;s?  Heck I<br/>\n&gt; \t\troutinely smack the Bouncer when he comes up to the CT zone<br/>\n&gt; and run him back<br/>\n&gt; \t\tout into the Feerrott so that he doesn&#39;t kill half the folks<br/>\n&gt; resting at the<br/>\n&gt; \t\tzone.
