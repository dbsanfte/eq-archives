A fix is made to a piece of code and now it must<br/>\nbe tested. Since the dev team does not have oodles of free time on their<br/>\nhands, they cannot properly level a necro to the neccessary testing points<br/>\nor they can&#39;t run scenarios through a variety of different spawn point<br/>\nsituations. (Take the whole shaman alchemy thing for example) They test a<br/>\nfew variations to make sure that it works as they expect. The other, and<br/>\nmore important thing that I have learned in situations like this is this.<br/>\nThe customer can always find more inventive ways of breaking something than<br/>\nthe coder can.<br/>\n\tI think the other thing is that they are trying to make up for the Levitate<br/>\n&#39;fix&#39; that went in. They didn&#39;t mention the fix to anyone and it never<br/>\nreally got tested all that much on the test server. Then *wham*! Hello<br/>\nProduction. This actually makes a lot of sense in the testing world. A<br/>\ntester would be told what was changed and asked to test it, not just told<br/>\nthat there may or may not be a change somewhere and be expected to test the<br/>\nentire system.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tGood Journey<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tSineras Silverlyre, The Divine Alliance (Cazic-Thule)<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Kimes, Dean W.

In an excerpt<br/>\nfrom the test server:<br/>\n<br/>\nSolution:<br/>\n<br/>\nIdeally, Feign Death should work like Invisibility, where summoned pets<br/>\nsuicide and the charmed ones break Charm.  We do not want, however, to<br/>\nadversely affect lower level Necromancers to such a large degree.  What we<br/>\ndo recognize is the need to prevent higher level Necros from exploiting key<br/>\nspawn points.  Hence, when you Feign Death, any charmed NPC will immediately<br/>\nbreak Charm.  However, summoned NPCs (pets) will not be affected.  While<br/>\nthis still allows the use of the Feign Death tactic with your summoned pet,<br/>\nit does not imbalance the game and many dungeon spawns to the degree that<br/>\ncharming an NPC does.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe would appreciate diligent testing of this change, to insure that no<br/>\nunforeseen problems have been caused by it.<br/>\n<br/>\n-The EverQuest Team<br/>\n<br/>\nSo now they are saying they would appreciate diligent testing of a change?<br/>\nWtf?  Who is the customer and who is the service provider here?  I guess<br/>\nthis tells us everything we need to know about Verant test procedure.  Throw<br/>\nthe code out on the test server and hope some player puts it to task.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n\tmore disillusioned than ever<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hey Freelancers:  Find your next project through JobSwarm!<br/>\n  You can even make money in your sleep by referring friends.<br/>\n&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm1\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm1</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
