You can get there without<br/>\n </span></blockquote>playing<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; any songs. But parties are going to question what good you are. Why does<br/>\n </span></blockquote>any<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; hunting party need a bard? Really... they don&#39;t. So you need to really<br/>\n&gt; impress people ya don&#39;t know. God I had to get a full suit of bronze so I<br/>\n&gt; could get into parties at level 20 because of all the damn twinks.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>At  a meager level 13, I grouped with several lvl 20+ characters the other<br/>\nday in Highpass who were delighted to have me in the party.  Of course I got<br/>\nno xp, but that was never my intention.  (I did make about 20pp in just<br/>\nunder an hour and bought my Dragoon Dirk for essentially no out of pocket<br/>\nexpense.  Hehe!!)  I didn&#39;t even have to fight, just equipped my lute, made<br/>\nsure I was within range of them all as they were fighting, twisted heal with<br/>\nanthem and ocassionally tossed in a bellow on the rare orc that conned less<br/>\nthan red to me.  Their downtime was so minimal, it was sick.  I was<br/>\nconstantly getting &quot;I love bards&quot; and &quot;I love this song!&quot;  They were<br/>\nactually getting bored waiting for the next orc train to show.  Which was<br/>\npretty cool considering when I first arrived, they had all just sprinted out<br/>\nof the zone away from a train!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And twisting is not an exploit, but rather a &quot;feature&quot; of our class.

Sure, and your party will boot you out when<br/>\n&gt; the first tank comes along because you are doing 20 points of damage a<br/>\n&gt; round, constantly frenzying the mobs, and don&#39;t add anything to the party<br/>\n </span></blockquote>as<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; a whole.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Doh, so close to actually saying something positive about the bard in<br/>\nEverQuest.  No offense, but if you want to put in your 2cp on how bad you<br/>\nbelieve the bard is, please reserve your comments to those which might<br/>\nactually be helpful or, save it for the message boards.  The vast majority<br/>\nof the people on this list LOVE their bards and play them religiously.  Some<br/>\neven continue to add postive input to the list long after their bard has<br/>\nplayed out or achieved lvl 50 (Much Congrats Shada!!!!)  I love this list<br/>\nfor all the useful info I get.  I don&#39;t want to hear how bad I am going to<br/>\nsuck when I get to level X.  Seems that we have several people here that<br/>\nhave experienced quite the contrary.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my opinion,<br/>\nWeiland of Freeport<br/>\nErollisi Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
