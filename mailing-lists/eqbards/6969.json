This means that if <br/>\nyou have 210 intelligence and only 90 dex, you would probably be better off <br/>\nto go back to 200 int and have 100 dex.<br/>\nIt is not the case that you get no extra mana from having 230 int as <br/>\ncompared with 200 int, but it is a great deal less than you would get from <br/>\nhaving an increase of say 170 int to 200 int.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn Swiftsong - Karana server<br/>\nMaster Craftsmen of Societus Argenti</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
