Oh well, we&#39;re all entitled.  Nah it<br/>\nisn&#39;t that I couldn&#39;t swing weapons really.  It&#39;s that if I am Lullabying<br/>\nwith a Lute I literally cannot do anything else until Lullaby is no longer<br/>\nneeded.  I may as well walk off and get a sandwich.  At least if I could<br/>\nswing my weapons I be doing something other than just watching the screen<br/>\nwaiting till we were down to one mob.  Now if Lullaby required a Lute and<br/>\nlasted two ticks I&#39;d be ecstatic about the change.
