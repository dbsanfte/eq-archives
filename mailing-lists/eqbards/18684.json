There are<br/>\nrarely any more than 10 people there, and they&#39;re mostly Iksars.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are three entrances to the Swamp from Firiona Vie - one to the left of<br/>\nthe zone and two very close together on the right.  I go in at the right;<br/>\neither entrance as they both lead to the same spot. If you come across the<br/>\nhead of a large Iksar statue, you&#39;re at the wrong spot and should head West.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot far from the zone, there&#39;s a spot near the Southwest edge of the Froglok<br/>\nvillage where three frogs spawn - usually Gaz Warriors, occasionally a<br/>\nShaman.  You&#39;ll also come across large Bloodvein mosquitos, Man Eating<br/>\nPlants and Giant Leeches in that area.<br/>\n<br/>\nCareful use of Lament will pick off unwanted frogs. You&#39;ll have the place to<br/>\nyourself. Be very, very careful if you want to explore the Froglok village -<br/>\nthey move fast when they aggro (*rubs bruises*)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
