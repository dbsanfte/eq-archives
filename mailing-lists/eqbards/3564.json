That I haven&#39;t done yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpeaking of horns - I&#39;ve seen on this list several times where a mino horn<br/>\ndoubles between wind and brass - methinks this isn&#39;t correct. I can get it<br/>\nto do a wind song - and although it works with brass - so does singing - so<br/>\nnow I&#39;m back to shlepping a how orchestra around with me again.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 07:17 AM 7/14/99 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Tracey &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:thershey@...\">thershey@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hail friends,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;As simple question I cannot figure out for the life of me:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;How do you know how much damage your Chords of Dissonance dishes<br/>\n&gt;out? When I hit a critter with it, I only get the message that he<br/>\n&gt;&quot;winces&quot;. Now, I know I&#39;m hitting pretty good at lev 17 using<br/>\n&gt;a mandolin because I&#39;ve tried only using the chord and not attacking<br/>\n&gt;and the crit&#39;s life bar goes down at a good rate. But frankly,<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;d like to know exactly how much damage I&#39;m putting to him<br/>\n&gt;so I can measure its use against Bellow.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks for any info. you can pass along.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Yours in Song,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;A little bard named True<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-- <br/>\n&gt;Tracey Amey Hershey<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:thershey@...\">thershey@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;ONElist users:  YOU can win a $100 gift certificate to Amazon.com.  <br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Check out the FRIENDS & FAMILY program to find out how.
