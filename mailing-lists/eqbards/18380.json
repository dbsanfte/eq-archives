I think you mean Pinata (&quot;Peen-ya-ta&quot;  -- Pin~ata - with<br/>\nan &quot;en-yay&quot;) but a good idea never the less.  I grew up in the southwest in<br/>\nthe 60&#39;s (ugh i am really old!) and we always had a Pinata at birthday<br/>\nparties.   In case you don&#39;t know, it&#39;s a paper mache animal figure that is<br/>\nfilled with candy and suspended from a cord. Each child is blindfolded and<br/>\nspun about just a bit - then pointed in the general direction of the pinata<br/>\nto swing at it with a mini-baseball bat.  Eventually someone makes contact<br/>\nand it breaks open and scatters candy everywhere and all the kids scramble<br/>\nfor some.  Maybe a druid in wolfform as the pinata and all the &#39;kids&#39;<br/>\nreeling from excess alcohol to simulate blindfolded - or some one who can<br/>\ncast darkness is the pinata?<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Paul Kline&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pdkline@...\">pdkline@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, May 05, 2000 11:09 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] A Little Help<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hi Jeff,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This is always fun.
