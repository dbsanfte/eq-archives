I know people were yelling that free carapaces and runes<br/>\nin CT and guk when they were killing the stuff. So dont go and spend your<br/>\nfortunes on every item, remember, if a group is just camping the items for<br/>\nxp, means they all have the items allready or dont need em, so they couldnt<br/>\ncare less about em since they&#39;re all no drop except for the Lambent stones.<br/>\nI say within a week you&#39;ll be able to loot everything for free practically<br/>\nif the groups camping them is just going for xp<br/>\n<br/>\nlast night i saw 2 runes being givin away in CT but i was too far away in<br/>\nthe temple to make it there<br/>\nand also a carapace in guk but every run we made there we had to gate out<br/>\nbecause of people making trains of greater iced bones. and finally when we<br/>\ngot to the gargs, we killed 2 of em, and got no carapace.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople are leaving the shin leggings and shin gloves on the corpses of the<br/>\nfroggies. These are groups that cant go deep in the dungeon and just hunt<br/>\nthe zone line, where they pull tons of this stuff, thats where i got my shin<br/>\npants and my buddy looted some free gloves....<br/>\n<br/>\nMinkin<br/>\nSol Ro<br/>\nLevel 35 bard<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\tRokenn Swiftsong [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rokenn@...\">rokenn@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tThursday, October 14, 1999 3:51 PM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject:\tRe: [eqbards] Purchase prices for quest components<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Rokenn Swiftsong&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rokenn@...\">rokenn@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Until I gain 4-5 more levels, the only way I will be able to acquire any<br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the bard quest components is to purchase the looting rights from someone.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Because these are all new items, the market for them hasn&#39;t really been<br/>\n&gt; &gt;established yet.  As a result, I don&#39;t have a really good idea on how<br/>\n&gt; much<br/>\n&gt; &gt;PP to offer for the looting rights.  If anyone out there gets a quest<br/>\n&gt; &gt;component by paying for the looting rights, request you post how much you<br/>\n&gt; &gt;paid for it.  That will give me and other bards in my situation a good<br/>\n&gt; &gt;starting point in our negotiations.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Thanks<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I can understand wanting to get Lambent armor as soon as you can.  <br/>\n&gt; Personally though I do not plan on buying any of the components (except<br/>\n&gt; for <br/>\n&gt; the gems of course), why?  Well nearly all the equipment I have, I have <br/>\n&gt; acquired by trading, purchasing, or as gifts from friends.  For Lambent I <br/>\n&gt; want the satisfaction of killing and looting these items myself.  If it <br/>\n&gt; takes me long longer then other folks so be it, but it&#39;s just what I feel<br/>\n&gt; is <br/>\n&gt; the right way to go.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As for prices on some of the items, I would guess for the first few weeks <br/>\n&gt; the looting rights may be expensive.  Also some of the items are not bad<br/>\n&gt; in <br/>\n&gt; there own right (most seem to be at least plate AC and some have small <br/>\n&gt; bonus).  If you want to buy you way want to wait a week or two for the <br/>\n&gt; market to saturate. My guess may be in the 50 to 200 plat range depending<br/>\n&gt; on <br/>\n&gt; the item.  Also remember that after 35th lvl or so most players stop<br/>\n&gt; caring <br/>\n&gt; about how much plat they have unless they are heavy into trade skills.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Good luck!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Rokenn Swiftsong - Karana server<br/>\n&gt; Master Craftsmen of Societus Argenti<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a><br/>\n&gt; with the subject lol. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
