In my experience no stone has<br/>\nbeen left unturned to provide a game with subtlety and imagination.  There are<br/>\nsome unexpected things that have cropped up with 50,000 people playing the<br/>\ngame, however, but I think you have to expect that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI fully expect that one of the subtleties of the Bard class is that as you<br/>\nmature into the role of Bard that your songs will, over time, start to do more<br/>\ndamage than your weapons when instruments are equipped.  So if you&#39;re &quot;joe<br/>\nbard&quot; that plays 6 hours a week and doesn&#39;t read these messages or do as much<br/>\nresearch into your class as we obviously do, you can still play the game as a<br/>\n&quot;bad tank with a healing song&quot;.  However, if you&#39;re like us and divorce your<br/>\nwife &#39;cause your family is keeping your from getting to level 50, you develop<br/>\nyour skills more fully.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere is the crossover point that songs do more damage?  I dunno, I&#39;m only<br/>\nlevel 20 and I would very seriously doubt that I&#39;ve reached it yet.  My guess<br/>\nis that by around level 30 it should be noticable.  I would think that by<br/>\nlevel 50 it should be blatanly obvious to you that you should use songs and<br/>\ninstruments.  Can any 50th bards confirm this and/or estimate where the<br/>\ncrossover point is from weapons to songs?<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the greatest things about being a bard is the on-the-fly flexibility<br/>\nthat we have.  Last night in Runnyeye my party members gave me a backhanded<br/>\ncompliment on the way that I reacted to the fight (yeah, I&#39;m braggin&#39; a bit -<br/>\ndeal with it).  If we were fighting plain old goblins I&#39;d be playing buffing<br/>\nsongs, but when a shaman or other caster type showed up, I&#39;d switch hotkey<br/>\nbanks and start playing MR buffs.  It really surprised my party members to see<br/>\ntheir buff icons change from Anthem and Hymn (plus Bellows) to Guardian,<br/>\nElemental and Hymn during a fight.  &quot;What&#39;s with all these buff icons changing<br/>\naround in battle?&quot;  &lt;grin&gt;  Just the bard doing her job.  Back to the subject<br/>\nthough - these sorts of reactions to battle flow are something that all<br/>\ntalented bards do, and their effectiveness is greatly enhanced by our<br/>\ninstruments.<br/>\n<br/>\nCrier - 20th song Bard on Fennin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\nJason A.

It&#39;s<br/>\nreally<br/>\n&gt; &gt; really hard to say, but I MAY be doing more damage now...do we have hard<br/>\n&gt; &gt; figures on DDD? I am very very curious.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t have any figures (though I may get some now that they<br/>\n&gt; fixed the disarm thing and my friends *want* to go to the<br/>\n&gt; arena).  But I did play with it extensively around L24-26<br/>\n&gt; against tidal lords.  DDD, CoD, and Hymn played with just a<br/>\n&gt; horn was slightly worse than with my weapons (dirk and barbed<br/>\n&gt; whip).  Played with a horn and lute it was slightly better<br/>\n&gt; than my weapons.  This was against a single opponent of<br/>\n&gt; course.  If there were multiple opponents, DDD and CoD were<br/>\n&gt; far far better as long as Hymn could keep me alive long enough<br/>\n&gt; to kill them all.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
