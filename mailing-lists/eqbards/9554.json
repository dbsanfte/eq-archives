So what? The Karana s are just as dangerous. Hill Giants, Griffs, werewolves, Evil Eyes, Wolves, Lions, Bandits, Gnoll Reavers.  West Commons has Ghouls,","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1186902506\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;From: Ken Bachman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbachman@...\">kbachman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I see from the board that many of you are upset that the undead spawns in <br/>\n&gt;Kithicor were<br/>\n&gt;stopped.  I&#39;d like to make the following points:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;1.  Kithicor is, at one and the same time, a newbie zone AND a zone that <br/>\n&gt;you MUST<br/>\n&gt;travel through in order to get from the four eastern cities to RV, and that <br/>\n&gt;you would<br/>\n&gt;much prefer to use to get from RV to High Keep.  Note that the alternate <br/>\n&gt;route to<br/>\n&gt;HK/Qeynos/Halas from RV takes you through Runnyeye and Beholder, hardly <br/>\n&gt;safe zones<br/>\n&gt;below level 20 or so, and takes a LOT longer to HK.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So what? The Karana&#39;s are just as dangerous. Hill Giants, Griffs, <br/>\nwerewolves, Evil Eyes, Wolves, Lions, Bandits, Gnoll Reavers.  West Commons <br/>\nhas Ghouls, dervs, orcs, Hill Giants, Griffins, Dragoons, Kodiaks, and other <br/>\nhigh level nasties. Travels should be dangerous.   BTW I made my first trip <br/>\nfrom Kelethin to Qeynos at 6th level when my server was only 4 days old.  <br/>\nTHAT was a dangerous trip. On mature servers the trip now is a joke, you can <br/>\ntravel clear across the Karana&#39;s and see nothing more dangerous then a <br/>\nwill-o-wisp.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;2.  The fact that these spawn only appeared at night is not a help.  In <br/>\n&gt;order to<br/>\n&gt;traverse the zone safely, this would require you to wait until dawn each <br/>\n&gt;time you<br/>\n&gt;wanted to get through the zone (unless you were sufficiently high level <br/>\n&gt;that it didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;matter, see point 3).  If you thought waiting for the boat was <br/>\n&gt;irritating...   This is<br/>\n&gt;NOT a good use of playing time.  Plus, although the spawn did not appear <br/>\n&gt;during the<br/>\n&gt;daytime, I am not convinced that they actually evaporated at dawn.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Know that it is a night time spawn makes it easy to avoid.  Makes travel a <br/>\nlittle less mindless.  Lord forbid if you have to wait 15 to 20 mins before <br/>\nrunning to your camping spot for the night.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;3.  I travelled through Kithicor the other night at the tail end of the <br/>\n&gt;event.  Even<br/>\n&gt;with sixty people actively hunting, I blundered into 3 spawn points between <br/>\n&gt;WC and RV,<br/>\n&gt;and 2 points between RV and HP.  Luckily, three of them had not yet <br/>\n&gt;&quot;dropped&quot; from the<br/>\n&gt;sky, and the other two I was able to put on the brakes for (barely), but I <br/>\n&gt;note the<br/>\n&gt;following:  1)  two of these points were so close to the zone wall that <br/>\n&gt;even the &quot;edge<br/>\n&gt;of zone&quot; travel method would not have worked, and 2) the one MOB that <br/>\n&gt;engaged me killed<br/>\n&gt;me (a level THIRTY ONE Bard) in three casts.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I would love to see a high level outdoor zone, myself, but it should not <br/>\n&gt;replace a<br/>\n&gt;newbie zone, and it should certainly not be placed in a zone critical for <br/>\n&gt;low- to<br/>\n&gt;mid-level travel.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Kenross Cantoforjado, 31 songs, Innoruuk<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>BTW I was on the test server last night and Kithicor is still spawning <br/>\nundead at night there.  My poor 5th lvl cleric got nuked by a Risen <br/>\nCommander and was bound in Qeynos :(  The Karanas are a long run without <br/>\nSelos, but at least a friendly Shamen helped me out with a SoW.  Managed to <br/>\nget back to my body by 6pm game time.  It was very excitiing wandering if I <br/>\nwould make it back before nightfall, since if I did not my body would decay.<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn Swiftsong - Karana server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
