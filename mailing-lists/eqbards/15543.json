With<br/>\napologies for the length and quality ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAn epic tale of boots<br/>\nby Melaniel<br/>\n(Currently entertaining a small but loyal audience in Freeport)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was a cold and wet Saturday evening as our heroine, Mel, stepped<br/>\noff the stage in Freeport.  The set had gone down well with the locals<br/>\nand soon she was quenching her thirst with the latest local brew.<br/>\nLater, as she donned her armour to leave the city she looked down at<br/>\nthe boots and vambraces ... bronze.  Sighing, she picked them up<br/>\ndisdainfully with her fingertips before adding them to her lambent<br/>\nensemble.  Closing her eyes she stood in front of the mirror and<br/>\nimagined herself all in blue, a striking figure streaming across the<br/>\nlandscape turning heads as she drummed by, hearing the sighs of<br/>\ndelight as she walked through the city gates, rather than the silent<br/>\nlaughter as they saw her sickly yellow pieces.  This was going to<br/>\nchange.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Tonight is the night,&quot; she shouted to no one in particular.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few miles away, some fire goblins awoke with a shiver.<br/>\n<br/>\nOut came Mel&#39;s diary ... hmmm, some firewalker boots and some fiery<br/>\nvambraces.  Fire goblins.  Solusek.  &quot;I know where that is!!&quot; she<br/>\nexclaimed.  &quot;North of the bad elves, near Cryssia and her crew!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWaving to her loyal groupies in Freeport, she left the guildhouse and<br/>\nwandered to the western gate to say farewell to the city for a while.<br/>\nA strange young man walked up to her.  &quot;Can I have a sow please?&quot; he<br/>\nasked.  Smirking, Mel closed her eyes and began to speak the words she<br/>\nhad heard the wolfy ones speak many times before.  Dramatically waving<br/>\nher arms she pointed at the feet of the stranger and commanded them to<br/>\nbe filled with a wolf spirit.  Breathing out slowly, she settled down<br/>\nand resumed her song.  The young man looked pleased, thanked her<br/>\nkindly and ran off.  A nearby halfling giggled as he watched the<br/>\nscene, patted Mel on the rear and ran off.  Pleased with herself, she<br/>\nheaded out to enter the dank depths of the Nektulos Forest.<br/>\n<br/>\nHer first piece of luck, the guards had abandoned their bridge posts.<br/>\nBeginning her beat, she felt the music deep inside her body and<br/>\nstepped up her pace speeding through the forest along the path,<br/>\npausing only when a feared Dragoon came into view guarding the<br/>\nNorthern valley into Lavastorm.  Taking a deep breath she stepped<br/>\nforward and sped past the guard leaving him dizzy at the blue and<br/>\nsickly yellow blur that knocked his helmet off on her way past.<br/>\n<br/>\nNearby, the fire goblins chanted and prayed to their gods for help.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, she arrived at the entrance to the caverns of Solusek.  Her<br/>\nfirst time.  Taking a brave step she wandered inside.<br/>\n<br/>\nA wave of heat greeted her, with echoes of weapons and shouts from<br/>\ndeep down in the cavern depths.  Mel struck up a light melody<br/>\ndistracting the guards at the entrance area while she surveyed her<br/>\nsurroundings.  It was warm.  Very warm.  Hot in fact.  The smell of<br/>\nthe lava filled the air.  Her backpack full of water for her long<br/>\nquest ahead, she looked around her and saw a lone ranger resting his<br/>\nwounds.  He was looking for adventure himself and they agreed to fight<br/>\ntogether.  A quick skirmish with the forward guards followed and they<br/>\nwere victorious together.  As they rested more brave souls entered and<br/>\nsoon a band of adventurers was formed.  An experienced ranger, from<br/>\nMel&#39;s home of Kelethin no less, knew the location of the boots and<br/>\nvambraces.  The group had to face the goblin King and his subjects!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nNot to be dismayed, Mel resolved to remain until she could lift the<br/>\nboots and vambraces from the goblins herself and be rid of the rotten<br/>\nbronze.  Together, they began to fight their way inside.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter only a couple of brief skirmishes, the group found a quiet base<br/>\nfrom which to conduct their raids into the King&#39;s throne area.  The<br/>\ngoblins would never find them, although an escape would be dangerous<br/>\nand likely difficult.  A high risk strategy, but by this time Mel<br/>\ncould taste the pieces of lambent armour and knew she could not turn<br/>\nback.<br/>\n<br/>\nSitting down, the group began to organise themselves, preparing for<br/>\nthe fight ahead.  They could hear the goblins nearby, the magic was<br/>\nheard, the grunting, the little scuffles they would all have.  And so<br/>\nthe fighting began.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe rangers began to make small raids, luring away the weak goblins<br/>\nfrom their posts, there were many of them, but together the<br/>\nadventurers fought bravely and successfully.  And then a goblin<br/>\nchampion appeared, news of the outsiders had begun to spread.  It<br/>\nroared a war cry, and hurtled into the group, fists flying.  A music<br/>\ncritic, it picked on Mel in spite of the others.  Trying to silence<br/>\nthe song, it fought with all its might, finally falling to the loudest<br/>\nshout Mel could muster.<br/>\n<br/>\nMel bent over the goblin&#39;s corpse and examined it.  &quot;YES!!!&quot; she<br/>\nshouted, and then shut up quickly as the rest of the group glared at<br/>\nher for making so much noise.  Happily, she picked up the goblin&#39;s<br/>\nvambraces.  These are just what I need for my new armour, the night<br/>\nwas starting to be a success already!<br/>\n<br/>\nPrepared again, the group stood ready to invade further towards the<br/>\nthrone, when a shout went up!  The rangers had been surprised by the<br/>\nKing and his guard.  Rapidly they returned to the group to face them<br/>\ntogether.  Mel stood awaiting the onrush.  In the distance she could<br/>\njust make out a few shapes running at them.  The bright haze of lava<br/>\nthat hung in the air made seeing difficult, but the sound was<br/>\nunmistakable.  The goblins came toward them, there must have been five<br/>\nor six all at once.  They began their vicious assault on the rangers<br/>\nwho held them back bravely.  And then the King came.  A fearsome sight<br/>\nindeed, but this was no time for fear.<br/>\n<br/>\nMel unloosed her lute, this was a time to distract as many as she<br/>\ncould.  A soothing lullaby filled the air, a couple of goblins began<br/>\nto snooze.  Switching to her prized flute, Mel played to her limit and<br/>\nfound a champion still chewing on her friends.  She charmed it to her<br/>\nwill and it fought by her side keeping the younger goblins busy while<br/>\nher group began to take down the King, hoping to weaken the morale of<br/>\nthe others with their beloved King dead.  It was a difficult fight,<br/>\nthe goblins began to hate the music, the lullaby had its effect, the<br/>\nchampion remained loyal to Mel and protected her to its ability,<br/>\ndispatching one, then two of the younger goblins.  As the enemy<br/>\nnumbers reduced Mel began to boost the morale of her group, their<br/>\nweapons hit more, they attacked faster, the chains on the King began<br/>\nto have their effect, and then it happened.  The killing blow took the<br/>\nKing down with a scream, the remaining goblins lost their nerve, the<br/>\ngroup turned to them and now the advantage had switched.  With<br/>\nfearsome speed the group tore through the enemy and soon stood<br/>\nvictorious atop the corpses.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe group stood in silence.  Stunned at their success, relieved at<br/>\ntheir survival, but triumphant in victory.  The King was dead.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs the word spread among the goblins, it seemed they began to throw<br/>\nthemselves at the brave adventurers in increasing numbers, fighting to<br/>\ntheir last.  Warriors, champions, wizards, priests, the whole<br/>\nensemble.  And then came the Solusek Mages.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne came to investigate and was quickly dispatched.  Mel recognised<br/>\nit.  This creature was where her new boots were to come from.  And so<br/>\nthe group began again to invade into the newly departed throne room.<br/>\nThe mages came to investigate their disappeared comrade.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother appeared, this time with warrior support.  As a pair they were<br/>\nvery dangerous, but Mel had learned from her fight with the King.  She<br/>\ncharmed the mage, made it bend to her will and it rapidly destroyed<br/>\nits recent warrior friend.  Depleted of its magic pool, Mel turned on<br/>\nthe mage and the group finished it quickly by hand.  Alas, it had been<br/>\nfighting barefoot.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then it began.  Wave after wave of mages hurled themselves at the<br/>\ngroup.  With growing frustration, Mel found them all fighting<br/>\nbarefoot.  As one fell to the floor Mel grabbed it, screaming at it.<br/>\n&quot;Where are the boots, give me the boots!  Are you coming out here<br/>\ndeliberately barefoot or what you stupid thing!!&quot;  It simply smiled<br/>\nand went limp.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe hours passed, the mages continued to come.  All were barefoot.<br/>\nThe group found the recently departed King&#39;s son had become the new<br/>\nKing.  Again, in a frantic battle the group were victorious as the new<br/>\nKing fell.  There were more mages, more champions.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then finally, many hours after the first entrance to the caverns,<br/>\nthe mages became impatient.  Instead of handing the boots to its<br/>\ncomrades before heading out to assault the invaders, a single careless<br/>\ngoblin mage attacked.  The group again fought bravely and finished it.<br/>\nAs Mel examined its corpse she saw some boots.  Unable to look at<br/>\nfirst, her hands trembling, her breathing short, she finally got the<br/>\ncourage to touch them.  To look at them closely she sensed immediately<br/>\nwhat they were.  And fainted.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe healers brought out their smelling salts and brought her back to<br/>\nconsciousness.  This time she picked up the boots without fainting.<br/>\nAnd hugged them to her chest, her prized possessions now!  The group<br/>\ncheered, genuinely happy to see their member gain the item she had<br/>\nbeen looking for.<br/>\n<br/>\nBuoyed by this success, the group again fought their way through to<br/>\nthe throne room, but the royal family line had not recovered and there<br/>\nwas to be no more Kings.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd finally as Mel put the finishing touches to her 30th composition,<br/>\nthe group withdrew from the caverns and departed.  Mel returned to<br/>\nFreeport, happy from her excitement, happy to have made some new<br/>\nfriends, and happy to have gained the treasures she had earned.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the next day&#39;s task was to look up a couple of cyclops who had<br/>\nsome runes.  Mel was sure they would be kind enough to just hand the<br/>\nrunes over.  Wouldn&#39;t they?<br/>\n<br/>\n====<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd now the translation :-)  After 7 hours in Solusek, having never<br/>\nbeen there before, I was delighted to finally get some of those damn<br/>\nboots!!  Honestly, there must have been 30 mages over that time until<br/>\nfinally a pair of boots appeared.  And then as luck would have it, the<br/>\nnext 2 mages that appeared each had a pair! *sigh*  Tons of vambraces<br/>\nkept appearing, I could have had enough to make many many pairs of<br/>\nLambent ones!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it&#39;s at times and fights like this that I really enjoy this game.<br/>\nWhen you&#39;re in a good group, it is difficult to leave, and the group I<br/>\nhad with me on Saturday was excellent.  Great support, everyone knew<br/>\ntheir role, and there were only 5 of us for most of the night after<br/>\nthe second ranger left!  Monk, ranger, bard (me, obviously!), cleric<br/>\nand cleric.  No zap-style finger wagglers ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe group worked well, and I learned how to use charm very effectively<br/>\nin that situation.  Pull a wizard and some warrior types, charm the<br/>\nwizard and use its mana ;-)  Worked every time!!<br/>\n<br/>\nStrangely, after trying out Another Game(tm) which has a lot going for<br/>\nit, I find myself bizarrely drawn back to EverQuest and moments like<br/>\nthis seem to make me think I made the right decision in spite of the<br/>\nmany many annoying things it has!  Oh well.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo complete the story, sunday morning I got the 2 runes off the<br/>\ncyclops in West Karana, still using charm to good effect ;-)  And now<br/>\nall I need are the lambent gloves, although I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll give up<br/>\nthe Elf Hide Gloves I&#39;m already wearing because they have some<br/>\nsentimental value!  But it&#39;s time to return to Mistmoore anyway and<br/>\ntry to complete the lambent set.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, just a little (long!) story that I wanted to put in print<br/>\nbecause I came away from Solusek feeling good that night, made the<br/>\nwhole of level 29 around the King room, learned a few things about how<br/>\neffective a bard can actually be, especially when a group appreciates<br/>\nand understands what you can do *and supports you doing it*, and<br/>\nperhaps most importantly met some good people who I hope to meet again<br/>\nand fight alongside.<br/>\n<br/>\nSafe travels to you all, and happy entertaining!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMelaniel, Wood Elf Bard (30)<br/>\nJilanna, Barbarian Shaman (9)<br/>\nHigh Elf Wizard (30 retired)<br/>\n... and a host of others<br/>\nMith Marr server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
