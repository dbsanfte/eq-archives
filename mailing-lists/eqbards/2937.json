My system is pretty high<br/>\n&gt; end (Celeron 450, 128MB RAM, Voodoo 3 card) and ever since I<br/>\n&gt; got the extra lights at L24, unless I turn particle density<br/>\n&gt; off (meaning I don&#39;t see spell effects like root at all), I go<br/>\n&gt; from twisting 3 songs easily to barely twisting 2.  I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; thinking of changing my video card because a friend with a<br/>\n&gt; Riva TNT said it wasn&#39;t that bad on her system (same CPU<br/>\n&gt; speed, RAM).  Of course she isn&#39;t a bard so she doesn&#39;t have<br/>\n&gt; to juggle songs.  Do any of you have an easy time twisting<br/>\n&gt; with lots of spells flying?  What video card do you use?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Unfortunately I believe anyone using a regular modem has this problem.<br/>\nI have even tried to boost and tweak my PC internet connection using tweaks<br/>\nI&#39;ve found on PlanetQuake and the like (try i-speed, its a modem booster<br/>\nprogram that&#39;s worked well for me).  I have a PII 400, 128 MB ram, Voodoo 3<br/>\n3000 AGP and a 7200 speed HD.  I still get the problems you&#39;re talking<br/>\nabout.  My problem being that in the community I live in, neither cable nor<br/>\nDSL are available, so I&#39;m stuck with my 56K connection.   I get massive<br/>\nproblems in areas like Crushbone for sure.  The only problem that I&#39;ve found<br/>\nwith turning off particle density is that some of the nimrods I end up<br/>\ngrouping with refuse to listen to me when I say &quot;you have to stay close, or<br/>\nI can&#39;t heal you!&quot; etc. In these instances, I have to watch for the song<br/>\neffects around players.  One of these days other people will<br/>\nrealize......whoops, tangent, sorry.  I know that the TNT2 Ultra would<br/>\nprobably solve your problem.  With 32MB of on board vid mem, you can&#39;t go<br/>\nwrong.  Watch out for that price tag though.  My suggestion, go for the<br/>\nHercules TNT2 Ultra, from what I&#39;ve read, it has the highest stats straight<br/>\nout of the box (not to mention, a great TV out for big screen EQuesting).<br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully this will help you John, as you have certainly helped us all in<br/>\nthe past with your tireless research efforts.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike Hobson or<br/>\nWeiland of Freeport (way out of character),<br/>\n13th lvl bard<br/>\nErollisi Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
