This is a strike, in the balance <br/>\nteams mind, against bards.  When they look at adding a new song that might <br/>\nbe a power up to the class or look at adjusting our skill cap on say dodge, <br/>\nsomeone like Abashi will say, &quot;Well bards have unbalanced tracking so we <br/>\nbetter not do that&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do not see it so much as a slam against Verant as indicative of their <br/>\nfeeling that the classes are &#39;finished&#39;, despite player feedback to the <br/>\ncontrary. It took them 9 months for them figure out that Shaman Alchemy was <br/>\nbroke (even though Shamans have been petitioning this forever) and about the <br/>\nsame time to fix our level 22 song (using fix in the broadest term here, ie <br/>\nit does something now).<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Wayne Sheppard&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mrwayne@...\">mrwayne@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: [eqbards] Re: Grrrrrrrr!<br/>\n&gt;Date: Tue, 21 Dec 1999 14:13:57 -0500<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;How is this evidence of &quot;bard hate&quot; at all?  Gordon said two things:<br/>\n&gt;1.  Druids won&#39;t be able to track better than Bards.<br/>\n&gt;2.

From what perspective are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; they getting these _endless_ visions of &quot;class balancing&quot; needs.  And <br/>\n&gt;ya,<br/>\n&gt;ya<br/>\n&gt; &gt; - I wonder if _any_ of them ever play a normal bard - I dare anyone of<br/>\n&gt;them<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to level a bard to 35.
