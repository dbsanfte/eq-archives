Everyone knows that Fine Steel does NOT cost that much.<br/>\n<br/>\nTHAT, my friends, is what happens when you&#39;ve played EQ until 3 in the<br/>\nmorning.

A well-balanced rapier, however, costs over<br/>\n&gt;200pp.  I use a rapier, and shall disagree with Talon, it is a respectable<br/>\n&gt;weapon!  This is a choice for those with finesse, and the rapier benefits<br/>\n&gt;greatly from song (a faster rapier is a deadly rapier), but comparing a FS<br/>\n&gt;Rapier to a Dragoon Dirk?  Well, a Dragoon Dirk is a bit better than a well<br/>\n&gt;balanced rapier.

NEVER buy one.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;It is inferior to the Dragoon Dirk, and is MUCH more expensive, too. I was<br/>\n&gt;&gt;given a FS Rapier in trade, which you can buy from the vendor for approx<br/>\n&gt;&gt;280pp. Well, I tried to sell it for 100pp, and EVERYONE laughed at me.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Looking at the stats... yes... a Dragoon Dirk IS better, and you can get<br/>\n&gt;one<br/>\n&gt;&gt;of those for 20-40pp. So, forget about it. Really. Honestly.
