When","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1333513123\">Couple things I&#39;ve learned about the invisibility song.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) The effect does not &quot;linger&quot; if your party members move out<br/>\nof range like other bard songs do.  When they move out of<br/>\nrange, they immediately blink into sight.  This seriously<br/>\ndecreases its usefulness for group movement and corpse<br/>\nrecovery.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) If one of your party members blinks into sight and is<br/>\nattacked, then moves back into the song&#39;s influence, the next<br/>\nsong tick the mobs will start attacking you even though you<br/>\nare still invisible.  Your song helped someone being attacked,<br/>\nso they will now attack you, invisibile or not.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) My friends were telling me that the song was canceling<br/>\ntheir invisibility to undead.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn short, the song is probably only useful in solo play, and<br/>\nif your group is not moving.  Disappointing to say the least.<br/>\nAnyone know if it&#39;s intended to be this way?  Perhaps we could<br/>\npetition to get (1) fixed.  The effect does &quot;linger&quot; with you<br/>\nfor two ticks if you stop singing.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
