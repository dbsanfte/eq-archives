For the<br/>\n&gt; most part I agree.  However, I&#39;d like to argue that the Bard shouldn&#39;t be<br/>\n&gt; classed as a Hybrid.  Sound crazy?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hybrids are Warrior/Pure Caster combos.  They get some melee skills in addition<br/>\n&gt; to the spells from a specific casting class.  IE Rangers get Warrior skills and<br/>\n&gt; Druid spells.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Our spells are unique in that they may mimic some existing spells, but they do<br/>\n&gt; not come from any particular casting class.  We are a casting class unto<br/>\n&gt; ourselves with completely different spells and casting structure.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; To be a Hybrid you must be part Melee class (Warrior, or in our case Rogue) and<br/>\n&gt; part caster.  We&#39;ve got the caster part down, but where is the Melee part?  We<br/>\n&gt; get Plate, but so do Clerics.  Everyone gets Dodge.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you skip dodge, what Melee skills do the Hybrids get?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ranger - (7) Kick, Taunt, Dual Wield, Double Attack, Parry, Disarm, Riposte<br/>\n&gt; Paladin- (6) Taunt, Bash, Parry, Double Attack, Riposte, Disarm<br/>\n&gt; SK - (6) Taunt, Bash, Parry, Double Attack, Reposte, Disarm<br/>\n&gt; Bard - (1) Dual Wield<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So, the other Hybrids really are part fighter and part caster.  In what way does<br/>\n&gt; ONE melee skill make us part fighter?  In addition, all other Hybrids get<br/>\n&gt; Archery except Bards.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I fail to see how we can be classed as Hybrids at all, and feel that the<br/>\n&gt; addition of a personal Bind song to be in line with the current Bind thinking.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If we&#39;re to have the disadvantages of a Melee Hybrid, shouldn&#39;t we get the<br/>\n&gt; skills to compensate? If not, shouldn&#39;t we get the pure caster perks?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So far, we have a stick with 2 short ends :)  Thanks for the time...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Golias, Sol Ro<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Hey Freelancers:  Find your next project through JobSwarm!  <br/>\n&gt;   You can even make money in your sleep by referring friends.<br/>\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm1\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm1</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
