Seems to me having mobs<br/>\n&gt; run away because you&#39;re red to them and aggroing other mobs<br/>\n&gt; would cause more trains.  I think you&#39;re thinking of the code<br/>\n&gt; that makes it so green mobs that normally aggro on you won&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; unless they actually see you (i.e. they can&#39;t be triggered by<br/>\n&gt; another aggro mob that runs past them).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Are you sure they con indifferent?  I&#39;ll double check it next time I&#39;m<br/>\nin<br/>\n&gt; &gt; unrest but I don&#39;t recall invis working at all there.  Maybe they snuck<br/>\nit<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in with the invis/see invis patch?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; They started conning indifferent when I hit around L23.  It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; since been raised to like L28 I think (a lot of bards were<br/>\n&gt; complaining about invis not working on stuff anymore).  This<br/>\n&gt; was a long long time ago, like last summer.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There *is* something screwy with they way they&#39;ve classified<br/>\n&gt; undead and normal mobs.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
