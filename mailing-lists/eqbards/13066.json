He was actually pretty chatty, singing me a ballad and then telling<br/>\nme the story behind it.  He spoke of an old flame of his (her name was<br/>\nMatala, I think -- notes are at home) and how she had dumped him for someone<br/>\nelse and was now up to some nefarious purposes.  I got through the story and<br/>\ntried to get him to say more, but some idiot and his pet chose that moment<br/>\nto whack the poor bard, so I can&#39;t be sure that I got everything from him.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the end of each section of text, Vhalen would ask if I wanted him to go<br/>\non, but there were no brackets on anything.  Typing in what you would expect<br/>\nto type in kept him going, however (e.g. &quot;I would like to hear more&quot;).<br/>\nUnfortunately, he never indicates any sort of action you should take, he<br/>\njust says that Matala (if I remember her name correctly) must be stopped.<br/>\nAnyone else spoken to him lately?  Is this an old quest that I am just now<br/>\ndiscovering?  I&#39;d appreciate any guidance.<br/>\n<br/>\nRanulf<br/>\nBard of 19 (almost 20) songs -- Tunare</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
