Today I was running through NK (when I<br/>\nwas 32nd level)when I saw 2 HG&#39;s, I had already typed &quot;/shout 2 HG&#39;s<br/>\nnear Stone...&quot; when I stopped. and I thought:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Hey, I&#39;m near the zone, I&#39;m faster than these guys, what can it hurt?&quot;<br/>\nso I switched to charm hotkey bank and fired it up. it failed and the HG<br/>\nactually caught me and whacked me down to 1/2 health (forgot how fast<br/>\nthey really are). then while fleeing, I hit charm again, and it stuck. I<br/>\nsic&#39;d the Hg on the other one and was able to complete the battle.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately my HG lost and I was too scared to switch targets. as I<br/>\nwas running to the zone though, I passed a griffon. and i thought &quot;hey!&quot;<br/>\nSo I charmed it and sent it after the injured HG. It killed the HG<br/>\nquickly and I looted it &quot;WOW&quot; 3 plat and 54 gold! and then as I was<br/>\nrunning to the zone I passed a griffenne, so I sent my griffon to kill<br/>\nit! and then i zoned :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI never saw 2 HG&#39;s again, but later I saw a red griffon and a yellow HG.<br/>\nI charmed the griffon and sent it against the HG. This time I did switch<br/>\ntargets and it was obvious my griffon was losing badly. so I switched<br/>\nand charmed the HG, who won with 50% of his health left. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust a bit later (after a stint in HHK where I made 33rd level) I was<br/>\npassing thru the oasis and I saw a yellow and red Sand Giant standing<br/>\nnext to each other. again I thought &quot;hey!&quot; so I charmed the red SG. it<br/>\nfailed about 3 times, but then it took and I had about 75% success rate<br/>\nfrom then on out. I actually Killed a Sand Giant! and for loot I got<br/>\n44plat and a FS sword!<br/>\n<br/>\nI was amazed! we actually ARE that powerful!<br/>\n<br/>\nUldar Ulfangson<br/>\n33rd Bard, Rodcet Nife</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
