It was <br/>\nmy first time down there. As I finished zoning, it said &#39;You have entered <br/>\nold ruins of guk. (is that lower guk?)<br/>\n   I zoned in as a higher level dude was slaying a shin ghoul knight; the <br/>\nvery mob (one of) from which I need to loot a lambent quest item. I had my <br/>\ninvis song going as per usual. All through upper I noticed that everything <br/>\nwas indifferent to me. YAY! Ok, song is working like a charm. I did manage <br/>\nto con the shin ghoul knight while he was being attacked. &quot;A Shin Ghoul <br/>\nKnight scowls at you, ready to attack. What would you like your tombstone to <br/>\nsay?&quot; Um ok, first reaction is to zone, especially since he was just inches <br/>\naway  from me. The guy was using the zone line as a buffer, apparently. NP. <br/>\nZoned... Went LD... That&#39;s where I am as it stands.<br/>\n   So, at 19 so far, from what I think is lower (?), can see through invis. <br/>\nNow, whether or not your invis ability increases as you level or not, is <br/>\nsomething i know zero about.<br/>\n   All I know is I was happy to get invis so I can get down to lower guk to <br/>\nget these items (shin greaves and gauntlets) before i had a chance to either <br/>\ngo hunt there for exp, or get some faction hits somewhere else.<br/>\n<br/>\nPava, Bard of the 19th measure<br/>\nSilent Dragons<br/>\nCazic Thule<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Hmmm, I will have to give this a try in Lower Guk.
