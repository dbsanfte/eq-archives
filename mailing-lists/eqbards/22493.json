Or<br/>\nsomething like that = :).  Personally, I enjoy seeing your continued<br/>\ncomments on messages that come across this list.  Whether you still play or<br/>\nnot, you do have good knowledge to impart to us.  This list is still the<br/>\nmost active of all the eGroups list I subscribe to.  You and all the folks<br/>\nthat subscribe here make it that way and are great.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a different note, I was at The Concert Hall today and saw a note to check<br/>\nthe Safehouse for some info.  I did and their Library(guide) section is<br/>\nexcellent.

I&#39;m working on it now, though - so by the <br/>\nend of the day, they should be accurate.
