Its difficult to find a good group<br/>\nduring this time because this is also the weed out period - worse that hell<br/>\nlevels, the 20&#39;s test your commitiment to that class in my opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt anyrate, your position is clear (push past these levels as quickly as<br/>\npossible) and while boring, doing the noterious deepwater goblin pets of<br/>\nLake Rathetear will get you though it, and will get you out of your rut.  I<br/>\njust checked today as I sold at the ogre camp, 2 pets still run by every 2<br/>\nmins.  As someone here stated before [referring to hell levels], &#39;Quantity<br/>\nover quailty.&quot;  Just set up camp right near the ogres on the hill if you&#39;re<br/>\nsolo, or right at the tree in the gut if you&#39;re in a group and go to work.<br/>\nYou have a convient zone line if something goes wrong and a food and water<br/>\nvendor literally next door.  You can kill the bandits on the other side of<br/>\nthe gut handily for lunch money.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrust me, stay on it, you&#39;ll get through it in about a week with modest play<br/>\ntime doing the pets and then suddenly your 20&#39;s songs, powered by your new<br/>\nhigher levels, will be more effective and desired in a group (for the<br/>\nrecord, besides selo&#39;s, the song I ALWAYS have mem&#39;d: chain, even if I<br/>\ngrouped with 3 rangers and 2 druids you couldn&#39;t pay me to forget the song.<br/>\nJust like insurance, ya hope you never have to use it but you don&#39;t leave<br/>\nhome without it.).  I suppose there is an argument to go through these<br/>\nlevels the traditional way, but I did that the first time around -- it was<br/>\npainful and in the end the only valuable lesson/tactic/govering principle I<br/>\ndrew from the experience was &quot;Ain&#39;t doing that again!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHave fun and good luck,<br/>\n-GW<br/>\n&lt;Tork@Nameless&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
