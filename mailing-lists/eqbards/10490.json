I noticed that under different circumstances, the delay<br/>\n&gt; (or the &quot;recovery period&quot;) doesn&#39;t seems to be the same.<br/>\n&gt; I noticed it when I was using my friend&#39;s computer 450MHz in the first full<br/>\n&gt; screen mode (press F10 once from the default screen) and right after I<br/>\n&gt; stopped the first song (say CoD) I can NEARLY immediate start second one.<br/>\n&gt; That day, I was twisting FOUR songs very happily. When I got back home, I<br/>\n&gt; tried to do it again (with 300MHz computer), i have to particularly wait<br/>\n&gt; (about one second) for the icon to show up again before i can weave in a<br/>\n&gt; second song. Twisting three was as much as I could do at that time.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>When you stop a song, you have to wait for the button to<br/>\n&quot;ungrey.&quot;  The speed of that animation depends entire on the<br/>\nframes per second you&#39;re getting.  If you&#39;re on a slow system<br/>\nor lagged due to spell animations, it&#39;s going to take longer.  <br/>\nOn my original K6-200 system, it was impossible to play more<br/>\nthan 2 songs at a time because the buttons took over a half<br/>\nsecond to ungrey.  Right now on my 550 MHz system, I play in<br/>\nD3D mode, even though glide mode produces cleaner output with<br/>\nless jerkiness.  The D3D mode has a higher fps, and the slight<br/>\ndifference is very noticeable when I start pounding at the<br/>\nsong buttons.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is probably my biggest gripe about the interface.  It<br/>\nmakes sense when applied to spellcasting (the spells usually<br/>\nremained greyed for several seconds after casting, so an<br/>\nextra quarter second doesn&#39;t really matter), but is really<br/>\nstupid when applied to our songs.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
