I don&#39;t think I have ever fought any mob that was buffed with<br/>\nSOW/SOC.  How many types of mobs are we talking about here?  I&#39;m guessing<br/>\nthat the only mobs who can cast SOW/SOC are shamans.  How much of an impact<br/>\nis this?  If camping these shaman-type mobs that can cast SOW/SOC are like<br/>\nmost of the places I&#39;ve been, as soon as they spawn the campers are all over<br/>\nthem.  Do they even have time to cast the SOW buff before they are attacked?<br/>\nAs I said earlier I&#39;ve never fought a mob that was buffed with SOW, but I<br/>\nsee this as a problem only if they have time to cast their buffs before they<br/>\nare attacked.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGuess I&#39;ll find out on my own soon when I make 23d level.    <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tTuesday, August 31, 1999 3:30 PM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject:\tRe: [eqbards] More secret nerfing<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Tue, 31 Aug 1999, M Sanford wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; You can now no longer use Selo&#39;s Consonant Chains on rooted, ensnared or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; SoW&#39;d mobs.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The rooted or ensnared part I dont mind, but not being able to chain<br/>\n&gt; &gt; SoW&#39;d or SoC&#39;d mobs is very aggravating. When they flee, they cannot be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; stopped. Especially in dungeons where the NPCs can cast SoW indoors,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; although PCs cannot. The mob will flee from you and bring back a nice<br/>\n&gt; &gt; train.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This is very distressing.  I&#39;ve written at length about the<br/>\n&gt; problems and ill-feelings that develop when you make monsters<br/>\n&gt; work by different rules than players.  Instead of reducing<br/>\n&gt; these differences, Verant seems to be increasing them.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Unless of course this means that players with SoW or<br/>\n&gt; Accelerando cannot be rooted by mobs?  That still seems<br/>\n&gt; terribly unfair to the classes who cannot SoW or Accelerando<br/>\n&gt; themselves.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
