But, you cannot charm a pet.  Can&#39;t even do that with NPC <br/>\npets unless the owner dies.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAbout interrupts, remember &quot;most&quot; spells have a refresh period, so <br/>\nyou just have to time casting just right.  In other words, even <br/>\nthough a 2.5 second cast time spell is a faster cast time then our <br/>\nsongs, there is still sometimes a refresh lag period that could quite <br/>\npossibly equal or be longer than our 3 sec cast time.  (We have <br/>\nalmost no refresh on the songs.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope I made sense :P<br/>\n<br/>\n~Beatdrop Battledrum<br/>\n47th Bard of the Karana Server<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>, John Tatsukawa &lt;john@t...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; My guild is having a war with a few guilds that we are aligned <br/>\nwith.
