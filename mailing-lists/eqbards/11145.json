BUT, the reason it<br/>\ndropped on Fear was that a GM went to Fear and manually loaded it on a mob<br/>\n(and, yes Shada, i believe it was Cazic himself)<br/>\n<br/>\nWould be nice if it were available apart from GM loads, because it is just<br/>\nnasty...but I do not believe that it is available except for GM loads.<br/>\n<br/>\nKaleid the Mothballed (hopefully not permanently)<br/>\n23rd Song<br/>\nGlyphed (Hmm...wonder what my last name will be :-P)<br/>\n14th DE Magician<br/>\n&lt;Wave of the Dark Tide&gt;<br/>\nPrexus<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\n&quot;Thou shall not kill.
