I<br/>\nhad become a casual player, or even less, so that is one reason I decided to<br/>\ngo.  Casual players can get loot, but it is only going to be after everyone<br/>\nelse has what they want, and if you are lucky enough that the mob you want<br/>\nsomething off is still being killed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think I would have been kicked out or anything, but I also wasn&#39;t<br/>\ncontributing anymore.  Most of the guild plays every night or at least 6<br/>\nnights a week from 5:30pm on.  Recently it was asked (or ordered, however<br/>\nyou want to see it hehe) that every member attend at least 1 raid per week,<br/>\nwhich isn&#39;t much to ask at all but I wasn&#39;t even doing that much when I<br/>\nquit.<br/>\n<br/>\nShada<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I had seen one of your previous posts a long time ago on this <br/>\n&gt; subject, but <br/>\n&gt; couldn&#39;t find it.

I&#39;m guessing that <br/>\n&gt; there aren&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; any casual gamers in Afterlife, or if they are, they don&#39;t go <br/>\n&gt; on raids or <br/>\n&gt; if they do, they just know they will not get any loot.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It definitely slants rewards to the full time player: Keep up <br/>\n&gt; or drop out. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
