I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-151391614\">When all the details about the bard armor quests came out, I was initially<br/>\ndisappointed that I would not be able to do the quests due to my level (25<br/>\nbard).  I just assumed that I would have to wait until I was around 30th<br/>\nlevel before starting.  I guess I have been lucky so far because I have been<br/>\nable to acquire six of the items.  For a few of them, guildmembers in their<br/>\nmid 30s helped me out.  For the others, people couldn&#39;t use/loot them them<br/>\nso they let me loot the items.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlways willing to take a risk, I&#39;m thinking about heading to Mistmoore after<br/>\nI get the bracelet in Unrest.  Need to get an idea of how tough the deadly<br/>\nusher and gypsy musicians are.  I hope to join with a higher level group<br/>\n(assuming they will accept a 25 bard in the group).  Assuming a full group<br/>\nof six, what level characters are required to fight against these mobs?  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, the only places I&#39;ve gone to in Mistmoore are the initial areas beside<br/>\nthe lake and the graveyard.  Nothing I ran into in those locations could see<br/>\nthrough the invisibility song.   Are there any mobs deeper in the zone that<br/>\ncan See Invis?  I would assume that the DE casters can buff themselves with<br/>\nthe spell.  Got a bad feeling that all the gargoyles can as well.  Still<br/>\nwilling to take the chance though.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
