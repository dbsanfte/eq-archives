Note that &#39;Anonymous&#39; will<br/>\n&gt;lower the numbers shown for some classes, but typically should be fairly<br/>\n&gt;equal for all classes except those with high &quot;request&quot; factors like druids,<br/>\n&gt;shamans, enchanters, and clerics.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>you should probably try at peak times with the flag &#39;&#39;count&#39;&#39;, i.e. /who all<br/>\ncleric count.<br/>\nthat will give you just the number instead of listing the names of each<br/>\nperson.<br/>\nanon will tend to lower the numbers for certain classes like<br/>\ndruids/clerics/enchanters<br/>\nwho are already well represented it seems like.<br/>\n<br/>\nalso, there is a difference between &#39;&#39;perceived&#39;&#39; power and &#39;&#39;actual&#39;&#39;<br/>\npower.  there is a lot<br/>\nof player ignorance on what a bard can actually do.  that doesn&#39;t<br/>\nnecessarily mean the<br/>\nactual power needs to be pumped, just the perception.  at level 55 i still<br/>\nrun across people<br/>\nwho say &#39;&#39;oh i didn&#39;t know a bard could do that&#39;&#39;.
