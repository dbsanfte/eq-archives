You<br/>\naren&#39;t paying to &quot;own&quot; them in any way the law currently accepts, you are<br/>\nrenting their use while using Verants service. In the work scenario, if you<br/>\nwere fired as Copier Guy you couldn&#39;t take the copier, the company was<br/>\npaying for that copier to be there, and no matter how much money you made<br/>\nfor them as Copier Guy, you can&#39;t take it with you.<br/>\nI think that is actually a really strong case against EBay sales imparting a<br/>\nReal World value to EQ items. What you are actually buying is the ability<br/>\naccess the itemID in EQs database during the time you are paying for<br/>\nVerant&#39;s service. For instance if you quit the game Verant is under no<br/>\nobligation to pay you fair market value for your items, in large part<br/>\nbecause they are not items, they are graphics with an ID, which Verant owns<br/>\nand which they allowed you to use for 10 bucks a month. If you paid for<br/>\ngreater access that is between you and the seller, but the only identifiable<br/>\n&quot;thing of value&quot; is the service Verant provides.<br/>\nThe final nail in the coffin is that whether or not having access to a full<br/>\nset of Lambent improves or lessens the quality of the service Verant<br/>\nprovides is totally subjective (though, um, duh :o) you may *think* it makes<br/>\nthe service better but as the case can be made that full access to all items<br/>\nactually has LESS value, you would have a hard time proving it, um, to a<br/>\nnon-bard.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt anyrate, just thinking out loud, er, when I should be working,<br/>\n<br/>\nTszaaz</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
