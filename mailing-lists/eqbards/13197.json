Not a<br/>\nwoefully overpowering request considering how poor our offensive and<br/>\ndefensive cap out.  That would more differentiate us from the plain vanilla<br/>\nmelee skills we get (duel/dodge), and besides, even if we got it, ya know<br/>\nthey would cap it low. ;)  Parry is too common place!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for binding issues - most of your agony goes away when you get a 29th+<br/>\ncleric in the group, which incidentally happens about the time running back<br/>\nbecomes... inconvenient at best - this coming from someone who has more than<br/>\nonce awoke from his cazic dirt nap in Halas or Kelethin. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n-GW<br/>\n&lt;Tork@Nameless&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nPS: I read on here someone petitioned about hell levels, asking if it was a<br/>\nbug, etc.  I found it enormously funny that I had done the same.  I was<br/>\nquite shocked to get a non-visible admin tell me &quot;I&#39;m really sorry, but its<br/>\na shortsighted attempt by Verant to slow leveling.  Its not a bug, its just<br/>\npoor design.&quot;  And for once, I agreed with a GM.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
