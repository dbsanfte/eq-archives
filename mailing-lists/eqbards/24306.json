Actually, you don&#39;t even have to click to pause <br/>\nit, <br/>\n&gt; &gt; you can just click done and come back.  But, once you log, you <br/>\nhave <br/>\n&gt; &gt; to start a new game.  But why would multiplayer be pointless?  In <br/>\nmy <br/>\n&gt; &gt; mind, they would just make it so you have to start a new game <br/>\nwith <br/>\n&gt; &gt; another player so that both are starting fresh.  I think that it <br/>\n&gt; &gt; would be fun :)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m glad that they added Gems.  I know a while back, many players <br/>\n&gt; &gt; were requesting casinos in towns so that they can gamble and play <br/>\n&gt; &gt; games.  They said that it would be too buggy and exploitable <br/>\n&gt; &gt; possibly, but I think that Gems (and other possible future games) <br/>\nis <br/>\n&gt; &gt; a good compromise.  The best things I can see about it are...  <br/>\nCamps <br/>\n&gt; &gt; will become much less boring, when you still have to stare at the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; spell books with pre-35 casters, waiting for group <br/>\n&gt; &gt; assignments/buffing on raids, etc.  Although, like you said.  <br/>\nPeople <br/>\n&gt; &gt; can die if they aren&#39;t paying attention and just playing Gems.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; ~Beatdrop<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; --- In eqbards@y..., &quot;Gordon Hughes&quot; &lt;ghughes@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; You can resume paused games at a later stage.

Do you mean that there is a <br/>\nway <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;to make<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it so the game doesn&#39;t reset when you log?
