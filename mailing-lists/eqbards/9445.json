I have recently gained Level 12 and have<br/>\n&gt; been experimeting with bellow.  I had a few questions such as: is it a DD<br/>\n&gt; or<br/>\n&gt; AE song and if I bellow one creature can it effect others such that they<br/>\n&gt; will follow along and attack me.  I wanted to know a little about the<br/>\n&gt; possible strategies that people use with this song.  Thanks for all your<br/>\n&gt; help.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Rylos of E&#39; ci<br/>\n&gt; Lvl 12 bard<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>\tBellow is a DD damage song, I&#39;m not sure, but I think it does 8dmg<br/>\nnow?  Basically you can use it like an extra attack (think of it as an extra<br/>\nsword).  Another benefit is that it will sometimes interrupt a caster.  If<br/>\nattacking a mob (with any means) would cause others to come after you, then<br/>\nso will Bellow.  In other words, if there&#39;s a single scarab you want to<br/>\nattack, go ahead, but if there are 3 dervishes, bellow would bring all 3,<br/>\njust like using ranged weapons would do.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBien - Karana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
