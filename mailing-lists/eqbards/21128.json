The only time I could see this being even <br/>\nremotely exciting is if a GM showed up and re-popped the entire zone <br/>\nat once, which they would only do if some mobs were bugged. &lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe because they haven&#39;t been there before and don&#39;t know what to <br/>\nexpect?  Some people are *gasp* just approaching the level limit of <br/>\nthe planes for the first time in their first character.  They never <br/>\nhad the opporunity to find the planes uncamped, unfarmed, with a <br/>\npopulation less than 40... And, you know what?  They likely never <br/>\nwill.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;If you want an exciting experience, try not farming Fear for <br/>\nonce, and instead breaking it open on a full pop. You might actually <br/>\nhave a challenge  *gasp* and fun. Instead of seeing maybe 2-3 dozen <br/>\nmobs in 5.5 hours, you will more than likely see 2-3 dozen mobs in <br/>\nyour first couple hours, depending on how efficient your raiding <br/>\nparty is. Not only will you kill a lot more in less time, but you <br/>\nwill see more loot drop in a shorter amount of time. Last time I was <br/>\non a Fear raid, we saw no less than 8 drops in the first hour. It <br/>\nreminded me of the candyland that was the original Fear plane <br/>\nopening. &lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe because as you say below, it&#39;s camped 24/7 and there&#39;s no way <br/>\nto get a zone full of mobs to experience the &quot;fun&quot; of breaking fear.  <br/>\nIf you want to go, you join the &quot;farmers&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; People farming Fear and then wondering where the fun went baffle me.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Better-than-thou attitudes and people who flame others for asking a <br/>\nquestion baffle me.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; This reminds me of a running joke some friends have about farming <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Fear (if this offends any of you, oh well):<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Lleluvyn says, &#39;Hail there hardy adventurer, would you be <br/>\n </span></blockquote>interested in [Farming The Plane of Fear]?&#39;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Kruegen says, &#39;How do I farm the plane of fear?<br/>\n&gt; Lleluvyn says, &#39;It is an easy task, done by many!

The reward is free [phat <br/>\n </span></blockquote>lewtz] with no risk other then [/random 100].<br/>\n<br/>\nIt neither offends me nor even comes close to making me laugh.  It&#39;s <br/>\njust not funny.<br/>\n<br/>\n/Rant on<br/>\n<br/>\nAt such a critical point in EQ for Bards (the response to Chains and <br/>\ntesting of Lullaby), you&#39;d think this list would have a flurry of <br/>\nactivity and discussion going on.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIMHO, it&#39;s responses like this one that&#39;s taken this list from over <br/>\n1500 posts a month to 329 so far this month.  This used to be a list <br/>\nfree of flames and free (for the most part) of people stroking their <br/>\negos.  These days, you can barely go 2 threads without one or the <br/>\nother popping up.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe result?  People find other places to communicate flame free.  I <br/>\nwon&#39;t advertise those places since I&#39;d risk spoiling them.<br/>\n<br/>\n/rant off<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkfox Reven&#39;tsol<br/>\n52 Minstrel, Xegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
