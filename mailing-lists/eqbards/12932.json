Example: at 30th level, you could consistently pixie strike<br/>\n&gt; lizard judicators and they stopped attacking.  New patch goes in, your still<br/>\n&gt; 30th level and fighting lizard judicators.  After the patch, you notice that<br/>\n&gt; pixie isn&#39;t working like it used to.    <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Lullaby always had some mobs immediately attacking you after<br/>\nthey&#39;d nodded.  The effectiveness of the song has been<br/>\ndecreased though, whether via increased resist rate or<br/>\ntweaking of the level modifiers I don&#39;t know.  I do know that<br/>\nwhen I was about L25, I was able to stop a huge train of about<br/>\n15 gnolls in Blackburrow cold.  I&#39;d only get attacked 0-3<br/>\ntimes after every pulse.  I tried it again at L40 with about<br/>\n10 gnolls, and I was getting attacked 1-5 times after every<br/>\npulse.  There was a time when I used this song to stop a train<br/>\nof 15 ice goblins while my party hacked them to pieces one by<br/>\none.  I&#39;ll try that again at some point, but based on my<br/>\nexperience in Blackburrow, I doubt the results will be the<br/>\nsame even at my current level.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 2) Is it possible that when you started noticing that lullaby and pixie<br/>\n&gt; strike didn&#39;t work as well as they used to, the reason for it may be that<br/>\n&gt; you were gaining levels and began fighting more often the higher level mobs<br/>\n&gt; that get the second resist?  Example: your 30th level and fighting the<br/>\n&gt; glyphed mobs in the Mistmoore graveyard.  Pixie strike seems to work as<br/>\n&gt; expected.   At 35th level, you move into the courtyard in Mistmoore and<br/>\n&gt; start fighting all the ancille mobs.  You notice that mobs are still<br/>\n&gt; attacking even though they didn&#39;t resist the song.  You think pixie strike<br/>\n&gt; has been secretly nerfed but in fact nothing has changed with the song<br/>\n&gt; except the ancille mobs get a second resist check while the glyphed mobs<br/>\n&gt; only get one.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, the one person who tried it at L28 said he always<br/>\nstunned himself (vs. me only succeeding maybe 20% of the<br/>\ntime).  So I certainly consider this a valid theory.  <br/>\nUnfortunately, I don&#39;t really want to kill myself a hundred<br/>\ntimes to drop myself back to level 28 to test it.  :-)  So if<br/>\nsome of you lower level bards could speak up on how well you<br/>\nthink the song works, it&#39;d be mighty helpful.  My recollection<br/>\nis that when I first got the song, except for the rare<br/>\ninsta-resist (about in-line with the mob breaking out of the<br/>\neffect early), if I got the &quot;eyes glaze over&quot; message, the<br/>\nsong worked.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have more to say on this, but I&#39;ll save it for another reply<br/>\nwhere it&#39;s more appropriate.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
