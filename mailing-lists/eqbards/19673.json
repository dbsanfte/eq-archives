Go to one of the <br/>\nfollowing for more info:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hackersquest.gomp.ch/ubb/Forum1/HTML/000445.html\">http://www.hackersquest.gomp.ch/ubb/Forum1/HTML/000445.html</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/GroupExp/\">http://www.geocities.com/GroupExp/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nA Troll SK will have more total EXP at the same level as a Halfling <br/>\nWarrior, thus will receive a bigger slice of the pie.  Since he needs <br/>\nmore exp to level, their exp bars will actually move at the same <br/>\nrate, while grouped.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are 2 reasons why I believe this is a load of hoey, and first <br/>\nof all, let me state that both Dark Elves and Half Elves have the <br/>\nexact same class modifier so Bards wouldn&#39;t notice anything even IF <br/>\nthis were true.<br/>\n<br/>\n1.  If the illusion did anything, it would change how much exp is <br/>\nneeded to level, because THAT is where the exp penalty is applied <br/>\n(kind of what I read Rokkenn as saying).  So, say a Troll SK at Level <br/>\n41 used an Illusion: Halfling Warrior (I know it doesn&#39;t exist, but I <br/>\nactually know that a 41 Troll SK has the same total EXP as a 50 <br/>\nHalfling Warrior).  The exp level tables would change, the troll SK <br/>\nwould keep the same total exp and he&#39;d ding into 50.  Obviously, this <br/>\nisn&#39;t happening.  His exp bar would move faster while the illusion <br/>\nwas on, but as soon as it wore off, the tables would reset and he&#39;d <br/>\nlose 9 levels again.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  IF a Troll SK could bypass the EXP penalty by using the DE <br/>\nIllusion you all know for a fact that Verant wouldn&#39;t have introduced <br/>\na new Guise, they would have changed the old guise to work the way <br/>\nthe new one does.  This would create such an imbalance, it would fit <br/>\nnicely into the category of &quot;Nerf as soon as possible&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkfox Reven&#39;tsol<br/>\nXegony<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; This is a load of hoey.
