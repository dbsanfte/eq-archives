It&#39;s a<br/>\nvalid arguement for changing the way that group experience is shared.  It<br/>\nshould be based on level, not on total xp gained.  The reason it was set up<br/>\nthe way it is was that Verant felt, and I tend to agree with them, that<br/>\nfriends would be grouping alot and would want to level at the same rate so<br/>\nthey divided xp the way they did so that friends would level at around the<br/>\nsame rate.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis worked, but the problem is that most people do not, in fact, group with<br/>\ntheir &#39;friends&#39; regularly and thus groups of strangers are penalized for the<br/>\nhybrid&#39;s experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately experience sharing is embedded deeply into the client and I&#39;m<br/>\nnot sure if Verant is willing to totally re-write the game engine to fix<br/>\nsomething that was put in intentionally.  I&#39;m not sure I would expect them<br/>\nto.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The hybrid penalty is a HUGE problem.
