My four song combo of choice was DDD, CoD, Hymn and then a Bellow.  I found it was adequate, but that I would go back to the three song combo when things got hairy.  I sadly underutilized Hymn (and then Chains) for a long time, until I figured out how potent they could be.  (It probably all dates back to that bard who ridiculed me for using the all-song combo when I was 22 and she was 28 because she &quot;didn&#39;t like it&quot;...her combo of choice was hymn, chains and anthem with weapons.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBtw, your posts are making me seriously consider making another bard on my server (or another one, I don&#39;t care) and working him up to crags again :)<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a side note, my beloved ogre warrior is now 19 and desperately seeking his surname.  He wouldn&#39;t last very long in EK soloing crags between 22 and 26 =) (or at least I don&#39;t think he would)<br/>\n<br/>\nSinistral of Karana<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
