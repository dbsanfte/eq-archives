It used to be on a regular timed spawn<br/>\nand he had the times through good fortune, but they&#39;ll have been reset<br/>\nsince.  I do remember it was a long spawn time however :-(<br/>\n<br/>\nI think Zahal is the first one, I just remember that killing the first<br/>\nmade the second NPC spawn for the cleric armour, and the second one<br/>\nspawns right at the north end, wanders a bit and then gets killed by<br/>\nthe werewolf hunters!!
