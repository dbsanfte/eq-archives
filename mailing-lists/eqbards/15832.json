I can tell you you are welcome in my<br/>\nhouse if you behave and speak according to my rules. If you break those<br/>\nrules I can eject you. As long as those rules don&#39;t break overriding laws<br/>\n(like discrimination based on race or sex) that doesn&#39;t *begin* to touch the<br/>\narea of constitutional rights because it was MY house and you choose to come<br/>\nin, and frankly I can ask you to leave for no reason in partiucular. Heh, as<br/>\nmy house is in Texas, if&#39;n ya don&#39;t I kin shoot ya!
