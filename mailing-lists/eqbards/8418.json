Playing a bard effectively,<br/>\nespecially solo, requires a lot of timing, patience, and strategy, and a<br/>\nlittle luck.  Playing just one song is recipe for disaster (especially<br/>\nsolo).  It&#39;s taken me a long time to get the hang of switching weapons,<br/>\ninstruments, songs, hotkey banks, keeping an eye on my health, MOBs health,<br/>\nknowing when to run, knowing when to stay, etc, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of the other classes have a pretty straight forward approach to combat<br/>\n- not so with the bard.  For starters, you&#39;ll have to twist 3 to 4 songs in<br/>\nany given combat (usually).  If the weapons just aren&#39;t cutting it, you<br/>\nmight want to try juggling different songs with the appropriate instruments<br/>\nwhile attacking hand-to-hand.  This is just the tip of the iceberg.  I<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t even begin to tell you exactly what to do, w/o knowing his weapons<br/>\nand what songs he has memorized and what MOBs you&#39;re fighting.  Even if I<br/>\ncould, it would take you awhile to get used to switching/juggling so many<br/>\nthings at once.  We [bards] have, literally, thousands of different ways to<br/>\napproach combat.  Some will get you killed, some work okay - while others<br/>\nwill guarantee victory.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would play with his bard on really low green stuff and get the hang of<br/>\ntwisting different songs, etc.  Then slowly work up to harder stuff...<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps, but I&#39;m not sure in what capacity.<br/>\n<br/>\nDesmei Sightblinder<br/>\nLvl 30 Bard (Povar)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:badbrother1@...\">badbrother1@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:badbrother1@...\">badbrother1@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Sunday, October 10, 1999 12:55 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqbards] Please Help<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:badbrother1@...\">badbrother1@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have a big problem and I am hoping that somebody can help me.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My brother is away on vacation and i play his character (a <br/>\n&gt; bard) and died and<br/>\n&gt; lose a level. I play other characters (ranger,druid,warrior) <br/>\n&gt; into the 20s, but I<br/>\n&gt; never play anything like this one now. He is in the low 40s <br/>\n&gt; and even if i fight<br/>\n&gt; things that are green (tried a cyclops) i have to run so far. <br/>\n&gt; I really need<br/>\n&gt; somebody to please tell me how to fight with a bard like this <br/>\n&gt; and what to fight<br/>\n&gt; so i can get him back his level before he comes home and <br/>\n&gt; kicks my butt!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The guy has all the songs i think and i just dont know how to <br/>\n&gt; fight right. When<br/>\n&gt; I just fight with 2 swords i get killed even with the beserk <br/>\n&gt; song playing.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please help!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor <br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Hey Freelancers:  Find your next project through JobSwarm!  <br/>\n&gt;   You can even make $$$ in your sleep by referring friends.<br/>\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm1\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm1</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a> with the subject lol.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
