Whilst the goblin sage, and the<br/>\n  goblin patriarch may be able to see invis.  So do some mendicants,<br/>\n  most prelates, and all priests.  A few evokers have also jumped me<br/>\n  while invis.  It all depends on your level versus the mob level<br/>\n  when it comes down to it.  Sometimes L19 priests see me and attack<br/>\n  me, sometimes they dont.  Those goblins will agro on almost anything<br/>\n  including L50 players.<br/>\n  <br/>\n  You&#39;ve got to pass a lot of goblins to get to the throne room.<br/>\n  When the dungeon has a good few people in it, and it&#39;s nice and<br/>\n  clear, you could probably sail through without incident.  I would<br/>\n  assume all goblins can see you until you con each one otherwise.<br/>\n  Because once you walk by one scowling goblin, they all jump in.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Permafrost green casters can kill.  I will not, to this day,<br/>\n  walk around freely in there since you never know what may<br/>\n  happen.  One priest and two evokers for a melee class is <br/>\n  instant death.  I&#39;m not trying to scare people from going in<br/>\n  there, it&#39;s just I have an extremely large amount of permafrost<br/>\n  experience - and getting lucky sometimes gives people the false<br/>\n  pretense that you can stroll in and own a particular place.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic, L14 - L24 in permafrost, most times died in this dungeon.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
