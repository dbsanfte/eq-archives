I was always under the<br/>\nimpression that the only melee attack that would interrupt spellcasting was a<br/>\nbash/slam.  For several levels now I have dual wielded thulian claws (DLY 19)<br/>\nand a dragoon dirk (23 DLY).  I have never noticed any of my attacks<br/>\ninterrupting a spell. Granted when a caster is interrupted its hard to tell what<br/>\ndid it.  Was it my pixie strike, the paladins bash, or one of our own casters<br/>\nhitting it with a Stun effect spell.  I thought the only way bards could<br/>\ninterrupt spellcasting was with songs like Bellow, Lullaby and Pixie Strike.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; 1) Hitting to interrupt casters (question: does chance of interruption<br/>\n&gt; increase with damage done?)<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
