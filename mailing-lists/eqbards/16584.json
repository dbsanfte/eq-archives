My best advice is to email to<br/>\n&lt;servername&gt;@... with a reminder that you are still waiting for<br/>\nhelp.  If that doesn&#39;t get a response within about 3 days send an email to<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jbutler@...\">jbutler@...</a> simply stating that you have been unable to get in touch<br/>\nwith your gm regarding an issue that they stated they would work with you<br/>\non.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t flame and try to stay calm when writing.  Jeff Butler is a really<br/>\nreasonable guy and sincerely wants to help.  But if he gets his back up he<br/>\ncan be a pain.  Be polite but firm and remind him that the GM told you to<br/>\nget in touch with them and that you have yet to hear back.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is the best way to get help when this happens.<br/>\n<br/>\nRemember:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Servername@...\">Servername@...</a> (Sends an email to your server&#39;s Senior(s), GM and GM<br/>\nLead Admin)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jbutler@...\">jbutler@...</a> (Sends an email directly to Jeff Butler, VP of Customer<br/>\nSupport at Verant)<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\n<br/>\nPS:  If any of you ever have a problem with a guide or GM feel free to send<br/>\nfeedback to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqseniors@...\">eqseniors@...</a> or to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:servername@...\">servername@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nServername = the name of your server WITHOUT spaces IE: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:therathe@...\">therathe@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nLyrnia<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Cranfill, Wendy&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Wendy_Cranfill@...\">Wendy_Cranfill@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, March 21, 2000 3:15 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Non-Bard Question....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Cranfill, Wendy&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Wendy_Cranfill@...\">Wendy_Cranfill@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Does anyone know who I can write/talk to if my GM hasn&#39;t responded to me<br/>\nin<br/>\n&gt; three weeks?  Some of you may remember that I had a lore container poof<br/>\nwith<br/>\n&gt; some items that didn&#39;t belong to me.  Our head GM asked me to write her an<br/>\n&gt; email.. which I did.  After not hearing from her in three days I wrote<br/>\n&gt; another and still have heard nothing.  I petition regularly when I&#39;m<br/>\nonline<br/>\n&gt; but the only resopnse I get is &quot;I&#39;m sure Kyrani will get to it.&quot;  Well, I<br/>\n&gt; think I&#39;ve been patient but perhaps I&#39;m not giving them enough time.  And<br/>\nif<br/>\n&gt; she doesn&#39;t respond, is there anywhere else to appeal?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks!<br/>\n&gt; Tani/Halana<br/>\n&gt; Solusek Ro<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Wendy Lynn Cranfill<br/>\n&gt; Maxtor Corporation<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; GET A NEXTCARD VISA, in 30 seconds!
