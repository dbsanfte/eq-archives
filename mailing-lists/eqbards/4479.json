Anywhere else?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>============================================<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 33rd Level, you can still get some XP in Cazic Thule. Sure,  a lot of<br/>\nmobs will be green, but there&#39;s good loot, and for me, it&#39;s ALWAYS been<br/>\nfairly easy to get a group there.<br/>\n<br/>\nMistmoor is another alternative. To me, however, Mistmoor Is a &quot;Crusbone on<br/>\nSteroids&quot;, meaning, a lot of stuff is green, a lot of stuff is red, and<br/>\nthere are a lot of trains. This is a good zone for us especially if you<br/>\ndon&#39;t have a drum yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nSolusek B is very good for you level. EVERYTHING SHOULD be blue or up, but<br/>\ndont even think about soloing there.<br/>\n<br/>\nLower Gukk is also good for XP, there are two sides you can enter, as well.<br/>\nI have played zone warrior on the &quot;live side&quot;, or mino side, where you can<br/>\nusually make it to the zone as you dont have to go in very far to find mobs.<br/>\n(On a side note.... you can also get one of the best Arm Armors I&#39;ve seen in<br/>\nthis area, and its relatively easy to get, as well. MUCH easier than rubi<br/>\narms in Cazic). THe OTHER side is the &quot;dead&quot; side, noted for tons of Undead<br/>\nFrogloks, Ice Bones, etc. This side has been much harder for my guild. I<br/>\nwouldnt do this side without a group for sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are the &quot;singles&quot; areas and mobs you could do... the basement in<br/>\nUnrest, giants, griffs, etc. Depends on what you want!<br/>\n<br/>\nI am sure there are plenty of other areas, too. These are just the ones I&#39;ve<br/>\nfrequented.<br/>\n<br/>\nTallonn - 37th Verse<br/>\nBertox</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
