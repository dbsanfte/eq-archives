I have a 23 bard that is stuck<br/>\n&gt; at 23 and 2<br/>\n&gt; bubbles in Unrest.  I have been in Unrest for two weeks now and<br/>\n&gt; only gained<br/>\n&gt; half a bubble.  I die at least once a night, usually due to bone-heads in<br/>\n&gt; the group.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I left Antonica mainly because it was getting over camped in the Karanas.<br/>\n&gt; I decided to hunt Mistmoor and Unrest for a while.  I did fairly well in<br/>\n&gt; Mistmoor my first few days, the rest of my days were terrible.  I<br/>\n&gt; then went<br/>\n&gt; to Cauldron and found it impossible to find a person to hunt Tidal Lords<br/>\n&gt; with.  I went to Unrest the past 2 weeks.  I had not been there<br/>\n&gt; since April<br/>\n&gt; of &#39;99 (it hasn&#39;t changed).  Well like I said, I gained half a bubble.  I<br/>\n&gt; went back out to Cauldron 2 days ago with a friend to hunt Tidal<br/>\n&gt; Lords, but<br/>\n&gt; the spawns were painfully slow.  So I gave up on that.  Back in to Unrest<br/>\n&gt; last night and another death.  Now I am heading back to Karana area<br/>\n&gt; tonight.  Oh, 2 weeks and I still have not been able to loot a<br/>\n&gt; bracelet for<br/>\n&gt; the bracer quest :(.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Although Crier suggest decent places that are easy for you to<br/>\n&gt; hunt, I would<br/>\n&gt; advise avoiding these especially during prime time as they are generally<br/>\n&gt; camped to the teeth: Oasis (90+ people is too damn much), Chickens in SK<br/>\n&gt; (way over camped and I found the exp to be terrible, the centuars are much<br/>\n&gt; better), Scythe beetles (they really only spawn during the daylight hours<br/>\n&gt; and are rare compared to borer and pincer beetles, they should be<br/>\n&gt; blue to you.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I plan on going to Lake Rathe, Rathe Mountians or Highkeep basement (yes,<br/>\n&gt; yes, I know it is way over camped too but I am tied of the long corpse run<br/>\n&gt; right now)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Other nice places that are train-free are crocs in Oasis<br/>\n&gt; (deepwaters at your<br/>\n&gt; &gt;level), Giant Skeletons in Rathe Mts., Aviaks in SK (dull),<br/>\n&gt; Scythe Beetles<br/>\n&gt; &gt;in NK, DE guards in Nektulos, and if you can stand the<br/>\n&gt; occasional train try<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Sol A, Permafrost, Upper Guk.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;[48 Bard] Crier (Half Elf) &lt;Seekers of Norrath&gt; ZONE: work<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; GET A NEXTCARD VISA, in 30 seconds!
