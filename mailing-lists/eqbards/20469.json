I can generally make it stick on anything blue<br/>\nor lower regularly.  Anything white or higher is about a 30-40% sucess rate<br/>\nbut if it&#39;s blue I can mez it about 70% of the time.  So Pixie is always an<br/>\noption in my song lineup.<br/>\n<br/>\nI prefer to charm as crowd control though it tends to wrek havoc with pet<br/>\nusers who don&#39;t keep track of their pets (have had more mage pets damn near<br/>\nkill me than I can count).  But if we get a bad pull where I have to lock<br/>\ndown 3 (or 4) I will use charm and pixie together<br/>\n<br/>\nCharm:  Sick on spare<br/>\nMez spare 3<br/>\nMez spare 4<br/>\n<br/>\nworks pretty well.  I&#39;m only 45 though so I can&#39;t swear it will work up into<br/>\nthe 50&#39;s.  Works ok at 45 though<br/>\n<br/>\nLyrnia Jongleur<br/>\nSinging since Beta 2<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:blitz_krieg@...\">blitz_krieg@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, July 12, 2000 2:45 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Re: secondary resists<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I think I&#39;ve used Pixie Strike all of once due to the feedback given<br/>\n&gt; from this list.  I die enough as it is, I&#39;m not particulary open to<br/>\n&gt; testing something out under fire that I&#39;m almost certain is gonna<br/>\n&gt; fail. :)  Lullaby, I use to powerlevel my girlfriend&#39;s twink and<br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s about it.  And I don&#39;t imagine that working so well when she<br/>\n&gt; gets to around 30 or so...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I almost exclusively use charm to do crowd control.  If I&#39;m the main<br/>\n&gt; crowd controller (i.e. no enchanter) I can usually effectively handle<br/>\n&gt; a 3 pull... put your pet on the 3rd mob and they&#39;ll beat each other<br/>\n&gt; up for awhile... But, you need a cleric to keep you alive with 2 mobs<br/>\n&gt; beating on you during resists or mis-timed recharms.  I&#39;ve been in a<br/>\n&gt; few parties where the paladin would taunt the 2nd, move out of range<br/>\n&gt; and root it... Frustrated me trying to get my pet to attack while he<br/>\n&gt; was rooted, but a pretty effective method nonetheless.  If there&#39;s 4<br/>\n&gt; and I don&#39;t think the group can handle at least 2 beating down the<br/>\n&gt; tanks at once, then it&#39;s time to call ZONE before you even get into<br/>\n&gt; the fight.  Hell, have the puller zone it off the bat. :)  I plan<br/>\n&gt; excursions to Sebilis/Chardok, etc. around a cleric and/or enchanter<br/>\n&gt; (no way I&#39;m going anywhere tough without at least one), so it&#39;s just<br/>\n&gt; pick up groups I have to worry about.  Karnor&#39;s is the prime spot for<br/>\n&gt; pickup groups on my server and luckily, the zone is close to most of<br/>\n&gt; the camp spots. :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Darkfox Reven&#39;tsol<br/>\n&gt; Xegony<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Get a NextCard Visa, in 30 seconds!<br/>\n&gt; 1.
