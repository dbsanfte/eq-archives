I was then informed that many of our skills have caps<br/>\non them of 40 or so.  What&#39;s the deal with this?  I really don&#39;t like the<br/>\nidea of skill caps, especially on a simple self preservation skill like<br/>\nforaging.  You already can&#39;t sell what you forage so why put a cap on it?<br/>\nDoes anyone know any more on this and what the possible reasoning behind<br/>\nthem could be?  What are bards just too stupid to learn these things really<br/>\nwell?  Its not bad enough we all get the useless skill of brass instruments<br/>\nat 12th level, which cannot be used till 18th.  Now Wood Elves get no new<br/>\nskill at 12th since forage is already maxed and hide is already at the<br/>\nsupposed cap as well.  Does that mean the xp penalty we take for being able<br/>\nto start with those skills will go away once we actually have them?  I think<br/>\nnot.  I&#39;m usually not big on ranting, but this has me really steamed.  What<br/>\ngood is it to get a skill at 25th level that caps at a point where it will<br/>\nonly work on things 10+ levels below you?<br/>\n <br/>\nJ.M.  Any thoughts on this one?  Please tell me this will change at some<br/>\npoint. <br/>\n <br/>\nKitasi the bewildered</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
