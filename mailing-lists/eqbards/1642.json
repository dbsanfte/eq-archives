It seems that with the song, I am also<br/>\n&gt;invisible to undead ( zombies and skellies).  Of course if you have an<br/>\n&gt;unlucky moment and become visible, then they all attack.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I remember reading that invisibility did not work for undead.  Was this <br/>\n&gt;only<br/>\n&gt;for the mana user&#39;s version, or do higher lvl undead&#39;s see right through <br/>\n&gt;it?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Mike Mott<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;HELLA-SNIP-SNIP&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nA friend and I (I&#39;m 21st he is 18th) had to zone to Lower Guk to escape a <br/>\nfroglok train. We were resting inside and I was using invis song while he <br/>\nwas afk. Shortly thereafter a high-level mage had to zone a Froglof Ghoul <br/>\nKnight..nasty stuff. It sat there at zone-line right in front of me for <br/>\nabout 3 seconds after she escaped before it started attacking my friend. Why <br/>\nnot me? I&#39;m thinking maye because he is a paladin..not sure. Anyways, I am <br/>\npretty sure Shauri&#39;s Clouding is useless on higher level undead.<br/>\n<br/>\nSartori D&#39;Elsiraad<br/>\nBard of Kelethin of the 21st Chorus<br/>\nVeeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
