It tells you exactly how Druids can solo<br/>\nREDs that are 6 levels above them.  Who needs heals when you never get hit?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shadowtech.net/EQdruids/iuna&#39;s.htm\">http://www.shadowtech.net/EQdruids/iuna&#39;s.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s true that Druids get their last heal spell at 29 (not 34), but after 29<br/>\nthey get 4 Regeneration spells that help heal themselves and the party.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWayne<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Yes it&#39;s true.  Druids get a lot of flak for being<br/>\n&gt; &quot;overpowered&quot; but that&#39;s mostly from people who haven&#39;t played<br/>\n&gt; the class.  They get one heal spell every 10 levels.  When<br/>\n&gt; they first get the spell, it can heal about one bubble.<br/>\n&gt; Within a few levels, it&#39;s a half bubble.  The last 3-4 levels<br/>\n&gt; before they get their next heal spell, by the time the druid<br/>\n&gt; gets the heal spell off the monster has done more damage than<br/>\n&gt; the spell healed.  They are basically useless as healers half<br/>\n&gt; their lower levels, and all of their higher levels (they get<br/>\n&gt; their last heal spell at 34ish I think). </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
