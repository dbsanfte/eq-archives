It looks like you have to be within melee<br/>\nrange for it to work.  I often times will Fear + Chain Broon when I&#39;m<br/>\ncruising through EK.  There have been a handful of times when I Fear him<br/>\nthat it does nothing... no message... no resists... nada.  If I move just a<br/>\ncouple steps closer, and re-apply Fear, it works as normal.  It&#39;s<br/>\ndisconcerting the first couple of times that it doesn&#39;t work, because you<br/>\nstill get the &quot;graphic&quot;, and you&#39;re sitting there waiting for your opponent<br/>\nto run away.<br/>\n<br/>\nDesmei Sightblinder<br/>\nLvl 28 Bard (Povar)<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: kbachman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbachman@...\">kbachman@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, October 05, 1999 9:17 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Screech<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: kbachman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbachman@...\">kbachman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nJust what is the range of a Screech?  I just got it and was testing it on <br/>\ngoblins in Misty and Beholder, and it seems to me that it only works on <br/>\nstuff very close to immediate melee range.  It seemed to be a very <br/>\nsmall area.  Is this true?  Or does it take awhile to kick in?  Or does <br/>\nrange increase with level?  I did enjoy watching four goblins drop <br/>\neverything and flee in terror.  Hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 27 songs, Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
