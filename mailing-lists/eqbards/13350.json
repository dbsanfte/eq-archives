Guards","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-300098833\">I&#39;ve been fighting ogre bouncers (always red to me) a lot recently.  I have<br/>\ngiven up on trying to get any of my higher level songs to stick on them.<br/>\nGuards have increased magic resistance so songs like largos, DDD, pixie,<br/>\nlullaby etc. almost always got resisted.  However, Bellow and CoD almost<br/>\nalways succeed. At 32d level, I would say my success at getting CoD to stick<br/>\nagainst bouncers (even with their high MR) was at least 75% and probably<br/>\nhigher.  As a result, I have been twisting Anthem, Psalm of Warmth, and CoD<br/>\nduring the fight and then Bellow when the bouncer starts to run.  The<br/>\nbouncers never fully resisted Bellow the entire night. Sometimes it wouldn&#39;t<br/>\ndo full damage but it still got through.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a side note, camping ogre bouncers and other guards is not as financially<br/>\nlucrative anymore with the recent patch.  Prior to the patch, bouncers<br/>\nalways dropped a regular steel weapon which you could sell for 11PP to a<br/>\nmerchant.  Now they are gonna start dropping fine steel weapons.  At least I<br/>\nmade around 100PP last night in Ogguk before the patch.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n32 bard<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; &gt; group.  It actually seemed that just continous Discord was our best<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bet.  (Bellow was almost always resissted by DW crocs).  In any case it<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Now that&#39;s interesting.  Bellow has a reputation for sticking<br/>\n&gt; on red mobs, so I find it unusual that you were getting<br/>\n&gt; resisted with Bellow, but getting Discord to stick.  Maybe<br/>\n&gt; they work against different resists?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
