Still, having played a<br/>\nnecro and a shaman, I can tell you that casters go through the same thing.<br/>\nThere are spells one should skip, and imagine the frustration of getting<br/>\nnothing new until you level 4 more times.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe idea, I guess, is to give bards something to look forward to each level,<br/>\nyour complaint, which I share, is that there are some things that are<br/>\ncomplete wastes unless you use them in specfic situations. Jig, for example,<br/>\nhelped me once when I died in Innothule Swamp and was bound to Rivervale. I<br/>\nhad nothing in the bank (BAD Bard!) and had to run, foodless, drumless<br/>\nacross the Ro desert. About halfway across Oasis, I was at 0 stamina. This<br/>\nis dangerous because even with the running song sans drum, I rely on jumping<br/>\nto scoot me away from an attacker. I sat down a memorized Jig (it took a<br/>\nwhile as i had NEVER memorized it before) and managed to get my stamina back<br/>\nup enough to safely cross the desert.<br/>\n<br/>\nDendall, Ollave of the Aegis<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.soerbaird.com\">http://www.soerbaird.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Marc Allie [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mallie@...\">mallie@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, April 30, 1999 11:34 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] &quot;Power&quot; Levels for bards...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Marc Allie &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mallie@...\">mallie@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI have noticed something that rather bothers me.  I am currently a level<br/>\n11 bard hanging out around the Freeport area.  This is my 3rd character<br/>\nsince the commercial release, and also the highest level I have reached.<br/>\nPreviously I have played a Wizard and a Shadow Knight.  I abandoned both<br/>\nat 5th level because they are too &quot;high level&quot;.  By this I mean that they<br/>\nachieve their greatest &quot;power&quot; at higher levels.  A wizard with no pet is<br/>\nnot even a match for a magician of similar level until somewhere in the<br/>\nteens, root notwithstanding.  The SK was a nice choice, but not even close<br/>\nto a warrior&#39;s skill, and with only minor spells until the mid-teens as<br/>\nwell.<br/>\n<br/>\nBards, however, struck me as powerful from the beginning.  It seemed like<br/>\nmy ability to mow through things whether alone or in a party would<br/>\ndramatically increase with each new song.  Up until 6th level, each new<br/>\nsong was fantastic, with the exception of the Jig of Vigor.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, now it seems the good songs and skills are few and far between.<br/>\nThe Whistling Warsong was an OK buff, but since it was only personal I<br/>\nused it rarely.  At 8th, it was hardly worth the boat ride to get the<br/>\nLullaby, and Elemental Rhythms at level 9 was rather pointless.  Then the<br/>\nmagic 10 hit, and I learned Dodge and the awesome Anthem de Arms.  AT 11,<br/>\nthough, I get the USELESS brass skill and the buggy or just plain weak<br/>\nCharisma booster.  Not exactly songs to light my fire.  12th, or course,<br/>\nyields the Bellow, a much sought after song.  Then I have to look forward<br/>\nto another &quot;don&#39;t memorize me, ever&quot; song or two, another Rhythm and the<br/>\nMagic Identifier (absolutely useless).  Honstly, the only 2 things I<br/>\nreally look forward to at all in the near future are the Sleep Song at 15,<br/>\nDual Wield at 17th, and the group invisibility song at 19th, I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone else noticed these &quot;bum&quot; levels, like 9th, 11th, and I am sure<br/>\nothers to come?  Are hih level bards even worth it?  I hate seeing posts<br/>\nlike &quot;I am 19th level and I still use Anthem de Arms and Hymn of<br/>\nRestoration almost exclusively&quot;.  It will be a long and boring wait until<br/>\nthe better abilities come, I am afraid.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat say you high level bards?  Is there light at the end of the tunnel?<br/>\n<br/>\nPistov of Cazic-Thule<br/>\n<br/>\n\t ___________________________________________________________<br/>\n\t|\t\t\t\t      \t\t\t    |<br/>\n\t|  Tyger, Tyger, burning bright\t       \t\t            |<br/>\n\t|  In the forests of the night,\t       Marc Allie\t    |<br/>\n\t|  What immortal hand or eye\t       \t\t\t    |<br/>\n\t|  Could frame thy fearful symmetry?   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mallie@...\">mallie@...</a>   |<br/>\n\t|\t\t\t\t      \t\t\t    |<br/>\n\t|           -William Blake-\t       \t\t\t    |<br/>\n\t|___________________________________________________________|<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nDid you know that you can now set up a shared calendar to<br/>\npost events of interest to your community?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nCheck out our homepage for details.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
