We don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; benefit from the additional haste (unless you&#39;re chain/fearing<br/>\n&gt; with weapons, and if you&#39;re doing that often enough that you<br/>\n&gt; feel you need one of these items, what&#39;s the point of being in<br/>\n&gt; a guild?).  The extra AC and stats are nice, but in no way<br/>\n&gt; make up for the additional haste (10%-15%) that another melee<br/>\n&gt; class could gain from these two items.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; (fbss only likely<br/>\n&gt; &gt; one now, and only then if no other guild members that need <br/>\n&gt; it are in group<br/>\n&gt; &gt; according to guild rules)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This I would sort of agree with, sort of disagree with.  With<br/>\n&gt; a low-end haste item like a swirlspine belt or FBSS, a bard<br/>\n&gt; could arguably gain *more* benefit than any other melee class.  <br/>\n&gt; Take the FBSS for example.  It gives a 21% haste.  For a L50<br/>\n&gt; bard whose normal melee haste is 30% (Verses), the FBSS will<br/>\n&gt; put them at 75% haste - a 35% improvement.  For a sub-50 bard<br/>\n&gt; whose normal max melee haste is 20% (Celerity), the FBSS gives<br/>\n&gt; a 45% improvement.  In the hands of any other melee class,<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s only a 21% improvement unless they&#39;re grouped with a bard<br/>\n&gt; or enchanter or shaman (only then does it become a 75%<br/>\n&gt; improvement).  The difference is even more pronounced with a<br/>\n&gt; swirlspine belt which from reports is a 15% haste.  I dunno<br/>\n&gt; how many bard/ench/sham are in your guild so I can&#39;t say how<br/>\n&gt; compelling an argument that would be.  But if the melee<br/>\n&gt; classes rarely group with bards and enchanters, then the melee<br/>\n&gt; argument favors the bard as most able to use a FBSS or<br/>\n&gt; swirlspine.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Now, OTOH, a bard of the right level to get these items has a<br/>\n&gt; *lot* of other tools available.  My Belt of Concordance goes<br/>\n&gt; mostly unused - a single Chant with my Selo&#39;s drum equals or<br/>\n&gt; exceeds my average melee output with weapons and max haste.  <br/>\n&gt; The only time I use my weapons lately is when I feel like<br/>\n&gt; diving into melee, or if the mob is pretty much immune to<br/>\n&gt; magic, or if I&#39;m prohibited from using the chants (TTs in<br/>\n&gt; Fear seem to poof if they die from a DoT).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I would recommend to your guild leader that rather than<br/>\n&gt; completely exclude bards from these items, to set up a<br/>\n&gt; &quot;scorecard.&quot;  If a bard has helped (say) 5 other people in the<br/>\n&gt; guild get a FBSS or swirlspine belt, then the next one is his.  <br/>\n&gt; That avoids the slippery slope problem where newer younger<br/>\n&gt; guildmembers keep getting ahead of you in priority.  I would<br/>\n&gt; stay out of the CoF and RBB entirely, but if you really want<br/>\n&gt; one, I&#39;d suggest something like seeing 25-30 of them given to<br/>\n&gt; guildmembers before you&#39;re allowed to roll for it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; i need some pursuasive arguments to back me up. this is a <br/>\n&gt; guild of 150+<br/>\n&gt; &gt; different players.  (tho minus a few bards lately)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Not many guilds on Karana with 150+ players.  ;-)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; i tried a few arguments mentioned on this list, but the <br/>\n&gt; leaders of the<br/>\n&gt; guild<br/>\n&gt; &gt; are pretty sure that since bards have haste songs, they <br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t need a haste<br/>\n&gt; &gt; item. (even tho they stack)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Their reasoning is wrong - if you follow it through like I did<br/>\n&gt; above, bards get the *most* melee benefit from haste items of<br/>\n&gt; any class.  But for the other reasons I outlined above, I<br/>\n&gt; pretty much have to side with them.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; OTOH, they damn well better be willing to break their backs to<br/>\n&gt; teleport a bard up to air if a Belt of Concordance drops and<br/>\n&gt; there&#39;s no bard present.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
