With the (rare) exception <br/>\n&gt;of the single-target songs,<br/>\n&gt;everything we sing is AE.  This includes not just the AE damage songs, but <br/>\n&gt;all party buff songs as well.<br/>\n&gt;If a MOB is within the radius, they will notice.  This is why, when <br/>\n&gt;fighting in, say, Cazic, you will get<br/>\n&gt;a pile of lizards beating on you:  1) they wander towards the party, 2) <br/>\n&gt;they enter your area of effect, 3)<br/>\n&gt;unless someone did something to explicitly tick them off, you are now the <br/>\n&gt;target.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Kenross Cantoforjado, 35 songs, Innoruuk<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Actually not so much messed up code as a poor patch job.  See till late in <br/>\nBeta bard songs effect ALL PC/NPCs in the effect area, not just party <br/>\nmembers.  I used to help groups all the time in Beta by standing near them & <br/>\nhealing/buffing with out being in their group.  Of course the funniest part <br/>\nof this would be people that would &#39;hitch a ride&#39; on a passing bard and the <br/>\ncasters that would have their mediation interrupted by a passing bard :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn Swiftsong - Karana server<br/>\n<br/>\nEQ Bard Song Analysis<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://rgonzalez.net/EQSongs/\">http://rgonzalez.net/EQSongs/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
