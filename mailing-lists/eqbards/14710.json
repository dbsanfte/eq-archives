She has always been helpful, and we<br/>\noften spend down time, just chatting.  I make every effort to help her<br/>\nwhenever I can, for example I am going to Erudan to buy my lvl 19 song,<br/>\nso I ask her if there&#39;s anything she needs from that part of the<br/>\nworld.   <br/>\nThis weekend, though, a friend of hers wanted to buy a nice item<br/>\n(executioner axe) but was 50 (yea the guy was sticking that hard to his<br/>\nprice, and wouldn&#39;t take any items in trade).  She saw I was in Oasis<br/>\n(he was the N freeport tradign bazaar), and asked me if I had the money<br/>\n(amazingly I did, I was saving up to buy a pair of jagged bands).  So I<br/>\n(gladly) ran to freeport (annoying my group, though they understood once<br/>\nI explained) and gave him the money.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo make it even cooler (I was so excited to give something back), on my<br/>\nway back, I ran into Dorn (he had been trained to zone).  Hmmm, cons<br/>\nblue...  Hmmm... I can do this...  He&#39;s on my agro list (I keep a list<br/>\nof EVRYTHING that has killed me).  So I fire up selo&#39;s, bellow x6,<br/>\nrepeat and kite him up and down the beach.  One less dark elf on my agro<br/>\nlist (too bad he didn&#39;t have anything, I was hoping for at least some<br/>\nringmail)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I&#39;d just like to thank whoever on the list suggested the lvl 18<br/>\n&quot;no weapons&quot; solo technique.  After losing lvl 18 4 times (ugh) in bad<br/>\ngroups, I decided to solo, and used that technique to get 4/5 of the way<br/>\nthere last night in N Karana.  (0, count em, 0 deaths, amazing for me). <br/>\nNo to mention some nice druid let me loot a griffene charm (though I<br/>\nlike collar of undead protection better)<br/>\n-- <br/>\nWe now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>\n<br/>\nMatt DeBarger</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
