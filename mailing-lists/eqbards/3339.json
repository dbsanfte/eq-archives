Always by the lake where the<br/>\nskeletons form in piles, and zombies and mummies sit down.<br/>\nI will try charming a ghoul soon (one bubble til 27) and<br/>\ncommanding it to sit down and see what it looks like.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe lake is also something I&#39;ve been meaning to explore a<br/>\nlittle better.  The water is murky so it&#39;s easy to miss<br/>\nsomething.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; One minute Ged is standing there happily, the next moment,<br/>\n&gt; a werewolf...(seen by a friend)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Wow, neat.  I&#39;ll have to try asking Kithicor about a few<br/>\nthings in the hopes I can stumble across a keyword.  The<br/>\nbiggest frustration in tracking down these folks in Kithicor<br/>\nis that I cannot track.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; One night I saw Luna?? run into a burned out house and a<br/>\n&gt; female zombie run out.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hmm, I ran into Ged again a few hours later, and he was alone.<br/>\nI found Luna some distance away.  I figured they walked<br/>\ndifferent routes and the first time I just happened to catch<br/>\nthem at the same place at the same time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And why doesn&#39;t she speak?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Lots of NPCs don&#39;t speak - Rivervale is full of them.  I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t think much of it at the time, figuring it was as yet<br/>\nunimplemented.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; *one* goblin? How often do you see a lone goblin? Not<br/>\n&gt; named, just a regular ol&#39; goblin. Is he lost?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Pretty frequently actually.  Each undead camp seems to have<br/>\nseveral individual spawn &quot;spots.&quot;  Each &quot;spot&quot; can spawn<br/>\nanywhere from 1 to 7 (most I&#39;ve seen) undead, always of the<br/>\nsame type.  The druid stones in North Ro operate the same way,<br/>\nthough you may be right - I don&#39;t recall ever seeing ghouls<br/>\nspawn there in anything but groups of two.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are wisps in Kithicor too - very rare but occasionally<br/>\nyou will see them.  The place actually reminds me a lot of<br/>\nLesser Faydark, but with a lot more fog.  LFay also has orc<br/>\nand undead camps, and a ranger(?) outpost, as well as the<br/>\nfaerie and brownie villages.  It is also a zone well worth<br/>\nexploring from L8 on up if you are into avoiding crowds.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
