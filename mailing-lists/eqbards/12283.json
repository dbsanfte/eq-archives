I have finally, finally advanced out of <br/>\n&gt; level 45 hell.  Hurrah!<br/>\n&gt;  Of course I have no sense and the very next morning I went <br/>\n&gt; on a Vox raid and she<br/>\n&gt; kindly took it from me.  Twice.  Ouch.  Ah well, it would <br/>\n&gt; have been worth it but<br/>\n&gt; alas no horn =(.  Still, the Seafury Cyclops eventually <br/>\n&gt; yielded the re-ding.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; By the way, I used the knowledge I gained here about good <br/>\n&gt; strategies for Nagafen and<br/>\n&gt; Vox to prepare my song list.  Nagafen was last week, and yes <br/>\n&gt; he thought bard tasted<br/>\n&gt; really good too.  Lost the drum lotto on that one *pout*.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have 46 to get through before I attempt the Planes - I want <br/>\n&gt; that margin! - but<br/>\n&gt; that will be soon I hope.  I have read a few posts on the <br/>\n&gt; topic of Plane strategies,<br/>\n&gt; but am eager for more.  Help me out please?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Maravana Vireo of the Jus Divinum<br/>\n&gt; Level 46 bard of Mithaniel Marr </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
