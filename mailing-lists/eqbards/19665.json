There are<br/>\ndronga quests where you combind items in various things like the forge, etc.<br/>\nThe names of the forage, brew barrel, etc. all imply that skill in the trade<br/>\nis not a factor (NeverFail, AlwaysWork, etc etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, very probably, you need to get a bunt cake, get the recipe, get the<br/>\nother needed items and bake it in the oven in Dronga.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeems like Verant is trying to add more of these kinds of quests.  They have<br/>\nrecently tried to complete the monk quest for the Whistling Fist Robe (?? I<br/>\nthink its a robe.)  It&#39;s the completion of the headbands quest they had.<br/>\nAnd they also said they were gonna patch so that skill in the trade is not a<br/>\nfactor.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Reece, Tom CPT- 25IDL G4&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &quot;EQBards&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, June 12, 2000 8:27 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Burynai bundt cake quest<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; This has been a topic on my guild mailing list lately.
