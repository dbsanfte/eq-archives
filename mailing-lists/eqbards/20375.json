I am <br/>\n&gt; getting ready to<br/>\n&gt; go to Fear for my first time soon and I was wondering a few <br/>\n&gt; things about the<br/>\n&gt; zone maybe you guys and gals can help me with:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1. What kinds of items should a bard try to get in on a lotto <br/>\n&gt; for in fear?<br/>\n&gt; As far as I understand it, the only bard stuff that drops there is the<br/>\n&gt; crumby imbrued bracer?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 2. What kind of tactics should a bard use in fear?  Obviously <br/>\n&gt; mana song, but<br/>\n&gt; what else is good up there?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 3. Got any other little tips for a bard heading to his first planar<br/>\n&gt; experience?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; TIA </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
