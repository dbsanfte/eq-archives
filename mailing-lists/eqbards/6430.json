I couldn&#39;t time it as accurately<br/>\nsince most of these fights were pretty close for my group, but<br/>\nthe time between attacks dropped from about 3 seconds to 4<br/>\nseconds (c.f. 3.0 to 3.8 sec testing it on beetles).  <br/>\nChaining the mob as well did not slow it down any further.  <br/>\nResist rate was about the same for both, so area effect and AC<br/>\ndrop vs slower movement should dictate which of the two you<br/>\nwant to use.  And they most certainly do attack while under<br/>\nthe effect, they just don&#39;t attack as often.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe enchanter was playing with her new L39 spells, and their<br/>\nattack slowdown is significantly slower than Chain/Binding.<br/>\nI&#39;d estimate a roughly 2x slowdown vs 1.25x for ours.  It did<br/>\nnot seem to stack, but it&#39;s tough to see the difference<br/>\nbetween 2x and 2.25x.  I&#39;ll have to time it with a less<br/>\neffective enchanter debuff in the future.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those who group with enchanters, debuffs do not wake mobs<br/>\nthat have been mesmerized/Lullabyed/Pixie Struck.  You can<br/>\nTashan, Chain, Bind, weaken, cancel, etc. to your heart&#39;s<br/>\ncontent and they will not wake up.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
