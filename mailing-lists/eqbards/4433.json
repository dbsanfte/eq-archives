The message you will receive is something along the<br/>\nlines that you are maxed for your level. I cannot remember the exact wording<br/>\nbut that is the content.  I have even fought Hand to Hand for a full 3 bars<br/>\nworth of xp thinking training will not go up further, but actual hands on<br/>\n(no pun intended) training would increase it.
