Eventually after<br/>\nkilling enough goblins the halflings will warm up to you and start giving<br/>\nyou xps for the beads.  The only downsides are you have to get through<br/>\nKithicor Forest, The halfling guards as spastic about stealing your kills<br/>\nand all that crouching makes your back ache.<br/>\n<br/>\nI found Misty Thicket to be a great beginning area.<br/>\n<br/>\nRylos of E&#39;ci<br/>\nLevel 18 Bard<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n BTW off topic, but what are some good lvling <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; areas for a <br/>\n&gt; semi-twinked (still wanna learn to play the class as <br/>\n&gt; intended) lvl 8 bard.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Klayan Deathbringer (The Oracle) lvl 50 Necro<br/>\n&gt; Celantra (The Oracle) lvl 8 semi-twink Bard </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
