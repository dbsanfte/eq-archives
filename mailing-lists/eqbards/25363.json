I can&#39;t speak for solo play, but in group play we simply kick ass.  Even on raids, with the right guild that knows how to use us, we&#39;re no slouches.  Thott throws out a lot of numbers about how we don&#39;t scale well as we level, but somehow his analysis doesn&#39;t mirror my experiences on a daily basis.<br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully VI is just looking at &quot;stacking issues&quot; and not anything more grand. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkfox<br/>\nXegony<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Ugh....<br/>\n  Its funny... the more I play my bard and the higher she gets, I find myself<br/>\n  sometimes not telling people everything I can do, kind of keeping a low<br/>\n  profile, hoping that they don&#39;t notice.  Seriously, don&#39;t laugh, its just<br/>\n  that bards seem very overpowered to me at higher levels, then again 60<br/>\n  shaman with Can IV....  I used to think all level 60 were equally powerful<br/>\n  but I&#39;m changing my thoughts.   I hope nobody else figures this out!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Tani, 54 Bardette<br/>\n  Halana, 60 Shaman<br/>\n  Solusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
