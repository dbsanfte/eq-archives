I did party with you remember<br/>\n=).  But the biggest overridding difference between the two of us is the<br/>\nfact that you are runnin in 1024x768 and I am in 640x480.  I am also<br/>\npresuming that you are using glide and not DirectX for your card.  Glide<br/>\nis much better for the Voodoo line of cards.  In this case the only<br/>\nsolution may be to get a faster processor and a better video card =).  Me<br/>\nI humbly play at 640x480, just couldn&#39;t stand the way your inventory<br/>\nscreen was not full screen when I ran at 800x600.<br/>\n<br/>\nTreilanin Bard of Kelethin<br/>\nAariel Mage of Felwithe</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
