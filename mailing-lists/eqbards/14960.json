At level 14, &quot;fight the same mobs&quot;<br/>\nmeans not just &quot;fight dervs&quot; or &quot;fight orcs&quot; because they will come in a<br/>\nwide variety of levels.  What he means is fight mobs of the same type and<br/>\nsame &quot;con&quot; level - and preferably high blues or white/black (even cons).<br/>\nThis will give you more standard results.  You can group and be fighting<br/>\nreds - which is where your skill vs mob level difference will produce those<br/>\nmisses.  It&#39;s how I can walk up to Aviak Rooks and whack em and then stand<br/>\nthere and let them flail away at me.  Because of the level difference, they<br/>\nwill have lots and lots of misses compared to when I was closer to their<br/>\nlevel and they could easily tear me apart.  That could be why you are seeing<br/>\nlots of misses - you get low damage and misses when you fight reds.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, if you are going to test, make sure you fight the same type and same<br/>\nlevel mob for you testing.  Also your skills in weapon types should be the<br/>\nsame level.  A maxed skill in 1HS will do better than a low skill in 1HB.<br/>\nTo be fair make sure your skills are comparable.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr, just get an Ashenwood Short Spear and Dragoon Dirk until you can get a<br/>\nStaff of Writhing and Obsidian Shard &lt;g&gt;  And some day, you will be 2YK<br/>\ncompliant too! &lt;trust me&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\np.s. John, thanks! - hehe I been working hard and getting lots of help from<br/>\nmy guild sibs - nice to have a 50 pulling single specs in an endless stream.<br/>\nAnd a few trips to the bats & bugs.  Endless hours with Bouncers. Cyndreela,<br/>\nCyndreela, how many different ways can we kill you?  OMG We have been here<br/>\nfor 6 hours straight!!! Spectres, spectres, spectres.  I cried when they<br/>\nstarted turning green - that means I still gotta kill em but dont get xp.<br/>\n<br/>\np.s.s. last night on our run to clear fire giants, my first group was me, 2<br/>\ndruids and 2 rogues.  I played berserker, they have Kedge and dragon weps<br/>\nand haste sash.  We were consistently stealling the xp kills (doing the most<br/>\ndamage) off the bugs from the other groups who had lev 50 monks.  Finally,<br/>\nthey split us up, knowing not even 2 druids could keep 2 rogues alive on<br/>\nFG&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Tue, 15 Feb 2000 <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:BROWNCA9@...\">BROWNCA9@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hi there, I&#39;m Hire. 14th level bard on Vallon ZEK!
