What attributes are important? How much to each?<br/>\n<br/>\nSince they are part fighter, strength sounds like it could use some. Maybe<br/>\nsome stamina. Their songs, what would that be? Intelligence?<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you really need much charisma? seems like you could use one of your<br/>\nsongs to enhance your charisma when necessary<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nJesse &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:j@...\">j@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lumiere.net/\">http://www.lumiere.net/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
