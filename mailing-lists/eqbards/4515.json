If they want to cast an<br/>\nunmemorized spell, they sit, memorize it in 2 seconds, pop up,<br/>\ncast it, sit down, and rememorize the original.  Total time -<br/>\nless than 10 seconds.  If a bard wants to use an unmemorized<br/>\nsong (e.g. see invisible to check for invisible campers), you<br/>\nsit down, memorize for 15-30 seconds, pop up, sing the song,<br/>\nsit down, and rememorize the original for another 15-30<br/>\nseconds.  It can take well over a minute to do all this.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H. Kim<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
