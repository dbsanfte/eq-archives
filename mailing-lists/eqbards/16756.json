I&#39;m currently<br/>\nlevel 10, so you&#39;ll outlevel me soon & be giving me advice.  Until then...<br/>\n<br/>\nsolo:  battle chant + hymn + whistle<br/>\ngroup:  chant + hymn, or chant + hymn + jig<br/>\n<br/>\nthe only time I use the wince song is if I&#39;m pulling in an open area.  It<br/>\nhelps avoid 10 minutes of  &quot;your target is too far away, you can&#39;t see your<br/>\ntarget, your target is too far away, etc&quot;.  Just one pulse to get their<br/>\nattention then I go back to the setlist.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I got the level 9 MR I switched to using that in place of either jig or<br/>\nhymn depending on whether we had a tank & healer or what we were fighting.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I got the level 10 Anthem I switched to using that in place of chant<br/>\nunless I was in a caster heavy group.  Chant gives a dexterity buff that<br/>\nfinger wigglers appreciate.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I&#39;m just starting to get into situations where I keep my instruments<br/>\nin hand for entire battles.  These are still the exception, but when I do do<br/>\nit it&#39;s affects are appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace & happy hunting<br/>\nEvulia, bard of 10 verses, Tunare<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I am about to hit level 8 so I dont have a lot of them, <br/>\n&gt; however what I do<br/>\n&gt; is start off by singing the str/dex song you get at lev1, <br/>\n&gt; then once its<br/>\n&gt; started<br/>\n&gt; I start up my regeneration song, then I start whistling the <br/>\n&gt; ancient warsong<br/>\n&gt; (lev 7)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; then I keep rotating between em to keep them going, and so <br/>\n&gt; far it seems to<br/>\n&gt; work<br/>\n&gt; nicely for me.  I will occasionally add in the lev 2 song <br/>\n&gt; that makes the<br/>\n&gt; enemy &quot;wince&quot;<br/>\n&gt; but its kind of dangerous and Im never sure if its helping <br/>\n&gt; much anyway.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What are some tips I can look forward to using at future levels?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also, well...I was gonna ask about some weapons...but Ill put <br/>\n&gt; it in another<br/>\n&gt; mail to keep this thread pure.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Cerulia<br/>\n&gt; Bard of 7.8 songs, Fennin Ro<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; GET A NEXTCARD VISA, in 30 seconds!
