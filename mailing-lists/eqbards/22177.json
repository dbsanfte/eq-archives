I am finally a mana-battery!<br/>\n*cheers*<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso got her an erudite mask and thank god its a good face cuz Tani&#39;s guise<br/>\ngives her the ugliest DE face (Hally has the second ugliest!) so I&#39;m glad I<br/>\ngot a good one for a change! [insert anti-twink comments here]<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those of you looking for good xp in the early 30s, try the giant<br/>\nfortress in Frontier Mountains... its OMG good xp.  We had a balanced group<br/>\n(31 bard, 31 monk, 34 warrior, 27 cleric) and pretty much fought nonstop.<br/>\nSet up shop right inside.  Got just over a bubble an hour but you gotta<br/>\nwatch out for those Mountain Giant Craigs (ouch!).<br/>\n<br/>\nDid anyone participate in the ToT finals on test?  Hear they were great<br/>\nfights!!! My guild got bumped out after a couple rounds to a PvP team but<br/>\nweere still happy :)  <br/>\n<br/>\nHope everyone had a good weekend :)<br/>\n<br/>\nTani, 32nd Bardette-mana-battery<br/>\nHalana, 57th Shaman <br/>\nSolusek Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
