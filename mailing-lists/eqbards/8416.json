The stats<br/>\nwould slightly increase as their song pulsed over mine. I havent<br/>\ntested it recently, but Hymm never did stack.  You got two <br/>\nmessages and two graphicals, but the hp went up as fast as<br/>\none bard singing it.  Now, I&#39;m not sure if one bard starts<br/>\nHymm, and another stronger voice tries to sing Hymm, if the<br/>\nclient is smart enough to turn off the previous one in favor<br/>\nof the new stronger heal.  I imagine it does, since other songs<br/>\nbehave this way.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis weekend, two groups of level 40-45 killed the ghoul lord<br/>\na few times and pulled SSotY and SSB.  I played a pretty nice<br/>\nrole as the only bard in the 12 people there.
