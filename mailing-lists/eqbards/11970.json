I have<br/>\nbeen lurking for a while but have been having a hard time recently so I<br/>\nthought I would ask for some advice.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically the problem is that I keep getting killed ) I am fairly well<br/>\nequipped with mostly bronze armour except for crested spaulders, thick<br/>\nleather apron, black iron crown and some bracers. I&#39;m also wearing some good<br/>\njewellery and have these states:<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 100  AGI: 93   DEX: 121   CHA: 100<br/>\n<br/>\nMy weapons are a silvery war axe and an obsidian shard.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe gear is mostly thanks to my cleric, Sanan Starbright who retired and<br/>\nleft all his stuff to Bruen )<br/>\n<br/>\nAll my weapon and music skills are maxed for my level and I have all my<br/>\nsongs.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll in all I think an above average character for my level. I play a<br/>\nfighter-bard so mostly use my weapons rather that fight with instruments.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut still I keep getting killed. I can solo fine but dont like to, grouping<br/>\nis more fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the puller starts to look I turn off all my songs, and get out my<br/>\nweapons. Then once the pull arrives and we get stuck in I start twisting<br/>\nAnthem and  Guardian if I&#39;m in a warrior-heavy group (I usually am) and just<br/>\nGuardian if I am in a mage-heavy group.  Later on I usually twist in Largos<br/>\nBinding or Lullaby if the fight is going badly. I add resists as needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would welcome any comments on my tactics.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat seems to happen is that I end up with all the mobs on me and I get<br/>\nripped apart.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is what happened to me in Unrest last time. I was in a group with a<br/>\nlevel 25 Warrior (the puller), a level 22 Shadow Knight, a level 20 Shaman,<br/>\na level 20 Wizard and a level 23 Necromancer. I had my weapons out and no<br/>\nsongs playing when the puller came back with a Dry Bone and two Dark Bones.<br/>\nBefore I even started playing a song or attacking all 3 were on me and could<br/>\nnot be taunted off me, so I died. This was only my 3rd time in Unrest, not a<br/>\ngood start. Somehow I always seem to end up with all the mobs on me even<br/>\nwithout playing Largos or Lullaby.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere am I going wrong? Or is bard hate really this bad? If it is that bad<br/>\nthen how do you all manage?<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t get me wrong, I have been in some great groups, one in particular in<br/>\nMistmoore so its not all bad, I&#39;m really looking to see if anyone has any<br/>\ntips or if it is this bad for everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance<br/>\n<br/>\nBruen Bladesong<br/>\nErollisi Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
