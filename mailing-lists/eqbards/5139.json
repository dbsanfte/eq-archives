I have close to the<br/>\nsame dexterity as you, 110, and I never miss when starting the Carrilon, at least<br/>\nnot lately.  I know when I first got the song, I used to miss quite a bit, but<br/>\nthat&#39;s like any song, the first while after you get it are murder for getting it<br/>\ngoing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have used the Carrilon a LOT, between my smithing and buying steel plate and<br/>\ngetting oddball quests.  I think that&#39;s a factor that shouldn&#39;t be overlooked.<br/>\n<br/>\nJyzan of Karana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
