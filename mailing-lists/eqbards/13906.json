In other words, the pet<br/>\nkeeps stuff off of the caster so the caster&#39;s spell don&#39;t get interrupted.<br/>\nThis does not necessarily mean the pet is inflicting a lot of damage.  The<br/>\nprimary source of damage that the mob gets hit for should come from the<br/>\ncaster&#39;s spells, not the pet.  If the mob starts to attack the caster, the<br/>\npet should a built in Taunt skill to draw the mob off the caster.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just started up a newbie magician the other day so my opinion is subject<br/>\nto change 180 degrees as I play him more:-)<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\nPS There was a recent post on the official EQ site from a 50 warrior who had<br/>\ndueled a 50 necro.  The only thing the necro did was sic his pet on the<br/>\nwarrior.  He didn&#39;t cast any spells.  The necro pet won:-).  Abashi&#39;s<br/>\nresponse was that the warrior didn&#39;t have the right equipment for a 50<br/>\nwarrior (warrior was in crafted) and that he must not have used a good<br/>\nstrategy against the pet.  I was always under the impression that there<br/>\nwasn&#39;t much strategy to playing a warrior. Hit AutoAttack and start pushing<br/>\nthe bash/slam/kick/taunt buttons.  Despite what Abashi said, IMO a pet<br/>\nshould never beat or even come close to beating an equal level melee class.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPPS Is this the list record for longest OT thread?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; &gt; Heh bards aren&#39;t melee classes they don&#39;t even have double attack and<br/>\n&gt; until<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you get a yekeshas or two you can&#39;t do much.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Naeeldar<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s my point.  Necros aren&#39;t melee classes either, and are<br/>\n&gt; supposed to be less of a melee class than bards.  Therefore it<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t make sense that they have the ability to do more melee<br/>\n&gt; damage than bards.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
