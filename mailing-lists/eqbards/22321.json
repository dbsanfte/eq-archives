Pretty wimpy weapon based on the difficulty required to get it.<br/>\nBy the time you are high enough level to kill the mob that drops it, you<br/>\nalmost certainly already have a better weapon than this.<br/>\n<br/>\nI checked the spoilers sites and EQLizer lists this weapon as dropping in<br/>\nMines of Nurga, not Droga.  Supposedly Sainy&#39;s Singing Dagger (7/22 procs<br/>\nSymphonic Harmony) drops in Droga, which would be more appropriate in<br/>\nregards to risk/reward.  I heard a rumor that the SSD was dropping when<br/>\nKunark first came out but it was since removed from the drop table for some<br/>\nreason.  I&#39;m guessing the Whistling Dagger was put into its place and now<br/>\ndrops in both Droga and Nurga.  Does anyone know the real deal on this?  If<br/>\nthe SSD is still dropped in Droga, does anyone know what mob drops it and<br/>\nits location?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
