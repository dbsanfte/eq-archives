Even at that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it&#39;s several minutes for 8gold and faction, I imagine not a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lot of mail will<br/>\n&gt; &gt; be flowing along that route.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Heh, guess I should have included &quot;&lt;/sarcasm&gt;&quot;  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nOh I knew you meant that.
