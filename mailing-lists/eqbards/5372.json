The new Stein of Moggok as well as being <br/>\na 7/43 1 Hand Blunt Weapon does still retain the Glowing Stein bonuses of <br/>\n+10 Int +5 Dex +10 HP and +20 sv Disease.<br/>\n<br/>\nGM&#39;s have confirmed the Quest difficulty is also being increased when the <br/>\nnew item is implemented. One great side effect of this is that you can now <br/>\nwield the stein in a primary melee slot (since its primary only) and be safe <br/>\nfrom the charm-morph bug.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is actually an improvement of the item. Those lucky enough to have both <br/>\na Glowing Black Sphere and a Stein have hit the jackpot now. Complete safety <br/>\nnear charming monsters and 19 int. Combining with the Crude Stein is also <br/>\npopular with Enchanters.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would advise getting a stein before the patch if you want one though <br/>\nbecause Verant&#39;s definition of &quot;harder&quot; can be an understatement (eg: Plane <br/>\nof Fear)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn Swiftsong - Karana server<br/>\nMaster Brewer of Societus Argenti<br/>\nAmerginn - Test server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
