I played a wizard<br/>\nstarting in beta 1 and got him to lvl 25 before phase 3 started... i quit<br/>\nsoon as it did. Mostly because clarity wasnt in the game yet (though<br/>\nenchanters where awesomely powerful thx thx whirl till you hurl) and then<br/>\nthey nerfed rain spells. One of our favorite things to do was have two tanks<br/>\nrun around lower runneye and make a massive train while me and another<br/>\nwizard friend would cast rain spells from far, far away. Worked awesome,<br/>\nwell, except the tanks tended to die if they got a bit too eager pulling :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThen somebody posted about us doing that on the dev board and walla... rain<br/>\nspells where useless. So i quit till final in disgust, figuring they wouldnt<br/>\nneed me to help betatest with phase 3 starting. When final did roll out I<br/>\npicked the one class that could speed up med times, and never regreted it. I<br/>\nam probably the only bard out there that doesnt feel insulted when people<br/>\nbeg for the mana song :)<br/>\n<br/>\nGendal Concorden, virtuoso of Tunare<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.norrath.org\">http://www.norrath.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:garramone@...\">garramone@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, January 10, 2001 12:48 PM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Why did you start a Bard?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; i was a wizard in beta3.  got to level 18, then they changed the way AC<br/>\n&gt; works and i died too much.  i finally broke down and started letting my<br/>\nwife<br/>\n&gt; play.  a friend of ours told us how the level 7 and level 10 songs stacked<br/>\n&gt; (when they did back then) and how sweet it was LOL.  even though they<br/>\nfixed<br/>\n&gt; that long ago, that is how it got started.  i quit the wizard and started<br/>\n&gt; playing my wife&#39;s bard, and that continued in final til she started her<br/>\nown<br/>\n&gt; cleric.  i wanted to stay a bard because of being a casting class with<br/>\nplate<br/>\n&gt; armor *grin* and also wood elves are just hot.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Shada, 58 Bard<br/>\n&gt; Afterlife<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve always wondered why other Bards started playing the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Bardic class.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
