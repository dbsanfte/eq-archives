I was wearing Banded, Loved the look, hated the<br/>\n&gt; helm.  Of course, I hate anything that covers up my naturally boyish good<br/>\n&gt; looks ;)  But in any case, when I upgraded to Bronze (I&#39;m only 19th, BTW -<br/>\n&gt; Bronze isn&#39;t considered &quot;twinkie&quot; by this level, since so many people are<br/>\n&gt; buying and selling it) that was the UGLIEST helm I&#39;d ever seen.  I looked<br/>\n&gt; like the Rocketman :P  Fortunately, I had saved my Banded helm, and so I<br/>\n&gt; went back to it - at least it was better than Bronze.  I understand<br/>\n&gt; Rubicite follows the Bronze model, in which case, I may just dodge Rubi<br/>\n&gt; helms, too :P<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Talies the Orange-clad wanderer<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  your connection to people who share your interests.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
