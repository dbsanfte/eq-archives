His job is to listen to <br/>\n&gt; problems and take<br/>\n&gt; them to the people who know how to fix them.  He may, on <br/>\n&gt; occasion, offer<br/>\n&gt; advice based on his experiences or come up with ideas on his <br/>\n&gt; own.  But you<br/>\n&gt; cannot expect him to have firm knowledge of how every song <br/>\n&gt; and every spell<br/>\n&gt; and every skill in the game works.  That&#39;s totally unfair.  <br/>\n&gt; He _does_ have<br/>\n&gt; general knowledge about bards.  He knows we use instruments <br/>\n&gt; and have songs<br/>\n&gt; that last far shorter durations than normal spells.  That&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; all he really<br/>\n&gt; NEEDS to know.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Give the guy a break for crying out loud.
