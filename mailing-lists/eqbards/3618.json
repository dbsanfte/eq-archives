What is it, how<br/>\nmuch is it, and where can I get one?  Also I was wondering, besides<br/>\nrubicite, is there another armor that has the very high AC and yet is light?<br/>\nIs mesh an option for bards?  What exactly is mesh anyway?  I&#39;ve heard many<br/>\nLooking to buy&#39;s but I don&#39;t believe I&#39;ve ever actually noticed anyone<br/>\nwearing it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd my gripe of the day -- TWINKING HAS BECOME RAMPANT ON EROLLISI MARR!!!!!<br/>\nI saw a lvl 5 bard yesterday walking through Freeport with a full suit of<br/>\nbronze plate.  That&#39;s just silly.  He said a friend gave it to him, nice<br/>\ngift.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, my real life brother-in-law just started about 3 days<br/>\nago.  No sooner had his new character spawned at the Freeport gates than<br/>\nsome lvl 20+ came up and handed him a FS Rapier, asked if he wanted a 2H<br/>\ninstead and then waved and ran off almost before I could tell him how to say<br/>\nthank you.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo scratch the gripe unless it is an extreme case.  I guess I&#39;m just bent<br/>\nbecause my bank account hovers between 5 and 20pp constantly so there&#39;s no<br/>\nway I could buy plate or any other really cool items yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nWeiland the Extremely Poor Bard of Freeport<br/>\nErollisi Marr </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
