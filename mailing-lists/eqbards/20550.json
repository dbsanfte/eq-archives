It happens sometimes.<br/>\nBut yesterday morning, I moved Tani to Cazic Thule, hoping to relive some of<br/>\nthe excitement of my early days.   &quot;26 Bard lookin&quot; got me a group with 3<br/>\nShadowknights.  Pretty damn good group actually for lizzies... lots of tank<br/>\npower, i just sat back and used instruments and healed and damage shielded<br/>\nand we didn&#39;t need much med time.  Until we pulled more than two...<br/>\n <br/>\nWe had 4 lizzies, protector, sent, 2 defenders... the puller calls<br/>\nprotector, I &quot;assume&quot; we&#39;re all assisting, and next thing I know I&#39;m being<br/>\nbeat on by the protector and am at 2 bubs of health.  I say &quot;Run?&quot; .. they<br/>\nsay &quot;No&quot;... so i hang in there another bubble.  At that point, I say, &quot;i&#39;m<br/>\nouta here&quot; and head to the zone, only to get whacked right before the line.<br/>\nHappens all the time, but the interesting thing is what happened next.<br/>\n <br/>\nMe: &quot;So um, you know that taunt button?&quot;<br/>\nPuller: &quot;If I taunt, they will hit me&quot;<br/>\nMe: &quot;Um, you&#39;re kinda a tank&quot;<br/>\nOther SK: &quot;But with that many lizzies, we&#39;ll die if we taunt&quot;<br/>\nMe: &quot;Um, I died.&quot;<br/>\nThird SK: &quot;Oh, I thought you zoned&quot;<br/>\nMe: &quot;Did you all zone&quot;<br/>\nPUller: &quot;yeah, we made it&quot;<br/>\nMe: &quot;Yes, I would be that smushed blue corpse you ran OVER on your way to<br/>\nthe zone&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nAll of a sudden my party disbanded...<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nI get back to the zone, pretty irate by now... and ask WTF happened.  They<br/>\nsaid &quot;Well, you just don&#39;t know how to play with Shadowknights.&quot;  I<br/>\nmentioned that regardless of anything, its in really poor form to ungroup<br/>\nsomeone on a corpse run.  <br/>\n <br/>\nAnyway, I dont&#39; know that I told that story well.  But i guess after reading<br/>\nthe &quot;bad mage&quot; thread, just wanted to point out that its never a bad class,<br/>\nits almost always bad players.  <br/>\n <br/>\nHally<br/>\nTani<br/>\nSolRo<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
