Glad you asked  <br/>\nA. Fewer folks than in Kelethin (at least on The Rathe)<br/>\nB. With the fewer folks, a lot of the other folks in the two zones we were<br/>\nin NOTICED the large number of bards (anything over 3) when doing /who.<br/>\nC. Less wandering MOBs to deal with.<br/>\nD. Can see farther  <br/>\nE. No &quot;E&quot;, but I just couldn&#39;t resist  <br/>\n<br/>\nTo give enough time for the news sites to get the info and post it (not to<br/>\nmention word-of-mouth), how about starting things off on the first server<br/>\n(alphabeticly) not this Saturday, but the next one?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=B=-<br/>\nCurrently On Strike<br/>\nThe Rathe <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOpinions, thoughts, hopes, dreams?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
