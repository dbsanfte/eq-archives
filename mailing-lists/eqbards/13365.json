Though don&#39;t feel too bad, I&#39;m sure we&#39;ve all dropped our MM drum<br/>\nor some other valuable weapon before.  Sucks that you couldn&#39;t find it though!<br/>\n<br/>\nI can certainly comisserate with you about jerks complaining about you &quot;hogging&quot; the giants.  I did this a<br/>\nlot between levels 30 and 32 (made a bunch of plat, and got real bored with it).  Generally I could get<br/>\npeople off my back by informing them how to get more giants to spawn.  There is the potential for WAY more<br/>\ngiants spawning than you can handle with charm.  I still remember the time I had 6 giants running after<br/>\nme.  I actually survived, getting credit for 4 of the 6 kills!  Of course, I still have to say, that my #1<br/>\nreason for dying while doing this is when other people (intentionally or unintentionally) run into the<br/>\nmiddle of the &quot;area&quot; I&#39;m charming in.  And I&#39;ve gotten very good at it, so that area is pretty small.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*snip*<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Anyhow, yesterday I was doing great - made about 400pp in 3<br/>\n&gt; hours.  Then while running, turning to avoid some other giant<br/>\n&gt; fighters, and switching to my weapons to finish off a giant<br/>\n&gt; with melee, I DROPPED MY MISTMOORE DRUM!!!  :(<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I spent 15 minutes looking for it afterwards (I killed the<br/>\n&gt; giant with one hit, so it turns out there wasn&#39;t even any need<br/>\n&gt; for me to have been running from it while switching to<br/>\n&gt; weapons).  Never found it, and I figured it had decayed by<br/>\n&gt; then.  :(  I realize now that I was looking for a bag on the<br/>\n&gt; ground when I should&#39;ve been looking for a small flute.<br/>\n&gt; Didn&#39;t help that it was nighttime either.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I feel so slow...  :(<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
