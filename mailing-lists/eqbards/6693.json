It&#39;s basically a<br/>\n&gt; last-ditch get-out-of-death-free tactic, to help them run for<br/>\n&gt; the zone.

He&#39;s a factor in the fight in that he can stand there being<br/>\nbeaten on for 30 seconds with out taking any damage while everyone else<br/>\nin the group can nuke or beat on the mob. Now granted, I have never seen<br/>\nanyone use this technique (and if it became popular and well known I<br/>\nwould be willing to bet Verant would nerf devine aura, assuming it was<br/>\neffective) but in a way it makes them the perfect tank for 30 seconds.<br/>\nThey can soak up huge amounts of damage without actually taking any.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe biggest problem with Bards at later levels, IMO is that most groups<br/>\n(at least on our server) go to item distribution based on need, rather<br/>\nthan the various schemes like alpha used by lower levels. I believe this<br/>\nis used on other servers as well. Unfortunately, as the Bard is known as<br/>\na mediocre fighter and inadequate tank at that point, and the weapons we<br/>\ncan use are all weapons multiple classes can use because we have no bard<br/>\nonly weapons, there will always be someone in the group who could use<br/>\nthe item more than the bard. Why would a group want to give the first<br/>\nYkesha they find to a bard, who can&#39;t double attack and thus won&#39;t be<br/>\nmaking as effective use of this special weapon as a warrior or ranger.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYes eventually your turn will come up, but with the super rare spawn<br/>\nstuff, that eventually can be an awfully long time, and at least for<br/>\nsome of us, like other classes in the game, part of the fun comes from<br/>\nhaving some unique things that make your character special in some way.<br/>\nHaving no weapons or armor that are unique pretty well leaves Bards out<br/>\nin the cold as far as that goes.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
