Hell in beta,<br/>\n&gt;   I owned that place.  Anyway, I started with a regular group in there<br/>\n&gt;   around L14.  I often found myself in there alone night after night.<br/>\n&gt;   I could not convince people to come, some people didn&#39;t even know<br/>\n&gt;   where or what permafrost was.  Around L19-L20, still working perma<br/>\n&gt;   I met a few people who are now (as of yesterday) L32.  Seven or<br/>\n&gt;   eight months ago they were my level (L19).  And now all of them call<br/>\n&gt;   me a &#39;powergamer&#39; telling me that I &#39;haven&#39;t enjoyed the game as<br/>\n&gt;   much as they have&#39;.  This is where about 10% of my daily humor<br/>\n&gt;   comes from, as it&#39;s worth a /chuckle.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Then and again, I get tells from people out of the blue when I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt;   in a zone about &#39;what does a L50 want in this zone?&#39;  I was passing<br/>\n&gt;   through Blackburrow the other day, and had just zoned in and I got<br/>\n&gt;   a tell from some L20 person asking me why I was there.  I could have,<br/>\n&gt;   without a doubt, asked him the same thing.  These same people also<br/>\n&gt;   are whining to me about &#39;how bored you must be to come into X zone<br/>\n&gt;   since you powerleveled to 50&#39;.  Doesn&#39;t everyone realize the only<br/>\n&gt;   way to the Icy North is via Blackburrow?  I thought as the server<br/>\n&gt;   populace had become more mature in information that things like that<br/>\n&gt;   would leak out.  Regardless this guy hounded me for being L50 in the<br/>\n&gt;   zone.  Time to break out Screech and ride a few trains to zone ;-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   /rant<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   I&#39;m bored as hell in EQ because I want some more quests or some<br/>\n&gt;   more challenges.  I don&#39;t consider giving a mob 10k more hp or an<br/>\n&gt;   attack which does 900 dmg challenging.  That&#39;s just frustrating.<br/>\n&gt;   One could argue there are new quests in the PoS, however I cannot<br/>\n&gt;   stroll up there anytime I want to work on them.  My boredom stems<br/>\n&gt;   mostly from lack of new things to experience.  If I wanted to talk<br/>\n&gt;   and chat all day, I&#39;d irc or something.  An integral part of my day<br/>\n&gt;   now consists of learning more mechanics.  I timed mana regain on<br/>\n&gt;   my druid medding, standing, and sitting not medding.  But that&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;   sorta boring too hehe.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   They&#39;ve pushed the expansion back a month.  What in the world have<br/>\n&gt;   they been doing?  All the excuses I hear on their behalf seem to<br/>\n&gt;   suggest they aren&#39;t doing much to the existing EQ, because they<br/>\n&gt;   are hard at work on the expansion.  While polygonal streams, and<br/>\n&gt;   better detailed texture maps on giants is cool and all, and while<br/>\n&gt;   making the trees 3d (finally) is neat, Verant needs better thought<br/>\n&gt;   out AI and zone pathing which could drastically improve the existing<br/>\n&gt;   game.  I&#39;m not holding my breath for the expansion in April.  It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;   going to be the same AI, the same poor pathing, the same mobs with<br/>\n&gt;   ac/hp/atk upgrades.  I&#39;m sick of goblins, I&#39;m sick of gnolls, the<br/>\n&gt;   planes are being tweaked so badly that people rarely even want to<br/>\n&gt;   go there anymore.  The 6 hours I spent in hateplane this weekend<br/>\n&gt;   yielded one warrior pants and one cleric shield.  Six f&#39;ing hours<br/>\n&gt;   over half the zone cleared, and two items.  Then the server crashes,<br/>\n&gt;   and the plane is reset.  Before that I linkdied 2 times because<br/>\n&gt;   of this constant network code upgrade they&#39;ve done.  My SBLive<br/>\n&gt;   desktop crashes only add to the annoyment.  Latest DirectX and<br/>\n&gt;   latest sbl drivers and I cast &#39;Ring of Desktop&#39; every day now<br/>\n&gt;   it seems.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   A GM once visited us in the Plane of Fear.  His words stick in my mind.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   -- &quot;It&#39;s all going downhill from here&quot; --<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   I&#39;ve yet to see that proven wrong since then.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Harmonic, the disillusioned.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; GET A NEXTCARD VISA, in 30 seconds.
