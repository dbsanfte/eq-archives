And I dont mean the occasional assist,<br/>\n  they sat around and were given all the exp they wanted.  If<br/>\n  I had L50s setting me up with that kinda of exp I&#39;d be 50<br/>\n  already.  No real glory in those two accomplishments.  I<br/>\n  admire their primary toons, but those twinks are nothing<br/>\n  to be much proud of imo.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
