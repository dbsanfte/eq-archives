What happens if you<br/>\ntarget a mob from a distance but the rest of your party is standing near the<br/>\nmob? Will they also take damage? <br/>\n<br/>\nGatin of E&#39;ci (who won&#39;t have to worry about this issue for quite some time)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; This song is a Rain type spell. Hence the green icon. This means you need<br/>\n&gt; to stand far off from<br/>\n&gt; your target, and then hit them with the song to avoid getting hit<br/>\n&gt; yourself. The song will then<br/>\n&gt; hit any mobs surrounding your target. It does up to 325 dmg to each<br/>\n&gt; target. It can hit up to 4<br/>\n&gt; targets I believe. It may not do max dmg most of the time, but it isnt<br/>\n&gt; resisted too often.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Maev Lorekeeper, L50<br/>\n&gt; Tarew Marr<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Jada wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Jada &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jadakost@...\">jadakost@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I am just about to recieve my level 43 song (Desperate<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Dirge) and had a few questions.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 1) Can this song still damage the singer?  or has this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; been fixed?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 2) Is the song a true area effect?  or do you need to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; target a single critter?  or can you target yourself<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to get AoE around you?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 3) How many critters can the song affect?  what type<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of damage is typical?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 4) Is this song resisted more, less, the same as other<br/>\n&gt; &gt; songs?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Along with these questions please add anything else<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you would like to say about the song.  I usually test<br/>\n&gt; &gt; out the songs myself, but seeing how it has such a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; LONG reload time that may prove to be difficult.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thanks in advance!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Jada MacAldred<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Bard of Povar<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; =====<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a> with the subject lol.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a><br/>\n&gt; with the subject lol. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
