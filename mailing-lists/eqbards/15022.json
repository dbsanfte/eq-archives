Given all of the other threads that have had at least some <br/>\nacknowledgement on Verant&#39;s part, this one certainly deserved one.  At the very <br/>\nleast, an &quot;oh, my, we&#39;ll check that out&quot;.  And while I agree that bumps are <br/>\nsomewhat cheap, they do indicate a serious interest on the part of the readership. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd how else are you supposed to respond if, in fact, you agree fully with what <br/>\nwas said, and have not yet seen a response of any sort from Verant?  This <br/>\nparticular thread had 200 responses as of the last time I checked.  That in and of <br/>\nitself should make them pay attention.  Too bad it hasn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantorforjado, 43 songs, Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\nPS - I&#39;m ashamed to admit it, but I never even tried to use Pixie Strike to mez <br/>\nextra MOBs until this past weekend.  (I know, whip me with a soggy noodle.)  Now <br/>\nthat I&#39;ve tried it, I have one comment:  this song stinks, too.  I&#39;m in Lower Guk, <br/>\nwe&#39;re fighting two froggies, a blue wiz comes through the door.  &quot;Don&#39;t worry, <br/>\nI&#39;ll mez it&quot;, I say.  Four Pixies later and no mez, I say &quot;Oh, forget it!&quot; and <br/>\nproceed to pound him.  I&#39;m just glad nobody died.  How embarrassing is that?  And <br/>\nthat was not an isolated example.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPeck White wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Peck White &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:PWhite@...\">PWhite@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; John&#39;s hard work and hard data should have elicited a response sans bumps<br/>\n&gt; IMHO.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Tom<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Perhaps a Princess...&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sarah@...\">sarah@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Note: Abashi is perfectly aware of the practice of bumping.
