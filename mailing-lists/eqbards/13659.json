Not knowing this lair,<br/>\nI chose instead to stand and stare.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe was big and blue,<br/>\nTruly an astounding view.<br/>\nI lasted several rounds,<br/>\nbut alas - too few.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\nBard of 42 songs<br/>\n&lt;The Pantheon&gt;<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk...<br/>\n<br/>\np.s. server reset yesterday afternoon (?) so my guild (The Pantheon on<br/>\nInnoruuk server) took a shot at Voxxy-woxxy.  And she went down!  2 hammers,<br/>\na crys spear, a mask.  We tried to pull her from the lair but she didn&#39;t<br/>\nwant to budge.  She summoned me to her side.  It was very amazing being the<br/>\nonly one in the Lair right next to her.  I scampered around and I think I<br/>\ngot some screen shots.  I did not feel like running into the pit so I kinda<br/>\ntried to hide and hope the others would come get her but after a few rounds,<br/>\nshe dispatched me to Rivervale.  Later, we were dividing up the loot and<br/>\njust finished when the zone crashed again (and re-popped.)  Had it not been<br/>\n3am, we would have killed her again.  Instead, GM and Guides came and<br/>\ncleared lair so we could do CR for those who got smooshed in the re-pop.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
