I<br/>\nhave at level 22 walked completely unmolested though Unrest mansion with it<br/>\nactive.  As soon as I dropped it I was attacked.  I have walked through<br/>\nbefallen with the same results.  I have no doubt that our clouding is a<br/>\nuniversal invisability and was intended as one, there for we do not need<br/>\ninvis vs undead.  I think the problem is that many of you who have had<br/>\ntroubles with this either had bad parties that broke the invis (wandered out<br/>\nof range, attacked, cast looted) at which point you also become visiable, or<br/>\nare trying to hide from undead levels much higher then you where it I guess<br/>\nresisted the song.  I personally would like to see a true mem blur song..<br/>\nexcept GZ and crew are more worried about enchanters and balancing us to be<br/>\nlesser the ever present curse of jack of all trades master of none motief,<br/>\nthen the actual usefulness of bards.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Adon Draigcanwyr 23 chorus of Povar<br/>\n&gt; Child of Cathar.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t buy into the theory that mobs get a saving throw to detect<br/>\ninvisibility.  If they can see invis, they see invis.  If they can&#39;t, and<br/>\nyou&#39;re wearing it, you&#39;re invis.  I&#39;ve walked unmolested thru the toes of<br/>\nIce Giants in Permafrost to recover a friends corpse at level 27.  I&#39;ve also<br/>\nbeen seen (unknowingly) and drew a train of undead to the Blood Pool in<br/>\nUnrest around the same level (can&#39;t think of any mob in the path that was<br/>\nmajor red to me).  I was the ONLY one in my group, and I assure you that I<br/>\ndid nothing to break invis.  There may be some invis to undead aspect to our<br/>\nsongs, but it&#39;s not because the mob gets a saving throw.<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkfox Reven&#39;tsol<br/>\nXegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
