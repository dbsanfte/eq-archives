I was going to use that<br/>\ninformation to fuel my argument that the EBW is one of the top 2 non planar<br/>\nweapons for a bard and that the same did not hold true for rogues.<br/>\n<br/>\nUpon searching the web, and talking here and in a few other forums I&#39;ve<br/>\nfound that rogues are basically in the same boat as we are weapon wise, and<br/>\nthat the EBW would be a fine off hand weapon for a rogue.<br/>\n<br/>\nDraelon<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Jeff Heskett [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tarkin@...\">tarkin@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, April 06, 2000 5:57 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] who are we?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\ni think he meant who are bards to tell a rogue 1hs is worthless to them.<br/>\n(and it wasn&#39;t preferential, it was a lotto from what i read.  the bard in<br/>\nthe group just felt rogues shouldn&#39;t get it) tho i could be wrong<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, April 06, 2000 1:26 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] who are we?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wed, 5 Apr 2000, Bill Costlow wrote:<br/>\n&gt; --- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s another thing to consider.
