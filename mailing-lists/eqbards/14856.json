I now have a couple of <br/>\n&gt; goals for the<br/>\n&gt; near term (it&#39;s much more fun to play when you have some objective). <br/>\n&gt; First I&#39;ll concentrate on getting level 8 (I&#39;m halfway there <br/>\n&gt; now), then<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ll head over to either Queynos or Kelethin (from Freeport) <br/>\n&gt; to get the<br/>\n&gt; Kelin&#39;s Lament song.  I&#39;ve travelled to Kelethin many times to sell<br/>\n&gt; small patchwork.  It&#39;s a pretty easy, but very boring, trip.  <br/>\n&gt; That boat<br/>\n&gt; trip is a killer.  First wait up to 20 minutes for the boat, then<br/>\n&gt; another 20 riding the boat.  What fun.  With Selo&#39;s is travelling to<br/>\n&gt; Queynos a better or worse plan?  I have maps, but I&#39;ve never actually<br/>\n&gt; made the trip.  I&#39;m only familiar with the area from West Karanas to<br/>\n&gt; Queynos.  I&#39;ve thought about doing a poor man&#39;s gate to get back.  Put<br/>\n&gt; all my stuff in the bank and then commit suicide.  (Isn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; reincarnation<br/>\n&gt; great?)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The boat ride is my time to practice skills. At your level, sense heading<br/>\nand fishing were the skills I practiced. I also chatted with others on the<br/>\ntrip or just went and got something to drink or read a newspaper or<br/>\nsomething if I didn&#39;t want to press keys.<br/>\n<br/>\nfishing can be done from a moving boat, but I find you have to move around<br/>\nand try casting from different spots. You&#39;ll get your fair share of messages<br/>\nsaying you can&#39;t, but it gave me something to do. Also, if you have a<br/>\nmusical skill that isn&#39;t maxed out, it&#39;s a good time to practice.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Once I have lament, I&#39;ll try to join some orc camping parties in East<br/>\n&gt; Commonlands.  I joined my first party a couple of nights ago and had a<br/>\n&gt; blast, although I died a lot.  I got the distinct feeling <br/>\n&gt; that the orcs<br/>\n&gt; hated me the most when I had my drum equipped, whether I was <br/>\n&gt; playing or<br/>\n&gt; not.  Perhaps it was just my imagination or a conincidence.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Now the hard thing will be balancing the need to save money for a<br/>\n&gt; combine weapon and using money to build up my smithing skills (lvl 43<br/>\n&gt; right now).  I really want to be a master smith too, which is why I<br/>\n&gt; chose to start in Freeport.  I think I&#39;ll go the route of the smith,<br/>\n&gt; then once I can make/sell banded I can buy the combine weapon.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The trade skills are pretty much a money sink, except for, perhaps<br/>\njewelcraft.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve put in hundreds of pp in smithing to get to the point where I can make<br/>\nbanded reliably. 50 pp doesn&#39;t go far into training to make armor. There&#39;s<br/>\nalso not a huge demand for banded anymore on my server, Bertox.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d recommend saving your money and use it towards the combine sword. You&#39;ll<br/>\nget the sword much faster just saving the money then trying to make banded.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, if money is not a goal, then trade skills are a way to role play a<br/>\nbit more. I can&#39;t say learning the trade is all that fun and is downright<br/>\nboring.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Windleaf</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
