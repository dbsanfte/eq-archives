It was certainly not a shark. Yet when I swam to where it was, there<br/>\nwas nothing there (I was to dumb or dumbfounded to /con it). I have asked<br/>\nmany if they had seen one, but people kept saying that there are none in the<br/>\ngame. While I have yet to go all &quot;Ahab&quot; and devote my life to hunting one<br/>\ndown, it is nice to hear I am not alone in this rare sighting.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, has anyone ever swam to the bottom of the lake in West Commonlands? I<br/>\nswam to the bottom and was teleported to the zone wall it shares with East<br/>\nCommonlands. The text sayed that I was being moved to a safe place or<br/>\nsomething like that. It has happened repeatedly and I swear that I saw<br/>\nsomething down there too, though, alas I do not recall the /loc of the<br/>\nobject.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis list is a wonderful source of information, but it took another mermaid<br/>\nsighting to get me to leave Lurkerville.<br/>\n<br/>\nCleaver<br/>\nFennin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nLooking to expand your world?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nONElist has over 165,000 e-mail communities from which to choose!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
