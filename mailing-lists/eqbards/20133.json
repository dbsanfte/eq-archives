That was very<br/>\nsatisfying.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, I have been plotting (well actually they replaced the plotter with<br/>\na schemer, so mostly scheming) one for my Newbie project bard, here is what<br/>\nI know mixed with some theory.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a busy night you can get to the bedroom and hang with the BR group<br/>\n(making it more likely that you will get grieves). It is hard to see on the<br/>\nmaps but you have to *swim* to the BR, get that swimming up first, your life<br/>\nwill most likely depend on it. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no possible way to continue without Invis and Invis to Undead. The<br/>\nbats and skellies will eat your lunch. Your invis will probably not cut it<br/>\neither, which means you are going to have to offer to buy both of those from<br/>\na tolerant cleric. Why tolerant? I think that folks near the zone get a bit<br/>\ntired of newbies making runs for nodrop stuff. So you have to make it<br/>\nsomething they WANT to do, which means money or (if you are lucky and a<br/>\nshowman) entertainment. Money is your best bet. With the price of potions<br/>\ncoming down Invis to Undead potions might be a good buy.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext, make SURE that the BR and ass sup (assassin/supplier) are very camped.<br/>\nI poped up in the BR one night to see it empty of all but Undead<br/>\nFrogluks...I have NO idea how at 6 and *swimming* I lived. Next, *wait* for<br/>\na camp check (people get SO tired of them that a beggar generating one will<br/>\nnot make you friends) and ask the person who replies &quot;ass sup&quot; if they would<br/>\nmind you looting the mask. Drink your potions/get your spells and go. You<br/>\ncan&#39;t see on a map that it is up a ladder. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, cower behind some barrels trying hard to look like an inanimate object.<br/>\n<br/>\nBe aware that the group could get into trouble and evac. Also you could get<br/>\nthe mask and then no one in the group might want to or  be able to invis to<br/>\nundead you. Both paths lead to dead bard with a terrible Corpse Retrieval<br/>\nproblem. Potions are starting to sound better and better. :o)<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck to you!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTszaaz<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
