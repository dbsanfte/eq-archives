It&#39;s just<br/>\n  not a good habit of getting into.  It was fun to Lullaby things when<br/>\n  you were L15, it was cute to play binding at L20, hell at L48 I got<br/>\n  a kick out of that song too, until I got stomped into the ground.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Songs either just don&#39;t keep up or are decreased in power so that<br/>\n  they just aren&#39;t effective to use once you exceed the song level.<br/>\n  We may be able to DDD/COD PCs in a duel and blue NPCs around L25,<br/>\n  but above L35 if you try any of that junk you&#39;ll get kicked in the<br/>\n  junk ;-)  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
