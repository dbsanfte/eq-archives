How do I get there?  Is there a secret way (i.e. through the secret room in the graveyard) which could be less hazardous to a group of around 30&#39;s? (I too share Shada&#39;s propensity for being lost - hehe.  My train hotkey shouts &quot;TRAIN TO......UM......Just watch out!&quot;)  Once I get to said room, how difficult a place is it?  3 spawns, 4?<br/>\n<br/>\n2)  Where are Choon and Froon (I&#39;ve spent the vast majority of my time on the East coast, so I&#39;m not too familiar with the Karanas)?  About what level are they?  Is it possible to pull one without the other?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd in another non-related vein:<br/>\n<br/>\nCan anyone please post or supply the web address to a comprehensive list of Bard skill caps?  And once more, where do you have to go to train that first point in Instill Doubt?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks ahead of time for all the help,<br/>\n<br/>\nWeiland<br/>\n&lt;Disciples of Truth&gt;<br/>\nErollisi Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
