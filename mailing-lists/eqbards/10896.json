No Drop solves absolutely nothing.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No level 50 wizard camps lambent armor drops to sell these items to<br/>\nbards.  Before you had everyone and their mom selling rubi armor,<br/>\neven those that could not use it had it for sale.  The no drop means if<br/>\nyou do loot, you have to complete the quest, which means leave this<br/>\nspawn, while i move in and get the item myself.  or you just have to <br/>\nloot and destroy the quest items until the bard hands over money.<br/>\nI don&#39;t think many of us are so rude to do #2, and #1 doesn&#39;t work,<br/>\nThus my bard is able to travel around, get his quest items camp-free<br/>\nand enjoy his items.  I repeat, No one is off selling lambent armor<br/>\nparts for any kind of price at all, and people selling the lambent<br/>\narmor can&#39;t sell it for the obscene prices that items like gator legs<br/>\ngo for simply because the quest/no drop quest item system works!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt does not stop the level 50 from twinking his newbie, it does stop<br/>\nthe &quot;rubicite/jboots is always camped&quot; complaints that we see.  It<br/>\nworked for what Verant wanted it to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
