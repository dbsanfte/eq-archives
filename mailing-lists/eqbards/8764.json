This was evident because I<br/>\nheard that people who can track her often see her name as !Genni which<br/>\nsignifies a broken NPC.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTreilanin Loreweaver<br/>\nHonour Guard, Karana<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Fri, 15 Oct 1999, John Robertson wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: John Robertson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:johnr@...\">johnr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ryan Honeyman wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Ryan Honeyman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:slasher@...\">slasher@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Genni is definately in the temple, I don&#39;t remember the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;location, but I was able to deal with him.

Has anyone else noticed that the keepers<br/>\n&gt; &gt; change race/sex fairly often?  Freaky.  Maybe they just<br/>\n&gt; &gt; rotate around the Temple.  Genni definitely stays female<br/>\n&gt; &gt; erudite. =)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hmmm.  I&#39;ve spent about 2 hours looking for Genni, both times with other<br/>\n&gt; bards there as well, and none of us found Genni on Karana.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Apparently, she CAN be tracked, but nobody has found her through<br/>\n&gt; tracking either.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; She wasn&#39;t near Ostorm either.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Maybe I&#39;m just really dumb, but more likely she&#39;s stuck in a wall or<br/>\n&gt; something on Karana.
