Especially 7 months after the game.

It was inevitable.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The truth is this list is very reflective of the state of the game.<br/>\n  We are all grown up now.  I came here when I was L20, that was a long<br/>\n  time ago.  I&#39;ve learned a lot here, made a lot of friends, pissed <br/>\n  off a lot of people, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Everyone has opinions.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Every server is being aflicted by a power guild(s) taking over the <br/>\n  things that 90% of the rest of the server would like to do.  This<br/>\n  in every way affects Bards... and Enchanters, and Warriors, and etc.<br/>\n  In the past this list has proposed solutions to non-bard questions,<br/>\n  thus is the nature of the list to investigate and solve problems.<br/>\n  I can guarentee that this list distributes more in-game mechanics<br/>\n  than any of list out there.  But more than that, it distributes <br/>\n  a fun and cheerful attitude.  As bards, we know a little bit about<br/>\n  everything, justly so.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The hot topic of elite guilds taking over the server is something <br/>\n  which needs to addressed, as it impacts all of us.<br/>\n<br/>\n  It&#39;s not:   What &lt;foo&gt; instrument has &lt;foo&gt; effect.<br/>\n<br/>\n  But how much more can we talk about songs and instruments?  There<br/>\n  is nothing new to discuss.  Until a patch or new song/skill, that <br/>\n  is.  I&#39;ve also found people here have a very solid understanding<br/>\n  of the game as a whole and it&#39;s playability.  So, maybe a new <br/>\n  list needs to be created to voice out playability issues to other<br/>\n  people of similiar or like minds, but I find you all to be the<br/>\n  first place to turn to for _any_ eq advice.<br/>\n<br/>\n  We all share a common thread, but that common thread is storytelling,<br/>\n  general advice, and not just when selo&#39;s outruns sow, or why X song<br/>\n  isn&#39;t working right.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Again I apologize for the post, however this problem is plaguing<br/>\n  the community as a whole and wanted to make the bard community,<br/>\n  at least, aware of it&#39;s strain on some of us.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
