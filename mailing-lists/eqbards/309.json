The other<br/>\nnight, though, I tried it without an instrument, and it worked!  I want to test<br/>\nit out to see what the difference is between instrument and no instrument and<br/>\ncompare it to Chords.  I&#39;ll try to do that tonight.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne other thing I noticed, it seems to have a smaller area of effect than Chords<br/>\nof Dissonance, which is a GOOD thing.  It reaches far enough to make the things<br/>\nswarming you wince, but not far enough to pull the whole zone down atop you.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for posting the song descriptions, it&#39;s a good list.<br/>\n<br/>\nJyzan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
