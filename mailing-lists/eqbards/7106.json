It was my first post to the list and I thought I had a legitimate issue and was very happy to read the varied opinions from the list members. Some of the opinions and play styles differ from mine. That&#39;s cool. I can understand their motivations and now I am better for it. Maybe my future party members may be better for it as well. That doesn&#39;t sound much like a troll to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nBack to lurk mode where nobody knows your name.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeledal<br/>\nBard of Erollisi Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Elijah Meeker&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elijah@...\">elijah@...</a>&gt; 09/23 1:42 PM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>From: &quot;Elijah Meeker&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elijah@...\">elijah@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; the long run back.

Clearly good<br/>\naligned characters being bound in evil cities is absurd. Monks could sneak<br/>\nit at one point great. All the danger tolerance level in the world doesn&#39;t<br/>\nmake it s SMART thing to do (as outlined by John, the hours lost due to<br/>\ndeath don&#39;t make up for the running time). No amount of machismo makes the<br/>\nargument make any sense at all. I would suggest we not fuel the trolls fun<br/>\nany longer.<br/>\n<br/>\nTszaaz E&#39;Taurguin</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
