You know - just like Jody Foster in the movie Contact!  A satellite in Puerto Rico has captured radio waves and they need computers to analyze the data for signs of intelligence via radio transmissions.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Unless you have a REALLY fast computer - you will set it up as a screen saver - so it will only kick in when you&#39;re not using your computer.  When it&#39;s done calculating - it will connect to the Internet, upload the results and download new data for your machine to analyze.  The analysis is quite time-consuming.  On my 300 MHz Machine it took 73 hours 35 minutes to complete a unit of work.  There are version for both Windows and Macs (and Unix and Linux and a  bunch of others).<br/>\n<br/>\n    Anyway - unless you REALLY need a cool snazzy looking Screen saver that you paid a lot of bucks for - you can participate in an exciting research project at no cost to you. If you use your computer a lot like I do - it&#39;s really better just to leave it on all the time (newer machines have power saving features such as shutting your C Drive down for example) and this will really help the project as it will run while you are doing things like sleeping or are at work...<br/>\n<br/>\n    To Download and get more info check out <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu\">http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu</a><br/>\n<br/>\nDanny Sniderman</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
