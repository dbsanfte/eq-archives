Well I just though I would throw some info into the idea bank for you.  One of my characters is a 27th level Wizard.

Up til about level 17 I&#39;d say<br/>\n&gt;&gt;their use is minor.  At 17 you get Guardian Rhythms which<br/>\n&gt;&gt;stacks with the other two Rhythm songs (those two don&#39;t stack<br/>\n&gt;&gt;with each other).  With a drum and playing Guardian and<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Elemental Rhythms, you should be able to get your party&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;&gt;magic resist up over 75.  If a caster buffs everyone with<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Endure Magic, that should be close to 100.  *Nobody* can raise<br/>\n&gt;&gt;magic resist like a bard can.  As far as I know, the best<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Endure Magic spell only increases it by 30 points.  At level<br/>\n&gt;&gt;29 with a battle drum, I can raise it by close to 80 points.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;&gt;John H.

When i<br/>\n&gt;alternate guardian and mystic shield with the drums i get my own mr over 190. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Gendal Concorden, lvl 48 bard of Tunare<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well I just though I would throw some info into the idea bank for you.  One<br/>\nof my characters is a 27th level Wizard. (BTW I love the clearity song)<br/>\nAnyway, when I am bord and have nothing to do I work on training my<br/>\nevocation specialization.  I simply cast the first level Shock of Frost<br/>\nspell on myself (other players if there are any around)  It does a max of 6<br/>\ndamage to me (non to other players because I am not dueling them).<br/>\nGenerally I gain a point in specialization about every bubbel of mana or two.<br/>\nBut I digress, the point of this was to let you know that I have cast a<br/>\ncrap load of low level spells on myself.  Now granted I only have about 50<br/>\n- 80 MR (depending on the buffs on me) I think I have only resisted my own<br/>\nspell about 1 time in 100 castings.  I know my MR is a far cry from 113 or<br/>\neven 190.  But, it seemes to me that your chance of totally resisting a<br/>\nspell are probably based more on the level of the casting creature.  I<br/>\nthink MR as well as Cold and Heat Resistance only let you take less damage<br/>\nfrom the spell.<br/>\nThough even with my 60 cold resistance I always seem to do 6 damage to myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo in conclusion I think your level has to do with totally resisting spells<br/>\nbut your other resistances have to do with partial resistance to damage spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps someone.<br/>\n<br/>\nLomack, Knight Defender of the BCK<br/>\nMaster of Recruiting<br/>\nwww.bck.org<br/>\n&quot;The Crimson Knights&quot;<br/>\nFennin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
