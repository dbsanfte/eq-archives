I can be inside the zone about 30<br/>\nminutes before I have a random mob attack me from nowhere, whether I&#39;m<br/>\nplaying a song or not and no matter which songs I&#39;ve played in the zone.  I<br/>\nhaven&#39;t seen this in any other zone, and thankfully they&#39;ve always come when<br/>\nwe were ready to pull anyway so it saved us some work.  It&#39;s a weird<br/>\nphenomenon that I have yet to understand.  If anyone has any clues about<br/>\nthis I would appreciate it, I hope to be going back there next week to<br/>\ntackle the basement.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnthem Dirgemaker<br/>\n24th level Bard of Qeynos<br/>\nSolusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:silky@...\">silky@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:silky@...\">silky@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, July 05, 1999 3:58 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqbards] Bards and Mob Hate<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:silky@...\">silky@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ok, I&#39;ve read a lot on this list about how badly the critters hate us,<br/>\n&gt; never really experienced it till last night.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I expected it to come from me healing my group - the way it happened was a<br/>\n&gt; bit of a surprise.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I was showing the group I was with what twisting guardian and protective<br/>\n&gt; rythms did for their resistance with a drum, and good god - every greater,<br/>\n&gt; db and barbed skele on our side of unrest was making a beeline for ME!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We probably could have handled it had I known the reaction was gonna be<br/>\n&gt; like that, and I sure as heck would have run quicker -<br/>\n&gt; thankfully, I am the<br/>\n&gt; only one that died.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I was only affecting my group - these things came from out of<br/>\n&gt; NOWHERE - why<br/>\n&gt; would this act like such a magnet?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyway - I think I&#39;m gonna get a really good group together (one that can<br/>\n&gt; handle that kind of heat) - and do it purposefully (a little less<br/>\n&gt; long) and<br/>\n&gt; we won&#39;t need to debate on who the puller is anymore - looks like I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; nominated as bait.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Check out this week&#39;s ONElist of the week.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; How is ONElist changing YOUR life?
