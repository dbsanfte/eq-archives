I mean, I know Wizards and Druids have<br/>\n&gt; their nifty traveling spells, and of course, Gate has it&#39;s uses, but let&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; face it - isn&#39;t there joy in watching the ground sail beneath your feet,<br/>\n&gt; knowing that you aren&#39;t limited by a set of coordinates to where you can<br/>\n&gt; go?  The freedom to explore that REALLY dangerous place, knowing you can<br/>\n&gt; outrun *almost* anything?
