Last night, while I was invisible, I used instill<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; doubt on a dark elf seargant in Nektulos.  He gave the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; standard wood-elves-must-die cry, then said he was hit by 1<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; point of non-melee damage, followed immediately by a message<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; saying I&#39;d kicked him.  Then he ran away (due to the skill<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; working).  Huh?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Wow, I am REALLY impressed.  I have pressed this button <br/>\n&gt; hundreds of times...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; maybe thousands, and NEVER had it work.  I *have* <br/>\n&gt; experienced the kick thing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; though.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve had it work twice in combat (once while the mob was<br/>\n&gt; snared, another when it wasn&#39;t and my party rightfully berated<br/>\n&gt; me for scaring off the mob), and once on that dark elf.  It<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t work often, but it does work.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Never begged, so i can&#39;t comment.  When you beg from a mage <br/>\n&gt; pet... does it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; give you anything?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have yet to succeed at it, as my skill is only 1.  :-)  I<br/>\n&gt; did get that 1 point on a failure, so skill gain does not seem<br/>\n&gt; to be success-based.  I just thought some of the NPC behavior<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d seen after begging was odd.  Hmm, I have 104 skill points<br/>\n&gt; sitting unused.  Maybe I&#39;ll dump some into begging...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I believe that sneak works for other classes (monk and <br/>\n&gt; bard) but only rogues<br/>\n&gt; &gt; get the success and failure messages associated with it.  <br/>\n&gt; Given the bard&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; very low sneak scores, it&#39;s possible that you&#39;re just <br/>\n&gt; failing your sneak all<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the time, rather than the skill not working.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; No, I was succeeding.  I tested it by seeing how slowly I was<br/>\n&gt; moving.  I&#39;m curious how they&#39;ve implemented it if it&#39;s not<br/>\n&gt; based on factions.  Maybe it&#39;s based on aggro radius?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Another thing I should check is if we can do the hide-sneak<br/>\n&gt; combo that rogues get.  I&#39;ve heard only rogues can do this,<br/>\n&gt; but I have to wonder if people just say that because only<br/>\n&gt; rogues have a high enough hide/sneak cap to pull it off<br/>\n&gt; consistently.  (If you don&#39;t know what I&#39;m talking about, if a<br/>\n&gt; rogue successfully hides, then successfully sneaks, he can<br/>\n&gt; move while hidden.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; By the way, playing around with these useless skills does make<br/>\n&gt; time on the boat pass more quickly.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
