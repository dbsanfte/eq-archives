I had a<br/>\n&gt;100 agility and an AC of around 200 or so when I got my first agility<br/>\n&gt;boosting item.  Going from 100 to 102 with no attached AC bumped my AC up <br/>\n&gt;by<br/>\n&gt;9 points.  Not sure if there are bonuses at points past 101, but I would<br/>\n&gt;imagine they get spread out at that point.
