Roots just weren&#39;t<br/>\nenough to keep the gobbies from fleeing and causing trains as trying to kill<br/>\nthe rooted goblins usually ended up freeing them too quickly.  If the &#39;real&#39;<br/>\nreason they made Acellerando not work indoors because of trains, why don&#39;t<br/>\nthe goblins get changed so they don&#39;t cause trains?  One bad party causes<br/>\nfar more trains than a bard with Acellerando ever would.  Anyhow, from my<br/>\nexperience no ranger = no Sol A or Guk until your bard is 23rd minimum.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhenders@...\">jhenders@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhenders@...\">jhenders@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, January 24, 2000 3:04 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] PoA bard quests plus a rant<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhenders@...\">jhenders@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mon, Jan 24/00, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There is a ton of stuff out there in the L20-40 range that<br/>\n&gt; most people don&#39;t fight, either out of ignorance or fear.
