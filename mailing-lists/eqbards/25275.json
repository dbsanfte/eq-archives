We had I think 9<br/>\nconsecutive<br/>\nVox kills with only 1 white scale dropped.  It&#39;s been rough on MM ;p.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy guild, Deadly Virtues, took the spawned Trakanon down with no problems;<br/>\nour<br/>\nfirst Trak kill (like may other servers, it&#39;s difficult to find him up to<br/>\nkill!).  We had deaths, but learned a lot so that next time will be much<br/>\neasier.<br/>\n <br/>\nI am thrilled with the sword!  I think that the effort for our epic is<br/>\nproportional to its quality.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wanted to share this with you all, with a hearty &#39;Thank you&#39; because so<br/>\nmuch<br/>\nwork has been done by the community, of which we are all a part.<br/>\n<br/>\n/cheer bards<br/>\n<br/>\nMaravana Vireo<br/>\n59 Bard of Deadly Virtues<br/>\nMithaniel Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nMake international calls for as low as $.04/minute with Yahoo!
