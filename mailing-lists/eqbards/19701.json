The reason being that all intruments require two hands<br/>\nto play.  There&#39;s been some (non-official) discussion about giving Bards an<br/>\nintrument that we can bash with while playing a song, but that seems<br/>\nunlikely to come to fruition.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 15th, like you, I spent most of my time in Crushbone.  I started<br/>\nbranching out to Unrest and further afield to Oasis at about 17.<br/>\n<br/>\nA note on grouping/soloing:  I had limited play time through my early 20&#39;s<br/>\nand as such tended to solo a lot.  Many people have said that you can&#39;t solo<br/>\neffectively through your early-mid 20&#39;s, but it was the mainstay of my<br/>\nexperience.  I&#39;m now at 26 and have a lil more time on my hands so I get to<br/>\ngroup more often.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 17, when you get Dual Wield, melee gets better, but pick your targets<br/>\ncarefully - high blues may still cause you problems; the mobs may con blue,<br/>\nbut you can&#39;t match their damage without some good song twists (Thulian<br/>\nClaws and the Silver War Axe is an excellent combination, btw.)  Once you<br/>\nget to your 20&#39;s, I would recommend the Lake of Ill Omen and the Swamp of No<br/>\nHope (where I completely solo&#39;d Frogloks, Man Eating Plants and Bloodwings<br/>\nthrough 22-24.)  Soloing gets pretty monotonous after a while but it is<br/>\npossible.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you do get in a group your focus of attention should be buffing your<br/>\ngroup (Chant or Anthem for the tanks, Ryhthms for tanks + casters), healing<br/>\nif you don&#39;t have a cleric or other to hand and debuffing the mob.  Melee<br/>\nwhen you&#39;re running short of tanks.  If you get multiple pulls and don&#39;t<br/>\nhave anyone to mes, switch to an AE DD to start whittling down their health<br/>\nor play Melodic Binding (when you get it) to slow their attacks and reduce<br/>\ntheir AC.  Lullaby is a lost cause at the moment as the ubertaunt will most<br/>\nlikely result in the mobs beating on you.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 27, the world becomes shiny and new (so I&#39;ve been told) with the<br/>\nintroduction of Charm.  Our 23 song (Selo&#39;s Consonant Chains) has been<br/>\nfiddled with recently and no longer snares as effectively as before.  This<br/>\nmakes the previously wonderful fear/chains kiting a royal pain in the<br/>\nhiney... I got 26 a couple of days after the patch went in... oh, how I<br/>\nwept. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nSay Hi sometime if you see me on Bertoxx.  I&#39;ll be more than happy to answer<br/>\nany of your questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nOut of interest, how many Bards from the Big Busy B do we have lurking here?<br/>\n<br/>\nKyrisha Soerbaird<br/>\nBertoxxulous</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
