","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1077798342\">Forage is not useful?!!!  Please!  I&#39;ve heard several<br/>\npeople complain about this in this thread.  I never<br/>\nhave to buy food!  I think that is extremely useful. <br/>\nGranted, once you get to higher levels it isn&#39;t like<br/>\nfood is some huge expense.  But it is something you<br/>\nhave to remember to buy if you are a class without<br/>\nforage capabilities.  Me?  I just click forage when I<br/>\nremember and there is food.  Heck, it probably works<br/>\nless than 50% of the time but it definitely produces a<br/>\nbig enough stream of food to keep my supplies up.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThex Luteslinger<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Message: 1<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Wed, 10 Nov 1999 12:46:44 -0600<br/>\n&gt;    From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:silky@...\">silky@...</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: Special foraged foods<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think that&#39;s the major complaint - we get all<br/>\n&gt; these neato &#39;other&#39; class<br/>\n&gt; skills - but our caps are so low - it makes you<br/>\n&gt; wonder why they bothered? I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t necessarily want to track as good as a ranger,<br/>\n&gt; or forage - but I<br/>\n&gt; WOULD like to be able to have the thing be useful.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   The other thought i have to add here is that like<br/>\n&gt; tracking<br/>\n&gt; &gt;for druids...its a special skill.  we get it at a<br/>\n&gt; level and it never<br/>\n&gt; &gt;advances..it caps at 20 and when we get it that is<br/>\n&gt; the skill we get it<br/>\n&gt; &gt;at.  Is it possible that bards get forage and its<br/>\n&gt; at skill lvl 40 when<br/>\n&gt; &gt;we get it.  Just a thought...  oh yeah and skill<br/>\n&gt; cap for druids is 200<br/>\n&gt; &gt;i believe<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>=====</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
