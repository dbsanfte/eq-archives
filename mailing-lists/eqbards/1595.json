I asked a <br/>\nperson that killed the musician if it was a lore item or magical or <br/>\nanything, but as far as he could tell, it was neither.  it has the same wt <br/>\n0.5 as a regular drum, so I am curious to know if it improves songs any when <br/>\nused with songs.  Since it was off a named mob, the guy did not want to sell <br/>\nit to me just yet, because no one knew the worth.  anyone know about this?<br/>\n<br/>\nLearic Lovejam of Xegony.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
