The issue was the GM driven &quot;Test<br/>\nof&quot; events going on.  Apparently the only people who can win the events are<br/>\nthe level 50+ folks.  Kitasi and I were both agreeing that GM events should<br/>\nbe geared towards a specific level range.  For example, if there is a GM<br/>\nevent in GFay, which is a low level zone, then the only people eligible to<br/>\nparticipate and receive any potential reward are those people in the level<br/>\nrange the zone was designed for.  But Verant doesn&#39;t do this.  If they hold<br/>\nan event in GFay the entire zone will be full of level 50s trying to kill<br/>\nthe GM controlled mobs.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a perfect world GM events would be focused on roleplaying and not killing<br/>\nthe GM controlled mobs.  To my knowledge this has only happened once on E&#39;ci<br/>\n(Chula the cleric got the Butcherblock Hammer (artifact) as a reward when<br/>\nthe GMs voted he roleplayed better than anyone else participating).<br/>\n<br/>\nIMO, the only proper way to &quot;Test&quot; a bard is to judge him/her on their<br/>\nstorytelling and/or roleplaying capability.  At 50+ level almost every bard<br/>\nwill have similar equipment, similar skills, and the same songs.  Stats<br/>\ndon&#39;t mean much so there isn&#39;t much to differentiate us with another bard<br/>\nexcept our weaving skills and roleplaying ability.  I&#39;m only 37th level but<br/>\nam fairly confident I know more about playing a bard than some of the 50+<br/>\nbards on my server.  I can safely say this because I&#39;ve been subscribing to<br/>\nthis list for over a year.  There are a lot of 50+ bards that never read<br/>\nthis list or the Concert Hall board.  I try to roleplay as much as possible.<br/>\nBut as it stands right now, even though I know my class like the back of my<br/>\nhand, I can&#39;t compete on my server for this Test because I&#39;m not high enough<br/>\nlevel.  Thats what I don&#39;t agree with.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Jeffrey Sue [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jsue@...\">jsue@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, June 06, 2000 10:51 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Test of ...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 07:15 PM 6/6/00 +0000, Reece, Tom CPT- 25IDL G4 wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;But that would violate The Vision(tm).
