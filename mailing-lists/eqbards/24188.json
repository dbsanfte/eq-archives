Why don&#39;t you wait <br/>\nfor someone to make a suggestion of what they think would make the <br/>\nsong useful, then you can rip apart the reasons why it would make us <br/>\noverpowered in a non-uber raid environment.  You already started the <br/>\nball rolling with your suggestion of 1500 dd, castable every 3 <br/>\nseconds.  Nice practice.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost people are saying that they would never, that&#39;s NOT EVER, mem <br/>\nthis song in ANY circumstance.  When we get to the &quot;Why?&quot;, the <br/>\nanswers are, <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Takes too much mana, so I can&#39;t charm.&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Takes too much mana, so the recast is way too long.&quot;<br/>\n&quot;The damage it does is pitiful, especially when you look at the mob <br/>\nscaling between 50 and 60.&quot;<br/>\n&quot;It&#39;s AE, and I&#39;d NEVER use an AE song.. The Chanter would kill me.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, my question is... &quot;What would have to change in order to justify <br/>\nmemming this song?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not talking about it turning into the primary song every Bard <br/>\nplays from 43 to 60.  I&#39;m talking about it becoming useful.. <br/>\noccasionally, every once in awhile, rarely... something more than NOT <br/>\nEVER.<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkfox</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
