I try to stick them with it right<br/>\naway and a couple times.  Lower their MR so they resist the other songs<br/>\nless.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am with druids a good bit and rangers too - have not heard them comment<br/>\nthat nerfs anything that they do DoT-wise.  Was just wondering if any thing<br/>\nwas known.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy next thing to try is a series of song that can be drum enhanced.  Say<br/>\nAnthem, Purifying, Curtailing.  This I think could be a good combo against<br/>\nthe Kith undead when you have 2 or 3 other melee-er&#39;s in your party.  If you<br/>\nhave good MR and sv Disease buffs already, then Chant, Warmth, Curtailing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I have been thinking about varying the songs used throughout the<br/>\nfight.  Open with: Anthem, Purifying, Guardian.  Let the mob get engaged<br/>\nwith tanks.  When the mob is getting stunned and bashed and I see<br/>\ninteruptions switch to: Chant, Warmth, Curtailing.  When the mob is going<br/>\ndown and turns to run: Chains, Anthem, Bellow. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo that&#39;s 7 songs?  Anthem, Purifying, Guardian, Chant, Warmth, Curtailing,<br/>\nChains & Bellow.  Nope 8. Hmmm, have to drop one to make room for Clarity.<br/>\nI guess it would be Bellow or Curtailing. Need to keep the one that is<br/>\nresisted less.  Bellow would do 18 dmg in one series of song while<br/>\nCurtailing should do 40? <br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Rokenn Swiftsong [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rokenn@...\">rokenn@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, November 10, 1999 6:56 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] more sylly questions<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Specifically, does Fulfils Curtailing NOT stack with any songs or other<br/>\n&gt;spells other players cast.
