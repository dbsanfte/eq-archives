Any bard, no matter if high level or low level, who was so inclined<br/>\ncould easily have learned as much as they wanted to about the bard class.  But<br/>\nsadly since most of them don&#39;t subscribe to this list that means those of us who<br/>\ndo have to continually educate our groups on what we can do for the group.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I agree that there are situations where it is appropriate to play as a<br/>\nbattle bard.  But there are situations where it isn&#39;t.  Those that only know how<br/>\nto play as battle bards will find it hard to adapt to those specific situations<br/>\nso therefore can give other classes a bad impression of the bard class.  Those<br/>\nthat do know how to adapt will amaze their group, establish a reputation as a<br/>\ngood bard, and usually have no problems finding a group to join.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Cheryl Kiraly [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cheryl@...\">cheryl@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, June 26, 2000 12:48 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] grouping thread on the Everquest boards<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  But I really can&#39;t blame some of the higher level bards for not toally<br/>\nknowing what something may do.
