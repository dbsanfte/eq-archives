It mainly maxxes out because I make frequent<br/>\njourneys into places like Permafrost with my 50th level ogre shaman, 50<br/>\nlevel half-elf bard, and 39th level druid for items. Don&#39;t get any<br/>\nexperience but those skill points sure add up fighting all those things that<br/>\nare just barely red to me.<br/>\n\tBefore this, however, I&#39;ve never really had a problem keeping these maxxed<br/>\nexcept for when I kited aviaks for a few levels. I think that these skills<br/>\nare linked to Agility or Dexterity (could be wrong, don&#39;t kill please) so<br/>\nmaybe getting some items to boost those stats might help. Mine is boosted to<br/>\n100 and 124 respectively.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tGood Journey,<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tSineras Silverlyre (Cazic-Thule)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n8)-----Original Message-----<br/>\n8)From: Jukeboxie the Bard [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jukeboxie@...\">jukeboxie@...</a>]<br/>\n8)Sent: Sunday, September 05, 1999 11:55 PM<br/>\n8)To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n8)Subject: [eqbards] offense and defense caps<br/>\n8)<br/>\n8)<br/>\n8)From: &quot;Jukeboxie the Bard&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jukeboxie@...\">jukeboxie@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n8)<br/>\n8)Has anyone on this list ever, ever had their offense or<br/>\n8)defense capped for<br/>\n8)their level?
