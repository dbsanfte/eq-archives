I have both, and was planning on using them at level 17 for dual wield.<br/>\n&gt; Which shoud be the primary weapon, or is there a better combo?  I also have<br/>\n&gt; a Dragoon Dirk.  Any comments would be appreciated.  Thanks<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>A tentacle whip, while fast and a cheap weapon, has a horrible dmg/delay<br/>\nratio (0.16), almost as bad as a rusty weapon. The lifetap effect is<br/>\nvery very minor. A dragoon dirk is fast and does good dmg (0.260). For<br/>\ncomparison, the PGT Is 0.230, a barbed whip is 0.250 and a mino axe is<br/>\n0.216. Higher is better.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I&#39;d personally go with that dragoon dirk. Good damage and speed, good<br/>\nstat bonuses. And fast weapons are nice.<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nJesse &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:j@...\">j@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lumiere.net/\">http://www.lumiere.net/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
