Probably, right around 1.5 ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1441711817\">How long are your fights?  Over a 45 second fight I<br/>\nwill almost guarantee that you are not AVERAGING more<br/>\nthan 2 procs a fight.  Probably, right around 1.5<br/>\nprocs.  Run your logs through a parser and I&#39;ll bet<br/>\nyou will be shocked.  I&#39;m not saying that you can&#39;t<br/>\nregularly proc 3 or 4 times in a fight.  However, it<br/>\nwill be averaged with those times where you don&#39;t proc<br/>\nat all in a fight.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI used a Staff of Writhing and Obsidian Shard to test<br/>\nand had my dex bumped to 159--part of the time I even<br/>\nhad it around 173.  Guess what.  We fought lancerfish<br/>\nin kedge.  The fights lasted 45-60 seconds.  I<br/>\nAVERAGED less than 2 procs a fight.  Granted I charmed<br/>\nin a couple of fights.  However, I proced nowhere near<br/>\nthe 4 or 5 times a fight that I felt like I was doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, I&#39;m not saying that you aren&#39;t sometimes<br/>\ngetting 3 or 4 procs a fight.  I get 3 to 4 procs a<br/>\nfight fairly often myself.  All I am saying is that<br/>\nyou are probably not AVERAGING 3 to 4 a fight.  Run<br/>\nyour log through EQParse and I&#39;ll bet you are<br/>\nsurprised.<br/>\n<br/>\nThex Luteslinger (Tunare)<br/>\n37th level bard<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Message: 8<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Fri, 10 Mar 2000 18:11:04 -0500<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Kevin L.

I<br/>\n&gt; had one fight where my ugly stick proc&#39;d 7 times in<br/>\n&gt; a row (esp primary hand)<br/>\n&gt; Then again my un-buffed dex is 150.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Who needs AC anyway?

Most weapons don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; average<br/>\n&gt; &gt; more than 1 proc every 45 seconds or so anyway<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (contrary to most people&#39;s belief that they<br/>\n&gt; average 4<br/>\n&gt; &gt; or 5 procs per fight).  The damage/delay is better<br/>\n&gt; &gt; than the ykesha and ebw (not taking into account<br/>\n&gt; magic<br/>\n&gt; &gt; numbers and lower delay,etc).  I guess I still<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; see why you guys think it is crappy.  Granted it<br/>\n&gt; is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; off a dragon and is only marginally better than<br/>\n&gt; your<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ykesh or ebw.  However, unless you have a planar<br/>\n&gt; &gt; weapon I would consider this better.  Anyway,<br/>\n&gt; anyone<br/>\n&gt; &gt; on Tunare who think this weapon is crappy--I will<br/>\n&gt; &gt; gladly take your crappy weapon!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thex Luteslinger (Tunare)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 37th level bard<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTalk to your friends online with Yahoo!
