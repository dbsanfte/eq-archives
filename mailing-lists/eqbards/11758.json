Last","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-592933409\">A while back, someone noted that there was a cauldron in Neriak that acted <br/>\nlike it was locked.  Someone else noted a similar cauldron in <br/>\nCrushbone.  Last night, someone in the chat room mentioned a weird crystal <br/>\nin Ak&#39;anon that turns and makes a door noise.  I tested this one for <br/>\nmyself.  Finally, I think I discovered the solution:<br/>\nWithout going deeply into 3-d realm development, suffice to say that there <br/>\nare two basic kinds of &quot;things&quot; in the EQ world - Brushes (walls, floors, <br/>\nceilings - permanent, non-moving pieces of structure) and entities (things <br/>\nthat move, or have &quot;function&quot; or cause actions).  The primary difference <br/>\nbetween a brush and an entity when building it is the assignment of a <br/>\nspecific &quot;function&quot; to that entity.  For example, doors might be assigned a <br/>\nfunc_door attribute, to allow them to be opened.  The standard attribute <br/>\nthat they are assigned will often include other, related things, such as <br/>\nsounds or actions that may be performed on such items.<br/>\nWhat I think has happened in all three cases (and I&#39;m sure there are more <br/>\nout there, waiting to be found...) was that when the entity was created, it <br/>\nwas supposed to be assigned a func_cauldron (makes noise or whatever it was <br/>\nsupposed to do).  But someone assigned it the wrong number (13 instead of <br/>\n31) and it ended up becoming a func_locked_door.  With the rotating crystal <br/>\nin Ak&#39;anon, it looks like it should have been a func_rotating_crystal, and <br/>\ninstead is a func_door.<br/>\nAnyway - that&#39;s really what it looks like to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nTalies the Wanderer</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
