Tonight I finally made the 11th rank.  We were in W. Commons killing the Derv&#39;s when lo and behold a werewolf arrived and decimated all but 2 of us, myself and a ranger friend.  Upon zoning to E. Commons and then returning to the Bard&#39;s guild, I came to the realization that I needed &quot;real&quot; armor.  Up to this point, I have been wearing all leather.  It is affordable and light but is not as effective against the Derv&#39;s and such.  I NEED BANDED!!!<br/>\n    And now on to my problem, where do I pick up the plat to buy this wonderful armor?  I seem to only make around 5 pp a night at best.  Would joining a guild help me in this situation?  If so does anyone no any good guilds on Erollisi Marr?  I&#39;ve taken to fighting darkweeds but there is far too much downtime.  The orc cents in my area have very little loot, so soloing in this area is pretty worthless.  The derv&#39;s have lovely loot, but I am afraid of grouping with people I don&#39;t know.  Especially in a zone like W. Commons.  Tonight they actually attacked the werewolf!!<br/>\nYesterday someone in my group decided, despite my warnings, to walk up and slap Lord Shin Ree.  What should I do?<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you in advance for your advice,<br/>\nWeiland of Freeport<br/>\n11th Rank Bard of Erollisi Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
