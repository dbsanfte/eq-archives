Verant could even make it so that it&#39;s a level thing that<br/>\nyou couldn&#39;t use the other 8 spots until say level such and such (15+) like<br/>\ndual wield. Makes sense. You get more experienced and are able to remember<br/>\nmore songs. Especially if you&#39;ve been playing the first 8 songs for 15+<br/>\nlevels of your life.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; think the spellcasting classes really have much of a problem <br/>\n&gt; with this. Many of their spells at higher levels are just<br/>\n&gt; improved versions of spells they had at lower levels.<br/>\n&gt; They don&#39;t really have to worry about memorizing their low<br/>\n&gt; level spells once they reach a certain point.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;d disagree here. Spellcasting classes use spells all of their lives and<br/>\nnormally have much higher INT/WIS stats than we as Bards do. Thus it would<br/>\nmake more sense for them to be able to expand their # of memorized spells<br/>\nthan not.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
