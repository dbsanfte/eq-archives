","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1240531461\">Eeeep,<br/>\n<br/>\nFull Bronze at level 11 and you are suggesting that she look at upgrades?<br/>\n<br/>\nI would put forth the notion that you are very well equiped for your level.<br/>\nFurthermore, I would say that for the short term, you really don&#39;t need to<br/>\nupgrade anything. (Here comes the old timer statement) When I was your age,<br/>\nI had a full set of patchwork. (and a pair of Bronze Vambraces that I paid<br/>\n22 p for)<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I do agree with Sylly&#39;s advice. When it&#39;s time to upgrade, you will<br/>\nwant to get rid of that heavy (and ugly) bronze. The next step from bronze<br/>\nis usually Lambent, although on a few pieces banded will suffice (being<br/>\nnearly the same ac, but much lighter)<br/>\n<br/>\nFor weapons you are in the same boat, you have very good weapons for your<br/>\nlevel. (again, I was wielding a rusty scimitar at that level) Weapons are a<br/>\nwhole other story for bards though. If you decide to be an instrument bard,<br/>\nyou could conceivably put down those weapons at 20 and not see them for<br/>\n10-20 levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike Silly said, Level is God, AC is king, and resists are your friends.<br/>\nMost other stats have not shown that they have a significant impact on<br/>\ncombat.<br/>\n<br/>\nDraelon<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Sylly Songsynger [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, April 05, 2000 9:46 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] New message<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGreetings and Welcome Melodii!!<br/>\n<br/>\nSounds like you are pretty well equipped in armor and weapons.  Although, I<br/>\nwould suggest that you review your bronze armor and look at the weight to AC<br/>\nratio of each piece - iirc, some give lots more ac per pound that others.<br/>\nMaking those &#39;others&#39; key candidates for replacement with things that may<br/>\nhave a touch less ac but perhaps some other stats (dex+, mr+, etc.)  If I<br/>\nwere you, I would be looking for jewelry and other items with magic<br/>\nresistance, poison resistance (snakes are good from your level thru 13-15<br/>\niicr), or strength.  Level is God, AC is King & Resist items are you best<br/>\nfriends. Buffs are very nice too :)  There are also the &#39;classic&#39; bard<br/>\nthings: elf hide gloves, troll hide belt, mask of the deceiver (you are too<br/>\nyoung to fight for one but might be able to loot one if you brave the depths<br/>\nof Upper and Lower Guk - the Mask comes from a mid 30&#39;s camp.
