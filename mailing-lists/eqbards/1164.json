After","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1345104806\">Hey Faras,<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night when we grouped I told you that I thought improvements in alcohol<br/>\ntolerance were based on what type of alcohol you were drinking.  After I<br/>\nlogged off I posted a message on the eqbrewers onelist to try and get an<br/>\nanswer.  So far haven&#39;t got a response yet but will let you know what I find<br/>\nout.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy idea is that once you get to a certain alcohol tolerance level, certain<br/>\nbrews will not help you improve anymore.  I base this on my own experience.<br/>\nI trained my alcohol tolerance at the bards guild to 10.  I also brewed<br/>\nabout 40 bottles of short beer.  Initially, drinking 3-4 beers at a time<br/>\nwould raise my alcohol tolerance by one.  However, once my alcohol tolerance<br/>\ngot to around 20, I have noticed drinking short beer now does nothing except<br/>\nget me drunk.  Haven&#39;t had an increase in alcohol tolerance in a long time.<br/>\nMy belief is that I will have to start drinking more expensive drinks such<br/>\nas elven wine in order to raise my alcohol tolerance.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a side note, does anyone think that drinking alcohol should affect<br/>\n(either positively or negatively) the effects of bards songs?  As it stands<br/>\nright now, it mainly improves STR and STA and decreases INT, DEX and AGI.<br/>\nThe decrease in DEX already has a negative impact on a bards ability to play<br/>\nan instrument.  However, IMO it would be nice if your CHR went up while you<br/>\nwere drunk or duration of songs was increased.  It would definately add a<br/>\ntwist to roleplaying a bard.  Just a thought...<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin<br/>\nAnother drunken bard on E&#39;ci   <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\tMike Roach [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mroach@...\">mroach@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tWednesday, May 26, 1999 11:42 AM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject:\t[eqbards] (no subject)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Mike Roach &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mroach@...\">mroach@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ok, here is a good one:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Who can tell me anything about alcohol tolerance?  I drink different kinds<br/>\n&gt; and quantities of Alcohol in the game but do not really know how this<br/>\n&gt; works<br/>\n&gt; to raise your skill in Alcohol Tolerance.  Has anyone been successful at<br/>\n&gt; raising this skill and if so, what are the best alcohols to drink to do<br/>\n&gt; so,<br/>\n&gt; and which ones are not?  I have been drinking primarily mead and not<br/>\n&gt; noticing much improvement.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Faras the Drunken Bard of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  where real people with real interests get connected.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Join a new list today! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
