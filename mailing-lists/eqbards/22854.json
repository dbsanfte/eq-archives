It&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;point you in the direction of the corpse, but more<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;importantly, it&#39;ll make the corpse your current target.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Next you use Solidarity of Vision (L34) to bind sight to the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;corpse.  Switch to an external camera view, rotate around, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;usually you can tell from the surroundings exactly where the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;corpse is.  VERY useful for finding corpses in dangerous<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;sections of a dungeon, or if the corpse isn&#39;t where the person<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;thinks he died.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;--<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;John H.
