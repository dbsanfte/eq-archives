Some necro races are pathetically<br/>\nweak and need to be boosted (depending on play style).<br/>\n<br/>\nALSO:  Not everyone is about min/maxing their characters for &quot;optimal<br/>\nperformance&quot;.  Some of us are roleplayers who like to build a story around a<br/>\nstrangely strong, weak, stupid, clumsy character.  I created a rogue with<br/>\nintentionally low dexterity just to have something to build a story line on.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, I would submit, putting stats into strength can never be considered<br/>\n&quot;Bad&quot;.  It gives you more carrying capacity and the extra ATK you get from<br/>\nit isn&#39;t bad either, everyone melees at lower levels, and some folks like to<br/>\nget in and mix it up a little always, especially when soloing... which<br/>\nnecro&#39;s tend to do alot.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust because someone&#39;s style differs from yours doesn&#39;t make them &quot;wrong&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nLyrnia<br/>\n<br/>\nNow you&#39;re just getting silly.  As Rokken said, there are some BARDS out<br/>\nthere that don&#39;t know that you can&#39;t twist invis with another song.  You<br/>\ndon&#39;t like what Gordon has to say sometimes, and on occasion he does stick<br/>\nhis foot in his mouth.  But that doesn&#39;t mean he doesn&#39;t know how to play<br/>\nEQ.  He&#39;s been playing it a hell of a lot longer than you have, that I know<br/>\nfor a fact :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;David Blank&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EvilNuff@...\">EvilNuff@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, June 01, 2000 12:01 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] RE: Gordon<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &gt;FYI:  I&#39;ve known him, in game, since Beta 2.  He&#39;s a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;nice guy, fun to hunt with and very knowledgeable<br/>\n&gt; &gt;about his OWN class.  Just like we are.  You can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt;blame him for not knowing bards.  He&#39;s a mouthpiece,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;nothing more.  He had an idea, offered it up and was<br/>\n&gt; &gt;wrong and admitted it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I mostly lurk here but I really feel that I do have to<br/>\n&gt; comment here.  Remember Gordon is the guy who felt<br/>\n&gt; that putting points into strength for his necro was a<br/>\n&gt; valid character creation strategy...that IMO proves<br/>\n&gt; his lack of understanding of how EQ works awfully<br/>\n&gt; well.  My Bard is at a whopping level 8 yet because I<br/>\n&gt; have 3 characters over level 30 I was able to see that<br/>\n&gt; twisting invis wouldn&#39;t work.  I don&#39;t blame him for<br/>\n&gt; not knowing Bards...I blame him for not knowing EQ as<br/>\n&gt; a whole.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -David<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Send instant messages & get email alerts with Yahoo!
