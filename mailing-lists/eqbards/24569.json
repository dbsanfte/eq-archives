They have the same AC and have slightly different stat <br/>\nmodifiers.  3 dex 2 cha on one vs. 3 cha 2 dex on another kinda thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nKael and Skyshrine Quest Armors are superior to both Resonant and <br/>\nMelodic and are roughly equivelant to each other.  Kael armor has <br/>\nhigher AC, Skyshrine has higher stat values (including resists).<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll be eventually angling after Skyshrine Armor for a couple <br/>\nreasons.  Many guilds have already gone after Kael armor, so they&#39;ll <br/>\nbe less competition for Skyshrine (I hope) and at the super high AC <br/>\nthese armor already have, if I lose 2 or 3 ac per piece but gain <br/>\nacross the board in resists, I think I&#39;ll be better off overall.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlus, it appears the Caster armor is better out of Skyshrine than <br/>\nKael, and my GF plays a mage.... :)<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkfox<br/>\nXegony<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Is it not true that all the velious armor has basically the same <br/>\n </span></blockquote>stats but are arrived at through different avenues depending on what <br/>\nfactions you want to destroy?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  <br/>\n&gt; i.e. Melodic = Resonant = Troubador ?<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; -Faras<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
