If we started with the increased range, we might be using them to<br/>\nthis day.  I&#39;ve used levitation for crossing Lake Rathe... with party<br/>\nmembers dropping in the water and then not being able to be effected by my<br/>\nsong, it became easier for all to swim, or to get levitation another way.<br/>\nSame with Lavastorm.  I&#39;ve used water breathing to get to the cave in<br/>\nEverfrost.  Talk about a slow, painful and FEARFUL trip. :)  I knew I<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t drown, but we had to go painfully slow to make sure my GF who was<br/>\nfollowing me didn&#39;t fall out of range.  And I can&#39;t count the times I&#39;ve<br/>\noutran my GF in a trek across country, having to stop and wait for her to<br/>\nget back in range of selo&#39;s... (I wish I could explain THAT one. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThese enhancements may not seem &quot;all that&quot; for those of us who&#39;ve found<br/>\nother ways around them, but for a young bard coming up, hopefully those<br/>\nsongs become more useful.  Liken it to the Point North spell... Would we<br/>\never use it?  Not a chance.  Would a new character?  Most certainly.<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkfox Reven&#39;tsol<br/>\nXegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
