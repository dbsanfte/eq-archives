If you are a wizard (or a bard<br/>\n&gt;in this case), you would generally not wear items such<br/>\n&gt;as platemail as it&#39;s weight and restrictivness in movement<br/>\n&gt;would hinder the caster&#39;s ability; however, it doesn&#39;t mean<br/>\n&gt;that they couldn&#39;t equip/wear the item, it just would<br/>\n&gt;introduce a possibilty of penalties (ie. more difficult<br/>\n&gt;to cast successfully through lower dex and lower agility).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Should Clerics, Paladins, Shadowknights and Rangers also suffer this same<br/>\npenalty when casting in Plate, or are you recommending a Bard-only penalty?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So to give my opinion, the bard should be allowed to where plate, if he /<br/>\n </span></blockquote>she wants.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;There&#39;s my two coppers worth. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
