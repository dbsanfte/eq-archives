I did<br/>\nzone (I didn&#39;t camp out IN Befallen - but just outside its zone boundary)<br/>\nand come back and the body was unreachable (However - never zoned in and out<br/>\nwhile remaining online).  There definitely was no change until he Camped out<br/>\nand came back.  However - he did NOT try zoning out and back into Befallen<br/>\nafter we discovered the bug.  Also note that there were several other people<br/>\nin the group as well (if that makes a difference)  And once again this was<br/>\nmany months ago - so the code could have changed dramatically since then.<br/>\n<br/>\nBottom line though - we have a bunch of good suggestions - have the victim<br/>\nzone in and out - party members zone in and out - try logging in and out -<br/>\nand then pray to your appropriate God that you can get a guide or GM...<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
