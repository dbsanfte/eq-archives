I bought a 3 fan/heat sink from computernerd.com.  My<br/>\nbuddies at their computer store were in shock when they saw it.  I used to<br/>\nrun temperature software, and it ran cooler then the original fan/not<br/>\noverclocked.  The SB live has the latest drivers. I also have an extra fan<br/>\ninstalled in the front of the pc case.  Its getting gutted tonight to see<br/>\nwhat is going on.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Daniel P.

If you over clock - I&#39;d strongly recommend make making<br/>\nsure you have a heat sensor and monitoring software.  Fan cooling and<br/>\nairflow is very important.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the positive side - you can get a replacement Celeron relatively cheap.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW - as far as comments on Win 98/ME being faster than 2000 - 2000 has a<br/>\nlot more &quot;protection&quot; which comes at a cost processor cycle wise.  Assuming<br/>\nyou don&#39;t specifically need some of 2000&#39;s features not avail in 95/98/ME<br/>\n(networking for example) - you have to choose between stability or speed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t worked with ME very long - but if Micro$oft can make it&#39;s dates -<br/>\n&quot;Whistler&quot; will replace it - their new Consumer OS based on the NT kernel -<br/>\nso it very well may be short-lived.<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Kimes, Dean W.

Once overheating<br/>\nbegins it is a rapidly accelerating process and you generally never regain<br/>\nthe original state.  I had one of my machines do this that was overclocked<br/>\nand it would never run cool again.

Run a voodoo 3000 vid card and<br/>\nan sb live, oh and a 1* 128meg sim of 100mhz ram.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s my problem, I pretty much only play EQ, check email and surf.  Lately<br/>\ni&#39;ve had a few solid lockups playing eq, some crashes to desktop as well.<br/>\nYesterday i got 2 in 10-15 minutes and the day before i died while kiting<br/>\ndue to this (grrr)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways, I tried deinstalling EQ, reinstalling EQ, RoK and SoV.  While<br/>\nreinstalling SoV, total lockup again.  This indicated to me that probably my<br/>\npc is overheating or something.  Another thing i&#39;ve noticed while playing is<br/>\nthat my graphics seem to be choppier than normal (more vid lag, and its not<br/>\nswarmcaller) (which indicates to me processing problems).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo... Tonight I&#39;m going to probably rip the pc open, check if my fan is<br/>\nstill working, if it is i&#39;ll proceed to downclock the cpu back to 300 like<br/>\nits supposed to be.  If my pc is still acting up from there i&#39;ll reinstall<br/>\nwin98 (arg i hate doing this, takes forever with all my apps).<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone have any suggestions as to what the prob may be, I have a<br/>\nfeeling my cpu might be nearing retirement but i&#39;m really hoping this isnt<br/>\nthe case because i dont have the cash to buy a new chip/board cause that<br/>\nwould run me about 350$ canadian for a 700mhz/board<br/>\n<br/>\nMinkin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
