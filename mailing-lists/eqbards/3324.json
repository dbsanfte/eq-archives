It was designed that way.<br/>\nNow I do not know about the song affecting the dmg but it seems that they<br/>\nmust have increase the MOB hit factor because I noticed the same thing these<br/>\npast 4 days.  I am lvl 23 now but I was lvl 22 the whole last week.  I used<br/>\nto kill gorge hound with ease from lvl 20 to 22 but somehow now they are<br/>\nhitting me really hard at max dmg.  I have full bronze since lvl 18.  The<br/>\nonly thing that was changed in my armor since the past 4 days is that I got<br/>\na BS Mantle and a elf-hide glove.  My str is 95, my dex is 107, and my agi<br/>\nis 108.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour Friendly Rogue and Bard<br/>\nHammerpaw and Syren Wind<br/>\nChampions of Norrath, The Rathe<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Schafer, Timothy L 1425 [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Timothy.Schafer@...\">Timothy.Schafer@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, July 12, 1999 4:22 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Max damage?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Schafer, Timothy L      1425&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Timothy.Schafer@...\">Timothy.Schafer@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis actually would not surprise me if it&#39;s something Verant added recently,<br/>\nsince Twisting can somewhat be considered an exploit, even tho Verant has<br/>\nnot announced this, it wouldn&#39;t surprise me to see that they added the extra<br/>\ndamage to make up for the added bonuses of twisting.  This way they are<br/>\nhappy, and us the unknowing are not getting as much benefit as we thought.<br/>\n<br/>\nI personally don&#39;t twist, I may switch up songs in battle if the needs<br/>\narise, but I have never found twisting to be that big a benefit.  At 17th<br/>\nlevel the healing song only restores 7hp/tick while standing, and the<br/>\naverage monster is hitting for 20-50 pts per hit, so the heal isn&#39;t worth<br/>\nit, when if I play anthem and it doesn&#39;t ever quit they get a more increased<br/>\nattack rate, so therefore they do more damage.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI just don&#39;t think twisting is worth it.  The closest I come is while<br/>\nbellowing, as soon as I see the damage message, I stop and restart the song.<br/>\nThis decreases the times between bellows almost in half.  I actually felt<br/>\nguilty about this at first, but without doing this, I would have problems<br/>\nfighting some of the black/white creatures that I tend to solo.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that most bards do twist, and I do not hold this against you in any<br/>\nways, but are you wanting me to believe that the game was designed to do<br/>\nthis?  I don&#39;t believe it was, I think the reasons the songs don&#39;t stop<br/>\nimmediately is so that if you get bashed or stunned, that you can restart<br/>\nthe song without losing the effect of whichever song you were playing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is just my 2cp.<br/>\n<br/>\nWenaddar 17th level bard of Cazic-Thule</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
