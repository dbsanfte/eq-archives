Dunno if<br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s actually the case.

If anyone on our server wants us to not<br/>\nkill a dragon when it spawns, all they have to do is send our guild leader<br/>\na tell saying &quot;we&#39;d like a chance to kill the next Vox spawn&quot; and we have<br/>\nalways replied &quot;sure&quot; and given them plenty of time (usually 2 or 3 days).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What I&#39;ve seen done is for the multi-guild coordinated party<br/>\n&gt; to take over the /ooc or /auction channel and use that for<br/>\n&gt; coordination in lieu of /guildsay.  (/shout too, but that can<br/>\n&gt; get annoying for others in the zone.)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not the actual fight co-ordination.  It&#39;s getting another guild to<br/>\nget the right people to the right place at the right time.  It&#39;s already a<br/>\npain in the neck to get everyone in our guild to show up, to have to<br/>\nworry about another guild too is turning a 2 hour Vox trip to a 6 hour Vox<br/>\ntrip.  Plus, we can get 24 people to show up in Sol B in an hours notice.<br/>\nWe can&#39;t do that if there&#39;s another guild involved.<br/>\n<br/>\nMiriana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
