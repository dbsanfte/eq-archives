I am off to purchase a Geforce2 32 or 64 MB video card from Hercules tonight or tomorrow.  Some local friends mimic what you have said about them, but none of them are bards - good to have some qualified advice.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again,<br/>\n<br/>\nPiemur<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 1<br/>\n   Date: Tue, 12 Jun 2001 13:26:35 -0400<br/>\n   From: Cook Miller-ETOP03 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:etop03@...\">etop03@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: OT - Equipment question<br/>\n<br/>\nTallies, I figured this a topic of interest even if not directly related to barding.  Bards do provide a lot of input into what is seen in game graphically, so this can be an important topic.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a 450 mhz P3 Gateway with 128 MB Ram and Voodoo 3000 16 MB AGP graphics card.  I can&#39;t get a new computer.  But more memory and a better graphics card are in reach due to Father&#39;s day.  I just got 128 MB Ram - done.  So now I want to get my fellow bards input on what graphics cards they use, have used and performance rating.  Brand, MB, speed, anything else of note would be much appreciated.  Currently, framerate in WW and some places in FV sucks - I auto follow, look down and hope they don&#39;t scrape me off on a tree.  I can&#39;t imagine Luclin without a better card.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again for all the help,<br/>\n<br/>\nPiemur Draggonsinger 42 bard<br/>\nRobiinton Masterrhealer 32 cleric</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
