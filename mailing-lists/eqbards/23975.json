There ARE PvP<br/>\nplayers - who are as passionate about EQ PvP as we are about EQ Bards (I<br/>\ntalked with quite a few of them at the Baltimore Fan Faire).  Also don&#39;t<br/>\nforget - that a goodly number of people on the Blue Servers like to Duel<br/>\nfrom time to time - and don&#39;t forget Test of Tactics 2.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t play PvP and I don&#39;t duel - but it IS a part of the game - and<br/>\nVerant has to expend SOME amount of resources to support it.
