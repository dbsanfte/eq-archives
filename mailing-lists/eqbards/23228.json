I know all the pros and cons of each race, so what i<br/>\nwas looking for here was what they look like in plate (yes i am really that<br/>\nvain :) )<br/>\n<br/>\nI was wondering if someone knew an url that had pictures of the various<br/>\nraces in lambent, bronze, FS plate, imbrued etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had tried the fashion table at allakhazams, but the quality of the<br/>\nscreenshots isnt that good<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nQaelan<br/>\n47 cleric<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
