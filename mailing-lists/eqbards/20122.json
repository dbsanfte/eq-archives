Here is how I solo&#39;d out of Hell_1 without dying once and without a lot<br/>\nof trouble:<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Warsliks Woods ((at pos948,pos1514) there is a giant camp with 3 giants.<br/>\nYou can solo them with CoD/DDD/Largos/Hymn and they are far enough apart<br/>\nthat you can pick one of them at a time. The rest of the zone is mostly way<br/>\ngreen with a few wandering blues, but I never got into so much trouble that<br/>\nrunning (without zoning) didn&#39;t fix it. I love having the auto-pull effect<br/>\nwhen you go back too, just make sure you approach from the right direction.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTszaaz E&#39;Taurguin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
