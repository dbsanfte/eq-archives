With a base CHA of 130 something, weapons in hand, I could<br/>\n   pretty much shutdown any enemy.  In the 50 or so tries I made, I<br/>\n   only got two outright resists, and probably 20 or so of the attempts<br/>\n   will &#39;mob didnt mez&#39;.  If you get &#39;mob didnt mez&#39; 3 times in a row<br/>\n   you can expect it to attack the next round.  I switched to flute<br/>\n   with same CHA, and I noticed an ever so slight drop in &#39;mob didnt<br/>\n   mez&#39; as it continued to stick over and over.  When the shaman buffed<br/>\n   my CHA up above 170, I saw no impact or change in the secondary<br/>\n   resist messages. /shrug  Again, I don&#39;t have the raw numbers because;<br/>\n   well you let the froglok king, two boks, and two jins beat the crap<br/>\n   out of you for a few minutes and you kinda want to just kill them.<br/>\n<br/>\n   With my weapons in hand and CHA 130, I can hold a scarling or<br/>\n   spider in Fear with little or no problems (once the first pixie <br/>\n   takes).  I haven&#39;t tried any other mobs.  The mobs in hate have<br/>\n   such insane magic resistances that any pixie I try is outright<br/>\n   resisted.  Until Malosi or Tash is in I usually don&#39;t get very <br/>\n   far (flute or not) - however, the flute does help significantly<br/>\n   in hate for continual pixie striking.<br/>\n<br/>\n   Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
