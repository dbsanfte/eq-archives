Basically they<br/>\nseem to be a do nothing lot.  I&#39;ve had a little better luck on E&#39;ci, with<br/>\nthe exception of the guy who told me I was obviously a game hacker and not<br/>\nto bother him anymore.

Thanks again for all your support in this.  <br/>\n <br/>\nBasically, the GMs did nothing.  I was asked to write the head GM on our<br/>\nserver an email to which she has not yet responded (been 5 days).  I have<br/>\npretty much given up hope that they will take any action at all.  While the<br/>\ntheft of the items was the direct result of a poor decision on my part, the<br/>\nlore bag of items poofing was a bug and I&#39;m a little disappointed that I<br/>\nhave not even received a response from the GMs.<br/>\n <br/>\nAnyway, I had Halana camp for the items again, got most of them.  Then a<br/>\nfriend decided he wasn&#39;t going to play his twinked bard anymore and gave me<br/>\nmost of his lambent items.    All I need to replace now are an offhand<br/>\nweapon, shoulder, back and sleeve items.  <br/>\n <br/>\nSoooooo... if there are any young bards on Sol Ro who would like a piece or<br/>\ntwo of lambent (sleeves, gloves and legs I believe), drop me an email or<br/>\nsend me a tell in game cuz i have extras :)<br/>\n <br/>\nThanks again for all your support!<br/>\n <br/>\nTani 20th (no longer nekkid) Bard<br/>\nHalana 50th (don&#39;t go to the planes if you dislike arguments) Shaman<br/>\nSolusek Ro<br/>\n <br/>\nWendy Lynn Cranfill<br/>\nMaxtor Corporation<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nGET A NEXTCARD VISA, in 30 seconds!
