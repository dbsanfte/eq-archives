If an item ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-941838463\">There&#39;s another type of helpfull guild as well.  My<br/>\ncurrent guild is made up of a small tight knit group<br/>\nof folks who all help each other out.  If an item<br/>\ndrops that someone else (even if not in our group) can<br/>\nuse or needs it goes to him or her no questions asked.<br/>\n In Unrest last week our group got 2 opalline earrings<br/>\nand the 4 of us from our guild gave up part of our<br/>\nshare of loot to buy them from the group to give to<br/>\nthe guild&#39;s enchanter.  Its help like that, that<br/>\nreally makes the game fun. :)  (Also keep in mind on a<br/>\nnew server there&#39;s a LOT more fun from generic<br/>\neveryday items to be had...bronze is still appreciated<br/>\nas a gift. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n-David<br/>\n<br/>\nI would never join a guild for the sole reason of<br/>\ngetting nice items for free.  I have nothing against<br/>\npeople helping other people out, but I believe there&#39;s<br/>\na lot to be said for being able to acquire my<br/>\nequipment by my own means.  Singing Steel Boots aside<br/>\n(which I mentioned I received as a gift), the only<br/>\nother item I have which I did not a) loot, b) buy, or<br/>\nc) trade for myself is an EB BP and I feel I&#39;ve been<br/>\npretty well equipped throughout the life of my Bard. <br/>\nWhen I received the BP as a wedding present, I was<br/>\ncapable of gaining it myself by a), b) or c).<br/>\n<br/>\nI see my guild more as a means to help me get to the<br/>\nplaces to acquire equipment rather than a guild that<br/>\nwill take all of the work out of it.  I don&#39;t mind<br/>\ntwinking (my level 10 Shaman has almost full Totemic),<br/>\nbut I still take some pride in having acquired that<br/>\nequipment myself in another character.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have seen and heard of far too many guilds, for my<br/>\ntaste, where people join for the sole purpose of<br/>\ngetting twinked.  Level 10 characters join and demand<br/>\n&quot;phat lewt&quot; or they threaten to quit.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe I&#39;m more of a &quot;loner&quot; or maybe, even tho I have<br/>\ngiven away many items to people, I don&#39;t want to feel<br/>\nobligated to reciprocate every time I get something of<br/>\nvalue on my own.  But, whichever reason, I&#39;d<br/>\ndefinitely prefer to purchase, trade, or loot the<br/>\nSinging Steel Gaunts on my own.<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkfox Reven&#39;tsol<br/>\nXegony<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nSend instant messages & get email alerts with Yahoo!
