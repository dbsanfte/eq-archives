I know that the area<br/>\neffect is an issue, but in places like Mistmoore it<br/>\nisn&#39;t really a problem.  Most of the time you get an<br/>\ninitiate or pledge another comes with it.  So you are<br/>\nfighting more than one at a time, so why not do damage<br/>\nto all of them at the same time.  It also helps out<br/>\nparties around me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I lure, I use Bellow and then ofcourse Selo to<br/>\nget the creature to my party.  Once I get it back to<br/>\nthe party, I turn on Denon&#39;s and after the first pulse<br/>\nI go for Chords and then 2 Bellows or a Bellow and<br/>\nAnthem.  This gives me almost 4 songs going at the<br/>\nsame time, with damage and buff.  All the while I am<br/>\ndoing this, I am also meleeing.  I know this sounds<br/>\ncomplicated, but the amount of damage I can do is<br/>\nstaggering.  Of course having a well balanced party<br/>\nhelps the eventual finishing off, but the 2 area<br/>\neffect damage songs are quite good.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know any of the exact numbers as to how much<br/>\ndamage the 2 songs do, but I can see the health bar of<br/>\nthe creature actually move every time it pulses.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSedaien Reyvon</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
