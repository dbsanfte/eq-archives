The bards of everquest travel,<br/>\nsing songs, and play instruments.  They are in fact travelling musicians,<br/>\nwhich you said the celts were not.  I could handle bards wearing chain in a<br/>\nroleplay situation, however, not plate.  This is my opinion, and I feel both<br/>\nsides need to be expressed with minimal sarcasm (which is why i appreciated<br/>\nthat post, not nearly as much sarcasm).  It&#39;s understandable that most of<br/>\nyou want to retain the ability to wear plate, but I fail to see a valid<br/>\nargument from a roleplaying point of view for the allowance of plate on<br/>\nbards.  This is not to say that I&#39;ll not wear plate, because I&#39;m not THAT<br/>\ncommited to convictions.  -=) <br/>\n<br/>\nKa`Lend<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:firehawk@...\">firehawk@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Okay that&#39;s it I&#39;ve about had it my fellows of song.  It&#39;s time for a<br/>\n&gt; reality check.  I roleplay.. the fact that I have a bard since day one<br/>\n&gt; release and am only level 13 attests to that.
