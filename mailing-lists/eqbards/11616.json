Friends of mine receive help with no<br/>\nthought of debt.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYou say it yourself, this item is required, in abundance, and you are a<br/>\nmerchant.  What self-respecting merchant out there gives away free items<br/>\nbecause they aren&#39;t of much value to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one has ever complained about people selling high level runes and words<br/>\nand pages for 50-100pp if they want, I see no difference between<br/>\nthis and lambent stones, if you do please tell me what it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy bard bought most of his stones from merchants near banks or<br/>\nnear HGs/SGs.<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
