First one is in outside<br/>\nzones combined with chains to solo mobs.  Second situation is whenever I&#39;m<br/>\nfleeing to the zone.  I&#39;ve never used it during a regular combat because I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t want to risk starting a train.  As a result, I&#39;m not certain how it<br/>\naffects mobs inside a dungeon.  Lets use the predator room in Sol A as an<br/>\nexample.  This room is enclosed and only accessed by two doors. One door<br/>\nleads to the foreman room.  The other door leads to the hallway where the<br/>\npredator actually spawns.  Lets say your fighting mobs in this room and you<br/>\nuse the fear song.  Will the mobs open one of the doors and flee or will<br/>\nthey just ran around the room?  I assume mobs in every zone will open doors<br/>\nwhen feared/fleeing but just want to confirm.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt would be nice if there was a Wizard Lock spell in the game that works<br/>\nsimilar to the old AD&D spell.  Would be a major way to handle crowd<br/>\ncontrol.  Pull a few mobs into an enclosed room, Wizard Lock the door, use<br/>\nFear song, then pick them off one by one:-)<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; If you&#39;re in the king room and fear a mob, it goes haulin&#39; butt (like I<br/>\n&gt; really need to see more goblin crack) towards the gated trestles, opens<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; smaller first, stops, turns, opens the larger second, runs to the facing<br/>\n&gt; wall then despawns.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
