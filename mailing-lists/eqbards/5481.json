If this is in fact true, will there be<br/>\n&gt; a problem with the deepwater goblins (or other water<br/>\n&gt; nasties) if I swim around the edge just to get<br/>\n&gt; from zone to zone?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s right. You have to swim or levitate across. Or get a boat. I<br/>\nhaven&#39;t been there for a few weeks but I never encountered anything but<br/>\nmaybe a few sharks in the water. It might of changed but I don&#39;t think so.<br/>\nNear the center of the lake there are goblins underwater, but you won&#39;t be<br/>\ngoing anywhere near there hopefully.<br/>\n<br/>\nOhhh.. there&#39;s one named that swims around a lot. Prince Kermyt. He thrash<br/>\nyour evil friend. But I don&#39;t think there&#39;s much you can do but swim fast<br/>\nand hope you don&#39;t see him. I&#39;ve only see him once.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
