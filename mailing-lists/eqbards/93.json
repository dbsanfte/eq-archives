Sure, you can say the price is<br/>\nexcessive, but you outright accused them of being greedy without bothering<br/>\nto find out what they do with it.  Maybe you should have suggested some<br/>\nother plan instead?  Screaming &quot;bullcrap,&quot; and &quot;greedy rogues&quot; won&#39;t do a<br/>\nthing except hurt their image, and really they haven&#39;t done anything wrong.<br/>\nIf you don&#39;t like it, you don&#39;t have to join.  Once you join, you can always<br/>\nleave.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have personally met Jythri, Ixtlan, and a few other members.  Jythri was<br/>\nexcellent company, and offered me help immediatly.  Later, when I needed<br/>\nhelp and he wasn&#39;t available, a friend of his was more than willing to help<br/>\nme.  Ixtlan, a level 7 bard at the time I believe, took me from Freeport to<br/>\nHalas without charge.  He intended to just come back afterwords too.  That<br/>\nhas to be a two hour trip, even with accelerando.  That is what Jythri was<br/>\ntalking about.  Shirt off his back!  I can assure you, all other members of<br/>\nthe Soerbaird that I met were just as nice.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, I am NOT a Soerbaird member, or am I associated with them in any way,<br/>\nexcluding my admiration to their fine group.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am proud to know the Soerbaird are out there to lend a helping hand.<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\n<br/>\nGabriel (Kelvin on Fenin Rowe, level 7 bard)<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Randy Varnell &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rvarnell@...\">rvarnell@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nCc: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:delilah@...\">delilah@...</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:delilah@...\">delilah@...</a>&gt;; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rmcelreath@...\">rmcelreath@...</a><br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rmcelreath@...\">rmcelreath@...</a>&gt;; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scottp@...\">scottp@...</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scottp@...\">scottp@...</a>&gt;;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:incabrain@...\">incabrain@...</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:incabrain@...\">incabrain@...</a>&gt;; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:spot@...\">spot@...</a><br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:spot@...\">spot@...</a>&gt;; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mds240@...\">mds240@...</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mds240@...\">mds240@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Tuesday, April 20, 1999 10:47 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Re: The Soerbaird<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Randy Varnell &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rvarnell@...\">rvarnell@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ralborn:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I appreciate your concern, and I know that ten platinum is a hefty sum.<br/>\n&gt;But, as I responded to you privately, the funds are not misused nor are<br/>\n&gt;they squandered. Running a guild has its expenses, especially if we are to<br/>\n&gt;provide collective services for our bards so that they might carry on their<br/>\n&gt;work with honor and dignity.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;As I mentioned to you before, lad, we provide the following services to our<br/>\n&gt;members:<br/>\n&gt;    * Patchwork armor for all new students<br/>\n&gt;    * The first five levels of songs for all new students<br/>\n&gt;    * A hand drum at level 5<br/>\n&gt;    * A lute at level 8<br/>\n&gt;    * Bi-weekly rewards for the best in-guild ballad or writing. This week<br/>\n&gt;       it was a Banded mail tunic.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Also, we use the money to pay for other expenses, including:<br/>\n&gt;     * Staff for concerts<br/>\n&gt;     * Saving for a guild hall<br/>\n&gt;     * Prizes for other Soerbaird events<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;We do not use guild money for:<br/>\n&gt;     * Buying better armor or equipment for guild leadership<br/>\n&gt;     * Bribing news sites for better placement<br/>\n&gt;     * Paying necromancers to destory anyone who speaks negatively<br/>\n&gt;       about The Soerbaird<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;For the public record, all of our staff, called Ollave, have more than paid<br/>\n&gt;their ten platinum, without a complaint, and most of them continue to<br/>\n&gt;contribute into the guild treasury on a daily basis, in order to benefit<br/>\n&gt;our students. I have seen several of them give the shirts off of their<br/>\n&gt;backs and the weapons from their fists to help a deserved student in need.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Doerbaird, before you sally our guild&#39;s reputation again in a public forum,<br/>\n&gt;I would respectfully request that you air your differences with me, as I<br/>\n&gt;will be happy to hear any problem you have with our guild.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Listen and Live.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-- Jythri, Pencerdd of The Soerbaird<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;From: Joe Racke &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:joe_racke@...\">joe_racke@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Is it just me or is Soerbairds guild a rip off....I really want to know<br/>\n&gt;&gt;why the heck it costs 10plat plus a monthly fee to join...thats a load<br/>\n&gt;&gt;of Bull crap.....I was going to join but then i found i had better<br/>\n&gt;&gt;things to do than pay to those greedy rogues....If you give me enough<br/>\n&gt;&gt;information on that guild and why it costs so much then i might join it<br/>\n&gt;&gt;until then.....keep begging Soerbairds.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;This is Ralborn Songbearer ending his song<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Ralborn<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Bard of Qeynos<br/>\n&gt;&gt;follower of Bristlebane<br/>\n&gt;&gt;(also in his world)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Have you visited the new ONElist home page lately?<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;ONElist: The Leading e-mail list and community service on the Internet!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
