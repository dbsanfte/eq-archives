","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1852529874\">Dear Berk, <br/>\n<br/>\n&#39;Tis sad to see a bard speak so harshly. You don&#39;t know me well, then. My<br/>\nintent is to prevent a novice bard from getting incorrect information. <br/>\n<br/>\nBeing a founder of the Soerbaird, with members who have put hours of time<br/>\ninto various Beta Phases, and much research into all things Bardic, I would<br/>\nsay I have access to a lot of good information and research. I need only to<br/>\nturn to my fellow Soerbaird for accurate information I don&#39;t already have. A<br/>\nlevel 25 bard in our guild seems to be quite a rich source of experiential<br/>\nknowledge.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur guild is built to be a boon for Bards, and thus it&#39;s my charge, as well<br/>\nas the charge all Soerbaird to be helpful. <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I don&#39;t think it&#39;s arrogant or selfish to ask people to be accurate<br/>\nrather than wrong. I don&#39;t think young bards want to be given incorrect<br/>\ninformation. &quot;Guesstimates&quot; are fine, so long as they are posed that way. My<br/>\ncontention was that people were posting incorrect information as truth.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for time, I give what time I have to providing a source of information to<br/>\nSoerbaird as well as to anyone interested. I built the Soerbaird web site as<br/>\na resource for you or anyone else - as well as for my guild. I have indeed<br/>\ninvested many hours into developing this information storehouse for you and<br/>\nanyone else.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile it&#39;s only 1 week old, the site will soon be overflowing with<br/>\ninformation for young and old bards alike. I can tell you the leaders of the<br/>\nSoerbaird spend little time powergaming, and much time tinkering with<br/>\nquests, writing ballads, and testing techniques for bards. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs you might imagine, it takes time to document research, and I&#39;m always<br/>\ngrateful to those who do.<br/>\n<br/>\nDendall, Ollave of the Aegis<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.soerbaird.com\">http://www.soerbaird.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: John Rice [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:johnrice@...\">johnrice@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, April 23, 1999 1:49 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Re: A lot of misinformation<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;John Rice&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:johnrice@...\">johnrice@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy don&#39;t you enlighten all us poor dunces<br/>\nwith your incredible deductive prowess?<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, what, you don&#39;t have the time?<br/>\n<br/>\nYou would prefer to passively benefit only<br/>\nfrom the most exacting research of others,<br/>\nand not their guesstimates?
