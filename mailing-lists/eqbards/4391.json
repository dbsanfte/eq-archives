How much does dissonance with and without the lute/mandolin<br/>\n&gt;    at each level?  I&#39;ve heard 16 damage at level 30, but that<br/>\n&gt;    doesn&#39;t help when you&#39;re having a hard time getting up to<br/>\n&gt;    20 in the first place.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;2.  I took the very long trip to Innothule and spent a few hours<br/>\n&gt;    killing frogloks for netted armor.  Now, mind you, I made a<br/>\n&gt;    pretty good profit selling all the rusty weapons I could haul<br/>\n&gt;    to Oasis, and I have an almost complete set of netted armor<br/>\n&gt;    to auction off.  But I thought that having netted gloves<br/>\n&gt;    (which are magical) would let me fight hand to hand against<br/>\n&gt;    magic-only monsters.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve tried using netted gloves to hit wisps, they seem to only work<br/>\nfor monks hand to hand attacks.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;3.  Are there any weapons/armor out there that we can use as bards<br/>\n&gt;    to supplement our instrumental damage songs?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
