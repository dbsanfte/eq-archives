Getting the attention and help of someone<br/>\nfrom Verant is too hard and takes too long.  I understand that they have a<br/>\nproblem with staff versus the number of players, and I have no doubt that<br/>\nfar too many of player attempts to get attention deserve a quick brush off<br/>\nto play the game rather than look to officials for hints and in-game help.<br/>\n<br/>\nNevertheless, they are not doing a very good job of helping people with<br/>\nlegitimate problems that, as in your case, lead to hours or days of being<br/>\nunable to play.  Verant needs to find a way to get communication and<br/>\nlegitimate help flowing back to the players.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBob</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
