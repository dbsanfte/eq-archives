What if I was pulling centaurs","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2044518506\">Problem is on non-PVP servers if someone wanted to casts SoW on a bard for malicious effect we could do nothing to stop them. What<br/>\nif I was pulling centaurs for a group and a druid wanted me dead for some reason, all he would have to do is wait for me to start<br/>\nthe pull and then cast SoW, I would be one dead duck. It is unfair in a non PVP enviroment that someone can cast something on me<br/>\nwithout my permission that leaves me with reduced capabilities. Some newbies was being &quot;helpful&quot; and cast SoW on me as I was<br/>\nstanding at the gates to Freeport talking with my friend. I can&#39;t begin to describe my rage at not being able to run anywhere at the<br/>\nspeed I am accustomed (for 45 minutes!!), it is very disconcerting and I can do nothing about it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Kirk Baptista &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dopey@...\">dopey@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, September 13, 1999 11:04 PM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Breaking root broken<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Kirk Baptista &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dopey@...\">dopey@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Actually,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On PVP a great tactic would be to SOW a bard, then snare/root him.
