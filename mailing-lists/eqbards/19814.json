Even so, a number of<br/>\nchanges and additions were made in today&#39;s patch. Most of the changes are in<br/>\nregards to quests: <br/>\n<br/>\n- The &quot;Fleshy Orb&quot; quest has been completed - We&#39;ve received word that<br/>\n&quot;Fabian&quot; has been spotted somewhere on Norrath. - Froglok Foragers and<br/>\nHunters should been seen more regularly. - Lord Grimrot should be seen more<br/>\nfrequently. - Skill in tailoring is no longer required to craft The Robe of<br/>\nthe Lost Circle. <br/>\n<br/>\nA few items have also been changed this week: <br/>\n<br/>\n- The Robe of the Lost Circle has been enhanced. - The Staff of Temperate<br/>\nFlux and the Rod of Insidious Glamour now have a short casting time<br/>\nassociated with their activatable effect (See Below). - The Gunthak Harpoon<br/>\nis again NORENT, meaning that it will disappear when you log off (See<br/>\nBelow.) <br/>\n<br/>\n*Casting Times on Staff and Rod* <br/>\n<br/>\nWe received word a few weeks ago that some people were using these items to<br/>\n&quot;spam&quot; other players with their spell-effect messages, causing them to<br/>\ndisconnect. Though /ignore will allow you to filter out text messages caused<br/>\nby people on your /ignore list, it will not allow you to filter out<br/>\nspell-effect messages for spells cast upon you. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe short casting time should prevent the problems associated with the<br/>\ntargetable and activatable effect on these weapons, however you will have to<br/>\nstand still to use them now. <br/>\n<br/>\n*Gunthak Harpoon* <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the last item patch, we made the mistake of making this weapon<br/>\n&quot;rentable&quot;, meaning that it does not disappear upon logoff. Basically, one<br/>\nof our game designers heard that the weapon was NORENT, concluded that it<br/>\nmust be a bug, and took the initiative to fix it. Unfortunately, the stats<br/>\non this weapon, despite its disadvantages of weight and its non-magical<br/>\ncomposition, make it much too powerful for its location and difficulty in<br/>\nobtaining it. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor these reasons, the weapon is once again NORENT, and will disappear the<br/>\nnext time that you log out. This is a retroactive change and will affect<br/>\nweapons already in possession. We do apologize to those who acquired it<br/>\nwithin the last week expecting that it would be a permanent weapon. <br/>\n<br/>\n*Chat / Login Process* <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Chat and Login server components are now completely separate, meaning<br/>\nthat players will no longer have difficulty logging in due to an excess of<br/>\npeople in the chat server. <br/>\n<br/>\n- The EverQuest Team</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
