I have heard from some that it is only Wind, and now we have someone<br/>\nwho claims it also works for Brass...can anyone confirm this?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI also have a question on this:  can you use the mino horn to raise the <br/>\nbrass skill?  Currently my brass is maxed for my level, but I&#39;ve been <br/>\nlugging around a brass instrument just for this purpose, would be nice if I <br/>\ncould sell it back to the vendor.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did try the song with the mino horn, and it does work.  But I&#39;m not sure <br/>\nif its because I&#39;m singing it while just holding the horn, or if I&#39;m <br/>\nactually using the horn.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-Treehugger and Songmaker</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
