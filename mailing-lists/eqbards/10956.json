As just an example, all of the Lambent armor I have right now (gloves, legs, and arms) came about because of Lambent Stones that guildmates of mine found while hunting and held on to because they knew I would need them.  I can&#39;t tell you how many times I have been /t&#39;s by one of my guildmates to meet them somewhere only to find out that they had Crested Spaulders, or a dwarven chainmail tunic, or an Obsidian Shard, or something else that they wanted to give to me.  Not only that, but I have also given away many, many items to guildmates that I didn;t want and/or need.  (When was the last time you heard of someone giving away a Polished Bone Bracer or a BI Medallion?)  And as far as grouping together goes, just the other night a few of us got together and had a grand old time in the bartender&#39;s room in Sol A.<br/>\n    The mission of NOR is to help each other and to help others (&quot;NOR and non-NOR alike&quot; is part of our mission statement) enjoy whatever game we are in.  What is the mission of your guild?  If it&#39;s not something you agree with, or it&#39;s just there so folks can have that extra tag and see the pretty green letters scroll across the screen, then, IMO, it&#39;s not really worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n                    Just my 2cps worth,<br/>\n                    -=B=-<br/>\n                    NOR Bard, Esq.<br/>\n                    Barrd Talespinner<br/>\n                    30th level bard on The Rathe<br/>\n                    Creator of BS Titles<br/>\n                    And Still One Heckuva Nice Guy   ;o)<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Ken Bachman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbachman@...\">kbachman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Wednesday, December 01, 1999 5:09 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Guilds (was Twinking...)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Ken Bachman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbachman@...\">kbachman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Mike Roach wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; From: Mike Roach &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mike.roach@...\">mike.roach@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Even though I really like our guild Robynn, I have learned not to rely on<br/>\n&gt;&gt; them for anything.
