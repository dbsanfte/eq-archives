One huge factor in programming<br/>\npsychology is that you have to &quot;believe&quot; that there is a bug before you can<br/>\n&quot;find&quot; the bug.  On some of the stuff, he believes.  On other stuff, it&#39;s<br/>\nlike he does not listen.  He has his mind made up and gives us the same old<br/>\nanswer he gave us before. Example: lullaby - he keeps telling us that high<br/>\nlevel mobs have stronger resistence.  Fine.  But  he refuses to listen when<br/>\nwe say that level 5 gnolls are resisting in unusual ways.  It sure looks<br/>\nlike his mind is blocked on that one.  Sigh.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, maybe we are hitting him with too many things at one time.  It sure<br/>\nseems like he gets &quot;defensive&quot; and that does not help us make any progress<br/>\non those items.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\n&lt;The Pantheon&gt;<br/>\nBard of the 41st song<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\np.s. last night I managed to get a clops and Tarsulk on me in Rathe Mts.<br/>\nKiting them around so my group could zone, I managed to drop either my<br/>\nYkesha or my MM drum (at the time I was not sure which one dropped.)  For a<br/>\nsplit second, I thought about zoning but instead stopped and took a loc<br/>\nbefore they smooshed me.  I yelled to my group to zone back in and go to the<br/>\nloc and look on the ground for whatever I dropped.  Turned out to be my MM<br/>\ndrum and they found it!
