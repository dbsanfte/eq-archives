Congrats on levelin hally. I<br/>\nplanned on getting massive xp this weekend (long hours) but my connection<br/>\nwas horrible, i kept crashing every 5-10 minutes. I ended up getting only a<br/>\nquarter bub through the whole weekend. The spikes resided a wee bit sunday<br/>\nand i was able to go to felwithe and raise my swimming skill while i went<br/>\ngrocerie shopping. Went from 116 to 186 just singing jig to keep stamina up.<br/>\ngotta love those gloves in a sick and disturbing way.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the bright side, i never go to faymart and i logged in this morning to<br/>\ntry to get a gate to lava, couldnt find one so i went and got a shackle from<br/>\nthe hero (what a wuss). That made my weekend/day. Spare bracer woot!<br/>\n<br/>\nMinkin<br/>\nSol ro<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Cranfill, Wendy [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Wendy_Cranfill@...\">Wendy_Cranfill@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: October 30, 2000 5:00 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Wow - o - wow<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWell twinkie bardette had a good weekend!  I am finally a mana-battery!<br/>\n*cheers*<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso got her an erudite mask and thank god its a good face cuz Tani&#39;s guise<br/>\ngives her the ugliest DE face (Hally has the second ugliest!) so I&#39;m glad I<br/>\ngot a good one for a change! [insert anti-twink comments here]<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those of you looking for good xp in the early 30s, try the giant<br/>\nfortress in Frontier Mountains... its OMG good xp.  We had a balanced group<br/>\n(31 bard, 31 monk, 34 warrior, 27 cleric) and pretty much fought nonstop.<br/>\nSet up shop right inside.  Got just over a bubble an hour but you gotta<br/>\nwatch out for those Mountain Giant Craigs (ouch!).<br/>\n<br/>\nDid anyone participate in the ToT finals on test?  Hear they were great<br/>\nfights!!! My guild got bumped out after a couple rounds to a PvP team but<br/>\nweere still happy :)  <br/>\n<br/>\nHope everyone had a good weekend :)<br/>\n<br/>\nTani, 32nd Bardette-mana-battery<br/>\nHalana, 57th Shaman <br/>\nSolusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
