My thoughts.<br/>\n<br/>\nLots of Bard news from yesterday&#39;s patch.  Of course as usual none of the<br/>\nchanges were listed in the patch message (Gordon if you read this put a big<br/>\nyellow post-it note on your computer monitor that reads: &#39;ANY BARD CHANGES?&#39;<br/>\n*grin*).  Anyway here is the good, bad, and the ugly:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Good<br/>\nAh at last a reason to go buy a Psalm ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Bad<br/>\nACK!  Chains was a big time annoyance for me last nite.  This nerf did hit<br/>\nhard.  My mobs went from stopping at 33% or so to stopping at 25% to 20%.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Ugly<br/>\nKellin&#39;s has been referred to our testing department.<br/>\n*About time, lets hope they fix lullaby this time.<br/>\nLet&#39;s hope so.  Pulled it out after the patch as usual to try it again.  Got<br/>\n80% resists on a mobs 15 levels below me.  Useless, dememmed immediately.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe &quot;Broken Quest Issues&quot; are not broken quests. They are preexisting<br/>\nstories for future expansion.<br/>\n*Not sure if this applies to Fabian or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, I don&#39;t buy this answer.  These partial quests have been around<br/>\nforever.  You wouldn&#39;t think there would be much story behind replacing a<br/>\nguy&#39;s lute strings anyhow.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
