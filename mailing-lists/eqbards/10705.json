They are not concerned about you avoiding a train.

Fast travel allows someone to lead the entire dungeon to the<br/>\nzone exit, causing many people to die.<br/>\n<br/>\nThink about some of the worst zones for random deaths from trains, Mistmoore, Unrest, BlackBurrow.  All these zones are &quot;outdoors&quot;<br/>\nand allow speed effects.  The trainmaker can run fast and make it to zone, and lets everyone else deal with the trainwreck.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the dungeons that are &quot;underground&quot;  there are usually less trains to zone (there are exceptions).  This is because the person<br/>\nwho gets over his head can&#39;t run fast enough to make it to zone.  They will die 20 feet away and the train never happens.<br/>\n<br/>\nA caster gating out has the same effect as death.  The monster drops the player off the hate list.  Unless someone else is also on<br/>\nthe hate list (or too close), the monster will return to it&#39;s normal spot.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
