Me 51, &#39;nother Bard 51,<br/>\nthird bard 50 and wizard 50.  I had a map - get one.  We zoned in and iirc<br/>\ntook the left passage - then killed some bugs - then took a right (check<br/>\nmap) and headed for the library on a whim.  There were several bugs to kill<br/>\nalong the way and some spec&#39;s too.  Nothing to break a sweat for our levels<br/>\nalthough we lamented and tried to pull singles as best we could.  We pulled<br/>\nto clear the outside of the library then moved up closer.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the porch, we agro&#39;d something and as we fought we also agro&#39;s the &#39;??<br/>\nlibrarian&#39; and killed &#39;em both.  The something turned out to be the froog<br/>\nthat dropped the coin for the quest.  Something else there dropped a book<br/>\n(?? iirc) that had good int +5 or +6 and that made our wiz happy.  Then we<br/>\nwent in the library and looked around.  Perhaps killed something else -<br/>\ncan&#39;t remember.  We did happen to go up stairs and looked around the<br/>\nbalcony.  On the ground, we found something for one of the medallion<br/>\nquests - &quot;piece of a medallion&quot; or something.  BTW - we were the only ppl in<br/>\nthe zone - sad but true - and it looked to be a very cool zone for ppl who<br/>\ncan get exp at this level.  You&#39;d want a good party, some anti-poison<br/>\nsongs/spells but it looked to be good.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe went outside and started to look around. Then we got our obligatory<br/>\nover-pull.  About 6 things agro&#39;d and we were swarmed by greenies.  Evac was<br/>\nno problem as we got what we wanted and it was time to go anyhow.  Next<br/>\ntime, we wil be heading to Dalnir&#39;s for the Royal Crown.  Then Suladan will<br/>\nhave all 6 coins.  Kaldivar needs Kasora and Dalnir.  I have Selos Drums so<br/>\nits not as high a priority for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I dont know if the froog that drops the coin in Kaesora roams the whole<br/>\ndungeon or he is always found in the library area - but that&#39;s where we<br/>\nfound him.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Richard Read&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:richard.read@...\">richard.read@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, May 29, 2000 9:37 AM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Re: Dalnir: any bard toys?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I am doing this quest at the moment and have 4 of the coins.

Luckily I am part of a regularish group of level 43 to 52<br/>\nplayers<br/>\n&gt; so I&#39;m not too worried about getting killed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also spoilers on the location of the coin in Kaesora would be most<br/>\nwelcome. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
