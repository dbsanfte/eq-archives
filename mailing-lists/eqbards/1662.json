Its clear there is an<br/>\neasily definable line between the roleplayers and the powergamers here.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t like the idea of bards wearing plate personally, it doesn&#39;t fit any<br/>\nimage of the class from a roleplaying perspective as far as I can see, and<br/>\nwhile sure its nice to be able to absorb more damage, it&#39;d be nice to have a<br/>\nbazooka too.  Whether bards can ultimately wear plate or not at some point<br/>\nis moot to me, I won&#39;t &#39;cause it doesn&#39;t fit my image of a bard.  to me that<br/>\nimage is more important than being as effective as possible.  I kinda wish<br/>\nthey&#39;d institute something similar to the monk&#39;s increased AC when wearing<br/>\nlight armor for bards as an option, not necessarily better than plate or<br/>\neven equal, just better than nothing.  If not, oh well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like the idea of having some bard specific items.  Singing swords, magical<br/>\ninstruments, any of these would be great!  Most of the other classes seem to<br/>\nhave items tailored towards them with the exception of bards.  Oh yeah sure<br/>\nwe can use some warrior&#39;s castoff magic weapon, but so can a monk, and just<br/>\nlike a monk, why would we?  It&#39;d sure be nice to see something that bard&#39;s<br/>\ncould make better use of than anyone else.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn most of the other issues I&#39;m pretty close to neutral except for binding.<br/>\nThe way I see a bard, and certainly the way Verant seems to portray them,<br/>\nthey should travel more than any other character.  To have to do this<br/>\nwithout being able to bind is difficult, and one would think a travelling<br/>\nminstrel could bind himself anywhere.<br/>\n<br/>\n                  Kitasi<br/>\n     The mournful bard of Faydwer on E&#39;ci<br/>\n      &quot;and no one shall work for money, <br/>\n       and no one shall work for fame&quot;<br/>\n     &quot;but each for the joy of the working,             <br/>\n        and each to his seperate star...&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
