Meant to say melee/hybrids get the option to<br/>\naccept/decline the bind similar to the resurrect spell.  This avoids<br/>\nmalicious binds deep in enemy territory.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I think one of Verant&#39;s concerns is that if they change the bind policy,<br/>\n&gt; it<br/>\n&gt; would be easier for groups to take out the uber-mobs like Lady Vox.<br/>\n&gt; Melee/hybrid classes could just loot their corpse and reenter the battle.<br/>\n&gt; What<br/>\n&gt; if the rules were changed to reflect something like along these lines:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1) Any class can get bound anywhere.  Melee/hybrids get the option to<br/>\n&gt; Players<br/>\n&gt; without the bind spell<br/>\n&gt; 2) If a character gets killed, and the mob that killed them is still alive<br/>\n&gt; when<br/>\n&gt; they reappear at their bind point,  that character can no longer do damage<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; the mob.  This would not apply if the character was resurrected. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There are probably several different ways this could be worked but I think<br/>\n&gt; something along these lines would be required as a tradeoff for the change<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; the binding policy <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Very good point.  From what I have gathered, it seems the biggest<br/>\n&gt; complaint<br/>\n&gt; &gt; about giving a melee class the ability to bind, or be bound by a caster,<br/>\n&gt; is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that it would change the fighting dynamic.  And it obviously would.<br/>\n&gt; That<br/>\n&gt; &gt; being said, the one major point that has not been proposed by other<br/>\n&gt; players<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is a sense of difficulty or loss with getting a melee player bound.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Add in song difficulty and reagents, coupled with real EXP loss to the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; person getting bound (2 full bubbles of lost exp would really make a<br/>\n&gt; melee<br/>\n&gt; &gt; person question getting bound or not, of course the song singer should<br/>\n&gt; take<br/>\n&gt; &gt; considerable less exp loss :=) ). and the argument becomes less clear.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Just my 2 cents.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
