I guess a lot of us were doing this last night.  I<br/>\nhad 3%-10% packet loss, causing my zone times to fall in the<br/>\n30-60 second range (I&#39;m also beginning to suspect the number<br/>\nof players in the zone also affect the time).  Nevertheless,<br/>\nfor a level 36 bard with a Mistmoore drum:<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom the West Freeport gate, through Rivervale and Beholder&#39;s<br/>\nMaze, to the gates of Qeynos took 25 min 30 sec.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThen I turned right around and took the Highpass route back.  <br/>\n24 min 15 sec:<br/>\n<br/>\nAmong other stats:<br/>\n<br/>\nWest Karana, from zone to zone (excluding zone times) takes<br/>\n4 min 30 sec (heading due East/West).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe ramp up to Highpass (from the start of the ramp to the<br/>\nzone line at Highpass) in East Karana takes 3 min 12 sec.<br/>\n<br/>\nQeynos to Freeport via Highpass is 9 zones.  At an average 45<br/>\nseconds to zone, that&#39;s 6 min 45 sec spent zoning.  Total<br/>\n&quot;travel&quot; time is thus only 17 min 30 sec.<br/>\n<br/>\nFreeport to Qeynos via Beholder&#39;s is 12 zones.  At an average<br/>\n45 seconds to zone, that&#39;s 9 minutes spent zoning.  Total<br/>\n&quot;travel&quot; time is thus only 16 min.  However, this route ends<br/>\nup being slower due to the extra zone times, unless you can<br/>\naverage less than 30 sec per zone (maybe an Athlon 700? :-).<br/>\n<br/>\nI run at almost exactly twice normal speed, so if you run at<br/>\nnormal speed, the &quot;travel&quot; times are 35 min via Highpass, 32<br/>\nmin via Beholder&#39;s.  If you can zone in about 45 seconds, then<br/>\nthe Beholder&#39;s route is faster at normal running speed by just<br/>\nshy of a minute.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still need to figure out the straight line route from the<br/>\nHighpass zone to the West Commonlands zone.  That was<br/>\nembarassing getting &quot;lost&quot; in there and having to use the<br/>\nwalls to find the exit.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nA level 28 bard with a normal drum sent me a /tell asking if I<br/>\nwas using a Mistmoore drum, since &quot;you blew past me like I was<br/>\nstanding still.&quot;  Given that a level 22 bard with a normal<br/>\ndrum takes just 6 minutes longer to make the trip, I think you<br/>\ncan begin to see how the perceived difference in speed doesn&#39;t<br/>\nreally add up to much in terms of time saved traveling.<br/>\n(That also happens to be true in RL - the guy who blew by you<br/>\non the freeway doing 80 to your 65 is going to get to a<br/>\ndestination 10 miles away less than 2 minutes ahead of you.)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
