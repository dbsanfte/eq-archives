On Tuesday night, the group I was with camped the GY and secret<br/>\nroom right next to the GY for about 2 hours.  We killed numerous deathly<br/>\nushers but not once did the black silk gloves get dropped.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night tried it again.  While waiting in the GY for everyone to med up,<br/>\na glyphed aegis spawned.  We killed it and it dropped the black silk gloves<br/>\n(which I looted).  We then went into the secret room.  Our first kill in<br/>\nthere was a deathly usher.  It also dropped the gloves.  The second spawn in<br/>\nthe room was a will sapper.  It also dropped the gloves.  Third spawn in the<br/>\nroom was another deathly usher.  This one dropped the gloves plus an ivy<br/>\nrune that rangers need for their armor quests.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess this is an example of Verant&#39;s screwy random generator at work.  One<br/>\nnight two hours and no gloves.  Next night four gloves on four straight<br/>\nspawns.  Unfortunately, the last three went to waste as there were no other<br/>\nbards in the zone.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was also surprised that mobs other than the deathly usher dropped the<br/>\ngloves.  I was initially under the impression that only ushers would do so.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
