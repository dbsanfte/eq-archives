FYI - I have heard<br/>\n&gt; that the Hell plus One levels are one-bub death penaltys for each time you<br/>\n&gt; die - maybe only 46?  Or 41 and 46? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Definitely a full bubble loss at 46.   Remember I said I would reach 47 last night? <br/>\nWell the server crashed while we were doing fire giants in Sol B and Nagafen was<br/>\npopped when we all returned.  So I stuck around until crazy hours on the dragon<br/>\nraid.  Died 3 times *ouch* but only down one bubble total after the resurrections. <br/>\nAnd I was alive when he finally fell: that felt good, seeing him fallen at my feet.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd YES I now have Selo&#39;s Drums of the March.
