Binding and Chain DO become more<br/>\n&gt; effective as you<br/>\n&gt; level.  I suspect though that it&#39;s a sudden jump at<br/>\n&gt; a certain<br/>\n&gt; level.  I first timed these around level 25 and got<br/>\n&gt; a 30%<br/>\n&gt; increase in time (3.0 -&gt; 3.9 sec).  I retested at<br/>\n&gt; around L30<br/>\n&gt; and L35 and got the exact same results.  So I<br/>\n&gt; assumed it was<br/>\n&gt; constant and didn&#39;t bother testing again.  I tested<br/>\n&gt; it again<br/>\n&gt; at 48 and lo and behold:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 30.3 sec - 10 attacks, normal<br/>\n&gt; 42.6 sec - 10 attacks, Binding<br/>\n&gt; 42.6 sec - 10 attacks, Chain<br/>\n&gt; 42.8 sec - 10 attacks, Binding + Chain<br/>\n&gt; 36.5 sec - 10 attacks, Cessation<br/>\n&gt; 36.5 sec - 10 attacks, Cessation, w/ lute<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In terms of % slowdown:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Normal = 0%<br/>\n&gt; Binding/Chain = 28.9%<br/>\n&gt; Cessation = 17.0%<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In terms of % increase in delay (which is what I<br/>\n&gt; used for the<br/>\n&gt; figures on Rokenn&#39;s site):<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Normal = 0%<br/>\n&gt; Binding/Chain = 40.6%<br/>\n&gt; Cessation = 21.7%<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And just for comparison:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Torgors = ~100% (3.0 sec -&gt; 6.0 sec, but timed over<br/>\n&gt; 1 attack)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A cookie to the first bard who figures out at what<br/>\n&gt; level the<br/>\n&gt; increase kicks in.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
