This is the base minimum you can have, and<br/>\ntherefore roll to  (ie: /random 1 20)<br/>\nFor your first raid, you get 30 points (this is to help folks who may not<br/>\nbelong to any of the 3 guilds, yet are along to help)<br/>\nIf you stay for a whole raid, you get 30 points (shorter raids get smaller<br/>\npoints)<br/>\nIf you stay for 2 hours to about halfway, you get half points<br/>\nIf you pass on a roll for your class (that isn&#39;t junk) you get an extra 5 or<br/>\n10 (can&#39;t remember which) points per pass (this helps folks who are only<br/>\nafter one or two items)<br/>\nWinning something knocks off 10 points (although I would like to see it<br/>\ndropped to base 20), and you are not allowed to roll again until everyone in<br/>\nthat class has won something (unless it&#39;s an uber item).<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the main reasons for this was fairness.  We wanted to be able to<br/>\nreward folks for coming on raids they wouldn&#39;t normally go on (Clerics in<br/>\nFear) without over-penalizing folks who can&#39;t make it due to RL.  We also<br/>\nwanted to set up a heirarchy so that folks who only needed a few items would<br/>\nhave a better shot, without using level as a point-modifier (therefore<br/>\nencouraging p-leveling just so you can be the highest level and get a better<br/>\nchance at something).  This gives EVERYONE a shot at an item, the more<br/>\nyou&#39;ve won, the less of a shot youhave.  The more you&#39;ve gone on and the<br/>\nmore loot you&#39;ve passed on, the better a shot you have.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have also broken loot into 3 gropups:<br/>\ntrash (ie: Imbrued bracers)<br/>\nCommon (legs, arms, bps, etc)<br/>\nrares (rare and god drops)<br/>\nTrash loses no points for being looted, and gains no points for passing<br/>\n(trash is determined by a class beforehand)<br/>\nThe rares and god drops will most likely be NBG or straight /random if more<br/>\nthan 1 is deemed in need<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=B=-<br/>\n49th Season of Bardic Fun<br/>\nNew OutRiders<br/>\nThe Rathe<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Matt DeBarger&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mattdeba@...\">mattdeba@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, May 08, 2001 8:55 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Guild Loot Rules<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; A couple of things:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My guild&#39;s loot is distributed by the raid leader.  Plain and simple.  You<br/>\n&gt; just need to trust your raid leaders to be fair :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Bards are a tough class to decide on loot rights.  For weapons any other<br/>\n&gt; melee class can use them better than us (since they all have dual attack),<br/>\n&gt; thus isn&#39;t the guild served best by having them go to the real melees.  No<br/>\n&gt; to mention, a portion of a bard&#39;s life he isn&#39;t even using weapons.  This<br/>\n&gt; definitly includes most large mobs, which really make a or break a guild.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Example:  We killed Wuoshi.  He(she?) dropped the Crscent Blade (a SWEET<br/>\n&gt; 1HS) and An Emerald Scimitar (very good ratio, but slow as hell, +100<br/>\nmana).<br/>\n&gt; The raid leader (clearly) awarded the crscent blade to one of our warriors<br/>\n&gt; who does have his epics yet and gave the scimitar to a druid who isn&#39;t in<br/>\n&gt; our guild but id on at least half our raids (we have about 10 players who<br/>\n&gt; are members of small guilds, but might as well be in our guild for raid<br/>\n&gt; purposes).  However, the warrior was asked to give his lammy (replaced by<br/>\n&gt; the crescent blade) to me, since I did not get the scimitar. (then we<br/>\n&gt; discovered bards can&#39;t wield lammy&#39;s, heh)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; A similar case can be made for armor.  Would the guild not be better<br/>\nserved<br/>\n&gt; by having a tank with a higher ac?  THough bards do take a beating too...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; However bards can&#39;t be totally shafted by loot either.  1.  No raid leader<br/>\n&gt; wants to shaft anyone.  2.  (at least on my server) Good bards are rare,<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; most guilds don&#39;t have enough (I go on raids with at least 3 other guilds,<br/>\n&gt; and we have a group of 4 bards who regularly join us from those same<br/>\nguilds.<br/>\n&gt; The 6 (2 from my guild) of us have discussed forming a union, hehehehe)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I like point systems and if I was in charge of a guild, we would use one.<br/>\n&gt; However, there is something nice about just doing &quot;whats best for the<br/>\nguild&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Elfson Allegro 55 (WOOHOO!!!) &lt;The Circle of Eternity&gt; Veeshan<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
