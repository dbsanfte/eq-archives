Does it matter if people are duplicating singing steel ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1126099486\">Its unbelievable how many times this arguement is used.  It seems to work<br/>\nwell for everything.  Does it matter if people are duplicating singing steel<br/>\nbreastplates?  Does it hurt me in any way?  Does it matter if people are<br/>\nexploiting monsters?  Does it hurt me in any way?<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, yes and no.  Me, personally, I could care less.  I&#39;ve completely moved<br/>\nbeyond planar armor, so I couldn&#39;t possibly care less what people are doing<br/>\nin the planes.  But does it effect people?<br/>\nI&#39;m going to argue yes it does.<br/>\nFor the majority of the players, EQ is a game designed 90% around items.  In<br/>\na game with no end like EQ, the main way to actually feel that you are<br/>\nmaking progress is by acquiring items.  Argue whatever you like, EQ is an<br/>\nitem based game.  Maybe not for everyone, lots of people just like to<br/>\nroleplay and have fun, but the vast majority of the population likes to<br/>\naquire items.  Just look at how many posts you see saying &quot;I just got item<br/>\nXX&quot; with dozens of replies saying &quot;Wow, congrats!&quot;<br/>\nThere&#39;s absolutely nothing wrong with this, we all like to get shiney new<br/>\ntoys, its one of the things that makes the game fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, how do farmers affect us?  Well, to most, planar armor is a badge of<br/>\narmor.  By wearing it, you&#39;re essentially saying &quot;I&#39;ve been to the planes,<br/>\nI&#39;ve fought hard, look at what I&#39;ve accomplished.&quot;  To this day, planar<br/>\narmor isn&#39;t exactly common, and wearing it sets you apart from the vast<br/>\nmajority of the EQ population.  It says in its own little way that you&#39;ve<br/>\naccomplished something different, maybe accomplished more than a lot of<br/>\npeople.  Planar armor can be worn with pride, knowing you paid the price for<br/>\nit many times over in blood.  People who can obtain this armor with<br/>\nabsolutely no effort, in effect, living off the hard work of others cheapens<br/>\nthe value of it.  Suddenly it doesn&#39;t mean so much to be decked out with a<br/>\nshiney new planar BP, when anyone can go in, and obtain the exact same thing<br/>\nby sitting on their asses for hours on end while a ranger pulls mobs one at<br/>\na time as they pop.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll this being said, this is how the planes are designed.  The fault lies<br/>\nwith Verant.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nElwyn &lt;Da`Kor&gt;<br/>\n59 Bard, Erollisi Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Big Daddy Legba [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:legba@...\">legba@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, August 28, 2000 12:37 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Plane of Fear<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy does it matter if people come in after your guild clears out fear?
