Meanwhile my druid and wizard buddies <br/>\n&gt; took their turns<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and did a few levels in timorous deep doing quad raptors solo.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Druids quad kited raptors SOLO? Are you sure about that? <br/>\n&gt; Raptors have on<br/>\n&gt; the average about 4k hp. A druid over 49 has one AoE, Lightning Blast,<br/>\n&gt; that does 477 dmg for 225 mana. so assuming no resists, that would be<br/>\n&gt; 1800 mana. The other AoE is much less efficient. Lightning Blast is<br/>\n&gt; magic based so it tends to get a lot of partial resists. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s impossible but it sure looks like you&#39;d be cutting<br/>\n&gt; it real close with mana. It&#39;s way more efficient now for a <br/>\n&gt; druid to use<br/>\n&gt; root/dotting (rotting). I can solo pull a raptor, stack 3 dots on it,<br/>\n&gt; and med back to about 1 1/2 bubbles of mana by the time it dies if I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; lucky on resists and root breaks. The L49 (and 56) roots last over 2<br/>\n&gt; minutes with a break check every 30 seconds so unless you run into a<br/>\n&gt; clump of bad rolls, it&#39;s pretty likely the first or second <br/>\n&gt; root will run<br/>\n&gt; the whole 2 minutes.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve never seen druids quad kiting when I&#39;ve been out there. <br/>\n&gt; I see a lot<br/>\n&gt; of wizards kiting about 6-8 around though. Now that&#39;s impressive. But<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve also seen how hard it is for Wizards to get groups so I guess it<br/>\n&gt; balances out.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Has anyone worked out if the chant dot dmg keeps going up <br/>\n&gt; after 50? I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; often thought about getting a bard to come out and team up on<br/>\n&gt; root/dotting with me, as all 3 dots and mana song would probably speed<br/>\n&gt; things up considerably.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -- <br/>\n&gt;   Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n&gt;             GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n&gt;                  b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -------------------------- eGroups Sponsor <br/>\n&gt; -------------------------~-~&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Tellme Sports.
