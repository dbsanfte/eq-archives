This gives<br/>\nyou a better view of possible approaching mobs, gives some<br/>\nmembers an attack bonus for attacking from behind, and lets<br/>\nyou see your buff songs pulse on your party members.  The<br/>\npulses are in synch with the song messages, so you can use<br/>\nthose as a signal to start your next song.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother option is to weave one more song that you&#39;re capable<br/>\nof, and watch for the disappearing/reappearing icons to signal<br/>\nwhen a song effect has kicked in.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
