The number <br/>\nof plats and items in a world (take Povar, one of the original<br/>\nservers) doesn&#39;t grow linearly, until bulk of the population settles<br/>\non one level.  Lets throw some made up numbers out.  If the<br/>\npop. mean levels out at 30, and the std deviation is, say 5 levels,<br/>\nthen 95% of the population will be 20-40.  There is a LOT of <br/>\nplat and magic items available to those levels.  Now, Verant said<br/>\n6 mo. of playing would take a player to 50.  Given how wrong<br/>\nthey were, it seem likely to me that the pop. mean will level off at<br/>\na fairly high level well before the expansion, then just keep generating<br/>\nplats and items, devaluing them until you simply won&#39;t see level<br/>\n10&#39;s without full banded and nice toys.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think this is especially true of servers that were up from the start,<br/>\nas there were tremendous money exploits that people took <br/>\nadvantage of to become master smiths, tremendously devaluing<br/>\nbanded armor.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, that proliferation of high level, cheap loot will destroy any<br/>\nusefulness that smithing and jewelcraft currently hold.  Forget<br/>\nadding features to these skills (smithing weapons, magic weapons<br/>\nand armor) as there will simply be no place for them in the<br/>\nplayer economy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really think that there not only needs to be item and money<br/>\nsinks, but harder level limits on magic items.  I&#39;d also prefer to<br/>\nsee any magic weapon worth anything be useable by one<br/>\nplayer only (like the no-drop what-zit 7/21 sword).  Personally<br/>\nI think they should have put an owner field on the weapons,<br/>\nand the first person who kills something with it is the only<br/>\none able to equip it.  This allows banking it, as well as having<br/>\na friend recover it from your corpse.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeeing how easy it was for me to get my shaman to 6th<br/>\nin a completely new zone, with no twinking, I think that<br/>\nthe next server that comes on-line, I&#39;ll start a new char<br/>\nthere.  At least some of the over-abundance of powerful<br/>\nitem will be eliminated, as the worst exploits have been<br/>\nremoved (I hope)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
