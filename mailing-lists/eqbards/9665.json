Has *any* imbrued armor dropped since the patch on this past<br/>\nWednesday? The armor was supposedly moved to the plane of hate since it is no longer dropped on<br/>\nboogeymen, but none has dropped yet on any mobs on my server (Tarew Marr). I&#39;m starting to<br/>\nbelieve Verant forgot to put our stuff in after they jacked it from boogeymen.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding the Maestro, how far in is he? You said it took 8 hours. And how hard is he? Does he<br/>\ncast any special type of spells?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, when pulling mobs, have you had any weird bugs, where a single mob is pulled, and about 3<br/>\nminutes into the fight, 5 - 10+ mobs come outta no where and wipe out everyone? Even with monks<br/>\nfeign pulling, and staying feigned while the rest of us fought so to keep aggro clear, we still<br/>\nget trained everytime.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaev Lorekeeper<br/>\nTarew Marr<br/>\n<br/>\nGarramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas) wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Garramone@...\">Michael.Garramone@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; i think you are referring to scorn banshees (look like fetid fiends).  i got<br/>\n&gt; a bard only martune rapier from a banshee (piercing dmg8 del23 5str 4agi).<br/>\n&gt; i do not know if they now drop our imbrued armor as i heard boogeymen no<br/>\n&gt; longer drop it but now have necro armor in pof.  the maestro of rancor i<br/>\n&gt; think is our real best friend.  the first night groups on our server went, i<br/>\n&gt; did not go and am still kicking myself several days later.  he dropped a<br/>\n&gt; bard only sword (1h slashing dmg11 del25, i think called sword of the six<br/>\n&gt; notes).  our best weapon to date, no bards there and it was destroyed =(<br/>\n&gt; the next night i did go and after i got the rapier (on the very first kill<br/>\n&gt; of the night) we got to the maestro about 8 or so hours later.  no sword,<br/>\n&gt; but i did get Kelin&#39;s Seven Stringed Lute (dex9 cha15 agi9).  i kinda got<br/>\n&gt; excited and destroyed my normal mandolin before testing and have not gotten<br/>\n&gt; around to buying another since (sorry mr. kim hehe).  i did try healing and<br/>\n&gt; i got 25 or 26 per pulse.  i can&#39;t remember what a level 50 with normal<br/>\n&gt; mandolin heals per tick but i thought it was 22.  i&#39;ll get around to testing<br/>\n&gt; the effects as soon as i remember to buy a new mandolin =)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Shada Bladestorm, L50 Wood Elf Bard<br/>\n&gt; Tyria Sarkin, L27 High Elf Wizard<br/>\n&gt; Erisi Dlarit, L24 High Elf Paladin<br/>\n&gt; Manda D&#39;ulin, L21 Wood Elf Warrior<br/>\n&gt; Mithaniel Marr Server </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
