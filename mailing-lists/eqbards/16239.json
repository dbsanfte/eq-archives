Probably running some<br/>\nkind of graphical database query stuff so the CS ppl can access customer<br/>\nrecords easily. IRIX would be for the art staff, probably for rendering,<br/>\nas the artist job requirements list mostly PC type programs like 3d<br/>\nstudio max, so they would likely be using NT as well. Linux probably for<br/>\nthe programmers. They have said their world building software was<br/>\ncustom, so it&#39;s a toss up whether that runs on IRIX or NT (possibly<br/>\nLinux as Linux has had glide libraries for several years and OGL for<br/>\nabout the same) If the programmers are working on Linux I&#39;d even bet<br/>\nthere&#39;s a partially functional linux client by this time, just cause<br/>\nsomeone would have seen it as a challenge (plus it would save time for<br/>\nthe programmer for the small amount of testing they do) I know that&#39;s<br/>\nhow the UO linux client came about.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrad always says he can&#39;t answer when questioned about the server set up<br/>\nbut employment ads can give away an awful lot I think. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
