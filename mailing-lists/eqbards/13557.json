I ve tried a couple they","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2032353262\">Ok, that&#39;s not a problem.  First, they haven&#39;t successfully implemented any<br/>\nnew quests a 21st level bard can do in a very long time.  I&#39;ve tried a<br/>\ncouple they did add to see if they might be viable, but both were broken so<br/>\nI couldn&#39;t even find out if they were of an appropriate level for me.  I&#39;ve<br/>\ndone every other quest, or gotten as far as I could in them, that I might be<br/>\nable to do.  <br/>\nOn the area of zones.  Yes, I can hunt on reaver hill.  Mistmoore is too<br/>\ndeadly for me as higher levels train things out of the castle too frequently<br/>\nto make the entry area safe.  Unrest is packed, last three times I was there<br/>\nthere were 50+ people in them.  Sol A and Sol B are obviously beyond my<br/>\ngroups ability at 21-24.  Haven&#39;t tried Paw since they lowered the<br/>\ndifficulty but there was no way before.  Befallen is also fairly crowded and<br/>\nmost everything there is too low to give me much xp anyhow.  Tried hunting<br/>\nskeletons in rathe but there were too many groups there as well.  Went to S<br/>\nKarana but there were 75+ people there mostly hunting aviaks.  Maybe there<br/>\nare some other places I have not found yet, but since I play mostly in mst<br/>\nprime-time I unfortunately have to play at the most crowded time.  Guess<br/>\nwhat?  So does everyone else who is a 2-3 hr a day, 3-4 day a week player<br/>\nlike me.  Also most of them are between 18-33 level or so.  That means that<br/>\nthe times I can play are most crowded for the level I am.  A lot of times<br/>\nwhen I am on there is no one in Kithicor and I have seen as few as 12 in<br/>\nLower Guk.  I guess a lot of the higher level players on E&#39;ci play later<br/>\nthan I do maybe.  I went into L Guk a month ago and there were 6 players at<br/>\n7pm, but at midnite when I logged off there were 35.  I don&#39;t think crowding<br/>\nis limited to level 46+, but since so much xp is required at that level<br/>\nrange, any overcrowding is painful.  Also it would be easier if I was<br/>\nplaying a class with downtime.  When I play y enchanter or druid the<br/>\ncrowding seldom bothers me as I spend enough time medding that its not as<br/>\nbig a deal.  The group my bard plays with though has so little downtime that<br/>\nwe waste a lot of time when we are fully capable of knocking something off,<br/>\nonly there isn&#39;t anything available.  That frustration has cost me more<br/>\nguildmates than I care to think about.<br/>\nIts really frustrating hearing about all the new quests on the plane of sky<br/>\nwhen quests are my favorite part of the game.  Lame as many of them are they<br/>\nare still more fun than camping.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my 2cp,<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Naeeldar [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jackal@...\">jackal@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, January 24, 2000 11:37 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] PoA bard quests plus a rant<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Naeeldar&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jackal@...\">jackal@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI know but believe me what do you low levels need a change of pace? You have<br/>\nmultiple dungeons. I don&#39;t care for a change of pace all I want is to be<br/>\nless crowded and they can change that with more zones. You guys have so many<br/>\noptions of zone that it&#39;s not even funny but lets say for 46+ we have the 3<br/>\nplanes now and sol b and guk. But wait there are people 30+ in guk and sol<br/>\nb. So all we really have is 3 zones. Now for 30ish people you have a variety<br/>\nof outdoor zones, for dungeons you have permafrost, CT, Unrest, MM, Sol A,<br/>\nGuk, Lower Guk, Sol B. See the problem? I play a mid level char a 50 char<br/>\nand a low level char and there are no problems with the low or mid levle<br/>\nchars. High level chars there is a problem though. It&#39;s not like were<br/>\ncomplaining we need a change of pace we want something new for the hell of<br/>\nit we don&#39;t but you are. Seriously what problems do you have at mid or low<br/>\nlevels? Not many high levels are plagued with overcrowded. Hell I love the<br/>\nlower guk zone and I&#39;d be happy if they just duplicated the zone a bunch of<br/>\ntimes.
