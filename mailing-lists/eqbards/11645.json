The Darkwood Staff<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;This could be affecting your ability to get someone to give<br/>\n&gt;you one.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;You also have to find out how much the merchants will give you<br/>\n&gt;for one if you sell it to them. IF it is on the order of multiple<br/>\n&gt;platinum, that may be another reason people are unwilling to sell cheaper<br/>\n&gt;to you.
