I will not say any of this is required. What I *WILL* say is <br/>\nthat my guild has been in Hate every night (except the very first) <br/>\nsince the new Hate has been release and this is how we have lived and <br/>\nhunted most of the zone.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) We have broken in from SWC and NEC.<br/>\n2) When you travel from gate in, do NOT go above half way up the <br/>\nwall. You *WILL* aggo level 2 MOBs.<br/>\n3) Same as usual, if you aggro on your way to SWC or NEC, either kill <br/>\nthe MOB and camp/come back, or die.<br/>\n4) When you get to SWC or NEC, camp and come right back. <br/>\n5) If you log for a bit, you can log on the floor in SWC or at the <br/>\ntop of the ramp. (yep, actually pretty safe.)<br/>\n6) You must clear most of first floor before hunting second -- you <br/>\ncan aggro MOBs from 1 while on 2, and I can tell you there are few <br/>\nthings as annoying as fighting a level 2 MOB with a cleric on floor 1 <br/>\ncasting CH. *Smiles* You can also aggro MOBs on 1 so that they <br/>\nactually TP to 2 and join in on the fun.<br/>\n7) If you are fluxed while fighting on 1, camp and come back. If you <br/>\nare in a group with a bard, the whole group camps and comes back.<br/>\n8) Anytime you have level 2 aggro on 1, camp and come back. I was <br/>\nactually punch killed in NEC from a level 2 MOB before I could get <br/>\nout.<br/>\n9) Once you start on level 2, the MOBs have almost no aggro range. <br/>\nYou practically have to hug them to get them aggro. *Smiles* Pull <br/>\ngroup is also different on 2. We have been using a warrior and a <br/>\ndruid. Pathing is BAD, so keep the puller close to the MOB, and keep <br/>\nthe MOB snared (if it takes a bad path, it does not run too far.)<br/>\n10) Don&#39;t touch the flames on level 2 (big blue fire.) This will take <br/>\nyou back to gate in, and will allow you to make some new &quot;friends&quot;. <br/>\n*Smiles*<br/>\n11) Speaking of the flames, there is a nice open area across from <br/>\nthem with almost no roamers. This is a good place to which to pull.<br/>\n12) The loot items are pretty nice. We have found the new BP, helm, <br/>\nbracers,  and boots(???) for rangers, a monk only ring (+3 all stats <br/>\nand saves?), a 27/29 (or close) paladin sword, etc...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBe well and Safe,<br/>\n<br/>\nGaelthorne<br/>\nXegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
