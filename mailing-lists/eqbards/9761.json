There have<br/>\nbeen a handful of occasions where I get the message (&quot;XXXX looks sad&quot;),<br/>\nattempt to pull another nearby MOB, and then both of them come running (even<br/>\nthe lamented one).  Just recently, I was trying to pull some elites out of<br/>\nthe king room.  I lulled the patriarch (got the &quot;sad&quot; message) and then<br/>\neverything started coming at me (including the patriarch).  Like I said,<br/>\nthis has only happened maybe 2 or 3 times in my whole career.  A druid<br/>\nfriend of mine also stated that she occasionally has the same thing happen<br/>\nwith Harmony.  It&#39;s somewhat similar to how Pixie Strike or Apalling Screech<br/>\napparently do nothing, even though you get the message.<br/>\n<br/>\nDesmei Sightblinder<br/>\nLvl 31 Bard [Povar]<br/>\n<br/>\n[snip]<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: Ryan Barker &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rbarker@...\">rbarker@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I used this song to great effect while in permafrost way back <br/>\n&gt; when I was<br/>\n&gt; level 16 (oh so long ago).  It was great.   Resist rates were <br/>\n&gt; rather low<br/>\n&gt; and I could usually pull 1 or 2 at a time which is good for <br/>\n&gt; perma.. I then<br/>\n&gt; began adventuring in outdoor zones where harmony is much more <br/>\n&gt; effective due<br/>\n&gt; to it being aoe and not agroing monsters if it fails.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[snip]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
