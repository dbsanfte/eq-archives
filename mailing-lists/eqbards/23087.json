Get<br/>\na druid to EB and time it religiously, get a mage that can summon water<br/>\nstones and give everyone several to start, etc, timing the eb is of the<br/>\nutmost importantce til you get ss gloves or fishbones. First floor just past<br/>\nthe zone in has mid 30s fishies. Remember this is a true 3D zone! Fish can<br/>\nbe above And below you. Stay out of the well down to the second floor til<br/>\nhigh 30&#39;s to 40&#39;s and pretty skilled underwater group. The very bottom of<br/>\nthe well has a pack of really hard hitting pirahnas and there&#39;s a couple of<br/>\nsharks on the second floor itself that are just as mean. The sharkskin drum<br/>\nis insanely rare and does still have a lute graphic.<br/>\n<br/>\nTamborine: Yes, I&#39;m 54 and still 2 coins shy of that thing! I&#39;ve been<br/>\nlugging that silly box around forever it seems. Finally a druid foraged the<br/>\nEJ one for me during the raid on the dragon there this weekend. No failed<br/>\nraiders up in Kaesora last night though. Still need to take out a scorp as<br/>\nwell, keep trying to talk the group into bagging one on our way into Howling<br/>\nStones but they&#39;ve been in a rush to get in everytime so far. I never log in<br/>\nand hang out, consequently I have a bank full of old armor and dropped<br/>\nspells and assorted stuff that could be sold or traded. If I don&#39;t log the<br/>\nbard in expressly to go do something, we go play twinks or move stuff<br/>\nbetween characters and then go do something. (4 accounts between the 2 of<br/>\nus, now that&#39;s addiction!)<br/>\n<br/>\nHE Clerics: my baby cleric is a shameless twink, cleric quest armor exept<br/>\nfor arms and bracers. Of course it&#39;s a bit heavy but better than bronze!We<br/>\nhave them somewhere, just not sure which char/account! Strength is her main<br/>\nissue, but I knew that as my mate is a HE cleric. She looks good though, and<br/>\nthat&#39;s majorly important! I can always steal the TBB from our Erudite pally<br/>\ntwink, hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrilinnia Ban&#39;Sidhe<br/>\nExcalibur, Xegony<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
