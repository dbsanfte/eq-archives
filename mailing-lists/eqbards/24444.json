There&#39;s <br/>\nrumors floating around saying a white scale is the rare drop, but <br/>\nthose always include reference to some un-named friend of a relatives <br/>\nvet who talked to a guy that was in The Hole when another group <br/>\nkilled Nortlav.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; He&#39;s said to be L55. Does he fight like VS? And since I&#39;ve <br/>\n </span></blockquote>personally been on no raids on VS, I don&#39;t know the tactics used on <br/>\nhim either. If anyone would be able to sneak in some secrets on how <br/>\nto kill this scalekeeper, or if he does in fact fight like Venril <br/>\nSathir, how to defeat him.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, and yes.  Heavy Runes and Defensive Disciplines I think are the <br/>\nmost common strategies for Venril.  I haven&#39;t killed him either, so <br/>\nmaybe someone else can confirm.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And is it true that the &quot;spawned&quot; or &quot;mini&quot; Trakanon is just L55, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>which drops only the guts for our quest? About how many would it <br/>\ntake, and approx Levels to defeat him at this level?<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s the same level and difficulty of the normal Trak.  Although, <br/>\nhe&#39;s unbuffed (just having spawned and all), you&#39;re able to clear his <br/>\nlair without him being in it, and you can spawn him where you want to <br/>\nfight him.  Those 3 things makes him easier to kill.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe drops a Kunark BP + Trak Guts.  You&#39;re looking at 30-40 people at <br/>\nan average level of 55.<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkfox Reven&#39;tsol<br/>\nXegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
