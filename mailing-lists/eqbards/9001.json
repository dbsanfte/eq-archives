I think they just botched a<br/>\nchange to the internals of how it works.  If you use Pixie<br/>\nStrike on yourself, one of three things happens.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) You resist it.  Nothing exciting there.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) It works (it really works).  You get the &quot;You are stunned&quot;<br/>\nmessage, the hand icon shows up, and you are stunned.  When<br/>\nthe effect wears off, the hand icon disappears, you can move<br/>\nagain, and you get the &quot;You are unstunned&quot; message.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) It works (but does nothing).  The hand icon shows up but<br/>\nnothing else happens.  When the hand icon disappears, you get<br/>\nthe &quot;You are no longer stunned&quot; message.<br/>\n<br/>\nNote the difference in wording.  That indicates to me that two<br/>\ndifferent subroutines are being called in case (2) and (3).  <br/>\nFor argument&#39;s sake, let&#39;s call (3) the &quot;old&quot; function and (2)<br/>\nthe &quot;new&quot; function.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the original Pixie Strike (and likely Lullaby) called<br/>\nthe old function.  About a month ago, Verant for some reason<br/>\ndecided to change the code governing this and wrote up the new<br/>\nfunction.  For good measure, they disabled the part of the old<br/>\nfunction that was causing the problems (mainly the part that<br/>\ndoes the stunning).  But somewhere, somehow, this old function<br/>\nis still being called, especially when fighting high-blue or<br/>\nhigher mobs, leading to the song not being resisted but having<br/>\nno effect.  Nobody caught this in testing because both<br/>\nfunctions still generated the same &quot;eyes glaze over&quot; message,<br/>\nwhich was assumed to be coming from the new function.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo find out if the same thing is happening with Lullaby,<br/>\nyou&#39;ll have to go to the Arena and test it on a volunteer<br/>\n(about the same level as the bard to maximize the incidence of<br/>\nthis bug).  That person should understand the above problem<br/>\nand the two different messages, and watch for them with the<br/>\nLullaby song.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
