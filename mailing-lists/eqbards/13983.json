I competed against 40-50<br/>\nnewbies in the newbie areas for bats, wasps, etc.  I stayed in GFAY and<br/>\nCrushbone until I was 10th level.  By the time I had made 10th level, I had<br/>\nless than 5 PP in the bank.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe other day I started up a newbie gnome mage.  I decided to do the bard<br/>\nmail quests a few times to get some gold and EXP.  Also decided to stay in<br/>\nGFAY and level up in the newbie area there.  This time there were maybe 4-5<br/>\nother people in the area.  I asked a cleric if he coud bind me in Kelethin.<br/>\nHe gladly did so without charging me.  He also voluntarily buffed me with a<br/>\nBravery and Guard.  With the extra HPs and AC, I started killing bats like<br/>\ncrazy.  I didn&#39;t even worry about sitting down to med and heal.  Soon<br/>\nsomeone auctioned they wanted to buy bat wings.  I told them I had 20 and<br/>\ninitiated the trade without even discussing price.  The person gave me 10PP<br/>\nfor them.  Last night I looted a few pixie dust.  Paladin auctioned he<br/>\nwanted to buy some.  Once again offered them to him without discussing<br/>\nprice.  Once again I got 10PP.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo now I&#39;ve gotten 20PP for a 4th level character that took my bard at least<br/>\n15 levels to acquire.  With the HP buffs, I haven&#39;t even died since 1st<br/>\nlevel.  I bought all my 4th level spells and still had plenty of money left<br/>\nover.  I then bought as much cloth armor as I could find.  Funny thing is<br/>\nnext time I went out to the newbie area I got accused of twinking:-)  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
