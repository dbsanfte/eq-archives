Been busy getting things done in my current zone.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs Sylly said, by far the best way to pull mobs in Mistmoore Castle is to<br/>\nhave a 49/50 player doing it so that they can pull single green  (to them)<br/>\nmobs.  Druids are good because they can wolf form, heal and have both good<br/>\nDoTs and nukes that they can use.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s how I did what you&#39;re doing at level 40/41 with a 50th Druid:<br/>\n<br/>\nInvis and enter the castle through the front door (there are back ways in<br/>\nbut they&#39;re more complex).  You must turn either right or left and walk<br/>\naround to the foyer area.  Once there, you will see a short corridor leading<br/>\nfurther into the castle.  Go down this corridor (just a few paces) and turn<br/>\nleft.  Before you, you will see a short hallway with an opening on your<br/>\nalmost immediate right.  If you move up a couple of paces and look to your<br/>\nright you will be looking into the ballroom where the Gypsy Musicians spawn,<br/>\nas well as Mynthi Davissi who carries both the Lute of the Gysy Princess and<br/>\nthe Mistmoore Battle Drums.  Don&#39;t go in just yet.  Instead move forward a<br/>\ncouple of more paces and you will see a blank section of wall on your right,<br/>\nand just a bit further a door on your right.  That door leads into the<br/>\nNegotiator&#39;s room and has a rediculous number of mobs in it.  The blank<br/>\nsection of wall to your right is actually a secret wall.  Turn right and<br/>\nmove through the secret wall and you will find yourself in a long narrow<br/>\nhallway that runs between the ballroom and the Negotiator&#39;s room.  On Fennin<br/>\nRo this was called the &quot;Safe Hall&quot; because no mobs spawn here and there is<br/>\nonly one lower level Familiar that we ever saw path through here on a<br/>\npatrol.  This was always our base camp for pulling mobs from the ballroom.<br/>\nIf you follow the hall all the way to the other end you will exit into the<br/>\nGargoyle Hall.  To your left will be another entrace to the Negotiator&#39;s<br/>\nroom, and to your right will be a set of double doors that lead into the<br/>\nballroom.  Mynthi Davissi spawns on this double-door end of the room, so we<br/>\nnormally set up camp on this end of the hall, and behind the secret wall.<br/>\nThe Druid then leaves the Safe Hall, turns right, opens the double doors and<br/>\nfires a DoT or nuke onto the mob that you want.  This is important since<br/>\nyou&#39;re lower level: He then pulls the mob into the Safe Hall where you kill<br/>\nit.  If you go into the hall or ballroom and attempt to fight the mob(s)<br/>\nthere, you WILL die when the Gargoyle Hall and everything in the ballroom<br/>\njumps you.  If you&#39;re lucky the Negotiator room won&#39;t come, but you&#39;ll still<br/>\ndie.  You simply repeat pulling in this manner all night long.<br/>\n<br/>\nPointers and observations:<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a long, long way to the zone but I made it several times.  MM is<br/>\noutdoors so keep Selo&#39;s memmed and a &quot;Train to zone!&quot; hotkey handy.<br/>\n<br/>\nMynthi Davissi is an enchanter.  If it&#39;s a two man operation like I had and<br/>\nyour Druid gets charmed, expect a couple of Starfires to hit you.  As a bard<br/>\nit&#39;s your job to make sure that your Magic Resist is as high as you can get<br/>\nit when fighting her.  Even so, as John Kim noted some months ago he got<br/>\ncharmed with his MR over 200.  Expect a charm or two to happen and be<br/>\nprepared to run for the zone creating one of those epic MM trains or die.<br/>\nIf you&#39;re in a larger group you can probably deal with a charm better than<br/>\nif you&#39;re in a smaller group.  My 50 Druid was charmed more than once.  Load<br/>\nPixie Strike and be prepared to use it to interrupt Mynthi and other party<br/>\nmembers should they get charmed.<br/>\n<br/>\nDO NOT sing songs when your puller goes to pull, even if he is a 50.  I<br/>\nstressed this to my Druid several times, but he kept forgetting.  Twice I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t stop my songs in time when I saw him leaving the Safe Hall and<br/>\neverything out there aggrod onto him despite his level.  Of course those<br/>\nmobs didn&#39;t go for him, they came for me.  It&#39;s not impossible for a 50 to<br/>\ndie in there if things go wrong.  My Druid came very close at least twice.<br/>\n<br/>\nDO NOT press up against (physically &quot;touch&quot;) either of the walls in the Safe<br/>\nHall while you&#39;re singing.  Twice, for no apparent reason, the entire<br/>\nNegotiator&#39;s room aggrod on me through that wall despite the fact that we<br/>\nwere just sitting there medding and I was singing nothing but Clarity.  Both<br/>\nof those times I was in contact with the wall adjoining that room.  After I<br/>\nfigured it out and stayed off the walls while singing everything went fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe hire someone in the zone to hold some flutes for you, or put some in<br/>\nyour general inventory slots and lose a duel at your bind point over in<br/>\nGreater Faydark.  Leave the flutes on your corpse and create a flute holding<br/>\ncorpse.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt night Mynthi Davissi spawns as a werewolf and is *not* an enchanter.  In<br/>\nthis form she was green to me at 40/41.  Therefore, she is easier to kill if<br/>\nshe spawns at night.  However, you have to kill the gypsy Mynthi in order<br/>\nfor her to be respawning at night as a werewolf.  She doesn&#39;t just turn into<br/>\none at 8pm or something.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe lute that Mynthi drops is the &quot;Lute of the Gypsy Princess&quot;.  It *is not*<br/>\nthe lute for the Lambent Breastplate quest.  The one you need is on the<br/>\nother generic &quot;a gypsy musician&quot; that are in the ballroom.  They visibly<br/>\nhold the lute when they have one.  The Lute of the Gypsy Princess used to be<br/>\na part of the Electrum Bladed Wakizashi quest, but the quest was changed and<br/>\nthe lute left in.  It has no special effect.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery time I&#39;ve killed Mynthi she has been visibly holding either the Lute<br/>\nor the Drums, but some have reported killing her and receiving stuff that<br/>\nwasn&#39;t visibly equipped.  Drums are the rare drop, but they&#39;re not<br/>\nuber-rare.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe gypsies will drop werewolf talons that you can use for the warrior<br/>\nCrafted Breastplate quest, so you might be able to enlist some warriors to<br/>\nhelp with that as enticement...<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish you the best of luck.  This is not an easy camp and Mistmoore remains<br/>\nbuggy, but let me tell you...  You will never be as satisfied with any piece<br/>\nof gear as you will be with those drums if you loot them yourself.  It&#39;s<br/>\nvery satisfying.<br/>\n<br/>\n[48 Bard] Crier (Half Elf) &lt;Seekers of Norrath&gt; ZONE: work</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
