I am ok with agi and dex but didn t know the cha is so","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2053245870\">My base is close to yours - when I created I thought the same thing and<br/>\ndumped into agi, dex and cha.  I am ok with agi and dex but didn&#39;t know the<br/>\ncha is so easily boosted and that str would also impact how hard your hit<br/>\nfor and how much weight you can carry - rtf-web page I guess.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, I was twinked with a full set of bronze one night.  I can&#39;t even wear<br/>\nall the stuff I have and not be encumbered with 20 milk and muffins.  So, I<br/>\nchoose to wear the visible pieces and get str boosters where ever I can.<br/>\nNow I am pretty good - str wise with no buffs or songs going.  I am still in<br/>\nsituations where I have to melee and am not always assured that I can be<br/>\nbuffed - so I want to be sure that I am not encumbered in the melee.<br/>\nEncumberment really penalizes your agi and dex (I think).  I have dex rings<br/>\nand str rings and carry both.  Depending on what I need - or think I need I<br/>\nwill switch them and go from str to dex - but I think it&#39;s a marginal<br/>\neffect.  if I am light weight - I go for more dex to hit better. if I get<br/>\nheavy, I go for str to stay unencumbered.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow if things change and I can find a regular group that lets me stand off<br/>\nand play instruments, I&#39;d add more pieces and up my AC.  I do think that AC<br/>\nis AC and the type of armor does not matter - beyond whatever special things<br/>\nit gives you (str, agi, dex, sv poison, magic whatever.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBronze is heavy and you may want to try for a mix.  Some blackened iron<br/>\nshould start hitting the market soon and maybe you can mix that in or work<br/>\nfor an all black look.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo to your question - AC is AC but weight per AC varies greatly.  Analyze<br/>\nweight to AC ratios and choose accordingly.  Look at each piece and you will<br/>\nsee some are lots more efficient than others. More AC per weight unit.  Agi<br/>\nis yor ability to dodge blows and Dex is your ablilty to hit your opponent.<br/>\nEncumberment will degrade your AGI and you DEX - avoid the melee when<br/>\nencumbered.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\nBard of the 20th level<br/>\na.k.a.
