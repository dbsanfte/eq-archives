In reality though it seems to be<br/>\nfirst in, reset to default on exit, leaving us with Selo&#39;s wearing off<br/>\ncancelling SoW and, I recently discovered, SoW wearing off cancelling<br/>\nSelo&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis seems like such a simple programming error to fix I&#39;m amazed it&#39;s<br/>\nstill not fixed as it was reported back in beta. The server already has<br/>\na variable set for the presence of SoW, hence when you zone your SoW is<br/>\nactive again, so a simple AND added to the test ( IF effect wears off<br/>\nAND no other spell is active also modifying  THEN reset to default.<br/>\nrather than the current IF effect wears off THEN reset to default) when<br/>\nan effect wears off should be all it takes to fix the problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is also the case with other bard songs like Levitate and Water<br/>\nBreathing, making people very annoyed when they move out of the bard<br/>\nsong&#39;s range and lose their spell effect as well. This effectively makes<br/>\nthese songs useless if you are actually in a group, as the area they<br/>\ncover makes them too limited to actually rely on. What party in their<br/>\nright mind would try to enter Kedge Keep relying just on the bard song,<br/>\nand firing it up to help one party member who&#39;s enduring breath has worn<br/>\noff would risk screwing up any other member who was in range of the<br/>\nsong. This has resulted in everyone I know camping for Fishbone Earrings<br/>\nas no one wants to drown just because the Ranger or Druid in the party<br/>\ndied and hasnt got back, and the bard song is too dangerous to be a good<br/>\nbackup, which is what I would have thought it was intended to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo as not to end on a completely negative note though, I have to say<br/>\nweaving Selo&#39;s and Aria of Eagles and running across N Ro, Oasis, S Ro<br/>\nis one of the funnest things I&#39;ve done in the game (though I&#39;m easily<br/>\namused) I like to run off the tops of the highest dunes I can find to<br/>\nsee how much air I can grab. Just make sure if either song accidently<br/>\nwears of it&#39;s Selo&#39;s and not Aria.
