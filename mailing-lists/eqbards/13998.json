Since<br/>\nthe event was in Misty Thicket, it was recommended that we get<br/>\nup to level 3 before making the trip.  In just under an hour,<br/>\nI had to run from a half dozen rats, bats, and snakes without<br/>\ngetting any kills.  I&#39;ve started 2 other monks on different<br/>\nservers, and I couldn&#39;t remember ever having this much trouble<br/>\ngetting out of level 1.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen as I was attacking another rat, I got the following<br/>\nmessage:<br/>\n<br/>\nYou have become better at hand to hand(1)<br/>\n<br/>\nDoh!  After that I was punching for 7-8 instead of 1.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H. Kim<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
