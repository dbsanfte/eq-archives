Granted there will always be low<br/>\nlevel characters on every server, but over time the average character level<br/>\nwill increase.  This could be Verant&#39;s method to help prevent overcrowding<br/>\nby ensuring there are enough creatures around to give experience.  Just a<br/>\nspeculation on my part.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne other thing to consider, when a creature spawns, there are a range of<br/>\nlevels they could be.  Last night I was camping the pirate captain in the<br/>\nOOT who drops the Bracer of Erollisi.  The first time he spawned he conned<br/>\ndark blue to me (21 bard).  The second time he spawned, he was black to me<br/>\n(same level).  The third time he spawned he was yellow.  This could have<br/>\nbeen what happened to you in Steamfont with the skeletons.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; This may seem like superstition on my part but the goblin wizards in<br/>\n&gt; Butcherblock seemed to have been given a boost in their nastiness. I was<br/>\n&gt; soloing these guys at lvl 12 without losing more than two bubbles of<br/>\n&gt; damage,<br/>\n&gt; then recently at level 13 I hit a few once more and almost died a few<br/>\n&gt; times.<br/>\n&gt; I know that things that con the same can vary in potency but this is a big<br/>\n&gt; difference. I&#39;ve also noticed this with the skeletons outside of the<br/>\n&gt; Minotaur Cave in Steamfront, which helped me make my 12th level and turned<br/>\n&gt; promptly to conning green, only to return to blue now at 14th level.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyone else see similar things like this happening?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Bernwyn<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
