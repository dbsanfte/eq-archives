I haven&#39;t played a bard in a long time, and there&#39;s a <br/>\nwhole lotta new songs out there - so I&#39;d like to know which songs will be <br/>\nuseful in which ways and combinations.<br/>\nSo.... as a starter,<br/>\n<br/>\n1st Level - Chant of Battle:<br/>\nThe first (and for a while, most useful), it&#39;s sung in combat - but since <br/>\nit&#39;s not harmful, it should be sung at all times during a young bard&#39;s <br/>\nearly life until they&#39;ve maxed out their singing skills.  It enhances <br/>\ncombat abilities for the Bard and everyone in their group, and can be <br/>\nsuccessfully twisted / stacked / harmonized with most other below-tenth <br/>\nsongs.  It becomes outdated with the tenth level song: &quot;Anthem de Arms&quot; <br/>\n(can it still be stacked with that, though?)<br/>\n<br/>\nTalies the Wanderer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
