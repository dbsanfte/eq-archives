Loaded her up with a PGT and an<br/>\nobs shard and went to fight some stuff. First attempt was with zero dex<br/>\nstuff on (was at 95 dex). PGT procd twice, shard went off once. Then I<br/>\nloaded up all my dex gear I usually strp on and it took me to 150 dex. PGT<br/>\nfired off 7 times, shard went off 3 time. Redid this test 5 more times with<br/>\nsimilar results.<br/>\nAnd after reading this post I logged in to try out the wis argument for<br/>\nprocs on my Pal. Wisdom of 80 had 3 procs per battle, wis of 101 had approx<br/>\n3 procs per battle. Didnt see a change, and dex of 140 constant.<br/>\nSo from what I tested, it is the dex that regulates proc/no proc. With a dex<br/>\nof 80 on my warrior, just went and got a mith 2 hander to not have to worry<br/>\nabout it =)<br/>\n<br/>\nKragan<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Garramone@...\">Michael.Garramone@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;everyone believes it to be dex.  i have yet to hear that wisdom plays a<br/>\n&gt;role.  i think the consensus on dex is that if you hit more often, you will<br/>\n&gt;proc more often.  sounds like it makes sense, but the problem is you do NOT<br/>\n&gt;have to hit to proc, you just have to swing.  i have taken notice of this<br/>\n&gt;after asking a level 50 warrior friend of mine for advice on stats for my<br/>\n&gt;paladin, and he mentioned that.  with my paladin, for a fact i have seen<br/>\n&gt;myself miss the first 3 swings of a fight, i inflicted no melee damage, yet<br/>\n&gt;my ghoulbane definitely did proc.  dunno if this is common knowledge to<br/>\n&gt;everyone, it surprised me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Shada D&#39;ukal, Level 50 Wood Elf Bard<br/>\n&gt;Erisi Dlarit, Level 24 High Elf Paladin<br/>\n&gt;Tyria Sarkin, Level 22 High Elf Wizard<br/>\n&gt;Mithaniel Marr Server<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
