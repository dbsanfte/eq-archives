(Box of abu ja&#39;far [sorry, cannot resist <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; : )], Hero Bracer<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; etc.)  Personally, i think the Lustrous Russet armor SHOULD <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; BE warrior only,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; but they should have made it so instantly when they <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; discovered the error.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor <br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;     GRAB THE GATOR!
