Am I making a mistake that will bite<br/>\n&gt; me at later levels? (Shada....help me out here)  Every<br/>\n&gt; weapon I&#39;ve heard about that is decent damage for<br/>\n&gt; bards at high levels is 1H Slash.  Did I, for<br/>\n&gt; roleplaying purposes, limit my usefulness at later<br/>\n&gt; levels? </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
