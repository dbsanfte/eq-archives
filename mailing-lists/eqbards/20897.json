My base is 95, with my best AC stuff it&#39;s at 107. I have a BP neclace<br/>\n(mostly to get my agility above 100) which takes it to 114. I *could* swap<br/>\nout a jagged band or two for 5 dex/7 cha rings and so get it as high as 124.<br/>\nbut I lost 5AC for the neclace and would lose another 5 or 10 with the rings<br/>\n(mind you I am in full lambent at 15, so I should have a *bit* of room to<br/>\nmove on AC)<br/>\n<br/>\nProcing will be a big deal for me this time around (I haven&#39;t mentioned my<br/>\nlatest bard project), I have an Obsidian shard and a Blade of Fiery<br/>\nLamentations. The shard procs at 16 and I have not found an answer on the<br/>\nBoFL but one person (I think on concert hall) claimed theirs did at 19, I am<br/>\nheading towards finding out. If the BoFL procs a lot more with higher dex it<br/>\ncould be a huge difference in my teens and twenties.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuick side note, I have shelved Tszaaz and started this new bard to replace<br/>\nhim. Why? Lots of reasons, but hunting at lower levels is easier when you<br/>\ncan&#39;t play much. I DO like the big difference in stats (new guy is a half<br/>\nelf) even if I hate the Star Trek (Original) pants and bucket head.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, anyone have any real statistics? Also I assumed that getting agi over<br/>\n100 was important, is there some magic number in particular to reach?<br/>\n<br/>\nTszaaz<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
