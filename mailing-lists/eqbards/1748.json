I put alot of points into STR and STM and have boost items <br/>\nfor both currently. As a wood elf dual wielding barbed whips, I am stam <br/>\nstarved in a long fight (love Jig), even with a blackened girdle +5 stam. I <br/>\nhave mostly banded or magical pieces of armor and weight wise, I&#39;m pretty <br/>\nheavy. I will likely hold out for some ruby just due to weight. I really <br/>\nhate the art for wood elf plate helms, and being a woman, it really does <br/>\nmatter how I look, so its off the list. I will probably go for boots and <br/>\ngloves first in plate. The rest willmean giving up barbed and Bloodstained <br/>\nand will take alot of thought. As far as RP&#39;ing a bard, I try to take the <br/>\noutgoing, knowledgeable, well traveled tack, not the minstrel fop tack. Also <br/>\nmy guild is mainly barbarians so we never lack for full tanks, so I can be a <br/>\nhealer or tank as I choose.<br/>\nNext is a question, we were in lake Rathe last night and found a big hole <br/>\nunder the island (underwater) that has 3 aviak guards on a tower. My guild <br/>\nmates did not know what this went to. I just got L17 back after being reset <br/>\na week, and was not keen on losing it. Any idea what lives in there? Is it a <br/>\nzone?<br/>\nI also think we have a good list here. No real flames just lots of different <br/>\nopinions. Great discussions. :)<br/>\nBrilinnia of Xegony<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
