We<br/>\ndecide to see U-541 (or whatever it&#39;s called).  The lights go down and I<br/>\nam wrapping up a quiet conversation before the previews begin when my<br/>\nwife suddenly starts hissing and throwing popcorn at the screen.  I turn<br/>\nto find the overly familier gold font of &quot;EVERQUEST&quot; smack dab in the<br/>\nmiddle of the screen in 5 foot high letters.
