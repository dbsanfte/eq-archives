I wounder how many other classes<br/>\n&gt; have been to this? :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;  The Lute of the Gypsy Princess (also found in Mistmoore) which has no<br/>\n&gt; &gt; discernible special effect.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  The Gypsy Lute (different from the Lute of the Gypsy Princess, in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that it is for a specific quest), which has no known special abilities.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Does not ones of these give +5 magic resistance? I know that&#39;s not much<br/>\n&gt; of an &quot;ability&quot; but it is SOMETHING.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What is there no rule #3? Wouldn&#39;t it make more sense to have no rule #6<br/>\n&gt; than no Rule #3? I heard there WAS a rule #3 in beta, but the took it<br/>\n&gt; out because it made us overpowered.
