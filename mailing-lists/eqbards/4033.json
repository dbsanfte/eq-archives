A dry bones skeleten is standing there, takes a<br/>\n&gt;look around, spots me out of a crowd of 30 camped players sitting against<br/>\n&gt;the wall, and makes a b-line for me.  We handily dispatched him and all got<br/>\n&gt;a good laugh.  30 seconds later.  *Creaaak*, opens the door.

Repeat.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;This happened four or five times before we were forced to zone.  My puller<br/>\n&gt;was pretty happy that his job was so easy, until a flock of GDBs came<br/>\n&gt;running and we had to run.

That may sound silly<br/>\n&gt;but a lot of message boards out there are just<br/>\n&gt;whinning about the class.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Anyway, I had heard about the &#39;tauting&#39; effects of our<br/>\n&gt;songs, but for the most part, it never bothered me,<br/>\n&gt;sure I get the mobs attention, and even take a lot of<br/>\n&gt;dammage, no biggie, just make nice with the cleric.<br/>\n&gt;Well, after turning 21, Guk and Unrest have become<br/>\n&gt;whole new places.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;First guk, near the scryer room my party of six where<br/>\n&gt;bashing every froglock in sight, gaining massive exp<br/>\n&gt;and loot.  So we say, what the heck, lets go in the<br/>\n&gt;room.  Well, on knight comes after us, so I use my<br/>\n&gt;melodic binding song that I love so much.  Big<br/>\n&gt;mistake, from behind one of our tanks I saw no less<br/>\n&gt;than 15 assorted froglocks come up the stairs, and who<br/>\n&gt;do you think they were headed for?  Well, after about<br/>\n&gt;5 minutes of root, root, root, root, I was taking the<br/>\n&gt;long walk back from freeport.  Get back, grab my<br/>\n&gt;stuff, play anthem for my friends in battle, and what<br/>\n&gt;do you think happened?  Again, I&#39;m dragged down under<br/>\n&gt;a sea of amphibious flesh.  So after a while, I say,<br/>\n&gt;heck, I&#39;ll head over to good ole unrest, what could be<br/>\n&gt;safer?  Get there, find some good friends I could<br/>\n&gt;trust, and we get to slayin undead.  One of the dry<br/>\n&gt;bones makes a run for the house, silly bard that I am,<br/>\n&gt;I chase him, again, still singing a song, forget which<br/>\n&gt;one.  Withing seconds the doors fly open and carrion,<br/>\n&gt;monks and the reclusive ghoul magi beeline right at<br/>\n&gt;the wide eyed me, who didn&#39;t even have time to type in<br/>\n&gt;a profanity.  So I come back from butchers block.<br/>\n&gt;Fighting a while, see a wisp to the left of the house,<br/>\n&gt;facing the back.  Someone in my guild needed a light<br/>\n&gt;stone, so I run to grab it, while singing my little<br/>\n&gt;anthem.  All of a sudden, the hag 3 floors up starts<br/>\n&gt;casting on me from a window, and I wake up at home<br/>\n&gt;among the trees.  That sucked.  Does this mean we<br/>\n&gt;can&#39;t use any of our aoe or buffs anywhere near a<br/>\n&gt;dungeon?  Well, at least my calves are built up from<br/>\n&gt;zone running :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Llewrend Lynnhaven<br/>\n&gt;21rst song<br/>\n&gt;E Marr<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The Best Place to Buy Movies - Reel.com<br/>\n&gt;&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/reel1\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/reel1</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The planet&#39;s eCenter for health & well-being.
