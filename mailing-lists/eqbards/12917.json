I usually find myself joining pickup groups.  What I have found is<br/>\nthat in pickup groups, players tend to look out for themselves before<br/>\nconsidering the welfare of the party.  To add salt to the wound, the problem is<br/>\nmagnified because of the time I usually log on.  I live in Hawaii so when I play<br/>\nits usually after midnight on the mainland on weeknights.  When a pull turns bad<br/>\nand someone dies,  especially if it is a melee class bound in a zone far away,<br/>\nthe party usually either breaks up because its so late at night or the casters<br/>\nleave the group because it will take the melee class too long to get back to the<br/>\nzone they died in.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think its safe to say that Verant doesn&#39;t take situations like this into<br/>\nconsideration when they have the mythical class balance tuning sessions.  I<br/>\nthink they just assume everyone has a regular group/guild that they play with<br/>\nall the time and as a result they are focused on group welfare vs personal<br/>\nwelfare.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; If the casters in your group gate out and leave you to die, they are not good<br/>\n&gt; groupies.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
