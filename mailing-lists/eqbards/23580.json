I had been<br/>\npulling non-stop for about an hour or so.  About midway through, I started<br/>\nto get the &quot;ghost&quot; Mayong faction messages whenever another group killed a<br/>\nspider.  So one time I go out and pull a single spider.  There were no other<br/>\nspiders near the one I pulled.  My group started to kill the lone spider.<br/>\nThe all of a sudden, out of nowhere, 10+ spiders warp in to where we were<br/>\nfighting and commence to kick the snot out of me.  I tried to start up the<br/>\nFear song but died before I could get it up.  From that point on, whenever I<br/>\nhunt in Dreadlands, I will camp out to clear aggro as soon as I started<br/>\ngetting the &quot;ghost&quot; Mayong faction messages.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Cyr, Thierry [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:thierry.cyr@...\">thierry.cyr@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, January 26, 2001 6:56 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] My first experience with Bard aggro....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHalana wait till you bring Tani to dreadlands and start pulling spiders 8)<br/>\nMayong factions are going to go threw the roof as you&#39;ll get many and many<br/>\nghost faction hits<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Kimes, Dean W.

I&#39;m not sure what starts the whole<br/>\nagro circus, maybe some bug of leftover bard code from when our songs<br/>\naffected everyone in the radius and not just those grouped with.  Whatever<br/>\nstarts it I do understand now how it gets passed and why it doesn&#39;t go away<br/>\nwhen you zone.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat happens is somehow a wolf, in this example, gets you on its hate list.<br/>\nWhen it happens you are out of &#39;chase&#39; range so the wolf goes on its merry<br/>\nway passing its hate for you on to other wolves it meets in its travels.<br/>\nPretty soon every wolf in the zone hates you.  As soon as you come within<br/>\n&#39;chase&#39; range of a wolf that hates you, he beelines for you.  Since &#39;chase&#39;<br/>\nrange is so much larger than agro range in Kunark and Velious, it is readily<br/>\napparent how weird the event is when it happens.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you are grouped, your groupmates are also on the hate list of all these<br/>\nwolves.  You camp, the list is cleared... for you.  You come back and group<br/>\nwith the former groupmate, still ok.  You pulse one song on that groupmate<br/>\nthough and suddenly you get added to the hate list of every single mob that<br/>\nhas the groupmate on their hatelist in the entire zone.  How wolves halfway<br/>\nacross the island know you cast a beneficial spell on an enemy is a mystery,<br/>\nbut that&#39;s VI logic for you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
