The problem with <br/>\nWin2k and playing games is that most of the 3D type cards do not have very <br/>\ngood drivers for Win2k.  I use Win2k with a TNT and the game crashes <br/>\noccassionally.  If there aren&#39;t new TNT drivers soon I will probably be <br/>\nswitching back to Win98.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom what I&#39;ve heard the TNT2 and the GEForce cards are supposed to have <br/>\npretty good win2k drivers.  Voodoo cards are supposed to just bite.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally If I had Win98 I would wait until more reliable drivers are put <br/>\nout.  It&#39;s not worth the hassle unless you have to use Win2k for some other <br/>\napplication.<br/>\n<br/>\nRuldaas<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Sylly Songsynger&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: Here is what I did (was:RE: [eqbards] [egbarts] Changing <br/>\n&gt;computer s)<br/>\n&gt;Date: Mon, 6 Mar 2000 09:20:15 -0600<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;What video card(s) are you using?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I have Win2K and EQ on a test machine with an ATI Rage 3d AGP 2X GT-CZUZ <br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;the display is 99% unplayable (constant, very bad,  flickering.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Did you have to do anything to get Direct X 7a installed?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sylly<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt;From: Reeves, Patrick W &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pwr3@...\">pwr3@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sent: Monday, March 06, 2000 8:49 AM<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Here is what I did (was:RE: [eqbards] [egbarts] Changing computer<br/>\n&gt;s)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Reeves, Patrick W&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pwr3@...\">pwr3@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I upgraded my system to Win 2K over the weekend.
