I have to admit to never seeing<br/>\nthis before, even when I used charm all night one time in Solusek.  I<br/>\njust imagined it was another little unusual thing with Dreadlands/<br/>\nKunark, along with the random faction changes and the way mobs seem to<br/>\nignore the puller and everyone else and focus on one party member for<br/>\nno obvious reason.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, I&#39;ll try out a number of commands and be more wary in future.<br/>\nEven if we can just take 1 mob out of the fight it&#39;s a help, never<br/>\nmind if it isn&#39;t attacking and killing the others alongside us! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again all!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Tue, 16 May 2000 09:26:11 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;it happens.

When you<br/>\n&gt;re-charm it stops attacking you and goes to the next thing on it&#39;s hate<br/>\n&gt;list.   Thus it will sometimes (though not always) jump all over one of your<br/>\n&gt;party members even though you charmed it.
