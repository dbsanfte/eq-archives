I&#39;m just a hair from level 8 and about to<br/>\nbegin hunting in Qeynos Hills.  But I don&#39;t know that I&#39;ve got any expertise<br/>\nto share just yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do have a question though.  I&#39;ve been travelling with a level 8 halfling<br/>\ndruid friend of mine, and whether singing or not, she outruns me by a long<br/>\nshot.  At the time we were both stripped of everything (multi-zone trip, so<br/>\nall posessions went into the bank) and she had not cast any buffs on either<br/>\nof us.  Are wood elves/bards naturally slower than halflings/druids?  I<br/>\nspent some time hunting in Mysty (just long enough that I was ready to<br/>\nattack the guards for killing every mob within an 8 mile radius of the wall<br/>\njust when I had them down to their last breath!) and noticed that while<br/>\nrunning with Accelerado I was still getting passed by others (presumably<br/>\nusing SOW).  Anyone care to shed some light on this?<br/>\n<br/>\nTa</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
