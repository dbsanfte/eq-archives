If so then you (jackal) have<br/>\nplenty of things to do to keep you occupied until the expansion comes out.<br/>\nYour shaman still has to suffer from all the problems with the game that IMO<br/>\nneed to get fixed.  If you don&#39;t have fun playing anything but your 50 necro<br/>\nthen thats a different story.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I know but then again us 50&#39;s played with less then you have now you guys<br/>\n&gt; just want some new stuff I just need a place to hunt and I&#39;ve got a 21<br/>\n&gt; shaman right now. There is plenty of places to hunt and there are quests<br/>\n&gt; here and there but the bottom line is you guys can play  it&#39;s getting to<br/>\n&gt; be<br/>\n&gt; unplayable now to wherem ost people don&#39;t pla ytheir main chars at all or<br/>\n&gt; rarely rather because of overcrowding. This is the problem I am forced to<br/>\n&gt; play my mid level chars so there must be something right for you guys.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
