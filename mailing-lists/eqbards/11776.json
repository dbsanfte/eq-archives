I won when I killed<br/>\nLockjaw by myself, that first solo spectre, the first giant, when we<br/>\ngot my ykesha (wahoo!) last night, I&#39;ll win when I see Vox and Nagafen<br/>\nand Innohule... die.  Everquest is a lot like euchre, I win, but I keep<br/>\nplaying.  I am victorious when I win the battle, yet I know that<br/>\nthe war will never end.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; A &#39;game&#39; IS competitive - it&#39;s designed to have a winner - it&#39;s setup that<br/>\n&gt; way. That does not mean you can&#39;t enjoy the play aspect of it as well - but<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s a forgone conclusion before a &#39;game&#39; starts, someone is gonna win,<br/>\n&gt; someone is gonna lose.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>www.dictionary.com:<br/>\ngame (noun)<br/>\nAn activity providing entertainment or amusement.  No winner or loser<br/>\nhere.<br/>\n<br/>\na &quot;competition&quot; is designed to have a winner and loser, not game.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlaying Everquest is a game for me.  Lots of games have no winner or<br/>\nloser, this is a game for me, no, there is never credits at the end of it,<br/>\nbut that doesn&#39;t mean I won&#39;t ever win. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Show me what in EQ &#39;let&#39;s you win&#39;? Level 50 - nice things?  Ya know,<br/>\n&gt; eventually everyone that is persistent enough at trying will get that same<br/>\n&gt; thing. If you look at others achievements as somehow diminishing your own -<br/>\n&gt; you are superimposing your own personal competition on the world at large. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s another question.  Would you say that killing Vox would be a good<br/>\n&quot;victory&quot; for my guild?  Would I have a just complaint because Vox<br/>\nis changed 5 days before my guild goes to fight him, and now he doesn&#39;t<br/>\ndrop anything?  I had a battle to obtain a manastone from an evil eye.<br/>\nI lost that battle, I was not victorious.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The first watershed in a virtual world is the question &quot;Can you win?&quot;. EQ<br/>\n&gt; has a problem here - it WANTS to be a virtual world - but by setting itself<br/>\n&gt; on a level based system it gives the illusion you can WIN.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I won in real life when I graduated from college, yet I am still playing<br/>\nthere also.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou think of win as only the final battle, no there is no such win in<br/>\nEverquest, but you can win elsewhere.  I do grudingly admit I compete<br/>\nin Everquest, starting around level 35, I&#39;ve done a /who all wizard 35 50,<br/>\ntaken a look at the number of wizards higher than me.  Somehow I gained<br/>\na lot of enjoyment when last time I checked, I was higher up onthe<br/>\nlist.  I&#39;ve made the brews, and the large bowls, and the small<br/>\nbanded cloaks, and the fish rolls, and the class 6 arrows, I&#39;m fluent<br/>\nin the different languages, I know my way around 95% of the zones by<br/>\nheart.  I am running out of competitions that I enjoy in Everquest, <br/>\nso instead of quitting, I want the best for my remaining ones.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
