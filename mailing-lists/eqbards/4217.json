And it may be easy for you to find<br/>\n&gt; out<br/>\n&gt; &gt; but not everyone that reads these lists are as computer literate as some<br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; us.  It is not that much more difficult to type out the word when<br/>\n&gt; posting to<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t see any problem with using words/acronyms that are common<br/>\n&gt; knowledge in-game, when out of game and talking about the game. Very very<br/>\n&gt; very few people don&#39;t know what RTS is. If they don&#39;t, they&#39;re gonna learn<br/>\n&gt; pretty fast when playing. Therefore I consider it common knowledge. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In my book, it&#39;s the same as acting as if it&#39;s bad for me to say &#39;the<br/>\n&gt; ranger guild&#39;. Someone out there, somewhere, might not know that the<br/>\n&gt; ranger guild is in Surefall and Kelethin. So therefore, according to the<br/>\n&gt; no-acronyms logic, I should explain the locations of them since someone<br/>\n&gt; might know them.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And when you get into explaining everything because someone somewhere<br/>\n&gt; might not know it..<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ---<br/>\n&gt; Jesse &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:j@...\">j@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lumiere.net/\">http://www.lumiere.net/</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Congrats to GROW TO GIVE winners, ZENtertainment & ROTInews!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Check out ONElist&#39;s new program, FRIENDS & FAMILY.
