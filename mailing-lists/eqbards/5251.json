With that buff, barbed bone skeletons and carrion<br/>\nghouls almost never resist the Lullaby and Largo&#39;s Binding song.  Without<br/>\nthe enchanter buff, they seemed to resist more.  At least it seems that way<br/>\nto me.  I would like to collect data on it but its hard to keep track of it<br/>\nduring combat.  That&#39;s why I raised the question last week when someone<br/>\nposted about Brad McQuaid&#39;s comment at GenCon.  To paraphrase, Brad told<br/>\nsomeone that charisma has no effect on a mobs chance to resist.  I don&#39;t<br/>\nknow who this Butler guy is (I assume he works for Verant), but his<br/>\nstatement seems to be the complete opposite of what Brad said.  Based off my<br/>\nsubjective experience, I think Butler&#39;s statement about charisma affecting a<br/>\nmobs&#39; chance to resist is the correct way the game handles charisma.  What<br/>\ndoes everyone else think?<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci   <br/>\n<br/>\n      &lt;snipped from Faras&#39; post&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I personally don&#39;t do all the number crunching but tend to trust those of<br/>\n&gt; us on this list that do, especially those of us who are of a higher level<br/>\n&gt; than myself - however, with a CHA of 95 one night, I got a enchanter to<br/>\n&gt; boost me up above 100 and did notice that my songs such as root and<br/>\n&gt; binding were resisted less. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>\t&lt;snipped from the post about the Verant social&gt;    <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Butler said there is no correlation between Charisma and<br/>\n&gt; one&#39;s saves. Your charisma is related to how well you<br/>\n&gt; interact/affect creatures. He also mentioned that<br/>\n&gt; Bard&#39;s singing skill has a check against charisma. <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
