Had gotten<br/>\nkilled in Crushbone with my rogue and was running back to my corpse.  I&#39;m<br/>\nabout 5 seconds from it when I get the group tell.  &quot;Okay time to run,<br/>\neverybody zone!&quot; <br/>\nI look around and don&#39;t see anyone around my corpse so figure they are<br/>\nbehind me already.  I head for the corpse only to have my group come around<br/>\nthe castle and run over me with their train including Dvinn.  At least I<br/>\nthink it was Dvinn, didn&#39;t live long enough to be sure.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Bill Costlow [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:atlatyl@...\">atlatyl@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, July 19, 2000 9:33 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] The Group from Hell<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- &quot;Cranfill, Wendy&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Wendy_Cranfill@...\">Wendy_Cranfill@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But i guess after reading<br/>\n&gt; the &quot;bad mage&quot; thread, just wanted to point out that<br/>\n&gt; its never a bad class,<br/>\n&gt; its almost always bad players.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sooo True.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast week I joined a pickup group in Dalnirs.  We did<br/>\npretty well in the Temple room so somebody suggested<br/>\nwe go down to lvl 2.  As we all landed in the pool of<br/>\nwater, sombody got excited and pulled a nice train<br/>\ninto the room before we got set up.  THings got bad<br/>\nand somebody said gate -- The monk and I were left to<br/>\ndie.  Funny thing, all four casters in the group had<br/>\nto log at that point ... <br/>\n7 deaths (6 during corpse recovery) at lvl 30 sure can<br/>\nruin your night. sigh<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet Yahoo!
