The following changes were made:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;- Fixed some problems with sound volume being set above the maximum<br/>\n&gt;or below the minimum.<br/>\n&gt;- Fixed a problem that caused sound volume to be reset regardless of<br/>\n&gt;the slider setting upon zoning or entering game.<br/>\n&gt;- Fixed a bug that would cause some sounds to be unduly amplified<br/>\n&gt;whenever the volume slider was moved.<br/>\n&gt;- Fixed a bug causing pink fringes to show on whiskers in association<br/>\n&gt;with mipmapping.<br/>\n&gt;- Fixed a bug with /usercolor causing settings to be saved in the<br/>\n&gt;wrong slot.<br/>\n&gt;- Fixed weapon scaling problems with off-hand weapons and those<br/>\n&gt;carried by dwarves.<br/>\n&gt;- Fixed a bug that caused the client to display an amount of<br/>\n&gt;experience in slight disagreement with the server.<br/>\n&gt;- Fixed the Paladin Epic Quest reward, which was procing a spell that<br/>\n&gt;would do around one million points of damage if left to its<br/>\n&gt;own devices.<br/>\n&gt;- Fixed a faction problem that made some quests designed to be doable<br/>\n&gt;by anyone, regardless of race or class, undoable.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;In other news, the Tarew/Povar split server, Xev, will be up<br/>\n&gt;following the patch today.  Xev is named for Xev Bristlebane, the god<br/>\n&gt;of fortune.  We would have named the new server under its full name<br/>\n&gt;if not for an attempt to avoid confusion between the existing<br/>\n&gt;&quot;Bristlebane&quot; server (named for Fizzlethorpe Bristlebane) and Xev.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;- The EverQuest Team<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Just hope they didn&#39;t mess with invis song and sneak/hide breakage.<br/>\n&gt;If anyone gets on(I didn&#39;t), let us know anything you discover.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Piemur Draggonsinger<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet more from the Web.
