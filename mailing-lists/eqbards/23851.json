I&#39;m still (out of habit) playing first-person<br/>\nview even thought I&#39;ve heard all the advice that overhead is better for<br/>\nCC...<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnywho - I try to target the add which is in view in the bottom right hand<br/>\nof the screen - and all hell breaks loose.  It takes me a second to realize<br/>\nthat I&#39;ve clicked the &quot;Social/Abilities&quot; box and the interface decided it<br/>\nwas time for me to move the box.  I frantically try to figure out how to get<br/>\nit to stop - as a 3rd mob walks in the room.  By the time I get it under<br/>\ncontrol the 2 tanks are dead.  I get 2 mobs tied down - we kill one when<br/>\nmore start spawning.  At this point we don&#39;t have enough firepower (2<br/>\nClerics and a Druid) - and eventually I get a string of resists to mez - so<br/>\nwe decide to run for the border.\tOne of the mobs was a summoner - so only<br/>\none of the four of us makes it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI told my guildies what happened - only to discover about the alt-L command<br/>\nto lock the windows.  If you haven&#39;t done the ALT-L do it right away -  I<br/>\nwish I had known about it before.<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde Katzenjammer<br/>\n53 Bard of Xegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
