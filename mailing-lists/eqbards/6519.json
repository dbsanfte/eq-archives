Its such a pain<br/>\n&gt; in the butt when you spend over half an hour on a rare and someone tries to<br/>\n&gt; steal it like that.  We got the kill, got 2pp each from it and a set of<br/>\n&gt; giant toes, great rare verant!   oh and Ocylis ogrebane (or whatever its<br/>\n&gt; name is) the cyclops had junk like this too.

Nearly all the<br/>\ngood items can only be attained by camping.  If you try to<br/>\nplay by wandering and exploring, you&#39;re going to get mostly<br/>\ncrap for loot, even from the named mobs.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, when a druid, necro, or shaman tries to steal<br/>\nsomething from you, make sure you hit the mob with cancel<br/>\nmagic (or use a pumice stone) to get rid of their DoT.  My<br/>\nfriends and I had a druid steal the froglok shin lord from us<br/>\nwhile we were trying to get Ghoulbane for our paladin.  I<br/>\ndiscovered that although charm clears the damage list, if a<br/>\nDoT is in effect throughout the charm, the stealer still gets<br/>\ncredit for damage done by that DoT.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
