I find this very disturbing.  What is it exactly, about bards at the<br/>\n&gt;30+ level, that makes them so godawful?  With dual wield and the ability to<br/>\n&gt;wear plate, I would think a bard could actually hold his or her own at<br/>\n </span></blockquote>least<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;as a fighter.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Several points... bards are mob magnets... usually at the worst possible<br/>\ntime. =)  Fighters, even with same type of armor, seem to be able to handle<br/>\ndmg better than bards.  And I don&#39;t know about others, but my ability to<br/>\ndeal out damage really sucks.  I hit about 60% of the time, and maximum<br/>\ndamage with my current weapons (barbed whip and combine LS) is 42 per round,<br/>\nplus bellow for an additional 17 for a total dmg of 59.  Compare this to a<br/>\ncaster who can do 300+ with a single spell, or a rogue who can do 80+ with<br/>\nbackstab, or a fighter with a good 2h weapon who can do 70+ with weapon<br/>\nalone, plus kick, bash, riposte, etc. And don&#39;t forget rogues and monks<br/>\ndisarming their opponents.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, bards are, strictly speaking, a luxury item, not a necessity in a<br/>\ngroup.  Every group needs tanks and healers.  After that they need nukers.<br/>\nWhat we do is make everyone else more effective.  We minimize downtime by<br/>\ntopping off the hurt with our heal song, bringing casters back into action<br/>\nfaster with mana song, make the tanks deal out more damage with anthem,<br/>\nprotect with the guardian series, etc.<br/>\nBut strictly speaking, we are not truly &quot;needed&quot;, not the way a healer is.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou want to show a group how important a bard can be? Go join a group that&#39;s<br/>\ncamping Drez or any charm-using mob, and do nothing but stack Guardian and<br/>\nElemental.  That ups everyone&#39;s magic resist to 80 or better.  No one gets<br/>\ncharmed anymore. =)<br/>\n<br/>\nOr a Tae room group with 2 pallys, cleric, druid, wiz, and a mana bard.  I<br/>\ndid a group like that the other night and we did a 20 minute non-stop melee.<br/>\nNo one died, no one was ever totally OOM.  I&#39;d step back and hit mana song<br/>\nto recharge the caster and healers, then back into melee and do anthem some<br/>\nmore.  We piled the bodies high around us that night. =)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I suspect it&#39;s just powergamers not wanting a jack-of-all-trades, but the<br/>\n&gt;characters who can do the most damage standing behind those who can take<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;most beating.   Ah well, one day I&#39;ll be level 50 too.  And know what?

Their<br/>\nold friends know the mobs, know how to stay on top of the spawn.  Newer<br/>\nfriends take time to learn this, and in bad situations, that time might<br/>\nspell someones death.  They&#39;ll take a 33 shaman instead of a 33 bard because<br/>\nthat shaman goes back to P0.5, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut once you become known as someone who is *GOOD*, you can break down those<br/>\nwalls.  It just takes so awfully long to do that most give up.  I&#39;m too<br/>\ndamned obstinate to quit. =)<br/>\n<br/>\nLinako</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
