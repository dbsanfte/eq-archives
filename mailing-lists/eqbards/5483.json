Our enchanter fiend could cast Ogre form and walk in and<br/>\ndrag corpses out.  I did the same thing and saw amiable and being a bard<br/>\nthought np ill buzz right on by...<br/>\n<br/>\nyou writhe in agony<br/>\nyou writhe in agony<br/>\nLoading, please wait...<br/>\n<br/>\nThen some time I helped a mage get his corpse from somewhere near that place<br/>\nand dint think much of it.  But yesterday I get a tell from him and he axes<br/>\n&quot;do you remember me?&quot; Well, he says he&#39;s gonna camp these ogers and would I<br/>\nlike some loots? Oh ya, he&#39;s a lev 48 magician.  So, I go watch him do his<br/>\nstuff.  He says they are all green to him but like all of us, he hates green<br/>\ncasters with a passion.  He and his pet get the spawn broken out and then<br/>\nfor the next 2 plus hours we camp.  He wants some earring and some veil they<br/>\ndrop. He lets me loot the rest of the stuffs.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s got a hp-to-mana spell he casts on himself and I am busy healing<br/>\nbetween fites. Pet does most of the work and can solo guards if they are<br/>\ndumb enuff to charge him while he meds.  He can stand off and cast them fire<br/>\nball looking spells into the melee.  Eventually , I get brave enough to<br/>\nbellow from the edge of the melee and taunt their pets off _our_ pet.<br/>\nChief&#39;s dog is a nasty yeller but cant make up his mind who to attack - esp<br/>\nif our pet is whacking the Chief.  The shapersons and the chief drop the<br/>\ngood loots - rest of them drop rusty, misc large leather armor, misc bronze<br/>\nwep and fs wep, occasion 2-3plat, mostly few gp or sp, various words pages<br/>\nand ruins.  The sha and chief dropped some bone armor - legs and arms.  Have<br/>\nlowish ac and weight compared to bronze and have str and sta boosts with agi<br/>\nand dex penalties - only an oger would be dumb enough to make armor like<br/>\nthis.  But casters can wear it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe (his pet) killed the Chief mucho times.  There is a priest(ess?) that<br/>\nnever spawned during our camp.  At one time, I think he got kinda sleepy<br/>\nwaiting and the camp started to fill up. I got nervous because he was not<br/>\nattacking each one like before and not responding to tells and now the<br/>\nguards and the Chief are up.  So, do I leave him to a certain death and save<br/>\nmyself before it&#39;s too late?? Or do I decide to get &quot;creative&quot; and think we<br/>\nmight be OK if I make us invis.  Well, I should know better but I did it<br/>\nanyways.  Mage pets and our invis don&#39;t get along at all.  Any how - KABOOM!<br/>\nhis pet dies as we go invis and I guess the noise woke him up.  He attacks<br/>\nthe rest of the camp and clears it.  I have to fess up and explain that it<br/>\nwas me that schwacked his pet and he goes &quot;hehe - lol&quot;  I guess you need a<br/>\nsense of humor to get to lev 48 :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\nBard of the 22st song<br/>\nSelling Swords and Such<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\tSnicker Furfoot, Esq.
