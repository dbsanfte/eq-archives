I have used it before and gotten<br/>\nresisted quite a bit, but last night was the first time I ever saw the<br/>\nsecondary resist message like Lullaby has.  Was this added at the same time<br/>\nas Lullaby&#39;s was or later?  It was taking me 3-4 applications to get it to<br/>\nstick which made it useless for mezzing casters.  Granted I was using it on<br/>\nhigh blues and whites, but why would I want to mez a green caster that<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t stand up to the group for 20 seconds anyhow???<br/>\n<br/>\nI was singing nothing but Pixie Strike against a blue necro trying to hold<br/>\nher off while the group was busy and the necro was able to keep me almost<br/>\ncontinually stunned with fear while I was only able to interrupt her once or<br/>\ntwice.  Looks like this is another song I will demem until they fix it.<br/>\nWhen fighting high blues and whites it has not worked well enough to be<br/>\nworthwhile.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
