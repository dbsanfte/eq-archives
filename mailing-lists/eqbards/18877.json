Died 7 times in Plane of Hate.  My cleric never quite got just how<br/>\nfew Hit Points I have.<br/>\n2.  Died 3 times to bad trains in Lower Guk.<br/>\n3.  Died once in Sebelis.  Five frog pull, four frogs decided that, of<br/>\n24 people there, I was the tastiest.  Never died so fast in my playing<br/>\ncareer.  The red just plummeted straight down to nothing, without<br/>\nstopping once.<br/>\n4.  Died three times in City of Mist, including once when I had managed<br/>\nto fall asleep.  Hey, sometimes people just take too darn long to get<br/>\norganized, you know?<br/>\n5.  Died to another bad train in Lower Guk.<br/>\n6.  Died in Skyfire, just a big pile of bad guys all at once.<br/>\n<br/>\nHmm.  16 deaths in one level.  How embarrassing is that?  Curiously, I<br/>\nnever got negative experience for a day.  Thank goodness for level 49<br/>\nrezzes.  Just didn&#39;t get much positive experience.  Hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut!  (And yes, it&#39;s anti-climactic for many of you, but tough), I got<br/>\nlevel 50!  Giants in Burning Woods finally did the trick.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 50 songs, Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
