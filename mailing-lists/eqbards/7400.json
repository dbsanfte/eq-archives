One &quot;benefit&quot; of not being able to bind<br/>\nanywhere is that you will not die 10-20 times and lose a level<br/>\nor two when your guild decides to fight a dragon.

In mine, the casters are<br/>\nmost likely to make it out alive, as they all gate (usually<br/>\nhelped out by Screech).  Then the melee folks have to make the<br/>\nlong, twisty run to the zone past a dozen other mobs that will<br/>\njoin the train.  The people I see being most likely to die is<br/>\nthe bard and healer.  One song pulse and all those mobs you<br/>\nwere just overrun by go aggro on the bard.  One heal and those<br/>\nmobs go aggro on the cleric.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy personal opinion is that everyone should be allowed to bind<br/>\nonly in cities.  But we&#39;re probably beyond the point where it<br/>\nwould be viable to make that change.  The uproar from the<br/>\nplayers (well, half the players) would be deafening.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
