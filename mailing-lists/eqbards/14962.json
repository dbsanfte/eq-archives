Our","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-568159940\">It sounds like you have a really nice guild - you seem to be close in levels<br/>\nand enjoy being with your friends.  That is what it is really all about.<br/>\nOur guildmaster is constantly reminding us that we are not going on this<br/>\nraid or that run because we are after the loot but that we are doing this<br/>\nbecause we enjoying being with a fine bunch of folks.  Yes, we have had<br/>\ngrowth but so far it looks to be very good.  People have brought on more<br/>\nfriends and we spend a good amount of time with people getting to know them.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the things that brings success to guilds - who enjoy doing things<br/>\n(raids, runs, hunting, camping) together is working hard to maintain<br/>\ncloseness in level.  Eventually that means a lot of people are level 50.  We<br/>\nhave roughly 38 people who are &quot;planar&quot; (&gt;=46) and 34 of those are 49 or 50.<br/>\nThen 14 people who are 39 to 45. And 11 who are 30 to 36. And 6 now 20 to<br/>\n30.  And these are primary&#39;s.  Dont even ask about twinks - no one has yet<br/>\ntaken a census.<br/>\n<br/>\nOriginally I joined a guild that was focused on the &#39;role-playing&#39; aspects<br/>\nand less so on levels and such.  We had great fun doing it that way as<br/>\nwell - they were and still are a great guild and a wonderful family.  So, it<br/>\nreally depends on what you want to do.  And its not bad to have a variety of<br/>\nexperiences.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, what I have seen is a growth from &#39;pick-up&#39; groups to &#39;regular group&#39; to<br/>\n&#39;guild groups.&#39;  It&#39;s been a great deal of fun!<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Daniel P.

We normally have just under 20 total on a busy night; have a<br/>\n&gt; wizard who just hit 50 last week; a couple in the 40&#39;s; myself and about 5<br/>\n&gt; others in mid-to upper 30&#39;s...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I look forward to the future when the majority advance high enough to do<br/>\n&gt; stuff like this.
