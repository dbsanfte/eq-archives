I realised<br/>\n&gt;when I got to the temple it said 550gp.  I had everything in PP *DOH*  So<br/>\n&gt;back to the bank I went and back again.  Finally at about 10:45 last night <br/>\n&gt;I<br/>\n&gt;ended up with my first piece of lambents!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Also, I was given two amazing weapons by a very very sweet high level bard<br/>\n&gt;this weekend (as well as a few pieces of armour).  My thulian claw and<br/>\n&gt;silvery war axe have been replaced with a Sainy&#39;s Claw and a Gleaming Broad<br/>\n&gt;Sword (or is it short sword?)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Now that&#39;s what I call bards luck ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Smurf Wannabe,<br/>\n&gt;Jacana Mourningsong, Wood Elf Bard of the 20th song, Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Congrats on your last name!  Yes, as others have mentioned, you can give <br/>\nplat for the stones...<br/>\n<br/>\nI also had an interesting weekend.  In an unusual twist, I spent some time <br/>\non Friday in LGuk (we had been in Overthere for the past couple of weeks) in <br/>\nthe Assassin/Supplier room.  I hit 39 (woot!) and got a Thick Banded Belt <br/>\nwhich I won in a roll by one point... heeh  We were going to stay and try to <br/>\nget another one, but someone had to log for lunch, the rest of us got <br/>\nkilled, and someone stole our spawn while we were doing CR.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, on Saturday I amused myself by soloing my first HG... lol  Yes, I <br/>\nkited it and it took forever, but I was thrilled, and he only did 30 HP of <br/>\ndamage to me.  Flushed with success I then soloed a Griffon.  Same story.  <br/>\nSo then I decided to charm a griffon to kill an HG.  Disasterous.  <br/>\nFortunately I fled with 22hp left... hehe<br/>\n<br/>\nSunday morning, I had only an hour or so to kill, so I decided on my biggest <br/>\nchallenge.  Grimfeather!  Yes, it took forever and he caught up with me a <br/>\nfew times, taking me down to half health, but I killed him!  And yes a level <br/>\n39 bard with a MM drum can outrun him.  Of course I was rewarded for my <br/>\nefforts with a whopping 6gp and some change.  I announced to the zone that <br/>\nGrimfeather was down and the Rune of Ivy he had on him was free to the first <br/>\nranger to get to the corpse.  A level 25 ranger was thrilled to get it... <br/>\n=8^)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe rest of the time I was wandering around North Karana looking for Zahal <br/>\nthe Vile on track, but didn&#39;t see him anywhere.  Yes, I want to earn my <br/>\nwhopping 5gp and Bard faction too... lol<br/>\n<br/>\nOlgwinn Pendragun<br/>\nBard of 39 Missed Notes<br/>\nE&#39;Ci<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
