The horse<br/>\nride thing would have a fixed start and end-point - whereas a TP only has a<br/>\nfixed end-point (you can launch a TP from any location - the spell only<br/>\ndetermines where you end).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe main problem is fitting it into the current engine.  It&#39;s clear they<br/>\nwon&#39;t radically re-engineer the engine (didn&#39;t add races or levels to the<br/>\nVelious expansion).  I think a slight modification to your idea - make it a<br/>\nstagecoach.  They could simply take the code for their boats - have a<br/>\nstagecoach station instead of a dock - and basically make it an overland<br/>\nboat.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey could make it a flying carpet or some other such graphic as well..<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Matt DeBarger [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mattdeba@...\">mattdeba@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, January 09, 2001 1:53 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Patch in general(was Changes to Root/Snare)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI have given a decent amount of though to the repercussions of the &quot;horse&quot;<br/>\nidea.
