I play on<br/>\nthe Innoruuk server and have just reached lvl 12. Even though I&#39;ve been a<br/>\nbard for a while now, I still have many questions. First off, I hear about<br/>\nhow people can twist songs to get multiple effects. At what point does this<br/>\nbecome a part of everyday bard life? Right now, it works, but I guess I&#39;m<br/>\njust not used to it because I hardly ever see the use. Also, for soloing,<br/>\nwhat are two good songs to stack at my lvl?I can get to working on my<br/>\nstacking skill. :) <br/>\n´┐¢´┐¢´┐¢ Also, I have a secret for all of my fellow bards. Do pottery. Make pie<br/>\ntins until you puke. Right now, at lvl 12, I have a complete set of bronze<br/>\narmor and 250pp in the bank all because I make pie tins and sell them to NPC<br/>\nMerchants. Halas is the best place to do it´┐¢because everything you need is<br/>\nin one zone and close together. Seriously, give it a try. You will not be<br/>\ndisappointed. <br/>\n´┐¢<br/>\nSamian</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
