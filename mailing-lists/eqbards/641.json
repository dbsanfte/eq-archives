It is much better traveling with a high <br/>\nlevel spellcaster because you can be bound to highpass hold if you die and <br/>\nalso because they can do invisibility. I have found only one problem with <br/>\nthis though. I believe Selo&#39;s acclerado somehow messes up invisibility. When <br/>\nwe traveled invisible with accelerado invisibility would wear off very <br/>\nquickly at times. Often times RIGHT AFTER the wizard cast it. This got quite <br/>\nannoying and I have died several times from it. I discovered that if you <br/>\njust go invisible without the accelerado then the invisibility lasts much <br/>\nlonger.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Bob Stewart &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bstewart@...\">bstewart@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [eqbards] Kelin&#39;s Lament<br/>\n&gt;Date: Thu, 13 May 1999 11:53:09 -0400<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: Bob Stewart &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bstewart@...\">bstewart@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;At 08:45 AM 5/13/99 -0700, jay schultze wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I used to run back and forth from Freeport to Qeynos all the time (for <br/>\n&gt;many<br/>\n&gt; &gt;different reasons)...sometimes I&#39;d go to Qeynos and return to Freeport <br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;same day.
