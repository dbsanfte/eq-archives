I also imagine that killing<br/>\ndragons will raise dwarves and giants.  Seems like you basically choose one<br/>\nfaction to hurt out of the three.  Note that the minus faction hits are more<br/>\nsignificant than the plus hits so you can&#39;t kill the same number of giants<br/>\nand dwarves without expecting to be KoS to both.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo you all that have been to Velious...
