I dropped a pack that had a SBS and a PG Tommie.. imagine how<br/>\nhappy I was considering how often the stupid guy with the tommie spawns.. I<br/>\npetitioned and was told to contact verant directly and was given an email<br/>\naddress. I emailed him and he said I am sorry about your loss there is<br/>\nnothing we will do that is how it is supposed to happen..
