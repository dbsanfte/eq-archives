If someone up there casts a spell or attempts to camp out, this<br/>\nmonitor thing reports it to a GM. I don&#39;t know if it will report simply<br/>\nbeing up there.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI have also heard that the eventual solution to this is to lower the<br/>\nceiling of the zone to touch the top of the temple, therefore not allowing<br/>\nanyone to get up there.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAs for the pathing bug, Verant is *very* aware of it. A friend bard of mine<br/>\nwas one of the first on the archon when it started dropping the rubi arms<br/>\nand used to sit up there playing clarity for groupmates hours on end. He<br/>\nwould just sit himself down and go do something else for a few hours. He<br/>\nalso got good at agrro&#39;ing the entire temple and using the step trick. One<br/>\nday he saw a PC there with an odd colored name. Pink I think (before the<br/>\n/role colors were added). He watched as this PC started walking around the<br/>\ntop level very slowly, weaving in and out of the walls. Turns out the PC was<br/>\na WorldBuilder checking the pathing there. My friend ended up having to tell<br/>\nthe guy everything about what they were doing and the zone was brought down<br/>\nfor a day or so. I&#39;d guess that they couldn&#39;t fix the pathing easily and<br/>\nleft it at that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tGood Journey<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tSineras Silverlyre, The Divine Alliance (Cazic-Thule)<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Blitz Krieg [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:blitz_krieg@...\">blitz_krieg@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Saturday, January 15, 2000 2:46 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Cazic Thule Exploits (was bard vs enchanter)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Blitz Krieg&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:blitz_krieg@...\">blitz_krieg@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ok, Cazic-Thule spoiler time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is not a spoiler... This is an Exploit.  If caught, you will get<br/>\nbanned.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been fighting at the top and the bottom of the temple for about 2<br/>\nmonths now.  If you engage a mob and run to the bottom, the mob will<br/>\neventually follow you all the way down and you can fight it without<br/>\nexploiting.  The frustrating part is when a small group ( 1 or 2) will sit<br/>\nin the temple halls, steal the pulls, and exploit the mob.  (In many cases<br/>\nthis is a level 50 and a level 25 or so, get the hint?)  I normally let<br/>\npeople play however they want to play, as long as it doesn&#39;t effect me, no<br/>\nmatter how cheesy and lame the tactics may be.  However, when I head back up<br/>\nthe temple to find what happened to the Archon I pulled and find someone<br/>\nexploiting in this manner (Numerous other mobs as well), I am forced to<br/>\n/petition.  It was funny to hear from the guide that these players claimed<br/>\nto not know they are exploiting.  How can anyone kill anything without risk<br/>\nto themselves like this and think it is a fair tactic?  And when you&#39;re<br/>\nruining the fun of another group who is playing fair, at that.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo combat this, I&#39;ve started to use charm to pull when the temple holds more<br/>\ngroups than mine.  (Just to keep this thread on topic :)<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkfox Reven&#39;tsol<br/>\nXegony<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The Archon Temple is very buggy pathwise.  There are two primary ways in<br/>\n&gt; which groups exploit this:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1) A puller is SoWed and (with or without levitation) runs down the tiers<br/>\n&gt; and away from the Archon&#39;s steps to pull.  He punches a lizard in the nose<br/>\n&gt; and runs back to the group at the base of the steps.  Generally speaking<br/>\n&gt; that lizard hasn&#39;t followed him back, it is somewhere away from the Archon<br/>\n&gt; steps, aggrod and &quot;frozen&quot;.  Quite often groups will curse the bad pathing<br/>\n&gt; and run to the lizard to defeat it (nothing wrong with that).  However, if<br/>\n&gt; the puller stands *on the steps* themselves at the Archon Temple top, the<br/>\n&gt; lizard will unfreeze and run to the puller at the steps.  To be perfectly<br/>\n&gt; clear: You MUST stand upon the steps for the mobs to come to you.<br/>\n&gt; Therefore, the puller&#39;s presence on the steps becomes something of an<br/>\n </span></blockquote>on/off<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; switch for mob activity and movement.

If (when) trains of lizards occur, simply run up the sloped walls<br/>\n&gt; of the Archon&#39;s Temple and you will be both out of melee range and out of<br/>\n&gt; spell range.  The mobs will remain aggrod on you, but will mill around on<br/>\n&gt; the Archon steps.

I have *never* heard that<br/>\n&gt; running to the top to escape lizards is an exploit, only that casting from<br/>\n&gt; here is.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Use your knowledge wisely.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the fastest and easiest way to backup your files and, access them<br/>\nfrom anywhere.
