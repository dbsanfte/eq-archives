Thanks as always for all your great info!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut are you sure that ALL songs improve as you increase level? To be honest,<br/>\nI haven&#39;t done any testing in this arena. Sure, some are obvious (i.e.<br/>\nBellow damage going up every other level or so, etc). But some songs, like<br/>\nthe Healing song, seem to remain the same. Is it a subtle change, i.e. the<br/>\nHealing song heals one more point ever 5 levels? Or is it supposed to be<br/>\nsomething you notice from level to level?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again,<br/>\nTim</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
