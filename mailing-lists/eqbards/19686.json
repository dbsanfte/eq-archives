I haven t yet ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-981460734\">Reedwind,<br/>\n    Hello! I&#39;ve been a lurker here for a long time and a bard even longer<br/>\n(since June 6th 1999).  The folks on this list are great!  I haven&#39;t yet<br/>\ncontributed since I&#39;m fairly low level but I feel I have a good appreciation<br/>\nof your situation so I&#39;m posting now. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n    There seem to be three general types of bards I&#39;ve met in my travels;<br/>\nbards who  sing (twist/weave/other word of your choice), bards who melee,<br/>\nbards who think they can melee.  With normal armour and weapons, bards seem<br/>\nnaturally to choose either the first or second path.  Most twinks I&#39;ve<br/>\nencountered become the third kind of bard and don&#39;t appreciate what it is to<br/>\nbe a bard until it&#39;s too late.  It seems that you can either play a bard as<br/>\na poor melee class, or as a good bard (using melee or song as the situation<br/>\nwarrants.)<br/>\n<br/>\n    The key to playing a bard (at least at the lower levels) is to<br/>\nunderstand the capabilities of your songs and apply the right ones, with<br/>\ninstruments or without, in the appropriate situation.  Silly Songsinger has<br/>\nprovided links to excellent information about songs so I won&#39;t repeat (much)<br/>\nof it.  Let me instead explain a few of the combinations I have used.  These<br/>\ntactics worked well even though I have low stamina (67) and low strength<br/>\n(70.)  I was equipped in full leather and had a combine scimitar which I<br/>\nthen upgraded to a Dragoon dirk and some banded by 15. (Actually, I&#39;m still<br/>\nin mostly banded and some special armour that I&#39;ve picked up over the months<br/>\nand still wielding my trusty Dragoon dirk.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSoloing:<br/>\n    Soloing is something I prefer not to do since bards really shine when<br/>\ngrouped with a true tank (warrior, ranger, paladin, shadowknight are best -<br/>\nrogues and monks aren&#39;t as good unless they are hitting the back of a<br/>\ncreature.)  However, sometimes a bard is travelling around and just has to<br/>\nsolo.  I found I could solo low blues but not high blues.  With weapons, I<br/>\ncould take one low blue.  With instruments, two low blues simultaneously.<br/>\nTwinking will allow you to take on tougher creatures but I suspect the<br/>\nstrategy will still apply.<br/>\n<br/>\nSolo strategy #1:<br/>\n    Find a low blue or two that is isolated from others and equip the lute.<br/>\nStart up Hymn of Restoration (HoR), Anthem de Arms (Anthem), then pull the<br/>\ntwo with Chords of Dissonance (CoD).  Start punching while twisting those<br/>\nthree songs (the punching for 1 - 5 may not seem like much but the fight<br/>\nwill be long so it will add up.)  Depending upon the creatures you fight,<br/>\nkeeping up the twisting can be difficult.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Try to pick creatures that don&#39;t bash. When I had more experience, I<br/>\nsoloed the two gnoll guardsman in blackburrow near the door to the spike<br/>\nroom but I had mostly perfected twisting by then.  I wouldn&#39;t recommend you<br/>\nstart there because they bash and if you&#39;re not careful, you can hit other<br/>\ngnolls through the walls with your CoD and start really bad trains.  Learn<br/>\ntwisting somewhere safer first. You can practice this strategy fairly safely<br/>\nout in the Karanas on silvermist wolves and switch to gnoll reavers when you<br/>\nare a little better at it. (Stay in a zoomed out view so you can keep your<br/>\neye on anything nearby)<br/>\n<br/>\nSolo strategy #2:<br/>\n    Variant A: Find a creature or two (ideally slow creatures like scythe<br/>\nbeetles) and equip your lute.  Play Hymn of Restoration, Chords of<br/>\nDissonance, then pull with Brusco&#39;s Boastful Bellow.  If the creatures are<br/>\nslow, you can kite them around with these three songs (Hymn is needed if you<br/>\nget hit and you will when you first learn the range of your bellow and CoD.)<br/>\n(Stay in a zoomed out view so you can keep your eye on anything  nearby.)<br/>\n<br/>\n    Variant B: This tactic has a less useful and/or more difficult variant<br/>\nif you play Selo&#39;s Accelerando (Selos) with a drum, CoD with a lute, then<br/>\nBellow with either the lute to maintain a higher damage on CoD or equip the<br/>\ndrum (for more safety) in preparation for the next pulse of Selos.  You have<br/>\nto use this more dangerous variant when kiting silvermist wolves, lions, and<br/>\nother fast creatures that catch up to normal running speed.<br/>\n<br/>\nSolo strategy #3:<br/>\n    Find a single creature (or make a camp into a single creature with<br/>\nKelin&#39;s Lugubrious Lament) then equip your weapons.  I had a Dragoon Dirk<br/>\nand a Shiny Brass Shield (SBS) until I got dual wield.  Start up Anthem and<br/>\nHoR then pull the creature with Bellow.  Keep twisting those three<br/>\nthroughout the fight.<br/>\n<br/>\nGrouping:<br/>\n    Bards are best at grouping.  Try to avoid any group that considers you a<br/>\nmelee class since you will be limited to being a poor tank.  There are many<br/>\ngreat combinations you can use depending upon the members of your group, the<br/>\ntype of creatures you are fighting and the type of pull you get (solo,<br/>\nmultiples.)  Generally, I used the following:<br/>\n<br/>\nYour group against casters:<br/>\n    This one is best at level 18.  Equip the drum and play Guardian<br/>\nRhythms(GR), Elemental Rhythms(ER) or Purifying Rhythms(PR), Anthem de Arms<br/>\n(to help the tanks take down the caster quickly.)  Below 18, I usually<br/>\nequipped a drum and played ER/PR, HoR, Anthem.  A completely different<br/>\nstrategy is to use Kelin&#39;s Lucid Lullaby (Lullaby) with a lute if you can<br/>\ntake a few blasts and the caster is significantly lower level (eg. low blue,<br/>\nor green.)  It&#39;s a fast ticket to your bind point otherwise.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour group against high con solo creature:<br/>\n    Generally, your damage songs won&#39;t affect them much so stick to buffing<br/>\nthe tanks as much as possible.  Usually I equip a drum and use Anthem, HoR,<br/>\nand throw in ER for some AC buffing then later in the fight switch to the<br/>\nlute for faster healing. The extra AC from ER is only a few points but it<br/>\ncan make the difference between the tanks getting hit for max damage a lot<br/>\nvs getting hit for max less often and partial damage more often and will<br/>\ngenerally save downtime more than trying to get a bellow or CoD to stick<br/>\nwhile maintaining Anthem (the most important.)<br/>\n<br/>\nYour group against low con solo creature:<br/>\n    This should be an easy fight.  To make it even easier, I use Anthem,<br/>\nCoD, Bellow with a lute equiped and change Bellow to HoR if the tanks are<br/>\nactually taking any damage to preventatively reduce downtime afterwards.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou group against multiple low con creatures:<br/>\n    There are really many different scenarios here.  This is where the most<br/>\nvariation in tactics can occur.  The following strategies will work, even<br/>\nwith an enchanter, as long as your AE songs don&#39;t hit the creatures that the<br/>\nenchanter has mezed.  With my weak hit points and AC, I can do the<br/>\nfollowing:<br/>\n<br/>\n    - If there is a caster and two or less non-casters, I normally MR buff<br/>\nusing a drum and ER/PR + GR.  Try to start your songs after the tanks have<br/>\nengaged the caster and stay as far away from the fight as possible.  This<br/>\nwill help stick as many of the extras as possible on the tanks but you will<br/>\nget beaten.  You better hope you know how to twist songs and that the tanks<br/>\ncan take the caster down fast so you can get to the next part. ;)  After the<br/>\ncaster has been eliminated, equip the lute and play Lullaby until the tanks<br/>\nhave reduced the rest down to just one then use the tactic above for group<br/>\nvs. 1 low con.  (Note: everyone MUST /assist the main tank for this to work<br/>\nor you will be killed because everything that gets hit will beat on you<br/>\nunless it is very well occupied.)  If the tanks don&#39;t seem to know the<br/>\nmeaning of /assist, as a backup plan, try twisting HoR, CoD, and Anthem but<br/>\nyou won&#39;t be able to keep this up for long and stay alive.  You might have<br/>\nto flee so be ready to equip the drum and run. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n    - If there are 2-4 non-casters, get the tanks /assisted on one at a<br/>\ntime, and play Lullaby with a lute until they have reduded it down to one<br/>\nleft then play HoR, Anthem, CoD.  The backup plan of HoR, Anthem, CoD listed<br/>\nabove will not work in this situation.  Equip a drum and Selos to the zone<br/>\nwhile shouting out about the train if this happens. Or, an alternate escape<br/>\nstrategy is to equip the lute and play Lullaby while running behind the<br/>\ntanks to the zone.  This seems dangerous and it is, but you can pull off<br/>\nsome miraculous escapes when it works.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure how any of these strategies will change as I get to the higher<br/>\nlevels but for now, they seem to be good, at least to level 20. Thanks to<br/>\neveryone on eqbards for a lot of the ideas and strategies and sorry for the<br/>\nlong post!<br/>\n<br/>\nSincerely,<br/>\n<br/>\nAanluil &lt;Imperturbable Fellowship&gt;<br/>\n20th level Wood elf Bard<br/>\nErollisi Marr<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.

I have a 15th level bard as my secondary character and<br/>\nhe&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; an awesome change from my ranger and I&#39;m trying to figure out how to play<br/>\n&gt; him most effectivly. Lately I&#39;ve been hunting orcs in Crushbone by<br/>\nmeleeing<br/>\n&gt; them and bellowing at them, it seemed to be working better than bringing<br/>\nup<br/>\n&gt; Anthem for it&#39;s haste factor. I tried using the 15th level song to mez<br/>\nthem<br/>\n&gt; but it didn&#39;t seem to buy me anything in combat, it did help me escape a<br/>\n&gt; training one afternoon though. Is there another way I should be playing<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; encounters? Is there any place you&#39;d recomend that would be hungry for a<br/>\n&gt; bard to group at my level?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Reedwind<br/>\n&gt; 15th level bard<br/>\n&gt; Bertoxx </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
