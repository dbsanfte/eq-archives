If I were you I would hang onto that<br/>\nMane Attraction so you don&#39;t have to bother with the Siryn Hair Hood (which<br/>\nI usually wear). I did not know the stats of the Mane. If I wear you, I&#39;d<br/>\nget another helm with good AC to switch to when Cha isn&#39;t needed and you&#39;re<br/>\nin battle so looks aren&#39;t *as* important.

Another factor has entered the<br/>\n&gt;equation now that I was able to complete the Mane Attraction quest.  If you<br/>\n&gt;aren&#39;t familiar with it, the Mane Attraction quest is a sub quest for the<br/>\n&gt;ranger Raincaller bow quest.

The<br/>\n&gt;good thing about this is that you don&#39;t have to be a ranger to complete the<br/>\n&gt;Mane Attraction quest.  It will take a high level party to go deep into<br/>\n&gt;Kedge to get one of the components but other than that the other components<br/>\n&gt;are fairly easy to acquire.  One good thing about the Mane is that there is<br/>\n&gt;no visible headpiece so now I don&#39;t look like a cross between a Vulcan and<br/>\n </span></blockquote>a<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Ferengi (when I wore the BI Crown).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;When wearing the Mane, I lose one AC compared to the Exe Hood and BI Crown<br/>\n&gt;(both 5 AC).

The biggest loss is the +5 boost to all resist rates<br/>\n&gt;that the BI Crown gives.     Is +10 to CHR more important than +5 to all<br/>\n&gt;resists?  The jury remains out on that.
