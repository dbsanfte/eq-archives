You might as well say that a<br/>\n&gt;good bard player is inherently a better player than a good druid player can<br/>\n&gt;ever be because a bard is so much harder to play.  By your definition a gun<br/>\n&gt;isn&#39;t more powerful than a sword, because a sword is harder to use<br/>\n&gt;effectively.  If it is easier to accomplish the same thing with two<br/>\n&gt;different tools, but is easier with tool A than with tool B, then tool A is<br/>\n&gt;by definition more powerful than Tool B.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>nope, i&#39;m saying a good bard player will have a bigger impact on his group than<br/>\na good druid player.  i agree that the good bard player will have to work harder to<br/>\nmake that impact, but the impact is still there.<br/>\n<br/>\nthe gun analogy doesn&#39;t work for me, cuz a gun is obviously more powerful than<br/>\na sword, and it is easier to use.  we&#39;re talking about something more powerful but<br/>\nharder to use.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;They&#39;re saying, &quot;That&#39;s a big grape.&quot; and you&#39;re responding <br/>\n&gt; &gt;with, &quot;That&#39;s silly, anyone can see that it&#39;s one of the smaller <br/>\n&gt; &gt;fruits.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Darkfox<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;No, they&#39;re saying &quot;that&#39;s a big grape.&quot; and I&#39;m saying, &quot;Yeah, too bad each<br/>\n&gt;plant only produces 1.&quot;  For an equal amount of effort, not skill<br/>\n&gt;necessarily, bards get far less return than other classes.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>but, assuming &#39;&#39;size is everything&#39;&#39; (haha) regardless if the plant produces one or 20,<br/>\nthat grape is still a big grape.  you&#39;re not comparing plants, you&#39;re comparing grapes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;         Kitasi </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
