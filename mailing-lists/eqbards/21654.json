Its<br/>\nvery refreshing coming over to the Auld Country and not worrying about<br/>\nre-issuing orders.  Just something you&#39;ve got to live with, I suppose.<br/>\n<br/>\nLately in Frontier Mountains, on 3 or more giant pulls, I generally wait for<br/>\nthe tanks to do maybe 2 or 3 rounds of combat so they build up sufficient<br/>\nhate.  Then I charm one, hit F8 and order it to attack.  I melee in with the<br/>\ncrowd, twisting a couple of songs and after a few, retarget my thrall.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce the charm breaks, I recharm and am meleeing my soon-to-be-charmed<br/>\ngiant, hit F8 again and send him back into the fight.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you&#39;ve only got one mob beating on you (your ex-pet) it&#39;s not quite so<br/>\nbad.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne way of handling your situation would be:  charm, hit F8, order to<br/>\nattack.  Back off with either SoW or Selo&#39;s, keep your pet targetted,<br/>\nrecharm, run up to the crowd, hit F8 and order to attack again.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy groups love it when I charm Giants.  One level 34 Shaman even had the<br/>\naudacity to claim that Bards couldn&#39;t charm!  Oh, really?  Watch this!<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo solo&#39;d dead Tumps later, he was whistling a whole new tune. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKyrisha</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
