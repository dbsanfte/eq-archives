Our enchanter tried his<br/>\nmez and got a resist rate of 8% vs the same mobs with a 158 charisma.  And<br/>\nhis lasted a heck of a lot longer than 6 seconds.  I&#39;ll try to remember to<br/>\n/bug that the resist message is not in red since supposedly all resist<br/>\nmessages are in red.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, sorry if I have seemed to come down really hard on Verant&#39;s Dev staff.<br/>\nWe have had some serious problems in the past with the same issues and had<br/>\nto let people go.  The funny thing is the problems they had were minor<br/>\ncompared to the stuff the testers at Verant let thru.  I try to convince<br/>\npeople here how important professionalism and accepting responsibility are<br/>\nand its a tough battle sometimes.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, January 26, 2000 3:55 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] New resist message.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wed, 26 Jan 2000, Steven S.

I was fighting groups of<br/>\n&gt; faeries in lfay (that are barely blue to me) and<br/>\n&gt; getting less than 50% success rate at lullabying<br/>\n&gt; them.
