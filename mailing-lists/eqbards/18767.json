We&#39;re<br/>\ntraveling minstrels, not warriors.  Symphonic Harmony proc (Evade) and<br/>\nsummond food and drink are PERFECT for bards.  Symphonic Harmony indicrectly<br/>\ngives us a rogue skill that keeps us from taking quite so much damage.  This<br/>\nin turn makes up for some of the low AC on some of the items - assuming the<br/>\nproc WORKS (which it probably does, since the Evade skill works).  Also, the<br/>\nfood and drink that you summon can be given to your group as well.  This<br/>\nmeans that not only you, but your party members don&#39;t have to want for food<br/>\nand drink either.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I have Singing Steel Gauntlets (Enduring Breath) and they&#39;ve already<br/>\nmade my life easier several times.<br/>\n<br/>\nGuys, we&#39;re a support class not warriors remember?<br/>\n<br/>\n[51 Minstrel] Crier (Half Elf) &lt;Seekers of Norrath&gt; ZONE: work<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; fyi the stats on singing steel greaves are:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; AC 24 8str 8sta 8agi 8cha Effect: *drum roll* Summon Food<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; nice stats and AC, but gimme a break on the effect (i may be wrong on the<br/>\n&gt; stats, but the AC is right and there are defeinitely 3 or 4 stats<br/>\n&gt; +8).  the<br/>\n&gt; cobalt (warrior) greaves have effect: invisibility on top of phenomenal AC<br/>\n&gt; and stats.  what a novel thought, give a class something they<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t normally<br/>\n&gt; have and something they would absolutely love!  i mean so far the AC on<br/>\n&gt; singing steel is better than all imbrued pieces, and seems all classes<br/>\n&gt; gloves/boots/arms/bracers will have an effect and good AC but no stats,<br/>\n&gt; while the legs all have stats.   and most likely the BP when someone<br/>\n&gt; eventually finds one, supposedly all having effect: gate,<br/>\n&gt; something no melee<br/>\n&gt; class gets.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Shada<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; p.s. no i didn&#39;t get the greaves, but i did get an RBB =)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hmm, let me make sure I understand this. The effect on the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; boots and gloves<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is so powerful that they made the AC lower. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
