The pressure gets to me too quite<br/>\noften.  Its funny how people tell me &quot;oh you&#39;re in an &#39;uber&#39; guild you must<br/>\nget all sorts of loot&quot; or &quot;oh how fun to go on big raids every night!&quot;   I<br/>\nguess the grass is always greener because there are nights where I would<br/>\nkill to play an alt but can&#39;t due to guild policy and needs.  Its truly a<br/>\ndifferent game.  &quot;Fun&quot; becomes something you look forward to having once in<br/>\na while.  Hmm maybe I need a break.<br/>\n<br/>\nHalana/Tani<br/>\n&lt;Paradigm&gt;<br/>\nSolusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)<br/>\n&gt; [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:garramone@...\">garramone@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, May 10, 2001 9:04 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] Guild Loot Rules<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Aye without participation we could not kill the things we <br/>\n&gt; want to kill.  I<br/>\n&gt; had become a casual player, or even less, so that is one <br/>\n&gt; reason I decided to<br/>\n&gt; go.  Casual players can get loot, but it is only going to be <br/>\n&gt; after everyone<br/>\n&gt; else has what they want, and if you are lucky enough that the <br/>\n&gt; mob you want<br/>\n&gt; something off is still being killed.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t think I would have been kicked out or anything, but I <br/>\n&gt; also wasn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; contributing anymore.  Most of the guild plays every night or <br/>\n&gt; at least 6<br/>\n&gt; nights a week from 5:30pm on.  Recently it was asked (or <br/>\n&gt; ordered, however<br/>\n&gt; you want to see it hehe) that every member attend at least 1 <br/>\n&gt; raid per week,<br/>\n&gt; which isn&#39;t much to ask at all but I wasn&#39;t even doing that <br/>\n&gt; much when I<br/>\n&gt; quit.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Shada<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I had seen one of your previous posts a long time ago on this <br/>\n&gt; &gt; subject, but <br/>\n&gt; &gt; couldn&#39;t find it. A very involved system. I&#39;m guessing that <br/>\n&gt; &gt; there aren&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; &gt; any casual gamers in Afterlife, or if they are, they don&#39;t go <br/>\n&gt; &gt; on raids or <br/>\n&gt; &gt; if they do, they just know they will not get any loot.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; It definitely slants rewards to the full time player: Keep up <br/>\n&gt; &gt; or drop out.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
