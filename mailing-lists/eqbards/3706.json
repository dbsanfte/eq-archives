You can kill more bats than you can<br/>\nstand at low levels and spending 1sp on frosting make batwing crunchies<br/>\nwhich sell for 3.5 sp.  Ok so you only make 2.5sp each but even at a baking<br/>\nof 15 I succeed 90+% of the time and it takes seconds.  even buying the<br/>\nwings from the merchants who have more than you could ever buy in Kelethin,<br/>\nyou make over 1sp a piece, all the things stack, etc.  I too was poor,<br/>\nthough not destitute up to about 10th level.  Of all the trades, it seems<br/>\ntailoring is most broken as it is minorly profitable at low levels, but nigh<br/>\nimpossible to raise above 26 where patchwork becomes trivial, and not much<br/>\ngood even if you do, because the needed pelts are so hard to find.  In<br/>\ntrying to raise my tailoring, at 2 pts of success, I have raised my smithing<br/>\nmaking studs and boning to 33 from a start of 15.

Ok, that&#39;s well and<br/>\ngood then.<br/>\n<br/>\nI started out cooking, and what did I find?  Not only did the food sell<br/>\npoorly, but that most players only eat bread because it&#39;s the cheapest<br/>\nthing to get from the merchants.  Hmmm...ok, so I can only cook for<br/>\nmyself effectively then (and at a loss--but I can always hope that<br/>\ncooking will mean something in the future).  I&#39;m up to 24 or so in skill<br/>\nnow.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext skill, tailoring.  Here&#39;s something that actually makes a little<br/>\nmoney.  At least enough to pay for the patterns (since I hunt my own<br/>\nskins).  But what did I find?  No market--everyone wants banded armor.<br/>\nPatchwork is useless except for the lowest levels, and most of them<br/>\neither ignore auction, or have already got what they wan.  Ok, I&#39;m still<br/>\nmaking enough off of the merchants to at least get somewhere.  Up to 21<br/>\nin this skill and seeming to be stuck there (still get alot of failures<br/>\nand I can&#39;t do studded yet).<br/>\n<br/>\nTime for blacksmithing to learn to at least make the studs for my<br/>\ntailoring skill.  As far as I&#39;m concern, this is a complete loss for<br/>\nnow...the cash I spent on it set me back as a tailor because I couldn&#39;t<br/>\nafford the patterns for the longest time.  Although I was able to get<br/>\nstuds made up with a little patience.  Skill here, about 18.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, finally despairing over getting enough cash to even _think_ about<br/>\naffording banded armor, let alone getting a magical weapon (yeah, I am<br/>\nstill using my Mino), I turned to brewing.  Even figured out some of the<br/>\nrecipes without spoilers (though I turned to those after a while), and<br/>\nfound that it was even worse than cooking.  I lost even more cash at this<br/>\nthan I did at cooking (though blacksmithing cost me even more).  I even<br/>\ngot up to 25 in brewing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, what does that leave?  Hmmm, I can spend several days fishing and<br/>\neventually I&#39;ll make enough plat to afford good armor.  Or I can keep<br/>\nhunting lions, wolves, and bears in EC for tailoring, like I have been.<br/>\nI was thinking of trying pottery, but in light of what I&#39;ve been hearing,<br/>\nI&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t try to waste my money on that.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrankly, it looks like Verant wants lower level folks to be dependent on<br/>\nhandouts from higher level folks.  I find it rather sad that I can barely<br/>\nget necessities on my own each level up to level 10 and now that I&#39;m<br/>\nlevel 11, I really need banded to survive and I can&#39;t afford it, nor does<br/>\nit look like I will ever afford it soon.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my 2 copper rant,<br/>\n<br/>\nGrei<br/>\nBristlebane<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<br/>\nAbandon the search for Truth; settle for a good fantasy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nHow has ONElist changed your life?<br/>\nShare your story with us at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
