I have reached that stage in EQ where you get kinda<br/>\n&quot;bitter&quot; about some things.  I dont think I have it as bad as some others I<br/>\nknow - and I still keep playing.  But....(and these are my feelings - imho,<br/>\nymmv, yadda yadda)<br/>\n<br/>\n1. There is a strong &quot;Us vs Them&quot; atmosphere in EQ. Us being Verant and the<br/>\n&quot;Vision(tm)&quot; and the &quot;You have been summoned by the Gods (who in r/l maybe a<br/>\nsome volunteer with little or no customer service exp/training and a short<br/>\nfuse)&quot; and the Them being the players (who are probably lying, cheating,<br/>\nconiving, theiving baistiages or else why would they be asking for a res /<br/>\nitem that got lost doing a quest / help finding a corpse / return of items<br/>\nfrom rotted corpse when printed user manual has incorrect times for corpse<br/>\ndecay / etc etc.).<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Advancement in the game is based on &quot;time served&quot; 10 times more than<br/>\n&quot;skilled play.&quot;  And this makes 80 to 90 percent of the game very boring.<br/>\nOnly new places offer some relief and granted the design of them has gotten<br/>\nbetter - still after doing Seb Crypt 10 times - it gets boring.  Camping for<br/>\nexp is flat out boring.  How many hows killing aviaks / pickclaws /<br/>\nfroogluks / kobolds / guards / etc. etc. can you stand?  This may be due to<br/>\nfighting &quot;npc&#39;s&quot; rather than live ppl where each fight is dynamic. So, the<br/>\nbasis of the game maybe just boring because any AI in the NPC&#39;s is so<br/>\nlimited - and repetitive.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. The &quot;content&quot; based events/quests/lore & history has been skimpy at best.<br/>\nGranted, it&#39;s very difficult to provide RolePlay Lore when there are so many<br/>\nDuuuudz who wanna kill it and loot it.  But where is the incentive for<br/>\nplayers to do otherwise? Where are the tools to facilitate GM events? And<br/>\nthey may not have the resources to make dynamic events actually work - ie<br/>\nwhy bother if there is no money in it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, any how - I had a great year in the game.  The part i love the best is<br/>\nthe other players.  I know there are a couple others who play the game to<br/>\n&quot;live in the world&quot; (Silky? Peace? Sylly? oh that&#39;s me!) and there is fun<br/>\nstuff there.  I have had as much fun taking &quot;newbies&quot; in Rivervale to the<br/>\nSheriff, levitating and running to the rocks so we can climb to the top of<br/>\nthe mountains - as I have had doing dragons and planes.  Maybe more fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, for the younger bards reading this, take your time and play the way you<br/>\nlike.  There is a lot of fun out there.  Only when you join the quest for<br/>\nexp race and leet loots, remember to smell the roses too.  All you have to<br/>\ndo to get to level 50 is kill 1,210,314 moss snakes, skellies, aviaks,<br/>\npickclaws, froogs, kobolds, specs, etc, etc, etc.  It&#39;s a long haul but<br/>\neventually you get there.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\n&lt;The Pantheon&gt;<br/>\nMinstrel somewhere on Innoruuk...<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sba.uwm.edu/jgs/sylly\">http://www.sba.uwm.edu/jgs/sylly</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Kevin L.
