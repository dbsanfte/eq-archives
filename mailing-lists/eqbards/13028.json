If you are in a pickup<br/>\ngroup and don&#39;t know the people you are grouping with, you are taking a big<br/>\nrisk if you /consent them.  Thats one of the disadvantages of a pickup group<br/>\nI discussed below.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Get a cleric in your group and s/he will summon deads to their corpses.<br/>\n&gt; Fast<br/>\n&gt; and easy.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I agree.  I usually find myself joining pickup groups.  What I have found<br/>\n&gt; is<br/>\n&gt; that in pickup groups, players tend to look out for themselves before<br/>\n&gt; considering the welfare of the party.  To add salt to the wound, the<br/>\n&gt; problem<br/>\n&gt; is<br/>\n&gt; magnified because of the time I usually log on.  I live in Hawaii so when<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; play<br/>\n&gt; its usually after midnight on the mainland on weeknights.  When a pull<br/>\n&gt; turns<br/>\n&gt; bad<br/>\n&gt; and someone dies,  especially if it is a melee class bound in a zone far<br/>\n&gt; away,<br/>\n&gt; the party usually either breaks up because its so late at night or the<br/>\n&gt; casters<br/>\n&gt; leave the group because it will take the melee class too long to get back<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; zone they died in.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think its safe to say that Verant doesn&#39;t take situations like this into<br/>\n&gt; consideration when they have the mythical class balance tuning sessions.<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; think they just assume everyone has a regular group/guild that they play<br/>\n&gt; with<br/>\n&gt; all the time and as a result they are focused on group welfare vs personal<br/>\n&gt; welfare.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
