Let me know what you think <br/>\n&gt; and maybe it is<br/>\n&gt; something else we can post on the official EQ message board.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I would like to see a new /who command added to the game.  <br/>\n&gt; The command would<br/>\n&gt; work like this.  You type in /who &quot;zone name&quot; and it tells <br/>\n&gt; you who all is in<br/>\n&gt; that zone.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I can&#39;t think of any way this would affect any class balance issue.<br/>\n&gt; Assuming that class balance is not affected in any manner by <br/>\n&gt; adding this<br/>\n&gt; /who command, the only reason I can think of to not implement <br/>\n&gt; it is that it<br/>\n&gt; is too hard to code.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Comments?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been wanting something like this for a long time, and I agree with your<br/>\njustifications as to why this would greatly help the game. Ultimately, this<br/>\nperforms the same parsing as any other &quot;/who all XXXXX&quot; command, so I<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t think that this is all that more complicated.<br/>\n<br/>\nIdeally, they could make this &quot;who&quot; command a bit more powerful by allowing<br/>\nus to essentially &quot;grep&quot; the &quot;who all&quot; command.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an addition, I&#39;ve always had problems finding my guildmates for one of<br/>\nthe guilds that I belong to. Someone tried convincing me that there was a<br/>\n&quot;/who all guild&quot; command, but that certainly doesn&#39;t work.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor Windleaf, who belongs to &quot;Guardians of the Divine Light&quot;, I can find any<br/>\nof his buddies with a &quot;/who all guard&quot; command. But the other guildname<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t work as the GM had to tweak the name, so the guildname is &quot; Order of<br/>\nthe Sacred Nut&quot; (it&#39;s meant to be funny :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nNotice the space character in front of the name. This screws up any chance<br/>\nfor me to see who else in this guild is logged on, but was the solution by<br/>\nthe GM since there was another &quot;Order of the Sacred (something)&quot; on the<br/>\nserver and the server only recognizes the first 16 characters according to<br/>\nthe GM. So she added a &quot; &quot; in front of the name. At the time I didn&#39;t argue.<br/>\n(Believe me, it&#39;s a real long story).<br/>\n<br/>\n---Windleaf</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
