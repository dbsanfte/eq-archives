I am 29th,<br/>\nand i solo all the time, and i NEVER use bellow. Just yesterday, i<br/>\nsolo&#39;d a Full size mammoth (blue) and a Werewolf (also blue). <br/>\n<br/>\nThe way to solo at 27+ is chain/fear/heal. chain the mob so it can&#39;t<br/>\nrun, Fear it so i walks away, Whack it with your weapons, and heal<br/>\nduring the EXTRA pulse. Mamoths can hit for 100 points a round, so with<br/>\nmy HP, bellowing against it i would last about 6 rounds. With<br/>\nChain/fear/heal, i was able to solo it with about 50% hp left, probably<br/>\nonly that bad because my brass is not maxed, and i missed notes on fear<br/>\nalot.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
