Thanks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I took a peek at the Lake of Ill Omen<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and decided my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; time is probaly now best spent elsewhere, so, off to Unrest!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Unrest eh?  Never been there.  I&#39;ll check it out though.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My big question now is what songs to use when.  I discovered at 11 I could<br/>\n&gt;solo better twisting only hymn & warsong w/o instruments as opposed to<br/>\n&gt;hymn/warsong/CoD w/o instruments (weapons beat instruments hands down at<br/>\n&gt;11).  This is probably due to dropping songs while twisting 3 in less than<br/>\n&gt;perfect conditions.  Knowing this I&#39;ve got to really focus on the two most<br/>\n&gt;effective songs and what to throw in as a third if possible.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My big plan for 12 while soloing is still hymn & warsong.  I&#39;m guessing<br/>\n&gt;Bellow beats CoD (especially with weapons) so I&#39;ll through that in as a<br/>\n&gt;third song.  Or should I focus more on offense and sing warsong & bellow <br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;occasionally hymn?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Grouping really depends on the group & whether we&#39;re likely to be fighting<br/>\n&gt;singles or multiples.  But here&#39;s what I did at 11.  Any suggestions for <br/>\n&gt;12?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hymn - during battle if no healer, between battles irregardless<br/>\n&gt;CoB - if caster heavy group and I&#39;m not tanking<br/>\n&gt;warsong - if caster heavy group and I am tanking<br/>\n&gt;anthem - melee heavy group<br/>\n&gt;CoD - in battle & with hymn if additional mobs show up and start picking on<br/>\n&gt;a caster, or when pulling to get a mobs attention faster, or in battle if<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;ve switched to my lute to heal someone<br/>\n&gt;Jig - between battles when you get a caster that swears it&#39;s affecting mana<br/>\n&gt;and you&#39;re too tired to argue.  Usually I&#39;ve got Lament in that spot <br/>\n&gt;anyway.<br/>\n&gt;I rarely use either.<br/>\n&gt;E Rhythms - in place of CoB in caster heavy groups where I&#39;m not tanking, <br/>\n&gt;in<br/>\n&gt;place of hymn otherwise.  CoB/Hymn would still be that third song I&#39;d try <br/>\n&gt;to<br/>\n&gt;fit in if possible.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So now where should Bellow be used?  And do you see anything drastically<br/>\n&gt;wrong with what I&#39;ve been doing?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Peace<br/>\n&gt;Evulia, twink of twelve tunes, Tunare<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Never lose a file again.
