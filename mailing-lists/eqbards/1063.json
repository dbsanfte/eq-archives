I know he could<br/>\nmake a flute, at least, and I think a trumpet or lute as well. Anyhow, he<br/>\nnow says that he&#39;s out of the flute making business.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve also heard the rumor that gnomes can tinker instruments and I&#39;m VERY<br/>\nVERY interested in this. If anyone knows anything, please share.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;C:  Often when I play my songs my music sounds very strange.  I was<br/>\n&gt;wondering if any others have experienced this.  It definately sounds as if<br/>\n&gt;my Mandolin is out of tune, which would give credence to the usefullness of<br/>\n&gt;Lute Tuners.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Lute Tuners aren&#39;t for tuning the lute in that fashion; they are, in fact,<br/>\nthe knobs that hold the strings that you turn to tune a lute. So, they are<br/>\na lute part, to be used in the construction of a lute, not in the<br/>\nenhancement of one.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------------------------------------------<br/>\nJythri, Pencerdd of The Soerbaird<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.soerbaird.com\">http://www.soerbaird.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
