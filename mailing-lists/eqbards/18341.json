So far we&#39;ve gone with 4 groups twice<br/>\nand gotten 2 reavers once and 1 reaver the other time.  Hardly anyone does<br/>\nCoM right now, they&#39;re all in Karnor&#39;s ;)  So I&#39;m reasonably sure that the<br/>\nnumber of Reavers isn&#39;t affected by the number of groups in the zone.  To be<br/>\nhonest I dont see how the code could support something like this anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nLyrnia Jongleur<br/>\nBard of Norrath - Saryn Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
