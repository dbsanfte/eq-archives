At 35, I am not about to start<br/>\ndoing anymore twitches than needed. About the only times I can think of<br/>\nswapping to instruments are: 1) going for my horn to fear more effectively<br/>\ntil the evac goes off. (I do love having my screen scroll completely with<br/>\nthose messages that fear has just worn off!) 2) We&#39;re outside and somehow<br/>\njust got 20 mobs on us and we&#39;re oom: pulse fear, swap to drum, and run<br/>\naway! <br/>\nI twisted more songs at once and swapped between instruments and weapons<br/>\nmore frequently when lower level. Now it is rare I swap and seem to need to<br/>\ntwist fewer at one time. Maybe the difference between living and dying is<br/>\nfaster now. Of course I don&#39;t pick my grave as often as I used to either.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrilinnia Ban&#39;Sidhe<br/>\nExcalibur, Xegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
