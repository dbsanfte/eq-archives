I<br/>\nfinally asked a fellow bard about it and he told me you have to train it<br/>\nwith Caskin Marseheart upstairs in the Freeport&#39;s Bard Guild.<br/>\nWell I went to him and it still wasnt there. Am I dense or something and<br/>\nskip by it in the list? It should come after the Hand to Hand and Hide<br/>\nskill in alphabetical order, correct? I also scrolled through the entire<br/>\nlist of skills and still didn&#39;t find it listed anywhere. I also left him<br/>\nand came back several times and still didn&#39;t see it listed.<br/>\nAh well, maybe like I said, I&#39;m just dense and managed to scroll past it<br/>\n5 times without ever seeing it. I suppose I&#39;ll check again.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn another subject, I&#39;m wondering what the best strategy for using the<br/>\nmana song is.<br/>\nShould I even play it at all during combat? If I&#39;m in a group of casters<br/>\nwith only 1 tank, I usually do play the song. Or if someone says OOM<br/>\nduring combat I&#39;ll begin to sing it and tell them that the song is on<br/>\nand they should stay near me. But I&#39;m wondering how effective this is.<br/>\nAlso while resting, everyone tells me to play the mana song, even if<br/>\neveryone has like 2 bubbles of life, which is fine if there&#39;s a healer<br/>\nor 2 in the group. But most of the time, because I&#39;m singing the mana<br/>\nsong instead of the healing song, everyone in the group is left with 4<br/>\nbubbles of life.. instead of full life. The priests (clerics, druids,<br/>\nshaman) never heal everyone up to full health. They always leave<br/>\neveryone with 4 bubbles or 4 and a half bubbles of life remaining. And<br/>\nbefore I got the mana song, I always kept the entire group at full life,<br/>\nbut I find that hard to do nowadays since &quot;FM&quot; now translates into<br/>\n&quot;Incoming!&quot;. Usually this seems more efficient if your group can easily<br/>\nhandle the stuff you&#39;re fighting, but sometimes something goes wrong and<br/>\nyou&#39;re left wondering &quot;Maybe if we all had full life before battle?&quot;<br/>\nAlso, at first, I used to juggle healing song with mana song, but this<br/>\nisnt very effective for mana regeneration since it seems that the mana<br/>\nincreases only when you see the text message &quot;Your mind clears&quot; instead<br/>\nof there being an icon that lasts for 3 ticks after the song kicks in.<br/>\nAny pointers on the strategy for using this song most effectively during<br/>\nor after combat?<br/>\nI&#39;d be most interested in how ye other bards handle this.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
