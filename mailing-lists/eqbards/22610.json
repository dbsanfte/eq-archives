I seem to remember talking about this in a<br/>\nthread a while back.  We have discussed using points on and off but it<br/>\nalways comes down to the fear that they won&#39;t be assigned uniformly and also<br/>\nthat nobody would want the responsibility of maintaining such a thing.   We<br/>\nuse more of a deferment system.. aka peer pressure.. which seems to work<br/>\nmost of the time, though.  Do you like the point system? Can you use point<br/>\nfor any item you want or does it have to be an item that is &quot;clearly&quot; for<br/>\nyour class?<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and SW dropped that hammer, but one of those dang ogre-type shaman won<br/>\nit!   And we did not have such good luck with Hoshie this weekend, 2 wizards<br/>\ndo not a death squad make....<br/>\n<br/>\nHalana, 57th &quot;You have been slain by Hoshkar&quot; Shaman<br/>\nTani &quot;Monk Killer&quot; Kaat, 35th Bard <br/>\nSolusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)<br/>\n&gt; [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:garramone@...\">garramone@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Saturday, November 18, 2000 5:39 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] patch messed up my sound in EQ<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; sweet, we got a pair of those shoes last night too.  speaking <br/>\n&gt; of drops =)<br/>\n&gt; silly me, i went ahead and used some points on a Dragon Claw <br/>\n&gt; Main Gauche off<br/>\n&gt; SW (2 dropped, only myself and a ranger wanted them).  i am <br/>\n&gt; very low on<br/>\n&gt; points after getting my SSS, so i just wanted something from VP just<br/>\n&gt; because, ya know to have SOMETHING hehe, not that this sword <br/>\n&gt; ain&#39;t nice.<br/>\n&gt; so then next thing i know Hosh comes along and i use some <br/>\n&gt; more points on a<br/>\n&gt; Veldrak&#39;s Shortblade!
