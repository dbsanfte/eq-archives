If you stand on<br/>\nthe rock, you can get stuck there (can&#39;t jump off, can&#39;t move,<br/>\netc).  He tried ducking, jumping, turning, all sorts of<br/>\nthings, none of which worked.  Eventually he hit upon some<br/>\ncombination of movements which popped him through the roof<br/>\n(this happens with the Kelethin lifts too), and he found<br/>\nhimself in the cat room.  We were all around level 13 at the<br/>\ntime and there were several player corpses in there, so he was<br/>\ntoo scared to move.  Turns out Verant added a zone to West<br/>\nCommonlands just down the hall from the cat room, so he wasted<br/>\ntwo nights of play waiting for a GM when all he had to do was<br/>\nmove a few paces away.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
