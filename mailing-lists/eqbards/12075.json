The wizard has two goals in life:<br/>\n  <br/>\n  1) Stay alive.<br/>\n  2) Nuke the crap out of things.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Wizards have no technicalities to deal with, no decisions to<br/>\n  make on the fly.  They wait til X mob is at a certain health <br/>\n  and blast it.  I believe wizards are right above warriors in<br/>\n  difficulty of play, that being easy.  Bards are below enchanters <br/>\n  as far as difficulty of play on the opposite spectrum, which is<br/>\n  hard.  The only thing that&#39;s hard for wizards is to comprehend<br/>\n  they aren&#39;t the soloing class they used to be.  I rarely group<br/>\n  with wizards as they&#39;re not necessary for most of my groups to <br/>\n  function nominally.  I&#39;d most likely pick a utility caster: <br/>\n  druid or shaman, rather than a wizard.  Just not into the sheer<br/>\n  damage factor, which can most often be resisted partially or<br/>\n  fully.  I&#39;ve never seen a warrior&#39;s axe or boot get resisted. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n  On a side note, when the sh*t hits the fan, I do like having<br/>\n  a wizard around to drop something really fast.  But other than<br/>\n  bringing along IC casters for dragon/plane raids, I generally<br/>\n  stay away from wizards.<br/>\n  <br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
