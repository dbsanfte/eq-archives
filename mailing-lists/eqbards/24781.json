You only remember the bad <br/>\nones because the good ones don&#39;t say a thing about it.  You could say <br/>\nmy warrior is power lvl&#39;d.  Or you could say he grouped exclusively <br/>\nwith my enchanter from 1 to 45. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI realized after I hit send and reread what I wrote that I was a <br/>\nlittle hard on pled characters, hehe.  The &quot;don&#39;t know what they&#39;re <br/>\ndoing&quot; part is probably more important and can be found plenty in non-<br/>\npled, non-twinked people as well.  I&#39;ve just had some bad experiences <br/>\nwith characters who&#39;s skills were sorely underdeveloped for their <br/>\nlevel which put the group at risk.  I&#39;ve probably grouped with many <br/>\ntwinks/pled characters and didn&#39;t even know it. :)  What I was more <br/>\nreacting to (from my own thoughts), was the idea that people throw <br/>\nout &quot;I made 50 in 4 days!&quot; like it&#39;s some kind of badge of honor.  <br/>\nThere&#39;s exceptions to everything, but on face value, I would trust a <br/>\nLevel 50 Warrior with 50 days played MUCH more than a Level 50 <br/>\nWarrior with 10.  And that&#39;s on an EASY class to learn. :)  <br/>\nObviously, someone taking the time to research and learn a class can <br/>\nmake up for the lack of experience, tho. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBrilinnia wrote::<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Gratz Darkfox!

I couldn&#39;t <br/>\nfigure out why we were fighting all the roamers and golems when there <br/>\nwas another group there (not yours) working for exp, eheh.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpeaking of that particular CR... Anyone know if they changed the way <br/>\nCoH works?  I know it&#39;s not 100%, but it hasn&#39;t cleared aggro twice <br/>\nin the recent past.  This time it was a resisted lull in Drusella&#39;s <br/>\nroom, which normaly means I&#39;m gonna eat it, but we decided to try to <br/>\nCoH, which was superbly timed, but every last one of them rushed the <br/>\ngroup.  I had even managed to mez one of the golems so we could <br/>\neasily pull a single out of the pile. :/<br/>\n<br/>\nOh well, nothing shows you the character of the group you&#39;re in until <br/>\nyou see how they react to a CR situation... and a pretty nasty one at <br/>\nthat, hehe.  The RNG (on lull) worked in our favor the next time <br/>\naround and we got singles or duo&#39;s out of the room and Drusella <br/>\ndropped the not-so-crappy-but-not-an-NOS Rod of Oblations again. :/<br/>\n<br/>\nCongrats on 57!
