My biggest dissapointment at becoming a bard in the beginning, went to<br/>\nbuy a bow only to find we cannot use them.  I could care less that they are<br/>\nsomewhat inefficient, I just wanted to be able to use one.  It fits into<br/>\nalmost every concept of a bard in fantasy literature and games, but not in<br/>\nEQ?  Can&#39;t figure out why since it clearly is not unbalancing.<br/>\n<br/>\nActually it can be very unbalancing.  You could stand outside of combat,<br/>\nplay songs with an instrument and still be able to fire arrows into combat.<br/>\nLast I heard people were capable of doing 20+ dmg per arrow.  The trade off<br/>\nwe make for having more effective songs when played is that we&#39;re out of<br/>\ncombat and generally not doing direct damage (except of course<br/>\nbellow/discord/etc).  If we could use bows then there&#39;d be no decision to<br/>\nmake as to sing or play songs.<br/>\n<br/>\nFunny thing is 7 is all I canthink of right offhand.  I still think bards<br/>\nare a great class, most of my gripes are little things.  I still hold to my<br/>\nfeeling that I will never play another non-binding class however.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d have to concur, which is why I tend to laugh a bit when I see a bard<br/>\npetition being proposed.  There are much larger issues in the game, but<br/>\nstill it&#39;s nice to have a concise list of what we see as problem areas.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
