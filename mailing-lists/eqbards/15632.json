E.g.: I lament a Spectre and it goes from blue <br/>\n&gt; scowling to<br/>\n&gt; blue indifferent.  I have done this several times.  Not being <br/>\n&gt; a true tester,<br/>\n&gt; I cant say if it&#39;s every time but it was strange enough that <br/>\n&gt; I took note of<br/>\n&gt; it more than one time.  And walked up to the spectre very <br/>\n&gt; close to make sure<br/>\n&gt; there was no reduced agro range.  The was 0 agro range and he conned<br/>\n&gt; indifferent.  No, I did not hail him and ask for a quest but <br/>\n&gt; maybe next time<br/>\n&gt; I will.  And next time I see Kisdean Gixx I am trying this on <br/>\n&gt; him because I<br/>\n&gt; know he has a quest.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Next:  /auctions Trading one-quarter bub exp for Imbrued Greaves!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yes, we took a little jaunt to the Plane of Hate.
