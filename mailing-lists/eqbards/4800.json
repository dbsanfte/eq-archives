Two questions<br/>\n<br/>\n\t1) Will I see any advantages in EQ?  I would assume lag should be<br/>\nlessof an issue and zoning a bit faster...<br/>\n<br/>\nWith a cable modem, I still experience tremendous lag at some points.  Most<br/>\nrecently, I have been in Unrest playing in non-peak hours  (I live in Hawaii<br/>\nso when I play at night its after midnight on the mainland).  Most of the<br/>\ntime there are only around 20 people in the one.  Even with that low number<br/>\nof people, lag still hits during the peak of battle.  I am starting to<br/>\nbelieve lag is more a function of the zone you are in versus your connection<br/>\nspeed.  Other people I am grouped with all seem to experience lag at the<br/>\nsame time I do, and they have regular modem connections.  In other zones<br/>\nthis doesn&#39;t seem to be the case.  I was adventuring in the Karanas and<br/>\nBeholder all last week and I never had any lag problems.  In regards to<br/>\nzoning times, the amount of RAM you have makes a big difference.  I upgraded<br/>\nfrom 64MB to 128MB of RAM and it makes a world of difference.  I can follow<br/>\npeople into a one and get to the other side 30 seconds before they arrive.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t2) The service I&#39;ve signed up for eventually will charge $20/GB<br/>\nupstream after the first GB (i.e. the first Gigabyte is free) any idea how<br/>\nmuch data EQ is pumping upstream?<br/>\n<br/>\nCan&#39;t help you here.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
