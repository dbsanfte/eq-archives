Its the<br/>\nmanagement direction that I find appalling really, not the work the<br/>\ndevelopers do.  It&#39;s just really irritating that they insist they do lots of<br/>\ntesting, they insist they have bards among their testers, and yet every time<br/>\nthey change anything significant it breaks for bards.  My enchanter and<br/>\ndruid don&#39;t have hardly anything to complain about to compare.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile it might not be as serious a bug in real life as buying a stock, in<br/>\nterms of programming difficulty its no different.  In RL terms their product<br/>\nas a whole is trivial compared to the stock market.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m grateful for what they&#39;ve done too, but I&#39;d be a heck of a lot more<br/>\ngrateful if they&#39;d just admit it when they drop the ball instead of making<br/>\nexcuses and pretending nothing has gone wrong from their end.  I mean lets<br/>\nget serious.  When the head spell guru, GZ, sends me a personal email<br/>\nattacking me and demanding to know what I am doing differently on my tests<br/>\nto get such different results as he does in his tests, without even<br/>\nbothering to consider that his personal client is different from the one<br/>\nthat&#39;s live, is ridiculous.  How can he seriously consider any of his<br/>\nresults valid when he uses a client that&#39;s different from the one we all use<br/>\nfor his tests?  There&#39;s only one way to explain that and it has to do with<br/>\nego.  Nobody writes bug free code, I&#39;m the first to admit that.  When<br/>\nanother tester finds a bug in my code I don&#39;t take it personally, Verant&#39;s<br/>\nproblem is they all too often do.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Mike.Langlois@...\">Mike.Langlois@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Mike.Langlois@...\">Mike.Langlois@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, January 26, 2000 3:30 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] WAaahooo!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Mike.Langlois@...\">Mike.Langlois@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI imagine that the animation guy&#39;s been working on Kunark and each mob in<br/>\neach<br/>\nof the planes.  But anyway...<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t want this thread to turn ugly, so I&#39;ll stay out of  it from here on.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t believe that EQ is so buggy that it can be compared to buying the<br/>\nwrong<br/>\nstock, or having 5 keys missing on your keyboard.<br/>\nThose errors would render the software/keyboard 100 percent unusable.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery class has 40-50th lvl players.  It works.  It&#39;s fun.  It&#39;s SO<br/>\naddictive<br/>\nthat we agonize over the most trivial aspects.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also don&#39;t believe that the Verant employees who put out SO MUCH work are<br/>\na<br/>\nbunch of lazy, slack-jawed troglodytes that can&#39;t be bothered to do<br/>\nanything.<br/>\nIf anything, I think they&#39;re pushed to the wall with trying to keep up.<br/>\n<br/>\nEverybody wants something, and each change takes much time.  Changes I make<br/>\nin<br/>\ncode or process take alot of time.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow much time do you think it takes just to READ all of the input from<br/>\nplayers,<br/>\nin game and out?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d be proud if I produced something as complex and addictive as EQ.  And<br/>\nI&#39;m<br/>\ngrateful for the work they put in.<br/>\n<br/>\nGolias, Imperfect Bard in an Imperfect World<br/>\n<br/>\n====================<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Dean_Kimes@...\">Dean_Kimes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nStrumming the &#39;flute&#39; drum is an animation.  At least they could have fixed<br/>\nit so we beat on the &#39;flute&#39; drum.  Then they&#39;d be halfway there and only<br/>\nneed to change the &#39;flute&#39; into a drum when they do a graphics patch.  Also<br/>\nunless this &#39;animations&#39; guy does other work, he&#39;s been sitting around doing<br/>\nnothing most of the time.  I doubt they have a programmer who just does<br/>\nanimations for the existing game.  If so, he put a bunch of animations in<br/>\nonce, fixed the playing while sitting, and that&#39;s about it since release.<br/>\nAlso the people who could have fixed the other things like our broken song<br/>\ndin&#39;t not fix it because of time constraints.  They didn&#39;t fix it because as<br/>\nfar as they were concerned it wasn&#39;t broken.  Once they decided it was<br/>\nbroken it got fixed pretty quickly.  Same thing with Shamanic Alchemy, etc.<br/>\nThis isn&#39;t a resource issue.  All that matters is whether they think<br/>\nsomething&#39;s broken, and it takes 6+ months of customers complaints to<br/>\nconvince them that something they think works is fact broken.  That&#39;s their<br/>\nreal problem.  If we say something appears to be broken their approach is<br/>\nask some programmer if its broken, when they say no it works fine, repeat<br/>\nthat to the customer or ignore them depending on current whims.  Actually<br/>\ngetting them to test to see if it might really be broken takes a ridiculous<br/>\namount of effort.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomebody should also point out to Abashi that Microsoft doesn&#39;t put out word<br/>\nprocessors that are missing 5 letters of the alphabet when they release<br/>\nthem, and then claim they are waiting to put those in later.  His comparison<br/>\nof user complaints between Microsoft and EQ was ludicrous.  My company puts<br/>\nout software and we&#39;d for sure be getting customer complaints, in fact<br/>\nlawsuits, if we had half the bugs in our code that Verant does.  I can hear<br/>\nthe help desk now.  &quot;I know it looks like your buying a Tech fund whenever<br/>\nyou buy our Asian Growth product, but its just a graphics glitch.  We can&#39;t<br/>\nfix that in a patch right now.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n     Ki<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n$20 OFF PURCHASES FOR YOUR RABBIT AT PETOPIA.COM!<br/>\nThe Internet Pet Paradise has everything you need to keep your rabbit happy<br/>\n& healthy!
