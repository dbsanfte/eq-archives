The Austin Powers Room, both for the lovely furs<br/>\nthat cover the floors. The zone to Sol B is right there for bailing. While<br/>\nSol B doesn&#39;t sound like a *safe* place to zone to, in all the time I spent<br/>\nin the Austin Powers room I never ONCE zoned into trouble in SolB.<br/>\nI love that room, you can pull however much you want (er, and more! :o) and<br/>\nit is the perfect AE song space. I did most of the pulling, I had macros set<br/>\nup for &quot;Small Pull&quot; &quot;Big Pull&quot; and &quot;Zone&quot; then I would settle in to play AE<br/>\nsongs. The Warrior had her hands full taunting off me and the cleric spent a<br/>\ngood chunk of mana on me, but we could really handle a LOT of pull. The big<br/>\nissue is runners, you need a runner team (gotta love rogues for that).<br/>\nAnd while I am on the subject of backstabbing...at ALL times in Sol A keep<br/>\nyour back to the wall. This is not simply a good idea, you have to practice<br/>\nit absolutly every moment you are in battle. Those Fire Gobbies backstab<br/>\noften and HARD. When someone called &quot;ZONE&quot; I would sing lull, wait till they<br/>\nmade the hallway and only then follow them, with as hard as they worked<br/>\nkeeping me alive, covering them on escape was the lease I could do, I only<br/>\ndied a once or twice in weeks of hunting there and I don&#39;t think it was ever<br/>\nfor being the last one.<br/>\n<br/>\nTszaaz</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
