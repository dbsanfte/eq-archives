When enchanters cast a mezmerize<br/>\non a high level mob and get a success message, do the mobs sometimes<br/>\ncontinue to attack them?  I&#39;ve never heard one enchanter complain that this<br/>\nwas happening to them.  Based on what GZ says, you would think the rules for<br/>\nbards and enchanters would be the same for enthrall spell series and<br/>\nlullaby/pixie.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ***GZ SAYS***<br/>\n&gt; As most high level enchanters from Beta+ can tell you, there are two<br/>\n&gt; saving <br/>\n&gt; throws that happen with an &quot;Enthrall&quot; style effect (such as Kelin&#39;s Lucid <br/>\n&gt; Lullaby) hits a creature. The first saving throw is against the target&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; Magic Resistance. The second saving throw only happens with high level <br/>\n&gt; monsters - they get a secondary save based on their level. The reason for <br/>\n&gt; this is that the Enthrall effect is very, very powerful - it allows a<br/>\n&gt; single <br/>\n&gt; player to remove a creature from combat. This means that a party that<br/>\n&gt; could <br/>\n&gt; handle two &quot;X&quot; level mobs might be able to take three, or even four of<br/>\n&gt; them <br/>\n&gt; on if there is somebody around with the Enthrall effect.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Because of this (read game balance) higher level monsters have a harder<br/>\n&gt; time <br/>\n&gt; being enthralled. At lower levels, a single player can take out a single <br/>\n&gt; opponent of equal level. By mid levels this is much harder, and by high <br/>\n&gt; levels it is virtually impossible. Allowing a single player to remove one<br/>\n&gt; or <br/>\n&gt; more creatures from combat at high levels is sick level powerful - to the <br/>\n&gt; point that we designed an entire classes specialty around doing it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The second saving throw does not send a message the environment - and that<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; is something that is on our list of issues to address. There are, however,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; no bugs with the Song.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
