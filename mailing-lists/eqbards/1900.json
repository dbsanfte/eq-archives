For some reason, the client-side locations<br/>\nand the server-side locations (of players, critters, etc.) refused to stay<br/>\nsynched.  Sounds like the same problem as that that of &quot;falling off the<br/>\nboat.&quot;  BTW, the boat was apparently sometimes crashing the BB zone,<br/>\nalthough we didn&#39;t experience that for the several hours we were there.  (At<br/>\nleast we didn&#39;t notice it.)<br/>\n<br/>\nEver wondered how you can explore new regions, find profitable new critters<br/>\n(a giant scarab is a thing of beauty), have only one person die once, and<br/>\nSTILL have a lousy time?<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Zak, where did you go?  I don&#39;t see you.&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Hold on, I&#39;ll find you...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n(three minutes later)<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Zak, why are you running around in circles?&quot;<br/>\n&quot;I&#39;m NOT!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n(three minutes later)<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Zak, you didn&#39;t really run up that cliff wall, did you?&quot;<br/>\n&quot;No....&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou get the idea.  It didn&#39;t matter whether I auto-followed or did it by<br/>\nsight, he&#39;d still disappear on me.  And we didn&#39;t have this problem in<br/>\nFaydark.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnybody know if this is a Xegony-only problem (memory leak?) or if it&#39;s<br/>\nsomething broken system-wide?<br/>\n<br/>\n   -- Cypraea, level 8 tree-huggin&#39; bard (Xegony)<br/>\n<br/>\n----------<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Daniel P.

What would happen is first<br/>\nall the other players on the boat would disappear then you&#39;d get dumped... <br/>\nThe first time I was back on the dock in BB then next time on the boat on<br/>\nthe way to BB and then finally on the boat on the way to Freeport.<br/>\n <br/>\n    The reason I bring it up here - is that several whiny players claimed<br/>\nthat the cause of the crash is bards playing songs on the boat...  The first<br/>\ntime I was in fact playing a song and thought that it might contribute.  The<br/>\nsecond time - no bards were playing (assuming no one in the hold was) and it<br/>\ncrashed anyways.  I think this was true the third dump as well.  <br/>\n <br/>\n    So I am wondering if people have any experience in this.  My gut is that<br/>\nthere is no relation between the two - and this is yet another myth (like<br/>\nall bard songs will require mana!)<br/>\n <br/>\nSlyde of Xegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
