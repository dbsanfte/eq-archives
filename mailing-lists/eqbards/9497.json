It mostly depends on the target and<br/>\nwhether or not an enchanter is handy to start laying tashan down. Fiends,<br/>\nToads i can mez with little or no trouble, enchanter or not. Scarelings,<br/>\nBoogymen, Gorgons, Phantasms, Frightfingers,warrriors i can mez but they<br/>\nwake up a lot, though its still worth it imo to mez them. Tashan helps a<br/>\nlot here i have found. With the lvl 44 tashan, i can mez even knights and<br/>\nworry wraiths. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways, PoF is basically done for me, i have nothing left in the zone i<br/>\nwant (minus any new items that might pop up after the recent itemization).<br/>\nWell exceppting cazic&#39;s flute, but the first time we killed cazic we got 8<br/>\nplat. Second time we got puppet strings and a ruby crown (just worth money) :(<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd they always reset the server before he spawns, so we dont get to kill<br/>\nhim nearly often as we would like. <br/>\n<br/>\nCourse the poh just opened, and we are doing that now. Maestro needs to<br/>\ndie, bastard just ate me again lol. Course he had a mace :/<br/>\n<br/>\nGendal Concorden, lvl 50 Bard<br/>\nEnoch Lyciferous, lvl 45 Necromancer<br/>\nTunare</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
