And in a way that only<br/>\n&gt; Verant can achieve they have changed things so that now all groups will use<br/>\n&gt; the same technique (or exploit) that Verant was trying to<br/>\n&gt; stop/overcome/address &lt;sheesh&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It seems that Dragon Fear would not &#39;stick&#39; if you had 15 (or was it more<br/>\n&gt; than 15) buff icons. Did not matter much what they were, just stack 15 buff<br/>\n&gt; icons on your screen and you were resistant to Dragon Fear.  Granted some<br/>\n&gt; adventurers prolly paid dearly finding this out and perhaps they had some<br/>\n&gt; &#39;right&#39; to employ this technique.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Actually I think there&#39;s more to the &quot;exploit&quot; (bs it&#39;s a bug) than<br/>\nthis. I&#39;ve had dragon fear consistantly not stick to me with less than<br/>\nall 15 buff spots filled as well. I&#39;ve had the icon up but still been<br/>\nable to cast.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; So, now that Dragon Fear strips buffs (cancel magic/pillage enchantment<br/>\n&gt; whatever), everyone is gonna pile on as many useless buffs as possible - 15,<br/>\n&gt; 20 whatever - exactly what the so-called exploiters were doing.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Doesn&#39;t help. While I disagree that the stipping is totally random (in<br/>\nalmost every case on me it seems to take the oldest first) The sheer<br/>\nnumber that get stripped pretty well guarantee it isnt going to help.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But anyhow - I&#39;d say dont worry.  In 2004, when you go for your dragon, it<br/>\n&gt; will be a different dragon than the ones fought today just as ours are<br/>\n&gt; different from the ones fought 5 months ago.  We have new tactics; you will<br/>\n&gt; have new tactics.  I think you will have great fun when you time comes.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again I disagree. Because of the physical and software limitations of<br/>\nVerant&#39;s servers and clients, they are already pushing the limits of how<br/>\nmany people can be involved in a dragon hunt. Eventually they are going<br/>\nto push it past the number that can participate without half the people<br/>\ngoing link dead immediately. <br/>\n<br/>\nThey also have upped the effectiveness of the AoE spells. I took pretty<br/>\nwell full damage this last trip with the same cold resist gear that had<br/>\nme taking minimal damage the two trips I did before, just a week before<br/>\nthe patch (gotta love server crashes.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs well, I don&#39;t know if anyone else noticed, but at least one of their<br/>\n&quot;emergency&quot; patchs was because they forgot to buff Vox. We killed her<br/>\nafter the main patch fine (got wasted by the new, improved Nagafen) but<br/>\nwhen we went back after the next day&#39;s &quot;emergency&quot; patch, she&#39;d been<br/>\nbuffed up to be as evil as Nagafen was after the main patch.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
