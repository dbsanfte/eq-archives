Dvinn is easily killed by<br/>\na coordinated group in the high teens/low 20s.  My small<br/>\ngroup, L21 rogue, 20 cleric, 20 bard almost managed it with<br/>\njust the three of us (the AI was smart enough to attack the<br/>\ncleric every time she tried to heal us - kudos to the dev team<br/>\nfor that).  When I was there a couple days before with a full<br/>\ngroup of L18-21, we killed him and nobody dropped below 3<br/>\nbubbles.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe yields a weapon that easily outclasses a well-balanced<br/>\nweapon much less combines (which are in the 50pp range), and<br/>\nhe yields it every 15-20 minutes.  It is out of whack with the<br/>\ndifficulty of obtaining any other similar weapon.<br/>\n<br/>\nSounds like a great boon for higher levels then, but those of us still in<br/>\nthe 12-15 range can&#39;t take him, although we can scrape together 50pp.  I see<br/>\nwhat you mean, why pay 50pp for a combine spear when you can get Dvinn&#39;s<br/>\ndirk for that.
