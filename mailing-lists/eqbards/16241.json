When<br/>\nwe arrived the group was killing 2 boks, after they were dead 2 people left<br/>\nand we replaced them. 10 minutes after joining the Lord spawned with a Yak<br/>\nand we killed him. I won the roll with a 52  =P<br/>\n<br/>\nThe next time round we had 2 boks spawn and being only level 40 I was a bit<br/>\ndubious as to whether Kelins Lugubrious Lament would be resisted. Our<br/>\nwarrior was gonna pull them both but I said wait. Told the cleric to get<br/>\nready to heal me big time, I then attempted the Lament on the right bok. It<br/>\nstuck, I turned round and chained the left bok and he came solo. The group<br/>\nwas impressed and I got comments like wow, great pull mad, excellent work<br/>\nand bards are great. I was pleased to see comments like this as I often<br/>\nfeel that bards are only regarded as crack dealers. It&#39;s good to let other<br/>\npeople see the value of bards in a group over than mana song.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, pulling the 1 bok enable us to break the spawn and made life<br/>\neasier, shortly after we finished the 2nd bok another Lord with the Yak<br/>\nspawned (I didn&#39;t roll). All in all a good night, got a Yak and a Burlupp<br/>\nsack and am less than a bubble to level 41.<br/>\n<br/>\nMadagan Songweaver, Bard of 40 Songs &lt;Guardians of Light&gt;<br/>\nVeeshan Server<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________________________<br/>\nThe information contained in this message may be CONFIDENTIAL and is<br/>\nintended for the addressee only.
