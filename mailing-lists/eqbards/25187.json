I see why I didn&#39;t<br/>\nfind Tzeetch, I could not recall how to spelll the name! Anyways, I was<br/>\ntalking to Kaas about doing the undead bard/Trak. Seems that his guild,<br/>\nDeath Knights has a falling out with SoA (I haven&#39;t heard the dirt yet) and<br/>\nso they can&#39;t field enough folks to finish his epic. We were talking about<br/>\nguilds and people that he can talk to about helping do his last step. It<br/>\ndawned on me that he is pretty much in the same boat you guys are talking<br/>\nabout being in. So my question is, would it be possible for the guilds you<br/>\nguys are in to get involved? I&#39;m thinking we would end up with some DK&#39;s,<br/>\nsome Muffins, some Marauders of the Dragon and probably some of my bunch,<br/>\nVenator Sapentia. I&#39;m sure Kaas&#39;s bunch would agree to help you guys do<br/>\nGore. Now granted, there&#39;s alot of luck involved. The day/time you catch<br/>\nGore or the undead bard or whatever red dragon up may not be the day<br/>\neveryone is on or is free to drop whatever. I would have liked to go do Trak<br/>\nfor Kaas last night if the bard was up but was committed to helping Annelia<br/>\nand Sybian in Fear with their epics. This has more to do with meeting more<br/>\npeople of the right level and mindset as a start. I&#39;d like to see all the<br/>\nbards I know get their epics and I will help whenever I can. We can<br/>\ncoordinate via our ezboard if you like. I told Kaas to go start a thread on<br/>\nour general board but don&#39;t see it yet. What do you guys think?<br/>\n<br/>\nBrilinnia Ban&#39;Sidhe<br/>\nVenator Sapentia, Xegony<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
