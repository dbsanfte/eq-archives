On some nights if not too many people are in the zone my <br/>\ngroup had both room spawns and the hall spawns all to ourselves. It was fast <br/>\nand furious, non-stop fighting for nearly 2 hours.  The smallest group I <br/>\nhave help the raider room with was me, and enchantress, and a ranger, we <br/>\nbroke the spawn up so we had them one at a time and they spawned just as we <br/>\nwere done recovering from the previous fight.<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: [eqbards] Highkeep basement (was What to solo at level 27)<br/>\n&gt;Date: Wed, 27 Oct 1999 10:57:00 -1000<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I went to the first level of the Highkeep basement for the first time at <br/>\n&gt;24th<br/>\n&gt;level.  Also went back at 25th level.  Due to living in Hawaii and <br/>\n&gt;generally<br/>\n&gt;playing late at night, its usually not that crowded when I have been there. <br/>\n&gt;  One<br/>\n&gt;or two groups at most.  Despite this, it seemed there was a very long <br/>\n&gt;downtime<br/>\n&gt;in between spawns.  I think there are five spawn points on the first level <br/>\n&gt;where<br/>\n&gt;pickclaws will appear.  Two in the room off to the side.  One by the door<br/>\n&gt;leading to that room.  One in a corner further down from the doorway.  Last <br/>\n&gt;one<br/>\n&gt;on the other side of the room in a corner.  There may be more but I know <br/>\n&gt;there<br/>\n&gt;are at least five.  Even though the pickclaws gave good experience, I was <br/>\n&gt;bored<br/>\n&gt;due to all the downtime.  Didn&#39;t actually time it but I would guess the <br/>\n&gt;spawn<br/>\n&gt;rate is around 10 minutes for each spawn point.  Is the spawn rate faster<br/>\n&gt;further down in the basement?  Are there more things to fight in the <br/>\n&gt;basement<br/>\n&gt;than on the first level?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks<br/>\n&gt;Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From:\tRokenn Swiftsong [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rokenn@...\">rokenn@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sent:\tWednesday, October 27, 1999 10:43 AM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject:\tRe: [eqbards] What to solo at level 27<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Rokenn Swiftsong&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rokenn@...\">rokenn@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Doh!
