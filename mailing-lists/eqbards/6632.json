Sometimes we are able, through tact and execution, to educate<br/>\nthem in game.  When this happens, its always nice to get that complement<br/>\nwhen you have to camp for the night.  However, there are always going to be<br/>\nthose occasions when we find ourselves joining a group with someone who<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t know how to play with a bard.  I have an idea and think we should go<br/>\non the offensive.<br/>\n<br/>\nI propose that we on this list work together on creating a guide that<br/>\neducates all non-bards on the Do&#39;s and Dont&#39;s when grouping with a bard.<br/>\nThe guide would include a basic explanation of bard tactics and the<br/>\nsituations when they are used.  The guide would not need to have a complete<br/>\nanalysis of our songs, just the key ones.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOnce the guide is completed, we send it out to all the major EQ websites<br/>\nlabeling it as the Official Playing Guide for Non-bards published by the<br/>\nEQBards Onelist community, the definitive authorities on all things bardic<br/>\n(or something else along those lines:-).    <br/>\n<br/>\nMost of the info that would need to be in this guide has already been<br/>\nwritten (or still in John Kim&#39;s head).  Pulling it out of the archives<br/>\nthough will be a pain. How we go about actually creating the guide can be<br/>\nworked out later if enough people, especially the key posters on this list,<br/>\nagree that its a good idea. <br/>\n<br/>\nLet me know what you think.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
