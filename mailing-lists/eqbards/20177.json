There are diplomatic ways to direct people without having to <br/>\nbe a dictator about it. I&#39;m guilty of using far too many smilies in my <br/>\nchatting in my attempts to keep from being overbearing as I direct people <br/>\nwhile making them smile or laugh.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy perspective is that if you want to direct people, do it in a way that <br/>\nthey will respect you and have fun at the same time since this is a game <br/>\nand we&#39;re all looking to have fun. It&#39;s easy to go a little too far <br/>\ndirecting people, but if they have a right attitude it can be fun. My <br/>\nfriend always throws in &quot;guarding you with my life master&quot; comments to me <br/>\nas at times it does seem like it&#39;s me and my group of 6 pets. :-P One of <br/>\nhis characters is an enchanter, so he knows what I go through when I&#39;m <br/>\ndirecting a group.<br/>\n<br/>\nWindleaf<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 02:17 PM 6/29/00 -0600, Kimes, Dean W. wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;On that I guess I don&#39;t mind either, but the ones I&#39;ve grouped with have<br/>\n&gt;basically told everyone in the group exactly what to do and reminded them<br/>\n&gt;that if they didn&#39;t do exactly as specified and the enchanter died they were<br/>\n&gt;leaving the group.
