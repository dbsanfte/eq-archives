We would like to know when we can expect these to be implemented.<br/>\n&gt;If they are indeed in the game already (perhaps discovered via quests)<br/>\n&gt;please at least let us know that they exist.

I&#39;m 26th, play Hymn and Selo&#39;s on a nearly constant basis, and STILL<br/>\nmiss notes quite often.  If you play a song that much, you should not even<br/>\nmiss notes in your sleep.  Also, is it just bards, or do blue con&#39;s resist<br/>\nthe hell out of the caster&#39;s spells too?
