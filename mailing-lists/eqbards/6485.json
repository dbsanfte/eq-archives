Over the weekend I was <br/>\nplaying my secondary character (a lvl 15th Necro) and had the chance to <br/>\ngroup with a 16th bard, it was great!  And a lot of fun.

WE all know how absolutely wonderful it is being a<br/>\n&gt;&gt;bard.  But this class is so different from any of the other &quot;melee&quot; and<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&quot;casting&quot; classes that I honestly believe that it takes a special<br/>\n&gt;&gt;individual<br/>\n&gt;&gt;to play one and play it well (maybe I&#39;m just patting myself on the back,<br/>\n&gt;&gt;but I<br/>\n&gt;&gt;don&#39;t think so).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I also play a Level 38 druid (no, I don&#39;t kite, or I probably WOULD be <br/>\n&gt;level<br/>\n&gt;50 by now).  I have played her since day one of commercial.  In all that<br/>\n&gt;time, I have grouped with exactly THREE bards.  Not because I don&#39;t like<br/>\n&gt;grouping with bards, but simply because there are so few of them available.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Last night I had the opportunity and the unexpected pleasure of grouping<br/>\n&gt;with a level 30 bard in Cazic. *waves to Celandro*  We were doing crocs and<br/>\n&gt;praying to the EQ gods for the steel golem to spawn and drop some gloves <br/>\n&gt;for<br/>\n&gt;our cleric friend.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Because I play a bard, I am always more than happy to group with one if<br/>\n&gt;possible.  I know the strengths of a bard, I know how great they are to <br/>\n&gt;have<br/>\n&gt;in a party, but I can tell you, there is nothing like experiencing what a<br/>\n&gt;bard can do from a different perspective.  If I could have charmed Celandro<br/>\n&gt;and made him my permanent pet, I would have done it! Hehe.  I learned ALOT<br/>\n&gt;from Celandro, pestering him with questions (poor Cel!), watching him weave<br/>\n&gt;his songs, etc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;There is NOTHING like being grouped with a GOOD bard, who knows his stuff.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-Treehugger and Songmaker<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
