Furthermore, assuming that my personal belief is incorrect, I see<br/>\nnothing that does the opposite. Based on what I see in this patch, I have to<br/>\nconclude that bards are perfect and all the other classes are being balanced<br/>\nto match them, only I&#39;m not seeing any reduction of power in the other<br/>\nclasses post 50, in fact, I&#39;m seeing modest improvements for them.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Jeffrey Sue [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jsue@...\">jsue@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, February 21, 2001 1:42 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Patch Message<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 11:20 AM 2/21/01 -0500, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;all I can say is (excuse my language) what a fucking joke. 10 points per<br/>\n&gt;level above level 45?
