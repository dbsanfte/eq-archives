If you watch you<br/>\nwill see a faint blue glow around the mob when you sing it.  I have about<br/>\n80% success with dropping dmg shields on the first try with this song.  And<br/>\nrarely have I had to sing more than 2 or 3 pulses to get rid of them.<br/>\nTarget yourself after someone buffs you and sing it (it will NOT work on<br/>\nanother player unless you&#39;re duelling).  You will have to have them re-buff<br/>\nyou afterwards though ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe song works fine.  I use it all the time.  If I&#39;m in a dungeon where I<br/>\ncan expect lots of dmg shields on mobs I always keep it memmed.<br/>\n<br/>\nLyrnia Jongleur<br/>\nBard of Norrath since Beta 2<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Easy enough to test.  Get a friend (caster hopefully) and have him cast<br/>\n&gt; every buff he has on himself.  Keep hitting him with the song and see what<br/>\n&gt; happens.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It seems to me I never get a message when i use the song.  No dispel, no<br/>\n&gt; resist, just nothing happens.  Is there some trick to the song?<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
