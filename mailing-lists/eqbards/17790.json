Was about<br/>\nL15 then, and thinking back on it, we must&#39;ve let an orc run<br/>\naway.  It was still aggroed to us, but outside the range where<br/>\nit would come chase us.  It aggroed other orcs, who do what<br/>\nthey normally do (pace back and forth).  As they got near the<br/>\ntop of the far hill, they&#39;d enter the chase-aggro range and<br/>\ncome running to us.  We couldn&#39;t figure out what was going on<br/>\nbecause all these orcs kept running over the far hill for us<br/>\nnonstop.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf this was happening at the orc lift, it&#39;s likely you never<br/>\nsaw the orcs running towards you because of the Z-axis<br/>\nlimitation (you&#39;ll notice players/mobs at a different height<br/>\ndisappear from view a lot sooner than when you&#39;re just far<br/>\naway).  When they attacked, it forced a client update, and<br/>\nthey appeared to pop on top of you.  And like Rokenn said,<br/>\nbecause one had transferred its aggro to all the other orcs,<br/>\nyou got faction hits for all of them.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
