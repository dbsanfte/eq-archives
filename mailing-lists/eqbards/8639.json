While testing root/Accelerando in the<br/>\narena, I noticed that while Accelerando started after you&#39;re<br/>\nrooted will not break root, if you had Accelerando playing<br/>\nwhen you&#39;re rooted and you leave it playing, the next pulse<br/>\n*will* break the root.  So if you keep Accelerando playing<br/>\nwhile pulling from Unrest, and you&#39;re not stunned/bashed out<br/>\nof your song at an inopportune time, the longest you can be<br/>\nrooted for is 6 seconds.  I think this happens because the<br/>\nroot does not remove the Accel icon (it removes the SoW icon).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s still probably a better idea to carry a pumice stone with<br/>\nyou at all times.  One problem I noticed with the stone is<br/>\nthat it won&#39;t work if you have a song playing.  Turn off the<br/>\nsong and the stone works fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nChaining yourself will break the root as well, but you will be<br/>\nunable to get Accelerando started again until the root icon<br/>\ndisappears (which a pumice stone will do - yet another reason<br/>\nto use them).<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
