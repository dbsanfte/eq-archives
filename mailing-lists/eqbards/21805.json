Bards<br/>\n&gt;are not worthless they just don&#39;t get the treatment the class deserves and<br/>\n&gt;that other, better internally represented ones do.  Our issues are never a<br/>\n&gt;priority and we generally get the brush-off even after testing.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think bards are one of the least understood classes as they are very <br/>\ncomplicated. They wield weapons but aren&#39;t that great at them. They have <br/>\nsongs instead of spells that require no mana. It requires someone who <br/>\nstudies them to really understand how to play them effectively.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhenever I&#39;m running around and run across another bard (very rarely <br/>\nhappens) I almost always send them a tell of some sort. When I see one <br/>\nfighting nearby, I see what they sing and compliment them if they show a <br/>\ngood understanding. (of course, that&#39;s kind of arrogant since that means I <br/>\nbelieve myself to know what&#39;s good).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;EQ isn&#39;t a horrible game, quite the opposite.  Verant&#39;s customer service and<br/>\n&gt;general attitude on the other hand are horrible.  How would you feel if you<br/>\n&gt;bought a loaf of bread that was stale and the grocery store told you &quot;sorry,<br/>\n&gt;that&#39;s just the way that bread is&quot;.  Verant does the equivalent to their<br/>\n&gt;customers every day.  The guild doesn&#39;t dislike EQ, but they would never<br/>\n&gt;invest the time they put into it in another Verant game.  We have been<br/>\n&gt;gradually losing members over this for some time now.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well Verant definitely doesn&#39;t fall into the Nordstrom customer service <br/>\nrealm. But I wouldn&#39;t say their customer service is horrible. Can we &quot;agree <br/>\nto disagree? :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThey do address bard issues when it&#39;s a high priority. Remember when our <br/>\nweapons weren&#39;t proc&#39;ing anymore after one of their patches? They fixed <br/>\nthat within a day I think. I do think that bards overall are lower on their <br/>\nlist of priorities since they will support the majority of players who are <br/>\nplaying more of the popular classes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose if they upped the monthly fee all around that we could get better <br/>\ncustomer service (as staffing is the largest expense in any company). But <br/>\nI&#39;m sure their marketing research has shown that they can get the most <br/>\nnumber of people to play for $10/month and to go above that would lose them <br/>\nmany more people than they would with their current customer service. I <br/>\nknow I wouldn&#39;t play if it were $20/month. I&#39;d think you&#39;d have to be <br/>\nabsolutely nuts to want to pay $49.95/month. What was that all about? :-P<br/>\n<br/>\n---Windleaf</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
