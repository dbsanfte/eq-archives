I could not get him to respond to any other<br/>\nkeywords.<br/>\n<br/>\nInterestingly, and had I not had a lucky click of the mouse I would have<br/>\nforgotten the whole thing, I clicked on the loom in his house.  Much to my<br/>\nsurprise it opened up into a 12 slot Sewing Kit complete with combine<br/>\nbutton!  Now if I could just figure out how to get it into the bank... ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nDialog:<br/>\n<br/>\nYou say, &#39;hail Dionin Needlespin&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nDionin Needlespin   sets down a needle and thread and a bolt of cloth.<br/>\nGreetings my friend.  I am the tailor of this outpost.  We have limited<br/>\nsupplies.  I often have to preserve my tailoring supplies to [mend very<br/>\nlarge items].<br/>\n<br/>\nYou say, &#39;How do you mend very large items?&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nDionin Needlespin says &#39;I cannot use a sewing kit to mend items such as ship<br/>\nsail.  I must use my loom outside.  I have the only one available in Kunark,<br/>\nbut only I am allowed to use it.  I can&#39;t have other breaking it.  I have<br/>\nheard there is an old one in an ancient and ruined library.<br/>\n<br/>\nKitasi Faegehearper</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
