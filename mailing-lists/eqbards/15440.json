I have seen people joking<br/>\naround and they type &quot;/random 100 100&quot; so the range is basically 100-100 and<br/>\nif you aren&#39;t paying close attention it could slip past you but I&#39;m not<br/>\naware of other methods to &quot;cheat&quot; at this.  I&#39;d be curious to know how I may<br/>\nhave been cheated and what methods are used so as to recognize it happening.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a result I have been doing a &quot;seed&quot; type lotto method, if you have not<br/>\nseen this used yet chances are you will soon.  One person, usually the group<br/>\nleader is designated the master looter for rare drops.  Since we get loot<br/>\nmessages now there is no way to sneakily get around everyone knowing what<br/>\nthe loot is.  The looter then rolls &quot;/random 100 1000&quot; which returns a<br/>\nnumber like 695 for example (range of 100-1000).  This number becomes the<br/>\n&quot;Seed&quot; number and everyone then rolls 0-seed for the loot.  For example,<br/>\n&quot;/random 695&quot; and then the highest roll takes the loot.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Faras<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Joshua R.

I got invited into the Frenzie group at about 7pm, we<br/>\n&gt; broke the<br/>\n&gt; spawn in the room (3 Bloodthirsty Ghouls). The next spawn was<br/>\n&gt; the Frenzied<br/>\n&gt; Ghoul, we killed him (quite easily infact) and the leader<br/>\n&gt; looted. Then I<br/>\n&gt; saw the word &quot;Sash&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My heart was pumping so fast as I had the chance of winning<br/>\n&gt; this fabled<br/>\n&gt; item. The first person rolled and only got a 21. I then<br/>\n&gt; rolled and it came<br/>\n&gt; up 90, the excitement of this was amazing. But, I was still<br/>\n&gt; hoping no one<br/>\n&gt; beat my roll. I sat there as people rolled and low numbers<br/>\n&gt; were appearing,<br/>\n&gt; 33, 12, 39 and 28. I had won, I was now the owner of a<br/>\n&gt; loooooverly sash. I<br/>\n&gt; equipped it and immediately noticed the difference during the<br/>\n&gt; first fight.<br/>\n&gt; Sash + Celerity makes me attack very fast.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well, there you have it.
