","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1493429502\">Since you didn&#39;t give any specifics, I&#39;ll point out the 2 most likely<br/>\nculprits of your lockup problem.  Please forgive if I hit on what you&#39;ve<br/>\nalready tried.<br/>\n<br/>\n1.  Heat.  Overclocking at those speeds require a heavy duty heatsink/fan<br/>\ncombo.  I have a Globalwin FOP-38 on my 1Ghz Thunderbird running at 1.1Ghz.<br/>\nAt load, processor temperature hovers around 145 - 150 degrees F.  Just as a<br/>\nneato fact - an uncooled Tbird will burn up in 8 seconds with no cooling.<br/>\nHeat is no joke.  Add a new video card into the case, like a Geforce that<br/>\nalso requires heatsinks and fans, and that&#39;s a ton of heat in the case.  A<br/>\nproperly cooled case is also a must.  Cool air in the front bottom and out<br/>\nthe top rear.  Cables bunched up in the middle of the airflow alone could<br/>\nadd 2-6 degrees, or even more to the overall case temp.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  Overclocking methodology.  Every machine is different, and will not<br/>\nclock as fast as even an identical machine.  It is a slow process.  The<br/>\ndetails are beyond the scope of this email, but it consists of making a<br/>\nsmall increase, followed by full load testing, until the system is unstable,<br/>\nand then backing off just a little.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSince I kinda feel like I&#39;m pushing the off topic tolerance here a bit with<br/>\nthese essays (heh), again, email me directly, and I&#39;ll steer you to what is,<br/>\nIMHO, the best OC site.  The forums are the best I&#39;ve ever seen.<br/>\n<br/>\nAtonal<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Donny Dane [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ddane01@...\">ddane01@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, June 25, 2001 11:17 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: OT Hardware (was:- RE: [eqbards] New Video Card and more<br/>\nRam - th e results for me...)<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\nBoth pc&#39;s I&#39;ve tried overclocking have caused problems w/ Everquest.  PIII<br/>\n600 overclocked to 800mhz, locks up after any 8 minutes in old world zones,<br/>\nany 3 minutes in Kunark, never tried w/ velious. AMD hrm...I think it was a<br/>\n500 clocked to 675 or 700 or so...would lock up on ANY direct3d<br/>\ninput/output.  Worked great if I never accessed anything using directx,<br/>\nthough.<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
