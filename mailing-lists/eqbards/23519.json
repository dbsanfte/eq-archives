I<br/>\nthink Verant fixed the acceleration problem with it. I had to load the<br/>\nlatest drivers for it though to fix other weird sound problems that I had<br/>\nbeen having.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for everyone&#39;s comments about the possible problems that the computer has<br/>\nbeen having, I&#39;d have to agree. Over time some of the hardware may have been<br/>\nfried despite the robust cooling system.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou might want to reinstall the OS though, just to make sure. It&#39;d probably<br/>\nbe wise to make a Ghost image (if you have access to Norton Ghost) of your<br/>\nprimary partition, then wipe your primary partition and reinstall your OS.<br/>\nThat way, if it turns out it wasn&#39;t your OS, you can just restore the ghost<br/>\nimage and not have to reinstall all of your apps.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the Win 2k, I&#39;ve run EQ on both and it seems fine on Win 2k. But for<br/>\nnow, I&#39;d recommend sticking to 98se unless you like riding the bleeding edge<br/>\nof gaming. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nWindleaf</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
