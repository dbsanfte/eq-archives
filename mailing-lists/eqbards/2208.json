Or more<br/>\n&gt; specifically hunting down such fiends as Crush and<br/>\n&gt; DVinn.  Suffice my<br/>\n&gt; guild spent the day slying both Crush and DVinn and<br/>\n&gt; the occaisional spawn<br/>\n&gt; of the Warlord.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; After spending the day there with my group<br/>\n&gt; consisting of a level 19<br/>\n&gt; cleric, level 17 cleric, level 21 wiz and 19 ranger,<br/>\n&gt; I can honestly say<br/>\n&gt; that the jig definitely helps with mana<br/>\n&gt; regeneration.  However the one<br/>\n&gt; thing we applied yesterday was the wonderful notion<br/>\n&gt; of who gets the kill.<br/>\n&gt; I honestly believe that there is a major flaw with<br/>\n&gt; the way loot/exp<br/>\n&gt; is awarded to groups.  While I was camped in the<br/>\n&gt; tower it never failed to<br/>\n&gt; amaze how the looting rights were assigned.  Many<br/>\n&gt; times the party I was in<br/>\n&gt; was able to ensure that we got the kill by strictly<br/>\n&gt; planning for our wiz<br/>\n&gt; to nuke only twice.  It did not matter what anyone<br/>\n&gt; else did, only that the<br/>\n&gt; wiz nuked twice.  That way he was about to do more<br/>\n&gt; damage than anyone<br/>\n&gt; person who attacked it.  This point was driven home<br/>\n&gt; when we had a level 24<br/>\n&gt; druid camping steal killing from my group (after I<br/>\n&gt; asked her to share the <br/>\n&gt; spawns).  She would only cast three spells to steal<br/>\n&gt; kill.  Now my group in<br/>\n&gt; total would have been ablet to do 600 damage in<br/>\n&gt; total(she did about 300<br/>\n&gt; damage in total), yet she still got the kill from<br/>\n&gt; standing on the window<br/>\n&gt; sill.  Does this seem wrong to anyone?  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Treilanin Bard of Kelethin<br/>\n&gt; Honour Guard, Karana<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; BTW the funniest thing that ever happened that day<br/>\n&gt; was the moment when I<br/>\n&gt; bellowed DVinn out the window.  It was incredibly<br/>\n&gt; funny to hear the shout<br/>\n&gt; that cam afterwards.  &quot;Some high levels are training<br/>\n&gt; DVinn out of the<br/>\n&gt; castle&quot;, and all the while we were waiting for him<br/>\n&gt; to return.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ONElist members are using Shared Files in great<br/>\n&gt; ways!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Are you?
