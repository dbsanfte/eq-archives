While this has been good for the guild, I still <br/>\n&gt;have the same old problem -- what songs to play?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Pretend you are a level 54 bard, and are hunting Hate level 2 with 23 <br/>\n&gt;other people. Assume all the melee has the enchanter epic haste, and <br/>\n&gt;each group, generally, contains an enchanter, a cleric, 2 melee, and <br/>\n&gt;two caster. (Well, your group will have one caster and a bard. <br/>\n&gt;*Smiles*)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well I guess Cantana is the no brainer for non combat periods.  Casters can<br/>\nnever have too much mana or anyone have too few hit points.  If your group<br/>\nis heavy on the casters you might want to keep Cantana going during combat,<br/>\nespecially if pulls are back to back to back.<br/>\nWith all your tanks having sos and a cleric in each group during combat I<br/>\nwould think Niv&#39;s would probably the most preferd song.  Pure atk bonus<br/>\nhelp more than other bonuses for the melee folks to hit more often.<br/>\nWith GMR in place from an enchanter there is not much reason for resist<br/>\nbuffs beyond that.  I haven&#39;t seen many casting mobs that posed a serious<br/>\nproblem from their spells.<br/>\nIts more of a problem on the 1st floor, but I would shy away from ae<br/>\ntotally in hate and leave the mez/charm to the enchanters.  With 23 people<br/>\nup there thats roughly 4 groups, if each has an enchanter there shouldn&#39;t<br/>\nbe a lack of croud control.  You may want to keep a mez memed for seriously<br/>\nbad encounters that the enchanters can&#39;t get under control, but usually i<br/>\nfind that they don&#39;t like others steping on their toes.<br/>\nSince bard songs can tend to adversely affect puller that has a hord on<br/>\nhim/her I don&#39;t usually put bards in the pull group.  If any necros are up<br/>\nin hate, i would be more likely to put them in with a bard for the added<br/>\nmana regen and healing regen so that they can dump mana faster to the pull<br/>\ngroup which generally in a more mana intensive situation.<br/>\nYou might want to have Largo&#39;s memed in case the shamen goes down.  I<br/>\nassume one is in the raid force for slowing.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
