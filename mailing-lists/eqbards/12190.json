Hehe - guess that an army of dwarfs were the first ones in<br/>\nsince they could get small bronze in Unrest.  (Medium bronze drops in Sol-B<br/>\nand on a young server loads were prolly still in banded when the first wave<br/>\nhit.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\tBobby [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:merlin26@...\">merlin26@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tMonday, December 27, 1999 12:49 PM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n\t\tSubject:\tRe: [eqbards] Bug warning!
