At 11 don&#39;t bother with scawny gnolls but kill everything else. You can take an Elite<br/>\nsolo MAYBE (though without good armour maybe not) but certainly in a 2-3 person group. You will have<br/>\nto make several town runs a night, oh and get a spiked collar (3ac +3 to str and something else they<br/>\nsell in auction for about 1-2pp) do NOT get spiked shoulders, sure +5 to str but -10 to magic resist<br/>\n*yuck*. Then when you have enough plat and as there is ZERO small banded in Qeynos (at least on<br/>\nPovar) run to Faydwer and buy it there. The lower prices will be worth the run.<br/>\nIf you want to do it piecemeal then save a bit and go buy it (again ) in Faydwer. My tunic cost me<br/>\n15 pp everything else about 9pp (haven&#39;t bought pants or cloak yet, cloak will be more).<br/>\n<br/>\nThose are my two cps<br/>\n<br/>\nTszaaz, Bark of Faydark (12th) Povar, desperatly hoping the rumors of the un-trainwrecking of Rallos<br/>\nZek are true.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
