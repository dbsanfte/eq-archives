You obviously haven&#39;t read the all too numerous accounts of people,<br/>\nsome of them bards, who have been bound in a safe spot in Grobb only to die<br/>\nin Guk and get about 20 LOADING PLEASE WAIT messages before they<br/>\ndisconnected their PC because someone had accidentally trained a guard to<br/>\ntheir bind point by hitting the brilliant &#39;a&#39; key when trying th say<br/>\n&#39;What...&#39; before hitting the &#39;enter&#39; key.<br/>\nThe last one I know of a 19th level bard lost 2 full levels before he<br/>\ndisconnected and had to create a mule to move the guard so he could ever<br/>\nplay again.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi the quester<br/>\n\tLaughs at those who thinks bards can safely bind in evil cities<br/>\n\tHeck, pretty soon Qeynos and Freeport will both be evil cities to<br/>\nme!<br/>\n<br/>\nPS \tOn E&#39;ci, a well established server with dozens of 46+ players, I<br/>\nhave been the only \tone on the entire continent of Erud at least a dozen<br/>\ntimes in the last month, and \tthat was at only 1am EST!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe as bards have a much easier time being bound in evil cities. After we<br/>\ndie, we can invis past the guards, we can use our sneak ability (rogues have<br/>\nit even easier because they can sneak and hide at the same time) or with<br/>\nSelo&#39;s we can attempt to even just run right past them to the nearest zone<br/>\n(you might get whacked a time or two as you go speeding past though). <br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with the other comments regarding melee classes not wanting to bind,<br/>\nbut just being able to be bound outside of city zones. I have no problem<br/>\nwith this line of thinking. Actually, I think this change would be much more<br/>\nlikely to happen than to restrict those who already can bind.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeledal<br/>\nBard of Erollisi Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; Talies the Wanderer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:snicker@...\">snicker@...</a>&gt; 09/22 5:17 PM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>From: Talies the Wanderer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:snicker@...\">snicker@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 03:47 PM 9/22/99 -0600, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Of course, I&#39;m ignoring the fact that an item exists that allows ANY <br/>\n&gt;character to bind themselves ANYWHERE.
