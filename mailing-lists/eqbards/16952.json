Better in some ways, not so good in others.  More<br/>\nrelaxing, and also more pressure to get into bigger events.<br/>\n<br/>\nLots of server politics and so forth due to the overcrowding can make that<br/>\nfrustrating.  SOunds like you have an active guild though, which is nice =).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe day I made 50, I had a perfectly miserable night the night before; I died twice<br/>\nand had horribly long corpe recovery in lower Guk and live side.  What I thought was<br/>\nan easy 1/4 bubble to get became 1/2 bubble by the end of the night.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe next morning my in-game husband was on and we went to the safe hall on the dead<br/>\nside (near the jail) and just stayed there for an hour or so.  After I leveled, he<br/>\nhad to go for awhile, and I went and collected the rest of the pieces I needed for<br/>\nmy black and gold outfit.  I put my lambent away that day =).  And then I just sort<br/>\nof wandered around for awhile haha.  Hmmm come to think of it, someone still owes me<br/>\na party with lots of booze.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMaravana Vireo, who is terribly chatty today<br/>\n50th Bard of Jus Divinum<br/>\nwww.jusdivinum.com<br/>\nMithaniel Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTalk to your friends online with Yahoo!
