At 120 charisma against medium blues or<br/>\nlower, I&#39;d say it lasts full duration about 80% of the time -<br/>\nhigh enough that I generally weave two other songs with it.  <br/>\nAgainst high blues it&#39;s not as effective and tends to last a<br/>\nshorter time - I either just Strike over and over, or mix in<br/>\none other song.  The resists don&#39;t help either.<br/>\n<br/>\nNote that while Strike+Hymn is the only way to make this<br/>\nviable while soloing, just Striking over and over can be<br/>\nvaluable in a group when everyone is OOM, low on health, and<br/>\nthere&#39;s one mob left to kill.  You can pause it long enough<br/>\nfor everyone to get enough mana and hp to kill it comfortably.<br/>\n<br/>\nI always have this song memorized, even when grouped with an<br/>\nenchanter (they can go linkdead, or get a mob attacking them<br/>\nto where they can&#39;t mes anything much less the three other<br/>\nmobs the rest of you are fighting).  This song gives you<br/>\nsomething no other song does - time.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
