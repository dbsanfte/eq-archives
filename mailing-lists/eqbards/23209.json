When your enchanter casts<br/>\nhis slow on the same target, it overwrites Cessation because his slow is<br/>\nstronger (in terms of how much it slows down the mob&#39;s attacks).  The next<br/>\npulse of your song you can hit the mob with Cessation again, but it will<br/>\nnow only act as a DOT because the enchanter&#39;s stronger slow is already in<br/>\nplace.   The two slows will not &quot;stack&quot; cummulatively, the stronger simply<br/>\nwins.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimilarly, you can play Verses of Victory while you already have a much<br/>\nfaster enchanter haste buff.  You will get both haste buff icons at the<br/>\nsame time, but they aren&#39;t really &quot;stacking&quot;.   You are only receiving the<br/>\nstr/ac components from Verses of Victory.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSuladan Starfinder<br/>\nThe Pantheon<br/>\n58 bard, Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 16 Jan 2001 <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a> wrote:<br/>\n&gt; I would like some clarification on how our slow songs stack with<br/>\n&gt; enchanter/shaman slows.  This past weekend I was grouped with an enchanter.<br/>\n&gt; I had Chords of Cessation memmed but was not singing it until the enchanter<br/>\n&gt; slowed the mob.  During one fight the enchanter was late slowing the mob so<br/>\n&gt; I went ahead and used Cessation.  After my song went into effect, the<br/>\n&gt; enchanter cast his slow spell.  I got a message saying the my Cessation song<br/>\n&gt; wore off immediately followed by the message that the enchanter&#39;s slow spell<br/>\n&gt; stuck.  I got the Cessation effect &quot;wore off&quot; message before the song&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; normal duration passed.  So it appeared that the enchanter&#39;s slow spell<br/>\n&gt; overwrote Cessation.  So what I am wondering is if the enchanter slow spell<br/>\n&gt; actually negated Cessation or if the enchanter&#39;s slow message was an error<br/>\n&gt; and his slow did not stick?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
