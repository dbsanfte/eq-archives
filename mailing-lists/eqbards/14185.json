This is something that&#39;d be good to &quot;bug&quot; as I would<br/>\nexpect our song to not overwrite others&#39; vision buffs.

That we have a whole line that is <br/>\n&gt; just a &quot;toy&quot;<br/>\n&gt; now that they have changed the way it affects faction.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also, though, what might be affecting you is that they can see through<br/>\n&gt; illusion to your religion.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yea, this has always been strange that NPC&#39;s can tell your religion by<br/>\nlooking at you, regardless of your illusion. It&#39;s about the only time<br/>\nreligion becomes a factor, and is why we have all these agnostic enchanters<br/>\nin the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat was the change they made to the way illusions affects faction?<br/>\n<br/>\n---Windleaf</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
