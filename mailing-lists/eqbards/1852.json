Typing each line does a few<br/>\n&gt;things: it helps to simulate some of the difficulties of live<br/>\n&gt;performance (typos as missed notes) and keeps every kewldood and their<br/>\n&gt;brother from spamming us with Marilyn Manson lyrics.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree completely.  If we had any kind of scripting command, it would<br/>\nbe SO abused, it wouldn&#39;t be funny.  This is something that would have<br/>\nto be VERY limited.  I come from a BBS / Mud background as well, one<br/>\nthing I have seen people do to limit this is enforce a delay between<br/>\nlines.  (ie: No matter how fast you type, (or how well you script) you<br/>\ncannot send more than one line every 5-10 seconds.  A good start, but<br/>\nnot enough, IMHO.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;2) If we&#39;re going to solicit a command from Verant, we need to do<br/>\n&gt;something that benefits more than just a niche of bards. My proposal<br/>\n&gt;(which I feedback nearly daily now) is that a new chat command box<br/>\n&gt;be added to the chat command window (where you select languages<br/>\n&gt;and such). This new command would be an emote verb, and would work<br/>\n&gt;kind of like the /tell does there now. Here&#39;s how it works: in the<br/>\n&gt;box you would type a verb (sings, mutters, whispers, muses, etc...)<br/>\n&gt;and then, you could check a box next to it to turn it on. Then, when<br/>\n&gt;using normal speech, rather than &#39;says&#39; you would see the verb you<br/>\n&gt;entered.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I like this idea.  It&#39;s not very abusable (a few ways, but nothing worse<br/>\nthan what we have now) and it benifits more than just performers.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;As far as the script idea goes, it bears some consideration. Coming<br/>\n&gt;from a MUD background I found myself almost debilitated by the lack<br/>\n&gt;of a good macro or scripting system. ( I used to have no less than<br/>\n&gt;100 emotes queued up to keyboard shortcuts to help with RPing my<br/>\n&gt;characters. Just call me the PuppetMaster.) But like I said earlier,<br/>\n&gt;for barding, I really like the manual input.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I like the manual imput for a few reasons.  But mostly for the<br/>\natmosphere.  It doesn&#39;t seem very personal when someone just spams out a<br/>\nsong 10 lines at a time.  I&#39;ve always loved the time it takes to type<br/>\nout each line.. it adds suspence to the story.. (or song).<br/>\n<br/>\nImagine if something like this is instituted.. performing a song would<br/>\ntake no time at all..you hit your /script macro, and then you&#39;re done..<br/>\n5 seconds.. consider this announcement..<br/>\n<br/>\nSoerbaird Concert, this sunday!<br/>\nStarts: 5pm<br/>\nthere will be 9 singers!<br/>\nAfter the concert we will meet at an inn for drinks!<br/>\n(Figure 5:15 at the latest)<br/>\nBe there!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt just doesn&#39;t seem as real.  A good decent length song (with a fast<br/>\ntypist) takes about as long to type as it does to sing in RL (once you<br/>\nfigure in pauses for musical solos and such).. a five minute RL song<br/>\nwould take about that much time (give or take) to do in EQ.  I like<br/>\nthis, and a script command would just resort concerts to the following..<br/>\n<br/>\n*get&#39;s up on stage and greets crowd*<br/>\n*types in /script &quot;Latest_Song_About_Drinking.TXT&quot;*<br/>\n*Pauses for a moment or two to wait for crowd to finish reading*<br/>\n*Takes a bow and announces next performer(<br/>\n<br/>\nIt just seems so impersonal.  *shrugs* just my opinion, take it as you<br/>\nwill, I&#39;ve rambled enough.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Coincidentally, for those that didn&#39;t know, a colon &quot;:&quot; works just as<br/>\nwell as &quot;/em &quot; and is a little quicker to type.. example:<br/>\n<br/>\n/em sings, &#39;All I need in Life is a Beer!&#39;<br/>\nand<br/>\n:sings, &#39;All I need in Life is a Beer!&#39;<br/>\nWould both come out the same:<br/>\nLokar sings, &#39;All I need in life is a Beer!&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nJust thought I&#39;d throw that in there.. heh..
