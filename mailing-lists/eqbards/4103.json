Depends. I party a lot with a wood elf druid named Callaiss<br/>\n(played by my husband).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;fav blue to kill:<br/>\n </span></blockquote>    depends... I like to kill goblins, but some are green, some are blue -<br/>\nalthough I havn&#39;t checked them out since I made my new level tonite, so<br/>\nmaybe I can actually get a goblin shaman to con blue or at least black to<br/>\nme??? We&#39;ll see.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;unfav place to die in:<br/>\n </span></blockquote>    anywhere - I&#39;m not fond of dying.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;most number of deaths getting a corpse back:<br/>\n </span></blockquote>    Hmmmm.... lets see... I think it was three - it&#39;s not fun running from<br/>\nGfaydark to BBlock with nothing on and no weapons... especially when you get<br/>\nlost and an orc attacks.... although Selos does help. I guess I&#39;d better<br/>\nstick to the roads, eh?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;most number of levels with no death (if any :):<br/>\n&gt;never happen, our motto is go strange places and die there  ;)<br/>\n </span></blockquote>    that seems to be my motto as well. My husband says, &quot;it seems like every<br/>\ntime I follow you &#39;just to see what&#39;s there&#39;, we die.&quot; And it&#39;s been true<br/>\nalmost every time..... (how does that saying go, &quot;curiosity killed the cat.&quot;<br/>\n*grin*)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;please also submit a suggestion for the term to describe&gt; playing two<br/>\n </span></blockquote>songs<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;at once (don&#39;t say &#39;twisting&#39; &lt;g&gt;):<br/>\n </span></blockquote>    In one of these emails I read where someone called it &quot;weaving&quot;. I like<br/>\nthat term myself, and have started using it as such. If they had dark elf<br/>\nbards, and I played one, then maybe you could classify it as &quot;twisting&quot;<br/>\nhehehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nWeapon info??:<br/>\n    Don&#39;t have a dragoon dirk yet, and havn&#39;t seen one either. But, I&#39;m only<br/>\nL10. Right now I&#39;m using a Tentacle Whip and I love the &quot;Lifetap&quot; effect...<br/>\nit always seems to kick in just when I need it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;and tell us what in your &#39;bio&#39; screen when ppl inspect your equipment:<br/>\n </span></blockquote>    Brangwen, Bard of Light, wife to Callais of New OutRiders &quot;Joy to you<br/>\nall&quot; (I think that&#39;s what it says, or something close to that.) I&#39;m planning<br/>\non changing it soon as I found something better in a book I&#39;ve been reading.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;As far as binding goes:<br/>\n </span></blockquote>    Depends on where I am, but if I ride the boat to Freeport, Callais (the<br/>\nenchanter husband), binds me there. If I go back to Faydwer, then I&#39;m<br/>\nusually partying with Callais (the druid husband), then I must find someone<br/>\nto help me. (hmmm... is poligamy legal on Norrath?? hehehe). Anyway, I&#39;ve<br/>\nnever had a problem thus far, especially in Greater Faydark... there are<br/>\nalways people willing to help and I or Callaiss try to give them something<br/>\nfor their help.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Twinking:<br/>\n </span></blockquote>    I, too, started out as a twinked bard. My husband is in the guild &quot;New<br/>\nOutRiders&quot; and, thus, has many higher level friends. He was able, with help<br/>\nof the nice people in the guild, to procure some armor for me.... When I<br/>\nfirst started this character he gave me some leather armor, which helped a<br/>\nlot, and I was careful to not die very much. The leather is the twinked<br/>\npart - we paid for the procured items with hard earned Norrath money.<br/>\n    AS FOR twinking (or whatever the heck it&#39;s called).... I don&#39;t have a<br/>\nproblem with it, in that your characters are each separate &quot;people&quot; in the<br/>\nworld of Norrath, so.... it would be like me giving something to someone<br/>\nelse who I didn&#39;t control. Just because I am the one who plays both doesn&#39;t<br/>\nmean it&#39;s wrong. I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m making myself clear, but each character<br/>\nbeing a separate entity; why can&#39;t one give something to another....<br/>\n<br/>\n    Although we&#39;ve had the game for a while, I have only recently been able<br/>\nto play a lot (we just got a cable modem with two ip&#39;s so we can both get on<br/>\nat the same time, and, of course, had to purchase a second game for my<br/>\ncomputer). Anyway, most nights we sit in the computer room playing and<br/>\n&quot;smiting&quot; evil and, in general, having a great time.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood hunting, all!<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;may your feet be swift, your hunt be plentiful, and your songs be<br/>\nmelodious&quot;<br/>\nBrangwen -- Level 10, wood elf bard, The Rathe</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
