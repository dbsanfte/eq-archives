Scythe Beetles and Borer Beetles are<br/>\ntoo slow to catch you, and you can simply run in circles bellowing that<br/>\nboisterous voice of yours until they&#39;ve had enough. I find the effect to be<br/>\nmuch like Jythri, after several flagons of Kalish.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, though let it be whispered only amoung bards, you can manage a<br/>\nGriffawn in much the same way. I highly recommend the ancient Combine Gates<br/>\nin North Ro as a place to lay your gear whilst you hunt.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have a colder temperment, you should visit Everfrost. Nothing fills<br/>\nme more than to fell a great Mammoth with my tunes. <br/>\n<br/>\nHope you find your greener pastures...

What is there to hunt?  <br/>\nWhere should I go?<br/>\n<br/>\nI am a level 14 bard and have spent most of my life in<br/>\nthe Freeport-commonlands-Nro-oasis area...  don&#39;t get<br/>\nme wrong, there is some great hunting there and I have<br/>\nmade many friends... but I want adventure and<br/>\nexcitment ;)  I&#39;ve done some wandering on my own and<br/>\ntraveling, but I usually get really lost or reallydead... both not too<br/>\ngood.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI ask all wise bards from other areas to give me some<br/>\nadvice... what&#39;s out there?  How do I get to those<br/>\nareas that have cool stuff, like spiked collars and<br/>\nbronze armor, etc...  Anything cool out at Qeynos or<br/>\nHalas?  I&#39;ve been to Kelethin and crushbone, but the<br/>\nhuntings kinda slim, and very crowded ;)  Lately I&#39;ve<br/>\nbeen cutting down on my random adventures because I&#39;m<br/>\ntoo scared to die and lose my body in a place meant<br/>\nfor levels 40+  Where are these elementals to fight? <br/>\nWhat&#39;s in the Lavastorm mountains?  anything to hunt<br/>\nnear erudin?  Where are the dragons? (even though I<br/>\nprobably wanna stay away from that)  How do people<br/>\nkeep leveling up so high?  All those beta people know<br/>\nall the areas, I have no idea...<br/>\n<br/>\nForgive my ramblings, I just want to see the worldsemi-safely...<br/>\n<br/>\nTalian<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nLooking to expand your world?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\nONElist has over 115,000 e-mail communities from which to chose!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
