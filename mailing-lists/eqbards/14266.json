I<br/>\nactually said &quot;Yes, finally&quot; out loud to myself.  Then I see the number of<br/>\neqbard emails that are negative and it saddens me.  When did everyone get so<br/>\ninto complaining all the time?  Every time Verant fixes something someone<br/>\nelse has to complain.  They nerfed this or now this isnt fair to us.  I<br/>\nthink everyone should chill.  Verant is made up of PEOPLE.  People arent<br/>\nalways perfect and I am sure, from being a programmer myself, that they are<br/>\ntrying there damnest to get things right.  Maybe if everyone wouldnt<br/>\ncomplain about every little nittpicky thing Verant would be more receptive<br/>\nwhen there is a real problem.  And maybe they would be more willing to ask<br/>\nfor our opinions on what should change.  Instead it seems they always have<br/>\nto defend their choices or apologize.  This is a game.  A very fun one at<br/>\nthat.  When something goes wrong I live with it.  It&#39;s not going to kill me.<br/>\nI&#39;ll still be here tomorrow.  I joined this list in the very beginning so<br/>\nthat I could learn about upcoming levels and have someone to ask questions<br/>\nto if I needed.  Now I open my folder and delete, delete, delete, delete.<br/>\nToo bad.  Wouldnt it be nice if this were a happier place?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
