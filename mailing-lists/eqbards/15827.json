Interestingly as such, Verant also<br/>\n&gt; cannot ban someone for anything they say while online.  Despite the fact<br/>\n&gt; that it is in the TOS that you cannot say certain things without being<br/>\n&gt; banned, US civil liberties laws specifically prohibit anyone from<br/>\n&gt; voluntarily abrogating their own constitutional rights except in cases of<br/>\n&gt; national security.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, Verant is also a private company, and thus has the right<br/>\nto deny access to the game to anyone they want.  I don&#39;t<br/>\nrecall the Supreme Court decision governing this (way too long<br/>\nsince I took the course), but basically there was a dispute as<br/>\nto whether a private company could be forced via civil liberty<br/>\nobligations into a legal contract they didn&#39;t want.  The<br/>\nruling was that it could not, although the government could<br/>\npenalize it by witholding federal funding for that reason.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
