Those teenage boys certainly are pleased...<br/>\n<br/>\nWomen may want to look at several of the upcoming MMORPG&#39;s... one of them in <br/>\nparticular is TARGETTING women, bringing alot more community building and <br/>\ncooperation and less killing to their game (can&#39;t remember the name, <br/>\nsorry)...<br/>\n<br/>\nI know what your thinking, and obviously this type of marketting strategy <br/>\ncould be construed as sexist... and there are obviously exceptions to every <br/>\nrule... but sexist or not, it is quite an effective marketting strategy <br/>\n*cough* tomb raider *cough*...<br/>\n<br/>\nand, to make this bard related...

The clothing they get as newbies COULD be described as sexist and<br/>\nmale chauvenist crap. Why arent newbie men in lion cloths and singlets?<br/>\nAlso, for example, Wood Elf Ranger men look WAY better that Wood Elf Ranger<br/>\nWomen, they look much more like Rangers than their female counterparts.<br/>\nIt seems quite obvious the Dev Team is an all male affair.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKilesha, Level 19 Ranger<br/>\nDiscipia, Level 12 Shaman<br/>\nLycria, Level 10 Bard<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; text3.html &gt;&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
