From pressing the<br/>\nsong button to when the song effect kicks in is 3.5 seconds<br/>\n(did this several times and got 3.5 seconds each time).  For<br/>\npulsed songs (Accelerando, Restoration, etc), the delay<br/>\nbetween pulses is 6.0 seconds (timed 5 pulses).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo in theory, you could twist:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;pre&gt;<br/>\n  t     t&#39;<br/>\n 0.0    -   Push 1st song button<br/>\n 3.5   0.0  1st song effect kicks in, stop song<br/>\n 4.0   0.5  Start 2nd song<br/>\n 7.5   4.0  2nd song effect kicks in, stop song<br/>\n 8.0   4.5  Start 3rd song<br/>\n 9.5   6.0  1st song pulses for second time<br/>\n11.5   8.0  3rd song effect kicks in, stop song<br/>\n12.0   8.5  Start 4th song<br/>\n15.5  12.0  4th song effect kicks in, 1st song pulses 3rd time<br/>\n16.0  12.5  Start 1st song<br/>\n19.5  16.0  1st song effect kicks in 2 sec ahead of &quot;4th&quot; pulse<br/>\n&lt;/pre&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo given a really fast computer, connection, and perfect<br/>\ntiming, you should be able to twist 4 songs and still have <br/>\n2 seconds to spare. :-)  Hmm, maybe I should put a metronome<br/>\nnext to my computer...<br/>\n<br/>\nI also did some more Accelerando timings at level 25.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;pre&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nEffect  speed time<br/>\nNormal  1.00  1.00  (baseline)<br/>\nSelo&#39;s  1.38  0.73  (L21, no drum)<br/>\nSelo&#39;s  1.375 0.727 (L25, no drum)<br/>\nSoW     1.39  0.72  (L20 druid)<br/>\nSelo&#39;s  1.64  0.61  (L21, with drum)<br/>\nSelo&#39;s  1.70  0.59  (L25, with drum)<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;/pre&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
