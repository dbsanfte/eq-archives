He had just gotten word of another bard messenger slain in","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-666293965\">For the E&#39;ci bards:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe guildmaster of the Kelethin Songweavers Guild decided enough was enough.<br/>\nHe had just gotten word of another bard messenger slain in Lesser Faydark.<br/>\nThat made four over the past two weeks.  Like all the others, the puncture<br/>\nwounds of a vampire attack were visible on the messenger&#39;s neck.  It<br/>\nappeared that the rumors coming out of Lesser Faydark were true, Mayong<br/>\nMistmoore was back on the prowl.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor months, numerous intrepid adventurers had entered into Mayong&#39;s estate<br/>\nonly to find him mysteriously in hiding.  Despite forays deep into the<br/>\nbowels of Mayong&#39;s fortress, evidence of his existence were nowhere to be<br/>\nfound.  The reports of his absence conflicted directly with the evidence:<br/>\nfour dead bards.  If only Mayong could be taunted to appear, then perhaps<br/>\nNorrath could be rid of his evil presence once and for all.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKnowing of Mayong&#39;s deep hatred of bards, what better way, the guildmaster<br/>\ndecided, to taunt him into appearing than to hold a convention of bards in<br/>\nhis own backyard.  With a concert of all Norrathian bards filling the halls<br/>\nof Mistmoore Castle with lyric and verse, Mayong&#39;s only option will be to<br/>\npersonally end the concert himself.  Now, if only he could enlist the<br/>\nassistance of the other Kelethin guild leaders...<br/>\n<br/>\nOOC<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter reading everywhere about the raids into PoF, PoH, Kedge etc, I decided<br/>\nit might be nice if we had a raid/server event in a different zone<br/>\naccessible to lower level players.  I figured Mistmoore is a good choice<br/>\nsince the last couple of times I have been in it there weren&#39;t many people<br/>\nin the zone.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as I know, Mayong has never spawned on E&#39;ci.  The way I see it, there<br/>\nare two possible explanations.  First, by design he isn&#39;t in the game and<br/>\nwill never spawn unless Verant includes him in a future patch.  Second, the<br/>\ngroups camping the castle haven&#39;t done what it takes and/or held the castle<br/>\nlong enough to get him to spawn.  Perhaps Mayong will spawn if his<br/>\nplaceholder is killed enough by a party holding the castle.  I am hoping the<br/>\nsecond option holds true.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI petitioned and asked a guide if they could support a player run event like<br/>\nthis.  I had hoped that if the level of participation was high enough,<br/>\nVerant would participate and spawn Mayong for us.  So far I have been<br/>\nunsuccessful in getting official support lined up.  Still working on that<br/>\nthough.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe primary goal of this event is to successfully raid the castle and hold<br/>\nit for an extended period of time.  In other words, once we start the raid<br/>\nnobody has to zone out due to a train.  In order to meet this goal, here is<br/>\nwhat I have in mind:<br/>\n<br/>\nLake area:  Three groups in the low 20s to control the spawns in the lake<br/>\narea and between the lake and graveyard.<br/>\nGraveyard: Two groups.  One group in the mid 20s to control the graveyard.<br/>\nOne group in the low 20s to pull from the path between the lake and<br/>\ngraveyard.<br/>\nSecret room behind crypt: One group in their low-mid 30s<br/>\nCourtyard: Two groups in the mid-high 30s to control all the spawns in that<br/>\narea plus the ramp leading up to the castle.<br/>\nCastle:  At least four groups 40-50 to control the entire castle.  This<br/>\nrequirement is open to suggestion because I&#39;m not high enough level to know<br/>\nwhat it takes to control the house.<br/>\nReserve:  One group (levels TBD) on standby to assist any group in need.<br/>\nHealers:  A couple of clerics not in a group on standby to give EXP resses<br/>\nto anyone who needs it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the kicker to keep it in line with the storyline: whenever possible,<br/>\neach group has at least one bard in it.  Of course if your regular group of<br/>\nsix doesn&#39;t include a bard then you don&#39;t have to break up your group.  As<br/>\nan alternative, there will be bards there not in a group to temporarily join<br/>\nwith a group after a combat to help them regen mana faster (assuming no<br/>\nenchanter in the group).  Once mana regen is complete bard can disband and<br/>\n6th person can rejoin.<br/>\n<br/>\nProposed date: 15 January 2000, starting at 3PM CST.  Official time/date<br/>\nconfirmed once level of participation is known.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKnown constraints: 1) Mistmoore is known to be a buggy zone so not really<br/>\ncertain how many people it can handle without causing lag problems.  2)  Too<br/>\nmany people may show up.  Will have to rely on cooperation of everyone<br/>\ninvolved to ensure everyone has a good time.<br/>\n<br/>\nFeedback:  Request players with lots of experience fighting inside the<br/>\ncastle to send me advice on the number of groups required to safely hold the<br/>\ncastle.  Also request advice from players that have organized successful<br/>\nraids on how to handle the coordination aspects of an event like this.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you or your group is interested in participating, please send me a<br/>\nprivate email to the following email address:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bamadude@...\">bamadude@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nGaltin Randayn<br/>\n30 bard</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
