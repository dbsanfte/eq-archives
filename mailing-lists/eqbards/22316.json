I charm the mob<br/>\n </span></blockquote>(eyes<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;glaze over message), give it /pet back off (get message from pet), target a<br/>\n&gt;mob, hit auto attack, then give /pet attack command (do not get a message<br/>\n&gt;from pet).  When I follow these steps, the mob just sits there and does<br/>\n&gt;nothing.  It helps by keeping the mob from attacking us, but I would<br/>\n&gt;obviously prefer if he attacked what I told him to.  Need someone who has<br/>\n&gt;experience charming with the 39 charm song to tell me what you do to get<br/>\n&gt;your pet to attack.  BTW I do not have this problem with the 27 charm song.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> <br/>\n&gt;with the subject submissions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
