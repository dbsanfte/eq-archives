Or do i really suck.  When I have a good <br/>\n&gt; connection and low <br/>\n&gt; lag I keep four going with few drops...<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I personally stuck with 3 and only added the fourth when really really<br/>\nneeded..<br/>\n<br/>\n5? Pretty much impossible IMO<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have one song per hotkey, and I hit 1122334411223344...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I started playing a bard in beta, and one thing that was added later which<br/>\ncould helped me - If I could have gotten used to it *grin* was to make<br/>\nmacros with something like this:<br/>\nsong1<br/>\n/stopsong, pause xx? (Its been awhile since I fooled around with it so dont<br/>\nremember the timing..)<br/>\n/cast 1<br/>\n<br/>\nsong2<br/>\n/stopsong, pause xx <br/>\ncast 2<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThat way twisting can be done a bit simpler since each hotkey stops the<br/>\nprior song before starting the next:<br/>\nhit: song1, song2, song3, song1, song2, song3<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you fizzle you have the small recast delay that is needed after stopsong,<br/>\nbut nothing like if you mapped several songs to one macro.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards<br/>\nMusiker Silverdrum, Parked Minstrel on bertox<br/>\nMusiker Danesang, 20th level skald on Lancelot</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
