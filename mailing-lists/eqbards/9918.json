What color is your steel plate tinged with?  I am wearing the shin<br/>\n&gt; greaves, which I thought would look just like plate, but I have never seen<br/>\n&gt; anyone else with legs that are this color.  They appear to be a rose<br/>\ntinged<br/>\n&gt; silvery hue on me and ever since I put them on I constantly get &quot;XXXXXX is<br/>\n&gt; examining your equipment&quot; or whatever that message is.  The wood elf<br/>\nfemales<br/>\n&gt; I have seen in what looked like steel plate were blue tinged.  Is this the<br/>\n&gt; normal appearance of steel plate on wood elves?  If the rose color is<br/>\nnormal<br/>\n&gt; then I guess I have never seen any wood elves in steel plate on E&#39;ci.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kitasi<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject lol.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
