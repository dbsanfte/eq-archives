Get invised vs<br/>\nundead and from the bedroom take the left tunnel out, hug the left wall if<br/>\nbats are there and squeek by their agro radius.  Follow the tunnel a few<br/>\npaces until you see the chamber with the Greater Ice Bone Skeletons (GIBS)<br/>\nin it.  If you&#39;re on a crowded server they may be all pulled.  If they are<br/>\nthere, know that they do see through invis vs undead.  Hug the right wall<br/>\nthis time and you will just squeek past their agro radius.  Follow the<br/>\ntunnel a bit more and you&#39;ll see four or five steps leading up to some stone<br/>\nwalkways.  There&#39;s usually two frogs stationed here.  Up the steps, straight<br/>\nalong into some buildings where you&#39;ll shortly be forced to take a left.<br/>\nTurn left 90 degrees and about 50 feet in front of you you&#39;ll see a ladder.<br/>\nClimb that ladder (it&#39;s pretty short) and you&#39;ll be in the &quot;tower&quot; where the<br/>\nAssassin spawns - it&#39;s a fairly small room with barrels in it.  There&#39;s<br/>\neither three or four spawn spots in this little room, and you get some<br/>\nwizzies and stuff spawning.  This room is not that hard for a group in the<br/>\nlow to mid thirties to hold if they aren&#39;t stupid.  Once you get a grasp on<br/>\nthe room you can pull stuff from nearby up into this room for experience.<br/>\nAnd as always in Lower Guk - no runners.

How do I get to the room? I have several<br/>\n&gt; maps, but they<br/>\n&gt; are all a bit sketchy in the assasin area, and I&#39;ve heard there<br/>\n&gt; are ladders<br/>\n&gt; involved.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 2) Does anyone know what level group usually camps the room, or what the<br/>\n&gt; common loot practices are? (eg. if I go for the mask, will I be excluded<br/>\n&gt; from the other loot since I can use the mask, or is it not even counted<br/>\n&gt; since it&#39;s no drop) It&#39;s not that I care, I&#39;ll go either way, I&#39;m just<br/>\n&gt; curious.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 3) Is there anything in particular I need to watch out for?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; Draelon Stormsong<br/>\n&gt; the Tribunal </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
