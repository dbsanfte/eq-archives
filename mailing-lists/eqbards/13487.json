There are six bard quests and each quest requires you to<br/>\nobtain three items to get the reward.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbashi posted earlier that 200+ class specific items were included in the<br/>\nnew patch.  It appears that most, if not all, of these 200+ items are<br/>\nrelated to the PoA quests. Each class gets six quests.  Thats 84 new items.<br/>\nI only looked at the bard quests, but assuming all class quests require<br/>\nthree components, thats 252 quests components (84 x3).  Some of the quest<br/>\nused the same components so this number is probably a lot lower.  Most of<br/>\nthe quest components were items I had never heard of so I don&#39;t know if they<br/>\nare dropped only in PoA or in other zones.  I assume the 200+ class specific<br/>\nitems Abashi referred to were the 84 quest reward items and the 252+/- quest<br/>\ncomponents.<br/>\n<br/>\nRant on: <br/>\nI have no problems with Verant adding more stuff for the 46+ players to do.<br/>\nThat gets them out of the zone where I&#39;m at.  What I do have a concern with<br/>\nis the apparent lack of attention given to players less than 46th level.<br/>\nWith the exception of the class armor quests added a few months back and new<br/>\nloot found in Paw, almost every new item/quest that has been recently (past<br/>\nfew months) added to the game is geared toward the 46+ player.  I am not<br/>\naware of any new items/quests added to the game geared toward medium level<br/>\ncharacters.  Perhaps my observation is subjective, but it seems to me that<br/>\nVerant is focusing on keeping the 46+ characters happy at the expense of the<br/>\n45- characters. Am I out of line thinking this way?<br/>\n<br/>\nCaveat: Its quite possible that the new PoA quest component items are<br/>\nusuable until they are traded in and obtainable in zones outside of PoA.<br/>\nIts also possible that these items are ideally suited for use by medium to<br/>\nhigh level characters.  If this turns out to be true I&#39;ll eat my words.<br/>\n<br/>\nRant off<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n32 bard</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
