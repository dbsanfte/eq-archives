Different armor<br/>\n&gt;types should offer different forms of protection.

Assuming that there are three<br/>\n&gt;&gt;types of damage (slash, pierce, and blunt) various armors protect various<br/>\n&gt;&gt;ways. From what I&#39;ve seen and heard, most of these are factored in here.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Cloth armor isn&#39;t really gonna do much since it is easy to puncture, easy<br/>\n&gt;&gt;to cut through, and offers very little padding to slow the impact of<br/>\n&gt;&gt;something big and round.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Patchwork usually provides a bit more protection against slash and blunt<br/>\n&gt;&gt;since it is slightly thicker than cloth. Piercing it may not improve<br/>\n&gt;&gt;against.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; The various leathers (rawhide and normal) are better against piercing and<br/>\n&gt;&gt;much better against slashing because of the toughness of it. Some are<br/>\n </span></blockquote>often<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;padded decently so it takes the edge off of blunt damage.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Studded leather would most likely improve upon slashing since the metal<br/>\n&gt;&gt;studs would help stop the blade but wouldn&#39;t do much for piercing since<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;studs cover such a small area. Blunt might actually hurt more if it hits<br/>\n&gt;one<br/>\n&gt;&gt;of the studs and drives it into your chest. =)<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Reinforced is the same thing but now there is more surface area to stop<br/>\n&gt;&gt;piercing.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Ring mail works much better against slash since you naw have a shell of<br/>\n&gt;&gt;metal around you. Blunt is slightly better since the rings are just linked<br/>\n&gt;&gt;and allows for force transferrence over a wider area. Not great though<br/>\n&gt;&gt;seeing as how much it gives into you. Piercing? Well, all those rings with<br/>\n&gt;&gt;the big holes in them doesn&#39;t stop much of a point. You&#39;d basically be<br/>\n&gt;&gt;reduced to whatever padding is underneath.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Chain is the same as ring but usually has tigher links making it a bit<br/>\n&gt;more<br/>\n&gt;&gt;difficult to slip a piercer in.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Banded, similar to splint and scale in other game systems, improves<br/>\n&gt;against<br/>\n&gt;&gt;piercers quite a bit now that most of those holes are filled up. Still<br/>\n </span></blockquote>some<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;between the plates though. Slashing prolly isn&#39;t much better than chain<br/>\n </span></blockquote>but<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;blunt is probably better now that you have plates of metal that won&#39;t give<br/>\n&gt;&gt;as easily.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Plate, of course, is usually considered the best. It offers very good<br/>\n&gt;&gt;protection against slashers since it is often hard to cut metal. Blunt is<br/>\n&gt;&gt;really good since you have that rigitity of a real big piece of metal.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Piercing is better since there are relatively few holes to sneak through<br/>\n&gt;&gt;unless you want to try and force the point of a dagger or rapier through a<br/>\n&gt;&gt;quarter inch of steel.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Hope this helps.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Good Journey,<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Sineras Silverlyre (Cazic-Thule)<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;&gt;From: David Rubino [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tigger@...\">tigger@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Sent: Monday, May 17, 1999 1:16 PM<br/>\n&gt;&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt;Subject: [eqbards] Platemail vs Banded vs Leather<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;From: David Rubino &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tigger@...\">tigger@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Hello all . . .<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I completed my set of bronze armor, and now I have a few questions about<br/>\n&gt;&gt;it if anyone can help.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; AC continues to be a mystery.
