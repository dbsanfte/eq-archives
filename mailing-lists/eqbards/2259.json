I was in Lesser Fay<br/>\nlast nite hunting for Crookstinger last nite, blast his elusive hide, when<br/>\nall of a sudden a passing cleric started healing me.  I thanked him and told<br/>\nhim he could save his mana as I was able to play a healing song that kept me<br/>\nin good shape.  He sais he had no idea bards could heal themselves???<br/>\nAnyways we ended up teaming up for a bit of bandit bashing while we waited<br/>\nfor Crookstinger to show his ugly mug.  He finally did, but still no dagger.<br/>\nthe cleric told me it was real nice not to have to blow all his mana after<br/>\none lousy bandit cause he knew I could heal him of 100 pts before the next<br/>\none showed up.  I didnt have the heart to tell him that was without my<br/>\nmandolin.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I have another name from the depths of Lesser Fay to add to my book of<br/>\ngrudges.  Some brownie named Bracken Underbrush, a high level druid,<br/>\nambushed me as I headed back from the wood elf outpost to Greater Faydark.<br/>\nWith SOW he was able to stay in range for some stunning spells and a lot of<br/>\nstings and blasts.  Ouch, where the heck did this guy come from anyway?<br/>\nHave the brownies taken to wandering at the bandits behest?  He assaulted me<br/>\nagain on that hallowed hill but I was able to pop up a drum and race to the<br/>\nzone.  He totally ignored the other 3 on the hill despite them being lower<br/>\nlevel and my never having killed a single brownie, faerie, pixie, or other<br/>\ndiminutive humanoid.  Some day Bracken, some day...<br/>\n<br/>\n                  Kitasi<br/>\n     The mournful bard of Faydwer on E&#39;ci<br/>\n      &quot;and no one shall work for money, <br/>\n       and no one shall work for fame&quot;<br/>\n     &quot;but each for the joy of the working,             <br/>\n        and each to his separate star...&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
