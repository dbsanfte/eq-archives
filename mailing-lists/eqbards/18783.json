(A lot of my hunting is","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-945982726\">I don&#39;t want the AC so that I can tank...  I want the AC so that I can<br/>\nsurvive when more than one mob suddenly pops up at your door.  (A lot of my<br/>\nhunting is done in the traditional 6 man group, not multi-group raids, so<br/>\nenchanters aren&#39;t always a luxury).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy cleric suffers the same burden, but to a lesser degree -- unless the<br/>\npuller is almost dead, I can wait a few moments before throwing that heal<br/>\nthat&#39;s going to attract attention to me, allowing tanks to taunt, casters to<br/>\nroot, or enchanters to mez.  No effectiveness is lost.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith my bard, if I don&#39;t recognize the new comers quick enough to stop my<br/>\nsongs, I&#39;m the new meal.  I have to stop my group songs, reducing my<br/>\neffectiveness until things are under control.  Even with the new &quot;evade&quot;<br/>\ntype song, someone else has to have pissed the mobs off for them to get off<br/>\nme -- it&#39;s a hate lowering tool, not a mem blur.  Once the new comers<br/>\narrive, I&#39;m basically going one on one (or more) with the new mobs while I<br/>\nget them under control (with Pixie Strike or Bravura&#39;s) if I&#39;m the crowd<br/>\ncontroller, or waiting until the crowd is controlled so that I can go back<br/>\nto doing my job if I&#39;m not the controller.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, quite frankly, Summon Food and Summon Water are only necessary for a<br/>\nlazy bard.  I can say that because I was one.  In my earlier levels, I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t have inventory space to allow 4-5 different food types, but after 45<br/>\n(the level these effects begin to work), I can afford that space easily.  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t have to sell every rusty and bronze long sword I find for money.  When<br/>\nthe Forage cap was raised to 55 (from 40 -- I am a Half Elf), I began<br/>\nhitting that Forage key religiously everytime I switched to my downtime<br/>\nhotpad between fights (it&#39;s now #1 on my downtime hotpad).  I supply myself<br/>\nwith far more food than I personally consume, and I pretty much break even<br/>\non foraged water (some nights I&#39;ll end with 1-2 more than I started, some<br/>\nnights 1-2 less).  In fact, the only time I use the Summon Water on my boots<br/>\nis when someone else in my party needs it, and there aren&#39;t any druids,<br/>\nrangers, clerics, or magicians in the group.<br/>\n<br/>\nRaiel Kendan<br/>\n51 Minstrel<br/>\nKarana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
