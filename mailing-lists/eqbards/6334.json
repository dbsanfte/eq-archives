I had a<br/>\n&gt;100 agility and an AC of around 200 or so when I got my first agility<br/>\n&gt;boosting item.  Going from 100 to 102 with no attached AC bumped my AC up <br/>\n&gt;by<br/>\n&gt;9 points.  Not sure if there are bonuses at points past 101, but I would<br/>\n&gt;imagine they get spread out at that point.  I checked with a new character<br/>\n&gt;and 101 is definitely better than 100 and 110 is no different from 101.<br/>\n&gt;Could not add enough points to reach 111 so could not check that, will try<br/>\n&gt;with a halfling rogue to see if bonuses really do continue past 101, and<br/>\n&gt;will report back on Monday.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;\tKitasi the agile?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nGET WHAT YOU DESERVE!
