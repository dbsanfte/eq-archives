At level 40, a shaman can outbuff Celerity + Chant,<br/>\nusing mostly L16-24 buffs.  Doing so takes less than half his<br/>\nmana regeneration rate - he has the rest to nuke, heal, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe primary advantage I see bards having is the combination of<br/>\nabilities they can provide - healing, clarity, stat buffs,<br/>\ncrowd control, speed buffs/debuffs.  No other class covers<br/>\nsuch a wide variety.  But in terms of quantity (number of<br/>\nbuffs at once) or quality (power of the buffs, resists<br/>\nexcepted) a bard comes nowhere near the other classes.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
