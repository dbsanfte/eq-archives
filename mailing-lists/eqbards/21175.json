One of our programmers is on<br/>\nvacation and one of the other ones is about to run and hide every time I<br/>\ncome upstairs.<br/>\nUnfortunately it is not as simple as &quot;ok let me search for bard song xxx&quot;<br/>\nour code base is huge and complicated. I don&#39;t have access or authority to<br/>\nrun searches there.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur programmers have a LOT of stuff on their plate so please be paitent with<br/>\nthem.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are patching on either Wed or Thurs. After everything is finished for<br/>\nthis patch the programmers will have some more time to look at all the<br/>\nthings I&#39;ve been asking and asking and asking.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am sorry this is taking a while. No one is intentionally blowing off<br/>\nBards. Bards are the number one fix in the Testing Department, but honestly<br/>\nwe&#39;re also trying to verify new content. No I&#39;m not hiding anything, I&#39;m not<br/>\ntrying to let anyone down &#39;easy&#39; but these things don&#39;t happen overnight.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will make sure that on Friday at the _latest_ the programmer in charge of<br/>\nthis and I sit down and try to figure out the lulaby resist rates. Thursday<br/>\nduring the patch if he as time.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
