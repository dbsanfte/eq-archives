I gave him a tell and was<br/>\n&gt; offered 100pp to take him from Qeynos to Rivervale to be twinked there by<br/>\n&gt; his level 50 char :).  Of course I accepted the offer and we ran down to<br/>\n&gt; Rivervale, in the end he died once and had to take the boat back across<br/>\n&gt; the Ocean from Erudin but eventually we got there safely and I was 100pp<br/>\n&gt; richer.<br/>\n&gt; Today, as a further reward for my services the player logged on as his<br/>\n&gt; level 50 cleric and asked me to meet him at the Freeport Bank.  When I<br/>\n&gt; arrived he gave me the following for my help previously: A pair of Bronze<br/>\n&gt; Bracers, Elf Hide Gloves, Crested Spaulders.  I promptly thanked him and<br/>\n&gt; he left saying thanks.  As he was leaving a level 50 warrior in the bank<br/>\n&gt; was selling a Jagged Band for 50pp, so I telled him and purchased my new<br/>\n&gt; peice of jewelery immediately.  I then sold my old Amber ring, the 2<br/>\n&gt; bronze bracers (too heavy for their ac), and my old Rusty Spiked shoulders<br/>\n&gt; to a Bard friend of mine for 40pp.  After that I met the Cleric again and<br/>\n&gt; he needed help buying spells for his Enchanter at the Caster Guild because<br/>\n&gt; everyone was dubious to him.  I helped him there and once again thanked<br/>\n&gt; him for his earlier gifts.  So now, I am wondering   if The Crested<br/>\n&gt; Spaulders ac:11 +6sta are good for me to use, or maybe I can trade it for<br/>\n&gt; things like A pair of Golden Amber earrings, a Second Jagged band,<br/>\n&gt; Bloodstained Mantle, A runed Bone Fork etc.  I am happy with my current<br/>\n&gt; Dual Weilding of a Barbed Leather whip and Dragoon dirk, so I think that<br/>\n&gt; Armor is the way to go.<br/>\n&gt; Any help in this subject would be wonderful.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Gleeman, bard of the 18th song - Karana<br/>\n&gt; The luckiest Bard in Norrath. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
