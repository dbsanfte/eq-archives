Guild mergers are definitely in order","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-167471405\">My stuck in 54 is as much as my own activities - raiding and bad luck -<br/>\ndeaths with only a 49-54 cleric to rez me...  Guild mergers are definitely<br/>\nin order these days.  IMHO Verant has continued down the path of ignoring<br/>\nthe needs of &quot;casual&quot; players and focusing on those who &quot;Live&quot; in the game.<br/>\nClearly it&#39;s geared to &quot;Uber&quot; Guilds (gad I hate that term).  Considering<br/>\nzones like Western Wastes - you can&#39;t even consider going in there without a<br/>\nlarge group.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, before I get into a Dennis Miller type rant; I was in a guild (Order<br/>\nof Norrath) that had 13-active players - about half at my level range.  We<br/>\ndecided that it would be best to join a larger guild.  I had been very good<br/>\nfriends with the leaders and quite a few members of the Dragons of Kel&#39;Dar -<br/>\nso I proposed a &quot;merger&quot; that developed.  We had one person that didn&#39;t make<br/>\nit (an immature 13-year old who only got into the guild because of a RL<br/>\nfriend who was in our guild with good standing).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway - my new guild has had a LOT of growth lately and is now about 90<br/>\npeoples (including the 12 from my guild).  About half are under 40 - so I<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t call us &quot;Uber&quot; but at least we can consider doing stuff that would<br/>\nbe next to if not completely impossible for me to do in the past.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore importantly - my knowledge of the Dragons and their people make me feel<br/>\nconfident that other than the size - the outlook, philosophy and culture of<br/>\nthe two guilds are very similar and it should be a good fit.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t recall knowing people from the League of Gallantry; but I have run<br/>\nacross a good amount of Dragons Claw people - and know it to be a good<br/>\nGuild - good luck on your merger.<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Robert(Bob) Smith [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rws1111@...\">rws1111@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, April 25, 2001 9:06 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Re: Xegony Daily<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nApologies to the nonXegony bards.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was away yesterday, and missed this discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Slyde - I did kinda change guilds. Excalibur is a great guild,<br/>\n&gt; but just never able to field enough folks of a similiar level<br/>\n&gt; to go do anything.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think guild size is hitting a few of us. Dragon&#39;s Claw has always<br/>\nbeen &quot;almost there&quot;, but we have always had to pull in a few friends<br/>\nfor the larger kills -- VS, Char Royalty, etc... We were lucky enough<br/>\nto find another guild -- League of Gallantry -- who share DC&#39;s goals<br/>\nand vision, and who were looking to become a bit larger. Tonight is<br/>\nthe official merger of the two guilds.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Darkfox - We were actually after the Procurator for a key to<br/>\n&gt; South and hopefully a bard mask.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I must have missed this... what Bard mask?<br/>\n<br/>\nBrilinnia: Grats on the BP!<br/>\nSlyde: 54 is bad, but I am sure you will be 55 soon enough.<br/>\nDarkfox: Good to actually spend a few minutes talking to you face-to-<br/>\nface over the weekend. I think that is the first time I have ever<br/>\ntalked to you when I could see you. *Grins*<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the silly Wizard porting your group on accident, our last trip<br/>\ninto HS was also interrupted by a wizard hitting the wrong spell and<br/>\nporting his group out. Although the worst miscast spell I have<br/>\nwitnessed in there was about two weeks ago -- a druid friend and I<br/>\nthought we would get some exp and go solo the entrance to HS (we<br/>\nhave &quot;broken&quot; it before waiting for others to arrive.) Anway, she<br/>\ngets HTed by a new spawn and goes to heal herself... the next thing I<br/>\nknow she is dead! Seems she accidentially DDed herself (talk about a<br/>\nbad time not to resist. *Smiles*) So... there I am, stuck with two<br/>\nMOBs and no help. All I can say is thank Erollisi for SoT and Thurg<br/>\ngate potions. *Grins*<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
