Ok, it is but compared to what I hear about the pen &<br/>\npaper games - where play was such that each swing by each player was a die<br/>\nroll - and all the chatter and such between turns - yikes it musta took<br/>\nforever to play.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow enter the &quot;Quake&quot; generation - we want action, we want it fast, and we<br/>\nwant lots of it!!!  We want Unrest on Steroids!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nAdd 50,000 players, mix together - shake well and opps!  Things turning out<br/>\na bit differently than we planned .... hmmmmm what can we nerf to &quot;fix&quot;<br/>\nthings and stop the powerful gamers from getting lev 50 in 40 days played<br/>\ntime....this can&#39;t be - not good for RP.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that is not the answer - Verant - wake up and make the high level world<br/>\nDynamic!  Keep track of the monsters and make them get harder and meaner or<br/>\nhave better AI depending on how well the last fights were.  If Thulaak, etal<br/>\nslays a dragon - make the next one have better guards - or spawn in<br/>\ndifferent place with badder stuffs - Make the Planes be dynamic environments<br/>\n- that have dynamic AI for battling these lev 50&#39;s.  And if you can do this<br/>\nin code - you wont have to spend so much resources  coding and arting new<br/>\nzones - make the ones you got dynamic.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\tSteven S.
