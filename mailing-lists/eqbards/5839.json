Apparently","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1777594199\">This &quot;feature&quot; was something I was unaware of until just a few days ago.  I<br/>\nthink it also helps to explain the high frequency of trains in Unrest.<br/>\nApparently some of the rooms are linked to one another.  Like the previous<br/>\nposter said, the tower is linked to the barroom.  If you are in the barroom<br/>\nand no one is in the tower, the mobs in the tower will come down to the<br/>\nbarroom when they spawn.  I believe the barroom is linked to the magi room.<br/>\nI was camping the magi room last Saturday and to our surprise in walked a<br/>\nnoble.  What was even a bigger surprise is that one of the partymembers got<br/>\na BS tunic off of him.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA word of caution when camping a room in Unrest.  Using an area of effect<br/>\nsong like Disruptive Discord or Chords of Dissonance is not a good idea due<br/>\nto the z-axis bug.  When you are camping the magi room, you will see<br/>\nmessages all the time stating the mortuary fungus begins to cast a spell.<br/>\nYou will also get hit with the Mort Drowsy spell from time to time.  In the<br/>\nhand room, you will sometimes get the same message except this time its a<br/>\nfestering hag casting the spell.  The mort fungus is in the basement and the<br/>\nhag is in the tower.  If you sing the AE songs, you will likely draw their<br/>\nattention to you.  Lullaby and Largos&#39;s Binding are safe AE songs that you<br/>\ncan sing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; The safety of camping the house is all dependant on the on the number of<br/>\n&gt; people who can hold rooms.  Never hold the bar room without some group in<br/>\n&gt; the tower and watch out for trains if those two rooms aren&#39;t camped.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
