At 36th a full bubble is equal to about a 1/4<br/>\nbubble at 35th.  I know that its silly, but its what everyone seems to<br/>\nobserve.  My druid friend died at 30th 3 times, losing a quarter bub or less<br/>\neach time.  1 death at 29 was 3/4 and both deaths at 31 were nearly a full<br/>\nbubble as well.  same thing happened at 34-36th though 35th took about 3<br/>\ntimes the number of kills of similar creatures to advance than 36th did.

I&#39;ve always been<br/>\ntold that 31 and above was hell level because this is where you started<br/>\nloosing a full bubble with a death instead of a half bubble.  I&#39;m now 35 and<br/>\nI died 7 times this past weekend (yeah, REAL bad weekend for me), never once<br/>\nloosing more then a quarter bubble (I came out of the weekend with almost<br/>\none bubble into 35 which is slightly less then where I started).  Some of my<br/>\ndeaths were to high blues and most were to red (the ones in lower Guk). When<br/>\nI was 32, I distinctly recall loosing about 3/4 of a bubble on a bad pull.<br/>\nI usually don&#39;t pay that much attention to my XP bar unless I&#39;ve just died<br/>\nor am about to level (which was the case at 32) so I don&#39;t know how much I<br/>\nlost with my deaths at levels 33 and 34.  The other possibility is that they<br/>\nhave changed the amount of XP loss from a death on one of the recent<br/>\npatches?<br/>\n<br/>\nOn another note, does anyone have any advice for pulling in MM or a good<br/>\nplace to camp?  I was wiped 3 times there last night alone from really bad<br/>\nugly looking trains that seemed to include the WHOLE castle, all of them<br/>\ncoming out through the graveyard (which I had imagined would be safer).<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, Prexus has officially grown up I think.  1700 people on it last night<br/>\nand I couldn&#39;t find anywhere to hunt in Sol B or in Lower Guk (EVERYTHING<br/>\nwas camped)... But when I got to MM, there were only about 12 people in the<br/>\nzone... now I know why.<br/>\n<br/>\nTaneran Dreamweaver<br/>\n&lt;Clan Jax&gt;<br/>\nBard of the 35th song<br/>\nPrexus<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, January 03, 2000 1:27 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Question about experience penalty (OT)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I made 30th level over the holidays and since then have died twice.  The<br/>\n&gt; first time I died was in the assasin room in lower guk.  I got killed by<br/>\nan<br/>\n&gt; one of the undead ghoul wizards (conned red to me). I noticed that the<br/>\n&gt; amount of experience on the bar didn&#39;t visually drop very much.  Second<br/>\ntime<br/>\n&gt; I died I was in Mistmoore.  Party was fighting in the secret room behind<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; crypt when we got a bad pull.  Deathly harbingers and ushers beat me up<br/>\n&gt; pretty good.  Started running to the zone when a pledge familiar (caster<br/>\n&gt; type) joined in the fight.  Pledge familiars con either low blue or green<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; me.  Even though the deathly harbingers and ushers did 90% of the damage<br/>\n&gt; against me, the pledge familiar got in the killing blow.  I noticed that<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; experience bar visually dropped a lot more this death than it did when the<br/>\n&gt; red ghoul wizards killed me.  I have noticed a similar trend over the life<br/>\n&gt; of my bard as well.  Just paid more attention it to it now that I&#39;m in a<br/>\n&gt; hell level.  Subjectively, it appears to me that the experience penalty<br/>\nfor<br/>\n&gt; dying is higher when something kills you that cons green/blue to you<br/>\nversus<br/>\n&gt; something killing you that cons yellow/red.  Anyone else had similar<br/>\n&gt; results?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; 30 bard<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
