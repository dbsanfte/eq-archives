And then did it in Fear the<br/>\n&gt; other night to help choose pulls)<br/>\n  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>  It&#39;s nice for looking around, in Fear the monsters tend to pull you<br/>\n  and not vice versa ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Chains when snare won&#39;t hold for one reason or another. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  I&#39;ll chain once in a while, usually too high magic resistance<br/>\n  on the planes to do this (even with debuffs) - depends on the mob.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; She doesn&#39;t seem to think her songs are worthless at all. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  I never said our songs are worthless, I said other than 3 or<br/>\n  4, they are all outlived or underpowered.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;ve even seen her sit down between battles and mem new songs! <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  Ouch... she must not know what she&#39;s doing then.  I never need<br/>\n  to remem any songs once my lineup is set.  You don&#39;t even have<br/>\n  8 songs you could apply to any given Planes scenario anyway, heh.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And, when it comes to fighting, she is in their swinging with the rest.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  Swinging and missing, unlike the rest.  It&#39;s not that our dual wield<br/>\n  sucks, or that our weapons blow, or even our offense, I swing a whole<br/>\n  lot, more than all the other tanks, I just miss all the time.  Or I<br/>\n  get riposted or parried.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have never heard her complain about being a level 50 bard.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  Well, some people are content with being mediocre, I&#39;m not.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Bards are EAGERLY desired by Phoenix on the planes, to the point they<br/>\n&gt; are encouraged to come even to Fear where no bard armor drops until<br/>\n&gt; they are sick of it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  Yeah, bards are encouraged to come when people want their fix, and <br/>\n  when it&#39;s time to do Draco, otherwise we are pretty much tagalongs.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Did you know a level 7 bard can take out yellow giant wasps solo?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  Did you know a level 50 bard cannot solo a L34 npc guard? ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Things change completely at higher levels, tactics are almost <br/>\n  meaningless.  HP/AC/Dmg output are everything.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
