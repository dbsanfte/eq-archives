Well, I grouped with a Shadow Knight friend who was 3<br/>\nlevels above me, and attacked things that conned yellow and red for<br/>\nme (white and yellow for her).  Nice xp, even given the uneven<br/>\ndistribution, but quite dangerous.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if you ever find yourself with a group that does not play the<br/>\nway you want to, then leave.

And remember, any mobs that you, as a group,<br/>\nattack are going to be annoyed at YOU, for singing heal, or anthem,<br/>\nor dissonance (if you are daring).
