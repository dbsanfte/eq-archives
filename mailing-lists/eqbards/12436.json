NOOO!

Most of our songs <br/>\neither affect just party members or affect all non party members. Even <br/>\nthough Charm is a single target song, I&#39;d suspect that this would be the <br/>\nproblem.<br/>\n<br/>\nI say this because I used charm in a duel against a warrior just a week or <br/>\nso ago.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, just for general usefulness, not being grouped with the person you are <br/>\ndueling is a good idea even if that isn&#39;t the fix to your problem. That way <br/>\nyou only buff yourself.  Also, the AE songs we have won&#39;t affect those in <br/>\nyour group even if you are in duel mode or in the arena. I learned this in <br/>\nmy first duel when I was trying to test Disruptive Dischord many moons ago.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnthem Dirgemaker<br/>\nLevel 47 Bard of Qeynos<br/>\nSolusek Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
