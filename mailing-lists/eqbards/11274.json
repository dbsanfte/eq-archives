Is there a secret way (i.e. through the secret room <br/>\n&gt;in the graveyard) which could be less hazardous to a group of around 30&#39;s? <br/>\n&gt;(I too share Shada&#39;s propensity for being lost - hehe.  My train hotkey <br/>\n&gt;shouts &quot;TRAIN TO......UM......Just watch out!&quot;)  Once I get to said room, <br/>\n&gt;how difficult a place is it?  3 spawns, 4?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve gone in via the front door with a group then past the 2 gargoyles (not <br/>\nup the stairs).  There is a room with a muscian pit where the gypsies spawn. <br/>\n  At night they spawn as werewolves.  Not sure what the best way to break <br/>\nthe room is though, sorry.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;2)  Where are Choon and Froon (I&#39;ve spent the vast majority of my time on <br/>\n&gt;the East coast, so I&#39;m not too familiar with the Karanas)?  About what <br/>\n&gt;level are they?  Is it possible to pull one with out the other?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>if you are 27+ just use Charm to have them kill each other. They are located <br/>\non the western hills in west karana, near the Orge camp.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;And in another non-related vein:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Can anyone please post or supply the web address to a comprehensive list of <br/>\n&gt;Bard skill caps?
