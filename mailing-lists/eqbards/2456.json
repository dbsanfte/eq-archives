He got a message to me and I remembered the<br/>\nadvice I&#39;d heard hear about swimming for an island with a dock.  He<br/>\npreferred to pray to the bitwise gods, but none seeemed to be listening.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we hatched a plan.  I would take the boat on the same path he did,<br/>\nreporting to him where it was.  I told him the boarding technique I learned<br/>\nso recently in this scrying pool, swim for the boat as if you&#39;re going to<br/>\nclimb its prow, and find yourself in the hold by the bar.  I called out the<br/>\nlandmarks as they passed, in detail as we entered, sailed through, and<br/>\nbeyond the aqua goblin rocks.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I heard my friend&#39;s exultant shout!  He was aboard.  A rescue at sea.<br/>\nAnd we owe it all to what I learned here from my fellow bards.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy deepest gratitude for your help in rescuing my friend.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThrush<br/>\n<br/>\nWe weren&#39;t even tempted to use /loc.  And now we have an in-game story of<br/>\nfear, frustration, anticipation, and rescue, even though it was caused by a<br/>\nstupid software bug.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBob</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
