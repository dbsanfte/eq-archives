This means that often there will be<br/>\n&gt; several<br/>\n&gt; &gt;things left in the zone that are still very aggressive and dangerous.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think they have this fixed as of the last patch.  I was in Kith last<br/>\n&gt; nite<br/>\n&gt; (Real time) and was targeting an Enraged Dread Wolf to /con it for just<br/>\n&gt; this<br/>\n&gt; reason.  While I had it targeted it despawned.  This was at 6AM KFT<br/>\n&gt; (Kithicor Forest Time).  I ran all over the zone to see if there was<br/>\n&gt; anything dangerous running around.  I did get jumped by a ghoul and nearly<br/>\n&gt; had heart failure when it rooted me.  Fortunately it was one of the<br/>\n&gt; ordinary<br/>\n&gt; ghouls that have always spawned near burned out houses in Kithicor.  I did<br/>\n&gt; not run into anything during the day that wasn&#39;t around before this<br/>\n&gt; change.<br/>\n&gt; Of course I don&#39;t have track yet so that info isn&#39;t 100% for sure but I<br/>\n&gt; did<br/>\n&gt; stay in Kithicor ranging about until 6pm KFT so I covered a lot of ground.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tKitasi<br/>\n&gt; \tStill Somewhere in Kithicor<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a><br/>\n&gt; with the subject lol. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
