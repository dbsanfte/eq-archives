While we were there, we met someone who said he&#39;s<br/>\nshow us where this particular creature spawned (mage was wanting to complete<br/>\na part of her quest and it had an item she needed). Anyway, this person was<br/>\nKOS to most things inside as he&#39;d been hunting in there for a while. One of<br/>\nour druids was going to cast invis/see invis on him (and see invis on the<br/>\nrest of us) when he&#39;s attacked by something, and one of our druids casts see<br/>\ninvis on him exactly the same time. Then the creatures started attacking us!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo: Did they attack us because one of the druids cast see invis on him while<br/>\nhe was defending himself??? Our 21mage stayed back and didn&#39;t do anything<br/>\nwhile we helped our &quot;guide&quot; defend himself but the 29druid, and myself DID<br/>\nhelp (actually, I had to defend myself, because, when they turned to attack,<br/>\nthey attacked me and the 29druid). The 26 druid also helped by joining in<br/>\nthe fight, yet her faction didn&#39;t seem to be affected (i.e. she can stand in<br/>\nthere uninvised and not be attacked). And, the mage&#39;s faction took no hits<br/>\nwhatsoever. Anyway, anyone have any ideas what was going on with this? Oddly<br/>\nenough, when I am standing there, they are just dubious to me, and when I<br/>\nsing the invis song, they are indifferent to me, so it seems my faction<br/>\nwasn&#39;t adjusted THAT much.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
