I&#39;ve always thought that your faction (how far<br/>\ninto &quot;ready to attack&quot; you are) affected the aggro radius and<br/>\nrate.  I was pulling for a L30s group in Sol A a couple nights<br/>\nago.  The young goblins completely ignored me.  The Inferno<br/>\nand Solusek goblins would aggro on me after a few seconds, but<br/>\nI was able to pull singles from a room with 3 Sols without<br/>\nhaving to lull.  Fire goblins took about 5 seconds before<br/>\nthey&#39;d aggro on me.  This was at level 45.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re saying these things all attack you the moment they see<br/>\nyou?<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
