No cold hard facts, but I did do some tests one night<br/>\nwhen we were bored. Loaded up my packs with different armors and we hit<br/>\nlower guk. We choose the Crusader as our guinea pig. For those that don&#39;t<br/>\nknow, he hits a lot for 120s. First, I loaded on the banded. 120s were<br/>\ncommon place, and average hits were around 80 to 90 a pop. Shredded in short<br/>\norder. Next loaded up a set of Bronze. Still a lot of 120s, but average hit<br/>\nseemed around 60 to 70. Next I loaded up full crafted. Very few 120s,<br/>\naverage hits were in the 40s to 50s.<br/>\nThe one thing to keep in mind though is when you are loading up the heavier<br/>\narmors, is that you are going to be sacraficing on some of the stat raising<br/>\nequipment. When you get to the higher levels with your bard though, the<br/>\nbetter armors with stat increases on them become available.<br/>\nOn my bard I have the following main pieces:<br/>\nMithral Breastplate<br/>\nSilvery Legs<br/>\nSkull Shaped Barbute<br/>\nBlack Charred Boots<br/>\nAzure Sleeves<br/>\n2 serp bracers<br/>\nelf hide gloves<br/>\nhost of jewelry.<br/>\nWith this setup and my jewelry, I have an agi of 170, and a dex of 160.<br/>\nDunno if I really need those high of numbers, but I like high numbers =)   I<br/>\nam able to dodge msot attacks, and when I do resort to using weapons (I<br/>\nprefer using instruments), I hit a lot and proc like a demon.<br/>\nWhile you may not see the numbers on your ac change very much with equipping<br/>\nthe next level of armor available to you, the difference will be noticed in<br/>\nhow much damage you take. And as we all know, verants uber mobs can deal out<br/>\nmax damage a lot, so its always in ones best interest to keep that minimized<br/>\nas much as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nKragan Tundrafury<br/>\nMith Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;This was a topic a long time ago when we were debating if bards should wear<br/>\n&gt;plate.  The theory is that stronger/thicker armor types may deflect a<br/>\n&gt;portion of the blow.  For example, the random generator decides you will<br/>\n&gt;take 50 points of damage from a hit.  The results would be something like<br/>\n&gt;this:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Type Damage<br/>\n&gt;No armor 50<br/>\n&gt;Leather 45<br/>\n&gt;Banded 40<br/>\n&gt;Bronze 35<br/>\n&gt;Steel 30<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I just made these up as an example.  Another theory is that the type of<br/>\n&gt;armor has no impact whatsoever.  In this case, the only thing that is<br/>\n&gt;important is your AC.  A higher AC would mean a less chance of getting hit.<br/>\n&gt;If you do get hit, using the previous example, you would take 50 damage<br/>\n </span></blockquote>even<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;if you were wearing steel plate.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I have no idea what the correct answer is but since I have enough STR to<br/>\n&gt;wear full bronze, its a moot point for me.  I would like to get<br/>\n </span></blockquote>confirmation<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;but doubt it will ever happen.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
