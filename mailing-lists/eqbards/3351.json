THIS IS NOT AN EXPLOIT, THIS<br/>\n&gt; IS A DESIGN FEATURE.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Mr. Schafer, you are quite possibly doing yourself a great disservice by not<br/>\n&gt; cycling songs at your level.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Cycling Hymn is rather pointless at that level range, but there are so many<br/>\n&gt; more options for you, and they continue to grow.  As I stated in a post last<br/>\n&gt; week, a bard that doesn&#39;t cycle is like a warrior who refuses to wear plate<br/>\n&gt; and use 2h weapons, or a wizard that refuses to memorize spells, a ranger<br/>\n&gt; that doesn&#39;t track, a paladin that doesn&#39;t lay hands, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thanks for the clarification J.M. Seeing as this is the case, do you know<br/>\nif there&#39;s any hope from Verant to make it less of a constant twitch<br/>\nmotion? For example, by making it so you can have an instrument slot (like<br/>\na ranged slot), where you switch between weapons and instrument without<br/>\npopping things between slots? Of course, you&#39;d still have to do some<br/>\ninventory switching to change weapons.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nJesse &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:j@...\">j@...</a>&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
