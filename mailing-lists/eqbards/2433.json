A shield weighs roughly<br/>\n&gt; 10 lbs for the small races, +2.5(dirk)-10(screaming mace) lbs for your<br/>\n&gt; weapon. Presently I dual wield a combine long (7.5) and a dirk (2.5) for a<br/>\n&gt; total of 10#. When you add in the weight of bronze plate, even for a small<br/>\n&gt; race it adds up fast. With 3 backpacks, instruments, 10 food/water, full<br/>\n&gt; bronze armor (minus the hideous helm for wood elves), and my weapons, I<br/>\n&gt; weigh in at roughly 75#. So going INTO the dungeon I weigh that much. Thank<br/>\n&gt; goodness for strength items and spells. since being overweight has an affect<br/>\n&gt; on your agility (movement speed slows, greater percentage chance of being<br/>\n&gt; stunned) you definitely want to watch your weight if you will be<br/>\n&gt; fetching/pulling for your group.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ariell Thunderwolf, Karana<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Books, music, videos, gifts, e-cards, auctions-find them at AMAZON.COM.<br/>\n&gt; Browse Earth&#39;s Biggest Selection!
