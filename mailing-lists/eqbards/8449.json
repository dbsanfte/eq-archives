This list will be posted","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-788089772\">Greetings and Welcome to the EQ Bards Mailing List, a mailing list <br/>\ndedicated to all for and about the Bard in EverQuest.<br/>\nThis list will be posted semi-regularly, and updated as often as is needed. <br/>\nIf you have any suggestions, or any frequently asked questions, please let <br/>\nme know.<br/>\n<br/>\n                  First, some basic rules:<br/>\n                  (Common sense stuff, really)<br/>\n<br/>\n                  1) Stay on Topic (as much as possible).  While we do <br/>\noften stray off the<br/>\n                  path of Bard-related stuff, lets try and keep the <br/>\nmaterial &quot;of-interest&quot; to<br/>\n                  our readers.  Ex: Discussions of DoT nerfing are <br/>\nacceptable, because Bards<br/>\n                  have DoTs.  Discussions of Rogue Poison recipes are <br/>\nnot.  Discussions of<br/>\n                  Quests and items are okay, as long as you make an attempt <br/>\nnot to spoil<br/>\n                  someone else&#39;s fun. Use [Spoiler] in the heading, or put <br/>\nspoiler space<br/>\n                  (several blank lines) to let people know in advance.<br/>\n                    Deliberate spam will NOT be tolerated, and any person <br/>\ndoing so will be<br/>\n                  immediately reviewed for warning, removal or banning.<br/>\n                    On a related note, if you notice that your topic is <br/>\nstraying from the<br/>\n                  original thread, please change the subject <br/>\nheader.  Example: RE: Mistmoore<br/>\n                  Battle Drums becomes:<br/>\n                  re: Fighting undead as a Bard (was RE: Mistmoore Battle <br/>\nDrums)<br/>\n                  For those of you receiving the digest version, if you can <br/>\nmake an attempt<br/>\n                  to change the subject field to something appropriate, <br/>\nthat would help those<br/>\n                  of us not digesting our mail better pass it ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n                  2) No Flaming.  Not all of us share the same opinion as <br/>\nyou do, but please<br/>\n                  be considerate of one another.  Take a moment to read <br/>\nthrough, and then<br/>\n                  make sure someone hasn&#39;t already responded before posting <br/>\nhastily.  We&#39;re<br/>\n                  all human, and no one likes to be called names.  If you <br/>\nsimply MUST insult,<br/>\n                  badger or degrade someone, DO IT PRIVATELY.<br/>\n<br/>\n                  3) There is no Rule Number 3.<br/>\n<br/>\n                  4) Watch for &quot;KABONG!&quot;s.  KABONG! is an old list-term for <br/>\na thread that is<br/>\n                  being forcibly killed.  This sometimes happens when a <br/>\nthread has<br/>\n                  degenerated sufficiently off-topic to no longer be valid <br/>\nfor this list, or<br/>\n                  when the subject matter has become too inflammatory to be <br/>\ndiscussed.<br/>\n                  Kabongs generally only occur in extreme situations.<br/>\n<br/>\n                  5) No Attached Files!  If you wish to share with us your <br/>\nlatest picture,<br/>\n                  some nifty article or the Happy99 worm, please simply <br/>\ninclude a link within<br/>\n                  your email to an appropriate place online.  If you have <br/>\nno access to such,<br/>\n                  email the file to me, (except viruses ;) and I will post <br/>\nit for you, and<br/>\n                  follow up to the list with the URL.  Small infractions <br/>\nwill probably be<br/>\n                  overlooked, but let&#39;s try to be considerate of our <br/>\nEuropean readers who<br/>\n                  have to pay by the minute to download their mail.<br/>\n<br/>\n                  6) Be Considerate of Others! Please keep &quot;me, too!&quot; posts <br/>\nto a minimum, and<br/>\n                  try not to quote more of the message than necessary <br/>\n(although you should<br/>\n                  always make sure that the message you are sending is <br/>\nproperly referenced,<br/>\n                  so that people reading the messages out of order are not <br/>\ncompletely lost.<br/>\n                  And try not to abbreviate too much, or use strange &quot;slang&quot; or<br/>\n                  incomprehensible euphemisms.  Plain, clear speech is much <br/>\nmore effective,<br/>\n                  and will cause fewer &quot;WTF?!&quot; messages...  Also, use <br/>\nspoiler headings and/or<br/>\n                  spoiler spaces when presenting Quest hints or weapon details.<br/>\n<br/>\n                  Okay, enough rules.  Now for some Frequently Asked Questions!<br/>\n<br/>\n                  Q: I keep seeing all these abbreviations: &quot;DoT&quot;, &quot;DD&quot;, <br/>\n&quot;PGT&quot;, &quot;FBR&quot; - What<br/>\n                  do they all mean?!<br/>\n                  A: Well, the best way to learn is to check out the <br/>\nEverQuest Glossary at<br/>\n                  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/bards/eqglossary.htm\">http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/bards/eqglossary.htm</a> <br/>\n(shameless plug).  Briefly,<br/>\n                  those four terms mean &quot;Damage over Time&quot; (refers to <br/>\nspells/effects that do<br/>\n                  damage every few seconds for a while, instead of all at <br/>\nonce), &quot;Direct<br/>\n                  Damage&quot; (refers to spells/effects that do all their <br/>\ndamage at once),<br/>\n                  &quot;Polished Granite Tomahawk&quot; a nice weapon, and &quot;Flowing <br/>\nBlack Robes&quot;<br/>\n                  something casters love.<br/>\n<br/>\n                  Q: What song do I get at &lt;foo&gt; level?  What does this <br/>\nsong do?<br/>\n                  A: Well, again, shameless plug time: The EverQuest Bard&#39;s <br/>\nGuild<br/>\n                  (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/bards/eqbard.htm)\">http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/bards/eqbard.htm)</a> has a list <br/>\nof spellsongs,<br/>\n                  however, most people seem to prefer detailed statistics, <br/>\nso let me refer<br/>\n                  you to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.attcanada.net/~reaper/\">http://www.attcanada.net/~reaper/</a> - The Concert <br/>\nHall.  Also,<br/>\n                  the Soerbaird is a wonderful site: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.soerbaird.com/\">http://www.soerbaird.com/</a><br/>\n                  (Anyone want to suggest any other sites?)<br/>\n<br/>\n                  Q: What do instruments do?<br/>\n                  A: Some songs have associated instruments.  Playing this <br/>\ninstrument will<br/>\n                  generally enhance the song by as much as 50%, but this is <br/>\nalso related to<br/>\n                  your relative skill with the instrument.  Also, <br/>\ninstrument skill is<br/>\n                  partially responsible for failure rate of related <br/>\nsongs.  To avoid<br/>\n                  &quot;fizzling&quot; (missing notes) even when singing, keep your <br/>\ninstrument skills<br/>\n                  maxed out.<br/>\n<br/>\n                  Q: Are there any magical or &quot;Unique&quot; instruments for Bards?<br/>\n                  A: Yes, there are several known &quot;special&quot; instruments in <br/>\nthe world.<br/>\n                       The Mistmoore Battle Drum (found in Mistmoore), <br/>\nwhich increases the<br/>\n                  effects of most drummed songs by 20%<br/>\n                       The Lute of the Gypsy Princess (also found in <br/>\nMistmoore) which has no<br/>\n                  discernible special effect.<br/>\n                       Brahm&#39;s Horn (found in the Gorge of King Grobb) <br/>\nwhich has no known<br/>\n                  discernible effect.<br/>\n                       Drums of Selo&#39;s March (Found on Cazic Thule?) which <br/>\nincreases the<br/>\n                  effects of most drummed songs by 30%.<br/>\n                       McVaxius&#39; Horn of War (unknown) which adds +9 INT, <br/>\n+9 DEX, +15 CHA and<br/>\n                  increases Brass song effects by 15%.<br/>\n                       Minotaur Horns found on minotaurs in Steamfont and <br/>\nthe Gorge of King<br/>\n                  Grobb are wind instruments with no known special <br/>\neffect.  They are,<br/>\n                  however, lighter than flutes, and don&#39;t cause that awful <br/>\nanimation.<br/>\n                       The Lizard Scout Fifes are rumoured to be <br/>\nnon-magical wind<br/>\n                  instruments, but this still remains to be proven.<br/>\n                       The Unicorn Horn (found in Lesser Faydark), acts as <br/>\na Greater<br/>\n                  Lightstone while held, as well as a wind <br/>\ninstrument.  Other than that, it<br/>\n                  has no discernible special effect.<br/>\n<br/>\n                  Q: What&#39;s the difference between a Lute and a Mandolin?<br/>\n                  A: Weight and cost.  Mandolins are lighter, but a little <br/>\nmore expensive.<br/>\n<br/>\n                  Q: When I get Dual Wield, will I be able to play an <br/>\ninstrument while<br/>\n                  swinging a sword?<br/>\n                  A: Unfortunately, no.  While instruments are off-hand <br/>\nonly items, they are<br/>\n                  also considered two-handed.  Besides, it&#39;s ever-so-much <br/>\nmore fun to bash<br/>\n                  monsters with your lute, dontcha think? (Sylly! WEP!)<br/>\n<br/>\n                  Q: What&#39;s the best weapon/armour/equipment for &lt;foo&gt; <br/>\nlevel?  Where should I<br/>\n                  hunt at this level?<br/>\n                  A: Okay - time to ask the list ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n                  Q: What are &quot;Hotkeys&quot; and how do I create them?<br/>\n                  A: You&#39;ll notice that in the lower left side of the <br/>\nscreen you have 6 empty<br/>\n                  boxes with the number &quot;1&quot; and two arrows above it.  This <br/>\nis the &quot;hotkey&quot;<br/>\n                  box.  Initially, hotkeys default to the numbers 1-6 on <br/>\nyour keyboard, but<br/>\n                  you can reconfigure that through the options <br/>\nsettings.  Songs, spells, the<br/>\n                  spellbook, socials, and inventory boxes can all be made <br/>\n&quot;hotkeys&quot;. To<br/>\n                  create a &quot;hotkey&quot;, LEFT click on the box/spell/icon you <br/>\nwant and HOLD it<br/>\n                  down.  After a second, the box will magically &quot;lift up&quot; <br/>\nand attach itself<br/>\n                  to your pointer.  Simply &quot;drop&quot; the new box onto the <br/>\nappropriate hotkey<br/>\n                  slot, and blammo! Instant hotkey.  Now, whenever you <br/>\npress the associated<br/>\n                  hotkey button, you will activate the song/spell or action <br/>\nin that slot.<br/>\n                  Inventory boxes do NOT &quot;activate&quot;, putting them in your <br/>\nhotkey bank is<br/>\n                  simply to avoid having to open your inventory to swap <br/>\nitems in combat.<br/>\n<br/>\n                  Q: Why would I want to swap items in combat?!<br/>\n                  A: Well, not just in combat, but by placing inventory <br/>\nslots (General<br/>\n                  inventory slots, or worn/wielded slots will work.  Bag <br/>\nslots will NOT) into<br/>\n                  your hotkey bank, you can grab (for example) your sword <br/>\nand swap it with an<br/>\n                  instrument in order to heal faster, run faster or <br/>\nwhatever.  PRACTICE THIS<br/>\n                  MANEUVER.  You *WILL* drop your weapon or instrument at <br/>\nleast once, and<br/>\n                  more likely several times, so practice practice <br/>\npractice!  And if you *do*<br/>\n                  accidentally drop something, don&#39;t panic, just back up, <br/>\ngrab the item and<br/>\n                  run like crazy.<br/>\n<br/>\n                  Q: Why can&#39;t Bards do &lt;foo&gt; as well as &lt;other really buff <br/>\nclass&gt;?<br/>\n                  A: Well, simply put, we&#39;re the &quot;Jack of all Trades, <br/>\nMaster of None.&quot; This<br/>\n                  means that, while we can do so many different things <br/>\n(sneak, dual wield,<br/>\n                  pick locks, safe fall, etc. etc.) we&#39;re not meant to be <br/>\nmasters in any of<br/>\n                  them, so you may notice certain skill caps (such as 40 <br/>\nfor Forage and 75<br/>\n                  for Sneak, etc.) that mean that you will never be <br/>\nincredibly good at these<br/>\n                  skills.  Be thankful that you get them at all.<br/>\n<br/>\n                  Q:  Is it true that The Jig of Vigor song increases mana <br/>\nregeneration<br/>\n                  speed for your party members?<br/>\n                  A: No.  What the Jig does is increase the rate <br/>\nof  Stamina Regeneration<br/>\n                  every six seconds and hence the display of the Stamina, <br/>\nHealth, and Mana<br/>\n                  bars to show this increase.  Without the song playing the <br/>\nbars are refreshed<br/>\n                  every eight seconds.  The ultimate effect of this is that <br/>\nthe mana bar<br/>\n                  &quot;moves&quot; every six seconds instead of every eight seconds <br/>\nso it APPEARS to be<br/>\n                  moving FASTER.  In actuality - it is moving 75% of the <br/>\ndistance it would<br/>\n                  move if it waiting the other two seconds.  So bottom <br/>\nline, it LOOKS like it<br/>\n                  is regenerating faster but it does not.  If you don&#39;t <br/>\notherwise have a need<br/>\n                  to regenerate stamina, you are wasting a memorized song slot.<br/>\n<br/>\n                  Q. Why can I never gain any experience in 2-handed slash <br/>\nor 2-handed blunt?<br/>\n                  A. Although Bards have these skills, and even though they <br/>\nappear on the<br/>\n                  trainer, you can never train 2-handed skills as a <br/>\nBard.  This is apparently<br/>\n                  a piece of virtual duct-tape to allow GMs and Guides to <br/>\nplay Bards and<br/>\n                  still wield 2-handed equipment (like their special staff).<br/>\n<br/>\n                  Q. What are the most important stats as a Bard?<br/>\n                  A. Well, because no matter what I answer, someone will <br/>\ndisagree with me, I<br/>\n                  will say this:  No matter what your starting stats, odds <br/>\nare, you will<br/>\n                  eventually be able to balance any deficiencies out with <br/>\nmagic items and<br/>\n                  jewelry.<br/>\n<br/>\n                  Okay, well, this FAQ is pretty long as it is - and I&#39;ve <br/>\nrun out of ideas.<br/>\n                  If anyone has any suggestions for the next version, <br/>\nplease feel free to<br/>\n                  send them my way.<br/>\n<br/>\n                  Talies the Wanderer<br/>\n                  Moderator</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
