But I thought","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-427695888\">I know this is a controversial issue, with many people<br/>\nstaunchly believing it doesn&#39;t make sense to play Hymn during<br/>\na fight at higher levels.  But I thought I&#39;d toss out some<br/>\nnumbers I happened to calculate during last night&#39;s play.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo paladins and I (L31, 32, 31) were wandering Guk and<br/>\nhappened across the ancient crocodile.  It /conned blue so we<br/>\ndecided to give it a shot as they both had lay hands ready.<br/>\nOne of them has ghoulbane and the other has a blackened iron<br/>\nbastard sword, so in general I do less than half the damage<br/>\none of them can do in a fight.  Hence I&#39;d mostly been playing<br/>\nwith my lute singing Hymn along with Anthem and Chain.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe croc hits hard, with a max hit of around 72 and often<br/>\ndouble-attacking.  Buffed out, the paladins had about 1000 hp<br/>\n(200 hp per bubble), I had abaout 750.  The fight lasted 27<br/>\nsong pulses, and ended with one paladin down to 2 bubbles, the<br/>\nother down below 1 (he stepped back to heal himself near the<br/>\nend), for a net deficit of 1400-1500 hp.  (They are both very<br/>\ngood at using taunt and stopping attacks to evenly distribute<br/>\nthe damage they&#39;re taking.)<br/>\n<br/>\nHymn at my level with a lute heals 13 points per tick.  In 27<br/>\npulses with both paladins wounded, it healed roughly 702<br/>\npoints, for a total deficit of 2100-2200 hp.  That is, even in<br/>\na fight against an opponent who often double-hit for 60-70,<br/>\nand with just two people wounded, Hymn with a lute was able to<br/>\n&quot;reduce&quot; the damage taken during the fight by roughly 30%.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I&#39;d equipped my weapons and joined in the fighting, I<br/>\nwould&#39;ve boosted our damage rate by about 20% (assuming I do<br/>\nhalf the damage of either of them).  That would&#39;ve resulted in<br/>\nthe croc dying 20% faster, and us taking ~430 points less<br/>\ndamage.  Hymn without a lute heals 7 points a tick, so over 22<br/>\nrounds it would&#39;ve healed 308 points.  Add these to get 738<br/>\npoints.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we probably would&#39;ve done slightly better with me using my<br/>\nweapons instead of singing Hymn.  But remember that this is<br/>\nwith just two people wounded.  If the group had been bigger,<br/>\nthe benefit of using Hymn with a lute would&#39;ve been greater,<br/>\nwhile the impact of me using my weapons would&#39;ve been smaller.<br/>\nSo it *can* make sense to use Hymn with a lute during a fight<br/>\nat this level.  Most of the monsters we were fighting weren&#39;t<br/>\ndoing as much damage as the croc, and I was primarily using<br/>\nHymn to keep as close as possible to max hp in case things got<br/>\nugly and we had to run for the zone.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
