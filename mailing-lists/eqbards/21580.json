I later confirmed that everytime I played niv&#39;s with that lute... I flung my arms out.  I will test it with other strings, but another bard got the correct graphic when using his 7-string...<br/>\n<br/>\n  Has this been around for awhile or what?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Kerouac Dharmabum<br/>\n  lvl 50<br/>\n  Rodcent Nife<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
