I think most<br/>\nwill agree that te whole fantasy idea of Halflings spawned from the Hobbits<br/>\nof Middle-Earth, and what was it that Mr. Tolkien did every 6 pages in The<br/>\nHobbit?  He had Bilbo singing a song (ok so that&#39;s an exaggeration :) , but<br/>\nBilbo sure liked music (also shown in Lord of the Ring trilogy))  Oh, and<br/>\nabout Halflings being in tune with nature and whatnot... well, Hobbits<br/>\ncertainly didn&#39;t seem to like leaving their holes much.  Then of course,<br/>\nHalflings were altered and reaccepted as a mischievous race, which is why<br/>\nthe Halfling Rogue is so popular, and this happened primarily because of TSR<br/>\nif you ask me (as there aren&#39;t many other vastly influencial people or<br/>\nthings such as TSR and Tolkien).  And because I see no evidence of the<br/>\ndefinition of the Halfling race in EQ it&#39;s safe to assume they are either<br/>\nMiddle-Earth-style or TSR-style, or a mix of both, in which case they are<br/>\nfully suited to the bardic class :) (after all, rogues and bards are always<br/>\ngrouped together... perhaps Halfling bards are simply very rogue-like in<br/>\ntheir nature :)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Qefnir, lax bard of Tarew Marr working on his 15th composition</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
