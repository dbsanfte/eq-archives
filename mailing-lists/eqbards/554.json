When I hit level 4 and got the spell someone needed help<br/>\nright away.  I helped him and got 3PP.  That was a fortune at level 3.  A<br/>\nfew levels later while fighting in West Karana I heard someone cry out for<br/>\nhelp.  I had to run to the zone with Croon and Froon chasing me but he got<br/>\nhis corpse.  After we met back up I got about 29 PP worth of stuff from him.<br/>\nThat is BY FAR the best I have been paid.  If people ask I usually tell them<br/>\nI have received between 1GP and 29PP before.  I usually get about 1PP<br/>\ndepending on the difficulty.  I think I&#39;ll stick with this practice.  But if<br/>\nI am running to somewhere an catch up to someone going the same place I will<br/>\ninvite them and speed them up for no charge.
