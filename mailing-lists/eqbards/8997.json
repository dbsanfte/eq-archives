There were a total<br/>\nof seven people in the zone.  Fortunately, one of the players was a 36th<br/>\nlevel cleric in my guild.  She was grouped with a 33 bard.  I joined with<br/>\nthem in the basement and our goal was to get two bracelets for the bards.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe cleric went Invis and found a GDB behind the hidden wall.  She was full<br/>\nmana and decided to solo a GDB that she found.  She was doing OK and told us<br/>\nto stay by the stairs.  She killed the GDB and confirmed that it dropped a<br/>\nbracelet.  The other bard and I randomed for it and I won.  Before I could<br/>\nloot the GDB, the cleric got jumped by two werebats.  She returned to the<br/>\nstairs and by the time we finished them off, the cleric was out of mana.  I<br/>\nwas unfamiliar with the layout of the basement so had to wait on her to<br/>\nguide me to the GDB corpse.  She medded up and cast Invis Undead on the two<br/>\nof us.  We got to the corpse and I clicked on it to target it.  Not a<br/>\nmicrosecond later, the corpse disappeared.  The eight minute time limit<br/>\nelapsed right before I right clicked on it to loot.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTo add to the misfortune, we got jumped by a festering hag and another<br/>\ngreater dark bone.  We fought them at the zone border but I was getting beat<br/>\nup on so had to flee.  They eventually killed them both but because I was in<br/>\nDagnor&#39;s, I missed out on my first chance to get revenge on a festering hag.<br/>\nFestering hags have killed me more than any other creature in Unrest and I<br/>\nwas looking forward to finally killing one.  The GDB we killed didn&#39;t drop a<br/>\nbracelet and it was getting late so I camped without getting a bracelet.<br/>\nLooking forward to trying again though:-)<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
