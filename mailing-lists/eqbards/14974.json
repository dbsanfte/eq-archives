Nothing wrong with biffisms (well, yes there is, I<br/>\nHATE them -- ur not mad r u d00dz? k3wl.), but it is generally easier to<br/>\npersuad someone if your presentation is lucid and well structured.  Also,<br/>\nplease bear in mind that, with 2 exceptions, none of our songs are as<br/>\npowerful as a comperable casted verison and I would not anticipate any new<br/>\nsong to deviate.  As well, our songs are generally party in nature or area<br/>\nof effect and fall in the broad categories of buffs, debuffs, and travel.<br/>\nWe have three ulility songs, perhaps thats an area of exploration.  As<br/>\nalways, try and consider the implications of the your proposed<br/>\nimplimentation with respect to stacking, twisting combinations and class<br/>\nbalance.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n-GW<br/>\nTork@Nameless</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
