Bards have many other songs<br/>\nthat can be of better use.  If you want to solo, there are many other ways<br/>\nto do so.  Bellow is just like the kick that Warriors get, nothing too<br/>\npowerful, just a bit of extra added damage.  Don&#39;t expect Bellow to be your<br/>\nmain damage source.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe instead of struggling soloing blues, you should try grouping for a<br/>\nchange.  Bards are very effective in a group, as long as you don&#39;t continue<br/>\nto Bellow.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWayne<br/>\n<br/>\nPS - My most frustrating experience with a Bard was when I was playing my<br/>\nCleric and grouped with four tanks (War, War, Ranger, Pally) all around lvl<br/>\n16.  We were fighting crocs in the Oasis.  I was just thinking how we could<br/>\nrock with a Bard, when there was a lvl 17 Bard needing a group.  This Bard<br/>\nkept using Bellow constantly.  I tried and tried to explain to him how much<br/>\nmore effective we would be if he played group songs to no avail.  I really<br/>\nwanted to cry.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;    Date: Fri, 12 Nov 1999 12:03:35 +0000<br/>\n&gt;    From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:John_Senior@...\">John_Senior@...</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: Bellow song Damage<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I being a level 27 Bard probably use Bellow more than any other song as<br/>\n&gt; that little extra dmg is great. However I do feel that this song should do<br/>\n&gt; more dmg than just the 1/2 level +1. It&#39;s quite pathetic to think that at<br/>\n&gt; level 50 you will only do 26 DMG with it. Currently I am doing 14 dmg and<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s good but not good enough to solo stuff without having lots of<br/>\n&gt; downtime.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Personally I feel that Bellow should be current Level +1 dmg so for<br/>\n </span></blockquote>example<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; at my level (27) I would do 28 dmg per bellow, or as another formula have<br/>\n&gt; 1/2 current level + 5 dmg and an extra 5 dmg every 10 levels, so at level<br/>\n&gt; 12 you do 1/2 level +5 dmg and then at level 22 you do 1/2 Level +10 dmg<br/>\n&gt; and so on. this would not be over powered when you consider what other<br/>\n&gt; melee classes get. We have not got Kick, Double attack, bash and don&#39;t get<br/>\n&gt; Critical hits etc. Plus we can&#39;t use 2 handed weapons.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The only problem I can see with Bellow doing more dmg is that people will<br/>\n&gt; kite as a bard with a great deal of ease (I kited Born D&#39;inn at level 22<br/>\n&gt; and it took me 35 minutes to kill him).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I know Bards aren&#39;t supposed to be hardened fighters I just feel we lack<br/>\n&gt; that cutting edge.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Is there anyway that if everyone on this list agrees with me or if they<br/>\n&gt; have another formula suggestion that we could petition verant and get it<br/>\n&gt; changed? Or are verant only into &#39;Nerfing&#39;??<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Madagan, who struggles to solo blues </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
