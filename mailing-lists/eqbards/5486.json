I&#39;m sorry if my appology about my english is bothering<br/>\n&gt;you but I said that because I mean it. The fact is that I got a few mails<br/>\n&gt;about my language and they weren&#39;t very pleasent to read. If you think my<br/>\n&gt;english is good enough then I can say just one thing. Thanks god at least<br/>\n&gt;one. Beleive me this is the first mail in which my english is mentioned as<br/>\n&gt;something good. So I&#39;ll never write that appology about my language again.<br/>\n&gt;I hope I didn&#39;t iritate you to much, If I did then I&#39;m sorry I just wanted<br/>\n&gt;to help.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Heck, I&#39;m just glad y&#39;all can play the game.

I&#39;ve seen numerous sites<br/>\nin other languages, so I know there are lots of &#39;foreign&#39; players (It&#39;s the<br/>\ninternet, how can we be foreigners?).  I myself have been accused of being<br/>\nBritish on more than one occasion, which, personally, I find quite<br/>\nhumourous. ;)<br/>\nAnyway, keep on trucking, and if you understood this missive, yer probably<br/>\nmore than qualified to post here.
