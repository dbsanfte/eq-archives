I have a right to be pissed of Verant released the game early<br/>\nplanning on itemizing certain high level zones and adding the rest of the<br/>\nzones as people leveled up. Well guess what they didn&#39;t think we&#39;d level so<br/>\nfast and play so much so now they are in deep shit and I have a right to be<br/>\npissed of when the two dungeons people hunt in for exp and items both have<br/>\nover 100+ people at the same time and close to that every single night!!!<br/>\nEspecially when one of them can support maybe 30-40 people and the other<br/>\nsupports 60 tops.<br/>\n<br/>\nNaeeldar<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: joseph &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jmounts@...\">jmounts@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Friday, January 28, 2000 11:34 AM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Re: PoA bard quests plus a rant<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: joseph &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jmounts@...\">jmounts@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Naeeldar,<br/>\n&gt;Personally, Im getting tired of your posts on this topic.  Every one of<br/>\n&gt;them says the same thing: low and mid levels aren&#39;t worthy to lick high<br/>\n&gt;level&#39;s boots, high levels are the Gods, and should be treated as such (my<br/>\n&gt;loose, but, i think, accurate interpretation of your posts here).  You&#39;re<br/>\n&gt;high level, live with the consequenses.  No one promised you endless<br/>\n&gt;excitement, perfect hunting zones, and new territories at level 50.  You<br/>\n&gt;knew, pretty much from the start, that level 50 was the pinnacle.  You&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt;reached the end (well maybe not the end, but more like a pause, until the<br/>\n&gt;expansion comes out) of your journey in EQ.  Why not do a little bit of<br/>\n&gt;exploring now?  Im sure you haven&#39;t seen ALL of Norrath.  Why, the last few<br/>\n&gt;days have been quite enjoyable for me, hiding out in Runnyeye, exploring<br/>\n&gt;the parts of it (still going in invis tho) that I was too afraid to see<br/>\n&gt;when I was of &quot;proper&quot; level to hunt there.  Found a merchant (wouldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;sell to me, go figure), a banker (killed one before I thought to try and<br/>\n&gt;actually &quot;bank&quot; there!-- it works!), a really nifty Slime Elemental that<br/>\n&gt;was a little tricky to get to at first, and a gelatinous cube that I have<br/>\n&gt;yet to find, as well as some underwater passageways that I still have yet<br/>\n&gt;to explore.  Also, try trade skills, or doing some RP events for your<br/>\n&gt;guild, or just enjoying the company of the friends you have made in EQ.<br/>\n&gt;Oh, and another thing: puh-lease trim your messages to the smallest amount<br/>\n&gt;of quoting possible.

By now it&#39;s easily up to 35-45 probably higher. So<br/>\n&gt;no your wrong and again their aren&#39;t problems at mid level you just want<br/>\n&gt;something to be added for it for the hell of it we don&#39;t we want it to be<br/>\n&gt;less crowded and able to hunt in zones.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Naeeldar<br/>\n&gt;-------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;GET A NEXTCARD VISA, in 30 seconds.
