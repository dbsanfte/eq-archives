They just buff you up some, especially getting their<br/>\n&gt;&gt; damage shield, then heal you while you fight reds.  My friend shot up<br/>\n&gt;&gt; his guildmate from 8-12 in a few hours...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  My point is with a bard you dont just click one button to do something.<br/>\n&gt;  Powerleveling a bard is useless, if they dont know what they are doing.<br/>\n&gt;  Most bards I see don&#39;t know what they are doing anyway.  (ie: bellow)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  With clerics, it&#39;s easy - they heal.  With wizards, it&#39;s easy - the<br/>\n&gt;  blast.  Powerleveling a class who has to adapt and think is much more<br/>\n&gt;  difficult, which was the thing I was getting at. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
