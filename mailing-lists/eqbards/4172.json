You may enjoy something that I don&#39;t, and<br/>\nsomeone else may enjoy doing it a different way.  The only time it comes a<br/>\nproblem is when someone&#39;s gaming enjoyment interferes with anothers.  I used<br/>\nmy friend at work as an example:  his gaming experience enjoyment consists<br/>\nof being able to use cheat codes. If he can&#39;t cheat at a game, he won&#39;t<br/>\nplay.  My gaming enjoyment is exploration and dying :).  Another friend from<br/>\nwork has the enjoyment of safety and no death.  As a level 20 druid he has<br/>\ndied twice.  And another friend from work enjoys tradeskills.  He is a<br/>\nmaster jewelcrafter and is working on blacksmithing now  (which I think<br/>\ntrade skills are boring).   No one knows what someone&#39;s gaming experience is<br/>\n- it is different from everyone.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
