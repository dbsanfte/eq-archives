Who says fishing isn&#39;t worth the time spent on it?<br/>\n&gt;&gt; All of my characters do fishing as a major pasttime of their lives!<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Fish sell for 2s each! And when you fish up sandals (Meara is still<br/>\n&gt;&gt; wearing Tattered Sandals she fished up), fish scales (Water Breathing<br/>\n&gt;&gt; anyone?) and Rusty daggers, they don&#39;t even use a lure up!<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;And if you spent the same time killing mobs you&#39;d probably come out with<br/>\n&gt;more cash and more exp for the same time spent. Fishing at low levels is<br/>\n&gt;only worth the time spent on it if you put an extremely low value on<br/>\n&gt;your time.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So? I get SICK of running around killing mobs all the time. Sometimes I<br/>\nlike to be calm, not worry about dying, interact with other people. This<br/>\nis not, for me, a game that is all about leveling, and leveling alone.<br/>\nOtherwise, why would my highest character only be 19 when I started her<br/>\nback on May 8?<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t say that fishing was the most efficient use of your time. (it is<br/>\none of the safest. I have never been killed while fishing) But then, neither<br/>\nis running to Kelethin from Qeynos at level 7 to buy your level 8 song --&gt;<br/>\nand<br/>\nthen having to go back at 11 to get that song as well. However, I know<br/>\na level 50 bard who can&#39;t find her way around Rivervale -- not even to<br/>\nthe bank. I don&#39;t have any characters near that, but I can give you all the<br/>\ndirections there you want -- including where to find shurikens.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow many level 8 characters go deep into the Third Gate of Neriak? Level 9s<br/>\nin Solusek A?  How do you think Meara got her last name of &quot;Daring&quot; :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThat same level 50 bard can&#39;t find her way across the Rathe Mountains. I<br/>\ncan&#39;t quite give other people directions yet, but I can run through without<br/>\na map. There are many many things to do in Everquest that do not involve<br/>\ngetting the optimal ratio between time spent and experience received.<br/>\n<br/>\nSarah Heacock   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sarah@...\">sarah@...</a><br/>\nMeara, level 14 Enchanter, Master Jeweler, owner Meara&#39;s Boutique of<br/>\nMystiques, Phoenix, Solusek Ro /<br/>\nFaerain, level 19 Soldier of Tunare, Phoenix, Solusek Ro /<br/>\nFaesong, level 8 HalfElf Bard of Solusek Ro, Phoenix, Solusek Ro<br/>\n(Blackburrow)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
