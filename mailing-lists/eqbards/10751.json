I have no beef with tanks binding outside of cities. It would mean<br/>\nwe could get back to our playing all that much faster. I&#39;ve even run out to<br/>\nzone line<br/>\nin various city zones to bind people so they can be that much closer to<br/>\nwhere they are going<br/>\n(or because they are evil and can&#39;t go in further)<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t handicap everyone in some move of spite. Try to get stuff added to<br/>\neveryone.<br/>\nIMHO, it is ridiculous not to allow it.

Naturally the gobs all headed that way<br/>\n&gt;&gt; immediately.  Also since SoW can last for 25+ minutes its pretty easy for<br/>\n&gt;&gt; SoW casters to still have speed underground and cause huge trains so that<br/>\n&gt;&gt; only the bards get their speed taken away.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  I can forsee in the future, no more binding inside dungeons.<br/>\n&gt;  There is no real need for it.  And it&#39;s only used to exploit<br/>\n&gt;  the game:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  1) Find the mob you want, tag it, gate to zoneline, and fight<br/>\n&gt;     it there in a safer environment.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  2) Raid of Vox/Nagafen.  Need I say more?  hehehe.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  3) Shortcuts back into deep dungeon areas to kill X mob<br/>\n&gt;     instead of running through a fully spawned dungeon.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Those are the things I&#39;ve seen, I bet there are 3 more<br/>\n&gt;  uses for the binding in dungeons which exploit one thing<br/>\n&gt;  or another.  There is really no good reason to bind in<br/>\n&gt;  a dungeon to defend doing it.  I mean they can bind right<br/>\n&gt;  outside the entrance, which is something non-casters wont<br/>\n&gt;  be able to do anyway.  No binding in dungeons would elimate<br/>\n&gt;  the ability for casters to psuedo-train in the same fashion<br/>\n&gt;  as Verant has deemed SoW/Selos users.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Harmonic.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt;with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
