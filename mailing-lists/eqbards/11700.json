Personally, I&#39;d put off going there until<br/>\neverywhere else you can possibly hunt is green. At mid-high 30&#39;s I think<br/>\nthe king room in perma is still quite blue. I&#39;m not sure when the exp<br/>\ntapers off in the king and other deep areas in Sol A, but I&#39;d check<br/>\nthere. Both of these places require good parties before you go though.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
