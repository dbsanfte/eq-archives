The bashing they receive is amazing though, and on a whole,<br/>\nundeserved; especially The Twelve Moons, which is a predominately German<br/>\nguild.  They get a few too many anti-German comments for my taste (focusing<br/>\non their nationality not the way they play the game).  <br/>\n<br/>\nThose in the guilds attribute it to jealousy but more realistically, I think<br/>\nits frustration.  The successful large guilds are highly organized, and<br/>\nwhere it might take a rag-tag group (or smaller guild) 4 hours to prepare<br/>\nfor and kill something, these guys can walk in and do it in an hour (or<br/>\nless).  I don&#39;t think its because they are better players at all, but<br/>\nbecause they have a few people who possess leadership, motivation and<br/>\norganization.  And its frustration, not jealousy that causes bitter comments<br/>\nwhen a group of 3 guilds has been clearing Fear for 12 hours only to have a<br/>\nlarger/more experienced/uber/whatever guild waltz into a plane and steal the<br/>\nkill.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I&#39;ll stop now before I insult someone :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nHally<br/>\nSolRo<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\tGarramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)<br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:garramone@...\">garramone@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tThursday, May 11, 2000 11:17 AM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n\t\tSubject:\tRE: [eqbards] Race to 60 (OT)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\twe get the same thing on our server, as i am sure every<br/>\n&quot;uber-guild&quot; (stupid<br/>\n\t\tterm) does on their respective servers.  i don&#39;t think<br/>\nanyone is quite as<br/>\n\t\tlarge or has quite the attitude that FoH apparently does<br/>\nthough.  i think<br/>\n\t\tthey have 300 or so members, so they can really take over a<br/>\nlarge portion of<br/>\n\t\tthe high level game from other players.  we have about 65<br/>\nmembers or so, and<br/>\n\t\twe can do dragons and planes at our leisure as well, but we<br/>\nwork very well<br/>\n\t\twith the other guilds on the server capable of doing these.<br/>\ni don&#39;t believe<br/>\n\t\tthat is the case with FoH.  i have no first-hand experience<br/>\nbut from what i<br/>\n\t\thear they deserve their rep, but i guess only those who have<br/>\ndealt with them<br/>\n\t\tpersonally can know.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tok bragging time, we killed Venril Sathir first =b<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tShada Powa, L53 Wood Elf Minstrel<br/>\n\t\tTyria Sarkin, L50 High Elf Wizard<br/>\n\t\t&lt;Afterlife&gt; Mithaniel Marr Server<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t\t&gt; You can&#39;t believe how much FOH bashing there is on the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Veeshan message<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t\t&gt; boards.
