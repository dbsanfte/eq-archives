There&#39;s a group<br/>\nof 2 rangers and shaman there whacking on things and the shaman spots me.<br/>\nHe runs over and asks if I&#39;m grouped.  Since I&#39;m not yet, I join them in<br/>\ntheir destruction of the undead in the area.  Things proceed nicely.<br/>\nEveryone is happy to have a bard and are thoroughly impressed with the<br/>\nincrease in effectiveness of the group, but then one of the rangers decides<br/>\nto leave.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe figure we&#39;ll still be ok and I pull out my claw and silvery axe instead<br/>\nof my dual gnoll hide lariats which I was using before.  Things continue to<br/>\nbe good until the shaman decides to pull a skelly and two come.  Of course,<br/>\nthis valley has lots of wanderers, so we pick up two wanderers also.  The<br/>\nranger peels off one mob while I start tanking (ack!) one of the skellys<br/>\n(and one of the wanderers of course) and the shaman blasts the other skelly<br/>\nto oblivion.  Things are looking bad as I get down to a little less than two<br/>\nbubs, so I flip on Selo&#39;s and start running circles around the group while<br/>\nthey finish off another mob.  The shaman and ranger med and heal while I<br/>\nkeep the last two mobs busy running in circles.  Then we manage to polish<br/>\neverything off.  This was really nice.  Both the shaman and ranger were duly<br/>\nimpressed, but then the ranger and shaman both had to camp out.<br/>\n<br/>\nThings have been going great this night, so I decide to look for another<br/>\ngroup, and find a rogue to partner up with.  We move over to the back<br/>\nentrace of the Sarnak fortress, and I use lament to pull one of the two<br/>\nsarnaks at the entrance.  We proceed to demolish this recruit (I love<br/>\nrogues!).  And continue to pull a couple more singles.  Things are still<br/>\ngoing great, we&#39;re finishing up another recruit when another player runs out<br/>\nof the fortress and starts yelling for help.  We proceed to finish our fight<br/>\nand just as this recruit dies, bam, we get trained by a sarnak adherent and<br/>\npet.  I get nailed by a darkness spell and end up dying.<br/>\n<br/>\nI proceed to remem my songs, grab a spare drum and truck it back to my<br/>\ncorpse.  The rogue asks the other player why he trained us and his response<br/>\nwas that since we didn&#39;t help us, he figured we should go down with him.  I<br/>\nwas floored.  We were already engaged, and he thought we should turn to help<br/>\nhim???  I guess I should have logged off sooner. :(<br/>\n<br/>\nGilgurth<br/>\nBard of 25 Winces<br/>\nE&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nNever lose a file again.
