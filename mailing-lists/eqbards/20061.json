The original ones now seem perfectly<br/>\ncomfortable with my bard and his contribution.  Of course now we regularly<br/>\nhave at least 2 good tanks (ranger, monk, or warrior).  Basically the melee<br/>\nguys love having me around, it mostly the true casters that think bards<br/>\ndon&#39;t pull their weight.  The clerics and druids have never complained, its<br/>\nthe enchanters, necros, etc.  In part they are right.  In a caster heavy<br/>\ngroup with an enchanter there isn&#39;t much I can do without making the<br/>\nenchanter totally change his strategy from mezzing to stunning or something.<br/>\nOf course they seem to have no problem with the fact that I have to change<br/>\nmy strategy every group I&#39;m in according to the group I&#39;m in&#39;s membership.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically though you are correct.  The SolA group was almost always no<br/>\ntanks.  Since they realized they needed tanks, they suggested someone ought<br/>\nto play a warrior.  It was implied sometimes that that someone should be<br/>\nsomeone who was trying to tank anyhow and wasn&#39;t really all that important<br/>\nto the group&#39;s success, ie the bard.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that we have plenty of tanks the group likes having me around.  They see<br/>\nthat a bard can be versatile to handle just about any kind of bad situation<br/>\nthat occurs except one that requires someone to soak up a lot of damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s just that I have basically given up on grouping with the enchanters.<br/>\nIt&#39;s nothing but a big headache.  There&#39;s really not a whole lot I can do if<br/>\nmy tanking is sub par and I can&#39;t use any songs that might awaken his mezzed<br/>\nmobs.  So long as I can find a group that doesn&#39;t have enchanters in it I<br/>\ncan do very well.  Sometimes it&#39;s hard to find a group without one and<br/>\nthat&#39;s when the suggestions begin.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\nForgive me if I get this all wrong, my memory&#39;s not the best.  A while back<br/>\nsome bard was distressed because the group he was hunting with in one of the<br/>\nSols kept insisting that he tank.  When he tanked, he died.  When he refused<br/>\nto tank, the others grouped without him claiming they could handled just as<br/>\nmany mobs without a bard as with one.  What&#39;s more his group suggested he<br/>\nretire the bard and roll up a warrior so that he could tank without dieing.<br/>\nWas that you, Kitasi?  My advice at the time was to get some new friends.<br/>\nMy advice now is to get some new friends.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPeace<br/>\nEvulia, bard of 11 missed notes, Tunare</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
