Still if I had his job,<br/>\nand thank goodness I do not, I would make sure I learned a lot about every<br/>\nclass.  I have noticed he has had some better ideas lately.  I still think<br/>\nremoving the invis component is the right move.  It would make the song more<br/>\nuseful overall while reducing its uses in some specialty situations.  There<br/>\nis precious little you cannot outrun with SSoT and levitation alone.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\nGuys,<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s a necro, he had an idea then got corrected on it.  Quit bashing for no<br/>\ndamn reason.  Gordon has never played a bard, and likely never will.<br/>\n<br/>\nFYI:  I&#39;ve known him, in game, since Beta 2.  He&#39;s a nice guy, fun to hunt<br/>\nwith and very knowledgeable about his OWN class.  Just like we are.  You<br/>\ncan&#39;t blame him for not knowing bards.  He&#39;s a mouthpiece, nothing more.  He<br/>\nhad an idea, offered it up and was wrong and admitted it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat MORE do you want?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll jump on him anytime he&#39;s blatantly wrong but when he admits his mistake<br/>\ngive him a break<br/>\n<br/>\nLyrnia</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
