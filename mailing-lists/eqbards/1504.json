My party today (me, 2 dwarf clerics, 1 monk, and<br/>\n&gt; 2 paladins all lvls 7-10) spent about 3 hours camping one of the orc camps<br/>\n&gt; near the Hidden Inn in E. Commons.  After the first hard battle, we took them<br/>\n&gt; one or two at a time.  It worked out quite well and nearly got me to lvl 9. <br/>\n&gt; When we disbanded, I moved along to the Hidden Inn to pick up another party. <br/>\n&gt; Within 15 minutes, I had died 3 times from people training Centurions and<br/>\n&gt; Legionnaires to the inn from the other orc camp.  For some reason, I feel<br/>\n&gt; obligated to help these morons out every time and it tends to cost me quite a<br/>\n&gt; bit of my xp.  Needless to say I am 1 1/2 bubble away from 9 now.  Does<br/>\n&gt; anyone have any thoughts on how I should handle these types of situations? <br/>\n&gt; From what I understand from this list, the lvl 8 song would be a great help.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Suggestion #1 - Don&#39;t help.
