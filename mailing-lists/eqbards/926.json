I haven&#39;t seen one person in the game who could explain me how it works<br/>\nand what it really does. It is said that monsters can&#39;t hear you when your<br/>\nsneaking, but I really doubt that this is very usefull. I don&#39;t know either<br/>\nhow to use it correctly. Do you have to be in walk mode to start sneaking?<br/>\nSometimes I just can&#39;t hit the sneak button for hours, i don&#39;t know why.<br/>\nI would really appreciate every kind of help...<br/>\n<br/>\nAthelas<br/>\nTarew Marr, lv 18<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nSent through Global Message Exchange - <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.gmx.net\">http://www.gmx.net</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
