The Paladin died the monk FD&#39;d and the casters gated.<br/>\nDruid failed the evac as he was getting a beating.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had to go after this and never got the chance to get a lute, although I<br/>\ngot the black silk gloves (in case you don&#39;t know, I am getting a friend<br/>\nfull Lambent in return for a Yak). All I need to know is was I in the right<br/>\nplace to get the lute, who drops it and is it a rare drop?<br/>\n<br/>\nMany Thanks<br/>\n<br/>\nMadagan Songweaver, Bard of 35 Songs - Veeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________________________<br/>\nThe information contained in this message may be CONFIDENTIAL and is<br/>\nintended for the addressee only.
