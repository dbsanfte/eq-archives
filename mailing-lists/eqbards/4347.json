There is most<br/>\ndefinatly some bard aggro bugwhich can occur in seemingly any zone.  I have<br/>\npersonally experienced this super aggro in butcherblock, oasis, and unrest.<br/>\nWhen I was in oasis, orcs were barelling over the dunes to find me, you can see<br/>\nquite a ways in oasis so I would see several dark forms off in the distance<br/>\nbeelining for me and when they got close, hey 5-6 orcs all over. What joy!<br/>\nThank Erollisi for Selo&#39;s (the biggest lifesaver of them all)  This has happened<br/>\nto me in those other zones as well... for no apparent reason, no group attacking<br/>\nanything like you suggest, things come out f the woodworks and ignore the<br/>\nmedding nukers and beeline for the bard.  Its disgustingly insane, even when we<br/>\nhave to zone to clear the faction list.<br/>\n*sigh*<br/>\nJM, Care to comment?<br/>\nPenaden Songweaver<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lostorder.com\">http://www.lostorder.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nJames Schuldes wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: James Schuldes &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hmmm, bards have the rep for being monster magnets.  But you prolly need to<br/>\n&gt; play your songs no matter what  but not AE (Area Effect).  You dint say<br/>\n&gt; zactly how young you are but the gnolls will go agro on people they see that<br/>\n&gt; look tasty to them.  they can tell how young you are and will attack you if<br/>\n&gt; they think they can win. As you get older they get smarter and if they are<br/>\n&gt; trival to you they don&#39;t attack.  Unless of course their friends have<br/>\n&gt; whipped them in to a frenzy and they are trying to help - ie you have<br/>\n&gt; started a train.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Selos is not an area effect on NPC&#39;s so it should not matter.  But if one of<br/>\n&gt; your party had attacked that gnoll and gotten on its hate list - then when<br/>\n&gt; it comes up and see you helping the party - it gets mad at you and attacks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you play an aera effect - like chords in a place like BB - that&#39;s very<br/>\n&gt; high traffic and multi- level - you will get a LOT of attention real<br/>\n&gt; quick!!!  So don&#39;t play AE songs in dungeons - as a rule.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sylly<br/>\n&gt; Bard of the 18th level<br/>\n&gt; a.k.a.

Boy was it dangerous!!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;                 Anyway, when sitting down with my group while all the spell<br/>\n&gt; chuckers<br/>\n&gt;                 recovered from their oh so hard zapping, playing a nice tune<br/>\n&gt; just in<br/>\n&gt;                 case we needed to run for the exit, it didn&#39;t take long for<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt;                 nearest gnoll to suddenly turn and jump on me.
