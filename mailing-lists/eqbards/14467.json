I was at<br/>\nthe wooden bridge when a druid came running down the<br/>\nroad being chased by Grimfeather, a kite gone bad I<br/>\nthink.  I ran up the shore to the north to stay out of<br/>\nGrim&#39;s aggro radius.  I also fired up Selo&#39;s &quot;just in<br/>\ncase&quot;.  As soon as the druid zoned Grim came straight<br/>\nat me.  Not up the road and then turning toward me,<br/>\nbut in a straight beeline.  To make a long story<br/>\nshort, I went from full health to dead before I could<br/>\nzone.  I was never closer than 150 yds to him before<br/>\nhe attacked.  I&#39;m sure glad the Taunt has been<br/>\nreduced.<br/>\n<br/>\nTomerrilin<br/>\nBard of the 22nd, 23rd, 22nd song<br/>\nMith Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n--- &quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Dean_Kimes@...\">Dean_Kimes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hmmm, that is awfully similar to my near death last<br/>\n&gt; nite.
