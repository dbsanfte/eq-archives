CoFr+CoF+FCC w/ Selo&#39;s drum = 28.2 damage/sec,<br/>\nHymn+Niv&#39;s+CoC+CoD w/ Kelin&#39;s lute = 16.3 damage/sec and<br/>\nhealing 38 hp(?)/6 sec.  Total would be 44.5 damage/sec (equal<br/>\nto 5 bards meleeing :), healing 6.3 hp/sec.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe resist debuffs from the Chants are nice too.  We weren&#39;t<br/>\ntaking much damage so I told the cleric to nuke whenever he<br/>\nsaw the &quot;hair stands on end&quot; message.  He reported only about<br/>\n1 in 5 wraths were being resisted, and most were hitting for<br/>\nfull damage, despite most of the seafuries being red to him<br/>\n(a few were yellow).<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
