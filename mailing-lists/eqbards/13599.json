I also think its one<br/>\n&gt;of those threads where both sides of the argument are correct.  As a 50th<br/>\n&gt;level character, Naeeldar&#39;s opinion is the the #1 problem with EQ is that<br/>\n&gt;there isn&#39;t enough stuff for 50th level players to do.  I agree with him<br/>\n&gt;100%.  As a 32d level player, my opinion is that the #1 problem with EQ is<br/>\n&gt;that Verant seems to be neglecting the 46- players.  By this I mean there<br/>\n&gt;are a lot of areas in the game that need to be fixed, i.e. more quality<br/>\n&gt;quests, new items for medium level characters, bugs, etc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Bottom line is that if EQ is gonna remain profitable over the next few<br/>\n&gt;years, both areas need to be fixed.  Verant has stated that they have<br/>\n&gt;multiple teams working on different areas (expansion, fixing current game,<br/>\n&gt;etc).  It just seems to me that all improvements to the game are geared<br/>\n&gt;toward keeping the 46+ players happy (i.e. all the teams really working on<br/>\n&gt;the same thing) and not fixing the stuff broken in the current game.  IMO,<br/>\n&gt;fixing whats broken in the current game and adding new content (quality<br/>\n&gt;quests) is more appropriate for the long term health of the game.  Now the<br/>\n&gt;counter argument is that if the level 50 players don&#39;t have something to<br/>\n </span></blockquote>do,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;they will cancel their subscription. Here&#39;s my opinion on that.  At some<br/>\n&gt;point in time, I think you just have to say its time to hang up the spurs<br/>\n&gt;and move on.  Either you start another character or you move on to another<br/>\n&gt;game.  Like Kitasi said in his post, the programmers will never be able to<br/>\n&gt;keep up with the level 50 players.  The expansion will only be a short term<br/>\n&gt;fix.  Assuming EQ2 is several years down the road, fixing the current game<br/>\n&gt;(bugs) and adding new content (for everyone level 1-50) is the only viable<br/>\n&gt;option from a business perspective IMO.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Actually I think Verant is missing the point there.  They will never be<br/>\n&gt;&gt; able<br/>\n&gt;&gt; to do enough to keep up with the level 50 players unless they totally<br/>\n&gt;&gt; ignore<br/>\n&gt;&gt; the lower level players.  The majority of the level 50 players play the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; game<br/>\n&gt;&gt; far too much for Verant to be able to keep up wit providing them new<br/>\n&gt;&gt; stuff.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Although those players play the game more they don&#39;t pay any more than<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; lower level players.
