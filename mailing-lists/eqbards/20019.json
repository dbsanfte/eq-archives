Those same <br/>\nsources say the Jade Mace is worth ~12k.  Face value says, no it&#39;s <br/>\nnot a good trade. :)  But, consider the Jade Mace is the best Bard <br/>\nwieldable 1HB weapon in the game AND has better dam/delay ratio than <br/>\nthe Symphonic Saber and Harmonic Dagger (without the proc).  You&#39;ll <br/>\ndo MUCH better with the mace in your primary hand than with a Yak... <br/>\nKeep the 2 Yaks, &quot;play&quot; with them for a little while, then sell it <br/>\noff. :) I&#39;d see what else this guy could cough up to even out the <br/>\ntrade a little and take it in a heartbeat. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a similar note - I&#39;ve acquired an Arbitor&#39;s Combine Longsword in a <br/>\ntrade for a Necklace of Superiority.  The Stats, 2HS 30/43 +15 Wis <br/>\n+25 Mana War/Rng/Pal/SK, have Ranger and Pally written all over it.  <br/>\nmaximumeq has a value on it at ~30k.  I&#39;m trying to work a trade <br/>\nfor &quot;several&quot; high end Bard items, but am having trouble finding <br/>\nanyone with more than 1, lol.  The best I&#39;ve found so far is Singing <br/>\nSteel Gaunts and Selo&#39;s Drum (I&#39;m trying to get 1 more item out of <br/>\nher).  The person I&#39;m working with thinks the Drum is worth the same <br/>\nas an FBSS.  I had the opportunity (without the cash) to buy a Selo&#39;s <br/>\nDrum for 5k awhile ago... Anyone know a real value on this?  <br/>\n<br/>\nDarkfox Reven&#39;tsol<br/>\nCringing at the thought of one more person on Xegony /auction &lt;insert <br/>\nitem here&gt; Looking for Bard Items!  :p<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Uhh<br/>\n&gt; What is a swarmcaller?
