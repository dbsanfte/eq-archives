Out of Character, here&#39;s a guide.<br/>\n<br/>\n1.  Twist your spells.  Almost all the spell songs have a 4 to 6<br/>\nsecond duration.  It takes about 3 seconds to switch from one song to<br/>\nanother (I&#39;m at level 11).  So you should be able to keep 2 songs<br/>\ncontinously up, or 3 songs where you manage to replace the 1st song<br/>\nright before it fades away.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  Set up your hotkeys efficiently.  You can pull inventory and<br/>\nweapon slots onto hotkey positions; that will allow you to change<br/>\nweapons and instruments without having to go to the inventory screen.<br/>\n I have three hotkey banks at level 11, described below:<br/>\n<br/>\nBank 3:<br/>\nHeal_Hymn  Discord<br/>\nWhistling   _SIT_<br/>\nBat. Chant  Selo&#39;s<br/>\n<br/>\nBank 5:                 Bank 6:<br/>\nHeal_Hymn  Lullaby      Weapon1  Weapon2<br/>\nWhistling  /assist      Invent5  Invent6<br/>\nAnthem      Selo&#39;s      INCOMING  Selo&#39;s<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve remapped my keyboard such that the player defined keys are  the<br/>\nQWASZX keys, and with the banks set up as they are, I have a really<br/>\neasy time switching around.  I usually keep myself on bank 6,<br/>\nswapping the drum and my weapon as needed.  Entering combat, if I&#39;m<br/>\nsolo, I do shift-A, A and get whistle started.  If I&#39;m in a group,<br/>\nit&#39;s Shift-Z, Z and Anthem is started.  If I need to run, the button<br/>\nis always X for Selo&#39;s, and then shift-X to make sure I get the drum<br/>\nequipped.  If I ever use more than just 1 weapon and 2 instruments,<br/>\nI&#39;ll probably use Bank 4; otherwise, Bank 6 is customized for<br/>\nFetching duties.  You&#39;ll also notice that I have the two stringed<br/>\nsongs on top (QW).  My current favorite pastime is running around a<br/>\nscarab or spider alternating between heal and discord.<br/>\n<br/>\n3.  Magic gloves will not give you the ability to punch with magic. <br/>\nIt seems only monks have that ability.  So stick to magic weapons, or<br/>\nyour songs.<br/>\n<br/>\n4.  Maximize your weapon skills.  1H Slash is great for the beginning<br/>\nlevels, but the best bard weapons are in Piercing.  I use 1H Blunt in<br/>\ntrying out the theory that you can get better pelts if you don&#39;t hack<br/>\nthe animal up -- haven&#39;t proven it yet.<br/>\n<br/>\n5.  Trust us bards:  Faster Weapons are Better.  Statistically, if<br/>\nyou weigh the damage with a probability to hit, you would want more<br/>\nchances to hit.  Besides, heavy weapons are a drain on stamina, and<br/>\nwith the bard&#39;s various combat speed songs, faster weapons definitely<br/>\noutdo the heavier weapons.  The best weapon for its current<br/>\navailability is the Dragoon Dirk from Ambassador Dvinn in Crushbone.<br/>\n<br/>\n6.  Charm (and Lull?) spells will clear the monster&#39;s most-wanted<br/>\nlist.  In some cases, it also clears the damage list.  Clearing the<br/>\nmost-wanted list means the monster will act indifferent again. <br/>\nClearing the damage list means that if someone was trying to<br/>\nkillsteal, they just wasted their mana (heh heh).<br/>\n<br/>\n7.  Travel light.  There&#39;s a theory that getting anywhere near<br/>\nencumberance levels detracts from our fighting skills.  I&#39;m currently<br/>\nonly wearing cloth armor; while I am currently having difficulty with<br/>\nblue monsters, I survive pretty well (Chant does wonders for AC, eh?)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOh ... other ideas:<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can give items to NPCs by left clicking the item onto them.  The<br/>\nitem becomes part of their inventory (so, if you find a short beer<br/>\nand spices in a wolf, that&#39;s from me.  You&#39;re welcome.)  If you give<br/>\na weapon to a humanoid NPC, they will usually equip that weapon. <br/>\nThis has been reported to have been done to guards with orc picks, as<br/>\nwell as orc centurions / legionnaires with orc picks.  Someday, I&#39;ll<br/>\nwalk up to a sand giant and teach him the beauty of orc picks.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can kite by alternating Selo&#39;s and Bellow.  If you don&#39;t have<br/>\nthat, your next best option is Selo&#39;s and Hymn (run away, heal up<br/>\nfast, turn back and fight).  If you&#39;re in a safe area and know how to<br/>\nrun around monsters, you can swap Selo&#39;s and Dissonance. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnthem and Chant will not stack.  So Chant when solo, and Anthem<br/>\n(group +10% battle speed) when in a group.  Always use Whistle (+20%<br/>\nbattle speed) if you&#39;re tanking.  Whistle and Anthem will give you<br/>\n25% battle speed.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn game time, Jig does not improve mana regen.  However, it seems to<br/>\nimprove screen refresh rates (?huh??)  so perceptually, it looks like<br/>\nmana is regen faster.<br/>\n<br/>\nHymn will even out with (asp/darkweed) poison damage.  Hymn with an<br/>\ninstrument will let you heal albeit slower.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen running with Selo&#39;s in a group, try being the last one so that<br/>\nno one is left behind.  If you&#39;re stuck as pointman, switch to walk<br/>\n(I have agility 90, with selo and the hand drum, I seem to be walking<br/>\njust as fast as anyone else is running.  Heh!)<br/>\n<br/>\nJig restores stamina.  Most known use is to allow you to swim above<br/>\nwater for longer periods of time.  You can also use it to avoid<br/>\nhunger&thirst death -- you&#39;ll still be hungry, but you are &quot;tough&quot;<br/>\nenough to take it ... until you get to your corpse.<br/>\n<br/>\n(That&#39;s why I avoided getting bound in the bank.  I can run 5 zones<br/>\n... maybe more ... without suffering.  Just a lot of spam, but we&#39;re<br/>\nused to that anyway).<br/>\n<br/>\nSelo&#39;s will accelerate you when running over ground and when swimming<br/>\nunderwater.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake up baking.  There&#39;s nothing more relaxing after getting chased<br/>\nby monsters than chasing after monsters.  I spend about an hour each<br/>\ngame session running around with the newbies and making batwing<br/>\ncrunchies, edible goo, clumps of dough, rat sandwiches, and brewing<br/>\nup ginesh and bog juice.  It helps fill up that time when you&#39;re<br/>\nwaiting for wizards to finish medding or when you&#39;re organizing a<br/>\ngroup together.<br/>\n<br/>\n----<br/>\nStormtower<br/>\nBard of the 11th Chorus<br/>\nFreeport, Prexus.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
