Aren&#39;t there already speedups that are nearly<br/>\n&gt; that good, just not bard speedups, that last for far longer than 18 secs?<br/>\n<br/>\nIIRC, enchanter Alacrity was a 25% reduction in delay.  <br/>\nEnchanter Celerity was a 30% reduction in delay.  Bard<br/>\nCelerity was about a 15% reduction in delay, Beserkers was<br/>\nabout 17% at 48.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe speedups tend to be rather expensive for enchanters to<br/>\ncast, and last about 5-10 minutes.  Buffing four tanks with<br/>\nSLTW wipes out a bit more than half a typical enchanter&#39;s mana<br/>\n(takes about 2-3 minutes to get it back with their own<br/>\nClarity).  Usually, most of them just stick with Augmentation<br/>\n(15% reduction in delay) unless there&#39;s a big fight brewing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd like I explained, the double damage portion of the<br/>\nproposed song more than made up for the short duration IMHO.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
