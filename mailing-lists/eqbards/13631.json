Until now, we ve had no problems finding places to hunt.  Sol A","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1548388005\">I&#39;m now level 40, my wife&#39;s wood elf warrior is 38 going on 39 and my<br/>\nbrother&#39;s druid is 37.  Until now, we&#39;ve had no problems finding places to<br/>\nhunt.  Sol A kings room, Lower Guk BR, MM, CT, Perma, etc.  When one is<br/>\ncamped we would simply go to another.  We haven&#39;t had problems finding a<br/>\nspot since we&#39;ve graduated from aviaks at 23.  Now that I&#39;ve hit 40 and the<br/>\nnon-green spots in each of these are camped, we have to go elsewhere to get<br/>\nxp.  My brother is a druid, so he pulls out the spell book and we go off and<br/>\nflying looking for places to hunt.  Zone into sol b and everything is camped<br/>\nbut the circle room.   That sucked with a whole 4 miserable spawns every 25<br/>\nor so minutes ASSUMING that someone from noble or pool didn&#39;t pull one of<br/>\nour precious few spawns first.  Zone into lower guk and everything is camped<br/>\nincluding the live side bridge.  Zone into Ogguk to find two groups already<br/>\nsharing bouncers, one with a waiting list and the other made up of two high<br/>\n40&#39;s not interested in more, spectres taken, dw gobs in oasis camped, giants<br/>\nboring, Kithicor is nap time in the day and horrible xp at night, troll<br/>\nguards camped and boring... Paw was even crowded and we don&#39;t know the zone<br/>\nwell enough to find those places where a level 40 can hunt without pulling<br/>\ntrains from hell and half the place cons green.  Worst part is that a huge<br/>\nportion of the populous in most of these areas were level 45 to 50 trying to<br/>\nfarm items or fill the xp bar for the next plane raid.  If the PoF, PoH, and<br/>\nPoS are supposed to help eliviate the high level dungeon over crowding, then<br/>\nthey have not accomplished their goal.  Not being a college student and<br/>\nhaving 2 kids, I don&#39;t have the option of getting on at 2 in the afternoon<br/>\nand squawting a spot until my group logs on.<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t tried the sea clops but at this point I&#39;m giving up.  I don&#39;t want<br/>\nto bother with the boat ride just to find that they are camped too!  I&#39;m<br/>\nnever going to see how much of a hell level 40 is if I can&#39;t find somewhere<br/>\nto hunt.  Yeah I know that I can get in any number of pickup groups in any<br/>\nof these places since every group loves a bard, but none of them have room<br/>\nfor 3!  The reason I play this game is because I can play with my wife and<br/>\nbrother and until now that hasn&#39;t been an issue.  I&#39;ve done every crafted<br/>\nand lambent quest twice at minimum and just about every other quest I know<br/>\nof involves killing greens or yields something that the three of us have no<br/>\ninterest in obtaining.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks to Verant for letting their lack of capacity planning and lack of<br/>\ncreativity for pushing me away from the game that has addicted me since<br/>\nJune.  I&#39;m going to try Asheron&#39;s Call.  I here there is no space shortage<br/>\nand plenty to kill there... Somehow I don&#39;t see the expansion fixing things<br/>\nfor me.  Anyone ever seen a bard sold on e-bay before?<br/>\n<br/>\nTaneran Dreamweaver<br/>\nDisappointed Bard of the 40th song<br/>\n&lt;Clan Jax&gt;<br/>\nPrexus<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Andy Simpson [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hornsfan@...\">hornsfan@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Sunday, January 24, 1999 4:40 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] PoA bard quests plus a rant<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: Andy Simpson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hornsfan@...\">hornsfan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhenders@...\">jhenders@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhenders@...\">jhenders@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  Unrest,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Basement good until 35.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If its quick exp you want, get a cleric and a druid and a tank<br/>\n&gt; and camp the<br/>\n&gt; basement/ghost room.
