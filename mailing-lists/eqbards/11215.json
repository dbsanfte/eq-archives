Every bard could use more dex (less missed notes, less<br/>\nchance of resist) more stamina (my sta is a whopping 67.  I&#39;m sure getting<br/>\nit up to 77 would make a BIG difference), the haste effect would actually<br/>\nturn us into semi-decent meleers.  At least we&#39;d be able to take up the<br/>\nslack if one of the tanks had to back off.  The strength would help too, as<br/>\nI&#39;m always within 10-15 of my max limit, so I hardly loot anything.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; One issue that was raised on this Vox raid really popped a vein in my<br/>\n&gt; forehead.<br/>\n&gt; It was when it came around to randoming off the Runed Bolster Belt.<br/>\n&gt; This is an ac 5, +10 str, +10 dex, +10 sta belt with haste effect. The<br/>\n&gt; question was raised if bards were worthy of this item, given their melee<br/>\n&gt; abilities etc. The way I look at it is the way Verant designed us.. if I<br/>\n&gt; had my choice between that belt and any instrument in the game<br/>\n&gt; (Maestro&#39;s lute for example), I&#39;d glady choose the belt. Surely the item<br/>\n&gt; would be best in the hands of a monk, warrior, rogue, or ranger. But is<br/>\n&gt; a bard deserving of an item like that? What do you all think?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Maev Lorekeeper<br/>\n&gt; Tarew Marr </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
