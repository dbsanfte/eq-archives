But if you dont have a druid...

You are close to capping out at cha where it makes any<br/>\ndifference (100 seems to be the point where the returns are diminishing.)<br/>\nSilk evening tunic you can buy from gypsy vendors in south qeynos. Dont buy<br/>\na crude stien - go to Ogguuk and loot one for free.  Lots of dead bouncers<br/>\nthere and the high levels dont bother to loot the stiens.<br/>\n<br/>\nHarmony is by design different:  AOE, non-agro is resisted.

Maybe part of the problem is that I also<br/>\n&gt; play a druid and Harmony seems far superior to me, not<br/>\n&gt; only because it&#39;s AOE, but because it is resisted so<br/>\n&gt; seldom.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve heard from some bards that this is a great song,<br/>\n&gt; from others that it&#39;s useless.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My charisma is currently 91 and I&#39;m 14th lvl.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also, would someone have a better chance of using<br/>\n&gt; Lament holding a crude stein instead of a lute?  I<br/>\n&gt; have a line on one of these but since I can&#39;t hold one<br/>\n&gt; and use an instrument at the same time, don&#39;t want to<br/>\n&gt; spend the money if it won&#39;t work.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Tyunes of Rodcet Nife<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Talk to your friends online with Yahoo!
