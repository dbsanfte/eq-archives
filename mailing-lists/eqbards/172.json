I<br/>\nsuppose it&#39;s possible, but I haven&#39;t really noticed it.<br/>\n<br/>\nJuggling DOES cause a much higher incidence of &quot;missed notes&quot; though.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to the drum&#39;s usefulness, I don&#39;t know who would say that it is not<br/>\nuseful until level 7.  The level five song is amazing with the drum, as I&#39;m<br/>\nsure you all know.<br/>\n<br/>\nJyzan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKristian Leitzen wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Kristian Leitzen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kleit@...\">kleit@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; A moment brother Jyzan,<br/>\n&gt; you seem to be one of the most experienced of our brothers here, and i<br/>\n&gt; would like you expert opinion on something.  while juggling songs i<br/>\n&gt; have noticed that my hit percentage goes down.  yes i have tested it<br/>\n&gt; but have no exact numbers.  when i juggle i hit less frequently, when i<br/>\n&gt; sing one i hit more often.  maybe it is due to concentration needed on<br/>\n&gt; the character&#39;s part? any observations are welcome.  also some posts<br/>\n&gt; from yesterday mentioned that they didn&#39;t think the drum was usefull<br/>\n&gt; till level 7.  accelerando is level 5 and the drum is extremely<br/>\n&gt; beneficial to this song.  thank you for your time brother.<br/>\n&gt; Olczyk of Qeynos<br/>\n&gt; 8th level and loving it<br/>\n&gt; Tarew Marr<br/>\n&gt; _________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Get your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Did you know that knowledge is power?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Join a new ONElist e-mail community and strengthen your mind! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
