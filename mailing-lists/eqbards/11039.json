It took a whopping eighteen seconds for some Bard <br/>\nplaying Aria for him to realize that it was completely busted.  They <br/>\ncould not possibly have tested this.  I would be lined up against a wall <br/>\nand shot if I did this on my job.  This is not some subtle and intricate <br/>\nconsequence of some complicated piece of code buried in some hidden <br/>\nmodule somewhere.  They &quot;fixed&quot; levitation, they failed to test <br/>\nlevitation.  For Bards, of course.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe initial Selo&#39;s/SOW &quot;fix&quot; is another example.  I&#39;m quite sure they <br/>\ntested this for everyone who might be grouped with a Bard, but they did <br/>\nnot test it for the Bard himself.  And why did it take six months for <br/>\nthem to fix the level 22 song?  I can live with the thought that Bards <br/>\nmay not have an affirmative advocate inside Verant, but this suggests <br/>\nthat nobody at Verant even bothers to consider Bards when making changes, <br/>\nwhich bothers me.<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 34 songs, Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\nDave Gaines wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Dave Gaines &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dave@...\">dave@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The bard at Verant probably plays mana song all the time, even<br/>\n&gt; in combat :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sorry about the complaint in the previous message, but it is<br/>\n&gt; getting annoying to me how many people from every class in this game<br/>\n&gt; think that verant hates them their class more than the rest of the<br/>\n&gt; classes.
