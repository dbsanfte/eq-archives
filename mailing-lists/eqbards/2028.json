Ok, so I got up and walked <br/>\naround till that strange sound stopped.  Stamina started picking up.  Sat <br/>\ndown.  Stamina started dropping again.  Finally realized that it didn&#39;t <br/>\nmatter where I sat, sitting just plain drained my Stam.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople disappearing, yes.  Very strange.  Could just be graphics glitch?  I <br/>\nwas in a party with a friend and we were in group speak so can&#39;t comment on <br/>\n/say.  But it was a little disturbing to see your partner sitting there one <br/>\nsecond and then vanishing right before your eyes.  But because of opinion on <br/>\nthis and other lists, I refrained from singing on the boat at all.  Far be it <br/>\nfor me, little lowly 6.5 songstress, to be the cause of a boat crash!  LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nI am enjoying the sage and experienced words of our higher level brothers and <br/>\nsisters.  But where are the young ones such as myself?  The tales and <br/>\nadventures I read here are things I won&#39;t be seeing for some time to come.  <br/>\nAre there any others in the 5th to 10th season with advice and knowledge to <br/>\nshare as well?  Let&#39;s speak up and help each other with similar questions.  I <br/>\nhave questions as well which I will post later (time for work!).<br/>\n<br/>\nCalliope of Freeport<br/>\n6th Season Half Elf Bard</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
