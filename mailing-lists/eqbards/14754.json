So, if (or more like when) you get more than one<br/>\n&gt;mob, you will be doing Pixie strike.  If you have an enchanter, you will not<br/>\n&gt;want to use AE and break the mobs out of their messed states (ok, Largos<br/>\n&gt;does not break enchanter mez so that is one option.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;In lower Guk, I&#39;d think you would want to buff your tanks: chant and<br/>\n&gt;celerity or anthem and elemental if you are fighting casters. If you are in<br/>\n&gt;a situation with multiple mobs and no crowd control, that is a problem.
