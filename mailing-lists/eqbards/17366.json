Our guild leader was trying to<br/>\nmake my wizard an officer in the guild and could not.  Does anyone know why<br/>\nthis might have occurred?  I was in the same zone as him and already a<br/>\nmember.  My bard is also an officer in the guild, but we have at least one<br/>\nother member who has two officers in the guild on the same account.  Has<br/>\nanyone else encountered this problem?  I tried zoning, camping, etc. all to<br/>\nno avail.  No matter what we tried he could not make me an officer.  He was<br/>\nable to make other people officers after trying on me however.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
