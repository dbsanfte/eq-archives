GZ has stated song should have 35% resist rate, but<br/>\nactual numbers are twice this (from what bards believe, bad coding in<br/>\nsecondary resist). VI has stated that song was tested and is working as<br/>\nintended, but offers no proof of testing or what was actually tested.<br/>\nWithout this song, the only form of bard &quot;crowd control&quot; is charming or<br/>\nsingle target mezzing (not that it works either).

Though anecdotes on the next report resist rates in excess of<br/>\n80% even with a level 60 bard versus a level 1 snake, we&#39;ve found that to be<br/>\nincorrect.

Song used to stop mobs in their tracks at 50% health,<br/>\nsince patch does not stop mob until down to 20%. Song also overrides higher<br/>\nlevel snares of other classes. UPDATE: VI has decided that song was too<br/>\npowerful after 18 months as-is with no documented complaints. Consensus on<br/>\nbard bulletin boards is that VI does not want to spend time to fix song and<br/>\nhas instead opted for a cop-out nerf. Song has random 0-9 second duration, 3<br/>\nsecond casting time, and higher resists than snare/root. If song is left<br/>\nas-is, bards want a full 9 second chain to make up for reduced strength &<br/>\nhigh resists, now it is just weak AND unpredictable. <br/>\n<br/>\n[Wrinn, Gordon] -- Works as intended.

Working on<br/>\n </span></blockquote>being fixed.<br/>\nLet&#39;s not start on the whole Hide/Sneak issue.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;* Chords of Dissonance (2)/Disruptive Discord (10)  - no animation when<br/>\n </span></blockquote>playing song and no mobs in<br/>\nrange. Very dangerous with AE damage song. <br/>\n<br/>\n[Wrinn, Gordon] -- This is how these spells work.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;My question to that wouold be &quot;Why is that intended?&quot;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Who knows and obviously no one at VI cares.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;* Selo&#39;s no longer breaks root on PvP servers. Since release, if a bard<br/>\n </span></blockquote>had<br/>\nselo&#39;s song up and was rooted by a player/mob, the next pulse of speed song<br/>\nwould break the root (if song was not up prior to root, song would not break<br/>\nit). A recent unannounced patch eliminated this ability resulting in many<br/>\nPvP bard&#39;s deaths. Bard&#39;s are mostly upset because there are so many<br/>\nlegitimate, long-standing problems with the class and these are types of<br/>\nthings being worked on. <br/>\n<br/>\n[Wrinn, Gordon] -- The fact that it ever broke root was a bug. While I<br/>\nunderstand the desire for us to fix &quot;long standing problems&quot; before working<br/>\non issues of this nature, this turned out to be a quick fix that was very<br/>\neasily addressed. We could leave stuff like this in while doing all of the<br/>\nother fixes, however we&#39;d then have to deal with complaints that &quot;It&#39;s<br/>\nalways been like this&quot; and &quot;why didn&#39;t we fix it sooner&quot;. It&#39;s a bit of a<br/>\ndouble-edged sword.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I can remember brad himself saying it WAS supposed to at one point, and<br/>\n </span></blockquote>also saying it <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;WASN&#39;T at another point.  Personally, I don&#39;t think anyone at VI really<br/>\n </span></blockquote>knows for &gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;sure.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Obviously they don&#39;t cause it still breaks root on the Live non-PvP servers.<br/>\nIf you get rooted while Selo&#39;s is up it breaks it, you still have the icon<br/>\nand can move.  You just cannot start the song while Rooted.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;* Lock picking. Bards get skill at level 40. Skill is capped so low that<br/>\n </span></blockquote>bards can only open doors in Befallen and gate to the Hole. Raising skill<br/>\nwould be nice to open Kunark doors - why is a level 40 bard opening doors in<br/>\nnewbie dungeon? (check bard count at primetime hours, and you&#39;ll be lucky to<br/>\nsee more than 12 45+ bards on any server). <br/>\n<br/>\n[Wrinn, Gordon] -- Bard lock-picking is supposed to have limited usefulness.<br/>\nAt the moment there are very few locked doors in mid-level dungeons that<br/>\nwould be appropriate targets for Bard lock-picking. Perhaps at some point it<br/>\nmight be appropriate for a newer zone.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Newer zone?  Like SoV or The Warrens?  Hmmmmm...<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Since those are going to be more high level zones, why would they cap the<br/>\nskil lower on those locks???<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;* Disarm Traps. Ok, no traps to disarm. Rogues got new skills (backstab &<br/>\n </span></blockquote>evade) to make up for this, bards were promised it would be looked into as<br/>\nwell, but never got anything. <br/>\n<br/>\n[Wrinn, Gordon] -- Creation of bard songs and other enhancements that have<br/>\nbeen made took into account that this skill is not useful in its current<br/>\nform.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Again, &quot;What songs/enhacnements?&quot;<br/>\n&gt;(btw, Evade came from the high taunt factor of Backstab, and Backstab has<br/>\n </span></blockquote>always been <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;a Rogue skill)<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You know all those new songs we were promised at release but did not get<br/>\nuntil later.  In other words, more total BS.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;* Skill caps on singing, percussion, string, brass, and wind still at 200<br/>\n </span></blockquote>for bards over level 50. Other casting classes have casting skills up to<br/>\n250. <br/>\n<br/>\n[Wrinn, Gordon] - Other casting classes don&#39;t go up to 250, but I&#39;m not<br/>\nopposed to increasing the instrument caps to reduce failures. We&#39;ll put it<br/>\nin the next patch.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Anyone else here remember hearing that song/instrument skills would *NEVER*<br/>\n </span></blockquote>be &gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;increased?  *wide grin*<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yeah, but at the same time they said magical skills would never increase and<br/>\nranger defensive skills would never increase.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;* Dodge/Parry. Bards get skills at 53 and 58 respectively. Way too high<br/>\n </span></blockquote>for<br/>\nmost players to ever see them and excessively high compared to other classes<br/>\nthat get these skills in 20s and 30s. Both parry & riposte capped at 70.<br/>\nBelow is summary of all melee/hybrid combat skills to put this into<br/>\nperspective:<br/>\n<br/>\n[Wrinn, Gordon] - I understand the point, but the skills were not meant to<br/>\nbe a large balance component to the class, but rather a reward for making it<br/>\nthat high in level. Decreasing the level of acquisition or increasing the<br/>\ncaps wouldn&#39;t be appropriate.&lt;&lt;&lt;   <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Ahh, but any skill that isn&#39;t high enough to be useful isn&#39;t really a skill<br/>\n </span></blockquote>is it?   <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Another item to bring up later (I think in time that will go the same way<br/>\n </span></blockquote>as the &gt;instrument skill caps)<br/>\n<br/>\nPoint well made and was mine as well.  At the level and cap we get them they<br/>\nare useless.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;* Still missing 49 song- thanks for asking for our input Abashi. Lots of<br/>\n </span></blockquote>good suggestions out there. <br/>\n<br/>\n[Wrinn, Gordon] -- No 49th level song is planned at this time.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;No excuse for that.  Just plain laziness.  Get your nose out of Lucas&#39;s<br/>\n </span></blockquote>back-side and <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;finsish this game FIRST ;p<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It brings no revenue and isn&#39;t Yak&#39;s area so it won&#39;t get done.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;* Could musical instruments (when viewed) contain information on which<br/>\n </span></blockquote>skill<br/>\nthey are for? Percussion/String/Wind/Brass. Not always obvious on wind/brass<br/>\ninstruments. Also, would be fantastic to see something like &quot;+10% to some<br/>\nbrass&quot; or &quot;+5% to combat wind&quot;. Often, only very high level bards can<br/>\nbaseline instrument improvements today (hard to see 5% improvement if song<br/>\nonly adds 5 strength). <br/>\n<br/>\n[Wrinn, Gordon] - I suppose we can compromise here. We&#39;ll have the skill<br/>\nused displayed on the item tag following the next client-patch, but won&#39;t<br/>\nlist the direct modifiers.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;As with the skill caps on instruments, I remember him saying that that<br/>\n </span></blockquote>would *NEVER* <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;be implemented.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Nah, they just said they would never display the bonus info.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;* Denon&#39;s Desperate Dirge (43) - 800 mana for AE 275 damage.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Breeze/Clarity/Mana song have no effect on bards mana regen (takes 30+<br/>\nminutes to recharge when OOM), making this song the absolute worst in terms<br/>\nof damage/downtime. With 39 charm song now using mana, bards never use this<br/>\nsong. Abashi started a thread asking for input and consensus was: allow song<br/>\nto be memmed, sung immediately (at no mana cost), and then have a 15-minute<br/>\neffect on player where song could not be sung again. Let&#39;s face it, 800 mana<br/>\nis 80-90% of a bards mana and doesn&#39;t leave much for charming. 275 damage on<br/>\na level 43 mob is less than one half of one bub of hp. <br/>\n* Mana on 39 charm song. Biggest problem is that after a rez, a bard has no<br/>\nmana, and often takes almost an hour to get back to FM. The ability for a<br/>\nbard to charm should be dependent on this. <br/>\n<br/>\n[Wrinn, Gordon] -- This is as designed. Bards are not supposed to get any<br/>\nbenefit from +mana songs. Using one of their two mana-using songs is<br/>\nsupposed to have a large cost. It is the drawback for having powerful<br/>\nsongs.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;At the higher levels, this song isn&#39;t really &quot;powerful&quot;.  I feel that this<br/>\n </span></blockquote>too will be <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;re-addressed in time.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>sadly, I&#39;d say dream on.  this will likely never change.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;* Instrument pieces.
