Sniderman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fuzzbone@...\">fuzzbone@...</a>]<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; While the following is a spoiler - it describes travel to and from Kunark.<br/>\n&gt; I &quot;wasted&quot; a good four hours of time so unless you consider<br/>\n&gt; waiting for and<br/>\n&gt; on boats for long periods of time a vital part of the role-playing<br/>\n&gt; experience - I would suggest you read on.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; OBLIGATORY SPOILER SPACE<br/>\n&gt; *<br/>\n&gt; *<br/>\n&gt; *<br/>\n&gt; *<br/>\n&gt; *<br/>\n&gt; *<br/>\n&gt; *<br/>\n&gt; *<br/>\n&gt; *<br/>\n&gt; *<br/>\n&gt; *<br/>\n&gt; *<br/>\n&gt; *<br/>\n&gt; *<br/>\n&gt; *<br/>\n&gt; *<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; We spent an hour or so (including several dumps) trying to figure<br/>\n&gt; out how my<br/>\n&gt; Guild&#39;s group could get to me without luck.  Arkin died once...  Then we<br/>\n&gt; decided the only way to hook up would be for me to travel back to<br/>\n&gt; Butcherblock and get a TP from Druid Circle.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This zone is HUGE.  To get from the wizzy spires to the zone to the High Elf<br/>\nencampment seemed to be about the equivalent of running from Qeynos to<br/>\nFreeport (ok maybe a bit exagerated but at least to Highpass)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe wandered for 4 hours before we found our way to the city zone.  Then the<br/>\ncity took a bit to find as well, very cool to feel like a newbie again!<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, to get from the wizzy spires/druid rings to town, I think you have to<br/>\ngo through the ice caves so you&#39;ll have to find a hole in a mountain to get<br/>\nto the proper part of the zone.<br/>\n<br/>\nVery long trip but very fun, baddies all over the place, over half of them<br/>\nsee Invis.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the level 51 travel song gave me a reason to unmem selo&#39;s in an outdoor<br/>\nzone for the first time ever.
