Now I&#39;m happily wield the Yk in the<br/>\nprimary and the Kisch in the offhand.  Big difference from my old claws and<br/>\nsilvery war axe.  Think the Yk camp is bad?  The Tesch Val Dval&#39;Nmak that<br/>\ndrops the Kisch is a 2 hour spawn and his rare is the sword and he really<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t have a common although he occasionally drops a crummy gold ring.<br/>\nI&#39;ve been killing him twice to three times a night for almost 2 weeks.  We<br/>\ngot the comando raid down to a science to get in there, kill him and get<br/>\nback out.  Great to have guild members that will drop what they are doing to<br/>\ndo a comando raid :-).   Last monday he dropped a FS long sword instead of<br/>\nthe Kisch.  Imagine my disappointment at that!<br/>\n<br/>\nTaneran Dreamweaver<br/>\nHappy Bard of the 41st song<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Mike Roach &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Mike.Roach@...\">Mike.Roach@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, March 06, 2000 8:29 AM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Camp from hell...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Mike Roach &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Mike.Roach@...\">Mike.Roach@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; How in the world to people obtain Ykeshas these days?  I heard they used<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; drop a lot more often but this is absurd.  Yesterday I logged on at 11am<br/>\nCST<br/>\n&gt; in lguk and joined a Savant group, sent a tell to the list holder of the<br/>\n&gt; Lord group and started killing frogs.  I was finally called for my turn in<br/>\n&gt; the Lord group at 6pm CST, 7 hours later.  Shortly after I arrived one of<br/>\n&gt; the people ahead of me on the list fell asleep after an 18 hour camp and<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; guy after him got a Yak.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The group changed a couple times in the next hour so by 8pm I was on the<br/>\ntop<br/>\n&gt; of the list for a Yak, 2 hours after joining the group.  We then camped<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; room and I finally gave up with no Yak (5 SSB&#39;s) at 2:30am, 7 and a half<br/>\n&gt; hours and no Yak.  By the time I left I was the only original group member<br/>\n&gt; left.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Meanwhile people continue to berate me for wielding a staff of writhing at<br/>\n&gt; 42nd level.  What&#39;s a bard to do, has it always been this tough of a camp?<br/>\n&gt; This is totally absurd.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -Faras<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; MAXIMIZE YOUR CARD, MINIMIZE YOUR RATE!<br/>\n&gt; Get a NextCard Visa, in 30 seconds!
