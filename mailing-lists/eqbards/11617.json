I conned everything along the way and everything was indifferent.<br/>\nNext time I walked thru I assumed I was safe and didn&#39;t con any lizards as I<br/>\nmoved.  I walked by a lizard in the maze and got attacked.  The best<br/>\nexplanation I have to why it saw thru the invis was that the lizard had the<br/>\nsee invis spell buff.  I don&#39;t know if lizard spellcasters can actually cast<br/>\nthis spell but if they can that would easily explain it.  If they can&#39;t cast<br/>\nsee invis then I have no idea what happened.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I have a theory about Sonorous Coulding failing. It has failed for me a<br/>\n&gt; few times (although I have NEVER been attacked my any lizard in CT :). I<br/>\n&gt; noticed (and posted) my success in Unrest a few days ago. My only<br/>\n&gt; failure was when a mob spawned right near me and immediately attacked.<br/>\n&gt; Then today I read a post from someone who was in CT and looking at the<br/>\n&gt; spawns in the Throne Room, they stated that 2 mobs walked in OR spawned<br/>\n&gt; and saw thru their invis.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I know certain mobs can see invis, and that invis can fail, but neither<br/>\n&gt; I nor the poster got &quot;you feel yourself starting to appear&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It appears that sonorous clouding works on mobs that are in the zone<br/>\n&gt; when it pulses, but mobs who spawn and have not had a &quot;dose&quot; (pulse) of<br/>\n&gt; it can see thru it. Just ancedotal evidence so far, if anyone can add to<br/>\n&gt; this, please do so.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
