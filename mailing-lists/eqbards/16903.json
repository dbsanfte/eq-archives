I&#39;m in trouble!  Time to go all out!<br/>\n{Bard AE nukes mobs for 325}<br/>\n{40th level mobs laugh at the bard&#39;s best attempt only causing a minor<br/>\nscratch as they pound on the real damage dealers.}<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best taunt for me has been twisting the three Chant lines, even if they<br/>\ndon&#39;t stick.  I could get ogre bouncers to glue onto me by the time they<br/>\nwere at 75% health -- I&#39;d run around in circles while my druid brother nuked<br/>\nthe snot out of them.  The Chants may have stuck about 10% of the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne other argument for Screech over Dirge is that Dirge is limited to 4<br/>\nmobs, so if you get a gross train (don&#39;t think they exist these days),<br/>\nyou&#39;ll have a problem.  Caveat: all of my experience has been on a live<br/>\nserver, where populations have gone from comfortable to atrocious, so I&#39;ve<br/>\nnever had the luxury of an undercrowded dungeon.<br/>\n<br/>\nRaiel</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
