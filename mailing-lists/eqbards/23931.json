The group ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1236961482\">Ya know its kinda funny, this morning i got a pickup group in karnors, some<br/>\ni&#39;ve grouped with multiple times in the past (well one anyways). The group<br/>\nconsisted of 2 warriors, a monk, a rogue, a druid and me.  Not once did the<br/>\ndruid get under 70-80 mana and I only played mana on downtime.  I was doing<br/>\nan all instrument go at it. Doing berserker (for 3 more bubbles) and nivs<br/>\nand hymn of restoration (to save the druid some mana).  The druid was pretty<br/>\nmuch doing only group dmg shield, group sow, group chloro, sln, maybe 1 or 2<br/>\nheals max per pull.  Was a very fun group, everyone was pleasant/joking<br/>\naround.  They were also very happy with my song selections as well.  We<br/>\neventually lost our monk but got another druid, they nuked a bit and also<br/>\nthey shared the heals (which btw they love the new patch) and I would still<br/>\ndo the same songs.  We had a few bad pulls with 4 coming in which we kept<br/>\nunder control very quickly.  Only one druid ran low on mana after one of<br/>\nthese.  The grouped loved it, with the druid&#39;s dmg shield and my new ss<br/>\nbracer dmg shield (woot!) we had free 29dmg every mob hit and i was<br/>\nregenning 40hp+chloro so the mobs were dropping fast and the mana was<br/>\nkeeping full.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways, not once did this group dare/dream of telling me what to do and we<br/>\neven talked about how people always tell bards what to play. Some of them<br/>\nhad alt bards (dont they all hehe) and they loved me (i think i got a<br/>\nmarriage proposel from a halfling). Anyways, it was rather refreshing group<br/>\nto not once hear &quot;play mana song&quot; in a couple hours especially with a non<br/>\ncleric healer.<br/>\n<br/>\nMinkin, 49 bard<br/>\nRIP<br/>\nAyonae Ro<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. I wish there&#39;d be a halfling illusion mask out there<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Cranfill, Wendy [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Wendy_Cranfill@...\">Wendy_Cranfill@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: February 21, 2001 5:03 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] &quot;Shouldn&#39;t you be playing Manasong!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI totally agree :)  I&#39;m pretty amiable as long as I don&#39;t get my little<br/>\nrebellious instincts all stirred up :)<br/>\nAmazing what a &quot;please&quot; can do!<br/>\n<br/>\nHalana/Tani<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Ultimately  the real issue is people&#39;s attitudes.

However if you ask me - nicely - it&#39;s a <br/>\n&gt; different<br/>\n&gt; thing entirely.  When I hear &quot;Play manasong please&quot; - <br/>\n&gt; particularly from a<br/>\n&gt; cleric or enchanter - odds are - I&#39;ll include in my song <br/>\n&gt; twist - even if I<br/>\n&gt; feel that it&#39;s less than ideal.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Slyde<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
