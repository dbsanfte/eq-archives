And the bind thread should IMO<br/>\n&gt;&gt; go the same way, but first I would like to<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If you have an opinion on it, which you do - then it doesn&#39;t need to be<br/>\n&gt;&quot;kabonged&quot; after you get your opinion noted. Everyone should be free to<br/>\n&gt;speak on the issue.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; If there wasent a penalty like this the game would<br/>\n&gt;&gt; turn into something very boring.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;And boy oh boy it&#39;s such exciting fun running back to<br/>\n&gt;your corpse. Yay!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; With selo&#39;s we are pretty well off for travelling and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; giving bards bind will seriusly overpower unless it was<br/>\n&gt;&gt; made useless by giving it penalties.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Selo&#39;s gives us a good way of GETTING somewhere. It<br/>\n&gt;doesn&#39;t even come close to comparing to gate.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;d be interested in seeing the results of a caster<br/>\n&gt;and a bard racing from Freeport to Qeynos and back.<br/>\n&gt;I can see it now. Caster pays 1pp for SOW and nearly<br/>\n&gt;keeps up with bard. Bard arrives in Qeynos let&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;be generous and say 10 minutes before wizard does.<br/>\n&gt;Bard heads back and gleefully waves at wizard still<br/>\n&gt;on his way to Qeynos. Wizard gets to Qeynos. Wizard<br/>\n&gt;gates back to Freeport and laughs it up for 45 minutes<br/>\n&gt;while the bard is still running.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Or better yet, high level bard & high level wizard in<br/>\n&gt;the same race. Bard takes off a runnin&#39;.. Wizard does<br/>\n&gt;his fancy teleport to the Karana&#39;s. Runs rest of way<br/>\n&gt;to Qeynos. Gates back to Freeport. Bard arrives in West<br/>\n&gt;Commons on his way to Qeynos.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Yeah, Selo&#39;s makes up for all of that.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
