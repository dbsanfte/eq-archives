I&#39;ve got a 175<br/>\nand succeed about 80% on morningstars and about 50% on rapiers. I&#39;ve<br/>\ntried daggers and you would think in 4 attempts at least one success..<br/>\nNote: I have done maybe 20 attempts and had 0 increases but my int is<br/>\nonly 85 and my str 124 with Chant.<br/>\n<br/>\nEr, rapiers? They&#39;re bad mammajammas but I cruised all over the old<br/>\nworld, hitting the low-mid level zones, and nobody wanted one. I was<br/>\ntrying to sell them for 200. That is not a bad price since they average<br/>\nat 10 damage per minute below an EBW mid 30 but have +stats and 200<br/>\n1/15 the cost. I eventually gave one away for 55p + a screaming mace<br/>\nbecause I wanted to clear out inventory (the mace will sell quickly).<br/>\nIn general tho I&#39;ll sell everything for 200, was selling morningstars<br/>\nfor 300 and they went but I felt dirty.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d be up for taking custom orders if it weren&#39;t such a pain getting<br/>\nimbued emeralds/plains pebbles and morning dew. That and hanging out in<br/>\nGFay really puts a dent in my ever-slow leveling. I need to get some<br/>\nmore emeralds/dew for some backordered morningstars but if 200p in<br/>\ncash/goods/services sounds ok then have your friend shoot me a tell. If<br/>\nit&#39;s not I&#39;m sure something can be arranged.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers, Jeers and Beers,<br/>\n<br/>\nNinev<br/>\n<br/>\n--- &quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dean_kimes@...\">dean_kimes@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hey Ninev, I noticed the fier&#39;dal weapons use regular mithril sheets.<br/>\n&gt;  Is<br/>\n&gt; this true even for the Imbued Weapons?
