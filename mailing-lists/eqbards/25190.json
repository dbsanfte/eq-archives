Note to non-Xegony Bards - Xegony prices tend to<br/>\nrun on the high side...<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m probably into gear less than a lot of people - and the drum seems only<br/>\nto be marginally better than my current Nestrolo Tambourine - so I it&#39;s not<br/>\nworth it to me to tap myself out (on the one hand) - but I would like to<br/>\nfairly compensate my friend if I take her up on the deal.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s done some preliminary asking around the server and got a range of<br/>\n9-20K.  The high end sounds ridiculous to me - I can&#39;t imagine paying 20K<br/>\nfor a Selo&#39;s Drum which is a lot better (however I think there is a lot of<br/>\nconfusion between the Walrus Skin drum and the Drum of the Beast - ie people<br/>\nthink the Walrus Skin drum is better than Selo&#39;s) And it&#39;s probably very<br/>\nrare at the moment since prior to the last patch - basically no one hunted<br/>\nin SG.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway - I wondering what you Xegony folks think a fair (normal<br/>\nnon-discounted) price range would be for this item.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
