Between <br/>\n&gt; the 45 AGI debuff<br/>\n&gt; and the AC debuff, I dropped my AC by 62 points when I <br/>\n&gt; managed to stick this<br/>\n&gt; on myself.  My only concern in using this would be if the attack speed<br/>\n&gt; component overwrote that of a shammie or enchanter (assuming <br/>\n&gt; they cast their<br/>\n&gt; spell first).  Has anyone had a chance to test this yet?  (I <br/>\n&gt; imagine no<br/>\n&gt; one -- including myself -- is in too much of a &quot;testing&quot; <br/>\n&gt; mentality right<br/>\n&gt; now, with so much new territory to explore, heh.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Raiel </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
