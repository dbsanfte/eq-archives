It was really<br/>\ncool to see all of you guys there....I got to meet a few that I have<br/>\nseen posting regular notes on the list and felt very priveledged. <br/>\n*waves at Sylly*.  Thanks for letting me be a part of it.  Things went<br/>\nvery well...3 hours and most of the little gnomes were in the lava...I<br/>\nwas the poor druid trying to port all the little guys...my thank you to<br/>\nthe kind soul who cast clarity on me so that this was possible.  Thanks<br/>\nto Aloro for arranging it.  It was alot of fun...and you know that on<br/>\nour server they were all referring to it as gnomespam 99.  I loved<br/>\ngoing back and looking at all the dead gnome bodies later...heheh<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks all!<br/>\n<br/>\nCrysarra &lt;Core Alliance&gt;<br/>\ndruid 33rd season<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Ken Bachman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbachman@...\">kbachman@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I just wanted to note that I had a lot of (admittedly ridiculous) fun<br/>\n&gt; at <br/>\n&gt; this event.  It&#39;s tough to describe for those of you who missed it,<br/>\n&gt; but <br/>\n&gt; try and picture 60 drunken Gnomes outside the Freeport gates, waving <br/>\n&gt; lutes and charging en masse to Lavastorm.  And boy, did we annoy the<br/>\n&gt; Dark <br/>\n&gt; Elves in Nektulos!  (Did you ever notice that Dark Elves have no<br/>\n&gt; sense of <br/>\n&gt; humor?)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I actually managed to make it to the Temple of Solusek Ro ledge,<br/>\n&gt; where I <br/>\n&gt; was able to fling myself into the lava along with perhaps twenty<br/>\n&gt; others <br/>\n&gt; that I saw up there.  There was, sadly, a fair amount of attrition<br/>\n&gt; along <br/>\n&gt; the way (not unexpected).  I tried to get back two more times, but<br/>\n&gt; kept <br/>\n&gt; getting chomped by piranhas in the Nektulos river.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My roommate, who generally raises an eyebrow at this game, watched<br/>\n&gt; most <br/>\n&gt; of it and found it hilarious.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I wanted to thank Aloro, et al, for organizing this, and the E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; higher <br/>\n&gt; level players who spent several hours helping all of us idiots with <br/>\n&gt; teleports, binding, SOW, beer and lutes.  I&#39;d appreciate it if you<br/>\n&gt; E&#39;ci <br/>\n&gt; bards could pass on my thanks.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kenross Cantoforjado, 34 songs, Innoruuk<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;HR&gt;<br/>\n&lt;html&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nThousands of Stores.
