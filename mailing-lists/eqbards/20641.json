We just stood there and everything ran to us -<br/>\nwell me.  Every mob came at me :) but then I could not blame them I am just<br/>\nso cute.  Ummm anyways... My group started to yell for me to log so I did.<br/>\nMe alone.  And guess what happened?  The mobs still came and they started to<br/>\nbeat on the cleric instead.  *LOL* He screams like a girl - ON ME ON ME.<br/>\nDon&#39;t think he&#39;s ever going to ask me to log again...<br/>\n<br/>\nJacana Mourningsong<br/>\nWood Elf of the 29th song (Woohoo level last night)<br/>\n&lt;Crimson Dragons&gt; Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
