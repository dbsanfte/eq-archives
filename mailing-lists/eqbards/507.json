Paladins have the Flaming Two-Handed Sword<br/>\nand 4 or 5 others, Shadowknights the same, of course all the casters have<br/>\nspecial items as well that boost mana or other things.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBut we bards have no BARD-SPECIFIC or even bard-flavored items<br/>\nthat I know of.  Wouldn&#39;t it be nice to have a special drum that gave<br/>\nmaybe a 10% boost to the Accelerando?  Or perhaps a fabled mandolin that<br/>\ncould instead of merely boosting the healing song, also remove disease or<br/>\npoison or any adverse effects?  Heck, a weapon that acted as an instrument<br/>\nwould be great, as well.  Bone bladed lute?  Well, maybe scratch that one,<br/>\neh?<br/>\n<br/>\nLater all, may your songs lift to the stars!<br/>\n<br/>\nPistov.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t ___________________________________________________________<br/>\n\t|\t\t\t\t      \t\t\t    |<br/>\n\t|  Tyger, Tyger, burning bright\t       \t\t            |<br/>\n\t|  In the forests of the night,\t       Marc Allie\t    |<br/>\n\t|  What immortal hand or eye\t       \t\t\t    |<br/>\n\t|  Could frame thy fearful symmetry?   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mallie@...\">mallie@...</a>   |<br/>\n\t|\t\t\t\t      \t\t\t    |<br/>\n\t|           -William Blake-\t       \t\t\t    |<br/>\n\t|___________________________________________________________|</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
