The spread in the group also seems<br/>\nto have something to do with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember being level 13 in unrest - and making terrific experience with a<br/>\ngroup of 20&#39;s.  Being a bard - I didn&#39;t have to lay a finger on them to be<br/>\nof benefit to the group - which is good, cause I can never hit anything red<br/>\nto me anyway. As I remember, Anthem and Selo&#39;s was my major contributions<br/>\nthat trip. Folks I was with were certainly glad for the Selo&#39;s on more than<br/>\none occassion, as well as the puller who seemed to have a nasty habit of<br/>\ngetting rooted by ghouls in the house.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe that after 10 - and the higher you get in levels, the less<br/>\ndifference that makes.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople think twinking of items is bad - this practice is to keep the same<br/>\nthing from happening with experience.  Imagine a group of 30&#39;s or 40&#39;s with<br/>\na lvl 1 in the group (presuming they could keep him alive which is<br/>\ndoubtful). At those levels - every monster would give the low level a level<br/>\nor more. I know at 13, just what the 20&#39;s were killing seemed a quarter, or<br/>\nhalf bubble to me each.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, like twinking items - this might seem like a shortcut - but can<br/>\nyou imagine being lvl 10, with only 15 or 20 in a weapon skill? Folks that<br/>\nrush experience at the expense of their skills all wind up regretting it<br/>\nsooner or later.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 10:08 AM 8/3/99 -0600, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Blair, Keith (Keith Blair)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kblair@...\">kblair@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; My first night as level 20 and I went<br/>\n&gt;&gt; to HighHold Keep.

I remember when I was level 5 and my friend was<br/>\n&gt;level 9 and trying to help me out, I stopped getting experience when we were<br/>\n&gt;grouped because he was 4 levels above me. I&#39;ve heard that even when the<br/>\n&gt;levels are closer, the people with the higher levels get more experience<br/>\n&gt;than the lower levels regardless of who does the most damage. Of course if<br/>\n&gt;you were just there for the fun, it wouldn&#39;t matter - but I was just curious<br/>\n&gt;if you got any experience from it. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
