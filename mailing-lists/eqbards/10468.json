I therefore would like to entreat the EQ bardic community <br/>\nto join ranks and set out to do something truly silly and pointless <br/>\ntogether.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt this point, I am sure you are thinking, &quot;What can we do together, Aloro, <br/>\nthat would be silly and pointless and FUN?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou ARE thinking that, aren&#39;t you?<br/>\n<br/>\nGood! So here is my proposal:<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat: Gnomestock &#39;99<br/>\nWhen: Friday, November 26th, starting at noon PST (or another time if the <br/>\ncommunity prefers...)<br/>\nWho: Anyone who plays a bard on EQ, or any of their friends, family, or <br/>\npets.<br/>\nWhere: E&#39;ci, starting in Ak&#39;Anon, we shall make a glorious lemming-like run <br/>\nto Lavastorm, there to practice cliff-diving ito lava. We&#39;ll need to get <br/>\nbound in Freeport so wave after wave of gnomes can hurl themselves into <br/>\nfiery doom.<br/>\nHow: Create a first level gnome character. We should all have names that are <br/>\nsomehow similar... one idea would be that all our names start with Gn, so <br/>\nthe puzzled PCs who watch wave after wave of gnomes run by will see the <br/>\nconnection. If we all have similar names it will make it easier to find each <br/>\nother too... it might be advisable to try to make a gnomish equivalent of <br/>\nyour bardic name (thus e.g. I could make a gnome named Gnaloro). I suppose <br/>\nit might even be possible to form a guild for this event (Gnomestock would <br/>\nbe a good one... I don&#39;t really know how hard it is to start a new guild or <br/>\nhow long it takes, but it would be nice to have guildchat, and the guild <br/>\nname would be priceless).<br/>\nWhy: Because we like you!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d love to see something like this come together. let me know if it sounds <br/>\nlike a good idea and if you want to participate... if there&#39;s enough support <br/>\nthis could be hilarious. We can make some marching<br/>\nsongs, and maybe sing cadences as we run...<br/>\n<br/>\nAloro Silvertongue (E&#39;ci)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
