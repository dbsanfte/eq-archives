You got other girl friends on the side ? No credit here ?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Seriously, While I am not in favor of a Bards only Guild for a number<br/>\nof previously discussed reasons. I think as we get to higher levels we<br/>\nwould benefit from some form of loose, grouping association. I read an<br/>\nappeal to sever specific Bards from Eci&#39; here. We are lucky because we<br/>\nhave our own site at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cazic-thule.com/\">http://www.cazic-thule.com/</a> and when I just went<br/>\nover there and did a search &quot;in the past year&quot; on topics in the &quot;Bard<br/>\nClass&quot; forum I only found 10. I will start checking that forum on a<br/>\nregular basis. I would love to know who has been good to bards and who<br/>\nto avoid, Over the back fence gossip too &lt;snicker&gt; &lt;giggle&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\n Sineras Silverlyre, The Divine Alliance (Cazic-Thule)<br/>\n Fflewduer<br/>\n Chinchih<br/>\n<br/>\nHope to see you guys posting there too.<br/>\n<br/>\n Moonflower Bllue, 32nd Bard<br/>\n Cazic-thule</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
