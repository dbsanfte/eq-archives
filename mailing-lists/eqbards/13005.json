As you can tell by my<br/>\nreally long and less-than-complete writeup, there&#39;s a lot of<br/>\nbugs in this zone and a lot to learn before you can play in it<br/>\nsafely.  Best bet is to join a group that&#39;s already<br/>\nestablished themselves somewhere in the castle (which is<br/>\nunlikely since they&#39;ll tell you to come to the music room,<br/>\nyou&#39;ll say &quot;where&#39;s that?&quot;, and they&#39;ll withdraw their<br/>\ninvite).  So you&#39;ll probably end up joining a group not<br/>\nplaying in the castle, or planning to break in.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re joining a group not playing in the castle, best<br/>\nplace to get a lute is in the pit/courtyard (area at the<br/>\nbottom of the ramp just before the castle).  Make sure you<br/>\nfight towards the back, far far away from the ramp.  You&#39;ll be<br/>\nable to see any trains that run down the ramp.  Scout them out<br/>\nwhile invis to see if any of the gypsies are carrying lutes.  <br/>\nOften you can pull the returning trains 1-3 mobs at a<br/>\ntime.  The disadvantage of this is that you aren&#39;t killing<br/>\ngypsies to force them to respawn.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re planning to break in, well good luck to you.  :)  <br/>\nRead my other message for tips on getting inside.  The music<br/>\nroom has been so far in my experience the toughest one to<br/>\ncrack without a high level player pulling.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And what songs should I be using there?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No area effect songs until you learn the zone.  There are<br/>\nseveral places where you can use them, but there are lots more<br/>\nplaces where using them will get you killed before you can<br/>\nblink.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
