Last night I went up to Hate for the first time in months <br/>\n(took a break).  Coincidentally, this was the first time for our <br/>\nalliance since the upgrade.  I had read a little about the new boss <br/>\nmobs that now drop the old Innoruuk loot and noticed a Mistress of <br/>\nScorn on track.  Track by the way was jam packed due to so many new <br/>\nmobs.  Anyway, she was one of the first boss mobs that we took down <br/>\nand she dropped Dawnchaser, Imbrued Gloves, and Imbrued Boots.  With <br/>\nthe mistress in the mix, bard drops were excellent compaired to <br/>\nprevious trips.  On top of those three items, Imbrued helm, Martune <br/>\nRapier, and Six Note Blade all dropped.  Bringing the total that I <br/>\nsaw up to 6 drops instead of the usual 1-3 that I would see <br/>\npreviously.  There were also 2 scorns left on track when I camped, so <br/>\nI don&#39;t know what else may have dropped.  But for those of you that <br/>\nhaven&#39;t gotten all of your Hate gear, this upgrade makes things a lot <br/>\neasier!  I got 4 things that I needed and an extra set of gloves last <br/>\nnight!  Let the Martune rot, I hate those things :p<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and one more spoiler about the second floor.... we got agro&#39;d on <br/>\nthe second floor a lot.  The nice thing is that the mobs won&#39;t come <br/>\ndownstairs; bad thing is that they will HT through the floor.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck hunting!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Beatdrop Battledrum<br/>\n51st Minstrel of the Karana Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
