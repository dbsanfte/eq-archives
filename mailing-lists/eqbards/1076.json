I heard a rumor<br/>\nthat killing the bandits in Lesser Faydark negatively affects your faction<br/>\nwith the gypsies in addition to your faction with the Dervish Cutthroats.<br/>\nWhen you kill a bandit, you get the message your faction with the Dervish<br/>\nCutthroats decreased, but no mention of the gypsies.  I haven&#39;t tried to<br/>\npurchase anything from the gypsies yet because I have not adventured on<br/>\nAntonica yet.  Just want to make sure that I&#39;m not hurting my faction with<br/>\nthem by killing bandits in Lesser Faydark.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin<br/>\nE&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
