I find it very funny that EVERYTHING RESISTS a level<br/>\n&gt; 38 song (Chant) but almost nothing resists a level 12 song (Bellow).  Can<br/>\n&gt; anyone confirm for me that this song actually works????  It isn&#39;t doing a<br/>\n&gt; thing for me!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, what sort of things are you killing?  If you&#39;re in Sol B, yeah, you&#39;re going to get<br/>\nresisted a ton.  Chant of flame has 2 strikes against it.  First, its a fire based dot, so it<br/>\nchecks a mobs fire resistance, and everything in the Soluseks has really a really high<br/>\nresist to fire.  Bellow and most of our other songs check a mobs magic resist, which<br/>\nis generally lower.  Secondly, Chant does damage *and* lowers fire resistance.<br/>\nDual effect songs are always more often resisted than single effect songs.  You might<br/>\nalso notice this with Denons discord vs. Chords of Dissonance.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Lohengrin, Rallos Zek<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanx,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Isabo Donjour<br/>\n&gt; Tarew Marr<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Angela Kurtz<br/>\n&gt; Vanguard Division<br/>\n&gt; South Central Region<br/>\n&gt; 972-788-0746 / 972-788-2052 fax<br/>\n&gt; 1-800-322-2389 / VM  x6424<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:angela.kurtz@...\">angela.kurtz@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
