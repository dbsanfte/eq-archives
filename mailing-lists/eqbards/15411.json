DIKU <br/>\nmud first appeared in mid-March 1990. A group of programmers in the <br/>\nComputer Science Department at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark <br/>\nwanted to create an automated system for fantasy role playing. The driving <br/>\nforce behind the development derived from the inadequacies of AmberMUD. <br/>\nAmberMUD source code could not handle many players, was inefficient on <br/>\ncomputer resources, and tended towards smaller world environments. The <br/>\npopularity of the DIKU source code has spawned many variants.  Many DIKUs <br/>\nare quickly approaching uniqueness compared with their predecessor. Names <br/>\nincluding: Circle, Merc, Copper, Sequent, Silly, and Epic head the list of <br/>\nfreely available modified DIKU source code.   Many programmers have <br/>\nmodified original DIKU source beyond  recognition compared to the original <br/>\nDIKU code. Although the look and feel may be similar to the original DIKU <br/>\nformat, the game engine itself is usually quite different. Names including: <br/>\nSojourn, Medieva, Mozart, Mystic, Forbidden Lands, and Perilous Realms head <br/>\nthe list of these custom muds. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nFor more along these lines:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://imaginaryrealities.imaginary.com/\">http://imaginaryrealities.imaginary.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nTalies the erudite (in the original sense of the word)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
