Such things make me<br/>\nnervous, like only one worthwhile attribute, strength, reminds me of another<br/>\nmassively multiplayer game.  Personally, I distributed things between all<br/>\nbard attributes fairly evenly, admit probably put 10 points in strength.<br/>\nMight have added some to dex too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wanted to bring up Hide and Forage though.  I started with both of these<br/>\nas a Wood Elf, seems nice maybe.  First, I never bother with hide anymore.<br/>\nI used to when I could Con an enemy to tell if I was hidden or not.  Now,<br/>\nthere&#39;s just no way to be able to know if I&#39;m hiding.  I fail hiding a good<br/>\n2/3 of the time it seems, so any situation where I&#39;d need to hide is not one<br/>\nwhere I&#39;d risk attempting it.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext there&#39;s Forage.  Very nice skill to have.  But am I mistaken in<br/>\nassuming that I can not raise it now that I can train in it?  How did the<br/>\ncap on Forage work for any High Elves or Humans out there?  Just seems to me<br/>\nat my level I can get everything up to at least average, except forage.  Is<br/>\nthis because I&#39;m a Wood Elf?<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, OK, so I can never raise forage it seems, and I&#39;ll never be able to<br/>\nraise hide, which means I&#39;ll never use hide.<br/>\n<br/>\nRoop<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Scott Pickle &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scottp@...\">scottp@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Friday, May 14, 1999 3:33 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] starting stats<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Scott Pickle &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scottp@...\">scottp@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I also disagree that str is the best stat.

This armor if u didnt know is much lighter than plate<br/>\n&gt;and just as good(i think, i dont have stats on all pieces)..also got a<br/>\n&gt;thick leather apron from unrest  ac8 weight 1....<br/>\n&gt;2ndly as you get this high there are plenty of magical items to pump up<br/>\n&gt;your strength..both as loot and now from enchanters as they get higher up<br/>\n&gt;in level.<br/>\n&gt;So as you can see dont worry if your not arnold the bard...i found my<br/>\n&gt;pumped dex and agility much more useful as lowere level than i would<br/>\n&gt;strength...:)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;At 02:57 PM 5/14/99 -0500, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;From: &quot;Lorrie Hopper&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lhopper@...\">lhopper@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;I would suggest pumping up your strength above all the other stats, thus<br/>\n&gt;&gt;enabling you to wear better armor later among other things already<br/>\n&gt;mentioned<br/>\n&gt;&gt;in other posts.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;As far as best race goes, personally I dont think there is one.
