As a 50th<br/>\n&gt; level character, Naeeldar&#39;s opinion is the the #1 problem with EQ is that<br/>\n&gt; there isn&#39;t enough stuff for 50th level players to do.  I agree with him<br/>\n&gt; 100%.  As a 32d level player, my opinion is that the #1 problem with EQ is<br/>\n&gt; that Verant seems to be neglecting the 46- players.  By this I mean there<br/>\n&gt; are a lot of areas in the game that need to be fixed, i.e. more quality<br/>\n&gt; quests, new items for medium level characters, bugs, etc.   <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>One point newer players may not be aware of, is that the game shipped<br/>\nwith a lot of zones unfinished. Maybe it was before your time but they<br/>\nmade a big deal of finally itemizing Permafrost last spring, then Sol A<br/>\nand then Sol B. Then much later they did Kedge. Now they are finally<br/>\ngetting around to the planes but really they did the 46- stuff first and<br/>\nin terms of quantity have done just as much if not more for 46- players<br/>\nas for 46+.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the problem is, as usual, perception. They&#39;ve done more recently<br/>\nfor 46+. It&#39;s just like the current crop of warrior complaints. Now<br/>\nthey&#39;ve finally started to fix some problems with Paladins and<br/>\nShadowknights, some Warriors are starting to complain there&#39;s nothing in<br/>\nthe patches for them, possibly because they weren&#39;t around when Warriors<br/>\ngot their buffing, and the very first class specific armor quests, and,<br/>\na huge number of Warrior only weapons, both in quests and in drops in<br/>\nSol B.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nIndependent contractors: Find your next project gig through JobSwarm!<br/>\n        You can even make money by referring friends.<br/>\n&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
