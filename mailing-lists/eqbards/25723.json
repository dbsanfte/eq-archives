Januar 2002 18:54<br/>\nAn: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nBetreff: Re: [eqbards] bards in AoE groups<br/>\n<br/>\nOptimal Settings/Options...  PC spells OFF. Particle Density OFF. I remember<br/>\n<br/>\nbeing d/c from just seeing 15-20 messages of &quot;stunned by scintillating <br/>\ncolors&quot;... not fun missing out on the exp of that pull hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn AE group, you may very well be the puller, but only when each caster is <br/>\ngtg on mana... our guild has 4 active 59-60 wizzies and they hate exp the <br/>\ntraditional way, so whenever they get the chance they hit Seb, HS, chardok <br/>\nfor AE group.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a bard in AE group, at 54 (Selos Assonant Strane) you get AE slow/snare, <br/>\nand 55 (Cantana of Replenishment) you get C2 song, and 59 (Denon&#39;s <br/>\nBereavement) is AE mr debuff and DoT - essentially AE tash with a dot <br/>\ncomponent, which are great for the group as a whole.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe chanter hopefully has some reagents for Rune IV or V, preferrably <br/>\nBedlam, which is a rune with no reagent at all. He&#39;ll rune you (and <br/>\nhim/herself), you&#39;ll go down a long hall, or into an open area, go aggro any<br/>\n<br/>\nsurrounding mobs. I like to leave AE snare running so as it aggros the mobs,<br/>\n<br/>\nthey&#39;re snared and don&#39;t beat on you the entire time making it back to the <br/>\ngroup.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf youre pulling into a small room, beware the aggro rules that VI has <br/>\nimplemented. There will only be a max of 4 mobs aggro on you at once, so if <br/>\nyou pulled 10 mobs, the other 6 will be waiting outside the door. Once the <br/>\nfirst nuke or stun goes off, pulling aggro from you, the other mobs that <br/>\nwere aggro on you outside, will come into the room eventually to their <br/>\ndemise.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne chanter is sufficient, hopefully either you or he/she has the AE MR <br/>\ndebuff, (Denon&#39;s Bereavement) or (Winds of Tashini) something like that. If <br/>\nthere&#39;s a lot of resists he&#39;ll get the beat down, not the puller. Here is my<br/>\n<br/>\ntypical twist for AE: (with best lute) Assonant Strane, Bereavement, and <br/>\nChords of Discord. Yes a L2 song, maybe not the best dot effect, but it&#39;s AE<br/>\n<br/>\nand it utilizes the Lute so you don&#39;t have to switch out in the lag of <br/>\nbattle/casting spam.<br/>\n<br/>\nPava<br/>\nCT<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nChat with friends online, try MSN Messenger: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://messenger.msn.com\">http://messenger.msn.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
