It may end up being wasted effort, but if<br/>\nthe bard community can come up with solid reasoning as to why they should<br/>\nstack then perhaps we can get enough support from the rest of the EQ<br/>\ncommunity that Verant will reconsider.  This would be a change that benefits<br/>\nevery class without nerfing enchanters and shamans.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn regards to Berserker (42 song), is there anyone out there besides me who<br/>\nthinks the haste bonus of this song is screwed up?  Celerity at 36 gives you<br/>\na 20% bonus while Verses of Victory at 50 gives you 30%.  Since Berserker is<br/>\nin between these two songs, doesn&#39;t it seem like the haste bonus should be<br/>\n25% instead of 17%.  Also, Berserker is the only haste song pre-50 that is<br/>\nenchanced with an instrument (brass).  Anthem, Celerity and Verses are all<br/>\nsinging only.  So shouldn&#39;t the haste bonus of Berserker be increased when<br/>\nyou equip an instrument? The STR and AC bonus for using a brass instrument<br/>\nwith Berserker is double.  So at a minimum, the haste bonus should be 34%.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
