It&#39;s bad.<br/>\n<br/>\nUs bards have to press buttons every 5 secs to change songs and now we&#39;ll <br/>\nhave to continue to be chained to our desks during downtime.<br/>\n<br/>\nAuto-logoff would be really bad, btw. Have you ever been in a room that has <br/>\na motion sensor light? If you sit at your desk and you&#39;re reading, you have <br/>\nto wave your hand in the air every 15 min or end up in the dark.<br/>\n<br/>\nAuto-logoff is the same thing. You may be sitting reading stuff on your <br/>\nscreen, not necessarily pushing any buttons for 10 mins, but get booted off <br/>\njust because the server thinks you&#39;re inactive. You&#39;d have to make sure you <br/>\npush a button every 10 mins or be booted. After you&#39;re booted, you&#39;d lose <br/>\nall of your no-rent items as well as any illusions you had up. I don&#39;t <br/>\nthink Verant would even implement such a bad thing. Uhh, maybe not. Don&#39;t <br/>\npost the auto-logoff thing on the web Kit.

It&#39;s another example of where<br/>\n&gt;probably some bard was sitting AFK on the planes and now we all have to be<br/>\n&gt;nerfed because someone abused the situation.  Heaven forbid they should<br/>\n&gt;handle this by putting in an auto logoff when someone is inactive for more<br/>\n&gt;than 10 minutes like most games do.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;         Kit<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;From: John Tatsukawa [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:john@...\">john@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;Sent: Tuesday, October 31, 2000 1:22 PM<br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>; &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: RE: [eqbards] Change to bard song mechanics on Test!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Absor has asked everyone to switch to a different thread on this:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum3/HTML/003015.html\">http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum3/HTML/003015.html</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;d have to agree with Lago on Verant&#39;s reasoning that this is to keep us<br/>\n&gt;from going AFK indefinitely.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;---Windleaf<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;At 12:58 PM 10/31/00 -0700, Kimes, Dean W. wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Of course this will make Aria and Clouding instant death songs in many<br/>\n&gt; &gt;situations.

The message received is evidently &quot;Your song ends abruptly&quot;,<br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;has a chance of occuring on every pulse. Once again, Verant seems to be<br/>\n&gt; &gt;putting the screws to us.  We can&#39;t take a break at all from the keyboard<br/>\n&gt;if<br/>\n&gt; &gt;we want to keep two songs up, now I have to stay at the keyboard to keep<br/>\n&gt;one<br/>\n&gt; &gt;song up as well.
