I&#39;ve found Baelish from Caster&#39;s Realm is usually able to<br/>\nget attention on matters where no amount of screaming from others has any<br/>\neffect.  I never got any reply from GZ on my earlier posts and emails that<br/>\nLullaby was not working until I elicited Baelish&#39;s assistance.  The day<br/>\nafter Baelish responded that he would ask the question for me, GZ sent<br/>\nemails to everyone who had sent him emails about lullaby problems and a<br/>\nsecond one to me asking for more info on the data I had sent him 4+ weeks<br/>\npreviously.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, February 16, 2000 11:00 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Lullaby<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wed, 16 Feb 2000, Perhaps a Princess... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Note: Abashi is perfectly aware of the practice of bumping.
