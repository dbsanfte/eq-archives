So get some<br/>\nhelp or maybe try this idea that was posted a while back (by Harmonic):<br/>\n<br/>\nGo to Lake Rathe (why I cant say except maybe roaming singles can be found<br/>\nthere?) Get levitate and SoW.  Track (ok have ranger friend track) DW<br/>\ngobbies. Get right on top of them and agro them with Chords or other AE<br/>\nsong. Run for the zone.  Have a ranger cast snare on one and zone out then<br/>\nright back in.  Find the snared one and kill him. Pray that he has a helm<br/>\nand that you wont have to repeat this 20 times.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I got mine, I was mid 30&#39;s and with a 40+ Enchanter, Cleric & SK.  They<br/>\nwere pulling from the underwater tower in Oasis.  They had broken the spawn<br/>\napart by the time I got there so I dont know what exactly they did.  We had<br/>\nto kill more than a dozen before we got an opalline helm.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Daniel P.
