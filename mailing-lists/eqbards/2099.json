I have a barbed leather whip, dragoon dirk, demon claws,<br/>\npolished granite tomahawk, and screaming mace. I know I want to use my claws<br/>\njust cause they look so cool ; ) but they can only be worn in primary hand<br/>\n=( I am wondering if I should go for the dmg (barbed whip) or speed (dragoon<br/>\ndirk)? My 1h blunt is pretty low (27) so in my mind I have probably already<br/>\nruled it out, and the PGT&#39;s shield skin song hurts more than helps at higher<br/>\nlevels since the first hit the mob gets in when it wears offis for dmg based<br/>\non your low agil. Any feedback would be appreciated!<br/>\nKarnek D&#39;Jester L27 Bard - Erollisi Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
