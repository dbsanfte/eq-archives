After two nights of<br/>\ngrouping with a friend to kill the hermit in SK (he&#39;s around lvl 21-23 I<br/>\nthink, and is at -5411, -2646), I now have enough to buy a Dirk (just<br/>\nshelled out 50pp on banded so I&#39;m rebuilding my funds).  Speaking of Ye Olde<br/>\nHermit, he gives out a cracked flute and the first sheet of the WInds of<br/>\nKarana (to give to the bard at the water fountain in SK), does anyone know<br/>\nif this quest works, or where the other sheet(s) are?<br/>\n    Also, is any particular instrument better than any other?  (ie:  Is my<br/>\nmino horn better or worse than my brass horn. etc)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n-=B=-<br/>\nNOR Bard, Esq.<br/>\nBard-at-Large<br/>\n17th and climbing<br/>\nThe Rathe</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
