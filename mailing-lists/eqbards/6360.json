Try it and find out!<br/>\n<br/>\nI have grouped with a 30 warrior when I was 20 bard and I got xp TWO TIMES<br/>\nFASTER than he did.  Now he had just entered his Hell level and had to get<br/>\nmany more kills to his bar a bub that I did.  But there were just 2 of us in<br/>\nthe party and the mobs were blue to him and red to me (pickclaw lookout in<br/>\nhighkeep.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 22, I would group with a 24 25 and 26 and get almost NO xp - at least my<br/>\nbubs filled VERY slowly.  And they were not slow attacking stuff and no huge<br/>\ndowntimes.  But the mobs they attacked were blue and yeller to them and<br/>\nblue, yeller and occasional red to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 21, I grouped with a 48 lev magician and we camped the orgers in west k.<br/>\nThe baby og&#39;s were red.  The Chief was ded red.  Hell, the Chief&#39;s dog was<br/>\nthe only thing conned blue or yeller.  I got NO xp - some nice bone plate<br/>\narmor and other mics oger loots. Why would a 48 lev mage ask me to camp with<br/>\nhim?  Maybe cuz I found him running around nekkid and ran him back to his<br/>\ncorpse w/o asking his lev or for any payments.<br/>\n<br/>\nI only had one good experience in Runny - and that was when a 30 lev druid<br/>\nwho knew the dungeon pull kings to the ramp for us - full party of 20-lo&#39;s<br/>\nto kill.  Nice loots - I got Black Iron Medallion and Blackened Boots - dint<br/>\nknow they could kick magic&#39;s but guess they can.  There are some heavy duty<br/>\ncasters in there - Guardian Rythmn&#39;s and your drum - for sure!!<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly - the bard!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n -----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:roleplay@...\">roleplay@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:roleplay@...\">roleplay@...</a>] <br/>\nSent:\tFriday, September 10, 1999 4:49 PM<br/>\nTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject:\t[eqbards] Grouping levels<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:roleplay@...\">roleplay@...</a>&gt; (by way of Talies the Wanderer<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:snicker@...\">snicker@...</a>&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\nI am a level 18 bard on the Rathe.
