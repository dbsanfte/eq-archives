What I&#39;m ready to go after is<br/>\n&gt; Brahm&#39;s Horn, from the named mino 40ish or so, I&#39;m told.  I<br/>\n&gt; would imagine a good party of 30-35s could take him out very<br/>\n&gt; easily.  Lord Grimrot is 37th, and was beaten by a 30,34,35.<br/>\n&gt; And Grimrot hits _hard_.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As for SolA, since the weekend is here (meaning the jerks sign<br/>\n&gt; on in numbers) I will be leaving CT tonight and heading out<br/>\n&gt; to somewhere else.  So SolA would be a good idea.  I cannot<br/>\n&gt; stand rubi-itis when it rears its ugly face.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think my first stop is Permafrost for a white wolf cloak and<br/>\n&gt; a 1h silvery war axe.  I know exactly who to kill for what, I<br/>\n&gt; just never had the group to clear and hold the throne room.<br/>\n&gt; Maybe pick up a mammoth cloak, CIMS, or runed circlet for trade.<br/>\n&gt; I could have gotten rubi legs last night had I camped the alchemist<br/>\n&gt; a few more days for another cloak.  &lt;sigh&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am definitely up for SolA this weekend, if it&#39;s convenient.<br/>\n&gt; The charred BP would be nice, I just get lost in the gnome<br/>\n&gt; castle too often.  As for the gloves...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; charred gloves: ac7, +3dex, +5int<br/>\n&gt; elfhide gloves: ac4, +5dex, +5agi<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I can justify the loss of 3ac (and the useless int) for +2 more dex<br/>\n&gt; and +5 more agi.  Elfhide gloves are the deal.  Wish they were black.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have already obtained a pair of charred boots.  But the BP would<br/>\n&gt; be nice.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Harmonic Distortion, 30th drummer.<br/>\n&gt; League of Antonican Bards, The Wind Spirit&#39;s Song<br/>\n&gt; &lt; Keepers of Norrath &gt;  Innoruuk<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  home to the world&#39;s liveliest email communities.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
