What I mean is if you<br/>\nwant to kill a sarnak, charm a burynai or goblin and not another sarnak.<br/>\nWhy?  It seems that like mobs in Kunark will not automatically other like<br/>\nmobs.  This means that you have to order your pet to attack the target<br/>\neverytime you charm your pet (or let the target hit you once after every<br/>\ncharm).<br/>\n <br/>\nAnother important thing about charming in Kunark is that all iksar mobs are<br/>\nimmune to charm.
