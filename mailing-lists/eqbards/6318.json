Yes - boost it up to 100, 110, 120 but beyond that - it make little<br/>\ndiff. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow consider the magic buffs - I see my dex into 130 plus buffed with song<br/>\nand should I wonder if it need my jewelry dexi boosters?  Or should I wonder<br/>\nif I need my dexi buff song?  And can use other sings since my stats are<br/>\ngood from my jewels.  But then what about the warrior in the party who<br/>\ndumped all his points into wis and int and has 80 dex unbuffed - hehe guess<br/>\nhe needs my songs!<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\tAndy Simpson [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gohorns@...\">gohorns@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tThursday, September 10, 1998 5:59 AM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n\t\tSubject:\tRE: [eqbards] Dex vrs Agility<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFrom: &quot;Andy Simpson&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gohorns@...\">gohorns@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t\t&gt;<br/>\n\t\t&gt; People keep saying this but I don&#39;t find it to be true.

Agility DOES affect your AC. I don&#39;t<br/>\nhave the<br/>\n\t\tnumbers written down but I do know that my AC is affected by<br/>\nhow much<br/>\n\t\t+agility I have (just like my HP are affected by how much<br/>\n+stamina I have).<br/>\n\t\tHowever, once your agility reaches 100, it takes a larger<br/>\namount of agility<br/>\n\t\tboosting items/buffs to see that AC increase.  If you doubt<br/>\nthis at all,<br/>\n\t\ttake off all your +agility items and look at your AC then<br/>\nput them on and<br/>\n\t\tcompare again. For those of you with a base agility that is<br/>\nlower than 100<br/>\n\t\tyou should see your AC increase.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tOne example I can give and maybe some of you can test this<br/>\nwith someone you<br/>\n\t\ttrust, but the dwarven cleric I run around with gets better<br/>\nAC from his BS<br/>\n\t\ttunic than a bronze breastplate because of the agility<br/>\nboost. Because my<br/>\n\t\tagility hangs around the 110 mark, my AC went down from<br/>\nSteel/Bronze when I<br/>\n\t\ttried his tunic on. Had I removed all my other +agility<br/>\nitems and tried<br/>\n\t\tagain, the story might have been different. I&#39;ll try this<br/>\ntonight if I can<br/>\n\t\tremember and let you all know what I find.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tAnthem Dirgemaker<br/>\n\t\t33rd level bard of Qeynos<br/>\n\t\tSolusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tONElist:  your connection to people who share your<br/>\ninterests.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
