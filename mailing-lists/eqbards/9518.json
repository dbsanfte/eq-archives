I was vehemently against this idea when it was<br/>\ninitially proposed by Verant.  Its better than making everything &#39;no drop&#39;<br/>\nthe way it is becoming now.  This would chase away some of the higher levels<br/>\nfrom lower level events however.  I think cutting it off at the xp gaining<br/>\npoint would be too tight though, get 4 mobs on me that are just barely too<br/>\ngreen to give xp and I may still be in trouble depending on the zone.<br/>\nThere&#39;s nothing I hate more than killing a new mob, only to find a cool item<br/>\nfor a monk or caster that is &#39;no drop&#39;.  Normally I could give it away or<br/>\nsell it to a guildmember, making it &#39;no drop&#39; just makes it useless.  Quests<br/>\nare becoming especially true for this.  Do a quest and get an item you can&#39;t<br/>\nuse.  If this is supposed to make us do quests that are for our class only<br/>\nthen it sucks even worse as there are many monk and paladin quests but<br/>\nnearly no bard quests.  &#39;No Drop&#39; is no solution its merely a crutch used to<br/>\navoid a real solution.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: David Knadler [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dknadler@...\">dknadler@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, November 02, 1999 2:29 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Re: Undead drops in Kithicor<br/>\nImportance: Low<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: David Knadler &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dknadler@...\">dknadler@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n[snip]<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Problem is, all those 40+ level <br/>\n&gt; characters would flood<br/>\n&gt; the zone anyway just to kill everything to see what it <br/>\n&gt; dropped, depriving<br/>\n&gt; people of an appropriate level from participating.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[snip]<br/>\n<br/>\nI couldn&#39;t agree with you more Kitasi.  It&#39;s pure greed, plain and simple.<br/>\nThis always happens in games of this nature : High level players abusing<br/>\ntheir powers.  I wish there were effective and sensible ways of keeping<br/>\ncertain level ranges away from each other.  Like an island for characters 1<br/>\n- 15, then a two hour boat ride to the next island (16 - 30), etc, etc.  It<br/>\nwould definitely go a long way to restoring some sense of balance to the<br/>\neconomy and keep incidents like Kitasi described from happening (but it<br/>\nwould probably create a whole new slew of problems as well).<br/>\n<br/>\nBlindly rambling...<br/>\nDesmei Sightblinder<br/>\nLvl 30 Bard [Povar]<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a> with<br/>\nthe subject lol.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
