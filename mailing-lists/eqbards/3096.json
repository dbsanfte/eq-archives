The leader was doing dumb stuff -<br/>\ntrying to killsteal, not sharing spawns, arguing with other campers, etc.<br/>\nSo, finally someone says lets go to this bandit camp... I say no, we are too<br/>\nlow for them. Leader say no, we can take em. I say, bye bye!<br/>\n<br/>\nNot five minutes later, I am standing on a path by a hut with no guards<br/>\ntalking to some adventurers when former leader trains bandit camp on top of<br/>\nuse &#39;cuz he thinks this hut has guards.  I left the group cuz I dint want<br/>\nthis idjit to git me keeled but he managed to keel me anyways! &lt;oh well<br/>\nliving and dieing in Norrath&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\tRoop Dirump [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:roop@...\">roop@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tWednesday, July 07, 1999 11:24 PM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n\t\tSubject:\t[eqbards] Dumb People<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFrom: &quot;Roop Dirump&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:roop@...\">roop@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tAlright the mage thinks to themselves, I need a nice safe<br/>\nplace to meditate.<br/>\n\t\tHm, this bridge here should be safe.  When folks train the<br/>\nreally tough<br/>\n\t\tmonsters like that big Proon, they&#39;ll most certainly bring<br/>\nhim this way.<br/>\n\t\tYes, I&#39;ll sit down right here, because I can be most certain<br/>\nthis is where<br/>\n\t\tProon will be standing angrily when the fleeing person is<br/>\ngone.  And I will<br/>\n\t\thave no time to even stand up before I&#39;m dead!  Perfect!  Oh<br/>\nthat rivershore<br/>\n\t\tnearby is far too safe, Proon might not see me, completely<br/>\nunacceptable.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tI cannot believe the angry shouts from these people, angry<br/>\nthey were not<br/>\n\t\twarned Proon was coming.  Dumb people.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tToday was the first day I actually quit a group and actually<br/>\ninformed them<br/>\n\t\tit was because they were such a bad group.  Usually I am<br/>\nmore discreet,<br/>\n\t\tbecause the bad players actually try to be good players, and<br/>\nmay learn one<br/>\n\t\tday.  But this group, from their idiotic banter, to their<br/>\nactions, arrgh!<br/>\n\t\tThey got me killed by all four, not just one, the whole<br/>\ndullard lot of them<br/>\n\t\tchasing after a hurt monster, happily slashing away.<br/>\nMeanwhile the bard is<br/>\n\t\tleft to fend for himself!  Not only that, I was stacking<br/>\nHymn and Anthem...<br/>\n\t\twith another bard in the group, playing... of all things,<br/>\nAccelerando!<br/>\n\t\tDuring battle!  He told me he was playing it because we<br/>\nmight have to flee.<br/>\n\t\tFor the whole battle, he plays it, for when we flee.....<br/>\n&lt;&lt;rolls eyes&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tI think bards may have a bad reputation by the dumb people<br/>\nwho like just one<br/>\n\t\tsong, likely the entire basis of their class-choice, and<br/>\nplay this song even<br/>\n\t\tat the innapropriate times!  This fool-bard also mentioned<br/>\nhe was twinked so<br/>\n\t\theavily because he sold crack.  &quot;Only the gods can help me<br/>\nnow!&quot; I thought,<br/>\n\t\tand they didn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tRoop<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tAttention ONElist list owners.<br/>\n\t\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n\t\tWe&#39;ve just added a &quot;NO ATTACHMENTS&quot; option.
