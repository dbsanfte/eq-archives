To get her<br/>\nto spawn you have to kill both the Prince and the Princess and while they<br/>\nare both dead she may (10% maybe) spawn.  Yet the Queen is seen all the time<br/>\nbecause the Prince and Princess are easily killed and give decent xp when<br/>\nother Klicknacks are too green.  There is no reason to think this level of<br/>\nsymbiosis in the spawning process stops at higher levels, it just becomes<br/>\nmore subtle.  No longer do the mob names give away what you have to kill to<br/>\nspawn a particular mob, but chances are if you keep killing things<br/>\neventually some of them may be figured out.  I killed the Prince and<br/>\nPrincess hundreds of times at lower levels to get the Queen to spawn before<br/>\nnoting that she never spawned if I just kill Princes, or just killed<br/>\nPrincesses, but only if I continuously killed both.  All this to get an<br/>\nwarrior friend who decided to become a jeweler some enchanted silver.  If<br/>\nClerics would start looking for these triggers instead of just complaining<br/>\nI&#39;m willing to bet at least in some of the cases they will find them.<br/>\nCourse complaining is much easier I will be the first to admit.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: James Schuldes [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, December 01, 1999 12:25 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] RE: Cleric/Bard armor quests<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: James Schuldes &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the patch news there is mention of a system they have where you have to<br/>\nkill some things to make certain other things spawn.
