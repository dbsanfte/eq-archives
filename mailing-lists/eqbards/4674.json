Celerity does not stack with Anthem - I took Shada s advice and twisted Celerity w/Chant and it works great.

If so, I&#39;m <br/>\n&gt;interested<br/>\n&gt;in why one would choose Chant of Battle over Anthem. My current lineup at<br/>\n&gt;level 16 (DING! - I *love* the jig! It&#39;s so much more entertaining if while<br/>\n&gt;watching it, you sing to yourself - &quot;Do a little dance, Make a little love,<br/>\n&gt;Get down tonight! Get down tonight!)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Celerity does not stack with Anthem - I took Shada&#39;s advice and twisted <br/>\nCelerity w/Chant and it works great. The tanks love it too, STR, DEX, and a <br/>\nNICE AGI bonus, as well as a seemingly better speedup than with Anthem.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Then I usually use two remaining slots to rotate as needed things like<br/>\n&gt;Locating, Aquatic Ayre and Cindra&#39;s Charismatic Carillion (even though I<br/>\n&gt;haven&#39;t noticed it doing much good).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t underestimate the Carillon! I play a half elf and went to Kaladim to <br/>\nbuy steel armor for a high elf friend of mine (I found that the gnomes <br/>\nquoted same prices in Ak&#39;anon earlier). The dwaven smith quoted me at around <br/>\n960 plat or so for a small steel breastplate. After buffing my Charisma with <br/>\nall my CHA items i managed to shave about 5- to 75 plat off that. Then i <br/>\nconned him and found he was apprehensive so I used Carrillon on him to make <br/>\nhim Amiable. I was astounded to see the price for a small steel breastplate <br/>\ndrop to 805 plat! I think Enchanters got it better for this type of thing, <br/>\nbut when ya can&#39;t find one.. =)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Songs that I&#39;ve noticed don&#39;t seem to do much are the Rhythm songs and the<br/>\n&gt;Lucid Lullaby (Rats outside of Freeport were resisting it to me last night<br/>\n&gt;at level 16).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Lullaby is nowhere near as good as it was in beta. Of course an enchanter is <br/>\nTHE way to go for crowd control - but when none is available, I will use <br/>\nlullaby if there is too many creatures in a fight. Most of the time (for me) <br/>\nit works well enough that we can concentrate on one mob at a time and our <br/>\nhealer can keep me alive =)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I didnt even bother to purchase the Cataloging song. I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt;looking forward to 17 for the dual weild and sneak  skills but I &gt;don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt;know whether to get the song since it&#39;s another in the line of Rhythms. Is <br/>\n&gt;it me<br/>\n&gt;doing something wrong, or are these songs either very weak or completely<br/>\n&gt;useless?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Can&#39;t really comment on these last songs you mentioned. The few times I have <br/>\nused resistance songs was when there was another bard in my group (very <br/>\nrare), and she sat back with her drums for full effect. We were killing the <br/>\nfroglok scryer and noone ever got charmed, so we were pretty happy with it <br/>\n=)<br/>\n<br/>\nSartori D&#39;Elsiraad<br/>\nBard of Kelethin of the 37th Chorus<br/>\nVeeshan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
