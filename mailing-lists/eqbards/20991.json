My favorite memory is before they lowered Meldrath&#39;s level... <br/>\nAt level 14, I convinced my friend Destructor that the minos would be good<br/>\nxp and we ran straight to the back of the cave and Meldrath casted through<br/>\nthe wall and killed us in like 1 cast.  We tried unsuccessfully to get our<br/>\ncorpses back, suffering numerous deaths and Destructor  was ready to KILL<br/>\nme.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThen we see this dark elf, in full rubicite (now this is back in say June of<br/>\nlast year).  I did a /who and it was a shaman!  I remember being SOOOO<br/>\nconfused how a dark elf could be a shaman and so in awe of his rubicite.<br/>\nWell he buffed us up good with Tuna and such. I remember Destructor taking<br/>\nscreenshots because his HPs went over 1000!!!    Needless to say we got our<br/>\ncorpses but I still harbor a secret hatred for Meldrath and kill him every<br/>\nchance I get.<br/>\n<br/>\nHalana, 2 pixels from 55 shaman, freshly spanked by Trakanon<br/>\nTani, 27th Bardette, stuck in Butcherblock<br/>\nSolusek Ro :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Big Daddy Legba [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:legba@...\">legba@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, August 15, 2000 9:24 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [eqbards] Steamfont<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you see the minotaur hero, don&#39;t expect the guards to stop <br/>\n&gt; him, he eats<br/>\n&gt; them for breakfast.
