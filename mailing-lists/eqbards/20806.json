Here are some notes I haven&#39;t seen posted or in<br/>\nany guide:<br/>\n<br/>\nTarskuk, the named cyclops is 33rd lvl and runs faster<br/>\nthan SOW.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe area to the right of the Lake Rathetear zone is a<br/>\nvalley with a large hill in the middle (bandit camp on<br/>\nthe hill top).  There is a gypsy camp to the North and<br/>\nan undead tower to the South.  The East side of this<br/>\n&quot;racetrack&quot; seldom has any action and this is prolly<br/>\nthe best area for easy charm kiting.  Optionally you<br/>\ncan pull two Clops North of the gypsy camp to the open<br/>\narea near the ruined druid ring for your kiting. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe cyclops are often well camped and many people who<br/>\ndon&#39;t understand the bard class take exception to you<br/>\nand two angry cyclops barreling thru their peaceful<br/>\ncamp.  Any trains that occur during this time will<br/>\nlikely be blamed on you.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like to get on early in the morning when there are<br/>\nfew people in the zone.  There are seldom any &#39;clops<br/>\nspawned at this time.  Kill the placeholders,<br/>\nlizardmen, bears and giant skeletons until a few<br/>\ncyclops pop.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlways kill placeholders until at least three cyclops<br/>\nspawn.  It is a sad thing when you&#39;ve got a cyclops in<br/>\ntow and the second is taken by a group that has just<br/>\narrived.  If this happens, relax.  Not even Tarskuk<br/>\ncan catch you with that drum equiped.  Just run around<br/>\nthe track until you see your next victim.  If nothing<br/>\nelse, you can have your pet-in-tow kill placeholders<br/>\nfor you until more cyclops spawn.  You will be<br/>\nsurprised at how quickly cyclops can kill a bear or<br/>\nlizardman so be quick to retarget.<br/>\n<br/>\nCharm kiting with a group:<br/>\n<br/>\nGenerally a bad idea.  Cyclops hit very hard and<br/>\nmistakes are often deadly.  But if you do, post your<br/>\nhealers by the zone entrance and run by if you get<br/>\ninto trouble.  If you&#39;re really in trouble, the zone<br/>\nis right there.  Melee type can hang out near the<br/>\ngypsy camp and you can train your weakened ex-pet to<br/>\nthem for great xp.  Have the melee types kill<br/>\nplaceholders while you charm for a never-ending supply<br/>\nof prey.  At this point, the cyclops will ignore the<br/>\nwarriors in your group.  Just keep it chained and at a<br/>\ndistance and the fighters can walk behind it while the<br/>\ncyclops remains focused on you.<br/>\n<br/>\nNote:  Enchanters have much better charming ability<br/>\nthan we do.  the difference is that we run like the<br/>\ngingerbread man so mistakes and unexpected problems<br/>\nare much easier to avoid.  If you are lucky enough to<br/>\ngroup with an enchanter, let him/her charm while you<br/>\nsing Selo&#39;s.  Chain/Bellow/FCC the other cyclops and<br/>\nkeep your finger near the Selos hotkey in case the<br/>\nunexpected happens.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuggested songs to memm:<br/>\n<br/>\nAnthem/Chant of Battle<br/>\nChains<br/>\nHymm<br/>\nSelo&#39;s<br/>\nBellow<br/>\nFCC<br/>\nScreach<br/>\nSiren song<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nKick off your party with Yahoo!
