Still a major negative impact for newbies though.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 2)  If SOW overrides Selos, this can be a good thing if you are in a group<br/>\n&gt; with someone who can cast SOW.  You no longer have to worry about<br/>\n&gt; potentially screwing your party members over if you have to flee.  Having<br/>\n&gt; SOW cast on you without your permission is still a major concern though and<br/>\n&gt; I agree with Faras that we should be able to cancel the SOW similar to<br/>\n&gt; Levitate.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I can&#39;t play all day, so it&#39;d be nice if someone could test this:  If chains<br/>\nbreaks root and<br/>\nsnare, does it also break SOW?  If so, it&#39;ll just be a mild annoyance to be<br/>\nSOWed, and not<br/>\na huge, annoying problem...<br/>\n<br/>\n-Lohengrin</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
