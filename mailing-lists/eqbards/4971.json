It seems at higher level, the<br/>\n&gt;actually number doesn&#39;t really matter as much. The stats however do.<br/>\n&gt;Agility and Dex become more and more important in melee it seems.<br/>\n&gt;Nowadays, the mobs I fight bash me really hard whether I wear the best<br/>\n&gt;possible AC giving armor or not. It seems that our AC does not rise at<br/>\n&gt;the same speed as the ATK of the mobs we fight. I depend so much on a<br/>\n&gt;healer in our group, otherwise I&#39;m stuck with fighting really low blues<br/>\n&gt;with one or two other melee classes. This makes sense since as you rise<br/>\n&gt;in level, your defense points adds more to your total AC than the armor<br/>\n&gt;you are wearing. At lower levels, you hardly had any defense points so<br/>\n&gt;the AC of the armor played a large role in your overall AC. This<br/>\n&gt;changes in the higher levels because you gather so many defense points<br/>\n&gt;that they make up most of your AC and not the armor you wear. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I am going to have to disagree on this one, i think ac is now more<br/>\nimportant for me than the stats. Before i got an almost full suit of<br/>\nimbrued my ac was not that high because i always chose stats over ac. Last<br/>\nnight i got almost 60 ac points added to my totat from the armour and i<br/>\ncould actually tell a difference. This was after 5 hours of killing kobolds<br/>\nand i could easily tell that the ac was working. I was floored, normally i<br/>\ncant tell a difference from stats, but the ac improvement was obvious. And<br/>\ni got insane stats now, especially dex which is at 175, and way over 200<br/>\nafter buffs and songs. I know agil is important for ac but i can get that<br/>\nover 190 with buffs and it didnt make near as much difference to me as that<br/>\n50 ac. Course i was hardly scientific about it, but after 5 hours of<br/>\nplaying you get a pretty good fealing of the differences. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;GROUPING<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;As you level higher and higher, the level gap becomes wider and wider.<br/>\n&gt;I group regularly up to 5 levels above me and I still get decent exp.<br/>\n&gt;At lower levels, anything more than 2 levels is unheard of but it<br/>\n&gt;becomes more and more common and the exp isn&#39;t bad. Maybe someone can<br/>\n&gt;actually drop official numbers but from personal experience it&#39;s not<br/>\n&gt;bad at all. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I dont care about the levels of people i grouped with, i still always got<br/>\nxp. I just want a group :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ok some favors to ask now. Can I please see a screenshot of the bard<br/>\n&gt;armor? I want to see how cool I will look in the future hopefully if<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m lucky. Unfortunately, I&#39;m a fashion addict (and I&#39;m human too hence<br/>\n&gt;my armor is mostly lacking in the fashion department) and I would<br/>\n&gt;really like to see the bard only armor looks. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well i put up a set of bmps of what i look like at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.jrh.net/eq/imbrued.zip,\">http://www.jrh.net/eq/imbrued.zip,</a> which also has stats on everything but<br/>\nthe bracers,arms, and gloves. I dont have the gloves and arms yet. I am a<br/>\nhuman also, the wood elves seem to look much cooler imo. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;I know the Mistmoore Battle Drum is great and the Princess Lute doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;seem to be anything but a quest item.
