The poster got<br/>\nit off a monk website.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was just a post on the monk board where someone used the log programs<br/>\nto test combat against 10 DW Caimans with 93 AGI and again with 107 AGI.<br/>\nWhile most of the numbers were within general tolerances, average Dodges per<br/>\nfight went from 0.4 to 1.0, and average Blocks per fight went from 1.4 to<br/>\n2.4. Also, the mob&#39;s hit/miss ratio dropped from 48% to 44%, which is not<br/>\nsurprising.<br/>\nSo I&#39;m taking this as evidence that there IS an AGI boost to Dodge and Block<br/>\n(at least for monks, but probably for everyone), and likely for Parry as<br/>\nwell. If anyone&#39;s skeptical, well, you can type /log as well as any of us..</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
