I hit level 27 yesterday and decided to<br/>\npractice on Griffeenes to get my charm.  I noticed a couple of things during<br/>\nmy 8 successful and 3 unsuccessful attempts, 1 ending in with my death.<br/>\n<br/>\n1)  Once, the Griffeene just flat out disappeared when my pet killed it.<br/>\nThe only thing I did differently in this case was using one griffeene<br/>\nagainst another.  They are so hard to find, so I couldn&#39;t pass up that<br/>\nopportunity.  Anyone know what might have caused this?<br/>\n<br/>\n2)  If I didn&#39;t immediately give the griffawn the attack command on the<br/>\ngriffeene, it tended to attack lions and grizzlies indescrimately.  My only<br/>\ndeath using sirens was from a mini-train of grizzlies and highland lions.  I<br/>\nshould have aborted my attempt and zoned, but I didn&#39;t want to loose the<br/>\nGriffeene (I almost had it!).  If I immediately ran up to the fawn and gave<br/>\nit an attack order on the feene the first time I charmed it, then I didn&#39;t<br/>\nneed to give any orders for the rest of the battle.<br/>\n<br/>\n3)  It sucks when you choose a greenie too small.  You tell it to attack and<br/>\nit runs off...  Once one brought back GF.  I don&#39;t have a MM yet, but I was<br/>\nable to stay ahead of GF.  I did get to zone safe on that one.  I&#39;ve heard<br/>\nstories about GF&#39;s speed?  Did I just get lucky?<br/>\n<br/>\n4)  If you are like me, give it up in the rain.  I killed 2 of them in the<br/>\nrain, but both times I had a bubble of life left, mostly because of messed<br/>\nup timings on switch back to Selo.  I have no sense of direction or speed in<br/>\nthe fog.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone have any tips for tracking down a griffeene?  Most of my time<br/>\nwas spent trying to find the buggers.  I actually killed about 15 fawns<br/>\nusing charm in sheer boredom.  Who says practice first on small stuff<br/>\nfirst!! I like danger :-).<br/>\n<br/>\n11 attempts attempts and no charms :-(.  Oh well, back at it again tonight.<br/>\nThis was my very first Solo&#39;ing experience in 27 levels as a bard, and I<br/>\nmust admit it was fun, although VERY time consuming.<br/>\n<br/>\nTaneran Dreamweaver<br/>\n&lt;Clan Jax&gt;<br/>\nBard of the 27th song<br/>\nPrexus<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Abraham Hardjana [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ahardjan@...\">ahardjan@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Friday, November 12, 1999 11:48 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] Grand Opening!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: Abraham Hardjana &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ahardjan@...\">ahardjan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Okay let break it down ^_^.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1. Charm the blue 4-5 in a row doinf the basic charm and then run away.<br/>\n&gt; 2. At this point you are at the very top of the shit list for this mob.<br/>\n&gt; 3. Now find a green mob that can attack the blue.<br/>\n&gt; 4. Charm it and get it to attack the blue mob.<br/>\n&gt; 5. At this point you will notice that the blue mob will be chasing you<br/>\n&gt; ignoring the green that is attacking it.<br/>\n&gt; 6. Continue the charming of the greenie til the green kills the blue, the<br/>\n&gt; blue kills the green (you would go to step 3 again)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have successfully used this to kill Griffennes with the help of friendly<br/>\n&gt; Griffawns.  The only thing that you must be wary of are<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1.  If the creature is too green to the taget it will not attack it.<br/>\n&gt; 2.  Your pet will pick up other mobs so you will have to resort to running<br/>\n&gt; in a circle to avoid picking up some extra mobs.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Treilanin Loreweaver<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Thu, 11 Nov 1999, JasonF wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;JasonF&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JasonF@...\">JasonF@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t understand what is being accomplished here guys.<br/>\n&gt; Please explain it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; using small words and speak slowly.  My base INT is only 75.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Crier<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if you only have a uber blue and some greens.  Charm the blue a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; few times.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He will now be agro against you and will ingnore you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; completely.  Now find<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a green mob that is as fast as the uber blue and charm it<br/>\n&gt; and get it to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; attack the uber blue.  What I found is a griffawn can take down a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; griffenne in about 4-5 charms on the Griffawn ^_^.  Got my<br/>\n&gt; charm in that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; manner.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; You know, this is really really clever.  I&#39;d been risking<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; death by tossing a Chain on the mob that I wanted to lose, but<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I like your method better.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; John H.
