And, wisdom definately seems to<br/>\n&gt;make a difference with it improving. The easiest way I&#39;ve found to deal<br/>\n&gt;with sense heading is to not waste time on it until you can dump 20 odd<br/>\n&gt;points into it. That usually means around L5 or 6. Then start mashing it<br/>\n&gt;while medding or resting. At least with wisdom casters like my druid and<br/>\n&gt;cleric, this method seems much less painful than I remember it was for<br/>\n&gt;my bard. IIRC, with my bard I used to fish and practice sense heading.<br/>\n&gt;It went up a lot slower and the fishing wasn&#39;t worth the time spent on<br/>\n&gt;it, unlike in beta when not only could fishing be slightly profitable<br/>\n&gt;but you also had a cool social scene around the docks.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hey!
