Yes I&#39;ve led a very<br/>\nsheltered life-but back to my original question-any help would be<br/>\nappreciated- or is there a better weapon out there i should look for-I dont<br/>\nget alot of  play time-most I can play at one stretch is maybe 3-4 hours on<br/>\na night when the little woman is asleep :)- so I cant really do a 10 hour +<br/>\nmarathon.<br/>\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.
