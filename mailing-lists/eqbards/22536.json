The Bard&#39;s offense sucks.  He adds less offense than anything other than, perhaps, a Cleric.  This<br/>\nmakes fights last longer, sucks up more healing mana, and increases the risk level of the encounter (e.g.,<br/>\nit increases the risks of adds).<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  During combat, the Bard can sing offensively oriented songs which add to the capabilities of the melee<br/>\nmembers of his party, or counter the abilities of the MOB, which dereases mana and decreases risk.<br/>\n<br/>\n3.  During downtime, the Bard can sing downtime-reducing songs.  This decreases downtime risk and<br/>\ndecreases downtime itself.  This allows the party to pull stuff faster.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe value of  #2 or #3 is dependent on the party makeup, and the value of #3 is dependent on the<br/>\navailability of MOBs to fight.  (Reduced downtime is not an advantage if you don&#39;t have enough stuff<br/>\naround to take advantage of it.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI would argue that adding a Bard is equivalent to adding from 1/2 to 3 other players depending on the<br/>\nsituation.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is &quot;the situation&quot;.  There are 7 things that high-level Kunark parties need:  1) crowd<br/>\ncontrol, 2) primary healer, 3) a tank, 4) a puller, 5) a group gater (sometimes), 6) a lockpicker<br/>\n(sometimes), 7) secondary healer (sometimes).  The bard can&#39;t do any of these things other than limited<br/>\ncrowd control, or pulling (which doesn&#39;t allow him to play the downtime reducing role), which means that<br/>\nhe doesn&#39;t satisfy any of the core requirements.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis means that any party which is going to attempt anything interesting or challenging has (depending on<br/>\ncharacters available), already filled from 4 to 6 slots before they can consider the luxury of taking a<br/>\nBard.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, sadly, the standard group of:  Enchanter, Cleric, secondary healer, gater/nuker, tank/puller is one<br/>\ngroup that, I would argue, least benefits from having a Bard added to it.  So we&#39;re often relegated to<br/>\ndoing the boring, peripheral stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis happens in my guild a lot:<br/>\nFour players log on:<br/>\nEnchanter LFG, he gets six /gu messages and gets a group immediately.<br/>\nCleric LFG, he gets a few /gu messages and gets a group pretty quickly.<br/>\nBard LFG, he gets a message if something opens up and nobody else is available.<br/>\nPaladin LFG, he sits for 6 hours and gives up.<br/>\n<br/>\nHas nothing to do with the ability of people to play their character, it has to do with character balance.<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantorforjado, 54 songs, Innoruuk<br/>\nThank the gods I&#39;m not a Paladin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJames Schuldes wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; My main points were not about &quot;who&quot; posted the stuff - but more what was<br/>\n&gt; posted:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1) Worried that bards will be LFG because of being &quot;weak&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; * This I think happened and was just recently addressed in ways to help<br/>\n&gt; bards solo and get groups assuming they can realistically mez 2 or 3 mobs<br/>\n&gt; long enough for their group to kill the mobs.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 2) VI seems to have the right intentions (ie wants bards to be wanted in<br/>\n&gt; groups) but does not have the practical experience on how to make this<br/>\n&gt; happen in the game - at least not until players spend a lot of time telling<br/>\n&gt; them that stuff is wrong.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sylly </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
