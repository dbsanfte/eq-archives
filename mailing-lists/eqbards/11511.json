If I had really thought I would get a repsonse I probably would <br/>\nhave given the questions more thought. Below, follows my questions and <br/>\nrepsonses.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Is Lullaby bugged or has it had its effectiveness reduced? I cant seem to<br/>\n<br/>\nkeep low, low greens asleep. I get the head nods message and they continue <br/>\nto attack. From my experience and the posts of other Bards seems like this<br/>\nsong has become almost useless. Is this just something we will have to live <br/>\nwith?<br/>\n<br/>\nREPSONSE - Nothing has changed - though it does lose some of its <br/>\neffectiveness against higher level creatures.<br/>\n<br/>\n******************************************************************<br/>\nMy Comment: I wonder if GZ even read the question? He was not asking about <br/>\nhigher level creatures, but about greens nodding and attacking.<br/>\n******************************************************************<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Disenchanting Melody was implemented with the last patch. However, it <br/>\nremoves all buffs (positive and negative) from the top down. This makes this<br/>\n<br/>\nsong very unpopular as it effects the entire group. Was this an intentional <br/>\ndesign? If so would it be possible to make it a targeted song so as not to <br/>\nremove every buff on the whole team to assist one individual?<br/>\n<br/>\nREPSONSE - This is the design of the song. It is made for when you really <br/>\nneed bad magic stuff removed, and are not really picky about how it goes <br/>\naway.<br/>\n<br/>\n******************************************************************<br/>\nMy comment: It is a shame to wait so long for this song to be fixed to have <br/>\nit be so completely useless. Another song to be moved to the page in my song<br/>\n<br/>\nbook for completely useless songs.<br/>\n******************************************************************<br/>\n<br/>\nWell guys there you have it, according to GZ nothing has changed with <br/>\nLullaby, (Recon he even has a clue as to how bad this song gets resisted.)<br/>\nand Disenchanting Melody appears to be just the way they want it. (For the <br/>\nlife of me, I wish I could see why the could not have made this a targeted <br/>\nsong)<br/>\n<br/>\nJust thought I would share this info with you.<br/>\n<br/>\nTaolas Liteheart<br/>\n*******************************************************************<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn Swiftsong - Karana server<br/>\n<br/>\nEQ Bard Song Analysis<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://rgonzalez.net/EQSongs/\">http://rgonzalez.net/EQSongs/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
