If so, what is done?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Most suggestions I have ever given in Plane raids were dismissed<br/>\n&gt;   as &#39;nah, that wont work&#39; or &#39;people are gonna die, just face it&#39;<br/>\n&gt;   I don&#39;t buy that at all.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   On Innoruuk, they force the bards to stop playing any songs unless<br/>\n&gt;   necessary during pulls.  They also do not let bards in the melee,<br/>\n&gt;   rather they hang back with the casters.  Could be that it&#39;s over-<br/>\n&gt;   protecting an asset, or could be that they don&#39;t realize a bard&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;   full potential.  If you don&#39;t listen or think you have a better<br/>\n&gt;   idea, you are blacklisted.  EQ Politics, yuk!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   My first idea for PoF was... send me in full buffs, full everything.<br/>\n&gt;   Reso, Rune IV, Camo, Invis Animals, Invis Undead, Invis, +AGI, +DEX<br/>\n&gt;   +STR, +STA, Talisman, Guard, buffs buffs buffs buffs.....  Nekkid<br/>\n&gt;   me, with a normal drum, and selo&#39;s memmed, and I haul ass.  Hit the<br/>\n&gt;   ground running, and collect all the mobs and train them away from <br/>\n&gt;   the portal, away from the SE corner, into the middle of nowhere then<br/>\n&gt;   curl up and die.  Immediately following that let everyone zone in<br/>\n&gt;   however they wanted to.  (I&#39;ll leave breaking the plane discussion<br/>\n&gt;   out)  Since I wasn&#39;t L50, that idea was dismissed as bullshit.  To<br/>\n&gt;   this day, I think that sacrifice would still work.  The main problem<br/>\n&gt;   you have upon zoning is a shiverback or scarling sitting there <br/>\n&gt;   pounding the crap out of you, and then your client gives <br/>\n&gt; you control.<br/>\n&gt;   By that time you are dead.  Loading, please wait... to <br/>\n&gt; another Loading,<br/>\n&gt;   please wait.  If a bard could clear that garbage, and avoid a DT<br/>\n&gt;   from Cazic, I think the portal trash would stay clear long enough<br/>\n&gt;   for players to zone in.  This is purely hypothetical as no one <br/>\n&gt;   wanted to listen to little me.  8)   As for pulling, I wish. hehe.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Harmonic.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor <br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Your opinion counts, and we&#39;ll reward you for it!<br/>\n&gt; Win Prizes!
