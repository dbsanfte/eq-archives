Most experienced bards have written it off and<br/>\ndon&#39;t bother adding it to their song list. Add to that the reputation it has<br/>\ngained among non-bards. It seems few consider us a great crowd-control<br/>\nclass, though a well-placed Charm or Pixie can save the day and turn some<br/>\nheads. So if we ever do regain the ability to reliably stop multiple mobs it<br/>\nwill take a long time to convince the veterans to try it and trust it when<br/>\ndeath is on the line.<br/>\n<br/>\nOperaman Overtone<br/>\nHell-bound bard of the 30th Song<br/>\n&lt;Spirit of the Moon&gt;<br/>\nInnoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Kevin L.

Sometime around June.  I think<br/>\nit&#39;s likely that he played during beta (where we all learned to do without<br/>\nHarmony and a few other spells that were broken/not implemented at the<br/>\ntime.).  Because of this he may just never have bothered learning it when he<br/>\ngot the chance in final.

To top all that off most<br/>\nof the sites listing spell effects were just cloning older lists made during<br/>\nbeta.
