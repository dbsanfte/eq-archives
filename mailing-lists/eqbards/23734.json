Started 2 months after it went live.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Cranfill, Wendy&quot; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Yes I believe I said I DID read the whole post.  I know <br/>\n&gt; they will plan to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; downlevel the mobs.  I just hope they actually do it.  It <br/>\n&gt; has nothing to<br/>\n&gt; do<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with loot but everything to do with conquoring challenges.  <br/>\n&gt; I just like<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; challenges to be fair.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I apologize, then.  I am sick of seeing posts (mainly on eqcasters) of<br/>\n&gt; people only seeing the things that upset them and not the <br/>\n&gt; other side.  To me<br/>\n&gt; your post seemed like you did not see the point of tuning <br/>\n&gt; them down.  Again,<br/>\n&gt; I apologize, I must have missed that in your post.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As far as Verant history.  What other choice do you have but <br/>\n&gt; to trust that<br/>\n&gt; they will do what they say?  Not much other than quit.  I <br/>\n&gt; understand not<br/>\n&gt; liking the update, but some poeple get *SO* mad, it scares <br/>\n&gt; me.  This is a<br/>\n&gt; game, nothing more.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I for one, would rather play a slightly &quot;nerfed&quot; EQ, then no <br/>\n&gt; EQ at all.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I still think the BP is overpowered the way it is.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You need to think of what is realistic for the genre not of <br/>\n&gt; what would be<br/>\n&gt; neat.  I wish my druid had a 1200 point DD, just like wizards <br/>\n&gt; wish they<br/>\n&gt; could cast SOW.  Melee wish they could bind/gate.  But those <br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t make<br/>\n&gt; sense.  Neither does such a breastplate.  At least not to me.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am sorry, if offended anyone.  It was not my intent, just <br/>\n&gt; expressing my<br/>\n&gt; views.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Notebender<br/>\n&gt; 9th Bard of Veeshan<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
