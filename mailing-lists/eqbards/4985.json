In each hotkey box we have 6 slots correct?  Now, look<br/>\nat it this way - depending on the situation, I may need 3 of my four<br/>\npossible instruments I also need 2 slots for weapons (dual wield is so<br/>\ncool), in order to switch from my 2 weapons to an instrument I must move my<br/>\nprimary weapon from the primary weapon slot to the empty slot, pick up my<br/>\ninstrument, click on my secondary weapon residing in the secondary slot<br/>\n(thus exchanging the two) and place the weapon into the now empty slot.<br/>\nThis idea has however crossed my mind as a MOB stuns me.  The only possible<br/>\nway to do this would be if Veravt would add 2 slots to the hotkey banks, one<br/>\nfor my 4th instrument (brass when I finally get a song that needs it) and<br/>\nthe other for a second Selo&#39;s key.  Maybe that could be a request on the<br/>\nbard petition?  Give it to all classes.  It can&#39;t hurt the balance of power<br/>\nas I see it.  Just take away one of the banks (leaving 5) and add 2 slots to<br/>\neach remaining bank.  That way everyone could have all of their spells,<br/>\nspecial attacks, whatever in one set and use the other 4 for<br/>\nweapons/instruments or whatever other classes use.
