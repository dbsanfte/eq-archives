I couldn&#39;t at 49.  Chardok is<br/>\nvery underused and getting a pickup group there is normally unlikely at best<br/>\nat any level.  Karnor is difficult - but in the right group - you might be<br/>\nokay.   I did the Dog tower at about that level.  They had a really good<br/>\ngroup with cleric and enchanter - and basically told me to stand back and be<br/>\ncareful what I sang to not agro the mobs enough to become a target.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAgain - I think your odds of getting a pickup group are low - and it will<br/>\nbe risky.  However if you have a pre-made group that wants you - rock on -<br/>\nand hope for the best!<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: James Schuldes [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, January 23, 2001 1:37 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] OT Complete heal (was Numbers on Bards)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; after all i was crowd control as well and other then a bad streak of<br/>\n </span></blockquote>resists<br/>\ncompared to usual i was doing just fine...  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel is God, AC is King, Resist Stats are your best friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry, imho, 47 is &quot;too low&quot; for Karnors, Seb and Chardok.

Yes, you can go there and yes,<br/>\nyou can do some stuff but don&#39;t be surprized if others are picked to join<br/>\ngroups before you.  It has nothing to do with player skill, very little to<br/>\ndo with class specific issues.  It&#39;s purely a level thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
