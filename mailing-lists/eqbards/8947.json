I decided to go see<br/>\n&gt; if I could kill some hill giants in W Commons and while looking ran<br/>\n&gt; across Kizdean Gix. He attacked dispite being 20 odd levels below me and<br/>\n&gt; I fired up chains intending to chain and fear him. Hmm. 8 resists in a<br/>\n&gt; row. After killing him and determining there weren&#39;t any hill giants in<br/>\n&gt; the zone, I happened to spot some big wisp spawns and killed them.<br/>\n&gt; Again, wisps were resisting chains like crazy. Have resist rates gone up<br/>\n&gt; on chains lately? I don&#39;t remember having near this much trouble last<br/>\n&gt; time I played my bard. My druid can get snare to stick on reds with more<br/>\n&gt; reliability than this.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt;   Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n&gt;             GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n&gt;                  b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a> with the subject lol.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
