I usually twist Accelerando right after a charm, regardless of<br/>\nwhether it sticks or not.  I&#39;ve learned the hard way that you DO NOT want<br/>\nthat Accel to come down.  On the plus side, I didn&#39;t get hit once during the<br/>\nencounter.  I suspect that you are correct in stating I got very lucky the<br/>\nfirst time (or very unlucky the second time - who knows).
