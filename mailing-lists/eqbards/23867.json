Umm ok that&#39;s real efficient, especially considering<br/>\nthat the shaman that is not primary healer since we had a cleric, was also<br/>\nwanting the mana song... But wait there&#39;s more, this same shaman was also<br/>\ntrying to convince us that his haste wasnt as good as the bard one.  I said<br/>\nbabye people...  quickly found another group and had a nice/non-aggresive<br/>\nchat with the cleric in my former group, she was quite nice and didnt like<br/>\nit that i left...  What really got me was the paladin that brought up the<br/>\nwhole thing kept on going on and on that he also had a 57 chanter and a 43<br/>\nbard. I told him to log them in if he thought he could do a better job then<br/>\nme.  Whats even funnier was the small pickup group i got right afterwards<br/>\nwas amazed at what i was doing (charm fighting) and kept on wishing the<br/>\npaladin in the live cappy would stop shouting for a bard/chanter every 5<br/>\nseconds.<br/>\n<br/>\nI for one will start being very short fused when it comes to song requests<br/>\nnow and will not hesitate to leave groups without warning.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t let it get to you too much halana...<br/>\n<br/>\nMinkin<br/>\n49 bard<br/>\nAnnoyed Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Cranfill, Wendy [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Wendy_Cranfill@...\">Wendy_Cranfill@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: February 20, 2001 12:36 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] &quot;Shouldn&#39;t you be playing Manasong!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, it finally happened to me.  I haven&#39;t played in a lot of pickup<br/>\ngroups, but have done a bit.  And until now, I&#39;ve not heard this phrase<br/>\nuttered.  I thought I had escaped it.  But noooooooooo... the pickup group I<br/>\ngot last night was the WORST I&#39;ve had in EQ that I can remember.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayers: Bardette, Monk, Ranger, Paladin, Shaman, Wizard (all between 43 and<br/>\n45)<br/>\nScene: Solb<br/>\n<br/>\nThe wizard &quot;Shouldn&#39;t you be playing manasong?&quot;... me... &quot;uh, I am&quot;...<br/>\nher...&quot;well just play it all the time&quot;.... me ... &quot;nope&quot;... her... &quot;well you<br/>\naren&#39;t a very good bard are you?&quot;... me... &quot;nope&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe paladin &quot;Tani, you need to play regen now&quot;... me ... &quot;well this song<br/>\ndoes both so just sit tight&quot;... her...&quot;well i want to regen first then get<br/>\nmana&quot; ... me.. &quot;that&#39;s nice&quot;...<br/>\n<br/>\nOk so I was a little sarcastic, but I wont even get into the pulling<br/>\ntechniques used by the ranger... Needless to say, I took the advice of<br/>\nsomeone here and with a &quot;OMG I think my roommate just dropped something bad<br/>\n.. heard a crash have to go check it out&quot;..
