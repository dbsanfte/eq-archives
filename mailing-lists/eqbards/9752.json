At","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1323097867\">Unfortunately, you run into these types of people sometimes.  One time,<br/>\nbefore I got my black silk gloves, I was in MM and auctioned that I needed a<br/>\npair.  At the time I only had 5PP in cash on me.  I had put the rest in the<br/>\nbank to avoid the extra weight.  My earlier experiences in Lower Guk had led<br/>\nme to believe that most people would just let you loot the quest components<br/>\nif they didn&#39;t need them.  Thats how I got my shin greaves and gauntlets.  A<br/>\nfew minutes after I auctioned, someone announced a pair was available in the<br/>\ngraveyard.  I was the only bard in MM at the time.  I went to the graveyard<br/>\nand told the guy all I had on me was 5PP.  He told me that wasn&#39;t enough<br/>\nmoney to get the gloves.  Enough time had passed where I could have looted<br/>\nthe corpse had I wanted to( but I wouldn&#39;t have stooped that low).  This guy<br/>\nhad that covered though because the whole time I was talking to him, he was<br/>\nlooting the corpse so no one else could loot it.  I told him that I was the<br/>\nonly bard in MM and that all I had was 5PP, he could take it or leave it.<br/>\nHe decided to continue looting the corpse until it disappeared to ensure<br/>\nthat I didn&#39;t get the gloves without paying him.  The guy wasn&#39;t smart<br/>\nenough to figure out that 5PP was better than nothing at all.  To say the<br/>\nleast, I told him not to expect my help if he was ever in a bind.  That was<br/>\none more person added to my /ignore list.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; When I was in Cazic Thule the other day I was waiting on my group to get<br/>\n&gt; there. I went over near the<br/>\n&gt; Gorilla spawn because that&#39;s where I was going to hunt with my group.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There was another group there and I role-played asking them if I could<br/>\n&gt; loot a mudwater Rune from a<br/>\n&gt; Fanatic if that got one as I needed it to complete a quest.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; They rudely said no only if you pay us 100PP for loot rights. I politely<br/>\n&gt; left the area and said<br/>\n&gt; thank you but that was to high.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I know the argument of &quot;there killing it, it&#39;s there loot.&quot; but if you<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t need it don&#39;t loot it.<br/>\n&gt; Or charge a reasonable price to loot it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Was it going to kill them to help someone out?<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
