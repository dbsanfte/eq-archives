In addition to cold based protection, it acts as a fireshield for <br/>\n&gt; everybody in the group. Everytime a monster hits you, they get damage done <br/>\n&gt; to them, at lvl 40 the damage is 6. Great song while fighting multiple <br/>\n&gt; monsters, and is in someways better than discord since it doesnt concentrate <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is *great* to know!
