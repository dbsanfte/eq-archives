My songs affect an entire group, I&#39;d like to have a group of<br/>\npeople.  :)  I tried to do up to the mid 30&#39;s in Cazic.  After I spent about<br/>\nthe equivalent time of travelling from Cazic to Firona and back twice,<br/>\neither lfg or doing a /w and only seeing 2 other people in the zone (high<br/>\nlevel farmers, usually), I gave up, and went back to Kunark.<br/>\n<br/>\nAtonal<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Adam Wasserman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wassermana@...\">wassermana@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, February 27, 2001 2:32 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Re: Bard% was (Patch message)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nokies, For the second time, Solon&#39;s Charismatic Concord is a +cha buff, not<br/>\na faction song.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout my earlier comment, perhaps I was a bit harsh. I tend to exagerate<br/>\nwhen I argue. I apologize for offending anyone and I don&#39;t mean to come off<br/>\nas saying my opinion is the only valid one. Perhaps I need to refine my<br/>\nopinion to what I actually mean, which is... this song has no place being<br/>\nsung during combat.<br/>\n<br/>\nAtonal, I&#39;ve read many of your posts and I believe that you are a damn good<br/>\nbard. And I respect your decision to wait on getting the mask. (that&#39;s what<br/>\nI did too) The ring is found in Solussek A, drops off the Goblin High Shaman<br/>\nand should still be an exp camp for you. I&#39;ve never ever seen anyone else in<br/>\nthat room and I hunted in Sol A for over 10 levels. The exp is amazing, it&#39;s<br/>\ncompletely empty and it&#39;s a lot of fun, I suggest going. Getting a cold<br/>\nstone takes seconds, you usually only need to ask. I&#39;m very rarely in a zone<br/>\nthat has no mages and they are usually very happy to be able to help. If<br/>\nyou&#39;re grouped, usually at least one of the party is a caster. At your<br/>\nlevel, those casters ought to have a spell to enhance your vision, so ask<br/>\nfor it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile you don&#39;t *NEED* to ask for it when you have a song that does the same<br/>\nthing, wasting a third of your resources on it to salvage some pride or to<br/>\nsave some effort in asking is foolish in my opinion. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m a half elf also. I&#39;ve never had trouble seeing. Guess I&#39;m lucky. On top<br/>\nof that, I have my masks, and have attained level 14 so I can use them.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, Concord CAN be used, but that doesn&#39;t make it useful. Once again, in my<br/>\nopinion, the uses for this song are too few and too far between to make it<br/>\nworthwhile. I would argue (vehemently if forced) that Psalm of Warmth (level<br/>\n25) or Psalm of Cooling (level 33) or Shauri&#39;s Sonorus Clouding (level 19)<br/>\nare all more useful than Concord. Warmth gives Infravision which should be<br/>\nmore than sufficient for any night blind race and it also grants a damage<br/>\nshield AND ac. Cooling does the same as warmth only it gives ultravision and<br/>\nSonorus Clouding grants invis and see invis. Giving me a song whose only<br/>\nunique ability is to track invis mobs is silly.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways, I apologize for my comments which were off base and unnecessarily<br/>\nharsh.<br/>\n<br/>\nDraelon<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Windleaf Mistsong [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:windleaf@...\">windleaf@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, February 27, 2001 1:38 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Re: Bard% was (Patch message)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 01:14 PM 2/27/01 -0500, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;ANY bard that is wasting a song slot to sing this should be booted.
