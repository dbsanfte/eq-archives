I tried it soon<br/>\nafter Accel stopped breaking root - Chain would break root,<br/>\nbut the root icon would remain.  So you wouldn&#39;t be rooted<br/>\nanymore, but Accel would not take hold until the root icon<br/>\ndisappeared. That was over a month ago so it&#39;s possible it has<br/>\nbeen changed again.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
