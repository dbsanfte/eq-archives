If I recall<br/>\ncorrectly - the impression that this was being done - was from a post from a<br/>\nNecro board of a log of program that claimed they were reading this.  Has<br/>\nanyone here verified this?<br/>\n<br/>\nSmedly claimed that this was false...<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Smedly claimed all they did (and I thought Kevin Crawford verified this)<br/>\nis that they run a Win32API call to see what active process were and what&#39;s<br/>\nin memory.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf this is all Verant is doing - I&#39;m not so sure I have a problem with this.<br/>\nI don&#39;t want them reading my hard drive - there is a chance for properitary<br/>\ninfo.  Hypothetically there&#39;s a chance that (say you had a word processor<br/>\ndoc running) that proprietary info is in memory - but that&#39;s kind of a<br/>\nstretch.  Plus - if you were really concerned about it - you chould just be<br/>\ncareful to shut everything down before starting EQ (I do this anyway to<br/>\nconserve memory).<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m curious what others think about this.  Again - no scanning of file -<br/>\nsimply checking memory and active processes.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s kind of silly about this - is how hard is it to change the name of<br/>\nthe program?  Couldn&#39;t you even code the program to generate a random<br/>\nprocess name everytime you ran?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd isn&#39;t there a REALLY simple solution to thsi?  Couldn&#39;t Verant encrypt<br/>\ntheir packets?  Perhaps this additional overhead would negatively impact<br/>\nperformance - but I&#39;d think if they are clever enough they could come up<br/>\nwith something that would make it really hard for these programs.<br/>\nEspecially since they could subtly change the algorhtym ever time they<br/>\npatch..<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde (another RL computer geek)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
