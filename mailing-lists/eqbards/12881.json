I&#39;ve been lurking here for a while, and thought I&#39;d post on a<br/>\n&gt; subject that&#39;s been troubling me lately: the incompatability of enchanters and<br/>\n&gt; bards.  Are there any other two classes in the game that work together as<br/>\n&gt; poorly as these two?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Actually, I love Enchanters.  Give me a Cleric and an Enchanter and (for the most part) I really don&#39;t<br/>\nmuch care how the party gets rounded out.  Our crowd control is a poor second to the Enchanter&#39;s, and we<br/>\nhave to devote full time to it if it falls on us; I&#39;d much rather have the Enchanter do it.  If you&#39;re<br/>\nhigh enough level to sing Mana Song, and the Enchanter can cast Clarity, you have mana coming out your<br/>\nears.  Nothing like more than one column of buffs before you start singing anything!  Heck, you can even<br/>\ntank for a bunch of casters if it comes to that (and I&#39;ve done it a few times).  (Of course, their pets<br/>\nare usually better than I am...)<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 38 songs, Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
