Looks great and if weight is an issue it will<br/>\nhelp alot. Yes the armor is NICE to have..I persoanlly wear a combo of<br/>\ncharred plate and bronze right now, but i have so many strength enhancers it<br/>\nisnt even funny! As a young bard the above items will be abit above your<br/>\nlevel for now..but well within the grasp of a rich bard..so get your mage to<br/>\nsupport you (LOL). Good luck to you Melaniel.
