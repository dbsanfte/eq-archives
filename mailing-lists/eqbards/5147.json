We only started having this problem when they patched<br/>\n&gt; the the Missed Notes on high level songs last patch.

It is my<br/>\npersonal opinion that Verant may be nerfing casters silently.  This is<br/>\nparticularly noticable on your earlier songs/spells where you very rarely<br/>\nfizzle. miss a not or are interrupted.  As of last night my level 17<br/>\nmagician on a full bar of mana in combat fizzle twice and was interrupted<br/>\nfive or six times while trying to cast shock of blades.  Please not that<br/>\nShock of Blades is a lvl 8 DD spell that I have been using since I got it.<br/>\nMy skill is maxed for my level.  So this may be a nerf for casters which I<br/>\nthink it might be,  I would not put it past Verant for nerfing something<br/>\nwithout telling us at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nTreilanin Loreweaver Level 22 Bard<br/>\nAariel lvl 17 Magician<br/>\nHonour Guard, Karana </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
