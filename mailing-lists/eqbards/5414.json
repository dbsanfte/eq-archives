One","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-418653668\">By all means keep the crested spalders they are a high level item and =<br/>\nfor you to have it at level 18 is great it&#39;s worth a lot more then a bs =<br/>\nmantle. One other thing I suggest you do is get another pair of bronze =<br/>\nbracers the ac to weight ratio is actually extremly great for bronze =<br/>\nprobably the best bronze pieces you can buy. If anything don&#39;t get arms =<br/>\nas a bracer has better ac and less weight then the arms. Anyway just =<br/>\nsome suggesitons.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeaumin Level 7 Wood Elf Bard<br/>\nNaeeldar Dark Elf Necromancer of the 35th Level<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday, as I was about to Log off for the night A level 2 Enchanter =<br/>\nwas offering 30pp for a Sow at the Qeynos Gates.  I gave him a tell and =<br/>\nwas offered 100pp to take him from Qeynos to Rivervale to be twinked =<br/>\nthere by his level 50 char :).  Of course I accepted the offer and we =<br/>\nran down to Rivervale, in the end he died once and had to take the boat =<br/>\nback across the Ocean from Erudin but eventually we got there safely and =<br/>\nI was 100pp richer.<br/>\nToday, as a further reward for my services the player logged on as his =<br/>\nlevel 50 cleric and asked me to meet him at the Freeport Bank.  When I =<br/>\narrived he gave me the following for my help previously: A pair of =<br/>\nBronze Bracers, Elf Hide Gloves, Crested Spaulders.  I promptly thanked =<br/>\nhim and he left saying thanks.  As he was leaving a level 50 warrior in =<br/>\nthe bank was selling a Jagged Band for 50pp, so I telled him and =<br/>\npurchased my new peice of jewelery immediately.  I then sold my old =<br/>\nAmber ring, the 2 bronze bracers (too heavy for their ac), and my old =<br/>\nRusty Spiked shoulders to a Bard friend of mine for 40pp.  After that I =<br/>\nmet the Cleric again and he needed help buying spells for his Enchanter =<br/>\nat the Caster Guild because everyone was dubious to him.  I helped him =<br/>\nthere and once again thanked him for his earlier gifts.  So now, I am =<br/>\nwondering   if The Crested Spaulders ac:11 +6sta are good for me to use, =<br/>\nor maybe I can trade it for things like A pair of Golden Amber earrings, =<br/>\na Second Jagged band, Bloodstained Mantle, A runed Bone Fork etc.  I am =<br/>\nhappy with my current Dual Weilding of a Barbed Leather whip and Dragoon =<br/>\ndirk, so I think that Armor is the way to go.<br/>\nAny help in this subject would be wonderful.<br/>\n<br/>\nGleeman, bard of the 18th song - Karana<br/>\nThe luckiest Bard in Norrath.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
