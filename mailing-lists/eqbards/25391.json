I&#39;ve always enjoyed talking to you Talani,<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t mean anything personally.  Besides, this list is dead <br/>\n&gt; at least we<br/>\n&gt; are talking.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We had only 1 shaman for a long time, but he is insane.  If <br/>\n&gt; we had 6 he<br/>\n&gt; would not know what to do.  They have 2 now, to ease his pain <br/>\n&gt; somewhat.<br/>\n&gt; I was not bored with my bard, if you are referring to me.  I was not<br/>\n&gt; bored with the game, I was going through a strange time in my life, I<br/>\n&gt; quit because of RL not the game.  I was only 59, so I still had a long<br/>\n&gt; bit of exp&#39;ing to do, which is when bards are useful and fun.  If I<br/>\n&gt; could go back, I would have left for those 10 weeks and not <br/>\n&gt; deleted, but<br/>\n&gt; I didn&#39;t think I would ever play again, and deleting was a <br/>\n&gt; way to ensure<br/>\n&gt; that (guess it didn&#39;t work).  I play for fun and casually <br/>\n&gt; now, I do not<br/>\n&gt; want 60 nor be in AL again, I can not and do not want to raid <br/>\n&gt; 6 nights a<br/>\n&gt; week for 7 hours a night.  I can raid for less, the only <br/>\n&gt; quais-mandatory<br/>\n&gt; raids (you can&#39;t really force someone to come eh?) are the 2 nights of<br/>\n&gt; clearing North ToV, but then I would be where I left, the <br/>\n&gt; bottom of the<br/>\n&gt; totem pole, which is not a good thing to be in AL.  It&#39;s not <br/>\n&gt; for casual<br/>\n&gt; players.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; At the time I quit there were 4 bards in the guild: me, Thott, Jaco,<br/>\n&gt; Syren all 60 but me hehe.  As of a week ago, there was 1 <br/>\n&gt; bard, Thott.  I<br/>\n&gt; quit, Syren moved and had no ISP for 4 months, and Jaco quit <br/>\n&gt; because he<br/>\n&gt; was tired of being in the buff group.  So for 4 months AL had 1 bard<br/>\n&gt; (Syren just came back this week).  If bards were as needed as many<br/>\n&gt; think, would AL of all guilds only have 1 bard for 4 months and have<br/>\n&gt; accomplished what they have?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Shada/Erisi<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Cranfill, Wendy [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Wendy_Cranfill@...\">Wendy_Cranfill@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Friday, August 24, 2001 9:13 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] Be very afraid....<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; owie =/<br/>\n&gt; hehe<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well I can see your points Shada, but I have to also say that <br/>\n&gt; I still do<br/>\n&gt; believe Bards are useful on raids.  People say shaman are useful on<br/>\n&gt; raids..<br/>\n&gt; sure, 3 shaman are, but 6?  If there are 6 shaman on our raids I just<br/>\n&gt; sit<br/>\n&gt; there and play Diablo on my other comp. (Hope nobody from my guild is<br/>\n&gt; reading this!)  And again, I haven&#39;t played a bard on 40+ <br/>\n&gt; person raids.<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; do know that our main Necro switched to the bard character of someone<br/>\n&gt; who<br/>\n&gt; had left the game (Iridis), and he is constantly amazed at <br/>\n&gt; how much more<br/>\n&gt; useful bards are than necros in group raids.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; *shrug*<br/>\n&gt; Maybe its that we all just get bored after a while?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Halana/Tani<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
