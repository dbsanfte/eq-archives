I did 1-10 because its late, but any info<br/>\nyou can pass along would be great.  The URL will give you a zipped excel<br/>\nfile (its 5 kB in size - I made the not-unreasonable assumption that if<br/>\nyou&#39;re playing EQ you&#39;ve got access to the Office suite).  I will convert it<br/>\nto HTML when its finished since I refuse to use FrontPage or another MS html<br/>\ntool. Try it: saving the exact same file via excel&#39;s horrible toHTML<br/>\nconverter resulted in a 872 kB file.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.erols.com/gww6e/stacked-songs.zip\">http://www.erols.com/gww6e/stacked-songs.zip</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI have a grandiose idea that it could also incorporate the best song to<br/>\ntwist with and the third voice to weave in as well should you feel inclined.<br/>\nObviously this changes with level, so an idea would be to have a simple<br/>\njavascript or layer thingy that when you clicked on the diagonal the<br/>\nappropriate dancing partners where illuminated, but that&#39;s a ways off since<br/>\nthe chart isn&#39;t even complete. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nLastly, I&#39;m trying to think of a cute little name for it all.  Ideas so far<br/>\ninclude Tuning Chart, Transposed Chart, Setlist, Playlist, The EQ Top 50.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks all.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
