If they did you could nod a single mob and it would never break out<br/>\nunless it resisted (R).  It would stay forever nodded as long as you got at<br/>\nleast an r.  This isn&#39;t the case.  I was firing just Lullaby with no attacks<br/>\ncoming my way, no lag, and ping of about 100.  The result vs a level 1 mob<br/>\n(large rat) was that it could get a secondary resist and attack even though<br/>\nit failed the very first resist totally.  Might be more like Nr = NN , Nrr =<br/>\nNNR.  I&#39;ll have to check the logfile again to be sure, can&#39;t play tonite so<br/>\nwill have to post on Monday what I find.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, January 28, 2000 11:47 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Looks like Lullaby is broken<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy group derailed a train at the zone in Mistmoore last night<br/>\nwhile ressing people at the zone.

It would seem my<br/>\ncharisma is high enough that I&#39;ve hit the 5% cap, at least<br/>\nagainst these low level mobs.  This is about what I&#39;d expect<br/>\nconsidering 154 is pretty high by anyone&#39;s standards.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Secondary resists (r) are not working as GZ said.  During<br/>\nthe Lullaby test, he said the chance of a secondary resist<br/>\nranged from 25% to 35% (against L1 and even /con mobs<br/>\nrespectively - I finally read the log :), modified by<br/>\ncharisma.  I&#39;m getting roughly 50% secondary resists against<br/>\ngreen mobs, higher against low blues, which would indicate<br/>\nsomething is broken.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think the mobs buffed themselves with magic resist<br/>\nsince their chance of a primary resist was at the 5%<br/>\ncap.  The dark ritualist pet that was summoned after someone<br/>\nkilled the first one (neat trick that :) most certainly wasn&#39;t<br/>\nbuffed in any way, yet still had a secondary resist rate of<br/>\n57%.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
