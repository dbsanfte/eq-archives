The constructive discussions and John Kim&#39;s thorough testing have<br/>\nmade the difficult job of being a bard in EverQuest less difficult.<br/>\nHowever, I do believe that I will take my leave of it for a while, at least<br/>\nuntil the expansion comes out.  I simply don&#39;t need the kind of bile quoted<br/>\nbelow in my inbox on Monday morning.<br/>\n<br/>\nHarmonic, you&#39;re rude.  Many of your posts are condescending and arrogant<br/>\nand you damage the signal to noise ratio of the list in my opinion.  You<br/>\nmake personal attacks such as &quot;You forgot to take your medicine today.&quot; and<br/>\nyou call other players (myself included) fools and worse for having opinions<br/>\nthat differ from yours.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour opinion regarding all-caps being used to highlight a word in a sentence<br/>\nis WELL known.  It does not, however, reflect general Internet usage.  The<br/>\nmajority of the Internet is not likely to bend itself to your will, so it&#39;s<br/>\nprobably in your best interest to attempt to overcome your prejudice of this<br/>\nparticular nuance of written Internet communications.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, thanks to all of the posters (Harmonic included) on this list that<br/>\nhave contributed to my understanding of being a bard in EverQuest.  I hope<br/>\nthat I&#39;ve given some insights as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nSee you in Kunark.<br/>\n<br/>\n[50 Bard] Crier (Half Elf) &lt;Seekers of Norrath&gt; ZONE: work<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Ryan Honeyman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:honeyman@...\">honeyman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   You remind me a lot of myself when I started posting here.<br/>\n&gt;   Have to prove everyone wrong.  Have to be all-knowing.  Except,<br/>\n&gt;   Shada, I always am all-knowing with her.  I mean how smart can<br/>\n&gt;   a female woodelf be?  /chuckle<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Plus, anyone who cannot make their point without capitalizing a<br/>\n&gt;   word in every sentance REALLY is irritating because it LOOKS like<br/>\n&gt;   you are SHOUTING at someone because you are ANGRY.  It&#39;s the equivalent<br/>\n&gt;   of debating with someone over a topic and then resorting to voice<br/>\n&gt;   escalation to flood your point across.  The best debates I receive<br/>\n&gt;   come from: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhenders@...\">jhenders@...</a> and <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>.  They use<br/>\n&gt;   proper grammar, they can spell, and they never ever raise their<br/>\n&gt;   voice (so to speak) in the emails.  Sometimes, I wish I could have<br/>\n&gt;   the composure they do.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Need to break out my procmail filters again, and run my eqbards mail<br/>\n&gt;   through a program that to_lowers everything   /sigh  =(<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Harm.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Ryan Honeyman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:honeyman@...\">honeyman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; And no, I don&#39;t have to prove everyone wrong.

Man, you need to stop<br/>\n&gt;   reading into these posts.  So far you&#39;ve done it several times, and<br/>\n&gt;   John(tm) even had to make a comment on it.  You forgot to take your<br/>\n&gt;   medicine today.  How about not jumping all over people on the list?<br/>\n&gt;   Since you&#39;ve been here, you&#39;ve done nothing but argue unproductively.<br/>\n&gt;   If you&#39;ve played since Beta 2, we are happy for you, others here have<br/>\n&gt;   as well.  You flaunt your knowledge as if you designed the game.<br/>\n&gt;   Senior Guide on whatever server or not, I would just chill out and<br/>\n&gt;   try to be helpful.
