This<br/>\nthing nails me at least 60 times an hour. In combat I often twist 3 songs,<br/>\nWarsong, DDD, Chains. If there is very little lag I tend to hit Warsong just<br/>\nas it is coming down. What is happening is that the server indicates that it<br/>\nis coming down. The client then indicates that it is going back up. The<br/>\nserver, thinking that the client is trying to cheat or something, demands<br/>\nthat it is coming down and drops the song effect. (okay, so that&#39;s not<br/>\nexactly what it is thinking. :)<br/>\n\tWhen I get this a lot I often switch to a 4 song rotation to ensure that<br/>\nthe first song is down for a few seconds before it has a chance of coming<br/>\nback up. Sure, I am not under the influence of Warsong for about 3 seconds<br/>\nbut that is better than not being effected for 10 seconds.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWorst song effect to have this happen: Selo&#39;s :)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tGood Journey<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tSineras Silverlyre, The Divine Alliance (Cazic-Thule)<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: John Tatsukawa [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jht@...\">jht@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, January 05, 2000 3:13 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Twisting bug?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve noticed the following recently while twisting songs.
