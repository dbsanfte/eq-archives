HBC&#39;s are going for 15k on my<br/>\nserver =/<br/>\n<br/>\nout of all my raids, i only cashed in points on my selo&#39;s drum (i got a<br/>\ndragonbone bracer as well, but before we instituted the points system).<br/>\nthere are 4 or 5 horns in the treasury as no one even wants to use 1 point<br/>\non them.  i figure if something in expansion is worth getting a horn, there<br/>\nwill be one available.  i am saving up to get in on a CoF/RBB lotto, but it<br/>\nmay never happen as a few people have a lot more points than me.  but if i<br/>\nput in my time, and the rules think a bard is worthy of being in the lotto<br/>\n(it says melee before others in the rules, so that includes bards), and i<br/>\nhave the points, then i will go in on the lotto.<br/>\n<br/>\nyou&#39;re lucky, i had to sweat out getting a lot of my equipment.  now it&#39;s<br/>\nall the bards who go on these raids with me around who have it easy, getting<br/>\nstuff by default.<br/>\n<br/>\nif you get what&#39;s on your wish list, you&#39;ll have the highest bard AC i have<br/>\nbeen able to find from asking around .  should put you at 820+ at least.<br/>\nwithout a shield of course.  with a shield and the best he could find, a<br/>\nmonk in our guild has gotten to 1070/1000 AC.<br/>\n<br/>\nShada Powa, L50 Wood Elf Bard<br/>\nTyria Sarkin, L45 High Elf Wizard<br/>\n&lt;Afterlife&gt; Mithaniel Marr Server<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hooded black cloak, crested spaulders and runed lava pendant <br/>\n&gt; are currently<br/>\n&gt; on my want list.  Was considering diamondines, but they&#39;re <br/>\n&gt; hella hard to<br/>\n&gt; come by it seems (too lazy to camp them myself) and if I did <br/>\n&gt; get any, I&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; probably give them to my monk first.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve been very fortunate in my equipment, in that 90% of the <br/>\n&gt; time I&#39;m the<br/>\n&gt; only bard around.  I&#39;ve never really had to worry about loot <br/>\n&gt; squabbles, I<br/>\n&gt; tend to get items mainly because nobody else is there to claim them.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Elwyn </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
