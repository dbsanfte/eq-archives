One day I was really bored and decided to do the Shining<br/>\nStar of Light quest.  Sure its Cleric/Paladin only, but what they heck I<br/>\nfigured, maybe I could get something for it.  Time goes by and it starts to<br/>\ngather dust.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne day while running to Quenos I see an auction in N. Karana..<br/>\n...&quot;For trade, Polished Granite Tomahawk, Mistmoor Battle Drums&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy heart skipped a beat and quickly went dead when I realized that I was a)<br/>\nbroke and b) probally not going to have anything a Level 50 Druid would<br/>\nwant, but being a masochist I sent her a tell.  Polite snickering could be<br/>\nenvisioned as I went from offering a few things, to all my bronze etc. Still<br/>\nno deal.<br/>\n<br/>\nA while later I remember my SSOL.  I propose it to her as &quot;Im sure you<br/>\nprobally wont be interested, but if you have a Cleric/Paladin friend, maybe<br/>\nthey would like this..&quot;  Remarkably she replies that the SSOL is indeed an<br/>\nitem of worth and while she doesnt need it, she will check with her guild.<br/>\n(Translation to me: I ask, but probally no).<br/>\n<br/>\nThree days go by and I see her online, &quot;Hello, I am the Bard who spoke with<br/>\nyou the other day.  I was curious if you had spoken with your guild, and if<br/>\nyou would like to trade the Drums for the SSOL.&quot;  ..I then began to await<br/>\nthe rejection.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut lo and behold she said she would trade!  We met in the W. Commonland<br/>\nDruid ring and traded.  I equipped it, and ZOOOOM!!!!! Off I went, wow, I am<br/>\nstill amazed at the speed.  At 13 I can outrun people in JBOOTS, and have<br/>\noutrun people with SOW.  Its absolutely amazing how much ground I can get.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, thats my tale.. hope it was entertaining.<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. To date I have been able to save myself and 3 other people in<br/>\nsituations where SELO alone wouldnt have done it.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
