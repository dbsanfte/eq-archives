A little<br/>\ntedious, but better than no<br/>\nexp!  I fear/chained Terrorantula last night, even.  Note:  Fear has such a<br/>\nsmall radius, that you have to<br/>\nstand right *under* this spider to make it work.  ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n-----<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been soloing the giant skels and drakes in Rathe Mtns using the chains, <br/>\nfear, DDD combo.  Works great as long as you dont lose track of your timing. <br/>\n  Im thinking of trying it on cyclops, just to see if I can.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve also been playing around with charm on the giant skels.  (Never had the <br/>\nguts to try it before now)  After watching a bard charming HG&#39;s solo, (first <br/>\ntime I&#39;ve ever seen this done) it inspired me to attempt it.  I do, however <br/>\nsee one major problem with this: He is constantly training other people in <br/>\nthe zone. Very not cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a side note, I grouped up with a necro in my guild and we killed cyclops <br/>\nnon stop.  I played hymn for him while he had his call of bones spell up, <br/>\nand he was never out of mana.  DDD stacks with the necro DoT&#39;s, and his pet <br/>\nwould just cut through them like a hot knife through warm butter. Would have <br/>\nlike to try that on hill giants.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Treehugger and Songmaker<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
