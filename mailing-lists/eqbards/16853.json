I was in Mistmoore this weekend too and it was CRAZY!  I never<br/>\nfought there with my shaman and I&#39;m really enjoying myself (despite the<br/>\nmultiple deaths) because the whacked out pathing makes it challenging.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnly advice I have is get a druid to group wtih you.  Once they cast that<br/>\ndamage shield on you, the mobs don&#39;t give a FIG about you!

I like to keep Selos going<br/>\n(with drum) in case one of the clockwork trains catches us and we have to<br/>\nzone (in fact the warriors were routinly /following me during breaks just in<br/>\ncase). One thing I noticed was if something spawned or someone else pulled<br/>\nsomething it headed right for me even if they started wacking it before it<br/>\narrived to begin pummeling me.
