Yes I was enjoying role-playing<br/>\nrunning around with my bow which I will now destroy.  So why are there<br/>\ntwo-handed weapons available since release that are bard equippable?  How<br/>\nabout instruments that are All/All.  If this is a &#39;bug fix&#39;, it&#39;s a stupid<br/>\none.  Fixing this bug had exactly one effect, a bard could no longer run<br/>\naround with a bow in his hand.  Had there been arrows there would have been<br/>\nexactly two effects, you could no longer role-play with your ranger buddies<br/>\nasking what good this silly bow thing was and could they show you how to use<br/>\nit right.  A perfect example of removing something that only added fun to<br/>\nthe game.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Jeffrey Sue [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jsue@...\">jsue@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, June 29, 2000 4:02 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] patch message<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 01:31 PM 6/29/00 -0600, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Another Patch message item about Bards.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Fixed the icon for the Spectral Bow.
