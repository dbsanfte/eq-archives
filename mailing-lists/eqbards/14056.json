I do not know where it starts or the details, try<br/>\nlooking it up on the web.  You can also kill the heritics somewhere in Tox.<br/>\n It is a nice looking plate, too bad the dwarven ringmail tunic has better<br/>\nstats =(<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 04:59 PM 1/28/00 -0600, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Corey de Danann&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:corey@...\">corey@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I hope this isn&#39;t too off topic.  I was hoping to do this quest but can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;get my faction high enough with the Deepwater Knights in Erudin to get the<br/>\n&gt;Guild master to give me the quest or any other quest for that matter.  I<br/>\n&gt;used the Charismatic Carillon to get me up to indifferent but that is as<br/>\n&gt;High as I can go.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I also looked to see if there were any other ways to raise my faction but<br/>\n&gt;could only find the Odus Pearl quest which raises faction with the Knights.<br/>\n&gt;Unfortunately, it is given by the same guy in the guild and needs a<br/>\n&gt;container he gives you to complete it.  Again, he won&#39;t talk to me about any<br/>\n&gt;quests.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Kitasi, you are the king of quests from what I hear, maybe you know what I<br/>\n&gt;can do.  Or if, in fact it is a lost cause.  Anyone who has any info can<br/>\n&gt;share, not just Kit.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Llyrean<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;GET A NEXTCARD VISA, in 30 seconds.
