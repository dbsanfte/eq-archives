By the time you get to that level a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; few months down the road, the expansion will likely be out.  Lets say in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; expansion Verant raises the level cap to 75.  So by the time us non 45+<br/>\n&gt; &gt; people get to 45th level, the current level 50s will be fastly approaching<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 75.

They will be wearing Planes Armor, they will have Planes Weapons, they will<br/>\nbe playing Planes Instruments.  And I will not be able to get any of those items.  Why?  Because either:<br/>\na) the levels of those areas will be increased, or b) a ton of level 60-75s (whatever, it doesn&#39;t really<br/>\nmatter...) will be there beating me to it.  I have, for a couple of months now, been admiring the Planes<br/>\nstuff I&#39;ve seen other people wearing, and checking out the stats of new stuff as it is discovered, and<br/>\ndreaming of owning it.  By the time I get level 50, I will have earned the right to go after this stuff,<br/>\nas far as I am concerned.  Now I may have to play *another year* before I get to have any of it?  I hope<br/>\nthey don&#39;t screw up this badly, but I doubt it, and if they do, you probably will not see me around<br/>\nanymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 42 songs, Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
