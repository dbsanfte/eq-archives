I was just curious if anybody had specific<br/>\nstats on the damage done using Denons Disruptive Cord. Also, does the<br/>\ndamage inflicted increase with your level, your brass skill or both. I<br/>\noverheard  a 21 level bard say that she does 79 hp worth of damage with<br/>\nthis song per pulse when using her horn. I failed to ask her how she<br/>\narrived at this figure, but now that I have the song (which does work<br/>\npretty good), I wish I had.
