People did their CR and kinda explored<br/>\nbut nothing was found.  I ran to RV for some banking and when I popped back<br/>\nin for the next night fall (9pm spawn game-time rumor) but alas - nothing<br/>\nhappened.  So I joined my reg group and headed for Lguk.  Saw a system<br/>\nmessage saying something about the event being over (although the reference<br/>\nwas to a different zone.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - that&#39;s all I know.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\tBenjamin Jerrad Segal<br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:birdman@...\">birdman@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tTuesday, November 02, 1999 1:54 AM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n\t\tSubject:\tRe: [eqbards] Rumor of the bards ultimate<br/>\nweapon?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFrom: Benjamin Jerrad Segal &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:birdman@...\">birdman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> \t\tOn Mon, 1 Nov 1999, Dark wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t&gt; Bit confused but the high level undead spawn every night?<br/>\nDoes that mean<br/>\n\t\t&gt; they are still dropping good items?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tThat&#39;s what it sounded like.
