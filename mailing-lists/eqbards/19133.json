If he is going to<br/>\nmake a post on any issue, he had better make certain he has all his T&#39;s<br/>\ncrossed and I&#39;s dotted before he hits the Send button.  If he doesn&#39;t have<br/>\nfirst-hand knowledge on the correct answer, then he needs to check with<br/>\nsomeone who does before he replies.  Thats what most reasonable people would<br/>\ndo.  If he doesn&#39;t then he only opens himself and Verant up to criticism.<br/>\nWhen he makes a post like he did today about twisting bard invis song all he<br/>\ndoes is make himself and Verant look like they don&#39;t know what they are<br/>\ntalking about.  Since a lot of people already think Abashi and Verant are<br/>\nclueless, situations like today only magnify the problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW I&#39;m a part time player who only has 35 days total played since 11 April<br/>\n1999.  But even though I don&#39;t play much I still read most of the EQ forums<br/>\non a consistent basis.  I&#39;ve also grouped with every class in the game on<br/>\nnumerous occasions.  I would be willing to bet I can tell you the major<br/>\nissue/rant/complaint each class currently has.  I may not be qualified to<br/>\nsay anything about it since I don&#39;t play any class except a bard, but I<br/>\ncould at least tell you what the other classes are having problems with.<br/>\nYou would assume that someone who gets paid to do that full time would also<br/>\nhave a good idea on every class issue as well.

His job is to listen to problems and take<br/>\nthem to the people who know how to fix them.  He may, on occasion, offer<br/>\nadvice based on his experiences or come up with ideas on his own.  But you<br/>\ncannot expect him to have firm knowledge of how every song and every spell<br/>\nand every skill in the game works.  That&#39;s totally unfair.  He _does_ have<br/>\ngeneral knowledge about bards.  He knows we use instruments and have songs<br/>\nthat last far shorter durations than normal spells.
