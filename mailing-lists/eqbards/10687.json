I&#39;d rather chain something, or try to chain <br/>\n  something, then call for a snare before the monster runs.  Either<br/>\n  way, chains are not as useful as they once were.  Chains interferes<br/>\n  with shaman drowsy and enchanter slowdowns, for sure.  I let the <br/>\n  casters slow and the ranger snare, since I have much more important<br/>\n  things to twist.  (If someone does go on the run, yes running and<br/>\n  casting is an awesome thing that people overlook frequently)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Still using charm at 39th, great for saving that party member that is at <br/>\n&gt; half a bubble, or pulling the Dar off the cleric.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  Again, Lguk / SolB - that all ends.  Not much to charm anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; who cares about holding them? When I can interrupt the casting of froglok <br/>\n&gt; wizard 90% of the time with a well placed pixie strike I am a happy camper.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  Your 3 sec cast + 1 sec to even hit the button once you see the caster<br/>\n  visual, is typically not enough time to sink an interrupt unless you<br/>\n  devote yourself to pixie&#39;ing the mob forever, I&#39;d rather twist magic<br/>\n  and something else.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Heh I never play mana song alone unless I am being lazy, you can weave it <br/>\n&gt; with on other song without losing effect.  You can even do it with 2 songs + <br/>\n&gt; mana and still get 80% of the effect of playing mana song alone.  Do not <br/>\n&gt; listen to greedy casters that say play mana only unless you want to 8)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  Since mana song is instant effect, and not pulse based, twisting<br/>\n  it just hurts the effectiveness.  That said, I still do twist it<br/>\n  in, but only after berserk and psalm are up.  Unless I have like<br/>\n  a party of five wizards, hehehe.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
