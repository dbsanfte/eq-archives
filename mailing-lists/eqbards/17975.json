I was in <br/>\nfrenzied last night and I got a ton of very early wear-off messages on <br/>\nthis song.  I was wondering whether I had found a sour spot in my <br/>\ntwisting cycle (e.g., I was twisting just fast enough to get the song <br/>\nstarts/song stops problem) or if this was a problem with Chains itself.  <br/>\nAt my level, the stuff we were fighting is mostly normal blue.
