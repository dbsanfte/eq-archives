I don&#39;t like FFA loot at all, for three reasons:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 1)  it cheats the spellcasters, who are too far from the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; action to get to loot the &quot;good&quot; bodies (plus I&#39;d rather<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have them sitting on their tushies medding than running<br/>\n&gt; &gt; around madly trying to get their fair share of treasure);<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 2) nobody ever thinks that they&#39;re looting their fair<br/>\n&gt; &gt; share of FFA bodies; and 3) too many people leave the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;junk&quot; bodies behind, then mentally count them off against<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you if you choose to loot them yourself.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; At higher levels, the primary concern is not becoming<br/>\n&gt; encumbered with too much loot, so most people tend to just<br/>\n&gt; loot what they need which is why FFA works.  At least I<br/>\n&gt; haven&#39;t met anyone past about level 30 that went on a looting<br/>\n&gt; binge when it was declared FFA.  In fact, I&#39;ve noticed we tend<br/>\n&gt; to have a lot of corpses rot on us unlooted when it&#39;s FFA -<br/>\n&gt; nobody wants to pick up the extra weight.  Looting out of<br/>\n&gt; order was a pretty big problem at lower levels though.  One<br/>\n&gt; guy I was grouped with immediately looted anything with a<br/>\n&gt; weapon whether or not it was his turn, then began complaining<br/>\n&gt; he was encumbered.  Needless to say, that group didn&#39;t last<br/>\n&gt; long.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.

And while <br/>\nsome of the players I end up with are like me (they just don&#39;t play <br/>\nregularly), there are other not-so-neutral reasons why others are not in <br/>\nregular groups.  Strict alpha loot avoids one of the most annoying loot <br/>\nproblems that I constantly run into, which is the guy who &quot;generously&quot; <br/>\nloots less than his fair share of the crappy stuff in order to give him <br/>\nself-justification for taking all the good stuff.  Hating to be greedy, <br/>\nbut I could still use a lot more money than I&#39;ve got in the bank.  An <br/>\noccasional nice item would be good, too.  ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 32 songs, Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
