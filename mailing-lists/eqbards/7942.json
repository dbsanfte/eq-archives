I personally would wear them, you earned them :-)  And<br/>\nyes, women do get very preferential treatment I think.  I have stayed out of<br/>\nthe whole binding argument because I have never had a problem getting bound.<br/>\nEver.  Because my character is female, all I&#39;ve ever had to do is walk up to<br/>\na group and ask &quot;will one of you please bind me.&quot;  My warrior friend can<br/>\nshout for HOURS and have no response.  I&#39;ve also been given numerous items<br/>\nbecause I&#39;m &quot;cute.&quot;  Is this fair?  No. But then again, men don&#39;t have to<br/>\nput up with tells from strangers who want to know if they like to be spanked<br/>\n:P<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tTani, 15th Bard<br/>\n\t\tHalana, 30th Shaman<br/>\n\t\tSolusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\t\t\tFrom:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shinara@...\">shinara@...</a><br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shinara@...\">shinara@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\t\t\tSent:\tTuesday, October 05, 1999 4:34 PM<br/>\n\t\t\t\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n\t\t\t\tSubject:\t[eqbards] Umm Twinking Still<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\tFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shinara@...\">shinara@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\tI will probably regret sending this mail ..<br/>\nPlease remember this is my first mail list and I have only been playing EQ<br/>\nfor about 2 months now, so many of these comcepts are still new to me<br/>\n(Twinking, Item Camping, farming ??). I have read the Glossary so I<br/>\nunderstand the meaning if not the concept.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\tLast night I was hunting in Crushbone and<br/>\nwas grouped with a very high level player, I did not understand the EXP<br/>\nshare problem. He just asked me to keep singing my heal song and he would<br/>\nlook after me, I grouped with him for several hours and didnt get any exp.<br/>\nAnyway when I asked him about this he said he would fix me up for my time.<br/>\nAfter a further hour I told him I needed exp and would move on, at that<br/>\npoint he said he had some stuff for me and initiated a trade. I asked my<br/>\nfriend via tell if I should accept and he said yes as I earnt it. The Wiz<br/>\ngave me a Charred Chitchin Breastplate and a pair of Blackened Iron Pants. I<br/>\nasked my friend if they were good (I could see via AC and Stats they were,<br/>\nbut how good?) he said they were, too good for my level. I have banked them<br/>\nfor now and wanted to ask the list if I should wear them/sell them or give<br/>\nthem away. I have no problem with twinking but dont want to be called a<br/>\ncheat. So please no flames just an opinion on what I should!<br/>\n\t\t\t\t do.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\tOh do all men like giving women stuff in EQ<br/>\n?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\tRegards<br/>\n\t\t\t\tNina<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n----------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n\t\t\t\tGet your free email from AltaVista at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://altavista.iname.com\">http://altavista.iname.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\t--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\tDoes Windows keep &quot;&quot;bugging&quot;&quot; you?
