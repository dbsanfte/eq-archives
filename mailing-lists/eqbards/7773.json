Bank em and all my stuff, grap a drum and head to Qeynos. On the way <br/>\nI would buy every low, medium and high bear/wolf skin I could find (lots of <br/>\nbear skins in the Commons and Rivervale/Misty Thicket).  When I reached <br/>\nQeynos I would sell the Mino Axes for 8 to 12 plat each, then go talk to the <br/>\nMillers and make wolf/bear belts, boots, and cloaks.  Bank em all and my <br/>\ndrum and then use the &#39;poor mans gate&#39; to get back to Kelethin.  I would <br/>\nthen sell the bear/wolf hide stuff to all the casters in Greater Feydark.  I <br/>\ncould make 150 to 200 plat easy in a day or two :) I made first trip at 6th <br/>\nlvl in the second week of retail (would have gone in first but the servers <br/>\nwere alway down).  Running through East and North Karana then was a major <br/>\nterror run: Evil Eyes, Cyclops, and Griffins (oh my!).  But I never died on <br/>\nany of these trips, except for the time I tried to talk to the Sheriff in <br/>\nRivervale and forgot to hit enter first, lol.<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn Swiftsong - Karana server<br/>\nMaster Craftsmen of Societus Argenti</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
