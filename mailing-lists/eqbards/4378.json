They are a comprehensive list of many of the weapons in everquest (There are currently over 200 weapons on this list). The chart sorts the weaponary by it&#39;s damage to delay ratio (Actually it uses the formula {[Damage*2]+1}/Delay   This is the damage that a weapon generates up until about level 20 or so, when Level and Strength bonuses start to show.)\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThis chart also contains information on where many of these weapon can be found, who can use them, and other simple things like weight and effects.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThis chart is one of several that Lulen publishes. Lulen also has a couple of charts for you Archery and Fletchery buffs which list all the possible combinations of bows and arrows.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThere is yet another chart, not available at the above website, which details much of the armor and items available on Norrath.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIn order to get your own copies of this information, simply subscribe to the Onelist Mailing list known as EQ_LulensCharts\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAll of Lulen&#39;s charts are available in a pair of Excel 95 files. All the sheets from each Excel file have also been broken down into seperate .CSV (Text, Comma Delimited) files (Which are importable into virtually all known Database, Spreadsheet, and Word Processor programs). The .CSV files are also stored as a pair of files (One for weapons, one for items.) The files are available in that mailing list&#39;s Shared Files section...\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI suppose that maybe this isn&#39;t entirely off topic, as Lulen IS a bard, and he is scribing this information to spread across all of Norrath during his journies!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
