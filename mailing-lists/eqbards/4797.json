But it only works on low level PC&#39;s<br/>\nreally. The reason is that Bellow pushes the target just a little bit and<br/>\nthat little bit of movement is enough to interrupt PC casters with low<br/>\nchanneling skill.  Almost all mobs that you encounter after bellow have<br/>\ninsanely high channeling skill, so bellow really doesn&#39;t do much on them.<br/>\n(Since they can summon a pet as you and 4 other people are<br/>\nbeating/blasting on them, it&#39;s reasonable that the 2 inches of movement<br/>\ncuased by bellow is going to seem like a joke to them)  I&#39;m not sure when<br/>\nbellow would stop working on PC&#39;s, due to their channeling skill<br/>\nincreasing.  But at low to mid teens, bellow is deadly to PC spell<br/>\ncasters.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
