I&#39;ve been told that you need a minimum<br/>\nstrength of 80 to do so effectively. I don&#39;t know if this allows for the<br/>\ncarrying of any loot since the best thing I have so far is snakeskin.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI don&#39;t know exactly what the effect dexterity has on hitting notes but it<br/>\nseems to have a good effect on hitting creatures. I myself dumped all I<br/>\ncould in dexterity.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSongs do not use mana and they will go for as long as you are playing it<br/>\nfor most songs. There are a few songs that will play for a brief time (one<br/>\npulse) and then stop. These are usually NPC targeting types of songs like<br/>\nLament. Getting stunned, missing a note, or zoning will stop a song.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MrWiz@...\">MrWiz@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MrWiz@...\">MrWiz@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Saturday, April 24, 1999 6:48 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Stats for a bard<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MrWiz@...\">MrWiz@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nHail, fellow bards.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m new to the bard class (figure i&#39;ll play one monday on the new server),<br/>\nand had a few questions for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, i noticed that bards can wear plate armor.  How much strenghth is<br/>\nrequired to wear a full suit of plate armor and still run around and be able<br/>\nto grab some loot?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve heard Dexterity has an affect on how well bards play their instruments.<br/>\nHow big of an affect is this?  Should i max my dexterity to ensure that i&#39;m<br/>\ngood at playing instruments?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, i&#39;ve heard that since bard spells don&#39;t use mana, they can play<br/>\nindefinately, is this true?  How does the whole &quot;song&quot; thing work?<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess these questions probably get asked a lot...  if there&#39;s a FAQ or<br/>\nsomething i could check our, just point me to it...<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks all.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Wiz<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nShop.theglobe.com * One-Stop Shopping * Free Shipping in U.S.!<br/>\nLive Personal Shopper * Satisfaction Guaranteed * No Hassle Returns!<br/>\nAccessories, Apparel, Jewelry, Kids, Sporting Goods, Apparel, More!!<br/>\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/ad/shoptheglobe0\">http://www.onelist.com/ad/shoptheglobe0</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
