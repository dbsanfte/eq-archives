My bard - which is the one I have played the<br/>\nmost was started in May &#39;99 and has 220 days /played - although like I said,<br/>\nlots of time idle (fell alseep crossing West Karana or just zoning more<br/>\ntimes than I care to recount).  But, I login about 6pm on weekdays and stay<br/>\ntill 10pm - sometimes 11 or 12.  Weekends, begin around 8am and go, on and<br/>\noff, til midnight or 2am - with the occasional all-nighter - like last Sat<br/>\nwhen our little group killed the PoD in Gfay, rescued a Freeti room wipe<br/>\nout, then as we were killing the fire giants, saw Ragefire spawn so we<br/>\ncalled in a cleric friend and killed a dragon.  The monk in our group won a<br/>\nCloak of Flames and our warrior won a red dragon scale at 4am when the dust<br/>\nsettled.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd ya, my house is a mess, girl friend moved out a year ago, the lawn needs<br/>\nmowing, and I order food for delivery way too often.
