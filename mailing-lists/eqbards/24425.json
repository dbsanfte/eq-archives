First, for blues,<br/>\nthey all resist my charm a lot.  A LOT.  A smoldering goo resisted 8<br/>\nconsecutive attempts at charming.  Others would resist 3-5 times.  My<br/>\ncharisma is over 125, and I don&#39;t have these troubles with charm anywhere<br/>\nelse.  The FM giants, the yellow and evens, tend to resist 2 times, and then<br/>\nonly occassionally.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe flip side, is the xp in Dalnir.  Even in the hell level that is 30, 2<br/>\nkills gives noticable movement.  :)  Just make sure you&#39;re in a good group,<br/>\neven with Selos, the death run takes forever.<br/>\n<br/>\nI won&#39;t pull in Dalnir.  I think there must be a bard hate multiplier in<br/>\nthere.  Had a druid pulling, and he brings 2 casters.  He turns the corner,<br/>\nand 2 heartbeats later, they appear around the corner, stop, and begin to<br/>\ncast.  Just take a wild guess at the recipient of all that DD loving.  :)<br/>\nNot the puller, oh no.  It was the guy in blue who still had that weak,<br/>\nlevel 20 manasong going.  Full health to 2 bubbles before we do any<br/>\ndamage...heh.  Too bad for them, the druid healed me.  I then proceeded to<br/>\nbuff everyones MR to high heck, and I don&#39;t think they landed anything else.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the second one still resisted my charm like crazy...I&#39;m baffled.  Charm<br/>\ndoes not work in there like it does everywhere else.  But I&#39;m not leaving.<br/>\nAs long as you get a decent group...oh, the exp!
