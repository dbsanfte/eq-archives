I&#39;ve known plenty of powergamers.  And I&#39;ve<br/>\nknown plenty who could roleplay many under the table, as it were.  Style of<br/>\nplay is one thing, HOW you play it is entirely something else.<br/>\n<br/>\nI read Brad M.&#39;s comments on fighters, and can&#39;t agree more.  Understand<br/>\nhe&#39;s coming from the idea that EVERYBODY roleplays.  Not his idea, an old<br/>\nidea from MUDs, before Quake.  But still, I think I am hard pressed to find<br/>\nsomebody who doesn&#39;t roleplay, in EQ,  if you approach them roleplaying.  I<br/>\ntend to think most will roleplay actually, don&#39;t understand all this<br/>\nnonsense of a switch (On: Verilly! Off: Yo dude!  On: Behither to yonder<br/>\nplace where we met yonder Off: Quick before the MOB kicks my ass!  Did that<br/>\nfor friends once hehehehh).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, EQ is designed along the idea of the ace spade hearts diamonds<br/>\nmentality.  Four types of players:  Power gamers, socializers, explorers,<br/>\nPKs.  When I read Brad&#39;s comments I realized how much he still carries that<br/>\noriginal MUD study.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost bard&#39;s, by the way, should be &quot;explorers&quot; the extreme rare group for<br/>\nMUDS.  Yet, by our abilities I think explorers are attracted to this class<br/>\nin EQ.  I think that is why this is the most intelligent onelist.  Explorers<br/>\nare rare and really really smart.  But I&#39;ve known a few explorers in my day<br/>\nwho do NOT roleplay.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow you play or the way you play, there&#39;s a distinction.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpeak intelligently and understand Brad&#39;s posts, read this which has<br/>\ninfluenced countless muds through UO and EQ and likely beyond:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://journal.pennmush.org/v1n1/bartle.html\">http://journal.pennmush.org/v1n1/bartle.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nRoop</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
