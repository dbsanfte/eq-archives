Find 2 Mammoths<br/>\n2. Charm the strongest one, when you have it charmed (no resist message)<br/>\ntarget other and hit your /pet attack button.<br/>\n3. Hit F1 twice to retarget your pet (since it is hard to tell which one<br/>\nis yours)<br/>\n4. Start Selo&#39;s and back away 100-200 feet. You usually have time to<br/>\nstart TWO songs before charm fails, I usually sing Hymn, then Selo&#39;s<br/>\nthen wait for charm to fail<br/>\n5. When Mammoths start charging you, stop Selo&#39;s and recharm your pet,<br/>\nhe will immediately attack the other Mammoth (you may need to back away<br/>\nwhile singing charm, so the mammoths don&#39;t hit you)<br/>\n6. Stop singing charm, start Selo&#39;s <br/>\n7. Repeat until one Mammoth dies (hopefully not the one your charmed :)<br/>\n8. Switch to weapons and chain/fear the last one to death (should be<br/>\neasy at this point)<br/>\n<br/>\nUsing this technique, I have killed many mammoths, although I have to<br/>\nsay when I started this, they were already blue to me. Cyclops work the<br/>\nsame way, except that the endgame is much more risky. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have also noticed that if your pet starts losing and you decide to<br/>\nswitch sides, most of the time, your old pet will run after you ignoring<br/>\nthe damage dealt by the new pet. If you want to be safe, stick to just<br/>\none, even if he loses. If you want max XP, try chaining the old pet so<br/>\nthe new one can whack him enough that he ignores you.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, FYI, the named Cyclops in Rathe Mountains &quot;Tarskusk&quot; was yellow to<br/>\nme and I was able to charm him, but he would not respond to my commands.<br/>\nI was able to kill him by having a druid snare him, and while he was<br/>\nhell-bent on killing me, I charmed another cyclops which killed him for<br/>\nme.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also have used charm, when my group gets an &quot;Extra&quot; on the pull. Makes<br/>\na world of difference to switch from fighting 2 icy orcs, to fighting<br/>\none, and having the other Tank for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nUldar Ulfangson<br/>\n32nd Bard, RodcetNife</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
