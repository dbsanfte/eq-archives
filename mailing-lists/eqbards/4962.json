Furthermore, I&#39;ve seen more than my share of BARDS<br/>\ndoing quite a bit of kiting.  Our songs may not hit HARD...but they<br/>\nnever run outta mana, and we Suuuuuure can outrun druids.  Personally,<br/>\nI&#39;d get over this &quot;grass is always greener&quot; thing.  My high level<br/>\ncleric ALWAYS welcomes a bard in the group (and did at all levels) and<br/>\nany time I&#39;ve seen a group lucky enough to have 2...yes gasp...2 bards<br/>\nin it...folks have ALWAYS remarked on how AMAZING bards were.  <br/>\n  We get our advantages, and we get our disadvantages.  I&#39;ll take a<br/>\nlesser kiting ability over spending all night medding ANY DAY (which is<br/>\nabout all my cleris seems to do any more).  All I seem to play anymore<br/>\nis my bard.  <br/>\n  Every class talks about how POWERFUL another one is.  I think they<br/>\nare pretty much all balanced well, and the nerfs are indeed usually<br/>\nwell thought out.<br/>\n  I WOULD like to see more bard only items (a weapon would be nice<br/>\ninstead of JUST an instrument...or a more powerful instrument) but<br/>\nwouldnt we all?  hehe<br/>\n<br/>\nWindolas Whistlewind, Elven Bard (Mith Marr)<br/>\nPontus Leatherfoot, Halfling Cleric (Mith Marr)<br/>\nCrann TreeLimb, Elven Druid (Mith Marr)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_____________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nFree instant messaging and more at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://messenger.yahoo.com\">http://messenger.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
