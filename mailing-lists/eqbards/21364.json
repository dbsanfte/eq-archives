However,<br/>\nwhenever I mention how much fun playing my bard is, all the 55+ bards in my<br/>\nguild just about roll over laughing and say &quot;just wait&quot;... like I&#39;ve said<br/>\nbefore, I think Verant sees Bards as their &quot;crowning achievement&quot; and just<br/>\ncan&#39;t see why we&#39;re complaining.  Either that, or the person they originally<br/>\nhad design the Bard has left and nobody knows how he coded it or such :) <br/>\n<br/>\nHalana, 56th Shaman aka Raptor Fodder<br/>\nTani, 28th Bard of SPLAT (was running along in Overthere in the fog....<br/>\nthere&#39;s a big chasm there :))<br/>\nParadigm<br/>\nSolusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; i don&#39;t think crowd control or dealing without lullaby is the <br/>\n&gt; issue for<br/>\n&gt; most.  we have all dealt without lullaby for a year.  it&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; the way bards are<br/>\n&gt; being treated by verant.  as i think kitasi said, i would never have<br/>\n&gt; expected to see lyrnia go as she was an avid supporter of <br/>\n&gt; verant decisions<br/>\n&gt; (nothing wrong with that, just saying).  the way they make <br/>\n&gt; decisions about<br/>\n&gt; bards is what i think people can no longer stomach.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Shada<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Since I have given up ever getting mez again, I have moved on with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (Dark)Elfson Allegro.  My guild has fallen in love with City <br/>\n&gt; &gt; of Mist this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; week (after past affairs with Dalinars and Kaesora).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
