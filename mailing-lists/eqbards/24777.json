Saw you briefly in HS sunday night,<br/>\nlooked like you guys were doing CR. I was running our tp&#39;er over for us to<br/>\nleave, so if you spoke and I didn&#39;t respond, it was because I wasn&#39;t at that<br/>\nmachine. <br/>\nI agree with what Darkfox says about exp and grouping. HS is awesome for<br/>\nexp, I just dinged to 57 myself there. You do have to take a group in with<br/>\nyou though, and of course everyone has to have a key. We hardly ever do<br/>\npickup groups. If guild and friends can&#39;t fill group, we log or play twinks.<br/>\nMaybe that&#39;s due to being on Xegony. Lots of very opinionated people on<br/>\nXegony, to put it mildly. <br/>\n<br/>\nBrilinnia Ban&#39;sidhe, 57 until we go to Fear tomorrow!<br/>\nVenator Sapentia, Xegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
