I&#39;ve had 4 different people attempt to charge me <br/>\n&gt;100pp for a stone.  One of them I whined to and they finally gave it to me <br/>\n&gt;for free (apparently they had a friend in my guild or something).  All the <br/>\n&gt;others said they&#39;d sold many for 100ppk, and had no intention of selling it <br/>\n&gt;to me for less.  It&#39;s unfortunate that the higher level bards are dumping <br/>\n&gt;money on these such that us lower level bards (I can kill hill giants <br/>\n&gt;pretty well in a decent group at 29, but it&#39;s hard to get that group <br/>\n&gt;together) can&#39;t afford them.  I mean geez!  The armor is expensive enough <br/>\n&gt;as it is!  ~200pp for the damn lambent sapphires!  Wish we could somehow <br/>\n&gt;spread the word to not pay that much for these things.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Laluni Songhammer, Level 29 bard of E&#39;Ci<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Bah! Last night in High Keep some wizard was auctioning a lambent stone for <br/>\n100pp.  A friend of mine asked me if I was interested - I declined.  He then <br/>\noffered to front me the cash, to which I replied, &quot;No, thanks, I have the <br/>\ncash, I just don&#39;t want to do that to the economy.&quot;  I would pay as much as <br/>\n30pp, perhaps, but never more than that... and frankly that would be pretty <br/>\nsteep, in my opinion.  We need to stick together and refuse these exorbitant <br/>\nprices! Sadly, there are those who will pay these prices, especially on old, <br/>\nrich servers such as ours.  &lt;shrug&gt;  The prices should stabilize once the <br/>\nrich twinkers have all their toys, I hope.<br/>\n<br/>\nAloro Silvertongue (E&#39;ci)<br/>\n28 songs and going strong,<br/>\nOut of my rut and off my butt...</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
