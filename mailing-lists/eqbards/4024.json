So much so I can&#39;t believe I<br/>\nforgot about the Prince. He is fierce. He is the<br/>\nroving InstaDeath (for most) NPC you have to watch for<br/>\nin this zone. He actually does make a circle around<br/>\nthe whole lake. But if you watch out for him you<br/>\nshould be able to avoid him. First time I went to Lake<br/>\nRathe was with another character. We found the Prince<br/>\non the strip of land which leads to the Rathe<br/>\nMountains zone. It was one of those, &quot;Hey look at that<br/>\nguy..uhh he is red.. ack and ready to<br/>\nattack...and..and.. Friend gets hammered. We saw him<br/>\nany times after that and were able to avoid him each<br/>\ntime :)<br/>\n<br/>\nKobias<br/>\nLvl 9 Bard<br/>\nInnoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
