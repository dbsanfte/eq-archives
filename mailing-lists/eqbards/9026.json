With the thorn buff, it tells you how much non-melee damage the<br/>\n&gt; mob took when they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hit you.  Anyone have an idea why we don&#39;t get a similar message?  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You *do* get the same message.  If you weren&#39;t, I&#39;d take that<br/>\n&gt; as a sign that they were canceling eaching other.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
