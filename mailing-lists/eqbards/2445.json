I&#39;m wearing 2 brass plate items, some banded pieces, <br/>\na leather apron, lockjaw&#39;s vest, I wield a Dirk and a combine LS most of <br/>\nthe time, I have 3 backpacks filled with assorted random stuff, carry 20 <br/>\nfood and 20 water, instruments, I seldom go near cities any more so I&#39;m <br/>\nusually packing 50 pp, 100 gp, 200 sp (I give the copper to low-level <br/>\ncritters too, as soemone else mentioned)... I have some str buffing items <br/>\n(so I think my normal Str is 91 or so), and with all that I&#39;m fine. I can <br/>\nget as much loot as anyone else and I won&#39;t get encumbered for ages.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I started again I&#39;d probably start with 90 in Strength, as far as what <br/>\nto put in your other skills... go for them all ;) Spread &#39;em out nicely and <br/>\nyou&#39;ll be fine. It really comes down to how you&#39;re going to play your PC <br/>\nand since that varies from time to time I recommend just making sure you&#39;re <br/>\nnot too lacking in anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nDud<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom:\tJesse [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:j@...\">j@...</a>]<br/>\nSent:\tFriday, June 25, 1999 6:29 PM<br/>\nTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject:\t[eqbards] agil or dex?<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Jesse &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:j@...\">j@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHi,<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m planning to create a bard either on Rallos Zek or preferrably the<br/>\nracewar server (if I can hold out). I&#39;ve already chosen half elf as my<br/>\nrace and I intend to put most of my points into strength so that I can<br/>\neasily carry steel plate, weapons and instruments.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, with the few remaining points I have, where do you guys and gals<br/>\nsuggest I put them? Dexterity or agility? I hear dexterity is important<br/>\nfor playing songs. How large an effect does this have? Does it actually<br/>\nincrease the effectiveness of the song or does it just decrease how<br/>\nfrequently you miss a note?<br/>\n<br/>\nOr perhaps agility would be better, as if I don&#39;t get hit, I don&#39;t get<br/>\ninterrupted. Plus plate + agility is a nice combination.<br/>\n<br/>\nLastly, for any mid to high level bards out there wearing mostly<br/>\nsteelplate, how much strength do you recommend? I don&#39;t want to be in a<br/>\nconstant war against weight. I&#39;m thinking 100 strength to be safe, but I<br/>\nwas thinking less might do (and allow me to put more into dexterity and<br/>\nagility).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf less strength is okay, then I might consider just doing a wood elf, as<br/>\nthey tend to have higher natural agility and dexterity. Either elf fits<br/>\nwell in my IC perception of my character.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your help,<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nJesse &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:j@...\">j@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lumiere.net/\">http://www.lumiere.net/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nBooks, music, videos, gifts, e-cards, auctions-find them at AMAZON.COM.<br/>\nBrowse Earth&#39;s Biggest Selection!
