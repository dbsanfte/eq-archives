Once again a reminder, I&#39;m not looking<br/>\nto send in an email asking for new features added, just for fixes to current<br/>\nproblems, or at least estimates on when we can expect things to be fixed.  I<br/>\nwant answers, not changes.<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Several of our songs (levels 39, 45, 47, 49) don&#39;t seem to be in the<br/>\ngame.  We would like to know when we can expect these to be implemented.  If<br/>\nthey are indeed in the game already (perhaps discovered via quests) please<br/>\nat least let us know that they exist.  We don&#39;t need to know how/where to<br/>\nget them, or even what they are, but we don&#39;t want to waste our time<br/>\nquesting for something that isn&#39;t there.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Several of our skills (Hiding, Sneak, Forage) cap at such<br/>\nlow levels, that they aren&#39;t worth using.  We don&#39;t need to be master of<br/>\nthese, but if the caps were raised such that at least they worked more than<br/>\n1 out of 20 times, we might consider putting them back into our hot keys.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) The level 22 song Alenias Disenchanting Melody currently seems to have no<br/>\neffect whatsoever.  This has been tested repeatedly by many, many bards.  It<br/>\ndoes not dispel effects on group members (as we thought it should) nor does<br/>\nit protect in any way from harmful effects.  Can you please confirm whether<br/>\nthis song is broken or not?  When can we expect a fix?<br/>\n<br/>\n4) You&#39;ve mentioned in the past that the messed up drum graphic (it now<br/>\nlooks like we strum a small twig) will be corrected in an upcoming graphics<br/>\npatch.  We realize a graphics patch is large, and hence cannot be done<br/>\nregularily, but could we please get an estimate on roughly when we can<br/>\nexpect this glitch to be fixed?  In addition, a recent patch made an<br/>\nequipped mino horn look like we have a small burlap sack embedded in our<br/>\nwrists.<br/>\n<br/>\n5) There seems to be an absense of any high level bard quests.  Is there any<br/>\nimplementation planned for these?  When might we expect them?<br/>\n<br/>\n6) Recent patches have had a serious impact on the song Selo&#39;s Accelerando<br/>\nwith the following negative side effects:  This song no longer breaks root.<br/>\nWe were under the impression that this was an intended benefit, is this a<br/>\nbug, or has this functionality been intentionally removed?  Also SoW now<br/>\noverrides our song, in effect cancelling it out.  Many bards have already<br/>\ncomplained about having SoW intentionally cast on them as a form of<br/>\nharassment.  Are there any plans to A) make SoW removable by clicking on it<br/>\nas was recently done for levetate, or B) make it so that Selo&#39;s overrides<br/>\nSoW, but when Selo&#39;s wears off, or goes out of range, SoW will continue to<br/>\nwork.  When could we expect such a change to occur?<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease feel free to make any contibutions/suggestion/changes that you feel<br/>\nare appropriate.  I want this letter to be a consensus of what we feel are<br/>\nour major problems.  Again, I&#39;m not looking for new things that it would be<br/>\nnice to have added to our class, just the most important current problems<br/>\nthat should be addressed.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn Kim had a lot of really good suggestions, but if I include them all,<br/>\nthis letter would be waaay too long.  I&#39;m trying to concentrate on some of<br/>\nthe larger issues.  If it gets too long, I have a fear that GZ wouldn&#39;t even<br/>\nbother to read it.  I&#39;ve flagged John&#39;s email for Letter Number 2 &lt;grin&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.  Maybe not everyone considers the missing drum graphic a serious<br/>\nproblem, but this is a big peeve of mine.  I can&#39;t believe they haven&#39;t<br/>\nfixed this at some point in the last 5 months.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nElwyn Heartstring<br/>\nLevel 41 Bard<br/>\nErollisi Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
