Well I would really like to know more about this.  I<br/>\nhave done some begging between levels 1-5 and I have never been attacked<br/>\n(some say Im lucky).  I have some questions that I would love answers to<br/>\nbefore I invest some of my well earned (and mostly unused) practice points<br/>\ntoward.  Here are some things I have heard..... confirmation requested.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith a skill over 100 you can beg multiple platnum.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can beg from NPC, players pets, and monsters.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Charismatic Carrillion song will help prevent you from getting attacked<br/>\nby NPC&#39;s you beg from.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would like to know that if this stuff is true, are there trade offs?  Is<br/>\nit worth it?<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease speak up if you know people who beg, or have raised your skill<br/>\nyourself.  I am itching to work on this.  I see it as a way to get paid for<br/>\nplaying my songs.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSevin Tercet 20th Human Bard<br/>\nand Wanabe Street Musician<br/>\non Brell</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
