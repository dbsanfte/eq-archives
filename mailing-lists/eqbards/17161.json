SLW will get any player to the haste cap regardless<br/>\nof items, therefore with any items it seems to be a waste.  i did hear<br/>\nhowever that the haste cap was bumped up on the test server in expectation<br/>\nof kunark.  we&#39;re guessing it is probably around 100% now instead of 60%.<br/>\n<br/>\nShada Powa, L50 Wood Elf Bard<br/>\nTyria Sarkin, L49 High Elf Wizard<br/>\n&lt;Afterlife&gt; Mithaniel Marr Server<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hmmm, our enchanters will swift our tanks and yes they all have haste<br/>\n&gt; equipment of some sort (FBSS, Planes belts, etc.)  It&#39;s our <br/>\n&gt; SOP to SLTW on<br/>\n&gt; tanks at the end of the buffing.  This is for Dragons and <br/>\n&gt; Gods.  Also for<br/>\n&gt; general work in the planes our tanks beg for swift.  I am not <br/>\n&gt; sure abou the<br/>\n&gt; cap on a weapon speed nor what it takes to reach the cap.
