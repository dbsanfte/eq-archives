The way to combat this is to max your brass skill.  This is<br/>\nlong and boring, so I reccomend doing something like leaving your bard in<br/>\nthe non-PvP area of Lake Rathe overnight, singing Denon&#39;s (the only real<br/>\nbrass song you have).  By the next morning, your brass skill should be<br/>\nhigh enough to considerably reduce failures.  Be careful anywhere<br/>\nelse--you want somewhere with no mobs that might wander close enough, and<br/>\navoid the normal PvP areas, as there are lots of idiotic little juveniles<br/>\nwho will blast your bard&#39;s buitt while you are gone, just to have done it<br/>\n(heh, ask me--I almost lost a corpse for having been on-line nearly 24<br/>\nhours after a moronic little caster actually beat me to death with his<br/>\nbig wooden stick while I tried this in FP arena--he was enough lower that<br/>\nhis spells would not even stick!)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for uses, there are two ways I use this.  The first is along with<br/>\nchains--you chain/fear/chain/fear (rinse repeat) while you and/or your<br/>\nparty cast and hack at its back.  This only really works in wide-open<br/>\nplaces, obviously.  The second is as a get-out-of-jail-free card.  When<br/>\nyou get stuck in a really bad situation (say you are in a dungeon and no<br/>\none can get the mobs off the druid/wizzie long enough for them to cast<br/>\nevac), you sing fear, the mobs go flying away, and you have just enough<br/>\ntime to affect your escape.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Karisma Swiftarrow<br/>\nGuildmistress, Hearts of Valor<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.heartsofvalor.com\">http://www.heartsofvalor.com</a> (temporarily down)<br/>\n<br/>\nVisit Swiftarrow&#39;s Song at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.freespeech.org/karisma\">http://www.freespeech.org/karisma</a><br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nYOU&#39;RE PAYING TOO MUCH FOR THE INTERNET!<br/>\nJuno now offers FREE Internet Access!<br/>\nTry it today - there&#39;s no risk!
