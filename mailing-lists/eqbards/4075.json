One time, my group was resting after a fight.  I had been using<br/>\nDenon&#39;s Discord during the previous fight.  While everyone is resting, the<br/>\nback door opens up and a festering hag makes a beeline towards me.  Next<br/>\nthing I know she zaps me for 300+ hit points and I&#39;m dead.  If there is a<br/>\nbug with the  axis whatever is it something that Verant is aware of and is<br/>\nworking on fixing?<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snipped from earlier post by Faras&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\tLast night in Unrest I camped off the side porch because there was a<br/>\n\tdiscussion that singing songs off the back porch might be affecting<br/>\nmobs in<br/>\n\tthe basement due to an unlimited Z axis affect bug.  I also did not<br/>\nstand<br/>\n\taround and sing songs while our puller was in the house...I waited<br/>\nuntil our<br/>\n\tkill was brought to the fence and whacked once or twice and then<br/>\nkicked in<br/>\n\tmy playlist.  This worked awesome and I did not die once.<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t think the bards invis song worked against undead.  I know for a<br/>\nfact I have been attacked by zombies before while singing the song.  Can<br/>\nsomeone clarify this please.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI think the people I group with generally recognize that I do a lot<br/>\nas a\t<br/>\n\tbard, shuffling instruments and weapons, jumping in and out of<br/>\nphysical<br/>\n\tmelee, playing a variety of different songs, some &quot;simultaneously&quot;<br/>\n- and<br/>\n\tthey also recognize the benefit of our songs because I tell them<br/>\nthings like<br/>\n\t&quot;check out your magic resist&quot; and get the &quot;wholly crap!&quot; or invis<br/>\npeople<br/>\n\twhile they are medding and they are amazed that it works against<br/>\nundead too.<br/>\n\tOur party was sitting against the fence medding and watching a<br/>\nFestering Hag<br/>\n\trun around the yard wasting people, finally being killed by a group<br/>\nonly 15<br/>\n\tfeet away from us - we watched the whole thing as the group leader<br/>\nnervously<br/>\n\tcommented &quot;don&#39;t stop singing that song Faras...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
