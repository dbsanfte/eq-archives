So getting the boots is more a<br/>\nmatter of luck than camping (IMHO a great change, as those of<br/>\nus who don&#39;t like to camp finally have an equally or better<br/>\nchance of getting a nice item).  So if you happen to see tye<br/>\ncyclops, and none of your friends are close enough to get<br/>\nthere in time to loot it, don&#39;t let the boots go to waste.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
