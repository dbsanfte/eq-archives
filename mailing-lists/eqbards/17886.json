In Hate this weekend, my job became crowd<br/>\n&gt; &gt; control.  Whenever<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; two things came in on a pull, I would charm the second,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; command it to /pet<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; guard here (sit down always made them wander off), run a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ways away, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; reassert charm till it broke and retook.  Working in concert with an<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; enchanter casting tashania, I could charm anything that came in save<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; clerics (never tried) and spites.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I finally feel like my old level 30 self again.  This weekend I led an<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Efreeti run.  On the third pull someone wandered off a little<br/>\n&gt; &gt; too far and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; agroed 2 Lava Guardians and 3 Imps right after we had<br/>\n&gt; &gt; finished off an imp.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Our enchanter went OOM after the first of the 3 remaining<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Imps fell leaving<br/>\n&gt; &gt; me to crowd control alone.  Using Charm on one of the imps, I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; was able to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; keep both imps busy while we were able to finish off the lava<br/>\n&gt; &gt; elementals and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; then the imps with no further casualties :).  From that point<br/>\n&gt; &gt; forward, the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; enchanter and I had it worked out so that I would charm the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; extra incoming<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in each pull and keep them busy while he mezzed singles.  I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; would then tell<br/>\n&gt; &gt; him when the charm broke so he could start mezzing my pet.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; This had the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; nice effect of keeping the imp pounding on me instead of the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; enchanter until<br/>\n&gt; &gt; he could get the mez to stick as well as giving us an extra<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hand in battle.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; We repeated the process every time mez broke as well with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; great success.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The enchanter barely took damage the rest of the break in and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; used a lot<br/>\n&gt; &gt; less mana.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I was EXTREMELY tempted to attempt pulling for this raid...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I really wanted<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to try out a combination of Lament and charm to pull on these<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to see if I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; could really control the pulling better then the monk.  In<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the end I went<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with traditional break in techniques but I&#39;m not so sure the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; traditional<br/>\n&gt; &gt; break in is the best way to go anymore.  Have any of you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tried Lament on the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Imp or Lava guardians or been the puller for the Efreeti<br/>\n&gt; &gt; raid?  If Lament<br/>\n&gt; &gt; would work, I really think that a single well balanced party<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of 6 might be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; able to handle the break in alone.... :)  If none of you have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tried it, I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; think I might go for it next weekend...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; BTW, 2 Efreeti in the first 3 spawns and then we were shut<br/>\n&gt; &gt; out with only<br/>\n&gt; &gt; place holders for the next 10 hours...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Taneran Dreamweaver<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &lt;Clan Jax&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Bard of the 48th song<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Prexus<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; GET WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE FREE!
