I think, but am not 100% certain, that Cancel<br/>\nMagic will always remove the first spell effect.  So if you are rooted, in<br/>\norder to get rid of it the root icon needs to be listed first.  Then the<br/>\nsong has to actually succeed a MR check.  When I want to remove my DE<br/>\nillusion, I usually have to try 2-3 times before the song sticks.  <br/>\n<br/>\nUsing Disenchanting Melody to remove root would work OK IF you didn&#39;t have<br/>\nany other positive buffs.  It could easily remove one of your cleric buffs<br/>\ninstead of the root.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Cyr, Thierry [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:thierry.cyr@...\">thierry.cyr@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, January 11, 2001 10:44 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Dispelling...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat i was pondering is :<br/>\n<br/>\nWere we able to remove buffs on ourselves before? except for DE illusion<br/>\nwhich i know we can<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Windleaf Mistsong [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:windleaf@...\">windleaf@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: January 11, 2001 3:24 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>; &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Dispelling...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI know Syvelian&#39;s Anti-Magic Aura works on removing Damage Shields and <br/>\nother buffs on mobs as I used it last night in Sol A.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m assuming you&#39;re trying to strip your own enchantments with Alenia&#39;s <br/>\nDisenchanting Melody.
