So there you have it. <br/>\nAn untwinked bard who has been un-obsessed with<br/>\ngetting items.  Now, I&#39;m working on it a bit<br/>\nmore--sick of helping people camp for THEIR stuff.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSigned,<br/>\nThex Luteslinger (the bard who refuses to wear bronze<br/>\njust cause I should)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Message: 21<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Mon, 6 Dec 1999 21:07:44 -0600<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Michal Hobson&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:given@...\">given@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Equipment<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Wow, looks like I need to go shopping!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ll post this, perhaps somewhere some level 1 bard<br/>\n&gt; will think I&#39;m the man<br/>\n&gt; hehe!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Head: Bronze Helm<br/>\n&gt; Face: Leering Mask<br/>\n&gt; Ears: Golden Amber Earrings X2<br/>\n&gt; Neck: Spiked Collar<br/>\n&gt; Shoulders: Bloodstained Mantle<br/>\n&gt; Arms: Bronze Vambraces<br/>\n&gt; Wrist 1: Bracer of Erollisi<br/>\n&gt; Wrist 2: Bronze Bracer<br/>\n&gt; Hands: Lambent Gauntlets (I still keep my elf-hide<br/>\n&gt; in reserve though)<br/>\n&gt; Rings: Jagged Band, Can&#39;t remember the other, some<br/>\n&gt; wedding band or something<br/>\n&gt; +2 STR maybe?<br/>\n&gt; Back: Banded Cloak (Hehe)<br/>\n&gt; Waist: Drakescale Belt<br/>\n&gt; Legs: Lambent Greaves<br/>\n&gt; Feet: Kobold Hide Boots<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Weapons: Obsidian Scimitar X2, Dragoon Dirk, and my<br/>\n&gt; newly dusted off<br/>\n&gt; Obsidian Shard - thanks for the info by the way, who<br/>\n&gt; knew?
