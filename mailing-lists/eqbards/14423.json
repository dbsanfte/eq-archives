The way the rules work, the best strategy is for<br/>\neveryone to concentrate on one opponent at a time, while the<br/>\nextras beat on you.  In real combat, that&#39;ll get you killed<br/>\nreal quick since the extras will be getting free shots at your<br/>\nbackside.  I&#39;d really like to see a CRPG with some sort of<br/>\nengagement/disengagement system.  Then the warrior wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nhave to taunt, he&#39;d just step between the cleric and mob and<br/>\nengage the mob in combat.  If the mob turned to attack the<br/>\ncleric, the warrior would get a free shot in for max or<br/>\ncritical damage.  Yes this would require mobs to have better<br/>\nAI, which IMHO is always a good thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
