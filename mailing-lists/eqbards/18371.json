Try different varieties of this.  Things like this<br/>\n<br/>\nTake a new Lvl 5th Warrior<br/>\n<br/>\n1&gt; How many strikes does it take to get to the center of the warrior (aka How many licks does it take to get the center of a lollipop)<br/>\n2&gt; Who can kill the warrior with one strike.

My guild is<br/>\n  doing a joint guild event in South<br/>\n  Karana sometime in the near future (with 5 other guilds).  I, being a<br/>\n  fun loving party bard, have been<br/>\n  appointed to the &quot;events&quot; committee.  Problem is I&#39;m not feeling very<br/>\n  creative today and I&#39;m fresh out of<br/>\n  new and amusing ideas.  I want to<br/>\n  try to do something fun that isn&#39;t the same old same old.
