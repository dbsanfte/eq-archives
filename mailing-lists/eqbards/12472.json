Maybe Mystic Legends knew this - maybe<br/>\nnot.  May be not even true.

The Vox teams rushed around trying<br/>\nto do it all<br/>\n\t\t  before LoD showed up and the was the first major problem.<br/>\nThen some<br/>\n\t\t  shaman pets got lose after pulling monk FD, and<br/>\ninadvertantly pulled<br/>\n\t\t  Vox right into the King Room.  People paniced, and ran<br/>\naround, and then<br/>\n\t\t  chaos ensued.  It really pisses me off that those mistakes<br/>\nwere made,<br/>\n\t\t  but it even pisses me off more that you think we got<br/>\nspanked.
