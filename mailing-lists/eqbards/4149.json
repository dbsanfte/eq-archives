If anyone can beat<br/>\nthis, I&#39;d love to hear the story.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was given a virtually FULL SET OF BRONZE by a high level player I said<br/>\n&quot;hi&quot; to and did the duck dance with.  I was like level 11 or so.  So much<br/>\nbronze I can&#39;t wear it all without being encumbered.<br/>\n<br/>\nI almost said &quot;no, this is wrong...&quot; but instead I said &quot;wtf, this is the<br/>\ncoolest thing to ever happen to me in this GAME!&quot; Duh, yes it is a GAME!  <br/>\n<br/>\nDo I have fun? YES! <br/>\n<br/>\nDid it make me level faster? NO! (if for no other reason than the time spent<br/>\ntalking to people & the fact that a bandits hate bronze bards &quot;I can take<br/>\nthem, they are green trash. Opps, casters&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes it make me look kewl? YES!<br/>\n<br/>\nAm I still learning how to be a bard? YES! <br/>\n<br/>\nCan other people get it at low levels? YES! (well maybe 11 is pretty low but<br/>\nthere is a direct relationship to your in-game knowledge and how long you<br/>\nhave been playing eq and your level if you do the normal amount of monster<br/>\nkilling.  sooner or later you figure out how to make as much money as you<br/>\nwant.  then if you get off your lazy butt and travel to where bronze is sold<br/>\n- you can buy your bronze.  I have a friend who saw me in bronze and he went<br/>\noff and got his - took him a couple weeks but he has it now.)<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving fun in this game depends first and foremost on YOU!  I admit before I<br/>\nknew much, I was very indignent about other char I would see who I thought<br/>\ndo not &quot;deserve&quot; to wear that armor (too good armor for low lev char)  But<br/>\ntruthfully, I did not understand the game well.  Now - all I can say is -<br/>\nmake it fun for you.  Don&#39;t hate others because you don&#39;t think something is<br/>\n&quot;right&quot; about how they play the game.  It won&#39;t help you have more fun.<br/>\nRemember - if it can be done, it will be done.  You may think Verant should<br/>\nput in some limits on what level can have such and such stuffs.  But where<br/>\nis the fun in that? Much of the crazy things that happen - happen because<br/>\nthere are so few rules.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\nBard of the 17th level<br/>\na.k.a.

Did<br/>\n\t\tthey <br/>\n\t\t\tget that way because they were a twinked bard, or<br/>\njust from lack of <br/>\n\t\t\tinformation?
