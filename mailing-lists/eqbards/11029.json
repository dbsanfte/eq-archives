He arrived /yelling for help with every gobby from the entrance to<br/>\n&gt; the flag room chasing him, he cast Mez, he died....... Now was my turn to<br/>\n&gt; show the power of the bard!<br/>\n&gt; BTW our group was bard=me, fighter,shaman,ranger,monk, and the now dead<br/>\n&gt; enchanter...<br/>\n&gt; I whipped out my lute and began to play Lullabye, head nodding all around<br/>\n&gt; :-), i was shaking so badly I could barly type&quot; Attack one at a time and<br/>\n&gt; HEAL me!!&quot;.  About 5 min later I stood in the middle of the room with a<br/>\n&gt; ring of dead Gobbies all around me 57HP left and my party at almost full<br/>\n&gt; health.  I was estatic :-)))))). my party was in awe, the enchanter was<br/>\n&gt; pissed( he died remember). n Then it happend the words that everyone fears<br/>\n&gt; &quot;TRAIN, GET OFF THE TRACKS&quot; about 15 sec later our monk falls into the<br/>\n&gt; room bleeding from several deep cuts and falls dead. 5 sec later more<br/>\n&gt; Gobbies then I thought were in Perma boil into the room all looking for a<br/>\n&gt; crunchy Bard snack.....Lullybye back up....nods from everyone.....NO AGGGG<br/>\n&gt; the Priest RESISTED!!!!!!!! . &quot;ZONE, RUN NOW, LEAVE ME I&#39;LL HOLD THEM!!&quot; I<br/>\n&gt; yell to my party. Everyone who can runs for the<br/>\n&gt; zone.....LOADING.....Please Wait<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Now I ask you what went wrong? where are my Icy greaves? where is my<br/>\n&gt; Silvery Axe? What the hell is The Tome of the Wheel?<br/>\n&gt; If ye can answer any of these questions please do :-)<br/>\n&gt; Thanks for letting me share my time in perma with ye<br/>\n&gt; Just so ya know I had fun it was the first time I&#39;ve been scared in a long<br/>\n&gt; time, in this game<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; *************************************<br/>\n&gt; Pinen Warsong<br/>\n&gt; Hopeless Bard of the Rathe<br/>\n&gt; Bard of the 21st Song<br/>\n&gt; Master Bard of the NwN<br/>\n&gt; *************************************<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>\t\tYour icy greaves and silvery axe are in the room that the<br/>\ntrain most likely started in ;)  Don&#39;t know about the Tome of the Wheel.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tNot too sure where you were fighting.  You said near the preist, do<br/>\nyou mean the preacher room?  never seen a train come through there.  If you<br/>\nwere near the flag room, I know what happened.  Some group (or solo artist)<br/>\nwas trying the king room and brought the train with him.  One thing you want<br/>\nto tell your group (assuming you&#39;re fighting in the flag room)  is go into<br/>\nthe little alcove near the far right hand side of that room.  Then start up<br/>\nyour invis song, and wait out the train.  This isn&#39;t a guaranteed solution,<br/>\non occasions, depending on the train they might see through your invis, but<br/>\nit&#39;s worked for me far more often than not.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBien - Karana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
