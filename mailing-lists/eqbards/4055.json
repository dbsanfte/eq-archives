I just<br/>\nstood there the first time and died because I could not believe they were<br/>\ncharging straight at me with no apparent agitation...our puller was sitting<br/>\nmedding and we hadn&#39;t been in the house for a while (granted, part of the<br/>\nproblem was also that my group was awful and I should have taken the 1 other<br/>\ngood player and left after the first death...)<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night in Unrest I camped off the side porch because there was a<br/>\ndiscussion that singing songs off the back porch might be affecting mobs in<br/>\nthe basement due to an unlimited Z axis affect bug.  I also did not stand<br/>\naround and sing songs while our puller was in the house...I waited until our<br/>\nkill was brought to the fence and whacked once or twice and then kicked in<br/>\nmy playlist.  This worked awesome and I did not die once.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the people I group with generally recognize that I do a lot as a<br/>\nbard, shuffling instruments and weapons, jumping in and out of physical<br/>\nmelee, playing a variety of different songs, some &quot;simultaneously&quot;  - and<br/>\nthey also recognize the benefit of our songs because I tell them things like<br/>\n&quot;check out your magic resist&quot; and get the &quot;wholly crap!&quot; or invis people<br/>\nwhile they are medding and they are amazed that it works against undead too.<br/>\nOur party was sitting against the fence medding and watching a Festering Hag<br/>\nrun around the yard wasting people, finally being killed by a group only 15<br/>\nfeet away from us - we watched the whole thing as the group leader nervously<br/>\ncommented &quot;don&#39;t stop singing that song Faras...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you explain the nuances of your class to a group that is interested in<br/>\nworking together, then usually they understand and accommodate, especially<br/>\nif you are busting your arse to benefit the group and they are aware of it.<br/>\nWhen we decided to camp the Barkeep room I was terribly nervous because the<br/>\nFestering Hag was right in the room above us making all kinds of racket with<br/>\nthe people camping that room.  I told them I wasn&#39;t comfortable with playing<br/>\na lot of my usual songs and explained the &quot;Z axis bug&quot; and the song affects<br/>\nthrough walls thing - they were totally cool with my concerns and<br/>\naccommodated accordingly.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess the moral is don&#39;t be a lazy bard and don&#39;t be a 1-hit wonder.  When<br/>\nyou find a good group that you work well with, take down names because that<br/>\nis when you all can really shine - <br/>\n<br/>\nFaras &quot;the short fuse&quot; Linedhel, Bard of the 20th Song<br/>\nE&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Fun Bob [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fun-bob@...\">fun-bob@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, July 20, 1999 9:25 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [eqbards] How to know if Anthem is really working<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Fun Bob&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fun-bob@...\">fun-bob@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Damn man, what you need to do is get a sense of <br/>\n&gt; humor.....CALM DOWN, TAKE<br/>\n&gt; DEEP BREATHS!!!!<br/>\n&gt; I was kiddin ok?
