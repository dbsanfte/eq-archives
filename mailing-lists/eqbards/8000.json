That was a<br/>\nreally sick joke on Verant&#39;s part placing a hill giant path<br/>\n*directly through* one of the bandit camps.

There&#39;s<br/>\nno way you should be facing 3 at once, much less 7 at once.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf there is a caster bandit, you must kill it first.  If there<br/>\nare multiple casters, I&#39;m not sure what you can do.  At your<br/>\nlevel, if I got jumped by 5 or 7 melee bandits, I would sing a<br/>\nfew songs to get them fixated on me while the others engaged<br/>\njust one bandit to get it off me.  Then I would hit<br/>\nAccelerando and run in big circles with all the other bandits<br/>\nin tow until my group finished off the first bandit.  Then I&#39;d<br/>\nswing around to let them pick off another bandit from my<br/>\nentourage.  Repeat.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
