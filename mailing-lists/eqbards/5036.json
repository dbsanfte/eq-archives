Mobs have a range of difficulty to them and if the<br/>\nzone population increases and the average level of the<br/>\ncharacters in the zone goes up, the more difficult versions<br/>\nof the mobs tend to spawn. For example, earlier this week<br/>\nI was in Misty Thicket on Brell at an ungodly hour and<br/>\nthere were only 6 people in the zone counting myself. Almost<br/>\nall of the giant wasps that spawned in the 3 hours I was there<br/>\nwere blue or white to me with a rare yellow. (I was level 8)<br/>\nThe next afternoon, the zone had 40 plus people in it and<br/>\nthere were quite a few level 11 plus people farming Mooto<br/>\nand the goblin/orc camp. During the 2 hours I was there,<br/>\nI saw a couple of white wasps and all of the others were<br/>\nyellow. Furthermore, I saw several multi-wasp spawns and<br/>\nthey were all yellow as well so this was not the result of<br/>\npeople killing only the blue wasps!<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scott@...\">scott@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scott@...\">scott@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, August 05, 1999 2:07 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Resistance and Rhythym songs<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scott@...\">scott@...</a> (scott brisko)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis may seem like superstition on my part but the goblin wizards in<br/>\nButcherblock seemed to have been given a boost in their nastiness.
