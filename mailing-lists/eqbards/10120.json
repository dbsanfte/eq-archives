If any of you level 30 and under bards are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in need of a fun time and a good place, I would suggest Solusek&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Eye.  In the last week, I have gone from level 22 to almost 25,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and made about 1400pp (no kidding - I know you big guys are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; saying ~yawn~, but I&#39;ve never had more than 100pp in the bank<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hehe).  I am now the proud owner of 2 Obsidian Scimitars, a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; drakescale belt, a pair of Kobold hide boots, and an obsidian shard.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     My guild and I have been exploring the place for a week now<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and we love it!  Of course, we&#39;ve only gotten as far as the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Foreman&#39;s room but we&#39;ll get a little further after a while.  Our<br/>\n&gt; &gt; group was myself, a 25 rogue, a 25 monk, a 27 ranger, a 26<br/>\n&gt; &gt; paladin, and a 26 warrior.  So far I&#39;ve only died once, which is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; incredible for me.  Hell, I died getting there (forgot to check<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the time and ran smack through the middle of Kithicor at 1 am --<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you writhe in pain....LOADING, PLEASE WAIT).  I have yet to see a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; champion or a mage other than on the ranger&#39;s tracking, but we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; haven&#39;t gotten that direction yet.  We will, poppa needs some<br/>\n&gt; &gt; brand new shoes and sleeves, as soon as we level a few more times.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     Anyway, just a suggestion for those of you who are looking<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for a nice place to hunt.  Although you&#39;ll need a good group, the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; place is a blast so far.  There are lots of &quot;safe&quot; places to pull<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to once you fight your way to them, most are right next to Sol B<br/>\n&gt; &gt; zone lines.  And so far, I&#39;ve encountered no warping bugs for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; MOBS, and no Z-Axis problems, I have no trouble using Lullaby at<br/>\n&gt; &gt; all.  It has saved our asses more than once, I know one time we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; pulled a fire gob shaman, 2 flame gobs, and 2 cinder gobs when<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Singe showed up!  We barely eeked that one out, but damn it felt good!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sorry to ramble on, I&#39;m just in awe of this place!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Weiland &lt;Disciples of Truth&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Erollisi Marr<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; P.S. Of course you know that as soon as I post this I&#39;m going to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; go back and die there 25 times tonight, Murphy&#39;s Law.
