I am on my cleric and<br/>\n/assisting the mob while watching my group&#39;s bars.  The pally - not in my<br/>\ngroup - starts to drop at a fast rate. I figger he&#39;s got his own cleric but<br/>\na remedy wont hurt. As fast as I can drop a rememdy on him he&#39;s dropping off<br/>\nagain. So I chain cast another.  Then say screw that and chain cast a divine<br/>\nlite. Then 3 more divine lites. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe lives!!!  After the fight, in /gu I find out that 2 other clerics were<br/>\ndoing the same thing: chain casting divine light/remedys - heh. So, yeah,<br/>\ndifferent spells for different situations.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)<br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:garramone@...\">garramone@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, January 18, 2001 5:09 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Numbers on Bards<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\ncomplete heal is the most powerful spell in the game.  but obviously a<br/>\ncleric needs to know how to use it along with their other heals effectively.<br/>\n<br/>\nShada, 58 Bard<br/>\nAfterlife</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
