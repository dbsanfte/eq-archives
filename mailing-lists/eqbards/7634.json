Never happen.  In fact, I think the casters are probably lucky<br/>\nto have gotten that ability, as it&#39;s potentially quite unbalancing when<br/>\nfighting uber-mobs like dragons.  &quot;Yeah, I lost a level dying 14 times while<br/>\nfighting Vox, but I would just spawn, mem my spells and nuke until I got<br/>\nkilled.&quot;  This is precicely why Ressurection effects have been made so<br/>\nhorrendous.  Probably casters being able to bind anywhere was to offset how<br/>\nfragile they are should the group get overrun by mobs.  The casters are the<br/>\nleast likely to make it to the zone alive in a bad situation.<br/>\n<br/>\n* SNIP *<br/>\n<br/>\nCasters can gate, they&#39;ll always beat the melee guy to safety.<br/>\nAnd with personal shields and mes, flux, step, etc...they are hardly fragile in<br/>\na bad situation.<br/>\n<br/>\n* SNIP *<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, there absolutely HAS to be a serious penalty for dying; it&#39;s a very<br/>\nimportant part of the game.  Many people make the &quot;game fun&quot; or the &quot;I can<br/>\nonly play two hours a week&quot; argument, but when you consider the impact that<br/>\nbinding anywhere would have on group dynamics and strategy, you quickly see<br/>\nthat it works best the way that it is.  Verant has decided that getting to<br/>\nyour corpse, in addition to the experience lost is what that penalty is.  When<br/>\nthere is a penalty for dying you coordinate your actions and fight with more<br/>\nstrategy.  Verant (and I) want this VERY much.  Conversely, if there were<br/>\nlittle or no penalty for dying, sloppy unbalanced groups would just go into a<br/>\nplace like Mistmoore with little or no regard of how the zone works.  They&#39;d<br/>\njust pull the castle and beat on stuff until everything was dead with the<br/>\nminor annoyance of having to loot their corpses.  I wouldn&#39;t be addicted to<br/>\nthat game.<br/>\n<br/>\n* SNIP *<br/>\n<br/>\nUmm, so running back to your corpse is part of the price you pay?  So why do<br/>\ncasters not have to pay this price?<br/>\n<br/>\nGolias, Solusek Ro - DOES NOT WANT TO BIND, want to be bound in non-cities!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
