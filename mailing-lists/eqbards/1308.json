I went to the Swashbuckler, and he quoted<br/>\nme 250 plat and change.  I decided to think it over.  A couple of days<br/>\nlater, I decided I&#39;d go for it, since nobody was selling barbed whips<br/>\nanymore.  When I showed up at the swashbuckler though, he was asking 280<br/>\nplat for the same sword!<br/>\n<br/>\nAt first, I thought I was just remembering the price of the sword<br/>\nincorrectly, but 280 was more than I wanted to pay, so I decided to forget<br/>\nabout it.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo days after THAT I found someone who was willing to sell me two barbed<br/>\nwhips (finally).  I decided that the best place to meet was at the shady<br/>\nswashbuckler, as it was halfway between us.  While waiting for her, I took<br/>\nat look at his prices, and low and behold... the same longsword was now 230!<br/>\n<br/>\nI have no idea what drives the prices on this guy.  My charisma was the same<br/>\nin all three cases, and my faction stayed relatively consistent throughout.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny ideas?<br/>\n<br/>\nJyzan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
