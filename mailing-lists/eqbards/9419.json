Didn&#39;t spend much time in<br/>\nUnrest because the server was so crowded.  I would recommend places where<br/>\nyou can hunt REALLY close to a server boundary or near guards.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m speaking of two places in particular where I had really good luck at 22:<br/>\nHighkeep basement and Everfrost.  Highkeep you can camp the foot of the<br/>\nstairs.  Run to the guards or even zone to Highpass (a good ways to go).<br/>\nHighkeep is pretty crowded (on Xegony) so you may have probs getting in<br/>\ngroups - but will probably have someone to help if it gets hairy.<br/>\n<br/>\nEverfrost has some nasty trains.  The flag room is nice - but dangerous if<br/>\npeople deep in can&#39;t handle their rooms - the trains will go through the<br/>\nflag room.  While you tend to be pretty safe in the alcove - its not<br/>\ncompletely so - and most groups tend to get lazy and fight far enough out<br/>\nthey are exposed to the trains.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe safest spot is right next to the zone.  You can have someone pull to<br/>\nthat area.  You are then literally right next to the zone.  There is no way<br/>\nyou will die unless you are being really risky...<br/>\n<br/>\nI know how frustrating it is.  I&#39;m only a few levels above you - but the key<br/>\nis finding the right place and the right group.  At the end of 24 - I found<br/>\nthat with the right group (particularly including a 29 druid who could<br/>\nsuccor us away in trouble) a full group with the right class/level mix we<br/>\ncould handle shadowmen with relative ease.  Made 25 and then tried it with<br/>\nthe wrong combo.  I literally lost 25 four times.  The last time falling to<br/>\na half-bubble below 25.  I was real frustrated.<br/>\n<br/>\nI moved to Highkeep basement - got in with a good group (ad-hoc!) and got 25<br/>\nplus over a bubble into the same day (last Sunday) that I last 25 for the<br/>\nlast time.  Monday night - I got in another ad-hoc group in the Aviak<br/>\nPenthouse and got another bubble and a half.<br/>\n<br/>\nBottom line - if you find trouble in a particular area - try not to get too<br/>\nfrustrated - but equip your drum - fire up; Selo&#39;s - and try to find<br/>\nsomewhere else to hunt!<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde of Xegony<br/>\n25 and close to 26!<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: JasonF &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JasonF@...\">JasonF@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Saturday, October 30, 1999 12:32 PM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Talies is retired....
