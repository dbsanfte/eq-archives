We all like different aspects of the <br/>\n  game.  The fact that Verant can capture each of us in a different<br/>\n  way is a feat in itself.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; To each his own - my point is, you hit level 50 - then what? I&#39;m not trying<br/>\n&gt; to take away anything from your experience - perhaps broaden your horizons<br/>\n&gt; just a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  I have taken the time to more fully develop my character, rather than<br/>\n  fighting nonstop monsters or beating up ogre guards.  However, in the<br/>\n  right group getting major exp can be extremely fun with personality<br/>\n  conflicts, jokes, and bloopers.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Last I can recall, these are my stats (of well roundedness)<br/>\n  No gloating, just fyi junk...<br/>\n<br/>\n  smithing, 90.<br/>\n  fletching, 103.<br/>\n  swimming, 180 something?<br/>\n  baking, 82.<br/>\n  brewing, 146.  bleeding brains still increase this.<br/>\n  pottery, 135?  prepatch, however lined vials still increase it.<br/>\n  beg, 21? hehe...<br/>\n  tailoring, 23!  woohoo.<br/>\n  fishing, 125.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Since bards in general have low wis/int, lemme tell ya it&#39;s damn hard<br/>\n  to raise some of these.  But I think I&#39;ve spent many a day fishing<br/>\n  with my L20 buds.  Or baking fish fillets for my monk friends.  Making<br/>\n  bleeding brains for people, and watching people&#39;s reaction when we<br/>\n  all are drinking them.  I have a great time doing all that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I guess in my apparently inept way - I&#39;m advising you to stop and smell the<br/>\n&gt; flowers. Value those around you a bit more - appreciate the little things<br/>\n&gt; that can make for a fuller experience.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  Right now, to attain a truly full experience from EQ I want to do<br/>\n  dragon and plane raids.  To be my best, I would like to be L50 to<br/>\n  do it.  Thus my push for L50.  And the lack of high level bards,<br/>\n  too.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Since us bards need groups to survive (usually), when I cannot find<br/>\n  a good group, I never let it ruin my day.  I instantly pick up my<br/>\n  fishing pole or start making more beer.  In that way your point<br/>\n  is clear, no mobs doesnt ruin my fun all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Btw, thanks for not capitalizing anything!  Very much appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
