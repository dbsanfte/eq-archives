You<br/>\n\t\t&gt; wait for a pull while playing clarity.  Some Ranger or<br/>\nDruid is out there<br/>\n\t\t&gt; running around.  &quot;Inc!&quot; So you stand up, fight one<br/>\nblue/yellow/red mob and<br/>\n\t\t&gt; then wait for another pull...  Then 7am rolls around and<br/>\nyou *sit* for 20<br/>\n\t\t&gt; minutes real time.  So all-in-all you might kill 5 or 6<br/>\nmobs during the<br/>\n\t\t&gt; night if you&#39;re lucky.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever really<br/>\nseen my exp. move<br/>\n\t\t&gt; fighting in the new Kith.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tHmm.  I didn&#39;t see finding mobs as a big problem with<br/>\n\t\tKithicor.  I&#39;m usually able to keep a steady stream of mobs<br/>\n\t\tfor my groups to fight.  Just run out to fetch a new one<br/>\n\t\tbefore the one you&#39;re fighting is dead.  When it becomes<br/>\nday,<br/>\n\t\tlet the paladins find undead using their sense undead spell<br/>\n-<br/>\n\t\tit points them at the nearest undead (which doesn&#39;t work<br/>\nwhen<br/>\n\t\ta necro or SK pet is nearby).<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tThe problem keeping up your mobs/hour ratio in Kithicor is<br/>\n\t\tthat the mobs are just way too tough for their level.  The<br/>\n\t\tharm touches insure you&#39;re going to have at least a minute<br/>\nor<br/>\n\t\ttwo of downtime after the fight.  Most of the mobs are<br/>\ncasters<br/>\n\t\ton top of that, and all can debuff or disease you, thus<br/>\n\t\trequiring even more downtime.  If a party member gets<br/>\nfeared,<br/>\n\t\thalf the time he&#39;s gonna die.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tAnother problem is that it&#39;s an outdoor zone.  There are no<br/>\n\t\tstructured halls for people to find shelter in, so everyone<br/>\n\t\tpulls to the zones.  One group screws up, and everyone on<br/>\nthat<br/>\n\t\tside has to get out.  The undead are not very particular<br/>\nabout<br/>\n\t\twho they attack either, so pulling is a problem, as is<br/>\nhaving<br/>\n\t\tother people&#39;s pulls jumping on you in a tough fight.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t--<br/>\n\t\tJohn H.
