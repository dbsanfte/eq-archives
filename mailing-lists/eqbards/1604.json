Just petition next time you are in game and a<br/>\nguide will bring your corpse to you.  Do not try and recover it again because it is<br/>\nimpossible to do so, at least as far as I have seen.  make your petition something<br/>\nlike /petition I tried to help another player in OOT and ended up stuck in a patch<br/>\nof water and drowned.  Mine was something of the sort and they just told me hang on<br/>\nand I appeared on an island in OOT and there was my corpse on the dock, Hope that<br/>\nhelps.<br/>\nPenaden Songweaver<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lostorder.com\">http://www.lostorder.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nJohn Robertson wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;John Robertson&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:johnr@...\">johnr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ouch, this certainly seems like a sticky situation...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 1)  Was getting stuck in the zone barrier a bug or what was supposed to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; happen?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; No, that&#39;s definately a bug.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 2)  Since my corpse is right at the zone border, will I get stuck again if I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; try to retrieve it?  Can I use the /corpse command underwater to pull my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; corpse away from the zone border?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You should be able to, but you have to be pretty close for this to work.  You<br/>\n&gt; will likely have to swim to the bottom for it to work.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 3)  Why did the locate song not lead me to the other player&#39;s corpse?  My<br/>\n&gt; &gt; theory is that his corpse was not in the Butcherblock zone but in the Ocean<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of Tears zone.  Will the locate corpse zone still point you in the right<br/>\n&gt; &gt; direction even if you are not in the same zone as the corpse you are looking<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for?  If the other player&#39;s corpse was indeed in the Ocean of Tears zone<br/>\n&gt; &gt; then I guess the answer to this question is yes.  If his corpse was in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Butcherblock zone then it makes the situation even more puzzling.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If the corpse was in the ocean of tears, your song would not have located it, so<br/>\n&gt; the corpse is in the BB zone, but it sounds like it wasn&#39;t in the correct zone<br/>\n&gt; space.  This bug happened to a friend of mine once when he died due to a weird<br/>\n&gt; treeform bug.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 4) What is the most likely explanation for the character walking on the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bottom of the ocean?  Another player or just another bug?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That is really odd, since players do a swim animation when they are underwater.<br/>\n&gt; It could have been an NPC, or perhaps a GM, but they swim when they are<br/>\n&gt; underwater as well as far as I know.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 5)  At the time I drowned, there were no GMs online for me to /petition.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Assuming one is online the next time I play, will they automatically<br/>\n&gt; &gt; retrieve my corpse for me since it is at the bottom of the ocean?  I sure<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hope so because I don&#39;t relish the idea of having to go back to retrieve it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; GMs make no promises in this regard, but given the circumstances of your death<br/>\n&gt; (including the bug involved) if you are patient a GM will likely help you.  They<br/>\n&gt; may not though.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Good luck,<br/>\n&gt; Jyzan<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Got an opinion?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Make it count!
