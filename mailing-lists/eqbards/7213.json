Both druids and clerics can also use the shiny brass shield so<br/>\nwe gain nothing over them there.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso the dirk and whip are by no means as good as a glowing crook staff.<br/>\nthe dirk is 6/23 which works out to a ratio of .565 using max damage of 13,<br/>\nthe &#39;Glower&#39; as I hear called frequently is 11/35 which means a hefty ratio<br/>\nof .657, very painful.  The BLW is even worse than a dirk at 7/28 which<br/>\nworks out to a ratio of only .536 using max damage.  A full point of better<br/>\nratio is pretty devastating in a one-on-one fight.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou kited beetles 6 levels higher than you using bellow?  I hate to be rude<br/>\nbut I do not believe you.  Not only would it take forever at the 7 pts a<br/>\nbellow you would have been doing, but the resists would have been frequent.<br/>\nPast that they should have been not &#39;too frequent&#39; but nearly 100%!  Not to<br/>\nmention that running into anything else would have made 1 or 2 stuns fatal.<br/>\n<br/>\nKitasi the disbelieving</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
