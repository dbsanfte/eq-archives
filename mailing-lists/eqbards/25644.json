Win 95/98/ME will not run with more than 512MB.  IF you<br/>\ndo have more than 512MB, you have to add a line to your system.ini that<br/>\ntells Windows to only use 512MB anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nI found this out while considering how much RAM to use for SoL heh.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, there was a message from Abashi that you needed to change color<br/>\ndepth to 32-bit with the new DX DLL.  Can you still use 16-bit?<br/>\n<br/>\nShada<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Christopher Sanders<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is hope.  From what I&#39;ve heard guildmates say, the immediate<br/>\nsolution<br/>\nis RAM.  I will be upgrading immediately to 512 MB of RAM, and then<br/>\nafter<br/>\nthe holidays, will be running with three, 512 MB sticks.  It&#39;s cheap.<br/>\nApprox February or March, I will be splurging for the GeForce 3.  At<br/>\nthat<br/>\ntime, I will do a test with EVERYTHING maxxed, and every option on.<br/>\nHeh..it<br/>\nbetter be perfect.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI am also hoping that, as time goes on, Verant tweaks their EQ dx dll.<br/>\nThere is no reason for me to have to disable my hardware TnL.  I hope<br/>\nthey<br/>\nfix that soon.<br/>\n<br/>\nAtonal<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
