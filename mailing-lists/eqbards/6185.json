To bring<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; the party we have:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Druid 29<br/>\n&gt; Warrior 28<br/>\n&gt; Thief 28 (I think)<br/>\n&gt; Cleric 26<br/>\n&gt; Wizard 26<br/>\n&gt; Bard 26<br/>\n&gt; Bard 24 (me :o)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And maybe a few well wishers, possibly high level, just for fun.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Our general strategy so far:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Camp at graveyard waiting for trains coming from the secret door (I<br/>\n&gt; haven&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; been there this is all blind talk based on suggestions) when the train<br/>\n&gt; happens look for the named gypsie with the pet. I will be singing<br/>\n&gt; guardian/elemeal at a minimum, as well as other magic resist buffs. Nuke<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; gypsy, loot and zone.<br/>\n&gt; My question for folks who have done it is, in your opinion, do we stand a<br/>\n&gt; chance at ALL?
