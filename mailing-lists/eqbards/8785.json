Its damage ratio is<br/>\n&gt;just a little bit better than a Dragoon dirk but it doesn&#39;t have any stat<br/>\n&gt;increases.  What I&#39;m curious to know is where can this weapon be found?  It<br/>\n&gt;looks just like a regular or a rusty dagger and mine is the only one I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt;ever seen.  I forgot to ask the bard I got it from where he got it...so any<br/>\n&gt;help would be appreciated.  I&#39;m guessing that because it has the same<br/>\n&gt;graphic as a regular or rusty many people overlook this fine weapon.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ruldaas Riverdance </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
