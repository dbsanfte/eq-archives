It didn&#39;t stick well enough<br/>\nto be useful though, as you say. I&#39;ve even found some blues resist<br/>\nenough to make it a marginally effective tactic. Others swear by it.<br/>\nStrange.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor any of you bored level 50 types, try the Allizewsaur(sp?) in the<br/>\nOOT. He&#39;s L50 and if he&#39;s not around kill the goblin sacrifice, which<br/>\nspawns in his place until he does spawn. We took out a full group of<br/>\n49-50&#39;s and he is really, really tough.  The only tactic that worked for<br/>\nus was to fight him until the casters were out of mana, then have our<br/>\nwarrior run him around the island while everyone medded back up. It took<br/>\nalmost 2 full mana med&#39;s to finally kill him. At one time he dropped<br/>\nsome very nice gems or jewellry, but it seemed overnight he was nerfed<br/>\nto only drop lizard skin. That was a month or so again so it might be<br/>\nfixed again. If you&#39;ve been wanting a diamond or jacinthe stone that&#39;s<br/>\nthe only place I&#39;ve ever seen one drop.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
