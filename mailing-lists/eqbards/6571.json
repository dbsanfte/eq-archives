I almost never used it when I first got it,<br/>\n&gt;but I&#39;m really enjoying it now.<br/>\n&gt;My question is this, how on earth can you effectively use it on two mobs in<br/>\n&gt;the confusion of melee?  I have enough trouble clicking on the one creature<br/>\n&gt;that my party isn&#39;t fighting, let alone trying to select back and forth<br/>\n&gt;between two.  It would be really nice if we could dynamically assign hot<br/>\n&gt;keys to monsters, then just quickly hit the keys to toggle back and forth.<br/>\n&gt;Ah well, wishful thinking.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Elwyn Heartstring<br/>\n&gt;Level 39 Bard<br/>\n&gt;Erollisi Marr<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
