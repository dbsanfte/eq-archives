The melee damage output with kunark/sov weapons is<br/>\nso much higher than what those 2 were tuned for.  Not to mention these raids<br/>\noften have access to high level buffs<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem (at least on the raids I went to) is that the munchkin mob has<br/>\nhad enough time to get to 50 now.  Obviously there were lvl 50 idiots pre<br/>\nkunark, but they were less and often easily identifible (from what I was<br/>\nhearing at that time).  Now they have Sebillis keys.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I went on my first Vox raid, I sat there silently, in terror that I<br/>\nwould screw something up.  I turned off guild chat and told all my friends<br/>\nto not send me tells.  I asked this list and the high level bards (I think I<br/>\nsent you a tell Sartori, hehehe) what I should be doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not talking about a young guild/ coalition making an honest attempt at<br/>\nVox and failing here.  I admire people who try new (to them) things.  I am<br/>\ntalking about a vetran raid leader who can&#39;t get enough competent players<br/>\nwho merely listen to him to kill a old world dragon.  I am talking people<br/>\nwho blantantly ignore the directions given to them by the raid leader.<br/>\nTheres nothing hard about understanding &quot;DO NOT BUFF YOUR PARTY.  NO ONE<br/>\nSHOULD HAVE ANY BUFFS&lt; IF YOU HAVE BUFFS, DISPEL THEM.&quot;  Theres nothing hard<br/>\nabout &quot;Do not send me tells about loot, the looting rules were made public<br/>\nbefore the raid and will be repeated before we make groups.&quot; There is<br/>\nnothing hard about &quot;Do not move past me, if you fall in a pit or agro a mob,<br/>\nespecially Vox, do not try to run, just stand there and die, we will rez<br/>\nyou.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n/rant off<br/>\n<br/>\nElfson Allegro 55 Veeshan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
