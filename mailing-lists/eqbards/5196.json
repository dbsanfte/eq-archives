If you&#39;ve done testing, then show us<br/>\nthe numbers.  So far everyone who has posted numbers, as far as I can tell, is<br/>\nshowing perfectly reasonable missed note rates.  If you have evidence to the<br/>\ncontrary, if anyone does, we can start to reasonably believe there&#39;s a<br/>\ndifference, but most people seem to not be experiencing what you are.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think it is server specific, btw, since John Kim, who also says his<br/>\nmissed note rates are up, is on the same server as I am, and I haven&#39;t<br/>\nexperienced it.<br/>\n<br/>\nJyzan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
