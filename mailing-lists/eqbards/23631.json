I work on an average of 10-40 machines/week, most running win9x,<br/>\n&gt;winnt, or win2k.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;With ME, I&#39;ve noted a few things...<br/>\n&gt;If you have a PC that came loaded with 98 SE, you are probably ok to<br/>\n&gt;upgrade.<br/>\n&gt;If you have a PC that came loaded with 95, 95a, 95b, or 98 First Edition,<br/>\n&gt;DON&#39;T even mess with trying to upgrade.  Yeah, I know microsoft says it will<br/>\n&gt;work, but you&#39;ll cause yourself more headaches than you know.  If you must<br/>\n&gt;upgrade, upgrade to 98 SE, and you&#39;ll be happier.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;DON&#39;T load PcAnywhere 9.x or up on ME.  Hoses up the network stack, and<br/>\n&gt;causes lot&#39;s of little niggling errors that are impossible to get rid of. It<br/>\n&gt;works on some machines, but not others.  If you have to use PCA, use 98SE or<br/>\n&gt;NT4.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Be careful of device drivers, try not to use anything written for 95 or 98<br/>\n&gt;FE.  if it&#39;s for 98SE, you&#39;re probably ok.  I&#39;ve seen more device drivers<br/>\n&gt;written for the first run of 95 hose up ME machines than I&#39;d care to count.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reload, either every 6 months or 1 year, and reinstall applications.  I<br/>\n&gt;know, it takes alot of time, but is it better to have a clean running system<br/>\n&gt;that you spend 8 or 10 hours on every 6 months doing maintenance, or one<br/>\n&gt;that you will be fighting crashes on every other day?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;With Win2k, same thing applies as above, it&#39;s just a bit easier to backup<br/>\n&gt;your stuff for reloads (docuements and settings directory is a godsend for<br/>\n&gt;this :)  I haven&#39;t noted any major troubles with Win2k boxes unless driver<br/>\n&gt;support is non-existant.  Worst case i&#39;ve seen: some guy managed to get his<br/>\n&gt;to load iomega drivers from the original cd that was sent for win95.  The<br/>\n&gt;only way to fix that box was to reload.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Tips for reloading:  (assumption is that you have a hard drive with a bit of<br/>\n&gt;extra space, in the range of 500mb +)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;copy all the files from your cd in the win9x directory (not the other root<br/>\n&gt;directories, or the subdirectories, you don&#39;t need those) to your hard<br/>\n&gt;drive, in something like c:&#92;win98 or c:&#92;win9x or something.  Make sure you<br/>\n&gt;have a driver directory, with current drivers for all of your hardware,<br/>\n&gt;including modems, motherboard, video, sound, etc.  Also, make sure you have<br/>\n&gt;a copy of the Internet Explorer Installation program for your favorite<br/>\n&gt;flavor (4.x, 5.0, 5.5) if you use that, or the installation file for<br/>\n&gt;netscape (reloading will blow IE out for sure, netscape just won&#39;t run right<br/>\n&gt;until you reinstall it).  After you are sure everything is in place, follow<br/>\n&gt;the next steps:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Scandisk<br/>\n&gt;Defrag<br/>\n&gt;reboot to safe mode MS-Dos Prompt (hit F8 when it says &#39;Starting Windows&#39;,<br/>\n&gt;you have about 2 seconds...I usually just start hitting F8 repeatedly after<br/>\n&gt;the memory count)<br/>\n&gt;Rename your windows directory:  i.e. c:&#92;&gt;move windows win.old  (just in case<br/>\n&gt;something goes wrong :)<br/>\n&gt;Go into the source directory (remember the win9x files?) c:&#92;&gt;cd win98<br/>\n&gt;Run setup with /is (skip the disk check, you&#39;ve already done scandisk and<br/>\n&gt;defrag :)  c:&#92;win98&#92;&gt;setup /is<br/>\n&gt;Fill in the prompts, when it asks you what directory to install to, it will<br/>\n&gt;prompt you for Win.old, change this to Windows.<br/>\n&gt;install device drivers, apps, etc.  All your documents will be where they<br/>\n&gt;were, except for email if you use Outlook Express or Outlook.  You&#39;ll need<br/>\n&gt;to import those and any favorites, cookies, shortcuts, etc. from the win.old<br/>\n&gt;directory (email me if you need help with this).  Once you are happy with<br/>\n&gt;the new load and have gotten everything you need out of win.old, delete the<br/>\n&gt;win.old directory, and you have a clean, reloaded machine.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If you have questions or doubts, please email me (i do this at least once a<br/>\n&gt;day on various machines :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;wow, what a ramble...sorry about the length :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;MacGrough Mich&#39;Rathe<br/>\n&gt;Solusek Ro Blood Tide<br/>\n&gt;32 Songs for the 4th time :)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Definitely good advice. Should save some people a lot of aggravation.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d recommend that if you are doing a complete rebuild of windows that if <br/>\nyou have been having a reoccurring problem with a specific application that <br/>\nyou may want to delete that application&#39;s program directory before <br/>\nreinstalling it. Sometimes the file that is creating the problem is still <br/>\nthere and isn&#39;t overwritten with the reinstall. That&#39;s about the only real <br/>\nreason I prefer to wipe out a partition is to remove any old legacy files.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also prefer to save all of my data on a separate partition for just this <br/>\ntype of occasion along with a ghost image of the &quot;c&quot; partition in case <br/>\nthere were any files that I forgot to copy off.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Windleaf</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
