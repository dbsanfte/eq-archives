Let me ask you a question.<br/>\nDo the people playing &quot;Monopoly&quot; play for competition or for fun?<br/>\nImagine the shoe bought all properties at a 1% discount.  Would<br/>\nthat make you want to be the shoe?  What if that discount was 10% or 25%,<br/>\nor higher? Eventually it won&#39;t be fun to be the hat, because the shoe<br/>\nwill almost always win.<br/>\n<br/>\nEQ is a lot like this skewed Monopoly.  The shoe is the unbalanced<br/>\nclass, and those that like the Hat or the Thimble want the shoe<br/>\nbalanced.  This IS competition, and a lot of people that play, do so<br/>\nfor competition, and their fun comes from the competition, not from<br/>\nthe play.  That is not a bad thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:silky@...\">silky@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well, obviously you are competing - I do NOT compete. Period.  Things like<br/>\n&gt; cheating, duping, kill stealing affect confidence in the game itself - in<br/>\n&gt; the game mechanics, etc. It&#39;s important to stop those things for confidence<br/>\n&gt; reasons, not necessarily because it has such world shattering effects (at<br/>\n&gt; least in EQ in it&#39;s current state)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Competition is not bad.  Don&#39;t make it sound bad.  There is cheating/duping<br/>\nin single player (no competition) games, these have nothing to do with<br/>\ncompetition.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; This is where the difference between play and competition comes in. I play<br/>\n&gt; to PLAY not compete. Competition by it&#39;s nature has a winner and loser -<br/>\n&gt; play does not. Does the first one to lvl 50 get a cookie that no one told<br/>\n&gt; me about?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Competition is one of the primary reasons some of us play the game.  If<br/>\nI want a game to play without competition I could play Tomb Raider 4.<br/>\nNot competing with anyone there, I could spend hours upon hours trying<br/>\nto figure out how to pull that lever, oh how boring, and I&#39;m back to EQ.<br/>\n(PS.  TR4 isn&#39;t any better than 3, or 2 *sigh*)<br/>\n<br/>\nEQ gives us that want/need competition the arena for it.  We don&#39;t want<br/>\nclass balance for competition, we want class balance for diversity. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Again, you are looking at this as a competition. So what if it&#39;s crowded? I<br/>\n&gt; hunt what I can, when I can - if someone else gets it, oh well. Mobs are<br/>\n&gt; good little trains - another is along every X min. like clockwork. If an<br/>\n&gt; area is so massively crowded that I can&#39;t move - I just log - or find<br/>\n&gt; somewhere else to hunt.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you LOG you aren&#39;t playing EQ!  That is not a solution to the crowded<br/>\nproblem.  Verant wants you to play, not log because its crowded.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I regularly visit areas that are WAY under my level. I also regularly save<br/>\n&gt; low level players from trains or certain death - I ENJOY doing that. Is my<br/>\n&gt; presence depriving them of the joy of death? Do you think my presence there<br/>\n&gt; is resented? If it is, I&#39;ve never heard anyone remark on it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I never do this.  Occasionally I go back and kill Dvinn and Dorn, get<br/>\nsome revenge, but I never purpose go de-rail trains or heal.  I don&#39;t<br/>\nenjoy doing it.  Don&#39;t hate me, don&#39;t even look worse on me because<br/>\nof this.  EQ is a game in every aspect, and play the game for your<br/>\nown enjoyment.  Not for what another person thinks should be your<br/>\nenjoyment.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If you let what another has affect YOUR enjoyment - that is a problem of<br/>\n&gt; yours you need to address. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Its not a problem!  EQ is a game in every aspect, and play the game<br/>\nfor whatever reason you want to play the game.  If someone tells you<br/>\nthat you would enjoy the game if you didn&#39;t compete as much, IGNORE<br/>\nthem.  If you enjoy the competition (and many do), go for<br/>\ncompetition, if bad Verant rules make the competition unbalanced, please<br/>\ndo let it be known.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen player X is super powerful and has the Dots and DD and wonderful<br/>\nitems AND a pet that is in itself more powerful than other classes of<br/>\nits level, it causes problems.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy friend, the level 50 warrior cannot get a group, because a necro with<br/>\na pet is better, I cannot get a group, because the necro with the pet<br/>\nis better.  In fact, everyone is DE necros.  Run for your lives!!!  Thus<br/>\nmy enjoyment is NOT affectd by what Joe the Necro has, but by what The<br/>\nNecro class in whole offers.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am not jealous of any 1 person in the game, I am upset that an item I was<br/>\ndying to get for 3 months is removed just before I hit the appropriate<br/>\nlevel to get it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;Can you deny that when too many people are in Unrest, your<br/>\n&gt; &gt;enjoyment of the game suffers?  Do you think it suddenly<br/>\n&gt; &gt;becomes that way once you exceed X number of people?  Of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;course not.  As X increases from 0, the average enjoyment of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the players goes up (easier to break in), peaks, then starts<br/>\n&gt; &gt;to go down.  Being too high level, twinked, having equipment<br/>\n&gt; &gt;unavailable to others, etc, can cause your contribution to X<br/>\n&gt; &gt;to be greater than 1; meaning if things are at the downward<br/>\n&gt; &gt;slope of the enjoyment curve, your presence is hurting them<br/>\n&gt; &gt;more than their presence is hurting you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Excellent!  I was going to respond to just this analysis, but was<br/>\ntoo lazy.  This is exactly whats going on.  I was in unrest the<br/>\nother day and hardly no one was there.  My group wanted to pull from<br/>\nthe second floor, but we couldn&#39;t because there was hardly no one else<br/>\npulling from the first or second floor.  There is a nice range of<br/>\nplayer count where Unrest is fun.   Too few people, and I would<br/>\nspend all my time killing greens for no xp, too many people, and<br/>\nI would spend all my time opening up doors and looking at empty<br/>\nclosets.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLudvaraman</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
