It clacks back and forth between screen resolutions, forces me to<br/>\n&gt;interact in repetative, silly ways, takes way too long timing out on link<br/>\n&gt;failures, and doesn&#39;t give me options for hurrying it along, such as a way<br/>\n&gt;to break out of the timer when I&#39;m sure my link is dead.  It even gives me<br/>\n&gt;a frustrating peek at my screen, showing me that the link has failed, then<br/>\n&gt;goes through attempts and timeouts trying to get back to the login server<br/>\n&gt;when it&#39;s completely hopeless, so I can click in three (!) different places<br/>\n&gt;to make it go away and reconnect.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Some things about EverQuest are outstanding.  Some are abysmal.  Obviously<br/>\n&gt;the plusses outweigh the minusses for me, but oh, what it could be with<br/>\n&gt;some of the easier minusses fixed....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;\tBob<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;ONElist members are using Shared Files in great ways!<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Are you?
