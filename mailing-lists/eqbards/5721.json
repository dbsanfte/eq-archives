The point","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-862401324\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt; &gt; That&#39;s incorrect if we&#39;re all reading it correctly. It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; not being based on whether YOU the player are moving. It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; being based on whether the mob is moving. So the argument<br/>\n&gt; &gt; above stands. If you pull with a DOT spell and the mob<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is running towards you - the DOT isn&#39;t doing any damage.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; And again, long term damage is not as preferred to me as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; damage done up front. I&#39;d prefer to have a lot of damage<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in the beginning and end the fight faster rather than<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the DOT lasting longer.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; are you being intentionally dense?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Are you being intentionally rude?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If you stop, the mob catches you and *TA-DA* STOPS!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You obviously can&#39;t read. Try it again and see what I<br/>\nposted above.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; up running for that long, and be that far away from the <br/>\n&gt; mob when you reach your group/fight spot, don&#39;t pull with<br/>\n&gt; a dot, pull with DD.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That isn&#39;t, and wasn&#39;t the point. The point is that people<br/>\nhave developed play styles with the way that the game is<br/>\nsetup. Using DOT spells to pull is more effective in my<br/>\nopinion than using a DD to pull. Just because someone at<br/>\nVerant got the bright idea that kiting is more important<br/>\nto fix than something like camping, we&#39;re being expected to<br/>\nchange our tactics to something that many of us consider<br/>\nto be much less effective. I never said you had to agree.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; a shaman, I usually pull with my dot, run to my fighting <br/>\n&gt; spot (somewhere out of the usual mob paths) turn and<br/>\n&gt; and get another cast in to slow the monster.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Which is what I do as well. So why wouldn&#39;t we want damage<br/>\nbeing done for the time that the mob is running? If you don&#39;t<br/>\nthen fine, but I do and I&#39;m sure there are others that do<br/>\nas well.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; As for this &quot;I&#39;d prefer to have a lot of damage<br/>\n&gt; in the beginning and end the fight faster rather than<br/>\n&gt; the DOT lasting longer.&quot;, then don&#39;t use dot&#39;s, use<br/>\n&gt; DD.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You&#39;re asking me (and perhaps many others) to change<br/>\nmy tactics just because of a pointless new change<br/>\nto the game. My argument is that the change isn&#39;t<br/>\nneeded and I pointed out what benefits it would be<br/>\nremoving that have absolutely nothing to do with<br/>\nkiting.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegardless, I refuse to deal with you being a jerk and this<br/>\nisn&#39;t Bard related any longer since Bards don&#39;t cast the<br/>\nspells that are being discussed in this thread. This is my<br/>\nlast post on the subject. My point has been made already.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
