Jig actually has no effect<br/>\non mana.<br/>\n<br/>\nCourse, if you can indeed disprove him then I&#39;d be thinking J.M. Capozzi<br/>\nwasn&#39;t really with Verant afterall.  I mean I can&#39;t confirm whether or not<br/>\nJ.M. is legit.  Is this just someone who just joined the list, and knew a<br/>\nheck of a lot about the game and faked it?<br/>\n<br/>\nActually, I doubt that J.M. is a &quot;fake&quot; but wish you consider it, for<br/>\narguments sake.  I have no idea who J.M. is, and have no resource to confirm<br/>\nit for that matter.  Must say, if J.M. were a fake, he or she would be a<br/>\nvery good fake.  But who are we, as the grunts, to know who makes the game<br/>\nanyway?<br/>\n<br/>\nCredits tell us little, as does Verant&#39;s webpage.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like how Lionhead did it: they hired an actual journalist with games<br/>\nexperience to be part of their team.  You check their webpage, and you have<br/>\na writer from the inside giving you personal insights.  Get an idea how they<br/>\nactually tick, and it&#39;s very interesting.
