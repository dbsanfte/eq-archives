Well<br/>\n&gt; I was wondering about the Fanged Skull Stiletto which is DAM <br/>\n&gt; 12 Delay 22<br/>\n&gt; piercing and usable by Bards.  It is apparently not a lore <br/>\n&gt; item so you could<br/>\n&gt; in theory get two of these and be a virtual quisinart.  Does <br/>\n&gt; anyone own one?<br/>\n&gt; Know how to get one?  I have heard that they come from <br/>\n&gt; somewhere in Dagnour<br/>\n&gt; Cauldron.  Perhaps this item is so hard to get that it is not <br/>\n&gt; realistic to<br/>\n&gt; obtain untill really high levels.
