Sniderman&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fuzzbone@...\">fuzzbone@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHad a couple of comments on this.  First of all - I don&#39;t think lag had<br/>\nanything to do with it  Except when the server or routers are lagging - I&#39;m<br/>\nlucky enough to have 784K DSL so I rarely have lag.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the &quot;and&quot; it should be an &quot;or&quot;.  I&#39;ve gotten attacked by these<br/>\nmobs when I had Sonorous Clouding on me - and I&#39;ve been attacked when I&#39;ve<br/>\nhad Camouflage.  I never sing Clouding when others have Cam or vice versa -<br/>\nI know exactly what you&#39;re talking about and have been super careful.<br/>\n Also - this has happened to me while I wasn&#39;t grouped- or the rest of the<br/>\ngroup wasn&#39;t around.<br/>\n<br/>\nA possible theory I&#39;ve heard so far (also mentioned by someone here) is that<br/>\nthere are mobs that cast see invoice on others.  I wouldn&#39;t even be<br/>\nsurprised with the pathing bugs if they are casting from a distance.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the mobs around the lake - I think they are different.  I ran past<br/>\nthem and didn&#39;t get attacked - but the ones in the passageway to the<br/>\ngraveyard - and the cave always seem to.  As far as the castle mobs - when I<br/>\nwas lower and hunted by the lake - I rarely if ever was attacked by<br/>\nthem -unless someone attacked one of them...<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile the cast see invoice theory may be the answer - I&#39;ve been attacked so<br/>\nmany times trying to get to and from the graveyard/cave area - I believe<br/>\nthat Verant added See Invoice to some of those mobs...<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     Starting a couple weeks ago - they would go agro on me when singing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Clouding and when Regular (not Superior) Camouflage is cast on me.  This<br/>\n </span></blockquote>is<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; a major train generator.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Could you clarify your &quot;and&quot; in that statement?  If you sing<br/>\n&gt; Clouding while anyone in your group is camoed or invised, they<br/>\n&gt; are visible (not to you but to the mobs) every time your song<br/>\n&gt; pulses.  This is pretty easy to demonstrate - have a group<br/>\n&gt; member cast invis on you while you are singing clouding.<br/>\n&gt; Target a far-away mob and /con it repeatedly.  Every time your<br/>\n&gt; song pulses, it can see you and the /con message will change.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
