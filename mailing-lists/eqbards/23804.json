I like it heh.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have always kept charm and mez memmed on CC duty.  Esp. with the second<br/>\nmana using charm.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a few things to note ..<br/>\n - have a pet attack hotkey .. charm is too short by the time you&#39;ve<br/>\ntargetted the mob to attack to worry about typing (I also have more messages<br/>\nhere so groups know what I did)<br/>\n- when using the second mana-using charm .. its level cap makes it useless<br/>\non yellows and reds .. switch to Pixie for those<br/>\n- when charming .. beware of pet classes&#39; pets in your group .. if the<br/>\ntiming is off the pets can hit eachother and then the party-members pet will<br/>\nhit YOU<br/>\n- some groups (no matter how many socials) just can&#39;t work with charm .. but<br/>\ndo great on mez<br/>\n- some groups can&#39;t assist to save thier lives (and it would too!) .. if<br/>\npossible charm-only<br/>\n- put /g socials in your charm mez and pet attack keys to help groups adjust<br/>\nto what you are doing and the whole idea of the Bard doing crowd control<br/>\n- ask for cha buffs when you can :)  even with a chanter present .. if it<br/>\ngets ugly and the chanter goes down .. one resist may be all you get!<br/>\n- make sure the group healer(s) is aware you&#39;re doing crowd-control! and is<br/>\nwilling to support you<br/>\n<br/>\nAssuming the groups can adjust to you being the crowd-control, I don&#39;t need<br/>\nextra AC/HPs .. but I&#39;ve had good healing in groups that treated my health<br/>\nwith the same care of an enchanters (and IMHO we don&#39;t get the stun, but we<br/>\ndo have AC - so we will take more hits than a chanter but we take less<br/>\ndamage when hit and don&#39;t go oom - so its a wash).  Granted, thats a big<br/>\nassumtion. :(   When the group healers think of me as a tank thats &quot;trying a<br/>\nbit of light crowd control&quot; that I usually die so fast they go &quot;huh?&quot;.   If<br/>\nthe healers can mentally switch with you when you go from assitant tank to<br/>\nthe crowd-contoller on duty .. you&#39;ll be fine in cha not AC gear.<br/>\n<br/>\nMenuette<br/>\na pied-piper Bard</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
