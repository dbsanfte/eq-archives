Someone else may have said the same, but I skimmed the hundreds of messages, so I may have missed it.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst off, on melee classes and bind.  From what I hear, in the early betas, you could bind your group members anywhere.  People complained about the abusability (malicous binds, for example), so they added the pop up box similar to res spells.  Apparently there were some more complaints (about the box being annoying during combat and such) so they changed it so unless you were casting it yourself you could only be bound in city zones.  Personally, I think the pop-up box is the way to go, and I honestly don&#39;t like the idea of the difference between caster binding and melee binding.  Whether running 3 zones or not isn&#39;t the point, the problem is with the fact that casters and melee classes are treated differently.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, the dark elf quest to get the bind ring.  Yes, it does have class restrictions.  However, so does the guise of the deceiver, and trolls and ogre&#39;s happy use the mask to &quot;de-fat&quot; all the time.  Everyone seems to forget that the race/class restrictions are only restrictions for wearing the item, not using the effect from the main inventory.  This point is sort of moot though, as they have removed the quest until they get around to making the item no drop.<br/>\n<br/>\ncleric soloing....<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, it&#39;s definitely possible.  At the levels you get your new DD spells, they are very effective (14, 29, 44) but as many people pointed out they lose their luster about 5 or 6 levels after you get them and you&#39;re still a good ways away from your next dd.  The undead spells make up for that a little, so it becomes possible, although difficult, to solo.<br/>\n<br/>\nBards still solo much better, the fact they have dot and dd songs and selo allows them to kite with the best of them (clerics are generally reduced to root/nuke which is much less consistent as a cleric (cause on non-undead you&#39;re going to be cutting it fairly close on mana).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMiriana Windryder<br/>\nPriestess of Tunare<br/>\nInnoruuk Server<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nGot Toast?   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.etoast.com\">http://www.etoast.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
