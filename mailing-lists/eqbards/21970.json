I haven&#39;t seen you on recently.  No, you don&#39;t know me, but I<br/>\n&#39;spy&#39; on my fellow Bards on Bertoxx, just to see if there&#39;s been any<br/>\nattrition from nerfs, announcements etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI usually do a quick /who all bard to see who&#39;s on.  More for a boost in<br/>\nself-esteem than anything else.  I actually like to see  high level Bards.<br/>\nIt gives me something to aim for.<br/>\n<br/>\nI saw Lago when I was in EC last night.  There&#39;s just too few of us about.<br/>\n<br/>\nKyrisha - 32 songs... learning 33 tonight.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
