I&#39;d<br/>\nhate to see our new songs be disappointing revisions of existing abilities.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Chromatic Scale<br/>\nLevel: 36th<br/>\nSkill: Singing<br/>\nDescription: A chromatic scale is all the notes an instrument is capable of<br/>\nproducing, generally played starting from the lowest to the highest and then<br/>\nback down; slurred up (ligato), tongued down (staccato).  The Chromatic<br/>\nScale when song by the bard would act much as the Vampiric Embrace necro<br/>\nspell in that it imparts a proc to melee attacks however the twist is that<br/>\nthere would be 5 different types which randomly kick off: magic, fire, cold,<br/>\ndisease and poison based attacks.  These would be DD&#39;s - there by filling in<br/>\nour missing DD ability, but in a uniquely bard fashion (group based, becomes<br/>\nmore powerful as you add members and err... randomly good -- maybe. hehe).<br/>\nVerant of course would come up with some cute little chromatic sparkles to<br/>\nsurround us and multi colored blasts as the proc goes off. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nPS: For those D&D fans, recall the Chromatic* line of spells.  Thanks to<br/>\nwhoever mentioned the confusion bit and D&D earlier -- ya got me thinking.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
