Pulling in PoG is a breeze when you<br/>\nhave lightning speed. In my experience, many things have SoW or better, and<br/>\nthe bard will have the best time making it back to the ambush unharmed (or<br/>\ndead).<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso.. I seem to remember very few times at all that i&#39;ve been either snared<br/>\nor rooted while playing Selo&#39;s.  I don&#39;t remember actuallly being able to<br/>\n*break* them when firing up the song though.  Since this last &quot;fix,&quot; what<br/>\nhas everyone discovered? Can you still be immune to movement hindrances such<br/>\nas these, or can you be caught mid-stride with a root or snare from a long<br/>\ndistance caster?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
