The downtime is 8-9 minutes not<br/>\n15-20.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe ARE comparing apples to apples.  The issue isn&#39;t &quot;Non-stop&quot; action<br/>\n(unless you take the Quake players mentality) but the amount of Experience<br/>\nGenerated over time with little to no risk.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Druid is fighting four at a time as opposed to two.  You have to factor<br/>\nthis into the comparison of bards charming one mob against another.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a Druid has an Enchanter near by to cast Clarity on him that 8-9 minutes<br/>\ngoes down even faster (cut in half?  not really sure).  I know first hand<br/>\nhow quickly a Druid can level quad-kiting - and IMHO it&#39;s equivalent or<br/>\nfaster than bards did kiting without mana.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think we all agree that limiting the kiting ability of bards was the<br/>\nissue.  The issue is the Rez factor, the fact that our mana regen can&#39;t be<br/>\nsped up like others classes are, the conflict with Desperate Dirge, and of<br/>\ncourse - the more general issue of class balance.<br/>\n<br/>\nDespite every flame you&#39;ve made at anyone who disagrees with you - I find no<br/>\ncompelling argument you&#39;ve made that bards are equally balanced as the more<br/>\npowerful classes in the game (not that Bards are the only underpowered<br/>\nclass...)<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Jeffrey Sue [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jsue@...\">jsue@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, October 11, 2000 1:35 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Abashi finally responds... sort of<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 10:25 AM 10/11/00 -0600, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;From: Daniel Sniderman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fuzzbone@...\">fuzzbone@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;Sent: Wednesday, October 11, 2000 10:02 AM<br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: RE: [eqbards] Abashi finally responds... sort of<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;One thing I find ridiculous - I believe that a lot of our &quot;nerfs&quot; came<br/>\n </span></blockquote>about<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;because of other players complaining about bards being too powerful.
