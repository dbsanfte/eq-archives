My exgirlfriend has a highelf enchanter and <br/>\n&gt;we<br/>\n&gt;tested that rumor out. I had her meditate for 15 mins to make sure she had <br/>\n&gt;a<br/>\n&gt;total bar of mana. had her cast chaotic feedback a major DD spell on her<br/>\n&gt;self till she was out of mana. then i we timed how long it took her to<br/>\n&gt;meditate. it took about 5 mins for her to get a full mana bar back at lvl <br/>\n&gt;18<br/>\n&gt;with her wearing 0 int and mana giving items. we did it again and this time<br/>\n&gt;i sang the Jig and timed it once again this time it took about 4 mins<br/>\n&gt;13seconds to get the mana bar back up. so it does help slightly. My theory<br/>\n&gt;is the reason why it helps slightly is because when you are sing the Jig <br/>\n&gt;you<br/>\n&gt;dont consume food or drink. so perhaps the programming has taken the time <br/>\n&gt;it<br/>\n&gt;would take for it to do checks on wheather you ear and drink or not and<br/>\n&gt;applied that to the meditating process. Frankly whether it helps or not. I<br/>\n&gt;sing it anyways during spell caster down times. It is the song i use with<br/>\n&gt;most of my Bad Poems has almost become a tradition in my guild that when i<br/>\n&gt;am singing that song i am telling a bad joke or poem.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Taerian Valmont of Povar<br/>\n&gt;Jester to Erollis Marr<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt;From: Chris &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cjeffrey@...\">cjeffrey@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chrisj@...\">chrisj@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sent: Sunday, November 21, 1999 7:06 AM<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Fw: [eqbards] Re: songs question<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Daniel P.

I don&#39;t think they even bellowed.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I got into a major argument with one of the bards about the Jig thing.<br/>\n&gt;It<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; was funny that laughed off &quot;the old rumor that Jig DOESN&#39;T increase <br/>\n&gt;mana<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; recovery&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The interesting thing about it - one of my best bud&#39;s and guildmates - <br/>\n&gt;a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; cleric - felt that it WAS helping him.  This is a VERY knowledgeable<br/>\n&gt; &gt; player.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I explained to him the &quot;apparent speed&quot; issue - and he still felt it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; increased mana recovery.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The thing to keep in mind about my bud - he lives in a remote part of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Wisconsin - has TERRIBLE connectivity - goes linkdead constantly.  He<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ALWAYS<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; has bad PL/ping.  So I suspect that in the case of these people bad<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; connectivity - the jig song actually may help.   Jig may essentially<br/>\n&gt;force<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; more frequent server updates.  For those of us lucky enough to have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; broadband access - or clean dialups - more frequent server updates <br/>\n&gt;makes<br/>\n&gt; &gt; no<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; difference - so we KNOW jig doesn&#39;t help.  But perhaps for the others <br/>\n&gt;-<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; perhaps it negates the lag caused by the bad connectivity?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Just one bard&#39;s theory here..<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Slyde<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: Jason Rochelle &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Jasroc@...\">Jasroc@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Brett@...\">Brett@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Saturday, November 20, 1999 9:47 PM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [eqbards] Re: songs question<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From: Jason Rochelle &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Jasroc@...\">Jasroc@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On a different topic, I grouped in HHK last week and there was <br/>\n&gt;already<br/>\n&gt;a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bard in the party, using weapons. I had to ask her 3 times what she<br/>\n&gt;was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; singing (so I could sing other songs so as to not conflict) and she<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; finally said &quot;well, mostly bellow, and chains if they run&quot;. Then <br/>\n&gt;after<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; each combat, while the party members were injured, she would sing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Jaxan&#39;s Jig o&#39; Vigor&quot; so that the cleric could get mana back faster<br/>\n&gt;to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; heal. I sent her a private tell explaining jig doesn&#39;t aid mana<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; recovery, and she informed me that she KNEW it did, because a level <br/>\n&gt;32<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wiz told her it did. I suggested she try to test it sometime, she <br/>\n&gt;said<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the wiz&#39;s word was good enough for her. How frustrating! I refuse to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; play Jig for anyone, no matter how many people tell me it helps. I <br/>\n&gt;ran<br/>\n&gt;a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; test myself, and came up with ZERO increase in recovery, so I feel<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; confident when I say to the casters &quot;Jig does not aid mana recovery&quot;<br/>\n&gt;(I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should make a hotkey for that :).
