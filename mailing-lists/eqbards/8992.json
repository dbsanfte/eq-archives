Grouping and causing<br/>\nagrovation of course but that goes with any class. If your healing 13 or so<br/>\npoints per tic for 6 people and you are on the opposite team as me I would<br/>\nbe pissed to :). That pretty much goes the same for buffs.. Your playing<br/>\nAnthem or something adding so much str and attack speed to  every person<br/>\nthats beating on me.. same thing I would go after you first.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a side note I saw some  verry nasty  incident of mob agrovation.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was in Cazic the other night  with my mid to upper 20s group and we are<br/>\npulling this lizard and that lizard. All the way across the courtyard  was<br/>\nan old level 50 cleric friend of mine. We are NOT grouped with him not<br/>\nhaving ANYTHING to do what the 50th cleric was doing. AND we are pulling<br/>\nour pulls to the opposite side of the courtyard. These mobs are INSANELY<br/>\ngreen to a 50th cleric considering most are blue to me at 26th. Anyways,<br/>\nduring the course of our battle  I would see the 50th cleric heal one of his<br/>\ngroup way across the yard, having nothing to do with our group. Our mob<br/>\nwould make a B line for the cleric and we would be off chasing our pull.<br/>\nThis happened several times. I asked the cleric if perchance he was casting<br/>\non our mob or healing us or anything. Nope..  the mob just hated a 50th<br/>\ncleric helping anyone I guess.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as bard agrovation, its not to bad for me even when I am the pulling.<br/>\nIf I start taking damage ill have a caster root and let some one tank. I<br/>\nwield a staff of writhing and a silvery 1h. (sometimes pgt or my duel<br/>\ndaggers for skill)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTuldar newly 27th bard( and playing with sirens pulling EVERY green lizard<br/>\nin cazic train)<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: David Knadler &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dknadler@...\">dknadler@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Friday, October 22, 1999 11:36 AM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Bard Hate...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: David Knadler &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dknadler@...\">dknadler@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I also think Bard Hate is a myth.
