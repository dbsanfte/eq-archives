If you go straight (off the ledge) there&#39;s a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; doorway.  Go through that door and follow the right<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wall.  There&#39;s one passage that will loop back (ends at a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; window above a previous area), but if you skip it and keep<br/>\n&gt; &gt; following the right wall, it&#39;ll take you straight to the room<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with the Solusek Mage.  The room immediately prior to this,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; there&#39;s a door on the left which leads to the king room.
