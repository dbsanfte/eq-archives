However when <br/>\n&gt; you start fighting mobs that double attack for 120 and have 8,000 hit points, <br/>\n&gt; slowdowns are increasingly nessecary.  A Mob with Togors is like hitting <br/>\n&gt; them with a continuous six second stun for 175 mana.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I wasn&#39;t trying to downplay the role of slowdowns.  I was just<br/>\npointing out the differences between slowing a mob&#39;s attacks,<br/>\nand stopping them entirely (stun).  Each have their place, and<br/>\neffectively using them hinges on the player&#39;s ability to<br/>\ncorrectly identify when one or the other will work better.  <br/>\nDefensively, I classify stuns with heals and rune - you can<br/>\nuse it to save someone&#39;s life.  Slowdowns I classify as<br/>\nbattle-time-management (attack speedups, mesmerize, regen,<br/>\nDoTs, wizard option to unload nukes, etc).<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
