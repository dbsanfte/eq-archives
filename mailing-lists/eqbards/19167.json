He&#39;s dueled several<br/>\nplayers in my guild that are 2-3 lvls higher and<br/>\ndefeated them (one was killed by his pet;-( )<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway as I approach 30th lvl I expect to be<br/>\nchallenged by this guy and, since his attitude really<br/>\ngets me going anyway, *really* don&#39;t want to lose...<br/>\n<br/>\nI have never dueled...I am more into the group and<br/>\nmake friends aspect of this game.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo far I figure pixie strike, song of siriens guardian<br/>\nand elemental rythmns will be my main songs....weapons<br/>\nare a T claw and gnoll hide lariet.  (I also have a<br/>\nsilvery axe but figure stunning is a good thing with a<br/>\ncaster....)<br/>\n<br/>\nAny suggestions?<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nSend instant messages & get email alerts with Yahoo!
