For <br/>\n&gt; instance, if you<br/>\n&gt; really, really want a particular class for a specific <br/>\n&gt; function (e.g. manna<br/>\n&gt; battery, evacer, puller) & the only character available is on <br/>\n&gt; a player&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; other PC, it might just be worth it to the group to have a <br/>\n&gt; bard who only<br/>\n&gt; sings the manna song, or a wizard who sits around waiting for <br/>\n&gt; things to get<br/>\n&gt; dicey, or a monk who pulls, feigns, and doesn&#39;t get up again <br/>\n&gt; until it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; time to make another pull. &lt;/shrug&gt;  Any class played that <br/>\n&gt; way is a waste<br/>\n&gt; of the class, but still, maybe the group really, really, wants that<br/>\n&gt; specific need filled.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Peace<br/>\n&gt; Evulia of Tunare<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;                                                               <br/>\n&gt;                              <br/>\n&gt;                    Christopher Sanders                        <br/>\n&gt;                              <br/>\n&gt;                    &lt;christopher.sanders@exp        To:     <br/>\n&gt; &quot;&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;&quot;     <br/>\n&gt;                    erian.com&gt;                      <br/>\n&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;               <br/>\n&gt;                                                    cc:        <br/>\n&gt;                              <br/>\n&gt;                    02/14/01 09:49 AM               Subject:   <br/>\n&gt;   RE: [eqbards] Answers to   <br/>\n&gt;                    Please respond to               Questions <br/>\n&gt; on Loot Rights                <br/>\n&gt;                    eqbards                                    <br/>\n&gt;                              <br/>\n&gt;                                                               <br/>\n&gt;                              <br/>\n&gt;                                                               <br/>\n&gt;                              <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hehe...the loot fairy is welcome to visit me while I&#39;m away.  :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My only question is, how can a person play more than one <br/>\n&gt; character at a<br/>\n&gt; time<br/>\n&gt; effectively?  Yesterday in Dalnir, I was doing CC (heh...it&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; weird being<br/>\n&gt; high enough level to say this) for my group, and it was more <br/>\n&gt; than enough to<br/>\n&gt; keep me busy.  There is no way I could have played, say, a <br/>\n&gt; warrior at the<br/>\n&gt; same time, at least not effectively, much less a class that takes more<br/>\n&gt; situational awareness, like a chanter or cleric (or a bard.  :)  ).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I would be hesitant to be in a group where the same person <br/>\n&gt; was trying to be<br/>\n&gt; 2 classes in the same group/raid.  Especially in high risk, <br/>\n&gt; multiple mob<br/>\n&gt; dungeons, where not even Selos has a chance to save my hide.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sounds like things have worked out, though.  That&#39;s always a <br/>\n&gt; good thing.<br/>\n&gt; :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Atonal<br/>\n&gt; Nearly 30 after a few days in Dalnir!

Were all <br/>\n&gt; people in both<br/>\n&gt; groups in your guild? [Yes everyone in both groups is <br/>\n&gt; technically in our<br/>\n&gt; guild] And 2 of the people (including the tag-along<br/>\n&gt; Enchanter) were being played by your guild leader? [ The <br/>\n&gt; guild leader is<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; Queen and her husband the king were both playing 2 characters <br/>\n&gt; each. She was<br/>\n&gt; playing the second L44 enchanter and her shaman and the king <br/>\n&gt; was playing<br/>\n&gt; his<br/>\n&gt; warrior and a cleric] &quot;Walk on the<br/>\n&gt; guild&quot; means leaving the guild? [Yes I mean leave the guild. <br/>\n&gt; Our guild is<br/>\n&gt; based on the chivalric values and while this was hopefully <br/>\n&gt; only a momentary<br/>\n&gt; lapse of clear reasoning, I wanted them to see just how seriously we<br/>\n&gt; considered this issue.]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As to rules, we have loot rules to this effect that the king <br/>\n&gt; wrote that<br/>\n&gt; primaries get first cut. We discussed this at the time with several<br/>\n&gt; guildmates and some were kinda divided over the rightness of <br/>\n&gt; it. I guess<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; mudding factor was the chanter was actually there. We&#39;re a <br/>\n&gt; fairly small<br/>\n&gt; guild nowadays and this is the first disagreement over loot <br/>\n&gt; we&#39;ve had. I<br/>\n&gt; really think it wasn&#39;t greed as much as it was them having been too<br/>\n&gt; insular.<br/>\n&gt; The king has an odd work schedule (doctor) and so they have never been<br/>\n&gt; involved in Planes raids or high level dungeon raids with <br/>\n&gt; anyone else. We<br/>\n&gt; tend to hang with other guilds like Venator Sapentia as we <br/>\n&gt; have several<br/>\n&gt; dual<br/>\n&gt; guilded or ex&#39;excal friends in VS and so we get out more you <br/>\n&gt; might say.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As to multiples, we currently own 4 accounts: we&#39;ve had <br/>\n&gt; friends quit with<br/>\n&gt; decent level characters and so we took over the account in <br/>\n&gt; one case and<br/>\n&gt; added the third just prior to that for bankspace mostly. We <br/>\n&gt; have a 3rd pc<br/>\n&gt; in<br/>\n&gt; our office in easy reach of either of us so we do play up to <br/>\n&gt; 3 lower level<br/>\n&gt; characters at once usually wizard, necro, and a healer. We <br/>\n&gt; play with our<br/>\n&gt; friends alternates who are similiar level and there&#39;s never <br/>\n&gt; any issue over<br/>\n&gt; loot. We have a third generation of characters started and <br/>\n&gt; nearing their<br/>\n&gt; 20&#39;s now as well. It proves we&#39;re addicted of course but it&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; given us a<br/>\n&gt; chance to try out alot more character types; we&#39;ve probably got one of<br/>\n&gt; everything at this point. I do think there are classes and <br/>\n&gt; places where<br/>\n&gt; playing 3 characters is not a good option. A couple of our <br/>\n&gt; friends have<br/>\n&gt; gotten second accounts from friends or family members as well <br/>\n&gt; so now we<br/>\n&gt; have<br/>\n&gt; an address book of account names and passwords so we can move <br/>\n&gt; people and<br/>\n&gt; items at will.
