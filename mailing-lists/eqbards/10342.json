Yellow<br/>\ncritters the resistance is even more.  And<br/>\nreds--forget it.  At least Psalm of Warmth is<br/>\nguaranteed to do at 5 hp of damage per hit?<br/>\n<br/>\nThex Luteslinger (Tunare)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Psalm does dps damage per hit.<br/>\n&gt; You do Dp damage per &quot;round&quot; (excluding Psalm).<br/>\n&gt; You have H hp.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Mob hits N times per &quot;round&quot; (unchained).<br/>\n&gt; Mob does d damage per hit.<br/>\n&gt; Hence mob does Dm = N*d damage per &quot;round&quot;<br/>\n&gt; (unchained).<br/>\n&gt; Chain increases time between hits by 30% (i.e. drops<br/>\n&gt; Dm by 30%).<br/>\n&gt; Mob has M hp.  (H/M is the important figure)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; With Psalm, your survival time is (H/Dm) rounds.<br/>\n&gt; With Chain, your survival time is (1.3*H/Dm) rounds.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; With Psalm, the mob&#39;s survival time is M/(Dp +<br/>\n&gt; N*dps) rounds.<br/>\n&gt; With Chain, the mob&#39;s survival time is M/Dp rounds.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The better song will have a better ratio of your<br/>\n&gt; survival time<br/>\n&gt; to the mob&#39;s survival time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Psalm:  (H/Dm) / [M/(Dp+Dps)]  = (H/M) *<br/>\n&gt; (Dp+N*dps)/Dm<br/>\n&gt; Chain:  (1.3*H/Dm) / (M/Dp)    = (H/M) * (1.3*Dp)/Dm<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Drop the common factors to get:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Dp+N*dps &gt; 1.3*Dp  if Psalm is better<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Which simplifies to:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; N*dps &gt; 0.3*Dp  if Psalm is better<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; N = number of times a mob hits you per &quot;round&quot;<br/>\n&gt; dps = damage of Psalm per hit<br/>\n&gt; Dp = your average damage per &quot;round&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Assuming Chain is never resisted<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I haven&#39;t double-checked the math in this, as I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; pretty busy<br/>\n&gt; coding. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
