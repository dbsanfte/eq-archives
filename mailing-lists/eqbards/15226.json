But do I want to take the chance of switching<br/>\nto my flute, in case they reappear?  Heck, no.  So I sing concord and<br/>\nthey are sitting ducks.<br/>\n\tI also found it very useful for CRs for humans--a couple of humans died<br/>\nin a nasty train and by the time they returned it was pitch black and<br/>\nthey could not even see their corpses to loot.  So group up, kick on<br/>\nconcord and its lovely ultravision component and you have a couple very<br/>\ngrateful humans.<br/>\n\tI can think of a few other situations where the see invis *or*<br/>\nultravision could be equally useful, so I am not willing to write this<br/>\nsong off quite yet.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Karisma Swiftarrow<br/>\nwww.idrive.com/karisma/web/intro.html<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nYOU&#39;RE PAYING TOO MUCH FOR THE INTERNET!<br/>\nJuno now offers FREE Internet Access!<br/>\nTry it today - there&#39;s no risk!
