SHD, RNG, PAL are hybrids.  the priests are not.  bard is the only<br/>\nroom for discussion.  can we put this hybrid thread to rest?  talk about<br/>\nbinding is fine, let&#39;s just not talk about who is or is not a hybrid.  it&#39;s<br/>\nobvious.  it&#39;s not what your abilities are, it&#39;s where your class came from.<br/>\nonly those 3, and maybe bard, are a combination of two other classes.<br/>\n<br/>\nShada D&#39;ukal, Level 50 Wood Elf Bard<br/>\nErisi Dlarit, Level 24 High Elf Paladin<br/>\nTyria Sarkin, Level 22 High Elf Wizard<br/>\nMithaniel Marr Server<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Dean_Kimes@...\">Dean_Kimes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If that&#39;s your logic why are bards rogue/enchanters?
