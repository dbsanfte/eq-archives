I&#39;ll take a<br/>\n&gt; lesser kiting ability over spending all night medding ANY DAY (which is<br/>\n&gt; about all my cleris seems to do any more).  All I seem to play anymore<br/>\n&gt; is my bard.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  Btw,  bards are way better kiters than druids. Or I should say,<br/>\nit is possible to kite way more effectively with a bard than a druid.<br/>\nVery few people seem to know how to do it though. Chords is<br/>\narea song remember? You can without too much trouble, kite<br/>\n_3_ monsters at the same time. Do not try 4, if they get too<br/>\nclose together (which will happen, since it is what you are <br/>\ntrying to do) one or two will split up and run off a bit, then come<br/>\nback.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Oh, and druid 14lvl dot does 2dam/second. You can kite same<br/>\neven with bellow if you get a sow. Or strafe at the same time and<br/>\nyou don&#39;t even need sow for normal speed monsters. However,<br/>\nI kited 3 blue-yellows or low reds when I was around 14-18lvls<br/>\nsometimes. It&#39;s not as fun always as melee, so I did not purely<br/>\nkite. It took me 5minutes to kill 3 of them. Don&#39;t know how much<br/>\nchords does damage, but I bet my butt it does more than 2dam/second<br/>\nwith a lute at that level. And THEN you add a multiplier for 3 ;)<br/>\nLets just say, I wish I would find the boredom to train my brass<br/>\nskill up so I could use Discord. It is way faster to do damage from<br/>\nwhat I tried with bats and rats.<br/>\n<br/>\n    - Ilkka Salmenkaita, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:isalmen@...\">isalmen@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
