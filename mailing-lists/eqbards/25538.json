Solo?<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, for a while -- but at 16 I think Lake Rathetear a better spot for xp.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy most memorable battle was fought solo in EK.  I was 19th lvl and using my all instrument attack against a gorge hound.  My hit points were dropping faster than I thought they should and with less than half a bubble of health, the hound dropped at my feet.  To my surprise, I discovered another dead gorgehound behind me, explaining the extra lost hit points.  It really brought me around to being proud of what I could do with a bard.  After all, there aren&#39;t many classes that can solo two gorge hounds at 19 and then be ready to do it all over again with just a few minutes of downtime.<br/>\n<br/>\nTyunes of Rodcet nife<br/>\nbard of 53 missed notes  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nFind a job, post your resume on Yahoo!
