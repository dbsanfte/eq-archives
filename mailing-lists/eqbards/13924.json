Part of the<br/>\ndesign of the dungeon was to make the foo widgets interesting.  Perhaps<br/>\nin Guk, they are pages of a tome which tell the story of why the Frogs<br/>\nand trolls hate each other so much (ok that may not be too great) or<br/>\nwhat happened in Lower Guk (IE why are all those undead there).  When<br/>\nyou finally get the &quot;container&quot; (the actual tome), you have achieved an<br/>\nunderstanding of the Froglok people (and why they flip in combat) and<br/>\nthus worthy of recieving the greatest treasuere of the Frogloks (a short<br/>\nsword of foo fighting).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt might also be me, but I dont really the &quot;rare drop&quot; concept.  If I do<br/>\nthe quest, I want the reward, I don&#39;t want to kill him 25 times to get<br/>\nthe reward. (I did the bullsmasher quest 48 times!, leveled 5<br/>\ncharacters  Rare drops are just a way to keep people entertained while<br/>\ndoing the same darn thing over and over again.  Then again without them,<br/>\nthe world would have to be pretty darn massive since you would need alot<br/>\nmore zones.
