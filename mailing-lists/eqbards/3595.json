This included several side-trips<br/>\nto play Mr. Postman on the Bardic FedEx quests., which, btw, netted about 2<br/>\nplat.  Cheap night.<br/>\nKeep in mind that he knew exactly where he was going, didn&#39;t have to wait<br/>\nmore than 5 minutes for the boat, and had no zone-crashes.  <br/>\nAverage zone-time seemed a bit longer than others, but maybe that&#39;s just<br/>\nsubjective.<br/>\n<br/>\nTalies for Berthold<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It&#39;s a small virtual world after all.&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
