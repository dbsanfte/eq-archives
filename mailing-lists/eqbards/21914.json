Suladan 55 still plays his bard<br/>\n&gt; pretty much.  Kaldivar 53 not really enjoying high level life <br/>\n&gt; (hard to get<br/>\n&gt; good groups, exp so slow, etc. etc.) so he has been leveling <br/>\n&gt; up a warrior<br/>\n&gt; and playing other classes.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Lately, I have been playing 52 Cleric and 51 Enchanter.  <br/>\n&gt; Learning these<br/>\n&gt; other classes is more interesting to me at the moment.
