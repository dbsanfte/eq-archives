When the quest was<br/>\nfinally fixed a couple months back, people were creating 1st level mule<br/>\ncharacters to kill the koalindl fish at the Temple of Life in Qeynos.  This<br/>\nallowed them to avoid the major faction hit with their main character.  The<br/>\nmule character then gave the fish to the main character ( I admit I did this<br/>\nbut only because my faction got screwed earlier by trying to complete the<br/>\nquest legitimately before it got fixed).  To complete the quest now, the<br/>\nsame person has to acquire all the quest components.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think the best way Verant could handle this is to make quest components NO<br/>\nTRADE and keep magic items NO DROP.  That way, you could put quest<br/>\ncomponents in the bank until you got them all and eliminates using mule<br/>\ncharacters to collect the items.  This would also allow Verant to start<br/>\ngiving better rewards for quests because it ensures that the player<br/>\ncompletes all the necessary steps and earn the reward.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Another thing, although not specifically bard related except in that bards<br/>\n&gt; probably do more quests than anyone else simply because they can, is the<br/>\n&gt; constant changing of items to no drop &#39;willy nilly&#39;.  I went to the bank<br/>\n&gt; last nite and literally could not remove 7 of my 8 containers from the<br/>\n&gt; bank<br/>\n&gt; because if I did I would not be able to put them back.  I would have to<br/>\n&gt; carry around over 1 backpack of stuff if I did.  Why does Verant think the<br/>\n&gt; solution to everything is to make an item no drop.  Bizzarely the Bozemite<br/>\n&gt; Pestle, which to my knowledge no one has figured out the use for is now No<br/>\n&gt; Drop.  Honey Jum on the other hand, while it now requires considerable<br/>\n&gt; faction and 30gp instead of 5gp to obtain, is not.  Go figure.  Why should<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; have to carry this stupid emerald shard halfway across Norrath to get the<br/>\n&gt; other piece, when it would be so much more sensible to put it in the bank<br/>\n&gt; while searching for the other piece.  Sigh, thank goodness it doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; weigh<br/>\n&gt; 10 lbs.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tKitasi the questly nerfed<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nEnter ONElist&#39;s Friends & Family Program <br/>\nWIN $100 to Amazon.com!
