Tell me about your wonderful adventure getting<br/>\na Polish Garnet Tommychopper. Why do I think the story would go something<br/>\nlike this:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;We spent four cold rainy Norrath days and nights in the Highhold Pass.<br/>\nMany foul gnolls fell to our blades.  We dealt with shamans, brawlers and<br/>\nchampions.  Some fights were so close we praised the gods that we survived!<br/>\nAnd then thru the mist, he appeared - the head muckity-muck of the MuckTail<br/>\nClan - Granix Mucktail himself!  We took a deep breath, we drew our swords,<br/>\nwe said our prayers and then.........<br/>\n<br/>\nCecille begins to cast a spell...<br/>\nToronto begins to cast a spell...<br/>\nTalishar begins to cast a spell...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd when the particles cleared the air...<br/>\n<br/>\nCecille auctions PGT bids start at 250pp!<br/>\n<br/>\n(For those of you who don&#39;t play on Innoruuk server, the names have NOT been<br/>\nchanged to protect the guilty Ks&#39;ers.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt would be an entirely different game if......<br/>\n<br/>\n1.\tThere was no camping/farming (lots of good ways to fix this - don&#39;t<br/>\nreally matter how)<br/>\n2.\tThere were no Kill Stealing (again good ways to fix and perhaps we<br/>\nare actually gonna see some implemented.)<br/>\n3.\tThere was no internet (ie: spolier sites and instant flow of<br/>\ninformation)<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Ok, so this is Guk - where do we go from here?&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Who&#39;s got the maps?&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Lemme log quick and grab one&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Nm, I&#39;ll print one off me laptop - one sec&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that&#39;s not the way it is so we end up with a player driven economy.  My<br/>\ngroup has lots of money and we buy the stuff we want/need and simply avoid<br/>\nthe ks&#39;ing campers.  We did have one really lucky night in the Tae room in<br/>\nCazic and got some rubi panties.  The next night was KS-Hell and we have not<br/>\nbeen back.  Stoopid Kyle, does he really think that we don&#39;t have see invis?<br/>\nSo the moron sits by the throne.<br/>\n<br/>\nRight now - its damn near impossible to get the stuff you want the old<br/>\nfashion way so you end up buying it and hunting other places for xp.  Let&#39;s<br/>\nsee some gators drop some rubi - mebbe they ate some one who was wearing<br/>\nsome!  I know they ate me and my steel plate!<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso have great armor is only marginally better that having &quot;average&quot;<br/>\narmors.  It looks a whole lot better!  But the real &quot;twink&quot; for power is in<br/>\nstat jewelry, stat items, and uber-weapons.  Those things will make a decent<br/>\ndifference in your performance.  Armor is just the most visible twink.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLast night, our group spent 4 hours in Unrest and we got virtually a full<br/>\nset of small bronze - pretty good night.  So, what is the &quot;right&quot; thing to<br/>\ndo with it?  Sell it to the local young warriors and endure another 2 hours<br/>\nof hard luck tales and haggling over 2pp here and 4pp there?  Or would it be<br/>\nok with you if I started a gnome warrior and gave it to him when his corpse<br/>\nstopped decaying in 15 minutes?  Or would it be ok with you if I just gave<br/>\nit to the next cute little wood elf who might look even cuter in all bronze<br/>\nwhile I am waiting for the wiz to break camp and port us back to<br/>\ncivilization?  <br/>\n<br/>\nPut a little magic happiness in some ones life - twink them!~<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\nBard of the 30th song<br/>\n&lt;Spirit of the Moon&gt;<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:John.Curry@...\">John.Curry@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:John.Curry@...\">John.Curry@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tTuesday, October 05, 1999 10:38 AM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n\t\tSubject:\tRE: [eqbards] Twinking<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:John.Curry@...\">John.Curry@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tMy Bard, has never ever been given a single item or money!<br/>\nNot that I do<br/>\n\t\tnot have friends who offer.
