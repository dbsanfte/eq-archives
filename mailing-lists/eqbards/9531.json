Of course they already have To go find<br/>\nfood and water too (egad!).  I think having npc&#39;s to fix things would help<br/>\nas you&#39;d know they&#39;d always be there AND they would charge money that would<br/>\nbe permanently out of the economy as well.  This would greatly improve the<br/>\nrole-playing aspects of the game and preserve the economy.  More people<br/>\nwould also be buying merchant sold armors and weapons because they knew they<br/>\ncould replace them and because they could be fixed by cheaper pc<br/>\nsmiths/tailors (if Verant was smart).  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis stuff would be a big job to code but would make the game tons more fun<br/>\nin the long run as there would be many more goals available than just<br/>\nreaching 50th level (or whatever limit).

Sure I<br/>\n&gt; would, but items would not need to be so rare if they had <br/>\n&gt; some chance of<br/>\n&gt; being lost.  Currently the only way an item ceases to exist <br/>\n&gt; is if there is a<br/>\n&gt; bug, someone sells it to a merchant, or if the owner quits EQ <br/>\n&gt; and doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; pass on his possessions.  These are not sufficient.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[snip]<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree.  Once a fairly decent item enters the game, there is little to no<br/>\nchance of it ever &quot;leaving&quot; the world.  There needs to be an infinite money<br/>\nand/or equipment &quot;sink&quot; added to this game.  I would love to see a &quot;item<br/>\ndegredation&quot; system implemented.  The majority of gripes will come from the<br/>\nmelee classes - who rely almost exclusively on their equipment.  It would<br/>\nalmost be a requirement to learn the skill that allowed a character to<br/>\nrepair damaged items.  The other big gripe would be, &quot;I spend X amount of<br/>\ntime looking for a bind, now I have to look for someone to repair my<br/>\nequipment as well?&quot;.  A lot of people would whine about a change like this -<br/>\nI would love to see it though.  What about allowing a MOB who kills you, to<br/>\nloot one item from your inventory (and then it&#39;s gone forever)?  Actually,<br/>\nthat might be way too drastic (I&#39;ve already died 8 times this level :p )<br/>\n<br/>\nDesmei Sightblinder<br/>\nLvl 30 Bard [Povar]<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a> with<br/>\nthe subject lol.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
