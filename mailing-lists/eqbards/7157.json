I don&#39;t play at<br/>\n640x480 so I can&#39;t put my instruments in a bag.  They (along<br/>\nwith weapons) take up 4 of my 8 main inventory slots.  Due to<br/>\nweight concerns, I had to give up backpacks for large bags.  <br/>\nI have one 6 slot weight reducing pack, one 4 slot weight<br/>\nreducing pack, and two 6 slot large bags.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s a total of 22 free slots in my pack.  1 slot goes to my<br/>\n4th instrument, 1 slot for bandages, 1 slot for a pumice<br/>\nstone, and 2 slots for food and drink.  5 slots are currently<br/>\ntaken by unbankable no-drops.  That leaves me just 12 slots<br/>\nfor loot, and I&#39;m not going to give them up for the dozen or<br/>\nso different types of foraged food/drink.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe no-drop change will help, as would a 10 slot box of<br/>\naku-bar or whatever. Another possible change (could we add it<br/>\nto the petition?) would be allowing you to open containers in<br/>\nnon-640x480 resolutions from inventory slots on your hotkey<br/>\npad.  Then I could keep all my instruments in a bag, freeing<br/>\nme to carry 4 more containers.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
