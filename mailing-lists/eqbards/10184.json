I think what you&#39;re doing is wonderful.  I really wish that<br/>\nI would have gotten into the &quot;merchant&quot; business myself.  A friend of mine<br/>\nis the trading, buy-low/sell-high fiend.  He constantly has incredible items<br/>\nand mountains of loot.  Unfortunately, it can really cut into your actual<br/>\n&quot;adventuring&quot; time.  I was one of those players who _never_ did any quests<br/>\nin my lower levels, and generated all my loot from creatures that I could<br/>\nbeat solo (I grouped maybe twice from level 1 - 15).  Needless to say, I was<br/>\none miserably poor bard.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; * Is it outside the spirit of the game?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No way.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; * What, if anything, can I do to dispell the illusion that I <br/>\n&gt; am a twink?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>All you can do is explain to them.  Some will think you&#39;re a twink anyway.<br/>\nNothing you can do to change their opinion, so I wouldn&#39;t even bother.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; * Buying lambent armour is I feel in-character for this <br/>\n&gt; character.  And, I <br/>\n&gt;   never thought twice about it until I was reading some <br/>\n&gt; recent posts. Will I <br/>\n&gt;   be hated for it? Is it wrong? Is it simply jealousy?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Heck no.  You have every right to play your character however you see fit.<br/>\nIf others disagree... big deal.  It&#39;s a computer game.... no one should get<br/>\nthat aggravated over a game (even though they do).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Galeras (Any suggestions?)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Coinspinner.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDesmei Sightblinder<br/>\nLvl 32 Bard [Povar]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
