Like the previous<br/>\n&gt; poster said, the tower is linked to the barroom.  If you are in the barroom<br/>\n&gt; and no one is in the tower, the mobs in the tower will come down to the<br/>\n&gt; barroom when they spawn.  I believe the barroom is linked to the magi room.<br/>\n&gt; I was camping the magi room last Saturday and to our surprise in walked a<br/>\n&gt; noble.  What was even a bigger surprise is that one of the partymembers got<br/>\n&gt; a BS tunic off of him.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>In all truth the bar room and the tower are linked because of the thin<br/>\nfloor.  All mobs in that area can see whatever in both rooms whenever they<br/>\nspawn.  While in the barroom you will routinely see a spawned mob attack<br/>\nsomeone in the tower.  As for the Magi and the hand room the chance of you<br/>\ngetting clobbered is dependent on where the train goes from the<br/>\ntower/barroom.  IF they go down the stairs they may come after you.  If<br/>\nthey come down the hallway they may actually come after you in the hand<br/>\nroom.  BTW when you hear someone screaming train watch your singing.<br/>\nSomehow I was able to grab the tower train when it passed by the hand<br/>\nroom.  I am fearing that I got added to the the mobs shit list when it ran<br/>\nby.<br/>\n<br/>\nTreilanin Loreweaver <br/>\nHonour Guard, Karana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
