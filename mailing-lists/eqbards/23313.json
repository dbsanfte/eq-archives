Improving<br/>\n&gt; Crowd Control capabilities of Bards helped; and improving healing for<br/>\n&gt; Shamans and Clerics could be another.

However<br/>\nclerics give up a LOT to be as good at healing as they are. If you are going<br/>\nto improve shaman/druid healing, clerics better get thrown a pretty big bone<br/>\ntoo.<br/>\n<br/>\nElfson Allegro 50 (WOOHOO!!!!)
