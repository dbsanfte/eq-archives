I asked a<br/>\n&gt; person that killed the musician if it was a lore item or magical or<br/>\n&gt; anything, but as far as he could tell, it was neither.  it has the same wt<br/>\n&gt; 0.5 as a regular drum, so I am curious to know if it improves songs any<br/>\nwhen<br/>\n&gt; used with songs.  Since it was off a named mob, the guy did not want to<br/>\nsell<br/>\n&gt; it to me just yet, because no one knew the worth.  anyone know about this?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Learic Lovejam of Xegony.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; _______________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Get Free Email and Do More On The Web.
