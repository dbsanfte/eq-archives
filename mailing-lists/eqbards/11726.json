There are<br/>\nseveral E&#39;ci bards who post a lot on this list.  Off the top of my head,<br/>\nFaras or Aloro are the highest level and they are in their mid-30s.  Don&#39;t<br/>\nknow if any of the high level bards on E&#39;ci subscribe to this list.  If they<br/>\ndo, they don&#39;t ever post.  Of the regular posters, here is the guild<br/>\naffiliation of the ones I remember:<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin: Mystical Alliance<br/>\nLaluni: Mystical Alliance<br/>\nFaras:  Crimson Legacy<br/>\nKitasi: Armigers of Mirth<br/>\nAloro:  Flying Brethren <br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t speak for the other guilds, but there are at least four bards in the<br/>\nMystical Alliance that are of similar level to you.  Send me a private note<br/>\nif you want more info.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf there are other E&#39;ci bards on this list that I have left out, please send<br/>\nme your name and guild info as well.  I plan on trying to organize guild<br/>\nevents over the Christmas holidays in Mistmoore and Lower Guk to help all<br/>\nthe bards in my guild get the lambent armor components.  If you and other<br/>\nmembers of your guild would like to help out it would be appreciated.  I&#39;ll<br/>\npost more details later on.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\tScott Nicholson [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scott@...\">scott@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tSaturday, December 11, 1999 4:39 AM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject:\t[eqbards] E&#39;ci Bardic guild?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Scott Nicholson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scott@...\">scott@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Greetings, my experienced colleagues.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; _Rhimshot bows_<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am Rhimshot, a bard of but the 17th song.  None come before me in my<br/>\n&gt; family, so no generational gifts aided me in life.  I am finding it harder<br/>\n&gt; and harder to defeat creatures that should be defeatable by myself.<br/>\n&gt; However, I had the chance to join 2 of my fellow bards in Highhold pass<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; had a wonderful time.  I would love to have the opportunity to travel with<br/>\n&gt; my fellow bards again.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thus, I turn to you for guidance and support.  Is there a guild for bards<br/>\n&gt; on the planet of E&#39;ci?  Or a good guild which is heavily populated with<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; singing folk?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thank you for your help,<br/>\n&gt; Rhimshot<br/>\n&gt; E&#39;ci bard of the 17th song<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; _Rhimshot waves_<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;                Frustrated with Internet Searching?<br/>\n&gt; Try AskScott - Your Guide to Finding IT on the Internet<br/>\n&gt;                  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.askscott.com\">http://www.askscott.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt; with the subject submissions. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
