Its AC 12 and plus 5 stamina. Thats only a 2 point loss in AC and<br/>\nit weighs, get this, 1.5 pounds. I have Steel all the way around right now<br/>\nexcept the tunic and weigh 65 lbs without anything in my inventory, and<br/>\n72lbs with my normal packs and accoutrements. My dex is 120 agil 108 Str 85.<br/>\nI wear Dex and Agil jewelry a blackened iron crown gives me plus 5 str along<br/>\nwith plus 5 to all the protections. But you definitley want to invest in a<br/>\nLJ tunic, for 40-60pp you cant go wrong. I figure I will trade mine in soon<br/>\non Rubicite or Mithril, but at that point I have to worry about my Str<br/>\nagain.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: John Buenavides [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jbuenavides@...\">jbuenavides@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, July 29, 1999 6:34 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] fighting twinking<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: John Buenavides &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jbuenavides@...\">jbuenavides@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou know what&#39;s really sad?  I wrestle with the decision to restart<br/>\nmy currently &quot;of the 11th Chorus.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t pump my strength all the way, I had decided when creating my<br/>\ncharacter to &quot;play the bard&quot; -- which meant being a great singer /<br/>\ninstrumentalist  and  being an extremely charismatic person.  So I<br/>\nhave 100 Dexterity and 100 Charisma.  My strength is only 80.  (I do<br/>\nhave the basic +2 ring from a jeweler friend, and a purity belt, but<br/>\nI would really like to get some earmufflers!)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first time I donned my banded tunic, I was awed by how good I<br/>\nlook in it.  Admit it, how many characters get that golden armor look<br/>\nwithout resorting to bronze?  And then when you complete the outfit<br/>\n(I actually hate the headpiece, so I never bought it), you get that<br/>\ngolden/blue-boy look.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the damn thing was so heavy that you have to watch what you loot.<br/>\n And I was training my tailoring at the time.  Not to mention the<br/>\ninordinate amount of time it takes to loot your own corpse.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, off goes the armor, into two backpacks in the bank, and I started<br/>\nmy poaching-in-the-nude era.  That&#39;s also when I saw my Defense skill<br/>\nfinally catch up with my level.  That&#39;s also when I first met Ness<br/>\n(who probably conned me red, inspected my inventory and found out I<br/>\nwasn&#39;t wearing anything ...)<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, anyway, back to the present.  I&#39;m level 11 now, and the only<br/>\nmonsters I can get exp from are those that do incredible amounts of<br/>\ndamage and have bash skills to boot.  I come out at half life with<br/>\nblues, and blacks can kill me if I don&#39;t kite them around the block a<br/>\nfew times while I heal up.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne time after getting easily killed by a darkweed, I decided to take<br/>\nthe banded out of cold storage.  Lo and behold.  Darkweed, easy solo.<br/>\n Young Kodiak, can&#39;t even hit me enough times before it starts<br/>\nrunning away.  I was a happy poacher with two HQ bear pelts, and four<br/>\nHQ cat pelts.  Granted, I was encumbered at 100 lbs, but when I&#39;m<br/>\nfighting, my two songs give just enough strength not to suffer any<br/>\nencumberance penalties.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill, it would be nice to have 100 strength in the first place, just<br/>\nso I can walk to the inn instead of crawling.<br/>\n<br/>\nPheh.  Hopefully I&#39;ll find some more strength boosting items soon.  I<br/>\njust need to make money now.....<br/>\n<br/>\nQuit on Stormtower?  NEVER!  Well ... not a second time ...<br/>\n<br/>\n(My original character was Sturmtower, who reached level 4 before I<br/>\ndecided that agility doesn&#39;t do as much as dexterity.  I didn&#39;t twink<br/>\n-- there was nothing to twink at that level anyway.  But ol&#39;<br/>\nStormtower _is_ not really the original.)<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nStormtower of the 11th Chorus<br/>\na very happy new owner of a Dragoon Dirk<br/>\nand subsequently cash poor<br/>\n<br/>\n_____________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nFree instant messaging and more at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://messenger.yahoo.com\">http://messenger.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nATTN ONELIST USERS: stay current on the latest activities,<br/>\nprograms, & features at ONElist by joining our member newsletter at<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
