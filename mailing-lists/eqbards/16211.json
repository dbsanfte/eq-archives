In","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1551782090\">I would love to see that list of spawn times if you get the chance.<br/>\n<br/>\nI often share the duty of puller/timekeeper for my groups and it would be<br/>\nquite helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn so far as what I&#39;ve learned...<br/>\n<br/>\n19.5 min is the time for Najena, Permafrost and Sol A. That is the time from<br/>\nthe death of the previous mob to the spawn of the new mob. Usually I round<br/>\noff to 20 min because it usually takes us at least 30 seconds for the fight.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbashi has stated on the boards that spawn times are directly related to<br/>\nprocessor load on the machine that is serving the zone. Therefore, if a zone<br/>\ngets very crowded, expect to see time between spawns increase. Also, it is<br/>\nmy belief that the bigger zones have a longer spawn time (since there are<br/>\nmore things to keep track of in the zone) therefore, spawn times in L Guk,<br/>\nSol B and West Karana should be longer than other zones such as Blackburrow<br/>\nor Najena. I also wouldn&#39;t be surprised if there were a spawn time / level<br/>\nof mob ratio that exists.<br/>\n<br/>\nDraelon<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Jeff Illian [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jeff@...\">jeff@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, March 15, 2000 4:06 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Ghoul Assassin Advice?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Jeff Illian&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jeff@...\">jeff@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAll I know is that when I am camping something in Lower Guk, I have three<br/>\ncount down timers sitting on my desk timing seperate spawns.  When one of<br/>\nthem beeps, I notifiy the party that spawn is about to happen and in every<br/>\nsingle case that I can remember, I&#39;ve been dead on accurate (within 30<br/>\nseconds or so).  When we started camping the Assassion/Supplier that<br/>\nmorning, we had a small debate whether it was 32 or 34 minutes and over the<br/>\nnext 8 hours or so EVERY single spawn was almost exactly 34 minutes after<br/>\nthe &quot;death&quot; of its placeholder/predecessor.  When I camped the Lord, he and<br/>\nhis guards also had exactly a 34 minute spawn time from the death of the<br/>\nlast one.  I camped the King&#39;s room in Sol A a couple of months ago for 9<br/>\nhours (I was there for XP and we ended up decaying about 6 Rings of the<br/>\nGoblin Lords :( ) and not once during that period did the expected spawn not<br/>\nshow up exactly 20 minutes after its predecessor was dispatched.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause I like to do it, I&#39;m almost always the time keeper whenever I&#39;m in a<br/>\ngroup camping something and so far I observed Guk/Sol B are almost always 34<br/>\nminutes, Sol A is almost always exactly 20 minutes and I have a whole<br/>\nlisting of spawn times for other camps at home...  The only time I&#39;ve seen<br/>\nthese spawn times messed up is in Sol A camping the EXG... he sometimes<br/>\nseems to skip a spawn cycle or 2 with no placeholder and... and in<br/>\nsituations where the server (not network) is very laggy.  On bad server days<br/>\nyou can throw the clocked spawn times out the window.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe it&#39;s Prexus and we just are super consistant, but for the most part<br/>\nthe timings are right on.<br/>\n<br/>\nTaneran<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Ryan Honeyman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:honeyman@...\">honeyman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, March 15, 2000 2:34 PM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Ghoul Assassin Advice?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Ryan Honeyman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:honeyman@...\">honeyman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and or nada loots from the named.  Something is on the 34 min cycle but<br/>\nit<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wont always be the Assassin with a mask or dirk.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Regarding the spawn time cycle.  It&#39;s as close to a fixed time as<br/>\n&gt;   possible, but you all stating that it&#39;s 34 mins misleads a lot of<br/>\n&gt;   people.  It&#39;s not 34 mins, it&#39;s whenever each object in the zone<br/>\n&gt;   has it&#39;s reset() called.  Verant uses an LPmud code variation for<br/>\n&gt;   their object control, and as I have invested several years into<br/>\n&gt;   development of the source of this mud, I can attest to the un-<br/>\n&gt;   predictability of timing resets.  It all depends on how much is<br/>\n&gt;   going on in the zone, and what the load on the server supplying<br/>\n&gt;   the zone is.  I&#39;ve seen 30 min spawns in Guk, I&#39;ve also seen 55<br/>\n&gt;   min spawns in Guk.  It depends on how many players are there, how<br/>\n&gt;   many objects are in the zone, and how many NPCs need resetting<br/>\n&gt;   each cycle.  I&#39;m sure other factors are involved.  This applies<br/>\n&gt;   to every zone as well.  It looks like Verant sets a time for each<br/>\n&gt;   object to reset, but according to how much needs to be done - your<br/>\n&gt;   camped NPC may be the last thing to get reset, hence giving you<br/>\n&gt;   the impression of a variable (or longer) spawn time.  IIRC, Guk<br/>\n&gt;   is just like most other zones with a 25/30 min reset.  Due to the<br/>\n&gt;   activity of the zone, you could see noticable delay in spawn resets.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Anyway, just adding my knowledge =)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Harmonic.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; GET A NEXTCARD VISA, in 30 seconds!
