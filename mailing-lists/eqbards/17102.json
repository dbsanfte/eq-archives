Add to this that in the expansion there will be<br/>\n&gt; zones twice as large as West Karana and that there is only going to be one<br/>\n&gt; GG point and 2 boat docks on the new continent and this does becomes a<br/>\n&gt; valuable addition.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I put up with this at lower levels, but at the higher<br/>\nlevels...  They really need to increase the range of this song<br/>\n(yes I know they just increased it).  As it is right now, once<br/>\nthe song starts, someone can run out of range in about 0.4<br/>\nseconds.  It is *impossible* for me to keep a group of 6 in<br/>\nthe song effect unless we all start off running at normal<br/>\nspeed, then I start the song.  If someone gets lagged, takes a<br/>\nwrong turn, or chases a ghost for longer than 0.4 seconds,<br/>\nthey are out of range.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Overall:<br/>\n&gt; I have said this numerous times, so I will say it again :)  The Bard class<br/>\n&gt; is unique in the fact that we amplify the power of the party.
