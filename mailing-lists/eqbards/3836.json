The young<br/>\n&gt;kodiaks and kodiaks there give pretty good experience, the<br/>\n&gt;occasional wandering wisps will give good loot, and if you<br/>\n&gt;ever get in trouble there&#39;s lots of open space to flee/kite/<br/>\n&gt;heal/zone.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever died in West Commonlands,<br/>\n&gt;and the griffons and giants do a good job of keeping the riff<br/>\n&gt;raff out.  There are dervish and orc camps there too, but they<br/>\n&gt;are tough to crack without a group (7-9 mobs usually).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;John H.

I was there for several hours pre equip loss, and<br/>\na few since re-equipping.  If you get on the hill to the<br/>\nwest of the camp, you&#39;ll see that it is very long in the N/S<br/>\ndirection.  When a group pulls from the front (where I<br/>\nsee most of them camp) they tend not to get the dervs<br/>\nin the back.  I&#39;ve seen a group engage the front ones, <br/>\nand the back ones will, sometimes, just stay put.  I think<br/>\nthis happens most when there are no dervs in the mid<br/>\npart of the camp, breaking the aggro help chain from<br/>\nthe front derv to the back dervs.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith careful planning, lament and bellow, I was often<br/>\nable to break that chain myself, and take the rearmost<br/>\nderv out of the camp.  Like soloing bandit camps in<br/>\nW. Karanas, it needs to be done just right, or you find<br/>\nyourself with 6 opponents (a green caster derv resisted<br/>\nmy lament, and took exception to the effort.  He was<br/>\ndead in the middle of the camp, and everyone came<br/>\nto help :(   )<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTindayen, 16th level bard<br/>\nSwifthawk, 6th level shaman</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
