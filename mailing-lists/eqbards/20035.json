Every time<br/>\nI try charm, mez or selective fear someone (often more than one) freaks<br/>\nout.  Last time I dared use charm (to pull a stoneleer off our<br/>\nenchanter, help healer, add damage, list goes on) the monk in the party<br/>\ntook my head off for the audacity of not letting him tank 3 mobs at<br/>\nonce.  Is it just me falling into groups who refuse to try new things<br/>\nor what?  I miss HK when people would be yelling at me if I didn&#39;t<br/>\ncharm/mez fast enough.  Tho, I&#39;ve noticed Pixie Strike having it&#39;s mez<br/>\nportion resisted 7/10 times on any blue con mob or above, only slightly<br/>\nbetter with instrument.  Is this a function of my cha (136) or do the<br/>\nrumors I hear of it sucking soon after you get it ring true?  It&#39;s<br/>\nscary that Solon&#39;s is more reliable than Pixie.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd on Lament, using it at all.  It worked nicely when I first got it<br/>\nand I loved it for a long time but haven&#39;t used it since the early<br/>\ntwenties.  Every time I tried to use it I got a resist and the mob<br/>\n(plus friends) aggroed on me and ground me into bardpaste.  Even with<br/>\nlute it&#39;s dangerous at best.  I&#39;d like any advice you folks have on<br/>\nit&#39;s proper uses.<br/>\n<br/>\nNinev Rudeflute<br/>\n34th and in need of a piercer<br/>\nE&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n--- &quot;Reece, Tom CPT- 25IDL G4&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n*crop*<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The bards who know how to handle crowd control, lament  pull, and <br/>\n&gt; manage the mob&#39;s hate list are few and far between.
