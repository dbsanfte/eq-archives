Also I&#39;ve never played on a pvp server, so I don&#39;t know <br/>\nhow hard it is for a newbie bard to survive.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe main drawback to gaining levels via quests, is that you are unable to <br/>\ndevelop your fighting skills, which, on a pvp server, I would think is <br/>\nextremely important. Always keep singing your songs to build up your <br/>\nsinging skill where ever you go.<br/>\n<br/>\nJig of Vigor is very helpful for you as you can jump-run to get away from <br/>\npeople/creatures. Just make sure your stamina doesn&#39;t go down too low when <br/>\ndoing this. Jig will help recover the stamina, but not enough for you to <br/>\nconstantly jump. Also, until you get your Accelerando at level 5, if you <br/>\nneed to run from an NPC, make sure you slide-run. Meaning you press your <br/>\n&quot;forward&quot; key along with your &lt;ctrl&gt; and either &quot;left&quot; or &quot;right&quot; key. Due <br/>\nto pathing, you will be able to outrun standard speed NPC&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor general combat, get used to weaving songs. You should be weaving your <br/>\nChant of Battle with your Chords of Dissonance. But you&#39;ll need to keep an <br/>\neye out since Chords is a short range AOE song and will aggro other things. <br/>\nMake sure, after battle, that you are no longer singing Chords or you might <br/>\nmake a guard or vendor angry.<br/>\n<br/>\nFeel free to keep us posted on your goings on. It&#39;d be interesting to see <br/>\nhow a bard does on a PVP server.<br/>\n<br/>\nWindleaf Mistsong<br/>\n46th level lurking balladeer<br/>\nRed Sky<br/>\nBertoxxulous</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
