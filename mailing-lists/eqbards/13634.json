Even<br/>\nso ct in most spots is not green at 30 I know people who were there until<br/>\n40. Unrest the basement is also good for exp at 30. Some parts in guk are<br/>\ngood for 30 to.  Hell  you forgot some dungeons like Sol A which is baren.<br/>\nOr mm same thing. Fact of the matter is your argument is off somewhat<br/>\nbecause there are zones at your level exmpty while at mine their aren&#39;t any<br/>\nthat are even low.As for Ice giants inside perma the spawn rate is 4 hours.<br/>\nBesides the fact that they are usually camped.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain it&#39;s not as crodwed at the lower levels how else would I be playing a<br/>\n21 shaman fine? CT is empty on E&#39;ci most of the time. Why because most 30-39<br/>\npeople are in lower guk. Hell us high levels didn&#39;t go to guk until 40+.<br/>\nAgain there are far less high level zones and consdiering that most people<br/>\nare getting up their 40&#39;s now they need to concentrate on it.<br/>\n<br/>\nNaeeldar<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Gwyn Carnegie &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gcarnegi@...\">gcarnegi@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Monday, January 24, 2000 4:34 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] PoA bard quests plus a rant<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Gwyn Carnegie &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gcarnegi@...\">gcarnegi@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; From: &quot;Naeeldar&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jackal@...\">jackal@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; You have multiple dungeons.

And because the crowding is so bad, all<br/>\n&gt;those 45+ players with nothing to do are creating new characters just so<br/>\n&gt;they can have something to do. So the problem has trickled down quite<br/>\n&gt;nicely so it really has affected us all.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Not many high levels are plagued with overcrowded.

Yes, I can hunt on reaver hill. Mistmoore is<br/>\n&gt;&gt; too deadly for me as higher levels train things out of the castle too<br/>\n&gt;&gt; frequently to make the entry area safe.

Stay on the wall by the<br/>\n&gt;lake.<br/>\n&gt;Permafrost- get a group and work the entrance only.<br/>\n&gt;Everfrost- You can try doing Icy Orcs but the site always camped and the<br/>\n&gt;spawn rate is too slow to really make it worthwhile.<br/>\n&gt;Upper Guk is nice for early 20s as long as you don&#39;t mind ruining your<br/>\n&gt;Froglock faction.<br/>\n&gt;Befallen- this dungeon will green out for your group in a couple of<br/>\n&gt;levels but bottom floor is still good _if_ it&#39;s not camped all to hell<br/>\n&gt;by farmers.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;These are places you can try. Forget Unrest and Aviaks as those spawns<br/>\n&gt;are just too flipping full already<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; The group my bard plays with though has so little downtime that<br/>\n&gt;&gt; we waste a lot of time when we are fully capable of knocking<br/>\n&gt;&gt; something off, only there isn&#39;t anything available. That<br/>\n&gt;&gt; frustration has cost me more guildmates than I care to think about.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;And the failure of the high level characters to understand the plight of<br/>\n&gt;the mid level characters has caused more guilds to explode then I care<br/>\n&gt;to mention.  It can be heartbreaking to watch.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Its really frustrating hearing about all the new quests on the plane<br/>\n&gt;&gt; of sky when quests are my favorite part of the game.
