I hope to see you in-game again. But if not, know<br/>\nthat you are well respected on Innoruuk as well as this list, and you will<br/>\nbe missed.<br/>\n<br/>\nOperaman Overtone<br/>\n&lt;Spirit of the Moon&gt;<br/>\nInnoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;    From: Ryan Honeyman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:honeyman@...\">honeyman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Harmonic and the future.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   First of all, I&#39;m still around, I read you all everyday. =D<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   I haven&#39;t played Everquest in about 2 weeks now.  I may not<br/>\n&gt;   play Everquest again.  In short, the game was taking away time<br/>\n&gt;   I needed to spend working and most importantly taking care of<br/>\n&gt;   my girlfriend.  For almost 14 months (since beta 3) she has<br/>\n&gt;   endured 6-8 hour sessions of EQ on a daily basis.  Clearly,<br/>\n&gt;   the game came before she did in all cases.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Everquest wasn&#39;t that great either, I know I complained about<br/>\n&gt;   it often, but I&#39;d keep coming back for the people when I could<br/>\n&gt;   have turned and looked 5 feet beside me and spent time with<br/>\n&gt;   that one person who counted.  Everquest/Verant are full of<br/>\n&gt;   shortcomings and I kept hoping that things would finally get<br/>\n&gt;   &#39;fixed&#39; or &#39;work properly&#39; - but that was just a dream.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   I want to play again, just not now.  Things are going very well<br/>\n&gt;   right now and I don&#39;t want to bring back the frustration that EQ<br/>\n&gt;   caused me.  I&#39;ll read the posts here where relevant, but I won&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;   post much.  I&#39;ve got big work projects demanding more and more<br/>\n&gt;   time.  I&#39;ve also got a kitten and a beautiful girlfriend demanding<br/>\n&gt;   more time as well.  There&#39;s no way I&#39;m going to return and play the<br/>\n&gt;   length of time I once played.  But I hope to return soon, maybe in<br/>\n&gt;   a few more weeks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Harmonic Distortion, 50th unchained melody.<br/>\n&gt;   League of Antonican Bards, The Wind Spirit&#39;s Song<br/>\n&gt;   Innoruuk<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Ryan. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
