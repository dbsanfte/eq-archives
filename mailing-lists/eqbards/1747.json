Perhaps the Mobs are<br/>\nangry at you because you have been killing so many of their friends.  I was in North<br/>\nKaranas around levels 11 through 14 killing beetles with my party.  We noticed an<br/>\nodd effect which we called &quot;Beetlejuice&quot;.  It seems that after I had gone out to<br/>\nfetch a dozen or so pincers, borers, and scythe bettles, that every beetle in the<br/>\nzone became aggressive towards me, the fetching bard.  Normally, these beetles are<br/>\nnot aggressive at all.  Suddenly after fetching and killing lots of them, they all<br/>\nbecome aggressive and they ALL start running across the entire zone to hunt me<br/>\ndown.  I am not kidding.  This happened.  It was rather convenient, but eventually<br/>\nbecame overwhelming.  The solution, however, was easy.  I just had to zone out and<br/>\nback, and they were all passive again.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have hunted in Crushbone and Befallen a lot, and I have noticed that I am a<br/>\npreferred target, but not to the extent being reported in this thread.  I have never<br/>\nhad a Thug ignore a party that was fighting it to come and fight me *if* I had not<br/>\ndone anything personal to it.  I have also spent a lot of time in Derv camps in<br/>\nWcommons, NRO, and SRO.  Perhaps you are just so succesful killing these mobs they<br/>\nare developing a collective hatred for you&lt;g&gt;.  Anyway, try zoning and coming back,<br/>\nand good luck.<br/>\n<br/>\nNarcissus of Povar<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think you may not be witnessing the complaint here. At least some of us will<br/>\n&gt; be standing somewhere, farther away from mobs than other players, NOT singing,<br/>\n&gt; maybe not even in a group. Someone else attacks a mob. One or more mobs rush<br/>\n&gt; past the attacker and attack &lt;me&gt; the bard. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
