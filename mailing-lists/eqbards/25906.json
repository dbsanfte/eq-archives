It&#39;s especially annoying when you are going through<br/>\nsomething over & over again (e.g. Jecht shot, if you&#39;re playing FF X) &<br/>\nhave to watch the same animation over & over.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith the combat interface, it&#39;s  (again) this pathetic stop-action setup,<br/>\nwith constant pauses to navigate endless dialog boxes.<br/>\n<br/>\n*** That doesn&#39;t bother me.  Actually...I like it.  They should put in an<br/>\noption for real time strategy if it&#39;s not there already, since some<br/>\n(including Kaz, I guess) find time stopping a bit too easy.  For me it&#39;s a<br/>\nrefreshing change of pace from EQ, which frequently comes down to hand-eye<br/>\ncoordination.  If I want a *difficult* game I&#39;ll pickup where I left off on<br/>\neach of the Tomb Raiders.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace<br/>\nEvulia of Tunare</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
