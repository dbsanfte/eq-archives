The effect of this evac<br/>\nis random and the group could end up at any druid or wizard port in<br/>\nNorrath. The other cost of the song would be that it uses 250-300 mana<br/>\n(1.5-2 bubs) therefore if the bard evacs from Guk and ends up in Gtr Fay<br/>\nthey can&#39;t keep using the song to get back to S Ro.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Upgraded Charm song at level 39 for mobs level 37-49. We can charm a<br/>\ngiant, why can&#39;t we charm a Dar ghoul knight or a Sonic bat?<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Invis to undead is another option (but what level can it be used?). Will<br/>\nwe need invis to undead in Kunark and is it worth using a song slot for it.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) A mind wipe song would be great for bards, a flute based song that<br/>\nmezzes and mind wipes the enemy.<br/>\n<br/>\n5) A song that allows bards to EVADE combat (cross between feign death and<br/>\nthe rogue&#39;s evade skill). This song would be useful for group settings, if<br/>\nthe bard is taking a beating he simply sings this song and it&#39;s fools the<br/>\nmonster into thinking he is one of them for 5 seconds, in this time the<br/>\ngroup has a chance to make the mob attack someone else (this would be good<br/>\nfor a bard as it uses our roguish abilities aswell as our acting/performing<br/>\nside). This would not work in solo settings though as the monsters would<br/>\nhave no one else to attack.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a few ideas here aswell as some songs that have already been<br/>\ndiscussed. I think the bind song would be cool but it&#39;s a bit too late now.<br/>\nThat song should of been introduced in the mid 20&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nMadagan Songweaver, Bard of 41 Songs &lt;Guardians of Light&gt;<br/>\nVeeshan Server<br/>\n<br/>\nPs Died twice last night in the level after hell (ouch, 2 bubs of exp gone<br/>\njust like that. Lucky I had 2 level 49 resses on hand).
