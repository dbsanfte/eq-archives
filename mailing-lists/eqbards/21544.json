Turn it in to the *MALE* banker in FV.  He will then give<br/>\n&gt; you a 6-slot container with a combine button for the coins.<br/>\n&gt; Since you already have the ones from Dalnir&#39;s and Kaesora, we&#39;ll skip<br/>\n&gt; those.<br/>\n&gt; City of Mist- One drops from the Captian of the Watch (or something like<br/>\n&gt; that, I lost my detailed list :o/ )<br/>\n&gt; Emerald Jungle- Must be Foraged for.  Grab a nearby druid and exchange a<br/>\n&gt; lil<br/>\n&gt; mana for the foraging ;o)<br/>\n&gt; Lake of Ill Omen- The Bloodgill gobbies in the lake (look at the base of<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; pillars around the center of the lake) carry these, and are probably the<br/>\n&gt; toughest creatures you&#39;ll have to fight in this quest.<br/>\n&gt; The Overthere-  Check out the big pit in the center of the zone and kill a<br/>\n&gt; scorpoid (can&#39;t remember the exact name, but it&#39;s the rarer of the two<br/>\n&gt; kinds<br/>\n&gt; of scorpions in the pit).<br/>\n&gt; -all of these coins are fairly common drops-<br/>\n&gt; Put them in the box the banker gave you, hit combine (now it looks like a<br/>\n&gt; treasure chest), give it to him, and Voila!  you have a Nostrolo&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; Tamborine<br/>\n&gt; (and you will notice the difference IMMEDIATELY).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; NOTE:  Make *SURE* you have an empty spot in you general inventory for<br/>\n&gt; when<br/>\n&gt; he gives you the box for the gem (not sure about the tamborine, but always<br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt; good idea).  If your inventory slots are full, you will get the &quot;dropped<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; the ground message&quot; but the box will be gone (ie: time to head back to<br/>\n&gt; Erudin again).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Enjoy!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
