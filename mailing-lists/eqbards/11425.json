Usually when you go to<br/>\n&gt;   fight the ghoul lord, you aren&#39;t after the helm.  So when it appears,<br/>\n&gt;   it&#39;s like:  Aww man, he dropped the friggin helm, that sucks.  So,<br/>\n&gt;   to answer the question, the SSB is the common drop.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree with this, everyone wants the ghoul lord to drop a ykesha, but<br/>\nit&#39;s a really nice helm. I only wear the Crown of Frogluk Kings because<br/>\nI refuse to wear a plate helm, being a female wood elf, and the Crown<br/>\nhas no Graphic. I wore an Exectuioner&#39;s Hood before the Crown, and it<br/>\nalso has very nice stats and is relatively easy to get. For a bard, I<br/>\nthink I&#39;d prefer the Hood, but I think for the price you paid for the<br/>\nbarbute, that was a real win, and certainly a great upgrade from steel.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; the Crown of the Froglok Kings, and<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   I heard of a L40 full group holding the tower on live side.<br/>\n&gt;   Anything less than that I think you&#39;d be asking for trouble.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>A L40ish group that knows what they are doing can hold the tower on live<br/>\nside, but the tower contains the frogluk priest and the crusader. The<br/>\nfrogluk King is much deeper, and his room when fully spawned is<br/>\nsomething like this line up..<br/>\nFrogluk King (L49 Paladin w/LoH etc)/Frogluk Guk Knight (L48/49<br/>\nWarrior)/Jin Frogluk Shaman (L48-49 Shaman) on the throne<br/>\n<br/>\n4 Bok Frogluk Knights (L42-46 Warriors), can have Kor Frog Shamen<br/>\n(L42ish shamen) in their spots<br/>\n<br/>\nOverlooking the room can be the tactician, a L48-50 frog wizard, and yes<br/>\nhe will cast Gravity Flux and recently Ice Comet&#39;d (OWWWW)<br/>\n<br/>\nand a few others.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve done the Frog King area with a group of 6 L49-50, the trick as<br/>\nalways is breaking the spawn, then keeping a steady pace of pulling. You<br/>\nmust have an exceptional puller. You can also successfully do this room<br/>\nwith 12 L40-45 people, but be wary of that tactician, because he&#39;ll drop<br/>\na L40 fast, and give you flashbacks of dying to a festering hag at L20.<br/>\n:(<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Crown is the King&#39;s common drop btw (rare is the Mithril 2Hander),<br/>\nand I&#39;ve begun seeing them for sale/trade on our server. They are not<br/>\nthat great stat-wise, I think AC 10 +20 fire/cold, and give light like a<br/>\ngreater lightstone. The fire/cold saves are awesome for dragon raids<br/>\nhowever. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAriell Thunderwolf, Karana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
