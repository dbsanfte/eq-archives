Once there was a group there i asked about<br/>\nlooting icy greaves, they said they needed 4 pair (no bards in group...<br/>\ngo figure). That night I returned and got in a group camping king room,<br/>\nthey had cleared the room, next round (2nd or 3rd elite) I got greaves.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you decide to go to the room invis, beware, the Goblin Wizard can see<br/>\ninvis.<br/>\n<br/>\nUldar Ulfangson<br/>\n32nd Bard, Rodcet Nife<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; So far the longest I&#39;ve specifically camped an item was the icy greaves. <br/>\n&gt; That took 2 and a half hours.  So far my cleric has spent at least 4 hours <br/>\n&gt; on each of the items required for his armor.  I don&#39;t envy the clerics for <br/>\n&gt; this quest, that&#39;s for sure. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
