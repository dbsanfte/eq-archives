I just got sent this joke and being one who likes to <br/>\nshare a jest and a good tale or two I had to share it with all my fellow <br/>\nbards:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nA Mom is driving a little girl to her friends house for a play date.<br/>\n&quot;Mommy,&quot; the little girl asks, &quot;how old are you?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Honey, you are not supposed to ask a lady her age,&quot;  the mother warns.<br/>\n&quot;It is not polite.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Ok,&quot;  the little girl says, &quot;How much do you weigh?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Now really,&quot;  the mother says, &quot;these are personal questions and are<br/>\nreally none of your business.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nUndaunted, the little girl asks, &quot;Why did you and daddy get a divorce?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;That is enough questions, honestly!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe exasperated mother walks away as the two friends begin to play.<br/>\n&quot;My mom wouldn&#39;t tell me anything,&quot;  the little girl says to her friend.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Well,&quot; said the friend, &quot;all you need to do is look at her drivers<br/>\nlicense. It is like a report card, it has everything on it.<br/>\n<br/>\nLater that night the little girl says to her mother, &quot;I know how old you<br/>\nare, you are 32.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe mother is surprised and asks, &quot;How did you find that out?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I also know that you weigh 140 pounds.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe mother is past surprise and shock now.  &quot;How in heavens name did<br/>\nyou find that out?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;And,&quot;  the little girl says triumphantly, &quot;I know why you and daddy got<br/>\na divorce.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Oh really?&quot; the mother asks. &quot;Why?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Because you got an F in Sex.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
