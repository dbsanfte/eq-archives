(Been using it a lot","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1546532926\">Here&#39;s my take on the whole issue.<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure of this but this is just a couple of<br/>\nobservations I have made using lullaby extensively.<br/>\n(Been using it a lot since I got it at level 15)<br/>\nEvery song pulses at every tick (6 seconds) as far as<br/>\nI can tell. And lullaby/nod is no exception. I think<br/>\nevery time nod pulses the mob has to make a savings <br/>\ncheck to see if it resists or not. Assume we have a<br/>\nspell caster that resisted it, and then it begins <br/>\ncasting. If the casting does not take more than 6 <br/>\nseconds, there is no chance that nod will be able to <br/>\ninterupt it. Since NPC casters do not suffer the same<br/>\ncasting time limitations as PC casters do, most are <br/>\nable to get a spell off before the next pulse of nod <br/>\nand hence can cast without being interupted. However,<br/>\nsometimes when the mob resist nod, it attacks first and<br/>\nthen cast. When this happens, the attack and the casting<br/>\nmight not be complete within 6 seconds so when nod pulses <br/>\nagain and the mob fails the savings, then it is nodded<br/>\nand it&#39;s casting is interupted. This is what I seem to<br/>\nobserve a lot. YMMV.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDarrian Ashoka<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nBid and sell for free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://auctions.yahoo.com\">http://auctions.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
