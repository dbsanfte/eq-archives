We have had 3 caster deaths that I<br/>\nknow of in the last 3 months.  I alone have died twice that many times.<br/>\nAnother bard in our guild died three times in one night due to stupid<br/>\ngroupmates.  I was luckier and only died twice due to the same groupmates.<br/>\nOne of our casters hasn&#39;t died in 5 levels.  He has only died 4 times in his<br/>\nentire career up to around level 24.  They&#39;re average downtime after a death<br/>\nis 4 minutes.  It takes me that long just to mem spells much less run back<br/>\nto my corpse.  Granted the memming will be shorter, hopefully I won&#39;t find<br/>\nout how much shorter tonite. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
