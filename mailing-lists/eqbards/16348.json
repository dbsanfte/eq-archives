But I think that the original post focused on the effectiveness of<br/>\nChains versus Snare/Root for purposes of preventing a mob from escaping in a<br/>\ndungeon where said mob might pull a train back. Obviously, the attack speed<br/>\nof an escaping mob isn&#39;t much of a concern, so I compared Chains to<br/>\nSnare/Root purely on a &quot;mob-stopping&quot; basis.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Lyrnia Jongleur&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Lyrnia@...\">Lyrnia@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Actually, if the bard knows what they&#39;re doing, chains is BETTER<br/>\n&gt; Than snare.
