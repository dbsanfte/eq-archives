Excellent spell,<br/>\ngroup or solo.  Same basic effect as drowsy, and it drops AC as well.  Means<br/>\nI take less hits, and hit the critter harder.  That&#39;s a good thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome later songs made soloing a LOT easier, but I won&#39;t give away all my<br/>\nsecrets.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;and 2) make me live longer.  When the mobs got down to 1/3 to 1/4 life, I&#39;d<br/>\n&gt;switch to bellows and warsong (if my health was okay)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;For Partying:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Melee:<br/>\n&gt;I would take preferance to singing Anthem, and switch to healing (and step<br/>\n&gt;back from the fight to avoid the shit list effect) with my mandolin.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce again, when we&#39;re getting hit in excess of 60 points per swing, even<br/>\nwith my 11 per tick with a lute, it&#39;s not worth the loss of my blades.  Dead<br/>\nmobs give you plenty of time to heal.  Live ones don&#39;t.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Fighting magic users:<br/>\n&gt;I would sing/twist the rhythm songs (to boost resistances) and anthem.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\nFound that the Rhythm/Psalm series didn&#39;t do our group much good.  Even with<br/>\npercussion, and hitting 50 MR, we were still getting smacked around by<br/>\nspells.  And every two seconds of melee I miss using an instrument means<br/>\nabout 25 more damage the rest of my party has to make up.<br/>\n<br/>\nSwitched to an old standby instead..Lucid Lullaby.  I&#39;d rather the caster<br/>\nnot cast, than take my chances resisting the spell.  Lullaby does an<br/>\nexcellent job interupting the casters.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;With more than 14 million emails exchanged daily...<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;...ONElist IS the place where the world talks!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
