Been<br/>\nworking a certain way since the game started - and they don&#39;t like it - so<br/>\nthey nerf it.  But other things they don&#39;t like - they can&#39;t change because<br/>\nplayers are used to it working a certain way even though it&#39;s broken.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>They haven&#39;t nerfed it.  They&#39;ve fixed the way haste songs/spells interact<br/>\nwith haste items.  Previously, any haste item combined with a haste<br/>\nsong/spell was making the attacker hit at the haste cap.  Clearly a problem.<br/>\nOk, so we&#39;d gotten used to the &#39;bug&#39; and were taking advantage of it...<br/>\nwould you get pissed at your bank if their ATM was giving you 20&#39;s instead<br/>\nof 10&#39;s and only debiting your account for 10&#39;s and they went and fixed it?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Mask, on the other hand, does nothing more than change the appearance of<br/>\nthe bearer and grant ultravision - hardly a balance-altering situation.  I<br/>\nthink by the time they could get the mask, their faction with the<br/>\nIndigoBrothers (or whatever the Inkie faction is) would be so screwed that<br/>\nany faction benefits gained from taking Inkie form would be negated.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think there&#39;s also been a shift in attitude as regards fixing items that<br/>\nhave been in existence for some time, something which I believe our esteemed<br/>\nInternet Relations Manager has had quite a hand in.<br/>\n<br/>\nKyrisha</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
