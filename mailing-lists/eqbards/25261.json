Needless to<br/>\nsay - as players got to higher levels they would feel forced to leave their<br/>\nguilds or only do &quot;pickup raids&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nObviously - such an organization requires a calendar - which (along with the<br/>\nlink to the Ezboard forum) can be reached at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.xegonyalliance.com\">http://www.xegonyalliance.com</a><br/>\nto schedule the raids.  Some conflicts in scheduling had arisen earlier - so<br/>\nthe calendar was opened up to allow private raids to be shown.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis always been extremely controversial.  Many people would like to turn<br/>\nthe XA colander into a reservation system as exists on some servers - some<br/>\npeople seeing this as a panacea to solving every problem that has ever<br/>\noccurred on our server.  Others, citing problems on other servers, actual or<br/>\nhypothetical situations, liken a reservation system to communism (someone<br/>\nactually posted that on the backstage board).<br/>\n<br/>\nRegardless - many guilds and the XA Raids themselves of course - use the<br/>\ncalendar was what is described as an &quot;Intention system&quot; - i.e. - we &quot;Intend&quot;<br/>\nto raid at this time and this location with these people.  We can&#39;t force<br/>\nother guilds to respect it; but at the very least - when people who have<br/>\nsigned up appear in a guild raid that started 45 minutes earlier - they<br/>\ncertainly can&#39;t claim ignorance.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as Vox and Nag; given that Xegony is one of the original servers;<br/>\nonly a minority of players can fight those mobs - so most of the larger and<br/>\nmost powerful guilds don&#39;t even bother.  There are a couple of newer<br/>\nguilds - Circle of Valor I believe being one - that has being going after<br/>\nVox a lot (and with some difficulty).<br/>\n<br/>\nI did Nag 3 times and each one was successful.  I did Vox twice and failed<br/>\nboth times.  The first time because we sent too many people in - and had<br/>\nmajor LD problems every time the AOE spell went off.  The second time - we<br/>\ndidn&#39;t have enough stunners or mana drain - and she CH&#39;d herself when the<br/>\nhealth bar was at &quot;a&quot; in &quot;Lady Vox&quot;.  We then would have succeeded if he had<br/>\nproperly timed the respawns of the IG&#39;s but a couple spawned and killed off<br/>\nthe raid.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would think you won&#39;t have problems getting at Vox and Nag - you&#39;re<br/>\nbiggest problem will be finding enough people at the level range who are<br/>\nwilling to follow directions properly.  You&#39;ll probably get mostly new<br/>\nplayers who are inexperienced at raiding.<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde Katzenjammer<br/>\n56 Bard of Xegony<br/>\nDragons of Kel&#39;Dar</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
