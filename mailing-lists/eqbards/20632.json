The cleric reported that the health was indeed dropping faster on<br/>\nthe tump,  both us bards being a little too busy to really judge. We fought<br/>\nfor about an hour this way, and if one of us was doing no more than punching<br/>\ndamage (and allowing fewer knocks out of songs) that means that one of us<br/>\nwas superfluous, but I am certain a group of one bard and a cleric would not<br/>\ndo nearly as well.<br/>\nI understand this is not a very scientific study, at all, but it seemed<br/>\npretty convincing at the time. Has anyone actually methodically checked it?<br/>\nI am happy to be wrong, but I would be happier being wrong with a good<br/>\nexplanation for what happened :o)<br/>\n<br/>\nTsengu/Tszaaz<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
