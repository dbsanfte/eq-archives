Looks like they finally are getting around<br/>\nto it, but we still don&#39;t have a drum picture. Doesn&#39;t really matter to me<br/>\nas long as I&#39;m still running as fast as I was. It&#39;ll just take a little<br/>\ngetting used to.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for new graphics for armor, I doubt they&#39;ll provide different looking<br/>\narmor types except in the expansion. Verant&#39;s put in a lot of effort to<br/>\nminimize the different &quot;looks&quot; of armor out there and basically take the<br/>\narmor that is already in the game, and &quot;colorize&quot; it to represent different<br/>\ntypes. The banded armor for Half Elf is also used for &quot;blackened&quot; armor. The<br/>\n&quot;bronze&quot; armor is used for Mithril/Lambent/Plate (probably barnacle) and I<br/>\nbelieve Imbrued.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Windleaf</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
