Since the only people that<br/>\ncan use it that would want to  are bards, the cost should be cheap (if you can<br/>\nfind one)  It is only useable by Int casters and bards, and bards are the only<br/>\none of those 5 classes that would really want it.  I paid 25pp for 2 of them<br/>\n(not knowing they were Primary only :-(  )  I would suspect that they would go<br/>\nfor anywhere from 15pp to 30pp each.  the sad part is that they are usually<br/>\ndestroyed by the people that get them.  Here&#39;s the REAL spoiler....the Quill is<br/>\ndropped in Solusek A, off of a gnome named Gabbie (sp?).  Wisdom casters like<br/>\nto camp the crap out of Gabbie because her rare drop is the Molten Cloak (4AC,<br/>\n+4Wis, +4int)  The common drop off of her is the mithril quill.  I have heard<br/>\nit is a not-uncommon occurrence for someone to get 15 mithril quills before<br/>\ngetting the Molten Cloak.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe easiest way to get it would probably be to make friends with a high 20&#39;s<br/>\nWisdom or Int caster, just found out the cloak is all/all caster, and drop<br/>\nhints about the molten cloak : )  That would probably get you a Quill (or 2)<br/>\npretty darn quick.<br/>\n<br/>\nKaleid<br/>\n18th Song (Excellent in Brass, thanks to the Shady Swashbuckler room (THANKS<br/>\nSYLLY))<br/>\nPrexus <br/>\n===<br/>\n&quot;Thou shall not kill.
