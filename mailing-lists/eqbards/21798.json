Both Kitasi and I have<br/>\n&gt;been members of this mailing list since it was created.  Because I read this<br/>\n&gt;list as well as the Concert Hall board, I probably know more about the 50+<br/>\n&gt;bard songs than some of the 50+ bards on my server.

I notice that you two never address<br/>\nthe logical points in my post re: options available to bards at any level.  you simply<br/>\ncontinue the same old line of lullaby is broken, mez is broken, snare is broken<br/>\noh 90% of my options are gone.  i say that if that kills 90% of your options<br/>\nthen you aren&#39;t playing your bard to the fullest capabilities.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;worry about.  No need for you to get involved with any of the discussions on<br/>\n&gt;these issues.  For the other 99% of the bards out there who want full,<br/>\n&gt;working functionality out of the class, then there are still issues to<br/>\n&gt;discuss.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>your definition of full working functionality seems to differ with the game creator&#39;s<br/>\ndefinition of full working functionality.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Galtin of E&#39;ci </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
