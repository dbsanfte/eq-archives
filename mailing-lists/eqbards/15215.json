We come to a Kirukai (sp?) warrior and a<br/>\n&gt; Cleric of Innoruuk that are blocking our path.  Death time.  The two mobs<br/>\n&gt; both passed me close enough that I could smell their aftershave to chase my<br/>\n&gt; level 46 Ranger friend around.  Then they start wailing on the others in my<br/>\n&gt; group that are higher level than I am as I stand there watching.  Well after<br/>\n&gt; a few rounds of not being hit I decided maybe I shouldn&#39;t just stand there<br/>\n&gt; indefinitly waiting my turn for a dirtnap, so I darted out the door and up<br/>\n&gt; the zone wall and camped out to clear their agro lists.  Nothing ever agrod<br/>\n&gt; on me.  In fact by the time my camping process was at 15 seconds everyone<br/>\n&gt; else in my party was dead.  The mobs didn&#39;t come for me.  That&#39;s pretty<br/>\n&gt; unusual, but isn&#39;t conclusive.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This only seems unusual to us bards.  :)  While playing around<br/>\nwith sneak in various zones with no songs playing, I found out<br/>\nthis is how the game works for everyone *except* us.  If a mob<br/>\nis aggroed on someone, you can be inside its aggro radius and<br/>\nit won&#39;t aggro on you (unless you&#39;re close enough that it<br/>\ndecides to attack you instead).  I&#39;ve had giants, frogloks,<br/>\nkobolds, and various bugs all run through me and never aggro<br/>\non me (should /con threatening while in sneak mode and behind<br/>\nthem).<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately, the way it works for bards is that if you&#39;re in<br/>\nthe aggro radius and your song pulses, that almost always adds<br/>\nyou to the hate list.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
