When you search you get a bazillion hit of bits<br/>\nand pieces and have to dig thru that to find the meat you want.  I would<br/>\nhate to see your quality reference get that same treatment.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I would say - keep things where they are. Working for free for your self<br/>\nis one thing but to work for free for someone else (Everlore who wont host<br/>\nyour banners but get paid for their own) is something else entirely.
