Now, if<br/>\nthe 1H-slash, music, offense, defense, or dual were capped, I would<br/>\nbe more worried.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve noticed that Offense and Defense seem to be capped at 5xLevel<br/>\nfor both my Monk and my Bard, as opposed to the usual 5+5xLevel for<br/>\nthe basic combat skills.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only other skill I regularly pump up is Fishing, and I regularly<br/>\ntrain it up to 5+5xLevel. It might go higher, but generally that seems<br/>\nto match the amount of fishing I do per level, so I can&#39;t say whether<br/>\nthat is the cap or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had the fortune of being sold a Mino Axe at Level 6 -- it cost me<br/>\njust about everything I had in the bank, including the money I was<br/>\nsaving for the Level 6 song -- and I really like the jump in damage;<br/>\nI&#39;m Level 7 now, having fun with Goblins and beginning to get a feel<br/>\nfor what songs are useful in group situations. So far, it&#39;s Accelerando<br/>\nwhen travelling (or panicing ;), and a combination of Jonathan&#39;s and<br/>\nRestoration while fighting.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there a quick way to put away a weapon and pull out a drum, for those<br/>\nrun-away-quick-in-a-panic situations?<br/>\n<br/>\n/s Cantor, L7 Bard, Rivervale/Freeport, Rodcet Nife</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
