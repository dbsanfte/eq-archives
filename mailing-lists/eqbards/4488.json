I was hoping the changes they made to those two skills in<br/>\nrespect to rogues would also apply to us.  If you weren&#39;t aware, when a<br/>\nrogue successfully hides, he now gets a message he was successful.  Once<br/>\na rogue is hidden, if he Sneaks successfully he can move silently and<br/>\ninvisible.  Very handy for their backstabs.  I don&#39;t see how adding this<br/>\nfeature to bards would unbalance us at all.  As it stands right now I<br/>\ndoubt many of us even use these skills.  However, when it comes to a<br/>\ndecision on which 8 songs to memorize, if we had this ability to<br/>\nHide/Sneak then that would be a factor in memorizing a different song<br/>\ninstead of the Invisibility song.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
