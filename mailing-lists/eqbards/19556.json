I fought the giants last night and their agro radius<br/>\nwas unchanged.  However, there is a known bug with charm that causes you to<br/>\nget on the hate list of every giant in chase range.  I have yet to encounter<br/>\nthe bug with my charm, but every time our enchanter charms one the bug<br/>\noccurs.  It basically turns the agro radius of all those giants into their<br/>\nchase range and you get faction hits for every giant anyone kills in the<br/>\narea.  bleh!  We had a GM take copious notes and report it.  As soon as my<br/>\nsong pulsed on the affected enchanter I was added to all those hate lists as<br/>\nwell.  My charm worked normally but maybe if their had been another bard it<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t have.  I could charm one gate spawn giant and he would come right<br/>\nover to me.  If I sent him against the other gate spawn giant I did not get<br/>\nadded to any other giants hate lists like the enchanter did.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Big Daddy Legba [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:legba@...\">legba@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, June 09, 2000 8:03 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Treasure changes in Frontier Mountains<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only change I noticed in Frontier Mts, fighting Mountain giants was<br/>\ntheir new agro radius.
