To<br/>\nbe on the safe side, yesterday I downloaded the most recent drivers from the<br/>\nCreative website and installed them.  I was shocked when I logged in.  Prior<br/>\nto installing the updated drivers, the sound in EQ was pretty good.  After<br/>\ninstalling the new drivers, it got even better.  The Environmental Audio<br/>\nsupport improved dramatically.  I started hearing sound effects that I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t even know were in the game.  The most recent SBLive driver is from<br/>\nNov 99 so if you don&#39;t have it download it and give it a try.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I&#39;m living there until I can play EQ again for more then 30 minutes<br/>\n&gt; without my SB Live crashing me out. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
