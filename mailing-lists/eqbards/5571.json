As you run the trees come into view a bit at a time for instance,<br/>\nsometimes having the branches hovering in midair without the trunk.  The trunk<br/>\nis beyond your clip plane, but the branches are not.  If you can adjust this,<br/>\nthen it probably means that you can adjust how far away the clip plane is<br/>\nbased upon your computer&#39;s performance.  The clip plane on my PII-400 could<br/>\nprobably go farther out without serious performance issues, while some of my<br/>\nfriends with P-266s might want to move it in a bit to speed things up.  The<br/>\nlarger the radius of the clip plane, the slower things will be for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that&#39;s merely my *guess* based upon your saying that a clip plane option<br/>\nhas been added.  I&#39;ll certainly look at it tonight.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 2.

I broke a level last night and several skills were going<br/>\nup and I didn&#39;t see any difference in the messages being printed.  &quot;You have<br/>\nbecome better at percussion and now pass other players even more quickly using<br/>\nSelo&#39;s Accelerando (84).&quot;  I expected (84/200) or something.  So I switched to<br/>\nthe Skills screen hoping that instead of &quot;Feeble&quot; my fishing would be shown as<br/>\n&quot;Feeble 12/200&quot;, but nope...
