What are the general directions to get<br/>\n&gt; to Kelethin?  I know the boat to Butcherblock part but from there on I am<br/>\n&gt; lost.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s fairly easy and fairly safe.<br/>\n<br/>\n From the Butcherblock docks go out the gate and follow the road, which leads<br/>\nto Kaladim.  Continue in front of Kaladim toward some buildings and pick up the<br/>\nroad to the south.  It goes past various guard huts and comes to a hut where<br/>\nyou must go left or right.  Go left.<br/>\n<br/>\nWatch out for the ogres who appear occasionally.  Follow the road which<br/>\neventually goes between two huts.  Stay on it to a deep, green pass into the<br/>\nmountain.  That&#39;s the way to Greater Faydark.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you come out of the pass, get on the road and follow it all the way to<br/>\nKelethin.  Don&#39;t turn off it on a side path.  The only place that looks like a<br/>\nfork you&#39;ll go left and you&#39;ll see Felwithe to the right.  Part way along<br/>\nyou&#39;ll go through the midst of four tall standing stones, carved with runes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll leave you to explore Kelethin an find the guild yourself.  It&#39;s not a hard<br/>\none to find.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; 2) Also as a lvl 8 bard, what should I hunt to get the most loot?  I have<br/>\n&gt; been grouping in E. Commons but it is getting rather crowded and there are<br/>\n&gt; very few &quot;good loot&quot; monsters besides Darkweeds and Centurions, neither of<br/>\n&gt; which I like to take alone.  You see, I spent the vast majority of my cash on<br/>\n&gt; leather armor (cap, tunic, leggings, shoulderpads, and neck armor).  I know<br/>\n&gt; it will cost me to get the lvl 8 song and I&#39;d like to get the lvl 9 song<br/>\n&gt; while I&#39;m there.  How much cash should I take?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Orc centurions are common north of Kelethin and often have good loot.  They&#39;re<br/>\nfrom Crushbone.  They may be a bit tough for you solo at 8th, so be careful.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t remember the cost of the level 8 and 9 songs, but I believe they were<br/>\naround 4 platinum each.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; 3) How dangerous is the passage to Kelethin?  I&#39;d like to not die on another<br/>\n&gt; continent if at all possible.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sing Selo&#39;s wondrous melody, play your drum, and run like the wind.  You&#39;ll be<br/>\nfine.  Stick to the road as I said.  The guards at the bottom of the lifts into<br/>\nthe tree city are most helpful if you&#39;re followed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; P.S.  Maybe a rumor, but does killing Bixies really cause Griffins to spawn. <br/>\n&gt; There were three in E. Commons today.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Now I have a question.  What exactly are bixies?  They&#39;re so small I didn&#39;t<br/>\nfeel quite right picking on them.<br/>\n<br/>\n        Thrush of Veeshan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
