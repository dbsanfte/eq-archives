These are<br/>\nsome of the Bard&#39;s major complaints that you and he have addressed here.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me summarize -<br/>\n<br/>\nQ) There was recently a change made to the level 23 bard song - Selo&#39;s<br/>\nConsanent Chain.  This song now will not effect MOBs that are SoW&#39;d.<br/>\nA) That was an unintentional bug from fixing something else - it has hopefully<br/>\nbeen fixed with this patch.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ) Why when I&#39;m playing my drum does it look like I&#39;m strumming a stick?<br/>\nA) We lost an animation somewhere - hopefully it will be fixed when we do our<br/>\nart patch.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ) Bard skills that are capped at 40 (forage, sneak, hide).  This limit is so<br/>\nlow that the skill is useless.<br/>\nA) I&#39;ll check on that.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ) How about letting us know when our missing songs will be implemented?<br/>\nA) There are very few that are not in - and they are waiting for something...<br/>\n:)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCrier Sharpsong - 20th song (CHING!
