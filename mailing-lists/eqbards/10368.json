I was grouped with a level 19 Wizard and we were just<br/>\nNorth<br/>\n&gt; of the W.Karana zone on the path.  I was using Selo&#39;s, Bellow and CoD when<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; ran too close to a house &quot;LOADING PLEASE WAIT&quot;  I do know that griffawns<br/>\n&gt; have double attack and I don&#39;t think solo kiting is really even possible<br/>\n&gt; till we get Chains.  It&#39;s been very painful everytime I&#39;ve gotten mixed up<br/>\n&gt; with a griff, although I&#39;ve never died thanks to Selo&#39;s.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m curious about other bards success kiting with level 20 and under<br/>\nsongs.<br/>\n&gt; How do you balance running out of range for such a long kite if your only<br/>\n&gt; bellowing?  And if your using CoD or DDD how much success do you have<br/>\n&gt; keeping from attracting other mobs and instakill NPC&#39;s?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; For that matter how useful is Largo&#39;s Melodic Binding and does anyone<br/>\n&gt; actually use it?  Having just gotten level 20 I&#39;ve started using Anthem,<br/>\n&gt; Hymn, Largo&#39;s, Bellow or Denons.  I mainly group because soloing pre-20 in<br/>\n&gt; S.Karana gave me a lot of exercise in running to the zone :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lakosh  ?  &lt;Divine Harmony&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Fresh level 20 Bard of Tunare<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; P.S.

The weird part is that at 24th level I started doing 13<br/>\nhp<br/>\n&gt; &gt; per<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;pulse and 11 sitting down (the difference used to be just one between<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;sitting and standing) so I that seems to blow the formula but that&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; one<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I always heard.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I often sing it while smacking away in combat.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; You are confused a bit mixing in the natural regen rate here.  At 12<br/>\nyou<br/>\n&gt; &gt; get<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 8 pts per pulse with lute while sitting total.  That&#39;s 6 from Hymn<br/>\nplus<br/>\n&gt; 2<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; natural.  At 18th you get 10 per pulse sitting total, again 8 from<br/>\nHymn<br/>\n&gt; &gt; plus<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2 natural.  Your sitting regen rates increases past 2 after 20th<br/>\nlevel,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sure exactly when but I know it goes up to 3 natural regen somewhere<br/>\n&gt; soon<br/>\n&gt; &gt; on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; or after 20th.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Using my formula for lute of (1hp + 1hp/6lvls)*2 means at 12 hymn<br/>\nshould<br/>\n&gt; &gt; do<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 6, it does; at 18th it should do 8, again it does.  It does half that<br/>\n&gt; much<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; without lute so you get at 12th level Hymn for 3, plus 1 natural so 4.<br/>\n&gt; At<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 18 it would be 4 plus 1 natural so 5.  These both fit the actual<br/>\nresult<br/>\n&gt; so<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the equation is correct.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;More simply put, Hymn starts at 6 per pulse at 6th level (but you&#39;d<br/>\nget<br/>\n&gt; &gt; two<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;from just sitting without the song) and it improves 2 hp per pulse<br/>\n&gt; every<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; six<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;levels after.  This is not dependent on string skill level because I<br/>\n&gt; hear<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;keeps going up even after we&#39;ve maxed string.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Same as you get with my equation, Hymn does 4pt at 6th, plus the 2 for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sitting = 6.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kitasi of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt; with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
