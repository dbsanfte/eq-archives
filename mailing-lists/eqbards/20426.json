This<br/>\nmakes it very useful for pulling singles from a group of mob. Lament the<br/>\nextra mobs and pull the one you want.<br/>\n<br/>\nLucid Lullaby is an area effect Mesmerization spell. In theory it will mez<br/>\nall the mobs that are around the singer. In practice, it mezes about 1/3<br/>\nmeanwhile, the other 2/3 immediately turn on the bard and beat the bard to a<br/>\nbloody pulp.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn personal exp I used lullaby up till my mid to late 20s. I never expected<br/>\nit to stop all the mobs. I used it to stop some of the mobs and make the job<br/>\neasier on our healer. We had no enchanter, so I was it for crowd control.<br/>\nI&#39;m sure it earned me some additional deaths over the time I used it, but<br/>\nI&#39;m equally sure it saved me in some fights.<br/>\n<br/>\nDrae<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Sunski [mailto:sunski@...]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, July 11, 2000 5:33 PM<br/>\nTo: eqbards@egroups.com<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Kelin the dubiously talented song writer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJust who was this Kelin anyway?  Some sort of sado-masochist?<br/>\n<br/>\nHello, I&#39;ve been a lurker for a little while.  Now I&#39;m having a bit of a<br/>\nproblem figuring out what to do<br/>\nwith Kelin&#39;s Lucid Lullaby.  I know there&#39;s been a lot of discussion on the<br/>\nlist about this song, but<br/>\nusually in relation to levels far above mine.  I&#39;ve been meaning to write<br/>\nthis since I got the darn song,<br/>\nbecause I just can&#39;t figure out how to use it.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, my experience with Kelin&#39;s Lugubrious Lament.  When I first got that<br/>\nsong it didn&#39;t work for me at<br/>\nall.  Always resisted.  Consistently got mobbed.  But as I&#39;ve leveled, it&#39;s<br/>\nbecome more useful.  I really<br/>\nonly try to use it on blues and I&#39;m having a very good success rate (knock<br/>\non wood).<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I get Lullaby and it&#39;s even worse than Lament was when I first got it<br/>\nbecause I can&#39;t see when it<br/>\n&quot;hits&quot; them -- I&#39;m just all of a sudden surrounded.  I pick a small group of<br/>\nblues.  Run up and turn on<br/>\nLullaby.  Nothing.  No &quot;resist&quot; message.  No &quot;sleepy/whatever&quot; message.<br/>\nThen they&#39;re all wailing away on<br/>\nme.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan someone tell me if I&#39;m doing something wrong or if this song just really<br/>\nsucks that bad?  Should I<br/>\nwait a couple (more) levels to start trying to use it?  But then I thought I<br/>\nrecalled from previous<br/>\ndiscussion that it&#39;s completely useless after level 24? or 27?  So why<br/>\nbother for just a few levels of<br/>\nuse?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for any advice.<br/>\nLyressa - level 17<br/>\nNameless<br/>\n<br/>\np.s.  If I ever run into that Kelin I&#39;m going to have to give him a piece of<br/>\nmy mind.  Or maybe my foot --<br/>\nsoundly on the butt.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nGet a NextCard Visa, in 30 seconds!<br/>\n1.
