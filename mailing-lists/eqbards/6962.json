My experience with the trade window is that it&#39;s a good way to lose<br/>\nitems. It has several bugs still that will on rare occasions lose the<br/>\nitem you are showing your friend when one of you cancel&#39;s the<br/>\ntransaction. This has happened to enough people I know that no one asks<br/>\nto see things in the trade window anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd before someone jumps in claiming it&#39;s a rumor I have actually seen<br/>\nit happen. While in Unrest a friend wanted to show me the first earring<br/>\nhe&#39;d made with jewellry craft. He put it in the trade window, I looked<br/>\nat it, then hit cancel. He could not find it in his inventory anywhere.<br/>\nHe was lucky enough to get a GM who was giving someone a last name to<br/>\nlook for it for him, and somehow the GM managed to locate it, even<br/>\nthough it was invisible to anyone else in the area. (and no, his<br/>\ninventory was not full when this happened)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
