As it stands<br/>\n&gt;right now, it mainly improves STR and STA and decreases INT, DEX and AGI.<br/>\n&gt;The decrease in DEX already has a negative impact on a bards ability to play<br/>\n&gt;an instrument.  However, IMO it would be nice if your CHR went up while you<br/>\n&gt;were drunk or duration of songs was increased.  It would definately add a<br/>\n&gt;twist to roleplaying a bard.  Just a thought...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, while I think that there should be some kind of benefit to being<br/>\ndrunk with a high Alcohol Tolerance, I&#39;m not sure that a CHR boost is the<br/>\nanswer. Hehe. I mean, do you know ANYONE who&#39;s more attractive when they&#39;re<br/>\ndrunk? <br/>\n<br/>\nThe STR and STA is a beneficial increase, especially for we bard weaklings.<br/>\nIf you could get a greater increase by drinking more (and a high tolerance<br/>\nthat prevented the swaying and DEX and AGI decrease) then I think every<br/>\nbard would have a good reason for being a heavy drinker!<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, I hear heavy drinking causes liver damage....*chuckles*<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------------------------------------------<br/>\nJythri, Pencerdd of The Soerbaird<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.soerbaird.com\">http://www.soerbaird.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
