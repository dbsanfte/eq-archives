It was actually a very interesting post.  In a <br/>\n&gt; nutshell, the poster<br/>\n&gt; claimed that because CH, when cast on warrior, is the most <br/>\n&gt; powerful spell in<br/>\n&gt; the game, Verant had to balance the game accordingly to <br/>\n&gt; compensate.  In<br/>\n&gt; other words, Verant assumes that most, if not all groups, <br/>\n&gt; will have at least<br/>\n&gt; one warrior and cleric in them, especially when fighting the <br/>\n&gt; tougher mobs in<br/>\n&gt; the game.  In order to make sure the game was still challenging, the<br/>\n&gt; difficulty of the game, i.e. mob toughness, had to be increased to<br/>\n&gt; compensate for the warrior/cleric combo. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
