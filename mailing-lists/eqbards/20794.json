The Voodoo3 was fine except some spell effects would lag me down, <br/>\nmost notably the AOE rain type spells.  So I upgraded.  The visual quality <br/>\non the GeForce2 isn&#39;t quite as good; the ground ahead gets kind of grainy <br/>\nand/or swimmy and in general things in the distance don&#39;t look as good, but <br/>\nI don&#39;t get graphical lag at all any more.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also sometimes get Fatal Error 0E in VXD VMM sometimes leaving EQ or when <br/>\nI get bonked to the server selection screen when zoning.  My MB BIOS is <br/>\ncurrent (the BIOS date was only a week old when I got the new MB last month) <br/>\nbut it is a VIA KX133 Asus MB.  I have been trying various options of <br/>\nsettings and everything but was wondering if anyone else had similar <br/>\nproblems that they fixed or any other visual quality tweeks.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m going to try to get my guild to raid Kaesora soon; it&#39;s the only coin I <br/>\nneed yet for the Nostrolo Tambourine.  If only somone would produce a map of <br/>\nthat zone that&#39;s not so confusing and looks better.. hehe<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and I recently (ok, a couple of weeks ago) got my hand on Soinachie&#39;s <br/>\nPartisan during a guild attempt to get our wizzies the Brain Bite spell in <br/>\nKarnors.  What a sweet weapon!  And it looks unique, unlike so many other <br/>\nbard-only weapons...   Yeah, I like to swing weapons a lot just because I&#39;m <br/>\ntoo lazy to keep switching instruments.  =8^)  Most of the time I&#39;m my <br/>\nregular group&#39;s closest thing to a tank...  Plus I have to hit arena and <br/>\npractice my brass skills again... hehe<br/>\n<br/>\nOK, enough babbling (you know how we bards can get)...<br/>\n<br/>\nOlgwinn Pendragun<br/>\nBard of 40 Missed Notes<br/>\nE&#39;Ci<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
