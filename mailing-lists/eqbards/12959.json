There&#39;s also<br/>\n&gt;a chance they won&#39;t &quot;see&quot; you if you run by really quickly<br/>\n&gt;(which is what I did by accident my first time, and what got<br/>\n&gt;me killed my second time when I tried it again :).  See<br/>\n&gt;Kitasi&#39;s posts on how aggro checks might be pulsed instead of<br/>\n&gt;continuous.  (I also have a theory on this, but I&#39;m not going<br/>\n&gt;to post it since it may be abusable - need to test it and send<br/>\n&gt;it to Verant.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;John H.
