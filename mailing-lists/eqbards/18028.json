During fights I switch to overhead.  I only use<br/>\nthe butt shot view for swimming (try it sometime if your like me and have<br/>\ntrouble climbing back up on shore).  The other two views look behind me to<br/>\nthe right and left.  I use these when running to see if I&#39;m being chased.<br/>\n<br/>\nI prefer to target with the keyboard, but that doesn&#39;t always work so I am<br/>\nforced to use the mouse a lot.  Otherwise I only use the mouse for moving<br/>\nitems.  Songs, my movement, opening doors, etc is all keyboard.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace<br/>\nEvulia, bard of 10 verses, Tunare<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Ken Bachman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbachman@...\">kbachman@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, April 20, 2000 4:55 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqbards] How do you play this game?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve been playing computer games since Pong (yeah, I&#39;m that old).  My <br/>\n&gt; coordination and reflexes were never that hot (which is why I <br/>\n&gt; sucked at <br/>\n&gt; sports), and they seem to get worse with age.  Plus, I&#39;ve <br/>\n&gt; usually played <br/>\n&gt; turn-based strategy games.  And, in agreement with the &quot;can&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; teach an <br/>\n&gt; old dog new tricks&quot; axiom, I&#39;ve been playing this game in the default <br/>\n&gt; first-person mode, using the keyboard for everything but <br/>\n&gt; targetting MOBs. <br/>\n&gt; (It took me until level 40 to switch from using the mouse for song <br/>\n&gt; activation to setting up hot keys, which shows you how stuck in old <br/>\n&gt; habits I can get.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m wondering how the rest of you play.  Do you use the other <br/>\n&gt; views, and <br/>\n&gt; if so, for what purposes?  I&#39;ve been playing with the mid-range <br/>\n&gt; third-person view for soloing for about a month, but I&#39;m <br/>\n&gt; having a lot of <br/>\n&gt; trouble using it in group situations.  Does this just take practice?  <br/>\n&gt; Does anyone use the &quot;behind the back&quot; view for any reason other than <br/>\n&gt; aesthetics?  My avatar constantly gets in the way on that one.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also, do you use your mouse for movement?  Do you actually <br/>\n&gt; feel that you <br/>\n&gt; have better control than with the keyboard, or is this the <br/>\n&gt; inverse of my <br/>\n&gt; situation (e.g., you always used the mouse, so the keyboard seems <br/>\n&gt; awkward)?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kenross Cantoforjado, 47 songs, Innoruuk<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; Enjoy the award-winning journalism of The New York Times with <br/>\n&gt; convenient home delivery.
