I wish I had something to put in<br/>\nthe SPDAT so you gyuys could look at it, but right now I don&#39;t. Sorry.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nActually, that&#39;s VERY close to what he said in regards t new bard<br/>\nsongs/disciplines. He&#39;s a super nice guy. Bit soft spoken though.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdditionally, I spoke with him about the problems with Selos and Drums of<br/>\nthe Beast. Oddly enough, he was unaware of the wrap-around problem with our<br/>\nspeed and wrote it down.<br/>\n<br/>\nOverall, great guy. He took alot of notes too.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
