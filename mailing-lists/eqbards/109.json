Or rather I would not had I even known about the Soerbard\r<br/>\nbefore I made level 9 (laugh).  My &quot;problem&quot; &quot;issue&quot; what have you.\r<br/>\nand I want to stress that this isn&#39;t disparaging of them at all is\r<br/>\nwhat servers are they on?  The Academy page states that there should\r<br/>\nbe a patron. How can one have a patron if there are no others on \r<br/>\ntheir server?  My second problem comes from the agnostic &quot;requirement&quot;\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nMy Bard  Adon is a devout believer and follower of Veeshan believing\r<br/>\nfully that it is by her will his voice holds power.  However being\r<br/>\nthat he follows the Dragon Goddess he has no preference among the\r<br/>\nplayer races, classes, or alignments.  As happy to travel with Troll\r<br/>\nexcepting for the smell, as with High-elven Paladin.  I think the\r<br/>\nSoerbard should possibly consider that new potential members may have\r<br/>\ndeveloped chars already, and that benefits for higherlevel joiners should\r<br/>\nalso be considered, after all 10 plat is a hefty sum even as a test of loyalty\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThese are just my thoughts and by no means to be considered as ill will\r<br/>\nto the Soerbard who I find a most admirable bard guild at least in intent\r<br/>\nif not function (since I&#39;ve never seen any of you on povar my home)\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAdon of Freeport Devout singer of Veeshan in the Povar aspect</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
