Stopping hitting them does absolutly zip when you are<br/>\nsinging a debuff like chains or dennons or god forbid you have lulled them.<br/>\nThey will hit you, there is no point in not hitting back.<br/>\nI am in the near perfect group as I have said before. Warrior (3 levels<br/>\nhigher), Cleric, Wizard and me the bard.  The cleric keeps me healed, the<br/>\nwarrior taunts them off me. But saying I shouldn&#39;t be in there wacking is<br/>\ninane. I can do real damage and so I should be. Tell them to give it up. If<br/>\nthey can&#39;t keep you alive it is THEIR shortcoming not yours. My group would<br/>\nreally feel it was their fault if I died. THen again, they are good enough<br/>\nthat I haven&#39;t died once while hunting with them. *smiles*<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;and then there is the famous....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&quot;SYLLY WEP!!!&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;which was preceeded by...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&quot;you try to punch a aviak harrier but miss...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>hahahaha, I have pulled on more than one occasion with the lute *laughs* I<br/>\nsing lull while I have it then switch in the pause :o)<br/>\n<br/>\nTszaaz E&#39;Taurguin</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
