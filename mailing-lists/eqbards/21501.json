I do know there was some<br/>\nsort of change, however, as Crag Spiders (ugh, more silks...) now run<br/>\nwhen at low health where they did not this weekend.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will look at &quot;the wobble&quot; tonight to see if it might actually become<br/>\n&quot;the jog&quot; that was intended.  I -really- like the new tambourine<br/>\ngraphic.  They did a very good job even if I am still strumming it.  My<br/>\nonly concern is that it will be almost totally covered in a human hand,<br/>\nit&#39;s very small on a wood elf as it is.  Anybody seen a human with one<br/>\nyet?  I haven&#39;t seen anybody besides myself with one on E&#39;ci but not<br/>\nmany higher level bards spend time in EK.  *smirk*<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- John Tatsukawa &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:john@...\">john@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; /cheer I noticed this as well.

It<br/>\n&gt; seems to <br/>\n&gt; me that it has smoothed out, but since I was bumping up and down in<br/>\n&gt; the <br/>\n&gt; swamp, I couldn&#39;t be certain.
