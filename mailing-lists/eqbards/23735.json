They are all the<br/>\nsame.  The difference in speed you &#39;feel&#39; is because you are farther from<br/>\nthe land textures, giving the illusion of slower movmement.  This is why a<br/>\ngnome feels like it is running faster then an Ogre as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Reece Tom R CPT 25 ID L G4 [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, February 05, 2001 4:35 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: EQBards<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqbards] Selos Song of Travel<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Just dinged 51 last night and used this song for the first <br/>\n&gt; time.  With Selos<br/>\n&gt; Drum equipped, the movement rate with the 51 song seemed to <br/>\n&gt; be slower than<br/>\n&gt; Selos Accelerando.  I was in Burning Woods so that may have <br/>\n&gt; had an impact on<br/>\n&gt; my perception.  Is the speed bonus for these songs the same or is<br/>\n&gt; Accelerando indeed faster?  I have read that when you have a regular<br/>\n&gt; levitate buff up and sing Selos, the fastest you will go is <br/>\n&gt; SOW speed.  This<br/>\n&gt; is approximately how fast I was going last night with SSoT.  <br/>\n&gt; So either SSoT<br/>\n&gt; is slower because of the levitate effect or my perception was off.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
