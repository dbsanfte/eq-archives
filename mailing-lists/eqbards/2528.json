I try to use the terms &quot;monster&quot; or<br/>\n&quot;merchant&quot; in the game instead of &quot;mobs.&quot;  My ideal for a<br/>\nMMORPG (massively multiplayer online roleplaying game :-) is<br/>\none where the server does not know the difference between PCs<br/>\nand mobs - i.e. monsters use the same rules as the PCs.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately, none of the MMORPGs I&#39;ve seen (and almost none<br/>\nof the CRPGS) do this.  It is just much easier for designers<br/>\nto tweak the game for balance if you can adjust monsters<br/>\nwithout adjusting players in the process, and vice versa.  So<br/>\nwhile the terminology may be disturbing to your suspension of<br/>\ndisbelief, the entire game engine is built upon the PC and mob<br/>\ndichotomy.  Sometimes you just have to use terms like &quot;mob&quot; to<br/>\naccurately describe the things that go on in the fantasy<br/>\nworld.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
