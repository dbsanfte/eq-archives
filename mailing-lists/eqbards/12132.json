It beats anything else out there hands down, including<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   giant charming.  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Third,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;   I and others have made posts about Djarn (Efreeti Lord Djarn)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   on this list about 2 or 3 weeks ago I&#39;d say.  And I made the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   very specific comment that he is deep, deep, deep inside SolB.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Deep enough and well guarded enough that it takes a minimum of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   two high level groups to reach him.  This should at least clue<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   those few people who actually read these emails &gt;8)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;   As far as measuring distance in terms a L1 bard can understand<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s that important to do, however I don&#39;t use<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   tracking in outdoor zones unless I&#39;m after a random, roaming,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   or rare spawn.  Even if I could try to explain how close I <br/>\n&gt; &gt;   need to be to track Krak Windchaser (now I&#39;ll have L10 bards<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   hollering at me, because they don&#39;t know that NPC - gimme<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   a break heh) it would be in terms of hills and trees and <br/>\n&gt; &gt;   topography.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;   So how far is bard tracking in simple terms?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;   I can find any named mob in most dungeons (SolA, Perma,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Crushbone, etc).  This is sufficient enough to make tracking<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   useful, although druids at 20 skill can see very similar things<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   that I can see.  They just dont get a wee bit of extra range.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Where the ranger gets a wee bit longer range than us.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Verant didn&#39;t really think through the tracking and how the <br/>\n&gt; &gt;   skill affects radius.  Because I&#39;ve looked at my tracking and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   a druid&#39;s tracking at the same time (2 computers, 2 accounts)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   and they look the same.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;   I guess my point is not how Tracking works, which is what you <br/>\n&gt; &gt;   lower level people want to know... it&#39;s how far in comparison<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   it is working.  And the answer is there isn&#39;t a big difference.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Plus........... it&#39;s my birthday in 2 days, so I get to be right<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   for once here, and you all can be the ignorant ones =)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Harmonic.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
