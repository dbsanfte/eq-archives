Have you now changed your mind on this? If the<br/>\n&gt; check happens when the secondary weapon delay expires then that<br/>\n&gt; contradicts the first sentance I quoted above.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Arrrgh.  It&#39;s *not* a contradiction - that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying<br/>\nexplain.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the sake of argument, say the listed dam/delay ratio is<br/>\nwhat you actually get.  Say you&#39;re comparing a 6 damage 20<br/>\ndelay weapon with a 12 damage 40 delay weapon (both with a 0.3<br/>\nratio).  Say the average damage is half the max damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth weapons in the primary hand:<br/>\n<br/>\n6/20 weapon swings 50 times.  Avg total damage = (6/2)*50 =<br/>\n150.<br/>\n<br/>\n12/40 weapon swings 25 times.  Avg total damage = (12/2)*25 =<br/>\n150.<br/>\n<br/>\nSay dual wield succeeds 40% of the time.  Both weapons in<br/>\nsecondary hand:<br/>\n<br/>\n6/20 weapon swings 50*0.4 = 20 times.  Avg total damage =<br/>\n(6/2)*20 = 60.<br/>\n<br/>\n12/40 weapon swings 25*0.4 = 10 times.  Avg total damage =<br/>\n(12/2)*10 = 60.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the fast weapon gets 20 dual wield skill checks vs 10 for<br/>\nthe slower, which makes it great if you&#39;re trying to raise DW.  <br/>\nBut in terms of average damage, there is still no difference.  <br/>\nIf weapon A is better than weapon B in your primary hand, it<br/>\nis better in your secondary.  If the two are equal in your<br/>\nprimary, they will still be equal in your secondary.  The<br/>\ngreater number of dual wield checks with a faster weapon is<br/>\nexactly canceled out by the greater damage of the slower<br/>\nweapon (assuming comparable weapons).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe disagreement between JM and me was because of me using the<br/>\nterm &quot;avg dam/delay.&quot;  By putting the &quot;avg&quot; in there, I meant<br/>\nthe real average damage the weapon generated - what you&#39;d get<br/>\nfrom running a parser on your log file (which didn&#39;t exist<br/>\nthen).  He read the &quot;dam/delay&quot; part and thought I meant the<br/>\ndamage and delay stats listed in the weapon description.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And, with the typical fight, putting a 10 delay weapon in either hand<br/>\n&gt; with a bard at high levels, assuming an under one minute fight, would<br/>\n&gt; probably yeild something like this, assuming all 6 dual weild checks<br/>\n&gt; succeeded (ya right)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; At least that&#39;s how most of my fights looked. Given the clumpiness of<br/>\n&gt; the random rolls I&#39;d rather have a lot more chances for hits.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, a slower weapon generates clumpier data (though the<br/>\naverage remains the same).  But we weren&#39;t comparing a slow<br/>\nweapon vs. a fast weapon.  What we were looking at is given<br/>\nyou will be using two weapons - A in primary B in secondary,<br/>\nor B in primary A in secondary - does speed of the weapon<br/>\nmatter?  It doesn&#39;t.  The better weapon should go in your<br/>\nprimary.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H. Kim<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
