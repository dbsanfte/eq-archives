Also, it appears that you cha, class and faction play<br/>\na big part of getting the quest as well as the reward (unless reward is<br/>\nmerely randomized.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSome quests once you know what they are, you can do along the way while you<br/>\nkill for xp.  You just stop by the bards and grab some mail to deliver to<br/>\nthe place you are probably going anyway.  Hint: write down the name of who<br/>\ngets the mail - two hours later and many dead monsters, you prolly forgot<br/>\nwho gets the mail and if you give to the wrong one - oh well no xp for that<br/>\nquest.  Warning: it is dangerous to do quests & trade skills at the same<br/>\ntime.  A certain package of mail destined for Freeport got brewed in the<br/>\nbrew barrel &lt;g&gt; (thankful it was not my full backpack!).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if anyone knows how to do the bandit&#39;s tongues quest (named Butcherblock<br/>\nbandits I think) please let me know.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\nBard of the 13th level<br/>\na.k.a.
