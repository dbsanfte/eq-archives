I tend to put everything<br/>\nin charisma and stamina when I create a Bard.  Stamina adds a good number of<br/>\nhp per level and helps a ton in the long run.  And there really aren&#39;t very<br/>\nmany *useful* +STA items in the game.  There are a few but there are other<br/>\nitems with better AC/resists/dam whatever that you will much prefer to wear.<br/>\nStrength seems, by far, to be the easiest stat to raise with items (asside<br/>\nfrom, possibly, agility).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the stats you chose are fine.  No need to re-roll and items can easily<br/>\nget you up into the 130-150 range.  Our armor is +1cha per peice and there<br/>\nare a couple other very nice items we can get that boost charisma just fine.<br/>\nWhen I want to go nuts on Charisma (and like Sylly I have not noticed any<br/>\nsignificant difference in performance from a 120 charisma or a 180 charisma)<br/>\nI just throw on a bunch of charisma gear (there is a LOT of it out there).<br/>\n<br/>\nEnjoy your Bard ;)  And character creation is a personal choice.  Those<br/>\nstarting points are best used to get as many (if not all) of your stats<br/>\nabove 75 and as many (as possible) of your primary stats up near 100 if you<br/>\nhave points left over.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy above 75?  75 seems to be the &quot;magic&quot; number where things start to get<br/>\n&#39;normal&#39;.  Below 75 you take some rather nasty penalties on skills that rely<br/>\non stats.  Above or at 75 things seem normal.  100 because that seems to be<br/>\nthe point of diminishing returns for our stats.  Up till 100 stat increases<br/>\ndo a lot for us, after 100 (asside from Cha for bards and possibly STR)<br/>\nstats are really pointless.<br/>\n<br/>\nLyrnia<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Greetings and Welcome!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Always great to see another bard and especially one on Innoruuk (my server<br/>\n&gt; too!) I cant imagine who thinks you need 150+ cha to be effective.  I dont<br/>\n&gt; have that kind of cha and do as well as can be expected.  It&#39;s good to be<br/>\n&gt; thinking ahead and high str and cha that you have rolled seem just fine to<br/>\n&gt; me.  I am considering that sta might be worth while as it is rather hard<br/>\n </span></blockquote>to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; add later on where both str and cha can be boosted with items as well as<br/>\n </span></blockquote>agi<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and dex.  Stamina in stats adds to you hp and ac I think (or is it only<br/>\n&gt; p?)  - yes we have a sta song and depending on your weps (and friends to<br/>\n&gt; buff you) you can use that.  In EQ today, Level is God, AC Is King, and<br/>\n&gt; resists are your best friends.  All the other stats are marginal after you<br/>\n&gt; get them to a decent level (around 100 or so).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Be sure to send me a /tell next time you are online and I might have some<br/>\n&gt; stuff to help get you started.
