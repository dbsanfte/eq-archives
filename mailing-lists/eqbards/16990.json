So here I am<br/>\nasking for advice camping the Avatar of Fear in Cazic Thule.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far I&#39;ve spent a ton of time in the courtyard and a decent amount of time<br/>\nat 4C, top and bottom. I&#39;ve also been to the gator pools (green and blue)<br/>\nand the throne room. Specifically I&#39;m curious what dangers to watch out for<br/>\n(besides the avatar himself) and any advice in so far as what songs if any<br/>\nare highly effective or ineffective. (party is rogue, druid, warrior, bard<br/>\nand possibly enchanter and mage, all levels 30-35)<br/>\n<br/>\nDraelon Stormsong</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
