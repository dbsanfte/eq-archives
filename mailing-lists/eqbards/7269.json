Now I<br/>\nthought that might be wrong, because I was breaking Ghoul Root, in Unrest<br/>\nand Oasis, 2 days after the patch that caused it.  Even after doing this<br/>\nprobably a half a dozen times.  I chalked it up to conisidence.  But last<br/>\nnight I was fighting Orcs in Highpass, and I got rooted a couple of times<br/>\nfrom... it was either Fanatic or Medic... when I clicked Selos&#39;s just to<br/>\nsee, both times I was released right when I got the boot symbol.  Has anyone<br/>\nelse noticed this.  Or has anyone else been unable to get unrooted?  Am I<br/>\njust really lucky, or perhaps someone has an explanation.<br/>\n<br/>\nSevin Tercet 22nd Human Bard<br/>\non Brell<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Lonnie Lewis [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:LLewis@...\">LLewis@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, September 28, 1999 9:51 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Patch Update today<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Lonnie Lewis &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:LLewis@...\">LLewis@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; BINGO!
