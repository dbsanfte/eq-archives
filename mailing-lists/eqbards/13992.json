After that, if you<br/>\nkill it again, nothing drops.  If you contribute to a kill, it<br/>\nis considered &quot;your kill&quot; only if you look at the loot on<br/>\nit.  You would have to be a minimum level to loot named mobs.<br/>\n<br/>\n- If you don&#39;t get the item you want, you can&#39;t just kill the<br/>\n  mob over and over until you do.<br/>\n- Forces you to trade for an item if the named mob didn&#39;t drop<br/>\n  the item you were hoping to get.<br/>\n+ If you don&#39;t get the item you want, you can&#39;t just kill the<br/>\n  mob over and over until you do.<br/>\n+ Lets you (try to) get an item even if it&#39;s way below your level.<br/>\n+ Stops farming cold.<br/>\n+ Eliminates virtually all incentive to kill-steal for loot.<br/>\n+ Limits the damage that one greedy twit can do, at least<br/>\n  until the twit powerlevels up another character.<br/>\n+ Eliminates the waiting that is so prevalent in this game.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe last one is an important point.  Say Verant wants to make<br/>\nDwarven Work Boots so rare that only 1 in 10 people have them.  <br/>\nRight now, they just make the mob, drop, and camp time so<br/>\nfrustratingly long that only 1 in 10 players has the patience<br/>\nor ability to camp for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnder my system, the ghost could spawn every 30 minutes.  If<br/>\nyou wanted to try for DWB, you&#39;d get a group together.  You<br/>\nkill the ghost, loot, and if you&#39;re the lucky 1 in 10 you get<br/>\nDWB.  If not, too bad.  You killed the ghost, congratulations,<br/>\nnow move on.  If you really want the DWB, you&#39;ll have to trade<br/>\nfor them.  But instead of spending 8 hours camping the site<br/>\n(and thus blocking other people from getting their shot at<br/>\nDWBs), you&#39;d move on to do something else.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis would require Verant to work on generating enough quests<br/>\nand other interesting things to do so that we wouldn&#39;t run out<br/>\nof things to try to get.  Something they may not be capable of<br/>\ndoing.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H. Kim<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
