I think a group of 6 level 30&#39;s would have<br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt; very tough time taking him out.  He has a ton of hit points, does a Harm<br/>\n&gt; Touch at the beginning of the battle good for at least 2 bubbles of life,<br/>\n&gt; and resists chain and root bigtime.  i couldn&#39;t chain him before level 40,<br/>\n&gt; and we always had to fight him far from the door and have all our casters<br/>\n&gt; keep nuking mana cause if he runs and makes it out, you will have a train<br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; gators and lizzies like you wouldn&#39;t believe.  I would suggest 6 level<br/>\n&gt; 35&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; to take him.  it&#39;s been a while since i fought him, so correct me if i am<br/>\n&gt; inaccurate.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Oh and the demon claw is very nice.  i think closer to 300 to 400pp for it<br/>\n&gt; though, especially if 500pp is everything you have.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Shada Silverleaf, Level 50 Bard, Mithaniel Marr<br/>\n&gt; Erisi, Level 8 Paladin, Mithaniel Marr<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Adam DeMarino [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:psycotix@...\">psycotix@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Friday, July 09, 1999 9:46 AM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [eqbards] Demon Claw (Bladed Thulian)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Adam DeMarino &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:psycotix@...\">psycotix@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve never seen a demon claw at 500pp; if your getting it fo <br/>\n&gt; &gt; that much I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; would say buy it. They are low weight, and very fast. Defintely worth<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the money unless your heading into lower guk anytime soon and getting<br/>\n&gt; &gt; some of the great stuff there. At 30 I wouldn&#39;t expect you to pay for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; one anyway. Pick up digs and head into Cazic-thule and start <br/>\n&gt; &gt; hunting up<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that rubicite. The same guy with the breastplate has the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; claw. I&#39;m kinda<br/>\n&gt; &gt; surprised you haven&#39;t hunted it down yet, as on Solusek Ro I <br/>\n&gt; &gt; rarely see<br/>\n&gt; &gt; someone above 30 or so not in cazic-thule once they&#39;ve been <br/>\n&gt; &gt; there a few<br/>\n&gt; &gt; days, and I kinda feel bad that I haven&#39;t gotten it once, <br/>\n&gt; &gt; though I have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hunted in groups that kiled both golems, and many tae ews, considering<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve hunted there for quite some time now.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Talonus DuPrey<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Traveling Bard of Solusek Ro<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lankyak@...\">lankyak@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  your connection to like-minds and kindred spirits.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
