For<br/>\na while, around lvl 10 or so, I ran around SK, Rathe<br/>\nMountains, and EK, auctioning &quot;buying black pearls&quot;. I<br/>\nwould buy them at the site of the kill, and sell them<br/>\nfor 100pp apiece to jewelers I knew. Made a few<br/>\nhundred plat that way, incredible cash at lvl 10. BTW,<br/>\n100pp is the going rate for pearls on Innoruuk,<br/>\nsomeone said they were 200 on some servers? The druids<br/>\nalso drop them, as do the named centaurs in SK.
