","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1687898384\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I trained disarm traps.  Ignoring for the moment that there<br/>\n&gt; are no traps in the game to disarm, does anyone know how we&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; supposed to disarm traps when we don&#39;t get locate traps?<br/>\n&gt; Relying on a rogue to locate the traps for you is pointless<br/>\n&gt; since he&#39;ll be better at disarming them.  And finding traps by<br/>\n&gt; triggering them is also pointless since once they&#39;re triggered<br/>\n&gt; they don&#39;t need to be disarmed (unless of course they&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; designed to be continuous, which would seem to make locate<br/>\n&gt; traps useless).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I too have trained in this, but never actually found anything to disarm.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve been using instll doubt and actually had it work a couple<br/>\n&gt; times.  Last night, while I was invisible, I used instill<br/>\n&gt; doubt on a dark elf seargant in Nektulos.  He gave the<br/>\n&gt; standard wood-elves-must-die cry, then said he was hit by 1<br/>\n&gt; point of non-melee damage, followed immediately by a message<br/>\n&gt; saying I&#39;d kicked him.  Then he ran away (due to the skill<br/>\n&gt; working).  Huh?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Wow, I am REALLY impressed.  I have pressed this button hundreds of times...<br/>\nmaybe thousands, and NEVER had it work.  I *have* experienced the kick thing<br/>\nthough.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve been playing around with beg as well.  Apparently you can<br/>\n&gt; beg from monsters and mage pets, but not ships and PCs.  I<br/>\n&gt; tried begging from a merchant and a guard in East Commonlands.<br/>\n&gt; In both cases, they immediately killed a wandering monster<br/>\n&gt; nearby.  It might&#39;ve been coincidence, but I have to wonder.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve seen guards kill players for begging from them before, so<br/>\n&gt; I was expecting them to attack me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Never begged, so i can&#39;t comment.  When you beg from a mage pet... does it<br/>\ngive you anything?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sneak...  I&#39;ve heard rogues say they use sneak to make<br/>\n&gt; merchants indifferent to them.  I can do the same thing with<br/>\n&gt; hide, but haven&#39;t been able to do it with sneak, even when I<br/>\n&gt; sneak successfully (move like a glacier).  I&#39;ll have to test<br/>\n&gt; it by trying to sneak past some mobs.  I suppose it&#39;s possible<br/>\n&gt; the skill is broken for non-rogues.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sneaking no longer lets rogues shop where they could not shop before, as my<br/>\nstarving rogue discovered the other day.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe that sneak works for other classes (monk and bard) but only rogues<br/>\nget the success and failure messages associated with it.  Given the bard&#39;s<br/>\nvery low sneak scores, it&#39;s possible that you&#39;re just failing your sneak all<br/>\nthe time, rather than the skill not working.<br/>\n<br/>\nJyzan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
