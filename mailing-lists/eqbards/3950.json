I was playing in Unrest in<br/>\nthe morning once, with about 12 people in the zone.  The<br/>\nKnight of Unrest and hags and I think even the barkeep once<br/>\nwould regularly roam the yard around the house.  These were<br/>\nnot trains or returning trains.  They were &quot;making the<br/>\nrounds.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is their spawn points are fixed, and campers kill<br/>\nthem long before they start to wander.  What&#39;s needed is for<br/>\nthe spawn locations to be randomized, like with the Warlord in<br/>\nCrushbone (and even he is not sufficiently randomized as I<br/>\noften see people camping one of several spots where he shows<br/>\nup).  If they can&#39;t do that, then they need to randomize the<br/>\nspawn times so you can&#39;t separate the spawns out in time to<br/>\nwhere it&#39;s safe to camp the room.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;       I HATE camping.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yup.  Brad McQuaid said something about these named mobs being<br/>\nnice prizes for people who explore areas?  Good in theory, but<br/>\nin practice it&#39;s the campers who get all the nice prizes.  <br/>\nFolks who explore and sweep dungeons get all the crap loot<br/>\nVerant thoughtfully puts on &quot;lesser&quot; mobs (gee, you don&#39;t<br/>\nthink *that* could have anything to do with people camping,<br/>\nhuh?), and when they do run across an area where a named mob<br/>\n*should* be, it&#39;s camped.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;      the good loot is.  So I hang with him about half the time and rack up <br/>\n&gt;      the money and then I buy what I want when I have the Plat.  Much more <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I only buy items from people whom I know don&#39;t camp for the<br/>\nsole purpose of getting items to sell.  Otherwise I&#39;m just<br/>\nencouraging harvesting camping.  I&#39;ve even thought of<br/>\nsuggesting that unless you or your party did *all* of the<br/>\ndamage to a mob, if an item is unusable by your class, you<br/>\ncan&#39;t loot it.  It would suck in some cases, but it would<br/>\ncompletely localize the caster kill-stealing problem to<br/>\ncaster-usable items.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
