At 12 you get<br/>\n8 pts per pulse with lute while sitting total.  That&#39;s 6 from Hymn plus 2<br/>\nnatural.  At 18th you get 10 per pulse sitting total, again 8 from Hymn plus<br/>\n2 natural.  Your sitting regen rates increases past 2 after 20th level, not<br/>\nsure exactly when but I know it goes up to 3 natural regen somewhere soon on<br/>\nor after 20th.  <br/>\nUsing my formula for lute of (1hp + 1hp/6lvls)*2 means at 12 hymn should do<br/>\n6, it does; at 18th it should do 8, again it does.  It does half that much<br/>\nwithout lute so you get at 12th level Hymn for 3, plus 1 natural so 4.  At<br/>\n18 it would be 4 plus 1 natural so 5.  These both fit the actual result so<br/>\nthe equation is correct.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;More simply put, Hymn starts at 6 per pulse at 6th level (but you&#39;d get two<br/>\n&gt;from just sitting without the song) and it improves 2 hp per pulse every<br/>\n </span></blockquote>six<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;levels after.
