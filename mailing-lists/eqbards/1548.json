WOW, I think superman is the one word for it. Previously, the two<br/>\nwould not stack and I&quot;d run slow, now with a drum, selo&#39;s and SoW I was<br/>\ninsanely fast. I then had a shaman cast something like Quickness on me,<br/>\nand let me tell you, it was almost like I was drunk, the world was<br/>\nzoooooooomming by me so fast :)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo all I can say, make friends with druids and shamans.
