I&#39;m not high enough<br/>\nlevel to sing Pixie yet so can&#39;t speak from experience.  It just seems that<br/>\nit would be harder and more time consuming to target the three mobs in<br/>\ncombat versus singing the Lullaby and not worrying about targetting.  Do<br/>\nmobs have a higher resist rate versus Lullaby than Pixie?  If so thats an<br/>\nobvious reason to use Pixie.  I assume the duration of the two are close to<br/>\nthe same.   Please provide clarification for us junior bards:-)<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; But if you give me three unmesmerized mobs, I&#39;ll probably have to<br/>\n&gt; Strike the first one 5-7 times before one finally &quot;sticks.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Only then can I move on to trying to get one to stick to the<br/>\n&gt; second, which means another 5-7 tries while keeping the first<br/>\n&gt; one refreshed.  By this time my cleric is dead from having the<br/>\n&gt; 2 other mobs beating on him while I futzed around with the<br/>\n&gt; first one.  That is what makes this song broken and virtually<br/>\n&gt; useless.  Given the high &quot;false failure&quot; rate, I found it more<br/>\n&gt; effective to just charm the thing and remove its damage from<br/>\n&gt; the fight on the first try.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
