But then, I&#39;ve played a female<br/>\nhalf-elf bard since 2d week of P4, so I&#39;m a bit biased.  Cantador, the 36th<br/>\nlvl bard on MithMarr also states that the half-elf is the best bard (he runs<br/>\na male HE bard).  Lots of people choose female woodelf, but I think that&#39;s<br/>\njust for the kawaii (er... cuteness). =)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: El Gato Frito &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fire3@...\">fire3@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;what does everyone think is the best places to put the<br/>\n&gt;extra attribute points into?  also, what is the best race<br/>\n&gt;for a bard?<br/>\n&gt;thanks<br/>\n&gt;Rasmussen, monk of the 6th chamber<br/>\n&gt;soon to be a bard as well ;)<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Where do some of the Internet&#39;s largest email lists reside?<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;At ONElist - the most scalable and reliable service on the Internet.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
