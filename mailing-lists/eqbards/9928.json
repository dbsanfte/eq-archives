Then go west to the<br/>\nnamed treant. Give him that 10 pound case of jumjum juice you have been<br/>\ncarrying around since level 12.  Look around a bit and you will see a little<br/>\nruin tower thing sticking up from the ground.  Camp just south of that and<br/>\nyou will see &#39;fawns (mostly) and &#39;feenes spawning between you and the<br/>\ntreant.  We kill everything that flys by - well not Grim - we run from Grim.<br/>\nIts far north side - about mid zone.

On night me and another 35th <br/>\n&gt; level bard were in N Karana hunting Griffenes for our charms and it was <br/>\n&gt; amzaing out fast we could depop the zone of any griffs or hill giants that<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; were unlucky enough to show up on our tracking.  There was even a Guide <br/>\n&gt; watching us for part of the night, I guess someone felt we were too <br/>\n&gt; successful :)   My partner Ziann had the largest train of the night, he <br/>\n&gt; managed to grab 5 griffawns at once, which were quickly dispatch by our<br/>\n&gt; 50th <br/>\n&gt; level shamen.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Rokenn Swiftsong - Karana server<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Kevikazzam@...\">Kevikazzam@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;Subject: Re: [eqbards] Tracking<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Date: Thu, 11 Nov 1999 12:17:53 EST<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   I don&#39;t necessarily want to track as good as a ranger, or forage - but<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;WOULD like to be able to have the thing be useful.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;My track capped out at 100 i believe. and i find it very very useful.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;especially in Solb when there are 40 - 50 people there.
