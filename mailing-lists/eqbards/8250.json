Wisp loot was not nerfed.  Unlike most<br/>\npeople, when I got my first combine weapon, I killed every<br/>\nwisp I saw, not just the lighted ones.  I typically got one GL<br/>\nper 10 wisps, and one LS per 3-4 wisps.  This ratio did not<br/>\nchange when the burnt out stones were put in, and I&#39;ve found<br/>\nit to still hold true while hunting wisps with my enchanter.  <br/>\nOccasionally I&#39;ll get some really lucky or unlucky streaks.  <br/>\nI&#39;ve gone an entire day (maybe 50 wisps) with every lightstone<br/>\nbeing burnt ont, and I&#39;ve gotten 5 GLs in 7 wisps.  But the<br/>\noverall ratio has remained the same.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs someone else pointed out, the burnt out stones were put in<br/>\nso you couldn&#39;t harvest just the wisps with lights.  The only<br/>\npeople complaining about not getting as many lightstones as<br/>\nthey used to were the ones who used to only kill the wisps<br/>\nwith lights.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey *did* nerf the coin loot on the wisps though.  When I<br/>\nfirst hunted them, I made almost half my money off them in<br/>\ncoin, which was why I killed every one I saw.  Getting 7-8gp<br/>\noff one was not uncommon.  Now it&#39;s rare to get more than<br/>\nsilver from them.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
