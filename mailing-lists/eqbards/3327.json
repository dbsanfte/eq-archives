The ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-803543212\">Hang out just outside Crushbone, they usually will loot Dvinn, run outside<br/>\nand auction it, I have seen them sell for 10 pp.  You might get lucky.  The<br/>\ndragoon&#39;s dirk is better than almost any combine/well balanced weapon.  I<br/>\nwould not waste any money on the store bought variety, Demon claws are nice,<br/>\nbut very expensive, and so is the PGT, if you don&#39;t need magical weapons<br/>\nyet, the Dwarven axe that comes off Lord Darvish is great, there are two<br/>\nvarieties, 1hs, and 2hs, bards can only use the 1h version.  The 2h version<br/>\nsells for some serious plat tho, so it&#39;s good to get to sell.  The one hand<br/>\nversion does dmg 6, delay 26, so it&#39;s delay is almost as good as Dirk, and<br/>\nit does same damage, so except for the non magical ability it&#39;s a really<br/>\ngood weapon.  In one hit the Mino axe does more damage, over the length of a<br/>\nfight, you will do 20PTS+ more damage than the mino because you swung almost<br/>\n30% faster.  It makes a big difference, it also maxes your 1hs skill faster,<br/>\nbetween the dirk and axe, I max both my skills within about 20 minutes of<br/>\nleveling.<br/>\n<br/>\nWenaddar<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\tJohn Buenavides [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jbuenavides@...\">jbuenavides@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tMonday, July 12, 1999 3:28 PM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject:\t[eqbards] Weapons at level 9 and up<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: John Buenavides &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jbuenavides@...\">jbuenavides@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have just reached Level 9, and am currently considering going<br/>\n&gt; beyond the safety of East Commonlands.
