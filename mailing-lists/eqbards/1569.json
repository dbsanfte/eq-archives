When my ranger<br/>\nfriend is pulling a creature in, I usually target him early and try to<br/>\nassist as he&#39;s running back... Doesn&#39;t seem to work all the time as he&#39;s<br/>\nprobably got me or a party member tracked to find his way back.  Seems<br/>\nthere&#39;s also a range on it.  I also network and my GF plays next to me...<br/>\nI&#39;ve noticed that I have to hit &quot;A&quot; for auto-attack before her assist will<br/>\nwork.<br/>\n<br/>\nCharismatic Carillion - I used it on an Enchanter NPC in Qeynos that looked<br/>\ndown on me to get a cheap little quest of returning some bat fur.  Going to<br/>\ncheck prices on Combine&#39;s and Well Balanced very soon as i just got level 17<br/>\nand am in dire need of a 2nd weapon.<br/>\n<br/>\nHate list for Lullaby - Seems that maybe it does Nix the complete hate<br/>\nlist... but when it wakes up, it still remembers being asleep.  Since the<br/>\nBard put it to sleep, the Bard is the only one on the hate list at that<br/>\npoint.  This seems to confirm this thought I had - &quot;I&#39;ve noticed though that<br/>\nonce a mob is lulled, your hatedness by the creature is very low. If you<br/>\ndon&#39;t do anything else to it the next hit by someone else will draw it off.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Purposeful Trains - It is bannable, if they can prove it was intentional.<br/>\nVery very tough to do as a situation I was in showed.  Our party was in the<br/>\nGorge on Xegony.  There was a character wipe that affected approx 200<br/>\ncharacters and the last save was 2 weeks before.  This one character,<br/>\nDamarr, in particular had lost 9 levels, down to level 20, or so he said.  I<br/>\nheard him shouting in Rivervale, complaining whining, bitching, screaming at<br/>\nVerant, etc.  I ignored him.  We&#39;re fighting some muddites in the gorge and<br/>\nI noticed that the frequency of them coming in seems to be a bit much...<br/>\nwe&#39;d dispatch a group of 2 or 3 and there&#39;d be 2 more showing up... Seemed a<br/>\nbit strange, since the zone was relatively uncrowded and their wandering<br/>\npatterns aren&#39;t THAT frequent.  I thought nothing of it, but after killing 5<br/>\nor so, we zoned to runnyeye and healed up.  Back in the gorge a few minutes<br/>\nlater and we&#39;re fighting and no less than 4 Mino&#39;s come running in.  I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t see how, cause I was engrossed in battle, but my GF had seen Damarr<br/>\nleading them in.  She also mentioned she saw him leading in the muddites<br/>\nearlier.  We zoned, barely alive and I lost my cool and fired off a few<br/>\nchoice words saying that We were not verant and he shouldn&#39;t be trying to<br/>\ndestroy us cause he&#39;s pissed at them.  Back in the Gorge and other people<br/>\nare shouting about him and he starts to shout.  He ADMITS in a shout that<br/>\nhe&#39;s trying to kill everyone cause Verant screwed him over.  My girlfriend,<br/>\nmy party, and I, and who knows how many other people in the zone at that<br/>\ntime have screen shots of his admission.  We all petitioned and finally a<br/>\nguide showed up.  I was the one that was contacted and I was instructed to<br/>\ntry and get him to admit it again in a shout.  I&#39;m thinking ONCE was pretty<br/>\ndamn good for someone to admit it, but twice?  The screen shots apparently<br/>\naren&#39;t good enuf, since they can be doctored.... SHEESH!!!  So, it was my<br/>\njob to try and goad him into admitting in a shout or a say (guide was invis<br/>\nand parked right next to him) that he was purposefully training... Not a<br/>\nchance in hell of that happening twice.  All I did was make myself look like<br/>\nan asshole for &quot;stooping to his level&quot; and arguing and fighting with him in<br/>\nshouts... as one comment said, &quot;It looks like a 12 year old argument&quot;.  I<br/>\nended up apologizing to the guide for wasting her time and resisted the urge<br/>\nto throw the monitor on the floor.  : P  It is VERY hard to prove someone<br/>\ntrains intentionally.  This guy did it multiple times and nothing happened.<br/>\nWhile I don&#39;t condone training as a way of getting revenge (too many other<br/>\ninnocent people can be slaughtered) and I would never have the balls to do<br/>\nit myself, the only thing proven to me (By Verant) is that while bannable,<br/>\nit simply is not going to happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nto be continued............</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
