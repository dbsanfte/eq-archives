While soloing,<br/>\nI found John K&#39;s formula to be correct, although my version was a bit<br/>\nmore simple: If mob hits you (on average) 3 times before you can bellow<br/>\ntwice, it&#39;s better to have Psalm playing than bellowing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was in CT yesterday, in a group of 5 players. We were the only people<br/>\nin the zone (yay), and when I pulled, I would often get 5-6 lizzies<br/>\njoining in. Singing Psalm, the &quot;a Lizard Defender was burned&quot; spam was<br/>\nincredible. As you may know lizzies attack FAST. so they were hitting<br/>\noften, and for medium to small damage. VERY rough estimate that in one<br/>\nbattle, with 6 lizzies hitting on 4 targets (burner rarely got hit, he<br/>\nwas good), psalm (doing 6 dam per hit) may have burned the lizzies 20<br/>\ntimes each. that comes to 120 damage*6 or 720hp of damage throughout the<br/>\ncombat. Not bad, try doing that with bellow :). (again VERY rough<br/>\nestimate).<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, Psalm DOES increase in efficiency with number of party members, as<br/>\nlong as number of mobs increases also.]<br/>\n<br/>\nUldar Ulfangson<br/>\n30th bard, Rodcet Nife<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Message: 8<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Thu, 18 Nov 1999 09:24:47 -0800 (PST)<br/>\n&gt;    From: Eric Boller &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eboller@...\">eboller@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Psalm of Warmth<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I just got level 25 last night and memmed Psalm of<br/>\n&gt; Warmth.

I was wondering what<br/>\n&gt; people&#39;s opinions of it are.  I&#39;m thinking it would be<br/>\n&gt; great in a group and pretty awesome solo.
