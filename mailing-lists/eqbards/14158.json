I don&#39;t remember my songs ever<br/>\nending the UV effect.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne point I&#39;d like to make is that I&#39;ve been using those vendors in Oggok a<br/>\nlot lately, and if you sneak behind them and buy/sell your prices are a lot<br/>\nbetter than as a DE, although sneaking is less convenient.  I&#39;m the group&#39;s<br/>\ndesignated looter, I loot every Bouncer until my AGI starts dropping (with a<br/>\nShaman in the group no less, heh) and then sell and /split.  Therefore, the<br/>\nprice difference of 1pp per Long Sword adds up over the course of the night.<br/>\n<br/>\n[45 Bard] Crier (Half Elf) &lt;Seekers of Norrath&gt; ZONE: Oggok<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; The end result is that I hardly ever activate the illusion anymore.
