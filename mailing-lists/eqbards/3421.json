But I keep going back!  I have had Ged make me his<br/>\nBearskin gloves and am looking for a HQ LION to get the finest ones in all<br/>\nof Norrath.  Jed&#39;s druid friend - she won&#39;t talk to me not even with my cha<br/>\nsong.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIs anyone keeping track of the various inter-twining of these kind of<br/>\nthings?<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, talking to Furball Miller on the Miller farm. His sad story of<br/>\nwoe.  Then, there is the letter from the DE that the halfling in the<br/>\nHogcallers Inn has (part of the Lady Shae quest.) I got the letter and read<br/>\nit.  It implies that you can get a special thing if you deliver it to the<br/>\ncorrect person. <br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder if there is some underlying tale about Norrath or are these just<br/>\nindependent little quest things.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly. <br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\tElijah Meeker [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elijah@...\">elijah@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tMonday, July 12, 1999 11:42 AM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n\t\tSubject:\tRe: [eqbards] Adventure vacations levels<br/>\n12-15 *spoilers*<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFrom: &quot;Elijah Meeker&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elijah@...\">elijah@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t\t&gt;Finally someone else notices...I get sick of those messages<br/>\n </span></blockquote>that say<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t\t&gt;something like, &quot;We need to get rid of useless<br/>\n </span></blockquote>zones....like Kithicor&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tHeehee!
