I always hear words to the effect of &quot;it just takes a<br/>\nbit of strategy&quot;, but no one has every had any comment on what that strategy<br/>\nmight be.  The Ghoul Lord room, if broken and the three spawns staggered<br/>\nperfectly could not be held for any length of time by only one or two<br/>\nindividuals in my opinion.  The Boks and Guks that spawn there probably have<br/>\naround 15,000 hit points and do serious melee damage.  I&#39;ve been in high<br/>\n40s/50s groups that have spent three or four minutes killing a single frog.<br/>\nIf you get a Guk Wizard spawning as the Lord placeholder you&#39;re in serious<br/>\ntrouble with only two folks and a pet.  When the Lord spawns he has even<br/>\nMORE hitpoints and he&#39;s gonna Harm Touch one of ya (and hopefully) be<br/>\nprocing Ykesha on you.  If you know how one guy can stand up to that I sure<br/>\nwould like to hear it.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow granted, I have been in groups with a 50 necro where the pet solod Lava<br/>\nDuct Crawlers in Sol B and the pet had more than half health at the end of<br/>\nthe fight.  Not only that, the necro (Cinder) said &quot;Sigh - you shoulda seen<br/>\nmy pet *before* they nerfed Necros.&quot;  Well damn.  A single LDC can make a<br/>\nfull group in their lower 40s run for the zone with a couple of deaths but<br/>\none Necro pet (blue to me) can solo one?  And Necros complain?<br/>\n<br/>\nCrier<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Dark&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jackal@...\">jackal@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Heh the lord room is so easy. It&#39;s not as hard as people can<br/>\n&gt; think and I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; seen it held with a couple diffrent combos of two people casters<br/>\n&gt; and usually<br/>\n&gt; one is with pet though. However even after the patch the room is<br/>\n&gt; quite easy<br/>\n&gt; to crack with 1 necro and 1 person of any other class. It just takes a bit<br/>\n&gt; of strategy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Naeeldar </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
