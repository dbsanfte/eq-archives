For example, an ogre shaman is standing in front of you<br/>\nand starts casting a spell.  As soon as you see the text message that he has<br/>\nstarted casting the spell, you start singing the teleport song and<br/>\nsuccessfully teleport before he finishes casting the spell.  The teleport<br/>\ncould move you behind the shaman (no longer in his line of sight) or move<br/>\nyou further away out of the range of the spell.  Would you still get<br/>\naffected by the spell?  If not, would the shaman lose the mana?<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
